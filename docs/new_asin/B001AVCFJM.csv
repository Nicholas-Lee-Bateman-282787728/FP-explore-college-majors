3468088,5,B001AVCFJM,"I've been a die hard Star Trek fan for all of my life. I was raised on Star Trek. I love every aspect of it. Even the movies that didn't do so well, I still love those. When I saw this movie, it blew my mind. I loved the action and the humor that they put throughout the movie. While it did create its own nitch it still had the same good feeling of Star Trek behind it. The same familiar characters. I was so pleased with it I couldn't stop smiling. The redesign of the Enterprise was amazing. First I wasn't sure, still love the old, but I love this one too.

Personally I feel that it actually is the best Star Trek film in quite a while. It also has a more approachable feel to it for those that aren't or haven't been Star Trek fans. It doesn't stick to the old formula. It has diversity in its locations, amazing action scenes. From hand-to-hand weaponry to the large ship battles. Beautiful in every way. Even though it messes with the original sequence of events its still great. It might even help because now it makes this new era of movies somewhat unpredictable which is always interesting.

I wouldn't change a thing about this movie. In the future I hope to see at least another Star Trek movie with the exact cast(which was perfectly cast), the same director, same music composer, and the same special effects team. I'll be there to see this movie and the next again and again. I would recommend this movie for anyone who's looking to have a great movie experience, not just Star Trek fans.",1241740800,4,1505,4.352313167259786
3468089,4,B001AVCFJM,"Where to start?

1. I was 7-9 years old when the Original Series was on television.  I was hooked.

2. I was 20 when the ""Star Trek"" (the movies) were in the theatres.  I was hooked. (Loved ""The Movie"", 2, 4!  3, 5, 6 were okay...)

3. I was 28 when Star Trek (The Next Generation) was on television.  I was hooked.

4. At 50, I've been treated to a new release.  Not bad!  Different!  But not bad, at all!

For those of you, who, like me grew up with the series, keep an open mind (difficult for Trekkies, I know!), just go with this picture and enjoy it for what it is, and let it stand on it's own merits!  I think you'll like it!  My rating: 4 stars!",1241740800,3,654,3.9307692307692306
3468090,5,B001AVCFJM,"One of the better Star Trek movies, after the Undiscovered Country. I went with mixed expectations. But left the theater with a great feeling, this film has completely revamped the series. It might just spark another TV series...

If you're a Trek fan and you don't mind a little messing with the story line, it's well worth the money you spend to see it on the silver screen.",1241740800,4,376,4.529411764705882
3468091,5,B001AVCFJM,"Some, like my wife, will have a problem (small or large) with the makers of this hot summer release for playing fast and loose with the fabric of the original but I think the majority will love this new and extremely well made blockbuster. It's perfectly cast. Its script is fast and funny and it does a fine job avoiding the lameness that marred many of its predecessors. For me, this is the best ST movie since The Voyage Home and I look forward to another. Maybe they'll even put back what they took apart.

Anyway, from Taxi Driver up to Alien III I could always tell by the previews whether a movie was going to be good or bad. I thought Alien III was going to be good. Since then I've been fooled time and time again. This movie is no exception. Its trailer belied it quality. I thought for sure it would be no better than Insurrection or Nemesis but I couldn't have been more wrong. So, as long as you're not a fervent Trekker purist, you will have a great time. For the details, read the excellent review by the Joelmeister (first review posted).

Most highly recommended.",1241740800,4,1080,4.395
3468092,4,B001AVCFJM,"So much action, humor, and genuine adventure permeates J.J. Abrams' Star Trek that those unfamiliar with the ground-breaking television series will undoubtedly find entertainment in the sheer excitement of the renowned space travelers' re-envisioned maiden voyage. For those well versed in the annals of Star Trek lore, every inspired casting choice, catch phrase, and brilliantly re-imagined staple of the original universe will likely bring accolades of approval and nostalgic revelry. And for those on middle ground, even the troublesome time-shattering paradoxes at the heart of the story's conflict can't diminish the enjoyment derived from witnessing such a worthy - and much needed - serious rejuvenation of an integral part of science fiction's canon.

James T. Kirk's brash, rebellious, and authority-opposed nature has always guided him into formidable predicaments. However, his extreme intelligence and aversion to defeat has found him enrolled in the Federation Starfleet- a path his father also chose long ago. When a distress signal is sent out by the planet Vulcan, Kirk finds his way onto the USS Enterprise to join fellow graduates McCoy (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), and Chekov (Anton Yelchin), as well as the stone-faced and logic-driven Spock (Zachary Quinto), to engage in a colossal mission to save Earth - and the universe - from a maniacal renegade warlord (Eric Bana).

2009 seems to be the summer of prequels, starting with X-Men Origins: Wolverine, followed by Star Trek then Angels & Demons. What's most inspired about Trek is its amazing cast - they've somehow managed to get actors who look surprisingly like their older counterparts and have a familiar chemistry that makes them believable as younger versions of the famous starship crew. Like all of the reinventions of popular franchises flooding cinemas in the last few years, Star Trek tops its predecessors with stunning special effects, riveting adventure, legendary catch phrases, an intense plot that remains generally serious even with a satisfying blend of humor, and origins scenes that provoke generous applaud from longtime fans. So it hardly matters if the ice monsters of Delta Vega reek of Star Wars (both The Empire Strikes Back and The Phantom Menace).

The plot itself is a mixture of complex alternate realities, supernovas, black holes, red matter and science-fiction jargon, but the pacing is keen. With intimidating starship designs, unmatched space battle CG, stirring music, and the classic crew inheriting their positions to create a perfectly balanced camaraderie, Star Trek goes to great lengths to appeal to both diehard Trekkies and the curious but uneducated. Many previous films catered too much to familiar audiences, making this updated, contemporary, shiny new Trek movie a great place to jump aboard and become a fan.

3468093,5,B001AVCFJM,"First, if you've never seen a Trek film, now maybe the time...this is a solid movie, Trek or not...visually stunning, a wild paced trip with J.J.Abrams superb character banter.

Star Trek is such a cultural icon and so a part of the collective unconsciousness that even a passing familiarity is plenty enough to enjoy the new TREK MOVIE. J.J.Abrams of TV's LOST & the Mission Impossible series shows how the famous crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise first comes aboard to explore strange new worlds. Talk about ""no win scenario""...the big question in the minds of fans and non-fans alike: can younger actors fill these enormous space boots. The answer is yes, but with a major role for the original Spock, Leonard Nimoy, time traveling of course, there's no need to worry about the absence of the original crew.

Chris Pine's take on impulsive space cowboy James T. Kirk is no SNL parody of Shatner's portrayal but recognizable (although as the climax draws near he scores some very Capt. Kirk classic moments ""I've got your gun.""). Zachary Quinto a.k.a Sylar-Spock is perfect as a young Vulcan (with a girlfriend!). Karl Urban is dead on a Leonard ""Bones"" Mcoy with maybe the coolest intro in the film. Uhura is played by Zoe Saldana who is a great likeness of young Nichelle Nichols, but with so much more to do, than poor Nichelle. The same can't be said for Chekov, Sulu and Scott who had less important places in the big picture, but were each well played, Simon Pegg's Scotty was great fun.

Without given too, much away, some answers....Does a ""Red Shirt"" die? Ho yeah...Does Kirk tear his shirt? Nah...Does Bones declare someone ""Dead, Jim?"" Sorta...Nerve Pinch? Got `em....Warp Speed?  The Best ever!!!....Beam ins and outs? Yes and much more (can you say space-dive?)...How about the KOBAYASHI MARU test? I prequel has to have it right? Yes, it is in there and may even live up to expectations, too!

Due to interference by a future Romulian, Nero, play brilliantly by Eric Bana, an alternate timeline is created. While strikingly similar to the original Trek, the movie ends with many things already clearly different from the series (like Capt. Pike's final fate).  In doing this 2 things are ultimately accomplished 1.) many Prequel / Series discontinuities are dispersed due to interference by Nero. 2.) the future of the Trek film franchise can continue without fear of rewriting any aspect of the show or films using the new cast.

The Star Trek prequel hopefully will herald the reboot of the Star Trek franchise, it sure has the potential. Star Trek Lives!",1241654400,3,2569,4.864988558352403
3468094,1,B001AVCFJM,"In the theatre, this film was preceded by a trailer for the new Transformers movie. Watching the film, I thought 1) that it was oddly similar to the Transformers trailer, and 2) actually, the Transformers movie would probably have been more fun.

The original Star Trek&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/series/dp/B001DHXT6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">series</a>&nbsp;had two primary strengths. The first was the theme of friendship between the main characters (especially Kirk, Spock and McCoy). This went beyond Starfleet loyalty. Kirk could be assailed by powerful bad guys, but he was also surrounded by people in whom he could place complete trust.

This film takes its cues from superhero flicks like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001GZ6QC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>, where the hero is a paranoid loner who can't trust anyone with his secrets. Like the superhero flicks, the film requires an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/origin-story/dp/B00005JNJV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">origin story</a>, so when it starts, the characters don't know each other yet. So Kirk doesn't yet have any friends, and furthermore the writers want him to come in conflict with Spock because that's what's supposed to happen in these types of things. But that conflict goes to ludicrous extremes. The motivation for the scene where Kirk goes to the ice planet is insane. From the point of view of any normal person, no matter how annoying Kirk was being, Spock's response constitutes a psychopathic abuse of power, making him totally unfit for service. The non-insane thing to do would have been to put Kirk in the brig. I realize that the only reason the writers used this setup was because they needed a plot device that would get Kirk to meet the visitor down on the planet without Spock knowing. But if this was the best the writers could do, they should have been fired in the early stages of the screenwriting.

The second main strength of the Trek franchise was the particular acting style it attracted. Star Trek was the last refuge of an old-fashioned style of acting, more commonly seen in old black-and-white Hollywood movies. It was fake, but it was classy. All the best Star Trek actors -- Ricardo Montalban, Christopher Plummer, Mark Lenard, Patrick Stewart, Marc Alaimo, and yes, William Shatner -- were able to use Star Trek to give masterful performances in this style. There is a reason why many Star Trek actors did Shakespeare at some point in their lives.

But here, let's just say that this line of thought never entered into anybody's mind. Here, the character of Kirk is shown as a type common to many contemporary films -- the unpleasant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/slacker/dp/B001ECQ75A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">slacker</a>&nbsp;who nonetheless succeeds at everything just because of his innate greatness, which requires no effort to develop. Words cannot describe how irritating his simpering, sneering face is in this film. This was actually not the way Kirk did things in the original series, despite his reputation for rashness. Even in the sixties TV show, where he was supposed to be a man's man, he always showed great concern for his crew. Whenever a red-shirt died, Kirk would always make at least a token display of sorrow. It showed that he understood the risks involved, and it also implied that he put at least some care into his plans. But here, Kirk's primary concerns are to satisfy his ego and impress girls. This leads to one admittedly funny scene in the dorm room, but it is extremely unsympathetic motivation for a starship captain.

Kirk's characterization in this film is not merely different from the original series. It's actually worse. It gives Kirk no redeeming qualities.

Some of the supporting characters are better, but they get very little screen time. The guy doing McCoy is quite good. Unsurprisingly, this is because he sticks more closely to the original character than anybody else (he does the voice well). His lines are almost entirely recycled from McCoy's catch-phrases. The best character overall is, unexpectedly, Uhura, who squeezes something out of the hack screenplay by expressing some sexy compassion for Spock. This is the only likeable emotion in the film.

The film is extremely hyperactive. The set design looks like it might be visually interesting, but the camera cuts through each shot before you can see what's going on. For this reason, the action sequences create the impression of confusion instead of action. You don't have time to thrill over Sulu's swordfight because you don't see most of the moves. You don't see the actual feats of dexterity.

At the end, I wondered why the film took so much time. It's more than two hours long, the second&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/longest/dp/B00005JKHP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">longest</a>&nbsp;Trek film ever. But what takes up those two hours? Aside from Kirk's pouty-lipped pretty-boy, is there a character that the film spends a lot of time on? The villain in Star Trek is usually good for exaggerated drama, but Nero only gets a couple of lines of exposition when he talks to Christopher Pike. The Romulans here are like grungy barbarian versions of the Romulans in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nemesis/dp/B000A6T1KE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nemesis</a>&nbsp;(formerly the worst Star Trek film, until now), with the same dank atmosphere in their ship.

No, really, why is the thing so long? It doesn't even contain a bona fide space battle. It flies through so many things so frenetically (Kirk's father's dramatic farewell to his wife! Spock's dramatic farewell to his mother! the Kobayashi Maru test!) that it ends up showing absolutely nothing.

Do not give these people your money. If you want Star Trek, watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wrath-Of-Khan/dp/B0000683DH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wrath Of Khan</a>. If you want an action flick, watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers/dp/B000VR0570/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers</a>.

Oh, one more thing. The only explanation of the Federation (the society in which humans live) in the film is the one given by Christopher Pike: ""The Federation is a peacekeeping and humanitarian armada."" Not once does anybody mention exploring the galaxy. It does not enter into Kirk's motivation at all. There is something deeply wrong about that.",1241654400,37,6739,5.859327217125382
3468095,5,B001AVCFJM,"The story opens as the Federation Starship Kelvin encounters a lightning storm in space and a tentacled alien ship. Their Captain takes a shuttle craft over to negotiate with Nero (Eric Bana) a Romulan, leaving George Kirk in charge. When the situation gets dire, George Kirk evacuates the ship including his wife who is delivering their child. George Kirk hears his son's cries as he fights to keep his crew alive.

Next, we follow the early life of a very rebellious young James Tiberius Kirk alternating with young half Vulcan-half human Spock. From stealing a classic sportscar and getting caught to engaging in bar fights, we can definitely see what events shaped the Captain's life. Spock's life took a very different tack, as he attempted to abandon his early anger at Vulcan rejection and embrace logic.

Then Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) challenges Jim Kirk to step up just as the Starfleet academy recruits are leaving. He tells Kirk about his father, George: ""He was Captain for 12 minutes and saved an 800 person crew,"" and challenges his son to live up to the legend.

We follow Jim Kirk's (played by Chris Pine) career from there, introducing him to the various crew members at key points in the plot. His meeting with ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban) is classic! Most of us were cheering at their interactions throughout the film. JJ Abrams and the actors had their humor down pat. We also see what happened with the famed Kobayashi Maru Trial. This is where Kirk meets up with Spock (Zachary Quinto) for the first time and they naturally clash. Then, it's time for their first assignment to a starship--and the eventual run-in with Nero and his Romulan ship.

While the actors are (save for Leonard Nimoy as an older Spock) not the original cast, JJ Abrams did a very credible job finding actors with both strong resemblance and characteristics to the originals. Simon Pegg (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) as Engineer Montgomery Scott was a stroke of genius. He played the role with the exact amount of humor and bombast. Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy was also another real winner. At last, we find out what propelled the good doctor off solid ground and into space.

The special effects were excellent. Recalling the original episodes from my elementary school days, I can definitely say they have come a long way from using adapted salt and pepper shakers as communication devices. Battle scenes were so good, I found myself holding my breath.

Both my husband and I gave the film an enthusiastic thumbs up. We're going back to see it again this weekend and are buying the Blu-Ray disk. I genuinely hope that this ST franchise continues. Both my spouse and I agree this is the best of the spinoffs.

3468096,5,B001AVCFJM,"I was able to see an early showing of Star Trek on Saturday. Reactions seemed pretty unanimous on the way out.

When the USS Kelvin is attacked by Romulans, they are quickly overwhelmed by the massive, enemy vessel. The Romulan leader, Nero, is looking for vengeance, and focuses on Spock. But Nero and his crew are from the future. Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the incredibly young crew of the USS Enterprise must discover Nero's plans and stop him before he takes out his revenge on the entire Federation.

From beginning to end, this was a non-stop action-packed revamp to the Star Trek franchise. As a fan of the original Star Trek series, I came in a bit sceptic about other actors playing iconic roles, but wanted to be surprised. J.J. Abrams satisfied all of my worries.

The casting was supurb. Chris Pine as Jim Kirk was completely believable as the hot-headed, ladies-man, with a legendary destiny. And Zachary Quinto as Spock was inspired. I was afraid that I'd only be able to picture him as a creepy serial killer, but I never once thought of his Heroes` character. He just became Spock. The banter between Kirk, Spock, and Karl Urban's Dr. McCoy was especially humorous and heart-warming. Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and Scotty (Simon Pegg) all had their scene-stealing moments as well.

Eric Bana as Nero was reminiscent of Khan from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. His motive is pure vengeance. And the odds are in his favor with his ship, advanced technology, and knowledge of the future. But when the odds are against them and the situation is grim is when Kirk works best.

The special effects were fantastic. The battle scenes in space were particularly incredible. The story was able to pacify a die-hard fan like me, as well as leave room for future installments. But the shining highlight for me, was hearing the familiar, and often beloved, sayings from the Enterprise crew. And being able to accept them from newer, younger actors. It was wonderful seeing Leonard Nimoy as older Spock, and it was great to have his character play an integral role in the story.

Star Trek is full of excitement, suspense, and plenty of humor. Life-long fans as well as people with only a passing knowledge of Star Trek will enjoy this all-around excellent film. It's sure to be a summer blockbuster, with a new generation of fans. I can't wait to see it again.",1241481600,2,2403,4.723150357995227

I was a young teen when the TV series came on in the 60s. So I was a big fan of that one. One of the main reasons that I loved the series was because of the racial diversity of the main 7 characters: Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Bones, Scotty, Sulu, and Chekhov. But the stories were mind-blowing too, for its time!

3468121,3,B001AVCFJM,"I loved ""Star Trek"" when I saw it in reruns as a boy. I neither follow or ignore it now, but I had heard much about this ""Star Trek"" reboot and found much to like and a bit not to be so fond of.

First and most obviously, the film is visually stunning. Every frame looks great, and the effects are dazzling. Unfortunately, the effects were the high point for me. Most of the cast turned in good performances, with Chris Pine and Simon Pegg (Kirk and Scott, respectively) really excelling here. I think my biggest problem with the film were the forced contrivances that stand in for backstory in the character's histories. I didn't find some of it especially believable, particularly Kirk's youthful indiscretions. The reality is that military academies have notoriously small senses of humor for challenging students (or junior officers) regardless of brilliance or aptitude. Lack of self-discipline doesn't bode well for selection or success. I'm sure the Starfleet Academy would be much more progressive than any current service academy, but traits of successful officers normally don't involve rebelliousness. If that had been the only issue I would have given the film four stars, as it is generally quite good in most areas, but I am not thrilled to discover that some special features from other (and in some cases cheaper) releases of the movie are not on the Blu-ray (notably the gag reel), though the commentary with J. J. Abrams and others is available, so my final net rating for the film and Blu-ray packaging is three stars.

This is worthwhile viewing for even the most casual of ""Star Trek"" fans.",1511568000,,1611,4.8545454545454545

However, I had to order and return two previous copies before I received a non-defective BD disc (each disc was defective in a different location, which stopped playback). Play the movie from start to end during the return period to assure the disc does not have manufacturing defects. Amazon stopped selling these for a period (after I returned the second defective disc) so apparently there was an entire manufacturing lot with problems. I had to wait for over a month after returning the second defective disc before they were again available for order.

3468125,5,B001AVCFJM,"I highly enjoyed this movie in Imax in the theater, and I was surprised that I enjoyed the Blu ray presentation just as much.

Although like many others I had my doubts about a ""reboot"" of the Star Trek universe in an alternate time line, I can certainly understand the temptation and the need to do so for these film makers. If they are going back to get the original crew in Star Fleet Academy, they would already be painted into a very small corner if they didn't do something to get away from 45 years of canon.

So let's take this movie on its own merits, without preconceptions. As a Star Trek fan since I watched the very first episode shown (""The Man Trap"", during Star Trek's 'sneak preview week' in 1966), I enjoyed this movie immensely, as science fiction, as an exciting adventure, and importantly, as Star Trek. I felt that Chris Pine did an excellent job of the 'alternate' Kirk growing into the confident and dynamic Captain Kirk. The 'young' Spock and McCoy were eerily similar to Nimoy and Kelly in those roles, and no one else destroyed the illusion.

Effects were spectacular. This is one of the few films that I've gone to see a 2nd time in the theater in the last 20 years, and it will be a frequent play on my blu ray player. Its been a long while since we've had any new Trek on TV or film. I've never been a quibbler when it comes to getting to watch new Trek. So even if this film had disappointed me to some extent, I'd have still welcomed it. However, I didn't have to quibble, I enjoyed it very much.",1508976000,,1528,4.317073170731708

It is generally good to be very leery of reboots and remakes - whatever happened to original ideas, anyway ? - but this movie does in fact offer a fresh new take on the Star Trek franchise, it's a fast-paced action movie with a young cast who actually do resemble their 1960s TV series counterparts without being carbon copies of them.
The story doesn't make a great deal of sense, especially after they bring the trans-dimensional 'older' Spock into it, but maybe it makes moire sense in the book......

He had me laughing with sarcastic one liners..Going into Spock's background gave me more of understanding of him. I must admit I was always forced by my brother's to watch Star Trek. when I was little. It was ok, and the other series that followed lost my interest. I couldn't get into the movies that were made,kinda bored me. I didn't even see this one at the theaters. I took a chance and watched Star trek into the darkness at the theaters. It was good, which I went on to see Star Trek Beyond..Which was also good .. So I finally seen this movie, absolutely loved it. This was very good, and I wish I would of seen it at the theaters..

I did not get more then a general idea about the characters (since they are so different), and I guess what can be done in the allotted time to develop them (the crew).
The lens flairs are particularly annoying, obscuring the screen at times, like an attempt to hide the ship and actors, basically that sucked. I saw this movie in theaters, and did not care for any behind the scenes, I am okay with the theatrical version.",1492732800,,564,4.280373831775701

When I received the blu-ray the digital copy is only for iTunes which if you know does not talk to DisneyMovies or VUDU making it a hassle if you are wanting to watch a digital version because they are not all in one place. No where in the description does it say that the digital copy is for iTunes, which yes I know some people don't care about that, but I am one who does since I do not use iTunes.

I am giving it 3 stars because yes it says that it comes with a digital copy, but it is lacking any details about the digital copy or additional pictures that how the back for you to see that it says iTunes on the back.",1492214400,2,813,3.957317073170732

My only complaint is that there are too many coincidences that take place throughout the film in an attempt to bring all the characters into the same roles they had in the original series.  The producers made a big deal about how this version was going to be different than the original.  In order to do this they introduce time travel so that events in this timeline are not the same as the original.

While the premise was a little crazy, the actors did such a great job that I felt this movie could be a stand alone or go with the original series! The actors were enough like the original cast, that you could easily see this as being their younger selves.

3468249,5,B001AVCFJM,"A nice introduction to the character we all know and love as James Tiberius Kirk. The violence at the bar was a bit gratuitous, though. Poor Kirk does seem to get his butt handed to him on several occasions throughout the film. Other than that, a compelling storyline that is easy to follow. It was nice to see the now late Leonard Nimoy make an appearance. He reminds us just how far back the friendship of Jim and Spock go, and how long Vulcans live!

All of the actors do a great job portraying their future selves, so to speak.

All in all, a terrific film, especially the bonus features of behind the scenes action and interviews.",1481241600,3,635,4.418803418803419

3468380,1,B001AVCFJM,"This film was my first encounter with the Paramount/Disney DVD copy-protection scheme, whose purpose is to make it difficult to back up whole DVDs. The DVD contains 99 titles of slightly different lengths. Each title shares blocks on the disk, so if you try to make a copy of the whole 7GB disk, I think you'll end up using around 700GB on your hard drive. I back-up every DVD I watch because it saves me from having to listen to the disk spinning while I watch it, and because it makes it quicker to navigate backward and forward if I miss part of the dialog. Trying to watch ""Star Trek"" in this way caused my hard drive to fill up, crashing an important computation which had been running for a week. I watched about 30 minutes of the first title before I realized that all the scenes were out of order - each of the 99 titles contains the scenes in a different order, and obviously only one of them is correct. I still haven't seen the full movie in order. If you like not having control over your computer then you'll love this DVD; but I think buyers should be forewarned.",1471996800,,1077,4.336633663366337

My two minor issues with this movie are technical. One, those damn lens flares in almost every scene. Having your own style is one thing but over using that style is just annoying and corny. Two, this movies writing follows too many modern movie tropes and attitudes making it feel less fresh and original than it otherwise would.

Probably pains the traditional trek fans to see the Enterprise destroyed in so many ways, but it helps people see its truly the crew that makes the ship, not the ship itself (yeah...former Navy too.)",1469232000,,467,4.85

3468532,3,B001AVCFJM,"Accomplished what it set out to do, make a Star Trek pop corn flick, incorporating a modern feel into the dormant Trek franchise. Some of the characters are spot on, such as Bones, some are dreadfully off- namely, Kirk. The villain has a questionable motivation, set up by a scenario that makes absolutely no sense. Turn off your brain, forget your nostalgia for the original franchise, and you'll enjoy it just fine.  Far better than its sequel, Into Darkness, which amplifies the misgivings of this film.",1468800000,,506,4.883720930232558

Nevertheless, I did give  this movie (and the second one 'Into The Darkness') another chance, and i'm glad I did. The most important thing is to keep the dream of living and working in space alive for the next generations. This reboot will do just fine serving that purpose. The new timeline lets the writers to take the characters in new directions. Hopefully the TV series starting in 2017 will be equally as good. Next month the 50th anniversary film is in the theaters. I hope the writers and director did a good job on it. Star Trek is not just another science fiction show. It's more than than to so many people around the world. It deserves the best for its 50th anniversary..",1467590400,,812,4.342105263157895

The Star Trek franchise was in need of some new life and Abrams has brought it.
The special effects are superb and the directing is excellent as well as offering us new characters with new and interesting personalities.
Their sense of humor and camaraderie are some of the 'fun' elements I always enjoyed in Star Trek.

It was an extremely clever move on the writers part to modify the story the way they did (Im trying to avoid writing up any kind of spoilers here), and it let them mold the story into something that were familiar with, but also has a life of its own.

There are obviously a few really well-known names in the movie, but I certainly didn't feel like it was all about any one character or that anyone overacted in any ways.  I was a little curious to see how Zachary Quinto would do as Spock, and I was far from disappointed.  Too many years of watching him as Syler had me worried!",1466121600,,661,4.181102362204724

3468610,5,B001AVCFJM,"There's something about this cast that makes this movie work far better than it should.  If anything, casting director should get the kudos for how well this movie played out.

In this version of Star Trek, a renegade Romulan wants Spock to watch Vulcan go up in flames - or down into a black hole as the case is.  In doing so he creates an alternate reality in which Enterprise is just outfitted and Pike is the Skipper.

Kirk is a cadet who has yet to graduate.  Everything else has graduated and are seemingly assigned to the Academy for a variety of reasons while Enterprise awaits christening and her maiden voyage.

The hows and whys this movie works is definitive Hollywood magic.  The CGI is seamless, the casting tight and the script, especially the lines, fantastic.  This has to be the BEST Star Trek yet.  And take it from someone who has 'em all, this is my favorite, hands down.",1464566400,,892,4.525

3468648,3,B001AVCFJM,"Chris Pine, Zoe Saldana, Bruce Greenwood, and Eric Bana suck in their roles, BIG TIME. But, the film is decent, mostly because of Leonard Nimoy, and the rest of the cast, and the story, but not necessarily the script. Spock and Uhura's romance is bad. A parallel universe storyline is awesome so they can do new adventures, instead of having to remake (copy) all the original adventures. Unfortunately, with the next film, Into Darkness(?) they did an awful, horrible remake of The Wrath Of Khan. So, I don't really understand why they chose a path to give them original adventures only to do a poor remake of Star Trek II. Thank god someone else is directing their third film Beyond, because it seems all J.J. Abrams can do is remakes. I guess he got lucky on this film, but Into Darkness and Star Wars VII are basically remakes. Not impressed by his directing and writing, AT ALL.",1461888000,,882,4.624203821656051

My husband and daughter are also Trekkies, and when we saw this for the first time, we pointed out several conflicting incidents that strayed from the original story lines.  Why would Abrams even do that.  In the last Into Darkness movie, I refused to see it, as the plot has gone away from the exploration nuance to the action beat 'em up, shoot 'em up, so immature.  Whereas the earlier Star Trek series and movies dealt with exploration, imaginative ideas of cultures and interesting future science, tJ. J. Abrams movies are very immature.

3468706,5,B001AVCFJM,"Let me state right off the bat that if you intend to watch this movie and have had any experience watching the original Star Trek series or movies, you must be willing to leave that universe behind.  If you don't you will have a very unpleasant experience watching this.  Of course, anyone young enough not to have ever gotten into the original series then you should be fine.

After watching this movie for the 2nd time I started to get into it as I didn't heed my own advice above the first time around.  Once you realize this movie has it's own storyline using only the barest details from the original series characters as a backdrop, you start to get into it as something fresh and new.

The one major complaint I have is the extreme over use of special effects.  This complaint doesn't stem from the old series having a severe lack of effects (mainly due to the technology not being available at that time.)  I love special effects in movies when they add to the story line and not having them would be a detriment to the entire movie.  However, there are many times during this movie that it appears that some writer just decided to add a flashing effects scene in rather than further the story along.",1456963200,,1208,4.459090909090909

3468717,2,B001AVCFJM,"J.J. Abrams has mastered the art of garnering the unfocused energy of science fiction film fans though visuals rather than content. Though he recent ""Force Awakens"" installment of Star Wars showed signs of improved style, this piece of Star Trek fan-fiction shows how much Abrams has had in common with Michael Bay. They prefer to engineer around battle sequences, and seem to place story and character development (even dialogue) into the afterthought section of their blockbuster-building methodology. Not much subtlety here. The story is grandiose without establishing many of the major plot points. The pace is rushed, and that is where most of these elements falter.
The sentimental ending is saccharine even with a Leonard Nimoy's presence, and from beginning to end the young crew has more in common with the characters in Paul Verhoeven's ""Starship Troopers"" than the old incarnations of Star Trek.",1456272000,4,906,5.298611111111111

3468788,3,B001AVCFJM,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this movie...

Star Trek (2009) is a reboot of the Star Trek franchise that began in 1979 with Star Trek: The Motion Picture.  J.J. Abrams is in the director's chair and clearly his goal was to liven up Star Trek by including faster and more intense action scenes.  The result is a movie that flirts with having more of a Star Wars feel to it than a Star Trek feel.  You will see things throughout the movie that look like they were pulled right out of the Star Wars movies and put into this movie.

In the Special Features there is a segment called A New Vision: The Production Secrets Behind The Film.  Here J.J. Abrams talks about how the Star Wars movies influenced him in the making of this Star Trek movie.  He mentions how the faster pacing of the Star Wars films is so much better and more appealing than the pacing of the Star Trek films, and he's absolutely right on this.  One thing I did not like at all about this movie was the shaking camera throughout much of the movie, and there is production footage showing J.J. Abrams himself vigorously slapping the side of the camera while shooting scenes in order to deliberately make the camera shake.  This is not only distracting to this viewer, but unnecessary as well.  I can see one or two scenes throughout the movie having this shaking effect, but not every single action scene!  Not only that, but even the stationary shots have shaky camerawork a lot of times.  Example: Two people are sitting down having a conversation and the camera is shaking, moving side to side, etc.  Give me a break!  Totally unnecessary and distracting!  I deducted one full star because of this shaky camera stuff.  J.J. Abrams also used the shaky camera technique in Star Wars Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015), but it was far less frequent and toned down quite a bit.  I think he wanted to limit the shaky camera in the Star Wars movie because he didn't want to deviate too much from how all six of the previous Star Wars movies were shot.  And what's with all the lens flares in this Star Trek movie??????  This is another source of major distraction!  And I'll bet most if not all of the seemingly HUNDREDS of lens flares are CGI lens flares.  Not even real.  A lens flare should be something that's accidental and unintentional.  Or, if it is intentional, it should be a REAL lens flare (as was the case in the original Psycho from 1960).

Leonard Nimoy (the original Mr. Spock) is in this movie.  Winona Ryder shows up as well.  The acting overall by everybody is OK, but nothing to brag about.  I found this movie overall to be more of a special effects display than a movie with a story of any substance.

This is the first Star Trek movie I've seen since seeing The Wrath Of Khan in the movie theater in 1984.  I think that shows how much fandom I have for Star Trek in general.  I'm not much of a fan at all, and seeing this 2009 movie just reinforces that fact even more.",1452384000,4,3021,4.4086799276672695

I encourage any other fans or supporters of Axanar to do the same.

3468903,5,B001AVCFJM,"Star Trek

 Trekkers (not Trekkies, please) all around the world are thanking their lucky galaxies this weekend.  The new movie is a wonderful thing, wonderful in the fullest and most antique sense, something that stuns and startles the viewer.  The space scenes are the most beautiful since the exploding star ships in Starship Troopers.
 The story takes us back to the academy days of Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty and the rest of the characters from the original series which first ran 43 years ago.  The players have successfully imagined what the teen age or young 20 something cadets would be like, with the elder versions to go by.  Englands Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) is dead on as the young engineer Scotty.  Other stand out are Karl Urban as Bones, the beautiful Zoe Saldana as Uhuru and John Cho as Sulu.
 Also look for Winona Ryder as Spocks mom and Jennifer Morrison of TVs House briefly as Kirks mom.  Leonard Nimoy returns as Spock Prime in a time twist.
 Chris Pine is absolutely spot on as the uninhibited-even snotty-, aggressive and brilliant young Kirk.  The casting agent should get an Oscar.
 Director/Producer J.J. Abrams (Mission Impossible III, the best one) has given us a nearly flawless movie with well developed characters and without slipping into cuteness or camp.  This is a big movie about heroes.
 Kirk is a hero.  A hero is the guy that gets beat down but gets back up.  Kirk spends a fair amount of time in the movie face down in his own blood.  But he gets back up again; he never, ever gives up.
 Industrial Light and Magic is back for this film.  They did the special effects for the very first Star Trek movie.
 This movie is rated PG-13 for space violence.  Star Trek gets an outstanding 4 and a half saw blades.",1443484800,,1754,4.590322580645161
3468904,5,B001AVCFJM,"I've been a fan of Star Trek ever since I was 4.  Seen every episode of every different show. I heard the complaints on this movie.  Get over it fellow purists. I get the whole black hole thing was unrealistic. I get the time travel issues. It's a show, not based in fact, it is entertainment after all. This movie is a fresh take on the original series. It is a DIFFERENT time line. That's why things are different. The future was altered. Comparing the Enterprise in this movie with the Enterprise of Kirk's time is ridiculous.
I for one applaud the movie, so do many if not most fans. Keep the movies coming.",1443484800,,611,4.350877192982456

3468965,2,B001AVCFJM,"I really wanted to like this reboot with Christopher Pine and Zachary Quinto. To be fair there are some good performances, especially Quinto, but it was annoying to watch Pines performance. It was uneven, over the top, pretentious and forced. The movie never really gets any traction and is bogged down on Kirk. The origins of the characters falls flat with bad child actors and worse dialogue and unbelievable plot. I couldn't even finish this stinker movie. Think it's more JJ Abrams (lacking)direction that bogs it down with maudlin cliches. The writers really  needed to think of something better than Romulans coming from the future to alter the past. Wow that's an idea that's never been done before. Just saying.",1439856000,2,719,4.991666666666666
3468966,1,B001AVCFJM,"The movie has countless plot holes and flaws.  It makes zero sense and deliberately dumps/rejects everything that Star Trek has been.

The cast is trying to imitate the characters from the original series, and failing completely.  Often they come across as knock offs, or as insults to original characters.  Kirk is a an over grown child.  Spock is EMOTIONAL.  Bones is almost unwilling to be in Star Fleet.  Uhura is Spock's girlfriend.  Scotty was outclassed in engineering by Old Spock.

Usually I hate agreeing with the Bad Guys, but this is an exception.  To quote Nero "" James T Kirk was considered to be a Great Man, but that was another life.""  The only reason this crew survived the movie is because Old Spock saved them.",1439769600,5,730,4.714285714285714

3468971,3,B001AVCFJM,"Somewhere inside this amiable bloated monster is a straightforward story that would fit neatly into a 50-minute TV episode.  It would look a bit like a brief ""Wrath of Khan,"" but it would be fine.  Unlike the original ""Khan,"" where Kirk and Kahn are the antagonists, here it's primarily Spock (Zachary Quinto) versus Nero (Eric Bana, tattooed), the crazed Romulan commander of a space ship that resembles a giant bug -- very far from the classic lines of a Federation starship.  Bana doesn't quite have the panache that Ricardo Montalban brought to Khan, but Quinto is a credible younger Spock.  Chris Pine, for his sins, is forced to play Kirk as a kind of frat-boy smart-ass, and it's difficult to believe that he would grow into the wry and witty Kirk of William Shatner -- but that how he's written, and so I don't blame Pine, who was good in ""Unstoppable.""  The cause of the bloat here is the attention paid to the young lives of Spock and Kirk, and their meeting and initial mutual dislike at Starfleet Academy.  I'm afraid that I couldn't get too interested in that -- it seemed to smack of a fairly predictable plot-formula in which two temperamentally different soldiers learn to respect and trust one another, and not all the paraphernalia about Starfleet rules and the Kobayashi Maru simulation could do much to spice it up.  I also found the young Kirk's apparent interest in young female cadets a bit tiresome -- the jock-frat boy stereotype again.

I have to say too that the plot device used to get Leonard Nimoy into the picture seemed very forced to me -- was it dumb luck that he happened to be on that icy planet when Kirk crashed there?  And how convenient that Scottie (Simon Pegg) was there too, to help effect transportation back to the Enterprise.  And how come that almost immediately Scottie is put in charge of the dilithium energy system for the ship?  Is it just so that he can say lines that are familiar from earlier shows -- ""Im not sure she can take any more, Captain!"" -- which chimes nicely with ""Live long and prosper,"" which is also trotted out a couple of times.  No -- it's all a bit too forced for me.  I liked ""The Wrath of Khan,"" and I liked ""The Voyage Home,"" the one with the whales, best of all.  This 2009 revival is all pace and no wit.  There was the revelation that Uhura had the hots for Spock, though.  I did not know that.",1439510400,3,2374,4.498834498834499

3468996,5,B001AVCFJM,"Star Trek was always a relief for me and I do remember the first ones. TV really wasn't the quality of entertainment or acting that we now expect now but during The Cold War and The Vietnam War we were not really looking forward to the future. I especially remember the air raid siren test at 1 o'clock the first Saturday of every month. As if we were to actually expect to one day be bombed. Star Trek went beyond all of that. We made it to the future. Yeah we were still in conflict but conflict was a part of nature itself. Part of the stars. Chris Pines,Leonard Nimoy and the rest did an excellent job of ushering us all into the future.",1438300800,,641,4.17741935483871

I really noticed the set lighting on the bridge which showed several details of the ships computer screens and graphics that I just can't remember noticing on the older Trek projects.  The movie seems brighter and fresh.  The characters are played beautifully.  The young Spock with this new crew gives a very interesting and believable insight into what's going on in this personality that sometimes struggles with his hybrid Human/Vulcan gene set; even Lt. Checkoff is portrayed very well as a fresh 17 year old straight out of the Academy.  Kirk and Bones and everyone are great-  Trek fans of the original productions won't miss anything with this new franchise.",1438214400,,842,4.719178082191781

Being a dedicated Trek Fan, I was very skeptical about Chris Pine playing Kirk.
Further I was concerned about restarting an already much repeated story line.
Finally, was it written well enough to capture the old Trek feeling.
My concerns were well covered.  Chris Pine plays Kirk in the same way that Shatner did.  Very well!
By providing an entry into a new time line, the new Trek covers the same span but in different reality.
It sounds complicated but it works.
And finally, the old Trek character interaction as there and just as well done as in the original.
Well written, well directed, and well acted.

By rebooting the series with a disruption of time, the creators can now do anything they want with the stories (enjoying the same great characters) without upsetting the ""purists"" who would have hated any mistreatment of the old story archs.  They make several references to that fact so that the audience understands that everything changed when Nero came through the rip in time.  From there it is warp speed in to a rediscovery of great characters with a now endless possibility of new stories.  As you can imagine, the effects are top of the line.

I got the single disc edition at my local used bookstore.  I was both interested in and
afraid of this reboot of this well-known franchise.  I grew up watching the films and
different television series and wondered if this would be a good movie.  The beginning
begins with a blast - literally - as a mysterious ship attacks the U.S.S. Kelvin.  Years
later, we see into the childhoods of both Kirk and Spock before meeting Uhura, McKoy and
Pike, who encourages Kirk to enter Starfleet where he makes a decision that gets him
suspended, but he is smuggled aboard the Enterprise, where they are attacked by a
ship called the Narada and its captain Nero, who seeks out Spock. . .

The special effects are awesome in the battle sequences.  It's great to see Uhura, Chekov,
Sulu, and Scotty get to have some action scenes!  Also it's heartwarming to see
Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime (since interference in the past causes the future to
change, making this an alternate reality thus preserving the original series)

Special features is Commentary, also a gag reel, and a behind the scenes with A
New Vision, and previews of other movies.  Must watch!",1433030400,,1179,4.566666666666666

3469160,1,B001AVCFJM,"Ordinarily I wouldn't bother to remark on garbage such as this Trek reboot is; however, now that I hear the great JJ A is hard at work screwing up the Star Wars franchise I feel the need to establish bona fides so that when it opens this December I will earn the right to declare ""I told you so!""

I dispense with the litany of crimes this Abrams guy commits -- the other reviewers have covered that territory quite thoroughly. I will just mention that the DVD commentary contains a number of interesting tidbits that shed light on why this ""reboot"" turned out so horribly. For one, Abrams openly admits in so many words that his purpose was to Star Wars-ify the Trek storyline and presentation; that is, to dumb it down for a general audience (teenagers) and to speed the pace. He succeeds all too much. The only problem is that the goal is grossly misguided. This story and the characters are no longer Star Trek.

Another interesting admission of Abrams' is that he didn't (and still doesn't) know or even care what the letters N-C-C in NCC-1701 stand for! He states this in the commentary with a haughty air of prideful ignorance. How can a director/producer who cares so little for the canon of a loved series be expected to produce a new installment faithful to the original ?

One thing to illustrate just how little this ""artist"" thinks of his audience: when Spock is first introduced, he is depicted chanting ""scientific"" facts as if in prayer. One I remember distinctly was ""the square root of four is two"". Now, this is something I probably learned in the third grade, and I expect it's true for just about everyone that you don't have to think very hard to figure it out. But this Vulcan recites ""scientific"" prattle like this as if it's a profundity. Why? I expect that we need to see Spock like this to understand that Vulcans are logical and Spock in particular is one bitchin' smart alien dude. But the square root of a single-digit perfect square ??? (if Spock were REALLY that smart JJ would have had him say ""plus or minus two"") No examples of intelligent thought or action are presented -- it's just a chant of facts. Just one example of endless stream of garbage strung together to make this ""movie"".

I am ashamed that the late Leonard Nimoy participated in the production of this tripe. He must have really needed the money.

When the new Star Wars comes out in December remember that I warned you here first.",1430697600,8,2432,4.556064073226545

Dr. McCoy in particular IS McCoy.  Good story, good acting. Pick a rainy day and rent this one, then the second one which is free under Prime video.  They're worth watching in sequence.

3469224,4,B001AVCFJM,"Kind of silly, with plot holes you could drive a starship through, and some pretty massive clichs, but a thoroughly enjoyable movie true to the spirit of the Star Trek franchise.

The best moment of the film was in the last scene where Chis Pine's Kirk took over the bridge of the Enterprise for the first time as the real captain, and Pine threw out a perfectly-crafted Shatner swagger on his way to The Chair. Also, it was very nice to see the brilliant Leonard Nimoy do his penultimate (I think) appearance in the pointy ears.

Great effects, lots of explosions and (red shirt) crew members spiraling to certain death in outer space, countless call-backs to the original series, and a really appealing cast make this a movie well worth watching, probably more than once.",1427500800,4,773,4.718518518518518

The TV show and other movies have us coming on board the Enterprise and meeting her crew after they have been together for a while. We learn to love them and care about all the trials and travails they encounter.

But, where did they all come from? How did they grow up? What was their path they followed to get to the Starship Enterprise? That is what this movie is about as well as showing us the length of work that a crew must go through to survive and overcome all obstacles.

Learn how Spock and Kirk came to know each other and see the conflict that started their relationship.

3469307,4,B001AVCFJM,"I found a lot to enjoy with this alternate-universe reboot, but some things about this movie left me cold.

I liked that the ships were much more mobile and dynamic, and I love that in the DVD extras, JJ went out of his way to credit this to the original Star Wars trilogy. He named each of the 3 original Star Wars movies. I was loving that, because I could just picture all the supposed hard core ""trekkies"" or ""trekkers"" fuming and gritting their teeth. I think it is silly to become a fanboy or fangirl, irrationally aligning yourself with one franchise and automatically dismissing anything from the other. I myself enjoyed all of the Star Trek tv series, (except Deep Space 9) and I have paid to see all of the movies, even the ones that really stunk, but, I also have enjoyed all of the Star Wars movies, even the prequels. You have to give credit where credit is due. The new images in this Star Trek movie of the starships going to warp speed look quite similar to Star Wars ships jumping into hyperspace. There is even an interior shot from the bridge of the Enterprise going to warp, The stars elongate, just like Star Wars was doing back in 1977. Pike even says ""punch it."" Where have I heard that before? Oh, that's right, from Han Solo! Once the Enterprise arrived at Vulcan, we see that the ship can actually maneuver, avoiding the wreckage of other ships, and later on, it fights more like a fighter, with maneuvering, banking and rapid fire, rather than an immobile submarine firing one phaser shot or one torpedo at a time. Credit all of this to JJ's love of Star Wars, and for me, it made Star Trek a lot more enjoyable. And allow me to also say that being a slave to one franchise only is ridiculous. I like Star Wars AND Star Trek, I like Ford and Chevy, I like Pepsi and Coke. Who says it has to be one or the other? Enjoy them both!

I also noticed something that gives me great hope for Star Wars Episode 7. The interior of the Enterprise looks amazing, especially the detail in the engine room. In the DVD extras, you see that a lot of that was real, not green screen.

What I didn't like was that is was obvious that the writers of this movie have no clue as to how the military functions. First, Jim Kirk just rides his bike onto a military installation, no ID checks or anything, walks on to a recruit transport, and sits down, no questions asked. Anyone who has ever joined the military can attest that it's not that simple. There are background checks, aptitude tests, psychological tests, physical and medical tests before you are accepted. Just try casually waltzing in to your local military installation and walking on to a bus full of military recruits, see what happens. And then, Cadet Kirk with his long history of insubordination and cheating (and fighting, no doubt) goes from being court martialed, smuggled on to the Enterprise and literally thrown off, to being declared Captain of the ship, after one mission, leapfrogging over all of the far more experienced and qualified officers ahead of him. He just skips right over the ranks of Ensign, Lieutenant, and Commander, and goes from Cadet to Captain, just like that. That had me rolling my eyes and saying ""oh please."" In the military, even a highly honored Medal of Honor recipient does not get bumped from Lieutenant to General. Still, Star Trek is hardly the first movie to demonstrate that the writers have little understanding of the military.

Overall, I think this was a successful, if not perfect addition to the Star Trek movie collection. But someone needs to tell JJ to stop with the lens flares. I hope he reigns that in with Star Wars Episode 7.",1425254400,,3653,4.53030303030303

The writers make use of the theory of parallel universes to speculate that at one moment in time Kirk's life could have gone one of two ways, or indeed multiple ways, but we are taken back to the start of the story and discover a young Kirk and find him at college. The writers are essential resetting the clock, we are not seeing the youth of the Kirk we already know  but a young man who will grow up in a parallel universe, the same man but through one event leads a different life.

For those unfamiliar with Star Trek, this flick is full of action and excitement, tension and humor, with great special effects. For those who have followed ST for any length of time, being able to go back and see a young and overly-exhuberrant James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine) defying his first orders is classic; watching the younger Spock (Zachary Quinto) truly struggle between his human/Vulcan mixture is fabulous; and on and on with other younger characters: McCoy (Karl Urban), Scotty (Simon Pegg), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin). And Eric Bana portrayed a very good Romulan villain, Nero. It was great to see Leonard Nimoy actually take part in the adventure as a much older Spock. Then there were cameos by Chris Hemsworth, Rachel Nichols, among others. The story had some flaws, sure, but almost all movies suffer from that.

3469412,2,B001AVCFJM,"Really felty disconnected from the cannonicity of the original Trek series and the films. This just didn't feel right with too much lens flare and an over-abundance of CGI effects. The music wasn't bad, but it only just worked for the film, and really wasn't of the Jerry Goldsmith level of excellence as you'd get in some of the other Trek films. As for the acting it wasn't bad - they cast a decent bunch of people, with the exception of Chris Pine, who seems more like a Beverly Hills 90210 extra than a Shatner-sized character.
Most bothersome to me, in a nerdy sense, was how the events of this film seem to take a big, muddly boot-stomp on the established events of the past films, namely if planet Vulcan was destroyed, then a good number of events from the third and fourth Trek films never actually could take place. I just watched these again recently and, although flawed, remain beloved parts of my childhood and, much like Lucas destroying the galaxy far, far away with the prequels, it felt like something similar happened here as well with that established Trek mythos essentially blown away in disregard (so now Sulu never manually pilots a bird of prey to land on the planet Vulcan to help restore Spock to his mind again? None of that ever happens, because the planet was destroyed in this film? Etc.) Goofing up things with time travel was just stupid, and the Khan stuff in the second film made even less sense.
Sure, it's a fine, mindless action film, but it's annoying that they had to trash the established history in order to do it.",1421452800,,1556,4.580645161290323

It is so good to be back among good Sci-Fi like found with Star Trek.  Lots of action kept the whole family engaged.  It fills in background information about several key Star Trek characters.  This movie was perfect for just a fun time... oh, there was one problem.  We sometimes stop about 1/2 way through a movie to make some popcorn for the family.  We...uh... were so engaged with this movie that we forgot to stop until the credits started to roll.  Made for a late night, but it was sure fun talking about the movie and eating popcorn after it was all done!  I guess that wasn't a horrible problem after all.",1420416000,,767,4.421428571428572

3469439,3,B001AVCFJM,"I was wondering how they managed to get the whole crew together when that wasn't the original canon. The time travel/changing the past thing was a bit of a cheap trick to reboot the franchise.
Taken as a movie using the original characters that I love with a new spin and completely re-writing their history and the history of the Federation as we know it, hence the history of the Universe as we know it. t was a good movie and I enjoyed it very much. I was shocked to see the creation of a romance between Uhura and Spock, though. That *really* stretched it for me.",1420329600,,567,4.308411214953271

3469522,5,B001AVCFJM,"Now, I'm not very well versed in star trek story or history so Im not going to pretend to be.  I've heard some people who are star trek fans say that they didn't like this movie because it either A.) Didn't follow the original story of the TV series or movies, or B.) Isn't a very good story, or C.) It's too hollywood. If you're mildly interested in the story of star trek or sci-fi in general, you should like this movie.  The story is cool and pretty well written, (the time travel parts are a bit dodgy if you over-think it.), the effects are pretty amazing, and I think the casting is very good (even though I don't have a vast amount of knowledge of the original characters).  As a standalone star trek scifi action movie, it is very good.",1417392000,,745,4.2695035460992905

If you are a die hard trekkie then you may find difficulty with some of the details such as Kirk driving a car as a child when in ""A Piece of the Action"" episode he says he had never driven one, but if you can let all that go and enjoy the movie for what it is...then it is a great ride!

A guy can't go out on his first mission and be an effective captain. My time in the Navy taught me that. This was also a great violation of all laws of physics. Black holes are not 2D. A starship travels back in time and rather than solve the future disaster before anything can happen they sit and wait for a couple of decades to get revenge on someone? No one is that stupid. A planet being sucked into a singularity and a planetary body being close enough to see with the naked eye, how is it not being affected? Where does that actually function in reality? Now they can beam across distant systems and even onto a starship that is traveling much faster than the speed of light? What? Who comes up with this stuff?

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Rebooting old film franchises, especially sci-fi films is all the rage in Hollywood these days. When a once-popular film series starts to lose its lustre and outlive its usefulness, the time may come to hit the Reset button and start over fresh. This strategy worked wonders for both Batman and James Bond. Superman really could have benefited from the same, but unfortunately the non-reboot quasi-sequel we got instead disappointed on many levels. Still stinging from that one, the studio behind it is currently discussing the reboot option for its next attempt.

But when is a reboot not really a reboot? Is it possible for a movie to be a linear sequel, a prequel, and also a reboot all at the same time? That's the conundrum posed by the newly-revamped 'STAR TREK.' The title alone boldly declares its intentions. This isn't 'STAR TREK XI'. It's just 'STAR TREK' full stop. Start over. Reboot. And yet, it's also not. Can a film have it both ways? In this case, amazingly, yes.

Truth be told, it took a lot of cajoling on Paramount Pictures part to even contemplate the prospect of rebooting its venerable 'STAR TREK' franchise. Undeniably, 'Trek' was on pretty shaky ground in recent years. The last sci-fi film, 'NEMESIS,' was its first outright box office bomb. And the most recent TV series, 'Enterprise', was cancelled due to poor ratings. Nevertheless, 'STAR TREK' still boasts an enormous and famously ill-tempered fan base that doesn't take easily to change or to disruptions in the series' labyrinthine canon, and starting over. Could any film manage the near-impossible task of appeasing old fans while attracting new ones? That was the challenge laid out for director J.J. Abrams and his writers. The solution they came up with is really quite ingenious.

Plans for a prequel film that would revisit younger versions of the ""Original Crew"" characters James T. Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and others during their Starfleet Academy days had been in discussions at least as far back as 1990. For various reasons, the project was scrapped. For their reboot, J.J. Abrams and company decided to revive that concept, but also cleverly tied it to the original continuity via the convenient excuse of time travel. In the new story, a villainous Romulan named Nero [Eric Bana] from the 'Next Generation' era has travelled back in time to the early 23rd Century and set in motion a chain of events that will change history and directly affect the life of young James T. Kirk. Thus, all of the events of the 'Star Trek' that fans have followed for four decades still happened, while this new sci-fi film creates an alternate, parallel timeline. ""Whatever our lives might have been, if the time continuum was disrupted, our destinies have changed,"" Spock explains. This avoids the pitfalls of a typical prequel, in which the fates of all the characters are already set in stone. Anything can happen in this new timeline. The entire history of 'Star Trek' has just shot off in another direction.

The opening scene sets the tone. From out of nowhere, the Federation Starship U.S.S. Kelvin is set upon and attacked by a gigantic Romulan vessel of superior technology. The ship's captain is taken prisoner and executed, leaving First Officer George Kirk in command. Meanwhile, George Kirk's pregnant wife is in the throes of labour on a lower deck. This culminates in a huge battle simultaneous with the birth of their son James. The scene is epic in scope, operatic in emotions, and immediately declares the sci-fi film's agenda to wilfully break with 'STAR TREK tradition, because it is utterly fantastic. From that point, the film jumps ahead to show the rebellious James T. Kirks youth in Iowa and enlistment in Starfleet Academy, where he meets important characters such as McCoy, Spock, and Uhura. Eventually, he winds up on the bridge of the U.S.S. Enterprise right as Nero returns to launch the second phase of his diabolical plan. Naturally, out of all of Starfleet, only our crew of fresh-faced cadets will have what it takes to oppose this threat.

In a project like this, casting is critical. If the audience can't believe that these young actors are portraying the iconic characters they've known and loved for decades, the entire film will fall apart. It's in this regard that J.J. Abrams takes his biggest risk and scores his greatest coup and I don't know where the director found Chris Pine, but it was a really smart decision and Chris Pine makes a conscious decision to avoid any overt William Shatner impressions, which would almost certainly come across as terribly corny. And yet, without at all seeming like William Shatner, he very much embodies all the characteristics of James T. Kirk and his charisma and his cockiness, his smug self-satisfaction and his irresistible magnetism, his hot-headed temper and brilliant tactical mind. If Chris Pine's performance had at all missed the mark, he could have derailed the movie. Somehow, it just works. When I first heard that Karl Urban, the tough-guy villain from 'The Chronicles of Riddick' and 'The Bourne Supremacy, had been cast as Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, I couldn't imagine how he'd pull it off and I'm glad to say that I was completely mistaken and Karl Urban absolutely nails the character's acerbic wit and homespun charm. He couldn't possibly be better.

This new 'Star Trek' is almost all about the action. It is mostly well-plotted and has excellent character development, but lacks the philosophical depth of the best 'STAR TREK' outings. The film does the seemingly impossible and it makes 'STAR TREK' a great deal of fun and relevant again in the 21st Century. Paramount Pictures big gamble paid off. The sci-fi film was a huge box office hit and the biggest in the STAR TREK franchise's history. Unlike some of 2009's other big money-makers, it scored widespread praise from both critics and audiences. And of course the sequel STAR TREK: Into Darkness in 3-D which has now been released and will be reviewing this also. Let's just hope that the franchise series can keep up the momentum for many years to come.

Blu-ray Video Quality  As if there had been any reason to doubt, 'STAR TREK' looks totally brilliant on Blu-ray. Personally, I think it looks better than several other recent high-profile releases. Some viewers may take issue with the director's overuse of lens flares shining directly into the camera, but there's little denying that the 1080p transfer captures all of his stylistic affectations just as he'd want them. Likewise, a number of close-ups on the Enterprise Bridge were shot with wide-angle lenses and appear slightly stretched. That's not a transfer flaw. It was evident in cinemas as well. For the most part, the 2.40:1 image is very sharp and detailed. Many close-ups are amazingly vibrant. However, in certain parts of the movie, especially during the first half, shots with visual effects seem slightly less detailed than those without. This probably has to do with the resolution at which they were rendered and composited. It's never a dramatic drop-off, but is somewhat noticeable on a large screen. That problem works itself out as the film goes along. By the last hour, just about everything looks virtually flawless. The picture has vivid colours and great contrast throughout. The black of space is suitably inky, yet shadow detail is well defined. A little bit of film grain is apparent and appears unprocessed. 'Star Trek' is a good-looking movie that will make terrific home theatre eye candy, even on large projection screens. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  I've been watching a lot of high-octane action and sci-fi pictures lately, the type of sci-fi films where loudness is valued as the most important aspect of sound design, and deafening cacophonies are used to bludgeon the audiences' senses. I'd seen 'STAR TREK' in the cinema and knew it to be another action-packed sci-fi film. Firing it up via my home theatre set-up, I set my expectations and my Pioneer A/V Receiver's volume accordingly. Listening in the home environment, what struck me the most about this soundtrack is just how well balanced it is. The mix certainly has plenty of dynamic range, but never does the dialogue sound suppressed in comparison to overly-loud music or sound effects. All of the levels are appropriate, not obnoxious. The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack features bold and brassy music that swells up very nicely. Directional effects and bass rumble are smoothly integrated. Sound effects like the phasers are crisply recorded. Listen closely, and you'll also hear plenty of classic 'STAR TREK' noises and effects subtly integrated into the soundscape. The action scenes build up to tremendous power. The surround channels buzz with excitement, and the subwoofer gets a workout as well. This is just a brilliant soundtrack all round.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by J.J. Abrams, Bryan Burk, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelot and Robert Orci: Director J.J. Abrams, producers Bryan Burk & Damon Lindelof, and writers Alex Kurtzman & Roberto Orci and all recorded together and have a great rapport in this fast-paced, information-packed commentary. Among the topics discussed is the script development of the STAR TREK film and the continuity, last-minute editorial changes, and tailoring the sci-fi film to appeal to women. This is a consistently interesting and a very engaging audio commentary track.

Special Feature: BD-Live Feature: NASA News: With this feature, viewers may access an RSS news feed from the NASA web site.

Finally, this brilliant 'STAR TREK' reboot accomplishes the nearly-impossible task of resetting the dial on a widely-beloved franchise that was clearly past its prime, while both respecting old fans and inviting new ones. If not a perfect film by any means, it's a tremendous amount of fun. The Blu-ray excels in every area, from video and audio, but sadly with this Region B/2 Blu-ray the supplements are far too sparse, compared to the Region A/1 Blu-ray disc 'STAR TREK.' But despite this, it is still a fantastic Blu-ray disc and I have viewed it several times and I still get excited watching it, as there is so much going on, you miss stuff and it has now gone pride of place in my START TREK Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

3469678,5,B001AVCFJM,"In this 2009 reboot of Star Trek, writer and director J.J. Abrams (of Cloverfeld fame) aims to breathe life into a flagging franchise.

Star Trek seemed to do remarkably well as a science fiction culture icon - turning from a low-budget television series in the 1960's to a massive billion dollar cult phenomenon by the 1990s, with a dozen or so successful movies, four television series, and countless books, media, computer games and a huge fan base.

Yet by the early 2000's it was clear the franchise was tired and running out of steam - the last TNG movie was a commercial flop, and no major new series was in the pipeline after the early cancellation of 'Enterprise.'  Clearly new ideas were needed to communicate to a newer generation raised on social media, fast-paced 24 hour news and broadband internet, and with shorter-attention spans.

The new movie by Abrams managed to do an excellent job at that and more.  A lot of unhappy reviewers have criticised the movie on a range of grounds, from bad acting to plot holes to science howlers.  Yet the original series (on which the movie is clearly based) contained these in abundance, from the cheap sets to the laughable toy spaceships to the monsters in rubber suits (not even William Shatner could salvage the 'fight' with the Gorn).  What always made Star Trek great was its ability to get around this with a mixture of fast-paced action, good entertainment and plausible and sometimes interesting storylines.  Astronomer Phil Plait castigated the abundant science mistakes (from a galaxy-destroying supernova to the silly red matter plotline, to the ability of Spock to see a planet light years away) but enjoyed the movie, and that is the point.

J.J. Abrams is effective at capturing the spirit of the original series and rightly made the new movie a kind of expanded version of a TOS episode, and the casting was done in just the right way.  Pine is convincing as a young, impulsive Kirk who can't follow rules, Urban gets it right as 'Bones McCoy',  Quinto does a good job as the young Spock conflicted with emotions, and Zoe Saldana is well cast as a young and sexy Uhura.  Eric Bana is not really a convincing supervillain but does well enough to make the film enjoyable.

Overall the movie has the right balance between fun and action, suspense and drama, character and plot, and despite many flaws, is a great reboot provided you don't take it too seriously (which is always the approach you should take to Trek to begin with).",1410393600,,2497,4.765661252900232

Therefore, the ENTIRE Star Trek timeline is altered (aka screwed up).

3469729,5,B001AVCFJM,"Star Trek 2009 started in the distant future with an explosion in the Romulan empire. Some background on that background is actually contained in a few comic books that do a good job of summarizing that future that ended with Spock and Nero traveling backward in time, ultimately changing the past which changed the future.

They don't tell us in the 2009 reboot how the universe managed to reorganize itself in a matter of less than a century (more like 25 years) but I have my theory, and there are many other theories. If you have a theory different than mine, add a comment at the end of this review.

Do you remember the TOS episode where McCoy accidentally overdosed himself, traveled back in time, changing time? Kirk had to allow his newest love interest to die, in order to restore the spirit. That device they passed through was the Guardian of Forever, and near the end of the episode, the Guardian told them that the present had been restored to what it should have been.

I really enjoy the new reboot of the old original Star Trek, and the producers did it in such a way that I totally believe it.

More than a century in the future, Spock tries to save the Romulan homeworld, but fails, and Nero blames him. They both get trapped in a wormhole that takes Nero's advanced ship back to the day of James Kirk's birth, and his actions change history.

We don't hear anything but hints, but I believe the Guardian of Forever (remember that stone ring that McCoy went through when he was drunk?) is manipulating time so that Kirk and his crew can come together years earlier than they did in the first reality.

In addition to highly recommending the movie to all Trekkies everywhere, and to new viewers who can fall in love with it all over again, I also highly recommend the book. It is wonderful, and helps us understand some of the plot with additional details that did not fit into the movie.

I didn't catch who the prize beagle was until I read the book. Admiral Archer's prize beagle? Remember ""Star Trek Enterprise?"" Captain Archer had his beagle on board the Enterprise with him. In the book, the beagle appears in one of the corridors of the enterprise at the end of the book. I wish they had included that in the movie.

I have watched this movie six or eight times so far, and will watch it multiple times more.",1408752000,,2333,4.485849056603773

3469734,4,B001AVCFJM,"My dad is a ""Treky"", so I grew up with the original series. Honestly, I really liked this take on the story! This movie has some.... er, dumb? parts to it. Yeah, I know, it's to spice up the plot a bit... but Spock and Uhura? Really? Kinda threw me for a loop.
The acting and roles held in the movie? I really found them pretty ""realistic"" to the 60-70's series! Really made it that much more enjoyable, seeing all of the ""gang"" interact so closely to how I've grown up watching them. I'm not the biggest fanatic out there, but I could guess some of the characters prior to being introduced, and it really just fit well together.
Last words, again I really enjoyed it! Gonna go watch ""Into Darkness"" now. (Grew up watching the original movies too, go figure :) )",1408579200,,762,4.335664335664336

3469744,5,B001AVCFJM,"I bought this on DVD when it first came out, having been a Star Trek fan since my youth.  One of the joys of the original series was its inherent low-budget cheesiness, which is certainly lacking in this high-budget remake, but I think the modern version works quite well.  I won't get into the storyline here, that's been covered in other reviews.  I do think that the actors chosen for the classic roles did an excellent job with their characters.  And while Pine as Kirk and Quinto as Spock seem to get all the press, I really enjoy Karl Urban as McCoy - he steals every scene he's in.

When my DVD copy got scratched somehow I went out and got the blu-ray.  It is amazingly crisp and clear, and the quality is excellent.  Glad to have it and will watch it many times.",1408320000,,771,4.3125

3469856,4,B001AVCFJM,"This movie does not have any of the ""original"" characters (except the real Spock at the end), so you had others playing Kirk, Spock, Bones, etc.  The plot is weak, flimsy, and confusing.  Some of the advanced technology doesn't make a lot of sense, and some of the fight scenes on the ships are pretty lame.  At one point Kirk is literally thrown off the ship, and 15 minutes later he becomes captain due to a series of unrealistic events, big time.  That said, the movie is mildly entertaining, and the bad guy with all his tattoos seems bent with revenge enough (his whole planet was destroyed, but he is irrational in his blame).  If you don't expect miracles, and just want a mildly enjoyable film, this may be the film to see, especially if you really like the star trek genre.",1404950400,,782,4.47887323943662

Now that I've seen it, I see my mistake.  It was very entertaining.  I'm not sure I get Spock and Uhura, but whatever.  I guess they had to throw a sexual relationship in there.  I remember the Kobiashi thing from the old Star Trek so that was interesting.  It was a good movie.  Cool to see Mr. Nimoy in it. Not sure that part of the story was fleshed out enough but it was a neat twist and a good way to relaunch the whole thing so you don't feel like you've seen it all before.

Now, this last time I watched it with my kids...and it's suddenly very violent.  Probably not the best for a 9 year old.  There's enough great Trek lore to make it a joy for those of us born in the '70s or so and know the older series.

3469880,3,B001AVCFJM,"As a diehard fan of Star Trek have seen every episode from the original and every new addition to this particular style of films I found it interesting. The actors are good, but the plot lacks the lessons often given through the story line. Lots of explosions and action, a love story between two of the original characters that wasn't in the original Star Trek but was a new and imaginative take on a story told many years ago.  My husband and I watched it together and both of us enjoyed it so would make a decent date night film to view.  But not what I was expecting, but also knew a remake would never be as good as the original.  Is like copying something the copy is just not as good as the original.  Not a waste of time and watched all of the new Star Trek movies in one evening (had a movie marathon and Star Trek was the theme).  But as a diehard trekie if you are looking for well loved characters brought to life you are in for a disappointment.  Try to keep an open mind when watching it and allow the story to take you where it will.  A decent way to bring a new generation to an old favorite series.",1404086400,2,1115,4.1342592592592595

3469886,5,B001AVCFJM,"What can I say... I'm a Trekkie.  I was raised on the Original Series by my dad, watched TNG growing up as well, and then transitioned to Deep Space Nine and Voyager.  I will admit that The Next Generation is my favorite of the TV Series, but that's mostly because I loved the characters and how (for the most part) is was more strategic and thoughtful then the brawls that Kirk always found himself in.  Also, I'm not a huge Shatner fan.... don't hate me!

When I heard that new Star Trek movies were coming out, I was hesitant.  You'll notice that I didn't mention the show ""Enterprise"" above... yeah, I gave up on that one after a single episode.  So I was frightened of the renewal of the Star Trek franchise ruining the memories I had of growing up with Kirk, McCoy, Sulu, Spock, and the rest of the crew.  When I actually went to see the movie... I was surprised! I loved it!  I thought they made really smart choices with the cast, and Chris Pine is Kirk without being as overbearing as Shatner was... he still has an ego, but he wouldn't be Kirk without one.

So I was very happy with this movie, and very happy to purchase the Blu-ray version of it.  So now, once my hubby & I have finished our current TNG marathon, we can curl up and watch a wonderful new adaptation of Star Trek.",1403481600,,1291,4.275720164609053

My father was a die hard science fiction fan and we were allowed to stay up to watch Star Trek with him. For those of us who grew up with the original Star Trek series and movies this is a nice look at the younger lives of the main characters.  The actors must have researched the behaviors of the original stars.  The younger versions do a great job of some of the facial expressions. Chris Pine does an excellent job reenacting William Shatner's look of pain & surprise when he takes a punch.  I've seen some of the reviews by critics, and seriously - so what if there are a few comments about your blood boiling even if it isn't possible.  Judge the movie for how much you personally enjoy it and forget the professional critics' opinions.
  SPOILER AHEAD:  If you are wondering how the first and second newer movies will affect the original series, this first movie solves those questions with a time travel element effectively altering what might have occurred in the older series and movies. I don't want to spoil everything.
I absolutely enjoyed this movie and have watched it several times.  I love the younger versions of the characters.  You'll get a real kick out of Scotty.  I also watched the second movie, Into Darkness, several times.  I look forward to another in the future.",1403049600,,1391,4.560483870967742

After some trepidation about what this incarnation of the genre would bring, I was very pleasantly surprised.

I think the film took the original 1960s ST concept and updated it with modern production values and special effects.  The 1960's James T. Kirk would immediately recognize the crew and the story line in this incarnation, and settle into the Captain's seat without missing a beat.

The story line was pleasantly predictable in a swashbuckling Star Trek manner, with enough plot twists and side trips to keep it interesting, and the cameo appearances from ST's veterans from ""back when"" were a nice touchstone.
The casting was excellent, and the film stood up well against the inevitable comparisons with ""the real thing"".

This movie simply makes me happy. The young characters are spot-on - played with attention to detail and a genuine affection that makes me warm inside.

Honestly, I took my stepson to the movie theater to see this movie just thinking that it would be loaded with neat special effects and relatively free of offensive language/gore/adult themes.  I didn't expect to like the movie myself.  However, even as a fan of the original I found myself really liking the way they worked the ""reboot"" in.  As I stated originally, I'm not a fan of reboots, but I think this one was really pretty good.  I bought the dvd and I've watched it several times at home already.  If you are a fan of the series, I'd say just try to keep an open mind - I really think it's pretty good and the new actors have all done a pretty impressive job.

3469916,4,B001AVCFJM,"I was very pleased with this movie.  Primarily because they stayed true to the original characters, so many other ""remakes"" have totally changed the characters and lost what you loved about them in the first place, but this movie did not do that, and felt it really did justice to the originals.  -- Which of course is no small feat.

3469920,4,B001AVCFJM,"This is a re-boot of the series that attempts to be an alternate timeline. As an action movie, it is pretty engaging and fun to watch. The production quality is good and some of the characters are interesting, albeit somewhat different than their predecessors in the original series. The idea behind the movie is that a Romulan ship has traveled back in time to get revenge on the federation after the federation was unable to save Romulus from a supernova in the future. The most jarring thing about the movie is the destruction of the planet Vulcan which opens up future plot possibilities but is very jarring. The major complaint I have about the movie is the changes. Romulans don't look like Romulans, federation starships look only vaguely similar to starships, some of the technology is different and some of the characters don't seem like their predecessors. There are whole webpages about scientific mistakes and plot holes, but for me the problem is that the look of too many things was changed. The movie is a great action movie, but it pretty much kills off Star Trek as it previously existed.",1402099200,2,1105,4.790575916230367

Wrong!  Couldn't have been more delighted with it.  Though the characters are, in some ways, updated - they're nonetheless true to what we old-timers held dear about the originals.  Changes have been made - but the well written and very cleverly worked story line allows for that.  I can't believe the changes I accepted without a grumble - but you can't argue with something this well done.

This is a high action, fun filled trek into space with the well known, well loved crew of the Starship Enterprise - reborn for the 21st century.  Old Trekker or new sci-fi buff, you're gonna love it!",1401235200,,794,4.751824817518248

3469942,4,B001AVCFJM,"OK, I say this as the ignorant non-Trekkie, in case that matters to you.

It wasn't perfect, and parts of the plot were a little tough to follow. I had to pause it and watch it with subtitles to make sure, which really shouldn't happen. But the main relationship between Kirk and Spock was good, and the whole thing was super fun. There were some great co-star performances too, who made the most of the little screen-time they had. Short and effective. There were some particular twists to the plot that I appreciated. I didn't see them coming, and I'm a writer myself. It was the kind of thing once they happened, to say ""Oh! Of course it wasn't going to be that simple."" Torture those characters! Make them struggle! Too many writers are afraid to do that these days.",1401235200,,770,4.5

Rebelling against authority as a youth is a forced attempt to show repressed anger at the Federation for the heroic death of his father.

3469950,2,B001AVCFJM,"The film relied almost entirely of our previous knowledge of the first Star Trek series of the 1960's. As a result, there was no character development written into the script. It relied on tired cliches and character catch phrases. There was an emphasis put on old fashioned fist fight brawls, featuring Kirk being punched in the face regularly.
Kirk's meteoric rise to command was unbelievable even for a science fiction film. Seriously, a bar brawling cadet that has not finished Star Fleet training being placed in full command over his professor Spock and a major vessel? I just couldn't buy it. I was intrigued by the Spock love affair but felt that was mere novelty that was undeveloped and illogical.
In short, the plot was thin veiled inception knock off, with little character development, empty dialog and gross over reliance on fight violence in lieu of substance.

3469961,2,B001AVCFJM,"This entire reboot has far too many flaws to be anything other than an action ripoff of the original Star Trek.

The Good:
1.  The cast works well together and puts in outstanding performances in their roles.
2.  The premise, although maybe a bit odd, fits well enough and justifies a solid reboot.
3.  Finally, alternate Kirk starts showing some of the mental and moral characteristics developed by the original after FIFTEEN years of service in Starfleet, many times being recognized as a (or the) key officer in critical situations.
4.  Well, given some of the issues I note below, it really does make sense that some Star Fleet Admiral would revive Khan, use him to design and build a super high tech starship to ""militarize"" Star Fleet and try to provoke a war with the Klingons.

The Bad:
1.  Somehow, all of the cast are basically the same age, so we have Kirk (b. 2233), Scotty (b. 2222), McCoy (b. 2227), Sulu (b. 2237), Uhura (b. 2230s), and Chekov (b. 2245) and only McCoy and Chekov (although he looks much older than his actual age of thirteen(!) years old) have some relation to their age compared to Kirk while Scotty, the oldest of the crew, looks younger than Kirk.  In fact, we have Chekov on the Enterprise....five years before the original entered Star Fleet Academy.
2.  Alternate Kirk enters the Academy on 2255 (implied), the same year original Kirk was promoted from Ensign to LT, having completed the Academy years several years earlier.  In fact, the original Kirk had already held several commands by the time of the Vulcan incident in 2258 in the alternate timeline.  In the meantime alternate Scotty gets in trouble and is exiled to an ice planet for years (if you count them, probably more like a decade or so) and like alternate Kirk misses the majority of the maturation, seasoning and experience that turned the original crew of the Enterprise into an elite group.

The Ugly:
1.  Star Fleet senior officers run their ships like personal fiefdoms, allowing Academy Cadets(!!) to be given senior officer slots at whim...and somehow there are no senior officers around to fill these slots, which would have resulted in officers like Captain Pike being relieved of duty for promoting young, untried and unprofessional Cadets to command over such senior officers.  Except for Spock, there only seem to be three ranks at Starfleet: Admiral, Captain and Cadet.
2.  The alternate Enterprise's engine room.  I mean seriously.  It is built like a massive factory and there are so many levels and so much (mostly empty) cubic footage, that after you add a bridge, a sick bay and some corridors, there probably isn't any room left for crew quarters.
3.  Face it, alternate Kirk is now and always shall be (at least for the next 12-13 years) a punk kid thug who hasn't been in the diplomatic, military or command situations that made the original Kirk a solid fit for the Enterprise when he took command seven years after (for a total of twelve more years experience) than the alternate Kirk.",1400371200,,3012,4.770712909441233

So I think this is an alternate universe, with all the characters we love, young.  I also think that to be in two places at once would be impossible otherwise.

3469971,2,B001AVCFJM,"Basically, it was like cardboard cutouts of the original characters, like the cartoons on South Park, trying to do caricatures and mannerisms but missing the main point of why we liked the tv versions.  I never watched much of the old films, but I suspect I'd like them better than this.  Really, it was like trying to take marionettes and make them funny and interesting merely because they become characters we will like in the original series.  Put them in the right place and they will tug at your heart.  Splash a new bit of shiny action in and, voila! The only part I loved was Simon Pegg as Scotty, he livened up the whole movie, his acting and comedy are spot on.  More please :)
I guess my point is you can't create exactly the same characters from new actors--they're trying to fit into the same groove and it shows as cardboard cutouts.  The interpretation should be open, and then maybe the acting will come across better, like Simon's, loved his Scotty--he wasn't trying to be the original, he was doing lively acting with skill he has to recreate a character.  The original characters don't resonate with a modern audience like they did in their own time.  It has to be updated a bit in interpretation--humanized.  But if they kept with the spirit and didn't feel the need to add so much more action, it would have been much more true to the original beast.",1399852800,,1371,4.540650406504065
3469972,4,B001AVCFJM,"""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is J.J. Abrams' sequel to the Star Trek film of 2009, in which he revived Star Trek, both creatively and commercially,  by reintroducing the original characters in the early years of their Star Trek careers. The conceit was that the adventures many of us were familiar with from the original TV series hadn't happened yet (and were not going to happen, or maybe happen in a different way, or something else -- I was never quite clear on that point.) Regardless, I did enjoy the first one tremendously and was looking forward to see what Abrams would do in the next movie, when he wouldn't be in the narrative strait jacket of having to spend much of the time introducing us to the characters (or re-introducing us -- this can lead down a real black hole) and go just go all out in story-telling.

""Into Darkness"" is a highly enjoyable Star Trek film a space opera, so to speak, filled with exciting action set pieces, a strong villain, plenty of spirited interaction among characters some of us have known and loved for years, decades, even. However, ""Into Darkness"" also highlights some of the problems inherent both in Abrams' ""ret-con"" approach to the material and to a franchise that has existed in one way or another since the Lyndon Johnson Administration.

In my experience, virtually every Star Trek story, in whatever permutation -- TV series, movies, whatever -- can fall into one of several basic categories. There are story lines involving the Klingons (or sometimes the Romulans), story lines involving time travel, story lines involving technology or machinery run amuck, or story lines involving meglo-maniacs, power-mad dictators, or some sort of demi-gods or superior beings on a power trip. ""Into Darkness"" uses the last story line, centering it around Khan, the leader of a genetically-bred race of super humans  designed to save the human race during a time of world war but  exiled into outer space once the practical side effects of this policy became all too evident. (No spoiler here, the basic information is given out right on the back of the CD package). First introduced in the famous TV episode ""Space Seed,"" perhaps the only time in recorded history Ricardo Montalban was ever associated with a project that referenced Milton, Khan returned in the second Star Trek movie in 1982, written and directed by Nicholas Meyer, who saved the franchise from the box office black hole the 1979 movie, directed by Robert Wise, had shot it into.

Abrams does inject some new twists into the Khan mythology, to be sure, and raises ethical questions resonant with today's headlines, including targeted assassinations and the so-called ""war on terrorism."" However, watching this movie, one does experience a certain ""been here, seen this"" feeling from time to time. Much of the material does recycle ideas and plot points  from previous Star Trek incarnations (even ones from the 2009 movie), robbing the story, especially at crucial moments, of some of its  impact. This can also be said  the idea of having the story centered around younger versions of the Enterprise crew. They all evoke the original characters and original performances, some pitch perfect (although I feel the film overdoes Kirk's rebelliousness and impulsiveness) but when one of the original actors from the TV series appears briefly it only serves to remind us that we are watching copies, not originals.

""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a fun popcorn movie, to be sure, one highly recommended for Star Trek fans and fans of well-crafted action adventure movies that isn't afraid to offer some ideas along with the computer generated explosions.  But one also gets a sense after 50 years the franchise is really beginning to show its age. No wonder Abrams has transported himself away, to ""Star Wars,"" another franchise whose commercial reach in recent years has exceeded its artistic grasp.",1399766400,,3904,4.990769230769231

The use the same names for characters, the same place names, and so on.  Everything else is completely off the original Star Trek universe.  Kirk isn't a talented young ensign, he's a know it all wise guy.  Vulcan is destroyed along with Spock's family.  The rest of the crew looks like they just graduated high school.  If you throw everything you ever knew about Kirk, Spock, and anyone or anything else from the original Star Trek universe, it's not bad.

3469994,3,B001AVCFJM,"Interesting to see the 5-star reviews which, directly or indirectly, quickly urge purchase with little info as to why. As is always true, the reasoning is more important than the recommended action; without the reasoning, there is simply motion [in this case, a purchase].

Does that sound like too much thinking? Then this film is for you: action, motion, energy without much thought. ""Escapism"" is sometimes used as a jeering description of the movie experience, but it is quite valid -- particularly when the viewer wants exactly such an escape. For this, the rebooted STAR TREK is a great a success.

Previous Star Trek aimed more for the head -- though the better examples often aimed for the gut as well. This one aims for the gut, and even lower. Hence the disinterest of the Trek traditionalists, and the loud appreciation of the unTrekkers: anyone -- from child to crone, from lifelong Trekker to newbie from a third-world nation -- can understand action, explosions, revenge and lens-flares all set to exciting music, and this is the focus here. For the more intellectual stories -- well, that's been done; that ""Star Trek"" is no longer being made.

This, then, is a film that's strongly structured and visually exciting, where the ""Trek"" details are transformed into window-dressing on a different kind of story. If you loved STAR WARS, you'll find a near-sibling here. And for more ""gritty"" Trek, there's the sequel. If action is what you want, here it is.",1397347200,2,1468,4.911290322580645

I saw every movie on the big screen.  I am the guy who people go to with questions.  As someone says, if it's true, it aint braggin.  That said, I have to say that the new Star Trek is at least the third best movie, after wrath of khan and first contact.  Any complaints anyone has about the movie's continuity seems to have a problem with the concept that ITS a NEW UNIVERSE!  At least JJ Abrams had the sense to do it that way and do it brilliantly.  I am a fan of his anyway, so I guess I'm a little predgudiced anyway, but this is the kind of shot in the arm the franchise needed.  Of course there is the fact that William Shatner is the worst actor in Star Trek history, so Chris Pine wouldnt have had to be half the actor he is to be better.  But fact is, Pine is fantastic.  And as McCoy, Karl Urban is obviously channeling Deforest Kelly.  Frankly I don't really care much what other people think on this one.  You do want to see it.",1396742400,,1098,4.032407407407407

I love the friendship and loyalty element and the chemistry between the actors is right on point. I'm they didn't try to have Chris Pine play Kirk the way William Shatner did, not that there's anything wrong with Shatner's interpretation, but he was kind of a caricature of himself.

Only thing holding them together was the plastic, which when you open it, the plastic falls off. Also the top of the entire back is missing about 2 inches all the way across the back.  I have my DVD'S in a glass case with my flat screen above them.  I think I can hide the condition of the case but this is so totally unacceptable.  Fortunately the movie does play OK.  But when someone says something is in ""good"" condition, I expect it to be in GOOD CONDITION.  It should have been rated in poor condition, but DVD ok or something like that.

This film has everything: Action, drama, suspense, mystery, a solid story, entertainment, excellent writing, etc. I'm a fan of all J.J. Abrams shows/movies (including ""Felicity"", believe it or not, before Kerri Russell cut her hair like a lesbian), and ""Star Trek"" seemed to combine all previous J.J. Abrams shows/movies (except ""Felicity""), such as ""Alias"" and ""Mission: Impossible III"" (the best ""Mission: Impossible"" movie ever made). For example, the ""red matter"" used by the Romulins is similar to the ""red matter"" used by the Chinese sporadically in ""Alias"" season 1 and 2 (a side effect/result of the ""Rambaldi device"").

3470046,4,B001AVCFJM,I didn't see this movie at the theatres and now I wonder why I didn't. though I don't think the director should also be allowed to direct movies that are in a galaxy far far away.,1394668800,,179,4.0

3470049,5,B001AVCFJM,"Very well done, characters were generally true to Classic Star Trek. Finally find out more of James Kirk's, Spock's, Uhuru's and Scotty's backgrounds. This alternate timeline should prove very interesting for those of us who grew up with Classic Star Trek.",1394668800,,256,5.2682926829268295
3470050,5,B001AVCFJM,"I've seen them all but this one is my favorite.  The beginning is one of the best ever.  I admit to being a Trekkie and could watch this movie 50 times,  The casting was outstanding.",1394582400,,182,4.142857142857143

3470058,5,B001AVCFJM,"As a long-time Trekker, I really love this film! JJ Abrams did a surprisingly great job on handling and advancing the lore into a new time-line, so I'm thrilled be able to watch it again to pick up the nuances of change!",1394409600,,220,4.261904761904762
3470059,5,B001AVCFJM,Great movie made more fun by the massive list of extras! It was fun to see the deleted scenes with the first glimpse of the Klingons and the fleshing out of Nero's character.,1394409600,,174,4.303030303030303
3470060,5,B001AVCFJM,It is very good that they did not make a direct remake but instead put a plot twist in that made it a little different from the origional,1394323200,,137,3.9285714285714284
3470061,4,B001AVCFJM,"they dare to re-write star trek and i thnk they didi a great job with it, the changed the whole story, but all the characters are still there",1394236800,,141,4.071428571428571

3470065,5,B001AVCFJM,"I was a bit skeptical when this movie first came out, but after watching it, it did live up to the Star Trek ""FRAME OF HEART AND MIND"". So when I got the chance I decided to purchase a copy. The special effects are great and the story line is good. I have not watched this DVD yet, if a problem should occur, I will append this review. Otherwise, Yes, I recommend this DVD to anyone who likes this type of Science Fiction.",1394064000,,422,4.096385542168675
3470066,4,B001AVCFJM,"For a relaunch they did a fantastic job. So much so it caused me to go back and watch the originals. They chose the plot, and actors so carefully and did a fantastic job in making this film, from the script to the editing. My favorite is the humor though, to find the humor in every situation is the sign of good acting and these guys did that.",1394064000,,344,4.073529411764706

3470068,5,B001AVCFJM,"I have never been a fan of the original Star Trek television series and all the shows and films that were spun from it, so I was a bit apprehensive about watching the 2009 film. Several friends finally convinced me to give it a chance. I loved it! Anyone out there who, like me, thinks that you need to be familiar with all things Star Trek to enjoy this film will find yourself wrong on that account. The film is its own story, introduces the viewer to each character individually, and gives respite from the Trekkie lore while totally satisfying diehard fans of the series.",1393977600,,575,4.485714285714286

3470070,5,B001AVCFJM,Great introduction of Christopher Pine as Captain Kirk. The use of the original Spock was wonderful. Mixing the bod and new is great.,1393891200,,133,4.826086956521739
3470071,5,B001AVCFJM,"This was the second of three DVDs I recently purchased from Amazon.com, and like the other two movies I purchased, Heartbreak Ridge, and Howard The Duck, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It brought back memories of the original TV series, and the original Star Trek movies.  i.e. the ones with the original crew from the TV series.

I first saw it one TV, and wasn't really going to buy it but changed my mind when I saw it on Amazon.com going really cheap.

As I am between TVs at the moment, my current TV had problems with the viewing of programs, soI put it in to get repaired, and the Technician said it is not worth repairing, so I told him not to bother.  As yet I haven't replaced it yet so I am watching the movies through my PC.

I really did enjoy it and I will look at buying the second Star Trek movie when I have the money.",1393804800,,830,4.15625

3470076,4,B001AVCFJM,"I thought the movie was rather loud and dumbed-down.  However, the image and sound are sharp; the colors are saturated, the CGI is top-notch and the sound will pound your chest like Celine Dion on a caffeine binge.  The extras are nice, too, which is good, because JJ stabbed the fans in the back by dispersing all the extras for STID over several releases.  This means you'd have to purchase FOUR versions of the sequel in order to get all the extras.  Enjoy this one.",1393459200,,469,4.482352941176471

3470078,1,B001AVCFJM,"Found this movie at Wally World for 5.00USD. bought it expecting to see what they alluded to in the HYPE on the cover. NOT FOUND. The story line was apparently aimed at teeny boppers, or juvenile audience. It contained many action scenes, mostly of the KIDS getting into fights,or arguments, or rebelling against authority. The shop-worn theme of TIME TRAVEL was a bit thin, and poor Spock (Nemoy), whom I have known briefly, was pitiful. He has always been THIN to the point of emaciation, and it was SAD to see him as aged, wrinkled and a bit SLOW on the uptake. His juvenile self, as portrayed by the guy on the cover, was stilted and lack-luster. The delinquent KIRK, as shown ny his stealing and totally wrecking what appeared to be a vintage corvette, and his bar-fights, and reckless cheating on exams in Academy, portays a POOR role model that surely would be an embarrassment to his family, and would surely have rendered him INELLIGABLE for Star Fleet Command, or even to be IN the academy. As for the flirty Ohura, and her interaction with Spock, et al,, that is a gross distortion of character. IMHO, she should sue the writer, and/or the producers, et al...
Over-all, I am glad I only put five dollars into this piece of trash, that milks the franchise of its' legacy. Sure there were some exciting scenes and masterful special effects, but that hardly justifies the HYPE accorded this garbage. IF I had bought it thru Amazon, I would surely ask for refund. I do NOT recommend this to ANYONE, especially a die-hard FAN.",1393372800,3,1532,4.656826568265683

3470087,2,B001AVCFJM,"Perhaps because it forces me to get used to a new cast of Star Trek actors, but this film irritated me from beginning to end, starting with young Kirk driving his father's car into a canyon. Canyons in Iowa? I really can't say anything good about this film and buying it was a mistake. I love the old Classic Trek and the Next Generation and the Voyager series )the others not so much). The only character in this film I liked was Dr. McCoy, probably because I am a curmudgeon just like him. The plot is a time paradox and though popular in many science fiction books it just didn't add up here and time paradox stories rarely make sense.",1393113600,,638,4.325
3470088,5,B001AVCFJM,"I think the casting for this movie is wonderful.  I was a bit put off at first to see the character changes for some of the main characters (Spock in a relationship with Uhura???).  But I guess this will give the writers/producers a bit more flexibility with their characters and storylines, especially since trekkers can be really nit-picky if timelines don't match up with pre-established trek storylines.  I hope more movies are coming.",1393113600,,439,4.986301369863014

I especially thought Dr. McCoy was well portrayed and could rally see him becoming what I saw in the TV series.,1393113600,,422,4.423076923076923

3470092,5,B001AVCFJM,"I fought watching this reboot of Star Trek, thinking that I'd nitpick it apart.  But, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.  I'm glad there'll be a new generation of Trekkies.  The only aspect I wasn't too keen on was the overuse of the light flares- seemed a bit excessive.",1393027200,,278,4.63265306122449

3470097,4,B001AVCFJM,"This is my second favorite Star Trek movie after The Wrath of Kahn.  I feel that the characters were thrown together to quickly but it was still a good story with great special effects.  The writers are trying too hard to make Karl Urban match the original Bones McCoy.  It doesn't seem genuine like Kirk, Spock and the others.  Urban is still a great actor.

I am glad that I bought it and I watch it often.",1392768000,,408,4.246753246753247

3470103,5,B001AVCFJM,I have never been a huge Star Trek fan but I do love the chemistry between this James Kirk and this Spock. I thought it was very cool how they brought back Leonard Nemoy (not sure how you spell his name) to be the Spock from the future. The casting on this movie could not have been any better and as sci-fi movies go I thought it was a great balance of suspense and emotion. Loved it!!,1392681600,,386,4.025974025974026

3470128,5,B001AVCFJM,"Okay, being a huge trekkie since the original with William Shanter came out there was no way I wasn't going to buy this new version.  Always interesting how one misses the old versions of these series until we get wrapped up in the next incarnation.  Loved the Star Trek: Next Generation and thought the Trek: Voyger was fantastic.  Only recently had the opportunity to view the complete Star Trek: Enterprise series because I must have been on the moon when this one hit the TV airwaves!  This was great and I enjoyed it completely.

Chris Pine is not William Shanter but then one gets past that idea in the back of the head pretty quickly and settles into the story.  Chris Pine is maybe better than Shanter might have been as the young Kirk and before you know it you are totally wrapped up in the antics of his interaction with the young Spock and all of the other crew mates.  Good story and great acting and glad I bought it!",1391385600,,931,4.409356725146199
3470129,5,B001AVCFJM,Solid movie.  Not many of those out there right now. I will be renting the next one as soon as I can.,1391385600,,101,3.590909090909091
3470130,5,B001AVCFJM,"I liked STAR TREK when it first came on the air in 1966!  this upgraded version of the classic series is a fun movie to watch, and live long and prosper!",1391299200,,153,3.935483870967742
3470131,4,B001AVCFJM,"I am a star wars fan, didn't follow that much star trek, but now thanks to this movie I went back and watched all the preview star trek movies. Well, also in part thanks to the last 3 movies star wars brought to the screen, they really sucked. Everyone go buy this movie, it's GREAT!",1391299200,,283,4.163636363636364
3470132,5,B001AVCFJM,"If you're an Original Series Star Trek fan like me, it's so satisfying to get a glimpse of all my favorite characters as they were as youngsters and newly graduated cadets.  Backstories are so ""Fascinating"" as Spock would say it...
The special effects and action scenes were great as well!

* Spoiler Alert*
*I'm Giving Away Plot Here!!!*

Only two things bothered me: It was not in character for Spock to have an average ""human"" romance with Uhura, since he was betrothed to T'Pring of Vulcan and was not in the state of Pon Farr in this movie, and Amanda, his human mother didn't die, but was reunited with Spock when she and Sarek were guests aboard the Enterprise in ""Journey To Babel"".  I realize that time-travel changed history, and that is how the writers justified it, but, I didn't like them meddling with the original characters' histories in those two details.

Spock and Uhura?
Kirk some bombastic punk kid?  Please!
Oh what an arrogant Kobayashi pooh-pooh, (though the apple was a cute touch)
etc? etc? etc?
So are we to believe that everything that has been Star Trek is null and void?
It took 50 years to build Star Trek into what it is, but not anymore.  Now here comes Abrams.  He'll destroy it for you in 127 minutes!

3470134,5,B001AVCFJM,I'm a Trekie and this one took me back to the beginning. I loved learning more about the characters back stories through this movie at the same time a different story was happening. A must see if you love Star Trek.,1391126400,,215,4.2682926829268295
3470135,5,B001AVCFJM,I thought this was a solid movie. Also it is as much action as sci-fi so I was able to enjoy it with non traditional fans as well.,1391126400,,130,3.6785714285714284
3470136,5,B001AVCFJM,I had watched the movie in theatre& still enjoyed it at home. My daughter also enjoyed it with great subtittles she's only 7 years old.,1391040000,,135,4.44
3470137,5,B001AVCFJM,"I have always been a fan of Star Wars, Star Trek never had an appeal for me. This version of Star Trek however, seems to fill in all of the gaps that kept me disinterested from the franchise. I heard on a podcast where J.J. Abrams was being interviewed that he also  did not consider himself a fan of Star Trek but when he was approached for this project he decided that he would do it, but make the Star Trek that he would want to watch.  I definitely believe that this is why I enjoy his versions, there is more action and the characters are made more interesting.",1390953600,,566,4.18348623853211
3470138,5,B001AVCFJM,"I am 51 years old and watched Star Trek religiously as a kid.  I was hesitant to see the new movies because I didn't have much faith in them being able to capture the quirkiness of the characters, but also provide a good, modernized story.  I was wrong.  This 2009 movie was so, so good.  I was blown away by how well the actors captured the mannerisms and speech cadences of the orignial actors.  Plus it was just a great action movie.  I made my 18 y/o son and 20 y/o daughter watch it with me, they were both resistant because neither were Star Trek fans, but they both really, really liked it.  We all liked it so much that we immediately downloaded Into Darkness and watched it the same day!  I highly recommend both movies.  Trust me, you do not have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy them, but if you are...what a blast!",1390953600,,824,4.197452229299363
3470139,5,B001AVCFJM,"I have always been more of a TNG lady, but I loved this movie.  The acting and writing is superb.  It's a wonderful homage to TOS, without being too tied down to it.

The lens flare is REALLY ANNOYING though.",1390953600,,208,4.15

3470143,5,B001AVCFJM,"GREAT movie, and I was as skeptical as the next Trek fan. They pulled it off. The excellent cast actually infuses freshness into great existing characters and appeases both the old fans and young folks at the same time, no small feat.

I recommend this movie to any sci-fi fan for sure, but also anyone who likes a fun action movie that is expertly filmed. It also features some great comic relief throughout, in good Star Trek tradition. It just blows my mind how well this was done.",1390867200,,484,4.5

3470150,5,B001AVCFJM,"I love this movie.  Being a fan of the original series and ST:NG, and sci-fi in general, I found this movie to be a great tribute, if you will, to the classic shows.  It's funny, has a great cast, great writing, and directed by a great visionary director.  I know a few folks were upset about the movie, but I enjoyed it for what it is.  I think each actor/actress played their parts with respect to the original cast, without trying to out do, nor copy the shows.

If you love the shows, I would recommend to purchase this film, or at least rent it from Netflix or Redbox.  I really don't think you will regret it.",1390435200,,615,4.213675213675214
3470151,5,B001AVCFJM,"The bar was very high for this update with a new cast, etc.  And, surprisingly enough, I think they did an excellent job with casting and acting, although Uhura is a different take/character, all the others are great in their roles of Kirk, Sulu, Bones, Chekov, and (in particular) Spock.  And, of course, the special effects are outstanding.  The first two in this series have set the bar very high for a possible third installment.",1390435200,,433,4.746666666666667

I also loved watching the commentary of the movie as well as the special features disc.  Watching the deleted scenes with commentary was very insightful.  Now a lot more of the movie makes sense with the deleted scenes explained, and why they were cut.",1390003200,,519,4.516129032258065
3470161,3,B001AVCFJM,"It was fun to see the original Star Trek characters re-created in this ""alternate reality"" prequel, and for that reason it was very entertaining. However, it was troubling to see the reckless behavior of young Kirk to carry no real consequences, even addiction to alcohol and sex to be glorified in a way. Further, the way women are portrayed, personified most particularly by Uhura, is very shallow, one-dimensinal, as mere sex objects. Male characters are extremely and impressively skilled, while women are only useful to look good and provide physical affection, and only if they try really hard they might turn out to contribute in other ways.",1390003200,,648,5.065420560747664

3470163,3,B001AVCFJM,"And so it was. The devote and the new were ready for more Star Trek. This monumental task could have been challenged by any of the new breed of directors... Zach Snyder, Christopher Nolan or J.J. Abrams. A few other notables might have been up to the task. I was fine with J.J. Abrams to helm this NEW direction but rather unhappy with the term ""reboot."" To me, its like reading another Graphic Novel written by another author.

This review is from a die-hard Trekker and businessman. I own an Action Figure Business with Star Trek & Star Wars figures being my mainstay. If this makes me bias, so be it. I have never been a ""fanboy"", so my thoughts are pretty hardcore. In my line of work, which is a lot of fun, I have set up my shop at MANY conventions. Have made close friends over the years with many of the cast members from TOS, most of the spin-offs and movies. Several of these fine people have come out to my store and stayed for a weekend to do autograph signings. Of these people, I have become close with and spoke at length about their stories. Truly incredible and humbling experiences for me to get to know them all!

3470170,3,B001AVCFJM,"It was with conflicted emotions that I finished watching the reboot of the original Star Trek recently.  The movie has some high points (the casting of the core Enterprise crew, the chemistry of said crew, the special effects), and quite a few low points (plot holes you could fly the Enterprise through, a murky and ill defined bad guy, the use of poorly chosen real life factory shots to represent the interior of the Enterprise).  All these are enumerated in many other reviews so I won't repleate them.  All in all, an entertaining movie that could have been so much more, done by a group of people with little understanding of the original Trek or  the fans of the francise.",1389571200,,679,4.633333333333334
3470171,5,B001AVCFJM,"This movie was well thought out by it's producers. The first meeting of Spock and Kirk is quite the tale, as new relations are usually strained. The story is weaved together to create suspence and expected challenges for the crew of the Enterprise. It is why watching this movie answers some of the questions about how all of this tale began. Overall, I recomend this movie to fans and non-fans alike. It is a great story.",1389571200,,422,4.565789473684211

3470175,5,B001AVCFJM,Really liked the movie.  It was different enough from the original that it really doesn't compete with it. Would recommend it to action fans.,1389484800,,141,4.875
3470176,3,B001AVCFJM,"Thoroughly enjoy the movie. Chris Pine and Zachary Levi and Carl Urban...they just work really well together, surprisingly.

Now, as to Amazon's product, though... :( Not so hot. The volume is poorly regulated and made it very hard to understand and keep up with at times - too soft or too loud, couldn't be adjusted or you'd miss the next thing said right before your eardrums were busted because the music was too much. Very disappointed in Amazon - this is a problem we have had with ALL the movies we've bought from Amazon, though, so obviously it's something with which we've decided we can live.",1389398400,,601,4.669811320754717

I have a techwood surround sound system and the sound was also awesome. I have nothing but good things to say about this purchase. Amazon delivered it on time as promised.
I would like to comment on some of the reviews for this movie. Some people have commented on the movie itself instead of the quality. Personally, I love the movie. But everyone has their own taste in movies. I just think that reviews should be about the quality of the product, the delivery experience, etc. But, that's my opinion. Everybody has one.

3470210,5,B001AVCFJM,This movie is a great action movie in itself if you are not familiar with the Star Trek franchise (crazy!) but the movie also has little things that die-hard fans will pick up on as well. Just enough of a twist on your favorite characters while also updating them and keeping them loveable and familiar. This is a titan of a franchise to pick up with many fine lines to walk but J.J Abrams and the movie crew and cast did a fantastic job! Great movie!,1388448000,,451,4.255813953488372

3470215,5,B001AVCFJM,"It took me a while to get around to this movie, as I am always sceptical about prequels and revisits. They have a tendency to be revisionist. So I waited until I found it quite cheaply, in a charity shop (favourite haunts of movie collectors like me). But I needn't have waited. This movie is excellent. Whilst not as tongue in cheek as Star Trek The Motion Picture, it has the approachability and the impact that has characterised most of the franchise. Chris Pine's Kirk is every bit as brash and arrogant as Shatner's, and Zachary Quinto's Spock has the immaturity and uncertainty hinted at in Spock's youth, by The Search For Spock, and shows all the requisite signs of becoming the older Spock we all know. I have heard it said that the special effects don't have enough impact, but the restraint shown here actually makes the movie more believable as a possible future.",1388275200,,875,4.651612903225806

3470217,4,B001AVCFJM,"Star Trek refreshes the adventure begun in the 1960's with excellent writing, performances and production values.  Chris Pine et al remain true to the original characters while updating them for modern audiences.  The plot skillfully addresses the need to disconnect the ensuing sequels from past episodes and movies with a ""temporal discontinuity"", and the special effects are first-rate -- a long way from the ""star ship on a string"" of the original series.  I hesitate assigning a full five stars because science again takes a back seat to fiction, as is all too common in Hollywood.  While we may need to make the leap of faith that warp drive is in our future, since it is so central to everything Star Trek, I'd appreciate more attention to details like orbital inertia and severe aerodynamic heating in the ""space diving"" sequence, or the seeming ability of the Romulan ship to hover over a single spot on the planetary surface from what is obviously low orbit.",1388275200,,968,4.884146341463414

No one could carry on with the story without ruining it. But lo and behold, they have greatly succeeded. This is an excellent movie and continues the traditions established in the earlier movies, staying true to the original plots and history. The characters are impeccable in portraying the original personalities and in that way are endearing in the roles they play.

I purchased this BD several months ago and put it in my DVD library.  Well I had a 'taste' to see it again tonight and slipped it into my Samsung BD player and began to watch it, WoW! the quality is absolutely Great, Resolution was crystal clear, movements were perfection, sound excellent etc., etc., etc. Even though I'm 'hard-of-hearing' I tagged the Closed Caption option which is the way I generally watch videos but the sound was so good that I didn't have to 'read' the captions to understand what they were saying or going on in the background.
It was a visual treat to see it again on my 'little' screen, actually not so little, 46"" screen set-up in the bedroom.
I must say that I ENJOYED this 'movie' even more then in the theater plus I get to rewind it, stop it and check out some 'special effects', etc. at my option (you can't do that in the theater).
To all you tech nuts who analyzed the movie on it's color, edge enhancements, etc. just don't get it.... It's a Movie, Sit back, relax and enjoy the darned thing, why pick it apart and to your 'Trek' freaks saying that it didn't have the original 'feel' about it, etc. Well of course not, it's nice to see someone take the Trek series to a New level, New style, New actors (except of course Mr. Spock who fit right in to the plot). What are you expecting? Star Trek with the original actors and mediocre plots? get real. This movie was GREAT in all areas and I applauded the producers, director and the actors for taking this to the next level.
I hope they continue to produce more and more of these 'Trek' movies for years to come. I for one will 'ENJOY' them all (I'm sure)
Stop being anal retentive and be happy that someone took the time and money to produce a Five Star movie like this.

SPOILER ALERT

First off, Spock has emotions.  If that isn't weird enough he's having an affair with Uhura.  Kirk has a broken childhood, which we find out is because the timeline has been altered by the dumbest set of Romulans in galactic history.  These idiots have a time machine, which they hijack after a failed attempt to HELP them.  Rather than going back in time 30 years to SAVE THEIR PEOPLE they go back to revenge the deaths of their families (which wouldn't happen if they had 2 brain cells to rub together) and make Spock watch them destroy Vulcan.  And yes they DESTROY VULCAN.  Ohh, on the way Spock is so pissed off (weird as that may be) at the insubordinate Kirk, he has him THROWN OFF the ship....never heard of the brig?????  But wait.  Where does he crash land?  Right next to Scottie, who has a minor job, but has managed one of the greatest feats of transporter technology (not even equaled in the next century) and BEAMS Kirk into the Enterprise as it zooms across intersteller distances....oy vey.

I heard some ""iffy"" reviews, but I saw it, and I was surprised. I definitely has a young, updated feel, but it does follow the original series in many respects. The only thing I did have a problem with (but thankfully was subjected to for mere seconds at the end) was the romantic relationship between Spock and Uhura. I just couldn't buy it. But the movie itself was pretty good, and there was enough action, but not too much to make it just another blow things up movie. I recommend giving it a try, you may be surprised.",1384992000,,665,4.244094488188976
3470302,5,B001AVCFJM,"I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing as a 17-year-old watching my first episode of Star Trek in Black-and-White. Surrounded by the turmoil of the Sixties I was taken with the sense of hope and wonder that Star Trek brought to the small screen, and I have been a fan ever since.

While I was near devastated by the events of Star Trek (the reboot), watching helplessly as friends I have know for over 40 years were suddenly no more, I was none-the-less taken with the care and reverence shown by J.J. Abrams and company. I sincerely believe that Abrams is approaching the work with genuine affection even while he is deconstructing long-standing mythology.

Jim Kirk is still Jim Kirk, just maybe a little more outrageously - owing more to our social sensibilities and the fact that Chris Pine can say and do things in movies that were considered a bit unseemly 40 years past. Spock is still Spock, the difference being that Zachary Quinto is allowing us to see a vulnerability and humanity that long-time fans have always known was there. And I can only explain the portrayal of Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy as Karl Urban channeling DeForest Kelly; if I hadn't been so astounded by itit would have been a bit creepy. Mr. Urban's presentation was not a copy but a reincarnation that caused me to drop my jaw more than once - kudos.

All-in-all, I think the re-imagining of Star Trek with Mr. Abrams at the helm bodes well for the franchise. My grandchildren might have the chance to grow up experiencing the same sense of wonder and hope for the future that so captivated audiences when I was little older than they.",1384992000,,1623,4.608996539792387

3470305,5,B001AVCFJM,"Storyline and characters stayed true to the original series and further developed each of the main characters. Great cgi and effects. Also true to the original, the science is marginally believable, but that's why they call it science ""fiction"" :)",1384819200,,247,5.2

3470308,5,B001AVCFJM,"As a Star Trek fan since the original series, I was pretty skeptical when I heard of this remake.  But happily, I enjoyed this revised version and look forward to the sequels.  What you have to understand, though, is that events in this version completely rewrites Star Trek history so that the franchise now has a fresh canvas and can write it's own future without conflicting with what's already out there.

For me, the highlight of the movie is Karl Urban's portrayal of McCoy.  I just wonder how many hours he spent watching Star Trek to be so dead on.  In fact, he might just be a better McCoy than DeForest Kelley.  Or maybe just a new and improved version.  The multiple injection gag is just hilarious.

I did, however, raise my eyebrows a bit at the romance between Spock and Uhura.  Really?  Well, ok.  This is a different time line so I'll wait and see where it leads.

Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.",1384732800,,953,4.476744186046512

Paramount should be kicked somewhere sensitive for what they did with the Bonus Features (Retailer exclusives mean you can't get all the bonus features without a detective style hunt).

3470333,5,B001AVCFJM,"A lot of people hate on these new Star Trek films as they play games with the established canon, etc. etc.

However, what people also forget (and let me add that I'm a lifetime Star Trek fan), is that the franchise was essentially dead. The last Next Generation film was (apart from the fact it was nice to see the characters again) diabolically bad, the Enterprise series, although good in parts, was something of a retread of old ideas and sometimes pretty bad.

Something had to be done to rescue the franchise and I think that JJ, len's flares, action sequences and all, got it just about right. This is an exciting, visually stunning film that does an amazing job of capturing the essence of classic Trek (I think Bones gets it spot on), and respects the original, without ruining it in anyway.

For the naysayers, I've always wanted to ask ""How would you have resurrected it?"" because a retread of what's gone before had been proved not to work (again, see Enterprise and Nemesis). This/these new films got us back our beloved Star Trek and in a pretty damn good incarnation to boot. This film is great entertainment and yes, it lacks some of the more thought provoking elements of classic Trek, but I'll take it thank you.

As a standalone film, or as an extension of Trek, I rate this film A+",1384041600,,1300,4.542735042735043

Good action and decent storyline, great special effects.  Having Nimoy in the movie too was good,  he is THE SPOCK and I enjoy his appearance on any thing Trek.  The movie was packed very well, and delivered on time.  I also have the movie on my iPhone and every now and then watch while at work on my break.

As a lifelong Trekkie (Before they started calling themselves, ""trekkers"", dammit) I have been though all iterations, sequels, spin-offs, etc.
This was the Trek I was waiting for. Action packed, slightly humorous, brightly colored, darkly themed at times and a stellar cast.
In particular Anton Yelchin as Chekov. His line deliveries are unique and honest and as real as can be.
But, that shouldn't take away from the rest of the cast, who are extraordinary.
And yes, I like the lens flares.

3470345,5,B001AVCFJM,"""Trekkies"" and ""Trekkers"" can complain all day long about the continuity problems with this current Star trek movie, but in truth, this is an excellent movie to bring in a new generation of fans, and a great introduction for casual Trek fans, such as myself.

JJ Abrams made a masterful film, and it delivers everything that you could ask for in a movie (as does the entire cast).  Chris Pine is outstanding playing the role of James T. Kirk, Zachary Quinto is perfect in his portrayal of Spock, and Karl Urban is the perfect Dr. Leonard McCoy.  Zoe Saldana is easy on the eyes and Simon Pegg is brilliant in his take on ""Scotty"".

I know that Star Trek fans and Star Wars fans are often at odds, and the movies aren't, really, similar in many ways (at least not to me), so I feel like they are comparing ""Apples and Oranges"".

But, that said, if Star Trek keep this pace up, this franchise will soon lap Star Wars in short order with respect to writing, acting, cinematography, and overall quality.

Although I am certain to draw fire for this, with the exception of it's sequel, ""Star trek: Into Darkness"", this is the best Star Trek movie ever made.",1383523200,,1152,4.488038277511961
3470346,5,B001AVCFJM,I am a Trekkie so any Star Trek movie is great from my perspective. I have watched Star Trek from the very first season when I use to pop popcorn and sit in front of the TV on Friday nights to watch the original series. I'm glad the program continues. I will forever be a fan.,1383523200,,276,3.9464285714285716

3470350,5,B001AVCFJM,"I like the story it really helped to understand where Kirk and his crewmates came from. It was also exciting!  Be warned though I consider myself a Trekky light, so if you don't like Star Trek this might not be the film for you.",1383350400,,228,4.181818181818182
3470351,3,B001AVCFJM,"Just kidding; I actually enjoy this movie a lot.

Like the ""most helpful favorable reviewer"" pointed out, this movie is a mixed bag, a fun fantasy for new kids coming to the Star Trek franchise for the first time, with interesting origins of all the characters die-hard Trekkers have already come to know and love.  The casting of all the leads is perfect.

The story is somewhat out of wack with what has come before.  This is no doubt writer/director JJ Abrams' attempt to create an ""expanded universe"" or ""alternate reality"", his own vision for Star Trek, which is courageous and audacious, to say the least.  He's in effect ""reinventing the wheel"", to draw new fans to Star Trek and alienates some old ones.

While I'm all for taking some artistic liberties with existing material, I feel the filmmaker needs to feel some sense of duty and responsibility to honor that which has ""boldly gone where no one has gone before"".  The origins of the characters are great, but Vulcan destroyed?  That's not in line with the original Trek.

Still, this new Star Trek is an entertaining, fun thrill-ride, and I'm just delighted that Paramount is revitalizing Trek AT ALL!  If nothing else, this new version of Trek and its eventual franchise will stimulate kids to go back and watch the original Trek series and movies, which is great.  This is why I among other die-hard Trekkers can't be too upset about this new version of Trek.",1383350400,,1425,4.728744939271255

I was trying to purchase a few new movies for my hospital bag (I'm expecting!) and was excited to find this as cheap as I did.

After watching this we watched the very first episode of Star Trek the '67 TV series.  I've been watching Star Trek since '73 as a three year old and actually like the way Abrams did this movie.  I was wondering what all the concerns with the flare that people have commented on and after seeing this the second time I now see what they mean.  While I understand it for spicing up the cinematography it is over board.  They can let a scene go with it coming in.  And yes, it better not over take any of the Star Wars movies as this is NOT what would have in the first three episodes (e.g. IV, V, and VI).",1382918400,,776,4.167785234899329

I bought this version because I don't care about the digital copy, the ultraviolet, or whatever. But I do enjoy special ""making of"" featurettes that used to come along with the movie, and this didn't have any such. I felt like something was left out, and I didn't like that.

3470392,4,B001AVCFJM,"This movie is a retelling of the origins of Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, and the rest of the Star Trek franchise characters from the original series, and how they came together on the Enterprise. If you love Star Trek, then youll probably love this film. It holds up well on its own even as basic science fiction.

Chris Pine is a great Captain Kirk, close enough to William Shatner to make it believable without lurching into parody, and Zachary Quinto is an amazing Mr. Spock.

Some of the best scenes belong to Leonard Nimoy, reprising his role as the original Mr. Spock. Ironically, Nimoy's appearance is the high point and the biggest problem with the film. The overall tale is comforting and pleasurable, but the movie never goes beyond this. Everything in the story is more about Star Trek and exploring stuff that is old and familiar (with new actors) rather than developing an actual new story with a particular idea or thematic direction.

So overall, its a good move but not at all a great one. Its simply enjoyable, a trifle of fun and not anything worthy of great reflection.

Star Trek fans note... Since continuity in the ""Star Trek universe"" is so important to rabid fans, this movie is officially an ""alternate timeline"" story. What happens here doesn't fit at all with subsequent events in the established Star Trek universe. This is due to time travel at the beginning of the tale. The film's director, J.J. Abram's, used this story technique to detach this movie and subsequent films from the necessity of fitting the Star Trek canon.",1382054400,2,1550,4.75092936802974

I think this was probably one of his favorite Father's Day gifts ever! He spent the next three weeks watching and re-watching every movie in the series with our 8-year old son (though we did have to fast forward through a few scenes that were especially violent).  And since ""Into Darkness"" wasn't released on DVD until September, he also had something to look forward to once he'd finished all the other Star Trek movies.

The newer movies (this one and ""Into Darkness"" are his favorites), but he has really enjoyed having the entire collection and I'm sure these are movies he will enjoy watching again and again. He's already watched all of them at least twice, some three times - and we've only had them a few months!

One small complaint:  couldn't there have been better dialog for Nemoy?!?  Or maybe that was just the right touch to remind us of where this all started.

Leonard Nimoy is really looking old but he's still Spock and the guy playing him as a young man was very good. All the stars who play the younger versions of Capt. Kirk etc. were excellent! I loved the story line and the action and adventure. I'm not one of these people who pick apart a film from a technical point of view. I hate those people that do that. 99% of people go see a film to be entertained and don't look at the technical jazz. Very few people are educated in the art of filmmaking so they go to see the movie for fun or because it was made from a book they read or a true story that inspired the film.  Just ordered the DVD. Haven't seen the new film that's out on DVD now but I'll be ordering it soon. Gotta add it to my ""Star Trek"" collection. Have the complete original TV series on DVD and the complete set of the movies with the original cast members. Intend to buy the films made from the second series ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" someday soon.

It is as though the actors in this movie are not younger versions of the characters but are truly younger versions of the actors in the original series.  Love this movie.  One of my favorite parts is when McCoy tells Kirk that he is where he is because his ex-wife got everything on the planet in the divorce and left him nothing but his ""Bones.""",1380412800,,507,4.478260869565218

3470471,4,B001AVCFJM,"I'll admit I did not like this film the first couple times I watched it.  In fact the first time I kept screaming at the TV ""this is not Star Trek!""  I was certain Gene Roddenberry was rolling over in his grave.  While I knew going into the film that J.J. Abrams was rebooting the franchise with a re-imagined Star Trek my mind immediately shut down at all the ""mistakes,"" not allowing me to actually enjoy a good film.  The second time I watched it, it made more sense to me.  Abrams and Co. had picked the perfect way to reboot the franchise - an alternate timeline, running concurrent to the nearly 50 years of established Star Trek history.  Establishing an alternate timeline allows Abrams to offer fresh and exciting stories without having to be responsible to Star Trek's past and without dishonoring Roddenberry and the prior incarnations of Trek that stuck to his ""universe.""

Once I got over the ""hurdle"" I watched the film a third time and was pretty blown away.  Yes, J.J. Abrams' Star Trek is targeted more toward non-Trekkies, with its slick action and I think purposeful lack of the typical Trek morality play, but there's enough juicy morsels from the established Trek Universe thrown in to make the diehards like the film.  First, the color and picture on the Blu-Ray is pretty astounding.  I really wish the previous Trek films had been given anywhere near the budget Abrams was given.  Imagine how much better ""Insurrection,"" ""Nemesis,"" ""Generations,"" or and even ""First Contact"" (one of the best Trek films, in my opinion) could have been with a bigger budget.  The special effects in this new Star Trek are incredible.

The casting in Star Trek was perfect.  These characters are obviously younger - again, a departure from the events in Roddenberry's universe - when they arrive on the Enterprise.  Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are casting perfection as a young Jim Kirk and Spock respectively.  These two actors have just as much chemistry as William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy.  Karl Urban was the perfect choice to the younger ""Bones"" McCoy, although in this new incarnation he seems to be less of a central character; in the Original Series and its subsequent six films the trio of Kirk/Spock/McCoy was the central focus.  Abrams seems to have replaced McCoy with Uhura in this updated triplicate.  The lovely Zoe Saldana portrays a very sexy, smart, and sassy Lieutenant Nyota Uhura.  John Cho is spot on as Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu, a worthy successor to the great George Takei.  I very much enjoyed Simon Pegg as Chief Engineer Scott, and the young Anton Yelchin as Pavel Checkov.  I also very much enjoy that this younger Spock and Uhura have a romantic relationship.

Where I think Abrams succeeded (where some of the previous Trek films failed) is every main character is given something important to do, even if they're not central to the plot.  While Star Trek: The Next Generation is my favorite of the Trek series' the Next Gen films often irritated me because each film seemed to focus only on the characters of Picard, Riker, Troi, and Data.  Crusher, Worf, and La Forge were completely underutilized and the character development of those films suffered as a result.  This new Star Trek uses each of the ""main characters"" in respectful ways.

There are some issues with which I could not reconcile; blame it on my loyalty to the Roddenberry Universe.  Why are Nero and his Romulan crew bald with tattoos?  Romulans and Vulcans are physically identical, and while Abrams' story takes place in an alternate timeline Nero followed Spock Prime (Leonard Nimoy) from what would be Roddenberry's universe.  Shouldn't they look the way Romulans' looked before?  Second, there is no way a ship the size and design of the Enterprise could be constructed on Earth; it would have to be constructed in space.

However, these are my nitpickings as a life-long Star Trek fan and in no way kept me from FINALLY enjoying this movie.",1379894400,,3952,4.826151560178306
3470472,3,B001AVCFJM,"It's like all the re-invisioned stuff that's been put out lately. Instead of coming up with their own visions of different stories,

I did not think that I would be that into it but it turns out it was a really good movie. I actually saw the sequel before watching this movie and this movie made the second one (star trek into the darkness) even better. What makes this movie so good is that the characters and story are so well developed.,1379721600,,413,4.111111111111111

The second time I watched it, I got it!  The altered time line idea was a key point that I had missed, which made everything fall into place for me.  I like the movie in blue ray much more than regular DVD format for the color and visual detail.  The actors must have spent months watching the original Star Trek crew in order to mimic the traits of each actor because they did such a great job.  I really enjoyed this movie and the follow up ""Into Darkness"".  Both movies are very entertaining.",1379721600,,648,4.227642276422764

3470484,4,B001AVCFJM,"The new Star Trek franchise starts with this movie.  It's hard to call it a reboot, since it's more of an alternate universe.  To me, that gives it leeway to be different from the original.  So don't go into it expecting it to be just like the Star Trek you remembered from TV, or even the original franchise movies.  This version is more big action flick than those were.  Bigger budget, too.

That said, it suffers from some of the same problems as other big budget action flicks.  Sometimes character development lags in favor of more action on the screen.  Other times they substitute pithy dialog or visual gags instead.  Yet once they get to the meat of the storyline the pace picks up and you aren't paying attention to anything but the sheer fun of it all.

The only thing I really dislike about the movie is the director's frequent use of lens flare.  I get that it's a stylistic thing, but boy is it distracting!  I felt like I needed sunglasses to watch the movie!",1379548800,,975,4.446327683615819
3470485,5,B001AVCFJM,"We've been trekkies for years, and current movie doesn't disapoint, though I do wish the Star Trek people who make these movies would take a bit more time on character development. This story is a remake of  the Wrath of Khan but of course in the new timeline. Dr Carol Marcus is introduced but her nonessential scene in a bra and panties is definitely very posed and she is made to look like Barbie. The actress, however, is good but not given a chance in fast paced scenes to do much. Spock's character is the best and his romance with Uhura is well done.

3470502,5,B001AVCFJM,"Well, it's a really great movie and I just loved the bonus features. I'm well aware it's not the Star Trek in the ""traditional"" sense but, that's ultimately what I love about it. A non-stop roller-coaster high-octane punch in the teeth that makes you grow some chest hairs. That's what this movie is. Even gorgeous ladies love this movie so fellas (don't be afraid to introduce your lady to a little sci-fi)!!",1379116800,,409,4.694444444444445
3470503,1,B001AVCFJM,"Firstly, mostly, that this was done as a reboot was to me, appalling. I wanted to call up Paramount and yell,
""DID YOU LEARN NOTHING FROM THE MESS YOU MADE OF ENTERPRISE!""
that show is the first Star Trek since the original, that couldn't make it thru the whole run. And at the time the fan base was ravenous for anything Trek. To make a television show with a built in fanbase and still screw it up, wow. I just hope whoever was in charge had their citizenships revoked and were deported to somewhere unpleasant for failures.

But i won't even discuss the reboot or the changes there of to example how much crap this was, because even if all the names were changed and it was just some new space action movie, it would still be considered absolute crap by me.

So, yeah, forget the Star Trek part. (after this long do I need to say, ""SPOILERS AHEAD""
the generic bad guy who created a huge powerful TIME TRAVELING  warship comes from the future to save his family by changing the past, arrives in the past and then waits FOR 30 YEARS before he strikes at his target, sort of. then, when he finally does strike, WITH A WEAPON THAT CAUSE A BLACKHOLE at the center of a planet, thus collapsing the planet does nothing else happen in that area of space, ya know like it would. planets being pulled out of orbit, moons pulled apart, sun GOING NOVA. So our brave heroes and crew are being sucked into the blackhole and to escape they jettison their engine. the only thing that makes the ship go. That would be basically telling your crew, ""okay guys, we're all gonna die so we might as well just accept it by getting rid of out only means of escape.""

This captain isn't a hero, he just doesnt want to leave any witnesses to his failure of losing a whole freakin planet.

This movie was crap from beginning to end. In a galaxy the size of a GALAXY, 100 MILLION STARS plus, they just happen to arrive on not just the correct planet 3 times but the correct places on each planet, AT RANDOM to further the plot. This should be a suspension of disbelief if it was confined to one planet.

I am not a fan of Abrams. even though he seems a success, I cant fathom why. He's good with opening premises but lousy at follow thru. on every single project he's done.
Felicity: (yep) she screws up her life so much she uses magic to go back a year and screw up her life, mostly not even in different ways, just less comprehensible ones.
Alias: rebooted the whole thing just as the plot was climaxing. No resolution to the first story line, just a cliff hanger, and a nonsensical second storyline.
Lost: created divergent paths and then just abandoned his viewers on them.
Cloverfield: well okay, this I sort of liked. except right in the middle of the movie he drops the hook(the found footage thing) for conventional camera angles, and then back when its convenient again. this is just poor film making.
Fringe: started off interesting, it hooked me in and then it just went off the rails from action to badly written drama. I just stopped caring about any of the characters because they kept changing how they acted, and Im not even talking about their doubles  which I liked at first.

I can not conceive of a reason that anyone gives this guy any money at all without huge control stipulations, like an actual story bible(characterizations, basic overall arc of the story) just for a start.  He's the next M. Night.
To me every single thing he has started he's either abandoned for someone else to try and finish or mucked up the middle and got it cancelled. The vocal fans had more to do with keeping that money pit, LOST,  going so it could conclude properly than any talent in storytelling.

when I first heard that Disney had bought Star Wars I was relieved because that meant that Lucas couldn't screw it up anymore than he had (see,(no dont) the re-cuts(re-imagined?) originals and the drivel which were the ""pre-sequels. Then I heard that Abrams was going to make the original-sequels. All I can think now is what is the most radical way he can make a mess of them and people will still go because it says Star Wars in the title.",1379116800,11,4121,4.4378306878306875

3470527,4,B001AVCFJM,"Star Trek (2009) on Blu-Ray is a fantastic film running 126 minutes long. The film is a new take on an existing series, it does suffer from consistency issues with the Star Trek series. Nothing that will hurt the movie if you can look beyond that though. With that said, the movie is paced well, with the entire story being important to the outcome of the film. Throughout the movie, we have an opportunity to explore a number of landscapes, ice worlds, space, and earth. This Star Trek though is beginning of the journey, prior to the original Star Trek series, and as such is a perfect entry into the Star Trek world for both new and old. The story is a tightly nit tale of retribution, coming of age, and desire. The screenplay was well written, the characters were confident and fun, and as a whole it was a great experience. There were some pieces of this which may make it inappropriate for younger audiences depending on family rules. There is some kissing, women in underwear, and some crude humor. There is also some profanity spread throughout as well as characters who are intoxicated. Overall though, I would say for most families and children this movie would be fine for anyone over the age of 10-12.

The video itself is fantastically done in 1080P with a light grain. Fleshtones are correct, and correctly reflect the lighting for the different environments, even when some of this is done in CG. The blacks throughout the film were deep and textured, an important piece of a film like this. The darker ships were well textured and differentiated from the depths of space behind them. Overall, the film is an excellent representation of what a video can look like and will be a great way to showcase the power of your home theater display.

The audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD (5.1 I believe) and is engulfing in every way. The soundtrack features powerful LFE (low frequency extension -- bass from the subwoofer), such as when the ships jump to warp, but it's important to realize that the entire dynamic range (low to high volume levels) is compressed in comparison to a more common action movie. The movie takes advantage of the full 360 area and creates a soundstage filled with detail and direction that will allow you to stay fully engrossed in the movie.

Overall this is a fantastic movie with strong video and audio aspects. Highly recommended.",1378684800,,2372,4.697115384615385

I ordered both movies at same time and had not seen the theater releases.  Seeing the first one made me think I did not want  the  second one or any that follow.  They are just not like the old tv series.
Another point, I don't want commercials of other movies, in movies that I have bought.  No problem with the quality of the dvd or shipping.  I have older Star Trek movies  that I like. New ones are for younger fans then me.

it was horrific.  This film story line goes so fast, an entire audience

nudity had no reason as just to give quick lust of individuals. People
rating this film with 5 stars have to be fabricated - or these individuals
are just an indication where film quality is going. Its hard to imagine
Spock in with an on going affair with lieutenant Uhura much less Spock
going crazy and violent. Something unbecoming of a Vulcan.  Non-the-less.  This
film is truly Garbage.  (Walters Judson Group film score:  57 (40-106).

JJ Abrams at his best! The casting, the score, the cinematography, the action scenes, the wardrobe, everything about this film was amazing!! The Enterprise as The Enterprise, Chris Pine as Captain James T Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Simon Pegg as Scotty, John Cho as Sulu, Freaking Eric Bana, they couldn't have picked a better cast!!!!! I could go on and on!  Great story too, I like how they gave a new generation(us) an origin story with the old characters that most of us probably watched reruns of as kids.

Well, with this movie I was hoping to see the first baby steps that the young cast would take fresh out of Star Fleet Academy. I was confident that Star Fleet had the wisdom to work each of its new cadets into their new roles over time under the authority of experienced officers so that they could learn from those who came before them and become better officers (NOT!!!!!!!!!!!). Come to find out that ""reboot"" means that the universe timeline has been so altered that I would never to get a chance to find out how the ""Kobyashi Maru"" scenario *actually* went down or any of the other stories that are alluded to in the original series. Instead, I get to see how some rookies fresh out of school save the universe from destruction (Seriously, this is really part of the script!). To be honest, after that there is nothing left for them to do. I was braced for a disappointment when a friend of mine explained the storyline to me and how it had made up excuses for why it didn't have to support TOS background. I don't think I would have seen it to this day but it was one of the offerings on a flight to Indonesia via Moscow and Singapore so I watched it. My expectation for disappointment was not disappointed. I probably don't care to see it ever again.

3470617,1,B001AVCFJM,"This film is utter garbage, complete filth and should never have been allowed to have been produced in the first place. The acting is terrible and because most people are familiar with characters such as Captain Kirk, Dr. Mccoy, Spock, Scotty, etc, the portrayals of those characters seem more like cheesy Saturday Night Live caricatures rather than actual characters that I as a Star Trek fan can really appreciate.

Paramount royally screwed up when they allowed this to be made because Star Trek had been off the air for quite some time. And lets be honest here, Star Trek is best as a television series and the beauty of that is the television series in past ST incarnations blended well with the films because the TV series set the tone for the formula for how Star Trek works. In addition there are continuity issues in which for example the writers of Star Trek The Next Generation made sure to keep the storytelling style of the original 1960's series and continued the timeline 80 years after the original time of Kirk and Spock, but instead of changing the Star Trek Universe, TNG gave us new characters to care about while being consistent with the original series. That's why as a Star Trek fan I can honestly say that I enjoyed every Star Trek film starting with Star Trek The Motion Picture because TOS set the tone for each of the characters as well as the direction of how Star Trek is as a science fiction franchise. Star Trek The Next Generation continued this storytelling style of the original series, along with Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and even Enterprise. The films that were released in later years with the cast from The Next Generation also worked because of the consistency with the television series because each series indirectly connected with each other and followed the same formula which attracted Star Trek fans.

Speaking of Star Trek fans, I think that what Star Trek 2009 did was attempt to make Star Trek for the masses, which I think is a mistake because products are made for a certain audience. Star Trek for example, was written for a science fiction audience who cared about action, but also cared more about the message within the story. The same goes for Star Wars and other science fiction genres. While products such as Star Trek and Star Wars are both science fiction, fans of these great franchise clearly understand what makes Star Trek and Star Wars exciting franchises that have staying power in the hearts and minds of fans.

Meaning that yes, Star Wars for example traditionally follows a more action oriented approach while Star Trek has action, follows a more Shakespeare/Sherlock Holmes approach to the story.

This is not the case with Star Trek 2009 because you basically have a director who is sending the message to all Star Trek fans that Gene Roddenberry didn't get it right the first time and that he is going to shove down our throats his Star Wars lite version of what he thinks Star Trek should be. I think that this is truly a mistake because it guts the core of what Star Trek is out of the film and as a fan, I am completely appalled.

I think that is what ticks me off the most about this movie as well as STND.

This is a foolish attempt to ""reboot"" a franchise for the Jersey Shore ADHD generation and the sad thing is, here on Amazon we have a good deal of people, mostly non Star Trek fans who like this garbage. As well as people who claim to work in the industry harassing true Star Trek fans by commenting on reviewers who do the right thing by calling out JJ Abrams Star Trek for what it really is, an impostor and an insult to everything Star Trek.

The bottom line is that if you are a true Star Trek fan, this film is going to disappoint you because what you really want is a continuation of the real Star Trek Universe. Hopefully JJ Abrams and crew will stay far, far away from Star Trek so that the franchise can go back to the real Star Trek Universe and leave the reboot cast/crew to work on the next MTV reality show. Otherwise, true Star Trek fans can consider this not Star Trek but rather ""star trek"" Apocrypha as envisioned by cast of writers who do nothing to continue the vision of Gene Roddenberry's future.",1376352000,16,4202,4.550264550264551

Action films can sometimes have the opposite effect on me, becoming so Overstimulating that I actually get so bored I fall asleep. But this film was true to his character, and the casting was superb.

Spock has been reborn in Zachary; they look so much alike (when Nimoy was young, that is) that it is freakish. Be prepared for some changes, however, in that this film seems to take place in a parallel universe. Spock and Uhurah are fall in love and, apart from some rough spots along the way, carry their love connection into the second film.

The bad guys are pretty good too. Lots of great CGI explosions and emotional tension between Kirk and Spock as they get to know each other. This is a time travel trip, after all, taking the viewer back to what would be considered a prequel by most fans.

This is an excellent action sci-fi movie even if you've never seen much of the earlier Star Trek TV and Movie entries...It is a terrific story told very well by JJ Abrams and the cast he has assembled.

Which brings me to another gripe.  I am sorely disappointed that Amazon doesn't have a Windows Media Center/XBox Media Center plugin available for folks using that technology.

3470677,4,B001AVCFJM,"I love the older Star Trek movies, like The Wrath of Khan, The Undiscovered Country, The Voyage Home, and First Contact. After the lackluster Nemesis from 2002, the franchise was exhausted, and needed new perspective, not to mention money. So, in a world of high budget CGI and a new crop of talented directors, the stage was set for a new, fresh-looking reboot of the legendary series. This first film manages to tell the story in a lighthearted tone, while keeping emphasis on the origins of the main characters, all the while balancing it all with intense action at times. While this film resonates with older fans and newer fans alike, the most noticeable and obvious element is the general direction that this three part series is headed; most of us knew that its successor (Into Darkness) would have lots of action and eye candy for the new fans out there. This is a necessary move in terms of long-term sustainability, and I like this movie for the most part, but must admit that I'm a little more old school when it comes to the Star Trek franchise. This movie works well on many fronts, and certainly holds my interest, but I like the old movies a tad bit more because there's substance over style, or more brain and less brawn. Still, this flick is a must-see; the actors are superb in their roles and develop throughout the film. If I have one chief criticism of the way these movies are being made, it's the often shaky camerawork, as is the case for many films these days. I just don't like watching a movie feeling like I'm on some amusement park ride. I just hope the new Star Wars movie in 2015 won't have this distraction.",1374451200,,1639,4.54054054054054

The story moves us through James entering the academy and the beginning of his relations with the rest of the crew. Things get moving quickly with the introduction of a time traveling ship that attacks the Vulcan planet. The newly christened Enterprise if put into battle immediately where it all begins, setting the ground work for the future of the Enterprise crew. This movie is loaded with a great cast, plenty of who's who in today's Hollywood and good balance of talent. Add the cinematic style of JJ Abrams and Dan Mindel and you get a work of art. It's shot on 35mm and turns out an anamorphic format with lots of hidden lens flares, it's like old school meets hi-def, very apparent in a lot of the scenes on the bridge of the Enterprise.
I highly recommend this movie for fans and non-fans of Star Trek, it's entertaining whether you've seen Star Trek or not. Fans can argue some flaws in the timeline or event's, regardless of right or wrong it doesn't detract from how good and fun this movie is.",1374451200,,1096,4.430693069306931

Package quietly arrived at 13:00. As I was distracted by other events falling into play, I did not gain an opportunity to retrieve it until 13:43, well after it had maintained status in the appropriate mailbox. Upon opening the package, it was discovered that the ""DVD sleeve"" did not open horizontally in customary book fashion-- instead, the inner means of storage for the ""DVD"" slips in and out of the top and bottom efficiently. In addition to the optical disc contained within, a digital copy of the motion picture is included for convenient viewing on one's personal computer or a capable mobile device.

The faces of myself and Starfleet Captain James Tiberius Kirk, currently indisposed in the ship's medical bay, are featured on either side of the box. Illogical, as only one side is upturned and in line of the viewer's sight at any standard point in time, but this seems to have given exorbitant amounts of pleasure to the Captain, who rather... *gleefully* rotated the package in his hands before Chief Medical Officer Leonard McCoy was able to relieve him of his consciousness once more.

In summary, the package arrived efficiently and well-protected. There were no scratches or malfunctions, and no complaints can be made as to the quality, quantity, or methods of shipping for the product.

3470695,5,B001AVCFJM,"I love this movie. The story line is entertaining and well written, the sets are amazing, the characters are great, and it is overall just fun to watch.

That being said it is definitely a bold re imaging of the original TV show and a product of this generation, a complaint I hear a lot. The pace is faster, there is more action, and the technology is more advanced. I don't quite understand the complaint. All of the TOS movies were a product of their time and style wise were not the same as the show. However, to each their own.

Star Trek 2009 hits the head on the nail with the casting. Each cast member does a amazing job in representing the character they play. They did a good job keeping what we know and love about the original cast while adding their own spin to the character. I cannot imagine anyone else doing a better job. I do wish that they would have had Yeoman Rand or Nurse Chapel in the movie, even if only in the background(If they were I missed it).

The alternate timeline does not bother me. Even though 2009 was supposed to be prequel, I do consider it more of reboot of the series so just about anything goes. I do think the alternate time line was created in order to make things easier because they did not have to follow certain things to a T. However, that makes things more interesting because we don't know how things are going to turn out.

The blu ray is good quality but I do wish that it would have had more extra features on it. I always like to watch behind the scenes stuff and deleted scenes so it was a bit of a let down when I could not find a reasonably price blu ray with the extra feature.",1374105600,,1636,4.2006369426751595

Then they cast Zachary Quinto as Spock, Karl Urban as Bones, Simon Pegg as Scotty and as yet unknown to me, Chris Pine as Captain Kirk.  Each actor/actress gives a fine performance, with the ones I previously stated as my favorites.  The story is fantastic and the visuals are stunning.  I definitely enjoyed this more than any of the previous shows/films (save for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and that's more for the unintentional humor between Kirk and Khan) and couldn't wait to see what the sequel brought.

3470752,5,B001AVCFJM,"Every time I watch this movie I am reminded how much I enjoy it. Let me say from the start that I grew up on the original series (TOS), and I am a die-hard ""Star Trek"" fan. However, since TOS is truly unique and unrepeatable, I don't judge the movie by those standards, as I think to do so is a losing proposition. Why not let this movie stand or fall on its own merits? Why not appreciate it for what it is rather than what some people imagine it should have been?

For people familiar with TOS, there are definitely moments that are genuinely Star Trek, such as the interactions between Kirk/Spock and Kirk/McCoy. It was funny, for instance, to hear what they suggested as the origins of McCoy's nickname, Bones. McCoy also has some classic moments when, like his TOS counterpart, his emotions get the better of him. And then there is the scene where Chekov attempts to speak his password to the computer, only to be initially rejected because of his thick Russian accent (""Wictor, Wictor"" instead of ""Victor, Victor""). These are the kinds of moments that made TOS truly memorable, and it was wonderful to see them in the movie.

I think Zachary Quinto does exceedingly well as the young Spock. I found young Kirk's character to be a little more reckless than I think is necessary, but Chris Pine did a fine job portraying him. We learned the first names of several major characters. There is plenty of action, excellent special effects, and a good story line. And, just like TOS, there are some very funny one-liners.

I actually would give the movie four and a half stars if I could. Despite the high entertainment value of this movie, there were a few things that proved to be just plain silliness for me. Overall they did not ruin the movie, but they were certainly momentary distractions and warranted a minor deduction in my rating:

1. The whole Spock/Uhura romance is utterly foreign to TOS, so I don't know why it was introduced in this movie. It just seemed pointless to me.

2. The idea of the ""red matter"" was also problematic. TOS was consistent in making the science of its day very believable. Even though the show was science fiction, many of the concepts contained therein were based on real science. How is it, then, that while one drop of the red matter can create a small black hole, it can be touched with a syringe and stored in a container?

3. Arguably the most absurd aspect of the technology in the movie was the decision to use a brewery for the engineering shots. My goodness, it's the 23rd century. Take a look at the Enterprise's bridge. It's brimming with ultra hi-tech equipment, yet the engineering section of the ship consists of lots of pipes, valves, barrels, and very 20th-century looking panels and boxes. Bad, bad choice.

Despite these minor distractions, I would definitely recommend this movie. It is highly entertaining, fast-paced, action-filled, and engaging.",1373241600,,2906,4.686274509803922
3470753,5,B001AVCFJM,"I got a chance to watch this not long after it was released on Blu-Ray on my father's home theater. All I can say is WOW. Loved the re-imagination of the franchise, the picture was stunning and it had a great story but the sound was on a different level.

In fact, the sound in this movie officially convinced me that it was time to move to Blu-Ray. Yes, the picture is awesome on Blu-Ray but for my size set (40"" Samsung LCD) not that big an upgrade from the excellent up-converting Panasonic DVD player I had. The Dolby HD track however was just astounding and the detail and fidelity from good Blu-Ray movies imo is the best reason to upgrade to Blu-Ray (with the corresponding equipment of course ;) )

We both enjoyed the film immensely so I decided to give it to him as a birthday gift and know that he will watch it now and then with buddies.

Where did they get Bones?  He could be a clone of the original!!  The new Kirk is INCREDIBLE!!

but....like most early star trek epoisodes,....
you gotta cut the budget somewhere,.....obviously....most of the money went to CGI.",1372809600,,374,5.114754098360656

The changes within this are explained as well in the story line.

It takes a hint from Star Wars and instead of the classic submarine drama of slow building tension with a climax of action, Abrams revision sees action from beginning to end with a top-notch story to match its non-stop action.

Well worth buying.",1372636800,,517,4.988372093023256
3470782,5,B001AVCFJM,I am an original fan and was very skeptical about this movie but absolutely loved it.  The actors were great and picked up some mannerisms from the originals but also made it their own.,1372636800,,185,4.4411764705882355

When this one came out - I admit I was sceptical, but it held it's ground.
People say it's rehashed, - maybe in a small way, let's keep in mind it IS Star Trek and changing it 360 wouldn't make it Star Trek.
I've friends that don't like it because it has different actors, I find that to be really, really lame.
Not only are most of them dead or too old to act, but if you want to move on things have to change, after all that is what life is all about and I am grateful to J.J.Abrams for keeping it going.
They will ease into their own I am sure and am looking forward to it.
I hope they keep all the same actors, specially Zachary Quinto - he is the perfect double.
They could not have found a better actor for Spock , he is perfect for the part.
While I love all the original actors and stories - I am glad that Star Trek lives on.
If People talk about Star Trek - it is because it was an extraordinary idea, one that is still valid today, and none of the Actors ( past or present) will ever be forgotten.
It's a legacy that I am all too willing to support, Live long and prosper!",1372550400,,1177,3.908333333333333

I've loved Star Trek for years (mainly next generation onward because of my age), and getting my wife into it was impossible.  That all changed with this movie, and she is now addicted.
Even my sister (who is not into scifi at all) is brought to tears in the first five minutes (and admitted it).
We all saw the newest star trek, which is very good, but having gone back and watched this one... I have to admit its much better.  It'll be hard to ever top this one.

I'm a Trekkie dating back to the original series and including every show and movie since (except ""Enterprise""... I do not care for Scott Bakula, thank you very much!) But like I said, I'm a fan of Trek from way back, and I really liked this reboot. It got me excited about these films again for the first time in years (no small thing considering the monumental let-downs some of the previous films were). It is a great introduction to the new cast, and to the circumstances that put them in the state they are in as we are re-introduced. It is different, yes, but it is still Star Trek. As a Trekkie from way back, I highly recommend it! (Plus, it's pretty much essential viewing if you plan to see ""Into Darkness"" at some point... a lot won't make much sense if you haven't seen this one first.)",1372291200,,907,4.341176470588235

The premise is genius as it allows the story to be developed differently than the original series and it's spin-offs.

If you watch the original series or ""Next Generation"" you won't get as much action or special effects, but you'll definitely get better sci-fi stories. Maybe as a series it would have had time to breathe.

*SPOILERS AHEAD

Also, I was disappointed in Spock. He was too human. In the original series you only got a glimpse of this side of him. In the film, hes oozing human imperfection, stubbornness, pride, etc. He's not Vulcan enough for me.

The villain was boring. The circumstances around him were interesting in concept, but clever ideas aren't enough. You need character development, dialogue and narrative to back it up.",1372204800,,835,4.818181818181818

3470838,4,B001AVCFJM,"I love the original Star Trek shows so...However, I liked the boldness of this new remake. Its kind of like Top Gun where the son is living in the shadows of his father. Very angry, lost, but looking for his niche and validation. Very good.",1371686400,,240,4.355555555555555
3470839,5,B001AVCFJM,It's Star Trek. I think they did a great job with this movie. The characters were very well done. It will be interesting to see what they do with this now that they've updated it.,1371686400,,179,4.142857142857143

There's lots of action and drama and its interesting to see how the younger versions of these characters act upon pressure.
I also liked that the original Spock was in this movie in segments to unite the storyline.",1371513600,,330,4.426229508196721

3470845,5,B001AVCFJM,"I grew up watching Star Trek on television (off and on) and I even saw some of the motion pictures. However, I am actually a big fan of Star Wars, as I was just 7 years old when I saw it on the big screen. I saw Star Trek Into Darkness in 3D and I just loved it so much that I turned around the next week and saw it again. This now leads me to the first Star Trek - this is a great movie and one you have to watch before seeing the current movie. Some parts of the story make more sense if you watch this movie first before seeing Into Darkness. I mainly saw this for Spock because I have always liked watching Leonard Nimoy play the role as Spock and I did not think anyone could match up to the role as well as Zachary Quinto did in the current movies. Zachary's role as Spock was spot on! If you are a fan of Star Wars and like a lot of action packed excitement, then you won't be disappointed with this movie or the next one.",1371427200,,929,3.869109947643979

3470851,4,B001AVCFJM,"I am a big fan of The Original Series, so I came to this a little skeptical and honestly worried that this was going to be The Phantom Menace 2.0, a tacky rehash ruining much of the charm of the original. While this movie lacked the deep and thought provoking content that made TOS so engaging, all of the core characters were (more or less) the same. Obviously different actors were interpreting them, but there was never a situation where I found myself thinking ""Character X would never do/say THAT!""

So, in short, I came hoping for a not awful popcorn movie, and was pleasantly surprised by a modern presentation of the original Star Trek characters.",1371340800,,655,4.646551724137931

I had to watch this one since I saw part 2 at the theaters recently and there was a scene in that one that made me wish I had watched part one. Both Star Treks are great and entertaining to watch.

3470870,4,B001AVCFJM,"Whenever a filmmaker decides to re-invent a previous series or movie, I generally cringe a little (it's rarely as good as the original).  This may be different.  J. J. Abrams brings a freshness and an update to the feeling of what we all know as Star Trek, such that the characters don't need to be compared with the earlier versions because they are different enough that we take them on their own merits.  Great movie!  Can't wait to own the sequel as well.",1371081600,,459,4.493975903614458

The movie has a lot of things conceptually that I disagree with.  However, if I put on my zen glasses like I would most action movies and just go with it, it is quite enjoyable.  I have pre-ordered the new one and look forward to watching it in my home theater (I don't go to the theaters anymore).",1370995200,,572,4.154545454545454

3470886,4,B001AVCFJM,"I love the whole Star Trek idealisms. So I'm already incline to a positive reaction. There's a lot of sarcasm in my review, but I did honestly love this movie.

To start I want to express my irritation at the lighting affects. In the special exerts, the director brags about using ""flares"" of light to make the movie more believable (I forgot the special term he used, biological?). All it did was make it look like sixties poor visual filming and irritate my eyes. I see that he did the same thing with the next movie. Agh! Many people have light sensitivities and illnesses which this will cause a problem for. Thanks a lot, Jerk!

There are lot of logistics and missings that just don't make sense. I'm not even going into the paradox of when Spok will have to try and save Romulus from the super nova in the altered reality. If he does destroy their sun, will the planet then freeze to death?

They needed to be more careful about the stupid little things. Like Spok calling Lieutenant O'Hura a lieutenant right out of cadet school. Don't they have promotions? And when the assembly gets together to make Kirk a captain there are too many people. They just lost seven ships of cadets, which I will add that no one mourned for. Did O'Hura shed a tear for her dead roommate? Was she on one of the obliterated ships?

Why didn't Valcon or Earth try to stop the drilling? Some effort would have been appreciated.

I loved the action and personal interactions of the crew. It was interesting that the altered reality needed the same people as crew and went ridiculously out there to put the crew together. They did a great job of casting. The actors seemed very natural with each other.

The melody which flows through the entire movie is very haunting. It's interesting that with different instruments they get different levels of energy. Wasn't there any money put aside for other pieces? Probably, too much was spent on flash-lights.",1370908800,,1935,4.6104651162790695
3470887,5,B001AVCFJM,I didn't see this in theatres because I watched the original series when I was younger. I didn't think I'd like it. I watched it and really enjoyed it. I recommend it to any sci-fi fan.,1370908800,,185,4.166666666666667

Unlike the current crop of television productions I could and did understand the actors speaking level, their voice projection, and their pronunciation.  Television productions, one example being ""Falling Skies"", I rate very low because I cannot hear and understand what the actors are saying.  Given this major problem with television productions, even when they appear to have an interesting story line and fair video, although they are often visually to dark to tell what is going on because of poor lighting techniques, we gave up even trying to follow such series productions.  Even the voices in the series Premiere this week were so poor we gave up and stopped watching.

3470900,5,B001AVCFJM,"Star Trek is an extraordinary film on every level. Satisfying both longtime fans and tepid newcomers alike to the series, Director J.J. Abrams' vision of Gene Roddenberry's future is a dazzling achievement of filmmaking, special effects, and story, not to mention a perfect rekindling of a sadly dormant franchise. While Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho, and Anton Yelchin will never replace William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForrest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, James Doohan, George Takei, and Walter Koenig, there is no doubt they can co-exist. With an impeccable cast; wonderful special effects; a dramatic, far-reaching, and emotional story that doesn't rely on action but rather integrates it perfectly into the film; infectious humor; and spot-on odes to the original stories and characters that define the ""Star Trek"" universe, 2009's Star Trek is a passionate rebirth, a resurrection for the ages, and it boldly and confidently goes where ""Star Trek"" must to endure. Paramount's Blu-ray release of Star Trek is, like the film, mesmerizing. Featuring impeccable picture and sound quality, not to mention a complete, thoroughly informative, and consistently entertaining supplemental package, Star Trek receives my highest recommendation.

3470918,5,B001AVCFJM,"More a 4.5 or solid B+

The first time I watched this (2010), I didn't note any flaws in the film. The second time (May 2013), I wanted my husband to watch it with me so we could see the new one. Husband isn't big on SF and gets hives from anything that makes him think of Will Shatner. :D So I was watching part me (SF lover) and part him. With that distance, I did find the introduction of a couple of canon characters pretty artificial and pandering. And (IMO) earth accents will be eliminated by then (consider how much ""accent"" has already been homogenized because of television and radio) or at least considerably toned down, so there was no good reason for the accents of Bones, McCoy and Chekov other than pandering to the original series (and Chekov's accent was too-too much). For the final negative, Karl Urban, whom I love to drool over, overplayed Bones if evaluated under modern conventions. Let's face it, the original Trek was pretty campy at times and Urban brought that over to his portrayal Bones.

But everything else was positive IMO - great visual capture, both the jokes and scientific dialogue are accessible to the audience, great sets and costume design, and so on.",1370563200,,1191,4.613207547169812
3470919,4,B001AVCFJM,"Very nice presentation - the audio is sharp and clear and the video likewise. For extras, the audio commentary is good and reveals minor highlights and inclusions that perhaps went unnoticed. The only drawback or failing, in my opinion, is the lack of an inside booklet or even a glossy 2-sided card. Still, the main thing is the movie, and for the (discounted) price, it's well worth it.",1370476800,,388,4.720588235294118

3470921,5,B001AVCFJM,"This movie was like many of the other remakes I had heard about in the last dozen years.  A ""re-boot"" as they like to call them, trying to breath life back into a franchise.  Also, much like the others they are using the same names and doing about the same things, but, unlike the others, this time with Star Trek they hit a home run.  This is still a Kirk and Spock tale, same kind of characters just modified circumstances around them growing up and choices they might have made had they decided to go left instead of right.  The premise is that a time traveler changed something in the past that had a ripple effect through the whole universe, the Butterfly effect in a way.

I thought this was really well done, the names and the personalities are about the same but it is like seeing a beloved characters with a different background story.  Do good people grow up to be good guys if they don't have the same background, same no, similar yes.  It was fun and I am looking forward to the next installment, worth the time to watch and in my opinion worth adding to the collection.",1370476800,,1082,4.353233830845771

I was delighted by the actors standing in for the young Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Spock (Quinto is fabulous!) and, of course, Kirk. All (especially Simon Pegg) are perfect. And don't listen to critics of the sequel, ""Into Darkness"" -- it's just as fun (and, often, funny) as this one! I am awaiting number 3....",1370476800,,467,4.7073170731707314
3470925,5,B001AVCFJM,"Terrific addition to the Star Trek franchise. Casting for the main characters is very well done, particularly Chris Pine as a young Captain Kirk. I couldn't t help but laugh as the actors picked up on the idiosynchs of the 60s characters with perfect tongue in cheek. The story line is exciting, and is an informative prequel. I had only one objection..the space/time connection between young Spock and old..trying to figure the logic of these sequences requires a Vulcan brain and perhaps a mind meld. Special effects are worth the price of admission.",1370476800,,552,4.946236559139785

3470949,5,B001AVCFJM,"First things first, I loved this movie. But I've found out that your opinion on this movie will change based on how much of a trekkie you are. Most are attracted to the Star Trek universe because of the cerebral and based-more-in-reality-than-star-wars feel.
So if you are a dyed in the wool, born a trekkie die a trekkie, you may be slightly disappointed (or so i've heard).
That being said don't write this movie off. It is entertaining, the script is awesome and the modern actors given the task of living up to the legends do a very good job.

For the rest of us who are confused over the controversy you will see a very good movie set in an amazing world with interesting characters. Regardless of your background and experience (or lack of) with Star Trek definitely give this movie a shot. It is well worth it.

As a long time Star Trek fan, I thoroughly enjoyed the 2009 ""Star Trek"" and felt that the characters were superbly cast, but I have a few criticisms.  James Kirk was portrayed as too much of a rebel, hotdog, and hothead type figure.  The way he provoked Spock into attacking him was just over the top.  Although I was okay with Spock displaying emotion, his openly kissing Uhura just before he was beamed onto Nero's ship was too much.

3470967,4,B001AVCFJM,"Until i heard about Into Darkness coming out i never watched a Star trek episode in my life, in fact even after that i only really watch ""The Next Generation"" so i have very little insight as to how this works as a ""Star Trek"" movie (apart from knowing various little things like Bones motto of ""Dammit man I'm a doctor not a...."") but as an ""Action Movie"" it's almost spot-on, it's got explosions, lasers, fist fights, chase scene but then it's also got character development, tension, comic relief, moments of happiness. It's just a straight up good movie.

-:SPOILERS:-
The only reason i don't give this movie a 5 star rating is because of the bad guy, his motivations are shoddy at best and everything after the destruction of Vulcan makes absolutely no sense. Like where he's interrogating Captain Pike and he says ""I watched it happen, i saw it happen, don't tell me it didn't happen"" yet he is obviously fully aware that he is in the past now and that Romulus is perfectly safe for the next like 100 some years but still he has to have his vendetta.

Apart from that, damn good movie!

P.S go see the sequel, so much badassary it is almost unfathomable that they managed to cram it all into one movie",1370131200,,1207,4.4772727272727275

You have a generic villain with a generic name who goes back in time to blow up Vulcan because he blames it for his his home being destroyed.
Now wait, if he is from the future, he would already know what happened and prevented it, and not blame Vulcan which was innocent,
but wait!! I for got he is mad, because he Nero. This is a clear sign of a hack director and writing.

The crew look like a bunch of uppity metrosexuals trying to imitate the original actors, who looked way more real than this crap.

You had lame lines, for instance, the young Kirk who yells out his full name. Who does that? What kid in this time or any other talks like that.
Uhura is basically ship whore and has a relationship with Spock which makes no sense.
Jar Jar Abrams basically took everything that was cool about the original crew movies and made a mockery of it.
From the Kobyashi Maru test to Kirk being Captain.
Sorry Abrams, but lense flares, pretty cgi and explosions do not make a Star Trek movie. Star Trek was more than that.

3470982,4,B001AVCFJM,Being a Trekkie from way back in the 70s it was fun to see the genesis of the featured characters. Plot line a little thin but it didn't matter since the acting was great.,1370044800,,171,4.0588235294117645
3470983,5,B001AVCFJM,"I'm an unabashed Star Trek fan. I found this movie to have the best of the old and the new. A great new cast still true to the old characters, great modern special effects (and lots of them) and best of all a script true to the positive, affirming approach that is Star Trek.
Yes, there is one point where, having failed to build all the necessary back-story into the script the ""original"" Spock gives a long narrative speech (Yawn!). And the makeup on one green-skinned roommate is completely unbelievable, but in my book this flick still gets 5 stars for all the ""extra Star Trek goodness"" including Simon Pegg as Scotty, and great performances of Spock (both versions), and the new Lt. U.
But in the end, its not the special effects but this film's ability to carry forward Star Trek's positive tale of individuals and goodness triumphant that makes it a 5 star movie.",1370044800,,871,4.589743589743589

I thought for sure that I couldn't be satisfied by this modern interpretation, but I was wrong. Presented is some interesting ""Pre Enterprise"" history of the characters. The story line was true Roddenberry style, and I was absorbed by it in minutes. By the end I was a solid ""Fan"" of this film, and am anxious to see the latest ""Star Trek"" film out there. I recommend it to any Trek people. It was entertaining and fun to watch.",1369958400,,551,4.359223300970874

I love the science, all of the ridiculous plot lines, aliens with stupid forehead prosthetics, and the interactions between the characters. It's the two most important, the interactions between the characters and the ridiculous plotlines, that this movie gets right. Yes, there's a lot differences from the ""prime"" universe; but the core of Star Trek is definitely in here in a well-paced, quick, and witty movie.

Plus, I don't really know what kind of equipment you need to create a matter/antimatter reaction. Maybe it does look like a brewery (although I doubt it).",1369958400,,734,4.919354838709677

I was a little shocked at the new Romulan look, being a fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation, but viewers have to keep in mind this is an ""updated"" take on the Star Wars series. If you are willing to accept the character nuances, then you'll love it.",1369785600,,419,4.2375

3470998,5,B001AVCFJM,"Given that we have seen the original stars of Star Trek get older and older over the intervening years of sequels, it is quite logical that they would have to go to the early beginnings of the life of Spock and Kirk in order to make a new dynamic movie.  The producers have done remarkably well and the new Spock is almost a dead ringer for the old Spock.  Thumbs up for this movie.

3471033,5,B001AVCFJM,"""Star Trek"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: The fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of bitter rivals. One, James Kirk, is a delinquent, thrill-seeking Iowa farm boy. The other, Spock, was raised in a logic-based society that rejects all emotion. As fiery instinct clashes with calm reason, their unlikely but powerful partnership is the only thing capable of leading their crew through unimaginable danger, boldly going where no one has gone before.

The cast led by Chris Pine (as James T. Kirk), Zachary Quinto (as Spock), Leonard Nimoy (as Old Spock), Eric Bana (as Nero), Bruce Greenwood (as Captain Christopher Pike), Karl Urban (as Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy), Zoe Saldana (as Uhura), Simon Pegg (as Scotty), John Cho (as Sulu), & Anton Yelchin (as Chekov) is excellent! The directing by J.J. Abrams (also produced) (who also directed and produced and co-wrote the story and screenplay to ""Mission: Impossible III"" (2006) is excellent! The story and screenplay by Robert Orci & Alex Kurtzman (both also executive produced) (both who co-wrote the story and screenplay to ""Mission: Impossible III"", they also wrote the story and screenplay to ""Transformers"" (2007) & the upcoming ""Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen"" (2009), both which were directed by Michael Bay) is excellent!

The music by Michael Giacchino (who also did the music to ""Mission: Impossible III"", he also did the music to the upcoming ""Up"" (2009) & ""Land Of The Lost"" (2009) is excellent! The cinematography by Daniel Mindel (who also did the cinematography to ""Mission: Impossible III"") is excellent! The film editing by Maryann Brandon & Mary Jo Markey (both who also did the film editing to ""Mission: Impossible III"") is excellent! The casting by April Webster (who also did the casting to ""Mission: Impossible III"") & Alyssa Weisberg (who also did the casting to ""Cloverfield"" (2008, which Abrams produced) & the upcoming ""Piranha 3D"" (2010) is excellent! The production design by Scott Chambliss (who also did the production design to ""Mission: Impossible III"" & the upcoming ""Salt"" (2010) is excellent! The art direction by Curt Beech (who was an assistant art director on ""Mission: Impossible III"" & the upcoming ""Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen""), Dennis Bradford (who also did the art direction to ""Mission: Impossible III"" & the upcoming ""Nailed"" (2009), Keith P. Cunningham (supervising art director) (who also did the art direction to ""Zodiac"" (2007), Luke Freeborn (who also did the art direction to ""Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull"" (2008) & the upcoming ""Angels & Demons"" (2009), Beat Frutiger (who also did the art direction to ""Transformers"", ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" (2007), & ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" (2003) & Gary Kosko (who also did the art direction to ""Mission: Impossible III"") is excellent! The set decoration by Karen Manthey (who also did the set decoration to ""Mission: Impossible III"") is excellent! The costume design by Michael Kaplan (who also did the costume design to ""I Am Legend"" (2007) & the upcoming ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" (2010) is excellent!

This is an impressive and brilliant reboot of the ""Star Trek"" movies and the original 1966-69 television series.

3471048,3,B001AVCFJM,"I am a huge Star Trek fan, though I wouldn't call myself a trekkie. That being said, this movie just seemed like a caricature of the ST universe. I think part of the problem is that with all the other ST movies, I was already acquainted with the actors from their long running tv shows. These guys and gals just seemed to have come out of nowhere and they're stepping in shoes that they didn't earn. They frankly don't have the screen presence of the real McCoys, (and Kirks and Spocks).
Even the Enterprise, as impressive as it looked outside, it never felt like I was on the Enterprise. I have the complete box sets of TOS and STTNG and they do an excellent job off creating the starship atmosphere. This movie doesn't even seem to want to do that.

3471051,4,B001AVCFJM,"Star Trek (2009). Rated ""PG-13"". Running Time: 2 hours, 06 mins.
This is the 11th movie in the film series.
The new movie, Star Trek (2009), was an event that I had to invite my family to see. I have been a fan of ""Star Trek"" since the original 1966-69 tv series was in syndication in the 1970's.
  The movie begins with Captain Robau (Faran Tahir) in a dire emergency situation aboard the USS Kelvin. So that he does not endanger his crew he asks George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth) to take command. As Captain Robau travels into Nero's Romulan spaceship, he is conquered and killed by Nero (Eric Bana). As George Kirk is in command on the bridge, he makes sure everyone is evacuated, including his wife, Winona (Jennifer Morrison), who is giving birth as he speaks to her by communication. He chooses not to leave the bridge and stays in command in the captain's chair. He asks his wife details and knows he had a son and names him, James Tiberius Kirk, before he is thrown into the air and the USS Kelvin explodes.
  The evil Nero and his crew have been sent through a black hole in a time alteration.
We are treated to a time when James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), Dr. McCoy, (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) are in Starfleet Academy training and about to begin their first mission with Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) aboard the Enterprise.
 I believe this story takes place 9 to 12 years after the story of the first STAR TREK pilot, The Cage.
 Dr. McCoy manages to sneak Kirk onboard the Enterprise, while Uhura talks Spock (Zachary Quinto) into letting her board the Enterprise.
  On this mission, it becomes a power of minds between Pike (Bruce Greenwood), Spock and Kirk. Captain Pike ends up getting captured by Nero and that puts Spock in command. Kirk and Spock have it out and literally have a physical fight. Kirk is ordered off the ship. Cadet Kirk ends up up on a snowy terrain and is chased by a creature (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield-Blu-ray/dp/B00AEFXNGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield [Blu-ray</a>]) and ultimately into a cave.  In this cave, he meets a man. The man recognizes him as ""Jim"". It is the older ""Spock"" (Leonard Nimoy) who explains how he was caught up in time. He takes Kirk to a Starfleet Base where we meet the younger Montgomery Scott (Simon Pegg), whom Spock fondly called ""Scotty"". Spock explains to them what they should do and how they must make things right again. If successful, everything will be the way it should be.

Also in the cast: Ben Cross as ""Serek"", Winona Ryder as ""Amanda"", Clifton Collins Jr, Tyler Perry, Jason Brooks, Christopher Doohan, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Morrison, Amanda Foreman, Jonathan Dixon, Tony Guma, Deep Roy, Jason Matthew Smith, Akiva Goldsman, Charles Haugk, Max Chernov, Jesper Inglis, Gerald W. Abrams, James McGrath, Kasia Kowalczyk, Bryan Lee, Wesley Nguyen.

 Chris Doohan is the son of the late James Doohan (""Scotty""). In this film, he appears with Simon Pegg as ""Scotty"" as his human assistant in the transporter room.

 Majel Barrett was the voice of the computer for the last time. She passed away on December 18, 2008, just 2 weeks after recording her voice-over. She was the wife of Gene Roddenberry (creator of Star Trek) and she appeared in the very first Star Trek pilot episode, The Cage, as ""Number One"" and in the original 1966-69 tv series as ""Nurse Chapel"" and in Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-94) as ""Lwaxana Troi"".

First of all, my thanks to J.J.

Some scenes with Leonard Nimoy brought back the spirit of ""Star Trek"" for me.

 The time-travel alteration makes one Trekkie confused. The beginning romance between Spock and Uhura? Never happened in the original.
 ""Pavel Chekov"" did not make his first appearance in the original STAR TREK until Season 2.
  Spock's mother, ""Amanda"", could not have possibly died as she (then played by Jane Wyatt) was with her son, ""Spock"", in the original tv series episode ""Journey To Babel"" in 1967 and in the movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-IV-The-Voyage-Home/dp/B000HZGNEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</a>&nbsp;(1986).

 Nichelle Nichols suggested playing Uhura's grandmother, but it could not be written in due to the Writer's Guild Strike at the time.

Star Trek 14: As of April 2018, Paramount has chosen female director, S. J. Clarkson, for the first time. In a time travel story, Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) will meet his father, George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth). No production date nor release date yet.

The film afterwards:
 Paramount is looking at Quentin Tarantino's story idea with screenwriter Mark L. Smith.  He wants the movie to be Rated R. William Shatner, Patrick Stewart and John Cho have shown interest.
  Simon Pegg is also writing a sequel script of his own.",1369267200,,6513,5.174618320610687
3471052,5,B001AVCFJM,"All the characters were younger believable versions from the original Star Trek series.  The characters stayed true to form.  The plot was amazing and when a movie is over with that quickly, you know it got and held your attention in a good way.",1369267200,,245,4.545454545454546
3471053,1,B001AVCFJM,"First of all, Amazon's streaming was perfectly fine. That is not why I am giving this 1 star. I just thought this movie sucked. Spoilers Ahead.

I love Star Trek - but this movie was just awful. J.J. Abrams, When your version of Star Trek is *less progressive* than the version from 1960s US television, then YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG. Not that Roddenberry's (original Trek creator) work was perfect in a social justice sense, but he really did try to promote a progressive vision of race and wrote some groundbreaking roles. He tried to push gender limits as well, with less success: the pilot version having a female officer as second in command, women in pants, etc. All changed for the series at the bequest of 1960s TV producers, but the seeds were certainly there.*

It makes me really, really sad to see the series being ripped from those roots. J.J.'s version paints a picture of an atavistic, sexist future, where white men still hold all of the control, people of color play minor (and stereotyped) roles, and women are relegated to non-speaking roles, incompetence (or competence that is only alluded to, and never SHOWN), and mini-skirts.

If you think I'm joking, consider the few women who actually have SPEAKING LINES in this movie. The three female characters of ""significance"" were insignificant  one gave birth, one was a mother, and one was a girlfriend. Another female with speaking lines was put on screen so Kirk could have sex with her. Great.

Zoe Saldana had the biggest female part playing Lt. Uhura - a gifted linguistic specialist who discovers an important signal yet is relegated to window dressing.  Why couldn't they give her something cool to do that showed off her skills? And why does Uhura have to bully Spock into giving her a position she is qualified to get? Yes, a communications officer rarely goes on away missions unless one is needed for some sticky piece of communications and the ability to coordinate messages both onboard ship and between ships is very important, especially in a combat situation. YET, in this film I feel like we were just told by the expository powers that be: Uhura is really smart without anything to back that up in action; the only job we got to see her do was nurse Spock who seems to have a rather striking number of mommy issues.

Uhura being Spocks lover is not inherently bad - what is disturbing is the fact that Spock doesnt respect her and as an audience member you don't get to see her do anything else. You know what would have made me happy? Instead of Kirk being an incredibly creepy voyeuristic- pervert and us hearing Uhura talk about how she did this really difficult piece of communications work, why not just have a scene showing us Uhura in action translating different strains of Klingon and Romulan communications? Isnt that the old adage of story-telling, more show less tell? That scene would have been so cool. If I had seen that scene and then seen Spock assign her to the Enterprise without a blink and then watched her be all nurturer extraordinaire I would have loved this movie so much more, I would actually be excited and filled with hope at the prospect of a sequel (which was also terrible, by the way, but for different reasons). But no. J.J. Abrams decided it would be better if Kirk got it on with an Orion woman and then peeped in on Uhura innocently changing clothes. Lovely.

The special effects and music were good, but special effects and music cannot carry a movie - especially whose beginnings were  rooted in social justice and enlightenment. Instead, we audience members just get the same old crap, wrapped up in some space-y special effects. I'd skip this one, if I were you.

*And yes, I know the original Star Trek was sexist, but it wasn't trying to be. It was trying to be enlightened, albeit failing miserably by modern standards. But the trying is what matters. The new Star Trek movie is the first time in the history of the franchise that the Star Trek world is depicted as less enlightened than the present-day world.",1369267200,9,4039,4.6840620592383635

I will enjoy watching this periodically as I do with all things Trek.",1369267200,,353,4.086956521739131
3471055,5,B001AVCFJM,"You should know these things before reading this review:

I never grew up on Star Trek. In fact, I had not seen an entire episode or movie prior to this. My familiarity with the preexisting series was very limited.

Now that the qualifying remarks are out of the way, let's get down to it.

This is a wonderful movie. It has everything you could want from a film these days, much less what you'd want from a sci-fi flick. We have a great cast, an excellent script, a moving score, and an exciting vision from J.J. Abrams.

I think the script and actors are the linchpins. There is some great dialogue that might fail under other actors, and the script puts our characters in a high stakes adventure. For the full visceral effect, M. Giacchino's score both underscores and comes alive in all the right moments.

There are plenty of synopses out there; thus, I won't bother.

But I just wanted to add my two cents because I enjoyed it so much.

So, if you want to know if this film is worth your time, it definitely is. And more.",1369267200,,1027,4.373684210526315

3471062,5,B001AVCFJM,"Director J.J. Abrams and his cast ensemble manage to both channel the most compelling character aspects of the original series cast, while creating new openings for ""Star Trek:  The Next-Next Generation.""  A notable departure from TOS is that Kirk, as portrayed by Chris Pine, is a much more vulnerable and fallible figure.  But this is appropriate, since the film starts with his youth, in which Kirk has made a series of poor life decisions that eventually lead to his impulsive choice to join Starfleet.

  The rest, as they say, is ""history,"" but this is an ""open history"" in which Kirk may develop as a very different character than the one portrayed by Shatner in TOS.  For Chris Pine, I imagine that this prospect might be a bit daunting, as: a) living up to the Kirk character that Shatner popularized isn't necessarily part of the agenda; and b) Pine might worry about becoming ""pigeonholed"" or ""typecast"" as Kirk, given the enormity of the Star Trek fan base.

  From my own perspective, I would be very happy if Pine embraced the role of Kirk and developed it through a series of movies.  I would also be happy to see a new TV series at some point--but with the great writing and production values exhibited by the ""reboot"" of Battlestar Galactica.  It would be fantastic if Pine, Quinto, and their peers would be willing to offer us such a gift.

  In any case, the first of the ""new"" Star Trek movies was a great success, and I look forward to the latest film, ""Into Darkness""!",1369267200,,1490,4.633587786259542

I was *thrilled* with this movie.  It wasn't perfect and there were some questionable and even laughable moments in the storyline, as well as a plot hole or three, some things that changed from the canon that I did NOT like, but overall, I liked the film so much I bought it on Amazon Instant Video as soon as I finished watching it.

3471091,5,B001AVCFJM,J.J. Abrams has done an excellent job portraying the new revolution of the Star Trek franchise! If you like Star Trek you are going to LOVE this movie! Now I can't wait for Into Darkness to be released!,1369008000,,202,4.342105263157895

3471093,5,B001AVCFJM,"Wow. The actors are able to display characteristics of their future characters without making caricatures. The plot is good, the action is fast, and if you have any affection for Spock's character at all, you'll love this.
The characters of McCoy, Scottie, and Chekhov foreshadow their adult characters wonderfully. Uhura is over serious, but her character is featured, which sort of makes up for how she didn't get enough screenplay in the series. You don't get much humor with Sulu, but he does get to 'fence'. You will like that.",1368921600,,532,4.9222222222222225

3471095,5,B001AVCFJM,"I was watching Kirk, McCoy, and Spock on Sunday reruns as a kid.  I still enjoy seeing all the films and original episodes.  I had absolutely no issues with the liberties taken with this reboot.  There were tragic moments and laugh-out-loud moments.  I especially liked Scotty ""anyone got a towel?""  The set designs were fantastic, including the beer making plant--uh--engine room with tubes, tanks, pumps and pipes.  The old engine room was a hallway with some fluroescent tube lights hehehehe.  Sulu was awesome too--I loved the whole cast.  It's hard to think of Winona Rider as Spock's mommy, but she was brilliant.  Even Tyler Perry gets in the act and presides over the academy.  I own the DVD and have viewed it many times.  Great film!",1368921600,,743,4.817460317460317
3471096,5,B001AVCFJM,"We watched this with my teenage daughter on this past Friday evening, who hadn't seen it, prior to seeing the new Star Trek - Into Darkness on early Saturday morning.  The young James Tiberius Kirk is perfectly cast with Chris Pine as the young Jim and Zachary Quinn as the young Spock.

Plus the screenwriter's throw a slew of metaphors from Bones, just like the series.  When I saw the series as a young kid, these metaphors were a learning experience for mind, now they a just hilarious.

So, if you're planning to see the new Star Trek movie and haven't seen this original in a while, by all means watch it before you see the new one...",1368921600,,640,4.398305084745763

This one was good fun to watch, young Spock/ old Spock, seeing young Kirk, etc.  I would have enjoyed it a bit more if there had been a more substantial plot and a few less gratuitous fight scenes, but I guess that's what showcases the special effects best and make the most money!  I would probably watch it again just to see if I had missed any of the inside jokes on the first viewing.  This movie would definitely be best appreciated by someone who is familiar with the original Star Trek series, as there are a lot of references back to those characters and events, naturally.",1368748800,2,719,4.303703703703704

The action and graphics are so much better now, of course, but the idea of warp speed space travel and possibility of varied life forms in the universe always made Star Trek an adventure to love.

3471121,2,B001AVCFJM,"Alternate reality or not, this film is not true to the fabric that made the original Star Trek the benchmark and the inimitable saga of the quest to go where no man had gone before. It just seems way off target and all wrong. This is not thinking man's science fiction. It is simply an unbridled and aimless action film with no clear dramatic cohesive elements. The characters' names have renamed the same, but little else was retained. The biggest disappointment and actually quite annoying was the alternate version of Spock. Zachary Quinto's Spock is all wrong. His portrayal of Spock is downright weird. It was absolutely fantastic to see Leonard Nimoy return as Spock from the original plane of reality. In effect this shows just wrong the concept of this film feels. Karl Urban performance as McCoy was somewhat successful and he did try to throwback to the original concept of the character. Bruce Greenwood as Captain Pike fared best. I think this is just an awful film. With the exception of Leonard Nimoy, Karl Urban and Bruce Greenwood the entire cast acts like they had a chip on their shoulder. They are rude, loud, and arrogant and constantly play a game of one-upmanship with everyone they interact with. This is not Star Trek.",1368576000,2,1242,4.78139534883721

3471123,5,B001AVCFJM,"To say I really loved this Star Trek movie would be an understatement.  Action from beginning to end with a pretty good story line to boot.  Of course, it stretches what is plausible and possible, but, hey, it's Sci-fi - what seems like fiction now could be the truth in the future.  Who is to say?  I enjoyed seeing the start of several Star Fleet officers' careers (some of my old favorites, since I grew up watching the original Star Trek in the '60s) - like Captain James T. Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, Sulu, Chekhov, Uhura - to name a few.  Also, linking the old (Spock) with the new was fun.  There is much time travel in science fiction (in case you have not noticed - LOL).

3471127,5,B001AVCFJM,"JJ Abrams version of this iconic series was a glowing success as he managed to bring to life the personalities of the original cast while giving the series a much needed face lift along the way. Chris Pine delivered a strong performance as Captain James T Kirk by portraying the sometimes overly confident, but fearless leader of the USS Enterprise. The pleasant surprise was the depth of which actor Karl Urban delivered Kirk's emotional and often times insubordinate medical chief Leonard ""Bonds"" McCoy. This movies delivers the depth of character to welcome home the tried and proven fans of the franchise, but was able to modernize and create a new vision for those who are new to the series. The blend of old and new did not disappoint and sets the series up for a strong run for the next decade.",1368576000,,801,4.6879432624113475

That said, I was skeptical that anyone could play a young Captain James Tiberius Kirk embodying the characteristics of Kirk as well as Chris Pine ultimately did while he still made the role his own.  He was great and I hope William Shatner agreed.  I feel the same way about the rest of the crew.  I totally enjoyed it and am now looking forward to the new movie coming out this week!",1368489600,,557,4.168224299065421

3471157,1,B001AVCFJM,"I enjoy different genres of movies, though of course I love Star Trek. This however, is unwatchable for far too many reasons to list here. Let's try, the acting overall with few exceptions; Leonard Nimoy,Karl Urban, Simon Pegg are horrible. It was tedious watching Pine act as a petulant boy, Shatner was himself as Kirk, Pine tries to be Shatner acting as Kirk, Chekov is unbearable just mute him when you can.
 The lighting or whatever he calls it is quite annoying. There's no real story, Star Trek aside it's a ridiculous idea. It's made for low thinking people who enjoy noise more than substance. For all the rave reviews, remember ""reality Shows"" rule the airwaves.

3471158,4,B001AVCFJM,"While some fans have problems with alternate timeline stories in the Star Trek universe, I'm OK with it. For the most part, it solves certain problems for writers who have the challenge of staying 100% consistent with 30 years worth of story-telling. Now I've watched this movie maybe ten times, which might be a little obsessive, but mostly I watch it for the score, which is terrific, the incredible deep space f/x, and the interplay between Spock, Kirk and McCoy. J.J.A's take on the crew of the original series is inspired, and the actors do a terrific job channeling testosterone out of my all-time favorite space adventure characters. Yes, there are a few logic holes -- and planet killer scenarios have gotten a bit blase, but this isn't so much a scifi movie with a great story as it is a vehicle for establishing the starting point for the franchise's next three to six movies. Hopefully, stories will be more important in the future, and less emphasis will be placed on OCD terrorists or revenge seekers. Abrams and others need to look at how the Borg resuscitated the Generations franchise and maybe find something other than an evil, twisted antagonist to hang their hats on.",1368057600,2,1187,4.795121951219512

There were no scenes of their schooling at the academy.",1368057600,,258,4.666666666666667
3471160,2,B001AVCFJM,"Despite the fact that there are over 1800 reviews for 2009's STAR TREK on here already, I feel compelled to add my opinion that this movie is a big disappointment. OK, it's got good production values, with nice special effects and a good cast. I'm not surprised that it's popular with most younger non-Star Trek fans. But the best of all the Star Trek incarnations have had good, thoughtful stories giving us a hopeful future for humanity. What is the basic story in this movie? A renegade Romulan is trying to destroy the planet Vulcan by sinking a black hole into it, and the Enterprise has to stop him. From that point on it's over-the-top action with no positive vision for the future at all. Forget about interesting science fiction concepts! Some people have said that the story of this movie does not matter much since it's primarily establishing the characters for future movies. But what good are characters if there's no interesting story? Not much.

Further, the glaring inconsistencies with previous Star Treks makes this movie unacceptable to me as a long-time fan of the show. Other reviewers have gone over much of this, but the ones that are most glaring to me are 1)most of the original cast being on the Enterprise under Captain Pike, 2)Ensign Chekov being navigator under Captain Pike when he took that role in the original Trek's second season under Captain Kirk, 3)Spock's mother dying when Spock is a young officer under Pike. What about ""Journey to Babel"" from the original series (TOS)? 4)Spock saying ""not this time"" when Kirk suggests being compassionate to the Romulans, 5)Spock and Uhura having a hot romance going (sorry, ""Amok Time"" from TOS is ignored too), and 6)the design of the bridge and other parts of the Enterprise looking nothing like it did in TOS's pilot episode, ""The Cage"" when Pike was captain.

Supposedly these discrepancies with earlier Star Treks are explained by Nero's destruction of the timeline, thus creating a parallel universe that we see in the movie, but that too is inconsistent with Star Trek's use of time in past series and movies, and also many of these discrepancies exist before Nero's actions or would not be explained by a timeline change. To explain what I mean by it being an inconsistency, in the TOS episode ""City On the Edge of Forever"" Star Trek's concept of time is made clear when McCoy went back to the past and makes a substantial change, which caused the future to vanish. His actions did NOT create an alternate universe as happens in this movie. I don't believe that anyone understands time well enough to say which result would actually happen if we could travel back in time and make some big change, but this movie's concept of time is NOT the established Star Trek concept of time. As far as I know, and I DON'T know all the Star Trek episodes of the more recent TV series, I believe that Star Trek has adhered to that basic concept of time as set forth in the original series. Until 2009's STAR TREK.

At any rate, even if I am wrong that this movie violates Star Trek's established use of time, should fans accept these huge changes to Star Trek history, even IF this movie's explanation of those changes makes sense? I say NO!! I speculate that the director and writers and producer of this movie really didn't want to make a ""Star Trek"" movie AT ALL, yet they HAD to because they were commissioned to make a Star Trek movie. Therefore, they took a basic Star Trek background then went off in their own direction.

Some other aspects of this movie also bother me. For one, I agree with the reviewers who see it as absurd that Kirk is made captain of the Enterprise at the end of this movie. Not only is he depicted here as impulsive and arrogant, but he has no experience as an officer and has not even graduated from Star Fleet Academy! Another scene that I found to be unreasonable was the one where Spock nearly strangled Kirk to death on the bridge. After such an incident of out-of-control rage, Spock should have been removed as captain. In the original Star Trek series, the only time that Spock displayed such a lack of self-control (in ""Amok Time,"" ""This Side of Paradise,"" and ""All Our Yesterdays"") was when he was under the influence of forces beyond his control. Another problem with the scene where Spock nearly strangled Kirk to death is that a large group of crew members just STOOD THERE AND WATCHED!! Finally, Spock's father calmly says, ""Spock"" and everyone lets Spock decide whether he's going to kill Kirk or not. I can understand the dramatic desire to have Spock make the decision of what he will do, but it's not reasonable that all those people would just stand there and let him kill Kirk.

The next Trek movie is coming out in about a week, again directed by J.J. Abrams as this one was. Unless I hear good explanations that it's a lot better than 2009's STAR TREK, I'm not going to go see it. (Update - I didn't go see it.)",1367971200,2,4937,4.618451025056948

That said. No one will ever play Capt. Kirk better than William Shatner. No one will ever play Mr. Spock like Leonard Nimoy. A lime will never be a lemon. A wolf will never be a lion. Change the name of the movie to something else or rename the characters but left like it is it doesn't even look like the original Star Trek looked. The original Star Trek was made back in the 60's. Make the special effects look like those effects did back in the 60's. If I'm going to make a movie based on life in the 1950's, I'm not going to put a 2013 Cadillac in it as a car they drove back then. As a science fiction movie goes I liked it. As a Star Trek movie goes. Garbage, Garbage, Garbage.",1367971200,2,849,4.120481927710843
3471162,5,B001AVCFJM,"I must say for someone that really didn't care for any of the previous Star Trek films, I am happy to say- this movie totally blew me away. The acting was excellent. I was really happy to see Eric Bana (Munich) playing a really nasty bad guy, and a cameo by Winona Ryder as well. This updated version that explains how Capt. Kirk and crew came to be, hardly resembles any of the much weaker previous Star Trek films. The special effects were spectacular and often reached the stature of effects used for films like the Star Wars episodes I, II, & III. There was plenty of funny moments that kept me laughing pretty hard too, and some unexpected updates that might catch you by suprise. Here we see a more human side of Spock that was sometimes really hysterical. Though I admit not caring so much for the whole Star Trek craze much of my life, I can give a massive thumbs up for a really exciting ride with this latest Star Trek movie. I liked it so much that I will be purchasing the film on dvd when it get's released. This movie was far better than I expected to be. A great deal of fun to watch, especially if you see it at an Imax theater like I did.",1367971200,2,1155,4.207207207207207
3471163,4,B001AVCFJM,"I would give this movie 5 stars, but I felt there was something missing. The feel of the old Star Trek, the honest human element of reason. All of which Gene Roddenbury gave us in his Star Trek. I know those were low or no budget and they had to fill the show with something, so they went the cheap way. But, that was an element of hope and clarity for the future or humankind.  I have watched Star Trek since I was a young child, I met Deforest Kelly, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, George Taki, and James Doohan at various conventions when I was younger. Sometimes more than once. My point is, I was addicted to the show and the shows that came after. All four series were excellent in their own right. This movie while it is lacking that something, is excellent too, in it's own right. All right, I hear the ""Boo's"" already, and you probably think I am either on crack or nuts. I get it. Well, the nut's is debatable, but, I assure you I am quite sober. I read some of the reviews, and I feel that the reviewers missed something. We are no longer in the 60's, the 80's, the 90's etc. And there is something that Star Trek has always been, a reflection of the current political, social, and overall mindset of the time period. True there has always been a message that Gene Roddenberry has given us. That message is lacking here. Going into this movie expecting to see the Gene Roddenberry Star Trek is like expecting ""Enterprise"" to be a remake of the original Star Trek. It just isn't so. I loved this movie as a movie that took place in the Star Trek universe. Was it perfect, NO! But, it certainly had merit. And, I remind you, that we had not seen anything new ""Star Trek"" related in years prior to this movie. So, those of you who did not like the movie, I understand. Perhaps if you gave it a chance based solely on the fact that it does take place in the Star Trek universe, you might enjoy it. Those of you who see the merit in this movie lets hope they keep making these movies so that maybe we will get a Star Trek TV series out of the franchise.

He has fashioned an excellent summer blockbuster out of an age old, fan driven franchise. He makes it easy for non-fans, like myself, to step into this world. The action, comedy, drama all hit home in this film with a perfect balance of each. The acting is superb and make these characters more than just a cardboard cut outs of the originals.

3471202,5,B001AVCFJM,"This film made me a fan of Star Trek. Star Trek had been dead for years. The last StarTrek movie before this was bashed by critics and fans alike. After that Star Trek fadded out for a while. Then J.J. Abrams rebooted it and gave it a new life. I'd say that it really paid off. Unlike the old Star Trek this film draws in a more broad following. This new Star Trek not only appeals to long die hard fans of the franchise, but to newcommers, like me. I was not a fan of the old Star Trek. However, I saw this and became a fan of the franchise.

The characters were solid. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto do solid jobs as Kirk and Spock. The other actors do a fine job also. I like the cameo by Leonard Nemoy. I do wish they would have gotten William Shatner to make a cameo also, though. Though I thought that Uhura was unneeded. It seems like she was just there for sex appeal and for forced drama.

The effects are amazing. This film looks a lot like a Star Wars film. The film looks this way because J.J. Abrams worked on this film because he could not work on Star Wars, which is his dream. Some people might be turned off by this, but I did not mind the look. The story is also very competant. Some twists occured that I did not see coming.

Only complaint is that half way through, the movie wouldn't play.  We ended up finishing the movie on the Xbox.  For some reason the Roku box just wouldn't buffer correctly when it started messing up.  That's more of a Roku issue rather than a movie issue.

In the time of switching devices... I tried to play on my computer and it said that you couldn't play Amazon digital purchases on a computer.  Amazon should let you play your rentals on a computer through the website.  Seems like a no-brainer.",1366761600,,665,4.567796610169491

3471230,1,B001AVCFJM,"I've been wanting to submit a review of this ""product"" for some time, but I'm on kind of a hiatus at Amazon because of continuing health problems. Besides, I've thought, the over 100 one star reviews have said it all better than I could, perhaps. The ""majority"" of reviews and reviewers give this drek a high rating, but I'm only left to wonder, how many of these ""positive"" reviews (or 2-4 sentences thumbs way up) are even ""real."" I have written reviews on movies I've loved and movies I've hated, and I know there are usually very few ""helpful"" votes for bad reviews of a supposed ""fan favorite."" Or is it ""fan-boy?""  So, i write this, knowing full well, that the folks who actually like this film, will dismiss my dismissal of this cinematic garbage, I write on.  At the very least, try to see this and fully digest it, before wasting money on it.

I watched the very first Star Trek at 11 years old with my 14 year old brother and my dad of 43. We watched it on some big ugly Dumont black and white screen, and all three of us agreed it was first rate and ""too good for television."" Dad died a year later. And the show, the year after that.  Me and my brother were always ""space"" or ""sci-fi"" fans growing up. We used to talk out loud to each other before going to sleep about ""what if"" and such.  This night time banter was heavily influenced by the actual times we were living in.  Apollo, MaN ON THE MOON, 2001 the movie, the cultural and social turmoil of the late 60's-early70's.  The hopelessness of the Vietnam war times and struggling somehow to be enlightened and enlightening.  I miss Jimmy Carter!  Times, hoping to lead to a more hopeful time and awakening, and spirit.  To boldly go where no one has gone before.  Everything Star Trek up until this time and this BAD movie, it seems has always had a positive, hopeful root, but not with this CRAP.  This film is true Devo...

There were/was a few minor and major fan movements back in the day to get something close to the original show on the air again, but TV had gone ""All in the Family"" type stuff, cheap, video B4 a live audience, sensationalism for its sake, and horrible original sci-fi, cheap, unimaginative shows trying to replace the likes of Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, and the original STAR TREK (during the Lost in Space Dayz).  The original series end, me and my brother and millions of fans planet-wise, we hated. It wouldn't die however. Years after the original, an animated series, featuring the voices of the original crew.  Then Star Wars hit (and to a less extent, Close Encounters of the Third Kind), and there was a rush of big budget sci fi aimed at the studios.  It is indeed ironic that Star Wars and Star Trek are linked in this way.  The first studio big bux release of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" made a lot of money, but was a critical failure (although I still think of it as the best ST movie ever, and my brother will attest to this, in writing if necessary).  But it was just successful enough to engender sequels.

There were many good Star Trek movies after this, some a lot better than others, but it WAS ""Star Trek."" There were many good Star Trek TV series later (my fave is Voyager), some a lot better than others, but it WAS ""Star Trek."" What then is this Star Trek 2009 or Star Trek 11 or the JJ Abrams version (funny how they even co-opted the whole brand name of Star Trek, without a subtitle or mention, let alone praise or due honor to Roddenbarry's original vision)?  JJ Abrams' ""Star Trek"" is garbage.  The people who made and promote this and the upcoming sequel (""Star Blechh 2013: More schleck from the schmuck JJ"") , have nothing to do with Star Trek.  JJ Abrams was the totally WRONG choice for this or a sequel as director (which he generally sux at), and this really has nothing to do in even a remotely way, IMHO related to the words ""Star Trek.

This movie is total garbage from beginning to end.  Constantly shaking cameras, unfocused and/or jiggily character head/shoulder shots, lens flares everywhere, totally unappealing and phony ""camera reaction"" shots, aka, unwarranted ""zoom"" and oh why go on?  This film is totally illogical and awful from first frame to last.  It looks like it was shot in a Bed Bath n Beyond, or IKEA.  Did I mention the former ""look up to"" characters of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and the rest are all reduced to unpleasant peeps?  Like, just, in general?  Getting drunk on future Budweiser, accidental female breast grabs, species sexual interractions between earthlings and Vulcans.  The old Spock and the new Spock.  Total Screenwriting 101 ERROR, the young Kirk and his apple, and all the rest of the stereotypes supposedly based upon the original ideas and characters.  It's a crime.  Is this really a comedy?

Bottom line is, this really should not be called Star Trek because it is an alternate universe Star Trek, which is also known as LACK OF IMAGINATION.  This is an insult to everything Star Trek!  And the SFX?  Totally forgettable because most last a few frames and it's apparent this was a cost-saving measure.  When I first saw this, I couldn't believe any movie could come close to this close in being, so bad, based upon an established and successful movie/tv franchise. Unless it was a movie TRYING to be bad (camp, parody, satire, etc.).  But this one's not.  JJ and crew are serious?  Paramount, this is serious?  So this is what it's all basically come down to?  For the love of...  For so many reasons,  this is just such an insult to anything, EVER even remotely associated with anything previously to do with the words, ""Star Trek.""

It saddens me to think anyone really likes this at all, let alone can pretend to care enough to pretend to rationally explain why. This is so anti-Star Trek.  This is so illogical and so corporate.  And mark my words, go ahead, mark 'em, JJ will do to Star Wars what he did with Star Trek.  Jeez.  This movie is a total mess, and a total waste of time. What saddens me most however is that a sequel from JJ is about to be released, and no doubt it will be more will pull in the bucks from impressionable, albeit misguided youth (with an expendable income). And then go on to make big profits for all involved in this with more money-grubbing that's really all the sequel of this, or others, will ever engender. This is the end of the franchise alright, beyond it there was only Kurtz...",1365811200,9,6397,4.510416666666667

3471233,5,B001AVCFJM,"While some TV shows have been redone simply as remakes, the nice thing about Star Trek is that we have a plausible and intelligent reason why history for the Star Trek Universe will change, without throwing away our well loved characters.  Some die hard fans will complain about the changes but this is unreasonable as then we would be stuck with just repeats of the same stories already told.  The acting is fun and they have several scenes where you can tell the actors are trying to sound like their 1960s counterparts without all of the weakness of being in a 1960s TV show.  I grew up watching the original series as a kid, loved Star Trek the Next Generation the first several seasons until it started feeling trapped in biases/prejudices of the time.  When Enterprise came out I enjoyed it as fresh and yet still within a familiar universe that would eventually give us Kirk and Spock and Chekov.  This movie manages to feel nostalgic and yet completely fresh.  The only negative thing that stood out watching the film was the rebellious kid in trouble scene (being vague to avoid any spoilers) because while it helped establish a character's background, it seemed too forced and abrupt--a minor blip in an otherwise fun film.",1365638400,,1233,4.738317757009346

A couple Trekkie friends loved how the movie showed how characters they love come to meet each other. A little campy at times, but that seems to have been the charm of the franchise.

Abrams makes excessive use of lens flare and reflection in the film, and while it looks cool, it gets tired by the end and distracting to the viewer at times.

A doctor nicknamed Bones and stumbled upon is an engineer named Scotty.  Leonard Nimoy makes an appearance as the elder Spock from the future and Vulcan is distroyed.

3471267,5,B001AVCFJM,"I grew up watching the original series and I was not excited at the idea of new actors taking on the roles of characters that are so well-known. After reading good reviews, I finally saw the movie in the theater and returned to see it again a few days later. I have just watched it twice on DVD. This is a movie meant for a big screen, but it is still incredible on a small-screen - especially if you turn the lights down and the sound up.

I won't be exhaustive or get into plot-points - that has been done by many others. I will say that the characters are true to their nature without being a parody of the original actors. Some mannerisms are winked at, then we just go on with the movie. I have seen many, many movies or TV shows that deal with time-travel, but none have handled the logical leaps as well as this film. I was completely blown away by the special effects and the sound of this movie. Both completely suck the viewer in and I am left every time with my jaw hanging open.

If you are a trek fan and still haven't seen this, I think that you will be pleasantly surprised. Just go into it knowing that it is a re-boot.",1364428800,,1135,4.131221719457014
3471268,5,B001AVCFJM,"No problem at all.

Would recommend to anyone that asked.  Product was on time as represented and and good value",1364256000,,112,4.55
3471269,4,B001AVCFJM,"My wife and I introduced our teenagers to the Star Trek universe with this movie.  It provided the excitement and action that young viewers (and older) want as well as the backdrop of all the old favorite Star Trek personalities.  It was obvious that the producers worked hard to make a believable link between the original and new cast members.
Like:  The action mixed with humor linked to classic Star Trek.
Dislike:  It seems like they tried a little too hard to make Kirk a rebel.  It made me wonder how he could ever be an effective captain.  Also the alternate universe thing seems like the easy way out and now the link between old and new can be severed.",1364256000,,662,4.475

Unfortunately, the story is just too similar to story and plot lines that Star Trek has recycled over and over again through the years.

Let's hope the second film in this series has something a bit more original to the story.

Recommended, though I wish I had waited until I owned a BluRay player to purchase this movie. This was one of my last DVD purchases, and it's a film that really benefits from HDTV viewing.",1364083200,,674,4.553719008264463

If you want every bad comic book cliche glued together by lens flares, then kill yourself. How? Just take a sip every time a superfluous lens flare obscures the lack of character development on the screen. It doesn't even have to be an alcoholic beverage, Felicity Bitch relies so heavily on this Kai's Power Tools-era visual schlock that a sip of water for every lens flare gimmick would cause your stomach to burst by the second act.",1363651200,,609,4.495495495495495

3471315,3,B001AVCFJM,"Abrams' Star Trek is easily the most polished Star Trek movie, but it also lacks something essential about Trek. Most Trek movies are about moral or philosophical dilemmas. Even the worst of Trek had presented interesting questions. By contrast, Abrams' Trek is a fun adventure, but very shallow. There are lots of space battles and action scenes and character development, but not much else.

There are also a lot of logical inconsistencies in the plot, most notably that Kirk is made captain just a few days after graduating Starfleet academy! The whole plot centers around yet another alien attempt to destroy Earth. I suspect most of those plot contrivances are courtesy of Damon Lindelof.

It's a fun ride, but not a very fulfilling one. It's definitely geared more towards mass audiences rather than Trek fans. Overall, 3.5 stars.",1362873600,,836,5.050724637681159

3471318,5,B001AVCFJM,"I am 53 years old and this is one of my favorite movies to enjoy and ""experience"".  Basically it grabs me and pulls me in to the emotion of the whole thing.  This is due to the directing by JJ Abrams, the movie is much faster paced than any other Star Trek and the sound track is awesome.  If you are to compare it to the others that have preceded you miss the point.  At my age, Star Wars was released when I was a freshmen in Engineering school, I have learned to take things as they are and not as you expect them to be.  Standing on its own this movie is fantastic.  This movie calls me back to watch it again just so that I can ""feel"" the movie one more time.  The grandiosity of the whole event is awesome.  The cast was fantastic.  Every time Zoe is on the screen she steals the scene.  Zachary was perfect.  Chris Pine was great as the leader of the crew.  To compare to Shatner and Nimoy does the franchise a disservice.  I really like the clever plot trick to reset the series with Nero changing the timeline at Kirk's birth was well done and allows for the new directions.

I rented this movie in HD, and I have an HD television and fast (15mps) internet cable connection. I told it to play and within seconds it started playing in full HD. It looked great, I was pleased. But I stopped it about halfway through and did not finish watching it until the next day. It would only play with 2 of 4 bars lit up in orange, no HD. I stopped it, checked my internet connection, rebooted my PS3, rebooted my router, and even tried to start the movie fresh from the beginning again. No matter what I did, it gave me poor standard definition with blotchy pixels. I finished the movie, went on to watch an episode of Fringe, and it played immediately in full HD, as did several other shows.

Although I went to a few Star Trek conventions when I was in college, I have never participated in the nerdy slap fights about whether Ensign Tomlin was right-handed or left-handed in episode 12. (Totally making that name up, kids, so don't go looking.) I might have read one of the paperback novels based on the original series, but that's a big if. Thus, my review of Star Trek comes from a moderate, but not total, familiarity with the subject matter.

The movie was solid. There, I said it.

I thought the actors did a commendable job, keeping some of the core aspects of the characters from the TV show, but imbuing them with some logical updates. The pacing lags a little in the middle, but that happens in a lot of Act IIs in standard three-part dramas. And yes, there is an abundance/abuse of lens flare, courtesy of JJ Abrams. But, the overall sum of the parts is more than the individual pieces and the end result is an entertaining movie, as long as you go into it without the expectation that you're going to see the original series verbatim.",1362355200,,1083,4.49238578680203

3471337,3,B001AVCFJM,"The movie itself was spectacular in Blu-ray (I had rented the standard DVD before I got a Blu-ray player). I was VERY disappointed that the only extra was the director's commentary, especially when he referred to all the deleted scenes that ""would be on the DVD.""  I haven't bought a lot of DVDs lately and didn't think to see if there was a deluxe edition. It would have been helpful if the deluxe edition had popped up when I was looking at the item, or had been listed with the ""people who bought/liked this item also bought X"". I would have bought the deluxe edition instead of this one, but since I've already spent $20 on this and can't return it as there's nothing wrong with it I am reluctant to spend another $40 to get a second DVD of the movie just to get the extras.

If you read the one star reviews you'll get a sense of all of the plot holes that could have been avoided if JJ bothered to watch some Star Trek or sucked less. They are real and it's a shame there are so many of them.

But the movie, despite it's faults, is not just watchable but fun. The characters should not be meeting the way they do, but every one of them is cast well and does a great job and are pretty consistent with the old Trek cast. The action is great, the way they are gathered around finalizing the assault on the Romulan mining ship and then execute is, it works. I came away not just satisfied but thinking it was in the top 4 of the movie series. Upon second watch I still think it's fun but there's too many inconsistencies.

The casting and characterizations of the original cast are near-perfect; my only quibble is with Scotty,one of my favorite characters in the original series. He has lost his quiet, stoic sweetness in his new incarnation as comic relief. But Kirk, Spock, and Bones are so spot-on that I'm willing to overlook it.

It also was not in HD after the first hour and was in what seemed like a poor video resolution as it definitely wasn't clear.  More than once, it blacked out and said it was ""loading"".

The movie is fantastic, but the poor performance of the network or the delivery mechanism through Roku ruined the experience.",1361491200,,566,4.73469387755102

Now...

JJ Abrams and the cast of this movie completely blew me away. Action, drama, humor, a little bit of romance, edge of the seat suspense, Star Trek (2009) has it all.  I watch this movie at least once a month.

""Into Darkness"" comes out my birthday week.  I can't wait for the party which is ending with the midnight showing!",1361318400,,561,4.285714285714286

Therefore while there is some overlap, it's not simply a regurgitation; it's a completely different, alternate universe, yet as an original fan, I think they captured the spirit of Rodenberry's first vision and characters very, very well.  The Romulans are fierce, there are no reformulated Klingons (something I never liked, they were clearly the bad guys to start with and the Romulans were fearful and ruthless but honorable, i don't like that they messed with that in later TV sequels), and the chemistry between the crew on the bridge is perfect.  Well cast, well written, well produced, and well directed, assuming this trend continues, I can't wait for Start Trek II to hit the theaters in 2013; I will be first in line.

I'm not going to say that I love everything about the relaunch (for instance ... the Enterprise being built on Earth? Spock being some sort of professor or TA at the Academy while Kirk was tinkering with the Kobayashi Maru? Pike and Kirk on the Enterprise together?)

And while I enjoy the early movies with that original crew, this modern take on the same characters is fantastic.  All of the actors did a great job, combined with fantastic effects, and having Leonard Nimoy appear as the original Spock was icing on the cake.  This disc also contains one of the funniest gag reels I have ever seen, and I still laugh about it years later.  All I can say is that I am very looking forward to the next one due out in May 2013 and the fact that JJ Abrams will direct the next Star Wars movie gives me a ""new hope"" that that movie will be nothing short of spectacular also.",1359849600,,745,4.225352112676056
3471410,5,B001AVCFJM,"I'm not here to review the movie as such, I'll just say I found it 2 hours of downright rip roaring fun. I was an original fan of the original series, which I'm going to rewatch now, and enjoy even more, I hope. Even with all its excesses and melodrama and silliness ... it was a harbinger of things to come, and a cultural icon. Maybe the original space meme.

BUT the main thing I want to mention is that even though the description of this 2-disc edition says it includes ""Digital Copy (Expires November 17, 2011)"" I downloaded that through my iTunes at the end of January this year, 2013. And the 2-disc edition was actually cheaper than the  1-disc. Go figure.

Okay, one more thing (or two): so good to see Karl Urban have such a good time playing McCoy! He's been playing too many heavies. Lots of foreshadowing in the cast interplay, great to hear the first utterance of future (not real time, you know what I mean) iconic lines. ""I'm giving her all she's got, Captain!"" Looking forward to the next one (or two ... if JJ doesn't get too distracted by Star Wars)",1359763200,,1069,4.388888888888889

3471412,3,B001AVCFJM,"The movie is obviously five stars; the quality of picture and sound in the streaming version left a lot to be desired.

3471414,4,B001AVCFJM,"The reason I did not give 5 stars to this movie is because it is dark (poor lighting in too many scenes) and not entirely consistent with the Star Trek story.

I am a Star Trek fan and Amazon said they would give me $5.99 credit ( they charged me instead) towards watching movies.  So I tried the service and part way during the movie, it stopped.  I had to reboot Roku to finish the movie.

I have watched many dozens of movies from Netflix in HD with Roku and never had a problem.  Amazon made a fun movie into a hassle.  My birthday film wasn't as good as it should have been.",1359763200,,579,4.079646017699115
3471415,1,B001AVCFJM,"I normally don't write reviews, especially negative ones, but to a Trek fan like me, this is a disappointment.  The science is all wrong, unlike other Star Trek plots, where the science is at least somewhat based in reality.  I'm not a physicist, but shooting a quantum singularity in the middle of a dying star to keep it from going supernova seems like a bad idea.  First, the problem with a supernova is that the star has run out of fuel at it's core.  A singularity would suck the rest of the fuel out, killing nuclear fusion.  The star would eventually fizzle out like a dead light bulb.  It might prevent the star from going nova, but your star is dead, dude; time to look for another planet (red matter won't save your planet). Eventually, the black hole produced would eat the star, then suck your planet in as well.  Second, the Romulan's ships run on singularities, and the Romulans certainly wouldn't have needed to wait for Spock to make a special kind of singularity for them.  Third, I know it might be true, but how do you go from Ensign to Captain, then stay with the same crew for 20 years? Just not how the military works. Lastly, it's a simple revenge story, not even better than a plot from Star Trek TNG. DS9 or Voyager.  The acting, characters, and special effects were great, but if you are a Trek fan steer clear of this one. Certainly hope they make the subsequent movies better and more scientifically sound.",1359676800,5,1434,4.505791505791506

3471443,5,B001AVCFJM,"I understand the philosphical complaints that true/hardcore Star Trek fans have about this film being a departure from the established tone of the franchise. But (in my opinion) this one was exactly what Star Trek needed. After nearly thirty seasons of television and ten previous films, it had all become exceedingly well-worn, over-exploited and increasingly playing on the border of unintentional self-parody. This was a like a glass of ice-cold water in the face of the franchise. It's new, it's different in some ways and what is very important and refreshing, it's edgy.

There are numerous points of virtue. First of all, I have to say, what an absolutely gorgeous-looking film. The Enterprise bridge set is so beautiful that it almost makes me want to cry. There are several terrifically cinematic panoramas on Earth, on Vulcan and out in space. I particularely love the way that relected sunlight and otherlight frequently flares across the edges of the shots, just as happens with a real camera. Nowdays, they can get rid of that, but in this case it was left or added, just another element of visual appeal.

I was pleased with the cast. Chris Pine impresses me more with each role he takes, and he is a great Kirk. Zachary Quinto as Spock is probably the best person for his role. I was impressed with the characterization of Zoe Saldana's Uhura; she seems to be more engaged into the story than in her original series incarnation, which is a good development. Some of the others, I will need to see more of in future films. Also, there is a very strong supporting cast, consisting of the likes of Ben Cross, Winonna Ryder, Jennifer Morrison, Eric Bana and so on.

Overall, this is just simply a great film. Completely perfect? Maybe not, but it has light-years of wonderful redeeming qualities. The concept, the look, the sound, the cinematography, the cast, the direction, the humor. This is one of the most watchable science fiction films that I have seen in a long time. The opening sequence, which is one of the most engagingly dramatic and emotionally moving that I've ever seen, and it keeps moving from there. Maybe not classicist Trek, but it feels like a bold new future, and the energy that this film has put into the franchise will hopefully result in an ever upward trajectory from here.

The cast all play their parts extremely well but the plot is a little hackneyed and I think it goes too far out of the way to please the hardcore fans by contriving alternate universes and time travel. Eric Bana's character doesn't have a rational motivation. Why not go to starfleet in the past and get them to not use the anti-matter as opposed to trying to destroy Vulcan and Earth like a crazy person? The characters run every place and scream at each other a lot and Kirk is in full-on sexual harassment mode all the time. It's definitely turned up to 11. Finally, they give no legitimate explanation how an ensign like Kirk would be knocked up several ranks to command the flagship of Starfleet- that's not how military-style ranking works for good reason. That's not to say the movie is bad- just frustrating in some ways. This one is worth picking up if you can get it at a discount.",1357516800,,936,4.416184971098266

3471492,1,B001AVCFJM,"Abrams' Star Trek is one of those rare movies that gets worse the longer you think about it. First, there's the thrill of all the blinking lights, lens flares, and 'splosions. Then there's the nostalgia of Spock Prime meeting his younger self. Then there's the sickening realization that everything you just saw was a beautifully wrapped pile of krapp. The lasting impression is of a roomful of film editors furiously splicing together outtakes from ""ST:Wrath of Khan,"" the god-awful ""ST:Nemesis,"" and the quite excellent Star Trek: Enterprise, and running them through a video effects processor. The result is a pointless revenge plot involving a bald-like-Shinzon, genetically-engineered-like-Khan, vaguely Romulan super-villain who possesses a doomsday weapon like the Xindi weapon crossed with the Genesis device and the theleron radiation gun. And in the place of our stalwart Federation heroes, we get ""Star Trek Babies""(tm)... a widdle Captain Kirk who needs his nappy, a thumb-sucking baby Spock, Uhura Barbie, the Talking Scotty doll, and Junior Chekhov.

Saw it in the theater and have watched it 2-3x since buying this DVD. Very well-acted, well put together, fresh plot, tons of action and excitement, lots of dry humor from Bones -- just an overall great film.

There is one guy I know who saw the movie in the theater and loved it, and then decided days later that he hated it because of the Vulcan demise.  Whatever....

3471543,4,B001AVCFJM,"STAR TREK (2009) is a suprisingly strong, competent, and solid summer re-imagining of the classic original Star Trek series of the 60s. I still hold TOS in high regard as one of the most groundbreaking TV shows of all time. In many ways, it's still the template for me for what true sci-fi TV is all about. I may be in the minority, but I think that all the ""sequel series"" lacked something that TOS still possesses. TNG is heavily overrated and looks more dated than TOS. Also, DS9, while much better than TNG, somehow lacks the charm of TOS. Voyager was decent, and Enterprise was...well...don't know! Back to TNG, not only do I think the series itself doesn't stand the test of time, but absolutely NONE of the TNG films are any good! With TOS, you had a great series AND at least 3 or 4 very good films in the bargain! Not to mention TOS had the best characters, which is one reason I really like this 2009 re-boot. It managed to capture, for the most part, the essence of the characters that drove TOS...Kirk, Spock, McCoy et al!

Newbie Chris Pine is very good indeed as 25-year old James T. Kirk, an embittered hellion from Iowa who, as a baby, lost his father, George Kirk, in the film's smashing opening sequence, a battle between the Federation Starship USS Kelvin and the gargantuan Romulan vessel the Narada, which has time-travelled from the future as the result of space anomaly created by a ""red matter"" explosion which destroyed Romulus and thrust the Narada into the past. The red matter experiment was actually supposed to save Romulus. None other than Ambassador Spock himself (the great Leonard Nimoy in an extended cameo) led the mission that went awry and is blamed by the Narada captain Nero (Eric Bana in a gusto-filled performance). FutureSpock also is sent to the past by the explosion and is banished to a nearby planet as Nero plans to wreak havoc on the galaxy, thus the plot of this summer blockbuster.

Kirk is coaxed into joining Starfleet Academy by Captain Christopher Pike (wonderfully essayed by the always-reliable veteran actor Bruce Greenwood) and along the way meets the fellow down-and-out Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (persona nailed by Karl Urban in my favorite performance of the film!), a country doctor who joined Starfleet as a fresh start after a messy divorce. At the academy, Kirk has a run-in with one of the academy trainers, Commander Spock (terrific work by Zachary Quinto) after Kirk ""cheated"" on the infamous Kobayahsi Maru simulation exercise, which was designed by Mr. Spock. As Nero's path of destruction nears Earth, Starfleet activates the fleet to engage the Narada in battle. Among the fleet is the newly christened Starship USS Enterprise, captained by Pike, with Spock as first officer. The grounded Kirk (who has useful knowledge on how to stop Nero) manages to gain passage on the ship with the help of McCoy.

Among the recruits assigned to the ship are McCoy, Uhura, Sulu, and Chekov. While I was generally impressed by the characterizations of  the ""main 3"" Kirk/Spock/McCoy, I was less impressed with the supporting mates. I felt that Sulu (played by John Cho) and Chekov (played by Anton Yelchin) were very underused, while Uhura (played by Zoe Saldana, who had a major role in this film) was miscast, capturing none of the essence of the character from the 60s series. Also, even the great Simon Pegg was a bit much to take as Scotty, whose character was picked up by the Enterprise during the mission on a faraway space station. Thankfully, the main characters compensate for the rather weak supporting cast. These supporting roles were too ""off"" for my taste. Hopefully, they'll rectify that in the new film to be released in the spring of 2013.

Director J.J. Abrams does a fabulous job with the film's pacing. In particular, the musical score is pulse-pounding and the space battles are spectacular, giving the film a palpable feel to the viewer. The movie manages to encapsulate an old-school summer blockbuster atmosphere. While the characters could have been more fleshed out, the movie has a good story, mixed with great effects. While many Trekkies may feel a bit letdown, I thoroughly enjoyed this re-boot, which has re-generated an iconic franchise by paying homage to the REAL Star Trek series...TOS!",1355616000,,4278,4.846785225718194

3471552,3,B001AVCFJM,"I tried to view this film with an open mind but it was clear from the start that this new version was not going to please me.
  As a single film on it's own it's ok but this film contradicts far too much of the original series. creative license went too far.
  Those of us who are familier with the original series will see the differances right away, such as the fact that the original "" Bones "" McCoy was from the south, this new version was not and the person chosen for this charactor just didn't measure up.
  This film destroys the planet volcun and kills off Spock's mother, both are very much alive and well in the original series. It really went wrong for me to see this new spock having a romantic relationship with uhura, something that would never occur in the original series, neither would spock refer to his captain as "" Jim "" as Spock always tried to maintain his volcan side.

And that's what this phone felt like, more like a Star Wars than a Star Trek.  After all that's why like Star Wars last Star Trek more cold Star Wars is more fantastical, and Star Trek is more SCIENCE fiction.  Bt the biggest problem is why the origional pilot never made it on the air: the bigwigs thougth the nacent Star Trek too cerebrial for it apparently dumb viewers.  And what Abrams did is much moor that meaningless gun-and-run melodrama of modern Hollywood that is cetainly anti-cerebral.  What was the point of the film?  In II-IV, the pooints were clear: defeat man with a vendetta, save Spock, get back home (and save the Earth on the side).  The point of this film--man with a vendetta--could have been nicely written into a 45-minute episode. So it was a poor herald of ""Star Trek."" Moorover, the charecters, in keeping with the theme, are poor, melodramatic, imitation recreations of the classic originals.  Nothig about this accuretly recaptures thr spitit of the Original Series.

But it wasn't an all-bad SciFi.  If it haven't had the name quotes star track, quote I probably would not have gone to see it; but if I happened to catch it on television or something I might have enjoyed it.  It could have been an afable B-class flick; if it just weren't called a""Star Trek.""

3471560,1,B001AVCFJM,"J.J. Abrams, being famous for exploiting other people's work decided upon himself that the legendary show Star Trek needed a ""reboot.""  That was his first mistake.  Trying to exploit an already made audience was his second mistake, and this movie is his WORST mistake.  This is a total desecration of a timeless television series that spawned 10 movies on its own along with 4 additional series.  Yet Abrams thinks that changing timelines, the personalities of the characters and a total abortion of a late producer/creator's dream constitutes a ""reboot."" Abrams thinks that manipulating and destroying the characters that became legends, overusing special effects and lens flares on EVERY shot is producing an experience that he not only thinks is better than the original, but more appealing for people who have never even experienced the classic show or original movies.  This is a travesty.  A soulless attempt to recreate something that was not only a very special experience for true Trek fans, but nothing more than a poor attempt to bring some kind of ridiculous alternative version of a true masterpiece.  The acting, the accents, the storyline and production quality is more over the top than Shatner ever was, and the manipulation of the characters, especially Spock, is something that should earn Abrams jail time for the destruction of property instead of any kind of respect for this mockery of previous material. Skip this one.  If someone gives it to you as a gift, the DVD is not even worth a coaster for your drinks.

Thought I would give it a second watch. I was really drawn into it, and had a better feeling for the cast. Ok maybe Chris Pine needed to take his meds and stay away from coffee in a few scenes, but he looks the part of a young Kirk.

I think anyone reading this has already seen the movie. If not it is a good watch. You do not have to be a fan of the TV shows to know what is happening. As a reboot it starts at the beginning, everything you need to know is there. Your in the future, there is space travel, and something bad happens that causes the characters to join in the adventure. For old timers and TV watchers like me, the future was changed because someone came back in time and changed it. THAT is the essential part you have to understand.

Respectful to the original 60s series source material and expands on character development, in subtle strokes in mere moments, better than the more heavy-handed treatments in all of the Star Trek movies of the 1980s. Excellent choice of leads (Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Zoe Soldana) who evoke their original counterparts, as more youthful, more fully-fleshed versions. Simon Pegg was hugely entertaining, but has very little physical resemblance to James Doohan's ""Scotty.""

It's a reboot of Star Trek: The Original Series and the actors do a phenomenal job of embodying the essence of the original characterizations while making them their own and keeping them fresh. Keep your eyes open for a brief appearance by Randy Pausch, writer of The Last Lecture, who was able to fulfill a life-long dream when he was given a one-line speaking part as someone on the bridge of the Kelvin.

There are numerous nods and references to the various iterations of Star Trek. They're listed on IMDB, so you can see which ones you catch on your own and which ones you need a reminder for. But you don't have to have been a Star Trek fan to enjoy this film. Anyone who enjoys sci-fi will enjoy this.",1353542400,,801,4.375838926174497
3471594,5,B001AVCFJM,"I am a huge fan of Star Trek.  I, like many hardcore ""Trekkies"", were very skeptical when we learned that the franchise was going to be given a reboot.  Reboots are very common in Hollywood today, practically expected.  There are some things, however, you just don't touch and Star Trek is one of those.  726 episodes and 10 movies is a lot of stories to suddenly erase.

To my amazement an act of brilliance occurred.  J.J. Abrams and crew set out to bring new fans to the world of Star Trek and at the same time, honor the old fans.  Time travel, which has been used often is Star Trek, is used here to create an alternate timeline...no reset button this time...and it works.  Leonard Nimoy is brought in to obviously ""pass the torch"" from the old Star Trek universe to the new.  This is one element in the new movie that has certainly peased old fans, myself included.  But what is truly amazing (IMHO) is that there is reference made to the other Trek universe that us Trekkies grew up with....it still exists!  In addition, there are also numerous references that fans will pick up on, and exceptional casting of all the characters.  There are moments that Chris Pine is very much like William Shatner and Karl Urban is nearly a double of Deforest Kelly as Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy.

If you are a newbie to the franchise, you will have no trouble following this movie.  As I said earlier, this
was created to bring new people to Star Trek.  It follows the birth of James T. Kirk in a both exiciting and emotional opening scene, to his rise as Captain of the Enterprise.  The story of Spock is also focused on equally as well, and perhaps even more so with the addition of his ""future self"" played by Leonard Nimoy.  All the other characters of the Enterprise are introduced as well, and one by one they fill their rightful roles throughout the progress of the film.

Compared to previous Star Trek films, this movie is huge.  Everything about is given more detail and has a much larger feel.  The Enterprise never felt so big and the sense of flying through space never so intense.  The visual effects are top notch and are given more detail than in any previous Star Trek.  The story and character development are also strong, and in the end, this movie moves along with a great pace.

3471601,3,B001AVCFJM,"I have to agree with those who have argued that this reboot of the Star Trek franchise essentially creates something different disguised as Star Trek. Star Trek was as much about ideas as action, even though those ideas were often naive and half-baked. Oh, and also about human relationships, even when some of those humans actually weren't. The reboot is pure action. Period. Well done action, I will grant, though sometimes -- if you'll pardon use of the phrase -- quite illogical. Moreover, the human relationships this time around seem rather perfunctory and superficial, but perhaps they haven't had the time to be developed -- after all, the original Star Trek characters had decades together on the small and big screen. The manner of the franchise's makeover is clever if not completely original -- as readers of, say, DC comics will testify. And perhaps I should leave with that reference in mind. Iconic characters are always being redefined and reworked. The Superman of today is not the Superman of the early 1960 or the original of the late 1930s. Sherlock Holmes has come in gone in several incarnations other than the Arthur Conan Doyle stories that created him. This version of Star Trek is like the original only in superficial resemblance, and it's not what I think of when I think of Star Trek. But I won't begrudge the early 21st Century its own vision of the 23rd which is different than what I experienced in the 20th. This vision is well crafted on the outside, but just okay at its spiritual core, which nonetheless is perhaps in tune with the times.",1352851200,,1574,4.790441176470588

3471607,4,B001AVCFJM,"THIS is how you reinvent a franchise.

There is a big reason this movie works beyond the spectacle on display.  The film's heart is in its characters that are clearly younger versions of those icons from the classic television show.  While everyone gets a chance to shine in this ""assemble the crew"" story the lion's share of the warmth on display here belongs to Kirk and Spock.

It would have been easy to just jettison what came before but the filmmakers managed to incorporate that problem into the plot.  Once it's finally explained in a short exchange on the bridge they said goodbye to the old and the new takes over into any direction it wants.

I am not enough of a tech head to figure out the nuances of High Definition visual quality but I see no complaints from my basic system.  The big draw with this edition of the movie is putting the extensive extras on a separate blu ray.  Fans and film school people should have some fun with what's been shown here.  A digital copy and a demo for a computer game is on the third disc instead of a DVD.  Don't let that be a deal breaker.  Make some new fans with this version.",1351555200,,1129,4.354066985645933

Only one scene conflicted with Star Trek.  If you recall ""A piece of the action"", Kirk attempted to drive
a car with Spock in it.  He was a terrible driver and Spock said he was a great captain but a terrible driver.

There are many problems created by the movie that are in conflict with what the original series presented, but you'd have to watch the movie to understand this. I'm not willing to go into details of everything I found strange because this is only one person's view. Even if the majority of trekkers were to agree on a failing, this failing could easily be of no concern to you.

I'm fascinated by Star Trek. The failings of this movie grounded me but the plot, the construction, the effects and story line picked me up and made me ethusiastic about the movie. I've watched it many times, unusual for me, and I've never doubted about watching it again. It's a movie where each viewing reveals a little more information and I notice things not noticed before.

I enthusiastically believe you'd enjoy this movie. I'm also bummed by saying that you need to see this movie as itself, without judging it against the series, in order to truly enjoy a very well constructed story line. But this is only my opinion.",1351382400,,1117,4.524752475247524
3471612,4,B001AVCFJM,"Bottom Line First:
This movie is worth a viewing or two. I liked it. Be sure to let it go as soon as you remove the disk.

It seems that when you review items that have a cult following you are supposed to qualify yourself.
Yes I have been a follower of Star Trek since the beginning. I have seen all of the movies. I have watched all of the various spin off TV programs although not all episodes.
I have attended all of one Comic Con, and part of a second, never in costume or to argue over Star Trek Vs Star Wars vs Star (Fill in the blank).  During what I remember as ComicCon 1 (2?), I stayed up till 2 AM acting as a volunteer projectionist while we waited for our copy of the first bloopers real to be allowed into our presence. So fan yes, Klingon speaking episode quoting hard core capital `F' Fan, no

This item in the Star Trek universe will be considered, very briefly in one of three lights: As a stand alone entertainment, as science fiction and as a franchise re-boot.

This movie is entertaining. If you like action adventure movies this is more than worth its present low price (under $6 as I write). I do not see it as something most folks in the non-fan category will want to view many times. This may be a candidate for instant view or rental. There are things you may not see without many viewings, some of those things you may not want to see.

Plot. Does it matter?
We got this somewhat sympathetic villain named Nemo, who shows up with this super powerful ship that has never before seen ability to tear apart ships. Nemo seems to have a major resentment of... So far this is Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, except this time we have time travel, a snow planet, some sparkly and flashing lights and more or less special effects. And yes this movie has the expendable red shirt.

The Science Fiction.
Here the less said the better. In short, enjoy the movie with your brain in neutral. As soon as you start thinking about the logic and the details, this movie becomes frustrating. The original TV shows were scientifically inconsistent and even silly. It is not asking too much that this movie suffers some of the same. It may be that movie companies deliberately allow some of these things just to feed the `experts' - like me- who generate interest by going on about them.

Rebooting the Franchise
This movie is not so much about the plot as it is an introduction to a new cast. I like this new cast. Chris Pine as the new Kirk has learned some of Shatner's physical mannerisms even if he has skipped the famous Shatner pauses. Pine has the quick thinking, hell for leather approach needed for this role. He does seem to take a lot of punches to the face.

Zachary Quinto will do nicely as Spock. He is physically believable, arches his eyebrow with the best of them and has left some room to make this his own role.

Karl Urban (Bones) and Simon Pegg (Scotty) had some great lines and some of the best comic delivery.  Zoe Saldana as Uhura is more than just a pretty face while John Cho (Mr. Sulu ) and Anton Yelchin (Mr. Chekov) are baby faced and earnest.

In sum this is a young crew and they should be able to make this new cast work for as long as the money flows in.

Early in the movie the statement is made that Star Fleet is a ""peace keeping organization"". I object. The Mission is ""To explore.. to seek out new"". Gene Roddenberry had a vision that drove the Star Trek universe. It was not just about six guns at high noon. He certainly depended on the save the universe plots, but underneath he would never have killed off entire home worlds just to make a pretty special effect. Star Trek survives because it had a belief not just explosions

The next movie in the reboot is due out in May 2013. My hope is that we can see something more than phasers at Wolf 359.",1351382400,2,3810,4.319327731092437
3471613,5,B001AVCFJM,This is a good movie showing how the wonderful crew of the Enterprise came in to being. Showing the sometimes funny interactions the grew with time and learning to trust each other.,1350950400,,181,4.6875
3471614,1,B001AVCFJM,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it is so boneheaded that I find that impossible.

Say what you will about the old Star Trek universe, but it did try to play by certain rules. It attempted to be credible for the situations and histories that were portrayed. It tried to be consistent. This newest Star Trek movie, however, reeks of a bunch of beered-up teenagers shouting at each other: ""Wouldn't this be fun?"" ""Wouldn't this be cool, dude?"" ""Screw the old geezers who like that old boring stuff.""

I'll just pick out five things that drove me batty and ruined the flick for me.

First, the Romulan villain's ship. It's like a thousand times bigger (by weight) than the Enterprise and it's made up of all these pointy, sharp, curvy, scary things. Like a big bouquet of humongeous swords and sabers. It's supposedly a former mining ship. The problems? For a start, building the thing would have cost the annual gross economic product of the Romulan Empire. How does its design have anything to do with mining? What practical reason is there for it to be so huge? How does it happen to be the most fearsome warship in the galaxy? Well, J.J. Abrams and friends (whose Fringe I adore) made it this way not because it lends any credibility to the story, but because it was simply too gosh-darned cool to not make it look like this. That is really crappy story-telling.

Second, the brand new Enterprise, the biggest baddest ship in the Federation fleet, flies blind right into a huge battle debris field in its first action. No way could a ship this big have not been destroyed entering such an area jam-packed with giant shrapnel. Again, incredible and stupid.

Third, in this film we kill off most of the Vulcans and Romulans who are living. Billions of them. So how does that work for the future of the Star Trek universe?

Fourth, what in heck is ""red matter"" and how does it make black holes? At least throw out some pseudo-physics there, guys.

Finally, the Enterprise roars off with apparently only one senior officer on the bridge--Capt. Pike. Everyone else is a recent academy graduate. What military organization--or quasi-military organization--would have allowed such a thing to happen, even in an emergency? Again, literally incredible (as in not even remotely believable). And then Pike, only senior officer around, goes off to be a hostage while Spock (recent academy grad) takes the helm.

I really would have liked to see a good Kirk and Spock origin story, but this isn't it. This flick simply breaks faith with the Star Trek universe. I know it was a success at the box office and a sequel's been made. But oy, this movie drives me right up the wall.",1350777600,16,2671,4.680170575692964

3471620,4,B001AVCFJM,"As remakes go, this was a wild ride; questionable science, bad choice of plot and cheesy dialogue, but I liked what I saw.

Yeah, the remake of Planet of the Apes could have been better (lots better) and the new Fog made little sense but it was nice to see what could be done with all of the franchise titles with more money to create better effects (look at Bram Stoker's Dracula!) and an ever-changing social structure. I know, the time travel twist in the new Trek was cheesy, monotonous and a cop-out, but let's be honest, J.J. Abrams is a cheesy director and he always ignores continuity with a dizzying rollarcoaster of neuroses; as far as I'm concerned Star Trek: Nemesis is the end of my childhood Trek adventures; this new movie should be viewed as a remake (good or bad, and there is a lot of both) that gives us a new, if not goofy, look at a deep well of ideas where Gene Roddenberry believed that politics, economy, religion and human need would fall away into a bright, historically rich universe where people made the future every time someone beamed down or pulled out of spacedock. The new Trek showed us the Starfleet Academy, showed us life on Earth and showed us a diversity chosen not forced (which has always been Roddenberry's dream)...and we got a fun, silly movie that I still marvel over. The Romulans? Enough, already; we saw them last in Nemesis. Let's go where no one has gone before (hence the 4 stars) and see something new and original. But I'm afraid me may need a visionary writer, director and producer at Paramount; Abrams makes eye candy and sells popcorn. He is not a visionary.

3471631,5,B001AVCFJM,"There was great potential for disaster with the rebooting of this beloved franchise, particularly if it traveled the road the new version of ""Battlestar Galactica"" did in its last three seasons, when that show went terribly wrong. But no worries; the re-imagined ""Trek"" is a great movie, the third best of the franchise after ""Khan"" and ""The Voyage Home,"" (STII and STIV, respectively).

Why? The director, writers and producers took the concept of the original series and mined its mythology as history. There are references galore to many of the original episodes and to five of the first six movies (except for the awful fifth one). The performances aren't caricatures; they actually build on what we expect the characters to have been like in their youth (but keep in mind this remains an alternate reality motif).

Especially outstanding are the internal struggles of Spock in finding his place as a vulcan with a human heritage (borrowing from the best of the cartoon episodes from the early 1970s) to McCoy's sly and all-too-human cynicism.  (A special nod to Zachary Quinto for his sublime performance as a young Spock.) There are so many great touches in the story, like including Capt. Pike, keeping Riverside, Iowa as the future home of Kirk and the uniforms and sound effects of the original (but updated to the 21st century). The ending was another nice nod to the original show.

The plot is a little thin and contrived at times. Nero is simply a new variation of Khan from STII and the original series. Albeit one decidedly less interesting because Eric Bana is not as strong an actor as Ricardo Montalban, at least not in this movie. Also because Nero lacks Khan's grandiose back story, the character's devastatingly complex and sometimes contradictory pathos, and his extraordinary magnetism.

I must admit that I have watched this new vision of Star Trek several times now and have enjoyed it each time. The casting of the young Enterprise crew is simply brilliant. Most look and sound extremely close to the originals while at the same time possessing a new uniqueness. The casting director was a major contributor to this film. These youngsters are a treat to watch and especially the interaction. This whole movie was filmed to be epic-like and I feel they have accomplished the task quite well. This movie is visually stunning. It has a Star Wars like quality to it. Action packed but a great drama at the same time, with some comedic moments sprinkled in. The only flaw I saw was that why did Nero spend all that time and effort going back in time to get his revenge on Spock, when he could have simply warned his planet of the coming supernova and tried to save as many lives as possible instead?

It's Star Trek for the lowest common denominator in which Kirk is an overgrown adolescent, Spock looks like he should be at high school, and most of the other characters are nothing like the great originals.  Most?  Well, fair's fair - the actor who playes Bones is indeed the real McCoy.  He's wonderful and the only thing of merit in the whole mess.

This movie continues along those lines. It isn't perfect, but the acting was very good and the characters were enjoyable. (Simon Pegg <3 - may you be given a larger part in the next film)

I actually really liked the reboot aspect. Alternate timelines have long been a Star Trek tradition and each series has at least one episode focusing on the concept.

It has the faster paced, larger than life feel of a modern movie but with the same heart and spirit of the TV series. All in all well worth a watch or two.",1346198400,,685,4.213740458015267

3471652,1,B001AVCFJM,"I am a Star Trek fan from day one when it premiered on TV.

Here was a TV show with intelligence, wit, characterization, thoughtful story lines, good actors who had real chemistry, and the cheesiest cardboard sets you could imagine.

What's not to like? It spun off many equally entertaining shows and has inspired the imaginations of many, some of whom became scientists and even went to work for NASA.

Fast forward to THIS film and we have lack of intelligence, mostly witlessness, a vague attempt at characterization, an impossible to believe story line, good actors with some degree of chemistry and enough CGI graphics to distract you from all its many faults.

So what's to like? If it spins off a sequel it will mean the end of civilization as we know it, and if it inspires anyone to apply to NASA based on the science in  this film, NASA will bounce them out the door!

Well, I'll try to say something nice because I actually like the movie, but only on the most superficial level. That's because the film is so superficial, any attempt at actually thinking about it gives me a headache.

Pros:

The actors in general are likeable, if a bit over the top at times, especially:

Chris Pine as a young and thoroughly rebellious James Tiberius Kirk. He brings plenty of energy to the role, although he's riding mostly on bravado and testosterone. Unfortunately, he doesn't look even remotely like William Shatner.

Zachary Quinto does a good job as a young Spock (Spock V2.0)and looks the part much more than Pine looks like Kirk. (Must be the ears.)

Leonard Nimoy returns as older Spock (Spock V1.0) and he's always a treat, though WHY he got involved in this mess is ""highly illogical"".

Karl Urban gives a nice turn as an earlier and less grouchy McCoy. I like him much better than I did DeForest Kelly!

Simon Pegg gives us a Scotty that James Doohan would find hard to recognize, but he is entertaining and engaging enough. But, of course, he still can't get the ships engines to function when they should. Some things never change.

Zoe Saldana gives us a new Uhura, one who is gorgeous (as was Nichelle Nichols) but this time her only ground breaking attribute is that she is the most brilliant linguist in the galaxy and can give Spock 2.0 an amazing lip lock on the transporter pad. It's not her fault, it's the dang script!

So, we have some good actors - necessary for entertainment, but is there anything else in this film to entertain?

Yes. If you like CGI and senseless cut-clip action. If you like your movies fast and dumb, this one's for you.

If you like to understand what is going on, then, maybe not.

And that's the problem with this movie. It makes absolutely no sense. Yet it is a conundrum, because in spite of its massive ""illogic"", it has entertainment value. You just have to put your brain on hold, and forget anything you might know about Star Trek the TV franchise, and science, to enjoy it.

Basically, it's a roller coaster ride of a movie, all hills and valleys at breakneck speed with no purpose other than to give a thrill, and certainly with no intention of carrying on the Star Trek tradition. It's about as much about Star Trek as ""Superman the Ride"" is about the ""Man of Steel"".

All sci-fi requires a certain suspension of disbelief, but this movie takes it to a level that is hard to beat. It seems to totally ignore the details and nuances of the ST Universe in favor of senseless thrill after senseless thrill.

Here are some examples, and why it seems like they got the script from a classroom full of third graders who were making it up as they went along while on a sugar high:

**** SPOILER ALERT *****

The crux of the matter is that the Star of the Romulus solar system is going Super Nova. Bad, bad star.

Okay, so far, we can go with that, it's been known to happen in other places in our actual Universe.

Now in the original ST Universe (which tried to follow science a lot more closely, while pushing the envelope), the Romulans are a pretty bright bunch. For one thing they run an Empire, for another, they have developed cloaking technology that not even the Federation can figure out, and finally, they drive their space ships based on a Quantum Singularity (which sometimes gets them into trouble with the physical Universe).

So a group of rather bright folks like the Romulans... they're caught by surprise by their star going Super Nova? Nowhere in their own vast Empire can they find ANYONE who has a clue about this? And, just how rapidly does a star go Super Nova? Is it like, one minute we have a star, the next minute BOOM?

Well, apparently, in THIS ST Universe, the Romulans are too dumb to notice the problem until, of course, it is too late. Yeah, this is TOTALLY logical!

Okay, to make it worse, the ONLY folks in the Universe who can help defeat the evil sudden Super Nova are the ... wait for it... Vulcans! Well, THAT certainly makes sense! Vulcans are even smarter than Romulans (though not smart enough to stay out of this silly movie).

Unfortunately, the Vulcans are busy with something or other, so they can only send an aging Mr. Spock in a tiny space ship that looks like a gyroscope on steroids, with the magical wonder substance ""Red Matter"". to deal with the evil Super Nova.

Makes perfect sense to me! One tiny drop of Red Matter is SO potent that it will turn a giant Super Nova into... please, wait for it... a black hole! (Hmmm, things seem to be going from bad to worse).

Who came up with this insanity? But hang on the plot get worse.

It turns out that one gigantic Romulan ship, a mining ship that, for some reason not explained, looks like shredded driftwood, has escaped the Super Nova, but only to see it consume the wonderful planet Romulus, killing every living soul on the planet.

The ship is captained by a character named ""Nero"", who has more tattoos than a tattoo parlor and wears a long leather trench coat (in a space ship). He is absolutely furious at... the Federation!

Yes, he has decided that the Super Nova is the fault of the Federation, and in particular, Mr. Spock, because he arrived too late with his magic ""Red Matter"" to prevent the Super Nova by creating a much safer black hole. As we all know, Vulcan is a member of the Federation, so in reverse logic, let's see now... Bad Spock, bad Vulcan, bad Federation, dumb, dumb -- er, I mean poor, poor, Romulans.

Yeah, I think I get it.

The name Nero and the Trench coat are throwbacks to ""The Matrix"", of course, for no other reason that, well, he -- Neo of the Matrix looked spiffy in that movie - except he had hair, so ""Nero"" looks like a ""Neo"" wannabe.

Moving right along (as this movie does, it at least has a very fast pace), after the tardy Spock creates the Back Hole, he and Nero and the super gigantic driftwood spaceship get sucked into the thing, and, surprise, surprise, go back in time to when life was simpler and the Federation was just about to launch the first version of the Star Ship Enterprise. But they appear in a distant part of the galaxy where there just happens to be one of those pesky Federation star ships. Oh joy, Nero can begin taking insane revenge!

(One would think he'd instead go to Romulus to warn them of the upcoming Super Nova, but Noooo, that would make sense!)

Nero destroys this first Federation space ship (Spock is off somewhere or confused or something so he can't prevent it... he's useless as a super hero) which kills among others, the parents of James Tiberius Kirk, who, like the baby Kal-El of Superman fame, escapes the carnage and winds up on Earth. Hooray!

There he grows up as a rebellious young man who, for some reason decides to join Star Fleet. Yeah, every rebellious youth wants to be in the military... it's the spiffy uniforms, you know, real chick magnets.

At this point it goes from bad to worse, so much so that I don't want to rehash it. But with just this little bit, anyone can see what a dreg this movie plot is.

They try to excuse most of it by saying that this is an ""Alternate"" Universe (but not the one with Evil Kirk and Evil Spock like we saw in the TV series). As the saying goes, ""That dog won't hunt"" for a number of reasons:

1. The Star Ship Enterprise is bigger and looks vastly more advanced than the original Enterprise, or even the later 1701 series (as in STNG and the earlier Star Trek movies).

2. The Star Ship Enterprise has a bridge inspired by a department store, or an Apple iPod. Everything is White and LED Blue, and bright enough to blind you. That's because these are the GOOD guys, and good guys always wear white!

3. Nero's advanced from-the-future Romulan Ship is even bigger than the bigger Enterprise, but apparently the Romulans have no concept of interior design, in fact they don't even have interior lighting to speak of. So this ship is BLACK. Bad guys always wear black.

4. The main engine area of Star Ship Enterprise looks like a cross between a waste water treatment plant and a brewery (actually, it was filmed in a brewery and it seems like the writers made an ample sampling of the product). I guess the Dilithium crystals have to be soaked in water (or beer) in order to work right, and maybe the water (or beer) is needed to cool down the anti-matter injectors or something. Yeah, if I was building a space ship, I'd fill it with tanks of water (or beer).

5. Nero's ship has something of a plumbing problem. There's a foot of water everywhere. I would suspect that the toilets backed up, but as everyone knows, there are no toilets on space ships. However, the vast amount of water may account for Nero's bad attitude. He's probably suffering from trench foot from standing in that water for so long.

6. When Nero and his wonder ship attack the planet Vulcan (intent -- turn it into a black hole to teach those tardy Vulcans a lesson) they drop this ""mining drill"" platform into the upper atmosphere. The Vulcans are, of course, so taken by surprise, and so incredibly incompetent, that they have NO space ships or planetary defenses (thus taking pacifism to an extreme that borders on foolishness) that they are powerless and must ask Earth to send star ships to help.

7. Nero gets Captain Pike to reveal Earth's super secret defense codes by making him eat a bug. No, really! Okay, that one's been done before in the ""Wrath of Kahn"", only they stuck the bug in someone's ear. Both are gross and insulting to bugs.

8. Ensign Chekov is 17 years old. Not old enough to have a driver's license, but old enough to pilot a star ship. And the Federation is exploiting minors, which is only fair, because Nero is exploiting miners.

9. Kirk and friends sky dive into the atmosphere of Vulcan wearing only skin tight jump suits and what look like bicycle helmets. They don't build up any heat during the rapid descent, heck, they don't even smoke (smoking is bad)! I bet NASA would love to know what that material is!

10. Spock gets mad at Kirk (almost everyone gets mad at Kirk at least once during this movie) and throws him off the ship, abandoning him on an ice planet called Delta Vega. Okay, I guess they haven't got a brig on the massive new Enterprise -- too many beer -- er, water tanks I think. And Spock was angry, after all. Does Starfleet allow a junior officer acting as Captain the authority to throw someone off the dang space ship? (Regulations, what regulations?)

11. On Delta Vega, Kirk is chased by a toothy sort of polar bear-walrus thing, which is obviously hungry -- or Kirk got it mad just by being there. Fair enough, go chase Kirk. Well, in no time a BIG, red, other thing with four toothy lips (which look a lot like the sand worms in Dune), probably also hungry, bursts through an ice pack and grabs the polar bear thing in its ""jaws"". Now, does it EAT the bigger polar bear thing? Of course not. It spits it out and chases Kirk! That's because Kirk probably, like all humans, tastes like chicken, and who can resist a nice chicken dinner? Or, Kirk made it mad at him.

12. Kirk eventually gets onto Nero's ship and has a clear shot at him so he could disable him or outright kill him. Does he? No, he asks Nero to surrender. Uh, yeah, that's realistic! Of course, in the time it takes for him to do that, Nero jumps Kirk and we have a smashing good fight! Nero is a champion fighter, evidenced by his super strength in spite of wearing that cumbersome trench coat. It must be cold on his ship.

13. Kirk wins the fight and rescues Captain Pike. Pike is apparently held down to a table with duct tape. (Did we run out of budget here?)

14. Skipping ahead (because it gets even sillier) we wind up with:

Spock saves Earth from the mining drill by shooting it to bits with his gyroscope space ship's lasers (er- phasers). Apparently, Earth has no cannons, missiles or anything even closely resembling this armament.

We get another black hole thing but this time, it doesn't cause a time distortion and the Enterprise escapes the pull of the black hole by ejecting and  blowing up the warp core (thus making it impossible to fly the ship, but never mind that).

FINALLY, the grateful Federation and Star Fleet have a BIG ceremony where they give Kirk a decoration for valor and ignore everyone else involved in the adventure. Even though Kirk had been a very bad boy and cheated on an exam, they promote him to the rank of Captain and assign him to the Enterprise. Yeah, that makes sense.

Spock, who outranks Kirk throughout the earlier part of the film, comes aboard the Enterprise and takes up position as science officer, thus closing the gap between this horrible movie and the start of the TV series. He's perfectly fine with serving under Kirk, who cheated on the test Spock gave him as his instructor, who jumped him in rank during the battle by tricking him into revealing that he actually HAS emotions, and whom he threw off the space ship in the first place.

Yeah, Spock has the patience of a saint.

And anyone with any intelligence will need something similar to watch this movie without being angered by all the absolute foolishness going on in it.

It's not that this is a bad film. It's quite entertaining in its own way.

The problem is that the film insults anyone's intelligence with all the sloppy, shoddy and downright wrong science and disregard for the original Star Trek.

If this is the future of the federation, maybe the Empire of Star Wars better come back and take over.

At this point, I'm rooting for the Klingons.

Watch this move for fun, action, high speed chases, and the exhilaration of youth (I'm thinking 6 year old maybe) but leave your brain at the door.

You won't need it, in fact, watching this movie may actually LOWER your intelligence.

And that's the exact opposite of what Gene Roddenberry was trying to do.

3471654,5,B001AVCFJM,"First let me say that I have never been a fan of anything Star Trek related, until I saw this movie when it hit theaters in the summer of 2009. I've been a fan of the Star Wars saga for a while, and have never even made an attempt to get into Star Trek. That said, this is one of the greatest science fiction films to be released in the last couple of decades. Without a shadow of a doubt, it's definitely in my top ten of 2009, and that's saying a lot because that was a stellar year for film, and the sci-fi genre (with Avatar, Moon and District 9). This is what summer action blockbusters are supposed to be. The action is not the only thing that makes Star Trek amazing though. In my opinion, it's not even the best thing about the movie. I love the multi-dimensional relationships between the eventual crew of the Enterprise. Zachary Quinto's casting was a questionable decision at first, but he soon proved to be the perfect choice to play Spock. Chris Pine shot up to number two on my list of favorite overly self-confident, cocky leads. Right behind Robert Downey Jr. in Iron Man, and before Christian Bale in Batman. His portrayal of James T. Kirk is simply brilliant. The two of them share some of the best scenes, bickering throughout the film, like an old married couple. The rest of the cast is fantastic as well.

Zoe Saldana is great as Uhura, in the first of her two amazing sci-fi movies of 2009. The unrecognizable Eric Bana is terrifying as the Romulan villain Nero. My second favorite performance in the film is Simon Pegg as a hilarious Scottish engineer, cleverly named Scotty. These are just a few names in a cast full of great performances, and surprising cameos. The first time I watched it in theatres I had a little trouble getting past Anton Yelchin's accent as Chekov, but after a few more views it stopped bothering me. Overall, I love JJ Abram's Star Trek. Abrams is already one of my favorite filmmakers of this generation. I consider him one of the best science fiction minds we have in the industry today. Before I saw this film I would never have imagined myself getting excited for a Star Trek movie. It's good enough to turn a devoted Star Wars fan into somewhat of a Trekky. I still can't watch the tv series though. Honestly, it bores me. But as far as the rebooted franchise goes, it's gold. Great Movie. And the transfer is pure reference quality. No question, this is a must own Blu-ray. The extras are so incredibly thorough that it's worth it to search for this release, and stay far away from the single disc version.

3471659,1,B001AVCFJM,"I love the Star Trek franchise so much I want to see a new Star Trek series! A lot of fan hopes are riding on this film! To drive this point home - I actually stopped watching television programing completely once Enterprise (the last Star Trek series) went off the air about 7+ years ago! And, I have literally watched every TV episode (and film) of every Star Trek series, in real time, since its inception in 1966! I also collect rare vintage Star Trek memorabilia, have heard Leonard Nimoy, and many others involved with Star Trek, speak at various Science Fiction Conventions from the early 1970's to the present, and I subscribed to a Star Trek fanzine, ""Trexperts,"" edited by a one dedicated Star Trek fan, which is still mailed all over the world! Needless to say, the Star Trek universe has had a huge impact on my life!

I sincerely hope someone from Hollywood reads this review! In the long run (and that's what Star Trek is all about) you're not going to win new fans by dumbing-down Star Trek into a comic book story solely to satisfy the fickle teen market! I realize a lot of the previous 11 Star Trek movies have been box office flops (and for good reason!) because IT'S ABOUT THE STORY, STUPID! Sure the special-effects-eye-candy is spectacular, the cinematography does not disappoint and the design of the sets are absolutely amazing! The acting ranged from excellent (the New Captain Kirk & Leonard McCoy) to sufficient (the new and original Mr. Spock). And, all the supporting cast certainly held their own! But the story was so unimaginative and preposterous, it came across as nothing more than boring cardboard drivel.

It kind of boggles the mind! There are absolutely an endless number of Science Fiction themes that run through all the various Star Trek episodes. What more could you want? You have about 26 YEARS worth of episode ideas to choose from! Then there are plenty of ideas Star Trek has not explored which is summarized in a single 900+ pages book covering most Science Fiction ever written in any language in the world:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anatomy-of-Wonder-A-Critical-Guide-to-Science-Fiction/dp/1591581710/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anatomy of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction</a>. It doesn't take a genius to do the research to come up with new and wonderful ideas! But no!

What an incredible insult to all the Star Trek fans that have spent their time and money supporting Star Trek over the years by watching only God knows how many vapid TV commercials or spending their money on film tickets, videos, DVD sets, books & fan magazines, convention tickets and Star Trek memorabilia!

3471664,5,B001AVCFJM,"While strict believers in Star Trek canon may have some trouble with the idea of an alternate-storyline Trekiverse adventure, this movie has likely saved the franchise from exiting stage left at the last Starfleet outpost.

  My father and I are old-time Star Trek fans and we were there on opening-night when this movie came out. At the time we had trouble with certain things. Not the growing romance between Spock and Uhura so much- that was a nice touch actually. What bothered us more than anything was the destruction of Vulcan and the alternate- read bogus- series of events that took place after. Some things are just best left alone we thought.

  Fast forward to now. I had put off buying this movie for a long time, opting to pout about the changes that I did not exactly like. Finally, at the insistence of my wife I went ahead and bought it on sale here at Amazon for $9.99. It was cheap so why not? So we put it in and watched. I had an epiphany to say the least.

  I love the classics and some of the Star Trek episodes and movies of the past are just that to me- classics. So I was surprised when re-watching Star Trek 2009 that the changes no longer bothered me. In fact, the gusto which the new cast brought to their roles and the energy that seemed to spring from the new interpretation was very moving. I couldn't take my eyes off it this time around. It is a good movie let me tell you.

  I do not know what gave way. Maybe it was the changes that have occurred in my life since 2009 that changed my tune. I did get married and move out of state for the first time ever. Or maybe it was the effects of the economic downfall. Whatever it was, I realized that Star Trek in its old incarnation had reached the end of the line and run out of gas. The reboot gave it what it needed to survive- a new purpose and actors who are fresh on the scene to whom the Trekiverse is exciting rather than just a day on the job. As Zen Buddhist philosophy dictates- without change we die. Maybe this was for the best.

  I will not give away more plot details for those who have not watched the movie already but I will heartily recommend it.

3471667,3,B001AVCFJM,"The public had grown really tired of the Star Trek franchise by the time Nemesis came out in December 2002. It flopped against strong competition from Harry Potter and Frodo Baggins, and it was mostly hated by the fans who choked chat rooms and message boards with complaints about massive plot holes and lost potential. Seven years later (a record between Trek movies) overrated director JJ Abrams decided to reboot the Star Trek universe by literally sending it off on a new tangent from the very beginning with a time travel plot (the third time the franchise has used time travel as a plot device).

Just as baby Kirk comes into the universe a big, ugly Romulan mining ship appears out of a black hole and makes a big, ugly dent in the space-time continuum. Twenty-two years later Kirk has grown into a rebellious punk and signs up for Star Fleet academy where he excels at pushing his luck. Once aboard the Enterprise the armada is called to a lightning storm above Vulcan where the big, ugly Romulan ship destroys the planet with 'red matter', a substance which creates a black hole. Kirk wants to pursue the Romulan ship, but rival Spock dumps him on Hoth...I mean Delta Vega. There, in a ludicrous example of script coincidences pushing their luck, he meets older Spock, who has also time-travelled, and Scotty.

Scotty and Kirk beam themselves back to the enterprise and go fight the big, ugly Romulan ship before they destroy Earth too, conveniently choosing to drill down to the core right outside Star Fleet Academy. It's all very pretty eye-candy, but the plot doesn't quite add-up, the villain seems cursory, and there isn't really enough for the main characters to do. Doc McCoy isn't in it as much as he should be, and Uhura is virtually demoted to an extra.

My main problem with Star Trek is that it has none of the darkness or epic feel of some of the better movies. JJ Abrams fills the movie with a million lens flares and set-pieces but nothing feels like its for the ages. It's a Star Trek for the video-game generation of kids born without patience. It's Star Trek for those who demand instant satisfaction, and the polar opposite of the 1979 Robert Wise movie.

I still prefer the Next Generation crew.

I had just watched William Shatner's documentary of ""The Captains"" which is awesome and this enticed me to watch this movie.  Now I am waiting for more, more more!!

3471669,4,B001AVCFJM,"OK, let me get the bad-mouthing out of my system and then I'll move on to giving the movie its deserved due.

""Star Trek"" (2009) is an absolute load of peanut butter when it comes to a coherent, believable story. I'll try to avoid spoilers while saying what I have to say, which is basically this: This whole idea of a supernova threatening the planet Romulus is absolute stupidity. Wherever this supernova was, it certainly was NOT Romulus' own sun. Given the vast distances between interstellar objects, and given the scientific abilities of the Romulans in the 24th century, THERE IS JUST NO WAY that the Romulan people would have been destroyed by this celestial event. They would have evacuated the planet, if nothing else, and would have had plenty of time to do so, even AFTER Spock's ""red matter"" solution (whatever the bleep THAT is) had failed. So the whole premise of the Romulan Nero being enraged by Spock's failure is quite simply ... ludicrous.

ALL RIGHT ... all that amounts to mere nitpicking. ""Star Trek"" always has dabbled in suspect science; warp drive itself is an apparent violation (or evasion) of Einstein. What made the original series, and its sucessors, and most of the movies successful is the spirit of the whole enterprise (pun intended), including the strong characterizations of the crew. And that's where the 2009 reboot of ""Star Trek"" gets it right.

First of all, the casting is impeccable. Not just Chris Pine as Captain Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock, but ALL the main characters. Karl Urban is just ornery enough as Dr. McCoy, Zoe Saldana absolutely sparkles as Uhura, John Cho captures Sulu's calm and good humor, Anton Yelchin plays up Chekhov's weirdness, and, best of all, Simon Pegg makes Scotty even more comically relieving than the original.

The actors clearly like and respect one another, whereas in the original cast, there was some significant resentment on the part of some toward William Shatner. The result is a more ensemble feel which serves this film quite well.

And the story, absurd as it is, does careen along at warp speed. The pace of the movie is, for the most part, breakneck, and you can't help being carried along by it.

Finally, the special effects: They are, quite simply, the best in ""Trek"" history.

In short, the movie won me over despite my considerable objections to the story. I do hope that the sequel makes a little more sense. Meanwhile, this first re-imagining is, if nothing else, a REALLY good time.",1340755200,2,2488,4.812646370023419

3471673,1,B001AVCFJM,"*SPOILERS AHEAD!*

Simply put, this is the worst Star Trek film to come out in recent history.  It makes Star Trek: Insurrection look like an Oscar winner!  The only thing going for this movie is a great cast of actors.  They played the parts extremely well (mega props to Zachary Quinto for playing a spot-on Spock).  However, the story and plot lines as a whole are just awful and bring complete disgrace to the Star Trek canon.

For one thing, the villain (Nero) was just awful.  That is NOT how a Romulan is supposed to act!  He acts way too human to be a Romulan.  The fact that both Romulus AND Vulcan were destroyed completely upsets the Star Trek canon forever.  That was an AWFUL move for the writers to make, and frankly, if Gene Roddenberry was alive during the making of this film, he would have made sure that it never got past the screenplay stage.  One look at the script, and he would have lit it on fire.

Another thing:  Spock and Uhura have a love tryst going on?  BLECH!  That's just downright awful.  Winona Ryder playing Spock's mother, Amanda?  Another bad call.  The fact that she was murdered?  Again, ANOTHER bad call.  Also, when Spock ejected Kirk onto the ice planet, what were the chances of him finding the elder Spock there also?  C'mon!  It's too much of a coincidence, and that's another display of terrible writing.  Lastly, how DARE they even use the original theme in the end credits!  Shame on them!

I honestly don't know how they can even consider making a sequel to this decrepit film.  It's clearly a slap in the face to all that Star Trek is known for.  I'll make a bet that Leonard Nimoy stopped attending Star Trek conventions because he received too much flack for contributing to the destruction of the Star Trek canon in this film.  Pass this one up, folks, and stick with all the movies that came before it.  I feel so sorry for today's generation of youth.",1340236800,4,1906,4.491228070175438

3471677,1,B001AVCFJM,"The 2009 ""Star Trek"" re-imagines the original crew as a mutual-admiration club of narcissistic youngsters, with Kirk (Chris Pine) as chief narcissist.  It aims to appeal to younger viewers while mollifying old-time trekkies, while pandering to the worst qualities of both.  The best aspects of the 1966 TV series have long since been forgotten.

Have you ever looked at the night sky in awe?  Have you ever enjoyed the beautiful feeling of being just a little person in a vast, vast universe?  If so, this film is not for you.  I have never seen a space movie so perversely determined not to let you see any stars.  All the space shots are claustrophobic, saturated with looming ships, looming planets, debris, mist, flares and other obstacles, tightly arranged to blot out any suggestion of vast distance.  And this is only fitting -- any vision of the vastness of space might interfere with the glorification of Jim Kirk's godlike ego.

The absence of stars is matched by the absence of trek.  A ""trek"" is a long and arduous journey, and the phrase ""Star Trek"" originally referred to the ""five-year mission"" which took the Enterprise far beyond Earth into unexplored regions of space, where the Captain and crew were essentially on their own and beyond help, and where each episode began and ended in deep space.  It resurrected the fantastic travelers' tales of yore, of voyages to uncharted islands, before technology made the world small.  But here, our heroes zoom back and forth between Kirk's house (Earth) and Spock's house (Vulcan) like joyriding teenagers.  Assuming they manage to further bloat their egos by saving the universe - or whatever - you can be sure they will manage to make it home for supper.  Will Kirk's parent-surrogates in Starfleet eventually reward him with his very own hot-rod?  Can you stand the suspense?

The plot is extremely dumb on countless levels, which, to avoid spoilers, I won't go into.  I will mention one thing (which is far from the worst offense) simply because I have seen no-one else mention it:  Why would Starfleet rely on parachutes for a space-jump, when they clearly have super-advanced propulsion systems?  Even James Bond had jet packs.

Remember that old Star Trek episode where where a virus had infected the crew, driving them insane and revealing hidden aspects of their personalities; where Sulu was running around with a sword for no good reason; where Riley kept singing 'Kathleen'; and where we had a confrontation between a red-faced Kirk and a weeping Spock.  Well, this movie is sort of like that, except that, since no virus is involved, the crew will presumably never return to normal.  All the characters are caricatures.  Spock in particular is an extremely emotional guy:  He is vengeful, snogs pretty girls in front of fellow crew, responds to verbal taunting with fits of violent rage, and is clearly attached to his mommy.  He is emotionless only in the sense that he is not quite as out-of-control as the hysterical Kirk.  Scotty and Chekov have been turned into comic figures, and are presumably inspired by the theory that there is something inherently funny about folks who speak differently.  Couldn't they have found an actor to play Scotty who actually knew the old dialect, and did not see anything especially funny about it?  Too much to expect, I guess.",1339718400,14,3340,4.916071428571429

Of course it has it's fair share of critics, but even though I am a big Classic Trek fan, I knew I would still like this. But finally watching it it blew my exceptions out the water. It was terrific! I never expected it to be not only full of really thoughtful moments but really funny and whimsical too. It has a great sense of wonder about it. It never takes itself too too seriously, but it keeps that intensity and tight action too.

I loved the performances of everyone as the classic characters. But what really stood out was, Chris Pine really fit the role quite well as Kirk and he added something new but I could still see a little tiny bit of Shatner mannerisms in there...I don't know if that's just me or not, but it was great. Really good job. Karl Urban as Bones McCoy, where to start! He channeled McCoy perfectly! He was funny, snarky, and had a great dynamic with Pine's Kirk. Simon Pegg as Scotty, awesome. Also Zac Quinto! Awesome! It was a little strange at first seeing him as Spock when your'e so used to watching Leonard Nemoy, but that goes away pretty quickly. He also added so much more to Spock with his own way of performing the role, with the way he carried himself, and said things. He really knew how to play a guy who was fighting to control his strong emotions and kind of failing. Also he had this awesome swagger about him and he was just so fresh with it. Really loved his Spock a lot. And of course Leonard Nemoy was amazing. It was so good to see him as future Spock, and it was really nice to see that the filmmakers wanted to honor the history of Kirk and Spock's friendship and what it means to all of us. Nimoy's scenes were breathtaking and touching.

Everyone did their part, and everyone was great. The music too, I loved the music. Very souring, but not overpowering, and it pulls you right in.

In short, I loved this movie. I would recommend it to anyone and for those not really that sure about a lot of adaptations, I would say give this one a chance. It pays great respect to the original, while also standing well on it's own and in it's own right.

I had really hoped to see more of the Academy years with the characters we're all familiar with before having them go on a space mission. I actually liked that it wasn't a remake of the pilot episode of Star Trek. The relationship between Spock and Uhura was interesting. The tie ins such as the Kobayashi Maru test and Kirk's allergy were nice to see. The action scenes were good.

Unfortunately, it fell back to the problems of other Star Trek movies. It spends too much time on a new character/s. The villain comes across as silly and ineffective as a truly threatening menace. The writers couldn't come up with better terminology for an important element of the story, calling it ""the red matter."" It seemed to be copying Star Wars in certain parts. Some scenes are hokey; some, illogical.

3471689,5,B001AVCFJM,"I'd give it six or seven stars if I could, but I suspect some of that is nostalgia. Still, this movie lives up to the hype, and these days you can't say more than that. But of course I will.

We start with Jim Kirk's birth, only seconds before his father's death. It's a major piece of drama, and I wouldn't spoil it by telling you any more than that. But I will warn fans of the original Star Trek that we are in an alternate universe here, and not everything is consistent with what you remember. That's OK, though, because it is eventually explained. By Leonard Nemoy, of all people.

Of course, every time the Enterprise goes into warp drive, they are traveling in time as much as in space; that's the only way to understand the warp drive. But this movie raises the ante on that poorly-understood fact, and makes the basic plot line depend upon it. It may make you dizzy, but you'll enjoy every minute of it.

I like the young Kirk better than I did the mature one, and in some ways I like the young Spock better, too. Well, differently, anyway. We also get to know the young Uhuru, McCoy, Scotty, Checkov and Sulu. All look enough like their later counterparts to avoid confusion, and provide an interesting back-story for how they came to serve together. (But remember that pesky time paradox.)

Now here's my guilty secret: I also like the Romulans. Oh, not like in the sense of wanting to be physically near any of them, but for finding them interesting characters. They have elaborate tattoos on their faces, apparently as individual recognition, and they are bald. They also wear long black leather coats and remind me strongly of the Matrix. And we even get insight into what's making them so mean and hateful.

This is a movie for all the old fans, and all the new fans, too. And a great one for grandparents and grandchildren to bridge the gap. We know they laugh at the special effects of the original TV series; but we can enjoy the modern special effects and also the very human (or at least half-human) characters we have loved for so long.",1336867200,,2058,4.477333333333333

3471691,1,B001AVCFJM,"The action and special effects are great, but this movie shouldn't be called ""Star Trek."" All of the main characters in the movie have different personalities than their counterparts in the original series. For example, in the movie Kirk is rebellious, rude, arrogant, and very annoying. In the original series, Kirk has none of those qualities.

The movie also does things that contradict the original series. For example, in the movie the planet Vulcan is destroyed. But, in the series Vulcan is intact. Also, Captain Pike promotes Kirk to First Officer for no reason. In the original series, Kirk earned the rank of Captain. All of these changes are annoying and very unnecessary. Why couldn't the director and writers keep the movie more similar to the original series?

There are also a lot of problems with the plot. If a star went super nova, a black hole wouldn't be able to ""suck up"" the star! Also, even if the black hole could ""suck up"" the star, the star would then disappear, and everyone on Romulus would freeze to death. An advanced society like the Romulans would know that their star is about to go super nova and evacuate their entire planet.

Also, time travel violates the Temporal Directive, and Star Fleet has a division that investigates and corrects occurrences of time travel. If a Romulan ship traveled 129 years into the past, Star Fleet would send a team to intercept and destroy the ship!",1336348800,13,1417,4.799180327868853

What I didn't like about this movie was the obvious desire to seperate this movie from about 50 years of cinema and TV history. JJ Abrams beat us over the head in telling us that he's rebooting the franchise that it became exhausting. We get it! You're trying to bring in new fans! Just don't disappoint too many of the old fans in the process, which is what happened. It's an exciting and even funny movie but I'm not sure if the die-hard fans will enjoy it as much.

I must say, though, that this film did not disappoint.  The casting for this update was truly great, and in true original series fashion, the interaction between the characters makes the movie.  As for the plot, again, the long-time Star Trek fan will not be disappointed.  The writing staff gives nod to the original series but frames the new story in such a way that the new adventures do not clash with the original story.  This is not the typical ""old series makeover"" that has become so popular in recent times.  A definite good addition to any Trekkie's collection!",1333929600,,770,4.930232558139535
3471704,5,B001AVCFJM,"I just wanted to post my two cents on this film. If you haven't seen this on FX, you need to at least rent it for the experience.

Hats off to J.J. Abrams for this movie. Excellent cast and acting (Chris Pine, Zach Quinto, John Cho, Simon Pegg). Superb, and I mean SUPERB special effects that make you feel you are actually there. What a great script. Not one slow moment. And thank you Leonard Nimoy for gracing this movie with your role.

You have all read the reviews, and by now know the actors and the plot. Young Kirk, young Spock, young Bones, blah blah....it's all about the beginnings.

If you like excellent (NOT lousy Sci_Fy Channel crap) Sci-fi. you will love this movie. If you are into special effects that put you right smack dab in the middle of it, you will love this movie. If you are a Trek Fan (I watched everything `Star Trek' from the day the series first premiered on tv, plus Deep Space Nine, ST Next Gen, etc....) you will love this movie. It is THE BEST of the franchise, period. Even better than ST4(The Whale movie).",1333238400,,1044,4.371134020618556

3471709,5,B001AVCFJM,"Great film!  It's, in my opinion, a little better than the original movies.  This is because it explains a little more like where Kirk and Spock are from and how they got into Starfleet.  The other films just don't seem to do that.  It also let's us see the relationships that we're so used to start to form.  The film also explains what happened to Captain Pike in a way that the show didn't.  I mean with the show, we know what happens with Pike, but it's never really explained.  The film also explains how and why Kirk becomes captain of the Enterprise.  I would recommend this film to anyone.

3471713,4,B001AVCFJM,"Overall a good movie for people who don't like drawn out scene's. Its faced paced and always changing. It can be kinda hard to keep up the first time you watch it but it makes you want to watch it again to see if you caught everything. References to the original series are apparent enough that even non-trekkis will catch them, things like ""Dammit man, i'm a doctor, not a physicist"" and ""I'm given her all she's got, Captain!"" Remaster of the original theme gives an epic soundtrack, visuals are awesome. The storyline is a little too linear, without much time to think about what could have happened. There are like 4 kisses throughout the whole movie, which I like because I hate being into a story and then I have to sit through some drawn out love scene staring at some dude's butt and wondering when are we going to get back to stuff that matters. This movie gives you about a 20 second break from the main story every now and then just to show that other stuff is happening. By the end of the movie, you are wishing there was more movie. Partly because you are interested in the story but also because you feel like some of the story was skipped. The movie starts with new cadets who are on the virge of graduating after 3 years at the academy and two hours later, one cadet is Captain, another is a Lt., and Spock who started as a Commander, makes it to First Officer. It all happens kinda quick, so try to keep up and hopefully it makes some kinda sense by the end. The story is constantly moving, the visuals are awesome, the soundtrack is epic, the actors are pretty good, there's plenty of action, plenty of humor, a small love story to the side, there's even a convertible Corvette and some Beastie Boys in there too.",1331424000,,1731,4.37888198757764

3471715,5,B001AVCFJM,"WARNING SPOILERS! When I first saw the Trailer for this movie I thought it would truly suck or would be a amazing movie, I didn't think there would be any middle ground. This movie was amazing.

I am a Star Trek fan, by no means am I what people call a Trekkie. I will never play dress up for any show or movie outside of Halloween. I Still have some semblance of a life. Still I am a big Star Trek fan. I've seen about half the episodes of the original series, all the movies, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, about half the Voyager and Enterprise. I was sadly disappointed with the last few Trek films, they were huge disappointments. So I was hoping this would be a good film and I was right.

1. Story: The story was pretty good. Time travel plots and become convoluted, but J.J. Abrams and the writers did a wonderful job of keeping everything together. I like how the created a alternate time line so they can create their own Trek universe for the sequels guaranteed to come. The only flaw was the bad guy Nero/Eric Bana. I don't know he just didn't seem to fit in.

2. Characters/Actors: This was perhaps the best part of the film. J.J. Abrams and the writers again brought new life to these classic characters. Chirs Pine/James T Kirk did a amazing job, and I really did think that would be the young kirk. Zachary Quinto/Spock was great. I like how he brought Spock to life and took him in another direction than I thought they would go. Karl Urban/Leonard McCoy did a really good job. Unlike the actors above I've seen a few of Urban's films and he's a good actor. Leonard Nimoy/Spock what else can you say but fantastic. When I first heard he was going to be in the film I thought it would be for a few seconds, but he has a major role. Nimoy is as good as ever as Spock. When I think about it this movie really was about Spock and his life. Eric Bana/Nero was the only bad one in this film. I really like him as a actor but this film wasn't right for him or maybe it was how the character was written. All the other actors from Bruce Greenwood, Winona Ryder to Ben Cross did really good jobs.

3. Special Effects: Done by ILM were just stunning, and some moments will leave you breathless.

4. Music: The score by Michael Giacchino was riveting.

5. Directing: I was really surprised J.J. Abrams did a great job.

Overall: A really great film and the third best Trek film. Behind Star Trek II: The Wraith on Khan and Star Trek IV: The Undiscovered Country. Now I can't wait for a new Trek film.",1331164800,,2512,4.286919831223629

While the story-line isn't the greatest, I thought it moved along at a nice pace while leaving open a lot of things for audience interpretation.

3471719,5,B001AVCFJM,"I think if someone was to ask me to name the most underrated film in the last twenty years I would probably name this film. I know there has never been a film with so much heritage to live up to than this film. Think about it. How many Star Trek films have there been? How many fantastic versions of Star Trek are there? This film had so much to live up to a lot of people said no matter what was produced it would fail.

All I can say is, that the first twenty minutes of Star Trek (2009) was the best minutes of any Star Trek production and possibly any sci-fiction film period. The first scene was just simply a masterpiece and there is no other way to put it. The first scene if there has been a perfect scene in Sci-Fi this was it.

As the rest of the film, it was warp nine and phasers full the whole way. This film was like a explosion in that from the very beginning to the end it was pure adrenalin. I personally went in expecting an ok film, such as all the other Star trek films have been but I was so surprised. This film, for my money is as good as it gets. Sci-fi at its very best. It didn't take itself too seriously nor did it offend those of us who grew up loving Star Trek.

The purpose of this film was if anything to reboot out minds in what to expect from this type of film. And it did with bells on.

Plot wise it was nothing particularly deep, bad guys comes and the good guys have to defeat him, so it wasn't the plot of the film that made it so good it was the journey it took to tell the tale.

For those of you who loved the very original cast, you will not be disappointed. It was so obvious that almost all the actors studied at great length their predecessors not so much in that they mimicked them but honoured their acting style and honoured the characters they originated. With two exceptions, Uhura and Chekov. However these two characters were never fully flushed before so the new actors re-invented them and made them so much more interesting and admirable.  Chekov is a boy genius and very likeable and Uhura exceedingly bright and refreshingly sexy. In the film her and Spock are a couple.

So as you can see the film is amazing. The only thing I would ask is to watch it on a big screen with a good sound system. This film is supposed to be bigger than life and on a small screen it would lack so much.

The extras on the DVD/Bluray are fantastic. The interview with Abrams on rebooting the franchise is great as so is the gag (blooper) reel. However, the deleted scenes steal the show. I would have paid the price of the DVD to just to get them. I wish they had inserted them into the film though.

I especially like Chris Pine, but also absolutely love casting of Spock, Montgomery Scott, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu and Bones. And the young Kirk with the corvette at the beginning is one of my favorite parts! They all make this movie worth watching again and again, which I have done! I think the story itself is a good one. It has a lot of action, start to finish, and some very funny parts, too, like when Bones keeps injecting Kirk (Pine) to get him on to the Enterprise. Very funny! I think the only negative for me is it ended! I don't think you have to be a Star Trek fan of the late 60s original TV series (or any of the others) to appreciate this movie either.

3471725,4,B001AVCFJM,"Well, I have watched this movie a few times now over the last couple of years and thought that I'd chime in with a little review about it myself. I'd love to give this film a 5 star rating, I really would, but I just can't bring myself to do it. Sure it has all of the elements that make for a great Sci Fi action movie, which is one of my favorite movie categories ever. It's got great space battles, cool spaceships, weird aliens, exciting action sequences, and some of the greatest characters that ever graced TV and movie screens, Captain James T. Kirk, Spock, Bones McCoy, Scotty and all of the rest. I practically grew up with Star Trek and have loved it since I can remember--But, this movie just has way too many flaws that are hard to ignore.

Firstly, I don't really have much of a problem with the cast, I think that for the most part they picked some pretty decent actors to represent the U.S.S. Enterprise crew. My problem with it mostly is that while the makers of this film had a good and noble idea to try and make Star Trek more exciting to modern day viewers by making it more action-packed like a Star Wars movie, BUT, they ended up copying just a little bit too much from Star Wars for my liking. You've heard it all before I'm sure and I don't want to drag down on this review with a lot of rehashed complaints that other reviewers have already exponentionally expounded on but, [Spoiler Alert!] the scene where Kirk gets exiled on the frozen planet Delta Vega, I mean, come on...I was thinking at the back of my mind about Luke Skywalker on Hoth all the way during this scene. But, then again, what other kind of planet surface haven't the Star Wars films already been featured prominently on? We've got desert landscapes, jungle landscapes, frozen wastelands, swamps, I mean, there's only so many landscapes available to strand Kirk on, but...Oh well. Anyway...

Time travel. C'mon now, enough already with the time travel storylines. It's been way overdone in the Star Trek universe. And Romulans?! Enough already with them as well! The last movie before this one featured the villain Shinzon, which, while not an actual Romulan himself, was a clone of Captain Picard created by the Romulans for nefarious purposes, but...He was bald, and while not an actual Romulan, is still pretty much similar to the bald Romulan villain in J.J. Abrams movie, Nero, without all of the cool facial tattoos of course. Hmmm? Facial tattoos...Darth Maul anyone? I mean, Come on J.J., did you even watch Star Trek Nemesis? It wasn't released that long ago. And yes, Klingon enemies have been overdone in the Star Trek films and shows too, but still I would have much rather preferred seeing Klingons make another appearance as the main villains in your movie again besides anything having to do with the Romulans so soon after Star Trek Nemesis.

And the total destruction of the planet Vulcan? Are you kidding me?! Not only was that just plain overkill, it reminded me a lot of the scene in Star Wars where the evil Grand Moff Tarkin blows up Princess Leia's home planet Alderaan.

And Leonard Nimoy gets to have a major role in the movie, but you can't even give a teensy weensy tiny cameo appearance to the main man himself, William Shatner?! Not cool.

Don't even get me started on the relationship angle between Spock and Uhura.

There's more, much, much more that I could bitch about concerning this movie, but I won't. Others before me have already done a good job of that. Besides all of the above, why do I still enjoy this movie so much? Because it's great escapist entertainment to waste a couple of hours of your life with. It's exciting, fun, and let's face it, it's better than no Star Trek movie at all...and it's still way better than Star Trek Nemesis!

I have read that they are currently working on a sequel to this movie, which I am really looking forward to seeing. It is scheduled to be released in theaters sometime next year in glorious anamorphic 3D. And all of the original cast are returning once again as well. I don't know about you but, personally, I can't wait to see it.

3471728,2,B001AVCFJM,"I know I'll be incinerated--photon torpedoed--by zealous Trekkies for this review.  But in the next life, my defense before The Creator will be similar to William Shatner's SNL parody: ""Sorry, it was just the evil Kirk (that made me say ""get a life!""). Can I ""live long(er) and prosper"" in eternal PARAMOUNT paradise now, please?

As a proud, lifelong Trekkie, I can truly say that I DON'T want to see the Star Trek series continually overplayed. It's had a rich, forever influential run. But it should retire like the top performer it is, instead of continuing on in excruciatingly bad form. Doing revival tours, playing lesser roles, playing backup--use whatever entertainment and sports metaphor you want that symbolizes not knowing when to quit.

This latest silver screen incarnation of the franchise, STAR TREK, may seem like a flashy, superior successor to the ships and crews before--or after, since it is technically a prequel. But kick the tires and look under the hood and you'll find the inner wear and tear from a Hollywood vehicle riding on re-treads and an almost empty tank. This TREK is styled specifically for the 20something set and is mostly CGI-starred. A tired-looking Leonard Nimoy does ceremonial color guard duty for the venerated ""Old Series"" crew, but little more.

Overall, STAR TREK simply lacks the signature morality play and clever allegory that elevated every TV series and almost every movie before.  Dizzying action and thunderous adventure destroy any semblance of subtle scripting.  Everything in this TREK is too literal, too tech.  The young Kirk and crew come across as afterthoughts--not even cogs or pieces in the bigger machine!

STAR TREK shows that it is time for this series (and its fleet of fair-weather thespians and trite tech) to retire--to be decommissioned to mothballs.  For in the words of that great extraterrestrial creator/philosopher Christ: ""What profiteth a man if he gain the world yet lose his soul?"" Or, in terms Trekkies can appreciate, Captain Kirk asked in Star Trek 5:  ""What does God need with a spaceship?""

Chris Pine, who plays Kirk, is very charismatic and fun to watch on screen. Zachary Quinto, Spock, is also very good in his role and the chemistry he has with Pine is very apparent.

Overall it is a very good movie, even for people who are not familiar with Star Trek. And the HD picture offered by Blu-Ray is absolutely brilliant.

3471738,5,B001AVCFJM,"This movie is just fun. It is a full-on action movie, but still contains light, funny moments and scenes where the characters show real emotion. I'm not sure how a die-hard Trekker would react to this film, but from what I do know about the original series they seemed to stay pretty true to what Star Trek is. Of course it has been modernized for today's audience, but I think that has only made it better. You do not have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this movie.

For people with kids: Being an action film there are fight sequences and people die, but it is not bloody or gruesome at all. There isn't any bad language, at least none that stood out. I would say it is similar to the movie Iron Man in terms of appropriateness.

The bonus features on this two-disc version are really good. I'm really into the bonus features, so this is important for me.  Lots of interviews and ""how did they do that"" type of stuff.",1326758400,3,919,4.2701149425287355
3471739,3,B001AVCFJM,"Just as ""Transformers"" (2007) took the characters and universe from a TV show and put them in a non-stop, big budget contemporary action movie, ""Star Trek"" (2009) does the same for the original ""Star Trek"" TV show. This Trek movie is good, and better than most of the other Trek movies, but it does not fully bring back the glory of Star Trek. Most of the original characters are back, played by new young actors who do a good job of capturing the original actors' body language and personalities. There's Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, Chekov, and a few more favorites. Leonard Nemoy also returns to play Spock in a few portions of the movie. But other than the characters, ships, uniforms, and sound effects, the movie is mostly a blur of action. I like action, but I miss the thoughtfulness of the original series. I miss the strange new worlds, the debates between Spock and McCoy, and the cleverness of Kirk. I was hoping for more of the spirit and feel of the original series. Also, I like my action slow enough that I can see it. The trend in Hollywood for several years has been action with lightning fast edits and a thousand and one moving objects on the screen. I was more thrilled by seeing one giant bolder slowly descending upon Indiana Jones in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". This Trek movie feels like a compromise between the old Star Trek and contemporary Hollywood action movies. I really enjoyed the moments that evoked the original TV show, and I liked some of the action, but to me this Trek does not have as much of the original show as I had hoped.

Picture and sound are great, as is to be expected of an HD-era produced movie made by people who care (enough) about ""Trek"" to do those elements right. The commentary is fine, sometimes, fun, occasionally informative, par for course. Disc 2 has bunches and bunches of extras...a decent enough selection.... people complain about how they are all listed out and not very organized, but I've never bought into the old ""too many buttons/notes"" complaint.

Of the 11 Trek movies to date (2011), I rank this newest one somewhere in the middle of them, better than some and not even close to the quality of the classically good movies.
Good actors and characters? Check. Visual and sound effects? Off the charts, sometimes hyper-kinetic and obsessed w/flaring. The ""new"" Enterprise? Errr, interesting exterior design, a bit wobbly/chunky, and a sweet bridge. Music score? Nice enough. Humor and inside jokes? Plentiful.

The plot? oh dear, the *plot*. Let's see: villain from the future of ""our"" timeline (the one that applies to most of the rest of the stories) goes back to change it. And he does -- all over the place, big-time, seemingly permanently. In other words, it seems that ""Trek"" will be living in and taking place in ""this"" timeline from now on. Wow. Usually, time-travel stories in Trek are cop-outs where our heroes fix everything to ""how it's supposed to go."" Not so here. In some ways, this is good; the character Spock prime (""our""/original Spock, Leonard Nimoy) has to stay ""here"" in this altered TL and live/deal w/t consequences of same. Refreshing. Of course, Nero's actions/strategies are questionable, and it would be too easy to just blame his (the writers'?) sloppiness on insanity, obsession, or revenge-mania.

And so, we're now living in a super-hyper, over-the-top version of ""Trek."" Wow -- this could go either way: calming down and settling into even better ""Trek"" stories in this brave new galaxy; or zanily zapping itself in the foot so fast and furiously that there's quickly nothing of quality left.

But, the special effects are great! If you're looking for explosions and showy lights, this is for you, just don't expect substance or quality of story, acting, or really anything but the effects.

This is not Star Trek in anything but name. I don't think it necessarily befouls the legacy of ""Trek"" but it may come close. I watched it once. Not again.

It makes me sad that this is what Star Trek has become. REAL Star Trek appears to be gone forever. Like everything else in mainstream Hollywood, this movie has nothing memorable. No substance.

3471756,3,B001AVCFJM,"12 REASONS WHY THE NEW STAR TREK MOVIE IS JUST LIKE STARS WARS

Nothing new is in Hollywood. The old script writers for Star Wars rewrote their old script and changed the characters into our familiar Star Trek heroes. They used some lines from the original tv series, hired new actors, and recycled the old Star Wars script, and expected Science Fiction fans not to notice the difference.

Cases in Point

1. Light Sabers- Sulu's got one.

2. Recycled Imperial Fleet uniforms, dye them red- Starfleet's got em.

3. Cantina brawls- Iowa's got em.

4. Blowing up a planet to torture someone who's watching- Got em.

5. Marooned on Ice planet Hoth- Kirk's got it.

6. Meeting an old Vulcan Master with pointed ears on an empty planet- Yoda? Nope-Kirk does it.

7. Huge planet destroying ship that can be destroyed by one little ship? Yep, done that.

8. Cute little Ewok alien with huge black eyes that can't speak Federation? Got one.

9. Police in land speeders? Got em.

10. Whiny droid?- name him McCoy3PO - Got one.

11. Jim, I am your father, (whoops, should have put my transmission in neutral, not forward.)

12. At the end of movie, everyone gets a huge promotion and a medal? Yup, done that, too.

Got some of your own? Add Em here and forward it along!

The Spock character is utterly unconvincing.

In fact, EVERY character is utterly unconvincing - with the notable exception of Kirk's.

I'm 48 and was a ""Trekkie"" before the term was ever coined.  As outlandish as some of those plots (and the subsequent movie plots were), they always flowed logically.  This movie just doesn't flow at all.  It is shallow, ridiculous and relies solely on ""wow!"" effects.

The engineering section of this Enterprise is more fitting of a 1960's Naval submarine.  Apparently this enterprise is steam powered.  (I'm a Naval engineer.)  There is ZERO homage paid to the original engineering set, which actually looked far more futuristic and convincing than this shameful mockery.

I HATE this movie and nearly stopped it on several occasions - purely out of disgust.

Buy the most updated version of the original series and forget this abomination of this mess, which is essentially a slap in the face to Roddenberry's original vision.

OR, if you want two hours of ""Trek"" movie entertainment, rent ""The Wrath of Kahn.""

1.  Digital copies must be redeemed within 2 years of release date for Paramount, Bueno Vista, and Disney movies.
2.  Losing the digital copy slip with the movie was no big deal - scanning the proof of purchase and a copy of my receipt and e-mailing it to customer support afforded me a second chance to redeem the digital copy.
3.  Digital copies are for EITHER iTunes or Windows Media Player.  I picked iTunes so I could copy it over to my iPod.
4.  A digital copy disk is WAY smaller than any Blu-ray disk.  A ripped Blu-Ray is 11-14GB and the digital copy easily fit on my 32GB iPod Touch (1.8GB long.)

Watching this movie on an iPod was WAY COOL and I recommend it anyone who hasn't tried a movie on an iPod should do it now.

My main gripe with this film is the degradation of the characters. The ""new"" Kirk is arrogant from start to finish, failing to develop any degree of maturity (and he can't hold his own in a fistfight). The ""new"" Spock is cool as ice, unless you dis his mom-at which point he becomes an unstoppable fighting machine. And the ""new"" Uhuru-I hate to say it, because it's so disappointing-is easy. She sleeps with Kirk, and maybe Spock. Hers is the most troubling character because of the example she sets. I have no idea how many adolescent black girls watched this film, but I can think of few worse role models for them than the new Uhuru. This character says ""You can excel in your field, wear mid-thigh miniskirts, sleep with the top brass, and still get respect."" If you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you on the recently black-holed Vulcan. Some might object ""It's just a story""; but the stories we tell ourselves and each other inexorably influence how we think and what we do. This Uhuru's impact is potentially catastrophic for girls who would imitate her.

Minor gripes: the ""lens flashes"" (or whatever they're called) were like the stars one sees after a knock to the head or a crack in the windshield, and twice as annoying as either. Was this a concession to internet junkies who can't follow a train of thought and require frequent prompts to refocus their attention? Did the plot have to use time travel, again? Are we really supposed to believe someone can keep a hoppity horse-sized blob of black hole-producing ""red matter"", pull out a drop of it at will, and shoot that drop into the same kind of cylinder used to move your documents from your car to the bank at the drive-thru teller without suffering any relativistic effects? And are we to believe that a rogue band of Romulan hard-rock miners can skip around the universe packing overwhelmingly greater firepower than a Federation starship? The sex scene with Kirk and Uhuru was unnecessary, as was the scattered profanity. Were sex and swearing included to score a PG-13 rating?

Recommendation: Do not buy or watch this film. Instead, buy and watch ""Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock"" and see the original characters pull for each other to rescue one of their own.

I've been a sci-fi fan all my life, but this movie doesn't just appeal to the nerdy at heart. A great storyline and plot, outstanding cast (I couldn't imagine any other actors playing these parts), killer special effects...these all serve to create a new vision of what Star Trek can be. It does take itself a little more seriously than the original show and films, but with obvious and appropriate nods to those that came before it. Also, I'm always pleased to see a digital copy included. If you're typically not a fan of the genre, don't dismiss this film without giving it a chance.

Forget for the moment that it has been a while since anyone has seen the characters involved wherein. Now, take a deep breath.

Strap in your TVs and BD players, 'cause they're in for a hell of a ride. Enjoy it.

Problematic plot aside, this new installment of Trek has a number of things going for it. The actors are beyond reproach in their respective rolls and to some extent, uncannily so. The visuals and sound fx are mind-blowing and not carbon copied from previously released and still seemingly successful ventures (TNG films, I'm looking at you). The mantra of this film was, as stated by the crew in the special features, ""How can we make it real... and cool?""

In the script component - the most heavily reviled aspect of the film - falls into the literary device of the dream story. In Trek, this means it deals with time travel. As hard as it may be, if you can turn off your Trek-Trivia stocked brain and let it all go into the wind (I know, it's hard to do), and watch the characters. They are the reason to watch this film.

Okay, and the visuals are sweet.

The special features are the best I have seen in this format, if only for the fact that they have a subtitle track. Being partially deaf, subtitled features are kind of a must for me.

At the end of the day, when we watch this version of Star Trek, we see the cast and crew boldly go where no sane Trek fan might go. And isn't that why we all love Trek in the first place?",1312243200,,1613,4.254901960784314
3471781,4,B001AVCFJM,"I may not be old enough to have enjoyed the very beginning of Star Trek when it first debuted, but thanks to my parents' love of the series I've seen more than my fair share of the older episodes.

It is very hard to do a ""reboot"" of such a loved series, but I believe that J.J. Abrams did a marvelous job. Abrams and his casting department were spot on with all of the main characters. Zachary Quinto was a fabulous Spock, from his looks down to the way he phrased his lines and his mannerisms. Chris Pine was able to portray the cocky Kirk while still making the audience love the character. Although these two actors were great, my favor was Simon Pegg as Scotty. He is such a brilliant comedic actor.

J.J. Abrams stuck to some of the original ideas/jokes that the main series had - like killing off a red shirt. The only thing in the movie that made me say ""Hey! No! that cannot happen!"" is when ****SPOILER ALERT*** future Spock met present day Spock.

I loved how Abrams developed the characters from when they were children. I think it gave the characters a depth that hadn't been explored thus far.

All in all I would definitely recommend buying this DVD. The special add-ons are a huge plus. I know that I've watched all of the specials at least twice, maybe three times.

I hope this review was helpful and that you end up enjoying this version of Star Trek as much as I have...and still am!!",1312070400,,1404,4.363984674329502
3471782,1,B001AVCFJM,J.J. Abrams took all of the humanity out of Star Trek and used the Star Trek likeness to profit off a generic sci-fi action movie.,1311033600,17,130,4.24
3471783,2,B001AVCFJM,"The plot makes little sense. The villains are weak. The Romulan ship looks cool.

This film draws as much on Babylon 5 and the Battlestar Galactica re-do than past versions of Star Trek.

It was a nice idea to have an older Spock end up in the thick of things in order to get the Kirk-Spock relationship back on track, but wouldn't it have been even more interesting had they got Shatner to do the same thing for the 'old' Kirk relative to the 'young' Spock?

The biggest weakness in this film, as the start of this review says, is the plot. It makes little sense that rogue Romulans would seek to act out revenge on Spock. The Federation was never responsible for the demise of the planet. If they found themselves accidentally going back in time, why not go back and work on the cause of the planet's destruction? Moreover, in confrontations with the young Enterprise crew, they are as goofy as John Travolta in Battlefield Earth.

For people who reject the post-mo pastiche that this film is, the last great manifestation of ST remains the last show, Star Trek Enterprise. That show was the best mounted ST series ever and, like the original show, commercially under-appreciated. Had the original series ST proved popular, the history of ST would be quite different.

3471784,3,B001AVCFJM,"Not half bad - not half bad at all, though I'd also argue that it's not quite as fantastic as some critics have made it seem.

I've been a fan of some incarnations of ""Trek"" for a long time, but if the last two films and the last two TV series proved anything, it was that the franchise badly needed fresh blood. This film essentially provides it, allowing younger actors to put a new spin on old characters. They don't disappoint. Quinto makes a solid Spock, Saldana and Pegg a fine Uhura and Scotty, while Urban and Pine excel as Bones and Kirk. The special effects are also top flight, and there is an intermittent but solid sense of humor here. The action also rarely flags.

And yet... Yes, there is an ""and yet."" The catch here is that none of this feels particularly fresh or original. Which makes a certain sense, I suppose - ""Star Trek"" long ago became a money making franchise for Paramount Pictures, which essentially prevents taking too many creative chances - but I'd be better able to deal with that if it didn't feel like the filmmakers here were constantly trying to pilfer ideas from earlier films in the series, like the revenge-driven ""Wrath of Khan."" If producers can next time retain the good humor but somehow ditch the rehashed concepts and create a few bold new ideas, I'll be happy to get in line for the inevitable sequel.",1310169600,,1348,4.520491803278689

The film exhibits smart dialogue, witty humor, engaging friendships, and explosive special effects.

3471798,5,B001AVCFJM,"I've read the reviews by people who don't think this movie is true to the original series as well as those reviews that think it is one of the best movies made of the saga.  I am solidly in the second camp.  I grew up watching all the original TV shows first run on TV, then watching them again several times in rerun.  They were great for a sci-fi buff but only a die hard Trekie would not admit that the TV show was at times campy and downright bad.  Remember in first run it was marginally successful for the network and only in reruns did it start to take on a cult status. This movie restarts the franchise in a very good way. My family and I have watched this movie five times and because of this movie, my kids got interested in the original TV shows.  This movie will bring the next generation of youth into watching the TV show where they may have never considered it otherwise.  For this reason alone, Trekies should respect what this movie accomplishes or someday there will be no more fans left alive.

The only problem with the Blu Ray version of this movie is the sound quality.  It was mastered poorly and seems more than just dumbed down to CD quality of 16bits and 48kHz.  That is all the good old CD does but CD's go back to the 1980's and the computing power and recording industry has come a long ways. Really good sound on Blu Ray can be done at the same standard as modern recording studios which is a much higher 24bits 176kHz digital signal.  For those of us who have a few thousand dollars invested in a quality surround sound system the difference in sound quality is dramatic; almost as big as the difference between low-def TV and high-def TV.

I'm not sure what was going on here with the mastering of the sound of this movie.  I have CD's that sound very good and the sound of this movie is not great.  It seem compresed. If it was that way with the original movie then they need to hire a better sound crew.  If it was goofed up in the process of converting to Blu Ray, then I hope someday they fix it. I did not take a star away for this because the movie itself is do darn good.",1305936000,3,2111,4.193069306930693
3471799,1,B001AVCFJM,"I've been a fervent Trekker since September, 1966 when I was 11 years old and perched in front of a black & white TV to watch the original premiere of Captain Kirk and the intrepid crew of the starship Enterprise. After high school I was editor of my college newspaper and got press passes to the Star Trek Conventions (yes, they called them that and not just the generic ""Sci-Fi Conventions"" of today) and I met and interviewed, Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner, De Kelley, Jimmy Doohan, George Takai, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, and of course Gene and Majel Roddenberry. In the years that followed I watched the movies then the Next Generation, DS9, Voyager and even winced at Enterprise and thought that in the 4th season they were just getting interesting when they cancelled it.

Then came Star Trek XI...

I have never seen a bigger abortion of Star Trek in my entire life and if Gene Roddenberry was still alive he would have lined everyone up who was involved in the project starting with J.J. Abrams and Stooge-slapped the whole gang if he had go around the sound stage twice.

This movie violated everything we know about Star Trek and did it like a huge bully. They turned Kirk into a boobie-honking drunk. They made Spock an emotional man-ho. Uhura became a slut. Scotty became a moron with midget for a sidekick. Sulu isn't Japanese anymore; he's Korean. Checkov is younger than Wesley Crusher when he wandered onto the bridge during the Farpoint Mission (Read that as: Put the safety pin in his diaper instead of ""take the helm, Mr. Chekov"").

Leonard Nimoy's part seems to be mostly to point out who is ""Kirk"", who is ""Scotty"" and what the heck is ""red matter""?

If this were really Star Trek then the Temporal Enforcement from the Federation's future would have had a heart attack at the destruction of Vulcan, two Spock's in the same time same time period and a 20 year-old Kirk as a Captain of the Enterprise and sent a temporal enforcement team back before any of this started and reversed the timeline to take out Nero (A Romulan with a tattoo on his head?!? What happened to the Three Stooges 'Moe' haircut?) to stop this before it ever got as far as it did.

I would have liked to think that the temporal agents would have sent an agent back to the 21st century to shoot J.J. Abrams because he killed Star Trek for me forever and turned it into a ""sex, drugs, and rock & roll"" moronic version of it's former self with no morality, no ethics, no storyline, no regard for the history of any of the former Star Trek's that came before it and to make matters worse Abrams made an appearance shortly after the 2009 film was released on Jay Leno's Tonight show and told the audience that he hated Star Trek and only did it for the money. He was booed off the stage.

I think it's past time to re-boot the re-boot and bring Star Trek back to the real fans. Let's take it to about 400 years past the time of Picard and see what Starfleet is like?

If bad films were a crime then Abrams would be guilty of a capital crime; the worst of all the Star Trek's ever made.",1305072000,46,3082,4.461811722912966
3471800,5,B001AVCFJM,"Sure, the new STAR TREK movie has an avalanche of special effects with a dizzying plot--BUT it also uses every opportunity to give a nod and a wink to fans of the original characters.  An excellent cast takes us back to see how the crew of the starship Enterprise became the characters we've known and loved so well.

Brash, swaggering James T. Kirk storms into command with all the heroic energy we remember from Shatner's service in the original series, right down to his taste in women all across the galaxy (the green ones, I mean).  Spock is brilliant but conflicted with his half-human existence.  Bones utters his fondly-remembered taglines.  A very smart take that wisely reviewed all the original material--something you don't see that often in Hollywood!

But the script's cleverness isn't limited to how it plays its inside jokes: the story not only risks the entire Federation, it risks the history we already thought we knew about these characters!  In a time travel thread in the story, a beloved actor from the original series makes his appearance to let the young Enterprise crew know that all bets are now off and they could change a destiny we already know.  That's clever!

I don't believe there's a dull moment in the entire running time.  This is carefully-crafted, meticulously-detailed film that will keep the casual viewer hopping--and the Trekkie deliriously satisfied.",1304899200,4,1394,4.995670995670996

There, I said it!!.

There's not much else I can say about the movie.  I loved begining to end, and I'm not a Treker by a long shot.  Never seen the original series and never saw any movie.  Actually I did saw a few episodes of Star Trek New Generation and it was cool. Also I saw that movie where Captain Piccard met Jim Kirk.  I didn't understood it but it was good.

Anyway, now that I stated the movie rocked my world, I can go to the meat of this collection:  THE EXTRAS!!.

I love the fact that, for the casting, Abrahams as for permission to the original actors.  He actually went with them and tell them ""I got this kid that'll play your character.  Can I do it?.  Are you agree?"".  That's respect!.  Also he consult the script with Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner.  THAT'S RESPECT!!!.

I can go on and on regarding the features, but what I love the most were the Deleted Scenes.  Until now I thought the scene where young Kirk throws the car to the cliff was pointless, however there as a built to all of that, and that build explain why he didn't raised as the cool captain he was in the original series but in a young brilliant punk.  I just loved that!.

Plus, where did Nero wait for 25 years!!?.  I wondered about that so much, and I got it in a sweet deleted scene!!.  How could Jim insert a virus on the tests for captain?.  MAN!!!!.  I love the deleted scenes!!!.

I got this Blue-Ray at a good price, and is one of my best purchases.  I can watch this movie a thousand times and enjoying it, but is the extras where I really got my money's worth.

Although I consider myself a Star Trek fan, having all episodes of the original series and Next Generation as well as all Star Trek motion pictures; I did not like the ""Enterprise"" TV show spin-off, which also played at a time before the original series.

I decided to give this movie a chance anyway (especially when I found out that even Leonard Nimoy (Mr. Spook) had a part in it, even though he swore years ago never to put on those ""pointed"" Vulcan ears ever again). Well, I was positively surprises about it and understand why Mr. Nimoy made an exception for this title after passing up the requests to take part in several of the previous Star Trek installments. Here is actually an example where the Prequel does NOT suck. The movie is also well done that non Star Trek fans can enjoy it without having a disadvantage of not being as familiar with the Star Trek universe as most fans. Star Trek knowledge is no prerequisite to ensure being well entertained.

They also did a great job with this Bluray release, because they packed it to the roof with tons of great bonus features, including extensive documentaries and interviews about the process of creating this movie from start to finish.",1300147200,,1399,4.569721115537849

I did not mind the alternate time line but it was so made just to please the hollywood crowd. I have to give it a low rating.

3471819,1,B001AVCFJM,"JJ Abrams is a good director of CGI type action movies.  JJ Abrams is also a Star Wars fan as opposed to a Star Trek fan.  Star Wars is futuristic fantasy.  Star Trek is harder sci-fi.  Hence JJ Abrams did not stay true to the Star Trek franchise & made a JJ Abrams movie with Star Trek characters.  No Respect for the Star Trek fan base.  No respect for the original body of work that Gene Rodenberry created.

Spock is sexually active and in a relationship with a former student- not a Vulcan thing.  The time line story isn't very good.  The screenplay has an air of being written by 3 people- a Star Wars fan, a Teletubbie script writer, and a Lifetime Network Man-hater Movie of the Week.

I lost respect for Leonard Nimoy on this one- the things actors will do for a paycheck.  I'd rather see Spock team up with Ron Jeremy for Skin Trek.  I get more enjoyment watching Priceline commercials with William Shatner; I find them more sincere.",1299628800,3,944,4.393063583815029
3471820,1,B001AVCFJM,"The writers and JJ Abrams take on the daunting task of rebooting the franchise, but in doing so, create a story devoid of any semblance of logic, rationale, or basic common sense.

As I am sure the writers wanted the freedom to create new storylines without being impaired and respecting stories already told, they wrote a story rittled with a plethora of contrived plot points and deus ex machinas in order to get their end result.  Because of this fact, the story seems to be written from end to beginning rather than vice versa.

So, how do they get to their desired end result?  Their way of thinking resembles a, ""If this happens then this must happen."" form of logic.  When you see the movie, the story is technically plausible.  The problem is the choices made in the movie to reach the ending is so contrived based off of zero common sense, dumb luck and irrational thinking, the story is completely implausible.  Watching the first 10 minutes of the movie, you'll notice at least 10 contrived plot points.

You would be better off watching the Original Series or Next Generation.  The characterazations are better and at least you can have some fun.  This movie was a lot of bark, but no bite.  It's a good blu-ray at the very least, hence the two stars.  It's the content that is poor.

EDIT:10/01/12
Rating change.  What use is a good blu-ray, if the content is crap.  Might as well just have left it blank.

Since the movie has been out for some time now and shown on cable, I can cite some specific examples:

SPOILERS:

""James Tiberius Kirk!"" the boy proclaims.  This is the introduction of our main protagonist?  Seriously?  Seriously?  I have never met a person that introduced himself using his middle name in all of my jeezny.  That straight out reeks of pretentiousness.  And this is the person we are supposed to root for?  Of course this douche bag attitude flows in with the Kobayashi Maru exercise.  A perfect setup to actually develop character and show Kirk's ability and prowess to command a ship and overcome a tough situation.  Instead, he sits there and does...nothing!

Now, let's make him 1st Officer.  Why?  No reason other than the fact that it has to be done or else the story won't work.  He's shouldn't be aboard the Enterprise, thus not even a regular crew member, but Pike makes him acting 1st Officer, pretty much on a whim.  Had this not been done, Kirk would not have the chance to become acting Captain later in the movie.  I guess the writers felt that being illogical here they could be illogical later as well.

""You expect me to talk?""
""No Mr. Bond.  I expect you to die!""

Sorry.  Wrong movie.  It just seemed like Nero was a generic Bond villian.  Bond villians, as sadistic as they are, like to bump off 007 in some gruesome yet unique way.  Thus, some elaborate death.  It gets him out of the way for them to focus on their main goal of world domination or whatever.  In this case, Nero wants Spock (Nimoy) to suffer.  So what does he do after he captures him?  He let's him go!  Seriously?  Seriously?  No maiming.  No physical torture.  No psychological torture.  Yeah, he destroy's Vulcan, be could still do that with Spock aboard the ship to continue toying with him.  But the story is ridgid and told from backwards to beginning, so he has to be freed to allow the deus ex machina to happen.

Deus Ex Machina...er, Trans-Warp Beaming!  Kirk needs to get back on the Enterprise, but how?  Hmm...Beaming!  But the Enterprise is at warp speed?  Beaming is faster!  But the coordinates are unknown?  Spock is smart.  He knows the formula!  Oh yeah!  That's brilliant!  Let's plug in the variables.  The rate is unknown, the time is unknown and the distance is unknown.  A forumla filled with variables can help them get to an unknown location moving at faster than the speed of light, at an unknown rate from an unknown starting point will get them there safe and sound?  Of course!  And it does!  What's the need for transport ship anymore when you can just hopscotch beam from solar system to solar system?",1298419200,5,4059,4.584615384615384
3471821,4,B001AVCFJM,"Abrams foolishly cut essential scenes despite Ryder's exquisite perfection as Spock's mom. As well, Abrams' fixation on the ""linguistic"" talents of Uhura is as lame and pathetic as the blotchy green-girls. Zoe Zaldana's talent deserves better than this. Every actor gave their all, and it shows. What a talented cast, from Cho to Cross, Pegg to Pine to Quinto to Ryder, Yelchin to Zaldana, and beyond to the child actors. Any faults in the film are due to the poor editing and problematic narrative flow. The cut footage (on Disk 2) should be restored and reintegrated. Currently, the story is clunky, from Kirk's childhood to Spock's. Why leave out the Klingon prison scene? Fewer shots of the boring creature chasing Kirk on the frozen planet, and inclusion of the cut scenes, would have better served the film. I'm not even going to go into the problems with Black Holes, Time Travel, and the rejection of Star Trek's time-line.

On top of chopped-out scenes, military protocol is immediately disposed with. The first caption is never called by his full name: Captain Robau. He is perfectly played by the great actor Faran Tahir, who exhibits leadership and maturity. Hopefully Tahir will get many opportunities to star in many more films; same goes for Chris Hemsworth, superlative as Kirk's father.

Of course, the music is amazing, worth more than 5 stars (had to get the soundtrack), and the closing credits are superbly done. This sensibility should have been extended throughout the film.

3471822,5,B001AVCFJM,"JJ Abrams' re-imagining of ""Star Trek"" is one of the most exciting films released in the action genre for some time.  He achieves a terrifically entertaining film through both holding close to the elements that made the original series so popular and taking it to the next level and allowing it to be sexier, glitzy, and best of all, the action and special effects are truly exhilarating.  The Bluray package is fabulous.

Abrams made the savvy choice to shoot ""Star Trek"" on film and not digitally, and the PQ is beautiful. The 1080p picture offers stellar contrast and exceptional fine detail from the pores on the actors' faces, the countless sources of brilliance on the sleek interior of the Enterprise to the tiniest bit of grime on the enemy ships.  CGI effects are dazzling to behold.  The soundtrack is mastered in Dolby TrueHD 5.1, my favorite codec.  While the soundtrack isn't as pounding as we might expect, the sound design favors a more realistic sound field and never exaggerating the effects.  The result is truly spectacular, and I'm not saying this is without bass, the LFE will shake your house when called for, and it excels at delivering the ambient effects whether its the murmur of voices in the Star Federation or the pinging and beeping of equipment on the bridge.  This is a reference grade disc and it makes a case as to why bluray is the format to go with.  Check it out on BD and if you haven't invested in a player, you will just to see films like Star Trek in all their lossless, 1080p glory.",1297555200,,1524,4.614814814814815

It does a very nice job of tying things together and setting the stage for some possible new movies that would tell about earlier adventures of the original cast of characters. The movie brings in one of the original characters, Spock, where the young version and the old version meet.

The casting was very successful in capturing some of the mannerisms of the original cast; I was particularly impressed with Karl Urban's portrayal of Bones, he did an outstanding job of capturing the accent and mannerisms used by DeForest Kelley in the original series.

An effort is made to explore the personal strengths and weaknesses of the characters that help the viewer, who is familiar with the series, to see how they came to be and accomplish what the later stories reveal.

The Blu-ray version offers the good video and audio that one expects from the medium and the story is filled with fast paced action that holds one's attention.

3471826,3,B001AVCFJM,"I will review this on two levels, scientific and characterization interplay.

In terms of scientific principles this movie would have garnered no stars from me. It was simply awful. One can suspend belief or suspend an improbable situation, if the story holds together and the suspension of belief is not really important to the enjoyment of the story. In the case of Star Trek, the suspension of belief was very irritating to say the least.

First of all, the red matter in the Romulan War Ship would have weighed mega tons, as in some large number with many, many zeros. How does any ship, no matter how powerful, carry such weight? How does one work with such material, if a drop of it alone would probably weight over a ton. This irritating point detracted significantly from the movie, I believe.

Next, and this was actually worse, the drilling tool and bits needed to send this red material into the planet to cause a black hole to form to consume the planet was utter nonsensical. The platform for the drilling laser would have to be on a tether that is over 100 miles long from the ship controlling it!!! How does anything either on this earth or any earth control such a platform? Recall the BP mess in 2010. The drilling platform was a mere 1 mile above the drilling site itself, and look what happened. The platform had problems controlling the seals over the drill site, thus, the drill site leaked gas back into the drilling system, and an explosion resulted that led to many, many gallons of oil going into the gulf. The technical issues with such a long drilling system are enormous and complicated no matter what year it is. Although the issues of maintaining a seal is not present or important, what is hard to envision is that we now have 100 miles from ship to platform for the drilling system. Not 1 mile, 100 miles! Imagine the steel links to hold the platform. How much does it weigh stowed? Many tons to be sure. How does one control, even for a moment the operation of this complicated system, balancing the enormous weights, and all the technically difficult issues that would be part and parcel for this drilling system? How??? What utter nonsense. This part of the story was very, very irritating to me. Of all the story plots to deliver a material to destroy a planet, we now have red matter, precursor to a black hole, and a drilling platform/system that is over 100 miles long!!!! Complete and utter nonsense. The ship would have to carry the equivalent weight of a minor star to complete its tasks. Is this logical? Or is this irritating?

Characterization.
This saved the movie for me. I thought the characters blended well and the choices for Bones, Scotty, Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, even Cpt Kirk and Spock were all well done. However, I thought the characterization of Cpt Kirk was done a bit too extravantly, and how in blazes does he become Captain, yes Captain, on his very first voyage is rather stretching things too, too much. At first, Spock was rather irritating in his rather narrow view of humans. I did not like him at first, but as the story progressed I changed my mind and felt more at ease with him. Yet, I did not get the feeling from this story that I particularly liked him per se. It was the knowledge and all the prior stories of Spock and Kirk that I remembered that made the transition to this new team doable. You just knew, had to know that the relationship of the two was about to start and then go on to develop into the special one we all familiar with.

I thoroughly enjoyed Bones and Chekov and Sulu. They were interesting, funny to say the least. I also like Scotty a lot. These characters brought back memories of the ones we are all familiar with, and their humanity and interplay were believable and enjoyable to me. I like them and hope to see them together in a more plausable Star Trek story in the future. It was this feeling from seeing these new characters taking the place of the ones we are familiar with and doing it in a consistent, fresh way that made this movie a 3 star one and not zero stars.

I recommend buying this movie just for the characterization, not for the story or plot. Those issues stunk up the movie. Yes there is a lot of bang, bang shoot em up stuff for those who enjoy the action most, but this is a minor role used to entertain the need for action in all of us sitting on our couches. This is ""eye candy"" so to speak, forget the scientific gaps in logic for a moment. The rest of the movie is ""candy for the heart"". For all of us who love the characters of the original Star Trek we know so very well.

3471827,4,B001AVCFJM,"J.J. Abrams' reboot of Star Trek was a critical and commercial success, but it did get some bad reviews. One Star Trek fan claimed that the 2009 reboot was ""too loud"" and ""Chris Pine was an irritating James Kirk"". There's also plot holes and Nero's motivation for killing people was weak. A lot of people die in this Star Trek movie, but most of the killing is done by bad guys. I've been a big Star Trek fan since I was a teenager. I grew disillusioned when Star Trek Nemesis(2002) failed commercially and critically and TV's Star Trek Enterprise(2001-2004) was cancelled! For a few years, the original Star Trek(1966-1969) survived in TV reruns with enhanced CGI VFX. I thought Star Trek was dead and nothing but a memory. Star Trek(2009) does justice to the original Star Trek and it is palatable to non-Trekkers. The film has enough redeeming values, inspired moments, and production value to save it. I was afraid that it would a downbeat, lifeless, train wreck...just like the Battlestar Galactica remake for the SyFy Channel!
 The script for the film was written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. These two also wrote scripts for the Transformers movies. Chris Pine takes the William Shatner role of James Kirk and makes it his own. Pine's mother, actress Gwynne Gilford, was in the 1972 horror-comedy Beware! The Blob. Zachary Quinto was good as a young version of Spock and Karl Urban gives a sincere performance as Dr. McCoy. This film is a prequel, yet it's packed with references to past Star Trek adventures. The scene where Spock is picked on by Vulcan boys is a reference to Filmmation's Star Trek cartoon(1973-1974). Michael Giacchino(Ratatouille, Speed Racer) wrote a solid, epic, sweeping, loud music score.  Star Trek(2009) was like a large cake that was successfully baked and neatly decorated.

3471828,1,B001AVCFJM,"A little background: I'm not a trekkie or a trekker, but I have enjoyed the franchise on a casual basis in most of its incarnations (Voyager aside).

My expectations going into this film were two-fold: 1. as a ""Star Trek"" movie I expected it to fail miserably, but 2. as a generic action movie I expected it to pretty good. In other words, I was willing to put aside everything I knew about Star Trek and just ""enjoy the ride"". I was right on the first count and painfully wrong on the second count.

I'm all for suspension of disbelief, but this film pushes the limits on every count. Not only must you suspend any knowledge you have of the Star Trek universe, but also you must suspend any knowledge you have of the world and all the rules of logic. Assuming that you're able to do that, you're rewarded with: a generic and utterly forgettable action film.

I'm not going to dwell on ""Trek lore"" inconsistencies. I will, however, point out a few complete and total insults to logic.

WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW

--It seems that in J.J. Abrams' version of Star Trek, there is no such thing as a chain of command. In the opening sequence, George Kirk  (Jim's father) is put in command of a starship. George, we later learn, was merely a lieutenant at the time. That would suggest that aside from the captain, nobody else on board held the rank of lieutenant commander or commander. Ok, unlikely, but I'll buy it. Flash forward to the Enterprise. Spock is relieved of command and command of the ship passes to the next highest ranking officer, right? Not so much. Inexplicably passing over every officer on board, James T. Kirk, a cadet on academic suspension, is elevated to command without so much as a peep from a single officer on board outranking him.

--In J.J. Abrams' version of Star Trek, black holes let you travel through time. Sure, why not? Look, I realize that any time travel is fanciful, but I at least prefer not to be insulted. Invent some sort of plot device, explain it quickly and be on your way. I'm willing to suspend disbelief, it's much harder when you insult me in the process.

--Speaking of plot devices: red matter. Red matter can create black holes. What is red matter? Drektath's dictionary defines it as: a convenient plot device with no exposition offered. Where does it come from? Multiple theories abound, among them: it's a byproduct of J.J. Abrams' waste system. Again, I'm willing to suspend disbelief, make up some techno-babble for crying out loud.

--Starfleet apparently has no problems in dealing with mutinous crew members. In J.J. Abrams' world, they just stick them in an escape pod and jettison them into space. A shame they couldn't afford a brig in Abrams' world, I suppose.

Bottom line: groan-worthy attempts at humor, lots of lens flares, a forgettable and uninspired plot, and a series of forgettable space action sequences. Abrams stated that he was more interested in making a Star Wars movie than a Star Trek movie...shame he decided to emulate the Star Wars prequels rather than any of the good films.",1296864000,11,3054,4.691588785046729

3471832,4,B001AVCFJM,"...but here's my 2.

This is a Star Trek reboot. That will be obvious to any fan of the original series as the inconsistencies with that series keep piling up. Obviously the producers wanted to start with a clean sheet of paper and not be bound as if in a straightjacket by the '60s original. To their credit the producers do this in a very well conceived way which leaves the original intact.

The story was top notch, easily the best Star Trek movie since ""Wrath of Khan"" in my opinion. Gripping story, lots of action, touches of humor, drama, etc abound. I was relieved that the bane of previous Trek films - lines and occasionally entire scenes aimed at hard core trekkies - are either not present or suitably subtle here.

The casting was great also. I thought Zachary Quinto was especially good. Recasting such well known and much loved characters is always a big risk. Here it was pulled off brilliantly. Interesting is the reimagining of Kirk as a rebel without a cause instead of the ""serious, positively grim"" cadet.

There was one thing that annoyed me and led me to deduct a full star. Kirk gets to be a Captain waaay too quickly. It is just not believable that anyone would be commanding a major warship so quickly. No second class Midshipman would be given command of a nuclear aircraft carrier no matter how brilliantly or bravely he performed. Star Trek in all its incarnations has never quite grasped the essentials of military protocols but this seems to be way over the top. I understand the producers wanted Kirk in the Captain's chair as quickly as possible - this is just a clumsy way to get there.

Highly recommended to Star Trek fans. If your not a Trek fan this is a good place to jump on as the baggage of previous movies and series has been jettisoned.",1295481600,2,1780,4.5327102803738315
3471833,5,B001AVCFJM,"I was skeptical as Haedes when it came out, and to be honest, I don't watch Heroes and all that so I didn't know who Zachary Quinto was.  I loved how Kirk was played by Chris Pine (and by the young boy who totalled the car in the beginning)! I think it totally rocked to see some futuristic kid driving like a maniac to the Beastie Boys!  Then of course you have the interaction with Spock/Kirk at the academy which Pine and Quinto did an excellent job on! That barfight totally cracked me up also.

I will admit I was highly upset that Ben Cross didn't get more good reviews and better recognition for his portrayal of Sarek in the film and I hope he gets to reprise the role! Like the late Mark Leonard, he was simply excellent!  His interaction with both young Spock and Quinto's character was both moving and convincing.  I say that because even though Vulcans do NOT show emotion, Sarek explains that their emotions run even more deeply than humans and that is why they must control them.  When Spock unleashes his fury on Kirk, it is Sarek who gets him to stop.  Even with a face showing no emotion, it is obvious that the Sarek character had a deep love for his son and for the mother of his child, which is revealed later. There are some things that can be read between the lines and I simply love how Cross pulled this off with a straight face and calm voice no matter what was going on.

Like Ben Cross, another actor deserves a heck of a lot more recognition here and that was Bruce Greenwood! He totally rocked too! You didn't know much about Pike from the original series because there was a guy in a chair with no speaking role or anything so I am grateful that Abrams gave this character dignity and depth! It also gives the audience insight into the relationship between a young James Kirk, and the man he looked up to with the utmost respect. I will watch this movie again, I assure you! I guess I judge actors by an older standard, but this cast far exceeded that standard--especially Pine, Quinto, Cross and Greenwood and I would love to see all four re-cast! I'll go to the theater for that--but if they don't use ALL FOUR--I'll wait for the bloody dvd and I DO mean it!

Then you have the problem with the bad guy (Eric Bana's ""Nemo"")...Oh yeah...The one trying to destroy Spock--past and present form.  In the present Leonard Nimoy reprises his role as an older Spock, which was so cool!  However Eric Bana was the total bad a** bomb!  I hope he gets more bad guy roles out of this because he was simply awesome.  I wonder how many of these older actors realize though that being labelled bad a** is a very high compliment?  I've watched a lot of Ben Cross's work and that actor is also BAD A** in many roles!  God I hope he gets more work over here!",1295222400,3,2772,4.324324324324325
3471834,5,B001AVCFJM,"After watching this DVD, I realized again why I liked it so much after seeing it in the theater.  I am a Trekkie, and this movie is definitely for fans.  It's like watching ""Star Trek Babies;"" each character has his or her introduction and one delights in comparing it to the characters portrayed in the series and the movies.  James T. Kirk comes from tragic and heroic origins but lives a reckless life prior to enrolling at Starfleet.  Spock is singled out for being half-human and half-Vulcan from childhood.  Other characters are presented in sympathetic, tongue-in-cheek fashion.  The ensuing adventure, however improbable, sets the stage for the stormy forming of the U.S.S. Enterprise's top brass.

The visual effects are all the more effective because the producers of the film went out of their way to incorporate *photography* over CG, where possible.  This produces a very radiant and breathless cinematography.  It is not for no reason that this movie won an Oscar for Best Make-Up over ""Avatar""; it uses real make-up on real actors and actresses!

3471835,5,B001AVCFJM,"From the impressive opening sequence you suspect that `Star Trek' will be something special and by the time the end credits have started to roll you will know it for a certainty. As far as sci-fi films go this is outstanding. You get a great storyline, amazing space scenes and CGI and good acting from all involved. This film is a prequel to all the Star trek films that already exist and this introduces us to all of the crew we know and love. It even shows how some of them grew up and how they met one another. The casting is excellent, especially the actor who plays Spock, and there is even a cameo from Leonard Nimoy. This shows how Kirk started off as an impetuous and even arrogant cadet and gives us an insight into his character that is evident in later films. This is a good film in it's own right and adds to the series exceptionally well. There are plenty of classic lines and in-jokes for existing trekkie fans and action and adventure for those new to the franchise. This is a top sci-fi adventure and an engaging film and is well worth checking out at some point. P.S. the space scenes on Blu-Ray are especially impressive if you get the chance to view this in that format.

3471836,5,B001AVCFJM,"I have been a Star Trek fan most of my life. I can honestly say this movie was probably one of the best (If not the best) Treks I've ever seen! I can't wait for the DVD to come out. What's more I can't wait for the sequel! and it looks very likely that their will be a sequel. And with a movie this good, you can't expect anything other than the huge success it's enjoying!

The things that made it great where: The story was fantastic, people who weren't already fans of Trek could really get into it, it wasn't hard to understand, but it was still very intelligent. The music was superb! it gave it a very grand and exciting feeling! The effects where top of the line, and just plain brilliant! The humor gave it a more personal quality, so it didn't feel as stiff as it could have been. And the acting was top-notch. They really hit the nail on the head by picking the unknown Chris Pine to play James Kirk. Not only does he look like William Shatner did when he first started playing Kirk, but his acting was exceptional. And there was Zachary Quinto, he did the part of Spock so much justice, it's hard to see anyone else play him. And there was the surprise appearance of Leonard Nimoy (the original Spock) playing Older Spock. He really tied the story together. And not to forget, there was also the wonderful performances of Zoe Saldana, Anton Yelchin, John Cho, Karl Urban, and Eric Bana. Also the children that played Kid Kirk (Jimmy Bennett) and Kid Spock (Jacob Kogan) gave masterful performances for the short background story parts they where tasked with.

So that is why I say this movie was a triumph in every way! Not just as a Star Trek film but as any film! I give this movie a 10 out if 10! If they'd let me I'd give it a 20 out of 10!!!",1295136000,,1757,4.25748502994012

3471845,5,B001AVCFJM,"J.J. Abrams has directed a beautiful motion picture called Star Trek. He and his writers decided to re-boot the story and take us back to Kirk and Spock; before the original series.

When a Romulan miner goes through a wormhole, he goes back through time to destroy a planet (I won't spoil too much). Because of this change in history, Jim Kirk's father is killed before he's supposed to and we're given an alternate history.

Many Star Trek fans are not happy with this new spin, but the film's creators wanted their own take on the franchise and this was how they could do it.

Chris Pine plays James T. Kirk. Having never heard of this guy before, I was a little worried. But fear not. Pine does a fantastic job at the brashness of Kirk. He will make a fine starship captain. Except, it seemed as if he was getting beat up all through film.

Zachary Quinto plays Spock. We get to see what it was like for him to grow up on Vulcan and being teased for being half-human. He is the one who designed a training exercise that Kirk cheats at to win. They aren't the best of friends we've known them to be at the beginning of this film. Once again, Quinto does a nice job at Spock and making it some of his own.

Eric Bana is the villain, Nero. We don't get much of his story or see much of him. But we was terrific as the bad guy.

Karl Urban plays Dr. McCoy (Bones) and you believe him as soon as you meet him. The voice and his paranoia is perfect. Great job by Urban.

Finally, Simon Pegg plays Scotty. He's a funny guy and I was surprised at how his character joined the Enterprise family. I didn't really care for his small assistant as if Pegg needs someone to help him with comedy.

Star Trek is a great summer ride. It's fun and funny. Lots of action and crisp looking shots. If you aren't a Trek fan, you should still give this re-boot a try. You'll probably end up enjoying it.",1294099200,,1884,4.22841225626741

I'm a big fan of JJ Abrams; from LOST to Cloverfield, I think he's one of the best directors (along with Chris Nolan - the new Batmans and Inception) we have right now and has a very bright future.

The cast is great - having ""unknowns""/smaller actors play Capt Kirk and Spock I thought was a great idea, and the side characters were great and gave great comic relief.

3471851,3,B001AVCFJM,"Unfortunately the negatives are numerous.

This is basically a redo of WRATH OF KHAN except the target is now Spock instead of Kirk, but we even have the same planet-destroying technology.

The gag reel is more silly than funny.

There are no deleted scenes, always a big minus on a DVD.

Overall the film is a good addition to the TOS universe however if you're looking for a classic, this isn't it.

When it comes to the characterizations, the actors who play McCoy and Scotty are often over-the-top, mainly because of forced dialogue that is cliche for the characters from the original series and dropped in here deliberately so the audience is banged over the head with it.  Also there is often an unnatural quality to their voices because of the tone they are forced into, as if bad stage actors doing impersonations.  However you can be sure they are the comic element to the film, and they are funny, and fortunately this McCoy works nicely with our new Kirk.

The character of Uhura is definitely the worst realized, probably because most writers and directors in Hollywood don't know what to do with a female in a film unless making her an object of desire.  So first it is Kirk who meets her, wants her but gets nowhere, then she later becomes involved with Spock.  Hopefully there will be something more useful for this crewman to do in the next film.  When you compare how she only has a moment to display her expertise in her job, it is very sad when you realize for Sulu and Chekov it is all about their training.  She is so clearly the token female in this film.

The best thing in the film is Chris Pine (with the JFK hairdo) as Kirk, and he and the new Spock are clearly the best things about this film.  They honor the original actors in their portrayals without stomping on the characterizations, having enough physical resemblance to Shatner and Nimoy they easily suggest younger versions.  Especially Pine as Kirk has the right touch of energy, confidence, brashness and charm in his portrayal, however the Spock here is (as mentioned above) a bit out of whack, as if a new Vulcan character were dropped into the mix.  You can see this Kirk is a born leader, no matter what age he is.  The only drawback is the script has him constantly - and comically - on the make with females, which brings to mind other psychological implications in the aspect of ""doth protest too much.""

3471854,3,B001AVCFJM,"Nerd diving in to the review space here...

This movie was good as a standalone, but I agree with the notion that it lacked the depth of the Original Series, and Generation, for that matter.

I had two major problems with this movie: one, Kirk gets promoted after saving Earth, from Cadet to. . . captain?

Uhm, lolwut? Speaking as ex-military spouse, that is not even the least bit believable. Promotions work on a scale, I don't care if someone does save the planet. For that matter, a medal is more realistic then a leap that quick.

Second major problem I had: The Characters. Kirk, I could buy as being all over the place when he was a teen. Fine, cool, good vibe, whutev. McCoy? Oh lord. I have to give hands down to Karl Urban. I was immensely impressed with his overly emotional fire, very in line with the original portrayal of our beloved doctor. Who I had a problem with? Spock.

Now, this is not a come-down on Quinto, who had the look and the presence of personality to pull of Spock. No, this one, I blame on the writers, who eliminated nearly all of the original backstory for Spock-who clearly favored his Vulcan heritage early on in the series (mostly due to pressure from Sarek, kthnx) in favor of hooking him up with a nice pair of legs. In TOS, it took spores or a virus to make Spock crack, and so many women (said a Mr. Asimov, please see "" I am Spock"") took a fangirly crazy sort of glee in imagining different ways of busting that shell open. A large portion of Spocks fans way back when were female-essentially, it was because he was virtually untouchable. This movie? Totally wiped all of that off the board. His past, his struggles to find a balance between human and vulcan...all of it. Gone. Poof. Just like that. And it was awful.

I gave this movie a three, for those facts alone. Spock <3 Uhura? Nowai.

Also, no one can EVER replace Mark Lenard as Sarek, sorry. That man had a presence that no one else can match for that role, gods rest his soul.

3471860,4,B001AVCFJM,"I agree this ""Star Trek"" is very entertaining eye candy that relies to much on CGI effects.  However, it was fun and entertaining.

I agree with Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen"" (Chicago, IL) and all his technology praise.  (I'm a Trekkie and not a Teckkie and could never have done the great job he did describing its great technological advances.)  They are right on.

I agree with L P ""lilip"" (Los Angeles)'s "" . . .  Star Trek: The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, and Voyager are all rendered invalid, because a couple of writers . . .""

This movie has no relation with the Star Trek universe at all but to rip off the name for ticket and DVD sells.

But I do have and easy fix for future sequels to this movie to bring it in line.

First, J.J. Abrams' needs to sit down and watch all 600+ episodes of the 4 series and all the previous movies to wake-up to the critical importance of Vulcan and that you can't wipe it out of existence and still have a Star Trek storyline.

Second, fire his two writers and never use them again.

How do you undo the damage Mr. Abrams has done?  Easy, Hollywood's done it before!  Do a ""DALLAS"".  In the opening scene of the next movie have Kirk come to on the floor of the bar and say, ""WOW, what I dream I just had.""  And try again.

This movie is like two earlier ones Hollywood put out I can mention as examples:  James Cameron's ""Titanic"" and Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor"".  These two movies had nothing to do with either the Titanic or Pearl Harbor.  They were just backdrops to love stories.

As, I have told other's, ""You want to see a great movie about the Titanic, watch ""A Night to Remember"", want to see a great movie about Pearl Harbor, watch ""Tora, Tora, Tora"".""  But those two by Cameron and Bay are just great love story movies with famous backdrops, and with little accuracy to those backdrops.

The same holds true with this movie.  If you're a ""Trekkie"" like me, enjoy the film for the eye candy it is.  Just remember, it is just a good bang-bang shoot'em up using the Star Trek universe as a backdrop.  Watch the earlier Star Trek movies and series for true Star Trek.

Want Hollywood to correct itself.  Boycott any future ones by Abrams.  Hitting Hollywood in the pocketbook ALWAYS gets their attention!

3471863,1,B001AVCFJM,"I am going to spare everyone a summary of the plot and cut to the chase: while this movie was entertaining with a handsome cast and flashy scenes, it was not Star Trek.. If you had named it, let's say ""Space Academy - the Early Years"" it would be pretty ok but naming it Star Trek is sort of like throwing a bucket of acrylic paint at the Mona Lisa and calling it art. If you don't know much about Star Trek and don't care too much about internal consistency in a movie in general, character development, plausibility or a plot for that matter, then this is the movie for you. As a matter of fact I believe that one of the reasons this movie has proven to be very popular among non-Star Trek fans is because it is not Star Trek!! It is a glossy reboot of the original with little substance beneath its action-packed surface and pretty faces, resembling more an MTV video. Here are some of the more serious issues with this movie:

+ All of the ""acting"" is 'over the top' and everyone is exaggerated, to the point of clownish buffonery. Kirk (or Chris Pine really) appears to have ADD or something and he is arrogant, cocky, erratic, tactless and obnoxious. I was so annoyed early on with him already that I actually enjoyed watching him being beaten up at the bar. A cutsey boy cadet who walks on a bridge and says, ""I'm in charge"". You have got to be kidding me. Not only that but an Admiral placing him as second in command of a ship? Wow.

+ Lightning fast cuts from one scene to another like an MTV video and really poor plot where all the Enterprise crew just happen to find themselves together even though their entire respective pasts have been inexorably changed? Ridiculous.

+ The back stories behind how the original characters met was insulting and every tagline from the original series was used most inappropriately, as if they had a list of lines required to be used so that they could show at least some resemblance to the original show. Instead of spending time on developing each character, such as Spock's inner struggle and Kirk fighting his demons and finally turning from a repeat offender to a serious and devoted Starfleet officer, they forwarded (literally) all that to focus more on CGI effects and visuals.

+ Speaking of visuals: The interior of the Enterprise looks like a Bloomingdale's make-up counter. How ridiculous and untrue to even an altered timeline was that? The interior of ships in the 24th century didn't look this chic.

+ The villain was uninspired and dumb. Seriously. I mean here you got this Romulan (who doesn't even remotely look Romulan by the way and has super strength) who saw his entire planet be destroyed by a ""galaxy threatening supernova"" (!). Then, he is flung 200 years into the past, with a tub of super future material and nothing to do. Now, what would you do in this situation? If it were me, I might, oh, I don't know, WARN MY CIVILIZATION. Given 200 years of lead time, an evacuation would not be all that difficult. OK, let's say I'm a little bit crazy. What might I do then? Nero says he wants to create a world in which Romulus exists without the Federation. What might be the best way of achieving this? I might, oh, I don't know, GO TO ROMULUS, give them all this fantastic future technology, and become emperor of a civilization 200 years in advance of everyone else out there. What does Nero actually do? He goes it alone. Because, you know, shut up, that's why. He then decides to obliterate _an entire planet_ based on said faulty intelligence and wait 25 freaking years for Spock to show up so he can exact revenge. He then also just so happens to maroon Spock on a planet that just so happens to have a Starfleet base on it where he can oh so conveniently run into the new Kirk and inform him that it just so happens that his and new Spock's destiny is to be friends at all costs apparently. How so very inconvenient. Yup, that's the villain. There is no passion, no substance, no character, apparently also no intelligence behind his person and motive other than what was written in the script for him to act like.

+ The product placement was so obvious. Way to promote an enlightened future in which all of human kinds' ills coming from money and economic deprivation have been eradicated - by having something like 20 millions worth of product placement in there.

+ Bones: The reason for why McCoy says he is called ""bones"" was totally pulled out of the writers' butts in this movie. The expression comes from civil war time doctors who had to use saws to amputate legs. The term ""bones"" (which Kirk called McCoy in The Original Series) comes from that. In this stupid movie McCoy says ""in a divorce my wife got everything and left me dry to my BONES"" and they use that to explain why Kirk calls him ""bones"". Ridiculous.

+ If this is a future in which money has been eradicated (and lawyers executed), how can McCoy _lose_ everything he has in a divorce and be left ""dry to his bones""?

+ The Star Trek series, especially Star Trek: The Next Generation, brought in top scientific minds to advise about what is and is not science and how they can take an idea and transform it such that, even though it is science-fiction, it is still scientifically consistent and coherent.  This movie spent a lot of time on special effects, flashy scenes and catchy one-liners but very little on rationalizing the science and incorporating it intelligently into the movie to create consistency. They dumbed the whole premise down to a grade school level and some of the things they are trying to pass as ""science"" would make the head of any Star Trek regular writer spin in disbelief. That's what happens though when you set out to deliver bread and circuses to the masses. Ships flying through Black Holes and coming out the other side intact? Enterprise escapes the black hole by blowing up the warp core inside of it? Ski diving onto a platform FROM SPACE? A mining ship annihilating an entire planet?

+ The writers seemed to be thinking  that simply because this is science fiction, any kind of implausible garbage they come up with goes. Sci-fi doesnt equal magic though and the one thing Star Trek didn't rely on was magic bullets to explain phenomena and anomalies etc. In this movie, the most absurd stuff goes down and we are to believe it makes sense because the genre is sci-fi and the writers say so? How stupid do they actually think people are?

+ This movie is not true to Star Trek in even a rudimentary way. It is not intelligent, or thought provoking. It is not about space exploration and asking the tough questions, there is no ttempt at science, philosophy. Nothing. This is Star Trek the way only a product of the over-stimulated times we live in could make it. Cheeky, sexy, and dumb.

+ Speaking of inconsistency: Spock's and Kirk's relationship in this movie is adversarial from the start and all they do is argue and fight and at some point Spock is juts about to strangle Kirk. Yet in the end, somehow out of the blue, they become good friends, because the old Spock says they were in another life. That is completely inconsistent with how the characters have behaved and been portrayed throughout the movie as you cannot just push the button and say ""hey, I am good friends with you now"". That is just bad writing folks. If you cant even get something like character consistency within a plot right, you are a lousy writer. How Orci and Kurtzman are still with a job and get to write the sequels is truly beyond me.

+ Kirk's  promotion: how does a cadet go from being suspended for cheating to becoming the captain of one of Starfleet's most prestigious spaceships less than a week later? Yes he saved Earth, but come on. That scene where he is decorated as the second coming of Zefram Cochrane, by the same man who just a few days ago held the hearing on his cheating ways, was ridiculous. A cadet getting full command of a flagship while his instructor, in whose class he cheated and was caught, gets to serve under him as second in command? Laughable...if I was Spock, Vulcan stoicism or not, I would have taken the matter to Starfleet command.

+ McCoy's character played by Karl Urban seemed too old and sophisticated to be a Starfleet cadet, especially among this group of immature rascals. He seemed to be the only adult amidst this circus where a child (Kirk) was getting to play captain or something. Even though Urban did a fantastic job playing McCoy, they should have cast him either next to a more mature cast of Kirks and Spocks or cast him as an admiral or something. He really was the only one who wasn't out of his mind.

+ More than 600 episodes from Star Trek: The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, and Voyager are all rendered invalid, because a couple of writers, who I must mention  have never even written a Star Trek episode before, had so little creative talent that their best idea was Well, why don't we just change the whole time-line, then we don't have to worry about established details and accurate characterizations. I am sure it's a good way for the writers and producers to turn a fast buck but Star Trek is part of pop culture. The continuity so lovingly and painstakingly preserved by all the movies, TV series and novels subsequent to the The Original Series has been destroyed with this movie. You don't have to be a Trek geek to find that outrageous.

+ It is sad to know that the last time I, or anyone of us, will probably EVER see Leonard Nimoy do the Vulcan salute is in this nasty piece of tourist trinket!

Bottom line: Somehow it all felt very untrue to the essence of Star Trek. It was too Hollywood and glammy and very little story and depth. If you like bling and lots of mind-less action and nail-biting sequences and good looking, hollow characters having music-video length ""dialogs"" with each other while flashing their handsomeness in front of smooth, shiny surfaces and catchy shots,  then this is the movie for you. But if you expect substance, drama, depth, coherence and plausibility, then you are in the wrong place. They had a lot of potential with this one but they just missed it. Since they were going to make sequels, they should have spent more time truly developing the characters and their relationships with one another and just the beginnings of their journey rather than rushing through that part and getting into some mind-less, pointless, absurd plot involving an insane yet at the same time comical Frankenstein's Romulan monster. They just missed all that and it felt rushed. The creative angle was missing and you could literally see dollar signs hanging from every cgi shot. Open up a spot for Jackie Chan, 20 ninjas and Lindsey Lohan in the sequel and the abomination will be complete.",1290211200,186,10779,4.568322981366459

And Spock, it is neither fair, nor logical, I might add, to deny a star cadet of a deserving position and affect the trajectory of her StarFleet career simply to avoid the appearance of favoritism on your part.

having just come up for air after the nastiest midterm election in memory during a crappy & difficult span of time where corporations seem poised to come out from behind the curtain, do away the the middleman expense of political puppetry and start governing we the people directly.....this film brought me back from the brink.

folks, i know this is just a film. but it carries a whalloping dose of cure for the broken spirit.

technically, yes, yes, yes, good stuff, great stuff, refer to the techno-centric reviews for that angle.  what i'm takling about here is GOOD story telling.  excellent casting ( i very much appreciate each players' 'study' of the original characters) the WOW special teams' work, FAB directing and bang on- where did YOU come from? writing!!!! no small trick to reinvigorate an established well loved mythology with such grace and apparent affection for the subject matter.

i am 51 have have loved our captain kirk, our first mate spock, bones, you know...the WHOLE gang(next generation et al).  have seen all the movies.  loved them, some more than others....THIS ONE IS THE BEST!!!  back to the beginning! so cool to learn the back  stories of how the bonds formed and told in such believable and charming manner.  i laughed(lots of chuckles throughout), i cried (when jim & spock meet by torchlight)...then laughed and cried again(some very emotionally touching scenes).  with each old chum being presented on screen one by one, scene by scene; each obligatory catch phrase popping up so organically....sitting on my couch in my living room in my floppy socks/sweat pants/tshirt uniform, i found myself repeatedly cheering, clapping, laughing and tearing up.  a thousand thank youes to mr. nemoy for participating.  it would NOT have been as moving an experience without him.  by the end of the movie both me & robbie were wiping tears from our faces while smiling from ear to ear!

i am RENEWED. i am once again HOPEFUL.

a movie that can do THAT is GOOD story telling.

now if we could only get governments to follow the Federations' model instead of a business model, we may actually get somewhere.",1289088000,,2160,4.90633608815427
3471868,4,B001AVCFJM,"To be fair, I've never watched a single episode or movie of the Star Trek franchise. What I know about it (""Beam me up, Scotty,"" phasers, ""Live Long and Prosper,"" and Klingon) all comes from being ingrained into pop-culture. Plus, as a lifetime STAR WARS fan, I just assumed Star Trek was my arch-enemy. That said, I now offer my review of the newest franchise film.

Star Trek begins with an exciting action sequence, filled with beautiful space imagery and fantastic technology. This spectacular display of future technology does not cease throughout the film, and it doesn't get old, either. The Starfleet spacecraft U.S.S. Enterprise, as well as the Romulun ship the Narada, are both visually stunning. The special effects throughout the film were all well done and only slightly cheesy a few times (a green-skinned woman? What?). Watching the fate of Vulcan was mesmerizing. Overall, I found the imagery of the movie Grade A eye candy.

The second aspect of the film I enjoyed was the intense action scenes. The few battle scenes between individuals, especially when the Starfleet crew arrived at Vulcan, were all entertaining to watch (albeit not as exciting as a lightsaber duel, but that's a different matter entirely). Abrams pumped adrenaline throughout the movie, and anyone seeking an action movie would surely enjoy this film.

For the most part the plot of the film was enjoyable, too, but not completely. To remain spoiler free there was a large problem with physics and continuity and reality that I felt would have been better explained using a different mechanism. The red-matter technology had some cool stuff to it, but the implications regarding timelines felt a bit too much. Sometimes this mechanism works (like Lost) and sometimes it doesn't (like Heroes). Besides this, the story of Kirk and Spock were both intriguing, and if you could forget about some things the conquest of the Romulans was cool, too.

In the end, Star Trek was a worthwhile movie to watch. I was entertained and thought the special effects were amazing. The story was good, but not great, due to a few fickle things I didn't like. Keisha, on the other hand, had no problems with it, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. If you're looking for a thrill-ride, sci-fi, eye-pleasing movie to watch during the Christmas season that's available on DVD, I'd recommend Star Trek.",1288828800,,2371,4.934837092731829
3471869,5,B001AVCFJM,"Really great movie, but it kills the entire next generation series. There is way too much time travel in the Star Trek series and movies. The movie is a game changing event so they can rewrite Star Trek with Kirk and Spock from a different angle.",1288656000,,246,4.369565217391305
3471870,5,B001AVCFJM,"The film explores the back stories of James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), before they unite aboard the USS Enterprise to combat Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from the future who threatens to destroy the United Federation of Planets.

Let me start off by saying that I'm not a Trekkie (is that how you spell it?) in any way nor have I seen a single second of the Star Trek universe in my entire life. In fact, I never really wanted to watch the films in the first place because they never interested me. However, since the fantastic J.J. Abrams was on board, I knew I should see this film. To my relief, the film was great. In fact, it's the best movie I've seen this year thus far!

If you find yourself almost teary in the first few minutes of this film, you know it'll be good. The film is character driven. There's a lot of action sequences, yes, but the film is really character driven. In fact, the high point of the film was its characters and the casting made it possible. From a glance, Chris Pine doesn't seem like the ""right"" person to be in the movie. After all, he doesn't have a good track record for the movies he has starred in so far. However, he really does a great job playing the charismatic, smart talk guy. Zachary Quinto does an equally exceptional job as Spock, a name I've heard so many times without knowing who he really was. Eric Bana plays an almost unrecognizable performance as the ""villain."" Simon Pegg and Karl Urban play the comedic relief characters. And to wrap the diverse ensemble up, Zoe Saldana, Ben Cross, John Cho, and Winona Ryder give us each a unique performance.

Apart from the cast, the action sequences were amazing, along with the special effects. The score by the underrated Michael Giacchino is great, especially hearing the theme song for the first time. However, the story is also really great. I didn't realize this was a time movie at first. I found it mentally stimulating. The laid back feel and the slapstick humor adds to the immense satisfaction when the credits roll.

The film is really good because there's almost nothing bad to say about it. Yes, maybe you can find one small detail here and there that doesn't make the film perfect, but no movies are perfect. This movie is human, with sharp dialogue, and fantastic characters, a complex story, with action sequences to fill on top. If you haven't seen a summer movie yet, make this your first one. As you can see, the film is very accessible for non-Trekkies. However, I'm sure the die-hard Trekkies will appreciate the new, fresh zest Abrams have brought into the film.",1288656000,,2603,4.56745182012848
3471871,4,B001AVCFJM,"I'm not really a big fan of Star Trek (I never saw the original TV series), but I did watch this '09 reboot with an open mind. After it was all over, I felt good about it. The movie is pretty fair: it wasn't great, but it wasn't really that bad. The story may have been eclipsed by the action, but the action itself is pretty neat: the confrontations between good and evil were mostly fun and intense to watch. The special effects are nothing really new, but they look impressive and fantastically detailed. The characters are likable, the old-school sets are cool, and the dialogue is never downright corny. The biggest problems I have with the film are nothing big. The music isn't very memorable, the actors' performances are somewhat stale, the cliches in the story was almost annoying, and the stereotypes are sometimes distracting. Still, this 2009 reboot of Star Trek is fun and fairly satisfying. I don't think I'll ever be a devoted fan of Star Trek, but that does NOT mean that I hate what's on here. I still like the movie (as well as some classic spin-offs).

3471876,5,B001AVCFJM,"The movie is superb in every way - taking an endearing sci-fi that we all can look forward to as our future, and give it a 21st century update with special effects and actions. But never lost was the focus of the main characters coming together in an alternate-but-parallel universe. It's brilliantly written to keep the prime time-line Star Trek universe intact as we all know it, while start anew with the characters we love. The first ten minutes opening scene is the most powerful I can ever recall for a movie. It's on par with the opening of Saving Private Ryan, but replacing the cold war chills with warm/touchy human emotions that every couple can feel and never want to happen.

The movie on the blu-ray has superb picture quality. The graphics are realistic. The sound of the star ships going into warp with BOOM was felt strongly on my 5.1 mid-range Klipsch speakers. The phaser firing everywhere on Narada had my boys ducking for cover, and I felt what seemed to be a muffed bullet coming out of the gun barrel follow by the high pitch of phase was just awesome.

The featurettes on the discs are very insightful and fun. My kids love to explore the Enterprise and Narada from different angles. As a casual Star Trek fan (but a big fan of the franchise nonetheless), I enjoyed the narration from JJ Abrams and the writers, on their philosophy of keeping true with Star Trek, but yet incorporate Star War'ish appeal to capture greater general audience.

I bought mine set of 3 discs with the Enterprise case that was Target exclusive. The 3 discs (one is digital copy that is no longer offered) are the same as what's in this standard blu-ray package.  It is worthy of being in anyone's blu-ray collection, especially at less than $20.",1287446400,,1747,4.625806451612903

I found myself captivated the entire time and found the action very good as well. It was a nice refreshing take on a old franchise. The dialogue in the movie is very well written and the casting was top notch.

3471878,4,B001AVCFJM,"Not having grown up on the original Star Trek and having barely any exposure to the seemingly endless series that have come after, I wasn't really sure what to expect when I first saw the movie. But WOW - the story is interesting, keeps you guessing, and paced fairly well (however, there are some parts you'll want to skip). Not having seen the original, I can't comment on how this compares but I can say that you need absolutely no knowledge of the old series to thoroughly enjoy this movie (on the other hand, I would imagine knowing about the old series will make the ""inside jokes"" in this movie more relevant, for example: something about Admiral Archer's dog?)

In terms of the DVD itself - the quality is fantastic. The BluRay format really does justice to all the special effect and the sound emphasizes the action when appropriate but also balances out some of the more emotional scenes.

3471882,3,B001AVCFJM,"The recent Star Trek (2009) movie reboot by writer/director J.J. Abrams was not everything I hoped for, but it was still a decent movie for the 11th film in the franchise. I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars. I was really excited to see this movie when it came out last year. The trailers and movie posters definitely look cool and slick, which enticed and excited me. And the fact that one of the creators of Lost and Alias was behind this franchise makeover was a big selling point too. The production design and cinematography in the movie are very well done...with just a few too many lens light flares I think. I really noticed them more on my 2nd viewing at home...and they started bugging me by the end of the film. The plot of the story and the writing were well done too. And of course the special effects were top notch.

I think the main thing that keeps me from really loving this movie is the acting. I feel like most of the actors are trying too hard to mimic the original actors and characters. Chris Pine feels like he's playing William Shatner playing James T. Kirk. And the same is true for the actors playing the characters Spock, Bones, Scotty, and Chekov. So I'm guessing that this was director Abrams approach to the movie. It feels a little ""cheesy"" to me going this route. I would have preferred to see a ""darker"" more dramatic and serious take on these characters like Christopher Nolan has done with the Batman franchise. But too be honest, I'm not sure anyone can ever capture this series better than the original actors did in the first six Star Trek movies. And that is why I think Gene Roddenberry went in a different but similar direction with all his spin-off series (Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, etc.), using new characters instead of trying to get new actors to play the original characters.  Part of it is the time when those original Star Trek movies came out and the chemistry between those original actors that embodied and owned these characters. The cheesiness that those actors brought to their characters in those movies felt more genuine. I mean who can deny that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986) is pretty ""cheesy""...and yet it's one of the best and most popular of the Star Trek movies. Whereas in this remake, the cheesiness feels artificial...again like they are mimicking the original series. But I will say that this movie was more successful in my eyes than the series of Next Generation Star Trek Movies that populated the 7th through 10th films in this franchise. For me the first 6 Star Trek films are the best of the franchise, with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn (1982) being the benchmark that all others must live up to.

On a broader note, I think Hollywood's current obsession with remaking every halfway decent and popular TV Show, Super Hero Comic, Book, Toy, or Movie franchise is really wearing thin. The last 10-20 years have just felt like nearly everything coming out of Hollywood in terms of blockbuster movies is a retread of something already created. How many different takes on Batman or Superman or Whatever can we take? Original content movies like Inception are the exception. I realize that there's always a new generation of younger people that don't know the original material, so these remakes are often targeted at them, along with the diehard and cult fans that will go see whatever movie has a name they recognize on it. But I for one am anxiously awaiting the return of original new material to the mainstream of Hollywood filmmaking. I do think that eventually Hollywood will see past remaking the Dukes of Hazard for the 13th time. Or Transformers 49.  But until then, I'm happy to see the few gems that do come out of all of these remakes and this new Star Trek is a great looking and feeling film. It definitely gives the Star Trek world a slick modern look that can't be matched by any of the older material. I just wish the characters and actors inhabiting this slick modern world had the depth that the originals had. But we'll see what Abrams does with the next Star Trek film.

The original series had a certain bravado, a brashness, a ballsy celebration of life to it that, in my opinion, was slowly washed out of subsequent works due to political correctness and other influences. This movie brings cajones back to the franchise. The youthful excitement, abandon, and testosterone explodes on the screen. For much of the film the proverbial governor is removed pushing the envelope beyond suggested maximum warp speed. Watching this movie feels not just like watching Star Trek, but like being a kid again and watching the first series for the first time. Except for perhaps the most particular of purists, who will watch anyway, there is so much in this film for everyone whether they are new fans or old ones who want to see Star Trek once again as it was when the world was young.",1284163200,,906,4.777070063694268

I read all the hype, followed the casting, read the blogs...and I was very, VERY worried. I didn't like the idea of someone new and NOT a fan taking over the helm and lives of my heroes.

Gotta say, I even subconsciously boycotted the film in theaters...finally, however, I sat down to watch the DVD, with more than a little grudge in my mind...I truly expected to hate it.

Now I won't say that, as a Trekker, I didn't have some issues with it...I don't want to put spoilers in this review, but there are a couple of glaring things that just punched me in the jaw...

...but as I kept watching, it all got to be all right (for the most part). The actors did an excellent job of portraying the characters the way I remember them, even improving in some areas...the writers paid ample respect and tribute to the legacy of the series, and Surak save me, I actually thoroughly enjoyed the film.

****POSSIBLE SPOILERS UPCOMING****

What few issues I have are easily relegated to the overall point of the plot; I mean, let's face it, parallel universes and alternate timelines are things that we as Trek fans ought to be used to by now, and as other reviewers have pointed out, just because a new timeline has been branched out upon does NOT mean that the timeline we know and love is erased...it's still there, just running in another continuum.

****END SPOILERS****

I liked the movie. I really did, and I look forward to the hoped for sequels...I don't view this as a replacement for what has gone before, but rather as a way to explore what different things could have happened to my favorite Starfleet heroes, as I think they are admirably recaptured in the actors portrayals, and I am anxious to enjoy their new adventures alongside them once again.

3471891,1,B001AVCFJM,"First of all, I admit that I'm somewhat biased by being a big fan of the original Star Trek movies. I grew up with them, so I had to take into account my bias when I finally got around to seeing JJ Abrams' 2009 version of Star Trek the other day. Suffice it to say, I was highly disappointed.

My disappointment with this movie has a lot more to do than with just the original actors being replaced with new, younger actors. Although, that certainly plays a factor. NONE of the new actors drew me in. None of their performances were truly impressive. They were average actors playing average, and sometimes over-the-top caricatures of the original portrayals of these great and classic characters. I found myself particuarly annoyed by Karl Urban's ""Dr. McCoy."" He was trying too hard to act the part just like DeForest Kelley. But that's on the low end of my annoyances. Anton Yelchin made me want to plug my ears every time he opened his mouth in his portrayal of ""Chekov,"" and I used to think Walter Koenig was bad. Now I think I can listen to Walter all day long. Simon Pegg's ""Scotty"" was satisfactory right up until he started to become annoyingly arrogant. John Cho, a Korean-American, as ""Sulu?"" Really? At least he made virtually no impact in the movie. And why was Zoe Saldana's ""Uhura"" in this movie at all? Abrams tried way too hard to make her a more significant character than she was before, but instead she came off as nothing but a cliched, stand-in love interest. Eric Bana as the villain ""Nero"" made no impact. He was perhaps the most boring and non-menacing villain of any of the ones I've seen in all movies, including TNG. A shame, too, because a much better villain could have brought this movie up a few notches. Villains make movies like this....See ""Wrath of Khan."" Heck, even see ""The Undiscovered Country."" Plummer was better than Bana. Both Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine were somewhat tolerable as ""Spock"" and ""Kirk,"" respectively, especially Quinto. Neither seemed over-the-top, and fortunately Pine didn't really try to act the part like Shatner. He'll never be Shatner, or Kirk for that matter.

One more thing to add about the actors is how they leave you with absolutely no feelings for the characters they portrayed. You simply don't care if they get hurt or die because they don't convince you to feel compassion for their plights. Their acting just isn't good enough. That also leads to the complete and total lack of chemistry between them. The original actors, when they got together to make the first ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture,"" had worked together for years on the original series and they formed a true bond that you can't fake on screen.

As for the story itself? Wow, too much to discuss in this review, so I'll keep it short and to the point. There were far too many ""conveniences"" and cliches in this movie. Want to make sure Character A/B/C takes his/her proper place in the story? No problem, let's kill off this guy, and that girl, and get rid of the Captain in this manner so that so-and-so can take his proper place in the big chair. What's bad is that most of the conveniences take place within seconds, or minutes, all lined up in almost perfect order. (spoilers) What about when Kirk gets stranded with old Spock? Oh boy, we can't see that cliched ice monster(for lack of a better description) coming after him can we? What about the ultra convenience of there being a nearby base that old Spock apparently didn't know anything about(based on his facial expressions when they enter the facility), that somehow allows the story to both introduce Scotty and make sure Kirk and Scotty can get back to the starship at the same time? What luck for Kirk!! Oh, and wasn't old Spock supposed to stay there? And someone please, please tell me, was the little ugly rock-like creature that was some sort of aid to Scotty really necessary? Was he supposed to incite a few giggles and laughs from the audience? EPIC FAIL.

I know I learned from this story that you can plug a black hole with a mining ship like a cork in a water drain, a ship that had previously gone through a black hole without any problems. I also learned that you need to pointlessly blow that ship into bits, although the black hole itself should have torn it apart. I learned that a starship can eject its warp core to blow itself back out of the black hole, and still make its way home in a relatively timely fashion. I learned that a turbo lift from the shuttle bay can make it to the bridge in a matter of about 3 seconds, even though it's supposed to go both virtically and horizontally on its trip there.

This movie boiled down basically to a generic space adventure with some nice visual effects, albeit not nearly as encompassing as the trailers made it look. And on that note, was this Star Trek or Star Wars? Seemed more like Star Wars at times. The movie left me with no feelings one way or another. I didn't like it and I didn't hate it. It was just forgettable, as in one second after the credits started to roll. It's an absurdly overrated film by the critics, most of whom were probably just big fans of Abrams' hit series ""Lost."" I don't recommend it unless you just want to add it to your Star Trek collection, which is why I bought it.",1283904000,3,5272,4.545263157894737

In the past decade, Hollywood has put out the best comic book movie ever (Dark Knight), the best zombie comedy ever (Zombieland), the best pirate movies ever (POTC 1-3), and now the best Star Trek movie ever.  Coming after a series of so-so Trek films from both the original and Next Generation genres, this is the first Star Trek movie not based on a TV serial.  Instead, all the actors and actresses are new, the soundtrack is new (except for the ending credits), the cinematography, shooting style, ship interior, ship exterior and everything else is new.  Hence a clean slate for the director and for the fans.  The result is probably one of the 5 best movies of 2009, and a movie that should have received a Best Picture nod from the Academy Awards.  The dialogue is engaging, the action scenes are a great mix of drama, tension and chaos, the fight scenes are bloody but not gory, and the movie's pacing is perfect.

Although only half-Vulcan, his demeanor (while I loved it!) was always in full-Vulcan mode.  I like the new side to Spock, and I like the romance between Spock and Uhura.  Although I originally liked William Shatner's Jim Kirk, over time I began to find the character pompous, arrogant, and full of himself.  It's interesting, and very realistic to me, that the young Jim Kirk had those characteristics in abundance!  In all, I like the direction that this reboot to the classic series is taking.  I enjoyed the movie and look forward to its sequel.",1283299200,,725,4.798387096774194
3471897,2,B001AVCFJM,"I was never a ""trekkie"" although I grew up watching the original Star Trek series and enjoyed the first 3 or 4 feature films such as The Wrath of Khan and The Voyage Home.  What they lacked in visual effects and technological savvy they more than made up for in story, pitch and character development.

Star Trek 2009 is not a ""bad"" movie.  There is a plot and the movie does involve the genesis of the original characters and how and why they found themselves together aboard the acclaimed USS Enterprise.  Unfortunately, the film focuses too little on these events and primarily concerns itself with action scenes and special effects.

Almost from the word GO the movie is about loud and noisy, although visually spectacular, battle scenes combined with exhausting, seemingly never ending brawls between the various characters.  In between, the plot is very difficult to follow.  There are several flash forwards accompanied by several flashbacks because the plot involves....you guessed it, a black hole involving time travel.  I was so busy trying to unravel the plot shifts that it wasn't until well after the movie ended that I came to the conclusion that the storyline was actually pretty clever.

Star Trek 2009 is all about fast, furious and visually entertaining and leaves little to the imagination.",1283212800,2,1310,5.0

3471901,3,B001AVCFJM,"Back in the day, I was a fan of Star Trek. Later, I watched many but not all episodes of New Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager. I planned to watch this movie eventually, and put it on my gift wish list. Someone finally bought it for me. I was pleasantly surprised by parts of it, but disliked other parts.

In the opening sequence,I enjoyed the initial introduction with Kirk's Father/Mother and Spock with his Mother and Father. As someone else said, the opening sequence was ""stunning and emotional"". I HATED the boy Kirk and bad boy Kirk in the academy especially his coming on to Uhura, the bar fight, and the segment about Kobyashi Maru (beyond pathetic). I almost gave up on the movie. My husband turned thumbs down and left the room. I kept watching and it improved. I was surprised that I enjoyed the Uhura/Spock romance and various changes in other characters. That is what was unexpected. The acting and cinematography were good.

Overall, the plot was too over the top for my taste. So Nero came back to the past and didn't bother to save his planet! Huh! I never cared for time travel stories as plot devices, and this one is no exception. The Kobyashi Maru scene was a great disappointment. It could have been so much better. My rating is more of a 2 1/2 stars out of 5 because the plot was often way too silly and melodramatic. I suggested that my husband finish watching the movie some day when he doesn't have anything else to do, and that he try to overlook some of the hot shot Kirk scenes.",1281830400,2,1514,4.462093862815885
3471902,2,B001AVCFJM,"Undeniably, great special effects. Unfortunately not sufficient to make a good movie. The story line is poor, linear, and barely compares to the Star Trek universe. This version is more like space cowboys. I am a The Next Generation fan. In TNG, Captain Picard is constantly faced with situations that require a discerning and strategic approach, combining smarts, negotiation, creativity, tactical maneuvers, not just the boring ""let's blow them up with a bunch of proton torpidos"".

3471903,1,B001AVCFJM,"Boy...I don't know where to start with this pile of useless tripe, well first off, they've made Star Trek into a FAMILY franchise with this, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying families cannot watch the older movies and series together, because they sure can, but what they've done is make it into a franchise that even non-trekkers will like, and that just doesn't work, second, they pretty much completely RE-WROTE the Star Trek universe! if you're a fan of the Original Series like me, you will see what I mean, it just doesn't add up.

And this that I am going to mention now, is just AWFUL, Spock (Vulcans cannot fall in love right?) WRONG, Spock and Uhura fall in love, and Uhura becomes Spocks little whore, this is just not the way Star Trek is, that was part of the scheme to make it a family franchise, WAKE UP J.J. Abrams, another complaint I have is the actors, now obviously the original cast is either too old now or deceased, so you can't get them for it, SO WHY EVEN TRY?! save the guy who played Spock and save the guy that played McCoy, they were pretty good, but the rest? Chris Pine is far from William Shatner, whoever played Scotty is not even close to James Doohan, whoever played Uhura? Nichelle Nichols should be disappointed.

Well, that about sums it up, bottom line, if you're a fan of The Original Series or any subsequent series (I love The Next Generation as well) steer far clear of this abomination.",1281398400,7,1431,4.478927203065134

3471910,5,B001AVCFJM,"This is not the Star Trek of my youth, and I was a big fan - yet this movie delivers the freaking goods in ways that the wussy-fied Star Trek of the nineties could only dream about (Deep Space Nine, Voyager).  In this film, we're no longer in conflict about sipping 'tainted' mushroom soup (see Voyager - no, don't see it), now the stakes are real, larger than life, and important in the journey of this young crew. The entire cast raises the bar on performances, interaction, good chemistry and comedic timing.  It's uncanny how much Zachary Quinto resembles Leonard Nimoy in the role of Spock, while still putting his own tweak to the character. Chris Pine IS Captain Kirk.
Dr. McCoy is lovable and comedic and played to a ""T ""by Karl Urban.

It is very rare - preciously rare - that a big-budget franchise employs first class effects, compelling sound, and 3 strong Acts all in the service of character-driven storytelling. ""Star Trek"" is that rarity. This is Star Trek as space opera, big and adventurous, and is only given proper justice by seeing it in hi-def!",1280188800,2,1066,4.62962962962963

The tragedy of new life given birth and the sacrifice to protect it was going very deep although there was no prior introduction of characters (probably has something to do with me being father of a 2 year old child -> accelerated identification :).

But then one disappointment followed the other. There was some self-irony which made me hope now and then that the movie would pick-up the pace of ST IV - until the destruction of Vulcan. Then I realized it was not a reboot of Star Trek but a re-format with a big middle finger sticking out of the dust cloud. Usually they warn you before all previous stored data will be lost - not here.

Well, all other things have already been said in previous 1-star reviews. No need to mention them here again. Only one question I'd like to ask:
There are really great books that pick up the story-line after Nemesis. Why do more timetravel non-sense and why not create a movie that is based on such great stories that were written by authors who actually know the ST-Universe and who know what ST really is about (discovery of new life and civilizations, principles, mutual respect)?

A recommendation for all disappointed ST-Fans: get the books from the ""A time to..."" and from the ""Destiny"" series and the ones in between (TNG). I despised reading ST books before that but after this movie-fiasko I was happy to read good stories and do some ""healing"". I read about 15 books in just 3 months. The other great thing about these books: They don't end after 45 minutes but last for hours! Really worth a try...",1279497600,13,1696,4.572368421052632

I wasn't too impressed with the interior shots and set of the engine room/lower levels of the Enterprise, as it's painfully obvious they were shot in a present-day industrial facility of some sort. That was the low point for me, and it stood out like a sore thumb in an otherwise well-made flick.

The writers came up with their own version of star trek that is as much like star trek as cat is to a  a dog.  The plot and storyline of this movie was laughable at best.  They should have named it something else but not star trek.  Here's one little example:  kirk is put in charge of the ship's bridge and in a few short minutes goes from being a recruit to being the captain of a ship.  That is absurd as captains get to be in their position after many years of military experience at a minimum of ten to twelve years on the low side.

3471926,1,B001AVCFJM,"Without a doubt a great looking movie and that's about its only redeeming quality.
  This movie probably has one of the most ridiculous plots of anything of the Star Trek franchise, either tv or movie, obviously the producers have absolutely no concept of physics or time paradox.
 Over use of special effects, totally pointless action sequences, incessant need to try and work everything from original Star Trek lore into a  two hour movie, just jumbled things even more.
  If you are a die hard Trekkie, obviously this movie is a must, but if this is the future of Star Trek then the franchise really is doomed.
 And what's with the tattooed Romulans, why is it that every bad guy today has to have tats, bit like the 80s, when every bad guy had dangly earing and mullet.
  Honestly if you have the ability to go back in time and change things, why wouldn't you just prevent the future destruction of your planet, instead of destroying those responsible, 'makes no sense!""",1276992000,7,974,4.682352941176471

As kind of a mid-level consumer of this old, old franchise, I love this movie. I couldn't give it five stars because there were some plot holes, and because Spock did stray from that classic ""I'm being so literal that, ironically, it comes across as sarcasm,"" into actual sarcasm, which was too bad.

Maybe going back and time and doing an alternate universe is a bit of a cheat. This deep into the franchise, using such overworked gimmicks, this movie could have been a total failure. But sometimes, using every cliche in the book just works. This movie took the old tools (time travel alternate universe, the origin of everyone's catch-phrase, saving the Earth from technologically advanced aliens using the unstoppable combination of comradery and pluck...) and used them right.

The cast is great. Zachary Quinto had the perfect warm reserve for Spock, and Chris Pine should be given some sort of ceremonial Key to Shatner City because that was the most thrilling homage to Captain Kirk I could ever imagine. I think it took a lot of sensitivity on his part and on JJ Abrams' to treat this character with so much good humor and not make him a joke.

The special features were also fun. The out-takes are really charming. The featurette was good too. They showed a lot of the home-grown tricks and special effects they used, and bring you into the process.

JJ Abrams helms the directorial duties and we are introduced to the crew quickly, so we have James T Kirk (Chris Pine) a directionless youth who is goaded to enlist and in order to honor the memories of his brave father. He quickly gets in to problems namely with a certain commander who himself had a problematic childhood, named Spock. Their problems are relegated to the background when they have to answer an emergency call from Vulcan. So they fly there to prevent the genocide by a Romulan (Eric Bana). The crew comprises of faces that should be familiar to every trekkie, and they include McCoy (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Chekhov (Anton Yelchin) in a great Russian accent, and Scottie (Simon Pegg).
Also included are appearances by Leonard Nimoy who played Spock on the original series. I wonder why they could not find a story arc for the appearance of William Shatner as the original James T Kirk. However fans will cherish the final two minutes and the computer voice of Rodenberry.

I saw most of the episodes but I never read the novelizations or attended a convention.  The charm of the original was they were on a limited budget so they had to compensate with imaginative stories that contained wit and humor.  I'll be forever grateful to ""Trek"" for providing me with one of my pubescent objects of desire, Uhura (Nichelle Nichols).  When the movies came out they were something of a mixed bag.  The better ones, ""Wrath of Khan"" and ""The Voyage Home"" had great stories in contrast to the weaker ones ""Star Trek-The Motion Picture"" and the one Shatner directed whose title escapes me.  Alas, J.J. Abrams effort falls into the same trap as the worst Trek movies by compensating visuals and sound for story.  Maybe that was deliberate because the story here is rather slight.  There are things to recommend here notably in the films quieter moments the new actors(Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, et al) acquit themselves well in the parts so strongly identified with others.  Leonard Nimoy's abbreviated screen time brightens up the screen suggesting that this old dog knows what made ""Star Trek"" an institution.

3471937,4,B001AVCFJM,"The original Star Trek concept melded problem solving effort with any action used to make the story more palatable.  The action was a sidetrack to the elements of achieving the mission.

In this movie, the merging of problem solving with action tends to lean heavily in the direction of the action.  Many will find that to be a great addition to the Star Trek mythos.  I, personally, do not prefer it.  Star Trek has been ridden with much that is meaningless ever since Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.  Even The Wrath of Khan focuses too much on action and too little on problem solving, though the Kobiashi Maru scenario is developed very well in that film.

Having said all of that, I go on to say that I loved this Star Trek movie for many reasons.  First, it is just fun as everything to watch it.  So much is going on in it that you have to pay attention to everything.  Some of the reality altering ideas really develop for us a viewer's struggle to understand it all.  Despite being a very fast paced movie it is also surprisingly and inventively simple.

Now, the problems I mentioned as existing in this film are forgiven for a good reason, though I will dock it one star.  This movie certainly did something unique: it broke the convention of all the old Star Trek ideas and yet maintained the nature of the famous Star Trek characters.  Zachary Quinto is great at doing Spock, and the fellow playing Kirk manages to do what this really intends: satire.  This is a satire of all things Star Trek and the satire is layered in such a way so that while it makes fun of the idea it at the same time does honor to it.  This film, despite getting a lot of rave reviews, will probably never be considered for the true artistry within it.

Dare I say, this is one of the worst sci-fi movies ever made. The first 15 minutes of this loser speaks volumes-Capt. Kirk, is now, apparently, a bad boy rabel-rouser. Anyway, he's seen going really, really fast in a 20th century motorcycle, listening to a 20th century heavy metal song in a 23rd century world. I kid you not. And it goes downhill from there.
But, whadda except from one of the most over-rated directors, J.J. Abrams, in the last 20 years! With the possible exception of Micheal Bay.

I checked this piece of crapola out at my library for free, with an open mind, hoping for the best, and possibly buying it in the future. It was not even worth seeing it for free, that's how bad it is.

3471940,5,B001AVCFJM,"Short and sweet, as the movie has been out for quite a while.

This was a FUN movie.  Remember when Hollywood knew how to make fun movies?

Humor, Action, Drama, Great Special Effects, Well Written Script and Plot.  Also, somewhat politically incorrect in parts, something welcome in the PC orientated Hollywood.

The Star Trek franchise needed a reboot, and JJ Abrams instead gave it a kick in the ass, in the very best sense of the phrase.

All your favorite characters are back, but given knew life by talented actors and a truly well-thought out script.

Due to interference by a time traveling Romulan, however, the characters you knew so well and the universe THEY knew has been radically altered, and all of their fates are once again unknown.

Ordinarily I would bemoan the time traveling device because Star Trek (all the series and too many of the movies) unfortunately drew from that well too often.

This time the scenario fits perfectly with what they need to accomplish with the reboot, and if they follow through in the subsequent movies with the concept of a known yet UNKNOWN universe, they will have served the franchise well.

Complaints are minor.

Hard as I tried, I had a hard time warming up to the actor in the role of Chekov.  He gives it his all, and is not a bad actor, but he LOOKS more Irish than Russian to me, so I found the role not quite convincing.  He would have been right at home in Angela's Ashes.

Also, I know Star Trek is known for somewhat, er, cheesy make-up for aliens, but I thought this reboot could get away from that.  However, I found Scotty's alien companion to be just that sort of not quite convincing xeno.

Other than that, it was a great ride, and I am hoping Abrams makes the very most of what he has wrought with this new vision.

Again, FUN!",1274400000,,1799,4.503086419753086
3471941,5,B001AVCFJM,"Ok, where to start? Being an old fart, I can remember the very first Star Trek show on TV. I have always been a science fiction fan. But when I saw this first TV show. I was hooked. I have seen every TV show and Movie that has to do with Star Trek. I must admit, I was really looking forward to see, just what they were going to do with this one. I will say, I was not disappointed in any way. First let me talk about the actors. I do not know if it was left up to the actors to interpret how to act out each charter, but I must say, I think they all did a great job. I was amazed at how well bones came across. I thought I was watching a young Defrost Kelly. This actor had him pegged. Of all the actors, the only one I was a bit surprised with was Scotty. I thought he was a wee bit to light hearted in this version.  But I think these new actors were also trying to make each person, their own.  I will say, I was a bit surprised at who Spock was evolved with. Now about the story line. There are so many good things to say about it, I guess the only one I was surprised with is how Kirk ended up with the starship. Sure he got a battle field commission as second in command, as he was the best suited person, from what the captain had to pick from, but once back home, at Star fleet. He should have been relieved of his command. I mean, look at Custer. He got a battle field promotion to General, but once the war was over, he was busted back to Lt Col .The same would normally have happen to Kirk. Others have pointed this out, and I must agree with them. I mean in this version, Kirk did not even finish the academy. But like I said, there are so many good points to the story line, that this is a small problem.  And who knows that the next installment might bring, maybe they will address this problem. One thing I will say, I have a friend, who does not watch any Science Fiction at all. Has never watched any Star Trek at all. He knows the names of the charters, but never watched a whole story. He happen to come over while I was watching this, I had stopped at the point when Kirk is with the green Orion girl. That did get his interest. I started the movie up, and he sat and watched the whole thing. At the end, he asks, ARE ALL OF THE STAR TREK SHOWS LIKE THAT? I said why do you ask? He said if they are, I think I need to start watching them. I think no better praise can be given to this movie than that. I for one cannot wait for the next installment. I feel like a whole new world of Star Trek is open for exploration. I feel young again.

3471942,5,B001AVCFJM,"So .... I love all things Star Trek. I can watch ANY episode/movie from any of the series ... over and over again.

I saw this movie when it came out. I walked out when it was over ... completely stunned!!! They took the entire franchise and basically yelled ... DO OVER!? Alternate time line starting basically at Kirk's birth? A NEW Star Trek?

Hmmm

Let THAT sink in!

Well ... I could argue both sides of any argument related to the script ... holes can be justified etc ...

But WHY did I watch the shows in the past?

I have watched and re-watched this movie several times ... and BAM ... it dawned on me ...

From day one ... Original Trek ... to ME Star Trek was all about the interaction between Kirk, McCoy and Spock! I loved how they participated in action/adventure ... and still had a sense of humor!! THAT is what fueled my love for sc-fi!!

When I watched the movie originally ... I was distracted by the already famous actors ... Simon Peg, Karl Urban, etc ... so the first time I saw the movie I spent more time adjusting ... in my head I could see their prior characterizations ... I was seeing them individually ... I was seeing more of their past work than the characters I had grown to love in the TV show. In re-watching the movie ... OMG ... they are SPOT ON with their renditions! They used juuust enough common phrases ... mimicked just enough actions ... had just enough humor ... yes they could definitely pass for ALTERNATE TIME-LINE VERSIONS of the originals ...

In rewatching this movie ... I don't think it is intended to replace the original ... I HAD thought that it was ... but no ... THIS IS NOT A REMAKE ... it seems to take the Star Trek franchise from 1963 into 2010 ... if it feels dumbed down .. welcome to our current reality and every other movie out there ... it is a sign of the times.

The loss of Vulcan, Spock's mom, Kirk's dad, etc ... it will affect the future. The changes were difficult to watch, knowing they prolly won't be taken back ... but maybe change is good? I didn't like the Uhura/Spock kiss/relationship ... I coulda done without that bit ... but he is actually the most logical choice for her.

I hope they keep making movies based on this alternate time line and that the makers of this movie thought ahead and contracted the main actors for many films to come!!

When I look at the Original TV show/movies ... and this new movie ... seeing there is nearly FIFTY YEARS separating them ... I feel I can only compare the FEELING I get from the main characters (the duplicates from the original series) ... is it the same feeling I had from the original series?? I take into account ... that writing styles have changed, society has changed, special effects have changed, people have changed, ETC ... BUT I take it all in ... and then ask myself, what feeling did the new characters give me?? I can say that the new characters were cast so well ... that I can definiely imagine the new cast as the originals ... thrown back in time to begin a new set of adventures based on a different time-line/alternate reality.

This movie had action/adventure ... the good guys and bad guys were VERY sexy ... good sci-fi story line which enabled a beloved character from the first series to join the cast ... Uhura had more to say/do than spin in her chair and say ""Hailing frequencies open sir"" ... etc etc etc ... I will re-watch this movie for years to come.

I plan on buying the 2 disc set to see the deleted scenes and have a digital copy ...

Buy it, watch it, love it!",1273881600,,3527,4.306646525679758

3471946,5,B001AVCFJM,"I am sure that most Star Trek fans will like this movie.  For me the things that I found most satisfying is the perfect characterization the actor who portrayed Kirk achieves.  He did a great job in my opinion of capturing Kirk's mannerisms, gestures, swagger and cocky self assurance.  I thoroughly enjoyed his performance.

I also have the same appreciation for the actor portraying Spock.  Perhaps a bit soft spoken, but he is a spit image look alike for Nimoy, and that goes a long way.  He also captured the essence of Spock. As for the other standard characters, I found the actor portraying Scott to be the next best performance, but not so much Sulu or Uhuru.  Uhuru didn't sell me on her character, and I never knew Spock and Uhuru had a previous relationship. I did not, however, think the actor playing Chekhov was well chosen.  Totally unbelievable.

Story line was pretty good, and I thought that Eric Bana played a superb ""bad-guy"" role.  He is fast emerging as my favorite male lead, since Troy.

3471952,5,B001AVCFJM,"For perspective, I'm a First Gen Trekker...having seen 'em all in their respective timeframes.  Which also means I have the benefit of hindsight and I'm not easily swayed.

This movie blows the socks off anything in the franchise.  For example, at the time, we were all excited to see the first Star Trek movie 30 years ago with a huge, realistic Enterprise on a large movie screen. Today - V'ger, cheesy effects, etc. - it seems a bit silly.  Then we had a 24th century luxury cruise ship staffed by preachy goodie-goodies, followed by more gritty offshoots and so-so movies that were heavy on production design, often badly-matted effects and short on substance, save Patrick Stewart's 20-year development of the Picard character.  Although perhaps a bit bland, I never had any particular problem with ""Enterprise""/Bakula because it had substance...until the desperate-for-ratings silliness of alien Nazis.

But J.J. Abrams is exactly the person who was needed to give the franchise an adrenaline shot straight to the heart muscle.  Well done!

*Clever use of an alternative timeline as license to keep the best - including the more successfull, darker side of the Berman style - and jettison the rest.

*Extraordinary casting.  It's obvious to me that each actor is a sharp, accomplished professional who deserves every damn dollar he/she can earn from the movie.  This is particularly true for the primary crewmembers we all know and love.

*Chris Pine deserves special recognition for capturing all the facial, posture and timing nuances of the character developed by William Shatner.  (Did Shatner coach him?).  There is no mistaking this is James T. Kirk.  Pine nevertheless builds on Shatner's work to make Kirk his own.  Again, though, this is something most every lead actor (Quinto, Urban, Saldana, Pegg and Yelchin) does with his/her respective character (Cho, however, is a complete miss on Sulu...James Kyson Lee might have been a better choice, imho, given his action flick background).  A real treat to have such talent together in one movie.

*Storyline development (including humor) and technology are absolutely recognizable to any Trek fan.  If you're okay with basic temporal mechanics, you'll feel right at home.

In short, I'm glad to see a clean break with the [tired] Rick Berman style in favor of something which, to me, is truer to Roddenberry's vision.",1272412800,,2380,5.132467532467532

My only disappointment was that, as the film went on the action took over to the point
where the emotions got a bit lost, and the climactic battle felt a bit predictable.

The action is fun, but it gets repetitive, while the human scenes retain their humor
and freshness.

What always made Star Trek special for me was it's emphasis on characters and
intelligence first, action second.  So I was sorry that ended up a bit reversed by the

Regarding the story, it was pretty good and well worth seeing but not as good as ""Wrath of Khan"".  If you want a synopsis, sorry, I'm not writing one.  There are too many excellent ones just a quick search away.

As for the movie on blu-ray - WOW!  I've seen it in theaters, in planes, on DVD, etc, but never in high-def.  The detail was simply incredible.  I'm glad I was so familiar with the story because I was focused on all sorts of little viewing details.  The movie was definitely shot in a manner that transferred well to high def.  During the first scenes I was distracted by the actor's complexions.  Amazing.  Just amazing.

3471959,5,B001AVCFJM,"Aside from being a movie which keeps the viewer's interest from beginning to end, this ""Star Trek"" movie serves the purpose of tying up a lot of loose ends from the original series.  One comes away with a much better understanding of the characters, and can get much more out of the original episodes when watching them again.  This is a key aspect of the film, since other than its social commentary and obvious allegorical nature, what has always set all of the ""Star Trek"" series and movies apart from other SciFi on TV and in theaters is that it is character-driven, rather than depending on the special effects and story lines (though the writers have always been good as well).

3471966,3,B001AVCFJM,"As a fan of the original series Star Trek cast and characters I would like to go up to JJ Abrams, get in his face, and say ""What were you thinking?!?"" in my best drill sergeant voice.  This new Star Trek movie has gone so far off the reservation in terms of characters and story that I'm not sure it's even on the MAP any more.  I mean, I love watching Trek in any form, but Spock getting all whiny and emo when he loses his mother??  That is too much to stomach.

As someone who likes a good popcorn flick with lots of action and explosions, however, I have to confess that I did like this one, because it has plenty of those.  Also, Chris Hemsworth did an admirable job as George Kirk, James T's dad, and Karl Urban absolutely nailed the part of McCoy.  I think that if DeForest Kelley had lived to see this movie, he would have loved Urban's performance even if he hated the rest of the movie.

All in all, an okay movie, but with too many plot complications and holes to satisfy the old-guard Trek fans.  I would recommend it to those who are just getting into Trek with a strong admonition to watch the original series episodes ASAP so they know what Trek is REALLY supposed to be all about.",1271030400,,1196,4.214912280701754

James Kirk, Spock, Bones, Uhura, Scottie, Sulu and Chekhov. All of the actors playing these parts greatly resemble their characters in later years. We learn about Kirk's mother and father, how Kirk got into the academy and eventually commanded his own Star Ship. The plot is centered around an embittered Romulun who blames the Vulcans for his family's demise and his attempts to obliterate the Vulcan race and their planet. Leonard Nemoy makes an appearance as the future Spock which is a big mind-bending - how can a present and future person coexist together? But all in all, this is a thoroughly entertaining, action-packed movie. I hope future movies are planned of the early years of the officers of the USS Enterprise.",1270684800,,898,4.9144736842105265

3471976,5,B001AVCFJM,"J.J. Abrams asked the questions of his creative staff when he began this Star Trek movie odyssey, Can we make it cool? and How can we make it for everyone? He certainly answered the first question in the decidedly affirmative and accomplished the second query when he created this marvelous film. The acting is incredible with actors that have the same magical chemistry working together that the cast of the original Star Trek series had. Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine are perfect mirror images in both demeanor and appearance of Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner playing the starring roles of Spock and Captain James T. Kirk respectively. I was particularly impressed with the versatility of Zachary Quinto's acting skills, because Spock in this film is a vastly different character than the one I have enjoyed seeing him play in the television series Heroes where he is the unpredictable villain-turned-hero Sylar. The rest of the talented cast members do not disappoint either.

The second disk in this set is fascinating. It includes deleted scenes which I would love to see eventually incorporated into the film. While they were not absolutely necessary, those scenes added meaning to the storyline of the movie. There are also wonderful interviews and some behind-the-scenes peeks into the creative process of producing this film. There is a casting feature that gives us an insightful look into the complicated process of finding the talented actors willing to make the attempt to fill some big shoes and emulate the iconic actors that started the Star Trek phenomenon.

What I loved most was the direction that J.J. Abrams took in developing this new Star Trek adventure. I have been a Star Trek fan since the original series first aired in 1966 when I was 10 years old. My mother, father, brother and I all watched it together as a family every week when each new episode aired. I have seen every episode of all five of the series created for television as well as all eleven now of the movies produced for the silver screen. I was only sad that they did not produce a movie to conclude Star Trek: Voyager with Chakotay marrying Seven-of-Nine. Oh, well! I was devastated, however, when the television producers called it quits after Star Trek: Enterprise. It was my great joy, however, to see J.J. Abrams bypass the problems associated with prequel productions by inventing an alternate time-line for the original Star Trek storyline in this movie. That brilliant maneuver made it possible to create an entirely new and different story while still maintaining the spirit of the original show along with the development of the characters and their relationships with one another. It also leaves the creators with limitless freedom to come up with more new stories. I truly hope that they will not stop with this movie and will go on to give us more Star Trek in series form on television. I and my children have grown up with Star Trek, and I would love to see my grandchildren do so as well. If not, this movie is still a very worthwhile experience, and it was great fun to wander the decks of the Enterprise again.

After posting the comments above, I decided to read the other reviews that have been posted here.  I was shocked by the many vehement criticisms of the visual effects in this movie.  So, I have decided to add this postscript.  Personally, I thought the special effects were stunning, but then I am also an avid book reader and a published author, so perhaps visual effects are not as important to me as they are to others who prefer visual forms of entertainment.  Even so, however, the original Star Trek series was never about visual effects.  It was about the well developed stories which included complex larger-than-life characters.  In fact, when the network television moguls tried their best to kill off Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry's budget for visual effects was cut leaving him with little more than cardboard and paper mache to create his sets with.  Cheesy primitive sets still didn't stop the fans from watching the stories created in the ensuing episodes.  Since those tactics didn't work the network canceled the series outright, but did that stop the adoring fans?  It certainly didn't, and the network offices were inundated with literally millions of letters demanding more Star Trek.

When the entertainment industry decided that the fans couldn't be ignored, they appropriated proper funding for better visual effects for the movies and new series that followed.  No one will deny that better visual effects make watching Star Trek a lot more fun, but unless you have a great story to tell no amount of money and time spent on visual effects is going to make it worth watching.  This movie is a truly great story.  Even Leonard Nimoy, who had decided that he would never play the part of Spock again after the few episodes he guest starred in during Star Trek:  The Next Generation, was moved nearly to tears when he was presented with this story line and realized that J.J. Abrams and his creative team really understood what the original Star Trek was all about.  Then he enthusiastically put his ears back on and took on the role of his endearing character, Spock, once more.

3471979,1,B001AVCFJM,"As I watched this film I kept thinking to myself ""well, hold your judgment, you can let that one slide, give it a chance"" - and I did to the bitter end. And while the film certainly had its enjoyable moments, seeing it was an entirely bittersweet affair. The opening scene promptly lost its dramatic element through its sheer ridiculousness. The attempt to rush the sorrow of George Kirk's (Jim's father) death, the happiness of Jim's birth, and the pleasantries of baby naming into a minute long conversation during a joyride into the center of the Romulan ship was in fact quite indicative of what was to come in the film, as action always took priority over good drama and plausability.

This was a film that at its core seemed to be ashamed of what Star Trek has built, and determined to replace that monument with a slam-bam story of feverish spliced together scenes that, even when they were good, were gone too fast to use their spark to ignite the movie into something really special.

It was not enough to see Kirk run into the bridge with his life-saving intuition, he had to have hands swelled up like the hamburger helper's and McCoy constantly giving him (strangely painful) hyposprays for comedic effect. It wasn't enough for Kirk to be chased by one ferocious snow creature when he was marooned, instead that creature had to be eaten up - Star Wars style - by a far more ridiculous creature, that, had it not been colored such a happy shade of red, would have fit right into Stephen King's ""The Mist"". It wasn't enough just to get Mr. Scott to the Enterprise, we had to have him fly through a bunch of water tubing just for fun, even though Simon Pegg's talent was more than adequate to forego such shallow (pun intended?) misadventures. It was not even enough to take orbital parachutes to that weapon platform to confront the Romulans, there had to be some hearty ""Pirates""-style swashbuckling to finish it off.

Rather stunning, also, was the complete irreverance to everything that Trek has established in over 40 years, despite repeatedly promises from the filmmakers to the contrary. Most notably of which was the ""Nero screwed up the timeline so now we can do ANYTHING we want with your beloved universe"" strategy. The most important alien planet in Star Trek is promptly eliminated, and the consequences of what should be a monumental tragedy for the Federation are highly glossed over. Engineering was turned into something resembling the basement of a 20th century wastewater facility. I half expected Scotty to be wearing a Roto-Rooter patch style patch (considering the shameless Nokia advertisement forced into the young kirk scene, it sadly may not have even been that unexpected). The phasers (both hand and ship ones) were changed from the familiar directed energy beams to ""pew-pew-pew"" shooters much more suited for Han Solo's belt than any ship or person in Star Trek. Even the ship itself had a more cartoonish look - it just did not look very majestic, nor did the insides of the ship match the outside well. When the shuttle doors were open it appeared the bay took up half of the entire hull. In short, the writers just didn't care very much what was previously established to fans, even if it couldn't be explained by the big-middle-finger-alternate-timeline-theory.

Star Trek has always been praised for both spurring new scientific advances, and at least somewhat representing current theory in a palatable form. Those days are no longer. The uses of a black hole in this film were nonsensical, and laughable even to someone who's only knowledge of astronomy was gleaned from a semester of the subject in middle school. The horrendously unimaginative ""red matter"" was never explained, it just was magic stuff that makes black holes. (In addition to being fun and gooey!)

The acting was not what made this film fail. It was the writing and production. Indeed, every original cast member (with maybe the exception of John Cho), did an admirable job of reprising the classic roles of their predecessors. Chris Pine lacked Shatner's dialogue style, but he had the swagger. Quinto was a more than believable Vulcan (except during the gratuitous make-out scenes with Uhura, which were stunningly out of place and character). Urban and Yelchin captured their character's vocal cadence and personalities well. Bana could have been a more engaging villain, but I fault his lack of opportunity to be tragic and evil more on the writers than his acting ability. It was worth the price of admission when I saw this in the theatre to see Leonard Nimoy as Spock again, despite the weakly concocted ""oops I let Romulus blow up"" story that could have, with just a little more effort, been much more intensely and believably relayed to viewers. I will give kudos for showing the inside of a mind-meld on screen, though. The effort, despite the substandard story relayed by said mindmeld, was cool.

There was also plenty of reference to previous Treks, but more in the form of token moments than in actual film construction. There were the quizzing computers on Vulcan reminscent of Star Trek IV, the mind control bug thing from Star Trek II, the much anticipated Kobayashi Maru simulation (which in itself was would have been very satisfying if so many other scenes also didn't stretch out for cheap laughs.) The lines you expect our dear characters to say were delivered, if just to fill an obligatory requirement. This is in fact perhaps the funniest of all the Star Trek films, but Star Trek isn't a sit-com. I can laugh with everyone else, but at the end of the day, I didn't feel like I was laughing with the movie, I felt like I was laughing at it's ridiculousness.",1269993600,27,5698,4.821063394683026

3471985,4,B001AVCFJM,"***SPOILERS***

This film is a ""reboot"" of the Star Trek franchise, putting new actors into the old roles, and painting a pleasingly modern gloss over the whole thing. This has stirred some controversy, but only amongst some of the Trekkers. I think, given that there's no way a big FX-heavy movie aimed just at the hardcore fans could make money, the producers were right to say ""Forget it, we're going mainstream."" And there's so much hate in Trek-dom these days (sadly), the haters were going to hate it anyway...

That said, my personal reaction is the same as most here: I'm ambivalent, but positive overall. I don't particularly like the popcorn ride aspect of the film, or the plot holes (throwing Kirk off the ship instead of into the brig). The callousness with which our heroes blew Nero away at the end left a bad taste in my mouth; and Bana's Nero was unimpressive IMO - not so much a cosmic villain, more a guy who picks fights in bars. And the engine room looked like a brewery ;)

OTOH, we can agree that the casting was generally excellent, and the character interaction very enjoyable as well as being true to the original. Most of the cast bring their parts to life with the spirit of their originals. For me, Chris Pine doesn't quite have the quirky individuality Shatner gave to the role, but plenty of people love his performance, and it's hard to dislike his energy and enthusiasm for the part. Other elements were quite squee-worthy, of course: Sulu possibly even cooler than in the original, Scotty made even more Scottish; beaming with the original sound effects, Uhura/Spock, ""Get out of the chair"", the eager redshirt; the alternate timeline device, which I think in retrospect was the only way they could really go. I could go on. I have no problem with Kirk making captain - you guys never hear of a field promotion?

In terms of production (sets, costumes, effects, sounds, photography), this film meets the highest standards. The music is very good, and extremely epic when it needs to be. (For music nerds: however, I think it's a shame that the new main theme doesn't resolve, it just repeats and then ends in a punched-out major chord. The optimism of the Trek philosophy demands a satisfying resolution to the main theme! Also, the brass playing occasionally sounded a bit coarse.)

Unless they really jump the shark, I think the next film should be pretty good too.

3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.

3471986,5,B001AVCFJM,"Okay, as a movie-goer, I remembered the talk about the Star Trek series becoming increasingly stale, which was partially justified with the 2002 installment that was ""Star Trek: Nemesis"". I did enjoy the movie despite how stale the series had become but knew it was the final movie featuring Patrick Stewert, Jonathan Frankes, etc from the ""Next Generation"" saga. I had pretty much felt that it was the end.

Scroll ahead to 2009, and seamingly an entire, era later, news arises of an 11th Star Trek and felt it was worth checking out. I had no idea for the fun adventure that was about to occur. In addition, the franchise undergoes a complete makeover and a whole new cast comes in to usher in a completely new era for the series. So great is this movie that at age 27, I've finally become a Trekkie at last!

 (SPOILERS AHEAD)

 It is star date 2233 and a Federation Starship called U.S.S. Kelvin investigates an apparant lightning storm in space. Lead by Captain Polau, the Kelvin watches a black hole with a lightning storm around it when suddenly, a large, squid-like ship emerges from the black hole. Dwarfed by the mysterious ship, the Kelvin slowly approaches it when all of a sudden, the crew suddenly realize that weapons are locked on them and are fired upon the Kelvin. The rest is history...

 If there is one perfect thing about this movie, I would say it was Zachary Quinto playing Spock. I was amazed at how well Quinto actually plays Spock, literally spot on. I don't know how they did it but if there was a perfect actor/actress role for any movie, this was it.

 If all the Star Trek movies I've seen, I'd rank this as among my favorites, if not my favorite of all time. Definately recommended.",1269388800,,1714,4.57516339869281

I would have given it a five star except that when
 I purchased the disc's it was suppose to come
 with a model of the enterprise. I contacted amazon
and they informed me that they were out of them.
Although that was not a deal breaker, It would
have been nice to know they were out. So if it shows

3471991,4,B001AVCFJM,This movie look exceptionally good on blu ray. the colors are vivid and bright and the sound is crisp and clear. there are over 3 hours of extra features on the second disk. there is also a demo game for star trek on the third disk. The demo game was a waste of time not worth playing. Acting was excellent and the story kept pace and didn't get boring. Tyler perry was an admiral in this movie and he made me wanna puke but he only had about 5 minutes in the film so it wasn't too bad; at least they didn't give him a starring role elese i wouldn't have bothered to buy the film. Overall the director did an excellent job on the movie and I'm waiting for star trek 2 (hopefully Tyler Perry won't be in another star trek movie)!,1269129600,,728,4.0979020979020975
3471992,5,B001AVCFJM,"I have been a Star Trek fan most of my life. I can honestly say this movie was probably one of the best (If not the best) Treks I've ever seen! I can't wait for the DVD to come out. What's more I can't wait for the sequel! and it looks very likely that their will be a sequel. And with a movie this good, you can't expect anything other than the huge success it's enjoying!

The things that made it great where: The story was fantastic, people who weren't already fans of Trek could really get into it, it wasn't hard to understand, but it was still very intelligent. The music was superb! it gave it a very grand and exciting feeling! The effects where top of the line, and just plain brilliant! The humor gave it a more personal quality, so it didn't feel as stiff as it could have been. And the acting was top-notch. They really hit the nail on the head by picking the unknown Chris Pine to play James Kirk. Not only does he look like William Shatner did when he first started playing Kirk, but his acting was exceptional. And there was Zachary Quinto, he did the part of Spock so much justice, it's hard to see anyone else play him. And there was the surprise appearance of Leonard Nimoy (the original Spock) playing Older Spock. He really tied the story together. And not to forget, there was also the wonderful performances of Zoe Saldana, Anton Yelchin, John Cho, Karl Urban, and Eric Bana. Also the children that played Kid Kirk (Jimmy Bennett) and Kid Spock (Jacob Kogan) gave masterful performances for the short background story parts they where tasked with.

So that is why I say this movie was a triumph in every way! Not just as a Star Trek film but as any film! I give this movie a 10 out if 10! If they'd let me I'd give it a 20 out of 10!!!",1269129600,,1757,4.25748502994012

3471997,3,B001AVCFJM,"The special effects are a strong point of the movie and they do their best to not let up on the action.  I give this part a 5 star.  Watching even the opening sequence of the battle with the USS Kelvin and seeing the startship unleash all that firepower was a plus.  It definitely wasn't old series with a pair of phaser beams.

The acting gets a three star from me.  I liked the ""chip on his shoulder"" Kirk.  He was suitably brash.  Spock alternated between being a wooden puppet and then a drama queen.  It's like they tried to do too much with his character over the course of the movie.  McCoy was a hoot, probably the most true to the original character.  Sulu, Chekov, and Scotty were underutilized and mostly window dressing.  Uhura was portrayed well.

The plot gets a whopping 2 stars.  Along the lines of Independence Day and stories along the same line, you should just watch the movie and not try to think too much about it.  A time traveling divergent reboot opens up a whole can of worms.  It's easy to see why they chose the deleted scenes for deletion.  They would have made the plot even
more difficult to stomach.

The screenwriters went out of their way to ensure that all the main characters were ""special.""  Things like Chekov leaving the bridge to run down to the transporter room when there is an enemy ship right in front of them or the rapid promotion of Kirk, Spock, and everyone else from cadets to command staff.  (I believe he had the con at that time.)  I won't go into all the major plot spoilers and plot holes, I'm sure you could go to the 1 and 2 star reviews for that, but suffice to say there are many.

On the positive side, it is uptempo and doesn't stop the action so someone can monologue about the morality of thier predicament.  The director just keeps the action rolling.

So, if you're looking for a roller coaster ride with lots of things blowing up and everyone jockeying to get in everyone else's face, you'll enjoy the movie.  If you want a deep plot go elsewhere.",1268870400,,2012,4.390243902439025

This was a great script, with great actors, and it just brought me back in time.  Chris Pine was superb as Kirk, Karl Urban nailed McCoy, and Zachary Quinto was a compelling Spock, although the 'human side' was more of a departure from the series.  I'm ready for that to be explored, however.  I'm sure some devotees would disagree, but I think this movie did it right by capturing the essence of the characters, but not copying them.

3472007,5,B001AVCFJM,"Reinventing Star Trek, a much adored franchise by all of its dedicated fans, was a brave move to make and one that few had ever dared and J.J. Abrams finally took the dream to the next step. Abrams, producer of the much loved Lost TV show seems to be the next big name in the moviemaking business and is truly a man with great talent. His last film, Cloverfield, was a massive blockbuster success and this, regardless of actual story quality, was bound to achieve the same. Luckily, this wasn't just an SFX bonanza with little substance. It had a story you could enjoy and actors that understood and appreciated the characters they were portraying. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto take on the most important roles as both Spock and Captain James T. Kirk, yet they play the roles with ease and affection and will undoubtedly take the roles into new and special areas.

Established in an alternate reality through the medium of black holes, it must first be explained that this isn't a movie that follows any of the major continuity of the original series. This gives the writers the freedom to mess with the timeline as much as they want without upsetting the die hard Trek fans too much, although I'm sure they'll be upset by something. The story follows a renegade Romulan, Nero on a quest to get his revenge against Spock (not the young Spock, future Spock) for the destruction of his homeworld by a supernova which he blames on Spock. The revenge which he will get is by destroying Vulcan and then moving on to destroy Earth when he's done. This also follows the formation of the Enterprise crew as its pending Captain, James T. Kirk as they progress through Starfleet academy and move into space.

The overall plot itself is, admittedly, quite basic, but it's the characters and the actors that play them which make the movie worthwhile. Chris Pine as the arrogant James T. Kirk seem the perfect fit as Pine approaches the character with a youthful ambition to succeed but a reckless mind that is easily sidetracked. Zachary Quinto took on the role that would undoubtedly draw the most criticism had it been played wrong, but thankfully portrayed Spock with a confidence befitting of the character itself. He expresses the perfect balance of emotion and logic that you would expect from the half human, half Vulcan character. There was not just pressure on Quinto because he was playing the much loved character, but also he was acting alongside the man who played the original character, Leonard Nimoy. The co-stars of Karl Urban as `Bones' McCoy, Zoey Saldana as Uhura, Simon Pegg as Scotty and John Cho as Sulu do well in their respective roles. Anton Yelchin as Pavel Checkov, however, does considerably well in mimicking the accent of the original character but adds a fresh charm to it as his role progresses through the latter half of the picture. Eric Bana is bland and forgettable as the antagonist of the film which is a disappointment as Bana can really make a role his own when he wants to, but he struggled with this which is a shame.

The look of the film, as you would expect from an Abrams film is superb. It's a slick looking film, and as you would expect, presents the futuristic atmosphere perfectly. They remain generally loyal to the overall look of the Star Trek universe when it comes to the diversity of the Alien races, the uniforms, ships and weapons. The new film has even managed to recreate some of the subtle humour familiar with the original series, along with the infamous redshirt character dying which was something quite familiar in the old series. Overall Abrams has done well. It's been a welcome reboot to what some may have considered a dying franchise, but there is one downside to this new Star Trek franchise and that is it may have been made too big, too epic to make a return to the small screen for a reboot series. If the movie cast could be drawn in to star in a series, then there's no doubt that it would be a huge success, especially if Abrams were at the helm. However, that is very unlikely and I do think that with this movie, we have seen the last of the great Star Trek series'. An impressive film with some amazing special effects and a young, talented cast which cannot go wrong with any film fan.

It's only logical that you should witness it first hand.",1268092800,,4314,4.620599739243807

The film was well paced with plenty of action and beautiful visuals.  They managed to get in each character's catch phrase without it sounding overly corny and it was great to find out the origin of McCoy's ""Bones"" nickname.

The plot was engaging.  It did include time travel, which normally is a mistake, but if you get past the general problems with going back in time, they didn't try to do any crazy paradox stuff.  The time travel was actually a very important plot device because it allowed the writers to play around with the history of the characters a bit.  It begins with a series of scenes that illustrate formative events in the lives of Kirk and Spock.  Once the film begins, they weave character development into the overall plot and I think that's what really makes the movie great - we get invested in the Kirk and Spock characters.

3472027,5,B001AVCFJM,"There are several generations of Star-Trek fans out there and based on their refusal to 'Grow Up' will in all likelihood be more. Those of us who enjoy the original series and perhaps a couple of the movies, realize that despite all the effort to replicate the original dream, directors will never please everyone. This newest film entitled "" Star Trek "" is reasonably better than others in that the new cast is well selected. In this offering we have Bruce Greenwood as Captain Christopher Pike, the original Captain of the Enterprise. (Superior selection.) Chris Pine plays the young James T. Kirk, who is full of vim, vigor and enthusiasm. Zachary Quinto plays the early Spock, full of expectation, promise and definitely logical for the role. Karl Urban plays the erasable Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy. It seems they select the right man as he fits reluctantly into his role. Simon Pegg plays engineer, Montgomery Scott well and believable and I believe, James Doohan would have agreed. John Cho is the youthful Lt. Hikaru Sulu, the pilot and portrays him very and observably masculine. One wonders why? The navigator is the very young Russian Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin) Based on his performance, very believable. Then we have eye-candy Zoe Saldana as Communication's officer Nyota Uhura. Her 'brief tease' and wondrous appearance in this film is not only attractive, vivacious, but forcefully sexy. What is unexpected is her apparent love interest which will conjure up a bagful of mixed images in the sequel. After the introduction of Eric Bana as the heavy, Ben Cross as Sarek, we are further treated to special guest appearance by Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime. The film is loaded with magnificent action scenes, hurtling explosive crafts, photon blasts and violently exploding worlds. In addition, the inter-dimensional space-time travel and encounters with gigantic Black Holes will have the audience gasping and wanting more. Excellent film and a worthy addition to Gene Roddenberry's dream. ****",1267228800,,2005,5.153374233128834
3472028,5,B001AVCFJM,"I'm late getting my opinion about last year's ""Trek"" film out there, but having watched the DVD last night for the second time, I had to admit it. This re-boot, as I've seen it called, accomplishes an amazing feat. It takes an almost fifty year old show that's suffered diminishing returns and reviews over the years at the hands of Paramount bean-counters and cheesy actors (and sets) and somehow makes it all fresh again. We have to take a brief trip back to see just how big this leap forward was...

To me, ""Star Trek V"" was the movie's body slam to the whole franchise, and all I can say for the sixth film is that at least it gave the crew a more noble chance to sign off with some grace. Then anything resembling the sense of wonder and exploration and camaraderie was lost amid the ""Next Generation"" political correctness, with ham came from Ryker, and cheese from Jordi's glasses and the nauseating Wil Wheaton.. The Trek I knew as a wide eyed six year old was gone. Dead. While ""Voyager"" could be amazing in it's fusion of intellect and last-seasons action under the terrific Mulgrew, ""Enterprise"" seemed to be playing to an empty living room. Fans had moved outside into the sunlight and fresh air.

Until now. ""Star Trek 2009"" needed some new blood and fresh meat. It proves to us that the characters themselves, while associated with the original actors, are not irreversibly tied after all. Think of them as coloring book characters-- all another actor has to do is stay within the lines, and they can still work. Zoe Saldana gives Uhura the moxie and charm that Nichols rarely got the opportunity to showcase, and Pine reeks of swagger and passion that Shatner long ago abandoned. Quinto brings new life to the inner conflict that once defined Spock, and Urban should have received some kind of award nomination...somewhere De Kelley is smiling. As much as Pegg brought a smile with Scotty's familiar brogue, his character was more comedic, and was overwritten, as if to make up for not being introduced with the others.

The plot almost has to involve time-travel, and I won't put spoilers here just because it's been out for a while. There are a couple of holes you could drive a truck through but thats the peril of time travel stories, and it still proves a powerful enough- if flawed- tool to move the 60's idealism into today's post-Bush hopefulness.

My feelings for this movie can be summed up in one scene..Cho, as Sulu, is navigating the Enterprise to a tricky post-warp vantage point within the clouds of Titan near Saturn. We see, in an almost ""Ten Commandments"" worthy moment of music and effects, the ship rise from the clouds, strong and capable and ready to carry out its mission. I admit it-- I got a chill of giddiness and second childhood, and something else. Pride? How can one be proud of a fictional vessel, a computer-generated image? That's when I knew....Abrams did the impossible. ""Trek"", and all the lofty things it represented under all that plywood and polyester, was alive again. We're later treated to seeing her again in something she peculiarly has been denied until now; true full-throttle battle kickass.

I guess all I can say after all that is thanks, Mr. Abrams. I loved ""Trek"" as much as I hate ""Lost"", And that says a lot.",1267142400,2,3277,4.682291666666667

3472036,5,B001AVCFJM,"Before I get started with this review I feel it is necessary to state my experience with this infamous franchise.  In no way am I, or have I ever been a ""Trekkie,"" though I have occasionally watched the various Star Trek television series when they've been on, but not to the point where I'd place myself amongst its fans.  I've always admired the series from a distance, enjoying such movies as Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek VIII: First Contact (1996), but I've never really gone past those critically acclaimed gems.

Now that my history with the Star Trek franchise is out there I'll state what I have to say on the newest entry; a reinvention of the original TV series for a new generation.  My opinion:  I LOVE this movie!  Completely and unabashedly I will say for non-Trek fans this is by far the best film the franchise has ever had to offer.  It's just that good.  Not only is it the best movie of the 2009 Summer season it is one of the best space-opera styled films of the decade.

How did Hollywood manage to actually revise a classic series properly?  With years of ""re-imagining"" and remakes Hollywood has finally done one right!  This movie (from what I know) has all I've come to expect from a Star Trek film while at the same time upping the ante of the classic Space Opera to finally transcend its TV roots and enter the foray of cinema.

Star Trek is a free flying joyride that soars above its competitors!  J.J. Abrams has brought Star Trek to everyone outside its loyal fans while retaining what makes Star Trek Star Trek.  Everything about this movie is well-crafted.  The visual effects are perfect, the casting is perfect - everyone in this film truly put in a great deal of effort to bring Trek to a new generation and it shows.",1266364800,2,1769,4.4672897196261685
3472037,3,B001AVCFJM,"You know having watched the whole original tv series every night I could when I was younger and always being a fan of the Original group only, this movie kind of ruined things for me the way LOTR did.  I had read LOTR many, many times and even thought I enjoyed the movie, once they brought the books to life, my own personal in my head ideas of what things were was ruined. Now if I read the books I can't get movie scenes out of my head.  Well the same thing has occured here in a way. I didn't want to know how they all got together really. It didn't matter to me. I knew they would mess it up, but at least there was not as much background info available from a TV series as there was in LOTR books.  Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie, Blu Ray or not, but now what do they do ?  And they are right, Spock was supposedly ahead of Kirk in the academy am I correct ?  Why was he a Commander and Kirk a Captain ? and thats not counting the other people. I have all the original series and movies with the original group on DVD. I see no reason to add this to my collection. If my wife buys it as a gift I'll take it but I won't buy it myself.  Now I did recently get a 4 disc Blu Ray of Bladerunner with the original theatrical release.  Now that is good stuff.
 If you are into  that Blu Ray stop and pause and rewind stuff to see things, then maybe you are not really a movie fan.  Blu Ray is nice and I like it but no, no, no do not stop the movie to pick it apart for good or bad.",1266278400,2,1489,3.8051948051948052
3472038,5,B001AVCFJM,"The latest genesis of the Star Trek franchise is a great stand-alone movie that pays its respect to the ""product"" that proceeded it.  This ""Star Trek"" was definitely created with the goal of drawing in a younger audience without offending the thousands of Trekkies who grew up with the show.  As one of those original fans of the 60s television show, I can say without hesitation that I thoroughly enjoyed the ""rewrite"" of the Star Trek Mythology and found the movie to be a blast.  The special effects were outstanding, the sound quality was wonderful, and the actors (even though faced with an almost impossible task of playing roles so well-known that they're become iconic), all succeeded in making the film work quite well.

In thinking about the task that faced these young actors I really am quite impressed that they were able to pull off their portrayals so well.  They made it easy for the viewer to forget that in addition to playing their role assigned to the film, they also had to play the actor who played the role in the original series.

Oh sure...there are some liberties taken with the film. (Vulcan, for one, is surely treated roughly.)  (Spock and Uhura?  Who'd thought it?)  All in all though, the film is true to the series and has included a great cameo by an old friend.

The Blu-ray version of this film has plenty of extras and will keep the viewer busy looking over deleted scenes, getting a great close-up tour of the Enterprise, plus the 30 ""behind-the-scenes"" featurettes.  There's really nothing not to like about ""Star Trek"" and the Blu-ray extras.  I give the whole package a whole-hearted, ""Live Long and Prosper""!",1266192000,2,1649,4.747368421052632
3472039,5,B001AVCFJM,"I bought this Blu-ray knowing full well I'd enjoy it because I'm a pretty big dork. I didn't see it in theaters, and I've seen no more than 3 episodes of the original series (or any other generation), yet I blindly went ahead and bought it. Once again, I proved that I know myself all too well.

I loved this movie. I could go on about what makes this film so entertaining, but I'm sure it's already been said much more eloquently than I ever could. Basically, it's highly entertaining and fully accessible for people who aren't even fans of Science Fiction, never mind Star Trek. At its core, it's a fun, exhilarating film that's sure to bring in a whole mess of new fans. Including me.

Now, about the Blu-ray. Ever since watching all 9 or so hours of bonus footage provided with the Lord of the Rings Extended Edition DVDs, I've become very spoiled and hard to please with it comes to Behind the Scenes content. The bonus footage on this Blu-ray is easily the best I've seen since. Pretty much everything you'd ever want is included here, with over 3 hours of footage. This means ACTUAL FOOTAGE; none of that slide-show-put-to-music BS. And it's all in high definition! Quite honestly, it's the perfect package.

3472045,4,B001AVCFJM,"Star Trek is very difficult to review, as it is on its own merits an excellent movie.  Very entertaining, good action, great characters, and is one of those great summer movies.  As such, I highly recommend it to movie goers.  However, as a star trek fan there's quite a few issues.  For instance (spoilers) has there ever been a star trek story where the plot involved someone going back in time and negatively altering history, where the crew didn't go back in time to fix it?  I mean, First Contact, City on the Edge of Forever, Yesterday's enterprise, the list goes on and on.  Here, they destroy the whole vulcan world, and decide just to stay in this altered timeline?  (END SPOILERS)  Also, the characters in some cases are very different.  Scotty wasn't really a silly crazy guy, but a respectable officer, and very capable.  Others are slightly different, but that's most likely a result of age, not the performances.  As such, the movie is very well made, but feels less like a star trek, and more like a great sci-fi movie.  I very much recommend watching this movie, but note that if you're a long time star trek fan, you're going to have some issues with it.",1266019200,,1171,4.576923076923077

I always kind of wondered about the backgrounds of the original characters, like how Kirk became the Captain of the Enterprise and stuff like that. And like how Bones is the only one who ever called Captain Kirk ""Jim"", like they were friends. I mean, if you think about it, the TV serious started out with them just floating in space already. This movie did a great job filling in those gaps for me.

The plot and storyline of the movie was very well written, it was well directed and the acting was very believable. And that time travel continuum concept was kind of cool too, along with excellent CG (Computer Graphics).

This movie held my complete attention all the way through, from beginning to end. It is honestly the best movie I have ever seen so far.",1265846400,2,914,4.396449704142012

3472055,5,B001AVCFJM,"Ever since Gene Roddenberry came up with the original Star Trek television show, there have been fans of the captain and crew of the Starship Enterprise, and they seem to multiply with every new film based on the series. This latest is obviously the start of a whole new series (hence the subtitle), that goes all the way back to when the crew first formed. Fans of the TV show will love comparing these new, young Enterprise crew members with their originals. There are enough of the hallmark idiosyncrasies sprinkled throughout to give even a casual fan delight.

My favorite character, though, is not one of the crew members of the Enterprise, but Eric Bana as the Romulan leader, Nero. His has the advantage of being a new character, which he uses very well. The crew members, on the other hand, have the burden of filling the shoes of those very famous predecessors, which is not easy. The one that does it most successfully, I think, is Karl Urban as Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy. The others have issues that are partly their fault, but also partly that of the writers and director.

It starts out gangbusters with the birth of James T. Kirk, and the almost simultaneous death of his father, a starship commander who gives his life to save his crew, wife and child. This scene shows us where the younger Kirk gets his maverick leadership style, as well as sets the stage for a Romulan attack when James T. is grown. From there, we alternate between the development Kirk and that of Spock.

As a Vulcan youth, Spock is being teased and insulted by his fellows for his earthly mother, and loses his temper in a very un-Spock-like fashion. The adolescent Kirt is being chased down by a cop for racing his step father's vintage Mustang convertible, and almost loses his life in the process. Later we see Spock as a young man, played by Zachary Quinto, giving up the Vulcan Science Academy for a career in Starfleet - also because of an emotional provocation. Kirk as a young man, played by Chris Pine, takes on some starship crewmen in a bar when he tries to pick up Lt. Uhura (Zoe Saldana), and as a result is recruited into Starfleet by an old family friend, Captain Christopher Pike, played by Bruce Greenwood. Greenwood is, in my opinion, one of the better casting decisions, and gives one of the best performances in the film. He actually seems like a starship commander, whereas Pine never quite makes the transition - nor does Quinto as Spock, for that matter.

How Spock and Kirk end up on the Enterprise is vague and questionable, to say the least. Nothing in the film seems to follow military protocol, whereas in the original television series, they do. As a matter of fact, writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman seem to be totally ignorant of military protocol, so that by the time all the original characters are on the bridge, you're wondering when the grown-ups are going to show up and establish some order. But I have to say that, while this is probably the weakest aspect of the film, it is not very consequential in this first installment. It may be later, so I hope they gain some discipline by the next one.

The best part of Star Trek are the introductions of the main characters. Old fans will love it. Dr. Bones McCoy (Karl Urban) is the most enjoyable of the crew, in my opinion, and turns out to be the best character and actor throughout. He almost steals the show with his caustic but good natured personality. Chekov (Anton Yelchin), who delightfully butchers all references to the Vulcans with his thick Russian accent, and Scotty, who amazes even himself with his engineering feats, are both fun. But the heavy, if there is one, is Eric Bana as Nero, the Romulan leader. As with almost every other role he's played, Bana is terrific. His makeup is also terrific, but I hate to think how long he had to sit in the makeup chair to get that on.

As far as action, it's non-stop. The best scene is when Kirk, Sulu (John Cho - my least favorite of the main characters) and another officer skydive from space and try to land on a gigantic Romulan drilling rig that is boring a hole into the core of Vulcan in order to destroy it. The photography, special effects and stunts are phenomenal. My other favorite scene is the final showdown on the Romulan vessel.

This truly is a great kickoff to a strong future series. But there are a few problems I think the producers will need to iron out if it is to be the best it can be. I mentioned the military protocol issue. There's also the issue of James T. Kirk. While I think Chris Pine certainly has the chutzpah for Kirk, he lacks the finesse and polish. He's too rough around the edges, and I don't see that disappearing with maturity. I know that finesse and polish are part and parcel of William Shatner, but Shatner defined the role, as did Nemoy the role of Spock, and that has to be respected.

Which brings me to Spock: a love affair with Lt. Uhura? I don't think so. There is no precedent, that I am aware of, for that. It is, as Spock would say, highly illogical and most improbable. Which may be why the filmmakers went there, but it leaves no where for the Spock character to go in future episodes. If you plum his humanity in the first film, that's it for him. You have to leave some kind of mystery to Spock, who is, and should be, the most mysterious of all the characters.

Star Trek is great entertainment. I'm presently reading Starman Jones by Robert A. Heinlein, and can see in it where both Star Trek and Star Wars got their inspiration. Heinlein defined the space genre, which is strange considering how few of his novels have been made into motion pictures. The only ones I am aware of are Red Planet and Starship Troopers. I'm surprised Starman Jones and Stranger In A Strange Land haven't hit the big screen, as they are both naturals. It seems filmmakers are content to continue rehashing old formulas than ""to boldly go where no man has gone before,"" as the Starship Enterprise did. They just lack Kirk's chutzpah.

Regarding the movie, it's one of the best star treks yet, as of late the next generation movies were becoming more and more like normal episodes of the tv show and you had to really know who the characters were.  I think this put off many viewers since they simply did not keep up to date with the show.  It's too bad I loved the next generation shows/movies but they really were getting old.

3472060,5,B001AVCFJM,"I will admit that I am a Star trek fan.  I will also be the first to admit that almost all of the previous ""Star Trek"" movies didn't have a tremendous amount to offer non-fans.  This movie is the MAJOR exception.  By any name this is a great action movie.  The 2-hours fly by as you enjoy not just a great Star Trek movie, but a great action movie.  Unlike the other Star Treks, no previous knowledge is required to enjoy this one.  Since the movie is a ""reboot"" the characters are introduced just like they would be in any other movie.  The actors do a superb job of playing their characters.  The pacing is intense and full of great adventure.  The special effects are top notch.  There is a ton of humor and none of it will come off as an ""inside joke"".

For those who were fans of the original series who might have avoided it you don't know what you are missing.  As usual the trio of Kirk, Spock, and Bones get a majority of the face time.  Uhura gets elevated to almost a ""fourth"" member of the trio.  She is given a much more important part than just sitting at communications.  Sulu, Pavel, and Mr. Scott have lesser roles but they are all excellent characters.  Personally, I think Bones should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  He is just that good.

As for the script, the movie starts extremely strong before slowing to the normal "" Rebel without a cause"" scenes including the perfunctory bar fight.  Once past that ten minutes or so the movie jumps to warp speed and rarely slows.  There is one part that I thought was silly but I guess was needed to advance the plot.  I am intentionally trying to be ambiguous because I don't like people ruining important movie parts for me.

To conclude:

Action A
Story  B+
Acting A
Special Effects A
Music A+

This movie completely captures the ""action-western in space"" that Gene Roddenbury had in mind when he first created Star Trek.

It has a hot green chick and I hear the ladies dig Chris, Zach, and Karl); but man did he make a great movie. The Blu-Ray version is awesome. The extras that involve the cast from TOS are really well done.

The only thing about the ""pc / mobile device digital version"" is that you have to download it and get the DRM involved. If apple has taught us anything, it's that DRM is to be avoided at all costs.

At present I don't own a blu ray player and it took some time before I could find one to borrow just to play this movie.
On the 4 star side, the movie itself is very good.  Kirk was just a arrogant as in the TV shows.  The Spock character was less than Vulcan. McCoy was delightful,  Checkov was comical, and Sulu...ever the swashbuckler... well, was Sulu.",1265414400,,524,4.158415841584159

This movie not only gives us a great back story on how the original crew of the USS Enterprise got together, it also ties up a lot of loose ends from the original series.

It was a pure stroke of genius to create an alternate history for the Star Trek universe, opening a wide door to possible sequels, or even a new TV series showing how the universe was changed by the events depicted here.

3472075,5,B001AVCFJM,"I am not a trekkie or trekker, I never have been.  This film successfully took something I had no previous knowledge of and made it ""my thing.""  Star Trek is an amazing reboot that is space-loads of fun and takes itself every bit of seriously.  While being funny and fast-paced, Star Trek reaches to every strong emotion, and by the end I'm thinking ""Why don't movies these days rock like this one?""

The only previous knowledge I had of the early show and movies, was the casting.  Viewing the new film and witnessing how they tackled the casting was very dumbfounding.  The new film crew deserves so much of an applause for getting the best actors possible for these iconic roles.  Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, and all the others that were unfamiliar are now larger than life and put on one of the best shows of 2009.  This became one of the few movies that people returned to see again after a first viewing last year.

What makes this movie so great is the action, comedy, style, pacing, and brilliant script.  I really have no bones to pick with it other than the obsessive flares that pass through the camera in nearly every scene.  Other than that this movie is grade A material that J.J. Abrahms should carry as the pride of his career.  Somehow I doubt they would be able to top it with a sequel, but I'd love them to prove me wrong.  No matter who you are or what you like, this movie will move you in some way.

The rest of the cast did their role to carry this movie, and it was the ""last"" performance of Leonard Nimoy as ""Spock Prime"".  This was also a well thought out way to re-introduce the original series and breath new life into an already explored universe.  This leaves a blank slate for the writers and directors to do with what they like, and managed to do it well enough to appeal to Star Trek fans.  This is one of the best movies to come out of 2009.

I have no idea what they were thinking of but they made a movie so hard on the eyes that they rendered the story meaningless with their jumpy camera work and cheap ""special effects"".

3472090,5,B001AVCFJM,"I grew up watching the original Star Trek, and so approached this movie with great trepidation when it came out in the theatre.  Tampering with the original characters created so brilliantly by  Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley, Takei, Koenig, Nichols, and Doohan was a huge risk.  I went to the movie only because my kids wanted to go, not because I wanted to see it.  To my great surprise, the movie succeeds, and it succeeds big time  Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, and Karl Urban give performances that are not only true to those great characters, but give us something new in them: the dimension of youth.  They aren't just Kirk, Spock, & McCoy, but what you'd think they'd be 15 (earth) years earlier.  And I don't at all mean appearance.  It's how they talk, behave, and think that rings true.  Of all of them, Urban is especially on the mark. His youngish McCoy is not just a wonder to watch, but just plain fun.  Anton Yelchin gives us an enjoyable look at teen-age Chekov, also entirely believable.  True, the character of Sulu is not so memorable here (though not because John Cho's performance is off; he just doesn't have much to work with, plot-wise).  And, also, true, the characters of Uhura and Scotty are arguably the most divergent from the original characters, but they still ""work"" all right in the larger context of the movie.  It's the total movie that works well.  Eric Bana was all right as the bad guy, but the movie is not really about defeating the bad guy.  It's about the characters.

They travel through time righting wrongs that are outside of their written history. Technicaly speaking as neros ship came out of hyperspace a small vessel should have come out next to it tell them they are in the wrong time and pull them unwillingly back to their own time line. though this small craft is a one man craft and the size of a small shuttle craft the 200 years that separate its technology from neros would be more than enough to defet his systems and drag him back to his present.",1264982400,,715,4.335820895522388

This film is a fast, action packed adventure, depicting our heroes as young students entering Star Fleet Academy. We see the rebellious James T. Kirk, Mr. Spock, Leonard McCoy, Uhura, Scotty and the other future crew members of the Enterprise as they grow into their future roles as Star Fleet Officers.

The story itself contains the typical villain who has been caught in a time warp and blames Spock for the loss of his family. In this movie he takes his vengeance on Spock's home planet of Vulcan by destroying it with a devastating weapon.

The young trainees, under the command of Captain Pike, are sent to investigate violations of the neutral zone and are soon engaged with this mysterious villain.

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto do an excellent job as Kirk and Spock. All the cast worked well with one another and Eric Bana was an outstanding villian. This was a very good adventure movie and I recommend it highly. Gene Rodenberry would have loved it.,1264809600,,395,4.5
3472113,5,B001AVCFJM,"There isn't much not to like even for me, someone who has been a fan from the very first episode. It took me a while to warm up the TNG. Deep Space Nine while not exciting provided some cerebral stimulation typical to Roddenberry's goal. Remember the interview, ""Wagon Train to the Stars"". Voyager was OK but too commercial in my estimation. Enterprise was also OK but time slots and cable hurt it from becoming a ""hit"".

Back to this review and movie. The movie was Exciting but not gratuitously so right from the first scene. I thought the casting and characterization was excellent. The story line was very interesting with nice explantions for the ""change"" in timeline and history. It made it easy to see how they could justify new episodes (Movies) which are not necessarily parallel to the original series. re Noonien Singh Khan. Zachary Quinto is making a huge mistake by not reprising the role of Mr Spock for the next movie. Whoever takes on the role next will hopefully make Leonard Nimoy just as proud and reflective.

I will be looking forward to the next release and as long as the makers follow the original premise and keep it thought provoking and exciting the Star Trek brand will last into many more than the 5 year mission first set out. It gave me chills to hear Nimoy recite the words, ""Space the final frontier,,,"". ""Warp 6 Mr Scott, to anywhere out there...""",1264809600,,1381,4.63265306122449

3472115,5,B001AVCFJM,"Several times, Star Trek has exhausted it potential, only to be renewed.  While I enjoyed the first series the most when it came out and watched it for years as reruns, I really got into the Next Generation (after initial resistance).  TNG was not just a re-tread, but a culmination and maturation of themes evident in the first series.

Kirk would blast his way out of a complicated situation, with some cheesy philosophical observations that rang just true enough.  I loved all of it totally, non-critically, to the point that I did not question it until I was middle aged.  It is the best show that I ever knew.  Period.  You got all the great hard sci-fi themes:  time travel, a new kind of empire, wonderful characters in complicated cultures, and technological power pushing the edge of science.  Indeed, not to exaggerate, it informed my intellectual pursuits through college.

Then, I discovered how fabulous TNG was:  rather than military and impetuous, it was studied, disciplined, and diplomatic.  Once again, it synched with my interests:  international relations and institutions, cultures, historical influences, simple alien mystery.  TNG was even better than the original, though emotionally I will always prefer Kirk and Spock,

To me, Deep Space 9 and Voyager seemed like pale attempts to breath life into the series.  As a friend of mine said, ""none of the aliens are interesting.""  I could watch them, but I always felt a ""so what"" in the back of my mind.

So here we are.  I think that this film may be a successful reinvention.  Because of a time warp, an alternate reality is created, complete with two Spocks existing in the same space.  This alters the universe, opening possibilities for an entirely new series, one up to date in ways I can't imagine or articulate.  OK, I though the resoltion of this film was a bit under par, like the origianl TV series a bit impetuous, but the themes work and are pretty deep with fun variation.  Will Spock and Uhura have a love child?  How will Spock's relation with his father change?  What is Kirk like without having grown up with his father?  Fun stuff for the greatest (and most profitable) franchise hollywood ever created.  THe best thing about it is that you can re-watch it multiple times - there are uncountable in-jokes, subtle allusions, and so many new avenues opened up.  Finally, it has a pace of action that brings it to Star Wars levels, with absolutely fabulous special effects.

Recommended?  Yeah.",1264809600,,2482,4.84047619047619
3472116,5,B001AVCFJM,"I do not even know how to describe the greatness that is this movie. I watched it three times in theaters and honestly it probably is BEST in theaters. All the sounds and actions and everything wow. But it looks great anywhere. I like this new concept of remaking Star Trek and do hope the next one is an original story kind of like this one was. All the characters picked are PERFECT. Really...the director knew what he was doing. I know I hear a lot of beef coming from old school Trekkies who are saying how this is not like the original and it's blasphemous blah blah. This movie is meant to appeal to the NEW generations. I hardly think of the new people as the old people. These are all new characters who happen to have been inspired by the original Star Trek. And it works.

The only problem I had with the whole entire movie was Uhura being Spock's love interest. Doesn't really make sense. I also do not see why she was put on this cover since the main theme of this movie is the tension and forming friendship between Kirk and Spock. I personally believe she was put there as an object to deter people from imagining a sexual tension between the Captain and his First Officer heh.

The Next Generation show was pretty good but wore on me quickly. Let's face it, Shatner is an over-actor. This movie scores high marks from story, to effects, to action and to casting. Pine (Kirk), Quinto (Spock) and Urban (McKoy) take the original characters to new heights. They keep the essence of them and expand like good actors should. In addition, the casting of Bruce Greenwood as Captain Pike was outstanding. If you never liked Star Trek before, you will now! Some Trekkies are still probably crying. Excellent movie!

NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: I had the luxury of watching the DVD, watching the DVD on a Blu-Ray player and finally watching the Blu-Ray. It went from COOL, to NICE, to HOLY CRAP THAT LOOKS AWESOME!

3472127,5,B001AVCFJM,"The movie itself is simply excellent, and I think that's been well-covered by the other writers, so I'll write about my opinion that the 2-disc edition is preferable to the single-disk edition.

The 2-disk edition comes with the deleted scenes, and one never knows for any tv & film product whether the DVD scenes will be worth anything. I would say that the deleted scenes add to the story, and as they do not contradict the story I would consider them canon.

There are three sets of deleted scenes:
1) Spock and Kirk as children
2) Nero on the Klingon present planet
3) Kirk and the green woman.

Spoilers below.

Of those 3, I'd say they add to the story in that order. With the green woman, we learn Kirk was just using her to get her help to cheat on the Kobayashi test. In the case of Nero, it was merely cool to see. The CGI on these scenes is unfinished. Right after the Kelvin crashes into the Narada, the Narada ends up heavily damaged and is surrounded by about 30 Klingon ships. They surrender, following this Nero ends up on a Klingon prison planet, from which he escapes, a plot twist I find unebelievable.

It is the childhood scenes that really shine. We learn why Kirk was driving that car off the cliff, it's not because he's a young maniac. We see his stepdad treat his older brother like garbage, and then his older brother tells him that car doesn't really belong to their stepdad, but to their real dad. He drives the car off the cliff out of a sense of righteousness.

Spock's childhood scenes... can you say awesome? It seems most of Winona Ryder's screen time was eliminated. We have Spock's birth scene. We have a scene of Spock's mother and father arguing after Spock got into a fight. It brings life to Spock's mother, and I wonder if Spock's mother's death would have been as much of a tear jerker as Kirk's father's death had these scenes been included in a seamless manner.",1264550400,,1905,4.459770114942529

Forget what you know about Vulcan or Khan or Genesis. It's all new. And yet the old remains in the mind of the very old.
The million dollar bonus should go to the Casting Director,who put though and knowledge into each character,casted as a young person.
It is creepy until you get used to it.
For you non Trek fans remember this. If you know nothing about anything Star Trek it does not matter. This is one rocking popcorn chewing movie. For the many.
One line in the movie ""Star Trek:Insurrection"" always says it best. When accosted by protocol and appointments and diplomatic engagements,Picard turns to his crewmates and asks,""Does anybody remember when we were explorers?""

3472133,4,B001AVCFJM,"This was an entertaining movie. It had good action and special effects and it wasn't boring. It also had some humor. I liked that it had a fast pace and a lot of twists and turns in the plot. OK so the plot doesn't quite make 100% sense but it was still pretty cool. It was also great on a visual level. The actors did manage to capture some of the essence of the original characters. I must say too the actors were a good fit as far as physical likeness and personality, particularly Spock.

I will give a star for being original and one more just because the movie was better than I expected and an improvement over previous, more forgettable Star Trek movies. It had a few ""What the...??"" moments but there were also many redeeming qualities. When I read the reviews, I honestly thought this would suck but I was pleasantly surprised.

I guess the writers of this figured if they were going to do another Star Trek movie, they would do something totally crazy and far out. The plot involves time travel and an alternate universe...one where Spock and Uhura make out...Here is where the movie loses a star. Kirk or Bones I would understand, but SPOCK? C'mon, gimmie a break! Anyone who is a fan of the old Star Trek shows knows that Uhura would never go for Spock! Besides, Kirk always gets the chicks! Not to mention, anyone who is a fan of the original series already knows Vulcans only mate every 7 years! Oh well, this movie does take place in an alternate universe...and in this case it is VERY alternate one! Still though, this was a fun movie and I did enjoy it!",1264550400,,1571,4.3951890034364265
3472134,4,B001AVCFJM,"Like I wrote in the title, I gave this item 4 stars because, in my opinion, the plotline is very similar to the one in ""Star Trek - Nemesis"". Romulan Antagonist, controlling a vessel with superior firepower, etc. I know a lot of trekkies out there who would have wanted an antagonist to be a bit more colorful and with more depth to his character than the one played by Eric Bana. Enough about cons, let's move to the pros!
Star Trek was given a new light in this movie. The main protagonists from TOS are all here, but yet, somehow it all seems fresh, as if it's 1966 again and we're getting to know the crew of the Earth's flagship in a very profound and original way. I used to think of the Enterprise crew as a group of professionals assigned to the ship by a comission which picked the best people for the job and that was it. But the writers of the screenplay question that, because Gene Rodenberry (the creator of the Star Trek franchise) never never really explained how did the crew of NCC-1701 come together. So I find this part of the movie very interesting, and helpful, I might add.
About the special effects - awesome! Keep'em comin'.
Special effects in this movie remind me of those from Battlestar Galactica, but I think its just me. Btw, love the new going-into-warp-blast sound. I think it's LOGICAL.
Acting - hm, the cast, in my opinion, is a solid one, and I wanna use this chance to defend Chris Pine (Kirk) who was attacked by some critics that didn't like HIS acting. I think that mr. Pine, given the great responsability of trying to fit Shatner's shoes, did a great job. He created a new James Tiberius Kirk, bold and stubborn as the old one, but in his own way. Don't forget that the New Kirk grew up WITHOUT a father figure. I think it counts. I give Qiunto also 5 stars for Spock.

3472135,5,B001AVCFJM,"The movie is riveting and holds strong all the elements of the original Star Trek series and movies.  It begins with an attack of an amazing outside-the-box Romulan Ship with a tattooed seethingly evil Captain Nero (Eric Bana).

After the attack, one of the survivors, the infant James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is shown as a wild risk taker growing up in Iowa.  He rides wild clunker cars and has no fear.  Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) meets Kirk as an adult and recommends that he join the Starfleet.  This gives him the opportunity to meet Spock (Zachary Quinto) and all the familiar faces in the Star Trek fictional universe.

The cast is top notch and their acting shows they have studied the history of the series.  Character essence flows well and gives great satisfaction - like comfort food for the soul.

3472140,5,B001AVCFJM,"The video arrived in less than 48 hours. It was undamaged and it has performed optimally. Amazon did a great job with delivering the product ordered swiftly.

JJ Abrams did his homework for this film. It is a special effects giant. Even CG effects look real. The film was also excellent from a casting perspective. Except for Scotty, the characters closely resembled those from the original TV series and the early ST films.

Although the movie is a spectacular success, there are a few weaknesses. Eric Bana might have been poorly cast for the villain. He did not seem as evil as the character required. The screenplay was mediocre. It's obvious that the writers had the next movie in mind when they wrote this screenplay. We know, for example, that the planets Vulcan and Romulus exist in the future; yet they were destroyed in this film. One can only assume, therefore, that the next film has already been written and involves time travel or manipulation of the timeline in order to reverse the damage from this one.

Other loose ends include the ""amazing"" explosion that saved the Enterprise at the end, but did not destroy it (and with no warp core, how did they get home?), the amazing ""rescue"" of the Kelvin survivors (why didn't Bana destroy them?), having two Spocks together, but at different ages and how did Bana's character fabricate such a huge and advanced spacecraft, much less stock it with talented officers and crew? The hate-relationship between Nimoy and Bana could have been more deeply explored.

Nevertheless, from the standpoint of cinematography, Star Trek is visually stunning. JJ Abrams is a capable director and, like all Star Trek films, humorous at times. Kirk's character was well developed, including a heart-pounding car theft by Kirk as a child. Kirk is seen as a petulant, angry, bored juvenile, drifting through life without purpose or meaning. One interesting surprise was a romantic relationship between Uhura and the young Spock, which greatly irritated Kirk. Abrams gave us what we expected, even if the screenplay reveals the next movie at the same time. There is plenty of eye candy for Trekkies and this period of time at Starfleet (after Enterprise, yet before the original TV series) was well explored and developed.

3472144,5,B001AVCFJM,"CONTAINS SPOILERS! OK, I loved this, just loved it. And all those people whinning about them 'messing' with the original Star Trek characters and series missed the point. The old story lines are still intact; this is just an alternate time and place in space. This movie has given a shot in the arm to the franchise. But it was lovely to see Leonard Nimoy again (my first 'star' crush!). Will the new cast wipe out the memories of the old? Nah. But they are entertaining. Chris Pine was good but I'm a Spock woman and Zachary Quinto was really good. His first scene as an adult Spock was spooky...he even walked like Nimoy. But he was definitely his 'own' Spock. And he met his match in Uhura. I swear, I ALWAYS thought Spock and Uhura had an attraction for one another. In 'Plato's Stepchildren', when Spock and Kirk were switching seats on the couches just before Kirk pairs up with Uhura, I really thought that it was going to be Spock and Uhura. I remember being disappointed that it wasn't. After all, I don't see any other crew member playing the Vulcan harp. All that time spent together learning it? There has been fan fiction for years about Spock and Uhura (which I didn't discover until after the movie!). That attraction was always there and it was smart of the director to go in that direction. I hope that stays in the new movie yet to come (throw in Nurse Chapel to give it a little tension but keep Spock with Uhura. I never cared for her). Karl Urban was fantastic as Bones. The weakest character was Chekov. The Sulu character (John Cho) was good and also a little hunk in his own right. Bana was Boring. Otherwise, enjoy!",1264118400,,1640,4.47
3472145,5,B001AVCFJM,"I have to say that I felt a little bit mixed when I first heard that they were going to revamp the original Star Trek. 'How can they improve on perfection?' I wondered. I'd put off seeing this in theaters because the purist in me was too afraid of disliking the movie just because it was a remake. A year later, I finally give the movie a chance.

To the fanboys & fangirls out there, give the movie a chance. No, it's not the original Star Trek, but something new & almost as exciting. I'm not going to give a synopsis since there's over a hundred other reviews on here on this DVD alone. I just have to say that I liked what they did with the movie.

I liked that they made this into a separate universe from the original series. (Not really a spoiler since most reviews & promotional material state this.) It gives me a guilt-free way to enjoy the series without making me compare the characters unfavorably. Sure, I still compared the characters but now it could be done in a way that marked how differently they all developed. I chalked up the vastly different personalities to how the alternate universe affected each person individually. An Uhura/Spock pairing wasn't exactly what I would have chosen, but it was interesting.

The only real gripe I'd have with the movie is that they did seem to want to cram as much action into the film as humanly possible. I sat back & enjoyed all of the eye candy, but once in a while I just hungered for something that wasn't *big awesome fight scene* or ""OMG! AN EXPLOSION!!"".

The special effects are incredibly done & I really do wish that I'd seen this in the theaters while I had the chance. My puny tv screen really doesn't do it justice. I also liked the acting, especially by the girl who played Uhura. I loved the original Uhura & this movie made me love the new girl just as much.

Take it from a die-hard fan, this movie rocked. Do I love it more than the old stuff? Nah, I'd still take original Kirk over the new guy, but you can't deny that this film was awesomely done.",1264118400,2,2028,4.3403693931398415

3472150,4,B001AVCFJM,"The most common review I've read of this movie is that is ""a good movie, but against Star Trek canon"".  I'm not a real trekkie, never been to a conference, never asked Shatner for his autograph, but I do own the movies and enjoy watching it on TV.  I don't think this movie is good to the general public and bad to ST fans, but good to the general public and ESPECIALLY good for ST fans.  The common objection is that it is in violation of ST canon.  However, virtually the whole movie occurs in an alternate reality, and alternate realities are commonplace in the ST universe.  While it does differ from what ST fans know, the fact is that this universe is altered with the appearance of the rogue Romulan vessel in the past, which allows different development for the characters.  While the TOS (The Original Series) characters take different storylines, the writers and actors do an outstanding job of maintaining the personalities of these characters.  Also, the film is full of nuances only ST fans will comprehend.  The best example, in my opinion, is when young Kirk meets future Spock in a cave on the ice planet, and Spock introduces himself with the phrase, ""I am, and always shall be, your friend"".  Non-ST fans will probably construe this as a general statement of non-hostility between unknown parties.  ST fans will feel momentarily gut-kicked by this reference.

The film is not wholly bereft of issues, particularly temporal cyclical issues.  If Vulcan truly was destroyed, how would it affect the ST universe?  In particular, since Spock was reborn on Vulcan in Star Trek III, wouldn't this movie preclude itself from happening? More important, how would many of these issues translate to the real world.  Replace Starfleet with the U.S. Navy.  Would an Annapolis cadet be promoted to the Captain of the flagship, even if he did do a good job on one mission?  Of course not.

The best way to enjoy this movie is simply watch it, cast aside any obvious disbelief, and if you're a Star Trek fan, enjoy the subtle nuances your friends don't pick up.",1263945600,,2063,4.717877094972067

3472153,4,B001AVCFJM,"The 2009 version of ""Star Trek"" is a ""re-imagined"" prequel to the famed Gene Roddenberry TV series from the 1960s.  In this outing, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is a hell-raising 23rd Century Iowa farm boy who's tired of living in the shadow of his father, a Starfleet captain who died a hero`s death, sacrificing himself to save the lives of his crew (the infant James and his mother included).  Yet, after just a single pep talk from one Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood), the hotshot Kirk figures it's time to hang up his motorcycle - or the futuristic equivalent thereof - and follow in his hallowed father`s footsteps by becoming a member of Starfleet himself.

Meanwhile, on the planet Vulcan, a young Spock suffers persecution for being half-human on his mother's side and, thus, opts to sign on to become a commander with the Earth-based Federation rather than serve in the Vulcan Science Academy, as any decent, civic-minded Vulcan with his kind of aptitude is expected to do.

Soon, Kirk and the famously emotionless Spock (Zachary Quinto) are serving together on the maiden voyage of the spanking new Starship Enterprise, along with such familiar faces as Bones (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) in their younger years, with Scotty (Simon Pegg) getting a chance to hop aboard later on.  Before they know it, the Enterprise is locked in battle with the Romulans, led by a villain named Nero (Eric Bana), who are trying to make a black hole out of Vulcan, with Earth as their next target.

If none of this sounds particularly familiar even to diehard Trek fans, it's probably because scenarists Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have concocted a time-shifting/alternate-reality version of events that goes against much of what we've previously been told regarding the back story of these characters.  One of the benefits of this approach is that it allows Leonard Nimoy to join in on the proceedings, playing Spock as an older incarnation of himself.

The script has some fun parodying Kirk's reputation for one-upmanship and serial womanizing, but a little of that does go a long way.  Still, the tension that develops between the cocksure Kirk and the similarly adamant Spock (both well played by Pine and Quinto) is nicely balanced against the camaraderie of two equally skilled professionals working at the peak of their abilities in a common cause.

Special kudos go to director J.J. Abrams for the tremendously exciting action sequences he has created for this film, including one amazing scene atop a giant drill platform located miles above the planet`s surface.  No surprise, the art direction, production design and special effects are all first-class, and editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon have assembled all the pieces together for maximum impact.

This latest incarnation is good fun for Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike.",1263772800,,2887,5.042016806722689

3472158,2,B001AVCFJM,"This review is for people considering buying the DVD to view this movie for the _first_ time--an audience I expect to be quite different from those who saw it as a summer blockbuster in the theaters.

At its core, this is a reunion movie, a genre characterized by squeezing together a stream of tributes to the characters and evocative scenes from a franchise.  If this is what you are looking for, there is more than enough to be very satisfying.

However, if you are expecting more, remember that, unlike a sequel/prequel, a reunion movie doesn't attempt to extend the franchise, but simply tries to milk what it sees as a dead one. Consequently, the plot is typically forced to be minimal and/or preposterous by the requirement to stitch together all those tributes.  This movie's dubious innovation is to create the category of ""preunion"" movie.

Compounding the inherent problems of the reunion format, much of what doesn't come from TOS (The Original Series) is ""borrowed"" from elsewhere, and the choices are not particularly good.  For example, the scene where Kirk and Scottie transport into the engine room plays like a magic-gone-awry humorous interlude from a Harry Potter movie.  For example, the Romulan ship seems strangely familiar--misappropriated from another SciFi series/movie of many years ago?  Whatever, the ship's visuals are contrary to the story line.

There is nothing of the spirit of TOS in this movie.  I would not be surprised to learn that director Abrams hadn't seen anything more than a few brief clips and stills from TOS.  The strength and appeal of TOS was that it was science fiction, in contrast to generic action/adventure transplanted into outer space.  This movie rejects those origins: There is no science fiction here. Reportedly, director Abrams dislikes science fiction. His exception for the Star Wars series is consistent because those movies were predominantly high-end sword-and-sorcery epics/adventures, rendered in a high-tech future.

Abram's utter failure to appreciate (be aware of?) TOS and science fiction is most vividly seen in his use of Romulans as generic villains--Romulans were a dramatic vehicle for exploring, via compare-and-contrast to the Vulcans, the potentially large consequences of small changes/choices.

The movie suffers badly from the conflict between the genre and the director's goals.  To be successful, a reunion movie should heavily leverage the audience's knowledge of the series, but Abrams' dislike of, and uninterest in, TOS sacrifices that.  What he leaves himself is the clutter of a laundry list of references to TOS, and this overwhelms his stated goal of ""re-imagining"".  I didn't notice anything another director might want to build upon.

Even divorced from its TOS origins, this movie fails as an action movie .  The plot is light-years beyond willing-suspension-of-disbelief in _all_ of its key attributes. As so many have noted, the villain's course of action is utter nonsense.  Another example, ""red matter"" creates a black hole only if placed in certain locations, for example a planet's core but not on its surface or in a syringe, and that black hole quickly consumes the planet but then suddenly stops growing.

The characters are poorly formulated, but none so much as Kirk.  I watched TOS as a teen and for me that Kirk (Shatner's) as a captain/leader was at the edge of literary-license and suspension-of-disbelief.  No allowances were big enough to accept this Kirk.  He is a brat: arrogant, impulsive, self-involved and self-indulgent.  He might be someone you would find briefly charming in an informal social setting, but not someone you would risk treating as a friend.  Not only is he someone you wouldn't choose as a leader, he is someone you should reject as a follower.

The set design for the Enterprise is eye-candy, but largely irrelevant: It is seen in passing but has no part in the story.  There is no ""Wow, I wish I had one of those!""  The action sequences are well executed _technically_, but they are ""been there, seen that"".  The action is curiously devoid of emotion and uninvolving, probably because I couldn't buy into the circumstances surrounding it.  Surprisingly, the opening sequence which is battle scene that should have been pulse-pounding and adrenalin-drenched starts out a prosaic, predictable ""yet-another..."" but then is interrupted by a protracted, artificial, maudlin element (weepy orchestral background music).  Instead of testosterone, you get estrogen.

You need to put yourself in a special mindset for this movie not to be one long sequence of ""Seen that"" and ""What BS!"" (or ""most illogical"" if a Trekkie).",1263686400,6,4653,5.194369973190349

Character selection was spot on. I had no trouble seeing each of the new cast members as the old ones. As far as I'm concerned casting could not have been better.

The visual effects were great as well. I saw the movie in the theater, but when I bought the blu-ray, I found myself pausing it in certain scenes and thinking... ""man, I don't remember seeing that before.""

3472166,5,B001AVCFJM,"Star Trek has definitely returned with a vengeance, this film not only can attract the hardcore fans (Trekkies) but non-fans as well.  The most interesting fact about the film is that the canon set up in the old Star Trek series isn't changed as the movie takes place in alternate timeline separate from the original series. The cast is phenomenal, if not perfect. Chris Pine is a great Kirk, cocky and ready to fight. Zachary Quinto of Heroes fame is by far my favorite in the film, playing the legendary Spock. The original Spock actor, Leonard Nimoy also makes a appearance as the older Spock (and the original Spock from the original timeline). Simon Pegg of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz also is a spectacular choice for Scotty.

The film is basically a Star Trek version of the original Star Wars (A New Hope), it is well-paced and never dull unlike the past Star Trek films and television series which I have great respect for but could get quite boring at times.

3472171,3,B001AVCFJM,"This first time I saw this flick was in a theater and I fell asleep at some point and, upon awakening, understandably couldn't make any sense out of it.  I decided to  give it a second chance on DVD now that I have a large screen at home.  I then picked up on one of the things that bothered me about this picture:  the camera work.  I realized that the cinematographer went out of his way to make it look as if he were using a hand-held camera.  The picture constantly jerks one way and then the other and it's obvious that it's being intentionally done for dramatic effect, which is both pretentious and annoying.  All it accomplishes is to make you aware of the camera when you're supposed be aware of the characters and the story and not the camera.

The choice of players is pretty good.  Kirk portrayed as a little kid comes off as the world's worst brat whose ability to maneuver a car at that age is completely unbelievable.  The story is generally engrossing and the special effects are what you would expect these days.  The pacing of the film makes it resemble a sci-fi version of a Bourne film with no shot lasting more than 1.2 seconds.",1263427200,2,1149,4.372641509433962
3472172,5,B001AVCFJM,"When the advance publicity declared that this was ""not your father's Star Trek""--or, what's more likely, your mother's (my experience with media fandom being that it is dominated by females)--it was spot-on.  From a very early point in the story, as an infant James Kirk comes squalling into the Universe barely seconds before his Starfleet father is killed crashing his crippled and evacuated starship into a Romulan miner, those of us who know the original series, and remember that Kirk had a brother, realize that something we don't yet understand is going on here.  The fatherless Kirk (who apparently acquires a stepfather at an early point) is a wild, rebellious youngster (Chris Pine) who doesn't enter the Starfleet Academy till he's 22, but when he does he makes good on his boast that he'll ace the four-year course in three.  (He also sabotages the Kobiyashi Maru test and meets its designer, a half-Vulcan named Spock (Zachary Quinto), while going through his training side by side with an older and just-divorced cadet, a young medical doctor named Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban), on whom he bestows the nickname of ""Bones.""  Assigned to the new-minted USS Enterprise under Capt. Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood), he almost loses out on the voyage because of his test-diddling, but gets McCoy to smuggle him onboard--and it's a good thing he does.  I won't spoil the story for you by trying to describe the complex and headlong plot, but let's just say Kirk and the viewer are both in for some surprises.

The Malaysian release of this film was subtitled ""The Future Begins,"" and that may well be what its creators had in mind: with the inevitable aging of the original cast (and the deaths of at least two), plus the lack of a current TV entry to the franchise, going back in time may be the best chance Trek has to keep itself in the public eye.  Though Pine doesn't (to me) look very much like a young William Shatner, both Quinto and Urban bear an uncanny resemblance to their original models, and Simon Pegg (Scotty), John Cho (Sulu), and Zoe Saldana (Uhura) were also cast with an eye to the possibility.  The designers of the film have had the good sense to make it look as much as possible like the TV series, but the effects are, of course, about 1000 times better, the action scarcely lets up for a minute, and Michael Giacchino's thunderous music track is absolutely stupendous (don't miss the CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B001Z920NA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>).  At the close we find ourselves wondering whether Kirk and his youthful crew (Anton Yelchin, though he doesn't much resemble Walter Koenig, is a delight as the 17-year-old mathematical whiz kid, helmsman, and Transporter innovater Chekhov) may find a way to go forward in time and change certain aspects of what is now their past.

Secondly, the crew did not come together for some time (McCoy & Chekov were not part of the original crew). MOST of all, Kirk did NOT start his Star Fleet assignment on the Enterprise. You can try to wuss it away by using timeline excuses, but it doesn't wash. Even the Romulans looked like something from the Road Warrior rather than Romulus. On its own, as a sci-fi movie, it was enjoyable and could stand on its own, but as a ""continuation"" (pre-quel), it falls flat. Resistance is not futile!

Let's never mind that it destroys Vulcan, something totally out of sync with everything else in Star Trek, but he makes the characters almost cartoonish in how they act.

All of this great acting talent almost overcomes one of the worst scripts of the past five years but it fails because the script runs like a roller coaster from point to point and there is no point to any of it.  Spock's father, a major figure in his own right, is like a fly on the wall.

3472179,1,B001AVCFJM,"I put Abrams in the same league as Bay.  The new Star Trek creators talk about ""reboot"", ""pace"", ""Star Wars""... I see an edited ""Starship Troopers"".  What made the futuristic Star Trek a ""science-fiction"" versus a fantasy is that it tries to stay true to science and common sense as much as possible and only makes a leap where required.  There are so many things wrong with this ""reboot"" right off the get go almost minute by minute, that it's just painful.  I'll try to just add to what others have already mentioned and not to repeat what have already been said:

--It took the Romulans a couple of minutes to destroy a whole fleet of starships, but took an eternity to destroy one ship that carried Kirk's father, long enough for 800 people to escape by shuttle crafts through presumably one exit--just calculate how many shuttle crafts it takes to carry 5 to 10 people at a time and how much time required for them all to leave 1 shuttle at a time.  Those people who know Star Trek know that a starship such as the Enterprise is lucky to carry a few shuttle crafts.
--Spock, in the mind-meld with Kirk said, ""129 years from now, a star will explode, and threatens to destroy the galaxy"".  Ouch.  And to make Spock, one of the most beloved Trek characters, a science officer no less, say it.  That hurts.
--Isn't it kind of weird that they can drill a giant hole to the center of a planet and no molten lava comes out?  Oh, and those planets that are close enough to the sun to be warm and have a solid core don't have an intact atmosphere either.
--So, they create a black hole at the center of Vulcan.  Yet people, including Spock's human mother, are walking, talking, running around like normal?  And all this time, I thought higher G's make your body heavier, damage your internal organs, that kind of thing.  And we're talking about a black hole where sensors measured gravity that were ""off the scale"".  Same applies to the black hole that was created at the center of the Romulan ship.
--Let's ignore the substance of the magical and deadly red paint for a moment.  I wonder why the elder Spock carried an entire tank of the stuff when all he needed was one drop to destroy the sun.  It's analogous to carrying all the most destructive weapons of all the worlds to do a mission that requires a knife.  But then maybe if things make Vulcan sense, the entire movie's premise would be DOA.
--I wonder why these advanced future races think they can save a planet and its people by destroying the sun via a black hole on its surface.  So many problems with this one scenario, that we don't need the other problems to make it worse.
--Once the Enterprise found itself caught in the black hole's gravity, it ejected the warp core to create an explosion that pushes the Enterprise away from the black hole.  In the world Star Trek created, warp core explosions destroys a starship--not just envelopes the ship then gently pushes it away.  But let's ignore this fantasy for a moment.  What we know about waves such as shock waves or ocean waves, is that when it hits you, it beats you up in your place and move on at its original speed.  In Abrams's world, when a wave hits the ship, it leaves the ship intact and propels the ship forward at even greater speed.

I love the original Trek and have the blu-rays.  It's the original Trek that gave Abrams and Paramount this chance, but neither seems to have any appreciation for the original, other than the chance to exploit its name.  It's unfortunately literal when they talk about ""pulling all the stops"" to make this movie, because they have yanked science and common sense, along with the Star Trek history and replace the creativity required to work within this confine with simple eye-candy.  It makes perfect sense why they love ""pace"" so much.  The ""action"" they use in this movie is just a cheap way for them to cover up their short-comings and total lack of creativity.  Most movie watchers who let down their guards and do not remain alert would simply be oblivious to the fact that they are being bombarded with total b.s.  If this movie is so good that it could stand on its own, they really should have named the characters and the movie something else (like Abrams's World"" for instance), and leave the Enterprise and the ""Star Trek"" name alone, because whatever it is, it's not Star Trek anyways.  But then maybe this reboot means that Paramount is sending out the message to all the Star Trek fans that they don't really care whether any fans would purchase past Star Trek movies or memorabilia now that they have all been made obsolete.  While we're in the rebooting mode, maybe all the studios should consider rebooting the Batman series, Spiderman, X-men (maybe Logan could be a scientist instead of the costume wearing Wolverine) and don't forget Star Wars.  Oh possibilities, and all it takes is a simple leap back in time with a drop of red paint that turns into a black hole that magically let's one travel through time instead of maybe crushing one to a tiny bit.",1263254400,44,5039,4.533701657458564
3472180,3,B001AVCFJM,"first off... I talk too much!:
Before the long wind begins, I will say I did enjoy this film. It did indeed entertain me. The problem always comes with the noisy ruminations of its enthusiastic appreciators. I think that I could get with the prevailing assessment of the ""greatness"" of this film if there was a modicum of respect for the art that came before it. Like battlestar galactica, like star wars, like the recent installments of superman and batman (the slightly older newer batman - being batman begins actually - coming less than a full decade after the old incarnation) the passionate contemporary blows the loudest horn. The words ""Younger"" and ""better"", the word ""sexier"", the ill gotten word ""hipper"" are thrown around as justifications of the product's existence altogether. It's the hip sexiness that makes this new such and such a thousand times better than the old so and so. As if there were any better reason for sprucing up and old car or an old house, than the time honored pursuit of long green! New Money making marketeer barons would have us believe the fairytale that this new re-imagination trend of updating the old was the obligation of the young. It is not, as a matter of fact, to anyone listening, it is not not not! But this is the parlance they use, and no one asks..., yeah but... WHY? Why did it HAVE to happen? It didn't. The suits just thought they could make a buck off something. Yes yes, a built in audience! Excellent marketing savvy there, gentlemen, although if you proceed to change everything in order to make it ""digest-able"" to the A.D.D. in you and me, then aren't they effectively alienating those same supposedly built in devotees? Tis indeed a conundrum!

Hubris:
And how does this attitude of better come into the equation. This is such a throw away society that we have television shows that are dedicated to mocking the times and styles of decades past with amusingly clever video blubs and pop up commentary atop stock footage of Wham or the Beatles or President Kennedy and everyone giggles about hair styles and artsy gimmickry. However they're clearly oblivious to the fact that in time the right now will be the back then, and brand new snotties in hipster gear of tomorrow year will be mocking them just as vehemently and thinking themselves just as clever. Comparing the old Battlestar Galactica or Star trek to the new is ridiculously nave and downright stupid. Of course with the benefit of 20 to 30 years of advancement the look of one thing from now will out shine the lack of gloss of the one thing then. No one looks at photography and says that they're modern Polaroid of their dog, or the digital download of their children in a playground are ""BETTER"" than old picture candids of grandma from 1947, it's the substance of the photo, not the quality of the make of the picture. I mean, That argument would be friggin' stupid, wouldn't it?!!! The special effects are a thousand times better, the look is crisper, the visuals stunning. So let that be written down, we all agree. But sorry kids, I can still separate pretty from nourishing. Just a plain pretty look and nothing much in the story department is the equivalent of empty calories. Something to think about.

About the film itself:
For something so new and improved we sure did manage to roll out the Sci Fi clich machine front and center when we were jotting this three act extravaganza down on paper, didn't we?

MR.BRAIN: Well... first we need a villain, he should be deep and brooding and virtually wordless so we don't have any of those clichd cartoon mustache twisting villain moments.
MR. PINKY: How can we make him menacing if n' he don't talk, though, boss?
MR.BRAIN: Easy, we'll put sinister looking tattoos all over his face and give him nasty looking serrated edged weapons he can use to slay hapless Starfleet officers!
MR. PINKY: Brilliant, sir! What do we call him?
MR.BRAIN: Darth Maul!
MR. PINKY: Uhh, sir? Seriously?
MR.BRAIN: Yeah you're right, that's been taken. Alright well Roddenberry templated the Romulans against the Romans, roll out the list of roman emperors, drop your finger on a name and let's just move on, ANYTHING BUT CAESAR! That's too obvious.
MR. PINKY: Of course, sir.
MR.BRAIN: Now we don't want Darth Maul...
MR. PINKY: Sir?!
MR.BRAIN: I mean Nero, to be one dimensional, do we? So we'll have to give him purpose, alright, I say page two paragraph six of the vile motivations handbook?
MR. PINKY: Dead wife, sir?
MR.BRAIN: Yes! It worked for Mr. Freeze, didn't it? But lets up the anti_ his whole planet's destroyed and so now he wants to destroy the federation.
MR. PINKY: So the federation destroyed his planet?
MR.BRAIN: Nahh, but we'll come up with some convoluted plot point that'll wrap that all up.
MR. PINKY: How's he try to destroy the federation, sir, Sabotage? Political intrigue?
MR.BRAIN: Are you nuts, that would take whole minutes to establish, and mostly done through dialog! Go to chapter one in the Vile Implementations handbook.
MR. PINKY: Oh sir, you don't mean....?
MR.BRAIN: Yes my friend, the vaunted planet destroying weapon!
MR. PINKY: Didn't we do that with V-Ger in the first film Kahn and the genesis device, or the hunchback whale probe, or with that weirdo nexus ribbon that required the destruction or worlds to be moved, or when that guy who killed Mozart needed a face lift and was willing to use some solar collector thingie on a planet, or that OTHER Romulan dude, Shinzon or whatever, didn't he have a super baddie weapon he planned to use against the federation? And didn't Vader have like two of those types of things?
MR.BRAIN: Your point? It works, don't it?
MR. PINKY: Alright, so we got the federation against a rogue madman with his very own planet destroying weapon and an axe to grind?
MR.BRAIN: Sounds like Gold, don't it?
MR. PINKY: But neither Romulos nor Vulcan were destroyed in Kirks time of star trek, sir, how do we fit this in?
MR.BRAIN: C'mon, use you head willya, Mirror mirror on the wall!
MR. PINKY: Ohh of course sir, an alternate universe! Meaning Nero's a time traveler! The sci Fi trifecta, you are an absolute genius of modern celluloid story crafting, sir.
MR.BRAIN: Yes, yes, you're quite right! Alright my nephew'll be getting home from high school any minute; I get him working on the script as soon as he puts the key in the door!

Get you-self an edu-ma-cation, son:
Sadly I must admit to a prejudice myself, toward these greasy new executive hipsters whom blow in, un-time-tested, with one or two hits under their belt and now suddenly their some prodigy that knows better than everyone. I mean, at first I sort of buy into it cause I saw the flick and didn't vomit so I ran out and snatched up the DVD. Then suddenly you hear it, you hear it right there on the special features. ""I really wanted to make star trek more like star wars! Fast paced and not so heady."" Fair enough, you wanted one classic space opera to be more like another classic space opera more so than you wanted it to be like itself. Alright, knowing you boys the way I do that almost makes some sense. But then they keep talking and you hear things from their own lips like, ""we took this out because it was too Set-up-ee."" And allowing the vocab felony just committed by the word `Set-up-ee', you think; alright, the hipster's panicked that his excuse for dialog is going on too long between explosions. So out comes potentially pertinent information for the sake expediency. (them film jockeys call this ""pacing"") You keep moving. Then you get like a twelve and a half minute featurette showing you how the crafty crafters stationed a man just within camera shot so he could shine a flashlight into the lens and give everything a glaring effect. And you go. Well alright, this is sorta like movie magic, I guess, and it...is...worthy of a....full...featurette...........Right? then they talk about the director and the praise his wisdom and how good he is at turning water to wine and making the sick well and the blind see and all that, and then he comes on the scene and claims absolute stupidity, saying he was never a fan of the original trek, he never watched the show, but he had some GREAT IDEAS when they handed the project to him! So now you're like, alright, well.... So the guy's not a fan and... WAIT, WHY THE HELL IS HE MAKING THIS DAMNED MOVIE THEN? And why does an obviously smart man whom makes A-list movies feel compelled to completely downplay his wit in order to put butts in the seats? Has this society become so cynical and paranoid and functionally illiterate that we are dismayed by even the indication of a higher intellect behind our entertainment, or running our COUNTRY?! Are we at a point where a smart man has to play dumb or keep his street credibility and be taken semi seriously on the internet machine? All be told, allowing for Abrams to come out and claim a willful lack of education for himself and also of the genre he's just reinvented, harkens to the new trend of the hapless hero whom is seemingly brilliant by divine intervention and never had to work for his wit or his talents like everyone else. This new Kirk in the movie is a snot nosed kid, subversive and compulsive and reckless, yet someone sees potential in him and urges him to sign up. He even cheats, breaks all the rules and though Spock is a commander while he's still a cadet he is suddenly elevated to captain on his first mission, rising past Spock and a host of others whom I must assume have all been in Starfleet longer and whom presumably did so without faking out the system. I know the original Kirk cheated at the Kobyashi test, but you never get the impression that this was anything more than just an adherence to his own personal ideology that he didn't believe in the no win scenario. The way this is depicted, without any example of otherwise academic achievement on Chris Pines' (his character, not him, I think the dudes a whip ;)) part, we imply that he just got there on the merits of being ballsy and cheating his way through it. Someone should really have a problem with their heroes being depicted this way, but I don't think people were compelled to pay that much attention to the light lunch of characterization they were being spoon fed with sugary visuals! Hmmmmm, wait a minute.... was this Kirk quark a little autobiographical license there by the young upstart in the director's chair? Coincidence? Nahhh!

All put together I began to think to yourself, DID REALLY I JUST FRICKEN SEE AND HEAR WHAT I THOUGHT I SAW AND HEARD? And thus the intellect crusades begin. And there I go off wondering, is it not more important to inspire those still un-jaded and inspirables to CREATING something new?!

Technicality peeves:
Oh and Warp Nacelles are not thrusters, guys. The point is that they WARP space and propel the ship faster than light. They're not Jet afterburners! FYI. There have been literally a zillion tech manuals written on the Trek science, whereas you might think that these details are ridiculous, remember you're making a star trek movie! Don't talk to me about being a geek, you're the head geek in charge now, Mister mister! Can we get a guy that knows a guy to work on getting a guy to work on that? Also, who jettisons a cadet from their ship to a Hoth just because there's a slight disagreement? Doesn't the new flag ship have a brig? Oh, what? Oh, they needed to do that so young Kirk could meet old Spock and Scotty so that act 2 could begin? I see, uhhh.... Alright.... I guess. ;)  BUT I DIGRESS!

Wrap it up!:
My point is for this film and its fans; it could not have been without the original. Mr. Abrams, for all his genuine brilliance, could not have done this without firmly standing on the shoulders of Mr. Roddenberry, without taking from a wealth of pre-established minutia that allowed him the luxury of picking and choosing and then casting the aforementioned ""New Spin"". What I fail to understand in this great society of ours is, why does anything new that happens to also be good, have to be good at the expense of what came before? Why does this have to be BETTER? Why would we mock he original actors and what they did and what they left us? I mean, remember acting, folks. True the Shat-inator was over-exuberant from time to time...to time, but there was genuine conveyance of wit and both intellect and emotion from these highly capable people. We're mocking that against modern characteristic development? Are you serious? I think it would be easier to agree that it was a fast paced, enjoyable film that allowed new perspectives and new directions to be taken with old favorites if there wasn't automatically this seeming inescapable negative slant against the old for the exaltation of the new. The new is pretty, the new is newer, stylized and kinetically meeting the manic short attention span standards of the eyes of today. It has not been proven, it has not been weighed or time tested at the moment, it should be given a chance, but exaltation waits until exaltation is earned. As we have clearly learned with the original trek movies, and the new star wars, and even the new dune novels, NOTHING IS AN ABSOLUTE WIN.

I liked the film, I liked it a lot. I want more of this, but I want substance with it too, and I am harsh because I can see the trend trending away from weight and further and further towards fluff, toward ""easy"". Visuals are easy. I can think of a visual: a giant octopus wrapped tight around the empire state building, swatting battle ships out of the river while whistling the star spangled banner!: doesn't make that visual compelling or intriguing, (well kinda...) it's just a visual! It's not the film; it's the new ideological hubris I feel it represents.

If you are worried that you won't like Star Trek because you hated the show, you can relax. I have never been a fan of the show yet I am here to tell you that the movie is a lot of fun.

We meet up with the original characters so many have grown fond of over the years and each and every one of them was cast beautifully.

""My name is James Tiberius Kirk"", he announces dramatically when we meet him for the first time. He's maybe 10 and in trouble with the law for stealing his step-dad's nice car and `accidentally' driving it into a large quarry. I don't know why he needed to say his full name when the robot police officer asked him for it or why he had to shout it to all of us so triumphantly; oh wait, yeah I do folks, because it's a big Hollywood movie, that's why.

Chris Pine plays the older than the 10-year-old but younger than Shatner version of James T. Kirk. His scenes made me feel like I was watching Saved by the Bell: In Space. He's like the new and improved Zack Morris. He seems to play Kirk virtually effortlessly and we enjoy every second of it.

Simon Pegg is hilarious as Scotty and yes there are plenty of ""Beam-me-up"" one-liners to go around for everyone.

Karl Urban may have been destined to play Bones. He fits like Hugh Jackman fits as Wolverine. There are some very well timed comedic moments exchanged between him and Kirk. I wish there were time for a few more of them.

The performance in the film I was the least satisfied with was surprisingly Eric Bana. Bana is consistently very good but was not at all properly cast here. He plays the villain Nero, who in my opinion is too lame even for the old television show. I was repeatedly annoyed by this character and found him to be a pathetic excuse for a lead villain. He wounded the film severely.

I'm not forgetting anyone, am I? Oh wait, who was that strange pointy eared fellow in desperate need of a sense of humor. Oh yes, Spock!

Who would have thought that Star Trek would have a possible candidate for an Oscar nomination in acting? I sure didn't. But thanks to the amazing performance of Zachary Quinto as Spock, it could very well be looked at for more than just its amazing special effects.

This kid has got something. He really dove into the role of Spock and blew me away. He out-acts everyone in every scene and remember, I said the others did a good job too. He's every bit as good as Leonard Nimoy, if not better. I have yet to watch the show Heroes, but have heard many great things about his role and after seeing him in Star Trek; I will definitely be checking it out soon.

This is clearly a starter film so there's not much of a plot. Basically, that horrible villain Nero I told you about, is upset at everyone and plans on taking over the galaxy, I guess was his point? Our good guys all board the Enterprise and they duke it out with Nero and his men. That's pretty much it in a nutshell folks.

Don't take that as a bad thing though. While the plot isn't that thick, the movie is still well written. Including the way characters enter each frame and the great deal of humor. We get to know all of the characters and enjoy their interactions with one-another more than the plot anyway. There were even a few moments where you were really moved as well.

I was moved early in the film when Kirk takes on a group of guys in a bar fight in an attempt to impress a girl. There's more to it than that though. The writers are showing us a lot about his personality and we get the sense that he would have still picked that fight had she not been there. He doesn't take crap from anyone and these guys clearly deserved to get their heads knocked in.

The scene continues as Kirk is approached by the Captain of the Enterprise, Pike, (Bruce Greenwood) who leaves him with choice words to ponder. I strongly believe Bruce Greenwood could carry a movie by himself; just as well as he carried the second half of this scene and several others in Star Trek. I don't know if Hollywood will ever give him a leading role, but I would love it if they did.

J.J. Abrams is a great director and excels at action and suspense driven scenes. You get amazing shots through space of the new Enterprise gliding and some great action sequences. I particularly enjoyed the scene where Kirk visited another planet and was chased by a huge creature.

Had they put the same energy into Nero that they did into the other characters it would have been a lot better. But also keep in mind, I'm not a real fan of Star Trek, so if you are then you may very well love it.",1263168000,,4938,4.335140997830803

the ""Gene Roddenberry's View"" extra. We can fell it watching the movie, but here we
can see that J.J. Abrams was heavily concerned in keeping the main spirit of Star
Trek, that is the technology's use in absolute benefit of mankind.",1263081600,,321,4.8545454545454545
3472189,3,B001AVCFJM,"I think it is very tricky to write a Star Trek movie because if you stick with the original Enterprise crew you are critiqued for re-hashing and when you vary from the main story-line the fans aren't satisfied.  That is probably why there are a lot of reviews for this film that either love it or hate it.

Like other reviewers I wanted to love it after hearing good things.

The good:  Zachary Quinto as young Spock, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Eric Bana as Nero.  The Romulan Ship. The explanation of Uhura's job description as xenolinguist. The early Spock story. Simon Pegg's ""Scotty"" accent and dialect. There were a couple of good lines, particularly for the young Spock.  Uhura and Spock having an academy romance--this was a nice touch.

The Bad:  the story was just lame and silly. Kirk was written as a lout who gets into trouble all the time and then gets out of it because he is really smart. Rodenberry and Shatner's version was passionate and intuitive but also refined and dignified. Pine was just not charismatic enough to carry off this ""loose cannon"" Kirk.  Also, the script expected us to believe that all the main characters got together while in the Academy and then just stayed together on the Enterprise--no more training for them! And that Kirk became a captain before finishing school. Come on.  Starfleet has always been portrayed as having high standards--not anymore, apparently.

The Ugly:  I think that Starfleet would not have allowed a cadet to bellow racial epithets (pointy eared hob-goblin indeed!)like Bones did to Spock in this movie. Yes, in the original Bones did say this type of thing but in private to Spock or under his breath--it was all part of a disagreement approaches to problem-solving as opposed to appearance.  Also--why blow up planet Vulcan and most of the Vulcan race as part of a plot point?  Not necessary!

Okay, I could go on but I want to say that I understand that there was some emotional coherence to the way the early versions of the characters related and I think this is what fans are enjoying. I understand that but it was not enough to grab me.",1263081600,3,2105,4.682065217391305
3472190,3,B001AVCFJM,"I'm not the biggest Trek fan ever but I am a big enough fan to be bothered by J.J. Abrams dumbed-down Star Trek. I don't go to the conventions or anything but I have watched every episode of all of the TV shows (minus DS9, just couldn't get into it) and ever single movie several times. Now when I go see a movie called ""Star Trek"" that is what I expect to get is a Star Trek movie. That doesn't sound too crazy does it? Instead I got a generic action Sci-Fi flick. This movie has more in common with Star Wars (not saying Star Wars is bad, at least with the original trilogy) then it does with Star Trek. I understand they wanted a more accessible and more popular movie to relaunch the series with (not that it needed to be relaunched) but they could have easily accomplished this without destroying everything that Star Trek is. They didn't have to make the Phasers into Star Wars blasters and they could have included just 10 or 15 minutes extra into the movie to explain the science of what was going on. Something Star Trek has always been about, not to mention character relationships but we'll forget that for the sake of a summer blockbuster. Instead we are left with no idea what the hell red matter is. Oh and by the way you can't travel through a black hole! The word the script writers were looking for was wormhole. How could they not even get that right? Regardless of my complaints it's still a fun action movie. It just seems to me that they could have rebooted the series and made it more accessible without throwing everything out the window that makes Star Trek what it is. Like I said, 10 or 15 minutes extra to the movie is all they needed, plus some fact checking on the script, and I would have been fine, even happy. However J.J. Abrams was too quick to make the film he wanted and not the film that Trekkies wanted. Note to Abrams: when making a franchise film, leave out your trademark red matter bull crap,just because it worked on Alias doesn't mean it works everywhere, and slusho references. Anyway if your looking for a fun action flick to pass the time, you could do a lot worse than Star Trek and it does look great in Blu-Ray.",1263081600,2,2161,4.351485148514851

3472192,5,B001AVCFJM,"It's always nice when you get a movie that gives you action to keep you on the end of your seat, but this one has a plot that keeps you guessing where they are going with the outcome.  I found this a really refreshing adventure with lots of emotion.  I would suggest this movie to anyone, it breaks all the boundries, it has its moments of comedy, plenty of action, a love story of a sort and for the scifi fans you can't get more scifi then deep space action.",1263081600,,460,4.1

The movie was so well cast, and the writing was phenomenal- lots of great scifi and action with a great mix of humor. I LOVE that Leonard Nemoy is in the movie.

Even my non treker friend was impressed.  The re-boot was so clever with no huge gaping holes in plot & an obvious respect to the original premise.

The blu ray transfer, both video & audio, are flawless. The extras are extremely interesting & border on almost overload. The digital copy worked perfectly & was easily transfered to my Ipod.

Wait... is this how things started?

This version of Star Trek involves, at its outset, an event that changes the future of Kirk, Spock, and every other Star Trek character you know.  At the end of the film, if there were new adventures of Star Trek covering the original series' Star Date, they would be different.

Are there sequels in production here, to do just that?

This was a fine adventure, with thrills, battles, and plenty of Star Trek trivia to connect with the original series.  Of course, when Kirk is banished from the USS Enterprise (??), sent to a planet next to Vulcan, and happens to run into, ahem, Star WARS-type creatures and situations, culminating in a wildly improbable meeting with an older Spock (and where did the wood for the fire come from), and, of, course, a young Scotty just happens to be within a few kilometers... give me a break!

But the fighting scenes were great.  Loved the Romulan mining vessel.  Thought Spock's mom was a bit young.

3472204,2,B001AVCFJM,"In the documentary on the DVD of the new ""Star Trek"" film, director JJ Abrams said that he always felt that Star Trek was limited by the technology for creating spectacular shots and things. Really? I always thought that Star Trek's greatest technological limitation was the speed at which a typewriter could type. That's because Star Trek at its best was about ideas - not spectacle - and the writers for the original series were among the best science fiction writers around. Star Trek has never been as popular as Star Wars because Star Trek asked its audience to think - and whenever you do that, you're going to limit the size of your audience.

Still, I don't have a problem with hyping things up a bit or using a new cast to play the older characters. What I do have a problem with is a bad story, which is what this film has. I mean, was it really necessary to show everybody at the Academy together? Kirk and Chekov are years apart in age and should have been at the Academy years apart - but no, there they are together.

Some of the scenes, like the one of the kid Kirk in the stolen car or the cadet Kirk doing the Kobayashi Maru test were embarassing. How about showing new starships being built complete on the ground? (They have to be assembled in space because they can't fly through the atmosphere.) Everybody's at the Academy together, so how do we get Kirk to be captain at the end? We'll just promote a third year Academy cadet to be the captain of the fleet's newest flagship, that's how! (Can you really imagine the US Navy naming an Annapolis cadet to be captain of its newest aircraft carrier?  I don't think so.)

There were some parts that I liked, mostly early on, such as the scenes aboard the Kelvin with Kirk's father (and his 1960's hairstyle) and Spock's early days on Vulcan. After those, though, things went downhill. Abrams could have just used a new cast and a new style to go back to the early days and show it in a different way, but no. He had to come up with this contrivance and essentially erase everything that happened before him - because according to this film, what happened in the original series never happened!

In short, this film is a triumph of style over substance.  It may look cool, but it's hollow at the core.  J.J. Abrams has taken an intelligent series and turned it into a comic strip. It is Star Trek in name only. (If you want comic strip Trek, I'd suggest you look for the animated series from the early 70s. It's much more intelligent - and much better - than this film.)",1262822400,15,2536,4.417558886509636
3472205,2,B001AVCFJM,"Actually the story idea is okay.  I'm interested at first glance.  The inclusion of Leonard Nimoy as Spock in a cameo role during the movie may be this movie's only saving grace however.  The bad guy on the enemy ship is a tired cliche overused role that science fiction fans would rather see outside of Star Trek genre.  The gratuitous underwear shots of the green alien girl didn't add that much, and that whole segment in the dorm room could have been left out in my opinion and not diminished this movie even a trifle.  The explanation for why the doctor was nicknamed 'bones' is a great part of the story, and the character development of the original series roles of Kirk, Spock, Bones, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu, and Scotty are at least well thought out.  But Science Fiction seems to have hit a brick wall when it comes to innovative out of the box type thinking, and since the production budget didn't go to the cast, where's the special effects for the Romulan wierdo's ship?  Gene Roddenberry did more with the original series back there in the 1960's than modern day technology did with this movie.  Sorry Star Trek fans.

3472210,5,B001AVCFJM,"When it comes down to Star Trek, I was always one of those fans that understood enough to appreciate and to know a little bit about the series but never got fully involved in the show/movies to know what I was talking about. For example, while I've seen Wrath of Khan and every film from Generations on, I've barely watched any of the television shows save for the occasional ""Next Generation"" episode so the idea of seeing JJ Abrams, brainchild behind ""Alias"" and ""Lost"", re-invigorating the series after the stagnant ""Nemesis"" wasn't met with a unabashed anticipation but more of a I'll-check-it-out-when-its-out attitude. Turns out that yes indeed Star Trek is an awesome film and that one can make a blockbuster without the emptiness of say a ""Transformers 2"". Sure storyline-wise it's got its faults but not a lot of summer films or any films this year really had that excitement of ""this is why I go to the movies"". There's enough pure popcorn with enough drama so it's not just pure eye-candy, Star Trek is indeed a great reboot for the franchise.

The film diverges on a tangent right in the opening scene allowing the writers and filmmakers to deviate from the canon and create a sort-of alternate storyline of Star Trek rather than remake the first movie or just do episodes in movie film. The film starts out with the USS Kelvin running right smack into the Narada, a massive ship headed by Captain Nero and what they want is Spock but they want the old Ambassador Spock and not one that really hasn't even been born yet. So an attack leaves the Kelvin destroyed and a baby being born during the attack, one named James Tiberius Kirk. Years later, Kirk meets what would be his future crew: Uhura, Sulu, Chekov, Scotty and Spock as they try to figure out how best to deal with Nero and his technologically advanced ship.

To paraphrase an old saying, ""this isn't your father's Star Trek"". Or for that matter, probably not even your Star Trek as the new crew and new faces brings with it a new tone, dialogue is snappier, cleavage and innuendo is more prevalent and action scenes have a lot more kick which makes the film all the more standout since Star Trek even in the films weren't exactly known for being action-scene intensive but here you can clearly see Abrams making a movie for the newer audiences, something with more flash and a bit more...""spunk"" I guess you can say. But that doesn't mean the film sacrifices action for pathos as a couple scenes do show some acting showcases like Zoe Saldana's tearful meeting with Spock in an elevator. As far as the acting is concerned, it ranges from excellent acting that captures the essences of their older counterparts (Pine/Shatner or Quinto/Nemoy) but then we have actors who have to clearly sound like their others such as Anton Yelchin doing a rather amusing turn as Chekov and Simon Pegg doing a good Scottish accent for his role.

As far as the villain is concerned, Eric Bana does a really great job making a menacing character and though not terribly imaginative (something bad happened, thinks somebody's got to pay, and might as well be Starfleet) he certainly makes a good antagonist though strangely there's not really a character for him to play off of. You'd think Spock but old Spock is barely in the movie and doesn't interact with Nero all that much whereas young Spock is like ""who the hell's this dude?"" One I hope re-appears a lot is Bruce Greenwood as Captain Pike who practically exudes confidence and power as well as an honourable soldier incredibly easily. Now one thing I hope they don't do is just start redoing old Star Trek episodes or the films and decide to bring in Khan. It's a new timeline, get creative...please?

Bonus features wise it's a pretty stacked disc with making-ofs dealing with the effects, shooting on the set and taking on the franchise anew. Great highlight is the commentary where they explain why they took out the birth of Spock, the use of sound design like draining the sound in the opening or a score-only pass but then the Starfleet emblem that's apparently near Jupiter was completely lost on me and I can never find it. Transfer wise it's stunning and sound design is equally balanced though I don't know about you guys but the idea of adding digital copies is kind of getting old since a movie like Star Trek just looks...odd on a tiny iPod screen and doesn't have the theatre-esque experience of your home setup with the big speakers and 42"" 1080p tv.

Film's nearly perfect with a couple weird story moments (Kirk manages to land on the same planet as Spock which is okay but he runs right into him in a cave on a huge planet?) and characters like Sulu don't get as much screen time but as far as summer blockbusters go, it's hard to beat it, especially when you watch GI Joe or Transformers 2 which were pure action and little else. I'd love to see a sequel and it's obvious we're getting one though I hope they don't rush it out but this is a definite buy.",1262822400,,4984,4.614430665163472

I'm more inclined to believe it was a bunch of marketing execs with MBAs who looked at the iconic Star Trek series like they would, say, Coca-Cola or Levi's jeans: as a product to be milked for every dime they could squeeze out of it.

My evidence:

1.) The ""bad boy"" characterization of Kirk, complete with reckless driving, discipline issues and constant friction with authority figures.  This James Tiberius is the quintessential smart-a** kid who proves he really is not only way cooler than his nerd teachers but also smarter.  Think Ferris Bueller with a phaser.

2.) The stupid, one-dimensional portrayals of the other characters.  Uhura as an ass-kicking sex symbol (Carrie Fisher in ""Star Wars"", Angelina Jolie in everything she has ever done, the chick from ""Bones"").  Spock as the noble yet tormented soul forever seperated from his home (Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca, Doc Holliday in ""Tombstone,"" and let's not forget Superman),  Scotty as the mandatory clown tossed in for comic relief (Friar Tuck in Costner's ""Robin Hood"", Nigel Bruce in the Sherlock Holmes films, Barney Fife, Lou Costello, that idiot in ""Van Helsing,"" and countless others).  The villian who is simultaneously a talented genius and a madman consumed with hatred and revenge (Ahab, Lex Luthor, Darth Vader).  The producers didn't create these people, they yanked them off a shelf in a store called ""Formulaic Plots'R Us.""

3.) The Flash Gordon-style storyline, rife with pseudo-scientifc nonsense, Nokia product placement and, mandatory in this dumbed-down age, plenty of computer generated eye candy.

Of course all of this is lost on its fans, who sing its praises while gathered around the gaming table of the local comic book shop.  ""Maybe I can't get a date, but who cares when I've got a life-size statue of the Dark Knight in my room in the basement!  And mom better not throw it away again, or I'm moving out!""

The saddest part of this tragedy is that Roddenberry intended Star Trek to be the thinking person's alternative to the brain-dead space westerns that pass for science fiction.  Now, four decades later, his creation is turned into the very thing he despised.  Maybe his vision of humanity's potential was a bit too naive after all.  That's the sad truth taught by this joke of a film.  Beam me up, Scotty.  There really is no intelligent life on this planet.",1262649600,105,2536,4.878504672897196

3472218,5,B001AVCFJM,"BACKGROUND
Although I don't consider myself a ""trekkie"" or ""trekker"" as they now refer to themselves (Ok, I'm more a Star Wars fan), I enjoyed the movies with the original cast from part II (Wrath of Khan) to part VI, but I found very hard to follow The Next Generation series and Movies. Overall, I'm a fan and collector of Sci-Fi movies.

PLOT
This is a whole new beginning. Captain Kirk didn't born in Iowa, Spock is in love, Uhura is hot, in other words, anything that most hardcore fans would hate is included, but also, most action/sci-fi fans would enjoy this new perspective. The only thing that I would consider negative, is that the villain is just a renegade mad Romulan miner from the future (although with the capability to destroy planets), who bites the dust at the end. I would expect the heroes to fight a larger enemy, as the Romulan Empire (Romulan-Earth war) for example.

CAST
Everyone performs well. It's a strong cast. As this is a new concept, don't expect Spock or Kirk (or anyone) to have the same personality than in the original series or movies. You will find that Spock is capable of having feelings towards Uhura!, you wouldn't saw that coming right?!?!

MUSIC
The weak point of the movie: The score. I'm surprised on how good in general Star Trek scores are (those of the original cast movies are great). Unfortunately this one is not memorable. Only at the end, the music of the Original Series makes an appearance, but it's not enough to save the unspiring score.

PERSONAL COMMENT
Star Trek is one of these franchises that developed REAL hardcore fans. They will support almost everything you do as long as you keep the original concept unaltered.

The problem with Star Trek, especially after The Next Generation is that the segment of hardcore fans was too specific, so the market was always pretty limited. Same as other franchises, Hollywood needed to re-invent the series to appeal to a larger market. This was the base to develop a whole new Star Trek. So surely hardcore fans will hate this movie, but sci-fi/action movie fans will like it.

CONCLUSION
I have found people who tell me that they haven't seen this movie because they don't like Star Trek. Believe me, this is a very different experience. This is a very good movie. It's Star Trek for a new generation and for a larger audience. You will enjoy it!",1262649600,,2353,4.671497584541063

I remember being so surprised to learn it only came out a year or two after The Twilight Zone ended its 5-year run. Such a change from a mostly black-and-white series to an all-color one. After growing familiar with the crew members in the series and the following movies Star Trek TMP through Generations, I never wondered where they all came from and how they found each other. As much as I enjoyed those, Star Trek 2009 showed us how it all began. The action was fast-paced and yes, sometimes I got  a bit lost in where we were heading, but watching the relations form between the crewmen made it great fun to watch. When the closing credits began and I heard that familiar, if slightly different, original theme missing from all of the movies I knew I was home again. Of course it was very disturbing to watch Spock's mother Amanda tear away from the rest before they were beamed aboard the Enterprise, and later the death of Vulcan, I remind myself you have to take the good with the bad. Perhaps if sequels to 2009 are made, those tragic events will be made understandable and acceptable to viewers. I rented the movie from Netflix and watched it three times over two days before shipping it back, and will purchase it as soon as I can so I can watch it whenever I feel like doing so. If viewers can understand beforehand the characters won't be quite the same as in the original series, and that special effects are more in keeping with the times, they should be a ble to separate it from the old series, the movies, and the spinoffs, and enjoy it for what it is to me -- a wonderful look at the early beginnings when they were strangers to each other and their posts, and watch the crew start to come together while learning about each other.

It actually got me interested to see the rest of the movies so I got her the original 6 movies for Christmas, all which I have now watched, and I will soon get the next 4 Next Generation movies. She was very upset for awhile at certain things that didn't immediately make sense, like Kirk's father getting killed so early in his life, Vulcan getting destroyed, etc. and it seems a lot of other Trek fans disapprove for similar reasons. It actually makes perfect sense; as the time-travel alternate-universe plot-twist revealed itself, I explained to her that this movie is not actually a prequel, but actually yet another SEQUEL about Spock's fate when he grows old. The prequel aspect is really just a fun and much more interesting way to package the movie than to show Spock get thrown back in time and be stuck on a frozen planet for umpteen years until the Romulan Nero is able to force him to watch helplessly as he takes his revenge by destroying Spock's home planet. My wife had been upset that this movie seemed to ""reset"" or ""nullify"" the original episodes and movies with its alternate-universe events, but once she realized and understood that it is a sequel, she really liked it.

Like the Star Wars prequels, the most fun is just identifying characters and drawing connections to the Original Series characters and events we know and love. On its own, though, it's just not much of a story.

What the movie lacks is heart. The surface plot doesn't suffice. The only character that makes any sense is the bad guy who's flying some big ship that looks like what the Babylon 5 shadows would fly if they had giant battle cruisers.

However, this review isn't about the movie, but rather the Blue Ray version.  First, let me state that this was the first Blue Ray disc I've watched.  Sadly, I didn't see anything truly spectacular in the resolution...my hopes were too high I guess.  The movie disc was as good as you could expect, but the extras are what I was most interested in.  I had hoped to watch the movie with the deleted scenes inserted but sadly, I didn't find an option for that.  The deleted scenes were stunning; I can't figure out why they took them out of the final movie (except the klingon scenes...I didn't care for them at all).  The rest would have made the movie even better!

The starship simulator is a mystery to me, because I couldn't get it to come up.  It just showed a little dialog box as an introduction and never did anything else.  I'm sure it is there but the interface confused me.

The casting extra was interesting but I had hoped to see some screenings of the actors screen tests.

The tribute to Roddenberry was very good.

The gags (outtakes) were ok but too many 'prepared' outtakes for me.

I haven't watched the rest yet.  I don't have to to give it 5 stars.  If you like the movie, you'll love the dvd.",1262476800,,1609,4.404761904761905

What I mean by that is the special effects wizards at ILM, bless em, can create any imagery, conjure any imploding star, lens flare, cloud nebula, or incredibly destructive explosion you can imagine. The writers and producers can create any kind of convoluted, twisting plot, design any virtual set, city, or structures, shoot with any unusual camera angle, or engage in virtually any kind of wild stunt you never dreamed you could see.

It's Wagnerian Whiz-Bang, pedal-to-the-metal, over-the-top-entertainment typical of today's over-produced and over-stimulative blockbusters. Is this really what big movies are all about? It's true, it's giving our kids ADD.

As a Star Trek TOS purist, it doesn't fit the mold of the original series. But because JJ Abrams and his team employed the original characters, and made an extraordinary attempt to bring back the original Star Trek bridge, I give them extra credit for their artistic vision and ambition.

In fact, the visual concepts with their enormity of scale and rich detail, the action, and their execution are absolutely spellbinding. This film is loaded with great action sequences that are at the hot cutting edge of anything out there.

Nevertheless, I think we should all sit down calmly, take a stress pill and think things over. Just slow down, man. And bring back the social commentary that was what Star Trek was all about.",1262476800,2,1424,5.125

3472237,1,B001AVCFJM,"This film is awful! If you are a fan of the original Star Trek TV series, you are warned to STAY AWAY!
It was fun to see the original characters again, but the awful plot made this film very frustrating and painful to watch. This movie is bright and shiny, fast and LOUD!  The film moves at a breakneck pace, presumably to keep you from noticing how dumb it is. Star Trek has become Flash Gordon! This is a big budget B-movie.

 The script for this film has NOTHING original in it - it's cobbled together from bits of past Trek movies: a meglomaniacal Romulan seeking revenge on a main character - lifted from Nemesis; Enterprise full of Star Fleet cadets must rush of to the rescue - lifted from Generations; bad guy has a super weapon which destroys planets, and only the crew of Enterprise can stop him - taken from Generations; a defenseless(!) Earth threatened by a giant alien spacecraft, Enterprise must rush to the rescue - stolen from A Voyage Home (or First Contact, take your pick); A future version of one of the main characters gives a person in the past a formula for advanced technology, which they would have invented anyway - lifted from A Voyage Home. You get the idea.

[Spoiler Alert]
Spock has become senile! Planet Romulus, the Romulan's home world, is going to destroyed by it's sun, which has become a super nova, so Spock hatches a scheme to use an artificially created black hole to suck up the super nova in order to save Romulus. Um, Spock? What about the brand new black hole now at the center of the Romulan solar system? Isn't THAT going to destroy Romulus just as handily as the super nova would have? D'oh!
[End Spoiler Alert]

Casting: I do like the casting of most of the characters. The only misstep is the new Scotty.  Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) was a bad choice to play Scotty.

I would be happy to see this new crew ( with a different Scotty) in action if the story were written by an actual Sci-Fi author who understands the premise of Star Trek, and the characters.  Maybe a film in which the Enterprise goes boldy where no one has gone before, seeking new life forms and new civilizations? Too much to hope for?",1262304000,25,2167,4.44080604534005

That said - this is the first Star Trek movie in probably over 10 years that didn't just completely disgust me.  I enjoyed watching it.  The TNG movies were all abominations and slowpaced and plodding.  At least this was a fun ride from start to end.

And there was no theme, like Star Trek the Motion picture, etc. had.  Where is James Horner or Jerry Goldsmith when you need them?  Also, Kirk as a kid in the sports car, did you all notice the stupid NOKIA plug?  Outrageous!  I was expecting next to see Coca Cola logos on the bridge.  Speaking of which, the interior of the ship looked nothing like it should have, like in the original Star Trek.  They also changed the personalities of most of the characters.

So, this movie is a ""redo"" of Star Trek going back to the events of the original series.  The casting is phenomenal, especially Karl Urban as Leonard McCoy and Zachary Quinto as Spock.  Both have their characters spot on.  And John Cho as Sulu rocks.  I was surprised with Wenona Ryder as Spock's mother, but that point is moot (as people who have seen the movie know).  The movie is very entertaining, even to a Star Trek fan as I am.  Though this movie targets people new to Star Trek, the movie would seem to be more enjoyable to Star Trek fans since there are numerous references to the television series.  The re-envisioning of the Star Trek world is certainly for the 21st century movie-goer.  There are lots of action, explosions, and special effects, but I feel this is a step backwards.  The original Star Trek focused on characters and had stories mirroring the current events of the time.  It certainly wasn't meant to be philosophical or tried to convey morality, but it did leave the viewer with some thought provoking ideas.  Though, I loved what Captain Pike told Kirk, ""I dare you to do better.""  Yes!  And, what are all these light flares about?  I found them very distracting, especially with scenes within the Kelvin and the Enterprise.  In the commentary, the filming of this movie described borrowing elements from Star Wars.  No, no, no, no, and NO!  That's why Star Trek is popular today, it's different than Star Wars!  The monster chasing Kirk on the frozen planet reeked of Star Wars.  And I desperately hope Scotty's companion doesn't become another Jar Jar Binks (or even a Wesley Crusher, ugh).",1262217600,,1642,4.738515901060071

Now I know the purists will grouse about the slight deviations from STAR TREK lure regarding character origins and backgrounds, but all in all, this film is a great reboot of the STAR TREK universe. Every actor, from the main characters to the background bit performers, paid all due respect to the subject. So many other iconic film subjects (Superman, Batman, Spiderman, to name a few) have been played for the tongue-in-cheek laughs making fun of the material, but not this time.

I would first like to say before seeing the movie at the theaters, I had mixed reviews about it. After seeing it I was totally amazed at how J.J. Abrams invisioned it, and how the story unfolded.

I was very surprised at how the ship was designed, using previous designs,and creating a whole new starship. The bridge also where it was located in this design really threw me. Normally seeing the bridge in the tv series and movies on the top of the saucer, locating it on the bottom was very ingeniuse. I decided to purchase this as one of my very first BLU RAYS discs, and loved watching it again.

Paramount has a web site dedicated to Blu Rays. This is where you would register for BD LIVE in order to have access through your Blu Ray player for the added features. After doing some investigating into this site it states that Paramount BD LIVE is only available to US RESIDENTS. Needless to say I contacted my Blu Ray manufacturer they told me to insert an SD CARD into my player. After following my manufactures instructions BD LIVE is working now...!

So for those who have bought Paramount movies, and a warning comes up that you have no internet connection is it's because the SD card is required. BD LIVE will work only after you insert an SD CARD, and is available to us Canadians...!",1262131200,,1377,4.5

High points included giving Captain Kirk a less than perfect and more believable personality.  The original Cpt. Kirk was just too perfect in ever situation.

Star Trek has become largely identified (whether unfairly or not) with it's geeky legions of trekee fans and its stars who refuse to give up the limelight (I'm looking at you William Shatner).  But with J.J. Abrams' reboot of the beloved series, something amazing has happened:  Star Trek is cool.  That's right, for the first time in what seems like eons, we have a Star Trek film that just about eveyone can love.  Abrams wisely decides to take us back to the early years of the crew of the Enterprise; when Kirk was a young rebel who was nowhere near being ready to assume the role of captain and when Spock was an emotionally conflicted and even arrogant young genius.  The heart of Star Trek lies in the relationship between these two.  At first they butt heads but soon they grow to respect one another and devlop a strong friendship.  The entire cast of the film is outstanding and a special kudos to Simon Pegg for his wonderfully funny take on the beloved Scotty.  It is also a blast to see the original Spock, Leonard Nimoy, worked into the story via a time travel plot that seems to have come right out of Abrams' popular TV series, Lost.  Star Trek is not a great film, it is, in the end, pure summer entertainment.  But it is summer entertainment with brains, heart and, as mentioned before, and an effortless sense of cool that has never been associated with the series until now.

Spock has gone emo, Kirk is nothing but a young, overconfident guy that gets into a lot of fights. Supporting characters are average with Uhura as Starfleet's top communications officer an improvement. Other good points are the opening 3d scenes involving the birth of Kirk and also the musical score and sound is fabulous. Everywhere you look will be elements of different series and movies, but slightly changed to try and make it more exciting. The ""lens flare"" effect was effective and did add to the feel of the movie even with the poor vanity lights bridge design. The plot is basic timetravel good guy / bad guy and clips along at a bleeding pace. If thats all you want then the movie will be fun. If you watched the original movies then you'll see how bad copies of Spock and Jim affect the plot and ultimately damages it to keep this movie from getting 5 stars. Also, this movie is yet another remake of Wrath of Kahn with Nero being Kahn. You'd think they'd have learned their lesson from Nemesis. It is not necessary for every Star Trek movie to copy from its predecessors! Star Trek plots are starting to get damn near religious in repetition and I find it disappointing! The original series was far more original (yes I think the whale movie was one of the best)! Star Trek 2009 is like a buffet of every Star Trek series, both good and bad with a tired plot. It has exciting visuals and sound. In the end I felt Star Trek The Motion Picture and its subsequent sequels starring the real Leonard Nimoy and were still better, pure classic, and more awesome than this. Star Trek 2009 is a children's movie with little content beyond its comedy and fighting. I still enjoyed it as it doesn't take itself too serious and is more of an homage.

How to explain the movie's content? It doesn't exist. It's inexplicable.  For example, the ""plot"" involves something called ""red matter"". Never heard about it before? No wonder.  It's just stupidity that doesn't fit Star Trek.  The movie is complete dreck and it's a shame because it could have been really awesome.

In many ways the film is a complete rip off of Star Wars.  There's actually a Death Star, no kidding.  And there's the complete remake of a Hoth and Young Luke Scene with a monster.  No kidding.  I didn't want to watch this movie, but for $5 in a dome IMAX I went for it.  If you can watch it in a dome IMAX do it, but ignore the plot. The music is nice too.  But for example there is a ridicilous fighting scene with Sulu with the worst music ever in film history.  It was just too strange.  The movie is a total mess from all angles - directing, shooting, and acting too.  Over the top ludicrous acting by ""Kirk"" and Spock is definitely not a Vulcan anymore, not even a half vulcan.  He's more like Riker.

As a stand alone movie it has everything that would make a winner. The actors were good, the story was well told and the look of the movie is spectacular.

As part of the Star Trek franchise, it is a disaster. Destroying the planet Vulcan? Making one of the founding members of the Federation an endangered species?

NO- the producer over-reached and created something that can't stand beside the existing body of work.

J.J. Abrams is great but in this case he screwed the pooch. He re-wrote history and undermined a near-sacred franchise in a way that in completely untenable. You simply CAN NOT do that with a shared treasure like Star Trek with generations of fans that know the story and trivia much better than the bleeding idiots who OKed production of this wretched script.

I am a big fan of the original Star Trek TV series and movies but did not ever care for the spin-offs. This new take on the original characters was fun. The movie had all the great inside jokes for the trekkers but also was enjoyable for the new fans. My daughter and I sat and watched the movie together and she enjoyed it as much as I even though she has seen only a few of episodes of the original series.
The only thing I wish was different is that on the single disc edition you do not get the deleted scenes. I knew this when I bought it and thought it would not matter, but if you watch the movie with commentary several references are made to the deleted scenes which made me curious to see them.

3472287,3,B001AVCFJM,"Here's the rub: This story is a good ""what if?"" story. Marvel comics use to do a comic called ""What If?"", and this story definately fits there! What everyone who is giving it one or two stars is forgetting, or ignoring, is that as soon as Nero appeared, he changed the entire timeline for the universe! So, yes, Uhura was never interrested in Spock, that was Nurse Chappels place! And Kirk's father didn't die that way... and Vulcan was never destroyed.... and Captian Pike was NEVER on the Enterprise with Kirk..... and and and and and!

So, the real issue here is, was this a good alternate possible scenario for our favorite characters? Not too bad in my oppinion. I thought the basic way that the crew was thrown together was novel. And the story was interresting, not really great. The actors were passible (I actually enjoy the group that has created ""Star Trek: The New Voyages"" much more! Probably because they do it out of love for the Star Trek Culture rather than money!)

I felt that the music was definately over the top. The Enterprise itself was ok. We REALLY didn't need Scotty's pal!! And truthfully, the Uhura/Spock thing was not necessary at all! Very uncomfortable!

Hopefully, their next effort will rectify some of these issues, or at least call it ""Star Trek: the Alternate Universe"" or something like that, for as all Star Trek fans know, this was NOT Star Trek as we accept it! Live long and prosper all!",1261872000,2,1429,4.640316205533597
3472288,1,B001AVCFJM,"I'm so disappointed with Damon Lindelof putting his name to this garbage, the screenplay was juvenile (and that's an insult to children every where by the way).  The Uhura and Spock romance is just plain silly, it added nothing to the story (was there actually a story?) whatsoever.  How about Kirk jumping from punk, rabble-rousing rebel to cadet then on to starship captain in about three years; including being suspended from the academy then promoted to first officer after being discovered as a stowaway on The Enterprise, all within 24 hours.  Whatever happened to military promotions and protocol?  Did Lindelof and Abrams hire high-school drama writers to write this junk?

I can handle this film being terrible, I was never much of a Star Trek fan anyway.  I do know enough about the franchise to know that these characters were not playing even remotely to the characters fans know and love.  Come on, Vulcan teens teasing young Spock and giving him a shove?  ""That's right Spock!  You're such a little tool."" (ok, I made the dialog up but it was equally as bad) Highly improbable and illogical.

The writers (and producers) even gave Scotty (who doesn't even appear until the final 20 minutes) a cute little alien side-kick that looked an awful lot like a dwarf version of The Creature From the Black Lagoon (only without menacing teeth and claws).  This figure looked like it was created with a glob of green play-dough by someone around 9 or 10 years of age and quickly painted.  Maybe it was played by Gumby, middle aged and fat?  Maybe it was a pile of moldy cheese?  It sure was ""cheesy"".

I found the writing very shallow and predictable, despite the character ""twists"".  What really amazes me is the fact that both JJ Abrams and Damon Lindelof think this film is something they can take pride in having made (I read pre-release interviews with both guys and they thought this project was so special). It's special alright but not in a good way.

What disturbs me the most is that I've spent fives seasons heavily invested in ""Lost"", a fantastic television series that includes some of the better story and dialog writing in television history, and those same guys produced this garbage.  Why does that disturb me?  If JJ and Damon can take pride in their Star Trek, then I am very worried about their upcoming resolution for ""Lost"".  I sure hope this was terrible because they were putting all their REAL effort into ""Lost"".  Take us out Mr Sulu.  Warp speed away away from this turkey.  On to The Planet of the Baritone Women!

3472291,5,B001AVCFJM,"When I heard that J.J. Abrams was going to reboot the Star Trek universe, I cringed.  Most attempts to reboot successful franchises fail spectacularly (Land of the Lost, anyone?), so I told myself I wouldn't bother with it until someone else had, and gave it a good review.  It came out, and I dutifully ignored it, except...

All the reviews were excellent, except one, from a guy who doesn't like sci-fi, and *he* said it was ""pretty good"".  I saw it on the big screen, and was very happy with it.  My daughter had only been exposed to ST:TNG, which she found ""boring"", ""dull"", and other worthwhile adjectives, and she adamantly did not want to see Star Trek.  She loved it, as did my wife, another fan of the original series.

This was a great Christmas gift, and I thoroughly appreciated it when watching it a second time at home.  Good effects, great story.  None of the characters were either over-the-top mimicry or all new ""improved"" versions of the old versions, just younger ones gaining the experience that underlies the classic characters.  Lots of stuff for new and old fans alike, with lots of nods to the original series, but you don't have to like, or even ever have watched, it in order to appreciate this movie.

I don't often say this, but you won't be disappointed one bit, and I, for one, look forward to ""Star Trek II"", whenever it comes out.",1261872000,2,1364,4.57201646090535
3472292,3,B001AVCFJM,"The Bottom Line:

Star Trek (the reboot) succeeds in that it establishes a group of likable characters set for their next adventure--I will absolutely be there for the sequel--but as a film it disappoints a bit; with its paradox-filled plot, padded running length, generic villains, and lack of any real subtext it's only noteworthy in what it sets up, not what it puts on screen.

However, I do know enough that this movie is definitely not a Star Trek movie.  J. J. Abrams has admitted to not understanding the concept of Star Trek and it definitely shows in his latest effort at entertainment.  The movie loses some of its Star Trek feel right out of the gate when you see the Starship Enterprise being built on the surface of the Earth.  As anyone should know, the ship was too large to be built anywhere but in orbit.  Nowhere would there be enough room on Earth.  And the movie continues to veer from the already established history of Star Trek.  Despite the poor showing for any relationship to Start Trek Cannon, this movie is a very good Sci-Fi flick.  There is non stop action, good characters and a decent story line.  Definitely watch it for this reason, not for Star Trek.  J. J.

3472298,4,B001AVCFJM,"This is a promising reboot of the Star Trek series, with the decided influence of JJ Abrams and friends. It's obviously hard to judge this one movie versus the existing Star Trek universe, but that's all we have for now.

Skylar-Spock definitely stole the show as he was/is ideally suited to play a young Spock. Not quite as logical as Spock Prime - having an affair with a student is quite illogical after all. But as attempt #1 and playing a younger Spock one could not ask for a better performance.

The rest of the characters need work in future movies before they establish themselves. New-Kirk was a bit too much 90210, New-Checkov was over-done with the geekery TNG-style, New-McCoy felt out of phase at times, and New-Sulu was not quite right. New-Uhura and New-Scottie are a step ahead of the rest of the main characters. Tyler Perry, talented and creative as he is, he was not very convincing as a high-ranking Star Fleet officer. It sort of stood out.

The other issue with the movie is that the villain du jour was actually not particularly impressive considering the grand stage. Other than the scary-looking space-ship, this was a typical TNG villain. The best they could come up with was an angry miner with a mining ship destroying the galaxy?

On the plus site, Abrams and Crew paid a lot of attention to a number of details from the original Star Trek universe, mini-homages to fans of TOS. Also very nice is the very efficient way they split the JJ Abrams Trek into a new timeline/reality, thus not risking the wrath of TOS fans. This clean-cut also opens up the possibility of more ""visitors"" from the original Trek timeline/reality in future movies without ""ruining"" TOS :)",1261785600,,1694,4.712837837837838

3472302,1,B001AVCFJM,"Well, why bother? The overwhelming opinion is that this film ""rocks"" or whatever exclamation seems appropriate. Yet, its financial numbers are that it barely broke even with domestic ticket sales. I can't help but wonder what is really going on? Is it hype, spite or...? Does it matter? maybe not. What does matter to me is that this film is Star Trek for the masses and it shows. Filled with typical Hollywood ""predictable irony"" and even ""cute"" characters, to me this was simply nothing more than Hollywood schlock. Star Trek has been many things and Roddenberry's disagreements over certain movies and their tones is well known to fans. It is a fact that Star Trek as ""Action Film"" (ala Wrath of Khan) helped re-spark its popularity in the early 80's and maybe that is what is happening here. Chiefly however, Star Trek has mostly been Science Fiction wearing the guise of Action to sell it to the viewer, this film is the opposite; an Action film wearing the guise of Science Fiction. The differences may be subtle but are important. Whatever ST:The Wrath of Khan was, it was at least loyal to the ideas and characters which created it. This movie is not. Gone is the sense of technological fetishism so pervasive in earlier incarnations. Gone is the framework of common-sense/logic based technologies, gone is any sense of realistic interstellar Navy. Gone is well... do I really need to go on? What is left is (like far too many Hollywood blockbusters now-a-days) Cotton Candy, colorful, sweet and fluffy but not much really there. This films looks somewhat familiar but for the wrong reasons. Watching it, I can't help but feel that everything was designed by the same company that designed my MP3 player. The battles felt far more like Star Wars than Star Trek. Is this Dawson's Trek or Star Creek? I had trouble deciding which. Maybe Alpha Centauri 90210 or Melrose Trek or ...

Back to my first line: Why bother? Because I (a huge fan of TOS) can't help but feel there is something wrong with this re-boot. That this is not the direction I would like to see it go. That J.J. Abrams (primarily an action guy)is the wrong person for the franchise and a feeling of regret that J. Michael Straczynski (a sci-fi guy) was not given the opportunity for his interpretation (you may or may not know he was in the running for handling this re-boot at one time).

With all of this said and because of the aforementioned Wrath of Khan, I must give any further Star Treks at least the chance of success but this one will not be in my collection and my hopes for any sequels remain dubious.",1261785600,23,2586,4.656455142231947

Something for the 21st Century that still amazes me, (sort of like seeing Caucasian actor's play Native-American Indians, or Jewish-White vaudevillian's putting on the dark face comedy routines...unsavory).
I also couldn't understand the emotional relationship between Uhura and Spock, or the film's conclusion of Spock's mother...all which makes it disconnected from the original series and Gene Roddenberry's creation.

Usually, these Star Trek films are pretty bad stuff. I turned my eyes up to the promos for this one. It looked like a ""Kids of Star Trek"" sort of thing. It's pretty good.

I find it questionable that they used such a technologically-advanced background (ships, primarily) for what was occurring in the past. The old Star Trek episodes provided many views of Commander Pike's days. The main plot was developed nicely, & plays well w/some surprises thrown in. Well done.

The idea that Kirk right out of the academy at the start of the flick is put in command of the Federation's newest and most high tech flagship by the end of the movie was bad enough, but the manufactured, contrived story line to put Lenard Nimoy back in time by destroying his home planet reminded me of the lame Star Trek movie ""Generations"". The high point performances in the movie were the characters of Uhura, Scotty and especially Dr Mckoy....the rest of the performances were seriously out of character to the point of stupidity. (Could Spock have been played as a bigger weenier?)Really JJ, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST HAVE THE GUTS TO MAKE YOUR OWN UNIVERSE? The large, cavernous insides of a ship that is made to travel in space, go into battle and seal itself again hull breaches was retarded as also the were pop gun phasers used. Some sets in the movie, most notable the engineering scene, looked like they were put together in the same way as the old 1960's made for TV ""Batman"" sets. The Plot again was so predictable as to be embarrassing to watch. Yet the movie made money...so there will no doubt be another.. and after the sad Next Generations movies... well , even this JJ Abrams production looks ..well, no THAT bad.",1261612800,13,1542,4.5503597122302155

The special effects help the ""huh"" quickly disappear.  Not wanting to spoil it for those considering a purchase, let me say that those who enjoy a movie with lots of action, comedy and special effects should buy this movie!  It reminds me of Indiana Jones in space.  Star Trek purists may find some things disagreable but that's to be expected.

Not sure if it's supposed to burn a copy of the movie to my hardrive, or just the ""background info"" like games, actor info, etc. For me, there wasn't enough info about THAT disc, but that COULD be my own technological ignorance.

It was very annoying and it is hard to believe that the filmmakers allowed this to happen, so I wonder if it was a flaw in the Bluray or the very recording I received.  Anyone else notice this?  I did not see the moving in a theater.

I did, however, very much like the movie and think the new Spock is a great choice and probably the toughest to have gotten right.  Uhura is great, too, and Bones is Bones.  Kirk might turn out ok and so may Scotty, but can't tell from this movie.  I really liked Chekov and I think Sulu is also a good choice.  Seeing him its hard to remember who the original was.

Some you can chalk up to artistic license, others, well . . . not so much.  Beyond those little distractions I really enjoyed the movie.  I think I'll send J.J.

Disc 1 contains the movie and the only thing I really would have wanted to see would have been an extended version that included the deleted scenes.  No such luck though.

While the special effects, the sets and most of the actors (except for Uhura and Scotty) were well-cast for their roles, the story line was horrible.  A trite good vs. evil villan (named Nero, no less), and some really improbable things that would never happen in a Star Trek story (Spock would never jettison Kirk in a space pod and strand him on an ice planet - against Starfleet regulations), makes this a real bomb.

3472344,5,B001AVCFJM,"Great movie, even for an original Trekie. I guess since the last time we saw Spock as a character in the franchise, he was alive and working with the Romulins for peace, I guess it made sense to have him as the link to the ""old"" characters.  And you can tell that he is playing an ""old"" character. Being 50, and working on the ""old"" label myself, it was quite nostalgic to have at least one link to TOS.  Too bad that the series didn't pick up on Shatner's version of the Trek universe, by following the story lines that brought him back after his encounter with the Nexus. But even in his story line, he was resurrected as a younger Kirk, and the ""old"" Shatner would not have worked. So, I guess that is why they couldn't find a way of writing the character into the ""young"" crew version.

Anyway, the movie itself is great and does not dissappoint, and the characters are strong and seem much deeper than those presented in TOS. Its cool to see how and why Kirk has his swagger and Spock, his struggle with his Vulcan/Human heritage.  But the Spock/Uhura romance is just a little over-the-top.  And where is nurse Chapel.

3472349,5,B001AVCFJM,"I'm old enough to have watched the original TV series in the 60s (on our first color TV). I thoroughly enjoyed this re-take on the original using the same main characters.

I have to admit I didn't quite follow the logic behind the new story line until I watched the movie for the second time on DVD, but once I plugged in to the fact that the elder Spock's time trip took us into an alternate reality with the same characters, I bought in wholeheartedly. (Ahhh, it all makes sense now...)

I had no serious complaints about the new characterizations; in fact, knowing the history of the original Trek made it more fun to see how the new story line gave a new take on them. Ben Cross was excellent as Sarek (""I married your mother...because I loved her"" made a lot more sense than ""it seemed logical"", as spoken in the original), as was Zachary Quinto as Spock; and seeing Spock's ongoing struggle to suppress his natural emotions, especially with a love interest, seemed much more realistic than the original.

Simon (Run Fat Boy Run) Pegg and John (Harold and Kumar Go To/Escape From...) Cho as Scotty and Sulu were just plain fun to watch. But in my view, the big prize goes to Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy. More than any other actor in the new Trek, I felt he captured the essence of Bones without being a caricature of DeForest Kelly. He even managed to change his appearance to the point where he didn't even look like the same guy I've seen in several other movies.

I would have been disappointed if they had tried too hard to be exactly like the original series, because of course it couldn't be done.

The actors were very well cast to keep to the original characters, with enough change to make this movie its own version.  Purists will always get grumpy over any changes; don't listen to them.  The plot has some holes in it, but when has a movie NOT had a few holes in the plot?  Sure, Nero could have gone a different direction instead of becoming a sci fi serial killer. He let his anger cause him to make very bad choices, which happens a lot in real life too.

3472354,5,B001AVCFJM,"In a Pulp Fiction deleted scene Mia asks Vincent if he's an Elvis or Beatles man. The idea is that while you can enjoy both bands, you're always going to be bigger fan of one than you are of the other. I find this to be a true assessment (and this will probably not be the last time I use this reference), and explains the way I feel about Star Trek and Star Wars. I have always been a bigger fan of Star Wars, although this is kind of a faulty assessment considering that Star Wars is more fantasy, and Star Trek is more science fiction. Having said that, I had no intention of seeing Star Trek when it was first announced. That was before I heard that TV mogul JJ Abrams (Lost, Alias, Fringe, etc.) was going to be directing the film. Only his second feature film as director, JJ Abrams cut his teeth by making the best film in the Mission Impossible franchise (Mission Impossible III) and was then handed the keys to one of the biggest and most loved TV/ Movie franchises in history. So how does a TV mogul do when given a franchise of this magnitude to reboot?

After the destruction of their home planet, a group of Romulans on a mining ship led by Nero (Eric Bana) travels back in time through a black hole to the year 2233 while following Spock (Leonard Nimoy). In the ensuing confrontation Nero destroys USS Kelvin, which also kills George Kirk, James T. Kirk's father, forever altering the Star Trek timeline. The movie chronicles the rise of Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), and how Spock (Zachary Quinto), Bones (Karl Urban), Scotty (Simon Pegg), and the rest of the USS Enterprise crew come together.

 With Mission Impossible III, JJ Abrams might have created the best film in the franchise, but you could still tell that he stuck in the world of the hour long TV drama. While amazing, Mission still felt almost like it would be more at home on the small screen rather than on the big screen. With Star Trek you never get that feeling. Abrams builds a world that feels lived in, while using a somewhat shaky cam, not nearly as shaky as Cloverfield which he produced, but shaky in a way that makes you feel as though you are there with the crew as you watch it.

Writers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (Mission Impossible III, Transformer 1 and 2, Legend of Zorro, etc.) also create the best feature screenplay of their careers. Taking cues from back Star Trek stories to add in an effort to give references to past Trek stories. They also build fully realized characters from off the page rather than just expecting the characters to build them themselves like they've done in past screenplays (here's looking at you Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen).

The truth is, this all wouldn't be effective without the proper people to play the roles. I honestly thought it was impossible to replace the original actors, was I wrong! Chris Pine (taking his cues from Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones rather than from William Shatner's portrayal of James T. Kirk) shines as Kirk, making him rebellious, brilliant, and fun. Karl Urban (Lord of the Rings) creates a Bones that is hard, hilarious, and funny. Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) is hilarious as always. But, besides Chris Pine, the real star here is Zachary Quinto (Heroes). Zachary Quinto really shines showing the turmoil brewing beneath the logical exterior of Spock. We really feel his issues of coming to terms with being half human/ half Vulcan while also dealing with his romanticism towards Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and being bested in the program he created, the Kobayashi Maru, by James T. Kirk.

If there is an issue, it would be the action. Don't get me wrong, the action was shot amazingly, but for fans of the franchise (all you Trekkers out there) it might be a bit too much. It feels like Star Wars in a Star Trek wrapping, which is great for new viewers, but might alienate old viewers of the franchise. Also in recent years, when going up against villains like Joker from The Dark Knight and Anton Chigurh from No Country From Old Men, Nero from Star Trek really feels, well, kinda weak. But, as a reboot, the movie had more responsibility to build existing characters than new characters that won't last beyond this ""episode"" in the series. Also, there's been a lot of talk of ""plot holes"". I honestly take no stock in the ""holes"" left in the story as I feel most of these are from die hard Trek fans, and I can explain them away with simple explanations. There are several moments that seem to come out of nowhere (i.e. James T. Kirk running into Spock randomly on a space planet after being exiled from the USS Enterprise) but these are moments that naturally happen in science fiction, and fantasy, as a rule to a certain extent.

All in all I would highly recommend this addition to the Star Trek series and this part has also gotten me interested in the rest of the series. Who knows, maybe as other parts of this series come on DVD I will review them here. Until then, definitely give this a try, it was, by far, one of the most entertaining films of 2009!

But boy was I wrong. I watched this movie and cheered it as if I was at a sporting event. It is nothing short of a incredible vision of Star Trek. The old characters we are all so familiar with shown to us as 'kids' yet it is so clear who they will grow up to be. The special effects are breathtaking, the pacing will take your breath away.

I was really expecting some reversal at the end. However, let's see what new surprises the sequel will bring. Anyway, I like the new actors, the new Enterprise, and the new approach, just dislike the destruction of everything else we were used to as Star Trek fans.

3472359,1,B001AVCFJM,"There are a few holes in the plot that would be hard to close.

I'll ignore the question of why the Vulcans loaded Spock's ship with a huge ball of red material (looks like ~1m in diameter, or ~500 liters), when only a droplet is needed.

I'll ignore the question of why Nero is the last of his race. If the Romulans knew their planet is about to be destroyed, I would expect them to send away as many people as possible.

OK, Nero has seen his planet & culture destroyed. By some miracle, he returns 129 years back in time. Then he waits 25 years, and the tool with which he could save Romulus falls into his hands. What does Nero choose to do ?

Give the Romulans some red matter, so they could save themselves in a hundrend years ?

Go home and enjoy the company of his own race ?

Give his race technology which allows to arm a single mining ship with weapons that can destroy an armada of star fleet ships ?

No, no, and no. He goes to destroy Vulcan and the federation on his own, ignoring Romulus & it's fate. How logical of him !",1261180800,48,1037,4.103960396039604

3472361,4,B001AVCFJM,"I thought this was a pretty good trek, not the best, but not the worst by any stretch.  I guess I should tell you what type and level of trekkie I am.  I'm 29, and as a kid, I absolutely LOVED the original series and the Shatner/Nimoy/Kelly/etc movies.  I enjoyed the next generation as well, though I thought it was a little sterile, at least at first.  Eventually in the later seasons of TNG the stories and characters became much more interesting to me.  I thought Generations was OK, and First Contact was outstanding.  The last couple Trek movies, Insurrection and Nemesis I thought were pretty much unwatchable.  I never could stand DS9, or Enterprise, and I'm pretty much nauseous watching Voyager.  For me, Star Trek jumped the space shark a long, long time ago.

All that being said, I don't need to rehash all of the timeline complaints, JJ not knowing enough about Star Trek, etc.  When I watch this movie, I really see the spirit of the original series here.  I still watch the old series quite a bit, and some of those old episodes really play hell with the characters and story.  There are episodes where it seems Spock, Kirk, and McCoy ALL hate each other, especially in season 3, for whatever reason.  This movie is fast paced, and to my mind, very similar to Gene's original vision of a ""wagon train to the stars.""  It's action packed, simple, silly, and fun, which is EXACTLY what Star Trek ORIGINALLY was, in my own opinion based off years of watching and loving the old series.  I'm not taking away from anyone else's negative feelings on this film and it's shuffling of characters and canon. I can see why some wouldn't like this, and that's fine.  In my view, I say - whatever, it's just nice to see a Star Trek film that doesn't suck back on the big screen.  And kudos to JJ for making Star Trek cool, as for the first time in my life I'm not embarrassed to say I like Star Trek.

There are plenty of aspects to this film that show a real care for the subject matter.  Karl Urban in particular delivers a knock-out rendition of Bones.  Karl is apparently a huge Star Trek fan with a deep respect and admiration for DeForest Kelly, and it really shows that he took the time to channel the exact character that Kelly created, right down to the speech patterns, timing, accent, and facial expressions.

Spock/Uhura - eh, I thought that was too much, and kind of lame, but like I said, I remember stuff like this happening in the original series all the time.  Red Matter - so big deal there's no explanation.  Who needs one, really?  Red Matter... just another in a long line of good old fashioned Star Trek plot devices - dilitium, slingshot-around-the-sun, pencil-lead-whale-speaking-soccer-ball-probe, planet-wide eco-system creating torpedos, V-Ger, 100 deck turboshafts, Tribbles, Katras, shape-shifters, mind-melds... I could go on forever.  There's always silly stuff in these things.  It's fun.  I thought destroying Vulcan was unnecessary, but I didn't personally know any of those future aliens, so I'm okay with it.  If you have a deep emotional investment in Trek, you might perhaps think the types of things depicted in Trek will happen in the future.  Think of this then: will anyone in 2309 be watching a movie or a TV show made in 1966 or 2009?

It's a pretty good Star Trek with a few (as usual) flaws.  The only reason it is getting so picked apart is because in this internet day and age every Joe Trek can log on and speak their mind.  Use to be we just had to take Gene Shallot's or Roger Ebert's word for it.  There's my two cents.",1261094400,2,3573,4.585173501577287

But the digital copy process (for Windows) downloaded two WMV versions of the film to my computer, one for the computer, and a smaller ""portable"" version. But both files are rigged not to copy (it generates a bogus error). So the portable version cannot be copied to my portable device (a Windows Mobile phone). So the whole thing is useless.

Star Trek delivers an exceptional 2 hours full of action, excitement, great acting and superb special effects. The hope for this movie exceeded completely. From start to finish I was hooked and enjoyed every second of it.

The special effects are amazing, just like anyone would of assumed obviously upgrading from the tv series and from the previous movies. The plot itself was great for a sci-fi film and was very well written (I am not going to discuss the plot since everybody should know by now what's it about#. The acting is what probably shocked me the most and surpassed any expectations I had. Captain James Kirk and Spock were delivered in such a high performance from Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto (respectively) as they fitted perfectly for their roles, as well with the rest of the cast. No one should have any complaints about the actors interpretation.

So indeed, highly recommended film and to be in anyone's possesion that are into sci-fi and most of all action movies. I can see myself playing this on my blu-ray every once in a while.",1261008000,,1283,4.4743589743589745

Not only is it visually intriguing, but the character development, plot line and fun references to the original series are all top notch.

Heck, I was embarrassed to tell anyone that I had a copy of Nemesis.  This one is near-perfect!

Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Simon Pegg (sp?) are perfectly cast.  Bones' replacement has the look and the vocal intonation down to a fine science (sorry - have forgotten the actor's name and am too lazy to look it up).

Naturally, when the movie came out, he wanted to go see it, so I said I'd go with him even though I had major reservations.  I knew nothing about Star Trek other than what pop culture references had taught me.  To my great pleasure, it didn't matter.  The movie started at the beginning and told me everything I needed to know as it progressed.  I'm sure there were some references made that only those who have followed the show would catch, but I found it highly entertaining despite my extremely limited knowledge.

They use the same old horse they always ride to get them there too, time travel.  So tired of that in the Trek universe.  Anyway.  Once I got past my initial disappointment and just started watching it for what it was, I did enjoy it.

However, as said by others, the packaging and certificate is a bit cheesy.  Nothing special about the box to keep or even display the Enterprise, and the certificate isn't numbered, so there can be more than 5000 sets out there.

I'd rate it another star if the packaging was better, the ship was bigger, or the price was lower.  So the question is: would you spend another $70+ for a metal Enterprise replica??",1260921600,,584,4.462264150943396
3472392,4,B001AVCFJM,"I am not a hardcore Trekkie. I used to be, back in the day. I've seen every episode of the original series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager and tolerated most every episode of Enterprise before I lost interest. I own a few of the DVDs, including all the good movies, and I do watch them from time-to-time. But I'm not obessed, like I used to be. I no longer own any of the novels, for example, and can't remember the last time I attended a Trek-specific convention.

But I do still enjoy the show. Like I said, I have some of the episodes on DVD as well as the good movies, and I have a few episodes downloaded onto my 360. I mention all of this so that you know where I am coming from in my review of this, the 11th film in the series. Sort of.

For all the continuity whores out there, let's get this out of the way now: this is not the same universe as the regular Trek reality. It's made very clear about halfway into the film that since the opening credits we've been in an alternate reality. If you, like me, start wondering why the Farragut is launching without Kirk on board, don't worry; it just happened differently in this reality. Same with certain larger events that clearly never happened in the continuity that we're used to. If you're a hardcore fan of the series, keep this in mind and you'll be ok.

For the rest of you, yeah, you'll have a good time, I think. There's plenty of action and a feeling quite different from any of the other movies or TV shows in the series. The acting by everyone is top-notch, particlarly Zachary (Spock) Quinto and Karl (McCoy) Urban. The plot is at times a little iffy (centering around this movies Khan wanna-be as he sets out for revenge against Spock), but that's ok. It accomplishes what it set out to do, and that's good enough.

This is a far from perfect movie. It features way too much action and not nearly enough of the emotional and scientific core that made Trek such a great program. The villain isn't much of much, and most of the lower-tier characters don't really have a lot to do. There's also a very unnecessary romance between a couple of the characters that I did not care for.

But that said, there's a lot in this movie to enjoy. Rather like Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica, they've kept a lot of what works and, if nothing else it does do a great job of getting all the pieces on the board for the next film in the series, meaning that the franchise shall, once again, live long and... oh, I just can't bring myself to type that.

3472394,4,B001AVCFJM,"The original series nearly always depicted 'humanity"" in a positive way, still learning and hopeful. What a concept.

This ""New"" crew has that same potential yet uses far more in the way of special effects to raise the obsession for ""Wow"" desired by today's theater audiences. BTW, the effects are spectacular, somewhat overdone than necessary, but that sells tickets to potential new fans of this venerable series.

J.J. Abrams and crew tried and accomplished to save the ""canons' as they adhered to in the film and in the extras disk. A very good thing to keep fans like myself happy as straying far afield would have been less than satisfactory. I found the ""extras"" disk to be as entertaining as any I have seen in quite some time.

The new/old crew, for the most part, did a wonderful job. Casting was nearly impeccable. My only slight gripe was the writing for Dr. McCoy. A tad over the top, but I may be alone in this assessment. As the characters/actors have time to meld into a cohesive unit, they could become as popular as any Star Trek iteration to date.

On the technical side, the BD disk is impeccable. Saturated with just enough color, the use of real film does help, The inky blacks are portrayed well on a display capable of handling them. The sound effects and score fit the image, especially with a properly calibrated system. It is probably better at home than in most theater's. At least those I sometimes frequent with their blown drivers and indiscriminate setups.

I enjoyed the film and I'm of the age to remember waiting for the evenings when the original series ran. For new viewers of Star Trek, you shouldn't be disappointed by having a copy of this in your film library.

3472404,5,B001AVCFJM,"First off this is actually the first Star Trek Move i have seen all the way threw. I was a fan of Star Trek:The Next Generation and Voyager. The First time I saw Star Trek was in Iraq when i was over seas for about a year. Though the move was free, I wouldn't mind if I had to pay to see it. The action is great as well as the acting. This film showed no sign of slowing down, and when it was over I wanted more. At a little over 2hr my only flaw with the film is that it was to short. Like the lord of the rings films, I never felt like this film was dragging. All the guys that gave this film a bad review are(to my opinion)nitpicking. Most are hating on some plot holes that are explained in the prequel comic book.  This is by far the best film I've seen since The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, now all that is left is to wait for the sequel.",1260835200,,843,3.817142857142857

3472420,4,B001AVCFJM,"Talk about taking the hard way. Director JJ Abrams could have done a million things for a Star Trek film. He could have continued the ""Next Generation"" films- plenty to milk there-. He could have started a brand new film franchise from the plethora of other quality spin-offs available like Deep Space Nine, Voyager or Enterprise. Instead he went to the source: The original series, and virtually re-created the franchise from the ground up. Not only was this ambitious but to some virtually impossible. Fans prepared for the worst. This is not some run-of-the-mill show. This is Star Trek! How do you change what millions on trekkies(trekkers?) and more casual (read:less obsessed) fans have come to know and love for decades now? Well, the answer is 2009's Star Trek. A film that manages to please not only the faithful but also draws in the rest of the movie-going audience as well. This little gem of a film has now made it to our homes in the form of a gem of a Blu-Ray package.

First the film itself:

As I asked in my statement above: How do you please the millions of fans of this franchise? On a re-make of all things?! Well, the answer seems to be: Go for extreme ""geekness"". (I use the word with respect. After all I consider myself one) Unlike other re-makes that completely ignore previous entries and start from zero(Batman Begins comes to mind), Star Trek goes around this problem by using time travel -a very common plot device used in the series- to basically maintain the legacy of the original series while creating a brand new beggining for the current crew. Yes, its still Kirk and Spock and the gang but its an ""alternate"" reality. Completely seperate from the original canon. I don't want to go into details and spoil it but it boils down to this: Those who want to give over-think the issue (as many sci-fi fans do) will have the oportunity to do so while for the casual fan, it will simply be a little detail that won't interfere with the enjoyment of the film.

And speaking of the casual movie fan, they are in for a treat. Star Trek is a great film. It is well written and acted. The pacing is just right in my opinion and manages to introduce all the characters without feeling like they rushed it. Like in the original series, the relationship between Kirk and Spock is front and center but somehow it feels fresh. A lot of that has to do with Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine giving a much needed edge to what we already know and love. In fact all the actors here seem to bring something new while paying homage to the actors that played the roles before them. Two exceptions though: Karl Urban seemed to have been posessed by the ghost of DeForest Kelley. His portrayal of ""Bones"" McCoy is downright creepy in how Urban got every single twitch and mannerism right. Also, I found the guy playing Chekov annoying but it might just be me as I also didn't care for the actor in Terminator: Salvation.

This is a great film that appeals to both the fans and those looking for a good movie to watch. While the film is filled details and moments that the faithful will go nuts over, you don't have to know squat about Star Trek to simply sit down and enjoy the film. Certainly one of the top films of 2009.

Now for the Blu-Ray transfer:

It's fitting that this is one the top films 2009 because quite simply this is one of the best Blu-Ray releases of 2009 as well. Paramount not only delivered an amazing transfer of the film but put in a worthy package with great extras and the quickly-becoming-the-norm digital copy for good measure.

The transfer is nearly flawless. The future certainly looks bright in HD. The set design of the film is clinically pristine. Everything looks new and shiny. You seem to be able to eat from any surface. This has carried over well to HD, where the whitest of white bridge of the USS Enterprise clashes with the intense primary colors of the uniforms worn by the crew. Speaking of which, the textures in the fabrics of said uniforms-basically the differing addition to the classic uniforms- is clearly visible. It's that level of visible detail that you can expect throughout the film. Thanks to this fact I can honestly say I enjoyed the film more watching it the second time in my home than the first time in the movie theater. The visuals in this film simply come to life in this Blu-Ray. My favorite scene is the Enterprise rising out of an inky-red mist. Without a doubt my favorite ""wow"" moment.

The extras go deep into the creation of the film and covers the entire second disc of this release. Here fans can explore to their heart's content what went into the film and what didn't but most importantly the why's. Every decision has a reason behind it and this is where the extra content really shines in my opinion.

This realease is really a triple threat: A film that will appeal to fans, non-fans AND HD aficionados alike. I highly recommend it.",1260748800,,4917,4.5343855693348365
3472421,5,B001AVCFJM,"One of the best Start Trek movies I have seen. Fast paced & captivating from the first frame. A well made movie overall. I am hoping that we will see more of the ""new"" Kirk & Spock in the coming future!",1260748800,,202,3.951219512195122

Very little of the canon was violated.  The franchise was extended in an innovative and truly ""Star Trek"" way.  This alternate history has opened the show up to new movies and a new audience.

3472429,5,B001AVCFJM,"- Captain Pike to surly young townie Jim Kirk: ""Your father was captain of a starship for twelve minutes. He saved eight hundred lives, including your mother's - and yours. I dare you to do better.""

This is neither your grandpa's Star Trek nor the Trekkies' or Trekkers' traditional Star Trek. J.J. Abram's STAR TREK is instead a reinventing of the classic characters and their universe, and if you could accept that their adventures don't at all undermine past continuity - that this instead is a wholly new and separate continuity, parallel to the old one - then this film might become your Star Trek. It doesn't replace as much as add a new layer to what's gone on before. It certainly revitalizes the franchise.

The genesis lies in the original Star Trek universe. Something there happens on a cataclysmic level which then triggers an alternate timeline. In this new reality, James T. Kirk grows up without a father to inspire him, and the malcontent boy grows into a cocky, rebellious young local townie who, the morning after a life-altering bar brawl, enrolls into Starfleet Academy. As the movie unfolds, we learn that while this Kirk may be more bitter and resentful than the original, he's still the same audacious, take-charge Iowan we'd long ago propped on a pedestal. James T. Kirk is still THE man.

This ranks among the best Star Trek films, in terms of escapism and of sheer high adventure. It's just a fun movie, and I think a smart move by the franchise's think tank. Most of the actors previously involved with past incarnations of Star Trek are become old fogies, or as near as. New blood was definitely required, and really if one weren't gonna do a Starfleet Academy series, then why not go back to the source but with a new spin? Shatner, Nimoy, and the rest are so linked with the characters they made iconic that, really, a parallel reality was the best route to take. It allows a new generation of actors to have breathing room and to establish their own marks on these same characters. Having said that, I'm very happy that we're treated to an extended cameo by a familiar face from the original universe.

J.J. Abrams makes this picture an exhilarating one, and action-packed. Maybe he's saving the more cerebral elements and the human drama for the sequels. But this STAR TREK celebrates the new cast, most of whom are terrific, several seemingly out of left field. There's really nothing to say about Zachary Quinto, other than this whole enterprise (heh) would have collapsed if he weren't around. In looks and demeanor, he does really great interpreting a young Spock. Chris Pine makes all the right choices as the new James T. Kirk. He could've effed this up royally by mimicking Shatner's mannered cadence, except that he mostly stays away from this. Pine puts in his own spin, and yet still captures the same spirit and swagger of the good captain. Once in a while, though, either with a pronounced delivery of a line or with a subtle movement, Pine does channel his inner Shatner, as a homage and just to give us a for old time's sake. This guy won me over quick.

Rating the other actors: Karl Urban is the shocking surprise here, and I think he walks away with the best performance. His Dr. McCoy is absolutely spot-on, wonderfully crabby and gruff; he perfectly evokes the mannerisms of DeForest Kelley. I didn't think he had it in him, and I'm digging his chemistry with Chris Pine. Smoking hot Zoe Saldana comes in the room and her fiercely intelligent Uhura is, if anything, even more strong-willed than Nichelle Nichol's. While I enjoyed Simon Pegg and Anton Yelchin's respective versions of Scotty and the 17-year-old Chekov, their performances are juuuust a shade over-the-top. But I just don't see John Cho as Sulu. Maybe it's because I keep waiting for Sulu to go looking for a White Castle. Anyway, the core actors show really good chemistry, and if you check out the special features, you can tell they're having a blast spending time with each other. The future looks very good for upcoming sequels.

Another cool thing is that the big crisis is met head on by a group of untested cadets, and this sets up that sense of ""Wow, they really are starting over."" We see the initial interactions of the celebrated Enterprise crew, but again this is a new universe and some things have changed. Just some examples: This movie posits that Kirk and Spock first met thru the infamous Kobayashi Maru incident, and theirs is an instant rivalry. We learn the roots of Dr. McCoy's nickname. And an unexpected romance blossoms.

The villains, meh. I'm not ever keen on Romulans as the Big Bad. In relation to Vulcans, Romulans are kind of like those embarrassing relatives you don't talk about, you know, the ones who live on the mountains and generally have a working TV sitting on top of a broken TV. The first appearance of their starship, all bristly and smacking of aggression, is promising and is properly menacing. But then it went downhill once I realized that it was manned by Romulans. It doesn't help that Eric Bana's role of rogue Romulan villain Nero (not cool with that name, either) comes off as underdone and seems to be there just to service the plot.

This 2-disc DVD set, the special features: On Disc 1: the filmmakers' nerdy cool commentary (Director J.J. Abrams, Exec. Producer Bryan Burk, Writers/Producers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and Producer Damon Lindelof); a gag reel (worth it alone for the final outtake with Pine and Quinto affecting some weird Ikea accent); and the Making Of featurette ""A New Vision.""

On Disc 2: ""To Boldly Go"" - a segment going even deeper behind the scenes, focusing a bit more on the filmmaking process, as well as the crew's further reflections on classic Trek; in-depth featurettes on the ""Casting,"" ""Aliens,"" and the ""Score""; nine deleted scenes, some of which do flesh out the story, and all with optional director/producers commentary: ""Spock Birth,"" ""Klingons Take Over Narada,"" ""Young Kirk, Johnny and Uncle Frank,"" ""Amanda and Sarek Argue After Spock Fights,"" ""Prison Interrogation and Breakout,"" ""Sarek Gets Amanda,"" ""Dorm Room and Kobayashi Maru (Original Version)"" - this one details just how Kirk cheated on the test, ""Kirk Apologizes to the Green Girl"" (funny), and ""Sarek Sees Spock."" Disc 2 contains the STAR TREK D-A-C free game trial for XBox 360 - just pop the disc into your XBox 360 and follow the prompts; and for a digital copy of the film, Disc 2 can also be inserted into your computer's DVD-ROM or BD-ROM drive.

Some things never change, nor should they. The core personalities are intact, and this is never more true than the qualities which make Jim Kirk so iconic. The purpose of the Kobayashi Maru challenge is to instill fear into Starfleet officers so that they can accept and prepare for the possibility of defeat. But that philosophy is simply antithesis to the defiant make-up of Kirk's character. In whatever incarnation, Kirk is all about beating the odds. He simply doesn't believe in no-win situations. And another staple of the franchise to survive: When Pike assigns Kirk, Sulu, and some no-hoper named Engineer Olsen on a high risk mission, and then you glimpse Engineer Olsen sporting that red uniform, well, you instantly know his odds for survival just dropped to a big, fat nil. And I guess, in whatever universe, Kirk will end up macking with a green-skinned hottie from Orion. And, oh yeah, as a last desperate bid for survival, the go-to move will always be that old ""eject the warp core"" ploy.

Now some dubious stuff: I guess the sequence with Kirk as a kid was necessary to demonstrate just how angry he was in his formative years, but, man, this kid was really unlikable. I don't quite buy that Vulcan kids will resort to baiting to test young Spock's devotion to emotionless logic. Vulcans do have emotions, yeah, but I thought they were too well trained from the outset to demonstrate such bullying behavior. And it's a bit convenient that Scotty, newly arrived on the Enterprise, would so promptly be put in charge of engineering. It's also stretching things a bit that Kirk would get marooned on an ice planet and then end up meeting... someone. But the fan boy factor is so high on this last one that it's really easy to give it a pass.

This may be the funniest Star Trek flick since STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME. The running hypo-spray gag between Bones and Kirk is sweet. And, lastly, a friendly hint to all would be destroyers/conquerors of the universe: dudes, quit messing about with other planets. Just go and hit Earth first. You inevitably end up there, anyway, and then the Enterprise finds a way to dump on you.

Apropos of nothing, this flick reminds me quite a bit of Della Van Hise's 1985 Star Trek novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Killing-Time-Star-Trek-No-24/dp/0671524887/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Killing Time (Star Trek, No 24)</a>, which also features an alternate history, with Romulans as the villains, Kirk a bitter young officer and Spock as the Enterprise's Captain. Maybe something worth checking out, to hold you over while waiting on the sequel.",1260662400,3,9179,4.846301020408164
3472430,5,B001AVCFJM,"This movie manages to somewhat renew the good old Star Trek saga while remaining very close to the original in spirit. We see how the crew of the Enterprise comes together almost by chance. The story relies heavily on Spock for once: in addition to a spelndidly acted young Spock we get Leonard Nimoy who comes along as well. The plot is well-written, the acting good and the special effects are first rate. It fits completely well within the regular storyline except for the destruction of Vulcan. We get tosee Romulans which were my favorite villains in the series. Again we have a more diversified and international crew than we did have on the later series, where the crew was more homogeneously north american. While the latter series were by no means bad, the presence of Uhura, Chekhov, MacCoy and Sulu gave the series a very special flavor that could not really be replaced by the often very varied alien species one would regularly encounter on the later series. Also, they have managed to recreate the freshness that the first series had and which was often lacking from TNG. Anyway this is a great movie.",1260662400,,1115,4.723076923076923

3472435,3,B001AVCFJM,"I can recall one of the authors of Star Trek novels advising reader wannabes that if they want to write, don't jump on board the existing Star Trek thing--if you're going to write a story, also create the concept. That struck me initially as a ""this turf is taken, get yourself your own"" type of exclusivism. And I found myself resenting the disparaging reference to the first Star Trek feature film as ""Star Trek: the Slow Motion Picture"" as coming from the audience that would have done better sticking with Ah-nold, Vin Diesel or ID-2 and other videogame-oriented ""adventures"" like that. So with the realization that today's filmmaking is really aimed at meth heads or those intimidated into emulating them, I tried to take this film on its own merits. You know, like people who like to find fault with others but approach what they themselves believe in as sacred and criticism of it as blasphemy insist that you do or you're narrow-minded. Guilty of thought-crime in the full Orwellian sense of the term. But come on--the entire crew of the Enterprise as first conceived by Roddenberry weren't all from the same Academy grad class. And Kirk might have been the youngest captain ever in Starfleet, but he wasn't a rookie fresh out of the Academy, having been given the Center Seat as one of the rewards for a specific act of heroism. Is there anybody left who remembers how Captain Pike was in ""The Menagerie""? In such bad shape that he had to use a beeper to say yes or no? And Kirk first-named him like he was a contemporary still with the rank of Captain? In this film, ""Admiral Pike"" is at the awards ceremony in a wheelchair but seems pleasant and alert. So by the time of ""The Menagerie"" his health has deteriorated and he cops a ""medical demotion""? Call me a purist if you like, but this ""ancient history"" I'm using as a yardstick of comparison is still available on DVD in a box set. Captain Kirk as described in Star Trek's ""history"" may be a superlative, heroic officer, but the real-life Admiral Nimitz paid some dues as a junior officer. Any kind of writer is supposed to do his homework, especially if ""archival material"" is as easily available as Star Trek's is.",1260576000,2,2180,4.635658914728682
3472436,3,B001AVCFJM,Typical of hollywood in these times. Special effects and mediocre acting. Once again it is shown that you cannot remake a legendary IP. When will hollywood do something original? If you are a collector and its the only one missing from your collection then buy it if you must and watch it if you dare. This one was most certainly not made for Star Trek fans.,1260576000,,358,4.4393939393939394

And this Star Trek movie really touched on all the things I love about the tv episodes!  If you don't know the show that well, then there are many things about the movie, characters & lines that you won't ""get"" as they reference so many aspects of the tv show.  That doesn't mean that you won't like the movie though!  It has lots of great action, amazing scenes, great dialog, and character development.  And it's a movie that I like to watch over & over again.",1260576000,3,596,4.238938053097345
3472438,5,B001AVCFJM,"As a life-long Trekkie, starting with TOS(the original series to non-Trekkies) my anticipation for this movie was tinged with apprehension. With all new actors, director,etc. the possibility of messing up the whole idea of Star Trek and the relationship between the main characters seemed a real liklihood. I was immensely pleased that did not happen. The young actors playing Kirk, Spock, and McCoy nailed the personalities of their characters. I enjoyed this movie tremendously, seeing it first at the theater,then watching it again on the DVD. The funny outtakes and commentary on the Dvd are a bonus. Looking forward to the next ST movie!",1260576000,3,642,5.1826923076923075
3472439,5,B001AVCFJM,"I will start off with stating that I was NEVER a fan of Star Trek! I had so many friends that followed the series and then consequently the movies but I never had an interest in it. I had a very basic knowledge of the characters or props known for this series but I could not tell you about episode 7, scene 19........yeah I just made that up! So when this movie came up I won't say I was one of the millions that was anxiously waiting to see it! But nonetheless I have always had a weakness for prequels because you do get to find out how characters developed and in this case Iconic characters that have stood the test of time, so I CAN tell you that I was a little curious. The movie was released on the big screen and it came and it went and I never saw it, in spite of so many recommending it! So here comes the home release of it and being a huge fan of special effects and quality sound and the whole business of ""Blu-Ray"" I was ready to start reading reviews of this movie as soon as they were available and they were all very favorable. So I decided that I was going to dive in head first and just straight purchase this bad boy!! Well I did and I can tell you the water is more than fine, it is absolutely amazing! The video capture of this movie is spectacular! The sound is ground shaking and crisp, and the story line of the movie was very cool and with my very minimal knowledge of all that is Star Trek, I was able to enjoy the characters that I was somewhat familiar with and most of all I was fascinated with the root of the friendship between Kirk and Spock. It seems like they got all the perfect young actors to fit all the main rolls! All and all the movie was amazing in the Blu-Ray format and I wholeheartedly recommend it for even the non-fans of the genre!! Pick one up, if you are a Blu-ray enthusiast, you need to have it in your collection! And may the force be with you.........told you I didn't really know about this stuff!!

For returning fans, it is evident that the creators and the actors studied the original cast.  The mannerisms and actions of the new crew are exactly as we would expect them to be.  Especially in his role is the actor who plays Dr. McCoy; he seems to have even captured the voice of ""Bones"".  The adventure and action is non-stop.  The emotions pulled out of you are direct and to the heart.  This is such a powerful representation of a SciFi icon.  It's a must see.",1260576000,,568,4.30188679245283

Chekov joined the crew when Kirk had been Captain for, what 15 years, but not in this upside down universe, he was already on board when Kirk came aboard. They should have just gave the ship and everyone in the movie a different name.",1260576000,8,494,4.43956043956044

I marveled thinking back to friday nights in the 60's watching the show with my friends with our Spock evybrows on, huddled around the tv. They hit the essence of all my old friends in the TV series and as one reviewer pointed out brought out the real Kirk. I was amazed as even their movements captured the characters, and I was sooo pleased to hear Scotty in the end, with his great frantic lines, pushing the Enterprise to the limit!

Especially liked Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban as McCoy.",1260576000,,335,5.222222222222222
3472452,5,B001AVCFJM,"BIG SPOILER AHEAD!!!!

Preface: Once upon a time, at the very end of December 2000, I had a baby girl...who not only recognized **my** voice, but also that of...Captain Spock.
So I raised her, just like I was raised, on ST: TOS. My daughter is so Spockcentric it isn't even funny.

So this summer, a movie I was almost dreading comes out: ""Star Trek."" A.K.A. Star Trek XI: The Prequel. I fully expected to be not only disgusted but also severely disappointed. After all, Berman, Braga & Co. had managed to kill Star Trek. Or didn't you see that disgusting, crackheaded mess that was STX: Nemesis? Or almost all (but one -- First Contact) the TNG movies? I'd noticed that trying real hard to connect the original series with TNG (or any other ST series) usually ended up badly. Look at ""Generations."" That was one crackheaded story that was a waste of time, money, digital film and even though the actors did their best, the storyline killed the movie; it was just plain awful.

Thankfully, it was also the last time that Berman, Braga & Co. tried to connect any version of ST with TOS.

And, almost even more thankfully, ""Nemesis"" was also the last time anyone let Berman, Braga & Co. screw with my beloved Trek.

This time, they let a couple of Trekkies younger than me write this one, and it was great -- and these Trekkies had been doing their homework, too! How did I know? Because of the very last scene with our bad guy, Nero, when Kirk offers him assistance. He almost laughs in Kirk's face when he tells him he'd rather die a horrid death than take any help from his enemy. Which leads me right to my point: the old Romulan legend of Azereik. Upon awakening to find himself in the enemy's field hospital, with all his formerly life-threatening wounds all nicely bandaged and on their way to mending, Our Hero rips his bandages off and reopens his wounds, while laughing in his shocked enemies' faces. For he'd rather die than accept help from his enemies. In true Romulan fashion.

I'm very pleased with the whole movie. Although I have a few peeves with it, all in all, it's so Spockcentric that my soon-to-be nine-year-old loved it. My mom loved it. A lot of people who aren't even close to being Trekkies loved it, and I don't blame them. Anyone with a brain, Trekkie or not, can 'connect' with the themes in this movie.

And it's really real Star Trek. Wow! And all this from a so-called ""summer blockbuster.""

Thanks, Chris Pine, for not being the parody of Kirk that William Shatner seems to enjoy being now. He's just embarrassing to watch on 'Boston Legal'. I'm not even going to bother going into the commercials. Thank you for being the Captain James T. Kirk that Shatner apparently had a hard time doing the first time around. Don't worry about Shatner's Kirk. You nailed Kirk better than Shatner ever managed to do, I'm very sorry to say.

Zachary Quinto literally was Spock. So odd, seeing the two of them, Leonard Nimoy and Zachary Quinto, both playing the very same character...in the same room, together.

Zoe Saldana. Nice to know that Nyota Uhura has more than two brain cells to rub together and that while she may look rather undernourished, someone ""remembered"" (or simply read all the ST books I have) that she was the department head of communications because she had a doctorate in alien foreign languages. In other words, for a reason...and it wasn't ""pretty girl in minidress to make the guys look good while they do all the important stuff and I smile and look stupid and make sure not to mess up my hair or makeup!""

Anton Yelchin. I always wondered if Walter Koenig ever got hazard pay for one reason: In TMP, he got injured. In TWoK, he got a Ceti Eel to the ear. TVH he falls off a carrier and almost has 20th-Century brain surgery. Miraculously, if I remember correctly, he didn't manage to get hurt in III, V, or VI. But this time around...wow. Now he even has a brain! And he gets to use it!

Bruce Greenwood. Yeah, really wouldn't matter if he'd done his homework or not, considering that Commodore Christopher Pike was completely paralyzed in the TOS eps ""The Menagerie."" And that it was Jeffrey Hunter who was Pike originally, in the first pilot (unaired) named ""The Cage."" (A little ST trivia here: It was his wife who talked him out of taking the role of Pike for the re-shoot of the series, and the week after, while rather drunk -- his career was flagging and doing Star Trek would've revived it; don't think he didn't know that -- he died of an accidental fall in his own basement -- right before the pilot was due to be re-shot and it was the day he died that his manager was called and offered Hunter the permanent role of Pike. Guess not? Enter William Shatner.)

Anyone else notice that Kirk was busy chomping down an apple while he ""won"" the Kobayashi Maru...and, that when Saavik asked him, years later, while in the Genesis Cave, how he dealt with the test, what was he doing? Busily chomping down an apple.

Once the cobweb / crustacean-like Romulan Spaceship exited the (wormhole?), things just went south. No need to elaborate(see review by GURMAN SINGH BAL), too bad I can't get my money back.
 As for Blu-y Quality, it gets 2 stars. If you really want a Blu-ray reference, see the BD versions 'ZULU' (Michael Caine) and ""HOW THE WEST WAS WON"" (ensemble cast).

As for the Blu-ray itself: I love this movie. I think it's fast, action packed, funny, has unexpected emotional impact, and offers a mnew view at a (we thought) very familiar universe.
The extra's are pretty extensive, with the whole process of writing, casting, shooting described in all kinds of featurettes. I'm not a big fan of extra's that just have stills, but the interactive models of the ships are pretty cool.

I get a combination of dirty looks, incredulous jaw-drops, disbelieving scoffs, well-meaning lectures on the value of such classics that fall mostly on deaf ears.

Well... my problems with Sci-Fi are many... and one of them is the inability to make myself watch shows/ movies that were made with old technology... the colors were nasty... the dialogues were many and dull... the camera angles awkward and unappealing... the fashion, the hair... I could go on.

When this new Star Trek came out, my husband was chomping at the bit to watch it...  I cringed, I delayed, I denied.

Finally, on one cool December night, when we've exhausted all movie options at the local RedBox, we rented Star Trek. The only expectation I had for the night was that it ""doesn't suck"".

Well, it didn't suck. In fact, it did way better than not sucking.

Needless to say, I loved the new interpretation... the new technology and budget that were allowed for the movie (and not the show)... the lively, clever and not over-the-top humor... the chemistry between the cast members... the excellent casting (my husband insisted that I watched enough of the old show to appreciate the casting)... o, and a pet peeve of mine: the actors were pretty to look at (I can't stand ugly people in a movie unless it has a super-compelling storyline!!! Movies are made for escapes... and that's why no one ever dream of being stranded on an island with an ugly person!!!).

Having watched the bit on J.J. Abrams and how he's brought this story up-to-date, his very clever camera-shakes, and his infamous love of ""flares"" in the filming further deepen my appreciation for this movie.

Exposing humans (or animals) to this garbage is a crime, an atrocity, an abomination. For all the history, heritage and MONEY sunk into this stinker, ""Star Trek"" is THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!

Here's a simple checklist that even Star Trek lapdogs will have to acknowledge:

1)  Capt. Kirk runs from the giant crab and just HAPPENS to jump into the ONE ice cave occupied by Spock;
2)  Spock escorts Kirk to the ice station where Scotty and his stupidly costumed sidekick reside and wOw!, Scotty just happens to know how to teleport Kirk onto a warping spaceship;
3)  The Romulan villain Capt. Nero speaks in a So Cal surfer boy accent.  His ""Fire everything"" quote sounds nasal and irritating;
4)  The Romulan space ship resembles a water soaked porcupine, but not as menacing;
5)  The Romulan space drill weapon resembles a gigantic fishing line.  How hard is it for the scientifically advanced Vulcans to destroy it?  Too hard, apparently.
6)  The Romulan weapons look and sound like muskets;
7)  The ""Bud Light"" bar scene reference is crudely commercialistic;
8)  The Corvette scene attempts to channel ""James Dean"" but is really designed to appeal to rebellious adolescents who will drag Mom & Dad to the movies, thereby causing THREE ticket sales.
9)  There are more un-special effects than special effects: tons of spandex suited fight scenes but hardly any epic CGI space battles;
10) Not one but two StarFleet captains fall for Nero's ruse to board his vessel;
11) Kirk defeats Spock's unbeatable Komagata Maru scenario by ""ingeniously"" hacking into the program...while eating a shiny red apple;
12) Spock's cameo is contrived and weak.  WHY is he in an ice cave without food or water?

I loved the Star Trek series.  Yes, it was campy.  But it had heart, intelligence, empathy, social consciousness and really nice sci-fi concepts.
Star Trek the Next Generation had its moments but I will never forgive or forget the stupid ""Wesley Crusher"" character, with his thyroid Adam's apple and pimply face.

And the entertainment provided by this movie made me remember this is what watching a movie is all about. To be wrapped up into the action and drama of the film. To end up smiling and feeling like that was time well spent. So many times I watch a movie and at the end think ""Well, that was a waste of two hours"".

And while I'm an old Trek fan, the new cast didn't bother me; I thought they did a very good job at interpreting the characters, with Uhura and Spock being particular standouts.  So again, why four stars?  Because of the glaring plot holes in the script.  Yes, it's science fiction and yes, I understand the need to suspend disbelief.  But that's in regards to things like space travel and black holes, not when it comes to people's motivations.  Those need to stay at least somewhat grounded in reality, and a lot of times in this film, they didn't.  That was esp. true when old Spock sent Kirk off to talk to young Spock, with the fate of earth riding on the outcome, and didn't go with him because he wanted the two to explore their friendship?! There were other head scratching moments but that just about blew the movie for me.  If the writers wanted old Spock out of the picture for a while, there were other ways to do it.  That reason made no absolutely sense, and made suspension of disbelief a struggle for the rest of the film. Even with the script issues though, it's a solid four stars from me, mainly because of the actors.",1260316800,3,1290,4.423728813559322

3472492,4,B001AVCFJM,"The latest Star Trek film is out, the first film that uses no original television actors from any of the past series(except for one, but we won't ruin that for you.) Is it good? Is it bad? We're a little conflicted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Well, the inevitable has happened. After many years coasting into oblivion(for the non-Trekkies), the Star Trek franchise has released its eleventh film. Yes, there have been eleven films since Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, Dopey, and Doc left the television series, learned that they couldn't make money doing anything else except Star Trek conventions, and came back to film the first movie. But what does it mean?

  It depends on who you ask.

  For instance, many Trekkies(those loveable people who are so charmed by the franchise that they dress in costumes, play with imaginary phasers, and even have their own religion) may not like the movie. Why? Because unlike all of the other movies, it does not continue its story from any of the television series: William Shatner does not rise from the dead to command the USS Enterprise, again(although, there is an interesting twist to an old character in the new film); Captain Picard doesn't leave his vineyard to wax philosophical and his bald head with Q; characters from Deep Space Nine and Voyager didn't give the silver screen another shot with even a cameo; Scott Bakula didn't get to explain the sensual nature of green women. The movie wasn't even animated.

  That was one thing that all of the other Star Trek movies had going for it: some sort of continuity for fans. You already know the characters and, for the most part, enemies. You knew the ins and outs of whatever version of the Enterprise the crew was flying around in. It was a comfortable place for die-hard fans, so much that you may not mind if Kirk and the crew decided to go back in time to pick up a couple of whales, bring them back to the future, and have them tell a giant, flying space turd not to destroy Earth. If nothing else, it kept pace with the original series.

  Enter this new movie. With the depiction of Zachary Quinton(Sylar from television's Heroes) as a pointy-eared Vulcan and Chris Pine(of...The Princess Diaries 2?) as an arrogant blonde with some wit, it's no surprise that the movie is, indeed, a new portrayal of the old leg of the franchise. You would have had to live in a cave, or Nebraska, to have missed those hints. However, for better or for worse, the storytelling for this new film is nothing like the others. It does not have much to do with the original series' timeline.

  Sure, we find Vulcans, Romulans, particle transporters, phasers, Starfleet Academy, the Vulcan peace sign, and Winona Ryder in the movie. We even get many of the quirky taglines from the characters, but the feelings of these devices doesn't seem like homages or parodies to the original. These screen devices are set up for the viewers that this movie seemed geared to.

  Young, non-Trekkies.

  This movie was a move to dislodge the franchise from the cycle it was stuck in of catering to fans of the television series, and instead try to appeal to the masses. It worked. By starting the story again, but with a twist(which I will not ruin for you), the necessity to really ""get"" a Star Trek movie by knowing the television show was tossed out.

  Maybe that was why I liked this movie so much. I am not your normal Star Trek fan. I'm not a fan at all. I liked Wrath of Khan like everyone else in the world, but apart from that I watched the original series with tongue firmly planted in cheek, and randomly saw episodes of The Next Generation when I watched television with my father. Did I see all of the Star Trek movies that came out? Yes(although I don't remember the first movie all that well.) Does it matter to me? No.

  As a movie on its own, it was quite amazing(I expected to hate it.) The opening part of the movie, as cheesy a plot device as it may be, was fantastic. I think I got a little misty-eyed. From there, all hell broke loose. Acting, special effects, phasers changing from ""stun"" to ""kill,"" Uhura half-naked, the spaceships exploding, everything popped.

  It's hard to explain the great things about this movie, as it is all spoiler. Not just storyline, but emotional impact as a movie itself.

  There were some things about the movie that definitely made me cock my head. For one, the storyline was old: ""It's been done at least five times in the same movie series"" old. The characters and events may be a little different, but it is still the same idea. You'd figure with this brand new push into popularity, Star Trek could have chosen a less overdone theme.

  Also, the title of this review must be addressed: Star Trek Junior. What makes this movie appeal to the younger, less-Trekkie public is also what waters it down. Everything has a youthful, annoying freshness to it that the original never had. Even the new uniforms are ""prettier"" than the old uniforms. And what was up with the Power Rangers nod? Did Kirk, Sulu, and that other guy have to be in blue, yellow, and red space-suits? Why weren't they all in the same damn color? And, of course, let's not forget the politically correct version of the well known monologue: ""Where no one has gone before..."" Incorrect. You've already gone there, before. As a man.",1260230400,,5398,4.701063829787234
3472493,3,B001AVCFJM,"I've been on the fence with this movie for a while now, some days i like watching it others i'm just confused as to why? Why would J.J. Abrams do this? He's a Star Wars fan, thats why. This is not the star trek that trek fans know but a fresh new one with some pros and cons.

I'll get to the movie in just one second but I have to say this 2 disc DVD was garbage. It had so little from what it promised, the deleted scenes should have stayed deleted and off the DVD. I have to say I did kinda like watching the casting and making of the movie, you can definitely who they put more thought into and who they didn't and it showed in the movie(ahem Uhura...the only positive thing they said was how pretty she was) everyone else got an acting praise. Moving along..

The casting of the movie was hit and miss for me. The characters of Bones (Karl Urban) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) were played briliantly. They were able to really portray the original characters we originally loved, you can tell they did their homework. I know some people had been complaining about the arrogance portrayed by Chris Pine as Capt. Kirk but given the alternate reality/time travel and the fact they're young cadets, its understandable. I've loved John Cho (Sulu) since Better Luck Tomorrow so I was extremely happy to see him play Sulu. He recognized the importance George Takei had on the asian community and do it justice in my opinon. Hopefully next movie he'll have a stronger role. Simon Pegg as Scottie was hilarious and brough some much needed humor to the movie. Unfortunately he showed up when the movie was almost over. Eric Bana as Nero, was the hero you wanted to love, he had this crazy psychotic emotion that worked really well with Nero's personality.
My one big disappointment was Zoe Saldana as Uhura...really? Yes, she's pretty to look at (i guess) but her acting was terrible, she's was this annoying, whiny, unnecessarily thin actress running around. That's the best you can come up with to reprise the role of Nichelle Nichols? Ugh.

Spock and Uhura romance...it took two of my favorite characters and put them in a romantic relationship. Why did they feel the need to do this? How come almost all movies have to have some side romance going on? Its friggin star trek, we don't care!

The storyline was okay, it wasn't great, and at times I found myself lost because the scenes kept bouncing back and forth with no transition. Honestly, I could do without the whole changing of time thing. Graphics were amazing, a ton of crashing metal and loud noises (seemed like Transformers)with dramatic background music. I don't feel like going into finding all the discrepancies and little things, there are a ton of other reviews here which do that each one of them logical :) If you're able to just sit back and watch the movie, its not too bad. Took me watching it twice to realize that though. It is action packed, with enough movement to keep you occupied. It is a summer blockbuster movie and not necessarily a Star Trek movie.",1260230400,2,3025,4.555147058823529
3472494,5,B001AVCFJM,"In books, I'm always skipping the backstory because it drags down the pace. Yet J.J. Abrams has made an entire movie out of the backstory of how Kirk, Spock, et. al. came to be on the bridge of the Enterprise - and he maintains a blinding pace from the opening moments to the ending as it rolls to credits. Better yet, Abrams weaves a ton of character conflict, personalities and tension into what could have been yet another blitzkrieg of CGI effects.",1260230400,2,452,4.524390243902439
3472495,5,B001AVCFJM,"Imagine the weight of carrying a beloved sci-fi classic into the future, of making pieces fit, giving it history and veracity, while appealing to new audiences. Imagine overcoming the sometimes campy scenes of the original series, while paying homage to them with some tongue-in-cheek humor. Then, going boldly where no one has gone before, imagine a movie that combines suspense, romance, comedy, tragedy, revenge, and redemption, all within the span of two hours. No wonder this was one of my favorite films of 2009.

""Star Trek"" begins with a stirring scene involving Capt. Kirk's father in a showdown with renegade Romulans, who, for unknown reasons, are on the hunt for Spock. Soon we jump forward to the childhoods of James T. Kirk and Spock, watching their lives parallel, discovering the things that will motivate them in years to come. Their eventual meeting is not as warm as one might expect, and the tension between them elevates as Kirk carves out his own path, going against the rules, and rubbing Spock and others wrong in the process. Of course, his brashness needs the balance of Spock's logic, while Spock's logic is not without its downsides. Together, they will form one of the best fictional teams ever.

The movie shows its real heart through Kirk and Spock's individual and joint choices to fight the Romulans, who threaten the planet of Vulcan. Both must grow if they are to conquer their own pasts and their future enemies. In the process of fast-paced action and numerous chuckles, we are given peeks into the origins of the other original characters--Sulu, Scottie, Uhura, McCoy, and Chekhov. These moments are never overdone, but slipped seamlessly into the story.

I, for one, am a huge fan of what JJ Abrams did with this film, giving us backstory, tying it into the existing Star Trek mythology, and providing new avenues for the story to grow for light years to come. I was hesitant before seeing the film, but now I can only say: ""Live long and prosper.""",1260230400,5,1987,4.872781065088757

3472497,4,B001AVCFJM,"Some reviews are exceedingly wordy, but hit details in the head.  Here's an executive summary review for the busy shopper.

The blu-ray transfer has been reviewed here extensively, and I not only concur its stellar, but its a showcase for your home theater.  Since the movie was built with state of the art 2008 technology, it would be fitting the home theater transfer should be superb in audio and video.  The video is super sharp, and details from the Enterprise to deep space are among the best in deep space FX.  The audio imaging is 5.1 and exceptional, as laser fire and ships move in different directions through the soundscape.

As a movie, Star Trek 2009 does less to develop its characters, and prefers to wow audiences with stunts, effects and likely relies on the legacy of prior Treks to explain the quirks of Kirk and his company.  The remake of Battlestar Gallactica spent a lot of time on its characters and generated a long run and loyal following, but without it the reimangined ST2009 risks the fate that befell the later episodes of The Matrix, Star Wars or Indiana Jones.

3472501,5,B001AVCFJM,"I've enjoyed Star Trek is most all its forms over the years, beginning with the original TV show. What I find I enjoy the most is the quality of writing and creative (even thought provoking) story lines. I've always particulary enjoyed those that deal with non-linear time and make you think outside the box, etc.

I did not see this film in the theatre, but I did hear good things about it from some who did - so when it was due for release on Blu-ray/DVD I decided to get it right away (on Blu-ray). Being relatively new to Blu-ray viewing, and enjoying a brand new LED LCD flat screen 1080p TV, I spent the first few minutes simply marveling at the amazing picture quality... which is good enough to make you think you're floating in space beside the cameraman. Soon though, I found that the story was compelling and the plot was well written. I think they did a great job casting this film - especially considering the criticism that was guaranteed to occur with each casting choice. Not easy to re-cast extremely well known iconic characters, but they pulled it off beautifully (with the exception of Checkov *sp*, who suddenly has red curly hair as a younger man). Kirk was portrayed perhaps a bit over the top in terms of being a devil-may-care, authority bucking youngster - but not so much that it annoys. The best casting by far was for Spock.

I tried to think of a reason not to give this film a 5 star rating, but I really can't. It stands on its own as a good enjoyable sci-fi thriller, fits neatly into the Star Trek franchise, is well written and acted, and has great visual effects. If you like Star Trek even a little, you should enjoy this movie.",1260230400,,1665,4.4557377049180324
3472502,5,B001AVCFJM,"I feel pretty stupid about this, but I also feel I owe Amazon this post, in case anyone else thinks their DVD is defective.

I saw Star Trek twice in a theater and pre-ordered the DVD. I LOVE this movie. I saw the original show when first broadcast and all the other movies, and, miraculously, this is better. The entire cast, but particularly Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, are remarkable; the plot is extremely well constructed; and the production design is striking.

HOWever, on DVD there were flares of light and colored streaks across the screen, many of which had NO relation to what was going on in the scene. It was driving me crazy, nearly unwatchable at times. I told Amazon the disk was defective, so they sent me a new one. Meanwhile I watched it again with the commentary on, in which it was mentioned that JJ Abrams would flash lights at the cameras during filming to get flares -- to add motion! Like they needed to! Like there was a sedate shot in the whole movie!

Well, as I said, I saw it twice on the big screen and never noticed the lights, but on a smaller screen, all those extraneous visual effects are maddeningly distracting. I hope JJ Abrams and these writers make many more of these movies, but that Abrams has enough faith in what he's doing not to feel he has to tart it up with these stupid effects.

So don't send the disk back to Amazon! That's the way it is, for better or worse.",1260144000,4,1414,4.385496183206107

3472504,4,B001AVCFJM,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I have never been a fan of the TV show ""Lost"" and had low expectation for J J Abrams as a Star Trek movie director.  But he pulled it off--an exciting homage to Star Trek: The Original Series.  The casting of the young Star Trek heroes was well-done.  Not that the film is perfect, to be sure.  The soundtrack music is much too loud and annoyingly manipulative.  The ease of the destruction of the advanced futuristic Romulan ship is a bit hard to believe--Star Wars deja vu.  Young Jim Kirk as Luke Skywalker.  In fact, change the characters and basically this is as much a Star Wars movie as a Star Trek one.  Star Wars was great, so I guess the liberal stealing from the Star Wars movie is also high praise.  I don't have time or space to elaborate, but consider the alien in the early bar scene and Mr. Scott's wookie-like sidekick.  Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery?

I thought they did a great job both artistically and story wise.  This is proably the movie I enjoyed the most this year.  Was it perfect? No.  Was it much better than I expected it to be?  Absolutely.  I grew up watching the reruns on late night.  My sons hadn't seen them for the most part but also enjoyed the movie tremendousily on it's own merits.

It's definitely a big screen film and I can't wait until they make another film with the same new cast. The movie told the story of how the crew met which was very well done, and very humorous. People forget there was a lot of funny episodes in the series and I'm glad they put it in. There was great action and special effects.  To me, the best part of the film was how the new actors really captured the characteristics of the crew - and you felt like they really were the same people, just younger. The selection of the new cast was excellent! GREAT FILM! Wonder if we'll ever get another series??",1260144000,,877,4.374233128834356
3472507,4,B001AVCFJM,"I am a fan of the original Star Trek series and liked a few of the movies.  However, I don't do conventions or Spock ears or toy phasers, so I am less concerned about canon than whether I am entertained.  Overall, this was an entertaining movie, if you can look over the warts and nonsensical elements.

The characters were developed well enough, with Spock being the most interesting and credible. I did not find Kirk to be a sympathetic figure at all, and I was thoroughly put off by the ""good 'ole boy"" network that landed him at the head of a starship just because someone in power liked Kirk's dad. The ""bad boy"" image of Kirk is completely overdone, to the point of annoying.  Other characters were decent reflections of their TV-show archetypes, though none were especially necessary to flesh out beyond Kirk, Spock, and Uhura.  The Romulan antagonist, unfortunately, did not cut it.  He was ruthless and sulking enough, but in the end, he was like the thousands of other bad guys in most any generic sci-fi movie.  The best villains, despite their roles, should strike a chord of sympathy or evoke something visceral with the audience (like Khan in Star Trek 2 or even the Borg woman in First Contact).  This guy utterly failed to do either. Aside from the uneven acting and characterization, the crew of the Enterprise generally captures at least the spirit of the original series.  The guy who placed Spock is a spitting image of Leonard Nimoy (and a fairly decent actor).

Story-wise, the movie left much to be desired.  The time-travel theme has been done to death in Star Trek movies already; why a need to do it again here?  And it's done rather poorly.  No need to rehash the several examples, but one that was particularly bizarre involved the ""old"" Spock actually meeting the young one. I know it's a sci-fi movie, but is it physically or logically possible to meet and greet yourself? Anyhow, the ""untested crew defeats a horrible threat to the universe"" trope is the fare here.  It's predictable and unimaginative, but it's the stuff of these kinds of movies.

Special effects, sound, and visuals are fine.  There are a few cheesy sequences, such as a young James Kirk destroying a perfectly good Corvette and some skydiving foolishness.  But this is counterbalanced by some first-rate imagery, such as a shot of the Enterprise emerging through the rings of Saturn.

Overall, if you are looking for a movie that sticks close to the Star Trek canon, be prepared to see a lot of license taken in this film.  This flick is mostly about breathless action sequences, explosions, and characters that appeal to the MTV generation.  It will entertain the average person enough for 2 hours, as long as you don't ask too many probing questions about the boilerplate plot.",1260144000,2,2780,4.752083333333333

It would be impossible for the casting to get any better.

The story is great. While treating the old Trek with the greatest respect it provides itself with a future without restraint. This may (and reading some of these reviews it apparently does) set some of the more orthodox Trekies on an Inquisition, but if you're not actually into holding services you'll probably love it.

3472509,2,B001AVCFJM,"The first five minutes are terrific, and I thought to myself, ""This movie has no business being this good."" And guess what -- it isn't. Right after that we get a cute little kid driving a fast car, and from there it hardly ever gets any smarter. Great look, great effects (and the Blu-ray looks vivid and sharp), but what was the story again? Oh yeah - we're putting the band back together, and there's a big ugly ship we have to go blow up, because it's already blown up our ships, and a planet too. And it came from the future through a black hole - though that really doesn't matter (because in a movie, evil ships can come from anywhere). Except that the half-assed time travel and alternate universe hooks do give us a convenient excuse to take our Muppet Babies characters and file them down to the most rudimentary clichs (e.g. Kirk is a passionate human, so he rides a motorcycle, get in barfights, and sleeps with any random green-skinned slut he can bed down), and then claim that they were ""reimagined."" Bring these clowns together by a series of stupid coincidences, and what do you have? High-priced crap.

3472512,3,B001AVCFJM,"I am a TOS Trekker to my soul, and like my brethren, I was devastated to see Spock's mother actually die, to see the planet Vulcan destroyed right before my eyes, and to see the Enterprise's nacelles with hips!  There I was... mouth gaped open, hoping for a paramedic to yell ""Clear"" and hit me with the paddles!  I realize that all will be explained away via the alternate timeline theory, and while I consider that to be somewhat of a cop out, I will accept it.

But that's not what my review is about.  I gave 3 stars, and my exact reasons are 1 star for young Spock and 2 stars for young Bones (should be 5-Stars). I was violently dish ragged by the plot, but in my opinion, there were 2 brilliant silver linings!  If someone were to have a contest on how well the new actors portrayed the actual TOS actors and characters, I would rate them as follows:

I couldn't really feel Uhura (Saldana), Sulu (Chow) or Chekov (Yelchin).

I could feel Scotty's (Pegg) voice and temperament, but visually it was a stretch.

Chris Pine did a good job, but I feel a little picky to say he wasn't quite there.  His brashness, and willingness to engage did seem right, so I actually don't know what was missing?  But there was a little something missing!

Young Spock (Quinto) was just plain perfect, as well as the very young Spock (maybe 10 years old Jacob Kogan).

However, I was prompted to write this review, because every time the Paramedics failed me, the young Bones McCoy (Karl Urban) absolutely saved me.  There were certain shots and angles when I had to simply blink... and reset my brain!  With all the talk about time travel, I could have sworn that DeForest Kelley (God rest his soul) had a twin who had used a time machine.  Even his voice sounded right!  I had to blink again!  I felt as if Urban had actually studied every TOS episode with Bones in it, and really, really did everything he could to fulfill his character!  I could easily see the young McCoy age into the real McCoy!

Quinto and Kogan were simply perfect as Spock, but Urban was absolutely outstanding!  Every time the movie started feeling a little non-Trek, those 3 guys froze me to my seat.  I'd give pine 75 points.  I'd give Quinto and Kogan 100 points, and I'd give Urban four point seven trillion points for a job well done, and thoroughly blowing me away!",1260057600,4,2336,4.447058823529412
3472513,3,B001AVCFJM,"As a generic action movie, this one is pretty good.  Everything is fast, everything is urgent, everything blows up in spectacular detail, and bits of comedy lighten it up.  It's Transformers but scoring a few points higher on the IQ scale.  That said, being a little smarter than Transformers doesn't do justice to Gene Roddenberry's world.  Characters are shallow and petty, action scenes are comically exaggerated, the plot is full of holes, and props are so inconsistent that it's distracting.  Too often a bad character portrayal (bumbling idiot Scotty and his anthropomorphic sidekick as comic relief) or a bad prop (concrete walls in the Enterprise) jolted me out of the weak grip that the story held.",1260057600,,707,5.060344827586207
3472514,3,B001AVCFJM,"I've been a 'Trek fan' since the very first TOS aired in 1966, and have always looked forward to each film release, and new TV series... I've gotta say, this one disappointed me.... actually, lemme just say ""Woe is me"", regarding this film, and the future of Trek. Why? Because all of the 'consistancy' and 'continuity' of Roddenberry's 'Star Trek', from TOS, to all of the films with Kirk, then TNG and it's films; and DS9, Voyager, and even Enterprise... all of the producers/writers like Berman, Pillar, and Bragda, have maintained a steady flow, keeping the entire story of Trek, pretty constant, and maintaining Trek's own historical-storyline true. Even filling-in voids of the past... like: In the original series, why the Klingons looked more human than anything else... was thoughtfully a skillfully explained in the Enterprise series, so that it made sense, and much more believable and authentic. It was this, the writingm the 'care of details and consistancy' which set Star Trek appart.

And now, we see the original Enterprise (NCC-1701) with little resemblence, except for the saucer-shape primary hull, and the secondary hull with the two nacelles. The entire bridge looked way too advanced for it's place in the 'Trek timeline' (alternate timeline, or not)... and the Engineering deck looked like what one might see below deck of a present-day ocean liner, beneath the swimming pool(s)... huge, vast, looking probably larger on the inside, than the outside... but not seeing much of the engines. And the large water-pipes Scotty got stuck in... wound around and around, looking more like a giant child's game (some assembly required). I dunno... maybe it's just me... but then, I'm kinda 'old-school', and therefore have some expectations of quality, not just quanity. And, ya can't watch a new Trek, without seeing how they're gonna do the 'transporter' effect. IMO, ""Enterprise"" had the very best 'transporter effect' of them all. To me, it actually looked... 'real'... as I would expect it to look if their atoms were being disassembled, and reassembled.... Much better than any of the past films, or TV series. Although TOS, for the era, was pretty good... and, ""The Motion Picture"" (Trek 1) was probably the longest, as well as the worst. In this film... the 'transporter effect' looked...  I dunno... unlike anything seen before... white swirls, circling arms, legs, head and body... 'round and round we go, where it'll stop, nobody knows'. Perhaps looking like it was better suited for a sci-fi cartoon, than a film. I guess it could be worse. But it certainly didn't fit-in with the established 'Trek technology' of any era... from TOS, to 'Enterprise'. And... those little details are important.

I found the little 'hootchie-coochie'-thing between Spock and Uhura quite unbelievable... and no good reason for it (again, alternate timeline or not)(wasn't it Nurse Chappel who loved Spock?!)(And Kirk and Uhura did the first interracial kiss on network TV). I felt the entire story-line to be far, far below the traditional 'Trek standards', being weak, at it's best. Here (once again), we find the Federation having to deal with a naughty, pissed-off Romulan (for the umteenth time)... Romulan's, whose ears are now completely different than their common-ancestral cousins, the Vulcans. And (of course) they speak perfect English without a UT (universal translator)... but more- they speek just like 20-year-old members of their counterparts of present-day America, from most any street corner, bar, or trendy night-clubbers. ""Hello""... being their opening greeting, sounding like he was going to invite everyone over to his ship to 'jam'... and the Romulan arogance, which they are so well known for, was now where to be found. And to write-in the story that both Romulas and Vulcan are both destroyed... kinda makes me think that most of the writing (and producing for that matter), was done at a high-end crack-house/club.

I will give credit with the casting... expecially for Scotty and McCoy. IMO, both were totally believable, as the younger versions of the TOS crew... and, they (evidently) did their homework, as far as studying their character's mannerisms and speech. I think that Kirk looked a bit too young... like fresh out of high school (or, would that be a GED???)(I couldn't resist). Chekov... I dunno... he seemed way, way 'brighter'... and a little too 'bubbly'... as if the crack-pipe was hidden in the ash-tray in the dashboard of his console. Spock?.... hmmmm.... I dunno... I'm kinda 'sittin' of the fence' regarding him (Zach). I couldn't shake the feeling that one of the other 'Heroes' was gonna somehow pop-in. But I did kinda like the scene of the ship being constructed on the ground... looked kewel... (despite that Starfleet built all their ships in spacedock, either orbiting Earth, or another planet(s)... but in space rather than on the ground. Still- it gave the sense of a massive ship (perhaps way-larger than any previous NCC-1701)(maybe even too large), seeing it thata-way.

To sum it all up (as an old-school, old-timer)... I felt disappointed in this film... in addition to the above mentioned 'Trek inconsistencies'... but in the lack of good writing and storyline, in favor of way, way, WAY overdone special-effects, especially in the battle scenes. It was like... 'you couldn't see the forest for the trees'. And, like I said about the bridge... here we have this very large, spacious room, adorned with heep-big-plenty transparent displays & controls (something that even Picard's NCC-1701 D didn't have)... all white, looking a bit like a winter-wonderland, manned by ghosts and polar bears.

To me, it would be a near perfect film for those, who have a very short attention-span, and/or just wanna see action, action, action... and 'who cares about the story... or how well it fits within the established Trek ensemble. Additionally, even though this is supposed to be an 'alternate timeline thingy', or 'alternate reality whatever'... I couldn't see where they had given any forethought to leaving any openings for any other films (which after this, I doubt there would be)(Since Gene Roddenberry can't ""roll over in his grave""... I'm guessing that his ashes released in space, are now headed back to Earth... Hollywood... to reassemble for revenge).

If I were you... I'd rent it first... and see if you think you can live with it being in your library... placed next to all of the others, with decades of the 'Trek-flavor', that this one, just doesn't seem to care anything about. Of course, I realize that I'm probably in the minority (having a 3-digit IQ)... with 'expectations'. It's just that I 'really did' want this film to be great, and instead, I'm having to watch reruns of 'Enterprise' (in Hi-Def) ""In a mirror, Darkly"" to scratch that 'Trek-itch'. (Oh!....Oh!.... reminds me... Scotty did say that he'd transported (and lost) Archer's beagle, ""Porthos""... kinda done as a humor-bit). But I wonder... how friggin' old would that make Porthos?... and, wouldn't that make Porthos several decades old????  Hmmmmmm.....?

UPDATE! I-VIII-MMX

After watching and re-watching... and watching on top of that (just to make sure I had not been fair in my first review of Star Trek (2009))....  I've got some additional info, facts, and opinions that surely, 'some' of the true Star Trek fans will be interested in. I honestly don't think any of 'them' understood Star Trek... what the underlying idea of Gene Roddenberry's, was.

Actually, I do not resend anything I've said on my first review... but would like to back-up my statements with some 'facts', and the benefit of additional viewings. I watched the film setting the audio mode to listen to J.J. Abrams & the editor's commentaries, as the film ran.

It was so, so painfully obvious that no one ""in the captain's chair"" of this film, was ever a Star Trek fan, and most didn't even 'bother' to watch all of the series and films, noting the 'continuity issues' I've mentioned, regarding how this film, in no way, fits within the 'Star Trek Spirit' of Gene Roddenberry. And also, let me say for the record... I am NOT a hard-core, uniform wearing, fan club membership card carrying 'extremist' (pardon the phrase). I'm just someone who started watching with the very first episode in September of 1966... and have watched every single episode, cartoon, and film, since them. There are certainly those, who know much more about Trek than I... and are into Trek much more as well. However...

There's no excuse for J.J. Abrams saying on the commentary track, that ""he was NEVER a Star Trek fan... and in fact... ""Hated Star Trek""! And yet... he's producing/directing the latest Trek film????!!!! There were many little 'tidbits' of info which suddenly made it obvious why the film (in my opinion) a 'Trek Fake'. Good ol' J.J. couldn't recall if Mr. Spock ever 'ran' in the original series... in fact, there are way too many things about Trek that he did not know, and had no idea why they were the way they were, or what was what, for what reason. (Again... total lack of Trek-continuity).

More 'bones' to pick:
Good ol' J.J. is speaking of all of the ""thousands of little peons"" down in the lower 'bowels' of the ship(s)... well hell... everyone knows the crew complement or the original NCC-1701 USS Enterprise was 425-430 (+/- a couple)... and Picard's Enterprise had around 1,100-some-odd crew... just depending (and families, too). Anyway- the reason the engineering decks look more like current-day power plants, breweries, and factories, is because that's where they shot a great deal of the inside of the ships... (and it looks like it, too.)(They stuck a couple of computer screens in a Budweiser brewery, and called it 'Engineering'. ""ENGINEERING""... and your hard-pressed for find controls, or panels, or anything other than plumbing and steel supports. And that peculiar water reclamation-tube that Scottie was beamed into... that just went on and on and on.... almost like some futuristic 'Mouse-Trap Game'!....  obscured!

Even the 'notion' that the time-line is changed because of the events... that doesn't explain the things BEFORE the time-line is affected... like the overall appearance of the Enterprise (which looks like it was designed by the same people who used to design kitchen appliances back in the 30's and 40's. Additionally- J.J. says he never made-up a 'story board', and would decide what they would do, and what would be in (or out) of the script 'on-the-fly', the same day they filmed the scenes.

J.J. explains that his story was actually much longer... but editing the film down to a manageable level (for the production staff, and the audience) meant that critical sections had to be left on the cutting-room floor. Yeah... that's done often enough... but in this case, key elements explaining the story are left out. Of, he tells ya about what 'they WERE going to do'... but that doesn't help the film. Oh yeah... J.J. is molding Trek to fit his impression(s) of all of the films HE grew up with... Star Wars and others, but doesn't even come close.

I'll say again... areas which are all too well known to anyone who has ever watched Star Trek... the bridge... the transporter room... engineering... none of these critical areas are anywhere close to resembling anything Star Trek... ""TOS"", ""Enterprise"", or any of the series or previous films. The theme music is used over and over and over (being a composer and sound-designer, I listen for such things)... and the only 'quiet' part of the film is when Kirk, Sulu and the other officer 'sky-dive' from orbit (failing to ignite when hitting the atmosphere)... there's a few seconds of silence.

But as I said in my original review- This film is for the young people, who have short attention-spans, and absolutely MUST have back to back action, all of the time, and don't worry about the story, or continuity. (Sorry- but I call 'em like I see 'em). I cannot believe... for the life of me that Paramount, or any of the Star Trek Franchise owners are 'proud' of this film... and if they are, and plan more just like it.... well.... ""woe is me!"". I've resold my copy (something I never do with my collection, no matter how many times I've watched a film.

If ya gotta see it... rent it... rent it cheap. If ya got a double-digit I.Q., you'll probably like it. I doubt I'll ever pay good money for anything he's had a hand in.

3472515,3,B001AVCFJM,"Disappointing illogical story. Just as Hulk #1 failed b/c of liberties taken by Hollywood, discarding decades of fans, so too did this movie discard fans as well as logic.  We know from prior Star Treks that time travel is possible.  We know that Spock (elder) is aware of these strategies as well as being in possession of red material to allow space travel.  Despite watching his planet destroyed, he failed to invoke time travel to reverse the genocide!!!

Kirk was promoted from cadet to captain!!!! Only in real life is lack of experience recognized to allow promotion to the most demanding job position.  (Sorry for the political slide!)

Spock is shown to be arrogant yet suddenly becomes submissive to illogical Kirk!!!

Nero has enormous power and technology as his disposal but he elects to kill instead of preventing his homeworld's destruction!!!

I particularly enjoyed the little inside jokes and throw-backs to previous shows and movies, and I just can't seem to get enough of this movie. I watch it again and again and have yet to tire of it. I considered taking half of a star away for 2 reasons: 1, Scotty  doesn't come into the show until so late; and 2, somehow the new Chekov just doesn't seem to be the spot-on perfect fit that the others are. In the end, though, I just enjoy the movie too much to have the heart to even take away half a star.

The subtitles in the movie are particularly good, and all of the extra stuff I've watched so far is all subtitled too.

3472519,2,B001AVCFJM,"J.J. Abrams's new Star Trek movie functions as an unlikely primer in one contemporary movie-making technique: the lens flare. No, I have to admit that I wasn't hugely familiar with lens flare before I saw Star Trek -- I'd heard of it, and I'd also heard that Star Trek was absolutely infested with it, but I wasn't 100% sure that I'd know lens flare when I saw it.

I shouldn't have been so tentative; Star Trek is a wonderfully designed tutorial in the uses and abuses of lens flare, suitable for bringing even the most dilettantish of Big Summer Movie watchers -- myself for example -- into a state of utter awareness of, and complete jadedness with, the Cosmic All of lens flare.

Every single surface in Star Trek is shiny, not excepting the ridiculously young and pretty lead actors themselves. And, since those surfaces are shiny, it only stands to reason that they must emit light at random times -- and so they do!

I pick on J.J. Abrams -- and he definitely does deserve it -- but this movie was planned as a way to bring a new audience to the Trek movies, and it has definitely done that. This Star Trek is definitely a reboot; it starts over from the beginning to make it new-viewer friendly.

At the same time, it reboots itself as part of the plot of the movie, which uses some of Trek's most skiffy (and least SFnal) time-travel tropes, and vast stretches of the dialogue and situations are more ""Easter Eggs"" for long-time fans than engines to move the plot forward. It's big and shiny and overwhelming, but it's also hollow, with the shiny bits not actually doing anything -- to be a massive Trekkie about it, this is a V'ger of a movie.

Also, the villain is a massive disappointment. If I followed the growling dialogue correctly, Eric Bana's Nero is the random Romulan commander of a mining vessel who was really pissed off when an attempt to save his home planet failed and then somehow blundered a hundred and some years into the past, where his non-military craft had overwhelming power. (And massive numbers of guided missiles, which would seemingly be of little use to a mining craft.) He's a whiny nobody with a huge snit against Spock just because Spock didn't manage to save his planet. (Nero, of course, didn't even try to save his own planet, and there's no sign any Romulan did -- or even tried to evacuate the place.) Abrams is clearly trying to make Nero into Spock's Khan, but it just doesn't work.

If I had been the development executive in charge of Star Trek -- and there's no conceivable universe in which that would be the case -- this script would be the one we'd all laugh at, say positive things like ""you're really getting the characters down now,"" and then ask for something new and original with a real plot and slightly less genocide. (Filmed skiffy has been on a genocide bender for several decades now, but it's about time to put it on the wagon.) The movie we have is OK, and probably was quite impressive on the big screen, but it indulges itself in at least a dozen ways, to the detriment of its strengths as a movie.",1259971200,28,3068,4.508992805755396

I was wrong.  This movie delivers a punch, and manages to cover every base.

The bases, in this case, is the entrenched canon of 40 years of TV, movies and books.  The movie manages to fully acknowledge the past, making a little fun at just the right points, but never showing a lack of respect.  It delivers a punch in that the cast, the acting, the action and the whole movie -- are all very good.  I don't say that lightly either, it just all comes together in a nearly perfect mix.

Now, I'm sure that there is Klingon speaking guy in a unitard who can cite numerous inconsistencies in canon, and points of blasphemy with Lord Rodenberry's view of things.  So what?

But I LOVE this movie, and it recasts the rest of the series and films in a new light for me.
The genius of this movie is that it appears to have been created by people who have a passion for film AND a passion for Star Trek. I'm not sure if I had a better time all year seeing a movie than I did here. Thrills, humor, sci-fi, literate dialogue, entrancing visuals...it's got it all. Take the innocent, cerebral fun of the original Star Trek series, mix well with the swashbuckling, warm-hearted fun of the original ""Star Wars"" films, add a bit of the grittiness of the latter ""Battlestar Galactica"" TV series, and then finish off with J.J. Abrams' patented, contemporary witty style, and you've got pure cinematic magic.
This ""reboot"", or better yet, this ""origin"" story of Star Trek focuses on Kirk and Spock, their backstories and how they came to become essentially inseparable.
The cast is fantastic...I felt like this was an ensemble that just gelled. We will be lucky if we can  keep them together for another film or two, or four, or twelve.
The film begs for multiple viewings, for several reasons. The plot is not overstuffed, but intricate. The action scenes are terrific. The dialogue is quote-worthy. And if I'm being completely honest, Uhura is freakin' hot. Man oh man.
The Blu-Ray looks awesome. The sound is its' equal. The extras are great as well, yet I concur with other who are frustrated by the ""breaking up"" of the featurettes into a dozen or more chunks, each with a time-wasting copyright screen, and many with ""branching pods"". It nearly doubles the time to watch these by having to go back to the menu screens and punch ""enter"" over and over again. Isn't that what 'chapters"" are for?
I felt two things at the end of the movie that revealed (to me) how much I loved it. One, it felt too short; I didn't want it to end. Two, I want to go back and watch all three seasons and all the films now...

When I first saw ""Star Trek,"" it wasn't the _original series_, it was the _only_ series.  It was the entirety of ""Star Trek,"" and I loved it.  I enjoyed the sequel series, but never as much as the original show.  So it was with a great deal of anticipation, but also some anxiety that I met the prospect of a reboot of such a beloved part of my childhood.  Done well, I knew it could be fantastic, and reinvigorate the ""Star Trek"" name; done badly, and it would take a franchise already flagging badly and possibly put a stake through its heart.

Well, having seen the result, I can say that they didn't do too badly, but they definitely didn't knock it out of the park like Christopher Nolan did with the Batman franchise.  J.J. Abrams and co. managed to tell a decent story, to pace it quite well, employed stunts and special effects skillfully, but didn't overdo them (a common failing these days), pit a credible and compelling villain against the heroes, and by using Leonard Nimoy as a Spock traveled back from the future and altered the history of the original series characters when they were young, they managed to tie the movie in with the series, and at the same time free themselves up to take things in new and unexplored directions.  The actors were all superbly cast, and did outstanding jobs, which reflects especially well on them, given the challenge of playing such familiar and beloved characters.  Abrams and co. also managed to make a Trek film that was actually fun to watch for the first time in a very long time.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie, and look forward to seeing what they can do in the sequels.  With all that said, however, there are a couple of things about this movie that strike me as terrible flaws and weaknesses, and which keep the movie from being as good as the original series at its best, or the best of the films like ""Star Trek II"" and ""Star Trek VI"".

My biggest complaint with the movie is the characterization of James T. Kirk.  I think Chris Pine did a marvelous job, and I think he's the perfect actor for the role.  Without ever trying to imitate William Shatner's trademark speech cadence and mannerisms, he manages to portray the basic aspects of Kirk's character -- his drive, his sheer ability, his instinct for the right course of action, and his humor - superbly.  The problem's with Kirk in this movie come not from Pine's performance, but rather from the role as it was written for him.  The writers wrote several scenes fleshing out Kirk's history, clearly intending to show the audience what a daring young maverick he was, but had the effect of making him look like a feckless, selfish, manipulative jerk (this is made even worse in the deleted scenes).  In Hollywood, they love to establish characters with scenes showing them displaying certain traits to the maximum extent possible.  They establish Kirk (a very young Kirk) as the aggressive, devil-may-care, risk-taking adventurer with the scene of him stealing his uncle's classic Corvette Stingray and driving it over a cliff, bailing out and saving himself from the plunge at the last possible instant.  This is, unfortunately, the tired old clich of ""the reckless hothead, who is so supercharged with testosterone that he finds himself constantly in trouble, but who is also just the ultimate bad@$$, and therefore, of course, a natural, born leader, destined to rise to greatness.""  This stereotype is an old one, and this scene, as well as a couple that follow, like a bar fight an older Kirk gets into, absolutely reek of clich.  The problem is that Hollywood does not seem able to distinguish between the qualities of ""courage"" and ""reckless stupidity"".  A true born leader also displays judgment, self control, and nerve, not just reckless daring.  A 13 or 14 year old kid speeding down the road in a stolen 1963 Corvette convertible (in the 23rd century presumably a priceless antique) that he deliberately destroys, and a twenty-something young man who picks a bar fight with four guys because he's got too much ego and aggression to back down, is an example of an idiot who will probably spend a lifetime in and out of prison because he can't control his impulses or weigh the consequences of his actions, not someone who will eventually end up being a responsible leader.

The second great flaw in the movie is that it feels way, way too forced.  In ""Star Trek"" Kirk is captain, Spock is first officer, Bones is the ship's doctor, Scotty is chief engineer, etc., so that's the way it has to be by the end of the picture - regardless of whether or not that outcome makes any sense, given where the characters started at the beginning of the film.  In the series, occasionally they referred to the history of these characters: in one episode, we see that Spock had served under Pike, the Enterprise's previous captain (and the Enterprise is also just one of several ships in its class, and is far from new), in another, they referred to Kirk's time as a junior officer on another starship, etc..  It was made clear that every member of the crew came to his current station the logical way, by the normal process of career advancement.  Sure Kirk's young for the commander of one of Starfleet's best capital ships, which demonstrates what a natural leader he is, but he still had to come up through the ranks like any other officer; he just did it a bit faster than most because of his talent.  In this movie, when Kirk first steps aboard the Enterprise, he's a _cadet_.  He hasn't even graduated the academy yet.  By the end of it, he's the _captain_ of Starfleet's newest, most advanced, most powerful ship.  How is this possible?  Why does Pike make him first officer in the first place?  On a ship this size there must be dozens of more experienced, more qualified officers in line ahead of Cadet Kirk.  Even if some disaster wiped out every other senior officer ahead of him, what navy ever existed that would allow a kid with no experience whatsoever, and a background full of alarming examples of his contempt for authority (indeed, he was under suspension for one at the very moment he stowed away - yes, stowed away, rather than being assigned) to retain permanent command of its most powerful vessel?  This is just so incredible that it blasts a hole in suspension of belief big enough to fly the Enterprise itself through.  It also has the effect of making the whole thing feel very, very contrived, very forced - a desperate effort to get the familiar characters into their familiar roles, by hook or by crook.

These two flaws are severe ones, and hurt an otherwise fine film, preventing it from reaching the level of quality and artistic merit it might otherwise have.  As a result, the movie ends up being no better than decent popcorn fare - still very entertaining, and fun to watch, but not really great.  I hope they can do better with the sequels.",1259884800,7,7111,4.6576

3472527,4,B001AVCFJM,"First off, I think the direction that Abrams and his team took this movie was original and well thought out. They didn't try to redo the original series story. They didn't attempt to add something completely new. They took a path that was destined to bring adoration by some and hatred by others, the ""What If"" path. Most of this was done well. There are a few plot holes and some of the variations were a little too much (Uhoura and Spock? Now thats what I call a forced romance, and a weird one at that). Most of the cast fits and performs well (except the Chekov kid, is he like 14?). The special affects are amazing (a lot of people are bashing the CGI...seriously? its the 21st century and this is a sci-fi movie, id love to see someone try to build miniatures for this flick, good luck).
 Overall this movie was extremely entertaining and a unique twist on the classic Trek storyline and I think thats what it was supposed to be. I grew up during the turn of the melenium but my Dad loved the original series and had all of them on VHS. I loved the show and never watched any of the later series. We both enjoyed this movie because we never thought they were trying to add it to the ""Cannon of Trek"". Hard-core trekkies are destined to hate this movie and should probably just avoid it (which I can understand) but if you are new to the Star Trek universe or are just looking for an eye-popping action/scifi movie than star trek will make your day.",1259798400,3,1454,4.326007326007326
3472528,5,B001AVCFJM,"***This is a review of the Movie as stated above. NOT of any DVD sets***

Let me first say....I'm a child of two worlds myself. Though I'm in my 20's I grew up on old Star Trek episodes, black and white movies, and Ella Fitzgerald.

When I first saw the trailers I expected to be disappointed. That the ""Tweens"" had gotten to my Star Trek, but I was so wrong.
J.J brought everything I loved about the whole series back to life.
No...let me rephrase....he took what I loved about the show, then took all the great modern tricks of movie making today, had them make a baby, and we got to see that baby born!!

This movie is very fast paced. Very heavy on action but well balanced with emotional depth and humor. All the same beloved charters are there (some shrinkingly so like Karl Urban who seemed to be possessed by the spirit of Bones), but you understand them better by learning about how they became who they are.
The world that was defined by the show and further defined by its predecessors is still there, just more expansive and made to feel more real by finally showing us future ""Star Trek"" Earth as apposed to back in time 1980's earth. Sometimes with Star Trek you forget that this is all taking place in our universe, because of the submarine-like quality of the stories. This movie helps connect us to the Earth that Kirk grows up on.
But what makes this film isn't just the incredible actors, or the beautiful photography, its the story.

J.J somehow found a way of re-telling the story of James T. Kirk's USS Enterprise without erasing what came before, the adventures that made us all love Star Trek to begin with (a trick I didn't think could be done at all let alone so well). Without giving to much away, he created a completely new story that is interwoven seamlessly with the old show.

I don't understand people who watched the show but don't like any change to the series. Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek was all about change. His Star Trek helped show us a future world of tolerance in a time of continued intolerance. He created a world of change and helped us to understand what it means to be human, yet some fans don't want the show to change and evolve the way any natural living thing is supposed to. Gene didn't create a world of conformity, yet it seems that is all some fans want.

Bottom line: This movie isn't gonna be a academy award winner but it is enjoyable to watch.
Don't judge it before you see it. Keep an open mind and you won't be disappointed. If this is the future of Star Trek, may it live long and prosper (I know... corny...lol).",1259798400,,2577,4.414736842105263

3472530,5,B001AVCFJM,"This review is for;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Two-Disc-Digital-Copy-Edition/dp/B001AVCFJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek (Two-Disc Digital Copy Edition)</a>

It seems the most popular trend in Hollywood is to make prequel films instead of sequels. George Lucas made a prequel trilogy about how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader. Christian Bale showed an extensive background of Bruce Wayne in ""Batman Begins"". The long running James Bond film series had a prequel film ""Casino Royale"" and most recently even the X-Men film series had a prequel film in ""Wolverine"".

As a long time fan of Star Trek's original series from the 1960's, the new film is a great homage to the original characters of that great series. The new film shows the brief childhood upbringings of Kirk & Spock and how they would eventually meet each other at Starfleet Academy in San Francisco (with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background of the futuristic settings). We are exposed to the rebellious, cowboy diplomacy of Kirk and the logic-driven motives of Spock. We see a very young and sexy Uhura that has a flirtatious fling with Spock, but despises Kirk. Funny, I thought that should have been the other way around! We see a young McCoy that complains about his bitter divorce and further explains about how his ex-wife took everything except his ""bones"" (his eventual nickname in the TV series). We also see Sulu who confesses he is an expert fencer, a heavy-Russian accented Chekov and the bright engineer, Scotty who is stationed on a remote ice-planet, but stumbles on the rest of the Enterprise crew by random chance. The scene with Scotty beaming into the tubes while Kirk beamed safely outside was very funny! Trek fans may also take notice of the appearance of Captain Pike who was the original captain of the 1966 pilot episode and was later confined to that weird wheelchair-machine in which he could only communicate with two different colored beeps. Captain Pike is confined to a wheelchair later in the new film.

As a common theme in other Star Trek films, there is a time-travel element in the new film. ""ST-the Motion Picture"" featured the 2oth Century satellite ""Venus"" as the main driving force of a massive spacecraft, ""ST-the Voyage Home featured the retrieval of 20th century whales to communicate with a giant spacecraft (gasp!) and ""ST-Generations"" featured Captain Picard & Captain Kirk meeting each other face to face by some other weird time thing also.

The new film is based on Romulans traveling from the future to the past seeking vengeance on Spock for failing to save their planet in the future. The legendary Leonard Nimoy makes a cameo appearance in the new film & we get an awkward moment when the old & new Spock appears together in the same scene. Overall I liked the new Star Trek very much as I feel it was very fast paced, plenty of action and the characters were great younger representations of the iconic crew from the 60's television series. For Trek fans there are a lot of references to past television or other film moments such as Kirk defeating (actually more like cheating) the training simulator for the ""Kobayashi Maru"" scenario that was mentioned in ""ST-Wrath of Khan"".

SPECIAL FEATURES

3472531,3,B001AVCFJM,"I'll get the obvious out of the way immediately:  Were Star Trek (XI) a standalone piece of space-set science fiction entertainment, it would probably be one of the finest to come out off Hollywood in years.  The visuals are stunning, the acting top notch, the Michael Giacchino sound score flawless, and even JJ Abrams' direction (which is often criticized for being jumpy and dependent upon effects) is quite appropriate.  So why then a very mediocre review score?  The answer is simply this: Like George Lucas discovered when he went back to tell the first three episodes of his space opera epic, Star Wars, some material is so beloved and firmly established within the psyche of popular culture that it exists upon a pedestal no filmmaker can reach.

Filmmakers hoping to re-establish, even with the hopes of improving upon, this type of property are simply flirting with disaster.  Enter Star Trek, a film that basically allows the viewer to experience the Star Trek Universe in its recreated infancy with all of the visual grandeur and evolved filmmaking technique of today's digital age without compromising the source material... too much.

The film, directed by JJ Abrams, was written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It is the eleventh film based on the Star Trek franchise and features the main characters of the original Star Trek television series, who are portrayed by an almost-entirely-new cast.

The story's sense of grand scale is apparent right from the opening scene as the film begins something like this: The Federation starship USS Kelvin is sent to investigating a mysterious lightning storm in space, when a Romulan ship, the Narada, emerges from within the storm's vortex and quickly makes light work of the Federation vessel.

The Romulans demand the captain Robau to transport to their ship to negotiate a ceasefire.  Once the Romulans realize, through their interrogation of Robau, that it's in fact the year is 2233 (meaning they had gone back in time) and that Robau naturally has no knowledge of the individual they feel is responsible for all their troubles, one ambassador Spock.

Nero murders Robau in frustration and orders the Kelvin's destruction. Acting Captain George Samuel Kirk (James T's dad) orders the evacuation of the ship onto shuttlecrafts, including his pregnant wife, Wynona. He proceeds to sacrifice his own life to steer the Kelvin on a collision course into the Narada, resulting in only light damage to the massive Romulan mining vessel.

From there the viewer is whisked along on what is basically a glorified succession of character introductions.  Settings span from the surface of the earth (Iowa in fact) to the deep reaches of the galaxy where the yet-unknowing crew of the starship Enterprise are scattered.

For all of it's wonderfully brisk pacing, charming character introductions, and believable interactions, I can't seem to overcome the abundant and oft times blatant canon deviation that takes place within.  I will say this in the story's defense, we are to believe that this is NOT the Star Trek timeline we've grown to know and love throughout the years but rather a tangent, or parallel timeline that has been created by the Romulan interference of the space-time continuum.  Unlike say, Back to the Future, where a single time line is said to exist that can be moved around upon at will (affecting future events), Star Trek follows the hipper theory that the moment an alteration is made to the original timeline, two futures (or millions of them, depending on how many alterations are made) exist separately and independent of each other.

Confused? Don't be, all it simply means is that while you're looking at young James T Kirk, Mister Spock, Captain Sulu, Scotty and so on, these aren't the same guys we grew up with.  They were the same initially but live in an entirely separate Universe, one in which the planet Vulcan is destroyed, where Captain Kirk never gets to meet his father, where Spock and Uhura have a passionate love affair, and where by the end of the film, there are two Spocks (one young, the other not so much) running around.  Will this trouble some longtime fans of the mythos? Absolutely.  Because while the novelty of witnessing the introduction of such legendary characters (however contrived) is present, there is an undeniable ""cheapening"" of the whole experience in knowing that this isn't the future we already know and love.

In this line of thinking, anything's possible.  Let's say for the sake of argument that the yet confirmed sequel was to open with Kirk's death or the obliteration of the planet earth.  Not a problem, this isn't the timeline you grew up with anymore.  Alternate dimensions were never my thing even when comic books periodically decided to justify an important character's death by using the same technique.  It's hacky and a bit too convenient for me.

I suppose my own frustration in the whole matter (either instance) is that it truly frees up the writers' ability to deviate from the series canon at will- and rest assured they use this power liberally in Star Trek.  Interviews and articles suggest that it was done as a means to reintroduce the Star Trek mythos to a whole new generation but the faade is quite transparent with motivation such as visual appeal and the writers' lack of knowledge on the original material's intricacies getting my vote.

Again though, on its own, Star Trek is a delightful romp with stellar cinematography, breathtaking action sequences, and some outstanding actor performances (most notably a near-unrecognizable Eric Bana as the villain and New Zealander Karl Urban's subtle mastery of Bones McCoy's Kentucky accent).

The dilemma the film was faced with was an understandably difficult one; while there is no denying that this material works best where it didn't have such big shoes to fill, the studio backing of Paramount, distribution, and box office appeal would have suffered immeasurably if not for the Star Trek branding.  As such, the question then becomes which is the more tolerable- A slight mockery of the established mythos within an action-heavy science fiction environment, or the film being canned before even getting off the ground due to its inability to nab major studio support?  Perhaps a compromise would best suit everyone but as it stands we get the former, take it or leave it.

While unofficially labeled the eleventh major motion picture of the Star Trek franchise, you may notice that for the first time no zippy catch phrase can be found under the title card here.  This lends to the suspicion that the filmmakers are hoping this will be the foundation for a whole new ""retooled"" series using the names and likeness of the original crew of the Starship Enterprise, so long as the viewer realizes that in parallel universes, nothing's impossible.",1259798400,11,6887,5.0131578947368425
3472532,4,B001AVCFJM,I am not a Star Trek fan by any sense of the word.. But I do like a good movie. I was glad for everyone that they started from the beginning which is so popular today. They did this very well in my opinion. First off with a great cast of characters... Got to love Mr. Chekov's accent.. especially with voice analysis..lol... and the second is they skewed the timeline to not have every other show to be picked apart with whatever was told already. Kept it fresh and exciting... hats off fellas... oops I don't wear a hat.. Great job then!,1259798400,,538,4.284313725490196
3472533,5,B001AVCFJM,"I'll just start off by saying I went out and saw this movie 3 times at the theater. To say I liked it would be a serious understatement. It's basically an origins story, which I generally have problems with. Usually it takes so long to establish everything, that the film is usually about over once things finally pick up. No such problems here. Even though Kirk doesn't officially take over with only about 30 minutes left, there is more than enough inbetween to satisfy the most harsh action and/or drama fans. I'm very happy to say the action gets to be shown, in brilliant fashion, right from the beginning. I'm an unapolagetic action fan, and I appreciated not having to wait 90 minutes to see any. I thought the film was extremely well-paced overall. Visually it;s very impressive. I thought characters like Uhura, Bones, Scotty, Sulu, and the villain Nero could have been developed more. Putting Nero's deleted scenes back in may have done the trick there. Still I had no big problems there.

I thought the film was well cast and the story both moving and interesting. Pine, Nimoy, and Quinto especially stood out, although they were supposed to. Sure I could nitpick here or there, but the different timeline allows some much needed leeway. I'm just not as much a stickler as many are. I understand that change is needed and happens. Not saying I always agree with everything that is changed or not explained, but I also understand 40 years of material is being re-arranged and told in only 2 hours. Just no way it could be seemless even it it wanted to be. I'm one who believes the film could have been longer to better explain things, plus I just selfishly wanted to see more.

If I had one real issue or worry about the film, it's that I didn't always feel Kirk's character was being portrayed strong enough. Just felt they concentrated too much on his cocky side, and thereby humbling him, and not enough on his nobil side. He wasn't all swagger! Most seemed to enjoy his portrayal though, so I think I could be overreacting. And it was earlier in his career.

The extras were great for the most part. Would have liked a actor's commentary and maybe a little more behind-the-scenes stuff, but all-in-all, I can't much complain. I just hope they make a sequel.",1259798400,,2271,4.630272952853598
3472534,1,B001AVCFJM,"I can't believe Paramount let them do this to such a respected franchise. The original series, subsequent series, and movies stuck to the same themes. This is just a cartoon with people in it occasionally. There's hardly any acting or drama, just computer generated animation. They've sacrificed principle for profit. When they were writing it, they must have said, ""Lets see how many special effects we can cram into two hours.""

There are a few chuckles to be had, but overall I rate it one star and two thumbs down. If you can see if for free, it's OK, but I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it.",1259798400,29,600,4.504587155963303
3472535,4,B001AVCFJM,"Alright, first off, not a big ST fan.  I remember watching reruns of the original when I was kid - that's about it.  Not sure why I wanted to see this movie but I'm glad I did.  It was awesome.  Eric Bana was an unusual choice for the villain but he did a great job.  Oh, and the scene with Kirk and the green-girl cadet was priceless; a wink back to the old days when Mr. Shatner was shagging green aliens?",1259798400,3,407,3.9753086419753085
3472536,4,B001AVCFJM,"Okay, having grown up with Star Trek the Original Series, I had my eye on several comparisons. First, I have to admit the actors in this version are pretty good at immitating the original tv cast members. Second, this version is action packed similar to the tv series, and even Gene Roddenberry would be pleased with that. Third, the special effectes in this new movie just blew me away!

While I didn't care for some of the teenage dialogue and runaway future/present time scenarios , this movie did keep my interest from beginning to end. If I had to give it a ""couch potato"" rating, it would be a 4 out of 5 star for three reasons: (1) too many confusing scenes between Spock the younger and Spock the elder,(2) the entire Romulan crew were a bunch of over-actors and (3) I didn't need to see Kirk get it on with a green UFO (unidentified female object). On the whole, this movie is not as well written as Star Trek 2,3 and 6, but the cast's chemistry is just as tight as what I remember from the original tv series. I'm certain Hollywood will get a lot of milage out of this new crew.",1259712000,2,1088,4.333333333333333
3472537,5,B001AVCFJM,"Amazingly enough the best movie to come out this past year is also available just in time for Christmas. That movie is STAR TREK. I know, some of you aren't fans of the series but the fact of the matter is you don't have to be to enjoy or be amazed at this film.

Forget the past, forget the original series or films. This movie takes us back to the beginning, back when James T. Kirk was just being born. Yes, the film opens with an attack on a Federation spaceship that will not survive. But those in the escape pods will thanks to the selfless sacrifice of Kirk's father, listening in as his son is born while piloting the battered ship into the alien craft that's attacking.

Fast forward several years to an anti-establishment young man who's stolen his uncle's prized sports car, an antique. Or the planet of Vulcan where a young Spock is being taunted by his fellow students for his half human, half Vulcan heritage. Both show early stages of these characters whose lives will cross as they age.

When he hits his late teens, Kirk (Chris Pine) is still a rebellious young man. Caught up in a bar fight with a group of cadets, he is rescued by Capt. Pike (Bruce Greenwood) who encourages him to join as a cadet. At first unsure, Kirk takes him up on the offer. As he boards the shuttlecraft that will take him to a waiting spaceship, he meets a troubled doctor for whose wife has just taken him leaving him nothing but his ""bones"". Yes, it's McCoy (Karl Urban).

A few years pass and the now legendary outmaneuvering of the test known as the Kobayashi Maru (okay, you do have to recall some things from the movie) takes place. Kirk's integrity is called to question by the cadet who created the test, Spock (Zachary Quinto). But before a ruling can be handed down, an alert is raised and an imminent attack on the Federation is at hand. Finding a way to sneak onboard the Enterprise, Pike's ship, Kirk and his fellow cadets face the same ship that caused his father's death.

Only Kirk's quick thinking saves the ship from a complete obliteration. As Capt. Pike shuttles across to the enemy Romulan vessel, a wary crew waits in response. It seems that the leader of the Romulans, Nero (Eric Bana), has a grudge against Spock even though Spock has no clue why. Romulans from the future can do that to a person.

Twists and turns in the plot pit Kirk and Spock against one another, gives us the reason why Nero is after Spock, shows us the planet Vulcan under attack and...well let's just say you won't find a snore inducing scene in this film.

It also re-introduces characters like Scotty (Simon Pegg), Sulu (John Cho), Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and, early on, Uhura (Zoe Saldana). And it's great to see these now famous characters come to life once more. But it's not just their re-imagining that makes this special. It's their newness instead.

One would think that the special effects of a movie of this scale would be incredible and of course they are. But the best thing is that they don't overshadow all the rest. It's not about the beams, the rays, the photon torpedoes that make this film click. It is the interaction between characters we've come to know and love before they even have the chance to know they are going to be lifelong friends.

There were so many things about this movie that made it good. The story, the acting, the sense of nostalgia in something new, the special effects, the development of new characters from old. Every piece of it gels together to make one fantastic film.

And at the center of it is the story of heroism that one rarely finds in film these days. Too often we find misguided or bad boy heroes who are just as likely to kill or maim on a whim as the bad guy. Here we have a group of people who are attempting to make a better tomorrow.

And that was always the secret of Star Trek. We were presented with a bright and shining future filled with selfless heroes willing to sacrifice themselves for the betterment of mankind and not just their own selfish goals. We glimpsed a future that wasn't the current popular phase of torn down buildings and roaming packs of scavengers. We were presented with a potential future of harmony, of possibility and of a bold new world, no a bold new universe, where anything is possible. And this film captures that essence from beginning to end.

When I finished watching this film something happened that I've never experiences before. I wanted to watch it again right then. And I'd already seen it in the theater. It is that good. Unfortunately I had to work the next day. Don't you just hate it when that happens?

If someone doesn't have this film on their Christmas list then it should be. And if they do, by all means get them the souped up version as opposed to the one disc movie only deal being offered. Fans will be in heaven and non-fans will become fans. And when the closing credits roll, you'll be left wondering when the next one will come out.",1259712000,,4945,4.487208008898777
3472538,3,B001AVCFJM,"Ok first things first....... This movie was very good and has its moments, but it has so many copied themes from all the Star Wars movies used for the basis of their plots that it's not even funny! (SET YOUR WEAPONS TO STUN!!!!!!!!, Spock's anger issues the way it was portrayed in this movie was too close to all the Star Wars moives themes with the anger and fear subject). And even though I am a Star Trek fan I still say that this movie is Not like all the commercials that claimed this movie to be ""this Generations Star Wars"". I was disappointed with the special effects with their blaster pistols during the gun fight when Kirk and Spock were aboard the other ship. I was also disapointed in the slow motion look-alike Matrix wannabe fight sequences that were used in this film. To me it made it kind of cheesy. I mean come on Star Trek is better than that!! The alien creatures in the movie used on the snow planet where Kirk was were very good although it looked a lot like something out Star Wars: one of them looked the Wampa out of Empire Strikes Back and another one looked like a creature that was a cross between something out of Episode II and Episode III.

Alright with all the bad stuff set aside This MOVIE IS DEFINITELY WORTH SEEING.It has a lot of action. Any true Star Trek fan will like it, but don't expect to be completely blown away as I did when I first went to see this movie. I thought that maybe this movie would knock Star Wars off the charts in every aspect according to the commercial adds before seeing the movie. Once again they were wrong. All in all the movie was very good and is always nice to see the next chapter in the Star Trek saga unfold with today's technology and a decent budget (for once) for the films. On that not to all of you Star Trek fans I leave you with this,  Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life-forms and new civilizations; to boldly go where no one has gone before.

3472539,5,B001AVCFJM,"I'm a 'Trekkie' as opposed to 'Trekker' (the difference is explained in the special features) and was really skeptical of this when it came out. But I ended up seeing it three times in the theater and ordered my Blu Ray copy as soon as it was announced. I'm really delighted with it. In fact I haven't even had the time for all the special features as yet.

I own all the Star Trek movies and the series and if you pay attention you'll see stuff in this that shows the people who made it really were concerned with the details. I think the casting and the script were excellent.

By the way, some of the 1 star reviews show that some people think they know Star Trek when they don't. One person complained because they didn't 'explain' Red Matter in the film: Anyone who watched the series knows this is typical of Star Trek where many things are never 'explained.' Show me the explanation of 'DiLithium Crystals' anywhere!

Whether you are a fan of the series or the other movies you'll enjoy this. You can approach this as your very first experience with Star Trek without fear. You miss some details (I had to point out the the Tribbles to my son and he's almost as much a fan as I) but it doesn't hurt the movie.

My Blu Ray version is beautiful and I've loved all the special features I've had time to watch.",1259712000,2,1313,4.32520325203252
3472540,5,B001AVCFJM,"When I ordered my player I ordered this disc as well.  I loved the movie at the theatre and knew I would want it for my collection.  I do not buy movies very often.  I started on the original Star Trek show when it was first on TV, progressed to The Next Generation and all the movies generated by the television series.  This movie often brings a tear to my eye with the nostalgic nuances and it is just plain fun.  The HD experience was awesome!  This is one I will watch again soon!",1259712000,,485,4.1063829787234045
3472541,3,B001AVCFJM,"Let me begin by saying that like many of you, I grew up watching Star Trek reruns in the 70s and loved the show. I saw all the later incarnations and all the movies and read many books and just loved the concept and the characters. I don't consider myself a Trekkie and don't speak Klingon or dress up funny either but I do consider myself a big fan of the series.

Also, let me say that I thoroughly enjoy the TV series LOST created by JJ Abrams. It is revolutionary in its design and the characters and stories are amazingly great and I think Abrams and his creative team have made a wonderous show there.

Now to the movie Star Trek...

First of all, this is NOT really Star Trek at all. Oh sure they call it Star Trek and there is an Enterprise and Starfleet uniforms and even the original Mr. Spock, Leonard Nimoy, in the movie. But aside from those cosmetic window dressings this movie is primarily a JJ Abrams video game inspired piece of high octane drivel. C'mon the story is absurd to anyone with even a passing familiarity with Star Trek as many reviewers have noted! I mean having virtually the entire original crew with vastly different ages all at Starfleet Academy at the same time??? Helloooooo!! I mean how crazy is that? It is laughable. The Romulans? Looks too much like Star Trek: Nemesis when they had the sister planet of Romulas, Remus, as the source of the villains in huge menacing ships. I could go on with more examples but what would be the point?

Simply put, this movie is a big budget action thriller designed to draw in a young audience who has no experience with Star Trek and to tread on the brand loyalty with the older viewers to exploit us all for big bucks to Paramount and to further JJ Abrams career. And if you watch the special feature called ""New Vision"" on the disc you will see how Abrams is portrayed almost like the next Steven Spielberg. It just comes off as a major ego stroking for JJ Abrams who seems happier reinventing the wheel with Star Trek rather than trying to make a Star Trek movie that was true to its original roots.

To sum it up, if you want to see hot young actors and a lot of special effects and over the top action you will probably lick this up. But if you hoped to see something more thought provoking and true to the original show then you will be sadly disappointed.

I gave it 3 stars because it is watchable and I suppose that is being generous on my part.",1259625600,6,2430,4.329670329670329
3472542,2,B001AVCFJM,"The movie from the point of view or context of the ""real"" Star Trek world is a disaster.  The characters had different premises, values and demeanors. They had no rapport with each other and absolutely none with the audience.  By the way were those supposed to be Romulans? I mean Romulans can be mistaken for Vulcans..right?...well not in this movie.  Here the Romulans looked like rejects from the WWF.  Over the past 45 years a detailed and integrated Star Trek world has evolved.  It is premised on the Gene Roddenberry creation that was brought to life within the context of his vision of the world of the future.  Writers, directors and actors have developed and added to this world incrementally, but always within the Star Trek vision and context. This movie has nothing to do with that context...well yes in a way as some of the characters do have the names we all know, but that is pretty much it.  The context of the Star Trek world has either been ignored or absolutely shredded. The characters, their backgrounds, their relationships--none of it makes coherent sense.  The effort here, has been to make an action movie for a less pensive and reflective audience.  Anything beyond elements which contribute to the action scenes has been given only cursory attention. I remember some time back there was on television the second of Bob Newhart's comedy series; it was named ""Newhart."" In it he owned and ran an Inn.  Those who are old enough (or watch reruns) may well remember his first comedy series called the ""Bob Newhart Show""; in it he played a psychologist.  Both of these shows were quite well received.  In the last episode of the latter show ( ""Newhart"") he awakens from a dream and he is back in the original ""Bob Newhart Show.""  It was a clever way to end the second series.  It was as if the last 8 or 9 years had never occurred--all that had happened during those years had been a dream.  I mention this for one reason; there will no doubt be another Star Trek movie.  I sincerely hope the opening  scene shows Spock on his home planet, waking up with an almost emotional and confused look on his face, he walks to a window, he sees his beautiful home planet stretched out in front of him, shakes his head and says ""ah...I must have experienced what humans term a nightmare."" Then we will all know this movie was just a sci fi hoax, a joke, and after a mild laugh we can sit back and enjoy a ""real"" Star Trek Adventure.  Honestly except for the action scenes and the special effects, which were spectacular nothing really worked in the movie.",1259625600,6,2567,4.579868708971554

Interesting to see what happened to the Romulans.  They seem to have morphed into a completely different species???  They look and act like ""pro Wrestlers"".  Also, too much pummeling Kirk.  It's utterly amazing he lived to be Captain!  This movie is okay, if you just want a futuristic film, but it it NOT in keeping with Gene Roddenberry's vision of Star Trek.  DVD quality is fine.

When this movie came out, I didn't go. I didn't think they could get it right. So I waited for the DVD. Did I like it? Well, I've watched it three times in the last week.

I thought Zachary Quinto as Spock was dead on. In fact, it revived the unrequited love I've had for Spock since 1967. I could definitely kiss this Mr. Spock in an elevator. I'd like... No, love to be Uhura.

Seriously, it was fast paced, fun and a joy to watch. A great popcorn flick. I hear they are making a sequel. I can't wait.",1259625600,2,658,4.015267175572519

(Of course it's hard to imagine being alive today and not having heard of him.) Knowledge of Trek Canon only enhances the experience of this movie. It is not necessary. I repeat, it is not necessary for you to know anything about Star Trek to enjoy this movie.

JJ Abrams and his production team have simply made a great action adventure movie that happens to be set in the Star Trek universe.

The effects are top notch, making you actually feel like they filmed these scenes in space, and the action is very engaging, but more importantly, the character moments give us wonderful glimpses into the people who will eventually form one of the most beloved crews of all time. Top notch performances from all and plenty of humor.",1259625600,2,968,4.463276836158192
3472546,2,B001AVCFJM,"The only good things I can say about this movie are if you like visual effects, action, sci-fi then this movie is your cup of tea.  After that, it is bull.  J.J. Abrams insulted Star Trek the TV series and the Star Trek movies.  To further, the ending credits said based on Star Trek to justify his rewrite of the Star Trek adventures of yesteryear.

He insulted ""The Journey to Babel"" when Spock's Mother and Father who came aboard the Enterprise along with different races of planetary ambassadors to discuss and arrive at a decision on the fate of the planet Babel.  Spock's mother died or was killed in the movie.

He insulted Star Trek III ""The Search for Spock"", the planet Vulcan is intact, and not a Black Hole as the movie turned it into.

He Insulted Star Trek IV ""Voyage Home"", where his mother was present again after Spock has his Kattra returned to his body, and trying to get his memory back.  Vulcan was still intact.

He insulted ""Star Trek - The Motion Picture"", which showed Spock on the planet Vulcan, intact as always, undergoing the Kohlinahr ritual, in which he was learning how to purge all of his emotions.

James T. Kirk was an ensign or lieutenant on some other star ship under the command of another Captain, not Pike, of which I can not remember.

I can go on and on.  The movie has put a bad taste in my mouth, and I have sworn off buying and watching any type of remakes and upgrades of any sort.  If Abrams would have brought things back in order in the movie it would be good.  To mention Chris Pine fits James T.

I don't understand why people can't just sit back and enjoy an incredible experience the way they probably did when they first saw the star trek series.  I can't believe the number of negative reviews for this movie.

  I enjoyed all of the actors' portayals...Kirk was very unconventional and cocky, though able to back it up. Spock was played extremely well although I don't think I like the thing with the communications officer...but its not that bad. Bones was my favorite, played very well by Karl Urban and he takes the same irritated older man approach to the role and some hilarity ensues.
  One thing I wasn't too crazy about was the Romulan ship. The design was so crazy looking and confusing that it was difficult at times to tell what one was looking at. I thought the Romulan ship from Nemesis was much better but this is a minor stickin point only.
  The special effects are very good and all the Starfleet vessels look retro but the computers and navigation systems have that futuristic feel....no complaints at all in this department.

3472553,2,B001AVCFJM,"Are their no real Star Trek fans writing reviews here? I have been a fan of all the series; from the original with William Shatner to the last network series Enterprise. Admittedly Enterprise was not the best of the lot, and some of the movies were grade B, however they all had a timeline, a standard story line, and an on-going cohesion.

This version of Star Trek says none of the earlier Television series ever happened and probably none of your beloved characters ever came to exist.

In this movie, is it not odd that James Kirk went from cadet, on the verge of being discredited and kicked out of Starfleet, then the next day is made 1st officer of the Enterprise, then another two days later is it's Captain!

Odd that only cadet's seem to man the crews of all the Federation ships?  Odd that if there are other more seasoned crew members, their pushed aside so the cadets who haven't even graduated yet take all leading posts on Enterprise, and from it's logic, the fleet?

Also, would you really want to follow this James Kirk, accept him as Captain?  He shows little personality traits of a leader you would want to follow. This is not the James Kirk we have all known and loved thru the years. The old Kirk was adventurous but he was seasoned with years of experience and reliabilty. Would you really put command of a ship on this guys shoulders?

In listening to the director, he's not a fan of Star Trek. He's a fan of Star Wars. He comments that Star Trek is slow, that modern audiences need faced paced action that is not achievable in the old franchise. So this I assume gives him justification to change the forty-year history of a franchise?

Destroying Vulcan, what does this do to the Federation's future, all the story lines that encompassed its people, its pivotal role in all the series and movies?

As I said, I'm a fan of the franchise. Now, as a fan, do I keep watching Deep Space Nine, Voyager, all the series again knowing in our fantasy world we've developed over the years, that all of these characters and events now never occurred? They never happened and will never happen?

The director is good at his craft; he shows us this by his self-indulging special features focused on him, I just wish he had been more of a fan of Star Trek.",1259539200,28,2267,4.480582524271845

oh & for those who are interested; neither Scotty,Sulu,Ohura,or Chekov delivered in their performances of course that's partially the fault of the writers; Sulu had a chance but didn't deliver,Uhura was never a loose woman,& the actor who played Scotty was never close to capturing the essence of his character.

The picture was fun. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad, it was just fun. Some of y'all think it was ""the best movie ever made"", and each review to that effect gets multiple ""no"" votes.  Others think it's ""the worst trash ever produced"" and they also get multiple ""no"" votes. Can't seem to please nobody. Lighten up people.

I felt that JJ's use of the time line reset button here was very well done, and that this is going to leave the door wide open towards new stories in the Trek universe.

I've been reading some of the negative comments on this movie, and I feel that these are more then likely one of 2 types of people.  The ones that just have to yell out against something for no other reason then it's popular, and the ones that were just mad because Bill Shatner wasn't included in the story.

I don't really get into the high minded utopia vision of the series, but at least some of the episodes and movies have enough intelligence to make you think once in a while.  Not this one.

While the action scenes look very good, the context of them often doesn't make sense.  The crazy drill thing hanging from the Romulan ship?  Child Kirk trashing the Corvette?  Star Trek isn't one of those hyper realistic physics type movies, but one can't help but be reminded of the scene in Galaxy Quest where the characters are forced through a gauntlet of crazy chopping and crunching devices to reach their objective.  One look at the interior of the Romulan ship and you have to ask, who in their right mind would design a ship like this?

Then of course the whole deal with Kirk landing conveniently where he left the Enterprise.  What are the odds of something like that happening?

While I didn't find the movie hard to sit through, the more I thought about it afterward, the more felt that my intelligence had been insulted.  It just seems that the people that developed the movie had their plot (such as it is) all laid out but weren't creative enough to come up with plausible reasons for events happening as they did.  So instead they just relied on fantastic coincidences and glaring inconsistencies and just hoped the audience was too stupid to notice.

Adams rather than showing how the movie was made (which is a shame because i love special features about how movies are made). It was a REAL disappointment. The outtakes were OK, but there was a large break in the middle of them consisting of the director smacking on different microphones. The director must have an ego the size of Mars with how much pomp and circumstance he was given in both the 'making of' and 'outtakes.'

Basically, it didn't capture the heart of Star Trek AT ALL (even the remake ""Lost In Space"" movie was able to achieve its goal of remaining true to the original, but giving it an updated look).  This movie is just another example of Hollywood's inability to come up with any new ideas and is, like most other remake movies of classic shows and films these days, a mockery of whatever it's supposed to be based on, repackaged for our new brainless generation of moviegoers by slapping a bunch of sex, swearing, explosions, advertising gimmicks and liberal use of original catch phrases (to try and make it sound genuine), and giving them a shiny new apple store packaging to ""re-imagine"" something that was never dysfunctional in the first place.

3472564,2,B001AVCFJM,"Look, if you are a fan of the original series, you might well be seriously ticked off by this movie. It literally invalidates the entire original series. Stuff happens in this movie which could not have happened and you may get the impression that the writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and director JJ Abrams never saw the original series. I think that last part may be true. But according to what they say on the DVD the modern audience is not sharp enough to handle real plot and real dialog. What they say you want is non-stop fast-paced action regardless of the story.

Ok, so here are some truths. Spock never had it off with Lt. Uhura. The movie rather assumes that Kirk is an only child, yet he had a brother Sam, that was mentioned in TOS episode ""What are Little Girls Made of?"".  Kirk was born in Riverside Iowa, not in space. He took over as captain of the Enterprise not from Chris Pike, but from Robert April. Evidently,his eyes changed from blue to brown along the way - too much Romulan ale, perhaps. Vulcan was never destroyed, there was no black hole, Spock's mother was not killed, and on and on and on. The plot holes are big enough to fly a Constellation Class Starship through.

But remember that this movie is based around time travel and changing history. I don't want to spoil the writer's plans for the sequel (ok, yes I do) but things may well be put right in the next one.

So much for throwing rocks. The portrayal of Kirk by Chris Pine is abysmal and badly written (I had 1 rock left). However Spock is quite well done and Zachary Quinto played him with real empathy and skill. John Cho was quite a good young Sulu and Simon Pegg was a really believable Scotty. Chekov was all wrong in comparison to the Walter Koenig character but he seemed to be what Pavel Chekov was supposed to have been all along. He is not the half-witted ponce that the one in TOS was. But McCoy, holy cow, Karl Urban was nearly flawless! He was even able to overcome the lame, stupid, and patronizing dialog he has given. Most of it was fine but some was just insulting to fans. But his performance was so good as to be nearly worth the movie itself and is the only reason it gets 2 stars and not 1.

The special features portion is pretty lame and the blooper section is thin and obviously padded with filler.

Star Trek is not nearly as good as it could have been, the writers are commercial screenwriters and not storytellers, the special effects are mostly designed to keep the WWE generation amused, though they are generally pretty good.

This movie has it all, emotion (I teared up in the first 5 minutes), action, humor, hot men (and ladies, if you swing that way). The casting is brilliant, and the actors do an excellent job of interpreting the character rather than parroting the already iconic performances of their predecessors. No one wants to see a 90 minutes long Shatner impression, and Chris Pine doesn't torture us with one. Instead he embodies the bravado, humor and charm of Kirk in his own way and does a charming job. Quinto goes a little further in adopting Nimoy's mannerisms, but just enough to make the character feel right.

I know several of my more hard core trekkie friends take issue with parts of this story. To them I say, with love: Get over it. Its a movie, and a good one at that.

The blueray has nice special features- the gag reel is funny. I'm not big on those things, but they are there for those who are. The sound and picture quality were good (probably even excellent, once again not really my thing).

Step 1: Click here to get the security upgrade.""
When I do, I'm taken to [...]

Turning to the printed instructions that came with the movie; I see, in the fine print of course,
""...For more information, technical support and minimum requirements please visit [...] copy""
When I do that I get a blank, worthless page!

Furthermore, the printed instructions also state, ""For transfer to PC...
Step One: Insert the digital copy disc into your PC.
Step Two: Choose Transfer digital copy.
But when I insert the digital copy disc, what comes up on the screen is
a window telling me, ""To get a Digital Copy of this movie please insert this
disc into your computer's DVD-ROM or BD-ROM drive.""
And what's with the 'Return' Button?!
First of all, it, along with the entire screen area does not react to a mouse click at all,
and second, 'Return' to what?!

I realize all this new technology is very complicated, there are compatibility issues, etc.;
but when Paramont charges the kind of prices they do for DVD's and BluRays;
then provides such a sequence of failures and just plain stupid instruction
windows, one has to wonder about their competence, among other things.

I'm very curious as to whether others have had a similar experience.

and whoever else, works out the bugs!

3472572,5,B001AVCFJM,"Wow, when I saw this in the theater, I was blow away. I honestly didn't think it was going to be as good as it was. I loved it.

This starts out with us seeing Mr. Kirk on the USS Kalvin. He's then made Captain then has to set the self destruct to blow up and enemy ship. When all of this is happening, his wife gives birth to Kirk.  Things don't turn out as planned, the enemy ship isn't destroyed.

Years pass (I don't want to give away to much) and Kirk is made ""acting"" Captain of the Enterprise.  He has to stop a Romulan named ""Nero"".  Nero plan's to destroy all of the planets in the Federation so he can get his revenge.  That's all I really want to say on what happens.  You have to see it first hand.

There are so much positives to this movie. If you're a fan of Trek, then you'll be drawn in. If you have never seen an apy of it, then don't worry, you can still enjoy it, but not get all of the little jokes in it.  One of the jokes is what happens to the guy wearing a red suit.

I also like how we're introduced to the crew. On how we meet Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew.  It was also interesting to see how Kirk and Spock were not friends when they first met. As a matter of fact, they really hated each other.  That just added a lot to the movie.

The casting is excellent!  Kirk and Spock were right on. The best casting came to Dr. McCoy. That was **spot** on. When he opened his mouth to talk, my jaw dropped. They couldn't have made a better choice.  I also liked Scotty. I hope we see more of him in the next movie.

As for Nero, he was a very interesting character. What made him so interesting is what motivated him to do what he did.  He was a peaceful Romulain. He was a husband and a father. To make a long story short is that his world was destroyed and the set him out for revenge.  I won't say who or how Romulain was destroyed, you have to see it for yourself.

It was eye candy with some cheap and easy gags.  Then while the credits rolled, my head started to swim with all the plot holes and inconsistencies with Trek lore.  I know Trek always has some issues with consistency, but there were some major whoppers in this one.  I won't go into details; either you are painfully aware of them as they smack you in the head or you're a newcomer to the franchise and you won't have a clue.  In that case, never mind and enjoy the roller coaster ride.

Still, even if you're unfamiliar with Trek, this storyline still lacks in substance - it's like cotton candy; not filling, all fluff, and mostly air, but still fun to eat.  For a blu-ray movie, it's pretty good audio and video and worth the $20 - gotta show off the HDTV and surround sound!

I'll most likely watch it again, but I'll more likely grab Wrath of Khan or The Voyage Home first - those were the best in my opinion.  Thinking of TVH, if old Spock from the original timeline could calculate how to time travel in a purloined Klingon ship modified to accommodate a couple of humpback whales and tons of seawater (exact masses not quite known) with iffy, somewhat repaired dilithium crystals IN HIS HEAD to save Earth, why couldn't he even think to convince Star Fleet to time travel to save his own planet, 6 BILLION souls, and his dearest mommy (I didn't know Spock was such a mama's boy)?

well maybe TNG, DS9, ect. were not ""that"" bad after all. If nothing else, at least they had a little dignity. This film has plenty
of action, but completely pointless as there is next to no plot (let alone an intelligent story) for it to fit into. Maybe they could
have done with one or two less special effects and used the money to hire a writer. The story is pretty much hokum and all the

3472586,4,B001AVCFJM,"Let me start off by saying no one can really replace the original actors of Star Trek.  Each one of them brought something to the development of their character that no one can copy or replace.  That being said, JJ Abrams and crew have done an excellent job of finding actors capable of embracing the roles of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, and Chekov; some with more success than others.  Of course, Kirk, Spock and McCoy are the triumvirate at the center all things Star Trek and the three actors taking on those roles put their own spin on the characters while still maintaining the essence of what Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley gave them.  It would have been a mistake for Chris Pine to impersonate Shatner because it would have come off as mockery; however, even though Pine creates a very different James T. Kirk there are several moments when you can see his inner Shatner coming out.  As Spock, Zachary Quinto's performance is more like an impersonation of Leonard Nimoy's take on Spock, but with this character there was little choice and Quinto is allowed moments when he can bring something different to the role.  Karl Urban's performance as Dr. McCoy is more like an homage to DeForest Kelley.  Of all the actors in the film, Urban does the best in capturing the essence of the previous actor's performance.

*SPOILERS*

As plots go, I'm rarely a fan of time travel; however, Star Trek has always been successful using the time travel conceit.  Most notably in films like The Voyage Home and First Contact.  In this film I think the time travel plot is rather hit and miss.  By using time travel to change Star Trek history it allows JJ Ambrams to create something new and different, and opens the franchise up to whole new adventures.  That I can understand, but in this film I don't necessarily feel that it fully succeeds.  Granted, creating a new time line allows the franchise to go in new and different directions, but for me the destruction of Vulcan and the death of Spock's mother, Amanda, were unnecessary to the overall plot.  However, the way in which this allows the writers to bring the crew together does work.  I especially liked the development of the Scotty and Uhura characters.

One thing that was often lacking in Star Trek films featuring the Original Series characters was special effects, Wrath of Khan being the notable exception.  This film, however, does not scrimp of the effects.  While I hated the warp effect I have to say the space battles looked fantastic.  I especially liked how they incorporate the original sound effect of phaser and torpedo firing, it was a nice homage to the Original Series.  The ship design, while different, was also successful.  My two quibbles are the bridge, which I thought was too cluttered, and the viewscreen that was little more than a glorified window with picture-in-picture.

As a film on its own, this Star Trek is very successful on many levels.  As a prequel to the original series it's still a very successful, if flawed, film.  This may not be the Star Trek we grew up with, but it's a great new vision for the future of Trek and as a long-time fan that's good enough for me.",1259193600,2,3170,4.67870036101083

I've been a fan ever since! We started with the original series (Kirk & Spock), then a series of movies and then various TV series which explored before and after the original series. This movie presents the Kirk & Spock era from kids to the formation of the original series crew of the Enterprise. Well, there is a twist! In the opening sequence, Kirk's dad dies as James T is born. Say what? That's not the original time line! Hummm... There are several ""odd things"" happening in this timeline (Spock and Uhura kissing?). It is all part of this story line.

The movie is extremely interesting with a great plot! A really serious bad guy who has a really big ship he uses to ""mine"" planets. Oh, did I mention Spock ""prime"" (Leonard Nimoy) plays a key role? Truly great special effects from ILM. Very faithful to the original series and lots of eye candy for us fans (did you notice the tribble in the cage on Scotty's workbench?). Shout outs to: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban (Kirk, Spock, McCoy) with each capturing the character without doing an ""impression"" of the original actors; respectful but not a carbon copy.

I'd like to give this movie a 10 of 5 stars, but, they won't let me do that! So, it has been added to my official favorites list. I really hope some smart people out there will take this timeline and fresh cast and move forward with a new weekly TV series. We could call it the New Original Series!",1259107200,,1593,4.378378378378378
3472592,4,B001AVCFJM,"I'm not a hardcore Star Trek or sci-fi fan, but I've enjoyed several previous Star Trek episodes and movies, so I'm receptive to the concept.

This movie's acting, scenery, and special effects were all well done.  The characters were somewhat flat, but not to the extent of ruining the movie.  The general plot was (a) good guys ultimately defeat bad guys, with all parties experiencing losses along the way, and (b) a promising but troubled and nonconformist young man finds his niche and attains success, and thus becomes recognized by his peers as a hero.  This is pretty basic and predictable, but the action and suspense were still good -- the sort of movie that will keep you awake.  On the negative side, there were time-travel elements which generated the usual inconsistencies, and there were plenty of other subtler plot flaws, but I just went with the flow rather than wasting effort trying to make sense of these things.

Beyond entertainment value, I didn't discern any substantial themes or perspectives on the human condition.  The closest attempt was an exploration of whether to live according to one's head or heart, but this was handled in a stereotypical way that didn't shed any new light (by the way, logic isn't the same thing as rationality).

So, overall, this movie was enjoyable and worth watching, but strictly for entertainment value rather than anything deeper.",1259107200,3,1391,4.9655172413793105
3472593,4,B001AVCFJM,"Star Trek (Single-Disc Edition) (2009) surprised me and was pretty darn good for an old story that benefited from a new film approach. Many of the story elements were borrowed from prior Star Trek films. However, if you are a faithful Star Trek fan I don't see how you can begrudge this well done flick 4 or 5 stars for fruitful effort. This movie took Star Trek to a new high with updated screen images and action.

Lots of action, good looking young stars, many improbable events (estimated by young Spock at less than 5% likely to succeed), and most of all a screen vision that featured numerous live action shots rather than the exclusive CGI approach so popular today. Honestly, when I am paying for a movie I want to see a film, not only a computer animation. In addition, the old ""shake the camera"" technique was used plus lots of new and clever live filming tricks were employed (including: the blinding light in the camera lens method and filming down against the mirror to reflect the image of the sky. This worked beautifully and fooled me into thinking just what the film maker wanted). These ingenious camera tricks are discussed in the documentary also provided in the basic DVD package.

A youthful James T. Kirk, Spock, Bones, Sulu, Uhura, Scotty, and Checkov were all played by a good cast which looked very credible as younger versions of their older TV counterparts, and when necessary had excellent dialects.

I like the idea of creating the alternate time line. Gives them the oppertunity to take Star Trek anywhere they please. And maybe
avoid the wussification that set in after the original series was over. Making for more exciting, less touchy/feely, stories.

The bad.
There really isn`t much story to be had in this film. Mostly they run around and scream a lot.

The stupid.
Having Kirk go from a smart mouth cadet (on report for conduct unbecoming no less) to starship captain in one day isn`t even a joke.
It could only be discribed as an adolescent fantasy. A very immature fantasy at that. ""Hey kid! We are really short on officers
this week. Wanna command a starship? On the job traning! No experience, brains, or common sense needed!""
This is about the same as pulling a cadet out of the Naval Academy and putting him in command of an aircraft carrier. I don`t care
what alternate universe you live in, it just isn`t going to happen.

The hope?
Ok. Now that they have this....whatever you want to call it...out of the way, where do they go from here? The current setup leaves
lots of potental for some good stories to come. Assuming that they have not managed to completely kill off the franchise with this

3472598,1,B001AVCFJM,"(1.) Too many producers (appropriately including Bad Robot Productions) - a list as long as the cast which resulted in a jumbled incoherent patchwork of scenes and subplots. As for acting and dialogue it was like watching cartoon characters.
(2.) Excessive, overbearing computer generated and orchestrated high school band music and the usual choir to create suspense and drama. A tipoff to poor story writing, acting and visuals. And action such as the usual (and they did this at least twice) people nearly falling off of a precipice while dangling by fingers. Of course, they survive.
(3.) The reliance on tattoos and cheap halloween manufactured latex suits to create aliens was laughable and indicative of the quality of intent from the many producers.
(4.) Reliance on standard ""let's create an alien feel"" props such as the now boring (and ripped off) ice fields & cave; lobster and bear like creatures (a cheap one minute, thank goodness); cities that look like the fantasy cartoon work being produced by illustrators during the '80s.

Amongst the worst science I've ever seen and they had science advisors (they must be art majors w/teaching certs. that ended up teaching middle school science) e.g. the typical rusty heavy steel industrial look which is a 20th century technology that cannot be used in space travel especially in 300 years. Makes zero sense especially if you're trying to accelerate useless mass to those velocities; speaking of acc/decelerations what I saw in the movie would crush every living and nonliving thing within the Enterprise and it as well. Supernovas occur every day in our galaxy so no big deal despite what was said in the movie that the galaxy would be destroyed by one and by the way there are 100 billion stars in ours. It's like saying a grain of sand could suddenly annihilate Earth. Swords - give me a break. And, red oil, from a lava lamp no less, to destroy a planet!! What more can I say!! The type of time travel shown besides being physically impossible at that scale is also not possible by any mathematical physics imaginable. Sound and explosions in a vacuum! I thought we got away from that stuff decades ago.

3472599,3,B001AVCFJM,"You know, it's funny.  I've said, in the past, that I hate movies based on things, but when I look at the movies I've watched over the last ten years, the vast majority of them have been based on something.  So be it, then.  Maybe I just like to risk causing myself unreasonable pain and suffering.

Fortunately, I didn't find myself experiencing such unreasonable suffering with Abrams' remake of Star Trek, though I couldn't say I really enjoyed it either.

This movie did a lot of things right, which is more than I can say for most movies based on things, so before I get into the gripes, let me tell you what it got right.

First, there are scenes of people flying through space in starships.  Their technology is mostly workable and realistically-portrayed, with the exception of one scene of a voice-recognition program that apparently can't penetrate an accent.  Most of the character portrayals are dead-on and believable, and someone in red armor dies at one point.  There's a plot involving time travel that needs to be resolved, and James Kirk handles the no-win test in the same way we heard about during previous Star Trek movies.

That may seem like a lot of things to get right, to the point where the movie should deserve a high grade, but I'm afraid that it got quite a few things wrong as well.  Most people who've never heard of Star Trek before won't notice most of these, but then, those people are probably in comas or hiding under rocks, and won't notice this movie either, so here goes.

First, this movie is a movie about war, and the Federation is depicted as an armada, yet, without the strict, military discipline that was previously Star Trek's defining characteristic.  This is a complete reversal on nearly every level.  What made classic Star Trek stand out from every other science fiction series before and since then was that in Star Trek, the characters didn't need to fight everything they came across.  Most of the time, the solution could be arrived at peacefully, and frequently, it was just a matter of thinking about the problem a certain way.  Furthermore, military discipline was the overall mood of everything Star Trek; which differentiated it from Star Wars, where there was little or no discipline among the heroes.

Because of that, this movie is basically what the Star Wars prequels should have been.  It has the right mood, feel and genre to be another Star Wars movie, and fans of Star Wars will probably enjoy it as well.  However, it doesn't have the sense of peace that Star Trek radiated.  In fact, most of the movie is spent in mindless fighting.

Still, that's something that most other Star Trek movies also got wrong, so I won't come down on the movie too hard for that.

Secondly, in this movie, Mister Spock is fiery and emotional, and so is James Kirk.  Neither of them shows any signs of maturity or responsibility, and that makes many of their interactions painful to watch.  Showing Starfleet officers as young people can work as long as they act mature, but removing their maturity carries all the feeling of a bratty toddler aiming a phaser at your head.  These are not the kind of people you want to trust the fate of the Earth to, and no.  That's not a good thing.

Unfortunately, when robbed of his logic and self-control, Mister Spock becomes an abrasive, selfish, arrogant jerk; easily infuriated by the people around him.  There's nothing left of the Spock seen in previous films and episodes.  Just the fact that Spock seems to be the most emotional member of the crew should have told Abrams that he was on the wrong track in this respect, though.  Kirk, in turn, when he stops acting calm and composed, comes off as a hyper, overeager, self-centered and overconfident fool with a tendency to throw himself on women, and hope they give him the chance to take advantage of them.  The idea of him being in control of the Enterprise is more of a crime than a joy in that state.  In fact, at every stage, Abrams seemed determined to bring out and exaggerate the worst qualities of each of the two main characters, or even fabricate new ones, which does nothing to inspire or delight those who originally looked to Star Trek for hope that the future would be filled with maturity, peace, and intelligent thought.

I should also mention here that the plot of trying to rewrite canon Star Trek into a new, less-mature, less-likable timeline is a rotten thing to do, and I refuse to accept it, because I enjoyed the first Star Trek series' so much, and this so little, but it doesn't make a huge impact on me, because, as I said, my mind refuses to accept it.

On a much more minor note, I should say that given how far in the future this apparently takes place, I was disappointed with the appearance of the Enterprise engine room.  Every other part of the ship seems nice and spiffy, but the engine room looks like a beer brewery, and there's no good reason for that.  Antimatter fusion definitely does not make use of water as a coolant, nor are huge, bulky water tubes needed to keep the engines going.

The depictions of Earth and Vulcan are both nearly unforgivable.  For starters, the vulcans are shown to have prejudice against Spock, despite their logic, which is entirely different from the way things originally were; probably intended to make me hate the planet Vulcan, so I wouldn't mind so much, when Abrams decided to blow it up later on.  However, as much as Abrams made me hate Vulcan, he made me hate Earth a lot more.  His depictions of Earth contained no scenes of good people living peacefully.  Nearly every scene involved some kind of war, violence or sex; sometimes more than one of those things.  How am I supposed to root for the good guys if they absolutely refuse to be good?  Honestly, as much of a psychopath as the bad guy was, he at least seemed to take his actions seriously, to the point where I really would have rather just let him win.

So having said all this, why didn't I rate the movie lower?  Well, the characters of Uhura, Mccoy, Chekov and Sulu were all very faithfully depicted.  Scotty was a little much, but it was nice to see Leonard Nimoy again, if only as a guest chatacter.  It also shouldn't be said that I can't appreciate a good action sequence or some nice dialogue, and the story isn't a bad one.  As I said, it's just not Star Trek.

So in the end; no.  This movie didn't cause me unreasonable pain and suffering; just the moderate kind.  I didn't find it enjoyable, I wouldn't watch it again, and I certainly wouldn't watch a sequel to it, but in terms of what it gets right and wrong, this movie is a middle-of-the-road kind of experience.  It's average, so average is the grade that I'll give it, in spite of my personal disappointment over the opportunities they wasted.",1259107200,3,6801,4.587748344370861
3472600,5,B001AVCFJM,"Yes, I thought, ""Oh Lord, not another one!"" Esp. since I was a fan of the original series and not any of the others.  You can't top the first one out of the gate. Then I saw that this was a pre-series character discovery.  The more of the trailer I saw the more I was thinking, ""Ok, I have to see this!""  That night(I saw the trailer in the theater before the James Bond movie, Quantum of Solace"") I got onto Netflix and added Star Trek to my queue, so I wouldn't forget.

Months later, I received it in the mail and was thoroughly entertained, impressed, etc... The story was a little thin, not bad though.  There were things that bothered me, the whole Vulcan being destroyed, but then, thankfully, Spock came to the rescue. My concern was that they weren't following anything from many of the previous Star Trek movies. Vulcan hadn't been destroyed, etc...they were changing so many things.  But, then Spock came about and talked about how all their destiny's had been changed because that nasty dude, Nero, came through and destroyed that ship and killed Kirks dad and so forth.  Things had totally been changed, I needed that pointed out, made things clearer, and whenever I got a tad confused I went back to that.

The characters were great!  The people playing them were spot on!  Quinto was vintage Spock. Kirk, handsome and rebellious, Bones, pissy and emotional with his little quirks; Scotty, what can I say freakin funny (LOL), Sulu, Chekov, his speaking was funny and sweet and he played the roll great...all perfect.  The humor was fantastic and not over the top but placed perfectly. I was bothered at times, like when they eject Kirk and maroon him on that frozen ice cube, seemed to get a tad off topic but then it quickly showed why.  Had to get to the older Spock and then find Scotty (who was a freakin hoot!)

The music wasn't the greatest, seemed campy, maybe they wanted it that way.  Loved the way they filmed it, imperfect and real, light flares everywhere, made it authentic.  I'm sick of people always going for perfection, that takes away the realism sometimes.  Abrams did a fantastic job and I hope he'll happily sign-on and do another one.  They left it wide open for more to come, and I very much hope they do!",1259107200,3,2242,4.551122194513716

They had to refresh the series. Anyone who truly knows how time-travel (in the Star Trek world) works knows this is hardly a big deal.
The new Star Trek timeline opens up a new pathway for the series and makes it new and refreshing. They would hardly have done well to just remake what we've already seen.
There are a few things in this new movie that bothered me, like Spock and Uhura hooking up. The other things are kind of hard to describe, but none of these things detracted (at least for me) from an exciting movie that I hope brings a whole new generation of people to a wonderful franchise as well as future awesome movies.",1259107200,2,953,4.514450867052023

I was hoping for something on the same level as Tim Burton's remake of ""Planet of the Apes"", but ""ST"" doesn't come close. I'm not knocking JJ Abrams, but when a good director is forced to work in a straightjacket, you get mud. Blame Hollywood, which really doesn't know anymore why people would want to see a movie, nor why anyone would want to *make* a movie.

After the TV series ""Enterprise"" was cancelled, one of the Trek producer/writers said ""We went to the well once too often."" Six months later this movie was announced. It was a very bad idea then, and it is almost as bad a fact, now. So much hard work, and so little to show for it in the end. Ugh ...

All the hype in the universe couldn't prepare me for the awesome experience of watching ""Star Trek"" '09 at the IMAX theater.  To start with, the movie has loads of awesome highly-developed special effects and action set pieces.  The movie as a whole is very intense.  As such, the camera does shake around quite a bit, making for a more dynamic viewing experience than the other ""Star Trek"" movies, but it may not appeal to everyone.  All of this is encased in an interesting story that very cleverly wraps up the old movie series and starts the series anew.  There are also quite a few homages to the former shows and movies, and some witty moments as well.  I'm also impressed as to how well the film captures the element of danger in space and extraterrestrial environments.  But the most attractive feature in this film is the characters; acting is practically perfect and their respective characters show decent depth.  Production design (sets, props, costumes, vehicles, weapons, etc) is well-conceived and quite interesting.  Music is not bad either.

Some die-hard purists may hate this rendition for all its changes.  I myself consider this to be my favorite ""Star Trek"" film out of the whole lot.

This disc set has perfect quality.  The picture looks very sharp and clean with good color and contrast.  A fine film grain structure is intact.

Months after seeing it there were scenes that stuck with me (much like my favorite of the year, Inglourious Basterds) and it proved further to me that this is a really fun film for repeat viewings. It puts together a well-constructed story (despite being controversial) with truly dedicated actors/actresses and grand set pieces that feel really worthwhile rather than tawdry reminders that this is a summer movie (that was actually intended originally for a winter release). If you haven't seen this movie then you really need to put renting it at the top of your list for movies to check out - definitely above pretty much anything playing in your local theater right now (at the time of this posting, at least).

Moving swiftly along: I was a little disappointed with the overall presentation of this set. First of all, the slip case for the Blu-ray box had the back side with the run time and pictures and such just tacked on with the junk that credit card companies use to send you new cards. I like the fact that the Blu-ray case itself is full-on Chris Pine's face (the one peeking through the title on the slip case), and on the other side is a close up of Zachary Quinto's face as Spock. I loved the focus in the marketing of the theatrical release on the characters as being powerful enough imagery to sell the film - it's simple and it works. What I was really more disappointed in was the overall menu system. It's not terrible, but I just expected something cooler given that it's Star Trek, especially compared to Iron Man. There's also like 3 trailers (or ads, as I like to call them) and a video game ad to start the feature film disc, but I actually just figured out today that you can hit the 'pop-up menu' button on your Blu-ray player remote to skip straight to the top menu (I don't recall ever hitting any menu button a DVD and going straight to the main menu until I watched all the ads).

Why am I whining about something so trivial? Because that's about all I can complain about here. I was floored by the ridiculous video quality here. I can't recommend it as a gold standard for introducing people to Blu-ray necessarily because it doesn't have bright colors like Planet Earth, but I think the only Blu-ray I own now that looks better than it is Wall-E. Still, the transitions between dark scenes in this movie and those with color are quite smooth with all the colors looking very true to how they should be (the more vibrant they're supposed to be the more awesome they look on your TV). There are a lot of face close ups in this movie and the clarity in even these shots made me want to get up off my couch and just applaud the folks who did this transfer. If you are disappointed with the video quality of this disc, no matter how big or high-end your TV is, there may be something wrong with you (or your TV video settings). I don't have a high-end surround system so I don't want to pass judgement on sound, but it does sound great as far as I can tell. I can't complain about anything except for that maybe it's a bit soft in some places. Clarity is stellar, even in scenes where I was afraid I would be straining my ears to understand what they're saying.

There are so many special feature videos on the second disc that I couldn't get through all of them. What' truly remarkable is that each and every video you see on these discs is in high definition. I think the movie itself certainly looks better than the special features, but we're really talking about shades of gray here because they still look like you're watching an HD channel and whatever the aspect ratio is on them fits my widescreen TV perfectly (whereas the movie has black bars on top and bottom). There's actual more content here (in minutes) than the running time of the feature film, and this is one of those movies that actually has interesting backstories for how every aspect of the production process came about so they're pretty addictive if you have an afternoon/evening to spare going through them all. The deleted scenes are also more interesting than you normally find on a home video release, including the original opening sequence of Spock's birth. The only other features on this disc are a gag reel, all 3 trailers, and 3-d models of the Enterprise and Nero's vessels with details about specific parts of them. As a cherry on top, these features actually have subtitles (which, in my experience, is pretty rare). On the main disc, there's also commentary, which I didn't listen to a whole lot of it but I have to say that it was hard to stop watching once I did turn it on because it's very much like you're peering into the minds of the writers and producers in the format of a candid, relaxed conversation that doesn't feel forced or scripted at all. I don't usually listen to these, but I think I'll have to make an exception here.

Simply put, if you have a Blu-ray player and liked Star Trek at all, you're really doing a disservice to yourself by not picking this up. The studios are trying this crazy thing now where they price Blu-rays equivalent to DVDs instead of price-gouging, so $20 for this one is more than reasonable. They really didn't put this out there to set up for a double dip, or they're doing so with great stupidity because I can't think of what else you'd realistically want from a Blu-ray set for this movie in any sort of re-release. It's going to quickly become one of favorite Blu-rays, for sure.",1259020800,6,5747,4.491395793499044
3472612,4,B001AVCFJM,"You get a lot for your money with the Blu-ray set.  Even the regular DVD set that includes the bonus digital copy gives you a lot of bang for your buck.  The movie itself, however, is fun but far from perfect.

The film opens with a scene that almost caused me to walk out on the movie at the theaters --- a scene with a key character's wife going into labor at just the wrong moment, and it shows her being hurriedly attended to as everything comes crashing down around her.  If there is a more over-used cliche in cinema, I don't know what it could be.  I remember rolling my eyes during this scene and thinking that if this is the level of originality we can expect in this film, this is going to be painful to sit through.

Then later in the film, Kirk is ejected from the Enterprise onto some sort of ice planet.  But this being a movie, he lands pretty much right next to a cave where ""old Spock"" just happens to be (and for different reasons -- he wasn't placed there to aid Kirk) and they just happen to be walking distance from an Starfleet Academy outpost.  With the outpost so nearby, it makes one wonder why Spock chose to remain in the cave and hadn't gone there already.  Hmmm.  Again, big ice planet....and Kirk just HAPPENS to land near Spock and the outpost.  Convenient and a wild coincidence, eh?  That's Hollywood for you!  Writers must get paid by the cliche, I guess.

And there are plenty of other examples in this movie where logic and common sense took a backseat to production design (cough cough -- interior design of Nero's ship -- cough cough), but I'll let those go for now.

Aside from the plentiful in-jokes, this ""Star Trek"" is nothing more than sufficiently enjoyable.  It is decent enough fun, but not so much as to warrant the fawning it has received from certain fans.

In fact, I would suspect that certain hard-core fans would like this movie LESS than some of the more casual and less-demanding fans of the franchise.

But it's just a movie, folks.  Either you'll like it or you won't.  You might be the kind who buys it out of a sense of fanbase loyalty but never watches it more than once or twice.  It won't enhance your life and it won't degrade it either.  It's just a movie.

3472619,5,B001AVCFJM,"This film really blew me away. More of a reboot than a prequel (which the franchise needed after some rather skimpy box office returns with the last few Star Trek films), this one does not disappoint. Director J.J. Abrams & crew hit the reset button on the entire Trek lore & go back to the beginning. We get to see Kirk's father George sacrifice himself to save 800 lives, which simultaneously, ushers in the birth of James (a ""life in the shadow of death"" metaphor). The film smartly shifts back & forth between the childhoods of young Jim Kirk on Earth & young Spock on Vulcan, an interesting contrast between two individuals out of control & seeking understanding in their lives. All the key characters eventually intersect at Starfleet Academy, in which, three years into their training, a galactic emergency arises that whisks the cadets off on to their first mission on the Enterprise. A deep space mission that unfolds a dangerous tale of genocide & revenge.
The look of ST is quite breathtaking from scene to scene, and it's obvious that the cast & crew wanted this film to have an epic feel to it, which it certainly does. The action barrels through the film like a juggernaut, but wisely, doesn't skimp on story or characterization. And this young cast of newcomers have amazingly captured the essence of their already-familiar characters. Chris Pine is fun as the wrecklessly ambitious Kirk; Zachary Quinto turns in an unerringly measured performance as the internally conflicted Spock; Zoe Saldana gets a more expanded role than her predecessor Nichelle Nichols did as the assertive Uhura; Eric Bana as the film's baddie, the enraged & vengeful Romulan criminal Nero...well, I could go on & on about the cast. They all did terrific jobs. And did I mention the great Leonard Nimoy plays a key role in the story? I won't spoil it for you!
Great special effects; great performances; great writing, producing & directing. And the familiar ST humor & thrills. This one has it all! So grab your popcorn & soda, because even if your not a Trekkie, you're still going to have a blast watching this flick!",1258934400,,2109,4.7967032967032965

3472621,3,B001AVCFJM,"I guess the best way to put it is that Star Trek was neither as bad as I had feared or as good as I had hoped.  Below are a list of my plusses and minuses and a few notes:

Plus Side:

Visuals - the Enterprise looked amazing.
Casting - Zachary Quinto was very good as Spock and most of the rest of the cast did a great job with two major exceptions.
Spock - Leonard Nimoy, as alway, was awesome
Energy - it definitely had a fast, high energy pace sure to appeal to new fans as well as the current fan base.

Minus Side:

Logic - I'm sorry but there were huge gaps of logic at certain times.  The interior of the Enterprise had gigantic chambers, dozens of feet high with huge water pipes and endless random conduits.  It looked ridiculous and just made no sense.  And again, what POSSIBLE reason was there for Spock to maroon Kirk on a planet?  Park him in the brig and let him rot, but marooning someone on a hostile ice planet?  Where, by the way, he happened to meet not only future Spock but Montgomery Scott as well?  I'm as much about forgiving gaping plot holes and logic issues as much as the next guy in the interest of a good story, but they could have done MUCH, MUCH better.
Casting - Eric Bana (sp?) as Nero was horrible.  Of course his dialog was horrible as well, but if you can name me a lamer bad guy in ANY movie, the popcorn is on me.  And Chris Pine tried REALLY hard, but he sounded like a whiny teenager - oh wait, he was...  He's just not Kirk.  I'll give him a pass, though, to the next movie...

So what's my review?  I guess I'm giving the New Star Trek franchise a pass on this one and waiting to see if they do better next time out.",1258934400,4,1660,4.058461538461539
3472622,1,B001AVCFJM,"""Stardate 44...whatever"" - Jim Kirk, Star Trek (2009). Sums up the care taken by Paramount to include the elegant and detail rich universe that once made up Star Trek. ""Star Trek, Star Wars... whatever"" is what I believe the writers and producers decided upon prior to setting out on this high-budget endeavor to destroy one great universe. Is it a good flick? Yes! Is it a good Star Trek? Definitely not.

They summed up their feelings towards us Trekkers in the movie quite nicely: by having ""Admiral"" Archer's prize beagle in a transporter accident thus being lost forever. Their way of saying to us: ""it's our franchise and we can do what we want to it, show us the $"".
3.5 stars if it wasn't a Star Trek Film
0 stars if they claim otherwise.

I'm very glad I boycotted the film in the theaters and decided upon renting it first. This one will not be in my STAR TREK collection, as it simply doesn't belong in that universe.

3472624,5,B001AVCFJM,"I was not a Trekkie when I first saw this movie. I had watched some of ""The Next Generation"" with my mom when I was a kid, and I knew who the characters from the original series are as well as some of the events from that series, but that was pretty much it. And I still thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The action scenes were incredible, the acting was phenomenal, and I really felt myself drawn in to the characters and the story. Everyone was in character but still managed to expound on the canon, and I particularly liked how the scriptwriter and director treated Spock. I cannot possibly recommend this movie enough-- it was a fantastic reboot to a legendary series. It got me to see the original series in fact, and after watching that series I really feel that the actors captured the personalities of their predecessors perfectly. Yes, there were a couple of plot discrepancies, but I didn't even notice them until long after the movie was over, and those differences are negligible in my opinion. Overall, it is a great movie.",1258848000,,1034,4.594594594594595
3472625,4,B001AVCFJM,"I'm not a Trekkie, but I grew up watching the reruns of the old show and the original movies in the 80s.  What makes Star Trek what it is for me are the characters.

While the reboot idea here is probably good for the long-run to take these established characters to new adventures, some things feel out of place big time.  The old Spock angle was used in Generations with Kirk instead.  I'm a huge Leonard Nimoy fan but cameos are a really lazy way to advance the series.  Just tell an original story.  How hard is it really?  I did like the young actors for the most part.  The script lacks the characterizations of Star Trek IV or the nifty plot of Star Trek VI.  I would rank this one somewhere in the middle of the whole collection.  In short, Star Trek is fun without being overly engaging.

Hopefully the next film will have a more solid script with some good science and some good ORIGINAL fiction.

The Blu-Ray presentation is fantastic and ranks with The Dark Knight and Transformers on quality viewing on my Panasonic Plasma.  Sound too is really crisp on my surround sound.  There are plenty of behind the scenes featurettes, which are decent, but I found the commentary to be pretty run-of-the-mill.  I stopped listening to it about half way through.

So as another review here has said, its a fun movie.  Yet not really a great Star Trek movie.  But the Blu-Ray is still a great purchase and a sight to behold if you have the screen to show it off.",1258848000,2,1462,4.411985018726591
3472626,3,B001AVCFJM,"Being a fan of TOS since I was a very young child (I first became enthralled when it got syndicated in the early 70s when I was in elementary school), I awaited to see how Star Trek could be ""re-envisioned"" as it was never something I thought needed to be revisited.  What this movie delivers is a bit like the original series itself, some good, some bad, some awesome and some just...meh.  My husband and I watched the DVD the day it came and then again two days later as we were really torn over the whole ""newness"" of it during the first viewing.  The second viewing definitely helped me better form my opinion.  Overall, the movie is a good basis for what I hope will be a whole series of new movies but it is very far from perfect.  This kind of feels like a pilot episode of a tv show.  You get the basic premise but the whole series direction is still very up in the air with fine-tuning to occur as the series progresses.

The stuff that most definitely works.

Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard McCoy.  In my opinion, the absolutely most perfect part of this film.  It was like watching a young DeForest Kelley.  I've liked Karl Urban since I first saw him in Xena and enjoyed him, as limited as his role was, in both The Two Towers and The Return of the King.  Never could I have imagined that someone could be Bones, other than the original beloved character, but Karl Urban nailed the role so perfectly it was absolutely unbelievable.  Two thumbs up and five stars for his outstanding performance.

Simon Pegg as Montgomery Scott.  I hated Simon Pegg in Shawn of the Dead (the only other thing I've ever seen of his) and absolutely dreaded watching him massacre one of my favorite characters.  However, I was more than pleasantly surprised in his portrayal and very much enjoyed the new Mr. Scott.  Thank you Mr. Pegg for making such a fun and very true to character Scotty.  I look forward to more of the same.

Chris Pine as Captain Kirk.  Wow.  I am actually surprised how much I have come to like the redone Kirk.  The first time I watched the movie I wasn't sure how much I liked the new Kirk.  After thinking about it, how Kirk would have been changed due to the difference in his upbringing with a loving father to one with a cold and unlikable stepfather and his removal from the original Kirk's early life, I realized that Chris Pine has very much created a Kirk who is believable in his changed circumstances but still retaining the basis for a Kirk to care about and want more of.  Cocky, slightly angry but with the basic core of the cowboy diplomat we have long known and loved.

Bruce Greenwood as Captain Pike.  Really enjoyed his portrayal of Captain (now Admiral) Pike and thought his character was well portrayed and liked his inclusion.

The stuff that mostly works.

Anton Yelchin as Chekov.  Still having a hard time with this character.  I liked the enthusiasm and I liked the energy but it was hard to get over the complete lack of similarity to Walter Koenig in either looks or characterization.  He just did not feel like Chekov to me.  And I'm not even going to go into the hair.  He may grow on me...hopefully not in a fungus sort of way.  I will reserve judgment for the next movie.

Zoe Saldana as Uhura.  Pretty but not as exotic looking as Nichelle Nichols, this redone Uhura has promise.  She has the intelligence of the first Uhura but is more sassy and aggressive (well, most of the time).  Like Chekov, I'll wait for the next movie to decide yay or nay.  I think I like her, but part of my holding back is discussed below in stuff I just didn't like.

The stuff that mostly didn't work for me.

John Cho as Sulu.  His portrayal of Sulu feels as bland a bowl of cooked pasta compared to a serving of lasagne.  Something was just missing.  Sulu was never boring or bland.  He might not have been considered a major character for most episodes but George Takei's Sulu was always interesting in my opinion.  I personally wish that James Kyson Lee could have been released from Heroes long enough to take this role because Ando is probably about my favorite character on that show and Mr. Lee would have been able to make Sulu work so much better than John Cho did.

The stuff that didn't work for me.

Zachary Qunito as Spock.  He has the look but goes through the movie with a smirk and an overwhelming show of emotion that is just so not Spock.  Kirk is the one whose entire childhood and adolescence was changed, not Spock.  Quinto plays Spock like he's channeling Sylar on meds.  Only at the very last couple of minutes of the movie does he come close.  Please, oh please, make him watch those few minutes over and over in preparation for the next movie and smack him with a rolled-up newspaper if he tries to portray Spock as he did through most of this one.  If nothing else, please, whatever you do, get rid of the storyline issue that I mention below.

The stuff that so didn't work its not even funny.

The Enterpise.  Why does this new Enterprise look like the Motion Picture version mated with a pregnant guppy, given the Andy Warhol treatment and then had botox injections?  The engine nacelles are absolutely hideous and are the worst part of this nightmarish reimagining of our beloved Enterprise.  The interior just doesn't work, some stuff way too futuristic looking for the time period and some stuff way too antiquated for the time period.  Try to get a little closer to the feel of the Enterprise from the horrid Enterprise series from a few years ago to at least make it tolerable.  Somebody needs to fire whoever came up with this design and get a real Star Trek designer in there for the next movie.  And what's with the bizarre engine noises when the Enterprise is flying?

and the other thing that doesn't work....

(SPOILER - FOR ANYONE WHO HASN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE)

And last but not least, the Spock-Uhura romance.  Okay.  Ick.  The lovey-dovey smooching on the transporter before they beamed over to Nero's ship made me want to turn off the movie or throw up (not sure in which order).  I get that Uhura is interested in Spock in this movie and Spock has the hots for her too.  This is a face/palm situation if I've ever seen one.  I rolled my eyes at my husband when we first watched it and he had the exact same reaction.  This is just not working at all.  Uhura with Kirk, yes.  Uhura with Scotty even (from the ST-V movie).  But Spock with Uhura?????  Uh, no.  Even worse is that its protrayed like they are maybe 10 years old in a sickly sweet, get-me-my-insulin kind of relationship that is just completely unbelievable.",1258848000,3,6587,4.4485355648535565

3472630,1,B001AVCFJM,"Talk about pre-hype:  First off, I am a Star Trek fan.  I was really waiting to see this movie, especially after all the so-called rave-reviews that were on television.  But, how disappointing the movie was (that had fine actors in it) with its lack of a credible story.  The movie was all over the map that just wondered aimlessly.

I remember watching it thinking the movie is ""too busy"", too much like a Star Wars movie with its space battles and the crew bays with shipmen departing...some were even costumed in what appeared to be Star War officer uniforms with caps to boot.  Some of the aliens with their absurd character faces in the bar, another of the nurse with her over-sized eyes on the space shuttle helping to deliver old James Kirk.  Granted, Star Trek has its share of weird alien makeup, but as a whole Star Wars just seems to have a lot more cartoonish looking aliens that just didn't seem to fit well in Star Trek.  Sure enough, after watching the special features, J.J. Abrams mentioned that he wanted to spice up the feel of the franchise with a Star Wars feel to it.  Well, he succeeded in that, but failed miserably with the movie as a whole.

J.J. Abrams needed to heed the old saying that, ""less is more.""

The opening scene with the Romulan space ship that looked like a giant metal squid with it tentacles was ludicrous.  This whole movie just seemed like a kid with too much money just ""having at it"" without really thinking it through and coming up with a decent story line.  I think William Shatner can count his blessings that Abrams wasn't able to work him into the script, because this movie is pretty lame.  I even tried watching it a second and third time to see if it would grow on me...it didn't.  It was just as lack luster and lame as the first viewing.  I kept thinking while watching the first time, ""When's this going to pick up and get better?""  ""Where's the beef?

The scene where Abrams has young Kirk (Chris Pine)slobbering all over an apple while taking the Kobayashi Maru test/exam was idiotic.  Was this act of eating the apple suppose to be conveying a cavalier attitude or something?  It just came across as stupid and juvenile, and it's hard to believe that the writers and/or Abrams thought that particular action in that scene was clever or humorous.

Having said all this, I would watch the next Star Trek movie that he produces, because it can't go anywhere but up.  The first movie, ""Star Trek, The Motion Picture"" suffered from similar antics: too much spectacle with little substance, but then was followed by the ""Wrath of Khan.""  Maybe, lightning will strike twice here, and J.J. Abrams will produce a better movie the second time around.

What Abrams needs to do if he should produce another Star Trek movie is to hire someone like Nicholas Myer to write or co-write the script perhaps with Leonard Nimoy, and have Nicholas Myer direct it, and have Abrams stay the hell out of their way...then you'll probably have something worth watching.  Both men know the essence of Star Trek, and could no doubt right the franchise, and put it back on track.  Some of the best Star Trek movies written and directed have come from those two men.  The only benefit that Abrams could offer is that he's the ""latest flavor of the month"" in Hollywood when it comes to getting movies made...he's the current ""Golden Boy.""  He needs to use that current advantage to secure the financing, but then let other people take over the reins to put out a product worth watching.",1258848000,20,3515,4.5808
3472631,4,B001AVCFJM,"I'm not exactly sure what the negative reviews of this film are all about, as I can only comment from my own experience and history with Star Trek.

First of all, I enjoyed the original series for what it was, way back in the 1960's, when I was about 12 years old.  And I know I always enjoyed the reruns of the original series that I caught as an adult, despite my dislike of William Shatner, who I've always thought of as a pretty bad actor.  But Mr. Spock was cool, and I always thought the basic concept and philosophy of the show was way cool.

I never really enjoyed the earlier Star Trek films, except the Wrath of Khan, and I never got into the ""Trekkie"" mindset or the subsequent ""Next Generation"" shows, etc.  To me, Star Trek was a fun TV show I liked as a kid, and enjoyed in reruns when I caught it; I never gave it much more thought than that.

When I heard they'd made a film based on the original series, I thought it sounded interesting, and when I'd heard some good reviews, I figured I'd check it out.  I went to see it in the movies, something I don't do too much of these days; I usually just wait for the DVD, since I collect movies at home.  But I had a feeling I'd enjoy the film, so I went, and now I own it on DVD.  As a result, I've seen it twice.

What I found was a film that was just as much fun as I'd expected.  What made it, for me, was the ingenious casting.  Each of the young characters look, sound and act like the characters I remember from the original show (except for Kirk, who resembles William Shatner not at all, and I don't really think that's a bad thing).  Young Spock, Bones, Sulu, Chekov, Uhura and Scott are all dead on.  The story was fun, the action never stopped and the bad guy was formidable, so I'm not really sure how much more fans could expect.  Of course, as I said, I never was a big Trek fanatic to begin with; if I was as compulsively obsessed as some seem to be with the story line and the ""time continuum"" and I'm not sure of the significance of that, to be sure, well, I might be upset too.

As it was, I thought it was a pleasant diversion and a good prequel to a TV show I remember fondly.  If you are looking for something that will prop up the continuing saga of Star Trek, the Next Generation, Star Trek Voyager or Deep Space Nine, you may very well want to skip it, because if you're that into the franchise, you will be disappointed.  But for people like me, who were casually amused by the original series, it fills the bill as entertainment.  Which is all I wanted or expected.",1258848000,2,2552,4.129554655870446

Full review will be up on YouTube shortly (stupid limits).

I had to cut my video review short because Amazon wanted me to, but I had a sentence in there that sums my thoughts up.  This is a good movie.  It's NOT a good Star Trek movie.  That's essentially what it boils down to.

I didn't bother seeing this in theaters because quite frankly, I don't go to theaters to watch movies anymore.  The idea of paying a DVD price to watch a movie with a bunch of other germ incubators, crying kids, ringing cell phones and noisy people is not appealing to me anymore like it was when I was a kid.  Coworkers commented how much they enjoyed the movie, but when they told me that time travel was involved I knew this was going to go down hill very fast.  When the Blu-ray came out I bought it with hesitation - but since I had RewardZone points, it was free, so I didn't lose much, thankfully.  I'm so miffed at this movie that I'm going to just use bullets instead of a long out review.

= What Star Trek Does RIGHT =

- CGI is quite good at moments.
- Most of the actors did a good job playing the roles they were meant to (but see WRONG below).
- No campy machines like with Nemesis.
- Great quality audio even without TrueHD.
- Zoe Saldana.

= What Star Trek Does WRONG =

- CGI is apparently all they cared about, because the story is severely lacking.
- There was no love angle between Uhura and Spock.  Never happened.  Latent attraction, maybe early on.  But never such a blatant display of affection.
- Chekov looks and acts nothing like the real deal.  That actor was absolutely horrid trying to reprise what Walter Koenig made famous.
- Scotty was way over the top.  Accent would come and go as it pleased, it was clear the guy was not Scottish in the least, and he was thrown in at the end with no real purpose to things.
- Old Spock felt misplaced and added for fanservice only.
- Pike was way too old.  In the first episode of TOS he was a young, 20-something year old.  If this took place prior to that maiden voyage, there's no reason for him to look that old.  If it took place after that voyage then Spock/Kirk shouldn't have been cadets.  Total discontinuity.
- Presents a ""what if"" scenario that totally and blatantly disregards the Star Trek canon in almost every way.

So what does this mean?  If you liked Enterprise you'll probably like this one, because Enterprise in a lot of ways deviated from what made Star Trek famous too, but at least Enterprise had the decency NOT to use true canon characters when doing what it was doing.  For $20 it's a fair price, but if you're a Star Trek fan, don't go in expecting a Star Trek movie.  It's for people who want to see many things blown up and campy stunts.  If you're into that type of stuff this movie will be perfect for you.",1258848000,3,3190,4.8250460405156534

3472635,5,B001AVCFJM,"I have been watching Star Trek since it first aired Thursday evening in 1966.  This movie, as the viewer will discover, essentially is a ""reset"" of the original ""Star Trek"" future history; I will give away no more than that.  Star Trek 2009 is a hugely successful prequel to the Original Series scenario. Here, Kirk is a Midshipman at Starfleet Academy, Spock is a recent graduate, and the other members of the bridge crew are in various earlier stages of their careers. Every single one of them is well-cast in my opinion (Uhura, in particular, is excellent, and incredibly beautiful if I may say so.)

The storyline is gripping, and despite almost too much action, it holds the viewer's interest at all times. By the way, the casting of Spock's parents Sarek and Amanda is impeccable, and Amanda is ravishing in this prequel. No wonder Sarek fell in love with her!

The special effects in this film are spectacular, and beautiful. One anomaly, if that is what it is, is that this USS Enterprise (under command of Captain Pike) is cooler and more high tech than the original, or even than most of the Enterprise incarnations in the various films. No matter, I liked that.

Star Trek purists may have some problems with this film because it is not entirely consistent with the Star Trek universe as most of us understood it, even from the beginning. Spock for a time is senior to Kirk, for example. Further, I always had the understanding that Kirk and Spock did not know one another, at least not well, until Kirk relieved Captain Pike as commander of the USS Enterprise. Well, this film does away with that notion! Obviously this was necessary if the main characters of the original series, i.e. Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu, McCoy, were to have major roles in this story, as indeed they do. I'll say it again: the casting here was just superb.

Inconsistencies aside, this film absolutely reinvigorates the Star Trek franchise in a big way. I am certain that all fans of Star Trek will love this film, and it will no doubt capture new adherents from the younger set. The casting is so good that the ground is set for many sequels of this prequel, I trust and hope.",1258848000,,2171,4.640625

It's a Bold, gutsy re-invention of a classic story and the new twists and liberties may turn off some, but most of us jumped right on board.

The film is great, the DVD/Blu-Ray is excellent (no padding, just special features that are worth watching).  I am so happy that Paramount has done such a recent 180 for Star Trek and it's fans - they're actually doing right by us on the big screen and on DVD - hopefully this continues.",1258848000,3,583,4.1875

There is enough Trek Cannon there to satisfy fans of the originals and enough that is different and fresh and new to entertain non-Trek fans.  The casting by April Webster is brilliant...Zachary Quinto as Spock is almost eerie and Karl Urban as Bones is brilliant and Chris Pine brings a freshness to Kirk.  Throw in the utterly appealing Zoey Saldana, an interesting twist with Spock and the amazingly appealing John Cho, and you got a stellar cast.

I was expecting very little from this movie and I walked away remembering why I had always liked the original Trek so very much.  I can't wait to see where the series goes from here.",1258761600,3,749,4.687022900763359

I don't typically splurge on higher-cost collectibles such as this, but with its limited run, and great quality, I'm glad I did. Oh and the Bluray is also a great piece of work. The special features were very informative and entertaining, especially as they touched on the issues with 're-envisioning' the Star Trek universe, from many creative perspectives.

3472640,5,B001AVCFJM,"WOW.

The Soundtrack was great.

Before I knew anything about Star Trek or the Star Ship Enterprise, I knew about Spock. I think I even had a Spock lunchbox. Captain Kirk, who? Never heard of him. That goes to show you how iconic Spock is.

Zachary Quinto was perfect in this role. Even though I do question how difficult it is to play a character that shows no emotion.  You probably don't need much training for that. You just say everything with a straight face and talk in one, flat monotone. Nonetheless, Zachary Quinto was very convincing as Spock.

I took issue with Kirk. I found him to way too arrogant to sympathize with. At times I wanted him to get his but kicked, which I don't think is the direction in which the directors wanted my emotions to go. Surely, they wanted us rooting for Kirk, not against him. But when I saw him as a kid, running from police, I wanted to strangle him and knock some sense into him. As he grows up, he doesn't change much.

The fact that Kirk was wild, rebellious, often acting without thinking first, made me just livid. But he has heart and courage.

Loved the diversity. So often in Science Fiction/Fantasy movies there is a lack of diversity. Even Harry Potter had a few Asians and blacks.

I'm always put off by Science Fiction/Fantasy movies that take place in these mythical worlds where writers can conjure up flying pigs, disappearing witches and elves who glitter at night, but we might be hard pressed to find a Asian, Black or Hispanic in the cast of all-white, non-alien actors.

I applaud Star Trek for the diversity, and I applaud them for putting Chekov in, WITH HIS ACCENT.

I think this is the best Trek movie since Wrath of Khan.

This movies goes back before the original Star Trek. This goes back to the beginnings of how Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew came to be.

If you ever wondered about those comments Kirk and Spock said over the years, how Kirk and Spock, as well as the rest of the main crew, met, started in star fleet, and even their childhood that made them who they are (their rebelliousness and struggles, those life-changing events, etc.) are done quickly, and brings you up to who they become in Starfleet.

The actors, casting, etc. not only do the actors look like the original actors at different stages in their lives, but also took on the mannerisms, how they developed, and so on...

I have avoided Blu-Ray up until now, but after seeing this version on DVD, I wished I had seen it in the theater, so will have to get it on Blu-Ray and finally break down and get a Blu Ray player with surround sound. If movies start to be shot like this, the having Blu Ray will be worth it.

The rich sound, video and music are all worth putting it through a high-end home theater system!

Trekkie or not, this is a great movie! If you are a Trekkie from the '60s, you won't be disappointed! Huge insights into the characters we all came to love, and how they became who they were!

Well acted, well directed, well done!

3472646,2,B001AVCFJM,"This film was interesting only from a historical perspective. It lacks depth and substance, and tries to make up for a lousy plot and shallow characters with flashy, useless special effects that only detract, bore and annoy.

SPOILER PLOT. We see how the paths of Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Scotty, Chekov and Sulu intersected, beginning from Kirk's birth. This timeline is different from that of the regular, known Trek universe. A Romulan from the future has traveled back in time to avenge the blowing up the planet Romulus, which apparently the elder Spock promised to avert but wasn't able to. Now Angry Romulan wants to kill major players in Starfleet, as well as blow up Spock's native planet Vulcan, in the hope that Spock will suffer as Mr. Angry did (in the future). Angry does, in fact, manage to kill Kirk's father on a ship; Kirk's about-to-give-birth mother and the rest of the crew escape while Kirk's dad dies defending them.

A now adult young Kirk joins Starfleet under unusual circumstances. Kirk and his cohorts prevent Angry Romulan from doing any more damage, thanks to the wisdom of Elder Spock, who shows up in this timeline to advise Kirk and his own younger self. Elder Spock gives Scotty the formula about life-saving technology Scotty will develop in the future -- or DID develop in Elder Spock's future timeline. (You still with me?) In this film, the now new timeline is not repaired. Kirk's father still died defending his pregnant wife and crew, young Spock and Kirk's friendship gets off to a bumpy start, and more. However, at least there will be no more damage from Mr. Angry.

CHARACTERIZATION. New Scotty sounds just like the old one (but we don't learn anything about him). Kirk does a pretty good job as a younger version of Shatner. And Spock is decent, if lacking in the essence of what it means to be Vulcan. Uhura is competent and spunky; too bad the original Uhura was never given this many professional credentials and tasks that this younger version was given. (I appreciate the efforts to overcome the sexism of the original, first Star Trek.) However, all this cannot rescue this film. (By the way, what was Uhura doing French kissing Spock -- and Spock kissing her back? It didn't fit in anyplace, and certainly did not follow the original.)

DOWNSIDES. This film is more of a novelty and the glimmering of an undeveloped, good idea. It lacks the spiritual dimension, psychological sophistication and developed relationships between the characters of Star Trek's best films and TV episodes. Elder Spock telling younger Spock to ""follow your feelings"" doesn't constitute enough of a worthwhile message to redeem this flick, although it's always nice to see Leonard Nimoy. The soundtrack is relentless, noisy and distracting, and overshadows the dialogue at times. The visuals are simply ugly and busy, looking as though too many hand-held cameras are working overtime. I got dizzy watching all this tiring pointless activity, and had my finger poised on the fast-forward button. And due to the excessive and unnecessary action, this film needed a good editing; about 20 to 25 minutes less would have made it much better.

CONCLUSION. What I loved most about Star Trek's finest TV and movies were its messages, acting, and character development. This film just didn't do it for me. Die-hard fans may like and even love this flick. But for my taste, the best in Star Trek -- where there are socially redeeming messages, great characters, humor and depth as well as action -- is still Voyager, all seven seasons on TV.",1258761600,10,3556,4.890547263681592
3472647,4,B001AVCFJM,"Not being a Trekkie, I had heard 'good things' about this movie. So I rented it and I loved it.
The story was great, the cinema photography was great, the special effects & just the visuals were great..but on top of that there is some really great acting and a story thrown in to boot. This is steps above the mindless put your brain to rest mindless explosion films that we usually get these days.
This film was everything Transformers Revenge of the Fallen & GI Joe should have been. Those movies went for either toilet humor or smart-ass been there done that attitudes..
This movie has characters that we can care about. The Capt. Kirk , Spock and the whole crew of today actually had personality, which a lot of movies such as this have been lacking. You want Kirk to succeed in defeating Nero, you want Spock & Kirk to get on the same page. Zachary Quinto was great as Mr. Spock ! JJ Abrams did a great directing job as you can tell he was really , REALLY into making this a blockbuster..
What is great about this movie is you need not watch the old TV show you're not fan or any of the earlier Star Trek films. I watched this as a 'stand alone' film and it paid off big time for me. This is the kind of film that should get a sequel, but if not, the Star Trek movie franchise can end on a very high note.
This was a fun ride for 2 hours, with the outer space battles , Kirk being chased around by some really cool creatures & well, i hope this doesn't count as a spoiler but Leonard Nimoy does play an important role in this as well.
I can confidently highly recommend this movie, not just for die hard Star Trek trekkies, but for those that want to see a good science fiction action film that takes itself seriously, which is very unlike a lot today's science fiction movies. There are some funny and amusing moments but this is not a comedy or shot in bad taste to insult the franchise...
The 2 disc DVD is the way to go with tons of bonus features...not just on the first disc but a whole entire disc with lots of supplements...plus an audio commentary...just a great movie and DVD release..
Brilliant film !",1258761600,2,2117,4.255583126550868
3472648,5,B001AVCFJM,"I guess I should admit up front that I was and am an avid fan of Star Trek, TOS. In spite (or because) of this, however, both my 16 year-old daughter and I find this film thoroughly enjoyable.

To a degree, I understand some of the complaints about the character development not being up to expectations. I think there are two good reasons for this. First, the characters are young, and - particularly Spock - are still in their formative stages. Yes, in some instances, Kirk is ""over the top,"" and Spock has yet to master the conflict inherent in his ancestry. Some forget that Vulcans have not eliminated emotions: they merely attempt to control them with an iron-willed - albeit intellectual - intensity. Similarly, have some of us forgotten the wildness of our youth? Clearly, nobody is born knowing how to do this. In both cases, however, there are moments in the film that reveal the men Spock and Kirk will become.

Second, there will be sequels. I remember one of the main criticisms of the first Harry Potter movie was the apparent lack of character development, but the writers remembered, if viewers did not, that there were six (now seven) films to go. You can't trot everything out in the first edition. Let's just hope the Star Trek writers also remember that the interplay between the three main characters is the heart and soul of the original series, and that this process will be one of evolution rather than metamorphosis. In short, if some viewers are just looking for hyper-extended plotlines overwhelmed with special effects, there are certainly enough examples of those circling about. Star Trek, TOS, on the other hand, is character driven, and early indications suggest that the present creators are aware of that.

The re-creation of Star Trek (re-boot doesn't quite cover it) was a formidable undertaking attendant with all sorts of baggage, passions, responsibilities, and expectations. It is also a film with two audiences to please - one familiar, one not; one young, one....well, you get the idea. With that in mind, those who have delivered the latest version of this (apparently) indefatigable saga should be commended for a job well done. For sure, it's a lot to squeeze into just two hours, but the final product is exciting, refreshingly familiar, and - most important - fun. It is well worth two hours of anyone's time. Some of us, in fact, would be grateful to age as well.",1258761600,,2411,4.818840579710145
3472649,4,B001AVCFJM,"Simply put this is a retelling of a great story, with Nimoy thrown in to provide a tidbit of continuity for the Trekkies (which worked well IMHO). Not too much techie sci-fi with alot of nonsensical technobabble. Just enough to add a reasonable level of future technologies without getting into the details. When the transporter saves our heroes one minute but cannot do the same exact thing the next time its not important to know why. Not in the context of a 2 hour movie. This approach greatly helps. Good action... as all adventures should have. Good characters, albeit without alot of time for development because things have to move fast. Natural for a first movie. Perfect interplay between Kirk, Spock and McCoy. All the technical aspects of the bluray edition are first rate. I just wish I had a bigger TV for it.

I guarantee that many of those who do not like the movie would instead think it was great if all the characters were different, not a prequel, but still the same exact story minus the time travel aspects. Also, like all prequels when it goes against what people have built up over the years what they think the various events should have been, or how they occurred, some take issue.

But thats ok. So why say that? Because when all is said and done this is a good Star Trek adventure and a worthy addition to a collection... unlike any of the other summer blockbusters that came out in 2009. Just don't expect the sci-fi equivalent of Shakespeare.",1258761600,2,1471,4.6106870229007635

I have been a trek fan longer than Jar Jar Abrams has been alive and since he admitted he was no fan then we know why we got what we got. People say it is a fresh start, but I see rehashed elements from all the other Trek movies past. The ending is the same as the last two films where we finally get aboard the bad guys ship was a last minute fight. Missed opportunities for some great space battles (the Enterprise arriving after the battle at Vulcan matching the lack of battle in Insurrection when we come back from Picard on the Baku planet to Riker and the Enterprise is already damaged smoke coming from its naucells, not seeing how it managed to get damaged). The slap stick humor of Sulu not being able to get the Enterprise into warp matches some of the more child like humor of Star Trek 5 - it is humor that is more forced into the story instead of coming naturally with the story line like in Star Trek 4.  And even before the time line change takes place we have the Kelvin which seems to carry 800 people. Without the time line change that would mean starfleet started building smaller ships by Pikes time in The Cage where his ship only carries 203 people, not to mention the more advance technology with life sign tracking system on the Captain of the Kelvin (remember, until Nero attacks the Kelvin there is yet no time line change so this more advance technology violated continuity). Other continuity if the scene had not been deleted - Kirks older brother is named Johnny? It was George Samuel Kirk Jr. Remember he was born before Nero showed up so no time line change to cause a change in his name.)  I have liked every star trek series there has been. TOS is still my favorite. I can see where people did not like DS9, it was dark for a star trek series but it still had its moments. I have liked all first ten movies. Nemesis was my least favorite because it was too dark for a trek movie ( my least favorite till Star Trek 11).  This is the worse star trek ever because of a lack of knowledge and care by the people who control being executives at Paramount and J.J. Abrams. The most illogical thing out of this screwed up mess is why did Nimoy have anything to do with it. Was He broke? Shatner has been cordial about not being in the film, but I just think it is because he did not like the story. His novel was a far superior take on Kirk and Spocks first meeting. I would have liked the film more if they did a straight remake instead of trying to connect it to the original story line.

I know that Gene would not approve of what they have done to his dream. If he were alive today, this movie would have never been made.

The original TV shows and movies were a bright and wonderful adventure. They gave us a positive glimpse into the future, even if it was just fantasy. The shows had great special effects, but they weren't the whole show. They had real story lines to follow. It was an escape into a better time. The cast members from ST:TOS through ST: Enterprise, became our hero's. We knew personal details about each character like they were old friends. We got to be involved with their personal lives and careers. They were real human beings that acted their roles well. Even though the look and technology in the shows advanced with time, the original formula that was a Gene Roddenberry signature was always easily recognized, and truly appreciated. When Gene passed away, Rick Berman and his crew followed very closely to Gene's formula, and kept the feel of Star Trek alive and well. If this is what you are expecting with this new Star Trek movie, you will be greatly disappointed.

Remember the last Ford Thunderbird that was made? It really wasn't a Thunderbird. It was a completely different car with the name ""Thunderbird"" put on it to attract buyers. This new Star Trek movie is not really a Star Trek Movie. They just kept the original crew names and the Star Trek label to attract older Trekkie's.

This latest Star Trek movie is very different in every way. I can only think that the writers and producers did this to attract a whole new younger, texting, video game playing generation. JJ Abrams has turned Star Trek into a dark version of itself. It looks fake like a video game turned into a movie. The old Roddenberry formula has been thrown out the window, and replaced with a dark ""What if"" version. In other words, what if Star Trek had not began and played out the way it was originally written and portrayed over the last 45 years? Kirk, McCoy, Chekov, Sulu, Scottie, and Uhura were never on the Enterprise under Capt. Pike. But they are in this movie. The entire design and layout of the Enterprise from bow to stern is completely changed. The bridge has technology that resembles the 24th century episodes, except the main viewer is now a glass window instead of the original electronic screen. Engineering looks like an old factory with water pipes running everywhere. Even the transporter beam now looks like cutesy swirling sparkling stars, instead of the original color beams that faded the person away. In this version, it seems that Uhura and Spock have the hots for each other. What's up with that? And Vulcan has been destroyed. This movie depended completely on CGI special effects and very little story line for the characters. For all of us true Star Trek fans, Star Trek ended with the movie ""Nemesis"", and the TV series, ""Enterprise"".

On the technical side, the BluRay version is no better than the standard DVD. Many scenes are in a haze, some look grainy like an old movie. I have standard DVDs that look better. Also, way too much editing. Scenes are constantly changing, making it hard to follow the actors and action.

The Amazon.com details for the BluRay version claims it is in Dolby Digital 5.1 Extended surround. But it is actually in True HD surround. This means if your audio system is ""Pre TrueHD"", you will not hear it in Dolby Digital 5.1. Instead you will hear it in Dolby Pro-Logic only. The real joke is, you can switch to the French or Spanish audio tracks and hear the audio in full Dolby Digital 5.1. But the English track is in Pro-Logic for most ""Pre TrueHD"" system owners. If your home theater system is ""Pre TrueHD"" you will have to return the BluRay version and get the standard DVD instead. It is the only way you will get to hear the audio in Dolby Digital 5.1, and I know the picture quality will be as good. Standard DVDs do not carry True HD audio, so it will be in Dolby Digital 5.1 EX or DTS-ES6.1, or both.

Overall, the movie was filled with excitement, had a few good moments, and it was nice to see the older Mr. Spock from the future. He was the only sign that reminded me I was actually watching a Star Trek movie. Just don't waste your money on the BluRay version. Only buy the Standard DVD. If future Star Trek movies look anything like this one, I probably will just wait for it to get on HBO to check it out.",1258675200,41,5068,4.490238611713666
3472653,2,B001AVCFJM,"Apparently my taste runs a bit different from others here, but I was looking forward to a prequel to the original series, not a parallel universe in which Vulcan is destroyed, the victim of an instantaneous black hole. What's worse, how can ""red matter"" possibly create such a singularity when mass is required.

I understand the issues involved in time travel, but J.J. Abrams should have left a way for Vulcan to be restored; otherwise it's not really a prequel at all, for it throws the entire time line off. Also missing is Gary Mitchell, Kirk's best friend.

It does little good to make such a movie if one is not entirely familiar with the story and characters. I also found the hard rock music to be noisy and distracting. Part of the brilliance of STAR WARS was the beauty and soul reflected in the music.

Perhaps in the next movie, things can be made right. As it is, the movie did not end on a satisfying note to me. Given the new timeline, there's a thousand different ways for Kirk (or Spock0 to die. We'll also have to forget the entire series, because the stories never happened in the new universe.

In my view, it would have been better to have entirely new characters and place them in an entirely new time. Of course, if both Vulcan and Nero reappear in another time and place, it might make for another story, but that, too, would be vastly unsatisfying. Face it, gang, they dropped the ball this time. Despite this, the cast, writing and acting were fine. The story sucks.",1258675200,8,1493,4.518518518518518

A+ for all the writers involved. And coudos to the actors for pulling it off. Great character developement. Great excitement level. Such a masterful foundation has been layed here, that this aspect of the franchise could last for many years to come. I absolutely want to see more of these people and how their relationships develop as they continue to save the universe from destruction and uphold all those traits that make the human race worth while. This movie is inspirational and uplifting - which is what hollywood should be about.",1258675200,2,871,4.699346405228758

3472657,4,B001AVCFJM,"I enjoyed this film in general.  Unlike many Trek fans, I did not have a problem with the pace or some of the upgrades.  I felt that these were no different than when they changed the appearance of the Klingons in the early films.  They simply had more technology and a bigger budget.

I liked the fact that the film was not all about technology - that like all of the television series, it centered on the relationships of the characters.  I felt that the actors did a good job in portraying each character.  I especially liked Karl Urban's portrayal of Dr. McCoy.  It was almost like watching a young Deforest Kelley.  I also really liked Simon Pegg's portrayal of Mr. Scott.  However, I did have some problems with how the characters were written.  Even in an alternate universe, some things were just not acceptable.  First, was it really necessary for Kirk to get into so many fist fights?  This got a bit boring after awhile.  Second, I realize that Spock is half human and that this is a young Spock, but no way would he have had such an emotional relationship with Uhuru.  I could see Kirk in this kind of a relationship with Uhuru, but not Spock.  With all the emotion that Spock had in this film, why even bother to make him a Vulcan?  And the Checkov character was really unacceptable.  Chekov was late coming to the series.  He was very young then.  At that time, Kirk was in his 30's.  There is NO WAY that Kirk and Chekov would have been at the Academy together.  Chekov was portrayed as a Russian Wesley Crusher - the young, eager ensign with all the answers.  And what about Uhuru?  it seemed like for the most part, she was just there for some romantic relief.  They mentioned her ability with languages.  She did replace the communications officer because of her expertise with the Romulan language, but then they never let her character do anything with it.  Her role was just fluff.

Despite all of this, I did enjoy the movie.  I liked seeing Kirk, the wild child in his convertible, I loved the reaction of the old Spock when he first saw Kirk and the resurrection of the line, ""I have been and always shall be your friend.""  I loved every scene with Bones McCoy and Montgomery Scott and wished there had been more. I felt like one of the other reviewers that even though there were some problems with this film, it was still like seeing an old friend after a long time.

I must also mention the score.  I loved the way they used music during the battle scenes instead of just having the usual sound effects.  This was very creative and artistic.

I hope they make a sequel.  I hope that in it Spock is a lot more Vulcan.  Chekov is played down a bit.  Uhuru is more of a professional and less a love interest.  And I hope that somehow, through the magic of time travel, they manage to revive the planet Vulcan and Spock's mother.",1258675200,4,2852,4.415384615384616
3472658,5,B001AVCFJM,"I'll keep it short because a lot of other people have already worded reviews much better than mine. I loved this movie. (How's that for short?)

I've been a Trek fan for almost all of my 29 years, starting when I was a little kid watching TOS in syndication and every other series as they came out on TV over the years. I own all of the original series episodes, all 10 previous movies (DVD and Blu-Ray) and love watching them regularly (and will continue to enjoy them even if that timeline is a divergence!). I love that there will be new adventures with all of my favorite characters in the years to come, and hopefully a new horde of fans who will discover TOS/TNG/DS9/Voy/Ent through JJ Abrams efforts. I also love that this film respects and allows the other films and series to continue to exist for the continuity nerds out there to argue about for decades to come.

To the people taking issue with someone messing around with the timeline...relax. Trek has always been loosey goosey with the timeline/continuity when the needs of the many outweighed the needs of the few (ahem). You can still enjoy the previously released Star Trek continuity...and if you really want to, you can hate and ignore any new material coming from JJ and company. I'm going to look forward to new adventures, hopefully for years to come. Gene Roddenberry himself hoped that someday someone would take his stories and do them one better...and I think this film has done it in spades.",1258675200,3,1469,4.6461538461538465

3472660,3,B001AVCFJM,"This new ""Star Trek"" reconceives the early days of the U.S.S. Enterprise, when Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, Lt. Uhura, Scotty, Sulu, and Chekov first boarded the starship on which they would seek out new life, new civilizations, and boldly go where no man had gone before. This looks like it might be an attempt to reboot the ""Star Trek"" franchise from the beginning. I doubt it will succeed in that, but the film is entertaining enough in its own right. Trek fans will know that James T. Kirk succeeded Capt. Christopher Pike to command the Enterprise. This ""Star Trek"" accelerates Jim Kirk's ascent to the captain's chair and changes Pike's and Spock's roles by means of an alternative timeline created by the unfortunate results of a singularity in the 24th century.

James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) grows into a reckless young man in Iowa of the 23rd century, as the half-human Spock (Zachary Quinto) struggles with his dual identity and rebels a little by attending Starfleet Academy instead of the Vulcan Science Institute. When Kirk gets into fisticuffs with some Starfleet cadets, Capt. Pike (Bruce Greenwood) taunts him with the memory of his deceased father, a heroic Starfleet officer. Never one to decline a dare, Kirk thinks he can do just as well and joins the Starfleet recruits. Before he can graduate, however, all officers are called upon to join an armada replying to a distress call from Vulcan. A rogue Romulan vessel under the command of a Captain Nero (Eric Bana) has appeared out of nowhere, bent on destruction and looking for an ""Ambassador Spock"".

""Star Trek"" movies tend to throw out the rules and regulations upon which Starfleet relies to enforce its ideals, making the officers into loose canons. Here, we get a chaotic chain of command to go with Dan Mindel's shaky, spinning camera. This allows for a lot of arguing, disorder, and an express route to the command of the Enterprise for Kirk. Director J.J. Abrams consciously emulated a ""Star Wars"" pace, which belies the basically bureaucratic nature of Starfleet. He takes the inspiration too far in a silly sequence on an ice planet that is straight out of ""The Empire Strikes Back"". There are some anachronisms and inconsistencies that Trekkers will probably not like. I think it owes much of its appeal to images that allude to the original television series, but this ""Star Trek"" is kind of an endearing mess.

The DVD (Paramount 2009 single disc): Bonus features are one featurette, a Gag Reel (6 min), and an audio commentary. ""A New Vision"" (20 min) interviews director J.J. Abrams, the film's producers, and some of the creative crew about the Star Wars influence and making things look real by doing as much in-camera as possible, minimizing visual effects. The audio commentary is by J.J. Abrams and producers Bryan Burk, Alex Kurtman, Damon Lindelof, and Roberto Orci. It is conversational but contains a lot of information. There is constant commentary on story, editing, how the script developed, what was included in film and why, camera work, sound, and more. Subtitles available for the film in English, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in French, Spanish.",1258675200,,3158,4.9547169811320755
3472661,5,B001AVCFJM,"...Look... This is Star Trek.
This Is bold, original, and exactly what we needed as fans. It has Sexuality and Emotion.
It Has Hot Green skinned women, and People dieing during the birth of children. It Has Romulans, and More emotion. It Has Spock dealing with his emotion while exploring his sexuality. And then there's Scotty, feeling alienated and alone with his litle friend, exploring his sexuality and emotion. And his constant hunger that never dies.
I was skeptic to begin with, and when I heard JJ Abrahms was directing it, I thought o.k. it could be good. His Seires ""LOST"" deals alot with Emotion, and Jack and Sawyer's personal sexuality for Kate. and above all else emotion.
Star Trek has had enough long winded, preachy, movies dealing with issues of society, but we needed something that was over the top, nonstop action, just so we could fall in love with the original characters all over again. (Falling in love deals with both Sexuality and Emotion)
Even Majel Barret said before she died that Gene Roddenberry would have loved this, just because it was action packed. He knew what people liked. (and they shared both of these things TOGETHER!)
I love this movie, it makes me feel good to be a star trek fan again.
Bring your Family and friends and let the the human exploration begin, the future is here and begins now with the greatest Star Trek Movie ever designed by man, with the exception of Star Trek: The Wrath of KHAN!!!! KHAN!!!! (another movie with lots of emotion)

3472664,4,B001AVCFJM,"REVIEW FOR THE BLU-RAY:

This isn't your father's ""Star Trek"". For good or bad, rebooting a franchise often means reinventing it and J.J. Abrams does a terrific job establishing this alternate ""Trek"" universe in ""Star Trek"". ""Trek"" rises from the ashes of the last ""Trek"" film ""Star Trek:Nemesis"" and became both a critical and box office success breaking the record for the most profitable ""Trek"" film. Be prepared for familair characters behaving...a bit differently in Abrams take on ""Trek"".

EXTRAS-we get some good ones in this set.

We get a commentary track featuring J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindel (producer), Orci & Kurtzman that focus on everything from discarded plot elements to happy accidents that made it into the filming.

The deleted scenes aren't all finished; for example two involving Nero's ship and another one involving Sarek returning home have unfinished CGI work. The bulk of the rest of the scenes are pretty well finished. We get an extended scene of Sarek and young Spock as well and finally find out how (at least this Kirk)reprogrammed the Kobyashi Maru simulation in the deleted scenes. In the finished film we're not told how he did it. A nice touch in the film is that Pine as Kirk eats an apple as he takes the test just as he did in when describing it in one scene of ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan"".

We also get featurettes on ""Aliens"", ""Costume Design"", ""Ships"" (including some discarded concepts for the Enterprise), a featurette on Gene Roddenberry's Vision and plenty of interviews with cast and crew discussing tackling the new ""Trek"".

The Blu-ray looks exceptionally good. Those lens flares that you see were intentional as Abrams is fond of using them to give the film a sense of ""reality"".

The plot if you're interested--Nero (Eric Bana) an anguished Romulan captain of a mining ship gets sucked into a black hole taking him into the past. After the destruction of Romulus from a natural disaster, Nero wants revenge against Ambassador Spock (Leonoard Nimoy) who he holds responsible. Cadet James T. Kirk (Chris Pine)plans on stopping him. In this ""alternate"" glimpseinto the Academy years we see how Spock (Zachary Quinto), Kirk(Chris Pine) and McCoy (Karl Urban)meet, the obstacles including a lack of trust between Spock and Kirk that they must face to defeat Nero before he destroys Earth.",1258675200,,2335,4.971794871794872
3472665,1,B001AVCFJM,"I've bought a handful of Blu-Ray movies in the past, even though I don't own a Blu-Ray player, because the package has always included a DVD disc along with a digital copy of the movie. This works out great because I can watch the movie on my DVD player, on my iPod Touch, and when I eventually upgrade to Blu-Ray, I can start using that disc. Naturally, I assumed a ""3-Disc"" edition would include just that: a Blu-Ray copy of the movie, a DVD copy, and a digital copy.

Nothing on the packaging indicates this is the case, so I cracked the plastic only to find I won't be able to watch this movie on my TV at all until I make some serious home theater upgrades.

I should have been more diligent in making sure the package included what I wanted, but the Amazon listing is ambiguous and the packaging itself doesn't indicate exactly what's inside. Caveat emptor, as always.

Note that the 1-star rating only indicates my dissatisfaction with the product listing -- I thought the movie was great and can't wait to watch it at home.",1258675200,9,1031,4.444444444444445
3472666,5,B001AVCFJM,"After watching this move in the theater it was a must have so I placed my pre order with Amazon. The day my item ship I noted a price drop of a dollar fifty and the week of the release I noticed that everywhere was selling the movie for 19.99. I didn't bother to as for a price adjustment since Amazon doesn't honor the price guarantee like they did in the past, but out of the blue I received and nice email stating a credit back to my account and the DVD was sold to me for 19.99. GO Amazon.
As for the movie if you're not a Trekie fan then give this move a try. I was raised watching Star Trek and I always thought it was alright but not super cool or awesome, but this move blew all the sci fi movies this year. It's the best Star Trek ever.  Rent or then buy it and if you have an iphone make sure you get the blu ray with digital copy it's an good movie to have on the iphone as well.

No, my review is simply of the replica Enterprise. It's beautiful. People are carping about the box and the certificate, etc, but trust me. If you had it in your hands, you'd love it and if you're a true Trekker, will kick yourself if you don't get it then see it later. It's a heavy, solid sculpture with a chrome base that's wonderful.

This Abrams, has he ever watched the old Star Treks? Gene Roddenberry's vision was destroyed in this movie. The old Star Trek was always loved for its characters and the stories, we didn't have or need all the special effects,it was cast and stories. The first eight or ten minutes of the movie was horrible. If Abrams would have done any homework at all, Jim Kirk at the Academy was a bookworm, a serious student, not a juvenile delinquent as this story unfolds. The story was weak, they actually cast it well, except for Kirk. In todays world, instead of using an original story, which was great, they keep butchering all these great old science fiction movies by changing everything, all they need to do is add the special effects. These are classics as they have stood the test of time, espically Star Trek. As for a three star rating, I could never give any thing from Star Trek a one, thus the three. It will be the worst of all the movies by far. I hope that if someone else does another one, they will do their homework, as this is one of the greatest adventures ever written.

3472670,4,B001AVCFJM,"I see so much written good and bad about JJ Abrams' newest rendition of ""Star Trek"".  Well, I grew up as a teenager watching the original series on TV - and it was good then - but not great either.  It became much more popular in the following years - and even I was a fan of it and the various spin off's that came around over the years.  It's now 43 years after the original series and JJ Abrams does a remake of the original - not the series, but certainly of the cast and crew,  Well, its now 2009 and all things need to be revitalized once in a while.  Abrams did a good job of that.

Abrams also does a good (not excellent) job at creating a contemporary movie resembling the original.  There was no need for him to stick to the ""rules of Star Trek"".  It was fictional, after all.  So he changed a lot of the characters and relationships.  Again this is entertainment, not history.  Did he make a successful re-make of Star Trek?  Of course.  It was fun to watch - and perhaps I know after all these years that none of this is real and none of this is a picture of the future.  It's just a movie - and it was a good one, though I can't see it winning an Academy Award.  I remember as a teenager watching Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and thinking ,""wow, this is what the future will bring!""  Well, I was wrong! The year 2001 has come and gone and that movie nowhere resembled the world in which we live.  So please - look at Star Trek and see it for what it is - entertainment.

Much is said about the ""encounter"" with Spock and Uhura.  Again, please accept this for what it is - and insignificant part of the story line.  In the original series, there was an episode where Kirk kissed Uhura.  But that was more a statement of the times than anything to do with a storyline.  The series was produced only 2 years after the Civil Rights Act of 1965 - and inter-racial relationships (even a kiss) were unheard of on prime time television.  So the producers of Star Trek threw that in for some excitement.  At the time, it was controversial - hardly now in our present time.  Perhaps Abrams simply isn't old enough to understand that it only meant something in 1967.  Fast-forwarding it to 2009 with a twist was a waste of time.  But no one is perfect.

Enough said.  Did I enjoy the movie?  Yes.  Would I watch it again?  No.  It was good, but not great.  Buy it, watch it, and see for yourself.  But please - remember it is just a movie.  It isn't supposed to be accurate, a statement of the times, or carry on some legacy that is instrumental in our society.  It's at best an enjoyable couple of hours.",1258588800,,2620,4.199195171026157
3472671,3,B001AVCFJM,"If based on the cast and how well the actors portrayed the characters I would give this 4.75 stars. The movie, if based on plot it would only recieve 1, maybe 1.5 stars. The plot was horrible, I was fine up until the scene when Kirk enters the bar and thats when things went down hill. The major plus about this movie was that Zachary Quinto played Spock so well that it carried the movie. The only major flaw with the cast was casting Zoe as Uhura, Michelle was and still is very beautiful, I thought that there were much better, less skinny actresses that could have played this part well. I found it hard to believe that JJ Abrams could find young, hotter actors to play the males but she was his choice. Not that she unattractive or a bad actress but she did not look the part. I also thought that for a movie that is over 2 hrs long, more time could have been spent on scotty, mccoy, and sulu. I hope part two has a better plot.",1258588800,5,933,4.1602209944751385
3472672,5,B001AVCFJM,"J.J. Abrams does a remarkable job of keeping the 1960's series flavor and booting it well into the 21st Century. The actors do an excellent job of keeping the characteristics and mannerisms of the original series while ramping up the attitude. The plot line is less civic minded than the original, but makes up for it in action. Never mind that Kirk hangs from a precipice by his fingers at least 3 times, he takes the original Kirk's willingness to go where angels fear to tread to a level that would have even the demons (in this case, Romulans) taking a step back. Spock finally has a depth behind his stoic face that doesn't make the viewer cringe when his emotions do get the better of him.

If you're a Trekkie, you'll love this film. If Steel Magnolias is your venue - stay away from this! If you are a right-wing, ""original series is the only Trek"" fan, you'll probably concede this was ""okay.""  If, however, you're a sci-fan, and action film fan, or a summer blockbuster fan you're going to love this film.

3472682,5,B001AVCFJM,"Being a Star Trek fan from the original series onward and sadly having seen the franchise literally ploughed into the ground with extremely weak TV and movie sequels,THIS is the moment I have wished for for a long time. This new Star Trek movie turns the franchise on its' collective ear,infuses it with pure adrenaline and gives us a foundation for the future;without compromising its' roots.
The story involves a rogue Romulan by the name of Nero. The head of a former mining vessel,he now has spent years trying to track down Mr. Spock. He blames Spock for destroying the Romulan home world. He has travelled years back and forth in time trying to track him down to meat out his revenge and destroy Vulcan. Eventually he does this by stranding him on a Vulcan moon to watch it. But it is here a young James T.Kirk meets an older Ambassador Spock who explains that the incident that occured to the Romulan homeworld was an unforeseen tragedy. He,in conjunction with the VSA(Vulcan Science Counsel),came up with ""red matter"",a substance which would in essence create a black hole and thus envelope the Romulan sun that was going supernova. But the unthinkable happened and Romulus was destroyed.
Kirk due to overwhelming circumstances thrust upon him,and seemingly destined to be in the right(or wrong) place at the right time,takes command of the Enterprise and decides to take on the rogue Romulan ship and in the end triumphs magnificently. It also sets in motion the strong bond/friendship that would endure between Kirk and Spock.
The movie is jarring for an old Trekker like me and appears to be more so to the umpteen devotee'and hard core Trekkers who have created blog after blog discussing the apparent ""holes"" and inconsistencies of this movie. The appearance of a young Chekov(17 yrs.old)is just one of MANY of their bugaboos. As I said this movie turns the franchise on its' ear and in this movie the Romulan threat has resulted in an alternate reality. So the appearance(like Chekov) and deaths of those that we otherwise know to have survived(Spocks' mother) are really not that unbelievable or inconsistent at all with the basic premise of this film. I am looking forward to how they plan to cross the ""I's"" and dot the ""T's"" in future installments. But above all that,the ""skinny"" is,this is Science Fiction and ANYTHING is possible,with an open mind.
Leonard Nimoy reprises his original role and who knows who may reappear in future movies...Shatner,Nichols,Takei,Koenig...? The possibilities are endless and wide open.
It is the endless possibilities this movie gives us along with the spectacular action and relentless pace,that make it a winner from beginning to end. It also,and VERY importantly,sticks as much as possible to the existing Star Trek cannon(within the context of its' own plotlines) and gives a myriad of nods to the established franchise,both spoken and unspoken.
The cast is defintely worth mentioning by name as they all are to be commended with helping to redefine established characters without compromising their essence;that which made them memorable and well known to all Star Trek fans:Chris Pine is the new Kirk,Zachary Quinto is Spock,Karl Urban is Dr. McCoy,Zoe Saldana is Uhura,Simon Pegg does the beloved Scotty,John Cho is Sulu and Anton Yelchin is Chekov. Also Bruce Greenwood gives us Capt. Pike,Ben Cross is Spocks' father and Winona Ryder is Spocks'mother. Some interesting choices,no doubt,but as I said all stay true to the characters established dynamic while inserting their own unique personalities into them.
Overall J.J.Abrams has accomplished,in what a relatively short time ago,some thought impossible. I believe he has helped to reinvigorate a franchise that was essentially going nowhere fast;one that has put billions of dollars into the coffers of Paramount and been one of the most successful franchises in entertainment history. And while there will be many detractors,I say good on them and well done for having the vision and guts to see this project to fruition.
Technically the DVD transfer is flawless. It is in widescreen and picture in perfect. Special features in this single disc edition include an outtake reel,commentary and a featurette on the ""new vision"" this movie takes.
The movie has so far grossed about three times its' cost worldwide and the DVD sales are bound to up that figure considerably. It was a blockbuster release for the summer of 2009 and it is just in time for the 2009 Christmas season(when the first Star Trek movies were usually released!)for a gift for that Trekker in your home. It is not the Star Trek of old per se' but it retains the basic canon,values and essence of those characters that all Star Trek fans have come to know and love;with a pacing kicked up several notches packing a nitro-like wallop. You don't have to be a Star Trek fan to like this movie,which is exactly what Abrams and company also had in their smart little minds(attracting NEW converts!),but it sure helps!",1258588800,,4995,5.019277108433735

3472684,5,B001AVCFJM,"How do you revive a classic Sci Fi TV series with a devoted, loyal cult following that will crush you if you screw it up? Clearly you hire JJ Abrams to produce and direct.

I consider myself somewhat of a Trekie. I've seen every episode of the original TV series...at least 3 times. I've seen each of the major motion pictures...at least twice. I've seen all of the spin off TV series and their respective motion picture spinoffs at minimum once. So, yeah, I'd say I'm a fan. And there are fans that DO NOT want their stuff messed with no matter what. After seeing Abrams' Star Trek, I can't believe that any loyal fan...even the preservationists...could be unhappy. But there are those that will just be impossible to please, evidenced by the fair amount of strong criticism in the review section of this page alone.

I, on the other hand, am firmly in the camp of this-was-a-great-movie! Abrams and his cast pay homage to everything that made the original TV series a classic. The movie takes you back through time to some short segments about Kirk's and Spock's childhood, then quickly moves to and progresses from when the two board the Enterprise for their first times. And they are of course joined by the other primary characters from the original TV series.

All of the characters attempt to channel a bit of the persona and dispositions of the original actors, and they do a terrific job combining the natures of the original characters with some modern day personality polish.

Abrams version of Star Trek might rewrite some of what was solidly in place with years of Star Trek history, and that might indeed be what has a Tribble in the bonnet of some of the preservationists. But Abrams' version has mostly succeeded in revitalizing a series that was inevitable to be remade by someone. So to the preservationists I say, be very very happy that you got such a great movie that is such a tribute to Gene Roddenberry's vision.

Star Trek 2009 has a lot action, a great cast, a fine story...I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish.

My only problem with this movie is that it was too short. That's right...I said too SHORT. I'm usually complaining about how unnecessarily long Hollywood makes its movies these days. But if you watch the deleted scenes that are included on Disk 2 of the Blu Ray package, you actually learn stuff that would have enhanced the theatrical version of the movie had it not been cut out.

One thing that won't be short is the life of the new franchise that Abrams has created. These are the MAIDEN voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Where no man has gone before. Jump on board this initial voyage of what I'm guessing will be many before Abrams is done.",1258588800,3,2700,4.635983263598327
3472685,3,B001AVCFJM,"If you're looking for a movie review, I'll do a quick one below. The main focus here though is on the whole limited edition replica. I just got mine and I've got to say I'm a bit disappointed. It's a beautiful model, don't get me wrong. Really detailed and a lot better than some of the pewter models I'd seen circulating years ago.

The problem is the presentation. Outside of a little card, there is nothing to indicate just how ""limited"" it is. There isn't a number on the model or on the card like you'd expect. The packaging is ridiculously ho-hum. You look at that photo above and see the nice box? It's a nice cardboard box stuffed to the gills with styrofoam to protect the model--a good thing--but it's nothing special. I've seen plenty of game and movie sets that do something fancier with plastic, non-limited edition models and other junk. Yet here they just stuff the thing inside of some styrofoam, throw an index card (mass produced) and the Blu-Ray box on the top.

For an $80 (or more if it wasn't discounted) premium, I expected more...a lot more. Still I can't deny the model looks good. And about that movie...

The movie itself is a great ride. I admit I was worried (and still am in a way) about how JJ Abrams would do this movie. He's good at spinning tales (google ""JJ abrams mystery box"") and he definitely puts a good one together here. The cast is actually great. They manage to give all the characters a mix of the old (what you expect of their characters) and the new (some new quirks and the like). I still have the original crew burned into my head from years of reruns and general love for the series so it's a bit hard to ""let go"" of the history...something Mr. Abrams asks you to do.

I'm torn about how he decided to use a pretty standard Star Trek universe mechanism to give himself the freedom to change the way the original crew got started. On the one hand, it's a brilliant idea that doesn't stray far from the ""reality"" of Star Trek. On the other, it's a cop out from a potentially difficult or restrictive history he'd have to limit himself to.

In the end, you'll have a fun ride and unless you're so retentive that you can't stand the idea of seeing the existing Star Trek universe messed with in any way.

For those of you who have no idea what Star Trek is, beyond something that the geeks in your lives go nuts over, don't worry. Just think: it's sometime in our future. That's all you need to know. Everything else gets explained at some point in the movie and you really don't have to worry about the ""grandfather paradox"" that the movie creates but never discusses.

As a devout fan of Star Trek as far as I'm concerned the 23rd Century (Kirk's time period) ended 15 years ago in Star Trek - Generations (1994). That's where Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) meets Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). The only reason Paramount Pictures brought somebody else in to make a story for Star Trek is because the last 2 treks Insurrection (1998) and Nemesis (2002) with the cast of The Next Generation tried to conceive a villian to out perform the late Ricardo Montalban's performance from The Wrath of Khan (1982). THEY FAILED MISERABLY. However they came close with The Borg in First Contact (1996). And I think Nemesis was pretty good. But I will NEVER see the new Star Trek movies after Nemesis.

I would have been really upset if I had actually paid to see this film in the theater. The film tries to be a cliche upon itself by having just about everything reflect sparkles and lights like a mirror.  The feel of this film is more ""Star Wars"" than Star Trek.  It clearly lifts much from Star Wars, from action scenes to the chaotic violent pace of the wanna-be story.

Okay fine.  It's okay for a film to look different or to be ""just like Star Wars"" (without a story).  However I would like Paramount to actually invest a bit of money in storylines.  This film has virtually no story.  This is a film born out of th editing room.  Not planned and with no particular story in mind.  It is a weak variant on the Boy travels through time... another boy meets his friend's dad... then boy fixes problem.  The Romulans are played as balding big-eared freaks.  Vulcans are sensitive, friendly aliens.  The theme of Kirk always winning and never suffering a serious defeat is upheld from the original series.

3472694,5,B001AVCFJM,"I've been a ""Trek"" fan since it's very first episode on NBC, over forty years ago, and I admit, I anticipated J.J. Abrams' reboot of the franchise with some trepidation. However, after viewing ""Star Trek (Two-Disc Digital Copy Edition)"", I admit that, other than a couple of quibbles, I enjoyed it immensely! I can appreciate the disappointment of some 'purists', as Abrams has made changes (some major) to the mythos, but for those who believe this destroys the past Trek canon, I remind you that the new film is set in an alternate reality, created by Nero's emergence from the manufactured black hole. The original Trek universe still exists, with Shatner and the 'classic' stories still intact. Nothing is lost; instead, a new realm is opened, offering a new generation of viewers (and we old-timers) the opportunity to be surprised and captivated all over again. Without a major overhaul, I'm afraid ""Star Trek"" would never have seen the light of day, again. Thank you, J.J. Abrams, for saving it!

It was wonderful seeing Leonard Nimoy reprising 'Spock' one more time. As ancient as he has become, there is still magic when he is onscreen, and his scenes with young Kirk (Chris Pine), and Spock (Zachary Quinto), are wise, funny, and quite touching (when he says to Kirk, as an introduction, ""I am, and always will be, your friend"", I got the sniffles!). While I was afraid I wouldn't accept Pine in the Shatner role (he really looks nothing like him), he won me over, with the classic Kirk swagger, cockiness, and dead-on instincts. I could easily envision Shatner during the Kobayashi Maru exercise, as Pine smirked and chomped on an apple, while breaking the 'no-win' scenario. Quinto, despite a stronger resemblance to Nimoy, was actually a harder 'sell', as he has a relationship in the film that Nimoy's Spock would never have allowed himself, and displays more 'human' traits. His chemistry with Pine is so good, however, that I'm willing to let these quibbles ride, and see how things will develop in future. The rest of the Enterprise crew is excellent, with Zoe Saldana giving Uhura a strength that I wish Nichelle Nichols had been allowed to display back in the '60s. I especially enjoyed Karl Urban's grouchy 'take' on DeForest Kelley's 'Bones' McCoy (Dee would have loved it!), and Simon Pegg's dead-on portrayal of Scotty (could anyone else have been half as good?)

Yes, some of the original Trek's ruminations about society's ills have been replaced by non-stop action, but I remember the pilot of the original Trek series, ""The Cage"", which NBC rejected as being too cerebral for viewers; they demanded a second pilot, with plenty of physical action...and the second pilot 'sold' the series. History, it appears, bears Abrams' decision out!

Here is my other quibble...Kirk is commissioned from Academy Midshipman straight to Starship Captain? Starfleet would never jump anyone that fast, without some 'seasoning' in the lower ranks, and without service on smaller ships, before turning over the pride of the fleet to him...even if he DID save the Federation! Yeah, I understand why (you can't make a 'classic' Trek movie without Kirk commanding the Enterprise), but it feels wrong to me, nonetheless. Minor quibble, though!

All in all, this is a fabulous adventure...it's great to have ""Star Trek"" back!",1258502400,2,3328,5.001805054151625
3472695,3,B001AVCFJM,"I just finished watching this movie. For a long time I have been an avid Star Trek fan and have seen all the major motion pictures. This movie is an attempt to remake the franchise for more modern action-oriented audiences. Consequently, there isn't much of a plot here. The whole notion of a rogue Romulon from the future seems entirely wasted. The script is either poorly written or poorly acted.

What could have been a great movie turns out to be a mediocre one at best. Further, the actor who plays Spock (the same one who plays Sylar on Heroes) does not do a credible job. Part of this isn't the actor's fault--I just kept anticipating him to throw people across the bridge with just a gesture of his hand--but neither was he convincing in the role. The actor who played Kirk did an excellent job. Ohura was miscast.

When the closing credits came, I felt that all we saw was dazzling special effects without any real or lasting substance. Poor job, J.J.",1258502400,12,960,4.543352601156069
3472696,1,B001AVCFJM,"This is not a journey through space and time, 'where no man has gone before'...This is a frenetic, jarring ride on a lumbering bovine-drawn cart (thus the word 'trek') through territory which has previously so exhausted our visual purple that we see only negative after-images. To label the project derivative would be excessively flattering.
Just a few glaring flaws...
The Romulan ship looks like some grade-school Lego project submitted by a cephalopod on crack. The science is on a lower grade /phylogenetic level. The sets look like something out of the Industrial Revolution...not a hint of Star Wars , Alien/Aliens or Raiders here. In this economy, can't the location scouts find another abandoned warehouse?
The players are all caricatures of caricatures. In some installments you ignored the 'acting' as the story was intriguing or unique enough to blind you to it. Not here.
Was Winona incarcerated at GITMO, or what? She can act, but is not allowed the opportunity under the burqa.
And poor Leonard (who never could act)...looks like he was driven out of some third-world ICU with a cattle-prod.

The action-action-action films of late all look and feel and smell the same. Smell?  The odor of decaying gray matter. I thought this was the bailiwick of public education.

There is simply nothing of substance here...it passes through your system for two hours without impacting anything: 'The Neutrino Effect'. Purely juvenile in its conception and presentation.",1258502400,27,1472,5.2025316455696204
3472697,1,B001AVCFJM,"I have been a fan of STAR TREK since I was a small child watching it on TV and, by itself, this movie is good.  However, if you are a DIE HARD fan like me, YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE WATCHING THIS.  What it did that really upset me was the fact that Leonard Nimoy/Spock comes back through time after a Romulan has done the same and already changed the past.  I thought all the way up to the end credits that they would fix this and put things right.  THEY DID NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Basically, it takes place between Star Trek: Enterprise and The Original Series.  Now, with the changes they made, EVERYTHING FROM THE OLD SERIES THROUGH THE NEXT GEN, DS9, VOYAGER, AS WELL AS THE FIRST 10 FILMS NEVER TAKES PLACE!!

I fear that I will never be able to watch any Trek again without this movie TAINTING Trek for me for the rest of my life.

IF YOU LOVE TREK AS MUCH AS I DO AND, LIKE ME, HAVE SEEN LITERALLY EVERY ONE EVER MADE, YOU REALLY SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE.  I hope and pray that they will have the sense to repair the damage they've done because I would label this one as a FRANCHISE KILLER.  If, as I suspect, they do not repair the damage done by film 11, I state now that STAR TREK IS officially and formally DEAD and BURIED now and forever.

First, I'm not a Star Wars fan or a Trekkie.  I've only seen Star Wars once or twice with my son, but still couldn't get over the similarities between these two movies.

The entire film had so many Star Wars things that it was ridiculous. Bits and pieces were borrowed from Star Wars and used in the Star Trek flick.
The Enterprise doesn't go into warp drive, like the M. Falcon.  Hmmm...
We're seeing a drill that looks remarkably similar to the floating thing in Star Wars that Skywalker landed on.
Swords that fling out the way a light saber would.
The scene with Luke Skywalker fighting Vadar was redone as young Captain Kirk fighting Nero...Seriously the scenery was so similar they might have been using the same props.
Then there is young Spock flying back towards Kirk, kind of like Han Solo coming back.
The destroying of the Death Star, I mean Nero's mining ship.
Ummm, what else?  The space lasers, I mean phasers.  The original Enterprise didn't even have all that cool technology.
Why did they even bother?  It made a mockery of Star Wars and Star Trek.

I'm not even going into the annoying time paradox issues.

And of course the sexist fact that the only female main character is suppose to be a ""star pupil"" but really she's just sleeping with the professor and that's how she got on the Enterprise.",1258502400,32,1381,4.536290322580645

I pre-ordered this set the day it went online since it looked to be by far the best Set of all the available special editions. But after getting it I feel pretty down about the money I spent on it.

My first issue is the box, for starters, in the pictures it looks like a nice display quality box, maybe plastic or possibly Tin. But in reality it is corrugated cardboard, the Enterprise toy from playmates has a nicer quality box. I know that it is corrugated cardboard as the ribbing shows through on the surface and has rubbing wear making the peaks of the corrugation look more worn than the valleys. Basically the copy I got looks nothing like the solid black box in the image.

My second issue was the Bluray itself, Which is just the standard bluray available on amazon for $19. no matching cover to the box nothing special.

The Replica is cool, feels really solid and has an overall good weight and feel. the detail and scale is pretty nice as well. Is it worth the additional $70? To that I can honestly give a flat out NO.

In the end I really wish I had not opened the box to begin with and returned it as soon as I saw the quality of the packaging. If your on the fence about this I would say save your money, there are a lot of other versions out there, all of them for $60 less.",1258502400,8,1444,4.128113879003559
3472702,1,B001AVCFJM,"I have this image of J.J. Abrams waiting like a vulture for Gene Roddenberry to die so he can swoop down on the Star Trek franchise and remake it in his image. It's been a long time since a movie's ending depressed me as much as this one did. The beloved Star Trek Universe is no more. All that's left is a cast of caricatures with the same names. This is not Star Trek by any stretch. This travesty is compounded by the unfortunate trotting out of Leonard Nimoy to somehow lend a whiff of legitimacy to this ""reboot"".

""This isn't your father's Star Trek,"" the hype proclaimed. It sure isn't. What it is is a younger generation's plundering of the dreams of those who've gone before, twisted and claimed as their own. Pity Abrams didn't possess the creative spark to envision his own universe instead of corrupting the work of a dead man.

3472703,5,B001AVCFJM,"There are a number of ways to praise this film.  For instance, while I missed it in the theater I had heard nothing but great things about it and was awaiting the film on Blu-ray with great expectations.  Far too often when you look forward to a movie with this kind of enthusiasm you end up getting disappointed.  And I have to say that I was very disappointed with the beginning of the film.  The whole-birth-of-Kirk-at-the-height-of-a-great-battle thing left me laughing and unhappy.  It was, however, the only part of the movie that I disliked.  So it is high praise to say that I loved this movie despite expecting to love it.

Here is another way to praise it.  Almost all movies that are remakes try to work in former stars in cameos of one sort or another.  While it is usually nice to see them, their appearances are almost always throwaways.  The use of Leonard Nimoy in this film is hand's down the best I've ever seen of an original cast member in a remake.  Without going into details -- I intend this to be a spoiler free review -- Nimoy's role is not a cameo.  He in fact has a pretty important role.  It was simply wonderful that it wasn't a tacked on appearance or one that was irrelevant to the main course of the film.

Another way to praise it is that I actually preferred it to the original.  That may be heresy, but while I always liked the original series, I was never passionately in love with it.  Like Orson Scott Card (with whom I almost always agree with in assessing SF TV and movies even while disagreeing passionately with him on politics), I never felt that the original series was actually very good SF.  I honestly believe that I prefer everyone of the new ST characters to their original counterparts, with the exception of Spock.  Mind you, I don't prefer the new versions hugely, with one exception, but I still thoroughly enjoyed all of them.  The one huge exception is Chris Pine as Kirk.  For me the original series was seriously crippled by William Shatner and if asked to compile a list of the worst actors that I've ever seen on TV, he would top the list.  I'd have to think about who would be #2.  Chris Pine was, for me, everything that Shatner was not.  He was simultaneously brash and funny, heroic and self-effacing.  And his acting decisions were never, well, weird.  If you watch the original series and put yourself in Shatner's shoes, some of -- well, make that huge numbers of -- his decisions are utterly perverse.  No once watching Pine, however, did I wonder about his decisions.  He brought charisma to a role that for me Shatner brought only strangeness.

Clearly J. J. Abrams has to receive major kudos for the success of the film.  Working with a script by his fellow FRINGE executive producers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, he produced a movie that put to shame most other films based on prior TV series.  He managed to reintroduce all of the familiar characters, but in ways that not only did not slow down the story but actually advanced the narrative.  I've had enormous respect for J. J. Abrams over the years.  I have a theory that he describes a crucial line between intelligence and popular appeal on TV.  Below the line and you get increasingly less intelligent TV producers.  Above the line and you get smart but niche television.  Not that many people are above the line, but the ones who do produce absolutely brilliant TV series that have serious trouble attracting viewers.  Joss Whedon, Ronald D. Moore, Bryan Fuller, and Matthew Weiner are among this smaller group of producers.  Their work is passionately loved by TV critics, college students and professors, other TV writers and producers, and academic writers, but their shows are not watched by large numbers of viewers.  Still, it isn't like Abrams makes TV for dummies, and I've loved many aspects of his TV series.  After Joss Whedon, Abrams may have done more for heroic females on TV than anyone else.  And while at his best he may not cause your jaw to drop down to your ankles like Whedon or Ronald Moore can, he still can be surprising and exciting.  STAR TREK is very close to Abrams best work and I very much hope that we will see a follow up to this first film sooner rather than later.

One of the things that I do enjoy about a J. J. Abrams production is that he love to bring back people he has worked with before.  Not just Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, but Rachel Nichols, who was superb in the final season of ALIAS (and who had a great love scene with Kirk in this one) and Amanda Foreman, who was in both FELICITY and ALIAS.  And of course, Greg Grunberg manages to find his way into all of Abrams's productions sooner or later (though not yet in FRINGE, as far as I know).  Here he only manages to provide the voice of Kirk's step-father, but it is the kind of cameo that works well.",1258502400,7,4838,4.504018369690011

3472706,3,B001AVCFJM,"(HERE BE SPOILERS MATEY)

Pros - Great scenes, great cast, great action, just funny enough, and overall a fun movie to watch.

Cons - Why oh why did they have to do a g.d. time travel movie huh?? It will inevitably fail every common sense test.  It seemed to reek of a poor excuse to get Leonard Nimoy into the movie.  The antagonist's motivation is that his family/home/planet are destroyed and he blames Spock.  So after getting crapped back in time he goes tear assing around the universe looking for Spock so he can serve a slice of revenge pie.  Revenge plot, okay i get that, but it all stemmed from the fact that spock was just a few seconds too late to save the planet.  So now, having a few extra decades to warn and prepare, why not just tell Spock to skip the second cup of coffee, leave 5 minutes earlier and be done with it. Planet saved, hooray.

My two cents; rather than sweep all the ""trek"" history right into the garbage on a flimsy and lame time travel plot, just to get Nimoy in it, why not have Nimoy narrate the story from the beginning?  I always thought a great-grandson asking how great-grandpa met ""Uncle Jim"" would have been cool.  Just saying...

Time travel has a ditinct ""done that"" feel, especially in Star Trek.  It all just seemed like the story was rushed through and all the attention went to the visuals.

Bottom line:  I'm buying the Blu-Ray cause it looks and sounds awesome, but the plot will always grate me a bit.",1258502400,6,1454,4.397003745318352

The little Enterprise is very nice looking, substantial and heavy for it's size (no cheap piece of plastic on this baby), and worthy to put in a display case, BUT: 1) On closer inspection, craftsmenship is not perfect, though not flimsy, there is a small gap between where the saucer attaches to the ""neck"" (sorry, don't know what else to call that part) of the ship, in other words it is not completely seamless; 2) The certificate is NOT indiviudally signed, just copied/printed signatures; and 3) It is NOT numbered (either on the sculpture itself or on the certificate).

Of course, there were changes. The fact that they reworked the history of Vulcan will surely upset some people, but to me, it was nothing that can't be fixed in a sequel. The other twist was the love story between two of the most unlikely characters, if the original series is to be taken into account. However, I think they did it well.

This was truly an enjoyable remake and the cast, plot, and action were dead on.

My personal favorite, Scotty, was performed with great skill by my favorite Shaun of the Dead, Simon Pegg. Plus, second time around, it finally dawned on me who Kirk's mother was played by, none other than Jennifer Morrison, formerly of House.

I admit it was hard to see with the flares though.  The actors did a fair job but the plot was unsophisticated and clumsy.

3472720,4,B001AVCFJM,"The Blu-Ray:

""Star Trek (2009)"" is presented in a 1080p 2.40:1 aspect ratio Blu-Ray. Video quality is terrific. A very light film grain is present which is quite accurate compared to the theatrical presentation. Black levels are inky and deep, colors are vivid but still accurate. Close-ups demonstrate a lot of detail, especially facial close-ups. Space scenes are also swimming with detail, since most every space ship in this film is in various numbers of pieces or states of damage. Noticeable edge-enhancement and digital noise reduction are non-existent.

Simply put, this is five star material all the way. Anyone who enjoys action/sci-fi eye candy for their HD setup would do well to purchase this disc. It is demo-worthy material. This may be the single best Blu-Ray I have seen - it at least ties in visual quality with the excellent Braveheart and Frost/Nixon discs.

Sound is presented in a well-balanced Dolby TrueHD mix, which is notable for not only its punch and vibrancy, but also the fact that it never drowns out dialogue. This is something that many action movies fail to accomplish, and it is most appreciated, at least by this viewer. I HATE it when I have to constantly adjust the volume on the fly in order to hear whispers of dialogue, only to have my speakers threaten to blow out when some sudden burst of noisy action occurs. ""Star Trek (2009)"" is wonderfully well-done in this respect. Surround channels get a lot of work, bass is booming at appropriate moments, so just like the video, audio is stellar. Also included are commentaries with Director and writers (no, they do not apologize for various inconsistencies and mistakes) and some foreign language tracks. The subtitles are a little odd - sometimes they fail to transcribe dialogue. 95% of the stuff is there, but there are clearly things missing - Kirk says ""wow"" upon seeing the Enterprise, and it is nowhere to be found in the subtitle track. Not a deal-breaker, just weird.

Extras are copious and presented in HD, which is great. However, this disc suffers from a recent trend in home video extras - they are split into 30 separate chunks, presumably to look better on box copy. So you are forced to navigate a menu with 30 choices, with no markers for what you've already seen, in order to see all of the features. This is too bad, because the features are really, really good. If they had been spliced into one 2-hour making of feature, one set of deleted scenes, and one gag reel, this would be just about the perfect set of extras. Instead, you are made to do ""work"" instead of just enjoying the ""fun."" The deleted scenes, by the way, are also in HD, and most would have made the movie better. They should have just finished the effects and incorporated them into the film proper.

The Movie:

In the special features, the producers and director make it very clear that their guiding question when making the film was ""Can we make it cool?"" Well, they've succeeded at making it ""cool."" Unfortunately in making this their emphasis, they have also made some severe missteps that make it difficult to swallow as a serious Trek fan.

So I'll review this movie wearing two hats. First, for ""the rest of you:""

""Star Trek (2009)"" offers a bold re-imagining of a venerable television science fiction franchise. To a certain extent, it sheds much of the baggage accumulated over 40 years of television and films, giving non-Trekkies an easy entree into the universe.

We are given the tale of Kirk, Spock and McCoy taking the reins of the Starship Enterprise, in a galaxy populated by both humans and other races. James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is a brash young man who is set adrift by the attack of a Romulan villain upon the ship carrying his parents. Without the influence of his father, a Starfleet officer, Kirk has an aimless childhood, squandering his intellect and his drive on bar brawls and car thefts. Luckily, he is intercepted by the wise, gruff Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and challenged to make a better life for himself and to live up to his ability by joining Starfleet.

There, he meets fellow cadets Uhura (Zoe Saldana), McCoy (Karl Urban), Chekov (Anton Yelchin), Sulu (John Cho), and an irritating instructor, the cool, logical Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto). Their contrasting styles immediately put them at odds with each other. Spock has grown up the child of two worlds, with a human mother, and a father from Vulcan, a planet whose culture has embraced logic and the shedding of emotion, except perhaps the emotion of racism against humans.

Before their education is complete, they are presented with the threat of the same villain who had killed Kirk's dad 25 years prior - Nero (Eric Bana). Turns out Nero is from the future, and is bent on revenge for the destruction of his home world, Romulus. In a plot development somewhat like ""Space Camp,"" for some unstated reason, every other ship is somewhere else, and there are no trained crew members available for the newly-built Enterprise. So the cadets are drafted into service right then and there.

Various plot twists and turns see Kirk marooned on an ice planet, where he meets not only Scotty (a very funny Simon Pegg) but also a much older Spock (Leonard Nimoy). This old Spock explains that the visitor from the future has changed history, and that Kirk must team up with the younger Spock, melding their disparate styles and talents into a team that can defeat the threat.

Overall, the plot moves very quickly, and might be a bit confusing to those not versed in Trek lore. But the speed, noise, and bombast are such that pausing to consider holes in story logic (and there are quite a few) is not really feasible until after the movie has finished. The effects, music, and performances are all flashy and dazzling, and it is hard not to feel aggressively entertained by the whole spectacle. Especially charming are Pine as Kirk and Quinto as Spock. Their chemistry works well. There were really no casting problems for the heroes. The villain, Nero, is somewhat less successful, as his motivations are rather obscure, especially to an audience not familiar with Romulans, time travel, and the like.

It is all done with ample brio and verve - enough panache to surmount its sometimes lazy storytelling and slipshod logic. On a scale of ten, I'd give it a solid 7, perhaps even an 8. It is much more entertaining than the average Hollywood popcorn movie, mainly on the strength of the characters and the performances.

Now, for the Trekkies:

""Star Trek (2009)"" is the product of Hollywood corporate committees, shedding ""baggage"" in such a way that it dilutes some of the core concepts and appeal of the show which gave rise to the Trekkie faithful in the first place.

The characters from the original series are brought together in a way which feels quite far from organic, presumably because Hollywood executives were worried that a slower tale that realistically developed their relationships would fail to satisfy audiences unused to thinking and realism. Instead of being members of a logically coherent military organization, each with careers and internal lives of their own, all of our principal characters are roughly the same age and have the same amount of experience, despite the fact that by the end of the film, they all have different ranks and specialties. Especially galling at the end is the instantaneous promotion of Kirk from 25-year-old Starfleet cadet (not even a graduate, as he is in his third year of studies) directly to Captain of the fleet's newest and most advanced flagship. It would be akin to a fresh West Point graduate being given command of the invasion of Afghanistan, or an Annapolis cadet being given command of an aircraft carrier. Why would anyone who had invested a lifetime in this organization respect any order that escapes his lips? Equally puzzling are the promotions of all the other crew members at the end as well - why is Kirk a Captain, but McCoy a Commander, Uhura a Lieutenant, Chekov an Ensign? They all have the same amount of experience and ""seasoning"" (i.e. none).

This is the sort of world-breaking contrivance that litters the film (want some more examples? ""Transwarp Beaming"" immediately springs to mind...). Which is too bad, because ""Star Trek (2009)"" ably captures the feel of the previous shows, mixing humor, fisticuffs, and dazzling gadgetry in nearly the perfect proportions. It fails, however, to add the integral piece - a logically consistent world, one that creates and follows its own rules, one that is similar enough to our own to be comprehensible, but different and better enough that it inspires admiration and wonder, and makes you yearn to live in it. It is a bit of a tragedy, since just a few tweaks and edits could have turned a story full of world-breaking holes and missteps into pretty much the best Trek movie ever.

The quality of special effects is above that of the other films and series, and will definitely impress Trek veterans who are used to less. Many in-jokes and subtler references abound, and will no doubt elicit smiles and chuckles from those who are ""in the know.""

But that certain something is missing. That special thing which makes something ""Trek,"" and not just ""Generic Space Opera #12."" There isn't much ""Real"" science fiction, for one thing - black holes and space ships could have been substituted with quicksand and stage coaches - they are not concepts that drive the plot or the characters or the world, instead they are generic perils, and devices to surmount those dangers. But heck, that could be said of some of the other films, those films that, despite their failings, we would still call ""real"" Trek. What is missing is the logical consistency of the world. Continuity. ""Baggage."" In stripping ""Star Trek (2009)"" down to something that will appeal to a ""mass"" audience, the producers of this film have denatured it into something reminiscent, but not recognizable.

In summary:

This is an entertaining film, no doubt about it. If you are not a Trekkie, you will probably love it. You should buy it. It's a terrific disc to give your home theater a workout.

If you are a Trekkie, you may have mixed feelings. I do. But you should still probably buy it. Consider it a riff on Star Trek. The greatest, biggest budget fan film ever made. It doesn't all work, the writing isn't all good, and a certain something is missing. But it's an entertaining ride that will probably make you yearn for the ""real thing"" all the more.",1258416000,916,10531,4.8125
3472721,5,B001AVCFJM,"JJ Abrams is becoming his generation's Steven Spielberg and this Star Trek movie is as great as anything he has done so far. This big budget treatment did an outstanding job of casting young actors that accurately represent the stars of the original Star Trek of the 1960s. Its a tough, gritty movie that has a couple of laughs and the picture and sound are state of the art.

Anyway, excellent movie that has a time paradigm shift that basically set everything seen previously on all the Star Trek series/movies as happening in an alternate reality. This sets the stage for more Star Trek movies and possibly even new TV series. This is a great movie and hopefully Abrams will make several more. Bring on Q and The Borg! Gene Roddenberry would be proud.",1258416000,4,1195,5.43010752688172
3472722,5,B001AVCFJM,"There is a lot of people that didn't like the new movie - they practically had a stroke over what Abrams did.  They complained about how everything was different and contradicted everything in Trek over the last 40+ years.  1) They obviously did pay attention to the movie (all these changes were explained...logically I might add) 2) They just don't want to accept the fact that the Star Trek timeline finally came crashing down.  Whenever time travel is featured in an episode of Trek - much effort is put into the characters preserving the timeline.  Not in this movie - it shows us how with one change - everything changes...and BOOM a totally alternate time line is born erasing EVERYTHING we know.

I thought it was very clever how it was executed; it opens the door for an entirely new world of Star Trek.  One of the problems I've had with the franchise - is that in some episodes of previous series' some things were contradicted which was something we had known to be 'cannon' in prior episodes/series'.  The way this movie was done...the future of the franchise now has a clean slate to work with and will never have to worry about 'keeping true to cannon'.

I loved the movie and I admit - I saw it 5 times in the theatre.  I didn't think I was going to like it because it was a 'rewrite' of everything I had seen of the 'original cast'.  When I saw the first preview - I was very eager to see it.  While the movie does LITERALLY REWRITE everything that the last 40+ years of Star Trek has been - it did it with classic Trek style.

My only qualm with the DVD is that art work on the cardboard sleeve and the DVD case its self.  I knew the sleeve was going to be as pictured - but I was hoping the case would have been more like one of the movie posters; on the front is a tight face shot of Chris Pine and on the back is a tight face shot of Zachary Quinto.  Not very exciting or artistic.  The bonus features are great; (many of the deleted scenes I feel should have been kept in the movie).",1258416000,3,2005,4.253298153034301

3472725,1,B001AVCFJM,"If you want to tell a story that everyone knows, then you use good plot, script, cast and director, and you tell the story better. Instead Paramount relied solely on Star Trek's reputation and spent the production money on high contrast, puke-computer generated color. Character development relied on mimicking quotes from the original TV series to the point of bad clichs from where no man has gone before. The story line is a patchwork of parts and plots taken from almost every TV show and motion picture. It's a shame because a real writer could've had fun developing these characters through the trials and tribulations of Starfleet academy, and how they earned their way to the Starship Enterprise!

It gets worse as the movie progresses. Nobody twisted Paramount's arm to go back to Kirk and Spock. These are big shoes to fill, so when the characters start to stumble, the real actor takes over. Did I mention puke earlier? That's what the computer generated special effects (CGSE) make me do. Since when are the props the show? Since Paramount skipped hiring writers and a director and kept the money for themselves. For instance, the bad guy in the movie is a Romulan named Nero who looks more like a pointy eared refugee from a US Prison's tattoo parlor. Anyway he's mad at Spock and Starfleet for some SciFi slight and he's come back from the future to make them pay. Well that's a new concept for Star Trek, time travel. When ever this plot starts to go anywhere the scenes switch to CGSE, a cartoon rollercoaster ride. It's as if this movie were created for an audience of people who suffer from Attention Deficit Disorder, not us Trekies! If this is just a taste of what's in store for us in the future from Paramount, save your money and read a book.",1258416000,29,1765,4.657051282051282
3472726,5,B001AVCFJM,"This movie IS Star Trek.

The faces and the sets may be new, golly- gee, and all whiz-bang, but the essence remains pure Star Trek.

JJ Abrams has breathed new life into an old friend. Yes, there are many new things here, but there is plenty of refrences to all that has come before, especially a scene early on in Spock's life that paod homage to the somewhat unjustly decannonized Animated Series.

Kirk's somewhat hinted at rough and tumble attitude in the original tv show is explored much more deeply and extremely here, wich may upset some of us older fans, but I absolutely loved the bar scene with Uhura and the cadet rat pack.

I usually don't like the idea of someone tampering with an Icon, especially one that I love as much as Star Trek.

But I concede that I must make an exception here.

JJ got it right.

Let's hope he can keep it up.

OPDATE:

As statewd above, despite the whiz bang factor, I really like the new Trek universe that Abrams has given us to play in. It is far grittier and much more violent than the old one, wich I will always love, but the possibilities in Abrams ST universe will indeed take us where no one has gone before, If Paramount allows it to grow and flourish.

Will the Klingons change yet again?

Will the Borg show up, and if they do, will they be even nastier than they were in TNG?

Will the Vulcan race survive?

Not to mention the Federation itself?

Well, if nothing else, it's gonna be one Hell of a ride.",1258416000,2,1458,4.3125

3472728,5,B001AVCFJM,"I think it is funny that several of the negative reviews begin by saying ""I'm a long time Star Trek fan...""  Well, so am I!  One of the things that made Star Trek great back in the ""old days"" was the way it was always cutting edge, and looking for a new approach while living within the set ""laws of the land"" of the series.  You know, I don't really need more of the ""old"" Star Trek, because I already have plenty.  Those are classics and shall remain so.  I'm ready for something new, and this movie is it! It makes Star Trek cutting edge again.  I'm very excited at the prospect of seeing more from these new actors and found it amusing that the writers created an alternate time-line where none of the old episodes or movies even have to fit in anymore.  Clever!  Sure, it's a quick and easy way to break the mold, but like I say...I've already got plenty of DVD's in the old mold.

The actors were all great!  They brought a new energy to the old characters.  Sure, there are a lot of new special effects and razzle-dazzle, but that is a PLUS.  I don't need to watch Klingon destroyers fly in slow motion for 15 minutes (already have that).

Basically, there are a few old fans that will pooh-pooh this movie and not even sit through it because of their predetermination to hate it.  Let them.  For every old fan that throws this in the trash, I promise there are two or more new fans taking their place. I've talked to many friends who never cared for Star Trek, but they loved this movie.  I think the reasons why are clear.  It's a lot of fun!  I'd have to say it's the best science fiction movie since ""Serenity"" and that is saying a lot.",1258416000,8,1647,4.241157556270096
3472729,5,B001AVCFJM,"When this film was released a few months ago, it came in the wake of very, very generous reviews.  Toted as one of the best action films of the year, one of the best origin style remakes of the decade and one of the best science fiction films, well, ever, `Star Trek' had mighty big shoes to fill before it ever even graced the theater screen.

Guess what?

It delivers!

With the expansion of Oscar's `Best Picture' category a lot of my friends are anxiously awaiting a Best Picture nomination for the mighty `Star Trek', and while I am nearly positive that will not happen I will guaranty you that this film will grace quite a few critics top ten lists, and rightfully so.  Some have claimed this to be a masterpiece in filmmaking, and while I will not be quick to call it that (I still heavily prefer Nolan's masterpiece `The Dark Knight') I will say that this is the most fun I have had in the theater in years, and what Abrams does here is astonishing, really.

I think what makes `Star Trek' work so well is that it accepts the humor that can be found in the idea behind this film without ever falling into camp, but elevating that said humor with a genuinely serious tone, marvelously crafted action sequences, stirring character development and an intelligent plot that actually prods at our thinking capacities.  This film could have easily been nothing more than a hodgepodge of explosions and aliens and steamy chemistry between the slew of `hot young things' gracing the screen.  Instead of giving us a generic, clichd take on the series, Abrams and company reinvent it, bringing it up to date and giving us something that longstanding fans will gobble up, but that newly converted followers can also thoroughly enjoy.

To be frank, I kind of hate `Star Trek' the television series, and I found the previous films to be rather stupid (don't pelt me please).  But that is the beauty of this film.  Someone like me, who would never bother to watch the TV show even if I was bored and had nothing else to do, can sit back and become completely overtaken by this fantastic film.

I don't really see a purpose in going into the plot here, since it is the gradual unveiling that makes this film so intense and gratifying, but in short (and this should be harmless) the film really elaborates on how Kirk became captain of the Starship Enterprise and how his bond with Spock was formed.  It also goes to great lengths to flesh out these two men as peers, enemies and eventual comrades.  Yes, there is dangers looming thanks to the evil Nero and his planet destroying mission, but the heart of this film can be summed up in the relationship between Kirk and Spock.

My wife spent the entirety of this film drooling over Chris Pine, who she feels looks like a young Brad Pitt.  While she was drooling I was admiring his spunky take on Kirk.  I am not a fan of William Shatner so I was interested to see how Pine (a relative unknown until this year) would handle the character.  He blew me away.  He was cool and collected with perfect touches of angst and rebellion.  Zachary Quinto is impeccable as Spock, delivering a top-notch performance of a man fighting his own emotions so as to fit in with his people.  There is a ferocious restraint he uses so that one can always sense the toll this is taking on him as a person.  Zoe Saldana is stunning.  Yeah, I don't know what else to say.  She delivers a nice performance, but above all else, she is STUNNING.  Simon Pegg is a complete scene stealer (what else is new) as Scotty.  He's hilarious.  The entire cast is spot on and perfect for their roles and deliver a great ensemble that elevates this film.

So, is this one of the best action films of 2009?  Yes, it is.  Is this one of the best origin style remakes of the decade?  You bet your sweet bottom.  Is it one of the best science fiction films EVER?

Only time will tell on that one.",1258416000,6,3895,4.456214689265536
3472730,1,B001AVCFJM,"I love Star Trek and always have. However, this movie was complete garbage. People say how great it was, and how it was going to reinvigorate Trek. Well, you should have been worried when Abrams said he was more of a fan of Star Wars. Because guess what? We got am almost exact 'Clone' of Star Wars Episode IV.

Let's see we start off with:
1. A amall ship being attacked by a larger ship:
Star Wars = Tantive IV vs Star Destroyer
Star Trek = USS Kelvin vs Narada
2. Which directly leads to a farmboy living with family and dreaming of space:
Luke with Owen and Beru
Jim and his mother
3. Then he meets an older wise man who knew his father and then asks him to join some crazy space mission and visits a bar:
Obi-Wan Kenobi
Captain Pike
4: Then has to go on a rescue mission to save someone on a big ship with that partner he originally hated but ends up becoming really good friends with by the end:
Han Solo
Spock
5: Then they end up destroying the evil large ship that can destroy planets:
Death Star
Narada
6: Then medals are given out at the end in a big ceremony.

Wow, original thinking on Abrams part.

Plus the way they think that to make Kirk more accessible, he has to come from a single parent home, be a thug that starts barfights, oh, and now the Enterprise is being built in Riverside, Iowa now, which has always been Kirk's home. Kirk always represented the best of humanity, what we strove to be. He was an overachiever often succeeding even in no-win scenarios, but of course it's been replaced now, because apparently it was boring. We have a ship that looks ridiculous, the nacelles look like something off a 50's era car, and the bridge looks like an Apple store.

So the only thing Nero cared about was revenge on Spock. Never once considering that he could simply solve the problem and use the Red Matter to destroy the star that would eventually cause Romulus's destruction. How about the fact that with Vulcan destroyed and only 10,000 Vulcan's left, there is an imperative to breed and repopulate. This leaves a very small gene pool, and the only option to prevent stagnation is to mate with humans or other compatable humanoids. In this respect, Spock, who has always been portrayed as the outsider, now becomes the template of hybridization.

And now the other problems to be faced. V'ger and the Whale Probe are still heading to Earth in this film, and they never explained why the ships were so much more advanced looking. They should have at least made it so that 23rd century Starfleet somehow got 24th century technology. Abrams blew continuity out of the water as well with all the original crew being on the ship. What? Are they all the same age now? The original timeline had him born in 2245. So in this movie set in 2258, he would have been 13, are you serious? But guess what people, in the new film he's been born four years earlier, which would biologically be impossible, since the sperm that created the original Chekov wouldn't have existed yet.

Ridiculous film, bad copy of Star Wars and a disgrace to what has come before.",1258416000,25,3070,4.4537366548042705
3472731,3,B001AVCFJM,"This movie special-effects you to death.  Perhaps I've become jaded by movie technology, but I am weary of films that seem to exist solely to show the abilities of the computer graphics department.  The Star Trek TV series and many of the films worked because of characterzations, not special effects.  For example, the design of the alien Romulan ship made no logical sense.

I've also wearied of the grossly overused time travel plot line.  By now, it's become a clich.

The characters were stereotyped and overblown - Kirk especially - and Scottie was a virtual caricature.  As to being true to the Star Trek story line . . . well, let's just say there were some disappointing aspects.

WARNING!  SPOILER ALERT!!

1. Checkov did not join the original series until the second season and therefore would not have been on the maiden voyage.  And why would a seventeen-year-old receive such responsibility?  How did he get into Starfleet Academy at such a young age, much less graduate by age seventeen?

2. A romance between Spock and Uhura?  Please!  It destroys Spock's basic character and was never so much as hinted at in any other installment.  His embracing of emotion later in life is logical but not earlier.  The conflict of logic versus emotion is one thing, but losing his cool and attacking Kirk is out of character for Spock.

3. Vulcan destroyed?  Spock's mother dead?  How is that possible?  What was the planet Vulcan in all the subsequent (chronologically speaking) episodes?  How did his mother appear later in time?  Or will there be a sequel that puts everything back to the way it was?  Or is.  Or should be.  Whatever.

4. This film's Enterprise interiors looked nothing like the original sets, which does, after all, form the basis of the ship's design.

5. The story of Christopher Pike as told originally in the two-part presentation using the original pilot (with Jeffrey Hunter as Pike) was completely ignored.  Are we to assume Pike encountered the mind-controlling aliens before this story and subsequently was disfigured?  Remember that Spock was part of his crew then.

6. Why would Starfleet hand the captaincy of the fleet's star ship (pun intended) to an inexperienced rule-breaker like Kirk?  Doesn't pass the logic test.  And in The Wrath of Kahn, Bones states that Kirk received recognition for reprogramming the Kobyashi Maru scenario.  This movie has him nearly drummed out of the Academy for it.

7. Nimoy's appearance as an elderly Spock made no sense in the movie.

The movie kept my attention and is well constructed, but it failed to satisfy me.  Believability has been a hallmark of Star Trek but not this film.",1258416000,6,2656,4.874439461883408

Now for the statue, very, very cool. Solid metal. The ship is brushed finished, the stand is all shiny chrome except for the inside of the badge symbol is more a brushed finish. It's pretty awesome. My only thing, I expected it to be taller, from the pics, it just seemed taller. Not a deal breaker, just shorter then what I had in my mind looking at the pic for 3 months.

3472735,4,B001AVCFJM,"The movie is an epic journey that covers 25 years of time.  It starts the day that James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is born.  Through brief clips, we watch him grow up to become the ""smartest repeat offender in Iowa.""  Meanwhile, we also watch Spock (Zachary Quinto) grow up on Vulcan.  Half Vulcan and half Human, Spock struggles with where he really belongs.

Just as Kirk is finishing his academy training, an old nemesis comes back.  Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan, has been waiting 25 years to finish extracting his revenge.  But just what is his plan?  Can Kirk stop it?  And where will the next member of the Enterprise crew pop up?

Even though I've only seen maybe half a dozen of the Original Series movies, I knew enough to know what characters to watch for.  And a few of them pop up in the best places.  I actually had to laugh the first time we saw Scotty (Simon Pegg).  They take some liberties with the characters (or my understanding of them at least), but it worked well for this movie.

When I described this movie as an epic journey, I wasn't exaggerating.  It feels much longer than its running time.  That's not a bad thing because I was entertained the entire time.  It starts slowly, establishing the characters of Spock and Kirk, but once the villain reemerges, it grows intense quickly.  And it balances some very serious drama with some truly funny laughs.  The action is great, especially as we near the climax, and the effects bring everything to life.

There is not a weak performance in the cast, but that is especially true or our two leads.  I've only ever seen Chris Pine as a romantic lead, but he makes a great action hero.  I'm not even slightly surprised to report that Zachary Quinto absolutely nails Spock.  When he was cast, I couldn't picture a better actor, and that holds true after having seen it.

This movie is a reboot of the Star Trek franchise.  I knew that going in, but they way they did it left me with a very sad feeling.  But it was also a great way to go about it, and my friends who are fans don't seem to mind how it was handled.

I feel like I've been on a grand journey, and I am curious where they will take Star Trek from here.  Yep, sign me up for the sequel.",1258416000,2,2213,4.3447432762836184
3472736,5,B001AVCFJM,"This movie is a perfect example of the atmosphere of the original series and I feel that a lot of people are missing out on that. Star Trek wasn't a series that originally prided itself on projected scientific data or theories, nor did it prove to have writing of a Shakespearean quality. Instead, the show was intended to be fun and entertaining.  It doesn't matter if there's a little bit of silliness permeating the movie as the TV series displayed much of the same. The people stating that Star Trek (well, at least TOS) is the ultimate highbrow entertainment should really reconsider what they've been watching all these years and stop viewing with rosy hues of nostalgia!",1258329600,6,677,4.786324786324786
3472737,5,B001AVCFJM,"First off, I consider myself a true Trekkie.  Yes, Trekkie.  Trekker, Trekkie, whatever.  I'm not offended by either label.  I've loved the show since I started watching TOS with my Mom back in the '60s.  TOS is still my favorite, always will be.  It was the beginning of this fantastic voyage Gene has taken us on.  About the only series I never really watched was DS9.  I guess there wasn't enough 'boldly going' in it, being it was on a space station.  I'm sure, in time, I'll pick up on watching it.  Of course, Next Gen was my second favorite, but I also enjoyed Enterprise and Voyager.

As I said in the title, this is a new dawn for the Star Trek franchise.  Unfortunately, we all get old, and the only 'boldly going' all the characters in all the other series are doing at this point would to the head.  What has kept this series alive for so long is change.  There's no need to nitpick this movie about how it relates to Star Trek canon.  It's a new arc in the Star Trek universe.  There's nothing wrong with that.  And this movie does a pretty good job at its purpose: bringing back my Trek.  If it gets me more Trek and it is Trek -- which this movie is -- I'm all for it.",1258329600,4,1183,4.182222222222222

3472740,5,B001AVCFJM,"I would encourage anyone who has neglected to read the one star reviews to breeze by a few.  They overanalyze, nit-pick, cry canon, and all the while they forget where Star Trek came from.  Plot holes, fuzzy science, continuity problems and totally illogical sequences of events are all par for the course.  Star Trek was pitched, forty-odd years ago, as a ""wagon train to the stars.""  Your archetypical white hats shoot it out with your archetypical black hats and justice prevails.  Star Trek swapped out six shooters for phasers and recast Tonto as a guy with pointy ears and an unfortunate hair cut.  It's kitsch with just the right amount of heart.  Those among you who regard this movie as a corruption of the creator's vision, let me remind you that his vision included: Nazi planets, Mafia planets, space hippies, badly choreographed fight sequences with stunt doubles that bear no resemblance to the actors, and less than a dozen filmed sequences and stills of the starship Enterprise that were reused over and over again for the duration of the series (all very grainy and since they have been digitized, you can see the wire the ship was hanging by.)  Silliness, but we love it.  Like a big old spacey cheeseburger.  And I think that J.J. Abrams cinematic offering is a clear demonstration of that same love.  There are a number of things that don't make sense ... but now, when people crack jokes about James T. Kirk making out with green women, they will actually have some basis for it.  Never actually happened on the show.",1258243200,48,1538,4.7406015037593985
3472741,3,B001AVCFJM,"The latest installment of the Star Trek series is a good movie, and it was worth the price of the tickets.  However, this movie is not a good STAR TREK movie.  Star Trek has always been about the stories and the characters.  This movie focuses on action and explosions, much like Transformers or other movies of this genre.  The story here is not Star Trek and the flimsy excuse that this is an alternative timeline is feeble.  There are too many holes between the story lines and the original canon to list.  It is an attempt to milk more money from a highly successful franchise (look at how many DVD reissues have been marketed).  If you want to watch a good movie, buy this DVD.  If you want to watch good Star Trek, go back to the television series (""The Visitor"" from Star Trek:  Deep Space Nine for example).  This movie is not your father's Star Trek, but then again, it's not Star Trek.",1258243200,4,895,4.402439024390244
3472742,5,B001AVCFJM,"I'm going to say this up front: I am not a Trekkie.  I've seen one Star Trek film, and to be honest I can't remember which one it was (one of the 90's ones); I do remember I wasn't overly impressed.  Not my cup of tea, you could say.  However, I've enjoyed J.J. Abrams's films (don't watch TV; sorry folks!), and loved Chris Pine in SMOKIN' ACES, so I figured STARK TREK was a sure-fire delight.  I was right.

I won't rehash the plot, because while there IS one, it's so convoluted that I couldn't possibly hope to get it right; it involves time travel, and a sinister-looking Eric Bana (underused and underwritten, unfortunately) who has a grudge against pretty much everyone, but especially Spock, played with jaw-dropping aplomb by Zachary Quinto (and also a much-welcomed Leonard Nimoy; I told you this was a weird plot).  Along for the ride are names that Trekkies will recognize: Dr. Bones McCoy (Karl Urban at his finest); Uhura (Zoe Saldana); Scottie (Simon Pegg, also underused); Sulu (John Cho); and others.  Bruce Greenwood is a delight as always as the rugged Captain who belies in Kirk no matter what, and Anton Yelchin manages to steal most of his scenes as Checkov (much as he did in the recent TERMINATOR film).

The other major star here are the special effects, and I must say, they are not lacking.  This is a heart-pounding ride, an action film in the old-school vein of quick wit and terrific explosions.  What keeps it from drowning in its twisted plot is the script, Abrams's spot-on direction, and Chris Pine as the lead role.  Pine shows he can be an action star with depth, a genuinely good actor in a role usually reserved for those with more muscles than talent.  Overall, STAR TREK is a pure and utter delight; it's not quite a classic, though I'm sure sci-fi fans my argue for it (and I won't stop them).  I'm not sure how it appeals to Trekkies, but for someone like myself, who's new to the series, this film is a kick-a** ride, and not one to be missed.",1258243200,,1987,4.5322128851540615

I'm sure the 1-Star people will say that I have no business then commenting on a Star Trek movie since I am not a full blown Trekkie.  However, for all the REASONABLE people out there I feel a need to add a little sensibility to the discussion.

The main points I see in the 1-Star comments is this idea that ""This is not Star Trek"" or ""That just doesnt make sense"" or ""Oh, lets just use time travel to fix all the problems.""

O.K. first of all people this is a MOVIE!  A Science Fiction MOVIE!  None of it is based on anything real or logical.  Enjoy it for what it is, a fun entertaining movie.  I saw it 5 times in the IMAX (not IMAX) theatre.  The picture was fantastic and the sound was crystal clear and LOUD.

Now, almost 50 years after the crew of the USS Enterprise beamed into our living rooms Star Trek makes it's return to the big screen...but it's not like the last time.

This time around, we are shown a world that is gritter, funnier, and dare I say flashier than your daddy's Star Trek universe. J.J. Abrams has re-vamped Star Trek for a mass audience appeal throwing away most of the traditional sci-fi techno babble and slow moving plots. These elements are replaced with tons of action and simple to follow diologue. A true Star Trek fan would scream bloody murder with matters such as these, but Abrams covers all the bases. He has not done away with the origional Star Trek universe the plot of this new world pays tremendous respects to it's roots with a story that is all about why the universe of Star Trek has been re-vamped beinging in the past. Along with a special appearence by the legendary Leonard Nimoy, he is the one that bridges the gap between the two worlds and passes the torch to the new cast beautifully. 'Star Trek' is the beigning of a brand new generation with an incredible young cast who will hopefully make many more Star Trek films in the coming future and who knows maybe even some new TV shows.

By creating an alternate timeline the new movies have no limits.  I see this as genius.

3472753,5,B001AVCFJM,"The minor disappointments I had with some little items are buried by the amount of great things that is the Star Trek Blu. The packaging is the single hinged chassis with cardboard slip cover, but the info sheet (typical rear cover art) is a hot-glued paper that cannot fit anywhere once it comes off. The resulting Blu art front is a head shot of Pine and the back is Quinto.

The picture is as good as would be expected, with plenty of great space effects, the heavy lens glare that Abrams likes does not bleed too bad but ILM does not disappoint. They went with TrueHD which gives an adequate immersion, some of the best tests were with Spocks ship and that unique  sound (but 7.1 DTS would have been nice). Plenty of reference points throughout, but even with that clarity I still couldn't get a read on some of the little things (tried freezing the fence signs in the Corvette scene, freezing some of the panel displays to read what the actors were looking at, etc.). But what takes the time and is worth every moment for the supplement geeks like me is the entire disc 2.

Disc 1: Menus are unfortunately only minimal still animation (no live action or HD pics).
Commentary by the makers.

Disc 2: Blue screen animated left sided selections. Most items pop up with an ""extended"" option that has an icon appear when watching each documentary to facilitate viewing little snippets of additional material, or each one can be watched individually - no play all on anything with this disc.

* 16:41 To Boldly Go. Several extensions including the Kirk dilemma (1:58), more Green Girl stuff (3:25). The main piece covers aspects of creation, whys and what fors. All of these supplements are HD interviews of the filmmakers spliced with low def footage (past and present Treks).

* 28:53 Casting. Once again all HD present footage mixed with grainy low def shots of behind the scenes - gives some good material on why we saw who we did.

* 24:33 Starships. Concepts, art design and some of my favorite stuff on the making of regarding construction. Seven extensions are selectable here including Warp Drive and Paint stuff.

* 16:30 Aliens. Shows the meetings and thought process behind some of the critters and humanoids. Five extensions here.

* 16:10 Planets. Some nice history for Trek regarding the Vasquez Rocks, which showed an obvious deleted sequence  - made me look forward to those even more.

* 9:22 Props and Costumes. One extension here about Klingons - which led to another whole deleted sequence I was now REALLY wanting to watch them.

* 9:45 Sounds. I enjoyed this one the most as the sounds intrigued me when I first saw this in theaters. Nice homage/respect paid to the old series connections.

* 8:47 Gene Roddenberry vision. A nice history with at least half of it being Nimoy narrating/being interviewed (there was a blatant absence of someone here but you will notice that through this entire set).

* 13:30 Deleted Scenes - FINALLY. Play all option with commentary on/off of Abrams, Kurtzman.
- Spock's birth. Throughout all of these you notice Winona's entire screen time was removed. Nice little plug on how he gets his name.
- Klingon battle with the Narada, effects unfinished - which leads into an entire storyline removal - did not agree with the reasons for the removal but oh well.
- Dysfunctional home life of the early Kirk sequence. Explains who that kid was on the road and who the voice was on the car phone.
- Spock's parents arguing about which side Spock should embrace.
- Klingon Prison Planet sequence - wow. I want this in the director's cut. Would have explained a great deal of how Nero and the Narada disappeared.
- Vulcan sequence prior to destruction (Vasquez Rocks).
- Kirk and Green Girl - can never have too much of that. Once you see this you can find out what Uhura and Kirk were really talking about in the theatrical cut (Klingon Prison - not battle).
- Scene involving more Green Girl and Kirk defeating the Maru test - good scene.
- Kirk apologizing to Green Girl - had to go once the others were cut.

* Simulator: Mix of animated and slight HD footage of interactive material on the Enterprise and the Narada. The vast majority of material centers on the Narada (weapons, propulsion etc.).

* 6:22 Gag Reel. A brief retro title sequence followed by a hilarious slew of swearing by even the best (priceless watching Nimoy cuss his lines).  Fast paced and fun.

* 3 trailers.

Everything subtitled in French, Spanish, & Port.

Disc 3. Digital copy and game demo. Did not use either.

Overall, I had a great time going through all of this and I honestly think even the discerning Trekkie will be happy with this product. Yes, I feel the deleted scenes should have been left in as they explained some obvious gaps in the film, but at least we got to see them. The HD screenings have been very popular and I don't tire of watching this through and through. Enjoy.",1258070400,259,4916,4.640552995391705

I have pretty much stuck with the Trek franchise (Tho I truly hated the one with Captain Janeway...can't recall the name of the series) Next Gen was fun from the get go, and DS9 grew on me. Enterprise was an overlooked gem imo. So walking into the theater I was a little hesitant. That quickly dissolved after the brilliant first 10 minutes of the film. Is it the same show I grew up with? No. Of course not. But does it capture the same energy and spirit- I think so. Lest we forget in our advancing age- Trek WAS an adventure show that was sometimes just about the ADVENTURE. It was not always pointy headed ""thinking"" all the time. That's what made it a great show- a little something for everyone. The other thing that made it click was a great cast, and this movie also brings together a great cast who appear to be able to handle whatever is thrown at them.

From the moment he heard there was a new Star Trek movie coming out with the original characters, he was like a kid in a candy store.  Every week he would ask when is it coming and every day he was surfing the internet looking for news.

Sad to say he didn't live to see what he so anxiously waited for.  When the movie opened at our theater I took off work early to catch it on IMAX.  I even wore his favorite Star Trek shirt with the saying, ""If you're wearing a red shirt, RUN!!!!"".  I cried through most of the movie (thinking about hubby). The movie was fantastic and JJ did a great job of portraying the characters and the actors fit their parts well.  Chris Pine plays Kirk as if he was born to the role, and Zachary Quinto was awesome as the younger Spock. The rest of the cast was excellent as well and Scotty was too funny for words.  I thought it was brilliant that the character of Sulu got to use his fencing abilities, because we didn't really get to see much in the original series.  Seeing Leonard Nimoy as the older Spock made it even better, since he is my favorite character.

However, there is one thing that my husband would not have liked and that was a certain relationship between two of the main characters.  But I thought it was interesting and well played.

If you haven't seen it yet, I won't spoil anything, but if you are a true Star Trek fan or even if you aren't this will be a great addition to your home movie library.

Enjoy and have a great time.",1257811200,9,1658,4.140625
3472761,5,B001AVCFJM,"Absolutely the best work of Star Trek I've seen since I don't know when.  No more old-man captain of a family cruise ship, no more spineless captain of a ship lost in space, no more boring alien ""prophets"", and no more captain who would rather let a whole race die than interfere with ""natural"" development.

Is the movie 100% accurate in terms of science or military convention?  Absolutely not, but since when has Star Trek ever adhered to accuracy over entertainment?  People whine about things like the Enterprise being built on the ground or folks being teleported across a solar system, but this is Star Trek, not the Discovery Channel.  If realism is what mattered to the viewers, then the show would've never made it onto TV.  The fictional technology serves the story, not the other way around.

Strangely, despite all the action and truly awe-inspiring special effects, the joy of this movie stems from the characters rather than the spectacle.  Before seeing the movie, I had extreme doubts about whether the actors could truly overcome decades of recognition; I was absolutely wrong.  Each and every actor completely owns their given part and paves the way for a very promising future.  Each is just similar enough to the original to allow for instant recognition, yet different enough to make them all seem like completely new characters.

Despite all my expectations of another dull presentation, this movie is easily the best I've seen this entire year and might very well be the best Star Trek movie I've seen to date.  I honestly feel sorry for people so obsessed with realism or the boring trend of Star Trek in recent years that they are unable to enjoy this flick.  This film makes the phrase ""to boldly go"" actually MEAN something again.",1257811200,4,1758,4.839464882943144

I have seen every episode of every Star Trek since then.  I hate it when they mess with history - but hey - its an alternate universe.  The past has changed - get over it!  I took all my nieces and nephews to see this movie (no Star Trek history there) and they all fell in love with it.  I saw it 4 times - 3 in IMAX.  I could not get enough of it.  I am buying a Blu-Ray player just for this DVD.  I expect to wear it out.  Give it a chance.  Introduce a new generation to Star Trek.

3472764,5,B001AVCFJM,"To sum up my feelings about this movie, let's just say that I can't remember the last time I enjoyed watching a movie as much as I did this one.

For background, I grew up watching TOS in syndication and have been a huge Spock fan since I was five years old. I reluctantly tuned in to TNG when it premiered, and was hooked from the second season on. I'm no Trekkie/Trekker, but I really love those two series and their respective movies. I've never had much interest in the later series, and was a little reluctant to watch this movie when I saw how it was being so actively marketed to non-fans.

Here's what I didn't like about the movie: I wasn't particularly wild about the overall storyline. It wouldn't have been my choice, but I've seen far worse. Unlike some Trek fans, though, I'm neither offended, disgusted, nor troubled by it. Also, I really don't like action sequences that are comprised of dozens of 1- and 2-second shots edited together into a ill-defined mass of motion and confusion. Too many current directors seem to think that's a great technique. Not me.

Here's what I didn't mind about the movie: Time travel, parallel universes, plot holes and convenient coincidences have always been part and parcel of Star Trek. Remember, it's just a movie.

Here's what I liked about the movie: I absolutely loved the numerous in-jokes, references, and allusions to past incarnations of Star Trek. In fact, they turned what may well have been an OK movie into a really fun experience, and that's really what sold me on this movie. The actors all did a great job playing younger versions of characters that people like me have known and loved for many years.

Incidentally, the woman I saw this movie with wouldn't know Captain Kirk from Captain Kangaroo. She had no idea why I kept laughing at many places, but even with no foreknowledge of the Star Trek universe, she thought the movie was great.",1257724800,2,1908,4.649851632047477

The original fans will have numerous things to point out, and some will be negative, but there are plenty of things that will reawaken fond memories of the original series.",1257724800,,447,4.36144578313253

3472768,3,B001AVCFJM,"As an old-time trekker who grew up with Star Trek TOS, I was absolutely chomping at the bit to see this movie when it arrived at the theaters. I was vaguely disappointed overall by the emphasis on frenetic action at the expense of a more cerebral plot line, and rather irritated, like some others, by the whole time travel thing, particularly the idea of Spock's young and old selves talking to each other -- how can this make sense if they're the same person? Even in the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, not known for the most rigorous adherence to real-life scientific principles, to my best recollection the good Doctor always warned Marty McFly to avoid any interaction with his own temporal alter-ego, in order ""not to disturb the space-time continuum"". This at least made the situation a bit more believable. By way of another example, in Ray Bradbury's ""The Martian Chronicles"", when Col. Wilder met with the supposedly extinct Martian, they were able to communicate but could not physically touch, because they inhabited different spatiotemporal dimensions.

Argh... my brain hurts, so I want to briefly touch on a few other points:

The concept of the venerable planet Vulcan being totally obliterated due to the whims of one solitary madman was really quite difficult to deal with, not least because I wanted to see some more of the Vulcan people and learn more about their culture! To be sure, some may disagree with me, but I feel that the casting of, OMG -- Winona Ryder as Spock's mom, with her delicate, doe-eyed beauty, was actually a flash of inspired brilliance. The other memorable bits in my mind are Kirk's tryst with the green Orion girl, and Spock's touchdown on the ice planet with the frightening monsters. These strange creatures seemed to jump out of nowhere and gave me a rush of adrenaline that propelled me back to the eerie atmosphere of the old series, where strange talking rock-creatures and vampire clouds were par for the course. Indeed, these are the kinds of things that made Star Trek so memorable to me through the years.

Incidentally, it occurs to me that, tacky as it may have been at times, the original series had an element of theater that, in my opinion, is basically lacking in this movie, as well as, quite frankly, all the recent TV spinoffs for that matter. No actor has ever come close to William Shatner's sublimely ridiculous yet satisfying performances. He was in a league of his own, and to see the deliciously hammy way that he spoke his lines was a cathartic experience of the first magnitude, a guilty pleasure like no other. Some comedians have satirized it over the years, but always, I suspect, with a certain degree of reverence.

In conclusion, although I did not particularly care for the overall plot, it did have its moments when I think back on it, and therefore I would recommend this movie with some reservations, and look forward to the next installment. I realize that the producers are trying to strike a balance between making this material fresh and new vs. trying to please long-time Trek fans, but I hope that, in the next movie, the scales might tip just a little more in favor of the latter.",1257724800,6,3168,4.7441016333938295

She has now gone back and watched everything I have that's Star Trek. This movie didn't just reinvigorate a falling franchise, it sparked what could be the largest popularity this franchise has ever had.

To the so-called purists who have done nothing but rip this movie, well, just stick to your old TV series and movies and the rest of us will move forward, including what we already have, and we'll continue to enjoy new Trek for years to come.",1257638400,3,740,4.401459854014599
3472771,5,B001AVCFJM,"This movie does not replace the other Trek shows and movies, it parallels. The original series has alternate, parallel universes; my favorite is ""Mirror, Mirror,"" TOS episode 33 - which has a very different Capt. Kirk; the Terran Empire it is one of the most drastic re-imaginings of ST (and we already knew by this time that Kirk has a dark side - in the first TOS first season episode ""The Enemy Within"").

There are several alternate time line stories in the various Trek series - some involving time travel, and many while Roddenberry was at the helm (including the aforementioned episodes that shows a vicious Kirk) which shows that such things are not against Roddenberry's vision at all. True Star Trek fans can, and do, appreciate alternate universe stories.

I grew up on TOS, and watched all the other Trek series with passion. I collected Star Trek novels. I wallpapered part of my bedroom with extra copies of Star Trek blueprints. I wear a VOY outfit every year for a campus lecture I give on literary influences in Star Trek. I show the STNG episode ""The Defector"" to my English 101 students (for their definition essay assignment). And yet, somehow, I manage to also be a fan of this film. I do not mind diversity in the Trek universe, I do not mind re-imagining (if it wasn't for alternate universes, would we have seen Uhura in that great ""Mirror, Mirror"" uniform? The Terran Empire was evil, but what uniforms they had!). The other series are still alive - always will be.

If you don't like this particular series (I hope there are sequels), that's fine but do not project your dislike to all fans - we are a diverse lot (as appropriate for Roddenberry's vision). For instance, I was never a big Deep Space 9 fan although I still watched it faithfully, and it did have one of my favorite ST episodes: ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" - another re-imagining, though not as drastic as ""Mirror, Mirror."" But I will not call a Deep Space 9 fan as being somehow not a true Star Trek fan or less of one. For would not such judgment prove that it was I who was actually not the true Star Trek fan?

This movie is an alternate universe Star Trek - accept it as such and enjoy the ride, for it is a great ride. Besides the great action, there are good characterizations. Yes, Nero could have used a bit more character development, and Spock needs a bit more explaining though I get the feeling we will learn more as the series progresses; for those who feel that the characters are not fully explained or developed, if they were fully explained and developed in this movie, what is left for future movies? I like that there is some mystery that is only hinted at, and that we have to wait to find the answers to (Spocks and Uhura's relationship for one!). There are also plenty of inside jokes and nods to all previous Star Trek series (each time I see the movie I catch more). So, is this a movie for real Trek fans? Yes. Infinite Diversity from Infinite Combinations - enjoy this re-imagining, this alternate universe.",1257638400,5,3025,4.565377532228361

During the late sixties the show was enticingly different and bound to reach its cult status.  It was always a wonderful departure from the endless inane sitcoms and the TV treadmill of rehashed Westerns, variety shows, and other drivel. 'Star Trek' did for TV during the sixties what '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight-Zone-The-Complete-Definitive-Collection/dp/B000H5U5EE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight Zone: The Complete Definitive Collection</a>' did during the late fifties.

How does the Prequel to the series add up?  Of course the technology makes this outing as worthwhile as most of the 'Star Trek' movies since the first one in '79, so we have to evaluate the other elements.  This time Chris Pine (who reminded me that Paul Walker could have taken the helm) plays a callow Kirk, and the prologue sports scenes of barroom brawls and drag racing in highway space vehicles.  More interesting is Spock's evolution as a vulcan valedictorian+.  Young Spock (Zachary Quinto*) is half human, half vulcan, so his apprenticeship to the enterprise gives us an offering of a hot-tempered maverick to go with the cool-headed logician--a conflicted young man who has to choose his own destiny.

The plot and places we visit are more familiar than the character exposition.  Although these elements are somewhat suspenseful, they are also less worthwhile.  In one scene when our heroes are out on a precipice, I felt the camera shots were vertiginous enough to carry the adventure--even if I felt I had been there before.  The menace of the villain (aptly named Nero [Eric Bana]) is palpable enough, but not necessarily distinctive.  The visuals and methods of their weaponry aren't entirely original, either, but there's enough thrill in the chase to find yourself clinging to your seat.

My favorite aspect-besides Spock's coming-of-age deliberations--is a wrap around time element that is quite effective.  I won't give away the guest star, but I got goose-flesh when time warp came into fruition.  Indeed, I should mention that with Bruce Greenwood, it is a bit of an indictment that the elder members of the cast carry the show far better than their younger counterparts.

As escapist adventure, `Star Trek' more than satisfies, but the beginning adventure doesn't always ""Go where no man has gone before"".  Especially for the ones in the audience.

Who fought a war with the Federation and who were never even seen until Original Series episode ""Balance of Terror""? However, the plot manages to sort this out.

The ""Enterprise"" crew look reasonably like (and act reasonably like) younger versions of the beloved original series characters, and there are lots of affectionate nods towards the old series, including McCoy's famous ""Dammit, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a ..."". Zachary Quinto is especially effective as Spock.

What were the Romulan's using for an OS? Windows98??  then poor little Spock is taunted for his mixed heritage by classmates who come from a culture where logic is the highest value and emotions frowned upon. teasing isn't logical. his classmates should be in bigger trouble than him for fighting. THE Biggest Plot Black Hole is  if the ""Bad guys"" are pissed because the Federation failed to save their home world and travel back in time before the destruction why aren't they just hot footing it to their planet to save it themselves???  also if Spock had a device/force that could be used as a planet killer he would have never allowed it to fall into ""enemy"" hands! that would surely not be logical.  what amazes me is why no one connected with the film couldn't be bothered to see the things that became apparent to me as problematic in the storyline. of course maybe they did and didn't care. after all it's just a summer blockbuster",1257638400,5,1475,4.67953667953668

While the movie had good action scenes and the acting was ok, it was not Star Trek as everyone remembers it. Perhaps it should have been called ""Star Trek, the alternate time line"", and should have had different characters.  When I saw the advertising for this movie, I though it was about the James T. Kirk we all know.  A story about his younger days at Star Fleet Academy and his early
assignments.  The other characters , Zulu, Chekhov and Uhura
were much younger than Kirk in the original series.  Yet they
seem to be about the same age in this movie. The producers tried
to get people in the theater by adding Leonard Nimoy to the cast.
He did not fit in this movie.  And it looked like someone dug Spock up from his grave to appear.
This is not Star Trek as the old trekkies know it. If they cannot come up with more voyages of the original Star Trek Enterprise 1701 and its sister ships 1701A, B, C, D and E as we know it. Then they should let sleeping dogs lie.

3472780,1,B001AVCFJM,"Do you know who liked this film?All of the people with ADD who could never sit still long enough to watch the various Trek series and therefore were not fans. As for the real fans(of which group I am proud to count myself amongst), this film will hit you like seeing your dog getting run over on Christmas morning;it is that sad and heartbreaking to see what J.J. has done to what Mr. Roddenberry slaved and fought for; namely, a glorious vision of the future where mankind is trying to evolve and live in unity with the universe using logic, reason,and yes, sometimes raw emotions. I am a second generation Trekkie, have watched all of the series and films as well as having read a great number of various Trek novels, and guess what? 40+ years of history,alien and future human cultures, ethics, characters,etc. are destroyed with a single film. I hope that Mr. Nimoy received a great deal of money to justify this atrocity. Why do I feel so strongly? Let me begin:
1)Kirk is a wild criminal youth and goes from being kicked out of the Academy to acting captain in only a few scenes. Nonsense.
2) The Orion girl at the Academy. If you know anything about Trek history (which clearly Abrams does not),a nonFederation member cannot attend the Academy without the recommendation of someone in Starfleet. The Orion Syndicate is a group of slave trading pirates and does not belong to the Federation. Also, Orion females emit an intoxicating hormone which literally drives human men crazy and thus would not make for an ideal classmate or crewmate.
3) Spock is too emotional and too sexual. Vulcans feel the need for sex only once every 7 years and he is engaged to T'Pring on his homeworld. In the series, he wished to uphold his family honour and was fully ready to marry her. No romance with Uhura was presented.
4) Alternate timelines are just a lazy excuse for not wanting to follow the Trek vision. Sorry Abrams, but your ""alternate Trek"" universe was garbage, and worse than any made for tv SciFi channel movie. Romulus is gone,Vulcan is gone,everything we Trekkies love about the true Trek universe is gone and replaced by Twilight in Space.
  I could go on, but I won't. Surfice it to say that if you are a true Trek fan, revelled in Mr. Roddenberry's vision of a better, more enlightened universe, you will hate this film. However, if you view Trek on the level of Flash Gordon and Star Wars you'll probably think that people like me are a bunch of crybabies. Each to his own. All I know is that at the end of this film, about half of the theatre was sitting with our mouths open and brains in a knot. ""What just happened? Was that for real""? Those statements were uttered more than once as we realised that Abrams has just massacred our Bible. Was there anything good about it? The special effects were awesome, casting was pretty much on the mark (the actor who played the young McCoy could literally had been DeForrest Kelley's clone in every way). Young Kirk really didn't capture anything about Shatner, which I don't know if that was on purpose since Shatner was publicly upset about not being included, but I didn't care for him at all. Quinto(aka Sylar for Heroes fans) was excellent with the material, but this just wasn't thought out or written by anyone who remotely cared about Trek. If you are a nonTrekkie, please don't write about how I need to get a life or how great you found the film to be. Trek films are supposed to be for those of us who have loved the series for 30+ years, not for the special effect junkies who want to see explosions in space.",1257552000,12,3575,4.549689440993789
3472781,5,B001AVCFJM,"Remember when Star Trek was fun? Well, it's fun again. For folks who aren't interested in anything new or different, there's the grand old TOS series on DVD. For others, there's this (plus viewings of favorite TOS episodes).

Like many others, I left the movie theater with mixed feelings. The alternate universe, the destruction of Vulcan (which, since we've seen comparatively little of the planet over the years was oddly emotional), the Spock-Uhura thing...they were all...different. And the movie really was leaving all those changes in place. It didn't pull a fifth-act ""save the future"" stunt. But I also left feeling really, really happy because for two hours I had had lots and lots of real, true fun at a Star Trek movie. I'd laughed out loud, with the rest of the movie theater, from a genuine place. I'd felt suspense, even while wondering at some of the plot holes. I'd seen a thoroughly enjoyable movie that has at its core the study of the relationships that pop culture has immortalized. This was the first time that had happened since First Contact.

So I went to see it again, because I wanted to have fun again, and I got over the strangeness of the alternate universe and found I enjoyed it for what it was. Are there plot holes? Yes, as there are in every Star Trek movie. Is the villain strangely stupid? Yes, but why not another baddie bent on destruction rather than on salvation? Do things change? Yes, but if they didn't, there could never again be suspense in a Star Trek movie because we'd all know, deep down, that nothing was really at risk because everyone would have to be intact and in place in time for TOS to begin.

What makes it work is the fun and the excellent casting. Chris Pine captures the devil-may-care side of Kirk and throws in just enough spot-on Shatner moments (the leg-crossed chair-sitting, for example) to connect his performance with Shatner's without merely copying. Zachary Quinto comes off as a rough draft of the Spock we know from TOS and the movies--in a good way. I realized I'd become used to a Spock who's comfortable with himself, and Quinto captures the unease of being caught between two worlds very well. And Karl Urban just is Bones. He's obviously studied DeForest's performance (and I've read that he's a longtime Trekkie), and he had the whole theater with him with his one-liners. The fact that Pine and Quinto both present characters who are still in the process of becoming makes Urban's already-there Bones the perfect counterpoint. The rest of the cast all entertain and engage. I'm not sure the character of Sarek matches with the disapproving father that I always thought he was, but again, the situation he's reacting to is different than what has gone before, I really enjoyed watching him watch his son navigate some treacherous waters. And Bruce Greenwood's Pike is simply fabulous.

For me, this Star Trek is worth having on DVD because it's rewatchable because of the great character moments. The balance of character and excitement is perfect, and there are moments of real humor and moments of real emotion. Which is what many, many of the TOS episodes were about in the first place.

I think people new to the franchise will enjoy the movie because it is fast-paced and not too full of itself. After all, everyone already knows Kirk and Spock even if they never watched the series, so in a sense everyone's coming home to these characters, even if it's the first time they've really watched Star Trek. For people already into Star Trek--well, if you want exactly what you saw 40 years ago on TOS, watch TOS, but if you're up for some fun, this more than fits the bill. It cancels out none of the great TV (or the movies, which cannot all be called great by a long shot), it merely adds to the possible ways to have fun watching Star Trek. And that's a very good thing indeed.",1257465600,2,3862,4.6818851251840945

The problem I had was with the story. Time travel is fine, going to an alternate universe is fine, but there were some things that just took me out of the movie.

  SPOILER WARNING

 First, after 30 plus years of Star Trek showing ships being built in space from Star Trek TMP on thru the other movies and TV shows JJ Abrams decides his new Enterprise will be built in a corn field.
 Then we go to the destruction of Vulcan and Spock prime watching this from another planet which is far enough away that the Enterprise is traveling for 5 minutes in the movie before Kirk is dropped off on the planet Spock is on.
 Then after all other Trek movies and TV shows explain that you have to be fairly close to a planet or ship to transport or ""beam"" someone to and from it, at the end of the movie you have the Enterprise ""beam"" Kirk and Spock halfway across the solar system from Saturn's moon Titan to Nero's ship orbiting Earth.
 My biggest complaint is the changes to Kirk. In the real military, personnel work their way up the ranks from cadet or ensign thru different grades until they become a officer. In the original Star Trek Gene Roddenbery took the time and effort to create a back history for Kirk where he served on other ships before becoming Captain of the Enterprise. In this new movie Kirk goes from Cadet to Captain which is incredible and totally unbelievable.

 I know Trek is fantasy and entertainment, but alot of people put a lot of time and effort into making these characters into ""people"" we could relate to and would like to spend time with.",1257465600,35,1722,4.386792452830188

There were a few parts that I didn't really like.

*cough* The slaughter of the Starfleet cadets at Vulcan *cough* At least we didn't see it, I don't think I could have kept my eyes dry for it. I was already gaping when when the Enterprise arrived and flew through the wreckage of the fleet. Thank Goodness that Sulu forgot to release the 'parking brake'.

If you're a die hard fan than this might not be the movie for you, but if Star Trek is Star Trek to you than I suggest that you give it a shot and decide for yourself.",1257379200,2,573,4.098214285714286

Second, I had to ignore a lot of inaccuracy and inconsistencies with the original Star Treck Vision, Story Line, and Characters.  Lots of liberties were taken with the technologies and I had to ignore that too in order to find enjoyment in this movie.

J J Abrams is pretty good at putting together action and comedy packed fast moving dramas, but it was like he made this really tasty beef and vegetable stew without actually adding beef and vegetables.

So I say, 5 stars for Fun, but 1 star becouse it's not really Star Trek - Average 3 stars.

However, from a Star Trek fan prospective, it is a major blow to the Star Trek world. I now understand the movie's tag line; ""This is your father's Star Trek."" Yeah, no kidding, because it's been completely redone.

The short end - From a visual prospective, this Star Trek installment was GREAT! It had all the effects and looks that the rest of the movies couldn't or didn't do, thanks to advancements in movie making, obviously. For that part, visually speaking, I would give it a 4 1/5

The downside is the fact that JJ Abrams has taken a series of 40+ years and rewritten it! It is so rewritten that it could be compared to rewriting Star Wars and having Darth Vardar tell Luke, ""Luke, I'm not your father. Hans Solo is."" Of course, JJ would NEVER to that to the Star Wars ethos, since he is a Star Was fanboy, not to mention Lucas would castrate him.

The Spoke/Uhura relationship, what was that? Scotty not being the guy that had a major hand in building the Enterprise, instead he's working some second rate gig, etc, etc. For that, I would give the movie a  to 1.

The biggest misfire, I think, was the premise of a pissed off Romulin, who has all the power in the world to alter time, wanting more to revenge upon and kill Spoke, who tried to save the planet, instead of just altering time and saving his entire world. Hmmm. weak, at best. 1 1/2.

I've never understood writers and directors who come up with such weak stories and premises, that the viewer is asking the question ""why didn't he just do X,"" within 5 mins of witnessing the event. Star Trek is one of those movies. But, the movie still carries on in an entertaining way, so I can't complain too much.

Overall, I think the movie is good. I just don't think, from a Star Trek prospective, it's great. To completely redo a beloved series/world, is a major blow.",1257292800,5,1990,4.450549450549451

Unfortunately, that didn't happen and J.J. Abram's ""Star Trek"" is such a catastrophic misfire of a film that it's almost impossible to begin sifting through the wreckage in order to ascertain where it all went so horribly wrong. Suffice it to say, if you want a textbook example of how NOT to go about reviving a television and film franchise, then this film is it.

So how did he screw it up so badly?

Well, for a start, He completely disregarded the canon of the original series; decided to film a script with so many plot and credibility holes that it could double as a hunk of Gorgonzola; and, by his own admission, embraced a film-making sensibility that was the polar opposite of the franchise concept in order to try and hook an audience that apparently suffers from attention deficit disorder and a low IQ.

Largely though, you can ascribe the failure of this film to a case of misguided intent and having the wrong director at the helm.

After all, when the first question on a director's mind when attempting to reboot ""Star Trek"" is ""what can we learn from Star Wars here?"" (as is established in a behind-the-scenes extra on the DVD) then you've pretty much instantaneously established that you've got the wrong man for the job.

""Star Trek"" is not ""Star Wars"". People do not want ""Star Trek"" to be ""Star Wars"". If they want to watch ""Star Wars"" then they can go and watch ""Star Wars"".

I could go into myriad incidental details about what is bad about this film - the nauseating product placement; the irritating ""camera flare"" lighting; a ""Death Star-esque"" planet killing Macguffin that looks like a giant ball of Edam; the fact that the deck of the ""Enterprise"" looks like the interior of an iphone shop and that the engine room looks like the floor of a brewery - but they are not really the problem.

The fundamental problem with this film is that, cosmetic similarities aside, it is not ""Star Trek"" in any way, shape or form.

Whilst watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-West-Wing-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JLF3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The West Wing - The Complete First Season</a>, recently (a series which is the antithesis of this film in that it is brilliantly written, intelligently plotted and well-acted), a quote from Martin Sheen pretty much managed to sum up the feelings this film left me with. The quote in question - which makes explicit President Jed Bartlet's response to the question of whether his administration should be giving tacit support to a film-maker who makes gratuitous, bad films - is along the lines of, ""Why not? Nothing I do will really make a difference. Hollywood will only stop making crappy films when people stop paying to see them"".

My other half and I paid all of $3 to rent this DVD and still felt ripped off the following morning. Suffice it to say, we will be heeding Bartlet's dictum from hereon out and refusing to pay even one cent to rent, buy or watch a film of this quality ever again.",1257206400,30,3923,5.364227642276423

3472793,4,B001AVCFJM,"The Blu Ray is released Nov 17th. So how am I writing this review on Oct 30th? Well...for some reason Australia's been getting Star Trek Blu Ray releases well ahead of US dates. We got the Original 6 movie Blu Ray set several weeks before the US release and here we are at nearly 3 weeks ahead of the US with the new Star Trek Movie.

And you're wondering...how is it?
Not bad...But did it knock my socks off? Nope...not really...no. Should you buy it? YES!

What's the problem?
Muted colors. The film has a kind of browny, sandy washed out look to it. If I remember correctly, in the cinema the film looked more stunning. The bridge of the enterprise had a clean glassy and super colorful look to it. On Blu Ray, The reds, yellows and blues of the uniforms don't have the same striking color - they look dull and washed out. Skin tones are more grey and brown here with a hint of blue. Disappointing
The Blu Ray lacks that visual pop of the better recent releases. Think the intro sequence for Watchmen (stylised but stunning). This image is kind of soft and inconsistent. Some scenes are sharper, others flatter and softer. The space battle scenes should look a heck of a lot better. Given the kinetic energy of the movie, especially in combat, the detail can tend to get lost in the softness. You'll know there's a problem in the opening scenes with George Kirk with all the worst quaities I describe here.
Lot of people here commented on the lousy image quality of the original 6 movies on Blu Ray. In my book, at least the original Star Trek the motion picture on blu ray looks better than this.

Also, this film wins the award, hands down for the most overuse of lens flair...ever. If you don't believe me, check it out when you get it. You'll count at least 75% of the shots with some excessive flare glare on the screen. This is a major distration. Lens flare drowns out detail, overblows contrast frequently, etc etc. Related to this, the film also shows the worst elements of the anamorphic film process (drifting focus, exacerbated by those damned lens flares!!). JJ here's a tip. Please find yourself a new cinematographer!

Ok that's it for the rant. Let's get onto the good stuff.
This movie sounds damn good. Here's the thing - there's less surround whiz bang than you would expect but the sound mix is very good and highly effective. Dialogue is exceptionally clear. You can watch this move at a low level and still enjoy the dynamic range and hear every word of what is said. Important for us with a little baby at home. :) The music mix is subtle and smooth, and striking when it needs to be. Crank it up and you've got a great action movie soundtrack.

Despite what I said above the picture is not bad. There's no edge enhancement, there's no compression artifacts, there's no excessive grain and I have not noticed any noise reduction (or at least no excessive DNR). As a result there's no static grain pattern that I noticed. Shadow detail looks good, without excessive black crush. In summary apart from those damn lens flares (sorry last reference) it's watchable.

So should you buy it? Absolutely but please don't expect fireworks on the picture front and it will do the job. Besides, whatever issues there are with the picture, the DVD would be worse and it's not like you want to wait a few years for this be re-released again. I'm sure Paramount knows this. Whether this disc is an outstanding or an ok transfer, it will sell by the truckload.

Oh, and by the way the movie is really good. But you already knew that from the other reviews...

3472794,2,B001AVCFJM,"The Blu-Ray version of Star Trek was released in Australia yesterday (28th October), not sure why it is taking so long to be released in the U.S. On a scale of one to ten it is a 6.5 (not the movie but the packaging), you do get the 3rd disc digital copy which allows you to download the entire film to your iTunes (iPod) or PC equivalent, but who cares - you can because you can. this is a film designed for the big screen (it was released for Imax as well), so why bother with an iTunes version.

3472795,5,B001AVCFJM,"Let me say up front I am not a die-hard Star Trek fan. I did grow up watching original series re-runs, the tapes of the movies that my father bought, I've seen episodes from across the various spin-off shows and I've read some of the novels here and there so I've got a good working knowledge of the show. Having (like so many) assumed that Star trek was dead after the lack-luster Nemesis and the cancellation of Enterprise (a show that remains underrated in my opinion) I was rather surprised over a year ago when the teaser trailer for this movie popped up before Cloverfield announcing that J.J. Abrams was bringing it back. Having raised my expectations since then I went to a screening last night with hopes for a good Star Trek movie. That in short was what I got and more.

To start off with there's the cast. It's never an easy task replacing a well known cast with a new group of actors especially when the cast in question is those of the original Star Trek series but not only has this film done it has done well. I was initially skeptical of Chris Pine as Kirk but Pine not only fills the rather large shoes left before him but fills them admirably and by the end of the movie you have no doubt that he is Captain James T Kirk. In truth that statement can really be applied to the entire cast of ""new"" old characters but in particular it can be said of Zachary Quinto as Spock and Simon Pegg as Scotty as both (like Pine) fill some rather large shoes very nicely indeed. There's also a nice (if underused) villain in the form of Eric Bana as Nero plus a fantastic supporting cast including the ever excellent Bruce Greenwood as Captain Pike plus Ben Cross and a woefully underused Winona Ryder as Spock's parents. And then there's the return of Leonard Nimoy to the role that made him famous in some of the best and most unexpected scenes of the movie. In short it's one of the best Star Trek casts ever and the best for a feature film (in my opinion) since The Undiscovered Country.

This Trek has also got some really good production values in fact they put other Trek films to shame. The set designs have echoes of what we know from the original series but give a nice modern feel to them and this is especially true of the bridge of the Enterprise itself. The film's CGI is (in two words I use very infrequently) awe-inspiring on the big screen especially when it comes to the various ships sued in the film but especially of the Enterprise which (on the outside) looks like a perfect meshing of both the original TV series ship and the one used in the original series cast movies. In fact if one can find nothing else to say about this film it is that it has the best special effects in the history of Star Trek to date.

The film is an action film by any definition of that phrase. From the opening teaser sequence right thru to the end the film is full of space battles, sword fights and fist fights. The fights are all well staged and put similar sequences in the two most recent Trek films to shame. The space battles, thanks to the excellent CGI mentioned above, also come across as the best yet done for Star Trek as whole (or at least what I've seen of it). Yet while this might be an action film it hasn't lost what makes Star Trek so good to begin with.

That would be story. In what can be called increasingly rare in the Hollywood action movie the writers actually take the time to explore character development. This is especially true of the background and early years of Kirk and Spock. In fact it is the journey of these two young men whose destines has always been intertwined that forms the emotional center of this movie. Spock, always seen as the logical being, gets some emotional material in this film unlike we've seen in Star Trek prior to this point with that character (at least since he died but as they say that's another movie all together). That really brings us to the Nimoy scenes and the stick issue of continuity.

As I said I'm not a die-hard Trek fan so continuity doesn't really bother me in this case but I know it bothers some out there so let me the following. While this film features the original group of characters from the original series they're different versions of them. This is thanks to one of the tried and true plot devices of Star Trek: time travel and interference with the past. That said the interference causes a lot of changes from the subtle to moments where I can see some going ""blasphemy on the alter of Roddenberry!"" In particular there's two plot points (one of them being a relationship) which might do that but for those of us who realize (as the movie itself says) that the past has been altered and this is a new time-line it shouldn't be anything too upsetting and if fact it makes for some fascinating viewing. The film is also full of nice little references to various Trek stories of the past especially the best of the Trek films The Wrath of Khan. The scenes with Nimoy (including the most impressive Vulcan mind meld I've ever seen) illustrate this point beautifully: this is the end of the beginning (albeit a forty plus year beginning) and the start of a whole new Trek (no pun intended).

Another aspect that brings the point of this being both an ending and a new beginning is the score by Michael Giacchino. Star Trek has always been known for some nice film score and this film is no exception to the rule. The score is bombastic when it needs to be and personal when it needs to be. Giacchino also makes very sparing use of the classic Star Trek theme itself (something done wisely by David Arnold with the James Bond Theme in Casino Royale) until the end credits to let the audience know for certain that while things might have changed this is still Star Trek. It might be on the same level as the Goldsmith or Horner scores of previous films but this is still a Trek score and a fine one at that.

If this new Star Trek movie is any indication there's a life for this little TV series after all. With a fine cast, well designed sets, fantastic CGI work, well staged action, nice scripting and good music I can say one thing for certain. If this is the future of Star Trek then may this new Trek live long and prosper.",1256688000,4,6220,4.38008658008658
3472796,5,B001AVCFJM,"People are passionate about Star Trek, and in particular, Kirk and Spock. I get that. I feel it myself, being a fan of The Original Series since my childhood in the 70s (those of you ""in the know"" will realize that my screen name bears this out). When I first heard about this project, I reflexively felt that it was going to suck. I felt certain that it was unnecessary, unwise and above all, risky For J.J. Abrams in the extreme. My first thought that it might be something approaching tolerable did not come until I understood that Simon Pegg would be playing Mr. Scott, but even that little enthusiasm was dampened by learning that the original Mr. Spock was making an appearance (???). More and more it sounded like a jumbled mess made by a self-avowed non-fan.

And so it was with this preconception and a skeptical outlook that I went to see this movie when it came out. Imagine how stunned I was to learn that in fact, this is a gripping, loving re-imagining of the series that not only retains most of the important elements of the original, but actually improves upon and delves deeper than Star Trek has ever delved before, albeit in somewhat different directions than its creator would likely have gone. To those who say it is not faithful to Gene Roddenberry's vision, I have to say I agree. Unfortunately, I also have to say that when a movie gets made that is 100% faithful to Gene Roddenberry's vision, it ends up being Star Trek The Motion Picture. I therefore patently disagree with the outlook that Star Trek bereft of layers and layers of syrupy self-reflection is not Star Trek at all. Remember that Roddenberry absolutely HATED what they were doing with The Wrath of Khan, arguably the best picture in the series.

Well, it WAS arguably the best. Until now. I cannot praise the decisions made by Abrams and his crew enough in every single casting choice. These people could not possibly be better in their respective roles. They seem like a smart young bunch, and that being the case, I'll bet you dollars to donuts they were all, to one degree or another, scared to death of what they were doing. They had every reason to be. But they all pulled it off, to a man (and woman) - nailing the roles and yet each one making it their own. How they managed to do this must owe in great part to Abrams' skillful direction. When the man is tending something, it can be great - the worst Lost moments were when he was distracted, and Cloverfield, well... see what I mean? Chris Pine is to be commended most of all here, his brash portrayal of Kirk is exactly what the character needs... no DEMANDS... without even a HINT of a trace of being a parody of Shatner. I stand in awe of this feat.

I stand in awe of this movie. While some disappointing choices were made (I really didn't get the Big Planet Moment, it does kind of look a lot like a smack in the face to purists - and yes, Nero's motivation was weak) nothing can detract from the pure joy of having Star Trek back and on top of its game to the extent that this film has succeeded. In addition, the brilliance of the storyline that takes advantage of Nimoy to veer this series off into an alternate reality not bound to canon is absolutely spectacular. I never saw that coming and it is among the best ideas to be had here. To everyone who has complained that Abrams has turned Star Trek into Star Wars, I'd like you to take a moment to think a bit about that comparison. Star Wars, a franchise run by its creator, makes some prequels - how exactly did that turn out for you? Star Trek is the exact opposite. Its creator is no longer around to bore the socks off of everybody with his ""vision,"" and instead, younger, more creative minds have succeeded in making this series more relevant than ever. Cheers to J.J. Abrams. I hope he gets to make a bunch more of these movies.

Edit: And of course, I'm being downvoted, I can only assume because I am not being kind enough to the memory of the ""genius"" of Roddenberry. Whatever, I just tried to be honest. To those of you who value smart entertainment over slavish reverence, get this movie. You'll like it.",1256601600,4,4127,4.440633245382585

Well, for a start, He completely disregarded the canon of the original series; decided to film a script with so many plot and credibility holes that it could double as a hunk of Gorgonzola; and, by his own admission, embraced a film-making sensibility that was the polar opposite of the franchise concept in order to try and hook an audience that apparently suffers from attention deficit disorder and a low IQ.

Largely though, you can ascribe the failure of this film to a case of misguided intent and having the wrong director at the helm.

After all, when the first question on a director's mind when attempting to reboot ""Star Trek"" is ""what can we learn from Star Wars here?"" (as is established in a behind-the-scenes extra on the DVD) then you've pretty much instantaneously established that you've got the wrong man for the job.

""Star Trek"" is not ""Star Wars"". People do not want ""Star Trek"" to be ""Star Wars"". If they want to watch ""Star Wars"" then they can go and watch ""Star Wars"".

I could go into myriad incidental details about what is bad about this film - the nauseating product placement; the irritating ""camera flare"" lighting; a ""Death Star-esque"" planet killing Macguffin that looks like a giant ball of Edam; the fact that the deck of the ""Enterprise"" looks like the interior of an iphone shop and that the engine room looks like the floor of a brewery - but they are not really the problem.

The fundamental problem with this film is that, cosmetic similarities aside, it is not ""Star Trek"" in any way, shape or form.

Avoid this one like the plague.

3472799,4,B001AVCFJM,"As with the premier of all of the Star Trek movies I made a point to go see this one at the theater. I grew up watching the reruns with my father and still have not stopped. He is such a die hard fan of the original series that he never liked T.N.G. or any of the spin-offs It just wasn't the same without Kirk, Spock, and McCoy on the bridge to him.
I however have watched every episode from all of the spin-offs and enjoyed most of them. It was a bit strange seeing these new characters emerge and seeing Spock more emotional than I was used to. But I got past that right away. They did a very good job getting some of the characters persona's and adding a little twist to each of them, Like Uhura hating Kirk at first, Scotty was a little wilder,  The actor who played Chekov was trying a little too hard with the Russian accent, it didn't seem to flow like Walter koenig. Sulu wasn't bad and Karl Urban did a great impersonation of McCoy hating the transporter. The one scene where he kept injecting Kirk and making him sick was funny The special effect were terrific and I can't wait to see the movie on blue ray. The main thing I was not impressed with was the design of the Enterprise. It looked a little too much like a hot rod and not like a design you might find in the practical sense.  The original is Still my favorite, with NCC-1701A and E comming in as my next favorites. I never really liked enterprise D because I think the saucer section looked like a smashed pancake. Possibly a new series with this new crew might make it. We have been too long without a Star Trek series in prime time. If they come up with some good new material I think the movies and (If) a series might have a chance, But if they try to remake some of the old episodes they might be shooting themselves in the foot.
I hope in the upcoming sequel(s) if there are any, they follow Gene Roddenberry's morality lessons. he was way ahead of his time with every thing.

I was overall pleased with this remake, Too many times remakes seem to fall flat because we expect the new actors to emulate the originals and they can't be expected to do that. but sometimes they are better or just as good as their original counterparts.

If all else fails, just sit back and enjoy the alternate universe theme.",1256342400,2,2284,4.255760368663594

All I can say this movie was a blast to see in the Theater! I have never been a Star Trek fan, occasionally watched it, and some of the movies, never identified myself as a hardcore fans like others. I like JJ Abrams and was curious to see what he would bring to this new Star Trek. I was pleasantly surprised!

I just picked this up a few days ago, this movie is beautiful on the Flat screen, colors are so vibrant, the scenes on the Nero's ship, the blacks are dark, nice rich texture no ghosting, when the scenes are on the Command central on the Enterprise, everything is bright, very clear, just a very nice picture. Sound though did have to turn it up a notch to hear, bout a 25 or so on my Aquos where usually watching regular TV usually have it at a 13--- 15 for  normal sound range.
Over all a very nicely packaged DVD with lots of extras, definitely worth picking up.",1256169600,,1011,4.17948717948718

a) If you've never seen Star Trek, you get a first rate action adventure movie that stands alone as one of the best movies (if not the best) of 2009.

b) If you're a fan of Star Trek, you get so much more - so many tie ins to the mythology of Star Trek:
-How Captain Pike Got Hurt
-Why there are so few Vulcans
-How Kirk and Spock become great friends
-the Kobayashi Maru maneuver history
-Where Kirk found Scotty
-Where McCoy found Kirk
-How Uhura fits into the picture
-The wonderful interplay between Chekov and Sulu
-Sulu's samurai roots

It's all fantastic. The movie is fast paced, exciting, fresh, and has a wonderful comedic flair to it that just had me with a giant grin from ear to ear throughout the entire show.

This is now one of my favorite sci-fi movies. It wasn't campy and corny like the original series, the acting was great, and of course there are enough references to the old show for the true fan. I'll be buying this movie as soon as it comes out. You should too!",1256169600,2,591,4.230088495575221
3472803,4,B001AVCFJM,"I was there long ago when Star Trek was first broadcast, wow, the 60's. Loved Star Trek even since and knew that it is all to easy to criticize in a corporate capitalistic world in the US.

I was surprised that many elements were great in this movie. I did first go see it in IMAX. Hey are they selling IMAX home theater? Ok, get real.

Did I have some disappointments in this movie? Yes. Was I being a typical wonderful purist devoted to Star Trek? Yes.

OK confession done. In world that turns our media into success by $$$, JJ has done awesone. Already midnite showings of the IMAX return in my nearby but 50 mile drive city? Something was right, yet for the future I have my doubts people.

But what could have been disastrous as the *** terrible send off of Star Trek NG a titanic load of care was shown here to reboot. How can I complain about the efforts of the CGI amd more, other than the score was PREDICTABLE. My lowest point is the score but it wasn't bad to the point of taking away.

NOW. From a corporate profit viewpoint the allowance that our timelines can change is actually based on quantum physics, and that is not mainstream yet, but it is coming. It really is trekkies. It really is and there is a science undisclosed to that, there is.

Sci fi of the past 100 years was about the future. What if we learn we really can live one timeline and then live another. Hmm? Sci fi was about the impossible, it isn't sci fi because it is in space or whatever. Sci fi is based on what we think is impossible and today with quantum physics it is a known that simultanoues, parallel lives are absolutely possible.

SO, read it the way you will. OK reboot, new timelines this and that. OK reboot, what if they could make a change, is that possible. SCI FI IS NOT ABOUT LIMITATIONS.

Only true sci fi souls should judge because sci fi is about breaking down the status quo thought, and this film did that. NOW, can they follow up and continue to honor our beloved figures? Let's see. Well done. But expect bad reviews from those so stuck thinking the past is the past and the past is the past and that's that...they do not understand sci fi.",1256083200,2,2149,4.288888888888889

The worst part is that the main plot of the story (revenge for a lost love) is a complete rip off of the best Star Trek movie of all time ""The Wrath of Khan"". The disappointment and copout of the film is that the timeline is altered and yet we are suppose to believe that these characters will still serve together on the same ship and will be best friends forever!

I love Star Trek, i own all the seasons of every series on DVD, I like most of the movies but, if you're a fan of Star Trek save yourself the anger that this pile of crap will instill in you, and give it a miss.

What's wrong with it? I honestly don't know where to start... every single scene can be just picked apart and critcised endlessly. They took all existing mythology surrounding the series, everything that was coolo about Star Trek, and dumbed it down into a cutesy, pop-culture mess. From the fact that Spock is about 80 years old in the original series, yet looks as young as Kirk in thios movie (I guess Vulcans just suddenly age a lot between 65 and 80) to the fact that Spock is boning Uhuru, and has STRONG EMOTIONS about whether he should continue with their relationship or devote himself fully to Starfleet, to the fact that the Federation's Flagship gets it's ass kick by a danged mining vessel... J.J. Abrams should be hanged for producing this offense to Trek fans evertywhere.

And these are pretty harsh closing words for this review but, it has to be said... if you consider yourself s Star Trek fan and you actually liked this movie? You never understood Star Trek in the first place.

3472811,5,B001AVCFJM,"I had to be dragged into the room and threatened with being tied to the chair when we watched this movie.  I've hated Star Trek since I was a child - it was one of my father's obsessions and I was put off by his need to watch it over and over again, ad infinitum (especially when he decided to tell me what was about to happen several seconds before it did happen).  I thank goodness for the invention of the media player and the personal dvd player, which means that I don't have to inflict my obsessions on my family.

This film had action, romance (thankfully very limited), comedy, tension and more.

I was relieved to see that they had chosen new actors to play the roles.  James T Kirk (Chris Pine -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Princess-Diaries-2-Royal-Engagement-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B00063KGPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Princess Diaries 2 - Royal Engagement (Full Screen Edition)</a>) is, er, shall we say self-assured and brash.  After trying to pick up Uhura (Zoe Saldana) in a bar he is talked into joining star fleet academy (again) by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruse Greenwood).  On the transporter he meets a recently divorced, jaded and overly anxious Dr Leonard McCoy aka Bones (Karl Urban -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Truth-About-Demons/dp/B000A2X4D8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Truth About Demons</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-the-Blue/dp/B00151QYCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of the Blue</a>).

Three years later Bones is a changed man, much more relaxed, but, unfortunately, his friend Kirk isn't.  Spock (Zachary Quinto -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes-Season-One/dp/B000QDLSR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes - Season One</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-Season-Three/dp/B0002XVQSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24 - Season Three</a>) is at the academy too, but in a more senior position than Kirk.

After Starfleet intercepts a distress call and the fleet set off to help.  Kirk, having been ""grounded"" is smuggled aboard the Enterprise by McCoy.  On board the Enterprise we meet Sulu (John Cho) and teenage genius Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-Salvation-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B001FB55HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator Salvation (Widescreen Edition)</a>).

Guest appearances include Winona Ryder as Spock's mother, Ben Cross as Spock's father, and Leonard Nimoy as the older Spock.

The cast were outstanding.  I particularly enjoyed watching the start of the friendship between Kirk and Spock, as well as the friendship of Kirk and McCoy.  All the cast performed well - it was, however, unfortunate that we did not see more of Karl Urban's McCoy.

This film has converted me to Star Trek.  I am still not sure I would be able to watch the various series that were made, but I would certainly watch a sequel to this movie - providing they could get the same Enterprise cast back.  I would like to see more of McCoy and the others too.

I really wanted to dislike this film, I really did, but unfortunately I found I couldn't.  I never thought I would ever say this, but I really liked this Star Trek movie.",1255478400,2,3947,6.711198428290766

Things I wasn't too thrilled about:
- Over the top cheesy lines.  Although, in a way that fits with the original series.
- Same old same old of some random villain showing up trying to destroy everything.  I'd really like to see one or a series of movies that break out of this old mold.
- Same old same old of odd time-travel/time-space screwed up situations.  Since when did Star Trek decide to start making this a requirement for new content?

I remember coming out of the movie responding to someone who was asking me what I thought.  I said something like the action and visual effects were really good, but it didn't really impress me in any other way.  I'm part of ""The Next Generation"" (Along with DS9) group, so I prefer the ""smarter"" Star Trek that came out back then.",1255305600,12,900,4.385542168674699

The movie ended in its well rounded conclusion, and I was left on the edge of my seat thinking only, ""and what happens next?"" as I found myself impatiently waiting to see what the next adventure would be.  It's like Harry Potter fans who finish the book and can't think about much else except the next one they hope will be coming out.  Though some Star Trek fans do not like the changes made from the original series or movies, the creators of this version paid very due respect to the original and took it into a slightly alternate reality, one that I think fits current sensibilities much better than the earlier versions can now.

This is not a terrible movie.  It's not great, but it's not terrible.  The problem is it doesn't feel like Star Trek. Even when Trek was boring, it still had more brains than brawn. It was about how humans who were above petty bickering solved important problems. This movie misses the mark. It is all action and almost NO story, let alone an intelligent one.  When I heard about this film, I thought it would be redundant with the original series, but it's not even redundant.  It's just pointless.

If you have never been initiated into the world of Star Trek before, then by all means, see this movie. It's a spectacle of lights and sound, and that aspect of the production is great.  If you enjoy this movie, I suggest going to the source for a more edifying experience. The Original Series, The Next Generation, and Deep Space Nine are EXCELLENT series. This movie is best seen as an appetizer for the main course, and I hope that any future that Trek has on television does not derive from this movie, because it is quite a few rungs down from what we have already been given.",1255219200,103,1355,4.5473251028806585

3472816,5,B001AVCFJM,"Yes folks, you read that right I saw this movie 18 times in theaters and was completely blown away. I went to my first screening, not expecting much. Was I ever wrong. Although I am a Star Trek fan (my favorite is the original series) this film stands out because of its excellent writing, acting and directing. I tend to wait for DVD releases as many films are not as good as they should be, and I am so glad I saw this film in theaters. I salute the director and writers for making an exeptional film that both takes Star Trek in a bold new direction, yet remains true to the spirit of the original series.

The cast is not simply a group of beautiful faces, but a wonderful group of character actors whose talent really shines. Zachary Quinto as Spock is outstanding. His subtle nuances really show the Vulcan-Human relationship in ways the orginal series couldn't have imagined. I love the fact that Spock has a temper (no purging of emotions in Kohlinar). This makes for more interesting character development, note the exceptional scene when he finally loses his temper.  Chris Pine's interpretation of Kirk is also outstanding. He makes Kirk a likable human dynamo. You see Kirk's development in finding his destiny and root for him all the way. Karl Urban as McCoy is also incredible. I remember him from his portrayal of Cesar in the Xena and Hercules shows several years ago and he has McCoy's accent and wit down. The lovely Zoe Saldana brings wit, intelligence and a depth of emotion to Uhura. She gives as good as she gets, but still is caring and supportive of her chosen love interest. I won't spoil that one here, but I love the idea of the two of them together! It is a logical selection, I think. I love the fact that Sulu and Chekhov are also given vital roles that both actors handle beautifully. We get to see Sulu in action and his prowess in piloting after a funny first time. Chekhov gets to show his expertise and why he really belongs on the Enterprise. I also have to mention Bruce Greenwood as Captain Pike, I loved his character better than the one on the original series.

The special effects are also outstanding. Space is full of beautiful colors in this film. The whole look is different. I have several co-workers who are not Trek fans who saw this film more than once because it had  great story. I haven't been excited about a movie or seen one this often since the original Star Wars came out. I had Trek withdrawal after its run was over. I can't wait until it is out on DVD and Blu-Ray. Do yourself a favor, buy this film on DVD, a rental is not enough. Too many films are made with lots of special effects and not enough story (Transformers 2, I was expecting more and got less). Star Trek is not one of those. Outstanding film and my favorite of all time. Zachary and Chris are both gorgeous!",1255219200,5,2833,4.452793834296725
3472817,3,B001AVCFJM,"I have struggled with this film for a while and while I love to have Star Trek in any form; my ultimate and final evaluation of this film is: we did not get what we were promised.

For years leading to the release of Star Trek XI (Now conveniently rebadged Star Trek AR) we were told by Abrams and crew the focus here was to make a great film - more so than great Star Trek.  The intent was to make a ""realistic"" space epic and a great film.  In trying to do both it may have succeeded in wetting long time Trekker appetites for their film fix but a closer inspection shows a failure on both fronts.

The story was a contrivance of convenience and happenstance, where an untested and inexperienced command crew finds fleet's brand new flagship falling into their hands.  To me these occurrences are not very realistic - are they?  The film asks the viewer to suspend belief on two many different levels in order to make Star Trek happen.  While to my surprise the cast turned out to be best talent one could have hope for in a Star Trek reboot (even Peg and Urban pulled off their performances despite my early skepticisms), it is rather unbelievable how the story unfolds.  Preferred might have been a streamlined, allegorical, version introducing new (or previously unexplored) characters with the center formed around the big three - Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.  And, yes, perhaps they could have left the Enterprise out until the very end.

If they were truly making this movie for those who know Star Trek and those who are newcomers to the experience alike, why did the story have to be crammed with unsubstantiated character development?  Were they truly trying to make a great film or were they making a great cash cow? The motives are suspect; it comes to mind that Paramount never did have the great financial success with Star Trek that Star Wars brought to FOX; and here, I think we have an instance were maybe they have reached too far with the beloved icons from one legendary genre trying to bridge into another.  For me, this just did not work; maybe the next one will seem less contrived.

3472821,5,B001AVCFJM,"I was not a Trekkie, but after seeing J.J. Abrams version of Star Trek I am now.  I loved almost everything about this film.

Opening with James Kirk's birth and his subsequent rebellious boyhood and risk taking behavior, this new Star Trek has given James Kirk a cool new persona yet kept his boyish charm.  He is cocky to be sure but also smart and a great strategist.

Spock, played by Zachary Quinto, is just about perfect.  Again J.J. Abrams redefines a character but Spock never loses his Vulcan self.  Here Spock wrestles with his human side and it is almost startling how well Quinto portrays his human frailties, he is almost vulnerable.

Uhuru is lovely.  She is so much more than her original character, intelligent, spunky and forthright.  She is now  more than the girl who sits with a headset.

Bones is wonderful.  His witty comebacks had me smiling.  The rest of the Enterprise Crew, especially Sulu who has been given a bigger role, is also well cast.

The characters really drive this movie, although the story is good but at times a little bit confusing.  This movie takes off way before the crew begins its virgin voyage of the Enterprise.  The first twenty minutes are fast paced and set the scene for all the coming conflicts between characters.  Kirk and Spock are terrific together - Spock distrusts Jim and Jim finds Spock unreachable and stubborn.  We also see the beginnings of the deep friendship between Bones and Jim.

The story moves forward rapidly as the Enterprise is sent to Vulcan and must then deal with bad guy Eric Bana who has the ability to jump through time with his massive destructive ship.  Bana is a delight and his futuristic water boarding device is chilling.

Somehow Kirk and Spock have to overcome their differences and with a little help from the Enterprise crew and some sage advice from a time traveling character, Kirk is able to meet the challenge.

Finally, I want to cheer the score of this movie.  It was hard hitting where it was needed but the softness of the cello struck the right chord in the opening scenes especially.  I saw this movie twice and my teenaged daughter who had never seen a Star Trek episode or Star Trek movie walked out stating that it was an awesome movie.  I have to agree.",1254873600,3,2257,4.624685138539043

I am an occasional Trekkie - I used to sit in darkened rooms on sunny days watching taped US recordings (this was when I lived in NZ many years ago) - hard to describe the excitement of seeing DS 9 pilot episode months ahead of other Kiwis.

This movie an exciting take on the whole Star Trek franchise. JJ Abrams pays his respects to the original, but thankfully does not allow himself to be fettered by the original and has the vision to take a few daring steps and re-interpretations. Some of them are a bit confronting but in my opinion - as Spock might say: ""Intriguing"".

Die hard Trekkies (zealots?) may cry foul but I thought this was a great movie, super soundtracks, wonderful characterisations - Pine, Quinto put a new spring in the step of the James T Kirk and Mr Spock.

3472829,2,B001AVCFJM,"The key question for me is: if I had never heard of Star Trek, and this were the first movie I had ever seen featuring these characters and situations, would I be panting at the end for a sequel? Would I want to see these people again? The answer, alas, would have to be no. Director J.J. Abrams and company have mounted a fast-paced, entertaining space opera of a sort that seems to have been lacking from cinemas for years, and for that they deserve props. But the glib Kirk, glum Spock, xenophobic McCoy and manic Mr Scott portrayed here would never make me think these are beloved characters I'd want to see again and again. Where's the witty twinkle hidden behind Spock's logical superiority? Where's the real sense of bonding among these three leads? I even liked the idea of advancing Uhuru more overtly into a sex symbol in this movie, but she's played as being as cold and cerebral as Spock. There's just no warmth. Meanwhile, the Romulan villain played by Eric Bana ain't much more intriguing than the villain of Star Trek V, widely seen as the worst Star Trek film. And this new Star Trek movie makes a huge logical lapse at the end by allowing cadet Kirk to leapfrog directly from academy cadet to Enterprise captain, all without passing Go or spending any time moving up the ranks. By the end of the film, I was entertained, but hardly ready to boldy go anywhere else with this particular crew.",1254441600,27,1407,4.543307086614173
3472830,5,B001AVCFJM,"First off, I have never seen a Star trek movie in my life before nor have I seen any of the TV series. I'm a little bit familiar with the characters simply because being Star Trek the huge phenomenon that has always been, something has to rub on you.

Now, as a complete outsider to Star Trek, I found this movie fascinating. J.J. Abrahams is a genius. The movie was simply perfect film-making. Just perfect. It's the small details that make a movie. And Abrahams nailed every single one of them.

POSSIBLE CAMEO SPOILER ...................

I think Leonard Nemoy's appearance and performance were incredible. I was also very impressed with Zachary Quinto as Spock. (he plays Sylar in heroes). His role was definitely one of the most difficult. He had to portray a guy who can not show emotion but he still had to get his message across in every scene. Difficult. But he pulled it off.

I'm definitely adding this movie to my blu-ray collection.",1254355200,,945,4.674698795180723

3472833,1,B001AVCFJM,"This glossy oilslick of a movie should really by titled Abrams Trek Wars as it's really a Star Wars ripoff using Star Trek characters.  JJ Abrams is on public record as saying he never liked Star Trek nor did he understand it and it shows in every cel of this film.  Maybe if he and his writers had done their research and read about the Star Trek backstory, they could have made a watchable film.  Instead, they tossed 40 years of other people's hard work out the window so they could invent their own alternate Star Trek reality where they could make up anything that they wanted even if it doesn't make any sense.  The film makers said before it was released that this movie was based on Star Trek canon but that's not true.  Almost none of it is canon.

What we get in the finished product is a two-hour long Special Effect held together by flimsy attempts at a plot involving tired sci-fi cliches that have been stolen from other Abrams projects: time travel (Lost), alternate reality (Fringe), and a magical, unexplained object, Red Matter (Rambaldi artifact from Alias).  The basic premise has been stolen from Star Wars A New Hope:  Romulan Nero is Grand Moff Tarkin, his ship the Narada is the Death Star, Old Spock is Princess Leia, and the destruction of Vulcan is the destruction of Alderaan.  Other sources ripped off for this film:  An Officer and a Gentleman, Aeon Flux, Sky High, The Black Hole, Battlestar Galactica, Stargate, etc.

Clearly, Abrams and co. spent way too much time on how this movie should look, and not nearly enough time on crafting a good story with good characters and development.  All the writers did was lift some familiar lines and icons from previous Star Trek incarnations as well as other sci fi classics, and stitch them together haphazardly hoping that would be enough to satisfy the audience.  There are pretty costumes that belong on a fashion runway, not a working military, and an Enterprise that looks like it starred in an episode of Pimp My Ride.  The actors were hired for their looks, not any acting ability they might have.  The action sequences are boring, poorly choreographed, and poorly shot, and repetitive.  Kirk hanging off the edge of a cliff or similar high ledge while a villain looms over him is repeated 3 times!

As for Kirk himself, who's supposed to be the hero of this film, he comes across as a drunken cheating loser who tags along for the adventure, loses every fight he's in, makes no command decisions, does what other people tell him, and yet he's the only character at the end who gets rewarded for saving the day.  He's a poor role model compared to the original Kirk who was strong, smart, confident, and earned his position as Captain by working hard through all the ranks of Starfleet and proving he deserved his position.

In the end, JJ Abrams has made a mediocre film that's unimaginative, uninspired, and ultimately empty.  There's no sense of wonder and not an ounce of Gene Roddenberry's vision anywhere in it.  The lack of care put into making this film shows Abrams' disdain for Star Trek, sci fi in general, and his audience.  It was made for reasons of money and ego, and that makes it what is known as an exploitation film.",1254182400,16,3217,4.63668430335097
3472834,5,B001AVCFJM,"The rebirth of Star Trek has been long anticipated by fans, and the latest movie is not a sorrowful let down.  The movie is awesome and keeps the action and suspension moving through out.  It also delves into the backgrounds of Kirk and Spock's upbringing; which reveals much about their characters and who they are and who they become.  The story veers from the original Gene Rodenberry version by the fact that at the very begging of the story a future Romulan by the name of Nero arrives in federation space by a black hole; in a massive ship with weapons that far exceeds the Federations of the day.  Kirks father is one of the early casualties; which changes the course of history for the hero's.
 After the heroic death of Kirks father we watch as both Kirk and Spock grow of age and key events that give us insight into their characters.  Spock being the half human half Vulcan misfit doesn't fit into his culture and is often insulted not only by the young but also by the elders of his culture which help him determine his fate to be the first Vulcan to join star fleet academy.  Kirk on the other hand is a lost soul with no direction or path in his life.  That is until a bar fight with some star fleet academy students bring him into contact with Christopher Pike.  Pike becomes the sort of guiding Father figure Kirk needs to get his life in focus and Kirk decides to enlist into Star fleet.  Kirk meets members of his crew along the way including several volatile encounters with Spock.  The action of the movie heats up as Nero, who has been hiding and planning for almost twenty years comes out of hiding and enacts his vengeance on the one man he blames responsible for what happens to his world in the future, Spock.
 Captain Pike is captured during their first encounter with Nero and Kirk and Spock often at odds with each other must find a way to work together in order to save the federation.  This is a must see for any fans of the show.",1254182400,3,1960,4.3812154696132595

3472837,5,B001AVCFJM,"9/8/66.  It's a badge that Original Trekkers wear proudly -- the date that the very first Star Trek episode (""The Man Eater"") appeared on television.  I bear it, and Star Trek hooked me that very Thursday evening, and for the next three years, I sat through all 69 episodes, both the best (""Oh Boy! The Trouble with Tribbles"") and the worse  (""Oh, no! Not that one!""). When they began to appear in syndication, I watched them over and over until I could repeat the lines with the characters.  And, no, I'm not going to tell you who my favorite character was.

It's been 43 years since that first episode.  I'm still hooked.

A lot of my compatriots have said that J.J. Adams' ""reboot"" of the Star Trek franchise went too far -- they weren't ready for some of the things that happened (and, for the sake of those readers who have not seen the movie, I'm not going to reveal what those things are).  They didn't like the changes in the mythos that occurred.  OK, fine.  Different strokes ...

I, however, love this film, and would have gone to see it over and over again if it hadn't been that my darling didn't really want to (and our budget didn't allow it).  So what if things changed?  It's an alternate universe -- and any Trekker worth her salt will recognize those occur -- Remember ""Mirror, Mirror?"" A planet blows up, and I admit, given the planet, I'm pretty sad (no, it's not Earth).  I'm also sad that Scottie used Admiral Archer's favorite beagle for an experiment, and it hasn't been seen since (Okay, so one slipped out).

However, the most powerful ideas and characters remain true to their alternate others:  Kirk is strong, handsome, creative in a crisis (and may be a womanizer, although he doesn't get the woman he wants here), even if he's not William Shatner.  Spock struggles to keep his emotions in check and his logic foremost (tremendously well-played by Zachary Quinto).  ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban, unexpectedly unlike many of his fantasy and SF rolls)is humane, funny, and passionate -- and a lot better looking than the well-beloved, late DeForest Kelley. Bruce Greenwood (""The Core""), Simon Pegg, Ben Cross (superb as Sarak) and Winona Ryder (Amanda! And I am getting to be too old) are all wonderful, and add strength, passion and substance to both their characters and the film.  It was, however, sad to see Leonard Nimoy, as ""our"" Mr./Abassador Spock, late in his life, and know we probably never see him in another Star Trek film.

So.  Buy it?  Damn straight.  Get it for your children and yourselves.

Star Trek would have never died for me, anyway, because I've dreamed of walking on another planet ever since I saw that first episode.  But now, Star Trek will come alive for a fourth generation to learn those same dreams.",1253923200,441,2758,4.6604554865424435

This is terrific film where everything is simply great: screenplay, dialogs, casting, direction, special effects, cinematography, music, action sequences, jokes, performances, direction, etc, etc, etc... I simply cannot find a flaw in this film that is worth noting.

More than a Summer blockbuster, STAR TREK is a quality blockbuster made with lots of care and love.

Some die hard fans were quick to note all the divergences from the original source. But, hey... this is NOT the original thing. It is reinvention that manages to keep all the fundamental elements that work while giving itself the freedom to breath some fresh ideas that ALSO work. So in my opinion, this film has lots of respect for all the audiences that are targeted here: old fans and new ones.

Basically, the film tells the story of how all the Enterprise crew members met (Kirk, Spock, Uhura, McCoy, Scottie, Sulu and Chekov) upon the backdrop of two main narrative drives: personal (how the clashes between Kirk and Spock shaped their friendship) and plot (they must prevent a mad Romulan who came from the future from destroying the Earth). Obviously, the actual story has many twists that I do not want to spoil...

So I think this is a beautiful film that deserves to be seen. One last note: all the actors are fine. In fact, this is one of those projects where everybody seems to be loving what they're doing.

Favorite lines:
KIRK ""You know, traveling through time, changing history... that's cheating.""
SPOCK ""A trick I learned from an old friend.""

SAREK ""Speak your mind, Spock.""

3472844,2,B001AVCFJM,"I travelled from my galaxy to the realm of the movie theater to view Star Trek on Tuesday, September 15, 2009.  I have been mezmerised with the original series since it first ran so many years ago.  I give thanks to Desilu for backing such a risky venture.  The original characters caught my attention early on and I truly enjoyed the series on television.  i own the series and the movies with the original actors.

Early on the attempt to bring about the history of the characters you see a young James Kirk growing up in the farm lands.  That is realistic since Kirk came from Ft. Wayne.  However, the next you see is Kirk driving an antique vehicle at top speed toward a cliff and subsequently the vehicle drops over the cliff.  This is not acceptable.  Kirk's affinity for antiques would have never permitted this to happen, no matter how young he was.  When the officer asked his name, the reply, ""James Tiberius Kirk"" would not have happened.  Kirk did not offer his middle name, just the initial.

The new character of Kirk lost me because he was so very belligerent.  Kirk was highly stuck on himself originally, but he never would have acted so arrogantly in his youth.  I feel the original Kirk would have demonstrated from early on his one-eyed direction to join Star Fleet to the exclusion of everything else.

The character of Spock was not done well.  Any Vulcan that had reached the acceptance to the steps of Kolinar would have control of their emotions.  Every step Spock took in the movie was laced with emotion.  Uhura?  No.  She was provacative but never one to chase Spock early on.  She would not have been demonstrative to demand assignment to Enterprise.  She may not have liked going to the Faragut, but she would have resigned herself to the task.  I feel this could have been handled more prodigiously.

I feel the character of Doctor McCoy was spot on.  I give this character and the actor portraying the doctor five stars.  His usage of spicy language was perfect with the mindset of the original.  What can I say about Scotty?  This is a fit made in hell, not heaven.  This portrayal was not acceptable at all.  Scotty was way serious at all times with his engineering duties and studies.  Yes, he did drink but not to excess like this character was made to look.  He was not a bumbler.

The characters of Sulu and Chekov were not fleshed out enough for me.  Chekov did most of the thinking and put his brain to good use.  However, this would not have happened with the original character.

Have I left anyone out?  As you can guess, I did not enjoy the movie, in fact, I fell asleep during parts of the effects.  I know you cannot find perfection later in life, but could some of the plots and reactions have been more to the original?  Movies work on compression of life and the characters must start fast and end even faster to create the effect you want to see.  But I felt rushed and did not like it.

I gave the movie two stars simply from a nostalgic point of view, however, I will watch for future reviews of this first attempt to relive the early stages of the film and carefully consider the future installments.",1253404800,12,3153,4.490299823633157

3472846,5,B001AVCFJM,"This film goes so very far towards putting *fun* and humor and humanity and wonder back into the series.  Everything Abrams touches turns to gold.  The original trek was all about **adventure**.  Sure, I loved TNG like everybody else, but somewhere between Picard rhapsodizing about English drama and literature and Janeway's wearing wooden knickers all of Trek turned stale.  I'm not even sure if Riker had flexible knees -- that's how static and inflexible the acting and the action became.

I liked the original movies.  Except, somehow, everyone inovlved in them became batseething crazy.  Just, crazy. Did you see Star Trek V: The Final Frontier? What the hell was that about? Great -- Shatner wants to direct. They never let Mr. T direct on the A-Team. There's a lesson to be had there.

The TNG movies were also unpredictable. I liked the last one, but I've seen episodes of Webster that were more riveting than Insurrection. Webster in Spanish. On Betamax.

This movie is fun.  Short skirts are back -- and not on dudes. Stuff explodes. Space karate is had. And it's still smart and moving and meaningful.

And just think about how awesome its going to be now that all the introductions have been made.

If you're all sloshy and bothered by the new vision, please just consider that its all in an alternate timeline. If that doesn't work, well -- hmm.  Maybe Trek isn't for you anymore. Maybe you've just lost touch with quality pop culture. Maybe you don't remember Sulu running around with that sword.  Fencing, dude.  He's into fencing.

3472848,5,B001AVCFJM,"In order to get big rewards in life you have to take big risks. If there is one thing that the Star Trek universe hasn't done in 20-25 years its take risks. The franchise has suffered greatly for it, continuing to follow a formulaic approach that has made the franchise stale, predictable, and for quite a while... DEAD. Not sick, not on life support, but D-E-A-D.

Those days are over.

The 11th feature presentation is quite simply the first GREAT Star Trek movie ever made. While others in the series have been enjoyable, there was no definitive movie that stood out, nothing that could be pointed to as something unique, something special, something that takes RISKS.

What you get here is the biggest risk that has ever been taken in the Star Trek universe in its 40+ years of existence.

I will not ruin this risk but if you are a fan of the movies at all you will know it when you see it. Being a long time fan of Star Trek (I am a Next Generation first and foremost) and having seen the trailer numerous times I figured out what was going to happen about 20 minutes before it did but that didn't stop the shock when I witnessed this awesome writing decision played out on the big screen. The strongest of Star Trek lovers (especially TOS people) will no doubt have a lot of outrage at this risk but it was the right move to make. The Star Trek franchise needed to be shaken up, it needed something fresh and it needed a movie to shock and awe the audience.

Man did it ever deliver.

This movie is an absolute JOY to experience. Spock was always my favorite TOS personality as he probably was for most fans, but I never felt the connection to this cast that I did to Picard, Data, Worf and the Next Gen cast so I really didn't care what changes they made (and there is another major change that involves 2 characters that you never have experienced before in TOS history) if they were for the better. In all cases these were for the better and executed with near-perfection by JJ Abrams (who might later be revered on the same level as Gene Rodenberry if this re-visioning [this is much more than a simple reboot] succeeds like I think it will).

Since I don't like getting too deep into spoilers with reviews instead of focusing on the story (try your best to stay ignorant as possible of the story so its fresher when you see the film) I will instead focus on the characters we know so well (and some we don't).

True To The Character We Know

Spock (played by Zachary Quinto) - Even though Kirk (ahhem William Shatner) was advertised as the lead of TOS, the real centerpiece was Spock. The work here by Quinto is beyond exceptional and complements the amazing work done by Leonard Nimoy the past 40 years. Quinto plays the character as well as you could imagine and the real special thing in this movie is that finally (FINALLY) the half human side of Spock is heavily examined. It is a major part of the movie and no doubt will continue to be focused on in future films. Spock is no more or less important to the crew and story as he always has been. Other actors could do lesser work (they didn't) but the movie franchise will only succeed as well as Quinto acts. The character is in the best of hands.

Bones (played by Karl Urban) - The gem of the entire movie without question. Karl Urban takes the difficult role of playing not only Bones but Bones played by DeForest Kelley and is he ever amazing. It's a complete joy to watch his character on the screen. Urban doesn't need to do anything different in future films. You can tell how hard he worked to keep the Bones character as he has always been and he hits a home run out of the park. Wonderful wonderful wonderful

Scotty (played by Simon Pegg) - We don't meet Scotty until far into the movie but Pegg does a great job doing James Doohan. Since Scotty was always kind of the ""middle"" character on the show where he wasn't wasted but wasn't the tops (Spock, Kirk, Bones) all Pegg had to do was do a good Scotty and hopefully the script-writers would give him more to do. This is the case here.

Revisions And Improvements Made

Kirk (played by Chris Pine) - No longer do we get the ultra womanizing, overacting of Kirk/William Shatner but we get instead a focus on the risk-taking side of Kirk and this is the Kirk that I could truly learn to love. Over and over again we see why Kirk in Star Trek canon is revered so much and his take no prisoners approach is put on the front burner all throughout this film. Pine is confident and does a fantastic job. I don't care how revered Shatner is, the writers got it right with this re-visioning of Kirk and it's thumbs up all the way.

Sulu (played by John Cho) - Not much to say here. Cho was fine but nothing amazing in his performance. Sulu fights a little bit but hopefully more focus can be made on him in the future, no problems here but nothing jumps out.

Uhura (played by Zoe Saldana) - As a communications officer her role is MUCH better in this re-visioning. She is given more intelligent input by the script-writers but the one major canon change of Uhura (which I can't go into detail in this review) I am still trying to determine how I feel about. Her mod is the 2nd biggest risk/mod taken in the movie.

Complete Rewrite

Chekov (played by Anton Yeltin) - Except for being Russian and making fun of his thick accent this is a completely new character and man was this a serious improvement. Instead of the bumbling doofus that really doesn't do anything now Chekov is a ultra-young uber-intelligent officer that plays pivotal parts in the movie. Yes this was a serious canon change but I can't imagine how any fan wouldn't approve because now you have a real character you can be emotionally attached to.

New Characters

Nero (played by Eric Bana) - Bana instantly becomes one of the main villains in Star Trek lore and in my opinion because of events in the movie he now becomes THE single villain in Star Trek history. I wish Nero could have been on the screen more but with only 2 hours and so many people to get on the screen I think the right balance was struck.

Old Friends

XXX - You will know who this is when you see them. I have no complaints other than one voice-over part where the narration seems a bit droll and uninspired but I also think this is because of the circumstance how they are speaking. This old friend was a +++ to the movie and not just a ploy to get people in the seats. A welcome addition to the movie and plot.

Intangibles

Bridge - The new bridge is the most gorgeous bridge you will ever see. Some say it looks 'too sexy' or 'too bright' but THIS is how the bridge should have always looked. Please please please don't change it for the future films. You have already achieved the perfect look.

Score - The one downside of the movie. The 3rd trailer featured some of the most gorgeous background score ever and my hopes were very high. The score that is featured in the movie is serviceable but doesn't inspire. I was disappointed with the end result. It's alright but it could have been so much more.

IMO 'Star Trek' achieves what only 1 Star Trek movie (IV - The Voyage Home) came close to doing and that is being a successful film to the general public, not just Star Trek fans in general. This is the quickest 2 hours you will spend this summer and an absolute joy. I can see several movies being made with this cast and I hope several are made. The events of this film make for a realistic approach to the original cast working anew in these new revisions. As the movie ended I wished I could move ahead 2-3 years in time to see the next chapter and the next and the next.

Everyone likes to rank the movies in order and I knew 1 hour in this was EASILY (note I don't even flinch when I say EASILY EASILY EASILY) the greatest Star Trek movie ever made. You know a movie succeeds when a character or a movie itself feels like candy for the brain (last year Heath Ledgers Joker was the ultimate 'candy') and this is some yummy candy.

If you are a Star Trek fan go see it and try to have an open mind for what you will see. Many will be fine with the changes made. For the ones that aren't would you rather have changes and new Star Trek movies or the same old same old that had ruined the franchise for so long (kudos to Rick Berman as the official murderer of ST)??? If you are just a person that loves movies you (yes YOU) can even enjoy Star Trek as this movie has been produced not just for the Trekkie but the every day Joe and Jane.

The franchise has suffered greatly for it, continuing to follow a formulaic approach that has made the franchise stale, predictable, and for quite a while... DEAD. Not sick, not on life support, but D-E-A-D.

Those days are over.

The 11th feature presentation is quite simply the first GREAT Star Trek movie ever made. While others in the series have been enjoyable, there was no definitive movie that stood out, nothing that could be pointed to as something unique, something special, something that takes RISKS.

What you get here is the biggest risk that has ever been taken in the Star Trek universe in its 40+ years of existence.

I will not ruin this risk but if you are a fan of the movies at all you will know it when you see it. Being a long time fan of Star Trek (I am a Next Generation first and foremost) and having seen the trailer numerous times I figured out what was going to happen about 20 minutes before it did but that didn't stop the shock when I witnessed this awesome writing decision played out on the big screen. The strongest of Star Trek lovers (especially TOS people) will no doubt have a lot of outrage at this risk but it was the right move to make. The Star Trek franchise needed to be shaken up, it needed something fresh and it needed a movie to shock and awe the audience.

Man did it ever deliver.

This movie is an absolute JOY to experience.

3472850,3,B001AVCFJM,"Is it possible to be entertained by a movie and dislike it at the same time? This is the paradox I face immediately after watching the re-telling of ""Star Trek"". I know I will be accused of being a curmudgeonly Trekkie who is afraid of change, but I would dispute that. There are definitely some things to like about this movie. The casting, which is the key to doing an origin movie of a long-loved franchise series, was excellent. Pine and Quinto were wonderful choices; Zoe Saldana shines as Uhura. The main characters for the most part were interesting, compelling and well written. Kirk was believable as the brash young rebel, Spock intriguing as the young man caught between two diametrically opposed cultures, fighting to find his own identity.  The only character from the original crew I didn't completely buy into was Scotty, and perhaps I would have had he been introduced earlier in the film and had more of a part rather than being thrown in towards the end. The fact that Chekov was a 17 year-old lieutenant piloting the Federation's premier flagship was a little more than unbelievable, but I didn't mind his youthful, somewhat misdirected eagerness as much as a few did. Sulu didn't have much of a part, perhaps his character will be explored more in coming films. Bones has none of his down-home charm or Southern accent, which added to his character in the series, and you really don't get a good feel for why he and Jim are friends, you just go with it. But you enjoy watching these people, you find you eagerly await the next tidbit in their character development (although Spock's love story leaves a lot of questions.) You love seeing the characters you've grown up with, known and loved over the years meet and interact for the first times.

The fact that the movie got these important elements right gives those at the helm of this production no excuse for getting the rest so wrong. The plot is an absolute Swiss cheese sliced mess, weak and full of holes. The way the crew was thrown together was too much of a contrivance. The villain, a crucial element in any drama, is vastly underwritten and hardly seems a worthy adversary to the Federation or our heroes. While you are told why he is undertaking his vendetta against the Federation, you get absolutely no insight into his personality that would provide even the smallest of clues as to what would drive him to such extremes or how he could maintain such a cult of personality over his crew that they would follow him without question on his murderous crusade. Eric Bana is completely wasted in this role. Apparently he was so thrilled to get the part of the villain in the new mega-Trek film that he forgot to read the script. Either that or he just wanted to cash a check; the part wasn't worth his time. Nero, a Romulan, isn't even a military leader, he's an industrial miner on a rogue mission of revenge not endorsed or even known by the Romulan government. Perhaps the writers thought some of the magic of Khan's one-man revenge plot in Wrath of Khan would rub off on their effort; the allusion to Khan is made blatantly obvious when Nero puts the same brain-burrowing bug in Captain Pike's head as Khan did to Chekov to gain information on Genesis Project in ""Wrath"". The storyline that worked so well in the second Star Trek movie, however, did not pan out in this one.

While moviegoers often have to check their credulity at the door, the film too often crosses the line of believability. How Nero's planet-killing weapon is ultimately defeated is so simplistic it makes you wonder why Captain Pike ordered Kirk and Sulu's hair-raising (failed) attempt at it in the first place. A few well-placed tracer rounds from a one-man craft were all that were needed. When Nero's ship threatens Earth, most of the fleet is conveniently off in some other part of the galaxy so the cadets of Star Fleet Academy are rushed to confront it. Just lucky for us Star Fleet had another fully-armed and ready fleet of ships, sitting around doing nothing, including its top-of-the-line ship Enterprise. How a Romulan miner obtained the ability to destroy planets must have just gone over my head; considering how dull and vapid the Nero character was, perhaps I dozed for a second and missed it. And neither Vulcan nor Earth had any secondary line of defense to repel Nero; once the fleet was destroyed, Earth was just a sitting duck.

When Spock accuses Kirk of mutiny he shoots him off the ship in an escape pod near a Federation outpost on a planet near Vulcan. When attacked by a large native-dwelling creature (that looked suspiciously a lot like one of the creatures from the execution/Jedi showdown scene in Attack of the Clones) he just happens to find refuge in a cave inhabited by a character familiar to all Trek fans who rescues him, explains who Nero is and why he's on the rampage, and tells him what to do next. On the whole planet, Kirk stumbles into that one cave. Just lucky, huh? At the end of the film, Kirk, due to his heroics, is vaulted from a disgraced cadet on suspension to Captain of the best ship in the fleet. Besides the fact that no military organization worth its salt would place an unseasoned albeit valorous tyro in such an important position, passing over vets who've proven themselves through years of service, if you thought the Shatner Kirk was brash and impulsive, consider how spoiled and reckless this Kirk will be without the seasoning and experience gained through climbing up the ladder from the bottom. It takes more than heroics to command, it takes experience and temperament, which the new Kirk has as yet shown none of. Such examples are littered throughout the movie and just push believability too far.

Another problem with the movie is that it doesn't just reinvent the origins of Star Trek as we know from the get-go and go with it, it actually reinvents the origins while the movie is playing. It accomplishes this through the time-tested (or is that time-worn) device of time travel. While many of the best Trek stories have involved time travel, they've gone to the well with this so many times they may have just made one trip too many. The changes are so drastic, such as to the status of the Vulcans in the Federation that I thought during the movie that they would have to make another movie just to go back in time and fix everything. Upon reflection, I don't think they will, as that will alienate the brand new fans and make the old-timers accuse them of a cop-out. It makes one wonder whether the producers and writers had any idea of where to take things in future movies; if they did have an idea, it makes one shudder to think where they will actually go with it.

My advice is, go see this movie and enjoy it for all of its good qualities and fun. If you are new to Trekdom, you'll enjoy the humor, the characters and the fast-paced action. If you are a Trek veteran, you'll be giddy seeing the old crew come together and establish relationships for the first time. But don't be surprised if after you leave the theater or hit the stop button on your remote you scratch your head and wonder why you actually liked it. It's a `cotton-candy' movie-tastes good, but not very filling. To me, it's nothing more than a summer romance. It feels great while it lasts, but there's just not enough there for a meaningful relationship.",1252713600,6,7366,4.631981637337414
3472851,3,B001AVCFJM,"It was a day in 1973. Richard Nixon was in office and things were so bad outside, just on the other side of the window's glass, the stink of a filthy city, the stink of a rotting Capitol, and the stench wafting from the corpse of the American Dream like it was in the dumpster just down the fire escape around the corner in the back alley. We were naive enough to think that it couldn't possibly get any worse than that. No, we hadn't envisioned the horror of the Bush years, or the second set of Bush years for that matter, and had no idea that our coughing, hacking rusty Chevrolets and Fords that were choking up the blue skies into gray ones would in a matter of decades bring global doom down upon our children long before they would die. Who knew that our wretched, beautiful empire could so quickly snuff out an entire planet?

No, it was a time both cynical and naive. I remember turning the television dial on only to hear a horrible screeching sound, the kind of noise a baboon might might emit in an act of auto-erotic asphyxiation. I slapped the side of that faux wooden electric box and screamed something in French as I had been forced into a month long deep-immersion language program in service of the government. I was to be shipped off sometime in the next three to four weeks to be the interim United States Ambassador to French Polynesia. It was to be a short term posting, all due to the fall out of that miserable bastard Spiro Agnew. The attorney general at that time was a good friend of mine and a sworn enemy of Agnew and all his cronies. Ah, my good friend Ray Kroc. He made one hell of an A.G. and screwed that dirty bastard and his friends right good, right into prison or exile. Say what you will about his hamburgers, and his bizarrely prescient but crippling fear of disease that he swore up and down would one day be spread across the globe by swine and fowl. (Why do you think McDonald's waited until after his death in 1984 to introduce the McRib sandwich?) But Ray Kroc was one grand old devil of an attorney general when he marched through this nation's legislative halls. You can almost hear his footsteps echoing now... But that's a story for another time.

The heart of the matter is that I hadn't spoken a word of English in nearly two weeks, only French, and that I had only learned a total of about sixty words, all of them related to my love of cheap women, and even cheaper booze, as well as half a dozen swears, none of which I can repeat here. (I'm not missing the pun, just choosing to ignore it.) I couldn't get the television to work no matter what words I screamed at it while waving my arms wildly. In the 70's we all believed that shouting at the TV would help make it work better, sort of encourage the bizarre device to do well, much like how people today shout at the TV thinking that it will suddenly make politicians and pundits drop their ridiculous, phony right-wing/left-wing act and just admit that they're all suckling from the same corporate teats. I called the repair-man, but this being Los Angeles, he couldn't understand any of the French-Polynesian slang that I was limited to use by federal mandate in order to get my ambassadorial post on those balmy coasts approved. I had to assume that my phone was tapped, and couldn't take the risk of violating my federal employment terms. I needed the money, the power, the prestige, that comes with being a U.S. Ambassador to a small island in the Pacific Ocean. Fortunately, though, he knew Spanish, and you would be surprised how similar Tijuana slang is to French-Polynesian. Unfortunately, though, the only questions I knew how to say involved ""scoring"" and inviting him up to my hotel room. I don't know much Spanish, but homophobic rage is an international language. I slammed down the receiver and checked the dead bolt on my door for fear that this angry and violent man might find out where I live.

The fear began to set in, which is bad, very bad. I had just taken two hits of some 12 hour medicine to calm my nerves, but this kind of confrontation could send me down a terrible and disturbing road. That's when the TV came back on, as if my earlier shouting and flailing had finally convinced it, had willed it, to behave like a normal television should. I nodded my head and thought: That's proper. I lit an herbal cigarette, sat down, and stared at the screen.

It was amazing. Life-changing. Life-affirming. Could this television show possibly wash away all the grime left by the '72 race? Would it keep me calm and set me down the right road for the next twelve hours? And who is that in my kitchen? Is there someone behind my refrigerator? Not possible... There could only be an inch, an inch and a half at most, between the ice box and the wall. But how was that shadow moving? Not my concern. Just look away and ignore it. Just look away. It's just me and this television show in here: ""The Twilight Zone.""

""The Twilight Zone?"" Had ""Star Trek"" really ended that quickly? I checked the window; it was night, and there was definitely someone in my kitchen now. Someone was sitting beside me on the couch offering me something that I really didn't want. I could smell bacon and completely understood my good pal Ray Kroc's fear of swine and birds, why just the sound of a pigeon flapping its wings outside his thirtieth floor office building window could make this lion of man cower under his desk all night long clutching a flash light between his legs to keep the diseases at bay. That was how he met his seventh wife. She was a night maid who coaxed him out from under there with the business end of a broom. Sweet woman. Had the most fantastic mustache. Came up with the fish-o-filet sandwich and later was a key witness at the Watergate hearings. You should have seen them together in the court room. You should have seen them together in the bathroom. Why were they in my bathroom?

That best sums up my feelings about this unreleased product. I saw that there were 58 other reviews of this three-disc Blu-Ray product, and I know that I have just as much experience watching this Hi-Def Blu-Ray release which won't be released for another two months as every other reviewer here. Sure I saw this movie in the theater, but that has no REAL meaning when related to this product because I have no idea how good the audio and video transfers are. I have no idea whether or not the extras make this a five star product or one star product. I have no idea if it's over-priced and undervalued.

And no one else does either. They have no idea what they're talking about because these discs haven't even been pressed yet. They haven't even finished editing the menu titles so that they can burn the discs. They don't know what they're talking about, but me? I won't pretend to know something I haven't yet had my hands on, haven't yet experienced. That's a fool's game.

But in 1973, on that insane afternoon, I was there. I did experience that. So did Agnew, and so did Kroc. He was dragging Agnew out of the Capitol Building by the crotch of his pants, the evil schlub bawling the whole time, blubbering on and on with one lame excuse after another about mixing up his tax checks with his bribe checks and his aspirin with his Ibogaine. We were there. Where were you?",1252713600,3,7295,4.4591760299625465
3472852,5,B001AVCFJM,"A prequel that was well cast, well filmed, well done all around!  I was grew up with Star Trek and all of the subsequent spin-offs and was skeptical after being dissapointed in ""Enterprise"" (which they did NOT get right).  From the sweeping and uplifting musical score that gives honor to the theme song we all know, to the accurate characterizations of the younger versions of the classic heroes, you leave the movie ready for the next one.  While no movie is perfect, this was one that came very close to it - not only did the actors have their characters on target, but the Gene Roddenberry concept of a future for mankind that was not dark and bleak with polluted air and acid rain; but one where mankind's future was positive and good; where the possibilities out-weighed the problems.  This movie was also FUN - something that a lot of movies have lost.  Most are trying to send a message or make a statement but it was good watch a fun movie...to escape to a place where ""ones had gone before"" and it was still good.

3472853,4,B001AVCFJM,"I went to the theatre to see this movie only because a friend wanted me to go with them.  I've always enjoyed Star Trek (and the subsequent series and movies), but I have to admit that the idea of ""going back to the beginning""  - with a completely new cast - had me skeptical, especially in this day and age when remakes and sequels seem to be a substitute for originality and creativity.  After seeing the movie, I was pleasantly surprised.  While this new movie is very different from what Star Trek fans are used to, it is a great reinvention of the classic series.

One of the strong points of the movie is the acting.  Chris Pine plays the role of Kirk with some of the personality of a young William Shatner, but he adds his own spark to the character as well.  I was also impressed by Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban in their respective roles as Spock and McCoy.

The cinematography of the film is generally good, although it does have some weaknesses.  One weak point I noticed was during the fight scenes (the camera is in so close and cuts back and forth so frequently that the scenes can be hard to follow - an unfortunate trend, especially in newer movies).

The writing/directing was good as well.  Without giving any spoilers, I'll say that the movie is written in such a way that audiences can take nothing from the TV series for granted.  Again, the plot got a little confusing at points, but never terribly bad.  It should probably be noted, however, that people who are not already fans of Star Trek will have difficulty understanding everything.

One thing that really stood out was Michael Giacchino's fantastic musical score for the movie.  It really added good emotion, suspense, and oveall depth to the scenes.

My advice to any Trek fan is to give this a chance.",1252627200,8,1784,4.528125

Fans are going to clamor to see another film hoping to see good actors and a well written and played story. Simon Pegg and Karl Urban did about as close to the original actors did in this movie. Both were fantastic and well done Montgomery  Scotty and McCoy  But Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine did a terrible job trying to portray their characters. This movie was a action movie with a watery story. And many have compared many things in this movie to Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan. But ST:II was a story driven movie with great action scenes. If/when the next movie comes out I hope that it will return to the formula that has been tried and true for the previous 10 movies and 6 series.",1252454400,,1007,4.294736842105263
3472855,5,B001AVCFJM,"Yes folks, Star Trek is back and back in a big way. Be warned that spoilers are ahead, but considering the plot of J.J. Abrams' reboot of Gene Roddenberry's legendary franchise has been pretty much out in the open, I'm probably not saying anything that you don't already know anyway. It all begins with the vengeful Romulan Nero (Eric Bana) coming back in time to wreak havoc on the Federation, so much so that it impacts the history and continuity that die hard Trekkies will no doubt find bones to pick with. From that point forward, we are introduced to the young and reckless James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) who is convinced by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to enlist in Starfleet. It isn't long before Kirk is at odds with Spock (Heroes' Zachary Quinto); who himself is an outcast among his own Vulcan people, and shares a rocky relationship with his Vulcan father Sarek (Ben Cross) and human mother Amanda (Winona Ryder). The dynamic and groundwork laid of Kirk and Spock's relationship is what helps make Abrams' take on Star Trek so good, as he modernizes nearly everything that Trek fans hold dear (seeing young Kirk driving to the Beastie Boys' ""Sabotage"" may be overdoing it a bit, but hey...), yet he manages to pay enough homage to the original series while putting his own spin on things. Pine and especially Quinto are surprisingly wonderfully cast and Kirk and Spock, as is Karl Urban as McCoy, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Simon Pegg in an all too brief turn as Scottie, and Bana as Nero; who is undoubtedly the best Trek film villain since Khan. John Cho as Sulu and Anton Yelchin as Chekov are fine in their relatively small turns as the film moves along with a nicely brisk pace, but the real surprise manages to be the emotional chords that Abrams pulls; whether it be the destruction of the planet Vulcan or the appearance and guidance of old Spock (Leonard Nimoy), who foretells his past self and Kirk alike that their bond and friendship is more than paramount. With brilliant effects, epic space battles, and overall dynamite action scenes; this is the Star Trek for a new generation that we have all wanted and rightly deserve. Now here's hoping that Abrams can manage to pull another rabbit out of his hat with the series someday further down the line.",1252368000,2,2280,4.688279301745636

3472857,5,B001AVCFJM,"Spoiler alert: Don't read if you haven't watched the movie yet, and don't want to know too much in advance.

First off let me say that I am a devoted Star Trek fan, but not a die hard trecker. I don't own a Star Trek encyclopedia, never went to an event, don't speak klingon, and don't own a uniform. But I grew up watching the original series in reruns (TOS). I was so hooked, I never missed a single episode if I could somehow help it, come hell or high water. I also loved the motion pictures with the original cast. But they lost me with TNG (the next generation). I really tried to like it, but never came to care for the characters. Enter the Borgs and I was so disgusted that at that point I jumped ship. Everything produced after TNG went straight over my head. From what I learned, I am not the only one.

I watched this new movie three times. Then I spent a lot of time online reading reviews and opinions. I carefully read all the the complains, the criticism. And I can't help but agree. Does this movie carry a message? Other than the hint about water boarding, probably not. Is it about peaceful exploration? No! Does it suffer from ADHD? Is it too fast paced, is there too much action and violence packed in a weak story line, does it have huge plot holes? Is the Kirk character a little over the edge? Does Spock act out of character? Does the whole time travel and alternative universe business stink somewhat? Yes, guilty on all charges. Did I care for this thing between Spock and Uhura? Nay...

Is this Star Trek after all??? Yes, it is!

I loved the movie. In fact, I weeped with joy. This movie makes me feel like being reunited with dear long lost friends that were left behind for dead. Not to mention the fact that it beamed me right back into my childhood.

The key figures of the cast are terrific! Time for a big sigh of relief: Zacchary Quinto was spot on, which is vital for many folks including me who feel that Spock is the character that makes Star Trek truly special. Chris Pine and Karl Urban did a fantastic job too. All supporting characters also are portrayed very well. I admit I didn't care at all for Ben Cross as Sarek. He somehow always lookes like he was pouting.

Some of the characters come with a slightly different flavor. Spock is still a little green behind the ears (pun intended!). Kirk is over the edge rebellious, constantly hanging over a cliff with a bloody nose, and doesn't show any interest of classic literature as of yet . But all that makes sense, its an age thing.

The only really regrettable twist concerns Amanda. Her character hardly gets any attention and than gets killed of. Along with the whole planet Vulcan at that. That is really hard to stomach, I am still chewing on that one.

And still this movie feels so GOOD! It's hard to explain, but I give it a try.

Every once in a while along comes a show or story that simply is somehow...magic. That has the stuff fairy tales are made of. That has something that resonates with a primal common core deep inside. Magic is not just a thing of the distant past; they still make that stuff. Really! Simply by following ancient, time proven recipes.

Walt Disney, for example, knows a thing or two about magic. Cinderella will never go out of style!

Star Trek TOS has that magic. This is why it survived early cancellation in the late sixties. Not only survived, but from there it kept thriving. Despite the painfully cheesy low budget production and reluctant studio bosses who did their best to slash creativity for ratings. Despite the 'Mary Sues' in ridiculously short mini skirts, and terrible special effects. Maybe Star Trek TOS survived and thrived not despite but because it was cancelled, who knows?

Don't take me wrong, many of the episodes contain great drama, good conflict with plenty of thought provoking messages. Reflecting on the war in Vietnam Rodenberry's Starfleet stands for a military force as it should be, using weapons only as a last option, strictly adhering to the prime directive of non interference but still somehow finding ways to stand its ground. What is not to like?

But the main reason for Star Trek TOS's huge success is the character constellation and the chemistry between them. Because they all present old, well known stereotypes.

The Kirk, Spock and McCoy troika forms the core. Spock, superior to the mere humans around him, standing for knowledge, science, reason and control, McCoy for expressing and dealing with lower emotions like fear and doubt, but also deep care and nurture as a healer or doctor. The love/hate relationship between those two provides great drama and charming humor. Kirk consults with these two opposites, puts it all together, adds human instincts, intuition and leadership. Now Enterprise is ready to take action.

This set of 3 is supported by a framework made of the 4 remaining personalities on the Enterprise bridge, each presenting a different corner and culture of the globe. Uhura from Africa the South, soft spoken and exotic. Scott from Scotland in the North, crafty and energetic. Sulu from Japan in the West, calm with a zen like smile. And Chekov from Russia in the East, the youngest in the lot, eager to please, still an ensign and somewhat low in the food chain, so he doesn't post any threat to the sixties cold war audience.

They all line up like ducks in a row or the seven chakras. The Enterprise is the shiny powerful vehicle that holds all the pieces of the puzzle together.

Put it all on a new and exciting stage, a promising, positive future, and success is almost inevitable. But if you take away a piece of the puzzle, or the Enterprise, or change the pattern somehow, things get out of balance. This is why things went downhill with all the spin offs. Over time, Star Trek slowly but surely disintegrated.

So cliche, some complain. But that doesn't always has to be a flaw, Here it is a thing of beauty.

The TOS concept is so simple and elegant, is so immensely satisfying. This is why so many people are fascinated by the Star Trek phenomena. It strikes an ancient cord, it resonates with us.

Now, JJ Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, put the pieces back together, and Star Trek as we know and love it is back. They captured the essence and take us to the very beginning of the Enterprise saga and its unique crew, and despite all this new background noise (plot holes, ADHD and all, see above) the story still flows seamlessly, still feels right. Again. All hands back on deck, everybody is back on station. The spirit of Star Trek is back. For that I am eternally grateful!!!

If cutting edge special effects and an action filled plot with with lots of humor help drawing wider attention and get more people on board, well, that's even for the better!

Lets hope that in future sequels our friends stay together and are allowed to do some growing up from here, getting a little more reflective and wiser on the way, taking us along for the ride. And that the spirit of Star Trek doesn't get watered down to oblivion again. And I hope and pray that our new alternate universe doesn't come with Borgs!!! ;-)

To cite Nimoy's Spock: ""Have faith that the universe unfolds the way it should"" (Star Trek VI). And: ""Go with what feels right"" (Star Trek 2009)

1. The ship looked like something from early The Next Generation time frame.
2. Christopher Pike looked way to old for his role.
4. Uhura and Spock lovers ??
5. For the most part I did not mind the actors, except the guy who played Scotty cause he looked nothing like him.
6. The special effects were way way to much.

IMO, they need to tone down the uneccesary action scenes and special effects and have an actual storyline.
I still have not decided whether I like this or not, but I would much rather see one more Next Generation movie with the Voyager and Deep Space nine characters involved !

3472864,1,B001AVCFJM,"Well after looking at the reviews i decided it was time to make my own.  I being someone who is a star trek fan from the next generation on i just felt it was the right place to write a review.

Pro:

-Its better looking than any star trek i have seen.

-It will keep you watching to the end and if your not into logic then yeah its for you.

Cons:  Yeah now its time

- The staples easy button does not work for movies!  Just tell the truth and admit you were lazy and didn't want to follow the story.  I would have much more respect for the writers, dirrectors if they just didn't bother with the time travel crap and said ""We are making a new star trek and changing everything"".

- There is 0 sense of time in the movie.  Ex:  It took the enterprise what all of 8 mins to make it from earth to vulcan in warp.  Now on the way back to earth from vulcan they were able to drop off kirk float around some in space warp in a different dirrection to meet up with the fleet then get into a fight on the bridge, turn around and head back in enough time to get to earth for the start of the fight..... oh yeah and kirk fought his way on a planet alone all and met spock and had a story and a mind meld..... In 8 mins people 8 mins.

- Why oh why were all the cadets stationed on planet earth, when they had a huge starbase circling the planet with all their ships there?????  Just a thought but wouldnt it make sense to have people on the starbase if they were on active duty so they could dispatch on time.  I dunno maybe its just me.

- Ok why was spock flying around with a tank full of that red stuff when all he needed was a drop.....  I dunno about that i mean any expert would say thats a bad idea.  Unless his military experts were doing drugs and what not at the time he left, how could anyone think thats a wise idea to let him leave with that much of the crap.  Let alone WHY would you make that much???? Takes 1 drop so why do you need 500 gallons.  (sorry i cant get over that.)

- What military expert thought it was wise to send our main fleet out to fight a battle somewhere else, not easily accessable, and leave only inexperienced rookies to protect their home world?  Over and over they kept talking about their main fleet out somewhere else... The hell were they and why could no one get in touch with them to turn em around and send em home?

- And for last.....  No one sees a problem with there being a black hole in the milky way galaxy, near pluto thats traveling at the speed of light? Much much faster than the speed of light.  So what i am getting at is how did they save earth if they made a black hole so close to earth,  thats increasing at a huge rate and moves faster than their best ship?",1251936000,42,2717,3.9741219963031424
3472865,3,B001AVCFJM,"Full Disclosure: I am not a trekky. This is actually the first Star Trek anything I have ever seen. Star Trek was a little before my time and never got into it like the many people have.

I went to see this movie with an open mind. At first I thought this movie was just outstanding. I loved that they brought back the old Spok and I did enjoy the overall story. However, weeks after seeing it, I realized that I enjoyed it so much because I had just seen Terminator, Wolverine, and Angels & Demons and was INFINITELY disappointed by all of them. Then, under further thought, I realized that I hated Terminator and Wolverine because the writers basically took a big ol' crap on two of the stories that I have grown to love. Now, I know enough of the overall S-Trek stories (my father and older brother were huge fans) to appreciate the impact that S-Trek has on many people. I then realized that if I was one of those people, I would likely be infuriated by this film.

From the perspective of someone that has never really been into S-Trek, and was just looking to be entertained this is probably one of the better films of the summer. However, if you are a trekky and have a deep connection with the main characters, then this film could possibly infuriate you.",1251936000,4,1263,4.3931623931623935

3472868,1,B001AVCFJM,"I've always been a fan of Star Trek. I was very young when it was on NBC in the late sixties and became an avid fan when it went into syndication. I enjoyed the animated series and then the movies. I welcomed The Next Generation and the other series to follow. I'm a big fan of Star Trek Voyager - Janeway is awesome. I couldn't wait to see the new Star Trek movie. I looked forward to seeing other actors playing the original roles and felt that it was such a compliment to the original cast for their roles to be reproduced 40 years later. When the movie started I was in awe and was quickly swept away in the youthful exuberance and non-stop action. It was different than the original, but that was OK. But then the unthinkable happened. The destruction of Vulcan and the assassination of the original timeline knocked the wind out of me. I kept waiting for the salvation of THE Star Trek universe that I had been a part of for the past 40 years. When the movie ended, I was confused and let down, mostly because I had enjoyed the first half of the film so much. The changing of the timeline was not necessary. I have heard many reviewers say that the complex continuity that has been developed throughout the years was too restrictive and had to be eliminated. Well, all I can say is that I have quite a lot of respect for writers. A good writer would have been able to come up with a script that would hold the interest of the old and new fan. In fact, the first half of the movie proves that is possible. My impression is that the assassination of THE Star Trek universe was very deliberate. The director and writers went out of their way to tell original Trek fans to go to hell. The director, in so many words, told trekkies to ""stay home and skip this one"". It was very deliberate. I guess he felt that by tossing original Trek fans overboard, they would make more room for the new ones. But the Star Trek Universe is big, and frankly I think there was enough room in that universe for the old and the new fans. I think J.J. never really grasped the size of the Trek Universe. A MESSAGE TO PARAMOUNT: With the TRUE Star Trek Universe erased from existence, I think it would be useless to spend any more money on the franchise. After all, what good is it to own the Star Trek movies on blu-ray if the events in those movies never took place. The same goes for novelizations, collectibles, etc. I wonder if the new fans will be as eager to spend their money on your alternate franchise.",1251504000,45,2493,4.295116772823779

3472875,5,B001AVCFJM,"I am not a long time fan of the original series. In fact, I have never seen any of the original episodes, but I have seen the movies and knew the storyline. To me, this film is a complete restart/reboot/updated version of the classic series, and I loved it! Everybody did an awesome job kick-starting the Star Trek franchise! It has great action sequences, awesome special effects, comedy, sexual tension between Spock and Uhura, and much more! I agree with the commercial, 'This is not your father's Star Trek' We see the birth of James Kirk, building the new U.S.S. Enterprise, Leonard Nimoy returns as the older Spock. The crew meet at Starfleet Academy and train for three years. An evil time-traveling Romulan named Captain Nero alters the past to mess up the future. When Captain Pike is kidnapped by Nero, a new Captain must rise to stop the bad guy! If you are a Trekkie, I highly recommend STAR TREK!!!",1250812800,3,911,4.6645962732919255

As for the Continuum, if you will not admit it to everyone here, admit it to yourselves...Nemesis was crap, the franchise was dead, and they needed something new. Creating an alternate future does that. And it brings in new fans which will boost the franchise back to life. So please, get over your close-minded timelines and heads, and enjoy the fact that because of JJ and all the rest who worked on making this film great, your Star Trek and mine will live on, at lease until the sequel comes out.",1250640000,4,647,4.538461538461538
3472878,1,B001AVCFJM,"I have to say, I wish I'd never seen this movie at all.  I grew up with the original Star Trek, and when I say grew up ... I mean I watched it when it aired originally as a small girl (and again later in re-runs when I was older).

The producers totally destroyed the Star Trek Cannon here ... more then once, and that's really sad.

I mean even from the beginning, I could tell it was going bad when they couldn't even give us (die hard core trekkies) the little things, like when Jim Kirk was being born, to have a toddler/2 or 3 yr old boy (George Kirk Jr, Jim's older brother), running along side to the escape pods!

Without George Kirk, there was no Nephew (Peter Kirk) for Jim to rescue years later.

The movie itself, was forgetable, and I guess in part, because from that little bit on, the movie went downhill, and as I mentioned, made me wish I'd never seen the thing, as it went against much of what I hold dear for Star Trek.",1250553600,25,938,4.131868131868132

3472881,5,B001AVCFJM,"I saw this movie in the theater's three times. I thought it introduced some real fresh elements to the franchise. I must disagree with the gentlemen above that said..""the other Treks do not stand out!"" That is incorrect..many Trek films DO stand out. I thought Star Trek 4 had some serious themes about animal extinction and how it effected the future of the planet. I also though Star Trek 2 with Kahn was well done. Star Trek 6 was awesome as well. These films were filmed at a time when the technology wasn't as advanced as we have now.
Im just glad to see the TOS Star Trek crew back in the franchise. The most popular and what is considered the DEFENITIVE Trek is TOS.
The TOS films made very high earnings at the box office with the exception of Star Trek 5. The TNG films saw a decline in earnings at the box office. Though the only TNG film I thought that was at least good was First Contact. But I never bonded with that crew and felt the connection like I did with the TOS crew. The other Star Trek incarnations I don't even consider part of the Trek universe.
Get this movie..the plot is awesome action adventure which the whole family will love and enjoy! Thanks for bringing the DEFENITIVE Star Trek back!!!!",1250121600,3,1221,4.407079646017699
3472882,1,B001AVCFJM,"I went in with an open mind, but my disappointment only grew throughout the movie.

This movie proved to me exactly how wrong I was. It has been a long time since I was completely captivated while watching a movie.

Star Trek contains everything one could desire in a movie: action, adventure, suspense and humor. A lot more humor than a novice might expect. Altogether this is the best movie I have seen all year. I was absolutely enthralled the entire time I was watching it. I couldn't be happier I put my prejudices aside or else I would have missed out on a great film.

3472885,5,B001AVCFJM,"This refitted Star Trek pays homage to the original in many ways but makes it clear this isn't grandpa's classic show. JJ Abrams wasn't afraid to enhance, indulge or flat out change the overhaul of this newest of takes on Star Trek. What he didn't lose was the heart of the Star Trek and the shows incessant need to display basic human struggles up against a space back drop. Abrams starts out this adventure before the original series began. The crew of the U.S.S Enterprise is young and scrappy but they will entertain on every level and far exceed expectations along with out classing every previous Trek film.

Story/Writing (Fresh & Witty) This Movie had a box to stay in in regards to not losing the soul of the original series. Not an easy task but one that was accomplished with flying colors. The story was original & brilliant despite the series being over forty. Trek takes liberties and yes some trekkie fans will require binkies due to not being able to handle them but they were all well thought out and clever.

Acting (Brilliant & Honest): A well rounded group of actors and Abrams ensures they all deliver. While all the players were great some were truly exceptional e.g. Nero, new Spock & new McCoy. Nero (Eric Bana) was a totally fresh character that Mr. Bana formed into a diabolical villain. McCoy (Keith Urban) was owned by Mr. Urban that's the only way to phrase it. Spock (Zachary Quinto) like every thing else played by Mr. Quinto is a force of nature. Kirk (Chris Pine) is given a solid performance by Mr. Pine. What he doesn't do is try to hard to imitate Shatner (thank god) but instead gives him is own artistic view. This is why the acting was great because the actors were free to interpret not imitate.

Special effects (Crisp and Edgy): Thats the biggest shock from old to new is now the effects look real. The bridge is now full of life with electronic pings, beautiful tactical displays and finally a bridge that is fitting for a star ship. Space battles are voracious and stunning. The effects in Trek come fast, hit hard and help this to be one of the best sci-fi movies of the last ten years.

Last take (Fun, fun & did I mention fun): This is a great family movie for all people trekkie or not. It was funnier knowing about star trek lore due to a couple jokes they throw in but most of the movie was geared towards everyone. So stop the hesitation and go see it.

Final thought: Most entertaining movie of the summer 09 hands down.",1249862400,4,2472,4.496659242761693
3472886,1,B001AVCFJM,"After starring in ""Diamonds Are Forever"", Sean Connery vowed he would never star in another James Bond film.

Then another production company got the rights to make their own Bond film, following some of the monkey business involving ""Thunderball"", and Connery was signed to reprise the role of Agent 007.

It was Connery's wife who suggested the title, ""Never Say Never Again"".

Well, I vowed I would never see the new Star Trek movie, partly because I have no interest in alternate timeline stories, but mostly because of a lot of the misleading buildup to this thing and some of the behind the scenes crap, particularly the firing of Geoffery Mandel from the production staff because he was ""too attached to the original ship.""

Then, I wound up winning passes to a press screening.

No problem, I have class that night, so I can't go anyway. And we're talking broadcasting school, no way am I ditching training in my beloved chosen career field for this misbegotten flick.

Then I found out the subject that night was going to be sales.

I hate sales.

Guess I was going after all. At least I could rest easy that I can still say that I'll never pay to see this atrocity.

So, I went ahead and saw it at the press screening, and all I can say is that I'm oh, so glad that I didn't have to pay for it.

Suffice it to say that I was massively underwhelmed. Plot contrivances, shaky camera, even in the CGI stuff, cringe inducing dialogue, a ""Look at MEEE!"" glory shot of the ship every five minutes, all capped off with a closing credit sequence ripped off from the Lost in Space movie....well, let's just say that just about everything I said before I saw it, stands.

Some of the more minor annoyances:

Pink skinned Vulcans: Y'know, JJ, there was a reason they painted Nimoy yellow way back when, and it's because of that green Vulcan blood.

The Kelvin: 800 people made it off, after getting the crap kicked out it, which killed how many? And this is supposed to be a pre-TOS ship? Sorry, but that bucket reeked more of TNG, both in capacity, the instrumentation, and in the crew complement, which apparently included families, another TNG contrivance that didn't make it past ""Generations"" (the Enterprise-E doesn't have families on board). The interiors also indicated a much more massive ship, on the order of a Galaxy class starship. And what in the hell is with plastic sheeting in the shuttlecraft? Does it double as a meat locker?

The technology: Compared to TOS, most it, quite frankly, sucked. The numbskull front window/viewscreen was blurry and distorted, the transporter didn't work half as well as even the NX-01's, and the phasers, both shipboard and handheld, all behaved more like Star Wars blasters and turbolasers than their TOS predecessors. And need I mention Sulu's automatically unfolding katana, which helped him in his dashing impression of Luke Skywalker in the barge scene in ""Return of the Jedi""? Or how the ships going to warp bore an uncanny resemblence to SW ships going to hyperspace? Should George Lucas be flattered or should he be calling his lawyers?

Delta Vega: As an astute poster over on [...] pointed out, the name of the neighboring planet that Spock was stranded on really didn't have any bearing on the story, but by invoking the name of Delta Vega, the writers shined a big bright spotlight on this bit, making it quite clear that, deep down, they don't know what they're doing. A big part of ""honoring canon"" is getting the details right; otherwise, it's just meaningless name dropping and pandering.

Chekov: Excuse me, but exactly when did Chekov turn into Wesley Crusher? He was never any kind of wunderkind in TOS, just an eager young ensign trying to impress his superior officers. Also, at age seventeen, he should be starting his first year at the Academy, not already be a commissioned officer. But then, these clowns clearly don't know a thing about military protocol, since they also take a guy who was an undisciplined cadet facing some serious charges a couple of days earlier and give him command of their biggest and most advanced ship. Never mind the hundreds of seasoned officers who've been waiting God knows how long for a command of their own, let's give it to the hotshot kid with the rap sheet, because he's just so gosh darned dreamy. At the very least, it's clear they wouldn't know the chain of command if someone came up and beat 'em about the head and shoulders with it.

And my complaint about Spock still remains: He knows how to achieve a time warp, and he knows precisely what happened when, why it happened, what went wrong the first time, and how to circumvent those events. So why doesn't he get a ship, do a few time jumps, and fix everything that got screwed up? He could not only restore the timeline, but finally cement a lasting peace between the Romulan Empire and the Federation. So why doesn't he do this?

Because Spock has to have a sudden attack of the stupids in order for JJ to get his own Star Trek universe to run amok in.

Urban was good as McCoy, Pine was okay as Kirk, can't really grade Greenwood as Pike since we never got that much from Jeffery Hunter to form a basis of comparison, but taken on it's own, he gives a good performance, Yelchin was downright embarrassing as Chekov, Quinto just seemed to be PMSing all the time, and the rest of the cast was just sort of there.

The ship still looks stupid, and the decision to build it on the surface is the singlemost idiotic move in the entire history of the franchise.

It didn't help that the ""Riverside shipyards"" were clearly a present day industrial facility, either an oil refinery or electrical substation. Engineering looking alternately like a water treatment plant and, like it is in real life, a brewery, only adds insult to injury.

If this an example of just how dumbed down Star Trek has to be in order to appeal to that elusive mass general audience, then I am very content for Star Trek to remain a small niche market.",1249776000,11,5991,4.637393767705382
3472887,4,B001AVCFJM,"I am a huge Star Trek fan. I remember as a kid seeing the originals (or at least the first two seasons when they were on at a time I could stay up to) when they were aired and of course in sydication for what seems like forever. The first Star Trek movie (The Motion Picture) thankfully was not a warning of things to come and the next three were very enjoyable. The franchise started losing its way after that as far as the movies go and except for a few bright spots from ""Generations"" seemed doomed to come to a close. ST:TNG went a long way to bringing it back in a good way on the small screen (though the first season was pretty bad IMO), and there was enough fun and drama in the other shows to make them watchable.

By the time Enterprise was yanked (just as it started to get really good), it seemed that the ship had been grounded. A few years later JJ puts his hand in it and the trailers had me interested enough to hold off judgement. Glad I did as the the movie was a roller coaster from the opening sequence and rarely let you catch your breath. Sure I could quibble about a few things (like how the Enterprise was built and commanded by a Captain April some 30-40 years before Pike and Kirk had their shot at it), but overall this was exactly what Star Trek needed. A new beginning. Pine does a pretty good job as Kirk, but the real standout in Quinto as Spock. If you didn't see it in the theaters, you missed out on the best way to see the film but either on DVD or BluRay with a decent TV will be a good experience too. For all those complaining about how all the prior Trek is now gone...never fear. This is an alternate universe, not a replacement. So all your beloved shows are still relevent.

Don't let yourself be blind to what is a great flick and a worthy entry into Star Trek lore.",1249603200,11,1809,4.150997150997151

3472889,4,B001AVCFJM,"Not a Star Trek fan myself, I only went to see this on good buzz. Well, I am glad I did because I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. More of an origins type film, we get to see how characters meet and train, and fly on the ships for the very first time. There is certainly enough action and plot to keep everyone entertained but what I was most impressed with were the characters. Chris Pine plays Kirk, and was actually the blandest of all the characters. That isn't to say he didn't do a good job, but rather he was a bit on the boring side. Zachary Quinto plays Spock, and he was just brilliant, I thought. I've always said that the characters who are the most emotionally withdrawn, are also the most interesting. This is precisely the case here. There are plenty of surprises in regards to this character. He is the reason I love this film so much. The rest of the supporting cast does a great job as well. The only weak link is Eric Bana's Nero. His character is just plain annoying, and unfortunately, he is the villian so he is somewhat important to the film. Fortunately, it actually doesn't detract much from what is already going on.

The film opens with an amazingly dramatic sequence and it ends just as brilliantly. The special effects are pretty flawless as well as the makeup and costumes. There really is no fault in the technical department. Plotwise, it does get a tad confusing in parts, especially when you are dealing with time travel, but it all comes together towards the end. Certainly there is a sequel in the works, and I can only hope it will be as good as the first.",1249516800,3,1599,4.402027027027027
3472890,5,B001AVCFJM,"As a Star Trek Fan of many years, I found all subsequent series attempting to carry on the tradition lacking in the magic and chemistry of the original cast.  When the old crew got together and put together a series of films in their old age the wonder returned if but for a short while.  In the void were TV programs, characterizations, and films that although interesting, failed to keep me involved with the series.  In essence, I found that without Spock, Kirk or any of the old crew, my interest waned.

When this new Star Trek appeared, I looked at the new young actors that would attempt to replace the characters that I had grown to love so much.  I asked myself, ""Who besides Leonard Simon Nimoy could play Spock?  What charlatan would dare think they could capture the soul and spirit that made James T Kirk such a memorable character?""

To say the least, I avoided the film like the plague until it was the only IMAX film playing in Guadalajara that my godchildren wanted to see.  To my delight, I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  Chris Pine (James T Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock) and each of the new young actors mastered their personas so thoroughly that one could not avoid relishing in the banter with which we had became so familiar. The young talent brought to the film a youth and authenticity worthy of the original cast and one that could produce many more films in the years to come.  I only hope that Hollywood does not talk itself out of making at least one more. A few illogical sequences occurring in this film may stumble some of you sticklers who long to adhere to references in linear time especially when attempting to retrace the lives of Spock's Parents in your memories.  Remember however, that time travel and altering the past will theoretically create a ripple effect and change the time continuum to reflect an alternate reality.  This profound concept opens the door to a new future and a universe that must be explored.  These are the voyages of the starship enterprise.  Their mission, to discover strange new worlds and to boldly go where no man has gone before. The magic has returned -JC Angelcraft.",1249430400,3,2141,4.62962962962963

I cannot wait until it comes out on DVD so I can watch it with my husband when he returns from overseas.  It was exciting, funny, suspenseful, and totally exhilarating...something one doesn't get in a lot of movies these days.  I just do not understand how anybody could find this movie boring.

I grew up watching the original Star Trek series during a time when ""girls"" were supposed to play with dolls.  Poppycock!  My brother's toys, friends, and interests were much more fun than dolls and, thankfully, he included me in all of his fun.  Needless to say, I have enjoyed all of the movies and series over the years, with the exception of a few.  This movie is, without a doubt, the most action packed of all the movies, to date.  That is not to say the others were boring, as I loved Star Trek IV; it is just that with the never-ending improvements in special effects, so too, will movies improve.",1249257600,5,1032,4.356020942408377
3472892,1,B001AVCFJM,"All the Kool-Aid drinkers across the nation will have nothing but praise to say about this god-awful film. So I thought I'd throw out a little rational perspective about the film that you seem to like for some unknown reason. Here are just a few problems with this movie.

* If the Romulans knew a super nova was coming, why didn't they evacuate the planet?  It takes months for a super nova to blow.

* Let's say that Spock's plan worked. He gets the red matter and fires it at the Romulan sun that's about to Nova. It works! The sun is sucked into a black hole. Mission accomplished.  But now the Romulan solar system has no sun, therefore no warmth, which would cause Romulas to turn into an ice planet. They are damned if they do or don't do anything.  You'd think Vulcans would see it was illogical to do anything but evacuate. Too bad the mindlessly stupid writers of this film didn't notice that also.

* Nero's actions have changed all history and created an alternate timeline. However, they seem to forget that this movie starts with a rather large nitpick. Everyone knows that Captain Kirk was born in Iowa. The very instantaneous second the film begins, everything is unaltered from Nero's actions. Yet Kirk's mother is about to give birth on the starship Kelvin. Why isn't she in Iowa?

* Nero's ship is significantly huge compared to the Kelvin. So why didn't Nero just destroy it? He could have destroyed it easily like he did the much larger attacking Starships around Vulcan. But he just sits there and lets the escape pods fly to their freedom.

* How come the interior of the Kelvin looks like a 20th century metal refinery?

* Why does the engineering section of the Enterprise look like a water treatment facility?

* Do the writers of this film know anything about geography? There are no canyons in Iowa!!!

* Why is the Enterprise built in a cornfield! And exactly how did it get into space???  It has to landing struts. What prevents this thing from tipping over when this ship is released from it's docking clamps? You'll notice this was never shown in the film.

* Spock & Uhura. Hmm. Let's see here. Aside from the fact that this couldn't be a more mismatched coupling, does this young, vibrant, and sexually active Uhura know that Vulcans only mate every 7 years?  Good luck with that, Uhura!

* Why are the Romulans all bald with facial tattoos?  The design of the tattoos are what we call ""Tribal"" design in earth of 2009. So why are humanoid aliens from the 24th century using a fad symbol from 2009 earth?

* At one point, Spock gets tired of Kirk's disobedience and ejects him off the Enterprise. Uhm.  Why not just throw him in the BRIG???!!! Isn't ejecting him to an ice planet a little drastic???

* On the original series, Delta Vega was an empty desert planet full of rocks, dust, and a delethium cracking station. In this film, Delta Vega is an ICE PLANET!!! WTF???!!! When did this happen??? And where is the dilethium station???!!!  And how the hell did it get in the Vulcan system???

* Nero strands Spock on Delta Vega so he could watch planet Vulcan get destroyed and feel the pain and anguish Nero felt when Romulas was destroyed. But Delta Vega is an ice planet! Which means it snows a lot. Which means it's probably cloudy most of the time. Which means Spock might not be able to see Vulcan get destroyed! Even if there were no clouds, Nero would have to wait until nightfall before Spock could see anything happening in space. Also, doesn't Nero know that Vulcans are unemotional? A Vulcan might not react like an emotional Romulan would.  And what's to prevent Spock from killing himself before having the witness this and live his live on an ice planet???

* When planet Vulcan is being destroyed, why does Spock try and save the Vulcan elders? Wouldn't it make more sense to save the children and younger Vulcans? After all, this is genocide! Why not save those who are capible of having children?

* On the original series, Kirk's eyes were brown and Dr. McCoy's were blue. In this film, this is reversed. How could Nero's actions change eye color? Especially since both men were conceived long before Nero arrived to change the time line.

* Scotty mentions an experiment he tried with Admiral Archer's dog. Uhm. Wouldn't Archer be long dead since this movie takes place 150 years after the events in Star Trek: Enterprise???

* When Nero is interrigating Captain Pike on his ship, why is Nero walking in 3 feet of water?

* Elder Spock is insistant that Kirk not tell younger Spock of Elder's Spock's exisrtance. Then, at film's end, Elder Spock meets younger Spock anyway!!!

Just a few observations. But if you have an answer for these, I would LOVE to hear them!  I only wish Amazon would allow me to give this film zero stars. It certainly doesn't deserve ANY. This movie was AWFUL. JJ Abrams has ruined Star Trek.",1249084800,21,4873,4.575373993095512
3472893,3,B001AVCFJM,"Is this a good film? Yes, but it is nowhere near as exciting or interesting as you might have heard. The main appeal here is the visuals and the terrific cast.

3472894,5,B001AVCFJM,"Now firstly, I was not a Trekkie before seeing this opening weekend at the cinema in Digital projection. However though, the trailer looked amazing, and I remember watching the show on TV on the Space Network every morning before going to school. I also remember dressing up as Data from The Next Generation on TV.

Anyways, last night I saw this in a packed cinema with every single seat taken. We had gotten tickets in advance, and got to the theater early. Good thing we did- the lineup was longer than the great wall of China! We were lucky to get good seats too. And boy, we LOVED this movie!

Anybody would like this movie, even people who don't like Star Trek. Hell, Even my sister who didn't like the show loved the movie. There were even a lot of non-Trekkies in our theatre, if I had to guess.

This movie is a reboot of the franchise, taking us back to the very beginning. We learn the origins of the characters Spock and James Tiberius Kirk, Kirk's bumbling misadventures at the Starfleet Academy, Spock and Kirk's rivalry, the Klingon, and much more.

The movie is flat out perfection in every sense of the word. The special effects are excellent, the visuals are breathtaking. Sometimes there are Camera flares (meaning light relecting off the camera), adding to the ""beautifully shot"" feel of the movie. The action is top notch- The handheld camera adds to the intensity of the scenes (don't worry, the camera doesn't shake all over the place, you can actually see what's going on). There's tons of humor too- Kirk is HILARIOUS, as well as there are tons of hilarious moments in this movie, including Kirk getting all the injections- now that was hilarious!

The best thing about the film is the casting- Chris Pine is awesome as Kirk, and is really funny here. I was surprised to find out he played Darwin Tremor in Smokin' Aces too- he was hilarious in that one as well. Karl Urban as McCoy, John Cho as Hikaru Sulu, and the sexy Zoe Saldanha as Uhura is awesome too. Anton Yelchin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty were hilarious too, Pegg was the PERFECT Scotty. Truly fit the quirkiness of the character.

But the real high point of the performances is Zachary Quinto as Spock. He plays Spock perfectly. The look, the tone of voice... he really IS Spock. He makes a lot of Spockish facial expressions throughout too, he's really Nimoy-esque. Speaking of Leonard Nimoy, he's in the movie too! It was a great surprise to see the original Spock.

So in short, do NOT miss this while it's in the cinema. Abrams has really nailed it here. Well, I'm now a fan of Star Trek thanks to this movie! People applauded at the cinema when the movie was over. I was one of those people, in fact I even yelled ""YEAH!"".",1248998400,9,2723,4.5336048879837065
3472895,2,B001AVCFJM,"This is really just another one of those Hollywood films where once the hype has died down, you realize that your senses have been stimulated, but your mind and heart have not. On the plus side, the characterization is good and captures the essence of the original Star Trek characters. But that is about it. The plot really makes no sense. And the worst thing is that there is simply no Star Trek message in this film whatsoever. Kill the bad guy - the end. Is that why Star Trek has endured for all these decades? And what about the sense of exploration; the strange new worlds? None of that either - in truth Hollywood is terrified of exploration. When you can create anything in CGI, the concept of wonder dies in the imaginations of filmmakers.

So what are you left with? Bad guys to kill. Is it really so difficult to write a Star Trek film without a two-dimensional ""villain of the week""? Does this mean that the next film will have another villain to kill etc, etc...yawn. Star Trek was special because it humanized the ""other side"" in ways that we hadn't seen before. It explored the human condition in a way that was both fun and wonderous. Yet, forty years later we have regressed to this? Is Hollywood now responsible for us de-evolving? Thanks but no thanks. It may look like Star Trek and sound like Star Trek, but with no heart or soul it doesn't take much to see that the Emperor has no clothes...",1248998400,16,1414,4.45945945945946
3472896,4,B001AVCFJM,"What a novel concept for renewing a tired franchise!  Go back in time, mess it up, and start from scratch.  I love the idea.  However, my only fault was the emotional Spock.  Fighting, marooning Kirk, his kissing Uhura.... not very Spock-like.  However, with Lenord Nimoy in the movie as the adult Spock, the whole Young Spock thing could happen.  It's a fun ride, and the redesign of the Enterprise is cool too.  It would be fun to see this turned into a TV series.",1248998400,6,466,4.476190476190476
3472897,4,B001AVCFJM,"Other reviews give many details as well as appreciative comments about this new release, so I won't repeat either the details or points of positive comment.  I immensely enjoyed this film and was not disappointed in it.  Also, as a first generation Star Trek fan, from 1967, when I watched the episodes from the first series on a black and white tv in the Students' Common Room at Sydney University, I enjoyed many aspects of the new film.  But, as I watched, I did wonder:  how can Spock sustain an ongoing relationship with Uhura when Pon Far occurs only every 7 years and the rest of the time Vulcans do not have sexual urges?  (Or, at least, successfully repress them.)  Would any sensible command structure entrust a supremely valuable starship and highly trained crew to the over-the-top impulses of a loose cannon like young Kirk?  (I counted 4 times in the film when Kirk is literally handing from his fingertips, beginnning when he was a lad racing his uncle's stolen car.)  Kirk is depicted as a young man without any commonsense at all!  Would a highly advanced civilisation like Vulcan really be defenseless against terrorists from space?  (It doesn't seem logical!)  In the heat of battle, would people really be running from one part of a starship to another part when communicating via onship radio or handheld communicators would be faster?

Hence, I could only give this exciting film 4 stars.  But I was grateful that dialogue and characterisation did not take second place to special effects.  Despite my reservations, I still think this movie is great fun.  Any fan of Star Trek shouldn't miss it.",1248998400,4,1617,4.807971014492754
3472898,5,B001AVCFJM,"As a long time and die hard fan of Star Trek, I went to see this film with an open mind.  It was not so much an alternate story but an interfered history.  Star fans should remember the 'prime directive'.  Never change history.  Apparently Nero did not read it.  What results is a great movie.  Great actors.  I loved it.  Can't wait for the DVD.  I will have a marathon.",1248998400,,371,4.185714285714286
3472899,3,B001AVCFJM,"I have mixed feelings on this film. ** SPOILERS AHEAD ** Some of it was really good and some of it was really bad.  I think the worst part of the movie was the story. First of all, why bother going through all the trouble of re-writing the Star Trek universe by altering the time line, with the end result being that all the same characters all end up in the same place they were in the original series?  Why bother?  The story was more about getting all the characters together on the ship with the Romulans as a side show.  There are a ton of things in the movie that make absolutely no sense at all.  Why was Kirk thrown off the ship for insubordination?  Don't they have brigs on the ship anymore or transporters?  Why have a full court hearing in front of hundreds of cadets for a simple matter of cheating on a test?  Spock is stickler on rules, yet he makes time to make out with Uhura on the transporter pad during a crisis.  Spock beats up Kirk on the bridge in front of everyone, including security personnel, and nobody does a thing about it.  Spock just walks off, not arrested or confined in any way.  Which brings up another point.  Why did we need to be subjected to Kirk getting beat up over and over again?  He gets creamed by Federation security, Romulans, and Spock.  At the end of the movie, Kirk gets promoted to Captain.  Huh?  Just like that over one act of heroism and he's the captain?  There's a complete lack of attention to military protocol in this movie.  Uhura is the worst of all of them.  She is an annoying sarcastic character constantly questioning superior officers. She constantly leaves her post without uttering a word, usually chasing after her boyfriend Spock.  Look at the Romulans.  It's funny how all of them speak perfect English.  There's even a Romulan with a British accent.  They are essentially miners from the future with a mining vessel that is armed to the teeth.  Since when does a mining vessel need such an arsenal?  At several points the ship looks invincible, easily destroying a Federation fleet.  Later in the film however, the Enterprise easily shoots down all it's torpedoes that are heading for Spock's small ship.  Huh?  If that's all there was to it then why couldn't they do that before?????
See what I mean?  There is just a complete lack of attention to detail in the story.  The film makers took everything that made Star Trek great and ignored it.  Star Trek was popular because it was cerebral.  It had great stories and great scripts.  This movie doesn't have that.  It's typical Hollywood at it again trying to dumb down everything.  Endlessly trying to appease the Transformers crowd.
It's not all bad though.  There is a lot of good stuff here.  Special effects are terrific. Plenty of action scenes. The sets are fantastic.  If you look at the bridge of the USS Kelvin, it is the most detailed and well designed one I have ever seen. In fact, the beginning of the movie with Kirk's dad is the best part of the film. It's almost as if a different director did that whole scene. The music is great.  The cast and the acting is great.  Bruce Greenwood makes a great Capt. Pike.  Zachary Quinto completely nails it as Spock.  Karl Urban surprised me by doing a very good McCoy.  There is enough good things here to make the movie good, just not great.",1248998400,2,3323,4.4958123953098825

They did NOT take a classic and butcher it beyond all comprehension.  However, there was also enough of a twist, (Lost fans will recognize the style) that the audience was seeing something new.  My favorite part (outside the plot line) was that they used special effects appropriately.  They producers did not throw the effects in to say ""Look what we can do!"" but rather they used them as an enhancing accessory.  Very well done!",1248998400,,589,4.84

3) Our 'Bad Guy' is a miner...PATHETIC
4) Why change the warp engines? Now they have thrust ejecting from the rear of the nacelles? The moron that made this film did not take the time to do ANY research else he would have known that they do not use this method of propulsion.
5) Why change the way the weapons work on the starships? It wasn't broke why did you 'fix' it?
6) 'Kirk' just happens to be ejected on the exact barren world that Spock landed on? Give me a break.
7) 'Kirk' and 'Scotty' are able to beam across billions of miles onto a starship moving at warp? This is not possible until well into The Next Generation era. Even in this film it is established that it is difficult to beam a falling object, i.e. one with momentum, so how is it suddenly so easy to do this?
8) If you can beam across several lightyears of space why do you need ships? The 'creator' of this film is truly an idiot.
9) The new hand phasers spin their fronts, why? This chance is plain silly. It serves no purpose other than to further modify that which did not need modification.
10) 'Kirk' is able to convince 'Spock' to relinquish his command by using 30 seconds of verbal goading? You have got to be kidding me.
11) Now a third year cadet is in command of the fleet's flagship. Do I have to say it.
12) The Coup de grace: said Third year cadet 'Kirk' (I use quotes to denote his status as a fake or psuedo version of the REAL character) is now promoted directly to CAPTAIN! This is off-the-scale stupid. This thug doesn't even graduate from the Academy and jumps over 10 years of his career and at least four grades of rank. I almost threw my beer at the screen when I saw this (Movie Tavern you can order beer there).

3472903,3,B001AVCFJM,"Ok where to start.
I knew they would make the characters different from the original.

The bad:
My first issue is they did the classic bad guy ships dark and good guy ships all sunny and bright.
The second thing I have issue with this new movie is the Enterprise engine room was to industrial.
The design of the ship I didn't like it. The original one looked better this is something hard to put my fingers on.
The relationship between Spock and Uhura the romance seemed out of place and forced like the director decided he needed a love scene.
Chekov over did the accent thing trying to play it for a laugh and was not believable.

The Good:
Lots of action
By creating a new time line they could revisit old plots and do them differently.

If you liked the original Startrek then you might find yourself very disappointed with this movie. It was OK but not good and not up to the Startrek production. If this is the way the new generation of the Startrek franchise is going then I will be sticking to reruns. The director/writers/producers didn't seem to understand the Startrek franchise. If it had been named something different like Questrek or something else then it might had been better, but when you have a 40+ year old franchise there are just certain expatiations.

I am so tired of Hollywood remaking or redoing old franchises and just tossing out the history that has been established and do whatever they feel they want to.

Will I buy this movie? Not right now I might get it when it becomes used.
Will I see any other Startrek movies with this time line? Maybe.

If the rumor I hear about them making a new TV series based on this movie I might watch a few episodes to give it a chance but if it is like this movie then I will just say NO.",1248825600,5,1754,4.365030674846626
3472904,4,B001AVCFJM,"I am a huge Trek fan.  Period.  End of sentence.  I grew up with the Classic cast.  They were my comrades and brothers.  Those actors did what no one else had done up to that point in science fiction and almost all of television.  My loyalties will always lie with them, especially the big three of Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley, may he RIP.  And Jimmy, too.  Is it the best Trek show?  No.  To me, DS9 now has that honor.  Is it amazing they made it at all, let alone started an institution and a cash cow for Paramount?  It is still The Franchise.  Hell, yes, it's amazing.  Plus the original series MEANT something both in terms of its morality play stories and the lightning in a bottle chemistry of the cast.
  1987.  When Next Gen came out, I thought it was blasphemy.  How could anybody, even Roddenberry, make Trek without those seven actors/characters?  Granted, there was no way I was missing Farpoint, so my butt was in the chair and I felt a little tear when I watched De's cameo with Data. The first season of TNG was painful at times.  But spiritually Trek was in there someplace.  And once the 3rd season got going about 3/4 of the way through, Next Gen hit an amazing stretch of fine episodes.  And the quality of all three of the other shows, even Voyager, was pretty good, especially compared to other crap on TV.
  Fast forward to 2009.  Trek is to all intents and purposes dead.  (Not counting my beloved Pocket Books who has kept it on life support.)  I loved Enterprise, especially the last year but I am definitely in the minority.  I loved Nemesis and consider it (and First Contact) the best of the Next Gen films.  But Trek needed a kick in the pants.
  With this film, it got it.  And then some.  I don't think Pine/Quinto/Urban will ever replace the originals to people who grew up with it like I did.  BUT and this is a huge reason to buy this movie, no one could do better service to the old show than they have done and I specifically mean the casting and the acting which is as perfect as can be under the circumstances.
  And if you don't know Trek at all, welcome aboard.  I am amazed at how well things turned out for the newbie.  You don't have to be a geek to like it.  We're not all geeks anyway.
  To the Trekkies/Trekkers who hated it - look, I didn't like the Spock/Uhura thing AT ALL, despite the wonderful comedic payoff on the transporter pad.  The bridge was too bright and not enough primary colors.  The camera did move too much.  These are all minor things.  It's a rollicking adventure that is FUN.  Picard never had this much fun, even on Risa!  The main thing of course is everyone bemoaning the planet Vulcan and/or their mistaken belief that all of TOS is wiped out.
  Well, folks, the best part of the film, the iconic Spock (I hate to call him Spock Prime when HE, Nimoy, IS SPOCK) retains all of those memories in his head.  One mind meld to Quinto or anyone else and it is all there.  Everything from The Cage up to his Romulan activities and beyond.  It's still all there.  And even if it weren't, WE still have it for ourselves.
  Do you mean to say you won't get excited when that music starts in Doomsday Machine now that you've seen the film?  Or won't wish you were Kirk when he meets Marlena Moreau?  Or laugh when Bones yells, ""Shut up, Spock!  We're rescuing you!""
  Of course you will.  (All from Season Two if you want to brush up on TOS.)  I even forgot the Gorn and the Horta!  (Season One)
  And now we'll always have Chris Pine meeting Spock Prime and uttering a word I probably can't say on here in what I'm sure will be a classic moment.  And the fight on the platform with Kirk and Sulu and Redshirt.  (Gotta say, it sucks for anybody to die but somebody HAD TO, especially in red.  Like a tradition, y'know?)  And Kirk's big Muppet hands.  And Deep Roy playing Scotty's cute little sidekick.
  I like Star Wars.  But it doesn't hold a candle to Trek in the warmth department.  Action, effects, yes.  Character, script, never.  (Although Empire rocks!)  And THAT is the strength of both Trek and this movie.  In spades.
  Buy it.  Wait for the sequel.  Now they can really do whatever the hell they want.  I can't wait.
  The new Enterprise looks great by the way.  And this review is for the film because the disc is a few weeks away yet...

3472915,5,B001AVCFJM,"After releasing ten films under the banner of `Star Trek', along with four television spin-offs, the novelty of this once proud brand name appeared to be wearing off. This in light of the fact that the latest entries for both mediums met with less than stellar critical and commercial success (""Star Trek: Nemesis"" and TV's ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" respectively). It seemed that perhaps the franchise and its audience needed a break, and possibly a fresh, new approach if it was to ever find success again. Which brings us to the here and now, the summer of 2009, seven years after the last feature film and four years since the last TV spin-off aired its final episode, and we finally have a new ""Star Trek"" film once more boldly going where no man has gone before. Under the care of wunderkind producer, writer and director J.J. Abrams (TV's ""Lost"" and ""Mission: Impossible 3""), along with screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (""Transformers""), the dormant franchise has been resurrected, returning it to bask in the glory of critical praise and commercial success, an achievement that has been absent from the franchise for quite some time.

""Star Trek"" focuses, once again, on the Federation starship Enterprise and its original crew of Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Sulu (John Cho), McCoy (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), and more. When a deadly new Romulan menace, led by a vengeful despot named Nero (Eric Bana), threatens the entirety of the Federation, Starfleet must rally its forces, including the recently completed Enterprise, to combat this alien danger before it's too late.

As a fan of the majority of the ""Star Trek"" films (aside from ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" and ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier""), and generally enjoying the direction the latter films had been taking (""Star Trek: Nemesis"" being my favorite entry thus far), I was a little unsure about the prospect of essentially restarting the franchise from scratch. However, since this approach has proven successful over the last few years with other franchises that I enjoy, for example the Batman and James Bond series', I thought that if in fact the well had run dry in regards to further adventures set beyond the events of the tenth film, then perhaps this decision may work out alright after all. Of course that success would all depend on who was going to be responsible for taking the series back to its roots, so to speak.

Let me say that any lingering doubts or concerns I had in regards to this film and its chances for success were quickly laid to rest when word was released that writer/director/producer J.J. Abrams would be helming this installment. Abrams had proven himself quite the capable writer and producer with his various television projects and screenplays, so I knew that he would most likely not sit idly by if the story was lacking in any way. Yet, it was his work helming the very entertaining, third ""Mission: Impossible"" film that gave me even greater faith in his ability to guide the Enterprise back into the spotlight once more.

On top of the fact that such a multi-talented person of J.J. Abrams' caliber would be directing the eleventh entry into the venerable series, was the announcement that the series would not only serve as a reboot of sorts, but it would still recognize the films that have come before it; instead of just ignoring them altogether which is what most of the reboots have done. Crafting this epic story was the writing duo of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Orci and Kurtzman, along with Abrams, were sensible enough to not only cater to the hardcore fans of the show and its subsequent movies and television spin-offs, but also make the story accessible to a whole new generation of moviegoers that may not have been previously interested in anything related to `Star Trek'.

The plot of ""Star Trek"" meets all the necessary criteria for the making of a massive summer blockbuster. Featuring plenty of drama, intensity, humor, incredible action and visual effects, and even a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure, this film has a little something for virtually every possible member of the audience. For the newcomers to the series, the story doesn't require you to have seen, or have any previous knowledge of the other films in the series. The film takes an appropriate amount of time to introduce you to all of the primary players in the film, giving them each their moment or two to shine. So, if you are unfamiliar with these iconic characters you soon won't be, once the incredibly fast-paced two hours of this film are through with you.

Now, don't fret any of you die hard fans out there that may not have seen this film yet, although I doubt there are all that many of you left that this statement could apply to at this point. There are plenty of insider references to previous events or famous quotes from your favorite characters for you to latch onto. Even though this film was made in a way that it could appeal to a much broader spectrum of the audience, it never faltered from supplying the core fan base with plenty of sci-fi goodness for them to embrace along the way. So, make no mistake, this entry into the ever-expanding Star Trek universe is a film that is completely deserving of carrying on the legacy of this epic series, and it never once loses sight of that responsibility.

Speaking of responsibility to the series' legacy, keeping these iconic characters alive is an all-new bunch of actors chosen to embody them in their younger years. This is no small feat when considering these roles were made famous many years ago by a talented and beloved cast of actors and actresses. Winning over the hearts and minds of new fans of the series shouldn't be all that hard for this cast; however, proving to the longtime fans of the franchise, some dating all the way back to the original series, may prove much harder to accomplish.

Leading the cast are two talented actors, Chris Pine (""Smokin' Aces"") and Zachary Quinto (TV's ""Heroes""), portraying the coveted roles of Kirk and Spock respectively. Chris Pine brings a normal speech pattern to Kirk, opting not to emulate William Shatner's pause-ridden pattern of speech; however, Chris did retain Kirk's sense of humor, arrogance, and no-quit attitude. His performance provides audiences with a new interpretation to the character while remaining true to the heart and soul of Kirk. For Zachary Quinto his portrayal of Spock was partially achieved before he ever read a single line of dialogue because he bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Leonard Nimoy (who had portrayed the character in the previous incarnation). Out of the entire ensemble cast, Quinto is probably the brightest spot in the group, as his performance is absolutely perfect for the character. Even though his performance so closely resembles that of his predecessor's, he never once ventures into the realm of imitation as so many other actors may have been tempted to do.

Supporting the two leads, is quite the gifted ensemble of actors and actresses ranging from Simon Pegg (""Hot Fuzz""), Karl Urban (""The Bourne Supremacy""), John Cho (Harold from the `Harold and Kumar' films), Zoe Saldana (""Vantage Point""), and Anton Yelchin (""Teminator: Salvation""). Simon Pegg brings a much more hilarious approach to the brilliant engineer known as Montgomery Scott, best known as Scotty, that some may find distracting due to his character being more stoic in previous appearances. However, since this film takes place at a time in the character's life that hasn't been explored, I for one view this as an acceptable revision. Karl Urban, much like Zachary Quinto, gives an almost pitch-perfect portrayal of Dr. McCoy. I found it interesting to see that as brilliant a doctor as McCoy was in the previous films, we get to see a slightly inexperienced version of him here, while he's still incredibly smart, he does make mistakes and isn't nearly as sure of his decisions as he is later on. John Cho and Zoe Saldana don't really get to break all that much new ground with their characters, Sulu and Uhura, yet the two young talents do get a few moments to shine within the film. Most notably for fans of the original series, the various hints to Sulu's sword fighting abilities are finally showcased allowing a new, more action-oriented side of the character to emerge. The only slight problem that I have with the casting is that perhaps Anton Yelchin was slightly mis-cast as Pavel Chekov. While he brings the character's trademark substitution of w's for v's out in almost every line of dialogue he has, he doesn't strike me as a good fit for the character. Even with that complaint, Anton did do a good job as Chekov; I just don't see him ever becoming the man we all know.

Rounding out the cast is veteran character actor Bruce Greenwood (""I, Robot"") and Eric Bana (""Hulk""). Bruce Greenwood portrays the original captain of this starship Enterprise named Christopher Pike. He's a seasoned veteran of Starfleet, who expects nothing but excellence from all who serve under his command. Greenwood's portrayal of Pike reminds me of Captain Kirk in the previous films, where he was much more reserved and in control of every situation, never willing to sacrifice others for a mission that he wasn't willing to undertake himself. As for Eric Bana who plays the vengeful Romulan known as Nero, he wasn't given a whole lot to do with the character other than appear menacing and bark orders. There were a few flashes of character development for him, but nothing so substantial as to make him appear any more or less dangerous than any other villain you would find in a `Star Trek' movie. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't make any mention of his presence in the film; Leonard Nimoy reprises his role of Spock once again. Surprisingly, Nimoy's appearance in the film isn't relegated to being a bit of stunt casting for a glorified cameo; instead, the presence of the much older Spock is integral to the movie's central plotline and provides some very fun moments within the film.

Over 40 years since the original series first introduced us to this enduring franchise, and despite a few rough patches of waning popularity over the last several years, J.J. Abrams' ""Star Trek"" restores the series to its former magnificence. With a great story, a terrific cast, and visual effects that are nothing short of incredible, ""Star Trek"" has become my new favorite entry into this series, removing ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" from the coveted position.

""Star Trek"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sexuality.",1248220800,13,10622,4.865671641791045
3472916,5,B001AVCFJM,"The way JJ Abrahms handled this prequel was pure genius. By using the plot device that he did, he eliminated the problem that the original Star Trek ended up with...being confined by the conventions and conditions it had built around itself over the years. If he chooses, he can now go where no Star Trek has gone before.

If you're a purist, you will probably have problems with this movie. If you're just a good ol' fan of the original series you'll probably love it like I did.",1248220800,7,480,4.454545454545454
3472917,3,B001AVCFJM,"It's interesting the reviews for this are either all raves (mostly from younger fans, although a few fans of the original series recognize its quality) or rants (mostly from people who felt there was no need to ""remake"" or ""reboot"" the original) and yet the truth of the matter is somewhere in between.

Make no mistake about it -- this is an extremely competent, well-made action film that will keep you entertained as long as action films are your thing.  The acting is first rate, and there are enough tributes to the original series and stars that it doesn't feel like they've forgotten their roots.

Indeed, my only problem with this film is that it takes about an hour before it gets past the cliches -- let's see, we have the boy who lost his father growing up into a rebel without a cause, who is damned if he will join the establishment, is hell bent on drinking and bedding any women of any color (including green) that comes along, and who only by chance decides to join the military to make a man out of himself.  And even there he cheats and rankles at authority until the end, when his rebelliousness actually saves the day. Oh, yes, and we also have two men who fight each other tooth and nail until they suddenly realize they are going to be the best of friends.  Never saw that one coming.  Sigh.

The early going by-the-numbers script was so predictable that we could have skipped it completely were it not for the excellent performances of such minor stars as Karl Urban (as Bones) who completely steals the show from both Kirk and Spock in the early going, and Simon Pegg (Scotty) who steals the show in the latter half.  It is the supporting cast that makes this fun to watch until the inevitable coming together of Kirk and Spock to form the greatest team in all of science fiction this side of Batman and Superman.

Oh, I'll buy the blu-ray when it comes out, and have fun rewatching it, but the REAL fun will come in about two years, when the obligatory sequel will be released and our cast and crew, newly minted, yet much as we have always known them, takes to the stars for what is sure to be a lot more excitement and action.  Until then, this will do.",1248220800,30,2180,4.4275

3472919,5,B001AVCFJM,"I was there when the first Stat Trek showed on TV with my kids watching intently.  I've seen it as long as they have filmed it though I must say, I wasn't into changing to new Generation, DS9, etc.  It took a while for me to warm up to the idea Shatner was there for only so long, and in the ensuing years I warmed to them all, but this!  This took me over the edge into a whole new world I cant really describe.  Im 72 and I am wowed by this film.

If you don't like it you are too jaded to simply look at an awesome movie and come out renewed.  All the characters, with the exception of Checkov were totally believable, Bones and Spock seemed spooned from identical replicas of the originals.  How cool is that?  I sure hope they bring them back for a couple more, these kids have it down to a fine science.  Please see this movie, and if you don't like it, you should move from the planet.",1248134400,4,892,4.0227272727272725
3472920,3,B001AVCFJM,"Even though I was a longtime fan of the old ST, I gave this one a chance.  It was a very good film (as the first in what will no doubt be a series).  All but one of the characters was spot on - McCoy was a delight (and in my opinion the best of a very talented cast).  My only beef with the character casting was Chekov.  The guy was WAY goofy, did not even attempt to look the part (unlike the others), and despite the actor's background seemed to come across as a Russian trying to play a Russian.  One can hope that when the next film is made they'll re-cast.

As for the movie itself, it was well thought-out.  The plot was a bit weak - understandable since we need to be introduced to everybody - but the execution was great.  At times we get a bit too much trivia thrown at us but that's OK, at least the filmmakers cared to include it for old trekkers like me.  Spock, both original and younger, are excellent.  We expect this from Nimoy, of course, but get Zachary Quinto as a bonus.  He was fortunate to have Nimoy since it allowed him to talk to the man who created the role while his fellow cast had to rely on film history.  Not that this is bad, since aside from Chekov the rest have their roles down pat.

Only two things bugged me, and I have to get them off my chest:  The Kobiashi Maru bit; we know Kirk cheated, but I've always felt he probably played it cool and just went in and rescued the ship.  Pine's Kirk acts the whole time like it's no big deal, way more smug then Kirk probably would have been.  The old Kirk would have been smug, yes, but most likely showing it after the test was over.

The second thing was the engine room of the Enterprise.  The rest of the ship looked good and futuristic, but why all the boiler-room pipes in the engine room?  I know that the payoff was having Scotty beam into the waterpipe, but at what expense? The whole set took away from the sense of reality and I felt hurt the picture.

All in all this is a fun, well made film that will be a welcome addition to my Star Trek catalog.  Even if you're an old trekker like me - see it!  It's the logical thing to do.",1248134400,4,2122,4.07487922705314
3472921,5,B001AVCFJM,"When I went to see Star Trek in theatres I originally gave it an awful review. Mainly due to, what I thought at the time, it's not remaining true to Gene Roddenberry's vision.

I had an opportunity to see the movie again and was able to analyze it more thoroughly than I did when I saw it in theaters. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that my original conclusions were mistaken.

Ultimately, there is so much that is right with Star Trek that after seeing it a second time it's flaws are not many and do not overshadow the greatness of this movie.

Star Trek centers on two main characters, Kirk and Spock, who are both united in the loss of one of their parents. Kirk with the loss of his father and Spock with the loss of his mother.

Yet it is the loss both men feel that initially holds them back. After being challenged Kirk ends up casting off his baggage to embrace the true leader that he is, while Spock learns to balance his Human-Vulcan traits.

Rather than being a disability Spock's being half human turns out to be his greatest strength and, like Kirk, learns to deal with his loss and get on with his chosen path of serving in Starfleet.

Like Chris Pine (Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock), the supporting characters are really good and passionate in their roles while each has a great sense of life.

Uhura (Zoe Saldana) is sexy and feminine but strong willed. Sulu (John Cho) has a good supporting role and (fortunately) is not limited to only being helmsman. Chekov (Anton Yelchin) is a youthful genius, while Scotty (Simon Pegg) is true to his original character as a miracle worker with humor to boot.

I loved Karl Urban as Leonard McCoy. I could see he put alot of time and effort into his portrayal of Bones in which he gave an admirable rendition.

The Spock-Uhura romance was a good idea too. I later realized that the script authors got this from the inter-racial kiss Kirk and Uhura shared in ""Plato's Stepchildren"". Originally, Uhura was to kiss Spock in the episode but producers at the time had her kiss Kirk instead.

Star Trek is very quick-paced. The reason why is that this version is mainly character-driven while trying to balance the need for special effects and story line.

I also concur with the observation of a review named Nick Farrantello who stated that throughout the film, the characters are faced with making important choices in their own lives.

In almost every scene of the film it is individuals (from Kirk to Spock to Nero) who weigh their options, choose their course of action and either come out ahead by embracing change or, like what happens with Nero, continue to be slaves to the past.

It is individuals who control their destiny. As Farrantello points out, people are not controlled by history and can change course at any time. That is the underlying theme of Star Trek.

I also loved the prominent role technology played too. Since Gene Roddenberry used Star Trek as his platform to champion science and space exploration, technology is essential for both fields and it is fitting technology is a central feature of his brainchild.

Technology, however, is not held as intrinsic. The usage of it, while glamorous, still shows how the characters' useage of technology to solve problems and achieve things. It is also the result of the usage of their logic and reason which is Star Trek's essence and the driving force of it's characters.

I discovered Star Trek while flipping through television channels as a kid and happened upon the episode The Doomsday Machine. After seeing it and the positive vision of the future it portrayed, I was instantly hooked.

I was also fortunate enough to have seen The Animated Series as part of my Saturday morning cartoon routine, saw all 6 films with the original cast and saw the first four seasons of The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager when they were broadcast on television.

Each series, like this new film, charted it's own bold course in it's own right.

J.J. Abrams and his associates have maintained Star Trek's essential elements in order to, hopefully, chart Star Trek to new voyages with new ideas.

Star Trek is not only a science fiction tale and culture, but also an exploration as to what it means to be an individual. It is a positive vision of the future and what mankind can achieve.

3472922,5,B001AVCFJM,"I am an average-level Trekkie.  I'll never buy Vulcan ears or a Starfleet outfit, but I do love the lore created by the Star Trek world.  After watching this once in the theatres and loving it so much, I watched again in the IMAX for the experience.  And then once more in a drive-in, for the drive-in experience.  Each time it was stupendous.

As a prequel to the original series (TOS), there is a lot of room to grow.  What we know of the characters is relatively minimal for such revered personalities.  This movie does a brilliant job of filling in the holes.

Starting with a catastrophe in the out-reaches of space that ends up resulting in the deaths of a starship, thereby setting up the genesis of James Tiberius Kirk.  In an antique car roaring down a dirt road in Iowa is where we next run into Kirk.  He's about 12 or 13, and already the precocious firebrand is developing into the risk-taking, love-making future leader of men, women, and alien races.  After initial brushes with the law, and a run-in with some Starfleet cadets at a bar, Kirk (Chris Pine) is challenged by Capt. Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and enrolls alongside the brawlers at the bar with hopes of living up to his father's image, and aspirations of command in just a few years.  Within mere minutes of boarding his very first vessel he runs into Bones (Karl Urban) - the absolute best actor in the movie.  (Speaking of the actors, what's great is that they don't try to be their own characters, they imitate TOS actors; and Urban does it impeccably).

The action is intense, with celestial skydiving, sword fights, phasers and photon torpedoes, and enough hand-to-hand combat for an avid UFC fan.  The score is magnificent; it thunders during the battles, and accentuates suspense during the drama aspects of the film.  The storyline is classic Star Trek, with the crew coming through in the crunch over and over again, with courageous actions and miraculous results, as they battle Romulans linked to Kirk's birth, and who have a grudge to settle with Spock along with seemingly every member planet of the federation.  And on top of all of that, there is an anonymous, voluptuous, green, female cadet in a bra and panties.

The most incredible aspect of this film is the acting.  It's superb all the way around.  Urban, as mentioned, is a brilliant Bones.  Pine is perfect as a young, brash Kirk.  Quinto does a superb job conveying the internal struggles of Spock.  Pegg is hilariously perfect as the genius engineer Scotty.  Cho is a competent shoe-in as Sulu.  Saldana is a great upgrade to the original Uhura in not only beauty but also brains.  Yeltin is also an improvement over the original Chekov, with a clever wit and funny accent, he brings a new life to the character.  And Bana is competent, if not a bit underwhelming, as the lead villain Nero.

I loved this movie and give it my highest possible recommendation.  It's quite probably the best movie I've seen in the last few years.  It is perfect for the Star Trek fan, respectful to TOS, and capable of standing on its own for the Trekkie neophytes.  Bravo, JJ Abrams; you've infused new life into the series with this gem, and I anxiously await the next in the series.",1248048000,3,3214,4.6453900709219855

The new characters resemble the old characters and revive their distinctive roles again while adding a more realistic and plausible sense of human nature that is what make us human beings in the first place.

J.J. Abrams & Co. have delivered a fine product.  There is a great sense of adventure that has been lost in Star Trek for some time.

There's a reason why this film has been rated so highly all across the board from 9/10 fans, to the general public and critics.  Don't miss out!  There is great emotion, humor, action, adventure.  This is one of the few prequels, ever, that actually feels ""right.""

If you are a non-fan, this is a great stand alone piece.  You needn't know anything about the Star Trek universe.

If you are a fan, your knowledge of Trek will not go to waste, however, paying attention is vital to understand how this fits into canon.

If I could make one adjustment, I would add back the Klingon scenes to fill out where Nero had been this whole time.  Perhaps J.J. doesn't understand that editing out vital pieces of information isn't the greatest idea, but this is still very worth it none the less.

Those who proclaim that the film has no substance or is ""Not Star Trek"" simply were either too distracted by the FX or don't understand Star Trek to begin with.

I came away thinking I wasted my money on the tickets and refreshments.  The director seemed to think that people like me and others that appreciate the quality of the original series and movies, have short memories and knowledge of what the characters were like.  What possessed the writers and the director to portray Kirk as some reckless, troubled boy?  Are all young people like that today?  Are they expected to be that way?  I expected Chekov to be young, but not that young!

The studio should have made this into a mini-series and explore each character individually, instead of spending millions of dollars on a movie.  I can't imagine this being in anyone's Star Trek movie collection.  The director did poor job in portraying the technology and sequence of events in relation to the original series.

3472930,3,B001AVCFJM,"we all know that this is the prequel to the original star trek series that dramatizes the early lives of the enterprise crew. from the birth of kirk through to him being made captain of the enterprise.

starting with the good bits - the characters were excellent, especially spock and bones. the early storyline was well done where it was explained where kirk got his self-opiniated rebellious behaviour from. there were even some funny bits, like where the russian (what's his name - forgot) is put in control of equipment that responds to voice command (funny, but not very believable). I liked the affair between spock and uhura.

so where does it go wrong? .. the storyline - basically kirk and spock grow up and join starfleet academy and become 2 of the best new recruits. because of kirk's personality he is left behind, but manages to sneak aboard the enterprise (brand new ship in the fleet) with the help of bones. the captain (pike) of the enterprise has to leave the ship and places spock in command. the captain doesn't come back and so spock captains the ship in an effort to maintain the plot. kirk doesn't like what spock is doing so he makes spock angry and spock resigns. there is a line about this point goes something like 'well done kirk, now we don't have a commanding officer'. [how big is the enterprise and how come only one person onboard ship was over 21?] so kirk takes command and defeats the bad guys through amazing feats of ingenuity and an outstanding young crew that went from being wet-behind-the-ears to learned professionals in the space of a few weeks. kirk is promoted to full captaincy of the enterprise and all charges are forgotten - the end.

the idea that a bunch of young cadets could take over command of the best ship in the fleet with no-one objecting .. especially the hundreds of people on board is a tad difficult to believe. the time travel episodes introduce too many ambiguities. please keep away from time travel unless you can describe the rules that explain what happens when the future changes.

3472931,3,B001AVCFJM,"I'm not a ""Star Trek"" fan; I'm a ""Star Wars"" fan, but I liked a few things from the original ""Star Trek"": the Talosian aliens, the ones that took Kirk and the other good guys captive and made them go into a breeding program to help their species survive, the Tribbles, the cute, furry, purring fluffballs that multiplied on Captain Kirk's ship, the Enterprise, and Spock, the really nice, Vulcan/human, pointy-eared alien. I saw the trailers for this ""Star Trek"" movie and I saw the villain, Captain Nero, the Romulan, weird-looking villain. Nero has pointy ears, is green, wears robe-like clothing, has a bunch of tattoos on his face, carries a spiked staff, and has and is the captain of a dark, black, jellyfish-like ship called the Narada. I think that he is a cool villain and is very weird-looking; he looks more like a combination of Lord Piccolo the Namek from the ""DragonBall Evolution"" movie, the Master Vampire, the bat-like vampire villain from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", and The Guardian of the Word/Caper from the ""Angel"" Season Four ""Peace Out"" episode of that vampire show spin-off, than anything else!

You will have to fumble an answer like: 'Well, son, a totally senile pointed-ear character chose to travel back in time and create a different timeline in which, for starters, planets Vulcan and Romulus have been annihilated.' That's right, folks, everything from the first timeline, of which you bought all the DVDs, has been irrevocably eradicated.

Furthermore, it clearly appears that in that second timeline, time itself moves at an incredibly accelerated rate. We could easily call it the dynamite timeline. It is a much more thunderous universe in which exploding events ceaselessly cascade into one another. No time for idle recollection here, folks. And not too much depth either.

I am in love with Spock all over again! Come to think of it, I kind of like Kirk this time around, too!

JJ Abrams and company have done Star Trek justice by making it possible for the sci-fi franchise to tell fresh new stories without trouncing on canon. The fact is, that this movie was the perfect reset button to bring us back to the original Star Trek, but rebooted for new audiences and new stories to tell without losing old Trek fans.

At the center of this drama is Nero (Eric Bana), a renegade Romulan with a mad-on for Ambassador Spock (Leonard Nimoy), whom he blames for destroying Romulus and killing his wife. Sounds a little like Khan, no? It's a little bit like that, but thankfully, there are some major differences.

It turns out that the incident that destroyed Romulus was an accident that creates a black hole, that sucks Nero's ship back in time - making it possible for him to exact the ultimate revenge: destroying the timeline and Vulcan along with it.
Nero destroys the timeline by killing George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth), the father of James Tiberius Kirk, on the day the latter was born. From that point on, while Kirk, Spock, McCoy and other characters we have come to know well have the same basic personality traits, the sequence of events in their lives is altered - for some, considerably.

Though Abrams et al has altered the Trek universe as we have known it, he retains the essence of the relationships and rapport between characters. Chris Pine beautifully plays Kirk as a brash, womanizing rebel without resorting to imitating William Shatner (with one delightful exception)- and yet he is believably Kirk. Karl Urban is pitch perfect and had some of the movie's funniest lines as the acerbic Dr. McCoy. Simon Pegg is hilarious as Montgomery Scott, and Zoe Saldana is luminous as the lingually-talented Uhura.

The standout performance, though, has to be that of Zachary Quinto, who plays the brilliant, conflicted young Spock facing possibly his weakest hour. Quinto, whose interpretation of Spock is somewhat different than Leonard Nimoy's, is both mesmerizing and very sexy as the half-Vulcan, half-human who rejects Vulcan anti-human bigotry, yet struggles to maintain his Vulcan-ness.

While the overall plot of the movie is weak, it is more than made up for by the backstories of the characters and the strength their relationships - even if they aren't what we expect them to be at first. What we get is a vivid, emotionally resonant, and ultimately satisfying movie that is likely to hook new generations of Trek fans.

Science fiction is my least favorite genre. I can say this: the acting was well done. I was surprised by how good they were. Bravo to the actors.

No, I'm not reviewing Nemesis. But the Earth threatened part is unique- right? Let's see - Star Trek I, II, IV, etc. Well at least the use of the time travel aspect is unique - ok we won't go there.

At least it keeps the Gene Rodenberry vision of Star Trek true - a future where mankind has cast away money and other less noble pursuits to venture into space as explorers seeking knowledge and other alien cultures. Anyone still got the impression that this was the culture behind this Star Trek - like from our first glimpse of Jim Kirk who trashes antique cars, bars and himself to prove he is just a misunderstood rebel who lost his father too soon and had to find a way to deal with life's injustices. The shallow and stereo-typical writing would not have James Dean turning over in his grave - he'd be puking in it. Instead of looking like a complex person wise before his years, James Kirk comes off a brash snot-nosed empty headed brat. Such stuff are heroes made of in this universe.

The rest of the characters aren't much better leading one to conclude they were written and assembled for one purpose - to attract a younger generation in a calculating and callous way. It's a shame that they think so little of thier audience that they figure they won't realise how empty and void this Star Trek universe is.

As for the movie, it's fine as long as you check your brain in at the door and overlook the huge plot holes. Let's see - Spock miscalculated and does not destroy the expanding star. Yeah that's happened before. Then how about going back in time (he's only done it a few dozen times already) and getting it right. If anything seems really forced for shock value, it was the destruction of Vulcan - as if this needed to happen to give this movie significance.

The ending was the real low point. To ask anyone to believe that an ensign with only one mission on a starship would be immediately promoted to captain - it makes me wonder just how well this version of Star Fleet functions.

In the end I prefer to think that there are many parallel universes out there. In one of them Spock blows up the star in time and Vulcan still exists as well as Gene Rodenberry's hopeful viewpoint of our future. I'll wait for a movie about that Star Trek.

A few final comments -
After watching the original series in blu ray I realized in this new universe none of this happens. If the writers have so little imagination that they could not figure out new ideas for stories in the original series universe, how long do you think it will be before this is true in this new less evolved universe. Already they are talking about revisiting The Wrath of Khan - so much for new directions.",1246752000,30,2858,4.401515151515151
3472940,5,B001AVCFJM,"Great Movie! The characters all tied in perfectly. The twist with Uhura and Spock will spark attention for several more movies to come.
One negative comment though; in the original series Chekov was a sex symbol, resembling the lead singer in the band the Monkeys. In this 2009 movie, Chekov was horrible, really horrible. I've been a fan of Star Trek for 43 years. I've enjoyed every Star Trek but Enterprise (too much talking - much like a soap opera). This 2009 movie is incredible except Chekov left me cold. Why didn't the producers think about the characters' appeal to women? The original Kirk was always too much of a womanizer. [This Kirk, so far, is very appealing.] Spock was unattainable but soooo worth the effort.  McCoy was sexy in his own right as was Scotty and Chekov.
They messed up completely with Chekov 2009. He's such a kid - no appeal to women. I wish they'd replace him but they probably won't. I seem to be the only commentator to notice.",1246665600,2,964,4.604651162790698
3472941,5,B001AVCFJM,"This Star Trek should serve as a template for any director making a multi-million dollar science fiction film.  In addition to special effects, this film has character development, humor, human failings, a plot, some coherence, suspense and so on.  Imagine how many other science fiction movies, including the previous Star Treks could benefit from including these things.

The cliches--and there are many--mostly have to do with the Star Trek franchise.  And that's fine.  Except for Spock's father (who, unlike Spock, went to Cambridge) this movie avoids the classically trained British actors and corny dialog.  Checkov probably should have gone to a language coach, though.

I think this Star Trek benefitted from being so family friendly.  I, for one, did not miss the state-of-the-art depiction of torture or parasitic disease.  To each his own.

There we found that differences in our attitudes went beyond a preference for beards.  Inexplicably, the RR staff of our ""goody"" universe won a drinking contest and the right to post its side of the Trek review first.  Review follows.)

THE GOOD UNIVERSE SAYS:
A Star Trek ""prequel"" movie has been in the works for years - offering us a glimpse of McCoy, Kirk, Spock & Scotty as they first met; Uhura finally getting her first name on screen, Checkov learning his www's, Kobayashi Maru, Orion girls and yet another iteration of Starship Enterprise.

The flick opens w/a bang.  Starfleet officer Kirk of the starship Kelvin sacrifices himself when his ship comes under attack by a much larger ship belonging to Romulans.  Among the survivors are Kirk's wife who marks the solemn moment by giving birth to a boy, James Tiberius.  Years later, JT is your typical thrill kill teen, who careens across the plains of Iowa in an antique Corvette, and then on a motorcycle.  He enjoys loud music, and destroying other people's property.  A few years later, after a chance meeting with Starfleet Captain Pike, an older Kirk is inspired to enlist with Starfleet.  We also meet young Spock, an outcast among Vulcan youths because of his maternal-human lineage.  (Vulcan devotion to logic, as The Animated Series demonstrated, never means you can't be racist.)  When an adult Spock learns that his half-human descent is also a bone of contention among the sage Vulcans of the vaunted Vulcan Science Academy, Spock turns down their offer to join them, decamping for Starfleet, and destiny.  A few years after that, Cadet Kirk finds himself facing expulsion from The Academy due to his cheating on The Kobayashi Maru - his accuser is the simulation's designer: Commander Spock.  Before that can be finalized however, Starfleet is mobilized to fend off an attack on planet Vulcan.  With the help of Leonard McCoy, Kirk weasels his way aboard the Enterprise, and finds himself embroiled in the continued conflict that began with his father's death year's earlier - one that bends time and space.  He meets an embittered Romulan named Nero (Eric Bana) and finds hints of his own future greatness.

SO HOW WAS IT?
(The Rotten Review of the Good Universe)
We loved it.  After slogging through torpid and high-minded TNG movies like ""Nemesis"" and having to endure different incarnations of what was basically the same show (TNG, Voyager, Enterprise) we thought Trek would never find a different direction.  The New Trek has gorgeous sets, brilliant and dynamic cinematography and refreshingly technobabble-free dialog.  Space, which had been reduced to the province of interstellar cruise ships in the era of ""The Next Generation"", is now refreshingly dangerous, alive with energy - ""The Final Frontier"" is back!!

Matchless visuals convey the velocity and mass of different ships, showing how widely the scale can change during interstellar encounters (as late as Nemesis, Trek could do no better than move spaceships from one side of the screen to the other, with their scale almost always fixed, always reminding us that we were looking at models, whether tangible or CGI).

A perfectly pitched script keeps the action flowing without stopping to remind the audience of the Trek universe's excess baggage.  The characters inhabit their roles w/o simply doing impressions of their more iconic selves.  We don't have to rely on all that Trekkie knowledge of the characters' back story - they're all in ""Undiscovered Country"" now.  We even get some interesting twists (eg - when Kirk loses ""the girl"" to somebody else).

The 21st century has seen other sci-fi franchises get a long deserved reboot, and Trek has finally gotten its chance.

BUT!!!!

THE ROTTEN REVIEW FROM THE EVIL UNIVERSE ASKS:

Do movies in your ""good universe"" get by without characters having unique motivation, without original stories or any story at all?

The new Trek movie suggests that to be the case.  Despite a bag of tricks and a 7-year gap since the last movie (not forgetting that the last movie was ""Nemesis""), the new Trek can't cover up the fact that it's not really about anything, going through the motions typical for franchise-prequels, giving us back story we already knew about, and using as its main plot (an embittered alien out for revenge) an idea already old hat in Trekdom.  It's the Trek Movie About Nothing.  With my 6 year old sitting next to me (in our evil universe, tickets and popcorn are free if you bring children along) I kept worrying that he'd grow board, wondering when the story would start.  I then realized that the story HAD started, having snuck up on me (the script comes with its own cloaking device).

Nothing much happens, and the story never really connects the dots in a meaningful way - BAD Romulans appear and Starfleet mobilizes against them.  Kirk is the son of a hero, but he starts off as a reckless teen with no plans for the future.  He's the last guy who you'd see joining Starfleet - then he ends up going to the academy anyway; the whole wayward youth part of his life proves so irrelevant to his future, that the only reason the story includes it is to have the obligatory ""bar fight"".  Captain Pike notes that Kirk's aptitude is off the chart - we have to be told that because he does nothing else to demonstrate that, and if we didn't know of Captain Kirk we'd wonder why the story has any interest in him at all.  It's not so much that he doesn't think according to the book - the story doesn't have him thinking that much at all and, except for some great fight scenes, doesn't so much of anything.  He's bold & beautiful, and that's all that matters.  Years of joking-yet-cautionary blogging about jumpstarting the Franchise with what amounted to ""Dawson's Trek"" don't seem so funny now.  Our colleagues in the good universe have it half-right - the new movie happily proves you can do Trek in a way that's nothing like TNG; unfortunately it also proves that you can be unlike TNG and blow just as badly.

The script does junk TNG-style technobbable, but only for a lighter version of it.  Set design is a mixed bag: the new bridge is a testament to the hyper-advanced state of cybernetics we can expect of the future - which only makes the engineering spaces more jarring.  The engines that drive huge starships of the future across vast tracts of space appear as technologically advanced as the factory floor for Anheuser Busch.  It's safe to say that the producers probably saw this as some kind of limited experiment: like that nuclear reactor hidden behind the squash courts of the University of Chicago, or those rocket test planes which were designed only to exceed a certain speed - just prove it can work, and nothing else.  As with most things in Hollywood, there's more technological sophistication, which is why we have sequels to do the job expected of a single film from our savage past.

AND NOW THE FINAL WORD by guest Rotten Reviewers visiting from...another franchise.

The new Star Trek is consistently good fun from first frame til last, if undemanding of your attentions.  The story requires little prior knowledge of Trek, so you can take it in with a ragtag group of friends and have a Frakkin good time.  It's not perfect, but then, no flick is.  SO SAY WE ALL!!!!",1245801600,2,7523,4.82307092751364
3472946,4,B001AVCFJM,"The two hours I spent watching ""Star Trek"" was the best time I've had, in the theatre or anywhere, for a good long while.  I do not consider myself a Trekker by any stretch of the imagination, but what attracts me to ""Star Trek"" are not the plots or the gadgets, but the characters that inhabit the bridge of the USS Enterprise.  And what characters these are. The central friendship between the very human loose cannon Capt. James Tiberius Kirk and his half-Vulcan, buttoned-down first officer is the centerpiece of this world and the beating heart of everything else that goes on on the Enterprise.  Butch had his Sundance Kid; Matthau had Lemmon--these two have each other.  JJ Abrams found two young and relatively obscure actors who pay homage to their esteemed predecessors by channeling their unique energies without exactly aping them,  and who at the same time manage to bring something fresh to this classic pairing for a new generation of fans.
Chris Pine is quite the find as the youthful Kirk, a naturally-brilliant cadet  whose academic career has been derailed by his propensity for chasing women and getting into bar fights.  He has perhaps the trickier job of suggesting his predecessor without lapsing into parody than Zachary Quinto has channeling Spock.  Without resorting to William Shatner's imminently parody-licious  staccato delivery and other physical quirks, Pine, with his direct blue gaze still conveys Kirk's directness, recklessness and what Roger Ebert called his ""Falstaffian lust for life.""  He still feels a bit too immature and inexperienced to be captaining a Starfleet vessel; indeed, the entire cast is young, making this feel at times like the ""Bugsy, Jr."" version of Star Trek.  In this version, the entire crew of the new Starship Enterprise has been plucked from their studies at the Starfleet Academy and hastily commissioned to go to war with the Romulan menace posed by Eric Bana's Nero.  These are not seasoned officers, though Spock and Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban, drolly channeling DeForrest Kelley in a spot-on impersonation) are presented as slightly older than the rest of these space kids.  The eldest crew member, engineer Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott appears late--Simon Pegg doesn't look anything like James Doohan but his thick brogue is even more cheerfully incomprehensible.  In one update more in keeping with today's Cineplex sensibilities than Gene Roddenberry's original vision, Commander Spock has a romantic (and reciprocated) attachment to his former student/very junior officer Uhura, played by Zoe Saldana as if she might be auditioning for a Charlie's Angels in Space movie.  She's cute enough to stir the most repressed male passions, but Nimoy's Spock would deem this openly demonstrative physical relationship with a female subordinate `highly illogical', never mind inappropriate.
As serviceable as everyone else is, I think Quinto's is the standout performance here.  We first meet Spock as a child genius on his home planet, where he is bullied daily at school for his maternal parentage.  Spock's human heritage had been often referred to but never fully explored before; insulting his mother is the stoic Spock's one Achilles heel, and the one thing guaranteed to make him lose control.  Quinto bears a striking resemblance to the young Leonard Nimoy, and rocks the ears, the eyebrows and the Vulcan bowl cut even better, making them actually quite sexy.  He cuts a tall and elegant figure on the bridge.  A bridge that was his until he gave away his command for what he saw as emotionality unbecoming an officer.  Hence, the raw and rambunctious cadet Kirk becomes Captain Kirk.  Along the way we watch these two temperamental opposites bicker and snipe and detest each other on their way toward becoming lifelong soul/space buddies.  No doubt a sequel, first of many in this new franchise, is on the way.  With Pine and Quinto on the deck, it should be a voyage worth strapping ourselves in for.",1245715200,4,3982,5.109567901234568
3472947,5,B001AVCFJM,"I grew up with ""Star Trek:  The Next Generation.""  Since I didn't have cable, I rarely got the chance to watch the original Star Trek series.  As I grew older, however, I got to watch TOS and found myself preferring it to TNG.  It didn't matter how many new incarnations of Star Trek hit the television or the big screen, so long as no one messed with the original characters and the actors who portrayed them, I was fine.

Then comes along J.J. Abrams.

I have to admit that I followed the developments of the latest, re-imagined ""Star Trek"" film quite closely.  I had my doubts about what could be done to the characters and the storyline.  When it was finally announced that the new film would be one of the first big summer flicks out of the gates in 2009, a part of me cringed whilst another part of me flooded with joy.  I was excited to see a new Trek, but I was also worried about how screwed up it might be.

Fellow Trekkers rest easy.  J.J. Abrams has pulled off a near-perfect film here.  He's taken the best parts of TOS and blended it into a storyline that pays homage to the original show but also leaves the characters open to entirely new adventures.

In the film, a rogue Romulan named Nero (Eric Bana) has a bone to pick with Spock.  In order to exact revenge on Spock, Nero and his allies travel back in time and literally split history into two pieces when they change a key event.  With this new timeline in place, we get a chance to watch old friends develop under new circumstances.

We get to see Kirk, Spock, Bones, and the rest of our favorite crew develop and grow in an entirely different (yet always familiar) setting.  Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban have, quite possibly, the biggest shoes to fill in this film.  Pine does a wonderful job as Kirk.  He has all of the William Shatner Kirk's swagger and many of his mannerisms as well.  Quinto does an excellent job as Spock, although his version of Spock is placed into a much more emotionally challenging situation and thus we get a much more emotional Spock.

Of all the actors taking over these classic roles, Karl Urban stands above them all.  He simply nailed the character of Dr. McCoy.  From Bones' famous ""I'm a doctor, not a (insert any other occupation here)"" to his grumpy attitude, Urban seems to have channelled DeForest Kelley for this role.

The space battle action is taken up quite a few notches under Abrams' guidance.  While Shatner's Kirk was oftened restrained by his crew (and the show's budget), Pine's version gets to go wide open most of the time.  The special effects look excellent in this film and do not deter from the storyline.

So what didn't this new Trek get right?  While Nero is a good villain, he isn't a great one.  Much like a lot of the baddies in the Trek universe, Nero just doesn't stand out from the pack.  I'm not knocking Bana's performance, I just think that the character could have developed a bit more.

Also, the film gives a nod to the re-imagined ""Battlestar Galactica"" by using jittery, in-focus/not-in-focus camera work.  While the technique works well some of the time, I find it a bit annoying while watching the film.  Some would argue that the camera work adds to the ""realism"" of the action going on.  This works in a film like Abrams' ""Cloverfield,"" but when you're dealing with Star Trek, I prefer to see as much of the battle happening as I can.

Other than these two points, I loved the film.  It was funny, exciting and dramatic all at the same time.  It was also nice to see such wonderful characters get polished off a bit and ready for a whole new set of adventures.

If you enter the film with an open mind, you'll leave knowing that although this is a ""new"" Star Trek, it's still the same old Enterprise.  Highly recommended to fans of any form of Star Trek.

""The Enterprise looks to high tech""  Really?  Would have been better with dials and switches?  Come on people!

To me the BEST THING about ""New Trek"" is the fact that the back ground characters who always were kept in the background are each given more than a few chances to shine.

Chekov TWICE saves the day.  Sulu saves Kirk's butt on the plateform and cracked me up when he first toook over flying the Enterprise.  Uhuua is smart, strong (*OK, and beautiful!).  And Scotty was great!

OBVIOUSLY this is a new Trek, the time line changed thus so did a lot.

Urban's McCoy was DEAD ON!  Spock was GREAT!  Kirk was GREAT!

Again, yes being a new timeline things are goin to be different but obviously they have to be.  (*Again do I have to say ""switches and dials""?)

If there were a fourth choice, I'd take it.  I haven't enjoyed myself so much at a Star Trek movie since ""The Wrath of Khan,"" and this is far funnier, more sophisticated, and infinitely more exciting.  It's got everything: gorgeous talented cast filling each role to perfection; a clever plot; literate thrilling script; and special effects that don't overpower the story the way the do almost everything else you see these days. Though the ensemble is great,  At its heart, it's a space bromance between Spock and Kirk and absolutely riveting all the way through.

3472951,3,B001AVCFJM,"First the good.  The resurrection of the original characters from the first Star Trek series is incredibly well done.  This movie does a tremendous job in filling out and expanding the characters from the original series in a thoughtful and respectful way, except for the completely gratuitous love affair between Spock and Uhura that so many others have commented on.  That's nothing but a complete slap in the face to any fan of the original series.

Secondly, most of the sets, uniforms and overall feel of the movie fit in with the original series.  I don't know what it is about the Star Trek franchise, but every time it bounces back and forth between TV and the big screen, someone feels an overwhelming urge to change the uniforms.  It was nice to see the original uniforms pretty much unchanged from the original series.

Lastly, most of the action scenes were fairly enjoyable to watch.  Not overly drawn out, but fairly fantastic all the same.

Now for the bad.  I've already mentioned the putrescent love affair between Spock and Uhura, but whoever thought that up really needs to be publicly executed at the halftime of the next Super Bowl.  It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen in any Star Trek based show, and that's saying a lot.

Secondly, the plot is completely unbelievable.  In order to enjoy any piece of fiction, especially science fiction or fantasy, a suspension of belief is necessary.  However, the work must be internally consistent, and this film falls far short of that.  I'm not talking about the gist of the plot here, however, where an evil Romulan goes back in time to get revenge on Spock by destroying the Vulcan homeworld.

I'm talking about the fact that somehow, Kirk, Spock, Uhura, and McCoy end up in their senior positions on the most advanced starship in Starfleet ten minutes after leaving the Academy.  That just doesn't make a whit of sense.

But let's not let a minor detail like that get in the way of making oodles of box office cash this summer.  Just make sure you leave your brain at home, and you'll probably enjoy this movie.",1245024000,2,2079,4.7091412742382275

Star Trek is notorious for changing timelines - Tasha - dead, alive, returned to earth per birth.  So come on.  Time is always relative.

Spock did everything he could to ensure he and Kirc became the friends they were meant to be.  McCoy's character was by far, in my opinion the best, too.

Anyway, the long/short.  We know the entire history now of Kirc, Spock and McCoy, but now we can relive it anew/fresh with the slate completely clean.  I think it was a great idea.  As old fans we can experience our favorite (I'm an old guy) characters all over again without saying - wait the Romulans didn't do that - well, now the writers are free to explore strange new worlds and new civilizations and boldly go where the crew has never gone before....

3472957,5,B001AVCFJM,"I don't give out 5 stars very often, usually just to classics, and whether or not STAR TREK becomes a classic is yet to be determined. Yet, STAR TREK may just be one of the most entertaining, complete experiences I've had at the movie theatre in a long time. In the least, it's most likely the best summer movie of 2009 and it's certainly one of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time. Loaded with intelligence, creativity, adrenaline and doesn't do what most summer movies think they have to do... ridiculous over-the-top stuff.

You pay for the bloated egos of Hollywood everytime you fork out a 1/2 days work at the box office and you can only hope that you won't be disappointed. With STAR TREK... you won't.

The best part about STAR TREK is that they have refurbished it, updated it, classed it up, legitamized it and all the while, the actors pay complete homage to the original stars. Chris Pine (James T. Kirk) embodies the cockiness and swagger that was perfected by William Shatner. Even his speaking style makes it completely seamless and effortless trying to make a connection with the new face of Kirk. The same goes with the entire cast, including Zach Quinto (Spock).

I have to snicker a little bit, as an old Star Wars fan who overlooked Star Trek. George Lucas got it horribly wrong when he threw away all the models and real set locations, robbing his new films of their realism by CGing them to death and thinking that old fans would appreciate the new 'its for Kids' approach.

J.J. Abrahms, Paramount and the entire team behind STAR TREK hit the bullseye with everything they did and they did Gene Roddenberry proud. Now, we can only hope that the way the movie unfolded, that more is to come. Were Pine & Quinto prepared to be Kirk & Spock for more than just one movie? I guess we'll see.",1244592000,2,1808,4.53680981595092
3472958,5,B001AVCFJM,"That's all that needs to be said without giving anything away...except that Chris Pine is soooo much better than William Shatner (and this from someone who used to watch the old series regularly in syndication as a kid), and that Zachary Quinto is fantastic at giving us a glimpse of the human/Vulcan struggle within his soul.  I loved this movie - it was so beautifully lensed and smartly written!",1244505600,2,398,4.768115942028985
3472959,4,B001AVCFJM,"It's a little-known fact that none other than Lucille Ball is responsible for the birth of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B001DHXT6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>. As the titular head of Desilu Studios in the 1960's, she green-lit former LA cop Gene Roddenberry's idea of an intergalactic western and championed the series during its brief three-year run on NBC. It is amazing to consider how the franchise continues to thrive 43 years later, so much so that director J.J. Abrams (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B0019LY5IM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>) and screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have been able to re-imagine the legacy of the series without sacrificing the fidelity needed to satisfy the throngs of rabid fans who pushed the grosses north of the $200 million mark in its first week of release. As someone who is not remotely a Trekker, I have to admit the creators have done a fine job of reincarnating the familiar characters into their youthful counterparts and concocted an engaging, time-traversing plot that smartly avoids heavy exposition in favor of action and pyrotechnics. The result can be sometimes mind-numbing and trivial, but the 122-minute movie is never dull.

The densely populated plot throws us forward to the year 2233 (or backwards depending on your perspective on ""Star Trek"" lore) as the USS Kelvin confronts a major alien vessel captained by an embittered Romulan named Nero. An alternate timeline is revealed, and inevitable tragedies ensue. Years later, we meet the familiar characters from the TV series culminating in the USS Enterprise's maiden voyage. James Kirk is a cocksure hothead with obvious Starfleet Academy potential, but he is haunted by the father he never knew. The half-human, half-Vulcan Spock is a brilliant student-turned-control freak by his nature but sometimes unable to reconcile the two sides of his identity. Their initially hostile relationship provides much of the film's spark, as they one-up each other in face a common enemy in Nero. This provides a good excuse for the CGI-enhanced action sequences with a plethora of explosions and characters zooming in and out of frame. By the time you start to feel the excess and redundancy in this approach, the story wraps the viewer up in its core ethos - that the Enterprise crew is an extended rainbow coalition of a family even as entire civilizations are destroyed.

Abrams and crew are smart enough to recognize that the movie has to capture the heart of the original series in a way that doesn't patronize fans yet engage us non-Trekkers. Most of the casting choices are solid, although a couple of them are rather distracting. With the lightweight veneer of a tween idol, Chris Pine captures the braggadocio and roughhewn manner of a youthful Kirk in a way that tethers him to Shatner's real-life personality without doing an outright imitation of the elder actor. Even better is Zachary Quinto who has little latitude to vary Spock from fan expectation, yet he brings subtle but palpable currents of humanity to his stoic character. The rest of the crew is painted in broader strokes with Karl Urban coming closest to caricature as ""Bones"" McCoy; Anton Yelchin, laying on a thick, Cold War-era Russian accent as the extremely young Chekhov; and Simon Pegg (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hot-Fuzz/dp/B000RJO578/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hot Fuzz</a>) pulling out all the comedy stops as exiled engineer Scotty. Somewhat more subtle are Zo Saldana (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guess-Who/dp/B0009RCPUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guess Who</a>) as linguist specialist Uhuru, who has a surprising relationship with Spock, and John Cho (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harold-and-Kumar-Escape-From-Guantanamo-Bay/dp/B0017ANAX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay</a>) showing that he can handle action sequences with dexterity as neophyte helmsman Sulu.

Covered with latex, Eric Bana is hardly recognizable as Nero, although he makes the most of his character's stock vengeance motives. It's genuinely odd, however, to see Tyler Perry (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madea-Goes-to-Jail/dp/B001WAKOX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madea Goes to Jail</a>) as the head of the Starfleet Academy and especially the still-doe-eyed Winona Ryder trying to look maternal as Spock's human-side mother.

Visually, it doesn't disappoint with Daniel Mindel's dazzling, kinetic cinematography and Scott Chambliss' creative production design that mixes retro and futuristic elements seamlessly. At the same time, the convenient timeline jumble doesn't really give rise to any complex moral quandaries beyond the importance of building friendships and trusting your colleagues. Nonetheless, the movie is propulsive entertainment which doesn't tamper with its genesis and focuses squarely on the humanity of the familiar characters.

3472962,5,B001AVCFJM,"This is a fresh and fantastic film that cuts through the tired old Star Trek paradigm that made for routine disasters at the theaters.

J.J. Abrams was wise to not follow the Star Trek canon established by the select few, moms basement dwelling fans that are even as I am writing this wasting hours of their life calculating the exact dimensions of the imaginary Enterprise shuttle bay based on CGI and models from the film. (I saw this exact discussion in Star Trek 2009's forums - the fools were trying to figure it out in yards as opposed to using the metric system. sigh...)

This is a fresh, fun, witty film with fun dialogue and sub plots. Everything is new down to the well cast crew and colorful Enterprise packed with hot babes in star fleet uniforms. The ship is sleek and looks, feels, fast and new. The score has been remastered and the intro is fantastic. I finally feel that a movie has been mad that appeals to a larger audience.  Hopefully gone are the troubled days of Voyager, DS9, and Enterprise.

The film establishes Kirk's origins and spins the audience off into an alternate time line.  (And lets face it.  The future Star Trek was getting boring and scary in Star Trek anyways.., err everyone remember Patrick Stewart salsa dancing in ST: Insurrection???)

Ya, not this crew.  Besides being sarcastic and willing to get into fist fights at every turn not including hitting on women and rolling eyes at each other every time a pompous comment is made on screen, the crew works well together.

I recommend watching this film in theaters and buying the DVD.  I anticipate the sequel as well.

3472963,5,B001AVCFJM,"Hollywood's current ""it"" director JJ Abrams, best known for his television shows, ""Lost"" and ""Alias"" and the film, ""Cloverfield"", takes the helm of the new Star Trek movie, rebooting the franchise in a very successful manner. Taking aim at last week's number one movie, ""Wolverine: X-Men Origins"", Abrams new film will most likely supplant Jackman's film at the top of the box office heap. Even President Obama, apparently a Star Trek fan, is asking for a viewing of the highly anticipated summer film at the White House.

With a cast of youthful actors led by Chris Pine as Captain James T. Kirk (looking like he stepped out of an Ambercombie ad), the familair faces of the Trekkie universe are given a much needed rush of youthful adrenaline and appeal for a new generation of fans. Pine does well as Kirk, a womanizing and extremely independent young man who finds purpose as a Starfleet cadet. Uhura (played by the alluring Zoe Saldana) and McCoy (Karl Urban) are introduced early on as well as Sulu (Harold and Kumar's John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin). Of course the pivotal and important role of Spock is played by Zachary Quinto of NBC's ""Heroes"" fame. He steps easily and comfortably into the role made famous by Leonard Nimoy, who much to the pleasure of diehard fans, appears in the film as well. Other interesting cameos or supporting roles include Wynona Ryder as Spock's human mother, Ben Cross as Sarek, his Vulcan father and more surprisingly, Tyler Perry (the Madea movies) as a high ranking leader at Starfleet Academy. Eric Bana (Hulk, Munich, Troy) is vicious as Nero, the disillusioned Romulan who is determined to take his vengeance on Spock and all of the planets in the Federation.

But the brunt of the film's success lies on the shoulders of Abrams, whose story telling must draw fresh viewers who haven't seen the previous films or television programs while pleasing the dedicated fans of Roddenberry's original vision. He admirably marries the new with the old, creating a film full of action that will please those craving a high octane summer film yet staying true to the beloved characters in the franchise. This origin of the young Kirk and the genesis of his Starfleet career preps the launch of a re-energized Star Trek film series and is bound to have a huge opening weekend. Abrams is definitely living up the his hype as a director, producing and directing both entertaining film and television programs.

JJ Abrahams has done that, here.

Instead of making the characters up from whole cloth ala&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation/dp/B000RZIGVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a>, he imagines how James T Kirk, First Officer Spock, et al first find themselves on The Enterprise and why.

""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban) gives away the origin of his nickname. We see The Enterprise launch for the first time. This is both an emotionally and visually stunning film, with sets and sights played to the original Star Trek and to modern science fiction mythology.

And what a job they do. The cast is spot on in reinterpreting their characters that we all know they'll be back for. Quinto in particular is amazing as Spock, easily imaginable as Leonard Nimoy's young doppelganger. Eric Bana is great the villain, a Romulan miner seeking revenge for the destruction of his home planet at the hands of the Vulcans. The movie cruises at warp-speed, refusing to allow any kind of time-drag to occur or sub-plots (of which there are several) to become dead weight. There's enough light humor and references to the original series to make the most die-hard of fans happy. Most importantly, the entertainment value is sky-high.

3472965,4,B001AVCFJM,"Many things have already been said about J. J. Abrams' new ""Star Trek"" film and as far as critics go, most of them are positive ones including some raving reviews. Before watching the much anticipated film, I was skeptical. And I was wrong. The new feature film succeeds in not only rebooting the Paramount's hugely popular series, but becoming a great staring point for the new chapters that will be seen in the future. The ""odd-number"" theory is officially disproved.

The film opens with thrilling and very emotional introductory sequences about James T. Kirk's father, who was ""captain of a starship for twelve minutes"" and saved 800 lives. Then we are introduced to young Kirk (Chris Pine) himself leading an aimless life until one day he speaks with a Starfleet captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) in a bar. Ambitious and rebellious, James T. Kirk impulsively joins the Academy. Three years later a Romulan spaceship attacks the Federation ships and he and the other crew of the Enterprise - Spock (Zachary Quinto), McCoy (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Chekhov (Anton Yelchin), and Scottie (Simon Pegg)

The film can be enjoyed by the uninitiated and the fans (well, most of them, I think) alike, with spectacular visuals and those interesting and likable characters you can relate to. The script (by Abrams and co-screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman) gets sometimes complicated and even confusing (to allow for the inclusion of Leonard Nimoy, his first appearance on screen since 1991), but manages to keep us interested. I admit it is not very intelligent, but still entertaining.

Lastly I add this. I belong to the generation watching ""The Next Generation"" and the re-runs of the original TV series. I am a fan of the series, maybe not a very big fan, but I know there are lots of gaps and plot holes regarding the new film's story, internally and in connection with the timeline of the original series. So the storyline and the details might bother you.

I couldn't wait to see the new Star Trek movie.  I looked forward to seeing other actors playing the original roles and felt that it was such a compliment to the original cast for their roles to be reproduced 40 years later.

I have heard many reviewers say that the complex continuity that has been developed throughout the years was too restrictive and had to be eliminated.  Well, all I can say is that I have quite a lot of respect for writers.  A good writer would have been able to come up with a script that would hold the interest of the old and new fan.  In fact, the first half of the movie proves that is possible.  My impression is that the assassination of THE Star Trek universe was very deliberate.  The director and writers went out of their way to tell original Trek fans to go to hell.  The director, in so many words, told trekkies to ""stay home and skip this one"".  It was very deliberate.  I guess he felt that by tossing original Trek fans overboard, they would make more room for the new ones.  But the Star Trek Universe is big, and frankly I think there was enough room in that universe for the old and the new fans.  I think J.J. never really grasped the size of the Trek Universe.  A MESSAGE TO PARAMOUNT: With the TRUE Star Trek Universe erased from existence, I think it would be useless to spend any more money on the franchise.  After all, what good is it to own the Star Trek movies on blu-ray if the events in those movies never took place.

Well, all I can say is that I have quite a lot of respect for writers.  A good writer would have been able to come up with a script that would hold the interest of the old and new fan.  In fact, the first half of the movie proves that is possible.  My impression is that the assassination of THE Star Trek universe was very deliberate.  The director and writers went out of their way to tell original Trek fans to go to hell.  The director, in so many words, told trekkies to ""stay home and skip this one"".  It was very deliberate.  I guess he felt that by tossing original Trek fans overboard, they would make more room for the new ones.  But the Star Trek Universe is quite big, and frankly I think there was enough room in that universe for the old and the new fans.  I think J.J. never really grasped the size of the Trek Universe.  A MESSAGE TO PARAMOUNT: With the TRUE Star Trek Universe erased from existence, I think it would be useless to spend any more money on the franchise.  After all, what good is it to own the Star Trek movies on blu-ray if the events in those movies never took place.  The same goes for novelizations, collectibles, etc.  I wonder if the new fans will be as eager to spend their money on your alternate franchise.",1244073600,57,2527,4.296610169491525
3472968,3,B001AVCFJM,"I'm a big Star Trek fan as well as a fan of good science fiction in general.  Going into this movie, while I was encouraged by the trailers, I did so with a degree of trepidation because I really do love this franchise and I really didn't want this movie to suck like the last few have.

Much to my relief, it doesn't.  But, much to my disappointment, it's not actually great either.  It's decent, to be sure, but in terms of plotting, character interplay and sentimentality, it's a poor imitation of the original six films.  It's Star Trek lite.  It's Iron Man, as opposed to say, The Dark Knight.  Or, perhaps, Tom Cruise's original Mission Impossible film as opposed to the Mission Impossible TV Show.  It's creative, its flashy, and its splashy. But because it has sacrificed so much intelligence to attract a broader audience, it really doesn't deserve all the accolades it's getting.  Because lets face it, in several respects, it's actually glaringly deficient.

First and foremost is plotting.  The plotting really isn't very cerebral, certainly not as much as you'd expect from something under the Gene Roddenberry name.  Now, before you jump on me, let me clarify.  I'm not saying that I would have preferred long periods of dialog in which characters spoke in treknobabble for ten minutes.  I'm just saying, I would have liked it if the plot had made some semblence of sense.  And... frankly, it didn't.  For example, in a quick series of events, Kirk breaks regulation after regulation, including committing mutiny, and is relieved of command.  Then, all he has to do to get that command back is to make Spock wig out.  That just doesn't make any sense, and neither do many other elements of the plot, such as the convenient presence of both Spock and Scotty on the same iceteroid in the middle of nowhere.

One of the things I liked about the original series of films was that, even at their worst, they were intelligent, serious and sentimental.  The plot proceeded somewhat believably from A to B to C.  In contrast, this film is occasionally sentimental, vaguely intelligent and irritatingly unserious.  Most stressful is the crass new Kirk, who is far too sexually aggressive and immature to make me feel like he would make a good leader.  He completely lacks the legitimate charisma of the Shatner Kirk (There, I said it.  Shatner was a good actor, especially in the films) and his behavior is more reminiscent of an angsty teenager, which seems kind've inappropriatte considering these characters are all supposed to be military officers, and the cream of the crop, at that.  In the end, despite the better special effects, it's just not as realistic as the version Roddenberry pioneered.  Who is responsible for this new tone?  I don't know.  Perhaps I should assign blame to the MySpace generation's short attention span.  Or to the producers.  Or to Abrams.  I don't know.

Truthfully, I enjoyed this film.  It spins an interesting yarn, looks really good, and takes the familiar Star Trek universe in a ballsy new direction.  But as hard science fiction (and despite what anyone else tells you, Star Trek IS hard science fiction) this movie is mediocre/good.  Its fun to watch, but it's not Star Trek as I recognize it.",1243900800,,3242,4.811594202898551
3472969,4,B001AVCFJM,"GOOD: The special effects! The Enterprise was gorgeous (I loved all the beauty shots, such as when the ship rises out of the mist), and I loved feeling the BOOM in my chest when the ship went into warp (this is why you should see the movie in a theater). The visual and sound effects were the real stars of the movie. My favorite moment in the film is when the Enterprise shows up, guns blazing, for the final confrontation with Nero's ship. It's simply awesome to watch the fireworks - I only wish the battle wasn't so short.

Also good - Karl Urban's portrayal of Dr. McCoy was excellent. I wish there was more of him. Quinto did a pretty good job of Spock, considering that he had to share the screen with the real deal. I loved the homages to various things from the Original Series - Sulu's fencing, for example. Oh, speaking of Sulu, I liked the way his character was portrayed and expanded a little bit. He was my least favorite character in the Original Series, but he's fun in this movie. Chekov was pretty funny with the over-the-top accent (it's interesting how they turned him into a Wesley Crusher character, i.e., a teenage genius, but without making him annoying because his accent is so goofy). Finally, I loved the way Chris Pine says ""Bones!"" right at the end of the film - he said it just right. it's the only time he channels William Shatner, and it made me smile.

NOT GOOD: A few things - these didn't ruin the film for me by any means, but to be fair, I should point out the negatives as well as the positives. First, the biggest thing that didn't make sense at all was Kirk being made captain of the Enterprise at the end of the episode - he's a cadet! It takes years and years to become a captain (just ask Commander Riker, haha). In fact, it was pretty unbelievable that Pike suddenly made Kirk the first officer when he wasn't even supposed to be on the ship. It would be believable (though odd) if they made Spock a captain - after all, he's already a commander and he's the one who drew Nero's ship away from Earth by flying away in Old Spock's little ship. It seemed really contrived and unbelievable for Kirk to become captain that easily. Give him a medal. Maybe skip ahead a few years and show him becoming captain. That would make sense and wouldn't hurt the film at all.

Second, Spock and Uhura. I'm rewatching the Original Series and I can definitely notice a flirty relationship between Uhura and Spock (mostly on her part), so I think it would have been okay to simply imply that kind of attraction between them or even make it one-sided or merely flirtatious. But I don't think Spock would kiss Uhura in front of anyone. That's so not Spock. He *might* allow her to kiss him, but I don't think he would kiss back, certainly not in front of Kirk and the others. The other thing is that he's supposed to be engaged to a Vulcan girl... but perhaps that fact was erased in this alternate timeline (easy answer to anything, huh).

Third, Chris Pine's Kirk does not really seem like the Kirk of the Original Series. If you watch Star Trek, you'll notice that Captain Kirk is actually quiet a lot of the time, maybe with a sly smile on his face. He's very calm and cool, but can suddenly spring into action. Pine's Kirk just talks too much and seems like such an overactive, overgrown kid. I can't imagine him maturing into Shatner's Kirk. But again, this can be attributed to the alternate reality - his father died in this new timeline, so maybe that's altered his personality.

SUMMARY: I enjoyed the film but gave it a 4 because 5 would mean it's perfect, and it's not perfect. Whether you're a Trekker or not, just go into it with an understanding of what it is - a cool action flick that takes place in an alternate reality. Don't expect it to be at all like your expectations of Star Trek (whether you love Star Trek or despise it) - it's quite a different animal. If you keep this in mind, I don't think you'll be disappointed and may actually enjoy it a lot.

ABOUT THE REVIEWER: I'm not a stereotypical Star Trek fan  - I'm a 24-year-old Asian female, and I've never been to a convention, never worn a Star Trek costume or spoken Klingon to anyone, never even read a Star Trek novel. But I consider myself a real fan - I've seen all of the Original Series, the Next Generation, and Deep Space Nine, as well as all the movies, multiple times and own them on DVD.",1243900800,4,4404,4.383108935128519

Star Trek XI goes back in time to James T. Kirk's early years in Starfleet, however, what we actually get is an alternate beginning to the saga, which in effect erases a great deal of what we consider canon.
This alternate take on the Star Trek Universe is the result of the Romulan captain of a mining ship that accidently travels into the past in search of Ambassador Spock who he blames for the destruction of the Romulan Homeworld! Things take a turn for the worse when Spock is made to watch the destruction of Vulcan! These developments are definitely not for the faint hearted, especially since in the end there is no return to normalcy (as we know it).
The new cast have carried out their performances very well, with everybody seeing their characters boosted compared to the old series, though an emotional (with all its implications) Spock did not feel quite right (which is nevertheless attributed to the writers and not the actor).
Laying the foundation for a ""new"" and ""younger"" crew was a good idea though it saddens me that for the sake of money they decided to re-write Star Trek history from scratch. I am already cringing thinking about what they will erase/modify/re-write next!
However, the acting, the setting, the plot, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful and along with the non-stop action, this film will keep you on your toes from start to finish.
In short, Star Trek XI is a movie definitely worth watching as it is surely thought provoking, although it will probably produce a lot of nostalgia for the actors/crew that we have grown to know and love, and the years that have gone by. 4.5 Stars",1243728000,2,1656,4.710344827586207
3472974,5,B001AVCFJM,"Leave it to JJ Abrams to be the person to successfully restart the Star Trek franchise, and at the theaters, no less! ""Star Trek"" is a lot of things - it's a great summer movie, fun, funny, exciting, interesting, but above all else, it's a reimagining of the classic 60s television series that turned into a cult-phenomenon spawning endless reruns, four more television series, cartoons, a movie franchise, and lots of merchandise.

In the hands of the talented Abrams, an inventive scripts, and great performances, this film goes back to the very beginning and shows how James T. Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, Montgomery Scott, Chekov, and Sulu first crossed paths during the maiden voyage of the starship Enterprise. Add Eric Bana as a time-traveling, vengeance-seeking Romulan and a cameo by Leonard Nimoy as an older version of Spock, and you have a film that was cannily contructed to appeal to non-Trekkies and Trekkies alike.",1243641600,4,945,5.0576923076923075
3472975,5,B001AVCFJM,"This was a movie that kept me rapt for two hours.  It seemed much shorter than that.  I can't wait for the dvd release.  I usually rent movies and don't buy them.

In this new Star Trek, JJ Abrams was wise to start from scratch.  The best creative minds were getting tripped up on canon.  The franchise had been left for dead after ""Enterprise"".  Starting the Original series from day one scene one with a time travel plot was the best option.

We see the young Kirk as an ambitious, talented, and rebellious cadet.  Spock is equally driven as an accomplished Commander in Star Fleet.  They meet as foes at Kirk's Court Martial.  Dr. McCoy, disillusioned by a recent divorce and life, joins Star Fleet.  Sulu and Chekhov are two bright Star Fleet cadets.  Uhura, a gifted linguist, rounds out the crew.  Scotty, the miracle working engineer, comes later.  They are led by Capt. Christopher Pike.  All of Star Fleet is called on an emergency as the planet Vulcan is under attack by the Romulans.

These Romulans are not those seen in all of the Star Trek TV series.  They don't have the Beatle haircuts and they are not soldiers.  They have technology beyond Kirk's time that could destroy life in the galaxy.  Their leader, Nero, is driven by revenge.  The Enterprise is all that stands in the way of Nero's plans.

What I liked about the movie is that all of our Original Series characters are given the opportunity to shine.  Sulu is not chained to the helm and gets to do some literal swashbuckling.  The 17 year old Chekhov shows his talent with ships systems and Navigation.  I kept thinking that this was how Wesley Crusher should have been written in The Next Generation.  That is, having some spectacular saves AND misses.  Spock is brilliant, priggish, and in conflict with his Vulcan/Human heritage.  Kirk doesn't always get the girl.  He underwhelms Uhura.  Speaking of, she gets to do more than say, ""Hailing frequencies open.""

What about the bad guys?  Eric Bana made the most of his role as Nero.  The explanation given for Nero in the movie was a flimsy one.  Bana did,however, make the most of it as a fine character actor.  I have liked his work in Troy<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Troy-Two-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0002Z0EYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Troy (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>as Hector and as Henry VIII in the otherwise abysmal The Other Boleyn Girl<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Other-Boleyn-Girl-Movie-Poster-11-x-17/dp/B001AB3HHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Other Boleyn Girl - Movie Poster - 11 x 17</a>.

The appearance of Leonard Nimoy?  I'm divided.  Abrams is giving his respects to the original series while at the same time starting the new franchise with the use of Nimoy.

I'm looking forward to future Star Trek movies with this rebooted crew.",1243641600,3,2880,5.232456140350878
3472976,2,B001AVCFJM,"For all those who are under 18 and this is their first exposure to the Star Trek saga, I urge you to see the greatest Star Trek movie of them all: Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. ""Khan"" is the standard on which all Star Trek movies and episodes must be measured against. The writers of the new 'Star Trek' movie claim that their inspiration was the 'Wrath of Khan' and would like to think that their new 'update' is equal to the earlier masterpiece. Unfortunately I must report that the new 'Star Trek' is nowhere close to Star Trek II. Quite the contrary, it is a pathetic mess of a screenplay and until you see 'The Wrath of Khan', you cannot understand what I'm talking about.

The new 'Star Trek' attempts to re-imagine the characters from the original TV series when they were young, just beginning their careers. The casting director did well to choose actors who bore a resemblance to the original cast. The writers claim in interviews that they aimed to fill in the back story of the characters by detailing their past histories before, during and right after their initiation at Starfleet Academy as Federation officers. But in actuality, they do the opposite. Take Dr. McCoy, the idiosyncratic chief medical officer--the actor who plays him looks a lot like a young DeForrest Kelley (the original 'Bones') but the comparison ends there. Bones is hardly integrated into the story at all. He doesn't have the humor of the original character nor is there enough of the idiosyncratic charm. In the new 'Star Trek', the character is reduced to a buffoon, chasing Kirk around the ship, trying to inject him with a hypodermic. This is the only time we get to know anything about him.

Now take Uhura. In the original, she was the cool, consummate professional, always guiding the Enterprise through tough waters by way of her technical expertise. Here she is the opposite: unprofessional and overemotional. I was embarrassed when she tries to kiss Spock numerous times in the turbolift after the planet Vulcan was destroyed. Here Spock is trying to cope with the annihilation of six million of his people and all Uhura wants to do is make out! You call that class??? And what about Chekov? All they have the character do is mimic the Russian accent of the original character. How did they make him different or improve on the original? Even worse is Sulu. All he gets to do is parachute down to what looks like the platform of an oil rig where he aids Kirk in a ridiculous fight against some bad guys. I thought Scotty had the most potential of the supporting players. At least he projected the good nature of the original character but it was kind of disappointing when he must rely on Leonard Nimoy (the old Spock) to give him the new warp speed formula.

The new James T. Kirk looks like a young William Shatner but he too lacks the charm of the original. More could have done with Kirk's early days on Earth especially in showing how the future might look. I liked the cop on the flying motorcycle but a peek at a future 'watering hole' seemed quite derivative (check out the first Star Wars where Harrison Ford struts through the intergalactic bar). Depicting Kirk as a rebellious hothead seems part of the original Star Trek lore, but the humor is missing.

The new Spock doesn't at all measure up to the old Spock. The early scene where a very young Spock confronts a group of Vulcan 'bullies' was cute but after that it was all downhill. The problem is that the Kirk-Spock relationship is too heavy-handed. It's one thing to show conflict between the two but when they come to blows, it just seemed so un-Spocklike. Contrast that with Spock's decision to disobey Kirk's command at the end of the ""Wrath of Khan"". Kirk and Spock are noble characters and somehow the conflict between them seems juvenile and trivial. Or maybe it was a matter of the plot where the stakes weren't high enough. The writers simply did not give the characters an opportunity to display the complexity of the relationship.

Perhaps the worst part of the new Star Trek is the depiction of the villain, the disaffected Nero. I seem to recall that by Star Trek: Next Generation, the Romulans had become a group of worthy adversaries to the denizens of the Federation. But here, the last Romulan, Nero, is a bald guy with tattoos plastered all over his head. All he can do is snarl throughout the movie. Contrast that with Ricardo Montalban's performance as Khan. Again, no comparison! Plotwise, the new Star Trek wasn't clever at all. Beginning with the unnecessary flashback to the tale of Kirk's father's heroism, we're treated to one tired battle scene after another. What's worse is that the film's writers have created a new alternative Star Trek universe. Can you imagine the entire planet of Vulcan being destroyed in any of the earlier movies or episodes? It would never happen. Hey Vulcan is supposed to be populated with some of the smartest guys in the universe and they let themselves be annihilated by a Romulan who looks like a skinhead using a drilling machine that creates black holes!

It was nice seeing Leonard Nimoy reprising the role of the original Spock but I was sad to see just how much the actor has aged. Contrary to all the hype, the new Star Trek lacks the charm, humor and complexity of the some of the earlier incarnations. Go back and check out Wrath of Khan and some of the best of the Star Trek episodes from television. If they decide to make a second 'new' Star Trek, hopefully the studio will hire a group of better writers.",1243641600,9,5546,4.642566191446028
3472977,5,B001AVCFJM,"After releasing ten films under the banner of `Star Trek', along with four television spin-offs, the novelty of this once proud brand name appeared to be wearing off. This in light of the fact that the latest entries for both mediums met with less than stellar critical and commercial success (""Star Trek: Nemesis"" and TV's ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" respectively). It seemed that perhaps the franchise and its audience needed a break, and possibly a fresh, new approach if it was to ever find success again. Which brings us to the here and now, the summer of 2009, seven years after the last feature film and four years since the last TV spin-off aired its final episode, and we finally have a new ""Star Trek"" film once more boldly going where no man has gone before. Under the care of wunderkind producer, writer and director J.J. Abrams (TV's ""Lost"" and ""Mission: Impossible 3""), along with screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (""Transformers""), the dormant franchise has been resurrected, returning it to bask in the glory of critical praise and commercial success, an achievement that has been absent from the franchise for quite some time.

""Star Trek"" focuses, once again, on the Federation starship Enterprise and its original crew of Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Sulu (John Cho), McCoy (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), and more. When a deadly new Romulan menace, led by a vengeful despot named Nero (Eric Bana), threatens the entirety of the Federation, Starfleet must rally its forces, including the recently completed Enterprise, to combat this alien danger before it's too late.

As a fan of the majority of the ""Star Trek"" films (aside from ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" and ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier""), and generally enjoying the direction the latter films had been taking (""Star Trek: Nemesis"" being my favorite entry thus far), I was a little unsure about the prospect of essentially restarting the franchise from scratch. However, since this approach has proven successful over the last few years with other franchises that I enjoy, for example the Batman and James Bond series', I thought that if in fact the well had run dry in regards to further adventures set beyond the events of the tenth film, then perhaps this decision may work out alright after all. Of course that success would all depend on who was going to be responsible for taking the series back to its roots, so to speak.

Let me say that any lingering doubts or concerns I had in regards to this film and its chances for success were quickly laid to rest when word was released that writer/director/producer J.J. Abrams would be helming this installment. Abrams had proven himself quite the capable writer and producer with his various television projects and screenplays, so I knew that he would most likely not sit idly by if the story was lacking in any way. Yet, it was his work helming the very entertaining, third ""Mission: Impossible"" film that gave me even greater faith in his ability to guide the Enterprise back into the spotlight once more.

On top of the fact that such a multi-talented person of J.J. Abrams' caliber would be directing the eleventh entry into the venerable series, was the announcement that the series would not only serve as a reboot of sorts, but it would still recognize the films that have come before it; instead of just ignoring them altogether which is what most of the reboots have done. Crafting this epic story was the writing duo of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Orci and Kurtzman, along with Abrams, were sensible enough to not only cater to the hardcore fans of the show and its subsequent movies and television spin-offs, but also make the story accessible to a whole new generation of moviegoers that may not have been previously interested in anything related to `Star Trek'.

The plot of ""Star Trek"" meets all the necessary criteria for the making of a massive summer blockbuster. Featuring plenty of drama, intensity, humor, incredible action and visual effects, and even a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure, this film has a little something for virtually every possible member of the audience. For the newcomers to the series, the story doesn't require you to have seen, or have any previous knowledge of the other films in the series. The film takes an appropriate amount of time to introduce you to all of the primary players in the film, giving them each their moment or two to shine. So, if you are unfamiliar with these iconic characters you soon won't be, once the incredibly fast-paced two hours of this film are through with you.

Now, don't fret any of you die hard fans out there that may not have seen this film yet, although I doubt there are all that many of you left that this statement could apply to at this point. There are plenty of insider references to previous events or famous quotes from your favorite characters for you to latch onto. Even though this film was made in a way that it could appeal to a much broader spectrum of the audience, it never faltered from supplying the core fan base with plenty of sci-fi goodness for them to embrace along the way. So, make no mistake, this entry into the ever-expanding Star Trek universe is a film that is completely deserving of carrying on the legacy of this epic series, and it never once loses sight of that responsibility.

Speaking of responsibility to the series' legacy, keeping these iconic characters alive is an all-new bunch of actors chosen to embody them in their younger years. This is no small feat when considering these roles were made famous many years ago by a talented and beloved cast of actors and actresses. Winning over the hearts and minds of new fans of the series shouldn't be all that hard for this cast; however, proving to the longtime fans of the franchise, some dating all the way back to the original series, may prove much harder to accomplish.

Leading the cast are two talented actors, Chris Pine (""Smokin' Aces"") and Zachary Quinto (TV's ""Heroes""), portraying the coveted roles of Kirk and Spock respectively. Chris Pine brings a normal speech pattern to Kirk, opting not to emulate William Shatner's pause-ridden pattern of speech; however, Chris did retain Kirk's sense of humor, arrogance, and no-quit attitude. His performance provides audiences with a new interpretation to the character while remaining true to the heart and soul of Kirk. For Zachary Quinto his portrayal of Spock was partially achieved before he ever read a single line of dialogue because he bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Leonard Nimoy (who had portrayed the character in the previous incarnation). Out of the entire ensemble cast, Quinto is probably the brightest spot in the group, as his performance is absolutely perfect for the character. Even though his performance so closely resembles that of his predecessor's, he never once ventures into the realm of imitation as so many other actors may have been tempted to do.

Supporting the two leads, is quite the gifted ensemble of actors and actresses ranging from Simon Pegg (""Hot Fuzz""), Karl Urban (""The Bourne Supremacy""), John Cho (Harold from the `Harold and Kumar' films), Zoe Saldana (""Vantage Point""), and Anton Yelchin (""Teminator: Salvation""). Simon Pegg brings a much more hilarious approach to the brilliant engineer known as Montgomery Scott, best known as Scotty, that some may find distracting due to his character being more stoic in previous appearances. However, since this film takes place at a time in the character's life that hasn't been explored, I for one view this as an acceptable revision. Karl Urban, much like Zachary Quinto, gives an almost pitch-perfect portrayal of Dr. McCoy. I found it interesting to see that as brilliant a doctor as McCoy was in the previous films, we get to see a slightly inexperienced version of him here, while he's still incredibly smart, he does make mistakes and isn't nearly as sure of his decisions as he is later on. John Cho and Zoe Saldana don't really get to break all that much new ground with their characters, Sulu and Uhura, yet the two young talents do get a few moments to shine within the film. Most notably for fans of the original series, the various hints to Sulu's sword fighting abilities are finally showcased allowing a new, more action-oriented side of the character to emerge. The only slight problem that I have with the casting is that perhaps Anton Yelchin was slightly mis-cast as Pavel Chekov. While he brings the character's trademark substitution of w's for v's out in almost every line of dialogue he has, he doesn't strike me as a good fit for the character. Even with that complaint, Anton did do a good job as Chekov; I just don't see him ever becoming the man we all know.

Rounding out the cast is veteran character actor Bruce Greenwood (""I, Robot"") and Eric Bana (""Hulk""). Bruce Greenwood portrays the original captain of this starship Enterprise named Christopher Pike. He's a seasoned veteran of Starfleet, who expects nothing but excellence from all who serve under his command. Greenwood's portrayal of Pike reminds me of Captain Kirk in the previous films, where he was much more reserved and in control of every situation, never willing to sacrifice others for a mission that he wasn't willing to undertake himself. As for Eric Bana who plays the vengeful Romulan known as Nero, he wasn't given a whole lot to do with the character other than appear menacing and bark orders. There were a few flashes of character development for him, but nothing so substantial as to make him appear any more or less dangerous than any other villain you would find in a `Star Trek' movie. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't make any mention of his presence in the film; Leonard Nimoy reprises his role of Spock once again. Surprisingly, Nimoy's appearance in the film isn't relegated to being a bit of stunt casting for a glorified cameo; instead, the presence of the much older Spock is integral to the movie's central plotline and provides some very fun moments within the film.

Over 40 years since the original series first introduced us to this enduring franchise, and despite a few rough patches of waning popularity over the last several years, J.J. Abrams' ""Star Trek"" restores the series to its former magnificence. With a great story, a terrific cast, and visual effects that are nothing short of incredible, ""Star Trek"" has become my new favorite entry into this series, removing ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" from the coveted position.

The creators wanted a successful reboot of the franchise, something that was accessible to Trek fans and non-fans, and they succeeded in creating a enjoyable popcorn movie, well worth seeing.  But it could have been great.  They sacrificed plot for style and they could have had both.  There are too many plot holes and not enough effort spent setting up the motivation of the villain for this to be a truly memorable movie.  Enjoyable but not great.

3472980,4,B001AVCFJM,"As entertainment this reimagining of Star Trek delivers great action, and not a few surprises.  It's quite exciting to see the familiar characters being reintroduced and played by new actors.

One hopes that Abrams who brought us Lost and Alias, and wrote space epic Armageddon will take the treasure that is Star trek, and boldly go where no one has gone before.  By that I do mean not going where he has gone with Lost, which now has me totally confused, with the myriad time travel plot lines, and who is the good guy and the bad guy, but going somewhere fresh, new and exciting.

JJ Abrams has done a great job first time at bat with this franchise.
The actors who perform the lead roles Pine as Kirk, Quinto as Spock, and Urban as McCoy all do incredible jobs.  Karl Urban is McCoy.  The Spock character is by far the best developed, and when you see the movie you will understand why.

Part of what I loved about this movie was the paradox.  For instance, Time Travel.  It was fun picking apart the logic afterwards.

Romulan villain Nero travels back in time, to avenge the destruction of his planet Romulus, destroyed by a supernova (exploding star).

The very fact that Nero can travel back in time, means that he can save his planet, which at the time of this Star Trek still exists, yet he does not.

Nero waits 25 years for Spock to emerge from the time space continuum, which in Spock time is only 5 minutes. How long would you wait for someone to turn up?  If you're like me, not that long.

Nero attacks Star fleet before Kirk is born.  If he can travel through time, then why does he wait until Kirk is all grown up before launching his next attack?

I was surpised by the Romulan ship, all these walkways high in the air with no safety handrails. Someone could fall off. They have time travel, can destroy planets, have red matter, but no safety rails.

Kobayashi Maru Simulation

In order to pass this test and become a star fleet captain, you must fail the test. Nobody has ever passed the test. Yet there are star fleet captains. Kirk has failed the test twice, before becoming the first person to beat the test. How many times must one be allowed to take the test and fail, before one is deemed to pass the test?

When he beats the test designed by Spock, he is put on trial for cheating. Spock designed the simulation to test the fear response, so how can someone who has no emotions be the arbiter of someone else's emotions.

Using that standard Spock is unqualified to be a starship commander, yet Spock is a commander. Wouldn't Spock have to pass his own test, and therefore with his advance knowledge would he not achieve the same result as Kirk who he accuses of cheating by cheating? I enjoyed how screwed up this whole thing was.

The movie felt a little off in two places, one was the Uhura storyline, who was so vaguely told as to be semi apologetic.  The other I felt was capturing Kirk, portrayed here as a hedonistic thrill seeker.  It's unlikely that anyone in a captain role would take the risks he takes.  That's what crew members are for.

It has to be said that I have seen the movie more than once, as there was so much action, it was difficult to take it all in in one go.

I wonder if you find this review helpful.",1243555200,2,3257,4.3777038269550745

But I'm of the age to be intimately familiar since Star Trek began in the mid-sixties on tv. This movie has very little to do with the Star Trek culture, if you will. The creators of this know little & cared less. Yeah, there are lots of insider tidbits (Dammit Jim). But they had lots of $$$ & Leonard Nimoy. As part of the saga, it's worthless unless they have a sequel to this prequel. Vulcan is destroyed just as Kirk & Spock are getting to know & at first loathe each other. Spock survives as one of several thousand Vulcans who happen to be off  planet when it is vaporized by a Romulan from the future. As a stand-alone movie it is barely ok. No problem with the young characterizations of the Enterprise crew. There is even a homage to Star Wars. The kissy-face scenes of Spock & Uhura must have been for shock value but made my flesh crawl. Maybe too much of my youthful pop-culture IQ is invested in Star Trek. It is all fiction & this is the 190th review of a movie less than three weeks old.",1243555200,2,1152,4.212669683257919

3472983,4,B001AVCFJM,"Allow me to preface this review by saying that I'm not a huge fan of Star Trek.  I don't hate it by any stretch, but the sheer volume of information in the Star Trek&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/lexicon/dp/0671536095/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">lexicon</a>&nbsp;is both intimidating and exhausting.  I do absolutely adore science fiction and I know full well Star Trek's place and significance within the genre.  It was perhaps even more palpable to viewers like me that the 2009 re-boot of the original iconic crew of the USS Enterprise be placed in the very capable hands of a hugely imaginative filmmaker; J.J. Abrams.  Abrams is admittedly not a hardcore fan of the series either, but he clearly respects the stories greatly, and I think that gave him both the ability to take risks with these characters as well as celebrate them effectively.  He clearly brought a team as well, and is at his most generative.  Abrams will likely please hardcore fans as he surrounded himself with informative writers, but they will also please the mainstream fans, while at the same time making money and leaving the chance to create endless sequels wide open for himself, or the rest of Hollywood to indulge on.  As a film Star Trek is indulgent, but its science fiction is fantastic and its seamless visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen.

I'm not going to get bogged down by summarizing the story here in order to avoid both spoilers and going off on too many details.  The film works as an origins tale with new actors playing the original crew.  Little known actor Chris Pine plays Captain James T. Kirk as the film's primary character, and does very well for himself in a role that will probably be under tremendous scrutiny.  The film keeps focus on his meeting other crew members such as Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban), Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin), Hikaro Sulu (John Cho), and of course Scotty (Simon Pegg), but primarily focuses on Kirk's interactions with the film's other protagonist; Spock.  In my humble opinion Spock is portrayed brilliantly by Zachary Quinto (who plays the villain in television's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes/dp/B000QDLSR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes</a>).  To top it off the film has an outstanding Romulan villain named Captain Nero, played by the always solid Eric Bana.  There are nearly endless supporting roles filled quite eloquently by other known and talented actors and actresses.  This really is a huge production, but it is by no means wasteful.

So I am definitely recommending this, and the only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because of a few gratuitous scenes included as comic relief that rubbed me the wrong way but are more or less forgivable.  As far as how it compares to the other&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-films/dp/B001TH16DI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek films?</a>&nbsp;I found moderate charm in some of those films and I have great reverence for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wrath-of-Khan/dp/B0000683DH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wrath of Khan</a>&nbsp;specifically, but it's just not even a contest.  This is a different era of visual filmmaking.  I would imagine hardcore fans are pleased but I can't say for sure as I never read other reviews before writing my own, where I know for certain the mainstream appeal is absolutely undeniable.

I am a die hard Classic Trek ONLY fan and like many people of this generation felt this was going to be all about the destruction of Star Trek as we knew it, BUT, and here's the thing, JJ Abrams has been SO clever in setting this in an alternate reality, not only has he followed the Vulcan philosophy of IDIC (see title) but by setting it thus he can do whatever he likes (within reason) and it won't ever sully canon (ie the original series stands as it is, no harm, no foul).

Yes, this was a very flashy, action-filled, exciting piece of mind candy.  You'll long remember the special effects after you've forgotten the storyline.
The characters haven't been updated - they've been completely perverted.  (Spock and Uhura? Gimme a break.) It's also obvious the writers don't know their science - or don't care.

I should probably give this film 4 stars; the plot is overly complicated, there is some clumsy exposition in the middle, and the villain (Eric Bana) is two dimensional.  However, everything else is so perfect and the resulting picture gives this franchise the kick in the behind it has needed for many years.  Purists may find much to gripe about, but I am impressed by the way director J.J. Abrams and screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have managed to push the reset button in a way that does not nullify more than 40 years of storytelling.  Let the novel writers and graphic artists carry on with the original Star Trek universe.  Now we have a great young cast portraying classic characters and forging their own continuity.  Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban, as Spock and McCoy respectively, give faithful presentations that do not resort to caricature.  The rest of the cast--Zoe Saldana as Uhura, John Cho as Sulu, Anton Yeltsin as Chekhov, and Simon Pegg as Scotty--create engaging characters that are quite different from the originals.  Chris Pine, as Kirk, does a good job of portraying a cocky young man who grows into the role of starship captain.

I just went to see it for the 2nd time with our friends who were not Star Trek fans until now.  It is well written, has many subtle moments of comedy, and I cannot wait for the sequel that everyone knows is coming.

The only weak point I noticed was the sound track.  Its use of the ""evil music"" versus the ""federation music"" was a tad over-the-top.  In a few moments, I felt the music was redundant and did not fit the scene.

3472988,3,B001AVCFJM,"""...To BOLDLY go where No Man had Gone Before.""..

...or something like that. The immortal tagline of the operatic TV franchise that had gone on for many generations. First off, let me tell you that I am a casual fan and more of a ""Next Generation"" kind'a guy, although my favorite Star Trek movie is still ""The Wrath of Khan"". After the failed box-office outings of recent `Star Trek"" films (""Nemesis"" for one) and the less than dominating presence in television by ""Enterprise"", one wouldn't be hard-pressed to think that the franchise needed a reboot to attract a new generation of fans. What made the series successful that also spawned numerous spin-offs (such as ""Deep Space Nine"") was the manner of which it creates mythic characters, with storylines that are pretty much driven by its characters and situations. Well, ""popcorn"" director J.J. Abrams is the one to undertake this very dangerous assignment of rebooting a well-loved franchise that had earned its place in pop culture. What should be the focus of this reboot? Remembering what had gone before while injecting a certain needed dose of energy.

Some years ago, and the U.S.S. Kelvin is under attack by a huge Romulan ship that dwarfs the Kelvin in size and power. Aboard the federation starship is George Kirk, who would then be revealed as the sire of one Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine). Sacrificing himself to save the lives of the crew, Kirk proves his mettle as a man who saved 800 people in under 8 minutes.
Now 20 years from that time, a cocky James Kirk is dubbed by Captain Pike as ""only the genius level intellect repeat offender in the Midwest"", and reveals the sacrifice made by his father. Inspired, Jim decides to enlist in the federation, finally beating a simulation program designed by Spock (Zachary Quinto) and attracts attention from the academy. Unfortunately, the planet Vulcan becomes under siege by the very same ship that killed Kirk's father; a rogue Romulan hero named Nero (Eric Bana) wants revenge on the planet. It is up to new federation cadets to try to intercept Nero, but will they be in time?

J.J. Abrams is one very mainstream director, he knows how to give his audience what they want or to believe that he knows what they want. The direction is indeed very energetic and fast-paced, the film keeps on moving, as Abrams bombards the audience with nostalgic scenes as we become privy to ""Star Trek the Early Years"". It is quite great to see the younger Kirk munching on an apple, the Vulcan mind-meld and nerve pinches, and accompanied by classic supporting characters such as Spock, Uhura (Zoe Saldana), McCoy (Karl Urban), Scotty (Simon Pegg), Chekov (Anton Yelchin), Sulu (John Cho) and even Leonard Nimoy makes an appearance as ""Spock # 1"". There is also a sexy green alien who is reminiscent of the green ladies from the original series and ""Enterprise"". The dialogue is full of humorous quips that give our characters some weight and lets them grow on us, in place of characterization. Sure, we are all familiar with these characters so development doesn't really matter right? Wrong. The characters this time around feels very one-dimensional, even Kirk's clichd ""bad boy"" image persona is rather overused; he crashes a classic vintage sports car, and involves himself in barroom brawls, which make for fun development but a little too clichd.. The characters while having an entertaining feel are very `cartoonish' and made very transparent to make for easy connection to its audience.

The screenplay by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman is full of action and set ups for the usual Hollywood injections of elaborate stunts, special effects, and heavy doses of explosions. While this is not exactly a bad thing, it does manage to keep the proceedings in a hyper-kinetic fun pace, if you are looking for action thrills then this movie will not disappoint. I rather enjoyed the scene when Kirk and Sulu engaged a vertical drop from space, I like the `ice planet' where Kirk meets the ""prime"" Spock, there are many scenes that can easily be seen as `popcorn' entertainment. The new U.S.S. Enterprise had some minor re-designs but none that looked too extravagant. Nero's ship does have a HUGE intimidating quality but it looks a little insect-like or a ""flytrap"". However, it doesn't have the feel of `classic' Star Trek movies, that may be seen as a misstep to purists, as the overly kinetic action tends to distract the audience from its plot.

The plot in 2009's Star Trek is very simple, and has the usual ""trappings"" of Hollywood formulas, such as time travel, an alternate reality, a black hole and a quest for revenge. The plot offers nothing new, and Abrams wisely avoids the inside details of the plot. (don't even try to dissect the logic and science of its plot since it is so unimaginative) Yes, to hide every plot misstep and hole, he distracts his audience with its pace, humor, a lot of huge explosions and action. What happened to Kirk's mother? She disappears after we see James taking a joyride in a sports car. The villain, Nero feels rather underwhelming, and all the emotions that he can display is anger, the explanation behind his goals for vengeance is also too short and rather feels like a throw-away detail. Much of the film's central focus is on the developing friendship between James and Spock, with Spock's budding romance with Uhura as a subplot. I have to say Zachary Quinto gives a very good performance, and almost steals the show from Chris Pine if it wasn't for his character's outward `cockiness'. the rest of the crew seems decent, although the cast definitely spends too much effort in acting like the `classic' cast so I cannot really comment on their acting talents.

Everyone seems to be so happy to see the franchise re-energized, and I can appreciate fans` reasons to rejoice, but purist of the beloved series may find the film a little wanting. If you dissect the limitations and weaknesses of the plot, one can see that this film is JUST your usual popcorn affair, that comes straight from the Hollywood oven. It is a good film but the film spends too much time being fascinated with itself--""Hey look at us, we are making a new Star Trek movie"", and fans of the almost `asleep' franchise are just happy to see the U.S.S. Enterprise Starship once again. The fact that Abrams knows ""playful entertainment"" is what gave the film its extremely high entertainment value, along with his innate skill in casting Winona Ryder in a surprise appearance and finds room for the Vulcan salute, and the little alien with Scotty, not to mention that green alien slut, Abrams knows energetic momentum and redeems the film. The film is fun, thrilling and enjoyable, but it is HARDLY Epic or groundbreaking. Would Gene Roddenberry give this film his approval? Probably not, but then all that should matter is how well `fans' take to it. When in doubt, clichd popcorn movies are the safest bet. This movie will not make a dent or add on to Star Trek's legacy, but it sure is fun and as a lady friend of mine said; ""CUTE"".

3472989,5,B001AVCFJM,"When I think of the Star Trek movie, I think of hot actors, cool special effects, and a some light comedy moments.  I think that Star Trek definitely lives up to the Star Trek francise and definitely appeals to the younger audience.  It has hot, young, and basically sexy actors who will make even the most hard-core Luke Skywalker fan drool uncontrollably.  The action is superb and I always was at the edge of my seat during any battle.  The sci-fi effects are very good compared to the trashy effects of the 1960 tv show which the movie is based off.  The comedy in the film is very light and I don't think that the film does a lot of comedic moments.  The film company heavily relies on action, adventure, and hot actors to pull the film through .
Although most Star Trek fans will probably be disappointed with the fact that their favorite actors are being replaced by younger, more modern actors.  They must not realize that the original actors are unable to do the stunts and nonstop labor of filming a sci-fi film.  Those fans should be happy that Leonard Nimoy even got a cameo in the film.  I mean what could anger those trekkies more than not having that 15 minute scene of the Starship Enterprise cast just sitting in a long room talking about galactic diplomacy in deep detail.  They must be irate with the cool special effects, galactic battles and the fact that you can actually understand what the Klingons are saying!  Unfortunaly during the film some moments didn't really make sense, like the whole Black hole thingy was confusing at the start but made sense during the end.
The Star Trek movie will definitely impress almost all of it's audience except those Trekkies who would rather watch two out of shape guys wearing bad makeup fighting in a real akward way. I give it 4 out of five stars with the one star off because of the fact that most Trekkies are upset with the fact that the Star Trek movie actually made sense.",1243468800,,1943,4.522857142857143
3472990,4,B001AVCFJM,"James Kirk (Pine) is a talented but undisciplined young man.  Captain Christopher Pike (Greenwood) sees potential in him and challenges him to be greater than his father, a man who saved many in a deadly attack against a ship he was temporarily captaining.

""Star Trek"" is both a re-imagining and a reboot.  The look and feel of the film is like nothing ever seen before in a ""Star Trek"" television show or movie.  That is due to director J.J. Abrams, who really does bring things up to date.  Also, there is a ton of action.  The storyline reboots things for future movies as well.  The cast is all well chosen, echoing the original actors without imitating them.  As far as movies go, this is a fun, summer movie.  For die hard ""Star Trek"" fans though, there may be some grumbling.  Some might argue that there is too much action and too little thought throughout the film.  Most will have an issue with the reboot that manages to essentially erase everything ever presented on television or in the movies, and provide a weak excuse.  Unlike every other time the timeline is disrupted, this time they don't feel the need to fix it.  Still, ""Star Trek"" brings a lot to the table, and will no doubt bring in a lot of new fans.

3472991,2,B001AVCFJM,"I saw this Star Trek movie last night. As a stand-alone it was a really good movie. As part of the Star Trek legacy it was horrible. I viewed it as a slap in the face of every fan of the original Star Trek and subsequent spin-offs. The movie is supposed to be a prequel. It's supposed to show us the origins of the characters, how they meet and how they come to be these iconic characters with whom so many of us nerds have grown-up and actually made us nerds.

It was hard enough for me to get over different actors playing these beloved characters from way before I was conceived. Ray Liotta and Mark-Paul Gossler's love child plays Kirk (as a ginger. Kirk's not a ginger. They might as well have had an Indian play him.), Harold plays Sulu (as a magical ninja), Charlie Bartlett plays Chekov and Shaun Of The Dead plays Scotty. I will say Karl Urban did a damn fine job as McCoy. It was obvious new actors had to portray the characters, so I tried to go in with an open mind and let the story take hold and follow the characters not the actors. The actors were all actually quite good and did not detract from my enjoyment of the film at all.

The story was good. The movie was fun and exciting. As a prequel to the original series it failed miserably. Instead of giving us a prequel and showing the actual origins of our beloved characters J.J. Abrams and writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman decided they wanted to give the Star Trek Universe a ""reboot."" They used time travel to accomplish this ""reboot."" It's this ""reboot"" that is a problem for me. Instead of giving us stories that shaped the characters and lead up to the original series they completely cop out and create a scenario that allows them to completely ignore the entire history of the franchise. Instead of creatively fitting their story into the over-all story they usurp the whole future with an alternate timeline cop out. J.J. Abrams in an interview with Memory Alpha admits he doesn't even ""know and love the world of Star Trek."" He says, ""...we wanted to make our own brand new thing, and at the same time embrace and honor what had come before."" So why the hell didn't they just do a sequel? They could have very easily created a post-Voyager crew to deal with new adventures. It was completely unnecessary to destroy the original characters and journeys in order to create new characters to go on new journeys.

It's been said that the flap of a butterfly's wing on another continent could have an effect one's life, that the slightest alteration to the past could have enormous affects on the present/future. They blew-up a planet, a very important planet in the Star Trek Universe, so now Kirk gets to be captain a few years earlier. Kirk is a ginger. The Enterprise is not the Enterprise internally, at all. Uhura sits on the left side of the captain's chair and is romantically involved with Spock. Actually all those changes happened before the destruction of Vulcan, save Kirk's accelerated promotion to captain.

They also abandon canon when they have Romulans, who look nothing like Romulans, go back in time and they are recognized as Romulans when Kirk is the first human to see Romulans in ""Balance Of Terror,"" which is set at least ten years after this encounter.

The timeline is all messed-up, too. This ""red matter"" (they couldn't come up with a better name for a substance of which a golf ball sized amount held the amount of power to destroy a planet) they use to destroy everything was, according to Star Trek: Countdown, a prequel comic book series to the prequel movie, red matter was created by the Vulcan Science Academy, which is on Vulcan. When the Romulans went back in time and destroyed Vulcan, the Vulcan Science Academy ceased to exist and therefore never created red matter thus voiding Spock's ability to create the initial black hole and young Spock's ability to destroy the Romulan ship with the red matter. Also, upon destruction of Vulcan and the loss of his mother the young Spock's character would have been dramatically altered and Spock would cease to exist, so ginger Kirk would not have met him on Delta Vega (which was moved in the movie so the writers would have a familiar name). Spock would not be in the past and his memories of the real timeline would not exist as the real timeline no longer exists.

George Lucas gave us a prequel, or three, you may remember. He made some faux pas and explained away something too simplistically (why the hell did Jimmy Smitts erase C3PO's memory? Why did Senator Palpatine just discontinue the droid army?) , but he rose up to the challenge and gave us a whole new nine hours of Star Wars to enjoy. Except for the remastered Anakin at the end of The Return Of The Jedi. That was lame. What if George Lucas wrote and directed Star Trek? Oh damn, nerdgasm.

As a movie I liked Star Trek. The actors were actually pretty good. I really don't care that Kirk was a ginger. He was actually more of a day-walker anyway. As a part of Star Trek it was horrible. It was a lame cop out way to do a ""prequel"". The writers just want to take these classic characters on their own adventures without having to follow the paths that have been set that lead these characters to their futures. So now the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise never goes all the places we've seen them boldly go and they are going to boldly go where they never went, thus voiding the original series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, all ten movies, the animated series and countless books and graphic novels. It also virtually voids the entire canon. This is blasphemy. This is urination on the grave of Gene Roddenberry (figuratively, of course, as he was cremated and some of his ashes were launched into space) and all that he created. I'm shocked Majel had anything to do with this.",1243382400,15,5824,4.551526717557252
3472992,1,B001AVCFJM,"There were two Star Trek movies that rekindled and ultimately saved the franchise. The Wrath of Khan rescued the series from mothballing after the underwhelming performance of Star Trek the Motion Picture. And this new Trek intended to reboot the series, ala Casino Royale, at the first time in decades where a Trek series isn't playing on TV (barring re-runs and syndication). Both succeeded in keeping the series alive, but where Khan raised the bar so high that other Trek films struggled to follow, the new trek simply drops it to the floor.

To a degree the two films are mirror images of each other. Both have villains plotting revenge, not just on the Federation, but on specific members of the Enterprise's crew. Both villains are patient enough to bide their time for the right moments. In both films the Enterprise must face the enemy alone. In both there is a terrible doomsday weapon meant for good but twisted to evil ends. Ultimately, in both Kirk must navigate a successful strategy between pure logic and raw emotion, charting a winning middle ground between archetypes of Spock and McCoy.

My biggest issue with the new Trek is that like much of pop culture today it's crass and tacky. Like Paris Hilton forgetting her underthings I get the same sort of underside glimpse of Trek I never really wanted to see. Kirk in his whitey tighties, check. Uhuru down to her skivvies, check. Spock in a tongue wrestling full mouth kiss, check. Kirk chewing and apple through the Kobayashi Maru? Retch.

Kirk's womanizing is a perfect illustration of how tacky the new Trek is. The classic Shatner Kirk didn't need to drop pick up lines on every babe he came into contact with, he had the confidence and strength of character for the babes to decide to drop themselves into his lap. The tail chasing is exactly the type of superficial behavior expected of the twenty-nothing music store clerks or barista of today, not a man destined to take command of a capitol class naval vessel. The old Kirk was cocky and confident in a quiet `I know and don't need to say it' kind of way. The new Kirk is a worse actor in one regard, he's unable to show that same innate confidence and instead has to shout it to the audience at every opportunity. Maybe an updating of the character for modern times, but it's not a good change, it's just tacky and superficial.

It's a ship full of rebelly goodness. Kirk is so rebel that he's got a criminal record, starting with car theft. Spock is so rebel he decides to punk slap his culture's most revered traditions. Uhuru is such an uber-rebel that an interracial kiss isn't enough (kudos to the original show for having the stones to be the first to trod upon that taboo) she also has an interspecies (extraxeno?) affair. How does the Federation, let alone a single starship, even function with so many chiefs running around?

Both films also deal with technology intended for good that get warped to evil ends. They differ greatly in their treatment however. In Khan the Genesis Device is treated with as much significance as the Manhattan Project, it has the power to alter the power dynamic of that universe. Even before coming into direct contact with it the characters discuss the implications of such a technology, exactly what good sci-fi does, question. The new Trek uses it's ""red matter"" that can cause black holes as just a plot device, something to be loaded onto a ship and rushed to the bits of the movie that need action. The new Trek is the crassest sort of sci-fi around, sci-fi that used only to add more special effects to the non-stop action sequences. If the action stops and Ms Hilton thinks for a moment we may just end up seeing more body parts we didn't want to.

And that earlier mentioned scene of Kirk chewing an apple through the Kobayashi Maru does nothing but draw attention to the dramatic differences between the two films. The new Trek references Khan in several instances , the Kobayashi Maru, Kirk's refusal to accept the no-win situation, even the parasite that attaches to the victims brain stem. Yet when compared to its mirror counterpart the new Trek is but a shadow. A pretender to the same throne. Khan had something few movies accomplish successfully (and even fewer sci fi movies), it was rich in theme, memes that transcends the mere story. Khan dealt seriously both on and off screen with the subject of old age and passing the torch on to new generations. Spock readies Lt Saavik for the responsibilities of being a captain, Kirk discovers a son he's never known, Khan has his surrogate, Joquim, who dies in his arms, even Scotty has a nephew just starting as an apprentice engineer who dies for his elders. Shatner was also not too thrilled to be playing Kirk as someone in his fading years. In fairness few of the other old cast trek films came close to this high mark, but it doesn't help the new Trek's legitimacy to constantly point out that it has a much brighter cousin. Even the best lines of Khan, ""You have been and always shall be my friend,"" are lifted in the desperate hope that the emotional impact of the Khan will somehow retain its meaning among the raw sewage dialog, ""You can handle me anytime,"" of the new film.

There certainly were other Trek movies as bad as this, but none so vapid, loud, and shallow. This film will soon be completely be forgotten. And possibly remade with an even younger, louder, and more idiotic cast.",1243382400,34,5430,4.655891553701773

3472995,4,B001AVCFJM,"Disclaimer: I come from the ""old school"" of Star Trek viewers, having lived long enough to have watched the original run of TOS in its original airing on NBC. I've read many reviews of this movie, some pro, some con, most of the ""con"" coming from old-school fans like me, who obviously don't like to see changes in the canon. I finally saw it for myself over Memorial Day weekend.

Without getting into any details that would spoil the plot, I can offer one piece of advice:

This Is Not Your Father's ""Star Trek"".

Now, that sounds like a marketing blurb, but it's not. It's a literal description, and a strong plot hint. When you see the movie and get into the plot, you'll understand. This one fact, when I got it through my head, laid any ghost of discontent to rest. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. And I believe that Mr. Roddenberry would have as well. That's as strong a recommendation as I can give. If you're going to the movie, I advise you to put your preconceptions in your back pocket and simply take the movie as it comes. When it's done, and you know the whole plot, then evaluate.

Some observations on the individual characters come to mind. First, as has been observed here, although Captain Kirk was perhaps the ""icon"" of TOS, we all know which character was the most influential (we never saw bumper stickers saying ""I Grok Kirk"", did we?) -- it was Spock, of course. And the character shines here. Zachary Quinto does a marvelous job of portraying not only the logical Spock in command for the first time, but the human Spock coming to grips with his dual nature.

Chris Pine is a very human Kirk, putting a down-to-earth bit of scuff on the ""Captain Kirk"" luster and thereby making him more believable. Pine did his homework, and it shows, not only in the portrayal of the character, but in little things like facial expressions.

Zoe Saldana as Uhura is a treasure. Nichelle Nichols was quite under-used in TOS, to her and her fans' chagrin, but Saldana plays a large part of the plot here (especially one particular part, which I won't dwell on here, but remember --- This Is Not Your Father's ""Star Trek""). And hey --- we get to see her in her underwear. What's not for a Trekfan to like?

The stellar character portrayal, though, is Karl Urban's ""Bones"". It's absolutely spooky how well he played this character, making it his own while sometimes seeming almost to channel DeForrest Kelley. It's early McCoy, it's a tribute to Kelley, and it's a joy to watch. (And we find out how he got the nickname ""Bones"".)

Much was made before the movie's release about the look of the Enterprise. Yes, I too would probably have been a bit more nostalgic over seeing Roddenberry's original Enterprise, but remember --- This Is Not -- well, I've covered that.

Nothing in life is perfect, and I do have one large gripe with this movie. Not with the plot, the characters, or even the artistic aspects; it's with the photography. Specifically, the action scenes. Maybe it's because I'm 53 years old, wear bifocals, and was not sitting in the back of the theater, but the action shots were so jumpy, blurry, and disjointed that I could not follow anything that was happening in them. In short, the photography sucked. Now, I know that this style is the current fad among cinematographers (witness Battlestar Galactica and any number of small-screen productions that seem to love the ""un-steady-cam"" style), but to me this was a major fault in the production and the only thing I found to gripe about. C'mon, guys, all us old fogey Star Trek fans are already losing our vision; don't make it worse with this stuff.

All in all, I give this four-and-a-half stars (only deducting for the above-mentioned rant re photography). While I would not go so far as to call this ""the best Star Trek movie"" as some other reviewers here have done, it's definitely deserving of its accolades. When it comes out on home video, it will definitely have a place in my collection.",1243296000,14,3971,4.627840909090909
3472996,5,B001AVCFJM,"On the one hand, when a studio bankrolls a remake or a 'reboot' in this case, I feel the need to lament the lack of creativity, the lack of original thought at work in the Hollywood studio system. Can't anyone come up with anything new and original? But when the 'reboot' is as good as ""Star Trek"", I kind of wish J.J. Abrams was at the helm of them all. His new film adds richness and depth to a once ailing mythology bringing it back to life by going back to the beginning.

""Star Trek"" introduces us to Kirk (Chris Pine, ""Bottle Shock""), Spock (Zachary Quinto, TV's ""Heroes""), Bones (Karl Urban), McCoy (Simon Pegg, ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Hot Fuzz"", ""Run, Fatboy, Run""), Sulu (John Cho, ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle""), Chekhov (Anton Yelchin, ""Alpha Dog"") and Uhuru (Zoe Saldana, ""Drumline) on the first voyage of the U.S.S. Enterprise. As this is ""Star Trek: Origins"", if you will, writers Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzmann (""Transformers"", ""Cloverfield"") and director J.J. Abrams (TV's ""Lost"" and ""Alias"", ""Mission Impossible III"", ""Cloverfield"") have taken some liberties with the timeline and stayed true to other parts of the mythology. What this mix accomplishes is to give us a fresh take on these characters, allowing us to see how they got started and how they would become what they would become.

A rebellious kid, Jim Kirk (Pine) likes to race vehicles he doesn't own in his Iowa hometown. One day, he enters a bar filled with Starfleet Cadets and starts hitting on a beautiful woman. But Uhuru (Saldana) isn't interested and asks him to leave. A fight quickly develops and Kirk gets a bloody nose before Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) puts and end to the bar brawl. He sits Kirk down and explains he knows about him, about his father and challenges Kirk to join Starfleet and do better than his dad did. His dad died trying to save as many lives as possible when the U.S.S. Kelvin was under attack. The next morning, Kirk takes up the challenge and meets McCoy (Urban) a doctor who is also headed to Starfleet for training. Three years later, Kirk is taking the infamous Kobayashi Morou test again. And passes. Much to the astonishment of the test's creator, Commander Spock (Quinto), causing the two to become, at best, rivals. Just as an academic tribunal is called to investigate the charges against Kirk, Starfleet receives a distress signal from Vulcan. They quickly dispatch the recruits to new ships and eventually, everyone ends up on the Enterprise under Captain Pike's leadership. As they head out to assist the other star ships, Kirk becomes convinced they are about to enter an ambush and proves to be right. A Romulan mining vessel, led by Nero (Eric Bana, ""Hulk"", the upcoming ""Funny People"") is drilling into the core of Vulcan, causing seismic activity and he has just blown up the rest of the ships. The Enterprise takes evasive action, but Pike is soon summoned to the enemy vessel leaving Commander Spock in charge. He appoints Kirk his First Officer. The first order of business is to stop the drill and then save the Captain. But Nero proves a persistent villain and when he reveals what he really wants, everyone kicks into overdrive and start working together, becoming the team we all remember. Will Kirk and Spock learn to work together? Will everyone find their place on the Enterprise? Will this vessel staffed largely by new recruits be able to fight off the bent-on-revenge Nero?

Abrams has achieved the right balance of reverence to the characters and universe of these people while taking them to new and exciting places, bringing them alive for a new generation. It's really quite remarkable work when you think about all of the other needless remakes and reboots littering the Hollywood landscape.

All of the characters seem to have the trademark mannerisms of the television cast. Pine develops a telling swagger and bravado, very similar to William Shatner's portrayal of the role. More importantly, he doesn't display these mannerisms from the beginning; he grows into them as he develops the courage and bravery he will become known for. A friend saw a copy of Entertainment Weekly with Quinto as Spock on the cover sitting on my desk. ""How do you feel about them using a CGI character in this film?"" After a brief conversation, I learned he felt the character had to be CGI because he looked so similar to Leonard Nimoy's Spock, only a lot younger. I explained that an actor was playing the role and he was just amazed. Quinto was, reportedly, the first person hired for the film and he does an excellent job of making the character his own, while paying homage to Nimoy. Karl Urban seems to have a lot of fun paying the perpetually cross Dr. Bones McCoy, again adopting and paying homage to many of the character quirks DeForest Kelly used in his portrayal. Zoe Saldana is good as Uhuru. She and Kirk meet in the bar the night before they leave to join Starfleet and he continues to pine for her throughout the film. Her Uhuru is a little more fully integrated into the plot, a little more active, involving herself with Kirk and Spock. Anton Yelchin has some fun moments as the very young Chekhov. And John Cho. Well known for silly, raunchy comedies shows he may have some action chops on him. Sulu is also new to the Enterprise and has some growing pains. When Captain Pine picks Kirk and Sulu to lead a mission to stop a Romulan drilling device, they team up on a pretty terrifying and thrilling mission. And Sulu's unique skill set quickly comes in to play.

And that, is your crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Wait! Who am I forgetting? Ah yes, Scotty. Scotty is played by Simon Pegg, a British comedian who stars in a series of memorable films he co-wrote and co-directed (the best is ""Shaun of the Dead"") and he is clearly having a lot of fun playing the role. At one point, he shouts James Doohan's trademark phrase ""I'm giving her all she's got"" and it's nice to hear it even if it seems drowned out by the cacophony surrounding their battle. It is also interesting to see how Scotty joins the crew as he isn't on the ship when it leaves Starfleet.

Bruce Greenwood plays Captain Pine, the original commander of the new U.S.S. Enterprise. He does a good job displaying the right mixture of knowledge, leadership and mentoring to his young crew. More importantly, this is Abrams way of giving a little wink and a nod to the fact the original television series pilot was filmed with Captain Pine, not Kirk. The network didn't like it and Gene Rodenberry recast the role making William Shatner Captain Kirk. This pilot episode would eventually become the basis for a later two-part episode reusing much of the footage in flashback. An interesting move on both Rodenberry and Abrams' part.

Eric Bana plays Nero, once a simple miner trying to make a life for he and his expectant wife, who is now so hell-bent on revenge, he will destroy entire planets to achieve his goal. He is good, surprisingly, and displays both the right level of menace and humanity as displayed through his reasons for wanting to extract revenge. Bana was once the next big thing and starred in a series of films, none of which ever achieved much critical praise or box office clout. He is more interesting as the villain in this film than he was as the ""Hulk"" in the version directed by Ang Lee. He is following this film with a role in ""Funny People"", the new film from Judd Apatow starring Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Leslie Mann and Jonah Hill.

And I don't think I'm spoiling anything for anyone by mentioning that Leonard Nimoy makes an appearance as Spock. It is sort of thrilling to see him return to such an iconic role. Better yet, rather than a quick cameo, his appearance plays an integral role in the plot and he has a significant amount of screen time.

Perhaps best of all, none of the characters goes without creating at least one moment of levity. It is nice to see that while the material is taken very seriously, they also recognize we can have a bit of humor, to lighten up the serious nature of the story. Just a little.

Abrams has created a plot involving black holes, time travel (allowing him to include Nimoy) and revenge. It is an involving, complicated story that makes good use of the characters, their mythology and their backgrounds. It's a great ride and an almost perfect film.

I read an article about the making of this film and Abrams noted that when he was researching the material and watching the episodes of the television series, he noticed a lot of scenes had lens flares in front of the character's faces. This is yet another aspect Abrams chose to pay tribute to. And it is an interesting visual device the first dozen times or so. But when this continues throughout the entire film, sometimes more than once in a scene, it becomes distracting and annoying. In almost every scene, a bright light or a lens flare partially obscures at least one character's face for a few seconds before disappearing or lowering to return again. A few times, this is used as a transitional device, but more often than not, it simply becomes distracting.

Despite this one annoying (and constant) distraction, Abrams and his writing team have done an amazing job of bringing life back to familiar characters and a familiar mythology that we don't have to give up just yet. I can't wait to see what they come up with for the two sequels. Can Khan be far away?",1243209600,4,9420,4.671488848704039

3472998,5,B001AVCFJM,"Yes folks, Star Trek is back and back in a big way.  Be warned that spoilers are ahead, but considering the plot of J.J. Abrams' reboot of Gene Roddenberry's legendary franchise has been pretty much out in the open, I'm probably not saying anything that you don't already know anyway.  It all begins with the vengeful Romulan Nero (Eric Bana) coming back in time to wreak havoc on the Federation, so much so that it impacts the history and continuity that die hard Trekkies will no doubt find bones to pick with.  From that point forward, we are introduced to the young and reckless James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) who is convinced by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to enlist in Starfleet.  It isn't long before Kirk is at odds with Spock (Heroes' Zachary Quinto); who himself is an outcast among his own Vulcan people, and shares a rocky relationship with his Vulcan father Sarek (Ben Cross) and human mother Amanda (Winona Ryder).  The dynamic and groundwork laid of Kirk and Spock's relationship is what helps make Abrams' take on Star Trek so good, as he modernizes nearly everything that Trek fans hold dear (seeing young Kirk driving to the Beastie Boys' ""Sabotage"" may be overdoing it a bit, but hey...), yet he manages to pay enough homage to the original series while putting his own spin on things.  Pine and especially Quinto are surprisingly wonderfully cast and Kirk and Spock, as is Karl Urban as McCoy, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Simon Pegg in an all too brief turn as Scottie, and Bana as Nero; who is undoubtedly the best Trek film villain since Khan.  John Cho as Sulu and Anton Yelchin as Chekov are fine in their relatively small turns as the film moves along with a nicely brisk pace, but the real surprise manages to be the emotional chords that Abrams pulls; whether it be the destruction of the planet Vulcan or the appearance and guidance of old Spock (Leonard Nimoy), who foretells his past self and Kirk alike that their bond and friendship is more than paramount.  With brilliant effects, epic space battles, and overall dynamite action scenes; this is the Star Trek for a new generation that we have all wanted and rightly deserve.  Now here's hoping that Abrams can manage to pull another rabbit out of his hat with the series someday further down the line.",1243123200,3,2289,4.688279301745636

There were happy moments, sad moments and lots of action in between.  It is by far one of the best science fiction movies I have ever seen.  The actors did excellent jobs representing their characters and I am looking very forward to any and all seqeuels.

Star Trek was made by the creators of Lost which is also my favorite TV show.  If the Star Trek Blu-Ray is anything like the Lost DVDs and Blu-Rays then it should be packed with lots and lots of extras.  I can't wait!!  I don't even have a blu-ray player or HDTV but will have one when this movie comes out to buy.  I will be the first in line!",1243123200,7,743,4.287769784172662
3473001,1,B001AVCFJM,"Ussually I don't mind if the roles of characters are pased onto a new cast in a movie or television series, so long as they keep true to what made the show special.  For example: When the new Battlestar Galactica came out on SCI-FI, I was at first a little skeptical, but decided to give it a chance to see what it could do.  To my surprise, I was most pleased with the changes.  I decided to employ this same technique with the new Star Trek.  I was NOT pleased with the results and I'm starting to believe Hollywood is getting desperate.

First off, let me talk about the characters.  Though I admit that the director selected a cast that resembles the old characters, I do not think he portrayed them well.  If anything, the script was beyond cheesy and hard to believe.  There were several instances in the movie where I wondered ""who talks like this?"".  For example, the test Kirk was trying to pass, was completely chesey.  Kirk was just to arogant.  The scene would have probably worked if Kirk acted serious and played out the test, and then gave a smug smile to his bewildered superiors after he passed.  Instead, the director gave him an apple.  Who eats an apple while taking a military excercise?

Another quarel I had was the scenery.  Though the staff had done a pretty good job with the bridge of the Enterprise, that's all they worked on.  Nero's ship was a complete mess where I could not tell what was what.  Also, you would think that there would be ""walkways"" between all the open platforms.  The Enterprise engine room was especially degrating.  The set was nothing more then the inside of a brewery with a radioactive label slapped on a tank.  To add insult to injury, I only saw one or two engineers per scene in the engine room.  Hello.  Radioactive material.  Antimatter.  Things that make the ship fly!  Who's managing all that?  Better yet, how are they controlling what happens inside?  They could have at least put some computer consoles inside to show how the engines are maintained.  Even a warp core would do (yes, the original star trek had a warp core.  The engine room was on top of it).

And the biggest problem: theme.  Every previous Star Trek film dealt with theme that focused on what it means to be human.  For example:
Star Trek 1: Needidng some one for support (V'ger needed guidance).
Stat Trek 2: Revenge (Khan wanting vengeance)
Star Trek 3: The value of friendship (Kirk doing what ever it took to get Spock back)
Star Trek 4: The desire to be home (the crew's main objective was to return home, even though they were criminals)
Star Trek 5: Exploring a person's faith
Star Trek 6: How some people fear the future
Star Trek Generations: The desire to have a family and make a difference.
Star Trek First Contact: Revenge (Picard wanting to destroy the Borg.  Unlike Khan, Picard learned the error in his ways)
Star Trek Insurection: Focused on a part of our history when cowboys forced Indians off their land.
Star Trek Nemesis: Explores the differences between someone who aspires to be more and someone who does not.

Star Trek 2009: ?????.  I have no clue.  The characters didn't learn anything or make any changes.  No lessons on humanity or definitions that show us what makes us human.  Just kill the bad guy and save the world.

All in all, this is not Star Trek.  Only the title says otherwise.  No effort was really made to focus on characteriztion or plot of the story.  Call it something else, but don't call it Star Trek.",1243123200,23,3480,4.546774193548387
3473002,5,B001AVCFJM,"Last year, when I learned that a new Star Trek movie was due to be released in 2009, my heart was compounded with both eagerness...and doubt. Eager, because upon seeing the name J.J. Abrams at the helm, I knew he was going to make it great. But at the same time, I had doubt if I ever going to like the movie at all. I mean, look at Star Wars! Although I did watch the three Star Wars movies when I was a kid, I never did become an avid fan. Thanx to George Lucas for coming up with those crappy prequels (ok, so Sith was slightly better than the first two), now I kinda' hate Star Wars.

Likewise, I was never a Trekkie. Well, I may recognise some of the characters from the TV show and know what the story revolved around, but only vaguely. If The Simpsons hadn't used Leonard Nimoy as a guest voice in some of its episodes, I might not even know there was a character named Spock Prime. True, the Star Trek movies starring Patrick Stewart (who also played Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men franchise) as Captain Jean-Luc Picard were quite recent, but they failed to attract me to become a fan.

But when I saw the trailers some months back (Trailer 3 is somewhat more touching), I knew that Abrams will be taking us for a thrill ride. My doubt was immediately replaced with uncontrollable anticipation.

Gladly, my anticipation was met with satisfaction. Heck, I dragged my wife along just to watch it again, and she too, had enjoyed it and both of us are non-Trek followers.

For most movies, they usually left me awed only when the end credits started rolling in or after I left the cinema. But for Star Trek, it made my jaw dropped even at the beginning of the movie, and my jaw continued to drop (literally) at most times throughout the movie. Yes, it is THAT good!!!

What made Star Trek such an unforgettable movie? Well, for a start - it is a fun movie and full of action right from the start - from the attack on USS Kelvin, to when younger Kirk destroys the classic car (for no apparent reason), and the fight scene between Kirk and Sulu with some bad Romulans on the drill machine, right up to the climax battle sequences. Seeing the characters running (usually to save themselves or others) for most of the time, indicates that this movie is a fast paced one and moviegoers should stay glued to the screen and in their seats - like when the 800 souls are 'fleeing' for their lives, or when Kirk rushes (with McCoy and Uhura entails behind him) to prevent the USS Entreprise from falling into the trap, or when Spock and the Vulcan elders are running out of the cave, or when Kirk is trying to save himself from being eaten by the (cool) space monsters on Delta Vega, or how about when Earth's core is being drilled from space and the Earthlings are running towards it, wondering what it is (the drill machine is a reminiscence of the Alien space craft from the Independence Day movie - with hot, fiery beam fired from the centre of the craft and the beam is protected by circular side walls. In Star Trek, it is the side wall that Sulu uses to bounce himself back up to safety).

Despite its fast pace, all the main characters (the good guys and the 'bad' ones) are properly introduced and developed - we either love them or hate them. The movie also invokes our tear 'glands'. Both Kirk and Spock lose a parent in tragic turn of events! Our hero James T. Kirk is both beaten (his dad dies, and so, he settles for a less-than-ordinary life) and got beaten up rather badly, I mean...literally. First, the bar fight, then by Spock and towards the end of the movie, by some Romulans thugs. The Romulans are headed by Nero, played by Eric Bana (Bana is clean shaven and tattoed - making him almost unrecognisable). We also feel for Spock, with personality crisis (half human/half Vulcan) and trying hard not to be emotionally compromised after witnessing the tragedy that befalls his mother (an older and taller Winona Ryder) and home planet.

In one memorable scene, Abrams brilliantly puts all the (good) characters on the bridge. Totally priceless, especially for the fans!

The movie provides good comic relief when Kirk is trying hard to get Uhura's first name, or seeing Kirk's reaction to those numerous vaccine shots, or Chekov's first scene with his accent, or Scotty and his false calculation when transporting Kirk and Spock right in the middle of the enemies.

Go watch this one! So what if you don't understand those sci-fi technical stuffs like 'external inertial damper' or you worry if you can't fully appreciate the characters. The movie calls for repeat viewing, for fans (of the Star Trek franchise) and non-fans alike. After all, the Rolling Stone calls it as a 'Pure Filmmaking Exhilaration' and 'An Irresistable Invitation For Fun', and Access Hollywood ""The First 'Star Trek' For Everyone"" (true indeed), and Newsweek with its simple yet accurate two-word review to sum it up - ""Way Cool"".

3473003,4,B001AVCFJM,"I thought this was a great movie with a weak plot (I know that sounds contradictory). The film had  great acting, character development, special effects, etc. - perhaps the best of any Trek film. I loved the way the film tied together the main TOS characters.

On the other hand, I thought the plot was a bit too  grandiose - especially for a 2-hour film. I won't reveal any spoilers, but I will say a lot changed in the Star Trek universe - yet, it seemed way too quick. I'm not a Trek purist, but I just felt like the whole ""villain develops planet-destroying technology"" plot has been done a bit too much (e.g., Wrath of Khan, Generations, Insurrection, Nemesis) that the actual storyline seemed mundane. However, the character development and the chance to see Kirk, Spock, and Bones on the big screen more than compensated.

Trek purists beware!",1243036800,,850,4.684563758389261
3473004,5,B001AVCFJM,"Well! Now that I've finally seen it, I can comment: Brilliant!
I think my favourite aspect of this film is the fact that it doesn't in ANY way detract from what has come before. Does it rewrite the entire history of the franchise? Yes. Does it irrevocably alter characters that we have come to know and love? Yup. Does it take cheap shots at the original shows for laughs? You betcha. And does it do all of this with reverence and grace, without sacrificing the dignity of a 42 year old legend? Absolutely!
I'll admit that I was very worried. As updates go, this one wasn't really necessary. The beauty of the Star Trek universe is that it really is big enough to tell whatever stories one would like. It doesn't have to be about Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the U.S.S. Enterprise. For examples, see any of the countless books and comic books that have valiantly carried the franchise along while its presence has been lacking from television airewaves. So when I heard that this film would be revamping the series from the beginning, I had visions of a television hack (non other than the creator of ""Lost,"" ""Alias"" and, ahem, ""Felicity""?!?, J.J. Abrams) reinventing the wheel for lack of better ideas. Boy, was I wrong!
This story lovingly recreates the Star Trek universe from scratch, choosing the best elements of the original series, trimming away what no longer really works and retooling only the elements that were outdated. There are plenty of new ideas and in-jokes for fans of the original series while introducing Gene Roddenberry's wonderful vision of the future to a whole new generation. The action and excitement will leave you breathless on the edge of your seat. But the plot is clever, thoughtful, detailed and intelligent. Cliched as it may sound, there really is something here for everyone.
Rather than insulting Gene Roddenberry's genius vision, this film demonstrates that the original ideas behind Star Trek are just as valid today as they were in 1967. Then, as today, our world stood in conflict, chaos and bloodshed. But this vision of the future is one in which people of differing races, cultures, and even species work and live together to face the challenges that lie ahead. Star Trek once again points the way to a better, brighter tomorrow.",1243036800,2,2269,4.805626598465473
3473005,5,B001AVCFJM,"Before entering Star Trek, you should know that you might find more of a character-driven drama rather than your typical summer action flick. Sure, there's special effects and action, but it's one of the more uninteresting elements of the movie, but then again, the movie doesn't really need it as J.J. Abrams aims to start anew with the franchise and remind the millions why they fell in love with it in the first place.

At first, the movie starts off as a prequel in the traditional sense that it follows how the main characters came to be, and why they come to do what they eventually do. Here, Abrams takes his time to design these familiar characters from the fatherless and rebellious James T. Kirk, to the outcast Spock who is constantly trying to find a place for himself in the universe. Raised by circumstance, driven by a search of destiny, the pair soon find their paths, personalities cross, and clash at Starfleet Academy. Of course, fate eventually lead the duo at odds to find themselves on the christening voyage of the U.S.S. Enterprise, which happens to make a run-in with the exact same villain who had killed Kirk's father some minutes before his birth. Strangely enough, the villain is looking for revenge... What Star Trek villain hasn't wanted that before? Make no mistake about it; Eric Bana would be a wasted one-dimensional character if you could tell it was Eric Bana beneath all that makeup.

Of course, the plot doesn't do your mind any favors either because by the end of the movie it's not really a prequel since by the use of time-travel the adventures you've known from the faithful crew never really happened. No Kahn, no whales in San Francisco, no drawn-out scenes of inter-galactic diplomacy. Yet, by the genius of J.J. Abrams none of this really matters while you're watching the movie, mainly because of the likable and relatable characters.

The casting is also inspired as Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto come into their own as actors as they give these familiar characters the twists and turns as they make them their own. Even the supporting cast brings new life to relatively limited personalities. Karl Urban who pays tribute to DeForest Kelly in every line he utters as the wisecracking and supportive Dr. McCoy. Zoe Saldana whose character of Uhura is actually given a purpose within in the series, and accentuates the polarizing personalities of Kirk and Spock. May I also mention that the supposed love-triangle in the movie is greatly exaggerated from scenes of flirting.

Another key that Star Trek so surprisingly good is the fact that it's directed by a minor Star Trek fan who brings a filmmaker's prospective to the series, and two self-proclaimed Trekkie screenwriters, who also happened to pen the Transformers series. Star Trek is a mix of fandom and good filmmaking that is sure to please both fans and non-fans alike. If anything, the stage is set for a killer sequel.

On A Random Note: According to this movie, in the future Iowa not only has canyons, but becomes quite the industrial powerhouse building various starships. Who knew corn country who become such a bustling place in the future?

This new version of Trek, with young actors playing the younger versions of the TOS crew, is exciting from beginning to end, with lots of action, adventure, humor, and creativity.  You have to keep up with the time travel twists, courtesy of LOST co-creator JJ Abrams.  And a certain very important planet filled with pointy-eared folk disappears. This makes certain events of the later series impossible.  You might also find it odd that Spock and Uhura have a thing for each other and don't hide it, that Sulu carries a sword into battle, that some Romulans have tattoos, and that Sarek looks awfully old and is awfully nice to young Spock--much nicer than he was in TOS.  Chris Pine has blue eyes, which Kirk never did.  And Uhura is little more than eye candy.
  If you can handle all of that, though, you will like the movie.  The fellow playing Chekov is adorable, while Karl Urban really takes the cake as McCoy.  Zachary Quinto is a marvel as Spock.  It would be nice to see more prequels, actually.  And we still don't know all the events that transpired while these folks were going through the academy.
  A great summer popcorn movie for sure.",1242864000,2,1175,4.668292682926829
3473009,5,B001AVCFJM,"Having watched the original series as a teenager, I was not too sure what to expect from this reincarnation of an American icon.  All I have to say is that I was not prepared for the next two hours.

There were familiarity as well as twists and turns with several shocks tossed into this stew.  At times I said to myself how could they do that or why change the original storyline?

At the end as the credits began and that music which we all knew so well, I said to myself that was exciting.  It all made sense.

There were some very sad scenes.  There were many heroic moments in the face of  death.

The Enterprise was a marvel to behold.  You could see how over four hundred federation representatives could fit on this flagship.

The actors did a noble job of living up to the legends with some twists.  The love interest was, well, you have to see it for your self.

If you go see this with a lot of Star Trek lore tucked away in your brain, be prepared to be unnerved.  If you know little of the original series or films, then this should give you a good introduction to the mythology which has been a part of our culture for the last 43 years.

Was it perfect?  No, but it came close.",1242864000,4,1192,4.162280701754386
3473010,5,B001AVCFJM,"""Star Trek"" is not perfect, but its few fumbles are easy to forgive. This movie managed to do the impossible: It created a whole new generation of fans without alienating the majority of the old ones.

What makes this movie work is that it preserves the essence of Star Trek, but discards all the hokey, cheesy, over the top parts of the original. What have propelled all the ST iteration was the dynamics of the principal characters, as they face various dangers and challenges. In a ways it is a brothers in arms in space story. Sticking to that make this movie work. The whole cast does an excellent job channelling the spirit of the original characters without turning into cartoony copies of them. Especially successful is Chis Pine who channels Kirk's persona without all the mannerism and hamminess of Shatner. He even manages to infuse Kirk's trademark swagger with a bit of boyish charm. Zachary Quinto is an amazingly good match as young Spock. He not only looks strikingly similar to Nemoy, but is very believable as a younger version of the vulcan.

A lot of the credit goes to the writers. What they did with the time line allowed the freedom to focus on the essence of the franchise without having to tiptoe around the established canon at every turn. It was a stroke of genius, but the real achievement is that they managed create a solid script, introducing all the principal characters, give them all a chance the distinguish themselves, and even have a suspenseful plot - and all that before the viewer's bladder would explode.

The high production values also pay off. The special effects do exactly what they are supposed to do: make the action believable without drawing undue attention to themselves. The red alien beast on the ice planet is maybe just a touch too much, but its appearance is brief.

Another thing I really enjoyed about this movie is that it is basically optimistic, uplifting. I'm sick to death of all the grimy, bleak stories that get you more depressed coming out of the theater than going in. Sometimes you just want a well written, fun, suspenseful escapist movie.",1242777600,4,2109,4.754098360655738
3473011,5,B001AVCFJM,"I've watched nearly every Star Trek episode out there, starting with Kirk and even catching the spin off Deep Space Nine.  The only Treks I missed were the ""Enterprise"" series.  I irritated me to no end that Vulcans had emotions and I was convinced that without Gene Roddenberry one of my favorite SF stories was doomed.

I was torn when I saw the previews for the new Trek.  I was excited to continue the journey, but didn't want to be disappointed.  I almost didn't go to see this opening weekend.... boy am I glad I took the chance.

Not only did this movie manage to work within the set parameters of the Star Trek Universe, it gave us a glimpse of the characters we love in a brand new light.  I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say we know that the time-line can be messed with, right?

Spock (Zachary Quinto) will not have to take a backseat to Kirk (Chris Pine) on this Trek.  Spock shares fully with Kirk in every way - even Captaincy.  Zachary's portrayal of the Vulcan was spot-on. (With his eyebrows tweezed you didn't even think Sylar!)

Chris Pine, while still giving a good rendition of Kirk's womanizing side, does and excellent job hammering home that Kirk is a total bad boy, pushing the envelope, risk taking and loving every wild minute of it.

Bones (Karl Urban) was irreplaceable. Not only did he physically remind us of Bones, he delivered his lines every bit a uniquely sardonic as Deforest Kelly.  He pulled off the ""you green-blooded hobgoblin"" flawlessly.  The interaction between Kirk, Spock and Bones lost nothing, in fact I think it gained in depth.

Scotty (Simon Pegg) was a pleasant surprise.  Making his debut near the end of the show, he brought a fresh splash of humor.  With any luck they will broaden his roll in the future beyond ""I'm given' her all she's got.""  Simon's proved he can handle it with the little they gave him in my book.

Chekov, Uhura, and Sulu - small parts but not small actors.  It takes a team to make an excellent movie and though they may be in the outfield, their supporting rolls were not in any way overlooked.  You get a better feel for them in the short time they appear.

Complaints:

Only one - and it's very minor.  Spock is supposed to be around 100 to Kirk's 30 something in the original.  That should have remained the same.  But the way the intro is set up, you don't really get that with this movie; you could really think they were born around the same time.

All things considered, this is a small and easily overlooked flaw.  Any SF fan will love this movie and if you Trekkies don't, well, what more can you expect.  This movie really had it all.  Great cast, solid plot, awesome special effects and even a dash of romance.  It is my favorite movie in many years (and I see most of the new releases.)",1242777600,2,2785,4.433925049309665

3473013,5,B001AVCFJM,"Went seeing it expecting nothing...there certainly have a couple of big summer movies that completely have disappointed the fanbase by mishandling characters for movie adaptions (see X-MEN Origins Wolverine)
but I liked this new Star Trek movie. Granted there were a lot of Sci-Fi action cliches but what I was wondering to see here is how they would again these lovable characters from TV show for another movie. I don't think this was a huge risk like others have said because Star Trek has a loyal fanbase. Anyways.

Story (Spoilers)

Spock from the future tries to prevent a star from going supernova
because it will destroy the planet Romulus. He fails and so Nero holds him responsible and spends 25 years plotting his revenge along with fighting the federation.

J.J Abrams did a good job. The movie you can watch it as a stand alone sci-fi movie or watch it as part of the Star Trek universe. Opinions vary of course. I see people and some Trekkies who don't like it, but I don't care much about because in the end it's about whether I enjoyed the movie.

I watched all the TV shows from TOS to Voyager and Enterprise. Anyhow, for me I thought J.J. Abrams did more than a decent job here. The film is well polished and obviously had a huge budget so it would deliver on action and special effects. Of course all that doesn't matter if the actors do a good job or the characters don't remain true to themselves so...

Kirk-Chris Pine

As expected he stayed true to the Kirk character. Pretty much a rebel that would do what he wants when he wants to. He is also still a womanizer (I don't know how someone could say his character was completely revised. Anyhow) I loved the scenes with him and Uhura. However, there was also a side of him like in the TV show that obviously cared about his comrades and his duties to the ship.

Bones-Karl Urban. Again stay true to the character. Bones has always been a textbook play by the rules character but again like Kirk saw the need to bend the rules when it matters. I think Deforest Kelley would have liked Urban's portrayal of Bones.

Spock-Zachary Quinto-This is probably the most ""human"" characterization of Spock ever. He lets his emotions show and isn't afraid to let others know it. Quinto delivers Spock in a way that stays true to his Vulcan roots but presents the human persona that Leonard Nimoy did so well in the series.

Nero-Eric Bana. Pretty good for the villain although Nero's type has been done over and over and isn't anything new (another psycho villain who attempts to blame someone for something they didn't do)

Christopher Pike- Bruce Greenwood-Another excellent choice. Bruce is an actor that's been around almost forever. He's the one that invites Kirk to join the Academy and to remind Kirk of the heroic deeds that his father did in the hopes that Kirk will also be a great leader.

I could go on the list but everyone did a good job. Obviously having Leonard Nimoy play Spock was a big vote of confidence that he loved the movie and recommended it.

I enjoyed it.",1242777600,16,3042,4.571691176470588
3473014,4,B001AVCFJM,"Just about everybody knows the stories revolving around the U.S.S. Enterprise and it's crew lead by Captain James Tiberius Kirk. This reboot is an alternate reality to what happened in those familiar stories chronicling the early days of how the crew came together, went through the ranks of star fleet, and basically became the characters every Trekkie knows and loves today. The only issues this movie may have had was if it would appeal to people who weren't fans of the original Star Trek and if it would be enjoyable to those people. Considering it was the number one movie in the country in its opening weekend, brought in another $43 million its second weekend in theaters (bringing its grand total to over $147 million), and has glowing reviews on both IMDb (8.5/10, over 50,000 votes, #71 in the top 250 movies) and Rotten Tomatoes (95% fresh, 245 fresh reviews, rated 8.1/10), the answer seems obvious.

Star Trek exceeded all of my expectations. I'm not a Trekkie, but this is the movie that should have kicked off the summer season. The film is somehow capable of keeping the same essence of the original series yet inject a breath of fresh air into the franchise with new faces representing familiar characters. The film really appears to a wide range of moviegoers since it has just about everything anyone is looking for when they go to the movies and affectively blends action, comedy, sci-fi, and romance into one sensational adventure. The cast is truly superb. Karl Urban practically channeled DeForest Kelley in his portrayal of Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy and Simon Pegg as Scotty stole every scene he was in. Zachary Quinto fit the young Spock character like a glove. I could go on and on. There really wasn't a poor performance from anyone.

The only minor complaint I have about the film was the lens flare effect they seemed to use throughout the film. It was hardly noticeable at times, but I remember it being a bit irritating towards the last half of the film. Other than that, I'd like to see more of Scotty in the sequel. But that's more of a suggestion than anything.

Star Trek is a fun and exciting film that's really for everyone. The film is a little over two hours long, but it feels much shorter. If you were waiting to see that one entertaining film that really starts the movie season off with a bang, then this is it. Go ahead and group this with Batman Begins as one of the successful reboots that's also incredibly enjoyable.",1242691200,,2465,4.688221709006928
3473015,3,B001AVCFJM,"This movie isn't terrible and by Star Trek movies' abysmal standards it is a real triumph.
If your curious to read an honest response from a less overwhelmed film goer, be my guest...

Criticisms-
In my HUMBLE opinion, the story is kinda weak. Star Trek is more space opera now than science fiction. I always thought the original Star Wars was a great space opera and Star Trek, when done well, was better as geeky, heady sci-fi. (Wrath of Khan, notwithstanding.)

Nero is ""disturbed"" and an idiot. Just another uninteresting one dimensional villain (although passionately played by talented Eric Bana).

Time travel is always absurd, and I have mixed feelings about its use in this case. Is it so easy? And if so, if there are genocidal nutjobs flying around like Nero how are there any planets left? I feel for Spock. (Geeez I know the guy is pretty stoic, but after years of heroic deeds, saving countless lives, he must endure this?) Why not just go back and change history again? Maybe they will! Why not? And, by the way, knowing about this central aspect of the plot effectively spoiled the movie for me. That's my fault, but I do wonder how well the movie will hold up over time.

The guy they have playing Kirk lacks charisma-unlike Shatner- and I don't mean to sound funny, but he doesn't exactly look like a ladies man. Well it's all in the attitude and cockiness of course, but his looks are average and he doesn't seem ""alpha-male"" to me (lol). Anyway.

And then your beaten over the head with almost nonstop ""action"" as if this were specifically made for attention deficit disorder inflicted ""generation y"" teenager video game junkies that can't sit still and follow dialog or tolerate more than 2 minutes of downtime.

Some of the humor and ""comical"" alien characters were lame. Maybe trying to please the age 5 and under crowd?

While watching this movie I felt like it was so obviously made to appeal to everybody as much as possible and I don't respect that or think it is the way to make a great movie. This thing is lauded as a movie people that don't like Star Trek can like! And people that don't like science fiction---What's up with that anyway? That isn't necessarily good, nor is it respectful of people that do like science fiction. You nerds!

Highlights-
The opening scenes were genuinely intense. I overall loved the casting and seeing the younger versions of classic characters played by new, young actors was really entertaining in itself. The new Spock was a highlight, as was Bones. Time travel and rewriting history was an interesting and bold way to re-boot the franchise for sure. The Enterprise can really fight now, lighting up with multiple lasers and I dug that. There were *some* truly funny moments. Some cool shots of Federation headquarters and Vulcan.

Legions of Star Trek fans and even the film critic community really wanted to love this movie. (95% ""fresh"" rating on RT last I looked! Hmmm, this movie is that great?? Wow.) Rare for a sci-fi movie to be this well received. If YOU loved it I'm happy for you.",1242691200,8,3058,4.679702048417132
3473016,4,B001AVCFJM,"*SPOILERS*

For the most part I was impressed, but I was left a little confused and may need to see it again.

I mean, was this a reboot or Star Trek: The Origin?

If it was in fact a reboot, why was that necessary? If it isn't, why did it feel like one?

To be totally candid, I am a casual Trekkie and prefer the eccentricity of the original series over the slicker incarnations.

But as a comics fan, I have a deep respect for canon and the history and tradition it brings and know that new followers can be drawn into a shared universe without being alienated or alienating the already converted.

Needless to say the special effects were absolutely superb, the first twenty minutes being one of the greatest cinematic thrillrides I have experienced in recent memory.

And the casting was perfect. I got such a kick out of seeing fellow Gen X-ers take hold of these beloved, classic characters and make them their own, particularly actors who I hate to say never appeared in a movie I actually liked before.

Simon Pegg was BORN to play Scotty, not some goofball in ""Shaun of the Dead.""

Harold Cho was BORN to assume the mantle of Sulu, not appear in another ""Harold and Kumar"" movie or other such frat-boy, bathroom fare.

And who the hell else could have pulled off Spock but Zach Quinto? Again, talk about being BORN to play a role, talk about inspiring, and again, that extends to all who starred in it. Well done. In fact the acting was what made for the greatest scene in the film, one that didn't involve an ounce of studio wizardry.

It was when Uhura trying to comfort a grieving Spock after losing his mother and his home planet, and it's revealed that they are in fact lovers. That to me was as breathtaking as any big space-opera battleship clash.

Also, I think it's safe to say that Chris Pine has firmly established himself here, in his portrayal of James T. Kirk, as an action star for the next decade. Call me crazy, but he reminded be of Robert Conrad a bit, and was every bit the wild, two-fisted, skirt-chaser one would imagine a young Kirk to be.

But the story? Um, it left me with somewhat of a headache.

Time travel tales have a knack for doing that to me.

Why did the old Spock have to meet the young Spock? Isn't that sort of thing really bad, as in paradox, as in unraveling all that was, is, and ever shall be bad?

Sorry.

Not that it hindered my enjoyment so much as to leave me disappointed as the closing credits rolled. To me, this installment wasn't really about anything more than how the Star Trek crew we all know got started. It wasn't about scientific, philosophical, or ethical questions. It wasn't intended to make you think. This is the new radio-friendly Trek, Trek done in true summertime blockbuster fashion, a Trek that people who don't dress up as Klingons will enjoy, and that's fine I guess, but...

...I think the script could have been even better.

I read about the various unrealized Trek films in the book ""The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made,"" and after watching this chrome-plated edition of the franchise, I'm left wondering what the hell would have been so bad about The  Academy Years concept? Am I also the only one who would have rather the makers of this film have used ""The Planet of the Titans"" script or Harlan Ellison's tale of a reptilian take-over of time and space? I think one of those concepts, merged with a ""Year One"" type of story, would have satisfied the hardcore fan's desire for a lofty, intellectual, grand, mythic epic and would have more than held a novice Trekkie's interest at the same time.

However, despite my qualms, this is the Trek film that had to be made in order to inject the dying franchise with a new life. That alone is reason for any movie or genre fan to celebrate. In these uncertain, divisive times, we need Gene Roddenberry's optimistic, Utopian, very 60's (in style and spirit) vision of the future as much as we ever have. In that regard, Messrs. Orci, Kurtzman, and Abrams have certainly performed capably in what is essentially the celluloid equivalent of rescue mission. Thank you for saving a mythos. You have plenty of stories left to tell.",1242604800,,4157,4.530748663101604
3473017,3,B001AVCFJM,"While watching Star Trek, I felt a sense of wonderment and awe. The special effects are great. The score was soaring and kept the pace.

Overall, the movie was entertaining. Is it perfect? No, not even close.

Could the story have been better? Yes. It borrowed heavily on ideas that have been presented before. Time travel in a Star Trek movie?

During the movie, some things did not make sense. The Red Matter that causes or creates the conditions for black holes, wasn't explained to the extent that it should have been.

If one drop of the red stuff can destroy a planet, then a whole sphere full smashing into an enemy ship, would do what? Wouldn't it create something greater and massive than a black hole?

A creature chasing and falling down a mountain, crashing into a cave entrance, only to be thwarted by a torch? In the same scene, coincidentally introduce a familiar main character. It was hastily written, to say the least.

It would be great if they have an extended cut of the film, that maybe adds more depth to certain scenes.

This is, after all, Star Trek, to boldly go where no man and no one has gone before.

Yet, now, it seems to set out to boldly go where we have been before, time and time again.",1242604800,,1221,4.443946188340807
3473018,5,B001AVCFJM,"This was a great renewal of the Star Trek saga. The film was handled in a manner where we can accept the significant differences -- and often departures -- between the original 1960s television series and the 2009 film.  In this case the changes are attributed to the accidental interruption of the original time line by the unintentional time travel of a large Romulan vessel.  The Romulan ship appears at the moment of James T. Kirk's birth and its destruction of the George Kirk's star ship forever changes history.  As such Federation technology took a leap forward with the new Enterprise appearing as a hybrid of the original starship with the more modern saucer and scanner of the STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE Enterprise.

There are countless links in this film to the original television series whether it be some of the sound effects, dialogue, or references to people and places mentioned in the television show or subsequent movies.  Still you have to approach this movie as a very different Star Trek.  This movie is as different from the original cast Star Trek movies as the Daniel Craig James Bond films are from Sean Connery's Bond in DR. NO.

All in all the new STAR TREK is action packed from the opening scenes through to the end.  Yes, I did miss the familiar faces from the original Trek movies, but nothing is forever.

There were a couple deviations from Trek canon in this film. The first is that it essentially places James T. Kirk in command of the Enterprise at the conclusion of this third year at the academy.  Even with an intergalactic emergency this would be unlikley. Three years of service would hardly have afforded Kirk the Starfleet rank of captain.  It would be more realistic to have Kirk graduate from the academy, serve in more junior officer positions (ensign, lieutenant junior grade, lieutenant, lieutenant commander, and commander) for several tours in space before attaining his own permanent command.  Based on the current movie, Uhura would have been senior to Kirk and would have been further up in the command waiting line.  Kirk's award of a command -- no doubt bypassing hundreds of other more senior officers waiting their selection -- was a cinematic vehicle to get a youthful crew aboard the Enterprise quickly.

The other event that is not fully explained in STAR TREK is the whereabouts of the rogue Romulan mining ship for 25 years.  The large Romulan mining ship, complete with drilling device that can be lowered from the mothership through the atmosphere of the target planet, is sucked into a black hole and appears almost two hundred years in the past.  After the mining ship's encounter with the first starship it disappears for 25 years.  Where was it during that time frame?  Very possible that answer ended up on the cutting room floor.

It was great to see Leonard Nimoy as Spock.  William Shatner was approached to provide a cameo role, but reportedly insisted on side by side screen time with Nimoy.  As Shatner's Kirk was killed in STAR TREK GENERATIONS his appearance would have been difficult to explain in the new STAR TREK.  Alas, Shatner declined the offer to provide a recorded greeting.

Now that the characters have been re-established in STAR TREK it will be interesting to see what happens in subsequent adventures.",1242604800,2,3297,4.848214285714286
3473019,5,B001AVCFJM,"Several times, Star Trek has exhausted it potential, only to be renewed.  While I enjoyed the first series the most when it came out and watched it for years as reruns, I really got into the Next Generation (after initial resistance).  TNG was not just a re-tread, but a culmination and maturation of themes evident in the first series.

Kirk would blast his way out of a complicated situation, with some cheesy philosophical observations that rang just true enough.  I loved all of it totally, non-critically, to the point that I did not question it until I was iddle aged.  It is the best show that I ever knew.  Period.  You got all the great hard sci-fi themes:  time travel, a new kind of empire, wonderful characters in complicated cultures, and technological power pushing the edge of science.  Indeed, not to exaggerate, it informed my intellectual pursuits through college.

Then, after lot of junk TV, I discovered how fabulous TNG was:  rather than military and impetuous, it was studied, disciplined, and diplomatic.  Once again, it synched with my interests:  international relations and institutions, cultures, historical influences, simple alien mystery.  TNG was even better than the original, though emotionally I will always prefer Kirk and Spock,

Deep Space 9 and Voyager seemed like pale attempts to breath life into the series.  As a friend of mine said, ""none of the aliens are intersting.""  Neither series did a heckuvalot for me.  I could watch them, but I always felt a ""so what"" in the back of my mind.

So here we are.  I think that this film may be a successful reinvention.  Because of a time warp, an alternate reality is created, complete with two Spocks existing in the same space.  This alters the universe, opening possibilities for an entirely new series, one up to date in ways I can't imagine or articulate.  OK, I though the resoltion of this film was a bit under par, like the origianl TV series a bit impetuous, but the themes work and are pretty deep with fun variation.  Will Spock and Uhura have a love child?  How will Spock's relation with his father change?  What is Kirk like without having grown up with his father?  Fun stuff for the greatest (and most profitable) franchise hollywood ever created.

Kirk and Spock team up to - guess what? BLOW UP THE DEATH STAR!

Young Spock flies his little ship thru nooks and crannies of Nero's death star until he blows it up; Kirk gets awards, applause, etc; all that's missing are the goofy baby-names from Star Wars (at least nobody's called Captain Boobbo or Googgo or Jarjar)

I thought all the characters were well done, the writing was good, the story was fun, and I loved the very end sequence (it actually took me by surprise a bit).

My only dislike (and keep in mind I still think it deserves 5 stars overall) is that there was an overabundance of LOUD, heavy action scenes and an explosion of special effects too much of the time. A little over the top in that department for my taste. Not that a lot of them weren't good, it was just a little too much. I really enjoyed all the character scenes.

3473025,2,B001AVCFJM,"12 REASONS WHY THE NEW STAR TREK MOVIE IS JUST LIKE STARS WARS

Nothing new is in Hollywood. The old script writers for Star Wars rewrote their old script and changed the characters into our familiar Star Trek heroes.  They used some lines from the original tv series, hired new actors, and recycled the old Star Wars script, and expected Science Fiction fans not to notice the difference.

Cases in Point

1. Light Sabers- Sulu's got one.

2. Recycled Imperial Fleet uniforms, dye them red- Starfleet's got em.

3. Cantina brawls- Iowa's got em.

4. Blowing up a planet to torture someone who's watching- Got em.

5. Marooned on Ice planet Hoth- Kirk's got it.

6. Meeting an old Vulcan Master with pointed ears on an empty planet- Yoda? Nope-Kirk does it.

7. Huge planet destroying ship that can be destroyed by one little ship? Yep, done that.

8. Cute little Ewok alien with huge black eyes that can't speak Federation? Got one.

9. Police in land speeders? Got em.

10. Whiny droid?- name him McCoy3PO - Got one.

11. Jim, I am your father, (whoops, should have put  my transmission in neutral, not forward.)

12. At the end of movie, everyone gets a huge promotion and a medal? Yup, done that, too.

Got some of your own? Add Em here and forward it along!

I am a casual fan of this now heralded sci-fi series, but I was very impressed with this prequel.  I understand that it may not have been well-received by devoted fans, but I for one felt it was the jump start this franchise needed.  Since ""Enterprise"" fizzled on TV, Star Trek needed a kick in the pants.  And J. J. Abrams planted one.  If only Lucas could have taken a cue from this film, Star Wars Episodes 1, 2 and 3 would have been fair contenders.",1242518400,,558,4.431372549019608
3473027,3,B001AVCFJM,"(Some mild spoilers.)

I wanted to like this movie.  Based on the previews, I expected to hate it.  The real experience was somewhere in the middle.

What was great about this movie was the casting.  I liked the characters.  The actors put a very credible new spin on the crew we all know and love.

The movie looked fantastic and had good effects, but effects are not really what make Star Trek, or else we would not find the original series so compelling.

What was sadly weak about this movie was the plot.  It was about as contrived and convoluted as it could possibly be.  I kind of like the idea of an alternate time-line, but was Old Spock really necessary?  It just seemed hokey.  Was the Romulan story line really necessary?  I mean, if Nero found himself back in time, why seek vengeance instead of working to prevent the tragedy that would occur far in the future?  What the heck was he doing for twenty-something years while waiting for Old Spock?

And as far as Nero goes, has there ever been a more boring villain in a Star Trek movie?  Blech.  They gave that actor nothing to work with.

There were other small irritations, like Kirk being promoted, irrationally, to first officer - and then to captain at the end of the movie.  Cadet to captain is quite a career move.  Then, there is the scene where Scotty beams into a coolant system for some ""comic relief.""  Worst of all is an inexcusably lame scene near the beginning of the movie involving a joy ride off the edge of a quarry that should have been left on the cutting room floor.

I came away from the movie entertained but mildly disappointed, but with hope for the sequel.  Having set the new story line in place with a bag full of gimmicks, perhaps the writers will be able to focus on a truly new adventure for this crew the next time out.  All the right elements are in place, if only they can get the mix right next time.",1242518400,4,1899,4.375358166189112
3473028,5,B001AVCFJM,"I loved this movie!  I loved the way they kept the characters traits true to the original series characters' traits; loved seeing how they got together on the ship and loved the humor and all the references to previous ST series.

The fight scenes were breathtaking and the scene of the Enterprise coming up through the clouds around Saturn's moon was beautiful and almost awe-inspiring. And the mystery of how Kirk beat the famous Kobayashi Maru test is revealed

This is the best movie of all of them, in my opinion.",1242518400,,518,4.670329670329671
3473029,3,B001AVCFJM,"Well, I saw it last night and I must say it was far more enjoyable than I thought it would be, but is also seemed like a betrayal of the whole Star Trek universe up to this point, and of course I'd spoil it for anyone who didn't know already why I'd say that, and anyone who has seen the movie knows exactly why I'd say that, so I won't say it.

(I just wrote one of the longest run-on sentences in a review evah!  I'm keeping it.)

So, given that they're blowing up the old universe to reimagine the show, the one part I really didn't like was how Kirk was portrayed.  That is, I really believed I was seeing a young Spock, Scotty, and Uhura, but Kirk (and Chekov) didn't really work for me.  I believe Kirk could have been a ""bad boy"" in his youth, but I didn't see a future Kirk in that character in the movie.  Sometimes I thought I was watching a bunch of young Star Trek fans get together and roll play for fun.  (Oh, and the Chekov character was not part of the first season of the original Trek series anyway.)

Also, the soundtrack was not memorable to me at all, but at least it wasn't boring or overly pompous and it worked for the film.

The one big nitpick I've got is the term ""Klingon Warbird"".  This I believe was a mistake that should have been caught.  Romulans made ""warbirds"" and Klingons made the ""bird of prey"" type ships.  So many people seem to have a hard time keeping that straight, but you'd think this would have been caught by people making a Star Trek movie!

Anyway, this movie has action, adventure, fun, laughs, and some character development too.  I suppose if you're a Trek fan, the less seriously you take it the more you'll enjoy it, and if you're not already a Trek fan you may just enjoy it period.",1242518400,5,1737,4.224242424242425

Bringing back the classic characters was a very bold move, and those were the ones I remember, back in the Kirk and Spock days.  I was a Trek fan back in the '80s when I grew up, then I felt that after the '90s, and all these spinoffs and sequels got released, it was too tough to follow anymore, and I felt that Star Trek lost its flavor and made me feel that Star Trek was falling apart.  I'm just glad that Abrams brought the good days back, and VERY enjoyable to watch.  Seems like if he does that good on the big screen, he should consider bringing Star Trek back to the prime-time lineup as a TV Series.

3473032,5,B001AVCFJM,"I have been a Star Trek fan for years, ever since I saw the original series. I like most of the movies with the original cast except for the first one which to me was barely watchable. I like the Next Generation and Deep Space Nine but never became a fan of the animated series, Voyager, or Enterprise.
That's why I was glad to take the chance to see the newest Star Trek on Saturday afternoon.
The casting for this movie was excellent and I hope all the main character actors return for the sequel.
The special effects were great. The action sequences came off cool. It was the humorous interaction between the human characters that did more for this movie than all the special effects and action combined. Star Trek has always been about human or alien life forms co-existing with various degrees of success and conflict. The origianl series did a lot in teaching tolerance of all life forms and I think this was at the heart of this movie.
The tension between Kirk and Spock and the beginning friendship between Bones and Kirk and how well Simon Pegged nailed the part of Scotty all worked so well.

I didn't want to like this at first but I have some much love for the original series. I did approach this movie was an open mind and tried to put aside crazy fanbook prejudices.
This version of Star Trek is a lot of fun. In the same way that the first Star Wars was a lot of fun. There wasn't a lot of scientific detail in this movie and the focus was more on action vs logical problem solving. That worked for me. I always wanted to see a more action oriented Star Trek.
Overall, if you a long time Star Trek fan or just a new comer to the series, then do youself a favor and go see it. It needs to be seen on the big screen. This is not a wait-until-DVD Summer film. It has something for everyone. Its the first big Summer movie in '09. The other Summer movies I want to see are the new Terminator, Land of the Lost, Transformers, and especially G.I.

The theme sounded great at the end- so did some of the original sound effects interspersed throughout... they should have had more of that stuff... and maybe more focus on the writing.

This new vision of STAR TREK is simply outstanding.  It is everything I wanted it to be and more.  Director J. J. Abrams has done a remarkable job both sticking to the canons for us fans and making a film for the general audience.  This is STAR TREK at a whole new level.

The ship set is perfection.  This is the Enterprise that Gene Roddenberry would have created if he had had today's technology and effects.  I completely fell in love with this ship, and hope to join the crew any day now.  The special effects are seamless, fantastical, and true works of art.  The action and adventure (and what would STAR TREK be without action and adventure) are fast-paced, thrilling, and tight, and keep you on the edge of your seat.

The casting is inspired.  All of the actors bear a remarkable resemblance in appearance, mannerisms, and feel to their original counterparts.  Chris Pine is an excellent young, rebellious, flying-by-the-seat-of-his-pants James T. Kirk.  We see and easily understand how this brash young kid develops into the revered Captain Kirk.  Zachary Quinto is an amazing Spock.  He looks and sounds just like a young Leonard Nimory, yet makes this iconic character his own.  Simon Pegg as the irascible  Scotty, Karl Urban as the good Dr. McCoy, Zoe Saldana as the mysterious Uhura, and John Cho as Sulu all do a superior job bringing their beloved characters to life.  And a delightful surprise is Anton Yeltin as Pavel Chekov.  Chekov's character was originally an afterthought, but not any more.  The entire cast works wonderfully together as cohesive unit, which was always the draw of the original series.  And with this cast, we get to learn origins of this young crew and see how these raw cadets became a team of comrades.

That brings us to the plot of this STAR TREK film.  Yes, friends, the timeline has been changed...and it doesn't bother me in the least.  The best STAR TREK episodes of any of the series have involved time travel and alternate timelines, and this movie is no exception.  It gives the franchise a chance to take some risks and try some new things, and that is what STAR TREK has always been about.  As this new timeline continues, it will be interesting to see how different and how similar events will be.  I, for one, am looking forward to see how these changes will be handled.

This eleventh STAR TREK film has all the heart and soul of the original, a fresh, new, updated look, and a new direction.  The drama, comedy, adventure, and vision of the original are all still present and accounted for.  Let this STAR TREK ""go boldly where no"" Trek ""has gone before.""

Which explains why Kirk really isn't really Kirk but a generic punk kid with the name, how all the characters are 2D parodies of themselves, and so on.  I first thought I was watching Trek V but with better effects, except the plot's different.

Also, google it:  Abrams is on record saying ""I never got Star Trek"" and ""I never liked Star Trek"".  Given the number of 4th wall-breaking nudges and winks in the form of scene borrowing (e.g. telling a character he didn't invent ____ yet, the bug that gets put into a character's head that makes him tell the truth, and so on), it's clear JJ got himself a gaggle of ghostwriters.  If he never understood or liked Trek, I doubt he's going to sit through 6 movies and 79 TV episodes just to find token lines to what's surely tantamount to plagiarism?

Abrams could have made this a new franchise, but he pegged the name ""Star Trek"" onto it because Paramount didn't want to take any real risks.  This film, in ways, holds its own, but apart from leeching off of the franchise name and character names, and maybe Spock, this movie is NOT ""Star Trek"" or anything approaching it.

Granted, given they are not A-name celebrities, one can assume we got some talented actors.  And that is true.  Maybe that's another reason someone wanted to give this movie the name ""Star Trek"", because people only want their established celebrities...

I'm enough of a fan of the series that the lack of imagination in the story line would have been forgiven if they had simply gone somewhere with the characters.
None of the characters came to life for me. Basically if I hadn't known them from the TV series they would not have had personalities. The worst was the James Kirk, who is even less evolved than the TV show counter point; I didn't really think THAT was possible.
I was so excited about this movie and it was a complete waste of time. Worse, they did such a poor job of developing a story line I doubt the movie would make sense to someone who hadn't watched the original series.
This was simply a vehicle to make lots of money from a firmly established fan base for a substandard story with poor characterization at least in the past that meant the special effects would be leap ahead but not this time, the special effects were average.

I think since Star Trek Nemesis, the series does need to be 'revived'. But I don't necessarily think making a prequel with a hot young kirk, spock, mccoy will really revamp the series. I think another Star Trek movie perhaps based on another crew (besides TNG) would have served the future of Star Trek well (Voyager, DS9, New Frontier?) This new Star Trek movie is less serious, more silly, and less scientific. And that's not necessarily bad- it's what the series needs now- to be revived to accept general audience. But this NEW premise isn't really Star Trek. It's something in between the original concept of Star Trek and Star Wars. So what the creators of Trek should have done was make a new sci-fi spin off that is similiar to Star Trek, but a new creation on itself. Was this movie entertaining? Yes. Was it exhiliarting? Yes.

The problem you all have is that you all want the 1960's Star Trek, when it would not be relavent to this Century. I agree that there were a lot of changes that were pushed forward a little fast, but things like that do happen sometimes. JJ has told all of us from the get go, that he was making a Star Trek to fit today and for the general audience, not just trekkies. If he made a movie just like the Original Series, sure, there would be a lot of trekkies that would love it, but you have to look at what will keep Star Trek alive, not just us trekkies. I went to the movie skeptical of how it do since I already knew JJ was changing a lot of the past. I left movie feeling awesome. I in fact was brought to tears a couple times when Nimoy uttered some his famous lines from the older movies, such as ""I have been and ever shall be your friend."" He made the new Star Trek work. Sure there were holes that nit pickers could pull from, but some of those holes will be filled with the DVD release. You have to go to a movie and watch for the enjoyment of it, and not go to nit pick everything it wasn't. This is not our childhood Star Trek, this is Star Trek for today. Only this type of Star Trek will keep going, and bring in new fans to keep it alive. And as William Shatner said a long time ago, ""IT JUST A MOVIE, GET A LIFE!!!""

The failure of this film would have been disastrous and might have plunged the entire franchise into a deadly downward spiral. The Star Trek franchise was forced into survival mode and has risen to the challenge like a Phoenix out of the ashes.

The producers of the new Star Trek film had the extremely difficult task of taking Star Trek to the next level while simultaneously honouring the enormous legacy of Star Trek. They have succeeded in not making an incredible film but one that feels like the glowing culmination of a long proud tradition. They have truly turned the legacy of Star Trek into an international institution... the new Star Trek is so good it should be illegal. The films is not what you would expect, it is different but brilliant. Yes it is over the top, it is fast paced, it is action packed and it is a typical film of this decade yet it stands out as different because it is top notch and so satisfyingly done, script, story line, dialogue, special effects, history and action sequences are excellent and all perfectly balanced. This is an extraordinary achievement in an era of senseless, plot-less, special effects films. The film is relentlessly fast paced while amazing still retaining an intellectual core, which is at the heart of Star Trek. The film will satisfy both escapist audiences, out for a thrill ride, and intellectual audiences who are able look beyond the special effects and into the studies of human psychology and philosophy. This film is set to capture a whole new generation of Star Trek lovers, where as if they had attempted to make a more intellectual slower paced story it would have failed miserable, failing to capture the low attention span audience of today. Star Trek, in the film as well as in real life, has had to adapt rapidly to new circumstances, new audiences with different requirements, in order to survive. This film is no less than Star Trek on steroids needing to be bigger and better in order to compete with it's own history and the new standards set by other sci-fi series such as Battle Star Galactica.

The premise and themes explored in the new Star Trek remain true to the original vision of Gene Roddenberry and therefore stands proud in the tradition of its forefathers. As with the Star Trek franchise this film deals with the best possible future of humanity, represented by Star Fleet, the peaceful cooperation of all races and individuals working together within the Star Fleet framework which allows them to people to contribute their individual strengths and limit individual flaws. The film suggests that humanity will achieve this altruistic future and that this is what will ensure our long-term future survival.

There are so many themes that Star Trek delves into, if you look underneath the surface Star Trek is a deeply positive metaphor for human history, fighting the odds of our survival since the beginning of time. If you can adapt fast enough to change, to something new entering your world, then you will survive, if not, like a dinosaur, eventually you will die out. Star Trek studies which human qualities allow us, a comparatively physically small and weak species, to have such a strong survival ability.

One of these qualities is the role that human emotion plays in survival. The character development of Kirk and Spark are used to explore this. Spark represses his emotion allowing him superior logical abilities and Kirk is all unchecked emotion and instinct allowing him fast reaction and bravery. Emotion is revealed as a double edged sword, being both a potential weakness, repression of emotion leading to inability to respond fast enough when your survival is threatened, and a potential strength, unchecked emotion leading to failing to assess a situation correctly and fatal mistakes. Nero epitomizes the unchecked emotion in the hands of someone who possesses incredible technological power. Totally blinded by the pain of loosing his entire home world, Nero, having no enemy to blame, turns his rage to Star Fleet. He blames Star Fleet, for it's failure to save them in time, not clearly seeing that Star Fleet tried there best to evacuate his planet before a super nova of nearby sun caused its destruction. It is not logical to wage war against someone who tried to help you, and failed, but this is the exactly the point, negative emotions are blind, illogical and lead to destruction.

Not only is emotion explored on an individual basis but also in a group setting, leading us see what role co-operation plays in our survival and how that relates to emotion. At the core of humanity is our ability to co-cooperate and work together as a group giving us all a much greater chance of survival. In typical Star Trek style we see people of all colours and all nations working together for the benefit of all sentient beings. Spark and Kirk are two opposites whose only chance of survival is working together and finding a balance between allowing emotion (when quick response to a situation is required) and repressing emotion (when intelligence is needed to clearly asses the situation). Co-operation is possible for them because humanity has achieved unity of cause and co-operation under the framework of Star-fleet.

On the surface Star Trek is all special effects and action like you have never seen before. Action sequences are intelligent and make sense. The story line is intelligent and complex and only at one point in the film they do deviate from plausibility to do senseless special effects when they create an alien monster stupidly chasing Kirk on a planets surface. This ridiculous scene should be cut. The pace of the film is incredibly fast moving, so intense that it is almost unbearable. Creating a realistic and believable experience of space ship in space is incredibly difficult get right. The sizing and relative movement of spacecraft has been vastly improved giving you a sense of reality that has never before seen before. The space ships are so incredibly large that they feel real.

I do understand why some people say that there is a lack of character development and story because if you do not take the time to look deeper and are unfamiliar with the themes of Star Trek and the personalities of the crew you could easily fail to appreciate actually how brilliantly the characters are developed and themes are explored within the incredible short time available given the insane pace of the action in this film. My rating is five stars plus.",1242345600,2,6772,4.893728222996516
3473041,3,B001AVCFJM,"Okay I have re-read my review and decided that it needs a bit more so I have edited.

The good:

All of the actors did the original characters proud and it was a great effort by all of them. Especially from the following:

Spock, the actor was spot on playing him and he was good as a conflicted half human/half vulcan.
Bones: Again the actor had managed to capture the essence of DeForest Kelly and he crackled in the scenes he was in.
Scotty: Unfortunately not seen enough but well handled by Simon Pegg

The space battle sequences were excellent and very enjoyable as were the sequences on top of the drill. The humour was just pitched right and astute trek fans were able to recognise certain bits from the shows or prior films (aka, the insect from Khan)

The Bad:

The plot felt as though it had been cobbled together from Rik Berman's bum fluff, it was the worst mis mash of time travel deus ex machina I have ever seen and it was done purely to re-set the star trek universe so that future movies aren't hampered by lots of already written history.

The scenes were loosely strung together and several were not very well paced or written and there were a number of moments where I found myself fidgeting in my seat.

The all powerful 'drill O'doom' as the Romulan vessel shall now be called. WTF was that all about. Granted, I could understand the planet killing capabilities, that was fine as it was perfectly capable of doing what it did do, however the ship is a mining vessel, why should it be equipped to wipe the floor with the cream of Star Fleets finest. Granted it was from a hundred or so years in the future, but still it is only a mining ship.

The removal of Kirk from the Enterprise so he could 'conveniently' run in Older Spock on that ice planet.

Uhura and Spock... unfortunately it didn't work for me because there was no basis for it. There wasn't any scenes showing Spock and Uhura together prior to them joining the enterprise so where did all of that come from?

Why did we have to have that sequence with the car right at the start of the film, it served no purpose save to eat up minutes of my life.

Too many 'Damn it ... I'm a doctor not a ...(insert word here). Once or twice would have been fine but that many in the movie seemed over the top.

All in all it was a fun film, but not an excellent one. As a Star Trek film it was fair to middling and by using a cack handed time travel plot to demolish the established history it revealed a cynical attempt by the film makers to re-write the Star Trek universe without giving homage to what had gone before. You can criticise the original star trek for being cheesy because from our view, several decades in the future it is cheesy yet without the original, this film would not have been made, nor would any of the sci-fi of the past 40 years. It needs more respect than this crap plot and utter destruction visited on its backstory.",1242345600,,2917,4.330275229357798
3473042,1,B001AVCFJM,"I approached this film with modest expectations. It did not need to be great to satisfy me, and indeed I was pleasantly entertained by Wolverine, with which the new Star Trek has been compared.

But where Wolverine succeeds (satisfactorily, if not brilliantly) in filling in the back-story of its universe, Star Trek simply shirks the matter altogether. Rather than trouble themselves by displaying actual creativity, the writers immediately escape into an ""alternate timeline"", then flagrantly usurp aspects of several previous sci-fi movies (including Trek and Star Wars -- hey, they say it's the most sincere form of flattery), before finally pasting them together with something called ""Red Matter"" -- a mysterious substance which seemingly consists of the gray matter extracted from this film's inexplicably enthusiastic audience.

There are countless instances where the derivative script contradicts itself. Perhaps more than any film I've seen in the last 20 years. A handful that would have otherwise been noticed by toddlers are patched by some haphazardly added sections of dialog, uttered by a cast perpetually drunk on Red Bull (which curiously, unlike other products, did not enjoy a shameless promo inside the film). Several scenes and devices are so evocative of Star Wars that one wonders if George Lucas' lawyers are not already drawing up papers to prevent further confusion of the two franchises - and if not, they should be. The differences between the two are a primary reason they've been able to coexist for so long.

Meanwhile, little, if anything, of this film's plot is ever reasonably explained: not the magical ""Red Matter"" that behaves one way at one moment, and another entirely just 20 minutes later; not what the villain and his crew have done for the two and a half decades during which the writers do not need them; and certainly not the reasons why a group of untested rookies with particularly juvenile behavioral tendencies immediately lands seniority on what we're told is one of the most advanced vessels ever made. Gimme a frigging break!

Rather than address the film's issues, the producers simply distract viewers with frenetic pacing, applied to a disorienting cacophony of shaky cameras, gratuitous fight scenes, and explosions.  These shallow gimmicks failed to hypnotize me. This is a film to make ""Aladdin"" feel deep and ""Terminator"" dull.

It seems that thought, experience, hard work, and personal sacrifice mean nothing in a new Star Trek universe masterfully crafted for today's audience. Roddenberry's constant undertones regarding duty, morality, and a vision for a better future are jettisoned faster than the warp core of a doomed Enterprise. The result is simply an insult to our intelligence.

SUMMARY: Nothing more than Cloverfield in space -- with an identical monster and a lot more explosions. J.J. Abrams urinates on Gene Roddenberry's grave and thanks him for the opportunity, to roaring applause.",1242345600,28,2962,5.2760084925690025
3473043,4,B001AVCFJM,"Ever since the crew of the original NCC-1701 Enterprise signed off at the end of ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"", the film franchise had taken a nosedive.  Besides ""First Contact"", all the subsequent films only served to facilitate the demise of the franchise, with ""Nemesis"" seemingly the final shovel-full of dirt into the coffin.  With the ""Original Series"" cast gone, the franchise (at least in terms of box office and TV ratings, not fanboys like me who will watch it regardless of popularity!) slowly died away.

However, after young director J.J. Abrams began building a name for himself with such projects as ""Alias"", ""LOST"", and ""Cloverfield"", he decided to tackle the challenge of making Star Trek relevant again to today's audiences.  By and large Abrams accomplished that goal with flying colors, although not without a few hiccups along the way:

The Good:
-Since the ""Original Series"" characters are still (some 40+ years removed from their show) the heart of the Star Trek franchise (people don't flock to conventions to see Scott Bakula!), Abrams resurrects them in this film by showing them in their early years of space exploration.  This proves to be the biggest success of the film, as nods to TOS abound throughout the movie.  Since those are the characters we care the most about, we hang on the edge of our seats to see a young Captain Kirk get a little feisty, a young Spock raise that eyebrow, or a young Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy utter his trademark grumbly phrases.
-Along with the time-period (pre-TOS) choice, the casting is also spot-on.  On can easily imagine Chris Pine growing into the Kirk popularized by William Shatner, while Zachary Quinto also portrays a very believable Spock.  Perhaps the most fun character in the film to watch, though, is
Karl Urban as the cantankerous (even at a young age!) Bones.  The actors playing the characters of Uhura, Scotty, Chekhov, and Sulu also turn in performances that easily harken back to their TOS predecessors.  An appearance from old hand Leonard Nimoy (which turns out to be a lot more than just a cameo!) also fits right in to the flow of the film, not seeming forced or desperate.

The Bad:
-The main plot of the film, which involves time-travel.  While I won't spoil the entire plot in this review, suffice it to say that trying to figure out all the nuances of the plot is like trying to pin down Season Five of LOST...you can try all you want, but since time-travel is (at best) a theoretical concept, you will not succeed.  Too many times during the viewing of this film did I find myself wondering ""huh?"".
-Though promised a villain, in Nero, to be the equal of Captain Kirk, instead we get a character with much less development than Shinzon from ""Nemesis"".  The best of the Star Trek movies (besides part IV) have all featured villains (Khan, Klingons, Borg, etc.) that are just as interesting as the protagonists.  Though Eric Bana plays the role of Nero as best he can, there just isn't enough (any?!) character development to make him a viable and interesting villain.

All in all, although this Star Trek reboot did a few things wrong, it still did many more things right.  I compare it to ""Batman Begins"", where all the nods to previous Batman films were ""gotten out of the system"" and thus the franchise could move forward to create the remarkable ""Dark Knight"".  I can see the EXACT same thing happening to this Star Trek reboot.  Though some Trekkies may be a bit peeved at the ending, it still (one way or another) paves the road for (hopefully!) many more Star Trek adventures to come!",1242345600,5,3590,4.768982229402262
3473044,1,B001AVCFJM,"I am a trekkie or trekker or whatever, meaning I am a fan of the old series/movies, etc.  I am not one of those old trekkies who could not stand to see change or have all my memorized future history go down the toilet.  I liked the new actors, I liked the new ship, the new effects were awesome, I totally dug the Spock Uhuru thing.  The movie is funny, it is engaging, it is an awesome action movie, but it ain't Star Trek, not by a long shot!

The main thing that I loved about Star Trek is the concept that the future was bright.  Very bright.  No racism, no sexism.  The basics of life was provided:  no worrying about healthcare, food, etc.  Heck there wasn't even any money in the future!  Greed, jealousy, hatred was almost non-existent in the original Star Trek universe, not because it was banned, but because the root causes had been so effectively dealt with that no one wanted for anything, and no one was held back from realizing their dream.  To quote Picard, the only challenge in the Star Trek future was ""to improve oneself and improve one's society.""  That philosophy is what made Star Trek the real thing, and attracted the huge numbers of fans.  It certainly wasn't the acting!  (Apologies to Patrick Stuart).  Star Trek was about hope.  It was about how the future will be better than now.  It taught us to believe that humanity can and, more importantly, will do better.  After all if this is the military of the future, imagine what civilian life would be like!

There is no hint of the idealized future that Gene Roddenberry created in this movie.  It was almost as if the director was confused and thought the Star Trek universe was the one from Starship Troopers not Star Trek.  This future reality is grim.  Life isn't fair.  Its not even that good.  The future portrayed in Star Trek (2009) is without hope.  Instead of a captain who tries everything before resorting to violence, Star Trek (2009) gives in to a bloodlusty script and fun special effects.  The story is forced beyond recognition just to make everyone fit into their old roles.  Was that necessary?  After all it is an alternate universe.  How many cadets jump six pay grades before getting out of the academy?  And then all the items that are impossible to disbelieve -- a space ship that does not enter a planet's atmosphere let alone land on a planet being built on a planet?  A Chief Medical Officer just out of the academy?  (Just to name two of about 1,000).  I can accept a parallel universe where things are the same but different, but this different?  No hint of Roddenberry's idealism?  An alternate reality is still reality (even if it is also a fantasy reality).

Unfortunately, Star Trek did indeed die with Gene Roddenberry and our culture is the worse off for it.  I used to blame Rick Berman, but now I see that a visionary cannot be plucked out of a hat or hired by Paramount to direct a movie.  With this movie's success we can unfortunatley expect more banality out of Paramount, violence for its own sake, and the agonizing mutilation of one man's vision.",1242259200,32,3068,4.531021897810219
3473045,5,B001AVCFJM,"We went to see the new Star Trek movie last night and it was wonderful. All but the most Die Hard Trekker will relish what JJ Abrams and company have done to relaunch the Franchise. The film was fun and as Scotty said ""Exciting"".

I was surprised that unlike the premiere of Star Wars Episode III there were no long lines and no geeks dressed up in costume. I was expecting as many folks dressed in their pointy ears as there were dressed in Darth Vader breath masks at the Revenge of the Sith premiere but alas there was nary a Vulcan to be seen. Trek has always seemed to have attracted the more Cerebral Nerd.

I greatly enjoyed the film. I cried when Kirk was born and became misty eyed when we first see the Enterprise. Many things have changed from the original series and the original movies I-VI but overall they are changes for the better and there is (dare I say it?) a logical explanation for what has changed.

The basic premise of the Film much like that of Abrams' LOST is Destiny. Certain people have a Destiny to fulfill and no matter what happen they will fulfill it. Chris Pine's James T. Kirk is a man of Destiny. A renegade Romulan goes back in time and changes history. Kirk no longer grows up with his Starship Captain father and his brother Sam is never born. Jim becomes a juvenile delinquent Iowa farmboy and save for a chance meeting with Captain Pike after a bar fight (over a pretty Swahili speaking linguist) would have never joined Star Fleet Academy.

Pine's Kirk is far less self centered to me than Shatner's. He does not try to channel Shatner at all (he doesn't even lose his shirt!) unlike the other actors who do a fair homage to their predecessor. Pine's Kirk is a man of determination willing to do whatever is necessary to succeed. The first time he meets Spock is at an inquiry board at the Academy where he had hacked a computer program Spock wrote to overcome an unwinnable situation boldly declaring he did not believe in the unwinnable task.

Pine's Kirk though new and bold is still the same Captain that we've always loved. This Kirk does have a tendency to get his butt kicked more than the old one and spends a lot of time on his back. But he's still the ladies man, still the loyal friend, still the natural tactician and natural leader. It is great fun to see the beginning of the friendship between Kirk, Bones, and Spock.

The acting is first rate. Zachary Quinto is spot on as Spock even having some of Leonard Nimoy's mannerisms. The scene between the two of them is done very well. I believe that due to the change in continuity Quinto's Spock will be more 'Human'. He and Pine's Kirk have great chemistry together though at first they do not get along.

Karl Urban is excellent as Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy and the Kiwi actor even sounds a bit like Deforest Kelly. Zoe Saldana upgrades Uhuru from the hip Sixties chick created by Nichelle Nichols to a hipper 21st Century woman who is no nonsense and gets her man in the end (though who was a Big Surprise).

Sulu and Chekov both have some great scenes and Simon Pegg's Scotty steals every scene he is in (yes his engines kinna take maximum warp Captain). Bruce Greenwood is also very good in the Captain Pike role originated by Jeffrey Hunter though with the changes in the continuity brought on by the Romulans I doubt he ever dances with the Orion Slave Girl on Talos IV.

I look forward to seeing this one again and again. I know there will have to be a sequek including Klingons or perhaps a new version of Khan since he and Kirk have not met yet. I can't wait. (Leave V'ger and the Borg in the Barn JJ!)

I think the turn away from The Next Generation and back to the origins of the original crew of the Starship Enterprise will with the demise of Star Wars via the horrible prequels will make the Trek franchise the scifi vehicle of a New Generation of Fans.",1242259200,2,3868,4.4123422159887795
3473046,4,B001AVCFJM,"Minor Spoilers...nothing you haven't read...

I went into seeing ""Star Trek"" with probably the most open mind I have in a long time, particularly for a reboot. (""Casino Royale"" was the last one I gave a chance.)

From the opening moments with the attack on Kirk Sr.'s ship, with the transition back and forth between the battle and Kirk's wife and newborn baby, Kirk, Jr., escaping the ship--I knew my wife and I were in for a whole new Trek, no pun intended.

The casting for the main characters was spot-on and for the most part, they tried to give a unique portrayal of these iconic characters. For the most part it works and adds a fresh take but at times it does seem like they are playing caricatures of the original cast. (For example, Chekov is played with the same accent that Koenig made famous, and seems like he is overdoing Koenig.)

The special effects are a feast for CGI lovers, but for Trek purists who loved the models of the original Trek movies, it may seem a little to stylistic and chaotic. Also, the design of the Enterprise is more along the lines of a next-gen ship versus what the original Enterprise would have been like.

The musical score is something that grew on me, as it only has the original famous musical cues very briefly towards the end and with the closing credits.

The overall plot was good, but screewriters Orci and Kurtzman, while able to breath new life into a dead franchise, also relied on the franchise's most dreaded crutch--the time travel/alternate reality story. Did they make it fresh? Yes and no. Just as it is the key plot device it also has set up a new Trek franchise that can't really be viewed and then you pull out the original series and the classic movies and it be consistent with them. Sure we basically have two alternate timelines, what happened in the classic show/movies and now what has happened in the new movie. But it would have been nice to have a prequel franchise you could watch that would lead you right into the series and the movies and be consistent and not redo Trek canon and lore.

All in all, as a Trek fan I thought it exceeded my expectations and was the first solid movie of the ""summer blockbuster"" movie season. With the ""origin"" story told, they are free to explore so much more in character and plot with the next installment. Sure this one was not exactly Gene Roddenberry deep in political and social context and substituted those deep themes for one roller coaster after another action tour de force, but it still managed to reboot the franchise, but retain much about what people love about Star Trek, in regards to humor and relationships. Welcome back, Enterprise and crew, it's been awhile.

3473047,5,B001AVCFJM,"I rounded up to 5 stars, but I really give this a solid 8.5 out of 10.  Now it's not perfect, and I'll get to that, but first let me respond to those that hate on the movie becuase it doesn't follow original story lines.  I think this is EXACTLY what the Star Trek universe needed... A new beginning.  This is an alternate timeline (a reboot as you all are aware of now), the original timeline is tired and a bit stale now, it's time for something new.

The graphics are fantastic, this is a must see movie for big screens, the bigger the better.  The effects are top notch, the artistic design is breathtaking, the sense of scale jaw dropping.  I have no complaints here at all, an utterly georgeous film from beginning to end.

The sound is great, just what you could expect from a Trek movie.  Not a whole lot to say here, there is the right amount of emotion conveyed in the musical score and it doesn't take away from the movie at any point, only adds to it.

The choice of actors to portray the younter versions of characters we already know and love was good.  A few forced moments here and there but overall most of them did a good job, the only comlaint being an occasionally overly exagerated moment, and the choice for Chekov was unfortunately distracting, luckily it was a short section of the movie.

Spoilers in this paragraph:
Now there are some issues with the film that need to be overlooked to enjoy it.  I'll start with the story, It's a bit weak, but not much of Star Trek is truly deep story driven, the story is just the mechanism, so this I felt was easy enough to forgive.  On the other hand, the bad guy, while well acted, was not portrayed seriously enough, he was treated in the film as a small menace and yet he was killing millions of people... which brings me to my primary complaint.  Vulcan is destroyed!!  While in itself this is ok for a new direction, the way it was handled (or not handled) was awkward.  A whole planet (and a primary planet of the federation) has been wiped out, and the only person that is affected is Spock, but not because his home planet is wiped out, but because his mom was taken with it...  That's it, no ""OMG, they took out Vulcan!!"" in any way shape or form.  It was just treated as some planet, maybe even hardly inhabited as far as the viewer and actors were concerned, but we know that's not true.

That's it, overall I say a great movie that anybody can enjoy as long as you are able to overlook a few things, roll your eyes if you have to a time or two and keep watching.",1242259200,,2539,4.2740585774058575
3473048,1,B001AVCFJM,"I have to admit that Im not a fan of Lost or most other JJ Abrahams work. Nevertheless me and my brother being both long time star trek fans went into the cinema with open minds and a lot of excitement.

We were impressed with the special effects and battle scenes. They were especially intense and upto date.

However we left the cinema shaking our heads wondering what they did to our favourite characters and TV show. Here are the reasons in point form:

- Why does Scotty need a Jarjar binks style sidekick? Scotty is a great character on his own. I cringed at the end of the movie when they showed Scotty and his new buddy.

- Spock totally getting it on with Uhura? OMG thats just not right. Spock has always been his own man throughout all of star trek. He is supposed to be the level head for Captain Kirk. Also spock did not have to eject Kirk onto the ice planet..its totally out of character for spock to do something so emotional and dangerous. The spock character was completely wrong.

- Destroying vulcan? Did JJ Abrahams even watch the other earlier trek movies or tv shows? Vulcan is the next most important planet next to earth in the federation.

- Kirks character was completely careless and selfish throughout the whole movie. What makes Kirk great on the TV shows and movies is his humanity and love for his crew and ship. A passionate risk taker..but not a damned fool!

- Nero was a wasted character. Bana is great actor (see the Australian movie called Chopper) who could have brought the needed intensity for the bad guy. But all we get is a handful of dialog and him stabbing someone for no reason.

- Constant steadycam..i was dizzy from all the blasted steadycam that JJ used. He just couldn't keep the camera still for 1 second could he?

So what did we get..we got a shallow, meaningless movie with dumb dialog and nokia product placement. The recycled phrases from old trek movies and weak acting made me sick with disappointment. This could have been the best ever trek movie with its huge budget and decent actors but instead JJ murdered and raped it. Sexed up and hyped up he missed the point of what Star Trek is all about..Exploration! Actually it reminded me of another really bad movie.. Lost in Space.

This new version, intended to reboot the franchise that was so popular in TV reruns and subsequently in a series of big budget films, is a remarkably balanced take on the origins of the classic Enterprise crew.  It is designed to appeal to the non-initiated audience while referencing the existing canon of Star Trek lore.  Director J. J. Abrams (Fringe, Alias, Mission Impossible III) brings a fresh vision abetted by Trekkie fan/writers, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman.

James T. Kirk is born as his father rescues a starship crew during a Romulan attack led by the mysterious Nero (Eric Bana).  A young rebel who grows into a brash, thrill seeking adventurer, young Kirk (Chris Pine) is recruited into Star Fleet Academy by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood).  Meanwhile the half Vulcan / half human Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) has matured amid bullying kids and decides his destiny lies with The Federation as a cadet instead of his home planet Vulcan.  Kirk strikes up a friendship with an ornery young Doctor Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban is a hoot) whose distrust of space and things not medical will become legendary.  It is McCoy who devises a way for Kirk to become a crew member of the newly commissioned starship Enterprise.  In fact, most of what will become the core crew is assembled including communications officer Uhura (Zoe Saldana), helmsmen Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and later, engineer Scotty (Simon Pegg).  Seeking vengeance against the Federation, Nero has traveled through time to exact pain and destruction with a planet killing device that will draw the Enterprise to Vulcan and ultimately Earth.  With the Universe in the balance, Kirk and Spock must decide if they can work together (with the help of a certain mentor).

The parallel life paths of Kirk and Spock are marked contrasts of two men who will clash and reconcile their future relationship.  Kirk smacks of hawkish, shoot-from-the-hip reactionary while Spock is the logical, think-inside-the-box good soldier.  Nero reminds us a bit of Khan from Wrath of Khan.  The character of Uhura is a major upgrade.  She is a multi-talented officer who has romantic longings for a certain Vulcan.  Greenwood shines as the veteran Pike.  Leonard Nimoy makes a welcome, pivotal appearance as an elder Spock who figures prominently in the history that is to come.  The cast makes the most of iconic roles and excels at recreating the personas of what we remember; each crew member gets an opportunity to shine.  It is nice to see this group working and improvising together for the first time to solve a crisis.  Further, this story takes it for granted as does its audience that this crew is not only multicultural, but multi-species, a far cry from the novelty of the integrated crew of classic Trek.

The screenplay has some well written dialogue and clever Trek  references sprinkled throughout, and age old lines of the classic show are introduced for the first time.  When McCoy utters, ""I'm a doctor, not a physicist"", it's a riot.  Part of the fun is watching two heavyweights like Kirk and Spock faceoff and slowly bond and seeing how Kirk ascends to the captain's chair.  We finally get to learn what the `Kobayashi Maru' wargame really is and how Kirk manages to defeat the test.

Sure, the plot has some gaping holes if you think about continuity and the fate of a certain venerable, classic character.  Nero's motives are explained in time, but they don't make total sense.  This film also does not have the gravitas of deep themes as previous films which is perhaps its only true failing, but instead, we get a strong character study that more than compensates.

Technical effects are quite impressive although Abrams seems to favor close-ups and tight camera setups that put the viewer in the middle of action scenes.  Fortunately, there are no jarring Cloverfield handheld camera moves.  There is a good fight sequence on a weapons platform and a surprise on an ice planet.  You want phasers shooting back and forth in space battle?  You've got them here.  In fact the energy level keeps this voyage bouncing along.

The Enterprise is stunning-it has never looked quite this way ever, and it is cool how they depict the starship going into warp drive.  There are imaginative points of view when showing off the ship's exterior, and the interior is brimming with activity and sound, which is in stark contrast to the more antiseptic views from the earlier show.  The costumes (complete with female miniskirts) harken back to that period and yet seem fresh.  At credits' end, there is a nice dedication to the Roddenberrys, Gene and Majel Barrett (who voices the Federation computer one last time).

Fans of the old show may tear up at how faithful and creative Abrams and his screenwriters are with Trek lore and how they set everything up nicely going forward.  This is their alternate universe now, and we are game for the experience.  This crew, baptized under fire, is ready for new missions, and they cannot come soon enough.  Way to go, Mr. Abrams.  This Trek rocks!",1242172800,2,5392,4.914823008849558
3473053,1,B001AVCFJM,"What happened to Star Trek?  For the first 20 years, the franchise was excellent.  From 1966-1986, Star Trek expressed Roddenberry's ideals and belief in a better future.  He combined morals with adventure to create a truly unique series.

Fast forward a couple of decades and things have changed.  People want less dialogue and character development and more action.  The ADD generation has prompted Paramount to produce a movie that is nothing like the original television series.  The popularity of this movie is a testament to the fact that today's society is action oriented.  Star Trek is alive but at what cost?",1242172800,22,618,5.0495049504950495

3473055,1,B001AVCFJM,"An evil alien endangers the Star Trek universe by opening up a nightmarish alternate reality.  No, that's not a summation of the plot, that's J.J. Abrams takeover of the Trek ""franchise.""  This new turkey flies under the motto: ""It's not your father's 'Star Trek.'""  Well,  take heart, kid, you'll get it right some day.

The Abrams team bragged that their lack of experience with the ""franchise"" has given them a fresh perspective.  Nope, they simply don't have the experience to know what to keep, and what to discard.  The film is mainly an excuse to have twenty-somethings reprise these familiar roles while infusing them with the latest pop sensibilities.  Uhura, for example, threatens to Beyonce the film, as she forms the focus of everyone's romantic attentions.  The Romulans, not to be excluded, have their faces fashionably ""tatted"" all over.  They balked at getting pierced though.

Supposedly ""fresh"" dialogue involves each actor repeating a groan-inducing signature expression, from ""I'm giving 'er all she's got!"" to ""I'm a doctor, not a ------.""  Supposedly fresh characterizations include portraying young Kirk as a wild jerk - something that was old even when James Dean gave it a try (well before the original ""Trek"" aired).

I reject the temptation to call this opus ""Star Trek for Dummies."" After all, Shatner's directorial effort on Star Trek V wasn't Shakespeare, yet the sheer commercial callowness of this script is shocking. This qualitative plunge won't be evident to those who hate Star Trek to begin with, nor to those who grew up watching the cinematic lobotomies that constitute recent action fare, but it is there. The writers of ""Star Trek""'s screenplay went on to draft the second ""Transformers"" film - something evidently closer to their level of taste. One example: McCoy derives his name here from losing almost everything in his recent divorce, save his bones.  Did these twerps understand that the ""Bones"" nickname is derived from ""sawbones,"" or that there's no money in the Federation?

The musical score consists of a maddeningly repeated little ditty which is as emotionally rich as a cat food jingle.

Production design is a nightmare too.  James Cameron once turned an abandoned power station into an intriguing alien vista.  Here, a redressed power station (actually a Budweiser brewery in Van Nuys) looks like... a redressed power station.  The bridge scenes look like they were filmed inside a juke box.  Exteriors are almost equally bad. Ryan Church - a prominent concept designer on the Star Wars prequels - created a new Enterprise which is simultaneously unimaginative, poorly-balanced and ugly.

There were two good elements in this film: Bruce Greenwood as Christopher Pike, and a well-done fight atop a big drill.  Cumulatively, they're not worth the price of admission.

Plot Spoilers:  This film also has Kirk promoted from disgraced-cadet to captain in one fell swoop.  The Romulans are eradicated from the Trek universe, their warbird motif given to the Klingons, and Spock gets to be virtually the only Vulcan.",1242172800,24,3069,5.151515151515151
3473056,5,B001AVCFJM,"Okay. How do you re-imagine STAR TREK, one of the largest sci-fi franchises in the world, and do it without alienating the ""trekkies"" and, at the same time, not lose an audience of new watchers who may not be that familiar with it?

The first thing you do is hire J.J. Abrams, the genius behind the LOST series on TV. Abrams is making a serious name for himself in Hollywood, and it took some serious c@hones to take on a project that could literally blow up in his face. Re-imagining Star Trek with an all-new cast and a new storyline was seriously risky ...but the risk has paid off big time.

The thing Abrams seems to be aware of is that entertainment (be they TV or big screen) is ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. Let me say that again in case you missed it: entertainment is ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. You can have action, adventure, cool CGI, but it's how the characters respond to such things that pull the audience in, and Abrams has done that with extreme care here.

Undoubtedly, however, some trekkies are gonna be seriously pi$$ed about this. Much has been altered (by way of time travel ...but that's the only semi-spoiler I'll give) and the new Kirk (Chris Pine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smokin-Aces/dp/B000O77SF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smokin' Aces</a>), Spock (Zachary Quinto,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B0014BJ16S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>), Bones (Karl Urban,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000X9FLKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>) and the rest are only shadows of what they once were on TV. Even so, there are plenty of inside jokes for trekkies to enjoy (""I'm a doctor not a physicist!""), including finding out if Kirk always does get ""the green chick,"" Chekov's (Anton Yelchin) battle with his accent and the computer recognizing him, and Sulu's (John Cho) fighting abilities. The other thing that'll rankle true trekkies is Spock's emotional state. But let's remember that Spock is half-human, and always battled with his emotions, from the beginning of the series and even on in to The Next Generation where another Vulcan (Sarek) gives over his weakening emotional thoughts to Captain Picard so that he can finish negotiations.

The great thing about this newest version is that it relaunches Star Trek when it was headed downhill. The Next Generation is dead. ENTERPRISE is ...not good. DEEP SPACE 9 has been ousted for some time. And no new films with older cast members were in the works. So, although trekkies might ""hate"" what's been done to their beloved series, they won't bemoan the possibility that this newest version will bring in fresh blood to their ranks. But is that enough? No.

What Abrams and the rest did was incorporate just enough of what made the classic Star Trek part of our culture (honestly, who doesn't know where the term, ""Live long and prosper"" came from) while giving us an action-packed, summer popcorn movie that'll please just about anyone. And I say this with all sincerity. When I went to the theater, there were teenagers and octogenarians in the audience. In fact, a buddy I went with brought his mother and grandmother, and they both loved it! Quite an accomplishment.

This one's a sure winner. And I noticed that another film is in the works for 2011. Let's hope this new series truly does live long and prosper.",1242172800,,3479,5.3510054844606945

This is a brilliantly written, directed, and acted film.  Why?  Because it does justice to the original, it leaves room for more, and it brings us back to the very heart of ST and the original crew.

3473059,1,B001AVCFJM,"A well written story is one that can stand up to critical discussion. Star Trek, by JJ Abrams is so badly written that it can only stand up to critical discussion so long as viewers cover their ears and eyes and shout ""LA LA LA LA"".  JJ Abrams relied not on good storytelling, but on plagiarism, shortcuts and convenient effort-saving devices to slap together a 2nd rate summer action flick that doesn't deserve the name ""Star Trek"".

By way of example, the villain Nero was lifted wholesale from Nemesis, while his motives and actions were lifted wholesale from Wrath of Khan, while the time travel scenario to wipe out the Federation was lifted from First Contact.

The premise goes something like this: a bad guy comes back in time in a heavily armed, heavily armored, nearly invincible simple mining ship to wreak havoc on humans, Klingons, and Vulcans all of whom are completely defenseless in the face of such an advanced and utterly invincible mining ship.

The story is simply not believable. We are expected to believe that ""a simple mining ship"" would be armed to the teeth. It would in fact be well enough armed to defeat in battle scores of heavily armed and armored Klingon and Federation ships of the line while suffering no significant damage itself.

We are also expected to believe that having had his home world destroyed by a natural disaster, and having been accidentally sent back in time 154 years, instead of trying to save his world or at least warn them, he spends the next 25 year plotting revenge against a guy who tried, but failed to save his world.

We are also expected to believe that his ship's crew would go along with him and hide out in deep space in utter isolation for 25 years instead of mutinying and then going home and saving their civilization.

What about Kirk? How is it that a 3rd year college cadet is promoted to Captain of a Starship before he even graduates and while he is under disciplinary review? Who, aside from J.J. Abrams, could possibly imagine any real life naval force giving a college student, however brilliant and talented, command of their most advanced and potentially destructive ship of the line?

And isn't part of a ship's captain's job administering day to day operations? Young Kirk was amazed at the sight of a Starbase. I can induce from this that he has not spent much time in actual space. He would therefore have no experiential knowledge of Starship operations. Wouldn't that be kind of an important factor in choosing the permanent commander of a ship?

The list of unbelievable but incredibly convenient and nearly magical plot points goes on and on. And I won't list them here as they are listed elsewhere in great detail. For other examples see [...]

Abrams not only produced a film with a lousy story but he also completely ignored established Star Trek canon both major and minor. And not all of it can be explained away by simply saying ""alternate reality! Alternate reality!"" as some do.

Here's a short very incomplete list of examples of Abrams either ignoring or not knowing established Trek canon:
1.  Spock being a Vulcan male would only have sex every 7 years during the Pon Farr.
2.  Pike and Spock served together for 10 years aboard ship before Pike was horribly burned in a rescue operation.
3.  Uhura ordered a ""Cardassian Sunrise"" while first contact with the Cardassians was still decades away.
4.  Chekov didn't show up till the 2nd season of TOS which took place 10 years after this film.
5.  Kirk was promoted to Captain at the age of 34 after many years of exemplary service and after many trials and tribulations ([...])

It's not hard to follow along established Trek canon for anybody versed in Trek, as anyone producing or directing a Trek film ought to be.

Essentially this movie was Paramount's way of telling the Star Trek fan base to take a hike. The movie was made to appeal to people who have no love of Star Trek and who go in for mindless action flicks. The film was nothing more than a blatant money grab.

To add insult to injury Leanard Nimoy's part consisted of making lame speeches whose intent was clearly to justify the abandonment of the Star Trek timeline and to short cut any character development that would have required thoughtful writing and creative effort.

This movie demonstrates a lack of creative talent on the part of J.J. Abrams and his team. It is evident that he relies more on convenient magical plot points and plagiarism than on good storytelling. This movie would have been better called ""Lost Trek"". Better still it had been made by someone else.

This is a reinvention of the series and it is a masterpiece at doing that. Star Trek always evolved as it went on, if it didn't it would have died after 3 seasons. Peoples morales and sophistication change over 43 years and the new Star trek had to change too. My hat's off to Abrams for an excellent movie. I even took my wife to the movie and she liked it.

3473061,2,B001AVCFJM,"While I was really looking forward to seeing ""Star Trek"", I had a bad feeling that something wasn't right. And I was. As most people know by now, this really is a reboot. It doesn't look or feel like Star Trek should feel. It's way too violent. And where's the space exploration? Continuity was thrown out as were all the people responsible for making Trek popular again. Herman Zimmerman? Gone. Rick Berman? Gone. Michael Okuda? Gone. All of 'em. Gone. Oh, except Leonard Nimoy, whom I'm really glad was there for the final (?) time.
Ok. Let me get down to specifics. While I actually liked the film for what's it's worth. It just wasn't Trek. The filmmakers basically took a dump on all the past writers, directors and even actors of the last few TV series. This wasn't Roddenbery's or Berman's Trek. It was J.J. Abrams Trek. To H**L with everyone else, including the longtime fans. Ok, here we go:
1) The Enterprise is completely redesigned, inside & out. We've seen on episodes of Next Generation, DS 9 & Enterprise what old starships look like, and they don't look like this. The bridge is too D**N bright! It sucks.
2) Engineering looks about as low tech as some 2oth century factury. Seriously. What's the deal? It DOES NOT look futuristic.
3) Spock & Uhura have a relationship? Wha?
4) Kirk is a loose cannon who can't follow orders and then gets command of the Enterprise after it's only a week old?
5) The Enterprise is built in a field on Earth and not in a space dock?
6) Vulcan is destroyed?
7) Spock's Mother dies? Plus his father, Sarek, apparently has a British accent now, and he is proud of Spock?
8) In the original series, when the Romulans were first shown, they were a mystery. Even Spock knew very little about them. In this one, Pike asks Uhura if she speaks Romulan. She says she speaks 3 dialects.
9) McCoy was NOT the doctor originally. That honor goes to Mark Piper. Also, Sulu wasn't the helmsman and Chekov was nowhere around.
10) Speaking of Pike, on the original unaired pilot episode, the Enterprise, with Spock on board, had been in space quite a while. Pike said he was tired of deciding who lived and who died.
Is that enough for ya? Sorry to be so negative, but like I said, they through out 40 years of continuity, something that I thought was one of Star Trek's strengths. Everything was connected. But now it ain't. It's all new. That means that everything that will come after will most likely be drastically different, or will not exist at all.

I've seen some of the old episodes when I was a kid, caught a few of the newer series episodes, and have seen some of the movies with Shatner & Nemoy. I've liked them all, but always been a strong Star Wars fan. I heard about a new Star Trek movie coming out months ago, saw some posters, and wasn't that excited. It looked sharp, updated, but thats about it.

On a whim I went to see it this past weekend. And I really fell in love with the characters, I cared about the plot, and the effects were beyond amazing! I tried picturing the characters from the old show and compared them to the cast they chose for this one; it's not really fair but anyone watching the movie must have done that at some point.

I've never been one to bash Star Trek fans, as there seemed to be some underground feud between Star Wars & Star Trek...I just preferred Star Wars. But this movie was amazing, enjoyable, and I think kept true to the original concept way back when. After it ended I'd been hoping for more, and I'm sure they'll add more to this series.

For two decades most would have balked at the idea of anyone cast as TARZAN other than the beloved Johnny Weismuller.  In the 1950's all would have agreed that endearing George Reeves was the end-all and be-all SUPERMAN.  And in 1965 the magnetic Sean Connery was literally the most famous person on Earth, his place as the one and only JAMES BOND seemingly forever secured by an adoring public.

We all know the rest of the story.  In large part due to the brilliance of those ""original"" performers the public craved for more of their favorite heroes.  Despite the lack of eternal youth in those worshiped thespians, the ""powers that be"" delivered new adventures for us all to enjoy.  Names such as Roger Moore, Christopher Reeve and Jeremy Brett were soon spoken of with an admiration equaling that of our friends of old.  The iconic characters had proven themselves far bigger than even the most successful actors that had ever been associated with the roles.

For 40 years STAR TREK fans would accept no substitutes in the portrayals of the original Enterprise crewmembers other than the vibrantly talented William Shatner, the artistically gifted Leonard Nimoy, and the rest of our familiar screen companions.

Time always reveals the icons.  It's not always explainable, but the concept of STAR TREK, the good ship Enterprise and the heroes who inhabit her, have become immortal.

Then just ask the guy who lives at 221 B Baker Street.  Or the Lord of the Jungle.  Or a certain mild-mannered reporter.  Or the man known as Agent 007.

I was impressed with the visuals and amused by the story/plot which dealt the ever favorite Star Trek time travel alternate reality gimmick. Despite the plot being somewhat up unoriginal, Star Trek needed a fresh update. I've been a fan of Star Trek since high school in the 90's when it was considerably unpopular to be one. I've severval of the novels and have the dvd collections. I consider this film to be a revision of the basic story which was going to happen eventually anyway. Star Trek was never meant to be a dead (never changing) franchise or vehicle. Everything in scifi goes through a revision process (Flash Gordon, Doctor Who, Lord of the Rings etc.) And let's face it, there hasn't been a decent Star Trek film for quite a long time that can appeal to general audiences and thus have a lifespan. I can understand the gripes and complaints from die hard fans, but this is a good thing. People other than fans are talking about Star Trek again and there's a feeling of general excitement with the new possiblities for the franchise. Finally, this is a franchise, period and it has to make money to in order to survive, there's a business side to this too.

3473070,2,B001AVCFJM,"I honestly and truly went into this trying to force myself to love it.. just so everyone wouldn't be right that I didn't love it. Yea, that's confusing. Well, I didn't hate it, if that's a consolation. Surprisingly the big gun, Capt. Kirk was the only thing in the movie that felt fairly natural. Everyone else is so preoccupied with trying to be 'their character' it comes off as a fairly shallow parody. Surprisingly even Sylar's Spock was fairly average at best. Every 'one liner' (Damn it Jim I'm a doctor not a...) the series housed in it's 3 year run was thrown in the Trek-style blender making the movie seem more like a rehash than a reboot.

The script was the other problem. The time bending 'back to the future or is it the past' script for a reboot is needlessly complicated.. Don't worry about spoilers, I can't begin to even explain certain why's and how's of pieces of the movie.. gah and I don't really want to.

Suffice it to say I again am in the extreme minority versus the reviews and Rotten Tomatoes. The villian is probably the worst part of the movie besides the script but anyone put in charge of a-big-drill-to-cut-into-a-planet-from-a-spaceship is bound to be lacking.

There is nothing about this movie that a fan of the TV show needs to see and there is nothing a non fan of sci fi cannot get from current superior sci fi like Sunshine or even the Battlestar Galactica series. William Shatner can rest easy, his legacy is safe. If the Classic Star Trek at it's finest is a fine wine, this new movie is merely Gatorade.

3473073,5,B001AVCFJM,"I thought this movie to be an excellent new breath of fresh air into a franchise that has been hurting since Star Trek IV, The Voyage Home.  The characters are full of energy and the use of Back To The Future techniques to alter the past and create a new timeline has left it open for several sequels without impinging on current Star Trek lore.

A Romulan ship from the future arrives at the time when James T. Kirk is being born.  Immediately they set in motion a new time continium and it is only through a technique used in one of the early Trek episodes (I think the one with Decker) that Kirk is able to be saved.  We then fast forward and see contrasting bad boys Kirk and Spock getting in trouble on their respective planets.  Later we see how the two are both persuaded to enter Starfleet.

During this time Kirk meets up with Uhura (and he tries to get her to give up her first name) and later McCoy and we learn how the nickname Bones comes about.

While at the academy Kirk must defeat the Kobyashi Maru (not sure if I spelled it right) leading to his first meeting with Spock.  The Romulans then attack Vulcan causing the Starfleet cadets to go into action.

I generally liked this movie from start to finish and like the new actors that are playing Chekov, Scotty and Sulu.  I loved the updated Enterprise bridge and the updated transporter effects.  I look forward to the sequels!",1242000000,13,1395,4.389105058365759
3473074,4,B001AVCFJM,"*******Likely to contain spoilers*********

I grew up as a Next Generation watcher, but I'm fairly versed in back episodes of Star Trek, have seen all the movies and have a mother who's a HUGE fan.

As a movie, this installment of Star Trek was highly enjoyable.  Liked the plot, liked the acting, liked the action, liked it all.

But when it comes to the believability of the story in the context of the overall franchise, well this movie basically wiped out EVERYTHING that's taken place for these characters over the last 40 years.

After the movie my mother kept saying, ""Now they need to go back in time and change it all back.""

Uh, I doubt that will happen because this gives the Star Trek franchise a clean story board slate with a cast of fresh young actors to work with.

I'm sure purists are at best lukewarm to this.

However, I think about Superman or Batman or Terminator or even Star Wars...these franchises have been all over the time line with the stories they present about their heroes.  Batman even has TWO installments with the joker, I mean how do you choose between Nicholson and Ledger?  It could just be a generational difference.

In the end, I don't think the Star Trek franchise shot itself in the foot by making this move, I don't think it was lazy, and I don't think it will drive hardcore fans away.

It will however bring in a ton of new fans, open the door for NEW story lines for the young crew (come on, we've all wondered 'what if' it'd gone down another way) and energize the franchise for years to come.

If nothing else, it will keep the purists gossiping for a good long time.",1242000000,5,1616,4.45578231292517
3473075,4,B001AVCFJM,"Well folks, it's the same 'ol Star Trek.  This movie labors very hard to reinvent the tone of the old series only to lead it to exactly the same place we left it.  This film, like many of the previous Star Trek films, is not SCI-FI, but rather space opera like the Star Wars films.  The best episodes of the show and the best films were always about some sort of social dilemma or the discovery of the unknown out in the mysterious universe, it is what seperated Star Trek for many fans.  Sadly, I have to report that the new Star Trek isn't that, but rather action adventure in the same vein as The Wrath of Khan, The Search For Spock, The Undiscovered Country or First Contact.  Ah, but it's not quite up to par with those other space opera episodes of the film series either.  You see those episodes had one thing that also made them above average action adventure, they had interesting character conflict and character beats and development.  This film reintroduces and redevelops the characters at a younger age so we lose some of that for now, at least until the next installment.

These days I avoid any internet reports about any upcoming films to avoid any surprises that the trailer didn't already ruin.  I did hear Leonard Nimoy was going to play Spock's father in the film, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that to be untrue.  Nimoy plays the older Spock from the future, a future that takes place after the last installment of the old Trek movie series.  His time travel alters all the old characters at a younger age, giving the filmmakers an excuse to change the old origins and events while not diminishing the original time line that the fans are obsessed with.  It's one of the few clever conceits this new film has that made me smile.  Sure, fantasty Sci-Fi has overused time travel as a plot device, especiallly Star Trek sequels, but this was novel enough and clever enough to warrants its existance.  There's so much Trek lore the various films and t.v. series carry with them that it is easier just to erase it with time travel mking it a remake while not saying the originals never happened.

The time travel plot also manages to change the character of Kirk ever so slightly.  Now he's a talented you8th with a chip of his shoulder.  He mourns never knowing his father, he was killed when 'something' came through a time worm hole in the opening of the film.  He now is trying to live up to his father's laurels for very different reasons then he was in the original series.  The acting in this film is all fine.  Nothing spectacular but all serviceable in representing their character archetypes set up with other actors. from the old show.  The film boils down to Spock and Kirk with Mccoy on the sidelines ever so slghtly, this was the original series main character triangle with everyone else shading details in on the side.  Mccoy gets a bit slighted on this outting but Karl Urban does a spot on impression of Deforest Kelly.  He's quite good and funny, but I hope in future installments they give him something original to do.  The film labors so much on the set up one gets the feeling that the real new Trek film will be this film's sequel.

The effects are good but nothing special.  There's nothing in this film that you haven't seen in other space films.  It's done well but nothing awe inspiring.  The action scenes are of the Indiana Jones school.  If you have any doubt or argument about whether this Trek is a space opera or not, then I lead the court to exhibit C: the sword fight on the drill outside of earth.  Why in a future where intergalactic space travel is a reality would anyone A). carry a sword or dagger or B). fight with one to save the world?  They wouldn't.  Only in a film that is more concerned with adventure then logic or true Sci-Fi.  It gets the serialized action tropes right despite how silly the logic is or always has been.  Don't get me started on the parachutes.  It's exciting and fun none the less.

The problems I have with this film have to do with the weight of the actual plot.  Not enough time is spent with Eric Bana's Romulan villain.  We never really feel his pain so much that we get his justification of why he is doing what he is doing in this film.  I guess we could chalk it up with him being nuts, that's always a cheap way to fill in a character hole in the plot.  Also, if your're going to use time travel in your story, could these damn screenwriters please at least attempt at illustrating it as this earth shattering, unreal and truly amazing event or discovery?!?!!?!?  The characters just found out that time travel is a reality and no one seems that impressed, even for a second!  Spock's reaction I get, but Kirk?  Finally, the characters are in such broad stokes that they end up being slightly colored cyphers.  Kirk especially.  We get glimpses of him before the academy but nothing really insightlful.  I would've enjoyed seeing the young Kirk struggling and succeding while chasing skirts at the academy.  This is where no Star Trek has truly gone before, a true prequel starring the orignal characters.  The main plot of this film is so slight I don't see why more focus couldn't have been put there.
SIDENOTE: Note to screenwriters, PLEASE, EVERY TIME THERE'S A BAR AS A SETTING FOR A SCENE, NO MORE DAMN BAR FIGHTS!!! It's such a boring and oversused cliche of action films and i'm really sick of it.  It's like every time you see a bar you know it's coming, BLAH!

So, ultimately, the film is fun and exciting and a fast time in the theater, but the summer season is lacking this year, and we're only two in with this and Wolverine.  We're promised innovation on old ideas but being delivered the goods in lesser and lesser degrees.  This is better then Wolverine, but not by much.  Though, with this film I think the sequel could really improve upon the premise with all the set up strands established in this film.  If not, then I'm might be done with Star Trek for a while.

PS:  There are actually loser fanboys on this site complaining about how Kirk became a captain without graduating the academy, and then they go on to compare it to the real military!!!!  Really?  I guess you didn't like Rocky or The Karate Kid or many other human fantasty or otherworldly fantasy films?  This Trek makes Kirk a wonderkind student and then he commandeers a ship and successfully completes a mission that saves the world.  They pushed him through to a graduation day early for saving the world.  It's not real, it's fantasy, okay? Geez.  Take some of your God's, Shatner's, advice and GET A LIFE!",1242000000,4,6599,4.5033670033670035
3473076,4,B001AVCFJM,"Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the whole gang are back in action but this time they are young bucks ready and rearing to go.  For us true geeks there was some trepidation going into the film but once you're over that or not a Star Trek (ST) geek to begin with, then you should enjoy a fast paced and exciting ride.

The USS Kelvin encounters an unusual phenomenon in space (is there any other kind?) and immediately comes under attack.  A series of events places George Kirk in command of the ship as his wife is whisked away.  The conclusion of this battle is probably one of the most exciting and emotionally impactful scenes I've seen in ST in some time and hooked me in.

Jump forward and meet young Kirk and young Spock to get a taste of their childhood personalities.  Jump forward again and see their decisions to join Starfleet.  I don't want it to sound rushed but it is bam, bam, bam; meet Uhura, Bones, Sulu, Chekov, the only hold off being Scottie until later.  It serves to give us what we want, we want to see these new takes on these old characters, and it keeps the action moving at a brisk pace.  It's a relief when compared to the bogged down slow moving ST adventures we've seen at some times.  Ever try to get a non ST friend into Trek?  Well you wouldn't start with ST V or Generations; you'd pick this one or First Contact.

There are some great nods to the fans including the infamous Kobayashi Maru scenario in which Kirk becomes the first and only person to ""beat"" it.  Kirk is cocky and arrogant and a womanizer but also charming and heroic as he should be.  Urban as Bones is probably the most spot on, it really was almost like seeing the young McCoy in the flesh and frankly he steals every scene he is in.  All the other performances were maybe not as close but great tributes and takes on the characters that I enjoyed quite a bit.  Each one was given a moment to shine and they all at one point or another made me laugh.  I really can't wait to see this crew again.  And a special note that Leonard Nimoy turns in a great performance and is a pleasure to watch here as well.

There were some weaknesses in the plot, sure, and the villain, while threatening, was also maybe not one dimensional but two at the most.  The method and ""science"" behind his presence didn't really sell me and I personally think it would be exhausting to stay mad for decades straight, just sitting around, with singe minded intensity.  I'll give him this - the man was really mad!  But as a method to give us our ""new"" ST crew I'll take it.

Should you be worried about the cosmetic changes to the ship and bridge and all?  Not a bit.  Please just watch and enjoy.  Sure, I may have toned down the bridge design a bit but there was not way to not update it with today's effects.  The ships were great and all the special effects better than anything we've seen in ST in quite some time.

Overall if change does not scare you and you love ST and you want some more then it is here and ready to beam you aboard.  I'm ready for some more.",1242000000,5,3036,4.258741258741258
3473077,4,B001AVCFJM,"I have only this to say:

Much has already been written about the new movie, and if there is any grousing, it is usually about ""too much action, not enough social commentary.""  Old-school fans seem to feel that, in this regard, the filmmakers have really swung wide from Gene's vision of the future.

I would submit that the utopian themes are hiding in this film just as they are in all the other TV episodes and movies--things are just moving so fast it is kind of difficult to sit back and think about them.

For instance, what is the #1 area of conflict in the world, and has been, arguably, for at least the last 10 to 20 years?  The Middle East.  Radical elements of that region have declared war on Western Society--no matter your political leanings as to why or how we fix it, that's just a fact.  But who was LEADING the USS Kelvin into battle in the opening scenes of ""Star Trek""?  A Middle Eastern Man.  That gets lost in the hype over the sacrifice Kirk's father makes in the same scene.

Also, there are two examples of inter-species dating in the movie.  Kirk and Uhura's roomate, and SPOILER: Spock and Uhura herself.

Little things like this pepper the film.  So I don't think Star Trek has lost it's Utopian side.  But like the child of hippie parents, it (unlike them) doesn't wear its politics on its sleeve.",1242000000,8,1327,4.452282157676349
3473078,5,B001AVCFJM,"I spent two hours on a wonderfully sunny Saturday afternoon to see Star Trek and it was worth every minute/penny. Color me impressed. If you're familiar with the series then you'll probably see several characters you know, just in a younger form:

If you haven't seen the series though then fear not because that's definitely not a pre-requisite. Other than saying that this movie is a pre-quel to the popular old school iteration of the series, there's not much I can say that without spoiling the really fun plot. Having only seen a few episodes of the original series though, I walked out not only pretty impressed and satisfied but I actually wanted to look up old episodes (which are available legally online at Hulu and TV.com and others) because it got me really interested in the show's storyline. From talking to my friend who was a fan of the series, I'm not sure how well the plot fits in with the series that succeeds it, but I have a theory that I can't share without spoiling the movie. Anyway, there were several nods to the series to give fans that giddy nerdgasm that you can only get from being in the know on the series.

Every aspect of this movie was really enjoyable. They all came together to make a genuinely fun movie experience. I think almost every actor fit their role very well - especially newcomer Chris Pine as James T Kirk and Zachary Quinto (Sylar) as Spock. By the way, don't look at the IMDB cast list because it has a few spoilers. The plot had a few minor issues, but I didn't find any of them to be dealbreakers. The script was strong, but had a few minor issues (mainly a couple of scenes I didn't think needed to be in there) that I didn't think were very noticeable. Even though it was more than 2 hours long it really didn't feel that long and there was an ample amount of welcome comic relief sprinkled throughout the film. Oh, and the visuals were tasteful and well done. You have to expect a lot of CG in a movie like this, and that's probably the only real downside to the movie. If you're one of those purists who hates seeing CG, then you'll definitely take issue with this.

I highly recommend running to your nearest theater to see this one. I'm actually probably going to pre-order it on Blu-ray, in fact, so that I can watch it again. It's one of those movies where I can't recall all the scenes because there were so many great scenes and they were quite dense. I'd say it's a solid A movie and appropriate for the whole family. There was almost no nudity and no bad language, although the plot may be too complex for some kids.",1242000000,60,2582,4.408805031446541
3473079,5,B001AVCFJM,"Now firstly, I was not a Trekkie before seeing this last night at the cinema in Digital projection. However though, the trailer looked amazing, and I remember watching the show on TV on the Space Network every morning before going to school. I also remember dressing up as Data from The Next Generation on TV.

Anyways, last night I saw this in a packed cinema with every single seat taken. We had gotten tickets in advance, and got to the theater early. Good thing we did- the lineup was longer than the great wall of China! We were lucky to get good seats too. And boy, we LOVED this movie!

Anybody would like this movie, even people who don't like Star Trek. Hell, Even my sister who didn't like the show loved the movie. There were even a lot of non-Trekkies in our theatre, if I had to guess.

This movie is a reboot of the franchise, taking us back to the very beginning. We learn the origins of the characters Spock and James Tiberius Kirk, Kirk's bumbling misadventures at the Starfleet Academy, Spock and Kirk's rivalry, the Klingon, and much more.

The movie is flat out perfection in every sense of the word. The special effects are excellent, the visuals are breathtaking. Sometimes there are Camera flares (meaning light relecting off the camera), adding to the ""beautifully shot"" feel of the movie. The action is top notch- The handheld camera adds to the intensity of the scenes (don't worry, the camera doesn't shake all over the place, you can actually see what's going on). There's tons of humor too- Kirk is HILARIOUS, as well as there are tons of hilarious moments in this movie, including Kirk getting all the injections- now that was hilarious!

The best thing about the film is the casting- Chris Pine is awesome as Kirk, and is really funny here. I was surprised to find out he played Darwin Tremor in Smokin' Aces too- he was hilarious in that one as well. Karl Urban as McCoy, John Cho as Hikaru Sulu, and the sexy Zoe Saldanha as Uhura is awesome too. Anton Yelchin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty were hilarious too, Pegg was the PERFECT Scotty. Truly fit the quirkiness of the character.

But the real high point of the performances is Zachary Quinto as Spock. He plays Spock perfectly. The look, the tone of voice... he really IS Spock. He makes a lot of Spockish facial expressions throughout too, he's really Nimoy-esque. Speaking of Leonard Nimoy, he's in the movie too! It was a great surprise to see the original Spock.

So in short, do NOT miss this while it's in the cinema. Abrams has really nailed it here. Well, I'm now a fan of Star Trek thanks to this movie! People applauded at the cinema when the movie was over. I was one of those people, in fact I even yelled ""YEAH!"".",1241913600,16,2718,4.5234215885947044

I saw Star Trek this afternoon, and I was entertained. It's a solid flick, exciting, moving, and funny. But as I walked out of the theater, I sensed something was amiss. Something akin perhaps to the awkwardness a 44 year old man feels when he gets an IM from a woman half his age. Sure, the ""girl"" ends up just being some bot, but for a fraction of a second, the woman is real, and the contact is just wrong.

In addition, having watched all the classic Trek television episodes, movies, and countless spin-off series, I didn't fully appreciate the new movie basically wiping out ALL of those events by establishing its own time line. Imagine someone taking an eraser to over 40 years of a story's mythology. And Paramount Studios allowed the new Star Trek writers to do this all in the name of making the franchise ""hip"" again so that they could score big cash from a new generation.

The new Star Trek is action-packed, and truly has so many enjoyable things to offer any movie-go'er - Trekkie, sci-fi/fantasy fan, or otherwise. It's truly amazing how wide an audience they've pleased with this tremendous movie - the sales, end-to-end demographics of ticket-buyers, and critic reviews speak for themselves.

Acting: Great movies always mean great peformances by their actors, and these actors' candor and chemistry was tremendous from the start. They succeeded in so many challenging areas for a pre-quel, especially in an ambitious endeavor like a Trek prequel: actually creating likeable characters you care about or cheer for as well as giving long-time fans some nostalgia in their interaction and adventures together. The casting for this movie was tremendous, and the actors all deliver, astonishingly well.

Story: The story is far-reaching, as a pre-quel truly can and should be. A tremendous action-packed opening sequence that truly pulls you in, and from there you get to see several of the classic crew's key childhood events before making their way to Starfleet and manning ships as officers. You see it all, including of course, the many brushes and final showdown with the villain. The story unfolds richly, and yet the pace of the movie remains excellent, quickly moving to the next critical decision or conflict.

Atmosphere: They didn't skimp on this movie - from ship technology and furnishings, to combat special effects, to monsters, to hand-to-hand combat inside bars and miles in the sky, Star Trek's eye candy factor is high.

3473085,5,B001AVCFJM,"The original Star Trek was one of my all time favorite shows but I could never get into the later incarnations. I gave the Next Generation a season or so before losing interest but completely skipped the other series'. It was the movies that I loved the most and I watched all of them in the theater except Nemesis which only managed a rental. Good choice because it was terrible. In fact there hasn't been a decent Star Trek movie since First Contact thirteen years ago. Whew. In the meantime Star Wars has produced three horribly flawed movies that have raked in the cash for George Lucas. Recent reboots of the Bond and Batman franchises have been absolutely spectacular but can Star Trek rebuild itself from the wreckage of Nemesis?

My biggest fear was that the new Star Trek movie would be all sound and fury with no substance. I didn't like the preview featuring a preteen James T. Kirk driving a 1960's muscle car at a cliff before jumping from the vehicle. Was this Star Trek or the next Fast and Furious film? Let me cut to the chase and say that I loved this film and my wife who doesn't know a Klingon from Cling Wrap enjoyed it greatly. The casting was excellent but Zachary Quinto stood out for his amazing portrayal of a younger Spock. It was as if Quinto was born for this role. The movie features some outrageous space battles that rival anything Star Wars was producing but it doesn't reach the level of headache inducing as some recent films do. Nero's enormous Romulan spacecraft is something fans REALLY need to see on the big screen. One effect that I've never seen before is the constant use of light flares on the screen. The filmmakers really seem entirely too taken with lighting effects and I'm still not sure whether I like it or find it irritating.

The writers did what I felt for years needed to be done. Stop using the television actors and create an all new cast specifically for the movies. I never felt that the Next Generation actors had the gravitas to support a big screen feature which may explain why the last two movies felt like extended episodes. Going back to Kirk, Spock and McCoy is a great idea and the writers did something rather clever. Because of events in this movie the characters have now become detached from the television show timeline meaning the writers have full freedom to write as they please. You could theoretically have events directly contradict the TV show and still be consistent. Alright, you probably have to see the movie to understand what I'm saying but it was a very good idea.

I expected the noise and bright lights but I was surprised that the movie's script had some actual depth that I haven't seen since Picard's, `The line must be drawn here' speech from First Contact. Although I rip on Nemesis, Insurrection may have even been worse because it just sat there stirring nothing. In fact the new Star Trek's opening actually put a sizable lump in my throat. I am so glad to see Star Trek back and based on early box office returns it looks like the series will be around for awhile longer, in fact it might just  live long and... well... prosper.",1241913600,5,3126,4.556939501779359
3473086,5,B001AVCFJM,"I've seen them all.  I remember people complaining when Hollywood once thought of Richard Burton and Robert Redford commanding the Enterprise as Spock and Kirk.  Really!  ""The Wrath of Kahn,"" is still my favorite, though I thought the Picard movies were worthy efforts.  But this new movie is AWESOME!  That is an affirmative.

There are so many levels for this movie that appeals to both old and new fans.  For an oldie like me, I went with my younger son, and it was with relish that I recognized old members like Bones and Scottie, not to mention Sulu and Chekov when they were just starting out with Starfleet. The birth of James Kirk took my breath away, and the action is face paced, keeps you on your seat and nothing less of stupendous.  With all the visual effects that have become available in films today, you can get so caught up in them, they overpower the movie.  Not here.  There was just enough to keep you wanting more and not too much to become ah-hum boring.

The plot line held the story together well, which I won't divulge here, but many of you old timers already know some of the things that will happen because of previous story lines.  There is an interesting twist, again, I won't reveal, but it was as interesting seeing a young James Kirk in a vintage Corvette as it was to see a young Luke Skywalker in Star Wars I.

All the tricks were there, the cantankerous Bones, the Chekov enthusiasm of a 17-year old with more than a thick accent.  There is comedy too, and for you diehards who remember Kirk being the only one to defeat a simulated exercise, you find out who initially masterminded the no-win scenario Kobayashi Maru.

This is a movie I suggest fathers take their children, particularly if you are a Trekkie.  There are father-son moments between Spock and his dad, Kirk and the importance of his dad, and the camaraderie that develops between Captain Pike, the first captain of the Enterprise and Kirk.

I leave you with this.  When you come out of this movie, if you don't have a better understanding of talent, if you don't have a better understanding of friendship, if you don't have a better understanding of how this franchise has existed for over 40 years, then you are dead, and don't understand the difference between ""Good Luck,"" and ""Live love and prosper.""  The best feel good movie I've seen lately.  See it today!  The go again to make sure you understand why this franchise will never die.",1241913600,3,2441,4.578341013824885
3473087,5,B001AVCFJM,"Not a hardcore fan, I really enjoyed this movie, a great reboot...... fun for serious and casual fans alike.

Showing the origins of the classic Star Trek characters, this movie helps reintrouce us, as it's been a LONG time since following the adventures of.... say.... Sulu.  But you get to adventure with him now, and how.

My wife is not a sci-fi fan by and large, but really enjoyed it as well.

Karl Urban nails his Dr. McCoy impression, and thankfully, Chris Pine steers clear of Shatner, but gives the impetuous hothead performance without the melodrama.

This is a great movie, and the only thing that didn't work for me was the romance.  Don't want to spoil that, but chances are, when you see this, you'll know exactly what I mean.

Now enough reading..... go watch it!  Preferably on the big screen.",1241913600,5,810,4.654929577464789

It is fun, action packed, and has a story that should please just about anyone who is a fan of Star Trek in any capacity.

So I'm not sure how ""accessible"" it really is to the non-fan.  My wife enjoyed it quite a bit, even though she said that many of the lines seemed like inside jokes she didn't get, and she was right.  The entire sequence with Spock played like an extended bit of fan-service to my mind, but as a fan I liked it quite a bit, although I can see how it would seem like a tangential plot for non-fans.  The screenplay plays up the humor elements the universe, and is not afraid to embrace big sci-fi ideas.  Of all the material by Orci & Kurtzman, this is the most mature and well written.  The effects are by far the best Trek has ever seen, and Abrams biggest visual gift to the film is his energetic and beautiful cinema style.  It breaks away from the usually staid visuals of previous Trek efforts without becoming just another hyper-kinetic visual mess.  Even his almost laughable use of constant lens-flaring keeps the shots interesting and dynamic.  All the actors in the piece are fantastic, with just about every one of the diverse characters getting a chance to really shine.  Pine & Quinto are great as the leads, channeling the essential traits of the original performances without descending into imitation.  Karl Urban is the real highlight though, bringing passion, humor and humanity to Dr. McCoy that of all the performances best captures the appeal of the original character.  Eric Bana has a thankless role as a villain who gives hints of a tragic side, but never really emerges as a full character.  As I said the visual effects are beautiful and different, particularly the way that the Enterprise moves, conveying both speed and power, in much the same way that the light frigates in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Master-and-Commander-The-Far-Side-of-the-World/dp/B0001HLVS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World </a>&nbsp;seemed formidable but also capable of darting about with a nimbleness that might surprise you.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Giacchino-s-score/dp/B001Z920NA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Giacchino's score</a>&nbsp;is also a standout, utilizing familiar Star Trek themes only in a medley over the end credits.

3473089,3,B001AVCFJM,"I'm not a hardcore Trek fan, but I am familiar with the Star Trek world, have watched many episodes of its various incarnations on TV, have seen about 5 of its previous movies, and I did enjoy this new movie.
Many have criticized it as a Trek movie, saying it's too shallow, coming off more like a Star Wars flick than a Trek one. There is truth in that, so I understand why hardcore Trek fans aren't exactly enamored with this movie.
So far, this reboot of the movie franchise is one designed for the mainstream. And as such, it is fun to watch, but it's not a perfect movie.
In between the action-packed and humorous moments, it suffers from a somewhat weak script and a rushed pace (it could have used about 20 more minutes).
Aside from the script's none-too-deep arc, the main villain played by Eric Bana is an angry guy with a 25-year grudge, but he's simply not too scary. Any sci-fi movie worth its beans needs a scary villain or villains. Say what people will about the Star Wars prequels, the villains were all scary, whether visually frightening (Darth Maul), politically (the Emperor) or deceptively so (Count Dooku).
The movie also needed the deeper reaches of the TV show. Granted this is a restart, and it spends much of its time giving the backstories to the well-known characters. But, hopefully, future installments will delve into the messages of inclusion that Roddenberry pushed force on the show.
Otherwise, it's just a summer popcorn flick set in space with fancy ships, one-liners and big explosions. Even the Star Wars prequels were more than that, much more.",1241913600,3,1583,4.697841726618705
3473090,5,B001AVCFJM,"In order to get big rewards in life you have to take big risks.  If there is one thing that the Star Trek universe hasn't done in 20-25 years its take risks.  The franchise has suffered greatly for it, continuing to follow a formulaic approach that has made the franchise stale, predictable, and for quite a while... DEAD.  Not sick, not on life support, but D-E-A-D.

Those days are over.

The 11th feature presentation is quite simply the first GREAT Star Trek movie ever made.  While others in the series have been enjoyable, there was no definitive movie that stood out, nothing that could be pointed to as something unique, something special, something that takes RISKS.

What you get here is the biggest risk that has ever been taken in the Star Trek universe in its 40+ years of existence.

I will not ruin this risk but if you are a fan of the movies at all you will know it when you see it.  Being a long time fan of Star Trek (I am a Next Generation first and foremost) and having seen the trailer numerous times I figured out what was going to happen about 20 minutes before it did but that didn't stop the shock when I witnessed this awesome writing decision played out on the big screen.  The strongest of Star Trek lovers (especially TOS people) will no doubt have a lot of outrage at this risk but it was the right move to make.  The Star Trek franchise needed to be shaken up, it needed something fresh and it needed a movie to shock and awe the audience.

Man did it ever deliver.

This movie is an absolute JOY to experience.  Spock was always my favorite TOS personality as he probably was for most fans, but I never felt the connection to this cast that I did to Picard, Data, Worf and the Next Gen cast so I really didn't care what changes they made (and there is another major change that involves 2 characters that you never have experienced before in TOS history) if they were for the better.  In all cases these were for the better and executed with near-perfection by JJ Abrams (who might later be revered on the same level as Gene Rodenberry if this re-visioning [this is much more than a simple reboot] succeeds like I think it will).

Since I don't like getting too deep into spoilers with reviews instead of focusing on the story (try your best to stay ignorant as possible of the story so its fresher when you see the film) I will instead focus on the characters we know so well (and some we don't).

True To The Character We Know

Spock (played by Zachary Quinto) - Even though Kirk (ahhem William Shatner) was advertised as the lead of TOS, the real centerpiece was Spock.  The work here by Quinto is beyond exceptional and complements the amazing work done by Leonard Nimoy the past 40 years.  Quinto plays the character as well as you could imagine and the real special thing in this movie is that finally (FINALLY) the half human side of Spock is heavily examined.  It is a major part of the movie and no doubt will continue to be focused on in future films.  Spock is no more or less important to the crew and story as he always has been.  Other actors could do lesser work (they didn't) but the movie franchise will only succeed as well as Quinto acts.  The character is in the best of hands.

Bones (played by Karl Urban) - The gem of the entire movie without question.  Karl Urban takes the difficult role of playing not only Bones but Bones played by DeForest Kelley and is he ever amazing.  It's a complete joy to watch his character on the screen.  Urban doesn't need to do anything different in future films.  You can tell how hard he worked to keep the Bones character as he has always been and he hits a home run out of the park.  Wonderful wonderful wonderful

Scotty (played by Simon Pegg) - We don't meet Scotty until far into the movie but Pegg does a great job doing James Doohan.  Since Scotty was always kind of the ""middle"" character on the show where he wasn't wasted but wasn't the tops (Spock, Kirk, Bones) all Pegg had to do was do a good Scotty and hopefully the script-writers would give him more to do.  This is the case here.

Revisions And Improvements Made

Kirk (played by Chris Pine) - No longer do we get the ultra womanizing, overacting of Kirk/William Shatner but we get instead a focus on the risk-taking side of Kirk and this is the Kirk that I could truly learn to love.  Over and over again we see why Kirk in Star Trek canon is revered so much and his take no prisoners approach is put on the front burner all throughout this film.  Pine is confident and does a fantastic job.  I don't care how revered Shatner is, the writers got it right with this re-visioning of Kirk and it's thumbs up all the way.

Sulu (played by John Cho) - Not much to say here.  Cho was fine but nothing amazing in his performance.  Sulu fights a little bit but hopefully more focus can be made on him in the future, no problems here but nothing jumps out.

Uhura (played by Zoe Saldana) - As a communications officer her role is MUCH better in this re-visioning.  She is given more intelligent input by the script-writers but the one major canon change of Uhura (which I can't go into detail in this review) I am still trying to determine how I feel about.  Her mod is the 2nd biggest risk/mod taken in the movie.

Complete Rewrite

Chekov (played by Anton Yeltin) - Except for being Russian and making fun of his thick accent this is a completely new character and man was this a serious improvement.  Instead of the bumbling doofus that really doesn't do anything now Chekov is a ultra-young uber-intelligent officer that plays pivotal parts in the movie.  Yes this was a serious canon change but I can't imagine how any fan wouldn't approve because now you have a real character you can be emotionally attached to.

New Characters

Nero (played by Eric Bana) - Bana instantly becomes one of the main villains in Star Trek lore and in my opinion because of events in the movie he now becomes THE single villain in Star Trek history.  I wish Nero could have been on the screen more but with only 2 hours and so many people to get on the screen I think the right balance was struck.

Old Friends

XXX - You will know who this is when you see them.  I have no complaints other than one voice-over part where the narration seems a bit droll and uninspired but I also think this is because of the circumstance how they are speaking.  This old friend was a +++ to the movie and not just a ploy to get people in the seats.  A welcome addition to the movie and plot.

Intangibles

Bridge - The new bridge is the most gorgeous bridge you will ever see.  Some say it looks 'too sexy' or 'too bright' but THIS is how the bridge should have always looked.  Please please please don't change it for the future films.  You have already achieved the perfect look.

Score - The one downside of the movie.  The 3rd trailer featured some of the most gorgeous background score ever and my hopes were very high.  The score that is featured in the movie is serviceable but doesn't inspire.  I was disappointed with the end result.  It's alright but it could have been so much more.

IMO 'Star Trek' achieves what only 1 Star Trek movie (IV - The Voyage Home) came close to doing and that is being a successful film to the general public, not just Star Trek fans in general.  This is the quickest 2 hours you will spend this summer and an absolute joy.  I can see several movies being made with this cast and I hope several are made.  The events of this film make for a realistic approach to the original cast working anew in these new revisions.  As the movie ended I wished I could move ahead 2-3 years in time to see the next chapter and the next and the next.

Everyone likes to rank the movies in order and I knew 1 hour in this was EASILY (note I don't even flinch when I say EASILY EASILY EASILY) the greatest Star Trek movie ever made.  You know a movie succeeds when a character or a movie itself feels like candy for the brain (last year Heath Ledgers Joker was the ultimate 'candy') and this is some yummy candy.

If you are a Star Trek fan go see it and try to have an open mind for what you will see.  Many will be fine with the changes made.  For the ones that aren't would you rather have changes and new Star Trek movies or the same old same old that had ruined the franchise for so long (kudos to Rick Berman as the official murderer of ST)???  If you are just a person that loves movies you (yes YOU) can even enjoy Star Trek as this movie has been produced not just for the Trekkie but the every day Joe and Jane.

3473096,4,B001AVCFJM,"So much was riding on J.J. Abrams here.  This was not just about whether a Trek reboot would work; it was about the survival of Trek, period.  Some reboots worked, like Batman Begins, and some didn't (Planet of the Apes, anyone?)  I am pleased to say Star Trek falls into the former category.

Breaking from the canonical story line was a gutsy move, but one that was necessary. Trek is myth.  Anyone who has studied mythology knows that the stories can change in the telling.  Read King Arthur -- some versions have Lancelot, some don't.  In some versions Arthur lives in a picturesque Camelot, in others it's a more primitive stone and wooden fort.  The important thing is this: the core truths stay the same.

It's okay to break with canon, and what we are given here is a very swift, efficient way to not wipe the slate clean, but create space for the retelling.  The rogue Romulan Captain Nero (Eric Bana) comes crashing into the 23rd century from the future, and he destroys the USS Kelvin (killing Kirk's father in the process) with his massive mining ship.  Bam!  We're off into a new timeline.  Any Trekker will know the severe consequences of messing with the past, and the effects of this incident ripple into the lives of Kirk, Spock, and the gang.

It's at this point we meet the young Kirk, made perhaps even more reckless now that he is fatherless, and Spock, who as a young man was truly struggling with his Vulcan-Human nature in a way we never saw in TOS or the previous movies.  We are also (re) introduced to the razor-sharp Uhura, whose strength is on clear display here, and of course Scotty (love Simon Pegg), Sulu, and Chekov.

The story that brings them together is the urgent challenge to thwart Captain Nero as he executes his genocidal agenda to wipe out the Federation one planet at a time.  Why?  Because in his time the elder Spock and the Federation failed to save Romulus from a supernova.  Now the earlier Federation ships are powerless to stop him,

Some have pointed out a key plot flaw: that being stranded in a time decades before his birth, a more logical path for Nero would be to simply warn the Romulans of the impending doom.  However, Nero is deranged.  He is willing and able to destroy six billion lives.  He is consumed by an obsession that rivals that of Khan, who could have reigned supreme once he had the Genesis Device.  It wasn't about that, however, it was about getting Kirk.

Similar situation here:  Nero is twisted; his agenda is rotting his soul.  The movie could have fleshed this out more, but I think the attentive viewer will see this.  In his contorted mind Spock was at fault for the destruction of Romulus -- Spock was going to pay.

The movie is a joy to watch.  It is bittersweet seeing Nimoy as Spock for perhaps the last time.  Without spoiling anything, there is grievous destruction, tight urgency, and a nearly ""no-win"" scenario for the nascent crew to overcome.  Except for the shallow characterization of Nero, it's hard to find fault with this film.",1241913600,7,3025,4.59626168224299
3473097,5,B001AVCFJM,"The original Star Trek series took time to establish itself as the premiere franchise it is today. The movies steadily improved the characters and special effects, building on a large canon of established Trek lore.  The best movies gleefully embraced this rich history; the failures ignored or contradicted it. Star Trek is simply too big to reinvent, and J.J. Abrams knows it.  So he did the next best thing by tweaking the established universe of Star Trek just enough to carve out his own little patch for the movie.

This is the beginning of Star Trek re-imagined as a futuristic Earth that incorporates the go-go 60s with iPod style.  We see Kirk as a kid on the farm, Spock struggling with his half-Vulcan nature and Bones becoming a crotchety windbag--which, it becomes quickly apparent, he always was. We witness Kirk's solution to the Kobiyashi Maru, Spock's acceptance to Starfleet, and the construction of the Enterprise.  In short, this is a true and proper launch of a Star Trek movie, from the beginning, so that all those non-Trekkies won't feel like they missed out...

But if you are a non-Trekkie, you missed out.  There are so many nods to Trek lore that my head nearly exploded. SPOILER RED ALERT.

Sulu fences! There's a splash of light over the captain's eyes when he sits on the bridge, just like the original series. Red shirts die! The same sounds beep and bleep in the background, from the sensors to the transporters. There are several Wrath of Khan references, from Spock's famous last words to creepy worms that take control of your brain. There's even old-style Romulans and Klingons.  Fans worried that Abrams was going to remake the series in such a way as to make it unrecognizable can rest easy; this is the Star Trek we know and love, dusted off and buffed to a 21st century shine.

The plot involves time travel, a guest cameo, and references to the central conceit of the series: Spock follows the rules, Bones doesn't, and Kirk floats above it all, waffling between the two ideologies and blazing his own path as his ego suits him. The movie has no qualms about portraying Kirk as a womanizing jerk or using him as the butt of some hilarious slapstick. It also isn't afraid to push the envelope with the aliens, going beyond makeup to ensure they're just unnerving enough for you to notice them even if the rest of the crew doesn't. This is more than just a new Star Trek, it's Star Trek done right with a bigger budget.

There are some flaws.  The villain is one dimensional. Uhura's headstrong personality has to carry the burden of embodying all females in Trek, which begins to grate. Winona Ryder (age 38) seems to have wandered onto the set to play Spock's (Zachary Quinto, age 32) mother. And an uncharacteristically vengeful tactics from the good guys at the end of the movie borders on ""ludicrous speed.""

But you know what? I forgive all that.  This movie made Trek worth watching all over again and reminded us why it's okay to travel through time and space, encounter green alien hotties, and bed them.  Because it's FUN.",1241913600,10,3072,4.705223880597015

There were a few odd additions  (like the quirky relationship between Uhura and Spock, the fate of Spock's mother, and the ultimate demise of the Romulan villain) that didn't gel with what I remembered from the original, but hopefully if this remake kick-starts a new resurgence of sequels, these odd additions may evolve and/or be explained in later movies.

Overall, this is an awesome remake amidst a dismal gallery of very bad ones in a variety of genres.  They got it so right... thank goodness!  Enjoy and of course, Live Long and Prosper!",1241827200,5,777,4.753731343283582
3473102,4,B001AVCFJM,"I'm not a full-fledged Trekkie, but I am familiar with ""Star Trek"" and made sure I watched J.J. Abrams' take on the classic sci-fi story. It's a lot of fun with plenty of laugh-out-loud dialogue, dazzling special effects, and action to satisfy the fanboys and girls and those looking for escapism. There are some issues I had with the film, but those will be addressed at a later time.

This newest installment to the franchise is a prequel to the lives of James T. Kirk, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy and the rest of the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise and how they become the familiar bunch who travel through space having numerous adventures.

Jim Kirk, played by Chris Pine, didn't have an easy welcome into his world. His father died while he was being born and his mother never recovered from it, so he cruises along Iowa causing trouble while trying to win over every pretty girl. Aside from his playboy attitude, he has a mind made for complex problem solving, so he's recruited to join the Starfleet Academy to train for space missions. Also present are Spock (the always charismatic Zachary Quinto), whose half human/half Vulcan blood made him aspire to never feel emotion, or ""become truly Vulcan."" These guys don't mesh well in the beginning as they are the complete opposites: Kirk is the wily and passionately pesky heartthrob, Spock is the embodiment of composure and philosophically stoic. Also along for the ride are Sulu (John Cho), Chekhov (Anton Yelchin--dig the hokey Russian accent), Scottie (Simon Pegg, one of my favorites), and Ohura (Zoe Saldana).

The antagonism between Kirk and Spock is the central storyline in between the threat of a vengeful Romulan called Nero (portrayed with relish by Eric Bana), who's mission is to destroy worlds associated with the intergalactic Federation he feels are responsible for a personal tragedy. It's up to a young, inexperienced crew who had only troubleshot problems in a simulator to find the chemistry to defeat a being whose not afraid to destroy worlds.

Nero's conflict is built up nicely, but this is where one of my issues with the film comes in to focus. His motivation is overused in so many other films. The reasoning--and the explanation behind the conflict--rush through so quickly. It took me a while to put two and two together and I still don't think I completely understand it. And this is supposed to be the whole ""Why"" of the film. Also, call me a Purist, but they never showed half naked women or making out in the shows; I understand the catering to a younger crowd, but really. The relationship between Ohura and Spock was a definite wonder. Was it really necessary to make these characters romantically interested in one another? I didn't think so.

However, some of the material is surprisingly deep. Spock's struggle to find balance between his love for his human mother with his half-breed status, frowned upon by other Vulcans, is moving.

But sit back and enjoy the goings on of that infamous band of Trekkers on the Enterprise. It's so much fun because the characters make it fun. Going back for seconds shouldn't be too hard.",1241827200,2,3110,4.814606741573034
3473103,5,B001AVCFJM,"As I can say based on my personal moviegoing experience, this movie is a delight for Star Trek fans (me) and neophytes (my girlfriend) alike. It's beautifully paced, the relative unknowns do a great job inhabiting characters so familiar to our pop culture landscape, and it retains enough of its original charm while infusing the series with new life.

To those who complain that the alternate reality story ""destroys"" everything you love about Star Trek, try to remember that this is a work of fiction, none of it has ever actually happened, and J.J. Abrams is not going to break into your house and destroy your Wrath of Khan DVD. I think Leonard Nimoy's presence accentuated the fact that this movie represents a passing of the torch -- it's a way to give a young Enterprise crew a new set of adventures. Some fans, no matter what the series, will never be happy no matter what. Don't let the most fanatical segment of them keep you from this great movie.",1241827200,6,958,4.635294117647059
3473104,5,B001AVCFJM,"Spock and Kirk's Excellent Adventure!

The U.S.S. Kelvin gets its @ss handed to it by a Romulan ship of the future as that Romulan comes out of a black hole singularity.  Baby Kirk is born under phaser fire and photon torpedo mayhem.

And that's only the first 20 minutes of the film!

For all those who have been wishing for a Star Trek film that was closer to the original, your wish has certainly been granted!  Of course there are some inconsistencies with the original series (aka TOS), but that's to be expected when (spoiler:) there's a new timeline!

Kirk is more than brash and a little bit self-destructive.  In the TOS and the films it was established he grew up with this father and eventually rose to the captaincy of the Enterprise.  In this film, his father dies early on, so without this support, he gets mean.

Kirk gets into a fistfight at a bar, gets the snot knocked out of him and is persuaded by Captain Pike to become a recruit for the Academy.

Incredible storyline.  Abrams is a genius.  Not only did he keep the fun and excitement of the original series but he expanded on it.  What if Uhura met Kirk early?  What if Chekov became a navigator on the Enterprise now rather than wait until Season Two?

The Romulan changed enough history to change everyone's history.  The new crew is pressed into service by an emergency on Vulcan which becomes a turning point in not only the Vulcan mythos but in humanity's as well.

Bright points:

Delta Vega III, where we find Kirk stranded as a large red insect creature chases him.

Dr. McCoy saying he's a doctor not an engineer.  (yes, I'm a geek).

Sulu showing off his sword skills.

The original Alexander Courage music (but without the singing) and the strains of The Next Generation.

A tip of the hat to Captain Archer of the last Star Trek series on TV, ""Enterprise.""  Watch for it.

The pacing, the comedy and the mythos all combine to create a new tale.  If you're not ""into"" Star Trek, wonder why your Trekker friends cringe when you say ""Star TRACK"", and don't understand what a Vulcan is, you'll still have a great time.

If you are a lover of Star Trek though, you will catch all the nuances, all the sly gestures and overt comments from TOS.

This is the ""Dark Knight"" of 2009!  Highly recommended!

3473107,5,B001AVCFJM,"As this review of Star Trek posts I will have already seen the film twice...

Family members of mine--who are not fans of the franchise--raved about the movie...

I would call that a successful reboot wouldn't you...?

The film opens with the Federation starship USS Kelvin investigating a mysterious looking Black hole. From its maw appears the Narada, a heavy-armed Romulan vessel, and attacks. The Kelvin's captain, Richard Robau (Faran Tahir) is captured and killed by the Romulan captain Nero (Eric Bana). First officer George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth) takes command and sacrifices himself and the Kelvin in order to allow the rest of the crew to escape. During the escape, George's pregnant wife (Jennifer Morrison) gives birth to a son: James Tiberius Kirk.

Kirk (Chris Pine) as an adult is intelligent but reckless with no direction in his life. He meets Lt. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) at a bar in Iowa and is challenged into enlisting in Starfleet.

During his education on Earth, he is suspended for cheating on the Kobayashi Maru test designed by the half-Vulcan, half-human Spock (Zachary Quinto) and not given a starship assignment....

Kirk is smuggled on board the USS Enterprise through by his friend, Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban), for its maiden voyage as it investigates a distress signal originating from the planet Vulcan: Captain Pike commands, with Spock as his first officer.. En-route, Kirk realizes that the situation is similar to the one 25 years ago when his father died; he convinces Captain Pike that the Enterprise is heading into a trap. When the Enterprise arrives, they find the rest of the rescue fleet destroyed and Nero's ship, using a drilling machine to tunnel to the planet's core. After promoting Spock to acting captain and Kirk to first officer, Pike surrenders to Nero, giving Kirk and Lt. Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) a chance to destroy the drill.

Nero soon decides to set a course for Earth with the intention of destroying it. Kirk wants to follow Nero immediately, but Spock insists that the Enterprise regroups with the fleet. Spock has Kirk placed on a life pod and sent to the nearby ice planet Delta Vega, where he meets the also stranded Spock Prime (Leonard Nimoy)...

Director .J. Abrams, and writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman make sure this voyage pops with enough action, eye-popping FX, emotional resonance, and reverence to the franchise to make Trekkers beam with glee--As I indicated at the top--Non fans can and will enjoy the film as well.

To those fans who grumbled about changes to established Trek lore fret no more--the film does a fine job explaining it all--including Spock showing lots of emotion without giving everyone else a headache--Debate about alternate time lines and choices made by the filmmakers was gonna happen no matter what--""Star Trek"" TOS V.2. O is here to stay (at least for 2 more films)

The film is, at its center, an exploration of the Kirk/Spock dynamic--""I have been and always shall be your friend"" and the like..which is even given more weight with the presence of Nimoy.

Casting and chemistry (behind the scenes squabbles not withstanding) has always been strong on Trek and here is no exception...

For me, Pine is the true revelation of the flick as Kirk--and a star is born--Kirk as played by Shatner had plenty of bravado...Check....Made time with ladies...Check..and radiated confidence and authority...Check. Pine had all of that even giving a nod to The Shat at times without doing just an impression. it was more of a subtlety kind of thing...(The Maru Test scene)

The scene in Sick Bay is priceless...

Urban as McCoy is also just great...Somewhere DeForest Kelley is smiling--Quinto as the younger Spock is dandy too...As Uhura Saldana is given much more to do here then in most other episodes or films and thus the character is fully formed...Bana is fine as the villian but screen time is lacking therefore Nero is no Khan--Most of his important stuff happens before the film...As for Nimoy, he is Spock and clearly enjoyed himself...Good to see you old friend...

The supporting characters Cho as Sulu Simon Pegg as Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott., Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov Greenwod as Pike were all given chances to shine here....The beloved characters are in good hands...

Quibbles are very minor (What I said about Nero) Trek is back big time--The film does what every franchise pic should do leave audiences wanting more...A must see! Indeed...

Ok, I know I'm gonna get flamed for this, I don't care.  I watched this movie two nights ago and can not get over how terrible it is.

1.  The REAL Star Trek stories (TOS and TNG) show the enterprise as a exploration vessel that has some decent offensive armaments.  This ""new"" old enterprise has some super weapons system that allows it to shoot like 60 phaser bursts a second, allowing it to destroy missile barrages that are launched by the Romulans.

2.  The vessel that comes back from the future is a Romulan mining ship that somehow has the weapons capability to destroy an armada of 40+ Klingon ships.

3.  The Romulans have about as much in common with TNG Romulans as TOS Klingons have to do with Warf.  They looked like humans with weird tattoos.

4.  Spock - What can I say, My favorite part of Spock is the complete absence of emotion.  So they make this Spock someone who controls his temper for so long then snaps and beats the hell out of Kirk. (Yes I understand his whole planet got destroyed and everything)

5.  The Plot.  The Romulans come back to destroy Vulcan and make Spock watch using the same substance that Spock had developed to save Romulus.  Why not just wait and use the substance and save your home planet in 120 years instead of trying to get revenge on the man who tried his best to save your home planet?

There were other tings I hated about his movie as well, but I'm sure this will get me enough evil responses from all the fanboys of the new Star Trek movie.",1241827200,25,1560,4.455830388692579
3473109,4,B001AVCFJM,"I am not a hardcore Trekkie. I used to be, back in the day. I've seen every episode of the original series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager and tolerated most every episode of Enterprise before I lost interest. I own a few of the DVDs, including all the good movies, and I do watch them from time-to-time. But I'm not obessed, like I used to be. I no longer own any of the novels, for example, and can't remember the last time I attended a Trek-specific convention.

But I do still enjoy the show. Like I said, I have some of the episodes on DVD as well as the good movies, and I have a few episodes downloaded onto my 360. I mention all of this so that you know where I am coming from in my review of this, the 11th film in the series. Sort of.

For all the continuity whores out there, let's get this out of the way now: this is not the same universe as the regular Trek reality. It's made very clear about halfway into the film that since the opening credits we've been in an alternate reality. If you, like me, start wondering why the Farragut is launching without Kirk on board, don't worry; it just happened differently in this reality. Same with certain larger events that clearly never happened in the continuity that we're used to. If you're a hardcore fan of the series, keep this in mind and you'll be ok.

For the rest of you, yeah, you'll have a good time, I think. There's plenty of action and a feeling quite different from any of the other movies or TV shows in the series. The acting by everyone is top-notch, particlarly Zachary (Spock) Quinto and Karl (McCoy) Urban. The plot is at times a little iffy (centering around this movies Khan wanna-be as he sets out for revenge against Spock), but that's ok. It accomplishes what it set out to do, and that's good enough.

This is a far from perfect movie. It features way too much action and not nearly enough of the emotional and scientific core that made Trek such a great program. The villain isn't much of much, and most of the lower-tier characters don't really have a lot to do. There's also a very unnecessary romance between a couple of the characters that I did not care for.

But that said, there's a lot in this movie to enjoy. Rather like Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica, they've kept a lot of what works and, if nothing else it does do a great job of getting all the pieces on the board for the next film in the series, meaning that the franchise shall, once again, live long and... oh, I just can't bring myself to type that.

3473111,4,B001AVCFJM,"First off, let me say I thought this film was good, full of action & excitement, but having watched all the shows (except Voyager) & all 10 past films, I really was disappointed that the writers & filmakers chose an alternate timeline, Vulcan's destruction & the death of Spock's mother makes some ""TOS"" episodes & the films ""Star Trek I, III, & IV"" no longer exist, this is quite a disappointment, & the fact that the show ""Enterprise"" has been constantly critisized for certain inconsistencies & no one is making that same argument here based on current reviews leads me to think that those critical of ""Enterprise"" never really watched it or they just didn't like Scott Bakula's Captain Archer, anyway despite this, the film is well done, Karl Urban really captures Dr. McCoy's mannerisms, no suprise there, he did the same thing playing a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones' Woodrow Call for ""Commanche Moon""(""Lonesome Dove's"" prequel), the guys playing the younger Spock & Sulu were really good picks & very true to the characters, Sulu weilded a sword in the TOS episode ""Naked Now"" & the woman playing Uhura was also a good pick, Bruce Greenwood was very commanding a Pike, much like the original character, however I am still unsure about Chris Pine as Kirk, sure he captured some of Shatner's mannerisms, but I am not sure he really looks the part, I had a hard time believing he could evolve into William Shatner, the guy playing his dad at the beginning looked more like a young Shatner than Pine did, & would have been a better choice I think, Simon Pegg was half & half on Scotty, he had the mannerism, but was bit goofy, unlike the original Scotty, Ben Cross was good as Spock's father Sarek, as was Winona Ryder as his mother Amanda, they really reminded me of the older counterparts in the 80's films, & finally Eric Bana is again underused here just as he was in ""Troy"" who's Romulan echoes that of the Picard's clone in ""Nemesis"", in fact it seems they couldn't come up with nothing but a retread of ""Nemesis'"" villian here, this is what happens when you put a non-fan in the director's chair like J.J. Abrams, who is a good director, but him being a non-fan really shows here, again you would think that Paramount would have learned from all the complaints fans had about Rick Berman & Brannon Braga on ""Enterprise"",but then again do stuido cheifs really care about this franchise? NO!!! just how much it will make & what name they can attach to it, this new film is an attempt to capture new fans & give older fans the finger in the name of the almighty dollar, however when you watch ST:NG's ""Yesterday's Enterprise"", there are parallels somewhat in regard to an alternate timeline, & ""Deep Space Nine"" was guilty of doing episodes like this too, as did ""Enterprise"" with the ""Mirror Darkly"" episodes, which is how I see this film, an alternate timeline pure & simple, can't hate this one since the shows did it too.",1241827200,3,2937,4.628352490421456
3473112,3,B001AVCFJM,"It was disappointing that the plot of this film completely rules out major events in the rest of Star Trek.  I expected there to be nits, little inconsistencies.  This movie, however, says at the outset that this is a completely different timeline.  It goes so differently, that I couldn't imagine the Star Trek I know evolving from it.

The movie itself was good.  The story was not to simple or complex.  There was plenty of action, and it was well done.  I enjoyed the little references to the original series (TOS), although it doesn't make complete sense given how different this timeline is.

**Here come the spoilers**
The argument that the timeline differences aren't that significant is, IMHO, absurd.  Spock's mother dies in this movie.  She played a role in some major events in Spock's life.  Those events will unfold differently in this new timeline.  Consider the destruction of Vulcan and the resulting Vulcan diaspora shown in this movie.  The role of the Vulcans in the TV series was that of an advanced and intelligent race that supposedly suppressed emotion but often displayed a hint of arrogance or superiority.  Vulcan, we are told in TOS, could not conceive of a conqueror.  The new timeline throws out all of this.  The genocide against the Vulcan would likely dominate their culture in the new timeline.  It spoils any fun of watching the movie with the feeling you're seeing the original characters as there were when they were young.

I can accept continuity errors and even a whole new timeline if it were for a reason.  It seems to me, though, they created this new timeline as a writing crutch.  They should have created whole new characters or stayed basically faithful to TOS.  Fanboys would always find some continuity errors, but if viewers could suspend disbelief they could accept that the movie was about the characters they know.  The alternate timeline deviates too much for the movie to be enjoyable on that level.

Apart from this huge flaw, Star Trek is a good movie.  I wish they had made it a non-Star Trek film, enjoyable without the references to TOS, or a Star Trek film in the same timeline as TOS.",1241827200,12,2146,4.769021739130435
3473113,3,B001AVCFJM,"I love Star Trek.  I watched the original series since I was very very young.  This movie is great but ... it is flat.  I don't know, I've seen the movie yesterday, it was great but there nothing in the story line, I saw just only special effect and CG.

I do believe that the casts are great.  I love Karl Urban, he is really funny.  Zachary Quinto, also great in translated his role as Spock (actually I like him in Heroes better, there are complexity in his performance as Sylar).  I also loved Eric Bana as Nero, he is great for this role.  Unfortunately, the Director did not see that the story should be told by the performance of the casts (eventhough he has casted the most perfect actors and actresses for each role, pity).

Surprisingly, I impressed by Chris Hemsworth, the actor who played as George Kirk, J.T.Kirk's father. His acting was excellent.  I had tear in my eyes when he shown his affectionated to his wife and his son at the very last second of his life. ""I love you"" was so powerful, I thik the Director should work from that moment and progress to the point that inspired J.T.Kirk to be a better man as his father not like some reckless runaway child who seek some attention from his mother.",1241827200,5,1216,4.388392857142857

I thought the introducion of the ""old characters"" was really well done and how they captured the essense of these characters, that everyone knows.  It was not a secret that this ST movie was about the first Star Trek crew and for fans of ST going to see this, if they did not emmulate the ""original"" characters then everyone would be complaining, again, saying how they were nothing like the original cast.  Damned if you do and damned if you don't.
The Romulan mining ship reminded me of the time ship from the episode Year of Hell pt 1&2 in Star Trek Voyager, only far more imposing which made the start of the movie absolutely amazing and totally unexpected for a ST movie (Thank God!).  ST Generations & the other ST NG movie's, (can't even remember the name of them now) only ever had about 5 mins of action at the end & the rest of the time was spent wandering when it was actually going to start or end.  Those ST-NG movies overdid the moralising and were far too intent on verbally explaining everything, when this is not always necessary.  If you go to watch a sci-fi action movie, you expect action, in space, not talking.
This new ST movie was so refreshing, an entire ST movie where it was fast paced, action packed, quickly introduced the characters, had funny moments and it was great to remember and see old characters.  The story plot was fine, you understood easily what was going on, without all the excessive talk.
This ST movie will be a great success - unlike the others, which deserved to flop at the box office.  I was a huge fan of Vogager because of the action, not because of the talk.  This is where I felt ST-NG fell over, too much talking, not enough action and too many space dwelling organism's that are supposedly intelligent beings... that they must communicate with - silly.  At least in this movie they are fighting against an actual opponent whose technology is far superior.
Roll on the new series of ST with the new characters and tons of action.  Even if you are not a ST fan or loved the original ST, this movie will re-ignite your interest in the show",1241827200,2,2198,4.47
3473116,5,B001AVCFJM,"I won't go into the details of the movie plot, since presumably anyone on planet Earth already knows by now that this is essentially a movie depicting the events predating the original 1966-1969 TV series.

I gave this movie a 5-star rating not only because it is great entertainment standing on its own, but also because it is true enough to the original TV series (and the plurality of spin-off TV series and movies) to hold the attention of the Star Trek faithful.

Full disclosure of the reviewer and his potential biases:  I am 51 years old, but was never a big fan of the original TV series (either at the time or subsequently).  I did, however, take up a keen interest in the franchise starting with the movies, and ""The Next Generation"" TV series.  So at that time (circa 1989) I found I had to go back and see the original TV series so I could understand the background of the movies and the spin-off TV series.  And I found the original TV series to be laughable in many ways.  But the original TV series was the origin for the whole subsequent franchise, so I had to respect it for what it was (and particularly considering the time (1966 et seq.) in which it was produced).

In like manner, one must respect the current movie in light of this heritage, but also considering modern times.  Let me explain:  The current movie is perhaps a bit ""hyper"" regarding action and special effects, but this is exactly what it needs in order to be well received by the current generation of movie viewers (i.e., those folks who aren't old enough to remember the original TV series, but who will be following the current ""Transformer"" movies).  However, the new movie also contains enough DNA from its progenitors that it will be accepted by the faithful.  In short, this movie strikes a perfect balance between the past and present in all essential ways (production, plot and characters).  A good example is the essential inclusion in the plot of Leonard Nemoy (as ""old Spock""), thus bridging the old and the new, and perhaps the future.

Regarding the past and the future, the story line is particularly clever by using a ""Back To The Future Part II"" time-travel concept that allows the writers to ignore (in part) certain particulars in past episodes of Star Trek (both the many TV series and the movies), while still retaining the essentials of the original characters and events.  This allows the writers to take the latest episode (and presumably future episodes) of the franchise ""where no one has gone before.""  Again, a perfect balance.

And now, my views regarding pros and cons of the movie itself (ignoring any issues regarding heritage and the like): Pros: (1) out of this world (pun intended) special effects; (2) excellent casting; (3) excellent acting; (4) good storyline.  Cons: well, the only thing I can think of is the implausibility at the end of the movie that Kirk would be commissioned from a cadet to captain of a starship.  Certainly there should be at least one ranking officer in Starfleet who is better qualified than Cadet Kirk to captain the Enterprise!  In my opinion, Kirk's ascendancy to captain should perhaps have been deferred to the sequel (and you can bet your bottom dollar that there will be a sequel).  Further, the whole cast of characters in the current movie appear like ""Muppet Babies"" as compared to their counterparts in the 1966 TV series.  It's just too inconceivable that a group of cadets this young (heck, Chekov is only 17 years old in the movie) would be given overall command of a premier starship!  And particularly given that a large part of Starfleet escaped the destruction which occurred at the Vulcan planet (since a good part of the fleet was at another post during the events depicted in the movie).  But then George Custer was made a General at the ripe old age of 23 (circa 1863), so why not make Kirk a captain at about the same age in the future?  I guess this is all just part of sci-fi - i.e., the implausible can become the reality.

In summary, the movie should satisfy the needs of all audiences, making it ""the perfect balance"" (and thus a logical balance, of which Spock would approve).",1241827200,4,4160,4.664383561643835
3473117,5,B001AVCFJM,"I love the Star Trek franchise so much I want to see a new Star Trek series! A lot of fan hopes are riding on this film! The reason for a five star review! To drive this point home - I actually stopped watching television programing completely once Enterprise (the last Star Trek series) went off the air about 5 years ago! And, I have literally watched every TV episode (and film) of every Star Trek series, in real time, since its inception in 1966! I also collect rare vintage Star Trek memorabilia, have heard Leonard Nimoy, and many others involved with Star Trek, speak at various Science Fiction Conventions from the early 1970's to the present, and I subscribe to a Star Trek fanzine, ""Trexperts,"" edited by a one dedicated Star Trek fan, which is still mailed all over the world! Needless to say, the Star Trek universe has had a huge impact on my life!

I sincerely hope someone from Hollywood reads this review! In the long run (and that's what Star Trek is all about) you're not going to win new fans by dumbing-down Star Trek Into a comic book story solely to satisfy the fickle teen market! I realize a lot of the previous 11 Star Trek movies have been box office flops (and for good reason!) because IT'S ABOUT THE STORY, STUPID! Sure the special-effects-eye-candy is spectacular, the cinematography does not disappoint and the design of the sets are absolutely amazing! The acting ranged from perfect (the New Captain Kirk & Leonard McCoy) to sufficient (the new and original Mr. Spock). And, all the supporting cast certainly held their own! But the story was so unimaginative and preposterous, it came across as nothing more than contrived cardboard drivel.

It kind of boggles the mind! There are absolutely an endless number of Science Fiction themes that run through all the various Star Trek episodes. What more do you want? You have about 26 YEARS worth of episode ideas to choose from! Then there are plenty of ideas Star Trek has not explored which is summarized in a single 900+ pages book covering most Science Fiction ever written in any language in the world:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anatomy-of-Wonder-A-Critical-Guide-to-Science-Fiction-Fifth-Edition/dp/1591581710/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anatomy of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction Fifth Edition</a>. It doesn't take a rocket scientist (pun intended) to do the research to come up with new and wonderful ideas! But no! The Spineless Chickens at Paramount had to make a film with as much delight and imagination as the last Star Trek movie dud! What an incredible insult to all the Star Trek fans that have spent their time and money supporting Star Trek over the years by watching only God knows how many vapid TV commercials or spending their money on film tickets, videos, DVD sets, books & fan magazines, convention tickets and Star Trek memorabilia!

Ironically, just two days a ago I rushed out to see the brilliant science fiction animated film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-for-Terra-Blu-ray/dp/B0021L8ULW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle for Terra [Blu-ray</a>], before it was yanked out of the theater to make room for ""Star Trek."" It's hard to believe, but it was showing on a mere single screen in a metropolitan area with about 1.5 million people! Despite the magnificent animation, storyline, and acting - staring both Danny Glover and James Garner (of all people!), it was a miserable flop at the box office. Why? Because the story was both too imaginative and gutsy! Something the Star Trek franchise once was like - a long, long time ago! I can only pray that in the future Hollywood's goal of maximizing profits does not win out over substance and delight!

3473120,3,B001AVCFJM,"I wish I could say that ""Star Trek"" is the film to end all ""Star Trek"" films, but in reality, it's your run-of-the-mill summer blockbuster, and no more. It has a definite storyline, but director J.J. Abrams and writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman seemed more focused on developing overwrought action sequences and endless references to the original TV series. If you're at the point where you can only keep winking at the audience nostalgically, you've lost track of what the concept set out to do in the first place. I'm well aware that this movie is critic proof, that it will be a resounding success, and that it will spawn an entirely new series of sequels. But for my money, this reinvention of ""Star Trek"" is all about continuing a mission when it should have boldly gone where no one has gone before.

The film opens with an operatic space battle between the Federation and the Romulans. Born in the middle of it is James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine), who would grow up in Iowa as a trouble-making rebel who never knew his father. After getting into a barroom brawl--which involved a beautiful young communications officer named Uhura (Zo Saldana)--he's encouraged by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to finally apply himself and join Starfleet Academy. Kirk concedes, but as we quickly learn from the Kobayashi Maru test, he's not one for following rules. This puts him at odds with a young half-Vulcan named Spock (Zachary Quinto), who designed the test to be unbeatable. Apparently, it's not about winning so much as it's about handling yourself when in the grip of fear.

With the help of a flustered young doctor named Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban), Kirk is smuggled aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise during its first mission to the planet Vulcan, where a distress signal is being sent. When they arrive, they come face to face with Captain Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from the future who, for reasons I won't reveal, has a vendetta against Spock. Nero's mining vessel, a monstrosity that looks like a series of claws, twists its way into view, leaving in its wake a manmade black hole that eats everything in its path.

That's about as much of the plot as I'm going to describe. Needless to say, Kirk soon finds himself in command of the Enterprise, and lo and behold, here enters young versions of Hikaru Sulu (John Cho), Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and Montgomery Scott (Simon Pegg).

Had this film not been so insistent on reintroducing these characters, there's a chance that they could have been developed a bit more. We don't see complex personalities so much as actors doing impersonations of other actors. Urban, for example, is so focused on capturing the mannerisms of DeForest Kelley that we can't look past the mimicry. The same can be said for Yelchin and Pegg, both of whom seem more interested in perfecting their accents than in delving into their roles. Quinto's take on Spock, however, is a bit more acceptable, probably because of we see him struggling with identity and emotional attachment. Unfortunately, these issues play a big part in a subplot that, for lack of a better term, is highly illogical. To describe it would give too much away, but I will say that a Spock scene late in the film is so implausible that it hardly seems fitting of a ""Star Trek"" film.

As for Pine, there is the sense that he was trying to expand on a well-established character; we now have some context for Kirk's inflated ego and risk-taking behavior. Still, there are moments when he's reduced to a mere William Shatner parody, which has been done so often by so many other actors that it's virtually a clich.

I was also disappointed with the character of Nero. His motives are clear, but everything is explained in just one scene, and it passes by so quickly that what he says never really has the chance to sink in. I kept asking myself, ""What are they not telling us about this character?"" Everything about him feels rushed and incomplete. Maybe much of his screen time was left on the cutting room floor. Or maybe Abrams was too invested on the Enterprise crew to give Nero the attention he needed. Whatever the case, something's missing here.

But as I've already said, I know that ""Star Trek"" will be a very successful film. Indeed, it does deliver as an action-packed summer popcorn flick, with plenty of high-octane sequences that employ a wealth of elaborate special effects. If this is what you've been waiting for, then by all means, go see this movie. If, however, you wanted something that wasn't simply a long-winded throwback to Gene Roddenberry's original TV series, there isn't much this movie can give you. It was apparently made with the intention of appealing to all audiences and not just Trekkies, but considering how often it ropes the audience in with insider references, I don't think it achieved its goal. Fortunately, I have hope for the next film in the series; since we've been reintroduced to all the characters, there's now the opportunity to actually develop them. Until that time comes, I'll give the filmmakers a heartfelt Live Long and Prosper.",1241740800,5,5110,4.8
3473121,5,B001AVCFJM,"I just saw this movie and I loved it. Only 2 ships got blown up. The USS Kelvin and the Klingon Attack Cruiser. The Romulan's didn't appear at all in the film. At first when I saw trailers, I thought the cop was a bounty hunter. Leonard Nimoy (who played Dr. Spock in the original 70's series) appears in the film as Spock's father. They use thier peace sign saying ""Live Long and Prosper"". My favorite ship was in it. The USS Enterprise NCC-1701. The most touching moment was where Kirk is promoted to captain of the Enterprise. Another moment which is tradition in Star Trek, at the end of every movie and every series, a narrator comes on and says the following: ""Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Her ongoing misson: to discover strange, new worlds, to meet new life forms.

3473122,5,B001AVCFJM,"I spoke with my father this morning on my way to work about the newest installation into the Star Trek realm.  He said it best. We have grown up with Star Trek. I started watching Star Trek when I was in 2nd grade. I can remember the first time I got to see the Star Trek movies in the big screen.  I have lived through TNG. I was hooked on DS9. I became enthralled with Voyager. We won't talk about the other series.

I saw the trailer for the new Star Trek several months ago and I was thrilled. It looked awesome.

I enjoyed every aspect of the movie. I was so excited when I finally got to see the Enterprise - and I got to see the Enterprise kick some good ole fashion butt! The movie is packed full of hat tippings and salutes to TOS and the movies that spun from them.  There are lines that are classic lines that can never die (and not spoiling anything I promise) ... well maybe I shouldn't.

I am a HUGE Star Trek fan.  I have always enjoyed the series and for the most part I have enjoyed the movies (not all - but most). I clapped and stood up at the end of the movie and I am pleased to say that JJ Abrams didn't disrespect the world that Gene Roddenberry created.  JJ Abrams amazingly took on a gigantic pair of shoes, stepped into them and did an outstanding job filling them.

So - back to what my father said.  Kirk, Bones, Spock, The Enterprise and the rest are our friends.  They are our backyard, football throwin, buddies. They are our companions.  They are people we grew up with and we knew. So we went to the theatre to make sure that the person they cast as our friends was perfect. And guess what? - They Did.

3473123,3,B001AVCFJM,"Minor Spoilers ahead:

I admit: it was a well-made and somewhat entertaining film with a decent cast. But many of my fears were realised -- Time travel and alternate universes in Trek have been done-to-death already. Also, the 'vengeance for my dead wife' plot motivation? Oh please!! And playing Scotty purely for laughs is an insult to the memory of James Doohan and the dignity he brought to his character. Also: U.S.S. Enterprise only *just* being launched with Pike in command? No! Pike got to command Enterprise for about a decade first. And Kirk making Captain in his mid 20s after one adventure, just out of the Academy? NOT even in the gravest of wartimes would such a scenario happen. Also, Chekov on the ship while Kirk is in his mid-20s? But that would mean Chekov is about EIGHT years old?!! And Warp Drive is a series of quick 'Battlestar Galactica' ""jumps""? Yuck!! And they fly to Vulcan in a few minutes when in Star Trek: The Motion Picture it said it would take FOUR DAYS?

Why dumb these details down, when a few 'strokes of the writers pen' would fix them?

I give the film a solid B for entertainment value, but C- for er, ""Faithful Trekkiness"". And I'm SICK TO DEATH of the ""lets wobble the camera violently during action scenes to try and denote excitement"" motion-sickness, A.D.D. syndrome. That can be a crutch for lazy editing. Next time I see it on a large scale in ANY film, I'm walking out...

With most of the fleet on an extended mission, Star Fleet empties the Academy.  James T.

3473125,4,B001AVCFJM,"J.J. Abrams' Star Trek is one of the most exciting Trek films since Wrath of Khan and the Search for Spock. Years after a Romulan attack that killed his father, a thrill seeking farm boy, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) joins Star Fleet. He doesn't take it seriously and cheats on a test. Which doesn't impress Spock (Zachary Quinto) much since he's all for going by the rules. They don't get along, but a Romulan attack on the Enterprise they're on might just be enough to force them to work together.

  I really enjoyed this movie. The cast was a lot of fun and everyone did a good job in their roles. I was surprised how well Karl Urban played Bones. He wouldn't have been my first choice for the role either. Zachary Quinto comfortably plays Spock as well and plays the part perfectly. While Chris Pine is more of a gun-ho Kirk than I'm used to,. He is perfectly cocky as him though. Zoe Saldana wasn't bad as Uhura but my only problem with the movie is how she was used. I mean, I don't remember a Spock, Kirk and Uhura love triangle in the original series or movies lol. Spock making-out with her just felt wrong. But I was still entertained by the look on Kirk's face witnessing it.

  I'm not used to a Star Trek film where Spock is a stud or one with some bad language either. While  the space battles were a bit better in previous films. I still found a lot of the film exciting and fun though. Which is something I haven't felt watching a Star Trek film in awhile.

3473126,5,B001AVCFJM,"J.J. Abrams has done the impossible by making a Star Trek film for everyone. It will appeal to long time fans (most anyways) and the unintiated alike. What really surprised me is how this is more of a character driven film than one relying just on action and SFX. The casting is outstanding, especially Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock. Pine manages to get the essence of Kirk, but not being a parody of William Shatner. He is cocky, yet you know there is intelligence that goes along with his recklessness. Before watching this movie I couldn't think of anyone who combines the looks and smarts to play Spock other than Leonard Nimoy, but Quinto manages to pull it off brilliantly. Karl Urban made a very good Dr. McCoy early on, but they seemed to forget about his character as the movie progressed. The rest of the cast is good, but they are not given that much to do. I just heard on the news that most have signed on for two more movies, so perhaps they will all get their due in future installments. Eric Bana was the weak link here for me. He just wasn't a very intimidating villain. Maybe it was more of the character than his actual acting, but he is not even close to the legend that is Khan. Leonard Nimoy's role was pivotal and not just some cheap cameo, so that was nice.

The story, while not mind blowing, is clever enough. For a time travel plot, it is rather easy to follow and I like how they made it an alternate reality to cover up any inconsistencies with the past series.

The music (loved how they used the old theme music over the end credits) and SFX are very good as expected. There is also quite a bit of humor that works most of the time. My theater was pretty much full and everyone seemed to be having a good time during and after the movie ended. Star Trek is a well made summer blockbuster that has wide appeal and will likely spawn at least two sequels. So beam up to your local theater and prepare to boldy go where no man has gone before.

3473127,3,B001AVCFJM,"The new Star Trek movie was billed as not being your father's Star Trek, it's not. Due to the villain, Nero's (Eric Bana) entering a black hole and going back in time altering the time line and the destinies and relationships of the characters (one major relationship that goes unexplained) that hadn't existed before, now exists. Every generation reinterprets its myths and that's what Paramount is trying to do here, reboot Star Trek for a more action oriented younger audience.

The essence of all the major characters are here, Chris Pine has the swagger, and at times seems to channel William Shatner without resorting to parody. Zachary Quinto is exemplary as Spock, Karl Urban playing McCoy is dead on, although, the repeated ""damn it Jim, I'm a Doctor not a ....,"" seems campy, but the backstory about why Kirk calls him Bones is excellent and funny. Zoe Saladana is given more to do as Uhura than usually is in Star Trek, John Cho seems like he could age to be George Takei. While I'm talking about the actors, Eric Bana turns in another bland performance, he doesn't seem very dangerous or threatening.

Here is a couple of things to quibble over. The Kobahsi Maru simulation seems better in The Wrath of Khan. And would you really build a starship on earth?

This Star Trek is high adventure, but Star Trek was also about substance within the adventure, that's what made it special and after you learn that the destinies these characters are leading is different from the destinies of the characters we've grown to know and love over the years, I lost a bit of interest, it wasn't what I bargained for, I was interested in seeing how those characters got together and created the crew of the Enterprise. It seems to me that from the original series there was enough outlining information that was vague enough to create an equally appealing adventure without discounting and destroying the histories of the characters we know. I hope that the future adventures of the Enterprise manage to get more substance into the adventure. If you're a Star Trek fan like I am, you're probably going to see this movie over the weekend. If you're a borderline fan and want to see it at the theaters, a matinee is probably the right price for this, and if you're on the fringes, you can probably wait for the DVD.",1241740800,4,2309,4.696296296296296
3473128,3,B001AVCFJM,"First, the movie was entertaining and fast-paced -- mindless fun really since the movie made no real sense (let's just throw in a Black Hole, a Giant Drill, and Red Matter to make it Sci-Fi).  However, it makes no sense unless you take it forward as a new crew to explore under conditions of an alternate reality...

Since Spock from the future is in the present of the ""original ENTERPRISE crew"" (which, by the way, Chekov was NOT a part of) as they make headway in their first film, this is just Star Trek taking off on new adventures in another alternate universe where Vulcan is destroyed, Spock's mother is dead, Kirk's father is deceased (and he is promoted to to Captain before he ever graduates the academy), Spock and Uhura are lovers, the ship is more technically advanced than the Enterprise D, and more importantly Scotty is a renegade with a new cute sidekick!

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

Even if you take into account that history was changed by the Romulans going back in time, It doesn't account for all of the changes. The franchise has been changed to appeal to teenagers while betraying 40 years of dedicated fans.

Since Spock exists and has disrupted time, the adventures that we know of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, etc., can NEVER and WILL NEVER exist due to all historical events being changed.  Great move to move the franchise forward with new movies, but it destroys the concept of the Crew of the Enterprise that we know and love, since they are in a past alternate universe that has now been destroyed.

So, to heck with all with know about Star Trek.  May the older Spock live and mentor the new Spock, who will father Uhura's Love-Child, which will infuriate Nurse Chapel who may go on a jealous rampage and may very well not decide to mother Deanna Troi (this is a joke, but why not, and for good measure let's add Data to the next movie while the iron is hot!).

C'mon.  This movie could have been really fun if it focused on true origins and not some cockamamie alternate time story that will now lead the future of the franchise.

Be thankful you were not involved Bill Shatner, as the REAL Captain Kirk did die on a planet fighting Malcolm McDowell with Captain Picard.  Btw, the real Kirk got knocked down, but he never lost fights!  This Kirk got his butt kicked over and over again.  It really is not your Father's Kirk (or in my case, MY Kirk).

Just Sad. Perhaps the solution would have been to resurrect the original Animated Series and present the crew in a full-length story in that movie medium instead of what I sat through just about an hour ago?",1241740800,8,2578,4.513978494623656

What suprised me the most? - Was it's humor and compassion for the characters. What a great story - bending and remolding the origional Star Trek lore - it still kept true to what is the best of STAR TREK.
You would think because of the advertising that Eric Banna and Winnona Ryder were major players in this film - if they are anything, they are more like guest stars.
Zachary Quinto, Chris Pine, Karl Urban, Bruce Greenwood and - Leonard Nimoy are MAJOR players in this movie. Yes Spock Prime as he is referred to - is pivital to this entire film. ANd there is an amazing paradox that you will see! Between Spock  - and --well I'll let you be surprised.
Even Sulu, Chekov and Scotty have major saving moments that you'll long remember after you leave the theatre.
And Uhura - she has a relationship - and you'll never guess with who...? There is a great backs tory - although short - about very young Kirk and very young Spock that will explain much of who they became to be.
Of course the effects are state of the art, the uniform and ship designs are sharp and refined - although the Bridge looks like they stopped off in Las Vegas and picked up a few pointers. The Bridge is so bright and colorful. And everything from Phasers to the Transporters got a new sleek look.

I have loved Star Trek since I was a kid and was more than a little apprehensive about this ""reboot,"" with different characters and a plot that didn't exactly fit the canon that has been built on for the last 40 years. I had faith though, because I like Fringe and LOST, and now I know it's true - everything J.J. Abrams touches turns to gold. The actors and writers did an incredible job of paying homage to the characters that we know and love, and yet the new things we hadn't seen before were totally believable. Yes, the story went in a new direction - but it built on everything that makes Star Trek enjoyable. The references to other series made me smile - ""Admiral"" Archer's dog, for example - these guys definitely did their homework. I was surprised by a few things, but definitely not disappointed. I think Gene and Majel would be impressed, and all of the original actors should feel honored with the respect paid to them. In some cases, the new actors (dare I say it?) played the characters better than we've seen before. McCoy was his crusty self, Kirk hit on just about every female but showed the utmost concern for the mission, his crew and his ship, Spock was eminently logical yet conflicted, Scotty was the miracle-worker. Sulu and Uhura were way more interesting than their original counterparts. Yet nothing was overdone...well maybe Chekov's accent (lol). The action sequences were incredible, the sound was so intense it felt like I was there - and the picture, wow... definitely see this in IMAX. The Enterprise never looked so good, and when all was said and done, I was left with something else that I haven't felt for a long time, if ever - I am PROUD to be a Star Trek fan. Mad props to everyone who was involved with this film. I was left speechless, and all I can say now is ""More!""",1241740800,7,1931,4.473087818696884
3473131,5,B001AVCFJM,"I also have just finished watching Star Trek XI and I must say that I am very satisfied with the film. The cast fit the roles of the characters perfectly and it almost felt like I had to take a second glance when Quinto was on screen as Spock. He did a remarkable job and was like watching a young Nimoy all over again! Everyone else in the cast was great, but like in the original series, the characters of Chekov and Sulu are used very little. I would have liked to have seen more of them in the film. I brag about Quinto's Spock, but I would almost say that Urban's McCoy really stole the show. He really nails down Bones' accent and mannerisms perfectly.

The story was written well and had a lot of references for Trekkies to pick up on, and even had a Tribble thrown in for good measure. I especially liked the mention of a particular person and his pet from the TV series Enterprise. That was a nice little line for the fans of ENT.

I couldn't help but be impressed with Nero's monster ship which he uses to get around in the movie. It is actually quite a beast on the big theater screen. It is easy to tell that you are definitely helpless against a ship that big. The Enterprise (with all of the new changes) looked really good inside and out. In my short review of the film, I would say that it is very much worth seeing. By the end of the film, it definitely felt like Trek. With all of the changes that happen by the end of the movie, I can't wait to see where the story goes from here! The slate is practically clean to write some new storylines that can be just as interest and probably even better.",1241740800,4,1614,4.169871794871795
3473132,5,B001AVCFJM,"I went into this with an open mind and I was rewarded with one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've ever had. I have loved Star Trek since I was a kid and was more than a little apprehensive about this ""reboot,"" with different characters and a plot that didn't exactly fit the canon that has been built on for the last 40 years. I had faith though, because I like Fringe and LOST, and now I know it's true - everything J.J. Abrams touches turns to gold. The actors and writers did an incredible job of paying homage to the characters that we know and love, and yet the new things we hadn't seen before were totally believable. Yes, the story went in a new direction - but it built on everything that makes Star Trek enjoyable. The references to other series made me smile - ""Admiral"" Archer's dog, for example - these guys definitely did their homework. I was surprised by a few things, but definitely not disappointed. I think Gene and Majel would be impressed, and all of the original actors should feel honored with the respect paid to them. In some cases, the new actors (dare I say it?) played the characters better than we've seen before. McCoy was his crusty self, Kirk hit on just about every female but showed the utmost concern for the mission, his crew and his ship, Spock was eminently logical yet conflicted, Scotty was the miracle-worker. Sulu and Uhura were way more interesting than their original counterparts. Yet nothing was overdone...well maybe Chekov's accent (lol). The action sequences were incredible, the sound was so intense it felt like I was there - and the picture, wow... definitely see this in IMAX. The Enterprise never looked so good, and when all was said and done, I was left with something else that I haven't felt for a long time, if ever - I am PROUD to be a Star Trek fan. Mad props to everyone who was involved with this film. I was left speechless, and all I can say now is ""More!""",1241740800,128,1931,4.473087818696884

Arguably, not Star Trek.  Did you wonder about any philosophical question the whole time?  Oh well.  For this reason, I almost can't give it 5 stars.

But the music.  Holy crap, Michael Giacchino.  Amazing.  The leitmotifs interweave so ingeniously.  Plus they're great independently!  And believe it or not, many of them hail to the crappy backing music from The Original Series, but he somehow made them great.  And dat brass.  So good.",1527033600,,478,5.0519480519480515
