8550550,1,B0047IKEBG,"I bought this DVD thinking there may be some decent tips on long range shooting, as well as some good hunts.

I could not have been more wrong.  I actually fell asleep twice while trying to get through this one.  Not because I was tired, but hearing the same mono-tone garbage repeated constantly throughout the dvd actually made me sleepy.  The commentary never quits, and basically ruins any of the decent hunting footage they did manage to use.  These guys are trying hard to follow in the ""Best of the West"" style, but failed in ways that made me embarrased to watch.

These guys offer outstanding, cutting edge advice on the subject of long range shooting.  I lost count of how many times it was stated ""Welllll, to shoot long range you got to have an accurate rifle"", followed by ""you know, accurate rifles are very important"".  Wow. Thank you, Captain Obvious.  The theme for the entire DVD is the same - they offer very general, vague advice that any beginner shooter already knows.  Obviously a good rest is important.  Obviously, wind can affect a shot.  Obviously, you need to practice.  Yet these morons stress these points over and over, without once getting into specifics.  After watching this dvd, you will want to get up from your chair, remove the dvd from your player, and throw it in the garbage.

Hopefully in their next dvd, they can unlock the mystery of why the ground gets wet after it rains.",1292630400,3,1417,4.634538152610442
