8616914,3,B00FMGPWLY,"first off, this is a smaller version of the COMPLETE DVD set just released in Oct 2013 by the same company!
Why would you then offer a smaller version of the same product?
  The quality is unacceptable for today's DVD standards, I don't mean a today's show but a remaster of a old classic. The prints are ""public domain"" quality, heck thats prob what they used! They made no real effort to clean up the picture or audio drop outs, just a quick slapped together DVD set. I could have done a better job just using my PC had I been given access to the prints, I could have adjusted the audio drop outs to a normalized levels and cleared up some of the fuzzy pic quality, thats really sad when I at my own PC could have done a better job, same on Comedy III to release such trash quality!",1385251200,2,784,4.185430463576159
