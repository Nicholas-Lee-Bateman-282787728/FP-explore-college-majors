1757901,4,B00006HAXF,"This installment has Jodie Keane and John Lawless delving into the seedy night life of New Zealand. When a man's death is deemed by the police as suicide his widow hires them... actually she's more interested in just Lawless. Was his suicide really murder and, if so, ""who dunnit""?

As a stand alone I'm afraid Beyond Justice isn't too strong and would recommend at least seeing its predecessor, Lawless: Dead Evidence, before hand. Questions like: what's so important about the private investigator's license being in Jodie's name, Andy and his dogs, Lawless' past, and what's between him and Jodie? will leave new viewers out on a lot.

For those that know what's going on there's a lot to love here. Kevin Smith (Lawless), Angela Dotchin (Jodie), and Bruce Hopkins (Andy) reprise their roles and do a great job as always. Smith and Dotchin, especially, have great chemistry together, and are fun to watch. The story is good with many suspects and the pair getting into trouble as usual.
Jennifer Rubin is definetly the weak link here. It's like she belongs in another movie all together and is very distracting; completely miscast.

The DVD extras are pretty basic: Original trailer, other previews, and, the stand out, cast interviews.

Beyond Justice is a solid go at neo noir and if that's your genre you'll like this movie. For Kevin Smith fans it's a must have. Looking into New Zealand made movies? Get Dead Evidence and Beyond Justice as a double feature.",1112227200,5,1465,4.871485943775101
1757902,5,B00006HAXF,"I've seen Lawless I, II and III, this saga just kept getting better and better. The title character is played by Kiwi actor, known as Ares God of War and Iphicles, brother of Hercules to those of us in the US on the shows: Hercules the Legendary Journeys and Xena Warrior Princess. Kevin was so wonderful on both shows that I had to see his other work. An incredibly gifted actor, his work should be made more easily available. If you can get your hands on it, see Channelling Baby and Desperate Remedies, you won't be disappointed.
Sadly, Kevin was taken from this world on February 16, 2002 in a tragic accident in China. His fans will miss him eternally but his work will be forever admired.",1046390400,4,694,4.47244094488189
7968761,3,B00006HAXF,"an okay story by some tv-type pros who create a non-original story plot and follow it to conclusion.  it's exciting as my description.  ok, but if you miss it, it doesn't matter.  if you watch it, it doesn't matter.  would we call it a rainy day film for single people?",1513900800,,269,4.32
