Kelly (Gabriella Wilde) and Jonas (Thomas Dekker), a desperate drug-addicted homeless couple, have a random stroke of luck and find themselves squatting in the lavish home of the wealthy Silvermans, who are vacationing in Greece. Jonas rationalizes that it should be their privilege to do this because rich people are all corrupt pigs anyway, but Kelly watches the Silvermans' home movies and finds them to be more tragically ordinary and human than Jonas will ever realize. Jonas gets a little too eager and greedy with the Silvermans' expensive jewelry and cars, arranging a lucrative deal with a dangerous racketeer, and to tell you any more would be spoilous.

SQUATTERS is well-acted by just about everyone involved, with especially memorable performances by Wilde and Luke Grimes as Michael Silverman. Some other reviewers have criticized its Hollywood-slick portrayal of life's underside in L.A., and it could have shown a bit more sympathy in that area, but what it does show seemed pretty realistic to me. The general cinematography is excellent, with some really pretty south Cali scenery.

On the other hand, the transformation that Kelly and Jonas make is pretty unconvincing, as are certain other things, e.g., Jonas's safe-cracking abilities, and wouldn't the maid be coming by occasionally? The ending's somewhat rushed plus a little too neat, easy, and Peter Pan for many tastes. Overall, it just seems that the directors and writers could have made a little more-in-general happen here.

Still, SQUATTERS does have some interesting turnabouts and nice old morals to it. The fine acting and expert production help compensate for some of the basic flaws to the story, and I like the way it left me rooting for both Kelly/Jonas and the Silvermans.",1403308800,3,1774,5.1923076923076925
6389003,4,B00JQHOEOG,The acting was really good  . The story line  not so original  but well done . It was something that could actually happen probably does never tell anyone you're going on a vacation . It had some romance here as well as some had a conscience .,1403222400,,243,4.127659574468085
6389004,4,B00JQHOEOG,"I  was disappointed because Squatters has a premise with promise.  It starts out reasonably realistic, except in minor details, particularly the characters portrayed as homeless delinquents, shoplifting and doing drugs, just don't look the part, still showing their perfect hollywood smiles.  Well that's ok because it moves quickly into an intriguing situation, when they sneak into the home of a wealthy family on vacation, steal their valuable and live it up. But instead of showing the consequences realistically,  the plot takes a turn into a fairytale romance with a happy ending that would have been appropriate for a comedy.  But it's not a comedy so the result is something more like an after school TV special, not bad, just not as intense or groundbreaking as the original premise promised. I want to give it 3 and 1/2 stars, and bumped it up to 4 because if you're looking for a crime drama with a happy ending you'll probably like it.",1403136000,2,947,4.89375
6389005,5,B00JQHOEOG,it's a terrific movie.. wonderful story line.. altogether entertaining..!!!  I suggest it for anyone that likes a tender story with excitement thrown in!!,1402704000,4,154,5.695652173913044
6389006,5,B00JQHOEOG,"This was a very good movie. At first, I only decided to check it out because of Gabriella Wilde, because I am such a big fan of hers and I really like her movies. I watched the trailer and I thought to myself ""Doesn't look too bad."" As the movie went on, it got better and better. Gabriella Wilde is a great actress and she did a great job with her character, and I will defiantly be checking out some more of her movies. I love how the two adults went from street rats to Cinderella and the Prince. I highly recommend this movie. It has a great story line, a great plot, great acting, and great actors. If you want to watch it for free, go to YouTube and type in Squatters 2014 full movie. It has the full movie available for free. Check it out, you might like it.",1402272000,,765,4.072847682119205
6389007,2,B00JQHOEOG,"Was too fakey right from the start. Most dumpster diving streeters look nothing like our Hollywood made up with make up, eye candy actors. The ripping off of a small deli scenes were Holly stereotyping; the grungy look was too wardrobe department shopping; the dirty faces/bodies looked like what a make up artist would create with a brush and the same medium gray water based paint - brush painting in all the right places. More laughable than real.
The matrix slow motion effects were as cheap as the very fake punches being thrown in one scene.
The owners' reaction after coming home to see what was a home invasion and theft was, ""What's for dinner!"" The son home owner's son predictably and unimaginatively falls for our now magically transformed theft girl (Cinderella after a bath and stolen clothes.) Like all love stories (Well, Hollywood love stories.) on finding out the  attractive girl he loves also is the girl that robbed his family's house, he still is hooked. Thus continues the movie's drama.

Roughly equivalent to daytime tele soap opera production, if that is one's entertainment interest.",1402185600,,1110,4.962365591397849
6389008,2,B00JQHOEOG,"I am a huge Richard Dreyfus fan and I must say I was hugely disappointed in this.  I guess I was expecting more of him.  he was pretty much wasted in this movie, which was more centered on the kids.  I also recently saw Richard in ""leaves of grass"", which I thought, for him, was pretty embarrassing.  so was this.  Mr Dreyfus is one of the best actors of our generation, I guess all Hollywood is now willing to do and he only willing to accept small crap parts like this. its a shame. the movie as a whole was pretty well done. I just wish an artist like Richard Dreyfuss wasn't going down the toilet like this.  I remember him well from NUTS, Whose life is it anyway, and the Goodbye girl.  I hope he gets some better parts than this in the future or he think about retirement.",1401148800,,779,4.153333333333333
6389009,4,B00JQHOEOG,"I've read nothing but negative reviews on other sites, so I rented it and was pleasantly surprised at the actors and everything Richard Dreyfuss is fine by me.

It was very entertaining rags to riches story, and I recommend it",1400889600,,226,4.65
6389010,4,B00JQHOEOG,"Engaging story. Very good overall production. Well acted. Interesting look at young people's lives, family and redemption. Looking forward to more of writer Justin Shilton's work.",1400716800,,179,5.923076923076923

6389012,5,B00JQHOEOG,"I will not say too much about this movie, I will say it was so well-acted by all, so well-directed, so well written. I applaud all the actors for doing not only a splendid acting job but also for how convincing they were in their parts. Gabriella Wilde and Thomas Dekker live on the streets he overhears a woman saying she and her family will be away for a month, he and his girlfriend move in and the family comes back early. There is much more that happens, believe me, not all of it is good. the family's son Luke Grimes is superb too. I've just touched the surface of this fine movie. Which not to jump on a platform, illustrates that we as a country should not have people living on the streets. Homelessness should not happen in the so called richest country in the world that cares about it's people. I felt for all of the characters (well most, wait til you meet the fence).",1415750400,4,882,4.287425149700598

6389019,5,B00JQHOEOG,"Gabrielle Wilde is certain to become an Oscar winner. There seldom is as beautiful a woman as this young actress. Squatters is the first time I've seen her act. Very impressive role, in which she exhibited a rare combination of acting ability with stunning beauty. I loved the film, the story and highly recommend the film. I hope Wilde will be in many more films.",1404604800,3,364,4.615384615384615

Plus, being a huge Richard Dreyfuss fan, anything I can find with him as an actor is well worth the watch in my opinion. And Gabriella sure did shine in this movie - I look forward to more from her.
