4596655,4,B0057JAO4Q,This was a gift for my brother that has always enjoyed the old western TV weekly programs. I have seen part of the programs and also enjoyed it.,1360454400,,144,4.178571428571429
8460777,1,B0057JAO4Q,"Cheap, but absolutely awful transfers from obviously p.d. materials. Check out the unadjusted color on the pan and scan of ""McClintock"". Then, look at the ""Bonanza"" episodes missing the famous theme music, likely the only element copyright protected. Plus, jam packing digits onto a single layer disc. The nice metal box is definitely worth more than the trashy dvds inside.",1510099200,,374,5.25

8460779,4,B0057JAO4Q,"I loved the collection of old western shows.
The only draw back is my player won't let me run all of them back to back start to finish.
It finished a show and goes back to main menu.
Fix that and this is a five star dvd",1470614400,,219,3.6808510638297873

8460781,1,B0057JAO4Q,"I got this present from the Easter bunny, but when I listened, they had removed the original theme music and the video got washed out, so I would not buy this one again, never!!

BEWARE OF THE DIFFERENT MUSIC THEY PUT ON BONANZA!!!

Get something better, anything else than this one.",1428192000,,283,4.529411764705882
