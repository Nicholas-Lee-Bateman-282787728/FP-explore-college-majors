8405626,4,B003U4O8LK,"The storyline starts with some neat Sam Peckinpah-style World War II action then flashes forward to persent day (late 1970s - this film was released in 1980) when veterans gather and party hardy in Manila.  The son of the Japanese commander who was killed, along with his wife (who was also raped by some unruly GIs), witnessed the carnage and returns to single out the guilty one by one.  Part mystery and part martial arts action.  Leo Fong was one of the original kickboxers (forerunners of MMA-style fighting).  Not a steller acting performance but he's surrounded by solid veteran actors including Cameron Mitchell and Phillip Baker Hall.  This has all the elements of the genre when films were made by humans, not computers.",1388361600,,730,4.902439024390244
8405627,1,B003U4O8LK,"For the love of me, I can't write much about this movie - there just isn't much to say, other than that it's a bad Leo Fong movie from the late-70s. Anyone familiar with the man's output will more or less know what this generally encompasses, but even fans of Fong will probably be disappointed for the fact that there aren't even a lot of action scenes to enjoy. Rareflix.com certainly upheld their knack for re-releasing totally uncompelling movies with this one.

The story: decades after a squad of WWII soldiers in the Philippines murder a Japanese general and his wife, they reunite in Manila for a celebration - unaware that the son of their victims (Fong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Low-Blow/dp/6302669928/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Low Blow</a>) is prepared to carry out his long-awaited revenge.

Again, I need to stress that there isn't much action in this film. In the audio commentary (one of the few interesting things about this DVD release), Leo Fong himself admits that the marketing for the movie is flawed: it's a revenge thriller, not a ninja movie, with the result that there's only one cruddy martial arts fight halfway through, an opening war shootout, and a bit of punching throughout. However, even as a you-killed-my-parents-so-now-I-must-decapitate-you type of picture, ""Revenge"" just isn't very satisfying, given that the offings are too few, too far between, and far too brief to be worth waiting for.

Though the movie includes a handful of genuine stars - including Philip Baker Hall (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Insider/dp/B00003CWRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Insider</a>), Cameron Mitchell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-High-Chaparral/dp/B003TLHPIM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The High Chaparral</a>), and Hope Holiday (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Apartment/dp/B0010AN7Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Apartment</a>) in a small role - the acting is roundly godawful. Leo Fong's voice is dubbed throughout (to hide his southern accent). The cheap video transfer doesn't help the visual quality: night scenes are shot with a lazy blue filter and the color tint inexplicably changes between shots in several scenes. A few scenes featuring Manila city and its clubs are colorful, but by and by, it's a very dull movie to look at, populated with dull characters.

Leo Fong, though he seems pleased or at least amused by his movie, seems to share my sentiment that it's pretty boring in his commentary, since half of the time he talks about unrelated matters and different films. The DVD disguises a handful of random, audio-free trimmings as ""deleted scenes,"" so the audio commentary really is the only thing worth buying the movie for, for devotees. Everyone else, stay as far away from this junk as possible.",1343001600,,2928,5.964285714285714
