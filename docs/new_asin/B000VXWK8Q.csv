2958408,5,B000VXWK8Q,"This is a REAL review of the dvd set.  I pre-ordered it from wweshop and got it via fedex this morning.  First for the ppl wanting to know, YES the DX Nation parody is in full, and does feature the Owen Hart part of the segment, unlike being edited out in past dvd releases.  All the segments on the set are in FULL.  If your a fan of RAW in 2007 and or a fan of the older 1993 RAW, you can't go wring with this set. The packaging is pretty neat as well.  the dvd's are in 3 slim dvd cases all with covers and info.  the front of the box its self is 3D like.",1197936000,3,558,3.7264957264957266
2958409,5,B000VXWK8Q,"does anyone know if the dvd is going to contain the entire ""15 anniversary of RAW"" episode that played 2 days ago?",1197331200,,114,4.2272727272727275
2958410,5,B000VXWK8Q,Does anyone Know if they are actually gonna show the entire matches or just highlights from them? Either way its gonna be great!,1196985600,,128,4.608695652173913
2958411,5,B000VXWK8Q,"I was at a local store (cant say it on Amazon but some reviewers can) and I noticed this lone dvd sitting on the shelf. It was nowheres else but in that one spot. I picked it up and was so excited and it even contained a bonus dvd with the full first epsiode of Raw! Its an awesome dvd set and has alot of unforgetable moments. The only thing I thought they could have done without is the popup information that comes on the screen every now and then. It would have been cool as an extra feature but it was annoying in some areas. The WWE released four- three disc sets in the last half of the year-Ladder matches, Rey Mysterio, Shawn Michaels, John Cena, and this dvd. All the dvds except Cena is worth it and I really hope WWE keeps the trend of three dvd sets coming in 2008. I know Stone Cold's set is on the way. I did notice some moments missing but not every dvd set can be perfect. They did not show any Beniot footage which was understandable but this set leaves a door open for more of the Best of Raw dvd sets in the near future. The set is nine hours and awesome, there is alot of footage left to show.",1196985600,9,1114,4.04524886877828

2958419,3,B000VXWK8Q,Fun and funny moments from Raw.  Not many full matches as more of promos and confrontations in the ring or backstage.  Some are clipped through and not shown in their entireity so that was a let down.,1412208000,,200,4.378378378378378

2958422,5,B000VXWK8Q,"I wanted to address a few concerns that were posted by others earlier. Their comments almost caused me not to buy the DVD, but I'm glad that I went ahead and bought it.

To address a couple of things:

1)The pop-ups aren't intrusive at all, and in fact, they're not plentiful.

There are maybe three pop ups that come up during each segment, and they are just off to the bottom right side, and I barely even notice them. They don't cover the screen, and they don't make a big noise from what I remember. You can easily just ignore them. It's a complete non-issue for me. I'm relieved, because I thought they'd be a much bigger deal, based on what some people here were saying. The main thing to remember is that they barely even happen during each segment. From the way some here made it sound, I thought it'd be a constant thing. It's not AT ALL.

2)The matches ARE here in their entirety, at least the matches that I've watched so far (Shawn Michaels vs. Edge Street Fight; Shawn Michaels vs. Shelton Benjamin RAW; Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle Iron Man Match; Edge vs. Rob Van Dam vs. John Cena Triple Threat Match).

I cannot vouch for every single match, as I haven't watched them all yet, but I assume they're all here in their entirety, since that was the case with every single match that I happened to watch.

I think that what is confusing people is that these were TV matches, therefore they went to commercials during these matches. When that happens, they simply just come back straight away from the commercial break. This is the same with EVERY WWE release of tv matches. Therefore this DVD is no different, and there is NOTHING edited out except for the commercials. You're not missing anything you didn't miss on tv, or on any other dvd release that contains tv matches. The matches are full and complete.

In summary:

I have to say that this was a great buy, especially because you get so many great moments for a good price. I put the third disc in, not expecting to watch it all. I was just going to skip around to the stuff that I bought the set for, but ended up watching the entire disc, and enjoyed pretty much every second of it.

It's a breezy, fun, watch, and contains some great matches, and some of RAW's most fun and notable moments.

I'd definitely recommend buying this!",1388707200,8,2303,4.448931116389549
2958423,3,B000VXWK8Q,"I got this for my 10yr old son as a ""history"" of RAW for him.  Its may just be me but I remember more/better moments than whats on here!  For nostalgia purposes or to introduce a younger fan to RAW its not bad though.",1387670400,,217,3.909090909090909
2958424,3,B000VXWK8Q,"I ordered a used copy of this title for around $1.70. It was shipped via US Mail (snail mail), and took forever to arrive. This is the Christmas season, and all mail is likely slowed down.

I usually watch all my DVDs on my Mac computers. I usually ""rip"" the DVDs so I can watch them without handling the discs themselves. The DVDs played fine on the computers. I was shocked when they would not play on my regular DVD player, attached to my TV. I tried another WWE DVD title with the DVD player & it worked just fine!

This isn't a major problem for me. It would be a problem for my Dad. I love to send my Dad some WWE DVDs as a surprise disc. Dad prefers to watch videos on his TV, with a DVD player.

The audio & video quality of the videos is just fine. There's a nice selection to watch. I'm watching it now, on my TV, using the Roku 3 attached to a USB hard drive.",1387670400,,870,3.9885057471264367

2958426,4,B000VXWK8Q,"This is a 3 disc set hosted by Todd Grisham doing wraparound segments in-between matches and interviews. Each disc covers a 5 year period of Raw.

Overall I found this set to be enjoyable and a nice trip down memory lane(especially disc 2, 1998-2002). But it is really difficult to adequately cover 15 years of history even in a three disc set.

Each 5 year period could have it's own 3-disc set. As it is, this set barely scratches the surface of all the history of Raw. Still a fun watch and nice to re-live the memories.",1361059200,,523,4.381443298969073

2958428,5,B000VXWK8Q,"It was great to see the good ole days of RAW, it was kind of sad though because a lot of the greats from that period are now gone (Mr. Perfect,Macho Man,Sherri, Luna, Owen Hart, Rick Rude, etc). I loved reliving all the Attitude Era shenanigans, perfect for any die hard wrestling fan that long for the days when the wwf/wwe was still good.",1354665600,,340,4.328125

2958431,4,B000VXWK8Q,"Overall it's a great compilation of exciting moments on RAW, especially going back to the very beginning, but each disc has a bit much of Shawn Michaels, despite having a lot of legends & superstars that have been part of the RAW franchise. Still a very good collection of moments of RAW I would've preffer a bit more variety in terms of the matches showcased instead of Michaels becoming the main character for the matches displayed. And if you've been out of touch with the WWE, this will keep you up to date, and I would definitely recommend:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-RAW-The-Best-of-2009/dp/B002W1UIW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE RAW: The Best of 2009</a>&nbsp;,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-RAW-The-Best-of-2010/dp/B00465I1DS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE RAW: The Best of 2010</a>&nbsp;,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-The-Best-of-Smackdown-10th-Anniversary-1999-2009/dp/B002C6VMJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: The Best of Smackdown - 10th Anniversary 1999-2009</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raw-Smackdown-The-Best-of-2011/dp/B005TZFYM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raw & Smackdown: The Best of 2011</a>",1321660800,,1304,8.738805970149254
2958432,3,B000VXWK8Q,"The WWE was in a no win position here because on one hand if they put full matches on here, there would need to be a couple more disks, which would've increased price. By clipping down matches you get three disks, but a rightfully angered fan base who spent hard earned money on this set. Personally, I would rather have complete matches That being said, the selection of what constitues Best particularly on the disks for the Attitude Era and beyond is a little underwhelming Mean Street Posse v. Patterson & Brisco was not a best moment for me at least and even some of the bigger moments are clipped down. But there's no way to accomadate everyone's taste because if they release full season sets of RAW to get complete matches i'm not sure i'd have the patience to sit through all the bad stuff to gleam the few gems.",1275091200,,821,4.443708609271523

2958434,3,B000VXWK8Q,"Purchased this for Christmas, with great expectations, as I've seen most of the shows over the 15 years. While there are many memorable moments on this 3 disc set, there are some truly forgettable! Mean Street Posse, Big Bossman Sympathy & Musical Chairs with Eugene are some lowlights. There are some great matches, some very funny & shocking moments, the majority provided by Stone Cold & The Rock. There are many great matches from Shawn Michaels on this set, however he comes across as the golden boy of WWE as he's shown in 6 matches and many promos, where as many other superstars are not shown at all or nearly as much! No Randy Savage or Hulk, OK there best was probably before this but surely there must've been something of note. Nothing shown on the nation of domination. Also disappointing that there are no extras on any of the 3 discs. Finally, while Todd Grisham did an admirable job introducing many segments, it would've been far more interesting to have those involved in the segments comment. Overall a good compilation but one that I would hire rather than purchase.",1262563200,,1086,4.721052631578948

2958437,1,B000VXWK8Q,"this vote is strictly based on the inclusion of an incomprehensible sound effect in these volumes.  I was watching these volumes in a multi-disc changer and the first disc of this series was started without my knowledge as I was dozing off.

Within 2 minutes I was ripped wide awake by a buzzing sound that sounded like some sort of projectile ripping across the sky of my living room.  Figuring I misheard some odd sound in the opening credits as it was amplified by half-sleep, i settled back to take a lazy look at the wrestling -- only to feel as if I was under a rocket attack as the zooming and vrooming sounds kept repeating themselves at ridiculously fast episodes.

There was no rhythm to the audio attacks -- so I didn't know what in the blue hell was going on. However, after a minute I finally realized that the WWE had slapped this awful sound effect into this otherwise-excellent 9 hour set.  Everytime a ""raw fact"" card pops up onto the screen to let the viewer know one of the million amusing facts or coincidences that are part of the cool byproduct of a 15-year continuously produced live weekly series the senses are assaulted.

I'm a pretty mellow guy, but this was really just like nails on a chalkboard.  In a mood to watch wrestling, I just had to completely give up on the half-day of what looked like excellent footage and go back to a 1999 PPV dvd of Rock Bottom: In your house that I won at WWE NY long ago.

Hopefully they decided to let the matches' sound just speak for themselves.

Anyway, if i were you, I'd try to listen to 10 or so minutes of this on surround sound or at least a real TV so you can hear how annoying this sound effect is.  It definitely fatally compromised my ability to enjoy this product.",1233014400,2,1741,4.37888198757764
2958438,5,B000VXWK8Q,"This 4-Disc DVD set is absolutely some of the best moments on the WWE's flagship show, Monday Night Raw, which has gone through a few name changes since January 1993 (Monday Night Raw, Raw Is War/The War Zone and just plain Raw). The first wrestling show to declare itself ""Uncooked, Uncensored and Uncut,"" this DVD set includes some of the top Superstars to come through the WWE over the years. The first episode featured two Superstars who are STILL going strong in WWE 15 years later, The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels. Other Superstars featured include John Cena, Triple HHH, Marty Jannetty, ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, Bret ""Hitman"" Hart, The Rock, Degeneration-X, Razor Ramon, Mick Foley (in all his different guises), Chris Jericho, Kane, Kurt Angle, Randy Orton, Batista, Ric Flair, Edge, Lita, Brian Pillman and many more. Many highlights are shown featuring all these Superstars, including the McMahon family (Vince, Linda, Shane and Stephanie). The McMahons are especially featured as part of the Austin era, but their highlights do not overwhelm the production. This set has so many memories, including some more recent highlights from the last few years. I do highly recommend this set for fans of the flagship show of World Wrestling Entertainment for a great overview. 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.",1229644800,,1304,5.069767441860465
2958439,5,B000VXWK8Q,I Was extremely impressed with this 15th Anniversary DVD. I realize that not ALL of the best moments are on the DVD but a good chunk of them are and i was impressed at what they had. I personally think they should have had J.R. do the voice commentary but...whatever. It is solid from beginning to end. i personally don't like seeing the FULL match suffice to say that the entire match gives you the full effect on what happened. but lets face facts folks. we know nothing is going to happen until 20 minutes into it when the false finishers and BIG BIG moves take place so i usually like to cut to the meat and potatoes for the most part. which is what this DVD does for the matches.

2958442,4,B000VXWK8Q,"I got this DVD being a huge fan of RAW and I loved it. I liked all the clips with DX and Stone Cold and all the clips in general. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars though was because the matches. I felt that there weren't enough matches and I didn't like that It skipped the parts of the match that happened during the commercial breaks. I think seeing more matches would have given this DVD 5 stars. The matches that ARE on it though are pretty good, but overall it left me wanting more.

All together, this is a great DVD and I would recommend it for every RAW fan and WWE fan in general.",1218326400,,592,4.016949152542373
2958443,3,B000VXWK8Q,"Raw 15th Anniversary DVD Box Set

Like most of the people commenting on this set, there are so many wonderful Raw moments on this set but in the same light there are so many things missing or not even covered at some point. It leaves you feeling kinda BLAH after watching it. I think the best way to describe this set is ""incomplete"".

Disc 1 talks about the inception of the show, the early days and the people that made the first generation of Raw what it is today. If you ask me Disc 1 is the best one out of all 3. Some of the most classic Raw moments are on this disc from the first Raw, Bobby Heenan getting fired by Gorilla Monsoon and Mr. Perfect Curt Hennig defeating Ric Flair in a Loser Leaves Town Match. Disc 1 also does a great show showcasing some of the superstars of the past in Bret Hart, Curt Hennig, Marty Jannety, Razor Ramon, Vader, Ahmed Johnson, Owen Hart, British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith and others. One thing that bothers me about Disc 1 is that the original ECW invasion in 1997 right before ECW's first PPV Barely Legal was touched on but more or less was a treated like a flash in the pan. In fact, the footage that's used is actually the same footage that was used in the Rise and Fall of ECW. I just felt that this was a pretty big moment and it wasn't covered.

Disc 2 is about the Attitude Era.... and boy oh boy does it ever miss it. This disc does not cover a dang thing from 1998 to 2002. First off, this is the era of the Monday night wars and it never goes into detail on how close the WWE was to the grinder during this time but even with fighting WCW from their backs, they still had some quality shows and moments. Normally, I'd run down what this disc has but I'm still angry at this disc... SO I'M GONNA DOG THE HELL OUT OF IT! OK, first and foremost the Attitude was not all about the Austin/McMahon feud. There were several feuds and major moments throughout these years and they all take a back seat to Austin/McMahon.., YAWN. Because of this, not as many Attitude era stars are featured. Not once do you see Al Snow, the New Age Outlaws (but probably because of their current TNA status), Val Venus, the Godfather, Ken Shamrock, Hardcore and Crash Holly, Steve Blackman, Legion of Doom, the Ministry of Darkness is shown in flashes and only as the Corporate Ministry. Even the Hardy Boys, Edge and Christian and the Dudley Boyz meteoric rises to stardom are not covered or featured at all. The crazy moments regarding the Hardcore Title aren't even covered and according to this DVD the Lightweight Belt never existed either. Hell, even the Alliance and the 2001 Survivor Series aren't even covered. Oh well, at least we get the Rock and Sock Connection and the Rock! This is your Life!

The last thing I want to bring up about disc 2 is that it doesn't even talk about the Raw dedicated to Owen Hart. To this day, this is still my favorite Raw moment. It was such a surreal moment in the wrestling business and seeing the emotion and heart felt response from the superstars was REAL, no frills and in the end other than the tribute to Eddie Guerrero, none have been as special as the one to Owen. OK I'm dogging disc 2... onto disc 3

All right to be honest, Disc 3 is really no better than Disc 2. This one covers early 2003 to the present day. There are some really good moments on this one such as an Evening with the Rock or the Rock Concert in Sacramento (even though I think the Rock in his locker room and Hurricane in the closet moment was better but hey, whatever), Evolution turning on Randy Orton, Musical Chairs with Eugene is funny, Eric Bischoff becomes Raw GM, John Cena drafted #1 to Raw and the Y2J Highlight Reel that coincides with it is decent and even the return of HBK. Disc 3 is OK at best to me. I didn't hate it like Disc 2 but I didn't enjoy it as much as Disc 1.

In the end, this set feels extremely incomplete to me and obviously a lot of other people agree with me on this one. I would've expected more from a set that's supposed to be this historic but glossing over some of the best moments in WWE history really makes you go ""ugh"" at this set. To be honest, if this was a 6 DVD box set I would've been more satisfied because then maybe more could've been covered and seriously, trying to pack in 15 years into 3 discs just doesn't work. I think at best this is a decent set for nostalgia but don't go into this way high expectations because you're not going to get it. This set feels extremely rushed and it doesn't deliver the credit it deserves. Hopefully there will eventually be another RAW set in the future but for now I'd say if you love the WWE this is an OK set to have but again, don't have your hopes up too high.",1216857600,,4705,4.2396878483835
2958444,5,B000VXWK8Q,"They really hit the ball with this set. So many great moments from RAW, finally on DVD. So that means, throw out your VHS, you have 15 years worth of moments from Monday Night RAW, finally on DVD!!!!!! And the cool thing is, there is a little of everything for everyone. So, if someone likes the first couple years of RAW, disc one is definately for you. If you like the Attitude era, you will enjoy disc 2. If you are a fan of the newer era, you will definately like disc 3.",1216598400,,475,4.118279569892473

2958449,4,B000VXWK8Q,"I think this was a well put together dvd. It had alot of favorite moment's to choose from. The second disc was my favorite featuring mostly the ""Attitude Era"". I also liked the pop-ups they were fun. If you love Monday Night Raw in the WWE treat yourself to some Raw history.",1208736000,,275,4.3076923076923075
2958450,5,B000VXWK8Q,"I had read many reviews of this DVD before I bought it and they ran the gamut of emotions, so I didn't really know what to expect. But, it's 15 Years of Raw so I still shelled out the cash.

I have to disagree with the negative reviews of this set. No, the matches aren't (for the most part) in their entirety but in order to do so, WWE would have had to put out a 40 DVD set. There is enough of the matches to get the gist of what happened and I'm satisfied.

It's a 3 DVD set that is chock-full of RAW moments. You can re-live the early days, the Attitude era and the present day. No, it doesn't go 100% in-depth with every angle and storyline but it gives you enough to be fun. There's virtually no ""Wrestler Looks Back"" interviews and just gives you the moments themselves, which I like.

And contrary to popular opinion, the ""Pop-Ups"" really aren't that big of a deal. I found them to be completely inobtrusive, albeit not very informative. If you're more than a casual viewer of WWE programming, you're not going to learn much.

All in all, a great set that completely blows away the ""10th Anniversary"" DVD. Enjoy!",1205539200,2,1120,4.293838862559242
2958451,4,B000VXWK8Q,"This is a great dvd,  no question about it.  I just have one small problem with it.  They advertise the McMahon paternity test on,  not only the back of the box,  but on the back of the the case of the third dvd box.  However,  it's nowhere to be found on the dvd.  Can someone please explain that to me????  Why have it on the box or the dvd case in the first place?????",1203984000,,371,3.9054054054054053
2958452,5,B000VXWK8Q,"WOW!!

This DVD is great, much better than the 10 year aniversary.

This DVD contains extended footage from all the best RAW moments, matches, behind the scenes, etc.

The cool thing, the matches are edited, so they are fun to watch, removing the boring 10 minute sleeperholds, or fooling around outside the ring, etc.

There is a lot of stuff you didn't get on the past DVD.

This is a MUST HAVE!! Considering that the 2008 DVD of PPV sucked.",1203984000,,443,4.4875
2958453,3,B000VXWK8Q,"I have been home sick for several days, and decided to try and make the best of it by watching all three discs of this set. The first disc is pretty good, but the other two were big letdowns. First, let me acknowledge the obvious - it's impossible to put together a DVD set about Raw that captures everything. Of course they're going to leave out some stuff. The problem was that far too much time is spent on the McMahons.

Yes, some of the show's huge moments are here - 1-2-3 Kid upsetting Razor Ramon, ECW ""invasion,"" the purchase of WCW, Foley's first title victory, The Rock's ""This Is Your Life,"" Y2J's debut, etc. So in terms of covering their history, WWE did a good job.

However, while I don't have much bad to say about disc one (though the Macho-Crush ""summit"" might have been nice to see), disc two was where things started to get bad. This covered 1998-2002, the whole attitude era. Yet pretty much half of this disc is all Vince-Austin. I know this was obviously a huge angle, but it got way too much attention here. They showed tons of Austin-Vince moments - in their entirety - which took up a lot of time, and got to be a little repetitive. Meanwhile, characters who were major parts of the whole ""attitude"" era - Val Venis, The Godfather - were left out altogether. And disc three wasn't much better.

I know some of the other reviews on here were critical of the matches being edited down. Well, they should have edited the segments down as well. Lame, boring segments (inlcuding the Edge-Lita wedding, where you can clearly hear fans chant ""boring"") are shown in their entirety, and go on forever. More examples include DX impersonating Vince and Shane, Stone Cold giving stunners to the entire McMahon family, and musical chairs with Eugene.

Some of this is good for a trip down memory lane, but I can't give it a very enthusiastic recommendation.",1203897600,,1871,4.559523809523809
2958454,4,B000VXWK8Q,"You know, I could go on a website dedicated to leprosy victims and there will be less complaining than what you people have done. I guess when you have A.D.D., pop-ups can be pretty distracting.

Anyway, I am happy with this DVD set. Sure there are moments/matches I would have liked to see on there and moments/matches that shouldn't have been; but you can't please everybody.

I was surprised to open it up and see the Very First Episode of Raw, which, besides Rob Bartlett's horrible commentating, was very nostalgic.
I would have liked to have seen, however, the first anniversary episode of RAW, which was the first live event I attended. Or at least footage from it.

RAW came out during the time I became a wrestling fan, so Disc One brought out a lot of good memories. It definitely had the best quality of matches. The Ric Flair/Mr. Perfect, Shawn Michaels/Marty Jannety, Bret Hart/1,2,3, Kid, Owen Hart/British Bulldog matches are worth the money alone.

Disc Two compresses the Attitude Era into three hours and did a decent job doing so. I was never a big fan of this paticular epoch, but this disc was very entertaining. Expect to see more memorable moments than classic matches.

Disc Three was better than the second but not as good as the first. Shawn Michaels, who was pretty much absent from Disc Two, comes back and put on some great matches for this disc. Including classic with Kurt Angle, Shelton Benjamin (the future) and Edge. It was only fitting that this set ended with the ""Return of Shawn Michaels"". Who, along with the Undertaker, are the only two remaining ""superstars"" that were on the first RAW.

Like a lot of people pointed out, the box included moments that the DVD itself didn't have. Common sense should chalk that up to an obvious typo, but like Voltaire said, ""Common sense is not so common"".

Overall, I'm very pleased with this DVD set. Sure, it's not perfect, but the WWE can't read the mind's of every WWE fan. I prefer the ""New Generation"" Era where most people would rather see the Attitude Era. Everyone isn't going to get what they want. Get used to it, I have.

Thanks, Vince.",1202169600,2,2124,4.645333333333333
2958455,3,B000VXWK8Q,"This is a very good collection of highlights from Raw's run and will pacify WWE fans with its inexpensive price, but this can hardly be considered a definitive collection.

While it gives the fan a warm feeling to see some of these moments again in (largely) unedited form, the DVD sacrifices a lot of really excellent matches for 'segments', some of which are just stupid. (Did anyone really need to see Mean Street Posse VS. The Stooges, or Musical Chairs with Eugene?).

The few matches that are picked are good, but seem totally random.  Perhaps in the future a 'Best Matches' Compilation can be released.

BTW, while some fans have complained about segments being edited or about the pop-ups, I did not find either to be a major distraction.  With this collection being over 9 hours, there is only so much footage that can be shown, and frankly, I didn't find it obvious what was edited and what wasn't.",1202169600,,908,4.685534591194968
2958456,4,B000VXWK8Q,"I thought this set was done fairly well. A lot of reviewers didn't like the pop-ups that tell little facts during the matches/clips. This didn't bother that much at all. What did bother me was that on the back on this set, it mentions certain moments that are not on the actual DVDs! Wtf? There was no Vince McMahon paternity test, and no Big Show choke slamming The Undertaker through the ring, both of which are mentioned on the back on the set! Also, there are some moments that seemed to be skipped through that I would have liked to see, and a lot of the later years stuff on disc 3 pretty much sucked. But then again, its still pretty cool to have a lot of the classic raw moments all together, as well as the very first episode of raw as a bonus disc (Yeah, I bought mine at Wal-Mart, and I'm not sure if this edition has that bonus disc with it.) Anyway, despite a few complaints, I did enjoy this collection, and I feel its definitely worth having if you're into wrestling.",1200355200,,982,4.28494623655914

Once you get to disc three, its almost as if they wanted to hurry up to get to the WWE days so they wouldnt have to blurr out the WWF logos anymore, it suddenly jumps from having a few events per year, to only two events per year, almost missing out 2006 altogether.

Its worth it for the old stuff, the attitude era and mcmahon vs austin, but do NOT throw out your old 'Best of Raw' series if you have it on DVD.  The original release is uncensored and done way better, more flow and it actually follows the storylines through including PPV footage, not just random clips.

Oh, another thing, the 'Original ECW Invasion' segment is the same old segment found on the McMahon DVD.  no full matches for that.",1200268800,4,883,4.232142857142857
2958458,5,B000VXWK8Q,"A number of negative reviews here on Amazon nearly scared me away from purchasing this DVD set, but after finding it at Walmart for $19 (with a bonus 4th disc containing the very first episode of RAW), I just couldn't pass this collection up.

I'm glad I purchased it, because it is easily one of my very favorite WWE releases to date. The three main discs span nearly ten hours, highlighting what I'd guess to be over a hundred of RAW's very greatest moments. With nearly two thousand hours worth of RAW (750+ episodes) in the bag already, of course a single set isn't going to have everything that every person wants. But it's a damn good start.

Yes, a few of the matches are clipped (not all by any stretch of the imagination though), and yes, there are pop-ups (not even close to as intrusive as some other posters would suggest -- and actually quite informative if you don't live in the fantasy world where every person who picks up this DVD is a 40 year hardcore fan with a lifetime subscription to the Wrestling Observer; overall though, this set is just an absolute GOLD MINE of fun, memorable, relevant clips.

2958459,5,B000VXWK8Q,"Having been a wrestling fan since the late 1980's, I have always enjoyed the new innovations that WWF/WWE brought about. Their weekly television show, RAW, is a perfect example. I'm not going to deal with the complaints of other reviewers. For me, match clipping doesn't bother me as much, as long as the gist of the match remains. The Bret Hart/1-2-3 Kid match was one I had never seen before, and the big highlight in my mind of this set. Yes, there are occasional pop-up's, but I think they helped explain things that newer people wouldn't have known was the current storyline going on. I see this as a good thing, because I had forgotten some things too.

Highlights in my mind is the above-mentioned match, the Owen Hart/British Bulldog match for the European Title, the Original ECW invasion, something I greatly enjoyed at its time, DX Special Report, Bang 3:16, Y2J, Rock: This Is Your Life, Milk-o-Mania, Musical Chairs with Eugene, & Michaels/Angle Iron Man Match.

I thoroughly enjoyed this collection, since I had watched Raw since it's beginnings, so it offered great nostalgia. I hope they do the same when Smackdown reaches a big milestone. Give this collection a try, and don't base your opinion on what other reviewers have complained about. I have a feeling many of them aren't life-long wrestling fans, but jumped on more recently. Enjoy the collection. Good job with this one WWE. Looking forward to the Stone Cold Steve Austin DVD set.",1199318400,,1456,4.843373493975903

If all you want is to SEE the history of raw then this would be a great buy but if you're like me and want untouched footage to add to your collection you should just save your money and hope they release the footage in other compilations.

I enjoy the Bret Hart/123 Kid match, Marty Jannetty/Shawn Michaels match, and Bulldog/Owen match. Disc 2 didn't have any match memorable. Disc 3 had 4 matches that I enjoy. So overall it's a must own for any new or old fans. I assume the pop-ups were for the new fans who didn't know. I know some of us get annoy by those because we have been watching wrestling like forever and just go, ""what else is new?"" But I wasn't annoy by it.

Year, it brought back great memories, but its hard to watch when the matches don't flow because they are clipped to death! The pop-ups are VERY distracting also..! What could have been a great set was runied by the dvd presentation...IF WWE starts making more sets based on this dvd presentation, then their sales will start dropping! I did like the fact that they made it a box set with 3 slimline dvd cases for the discs, but for me the content on the discs and the way its presented is the most important thing!..",1198713600,4,756,4.293706293706293

It's mostly filled with information you already know if you are a hardcore fan. I'd much rather just watch Shawn Michaels wrestle Marty Jannetty than be told it was the 1993 PWI Match of the Year. I guess they were trying to fill in some backstory for fans that didn't know but use your host for that when introducing the segments. But I guess asking Todd Grisham to provide useful information was asking too much. As far as the matches go, most of them are clipped. If you weren't going to show the full match why even bother including it in the set. I agree with another reviewer who said he'd pay more to see the full matches on extra discs. Flair/Mr. Perfect was almost unwatchable and Undertaker/Mankind didn't even have consistent editing. It would do a jump cut for one commercial break and fade out and back in for another. Very irritating. This set had so much potential but again the presentaion is awful. Come on WWE, we know you can do better.",1198540800,10,1119,4.463414634146342

HBK VS Owen boom edited alot..In this day an age of DVDs its all about showing complete versions of shows..An this DVD killed the concept out right. I would glady pay more for a set if they had to include another dvd or two to make the matches complete.

2958467,5,B000VXWK8Q,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2015

Monday Night RAW has been the show that defined sports entertainment over the past 15 years now. On WWE's second attempt to celebrate an anniversary of this show (the first one was RAW X which sucked), they got it right by acknowledging most of the historic moments in this show.

Some memories are shown in full while some were just recaps & highlights (like the ECW invasion was the same chapter they showed in the ECW documentary while the DX invasion of WCW was the same Confidential piece from before with the interview segments removed). Also in this set, you'll get popups of additional information regarding the superstars involved. Also since it advertises on the box (along with pictures) of Big Show chokeslamming Undertaker through the ring & Hornswoggle being Vince McMahon's son...they aren't on here.

You already have a list of what moments from RAW to expect on this DVD so I won't repeat but here are the matches on this set:

Mr. Perfect vs. Ric Flair - The loser of this match had to leave WWE as Flair got the advantage early whipping Perfect so hard into the corner that he ended up hitting his head on the post on the way down cutting Perfect on the forehead causing Flair to target the head using tactics that's earned him the name ""the dirtiest player in the game"" while Perfect got more aggressive with harder strikes & using Flair's trademark offense against him in a competitive match that was only more entertaining by Bobby Heenan's bias commentary.

[Raw The Beginning: Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

Razor Ramon vs. The Kid - All I can say is don't take a bathroom break here as you'll miss what is still considered to be one of the biggest upsets in not just RAW but probably WRESTLING history here.
May '93
[Raw The Beginning: Best Of Seasons 1 & 2; The Kliq Rules]

Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Marty Jannetty - Shawn issued an open challenge earlier in the night to be accepted by his former Rockers' partner Marty Jannetty as this match started out at a fast pace with Marty staying a step ahead & constantly taking Shawn to the outside to the point where he tried to leave but was unable to before he caught a break with Shawn focusing on the throat area in a highly competitive match that not only resulted in a first for RAW but also voted as the Match Of The Year.
May '93
[Raw The Beginning: Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

WWE Champion Bret Hart vs. 1-2-3 Kid - Bret was in the middle of his second WWE Championship reign in which he took on all challengers including this one from the Kid who was a different type of opponent than usual as he showcased his superior quickness along with a diverse style of chain wrestling & martial arts with Bret resorting to different tactics such as grounding Kid working over areas of the neck & stomach as they traded momentum with Kid delivering impactful moves such as a powerbomb & continuing to deliver different styles of kicks along with an aerial assault that at times ""crashed & burned"" only for Bret to be able to block & avoid Kid at times with this being one of the classic encounters in the early history of the program showing sportsmanship to each other & receiving respect to the point where they received standing ovations.
July '94
[Raw The Beginning: Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

Shawn Michaels vs. Owen Hart - This was Shawn's second match back after his out of the ring attack a month earlier returning only the night earlier at Survivor Series with both men going for quick near falls early only with both men sending the other over the top to the outside as Shawn left his feet on more than one occasion to take Owen down but this was ultimately about Owen executing one move & the impact that it had which left everyone speechless.
Nov. '95

No Holds Barred: Undertaker vs. Mankind - This was set to be the final encounter in this feud between both men that's been going on throughout the year as this started out as a brawl around ringside with each man using the environment around them from the steel steps to the guardrail & announce table along with other weapons such as a chair to their advantage using them to heavily focus on a specific body part of their opponent as this match resembled what their entire series of matches throughout the year was in one word...physical.
Dec. '96

European Championship Match: Owen Hart vs. British Bulldog - This was the tournament finals in the country of Germany for the first new (active) championship introduced in close to 20 years with both Owen & Bulldog being current tag team championship partners.  Both men had a series of counters & reversals early on while continuing to show respect towards each other before Bulldog was able to gain control using his power & focusing on the arm before Owen resorted to dirty tactics & using Bulldog's momentum against him on more than one occasion while working over the midsection with them continuing to go back & forth with different counters using variations of the same offense against each other in what was a very scientific encounter.
Mar. '97
[Hart & Soul: The Hart Family Anthology; Owen: Hart Of Gold]

Flag Match: Steve Austin, Dude Love, Undertaker vs. Hart Foundation - This match was joined in progress & held in Canada with the Harts were the heavy fan favorites here as this had a mix of wrestling & brawling with both teams trading momentum throughout the contest with it ultimately coming down a man everyone forgot about being the difference maker.
July '97
[Hart & Soul: The Hart Family Anthology]

No Disqualification Match: WWE Champion The Rock vs. Mankind - The Rock had The Corporation at ringside while Mankind was declared an ""honorary"" member of D-Generation X as they were in his corner for this match as both men started fighting on the outside with The Rock using the steps on Mankind's back before sandwiching his head between the steps & floor then slamming the other steps on his head. Both men made their way to the commentary table with both giving their ""play by play"" before Rock took advantage with the Rock Bottom through a table & using the ring bell as well. Rock continued to use whatever he could get his hands on such as the WWE Title only for Foley to counter & have it come back to bite The Rock as The Corporation would finally get involved resulting in the big brawl with DX with one more observer making his presence felt leading to a moment that was not only big in the career of Mick Foley but also WWE as Monday Night RAW would never get lower ratings than WCW Monday Nitro after this night.
Jan. '99
[Mick Foley: Greatest Hits & Misses; Blu-Ray Edition of Monday Night War Volume 1: Shots Fired]

Pat Patterson & Gerald Brisco vs. Mean Street Posse - The losers of this match would be forced to leave WWE as the Posse attacked the Stooges on the outside helping them get a numbers advantage only for the Stooges to come back & play dirty themselves in a short but very entertaining match to the point where this was one of the highest rated segments in the history of RAW.
May '99

WWE Champion Triple H vs. Chris Jericho - Jericho was able to manipulate Triple H into making this a championship match before revealing that his hired the A.P.A. as insurance while Shane & Stephanie McMahon were also at ringside.  Jericho was able to stay one stay one step ahead early using Triple H's momentum against him before Triple H caught him & slowed down the pace working over Jericho with brawling tactics pushing the limits of a potential disqualification as Jericho was able to counter not only moves by Triple H but tactics attempted by the McMahon's at ringside before Triple H decided to focus his aggression on someone else that would eventually come back to haunt him with an aftermath that was never before ""seen"" in the history of WWE up to that point.
Apr. '00
[Breaking The Code: Behind The Walls Of Chris Jericho]

Shawn Michaels vs. Shelton Benjamin - This was the opening round of a ""Gold Rush Tournament"" to determine the new #1 contender to the World Championship as both men went back & forth early with chain wrestling with Shelton showing superior wrestling skills & speed causing HBK to get frustrated & get more physical causing Shelton to turn up the intensity as well matching each other move for move with series of pin counters & reversals resulting in stalemates in what was a very athletic & intense match with one of the most memorable finishers in RAW history to the point where they used it in the opening video for the show for years.
May '02
[Wrestling's Highest Flyers]

Iron Man Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle - Each man had a previous victory over each other (WrestleMania 21 & Vengeance ;05) leading this match with a 30 minute time limit.  Shawn started very fast paced going for quick pins using high risk maneuvers & Angle's own momentum against him before Angle singled out a specific part of Shawn's body heavily working it over in different areas of the ring from the mat to outside & off the top rope with both men trading momentum with Angle continuing to be ruthless & more aggressive focusing on that body part & dissecting another one to the point where HBK was showing effects but continued to counter & reverse Angle's offense into his own in what exact what you expected based off their previous matches in that it was a physical classic wrestling clinic.
Oct. '05

WWE Champion Rob Van Dam vs. John Cena vs. Edge - Edge was the odd man out here as he had his issues with both men causing them to take turns getting their shots on Edge until he was a non-factor leading to Cena & RVD squaring off before Edge came back into play where Cena targeted Edge on the outside allowing RVD to capitalize with Cena distracted. There were some unique moments involving all 3 men in the ring such as a top rope crossbody onto one one man while he was in air for a vertical suplex, two men working together to take out one before turning on & taking each other out, Cena hitting an F.U. on everyone in sight, and one man stealing the win resulting in a very solid triple threat match.
July '06
[Edge: Decade Of Decadence]

Street Fight Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Edge - This was the second street fight between these men on RAW with the first one happening two years earlier. During this time, Randy Orton & Edge teamed together to form ""Rated RKO"" in an effort to take out D-Generation X and they already accomplished half of that with Triple H being out of action due to injury. This was a different Shawn than we were used to at the time because he was all business & serious from the start as he used his belt & a trash can in the early moments while other weapons like steel steps, a ladder, a biker chain would come into play with Edge also taking a hard chair shot. Both men were heavily bleeding in this match that can only really be described in two words: physically intense.
Jan. '07
[You Think You Know Me: The Story Of Edge]

Now it's obvious that some moments will not be included in here for one reason or another (Chris Benoit) & there are some questionable choices for what is (Big Boss Man?) & isn't included (no Owen Hart or Eddie tributes?) but if you can get past that factor, the positives of moments & matches outweigh the negatives so this is a DVD that a fan of WWE could enjoy.",1198022400,,11335,4.519024390243902

First for the ppl wanting to know, YES the DX Nation parody is in full, and does feature the Owen Hart part of the segment, unlike being edited out in past dvd releases.  All the segments on the set are in FULL.  If your a fan of RAW in 2007 and or a fan of the older 1993 RAW, you can't go wring with this set. The packaging is pretty neat as well.  the dvd's are in 3 slim dvd cases all with covers and info.  the front of the box its self is 3D like.",1197936000,3,558,3.7264957264957266

3192908,5,B000VXWK8Q,"I was at a local store (cant say it on Amazon but some reviewers can) and I noticed this lone dvd sitting on the shelf. It was nowheres else but in that one spot. I picked it up and was so excited and it even contained a bonus dvd with the full first epsiode of Raw! Its an awesome dvd set and has alot of unforgetable moments. The only thing I thought they could have done without is the popup information that comes on the screen every now and then. It would have been cool as an extra feature but it was annoying in some areas. The WWE released four- three disc sets in the last half of the year-Ladder matches, Rey Mysterio, Shawn Michaels, John Cena, and this dvd. All the dvds except Cena is worth it and I really hope WWE keeps the trend of three dvd sets coming in 2008. I know Stone Cold's set is on the way. I did notice some moments missing but not every dvd set can be perfect. They did not show any Beniot footage which was understandable but this set leaves a door open for more of the Best of Raw dvd sets in the near future. The set is nine hours and awesome, there is alot of footage left to show.",1196985600,9,1114,4.04524886877828

3192919,5,B000VXWK8Q,"I wanted to address a few concerns that were posted by others earlier. Their comments almost caused me not to buy the DVD, but I'm glad that I went ahead and bought it.

To address a couple of things:

1)The pop-ups aren't intrusive at all, and in fact, they're not plentiful.

There are maybe three pop ups that come up during each segment, and they are just off to the bottom right side, and I barely even notice them. They don't cover the screen, and they don't make a big noise from what I remember. You can easily just ignore them. It's a complete non-issue for me. I'm relieved, because I thought they'd be a much bigger deal, based on what some people here were saying. The main thing to remember is that they barely even happen during each segment. From the way some here made it sound, I thought it'd be a constant thing. It's not AT ALL.

2)The matches ARE here in their entirety, at least the matches that I've watched so far (Shawn Michaels vs. Edge Street Fight; Shawn Michaels vs. Shelton Benjamin RAW; Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle Iron Man Match; Edge vs. Rob Van Dam vs. John Cena Triple Threat Match).

I cannot vouch for every single match, as I haven't watched them all yet, but I assume they're all here in their entirety, since that was the case with every single match that I happened to watch.

I think that what is confusing people is that these were TV matches, therefore they went to commercials during these matches. When that happens, they simply just come back straight away from the commercial break. This is the same with EVERY WWE release of tv matches. Therefore this DVD is no different, and there is NOTHING edited out except for the commercials. You're not missing anything you didn't miss on tv, or on any other dvd release that contains tv matches. The matches are full and complete.

In summary:

I have to say that this was a great buy, especially because you get so many great moments for a good price. I put the third disc in, not expecting to watch it all. I was just going to skip around to the stuff that I bought the set for, but ended up watching the entire disc, and enjoyed pretty much every second of it.

It's a breezy, fun, watch, and contains some great matches, and some of RAW's most fun and notable moments.

I'd definitely recommend buying this!",1388707200,8,2303,4.448931116389549
3192920,3,B000VXWK8Q,"I got this for my 10yr old son as a ""history"" of RAW for him.  Its may just be me but I remember more/better moments than whats on here!  For nostalgia purposes or to introduce a younger fan to RAW its not bad though.",1387670400,,217,3.909090909090909
3192921,3,B000VXWK8Q,"I ordered a used copy of this title for around $1.70. It was shipped via US Mail (snail mail), and took forever to arrive. This is the Christmas season, and all mail is likely slowed down.

I usually watch all my DVDs on my Mac computers. I usually ""rip"" the DVDs so I can watch them without handling the discs themselves. The DVDs played fine on the computers. I was shocked when they would not play on my regular DVD player, attached to my TV. I tried another WWE DVD title with the DVD player & it worked just fine!

This isn't a major problem for me. It would be a problem for my Dad. I love to send my Dad some WWE DVDs as a surprise disc. Dad prefers to watch videos on his TV, with a DVD player.

The audio & video quality of the videos is just fine. There's a nice selection to watch. I'm watching it now, on my TV, using the Roku 3 attached to a USB hard drive.",1387670400,,870,3.9885057471264367

Overall I found this set to be enjoyable and a nice trip down memory lane(especially disc 2, 1998-2002). But it is really difficult to adequately cover 15 years of history even in a three disc set.

Each 5 year period could have it's own 3-disc set. As it is, this set barely scratches the surface of all the history of Raw. Still a fun watch and nice to re-live the memories.",1361059200,,523,4.381443298969073

3192929,3,B000VXWK8Q,"The WWE was in a no win position here because on one hand if they put full matches on here, there would need to be a couple more disks, which would've increased price. By clipping down matches you get three disks, but a rightfully angered fan base who spent hard earned money on this set. Personally, I would rather have complete matches That being said, the selection of what constitues Best particularly on the disks for the Attitude Era and beyond is a little underwhelming Mean Street Posse v. Patterson & Brisco was not a best moment for me at least and even some of the bigger moments are clipped down. But there's no way to accomadate everyone's taste because if they release full season sets of RAW to get complete matches i'm not sure i'd have the patience to sit through all the bad stuff to gleam the few gems.",1275091200,,821,4.443708609271523

3192931,3,B000VXWK8Q,"Purchased this for Christmas, with great expectations, as I've seen most of the shows over the 15 years. While there are many memorable moments on this 3 disc set, there are some truly forgettable! Mean Street Posse, Big Bossman Sympathy & Musical Chairs with Eugene are some lowlights. There are some great matches, some very funny & shocking moments, the majority provided by Stone Cold & The Rock. There are many great matches from Shawn Michaels on this set, however he comes across as the golden boy of WWE as he's shown in 6 matches and many promos, where as many other superstars are not shown at all or nearly as much! No Randy Savage or Hulk, OK there best was probably before this but surely there must've been something of note. Nothing shown on the nation of domination. Also disappointing that there are no extras on any of the 3 discs.

3192934,1,B000VXWK8Q,"this vote is strictly based on the inclusion of an incomprehensible sound effect in these volumes.  I was watching these volumes in a multi-disc changer and the first disc of this series was started without my knowledge as I was dozing off.

Within 2 minutes I was ripped wide awake by a buzzing sound that sounded like some sort of projectile ripping across the sky of my living room.  Figuring I misheard some odd sound in the opening credits as it was amplified by half-sleep, i settled back to take a lazy look at the wrestling -- only to feel as if I was under a rocket attack as the zooming and vrooming sounds kept repeating themselves at ridiculously fast episodes.

There was no rhythm to the audio attacks -- so I didn't know what in the blue hell was going on. However, after a minute I finally realized that the WWE had slapped this awful sound effect into this otherwise-excellent 9 hour set.  Everytime a ""raw fact"" card pops up onto the screen to let the viewer know one of the million amusing facts or coincidences that are part of the cool byproduct of a 15-year continuously produced live weekly series the senses are assaulted.

I'm a pretty mellow guy, but this was really just like nails on a chalkboard.  In a mood to watch wrestling, I just had to completely give up on the half-day of what looked like excellent footage and go back to a 1999 PPV dvd of Rock Bottom: In your house that I won at WWE NY long ago.

Hopefully they decided to let the matches' sound just speak for themselves.

Anyway, if i were you, I'd try to listen to 10 or so minutes of this on surround sound or at least a real TV so you can hear how annoying this sound effect is.  It definitely fatally compromised my ability to enjoy this product.",1233014400,2,1741,4.37888198757764

Many highlights are shown featuring all these Superstars, including the McMahon family (Vince, Linda, Shane and Stephanie). The McMahons are especially featured as part of the Austin era, but their highlights do not overwhelm the production.

I realize that not ALL of the best moments are on the DVD but a good chunk of them are and i was impressed at what they had. I personally think they should have had J.R. do the voice commentary but...whatever. It is solid from beginning to end. i personally don't like seeing the FULL match suffice to say that the entire match gives you the full effect on what happened. but lets face facts folks. we know nothing is going to happen until 20 minutes into it when the false finishers and BIG BIG moves take place so i usually like to cut to the meat and potatoes for the most part. which is what this DVD does for the matches.

3192939,4,B000VXWK8Q,"I got this DVD being a huge fan of RAW and I loved it. I liked all the clips with DX and Stone Cold and all the clips in general. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars though was because the matches. I felt that there weren't enough matches and I didn't like that It skipped the parts of the match that happened during the commercial breaks. I think seeing more matches would have given this DVD 5 stars. The matches that ARE on it though are pretty good, but overall it left me wanting more.

All together, this is a great DVD and I would recommend it for every RAW fan and WWE fan in general.",1218326400,,592,4.016949152542373
3192940,3,B000VXWK8Q,"Raw 15th Anniversary DVD Box Set

Like most of the people commenting on this set, there are so many wonderful Raw moments on this set but in the same light there are so many things missing or not even covered at some point. It leaves you feeling kinda BLAH after watching it. I think the best way to describe this set is ""incomplete"".

Disc 1 talks about the inception of the show, the early days and the people that made the first generation of Raw what it is today. If you ask me Disc 1 is the best one out of all 3. Some of the most classic Raw moments are on this disc from the first Raw, Bobby Heenan getting fired by Gorilla Monsoon and Mr. Perfect Curt Hennig defeating Ric Flair in a Loser Leaves Town Match. Disc 1 also does a great show showcasing some of the superstars of the past in Bret Hart, Curt Hennig, Marty Jannety, Razor Ramon, Vader, Ahmed Johnson, Owen Hart, British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith and others. One thing that bothers me about Disc 1 is that the original ECW invasion in 1997 right before ECW's first PPV Barely Legal was touched on but more or less was a treated like a flash in the pan. In fact, the footage that's used is actually the same footage that was used in the Rise and Fall of ECW. I just felt that this was a pretty big moment and it wasn't covered.

Disc 2 is about the Attitude Era.... and boy oh boy does it ever miss it. This disc does not cover a dang thing from 1998 to 2002. First off, this is the era of the Monday night wars and it never goes into detail on how close the WWE was to the grinder during this time but even with fighting WCW from their backs, they still had some quality shows and moments. Normally, I'd run down what this disc has but I'm still angry at this disc... SO I'M GONNA DOG THE HELL OUT OF IT! OK, first and foremost the Attitude was not all about the Austin/McMahon feud. There were several feuds and major moments throughout these years and they all take a back seat to Austin/McMahon.., YAWN. Because of this, not as many Attitude era stars are featured. Not once do you see Al Snow, the New Age Outlaws (but probably because of their current TNA status), Val Venus, the Godfather, Ken Shamrock, Hardcore and Crash Holly, Steve Blackman, Legion of Doom, the Ministry of Darkness is shown in flashes and only as the Corporate Ministry. Even the Hardy Boys, Edge and Christian and the Dudley Boyz meteoric rises to stardom are not covered or featured at all. The crazy moments regarding the Hardcore Title aren't even covered and according to this DVD the Lightweight Belt never existed either. Hell, even the Alliance and the 2001 Survivor Series aren't even covered. Oh well, at least we get the Rock and Sock Connection and the Rock! This is your Life!

The last thing I want to bring up about disc 2 is that it doesn't even talk about the Raw dedicated to Owen Hart. To this day, this is still my favorite Raw moment. It was such a surreal moment in the wrestling business and seeing the emotion and heart felt response from the superstars was REAL, no frills and in the end other than the tribute to Eddie Guerrero, none have been as special as the one to Owen. OK I'm dogging disc 2... onto disc 3

All right to be honest, Disc 3 is really no better than Disc 2. This one covers early 2003 to the present day. There are some really good moments on this one such as an Evening with the Rock or the Rock Concert in Sacramento (even though I think the Rock in his locker room and Hurricane in the closet moment was better but hey, whatever), Evolution turning on Randy Orton, Musical Chairs with Eugene is funny, Eric Bischoff becomes Raw GM, John Cena drafted #1 to Raw and the Y2J Highlight Reel that coincides with it is decent and even the return of HBK. Disc 3 is OK at best to me. I didn't hate it like Disc 2 but I didn't enjoy it as much as Disc 1.

In the end, this set feels extremely incomplete to me and obviously a lot of other people agree with me on this one. I would've expected more from a set that's supposed to be this historic but glossing over some of the best moments in WWE history really makes you go ""ugh"" at this set. To be honest, if this was a 6 DVD box set I would've been more satisfied because then maybe more could've been covered and seriously, trying to pack in 15 years into 3 discs just doesn't work. I think at best this is a decent set for nostalgia but don't go into this way high expectations because you're not going to get it. This set feels extremely rushed and it doesn't deliver the credit it deserves. Hopefully there will eventually be another RAW set in the future but for now I'd say if you love the WWE this is an OK set to have but again, don't have your hopes up too high.",1216857600,,4705,4.2396878483835

So, if someone likes the first couple years of RAW, disc one is definately for you. If you like the Attitude era, you will enjoy disc 2. If you are a fan of the newer era, you will definately like disc 3.",1216598400,,475,4.118279569892473

3192947,5,B000VXWK8Q,"I had read many reviews of this DVD before I bought it and they ran the gamut of emotions, so I didn't really know what to expect. But, it's 15 Years of Raw so I still shelled out the cash.

I have to disagree with the negative reviews of this set. No, the matches aren't (for the most part) in their entirety but in order to do so, WWE would have had to put out a 40 DVD set. There is enough of the matches to get the gist of what happened and I'm satisfied.

It's a 3 DVD set that is chock-full of RAW moments. You can re-live the early days, the Attitude era and the present day. No, it doesn't go 100% in-depth with every angle and storyline but it gives you enough to be fun. There's virtually no ""Wrestler Looks Back"" interviews and just gives you the moments themselves, which I like.

And contrary to popular opinion, the ""Pop-Ups"" really aren't that big of a deal. I found them to be completely inobtrusive, albeit not very informative. If you're more than a casual viewer of WWE programming, you're not going to learn much.

All in all, a great set that completely blows away the ""10th Anniversary"" DVD. Enjoy!",1205539200,2,1120,4.293838862559242

They advertise the McMahon paternity test on,  not only the back of the box,  but on the back of the the case of the third dvd box.  However,  it's nowhere to be found on the dvd.  Can someone please explain that to me????  Why have it on the box or the dvd case in the first place?????",1203984000,,371,3.9054054054054053
3192949,5,B000VXWK8Q,"WOW!!

This DVD is great, much better than the 10 year aniversary.

This DVD contains extended footage from all the best RAW moments, matches, behind the scenes, etc.

The cool thing, the matches are edited, so they are fun to watch, removing the boring 10 minute sleeperholds, or fooling around outside the ring, etc.

There is a lot of stuff you didn't get on the past DVD.

This is a MUST HAVE!! Considering that the 2008 DVD of PPV sucked.",1203984000,,443,4.4875
3192950,3,B000VXWK8Q,"I have been home sick for several days, and decided to try and make the best of it by watching all three discs of this set. The first disc is pretty good, but the other two were big letdowns. First, let me acknowledge the obvious - it's impossible to put together a DVD set about Raw that captures everything. Of course they're going to leave out some stuff. The problem was that far too much time is spent on the McMahons.

Yes, some of the show's huge moments are here - 1-2-3 Kid upsetting Razor Ramon, ECW ""invasion,"" the purchase of WCW, Foley's first title victory, The Rock's ""This Is Your Life,"" Y2J's debut, etc. So in terms of covering their history, WWE did a good job.

However, while I don't have much bad to say about disc one (though the Macho-Crush ""summit"" might have been nice to see), disc two was where things started to get bad. This covered 1998-2002, the whole attitude era. Yet pretty much half of this disc is all Vince-Austin. I know this was obviously a huge angle, but it got way too much attention here. They showed tons of Austin-Vince moments - in their entirety - which took up a lot of time, and got to be a little repetitive. Meanwhile, characters who were major parts of the whole ""attitude"" era - Val Venis, The Godfather - were left out altogether. And disc three wasn't much better.

I know some of the other reviews on here were critical of the matches being edited down. Well, they should have edited the segments down as well. Lame, boring segments (inlcuding the Edge-Lita wedding, where you can clearly hear fans chant ""boring"") are shown in their entirety, and go on forever. More examples include DX impersonating Vince and Shane, Stone Cold giving stunners to the entire McMahon family, and musical chairs with Eugene.

Some of this is good for a trip down memory lane, but I can't give it a very enthusiastic recommendation.",1203897600,,1871,4.559523809523809
3192951,4,B000VXWK8Q,"You know, I could go on a website dedicated to leprosy victims and there will be less complaining than what you people have done. I guess when you have A.D.D., pop-ups can be pretty distracting.

Anyway, I am happy with this DVD set. Sure there are moments/matches I would have liked to see on there and moments/matches that shouldn't have been; but you can't please everybody.

I was surprised to open it up and see the Very First Episode of Raw, which, besides Rob Bartlett's horrible commentating, was very nostalgic.
I would have liked to have seen, however, the first anniversary episode of RAW, which was the first live event I attended. Or at least footage from it.

RAW came out during the time I became a wrestling fan, so Disc One brought out a lot of good memories. It definitely had the best quality of matches. The Ric Flair/Mr. Perfect, Shawn Michaels/Marty Jannety, Bret Hart/1,2,3, Kid, Owen Hart/British Bulldog matches are worth the money alone.

Disc Two compresses the Attitude Era into three hours and did a decent job doing so. I was never a big fan of this paticular epoch, but this disc was very entertaining. Expect to see more memorable moments than classic matches.

Disc Three was better than the second but not as good as the first. Shawn Michaels, who was pretty much absent from Disc Two, comes back and put on some great matches for this disc. Including classic with Kurt Angle, Shelton Benjamin (the future) and Edge. It was only fitting that this set ended with the ""Return of Shawn Michaels"". Who, along with the Undertaker, are the only two remaining ""superstars"" that were on the first RAW.

Like a lot of people pointed out, the box included moments that the DVD itself didn't have. Common sense should chalk that up to an obvious typo, but like Voltaire said, ""Common sense is not so common"".

Overall, I'm very pleased with this DVD set. Sure, it's not perfect, but the WWE can't read the mind's of every WWE fan. I prefer the ""New Generation"" Era where most people would rather see the Attitude Era. Everyone isn't going to get what they want. Get used to it, I have.

Thanks, Vince.",1202169600,2,2124,4.645333333333333
3192952,3,B000VXWK8Q,"This is a very good collection of highlights from Raw's run and will pacify WWE fans with its inexpensive price, but this can hardly be considered a definitive collection.

While it gives the fan a warm feeling to see some of these moments again in (largely) unedited form, the DVD sacrifices a lot of really excellent matches for 'segments', some of which are just stupid. (Did anyone really need to see Mean Street Posse VS. The Stooges, or Musical Chairs with Eugene?).

The few matches that are picked are good, but seem totally random.  Perhaps in the future a 'Best Matches' Compilation can be released.

BTW, while some fans have complained about segments being edited or about the pop-ups, I did not find either to be a major distraction.  With this collection being over 9 hours, there is only so much footage that can be shown, and frankly, I didn't find it obvious what was edited and what wasn't.",1202169600,,908,4.685534591194968
3192953,4,B000VXWK8Q,"I thought this set was done fairly well. A lot of reviewers didn't like the pop-ups that tell little facts during the matches/clips. This didn't bother that much at all. What did bother me was that on the back on this set, it mentions certain moments that are not on the actual DVDs! Wtf? There was no Vince McMahon paternity test, and no Big Show choke slamming The Undertaker through the ring, both of which are mentioned on the back on the set! Also, there are some moments that seemed to be skipped through that I would have liked to see, and a lot of the later years stuff on disc 3 pretty much sucked. But then again, its still pretty cool to have a lot of the classic raw moments all together, as well as the very first episode of raw as a bonus disc (Yeah, I bought mine at Wal-Mart, and I'm not sure if this edition has that bonus disc with it.) Anyway, despite a few complaints, I did enjoy this collection, and I feel its definitely worth having if you're into wrestling.",1200355200,,982,4.28494623655914
3192954,3,B000VXWK8Q,"When you buy a 3 Disc DVD set like this one, You would at least expect it to be uncensored, but no, it isnt, not even Stone Colds middle finger is visable in this hurried set.

Once you get to disc three, its almost as if they wanted to hurry up to get to the WWE days so they wouldnt have to blurr out the WWF logos anymore, it suddenly jumps from having a few events per year, to only two events per year, almost missing out 2006 altogether.

Its worth it for the old stuff, the attitude era and mcmahon vs austin, but do NOT throw out your old 'Best of Raw' series if you have it on DVD.  The original release is uncensored and done way better, more flow and it actually follows the storylines through including PPV footage, not just random clips.

Oh, another thing, the 'Original ECW Invasion' segment is the same old segment found on the McMahon DVD.  no full matches for that.",1200268800,4,883,4.232142857142857
3192955,5,B000VXWK8Q,"A number of negative reviews here on Amazon nearly scared me away from purchasing this DVD set, but after finding it at Walmart for $19 (with a bonus 4th disc containing the very first episode of RAW), I just couldn't pass this collection up.

I'm glad I purchased it, because it is easily one of my very favorite WWE releases to date. The three main discs span nearly ten hours, highlighting what I'd guess to be over a hundred of RAW's very greatest moments. With nearly two thousand hours worth of RAW (750+ episodes) in the bag already, of course a single set isn't going to have everything that every person wants. But it's a damn good start.

Yes, a few of the matches are clipped (not all by any stretch of the imagination though), and yes, there are pop-ups (not even close to as intrusive as some other posters would suggest -- and actually quite informative if you don't live in the fantasy world where every person who picks up this DVD is a 40 year hardcore fan with a lifetime subscription to the Wrestling Observer; overall though, this set is just an absolute GOLD MINE of fun, memorable, relevant clips.

For $20, this set is just CAN'T MISS.",1199318400,3,1158,4.504761904761905
3192956,5,B000VXWK8Q,"Having been a wrestling fan since the late 1980's, I have always enjoyed the new innovations that WWF/WWE brought about. Their weekly television show, RAW, is a perfect example. I'm not going to deal with the complaints of other reviewers. For me, match clipping doesn't bother me as much, as long as the gist of the match remains. The Bret Hart/1-2-3 Kid match was one I had never seen before, and the big highlight in my mind of this set. Yes, there are occasional pop-up's, but I think they helped explain things that newer people wouldn't have known was the current storyline going on. I see this as a good thing, because I had forgotten some things too.

Highlights in my mind is the above-mentioned match, the Owen Hart/British Bulldog match for the European Title, the Original ECW invasion, something I greatly enjoyed at its time, DX Special Report, Bang 3:16, Y2J, Rock: This Is Your Life, Milk-o-Mania, Musical Chairs with Eugene, & Michaels/Angle Iron Man Match.

I thoroughly enjoyed this collection, since I had watched Raw since it's beginnings, so it offered great nostalgia. I hope they do the same when Smackdown reaches a big milestone. Give this collection a try, and don't base your opinion on what other reviewers have complained about. I have a feeling many of them aren't life-long wrestling fans, but jumped on more recently.

So overall it's a must own for any new or old fans. I assume the pop-ups were for the new fans who didn't know. I know some of us get annoy by those because we have been watching wrestling like forever and just go, ""what else is new?"" But I wasn't annoy by it. There were some things I didn't knew and was like ""OH!"" So overall, it's worth the purchase.",1198713600,,835,4.128834355828221
3192960,2,B000VXWK8Q,"I gotta admit, i was let down also. I am a die-hard 30+ year wrestling fan. I crave dvd footage of all the great raw matches. However, while the quality of the video is A+, the fact that the matches are clipped to death is a MAJOR letdown. Year, it brought back great memories, but its hard to watch when the matches don't flow because they are clipped to death! The pop-ups are VERY distracting also..! What could have been a great set was runied by the dvd presentation...IF WWE starts making more sets based on this dvd presentation, then their sales will start dropping! I did like the fact that they made it a box set with 3 slimline dvd cases for the discs, but for me the content on the discs and the way its presented is the most important thing!..",1198713600,4,756,4.293706293706293
3192961,2,B000VXWK8Q,"Wow what a letdown. Most of the footage on this set is great but the DVD presentation ruins it. The pop up info graphics during these segments alone ruins the set. It's mostly filled with information you already know if you are a hardcore fan. I'd much rather just watch Shawn Michaels wrestle Marty Jannetty than be told it was the 1993 PWI Match of the Year. I guess they were trying to fill in some backstory for fans that didn't know but use your host for that when introducing the segments. But I guess asking Todd Grisham to provide useful information was asking too much. As far as the matches go, most of them are clipped. If you weren't going to show the full match why even bother including it in the set. I agree with another reviewer who said he'd pay more to see the full matches on extra discs. Flair/Mr. Perfect was almost unwatchable and Undertaker/Mankind didn't even have consistent editing. It would do a jump cut for one commercial break and fade out and back in for another. Very irritating. This set had so much potential but again the presentaion is awful. Come on WWE, we know you can do better.",1198540800,10,1119,4.463414634146342
3192962,2,B000VXWK8Q,I was really looking forward to this DVD..I picked it up read the back i thought it was going to be great. Popped it in an was very surpised to see some of the matches i wanted to see the most were clipped..The Flair Perfect match from 1993 was chopped to shreds. HBK VS Owen boom edited alot..In this day an age of DVDs its all about showing complete versions of shows..An this DVD killed the concept out right. I would glady pay more for a set if they had to include another dvd or two to make the matches complete. On top of all this they have these crappy (huge) popups on the screen telling you things you already know or could care less about..WWE sets back the dvd gimmick ten years with this set.,1198540800,16,704,4.1838235294117645

3192964,5,B000VXWK8Q,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2015

Monday Night RAW has been the show that defined sports entertainment over the past 15 years now. On WWE's second attempt to celebrate an anniversary of this show (the first one was RAW X which sucked), they got it right by acknowledging most of the historic moments in this show.

Some memories are shown in full while some were just recaps & highlights (like the ECW invasion was the same chapter they showed in the ECW documentary while the DX invasion of WCW was the same Confidential piece from before with the interview segments removed). Also in this set, you'll get popups of additional information regarding the superstars involved. Also since it advertises on the box (along with pictures) of Big Show chokeslamming Undertaker through the ring & Hornswoggle being Vince McMahon's son...they aren't on here.

You already have a list of what moments from RAW to expect on this DVD so I won't repeat but here are the matches on this set:

Mr. Perfect vs. Ric Flair - The loser of this match had to leave WWE as Flair got the advantage early whipping Perfect so hard into the corner that he ended up hitting his head on the post on the way down cutting Perfect on the forehead causing Flair to target the head using tactics that's earned him the name ""the dirtiest player in the game"" while Perfect got more aggressive with harder strikes & using Flair's trademark offense against him in a competitive match that was only more entertaining by Bobby Heenan's bias commentary.
Jan. '93
[Raw The Beginning: Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

Razor Ramon vs. The Kid - All I can say is don't take a bathroom break here as you'll miss what is still considered to be one of the biggest upsets in not just RAW but probably WRESTLING history here.
May '93
[Raw The Beginning: Best Of Seasons 1 & 2; The Kliq Rules]

Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Marty Jannetty - Shawn issued an open challenge earlier in the night to be accepted by his former Rockers' partner Marty Jannetty as this match started out at a fast pace with Marty staying a step ahead & constantly taking Shawn to the outside to the point where he tried to leave but was unable to before he caught a break with Shawn focusing on the throat area in a highly competitive match that not only resulted in a first for RAW but also voted as the Match Of The Year.
May '93
[Raw The Beginning: Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

WWE Champion Bret Hart vs. 1-2-3 Kid - Bret was in the middle of his second WWE Championship reign in which he took on all challengers including this one from the Kid who was a different type of opponent than usual as he showcased his superior quickness along with a diverse style of chain wrestling & martial arts with Bret resorting to different tactics such as grounding Kid working over areas of the neck & stomach as they traded momentum with Kid delivering impactful moves such as a powerbomb & continuing to deliver different styles of kicks along with an aerial assault that at times ""crashed & burned"" only for Bret to be able to block & avoid Kid at times with this being one of the classic encounters in the early history of the program showing sportsmanship to each other & receiving respect to the point where they received standing ovations.
July '94
[Raw The Beginning: Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

Shawn Michaels vs. Owen Hart - This was Shawn's second match back after his out of the ring attack a month earlier returning only the night earlier at Survivor Series with both men going for quick near falls early only with both men sending the other over the top to the outside as Shawn left his feet on more than one occasion to take Owen down but this was ultimately about Owen executing one move & the impact that it had which left everyone speechless.
Nov. '95

No Holds Barred: Undertaker vs. Mankind - This was set to be the final encounter in this feud between both men that's been going on throughout the year as this started out as a brawl around ringside with each man using the environment around them from the steel steps to the guardrail & announce table along with other weapons such as a chair to their advantage using them to heavily focus on a specific body part of their opponent as this match resembled what their entire series of matches throughout the year was in one word...physical.
Dec. '96

European Championship Match: Owen Hart vs. British Bulldog - This was the tournament finals in the country of Germany for the first new (active) championship introduced in close to 20 years with both Owen & Bulldog being current tag team championship partners.  Both men had a series of counters & reversals early on while continuing to show respect towards each other before Bulldog was able to gain control using his power & focusing on the arm before Owen resorted to dirty tactics & using Bulldog's momentum against him on more than one occasion while working over the midsection with them continuing to go back & forth with different counters using variations of the same offense against each other in what was a very scientific encounter.
Mar. '97
[Hart & Soul: The Hart Family Anthology; Owen: Hart Of Gold]

Flag Match: Steve Austin, Dude Love, Undertaker vs. Hart Foundation - This match was joined in progress & held in Canada with the Harts were the heavy fan favorites here as this had a mix of wrestling & brawling with both teams trading momentum throughout the contest with it ultimately coming down a man everyone forgot about being the difference maker.
July '97
[Hart & Soul: The Hart Family Anthology]

No Disqualification Match: WWE Champion The Rock vs. Mankind - The Rock had The Corporation at ringside while Mankind was declared an ""honorary"" member of D-Generation X as they were in his corner for this match as both men started fighting on the outside with The Rock using the steps on Mankind's back before sandwiching his head between the steps & floor then slamming the other steps on his head. Both men made their way to the commentary table with both giving their ""play by play"" before Rock took advantage with the Rock Bottom through a table & using the ring bell as well. Rock continued to use whatever he could get his hands on such as the WWE Title only for Foley to counter & have it come back to bite The Rock as The Corporation would finally get involved resulting in the big brawl with DX with one more observer making his presence felt leading to a moment that was not only big in the career of Mick Foley but also WWE as Monday Night RAW would never get lower ratings than WCW Monday Nitro after this night.
Jan. '99
[Mick Foley: Greatest Hits & Misses; Blu-Ray Edition of Monday Night War Volume 1: Shots Fired]

Pat Patterson & Gerald Brisco vs. Mean Street Posse - The losers of this match would be forced to leave WWE as the Posse attacked the Stooges on the outside helping them get a numbers advantage only for the Stooges to come back & play dirty themselves in a short but very entertaining match to the point where this was one of the highest rated segments in the history of RAW.
May '99

WWE Champion Triple H vs. Chris Jericho - Jericho was able to manipulate Triple H into making this a championship match before revealing that his hired the A.P.A. as insurance while Shane & Stephanie McMahon were also at ringside.  Jericho was able to stay one stay one step ahead early using Triple H's momentum against him before Triple H caught him & slowed down the pace working over Jericho with brawling tactics pushing the limits of a potential disqualification as Jericho was able to counter not only moves by Triple H but tactics attempted by the McMahon's at ringside before Triple H decided to focus his aggression on someone else that would eventually come back to haunt him with an aftermath that was never before ""seen"" in the history of WWE up to that point.
Apr. '00
[Breaking The Code: Behind The Walls Of Chris Jericho]

Shawn Michaels vs. Shelton Benjamin - This was the opening round of a ""Gold Rush Tournament"" to determine the new #1 contender to the World Championship as both men went back & forth early with chain wrestling with Shelton showing superior wrestling skills & speed causing HBK to get frustrated & get more physical causing Shelton to turn up the intensity as well matching each other move for move with series of pin counters & reversals resulting in stalemates in what was a very athletic & intense match with one of the most memorable finishers in RAW history to the point where they used it in the opening video for the show for years.
May '02
[Wrestling's Highest Flyers]

Iron Man Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle - Each man had a previous victory over each other (WrestleMania 21 & Vengeance ;05) leading this match with a 30 minute time limit.  Shawn started very fast paced going for quick pins using high risk maneuvers & Angle's own momentum against him before Angle singled out a specific part of Shawn's body heavily working it over in different areas of the ring from the mat to outside & off the top rope with both men trading momentum with Angle continuing to be ruthless & more aggressive focusing on that body part & dissecting another one to the point where HBK was showing effects but continued to counter & reverse Angle's offense into his own in what exact what you expected based off their previous matches in that it was a physical classic wrestling clinic.
Oct. '05

WWE Champion Rob Van Dam vs. John Cena vs. Edge - Edge was the odd man out here as he had his issues with both men causing them to take turns getting their shots on Edge until he was a non-factor leading to Cena & RVD squaring off before Edge came back into play where Cena targeted Edge on the outside allowing RVD to capitalize with Cena distracted. There were some unique moments involving all 3 men in the ring such as a top rope crossbody onto one one man while he was in air for a vertical suplex, two men working together to take out one before turning on & taking each other out, Cena hitting an F.U. on everyone in sight, and one man stealing the win resulting in a very solid triple threat match.
July '06
[Edge: Decade Of Decadence]

Street Fight Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Edge - This was the second street fight between these men on RAW with the first one happening two years earlier. During this time, Randy Orton & Edge teamed together to form ""Rated RKO"" in an effort to take out D-Generation X and they already accomplished half of that with Triple H being out of action due to injury. This was a different Shawn than we were used to at the time because he was all business & serious from the start as he used his belt & a trash can in the early moments while other weapons like steel steps, a ladder, a biker chain would come into play with Edge also taking a hard chair shot. Both men were heavily bleeding in this match that can only really be described in two words: physically intense.
Jan. '07
[You Think You Know Me: The Story Of Edge]

Now it's obvious that some moments will not be included in here for one reason or another (Chris Benoit) & there are some questionable choices for what is (Big Boss Man?) & isn't included (no Owen Hart or Eddie tributes?) but if you can get past that factor, the positives of moments & matches outweigh the negatives so this is a DVD that a fan of WWE could enjoy.",1198022400,,11335,4.519024390243902
8220494,5,B000VXWK8Q,"The show that revolutionized the business in 1993--and subsequently, inspired the boys down in Atlanta to light a fire under their butts and take it a step further; but that's a different story, I suppose. In any event, this set is chock full of great moments--lncluding a bonus disc with the entire one hour premiere of Raw. I suppose most of the great events from this period were covered. Of course, we fans will always bicker about what was or was not included on these various sets--it is what it is. And the fact that some of the matches were cut might irk some people, but in any event, it was a fun time to go back & relive the ""good old days.""

Disc 1 - Off the top of my head, maybe my favorite highlights--Gorilla throwing Bobby out of the arena, Vader going nuts, Austin 3:16 vs. Pillman 9 millimeter, and the ECW invasion. Of course, there is the ""Bret screwed Bret"" segment, but that horse has been beaten to death, so why delve into it when everyone knows what went on.

The action probably picks up a lot on Disc 2 as we get further into the attitude era. Not as many Undertaker moments as I would've liked to seen, just a personal gripe. But, those DX segments are still great--particularly the ""Nation"" parody. I don't know who the hell was playing Owen, but it worked nonetheless. And Bischoff as the Raw GM--I didn't see that coming when it actually happened, but what a moment it was. Like hell had finally frozen over--I guess no one holds a grudge forever.

I won't go into too much detail about the 3rd disc, seeing as how it's more recent & it really needs no in-depth analysis. Unlike some folks--I don't mind Kane unmasking--it probably wasn't until WM20 that the character got a bit weaker anyway when Taker returned & Kane started trembling. And if you think that's bad, you should see Kane now on Raw vs. Stroman.

In any event, a great look back at the history of Raw....",1513382400,,1902,4.441260744985673
