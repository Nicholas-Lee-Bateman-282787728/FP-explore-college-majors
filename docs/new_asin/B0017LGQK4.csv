3173588,5,B0017LGQK4,"Now, this here is the second half of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam. As far as disk presentations go, it's solid. The case is large and boxy and contains five disks rounding out to 25 Episodes, along with Collection 1 this ends up at a 50 episode series, slightly longer than the original at 46.

I prefer to relate this Anime to Angel, the spin-off of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's great, it's amazing, it contains more of your favorite characters, new interesting characters, it's a darker and more tragic story, and you really have to watch the original to get anything. Zeta Gundam has a high barrier of entry, and not everybody wants to spend 46 episodes of Original MSG to get into this.

For those who do, you'll find an anime so great, to this day it spawns endless sequels, spin-off's, merchandise, and copycats.  This is an anime that spawned a Genre, and this is the grandest representation of that genre ever conceived.

Animation wise, you'll have to realize this was done in the 80's. And that being said, it's fantastic. The best word to put to it is EFFORT...and buckets of cash. This series had a budget of Michel Bay levels, and it shows. The detail, the crisp and flowing animation. They don't take too many short cuts and the designs arn't too outlandish. Everything feels like and acts like it works. No skimping, when that robot loses an arm he loses and arm, it's not just some electricy-thing...no, they put WORK into this show, you can tell. Dis ain't no 12 episode wanta-be mecha with stock footage, it's serious business.

The overarching plot of Zeta Gundam revolves around it's characters. As a War drama, our giant robot's here arn't robotic partners helping our heroes defeat the bad guys, they're vehicles, or more simply, weapons.  Robots kill, they break, they need to be repaired. This show has robots in it, but you're not here simply for the robots. It's these characters, and I'm going to outline the two stand out villains. Paptimus Scirocco and Lady Haman. They're practically opposites. A man who believe himself a genius, and thinks everyone else are simply tools for his use. Now, he intends to use these people(tools) to change the world for perhaps the better, but the way he goes about things is a bit...misogynistic. He's pretty fond of wooing women and well, using them.  Then you got Lady Haman, who's like a sexy charismatic female version of Hitler...or perhaps Stalin...I'm not sure.  She's powerful, respected, intelligent, and has a clear goal in which she's driven for. She's a villain you don't get often. How often are women such strong characters such as this?  She's not crazy, or love struck or MWUAHAHA evil, she's focused on rebuilding the family Empire, what's wrong with that...other than that empire being a bunch of racist sociopaths with extremist ideals.

Now, put these two villains against each other, add in a corrupt Government opposed to both, and a Rebel faction EXTREMELY opposed to the corrupt Government, and you have yourself an interesting and extremely difficult to understand from the outside viewer Plot!

This show has far better reviews from far better writers than me, but if you're reading this, I say check it out, you won't regret it.",1374624000,6,3216,4.807971014492754

3173594,5,B0017LGQK4,"...this is without a doubt the best Gundam series I've ever seen. So far it's the only one I've actually liked enough to BUY the whole thing. Some problems do weigh this show down a little bit, but with the legion of positives, it almost doesn't matter.

POSITIVES:
+ Characters are full of personality; good characters aren't all justice, all the time; evil characters are not MWAHAHAHAHA TAKE OVER TEH WORLD evil and each has their own unique characteristics.
+ Rather than have a share of iffy episodes thrown in with some magnificent ones, the show never strays from telling a full-on story.
+ Tons of plot-twists; not a boring and predictable storyline.
+ Music is relatively simple in composition, but adds depth and gives a retro feel.
+ Characters from the original Gundam make more than just cameo appearances; several such as Amuro, Hayato, Katz, Char, and Bright play significant roles in the story, while Kai, Mirai, and Fraw play good brief supporting roles. The only one to make merely a cameo appearance and not even say anything is Sayla.
+ While not continuing right where the first Gundam series left off, the connections to the original are very well planned.

NEGATIVES (Because nothing's really perfect)
- Sometimes when a character doesn't show up for a while, you think ""Where did he/she go?"" and when they return again you think ""How did he/she get here of all places?""
- This is 1985, so the art and animation are a little dated.
- The dub is pretty bad.
- Kamille, while not boring, is sometimes a very annoying, Luke Skywalker-level whiny lead character.

The thing is, not only are there more good things than bad, the good things would outweigh the bad if there were the same number of each. This show simply cannot be missed. BUT! At the same time, it is better you see some fair portion of the first Gundam series, either in the 43 television episodes or the three compilation movies. That way, you will have a significantly better understanding of some of the names and terminology used in this show. 5 stars all the way!",1231286400,17,2053,4.697222222222222

8266500,3,B0017LGQK4,"Like other releases from Rightstuf, this is another strong collection of Gundam. Regardless of what people say about the series itself, this is a good collection. Two things that I should bring up are: 1- there are few extras, but that is par for the course on Gundam blu ray releases. 2- The visual quality of the transfer is not as crisp as other releases, like Zeta or 0079. While I don't know anything about the process used to make this transfer from the master, there is a lower visual fidelity between the ZZ releases and other Gundam sets from Rightstuf.

Don't let a 3 star review dissuade you from buying this set if you want it. ZZ is a real shift in tone after Zeta, but it's still worth watching, and this set is a great way to do so.",1506038400,4,747,4.297872340425532

8266507,5,B0017LGQK4,"Zeta Gundam is such a great series and seeing this made my night. It is a little weird transitioning between the old scenes and new remastered scenes, but it's easy to get used to. I would only recommend this to Gundam fans, newbies may have trouble getting into it since it is in Japanese with English subs. Overall, it's stellar!",1398902400,3,331,4.533333333333333
8266508,1,B0017LGQK4,"First off, I will say that I love this series, but it is not a review of the show but rather for the product and trying to bring awareness of the product's availability and bootleg problems plaguing the marketplace. This is not a seller problem, but these will be found at conventions, online retailers, and brick and mortar stores that don't know better.

In 2012 Bandai Entertainment USA went out of business. Since then many bootlegs have hit the market, especially for the popular shows.

These bootlegs typically come in a clear case and are nearly indistinguishable between the retail copy. These bootlegs are using the same disc count, disc art, and are copying the DVD sleeves art and information as you would see with the official retail release  1:1. This particular series was never released with clear casing and came in a thick black box. The DVDs they're using for these are DVD-5's, meaning that the max they can put on the disc is about 4.75 Gigs while the official retail releases use DVD-9's. Due to the fact it's impossible to tell by looking at the DVD set, the only way to know for sure if you have a bootleg or retail copy is to check the disc's properties in your computer.

The only way you will know for sure that you got an official retail copy, will be:
1. If you buy *directly* from Amazon or Rightstuf. Their warehouse stock comes directly from the publisher.
2. If you buy new it will come with a security sticker.
3. The final test to see if it is legit is to put it into your computer and see if the disc is less than or greater than 4.75 Gigs. If it's greater than that, then you should be good.
Example: [...]
(note: the bootleg on the right was not an Anime Legends bootleg, so they may have copied the disc file name for these as well)

I hope you found this information useful. There's not many people who know about this and I'd hate for people to continue falling prey to buying bootlegs.

Not only is this happening to Bandai's Anime Legends sets, but it's also happening to Discotek Media's sets as well.
