7841861,3,6303257224,"Any fan of Spencer Tracy will like this movie. None of his movies move fast but at an even pace. The effects are good, even by todays standards. If you like Tracy in ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" or ""The Mountain"" you will like this movie. If you enjoy any of the older disaster movies you will certainly find this worth watching. If you like movies with characters fighting personal problems while trying to stay alive from a disaster you will like it. Quite honestly if anyone doesn't enjoy it they just have to short of an attention span.",1040256000,6,535,4.414141414141414
7841862,4,6303257224,"This movie was one of the orginal ""disaster films,"" originating the genre.  Actually, only part of the film was shot on Maui (mostly around Lahaina and the Maui Needle).  The rest was done with some amazing  soundstages.  The volcano (built in the middle of a pond in Fallbrook,  California) provided stock footage for many films that came after, and  you'll be amazed how realistic the earthquake shots look. All this with  low-tech special effects!
If you are bored or unaffected by the actual  movie, you're way too jaded to be watching this human drama of an alcoholic  priest whose life and vocation have lost their meaning.  Go watch a  blockbuster disaster flick and root for the special effects.  Yeah, it's a  little hokily sentimental at times, but I've shown this one to friends who  marvelled at what a great story of human experience it told, got a lump in  their throats at the end, etc.  Then they recommended it to their friends.  (Admittedly, Sinatra is NOT at his best.  However, Spencer Tracy and the  rest of the cast carry the movie.)
(Yes, my father was the art director,  which is how I know so much about the special effects and technical  aspects, but it's still one of my all-time favorite films, even discounting  that.)",947721600,51,1247,4.728971962616822
