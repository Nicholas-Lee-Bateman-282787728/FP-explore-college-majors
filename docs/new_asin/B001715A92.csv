3166356,1,B001715A92,"I ordered this thinking that they, actually, had already made a nice complete set with season One and Two.  I returned it because all it was was Season One Box Set and Season Two Single Container in a special box made to house the two.  I already had bought the two same identical seasons.  I didn't need to pay $50.00 for cardboard that was housing the two that I had already  ordered.  I don't like being mislead and I'm sure everybody out there doesn't like it either.",1214352000,32,471,4.367816091954023
3166357,5,B001715A92,"With season two just being completed and put out for sale this compilation would be the solution if you have yet to purchase season one.  Jericho, in my estimation, was one of the best dramas on TV.  Nicely, it is a change of pace from the great investigation, police or courtroom dramas that are so very good and popular.

The neat thing about Jericho as a series it is a continuation of a story flow, you get hooked from the moment the bomb goes off.  There are scenes in the first episode reminscent of ""The Day After"" and other nuclear war type movies of the 80s.  However, the people seem real and you get into the characters right away.

There are families, three and four generations of hometown Americans.  This movie shows values in relationships and core values of a people trying to survive and overcome hardships in a small town.  For those not in the know, Jericho was supposed to end with Season One.  There was a firestorm after the last episode where a reference to the battle of the buldge is mentioned and the term Nuts is used.  Well, the heroes of season two include the thousands of viewers who sent tons and tons of packaged peanuts to CBS demanding that Jericho stay on for one more year.  CBS relented and ran seven episodes.  That is season two.

However the seven episodes took on a big screen dimension.  Interestingly, many of the episodes in Jericho had a big screen feel to it.  The last episodes of season one and virtually all of season two gave you the big screen feel.  Sadly, with so much more of a focus on getting the meat of the story in season two, you miss many characters and possible themes.  You have to watch season one.  There is the character who is the town bad boy with a very large group of men as his possee.  What could they have done with them in season two?

Well, I guess the only thing left is a possible movie.  Too bad that Jericho was placed against Idol the first year and put on at 10 PM the next.  Really was a welcome relief to reality TV and will be missed.  Jericho will most likely have a 'cult' following for years to come and when people get around to watching it, they will wonder why they missed in in the first place.",1211673600,236,2187,4.332512315270936
3166358,5,B001715A92,"Our favorite series of all time. We still wish NETFLIX would pick this up and do a couple movies or another series. We loved the whole idea of the small town apocalypse scenario and really doesn't seem like it's been touched in the industry. The actors are all nobodies but they are EXCELLENT we love everyone of them and wish they would be in more things. And it's fairly family friendly. With mild language, no sex/nudity, and some violence. It's action packed but on a wholesome level. And you just get so much character development that you really feel so connected. This is one of the only series we watch again and again. We watch it every couple years. It's our favorite when anyone asks!",1508976000,3,695,4.568

3166360,5,B001715A92,"This is a very good series, especially the first season.  The scary thing is that it is so believable, and could really happen in any disaster situation.  It makes you want to evaluate how prepared you are for an emergency, and take note of how people can change and become vicious when facing hunger, and going without the necessities of life.  The video quality is good, and it has extra footage, and includes both the televised ending of season one and the alternative ending.",1508198400,,479,4.678571428571429

3166377,5,B001715A92,"I'd never seen Jericho, had only these reviews to go by.  Everyone said this series was great but we had no idea what we were in for.  My wife and I both went into this blindly, not knowing what to expect, and were both overwhelmed with how well written, produced, acted, this series was.  CBS should have recognized the gold they had, but all they saw (and cared about) was numbers.  I am grateful that they actually bowed to the fans and allowed this show to come to some semblance of a conclusion (kinda sorta).  I am overwhelmed with emotion as I write this, it was just that good.  I wish there were more TV shows like this, instead of the tripe that's on television these days.  I can't say enough good about Jericho, words just don't seem adequate. Highly recommended!",1494288000,8,775,4.453900709219858

3166379,5,B001715A92,"This series is amazing! Even if it only has a handful of episodes, it's so well-plotted and most of the characters are amazingly acted. Heather was underutilized, but I won't get into that for brevity and sanity's sake. I think the best part of the show is that it has a rich cast of characters that bring all different perspectives of society into play. You have the mayor and family, the farmer, the orphaned teen, the school teacher, the government agent, the cops, etc. It's not just focused on one person, and each sect of characters has its own issues. This is especially true of the first season. It also deals with the nuclear fallout issues realistically. Did you know that acid rain would be a problem after a nuclear explosion happened miles away?
 I didn't, but the writers did. They made an effort to make things as realistic as possible. Maybe not perfect, but pretty darn close. Definitely worth purchasing and watching if you enjoy well acted and well-crafted stories. It ends slightly open ended, but it brings closure, so don't worry about that aspect of it. Overall, highly recommend!",1493424000,8,1103,4.774869109947644

3166382,1,B001715A92,"The caliber of this low budget production was no where near my expectations encouraged from the apparent low standards of reviewers who consequently influenced my decision to purchase this B-rated Hollywood production.

I'm sorry I can't disagree more with the rave reviews of this series.  I have extremely high standards, so much so that today's television programming I no longer waste my time with.  I stopped watching television programming in 2007!  I only purchased this due to our current trend of rumors of wars in America to give me ideas of ways to prepare for possible nuclear fall out since our own government won't help at all.

I only watched the first two programs to discover I couldn't any longer dedicate my precious time left to the bad acting, unrealistic scripting and behaviors with vain attempts of depth of character. It was an amateur production of B- rated status in my humble opinion, so bad it doesn't even meet the criteria of helping people consider how to prepare themselves.  I wasted my money on this Hollywood garbage and will be selling the series as used.",1491264000,2,1092,4.875675675675676

3166396,5,B001715A92,"In the history of network television, there have been a short list shows that have gotten a reprieve from cancellation by a unified effort of the show's fans, Jericho was one of them.

Jericho is a small, fictional Kansas town that finds itself isolated after the detonation of a number of atomic bombs across the country in major population centers by unknown perpetrators.

The story the over the first season follows the town's struggles to survive without modern communications or infrastructure while more questions arise about who could have been behind the bombs and parts of the country find new leaders and governments. The very short second season shifts to uncovering the conspiracy surrounding the establishment of an alternate government styling itself as the Allied States of America that includes Jericho in its claimed territory.

In addition to the stories of survival and conspiracy, there's some soap opera as characters mix and match while finding ways to keep the lights on and the food supplies coming. There's a type of plotline for everyone.

There are also characters for everyone: the loyal son who cheats on his wife (Eric Green), the wayward son returning from parts unknown (Jake Green), the mysterious newcomer with a very big secret in his basement (Hawkins), the mayor who tries to hold the town together after the attacks (Johnston Green), the IRS auditor from the big city who ends up stuck in the rural town (Mimi), and the young farmer (Stanley) and his deaf sister (Bonnie) who both have enough backbone to stand up to all comers.

The bonus features include a number of episode commentary tracks by producers and actors. These are worth the time if only to hear Lenny James's (who portrays Robert Hawkins) real accent. There are behind the scenes features about special effects and CGI used in the episodes and the construction of the town set along with deleted scenes and the alternative ending to the final episode of the short second season.

The set includes a Bonus Disk that has a few short features about the campaign to reverse the cancellation decision for the show along with quick takes of ""thank yous"" from cast members for the reprieve. The Bonus Disk also includes the alternative final episode that would have been broadcast if the series had been continued. This disk was a disappointment since the alternative ending is already on another DVD as deleted scenes. The space would have been better used for more short features about the development of the series and technical details of its production.

A major part of that effort including sending several tons of peanuts to the offices of CBS to convince them to reconsider their cancellation order. Why peanuts? Watch the episode DVDs and the Bonus DVD to find the answer.

Highly recommended, especially for those who enjoy conspiracy stories.",1479945600,,2852,4.989473684210527

Like so many other fans of the show I was extremely disappointed when it got cancelled not once but twice! Now that I have it both seasons on dvd, I can watch it any time I want. The plot in which terrorist attack with nukes, the story line of how the people of the town reacted and coped with it, and acting of the people portraying the characters, were all excellent. Unlike all other post nuclear attack shows and movies that came before and after Jericho, it is the most believeable depiction of what life in a small town or america for that matter, would be like after a surprise nuke attack. I still can't believe that the ratings were so low that CBS  cancelled it the first season when it had such a huge fan base that wrote enough letters to get it brought back for a second season. Unlike the conspiracy theorists who like the show, I believe that given the fact that Jericho aired just 5 years after 9/11, that the majority of americans were still recovering from the events of 9/11 and were not ready yet to watch a show about a more horrific terrorist attack. If Jericho  would have aired a couple of years later, I truely believe it would have had better ratings and would have lasted longer.",1464652800,,1285,4.345833333333333

3166436,5,B001715A92,Discs in superb shape and quality of episodes is very good.  It all depends if this is your type of series or not.  Set during WWII Jericho is a commando team that can perform just about any operation needed behind enemy lines.  I remember being excited to see it in fall of 1965 but our local CBS affiliate didn't carry it because of a local football program.  So I patiently waited for football season to end but Jericho was a midseason casualty (very rare for back then) so I had to wait another 20 years until TNT reran it.  It is finally nice to own it and have all 16 episodes.  It may not be the best adventure series ever but is far from being the worst and can be quite entertaining.,1448841600,2,692,4.204545454545454

And despite some very easily defeated Nazis and (by modern standards) downright silly action sequences, it still succeeds quite well on its terms as light-hearted adventure (with occasional sober moments) performed by an attractive cast, with stock WWII movie footage giving it a needed boost in the special effects department. I would cheerfully watch another dozen episodes, if only they existed.

3166467,5,B001715A92,"In 1966, 2 excellent and similar series premiered on CBS: Mission:Impossible and Jericho.  Mission ran for 7 years and became a tv and film legend.  Jericho was gone after 4 months and is little remembered.  Why?
Jericho was executive produced by Norman Felton, the producer of U.N.C.L.E.  However unlike U.N.C.L.E. which was being played for laughs in its 3rd. (1966) season, Jericho was played straight.
Jericho concerned three allied agents who performed various impossible missions behind the lines during W.W.II.  The American played by Canadian Don Francks (most recently known as ""Walter,"" the weapons expert on the La Femme Nikita tv series,) the Frenchman by Marino Mase, an Italian actor and the Englishman by John Leyton, best known as Charles Bronson's best buddy and the other tunnel king in ""The Great Escape.""
Like Mission:Impossible, the show was exciting and suspenseful.  It featured a great musical theme by Jerry Goldsmith.
The show premiered Thursdays at 7:30 against the highly-rated Daniel Boone on NBC and the still-popular (but for not that much longer) Batman on ABC.  When it did poorly in the ratings, rather than changing its time period as had saved so many other shows like U.N.C.L.E. and Hawaii Five-O, CBS simply cancelled it and it was gone by January.
I watched this show at the time and thought it was on a par with Mission:Impossible.  So many adventure series premiered that 1966 season: Mission, Star Trek, The Time Tunnel, The Green Hornet, etc.  These series are still well-remembered today, Jericho is not.
TNT did rerun this series Friday nights about 2AM during the 1990s, I used to tape it on my VCR.  Well my VCR no longer works but I am happy that I can now order this terrific adventure series on DVD. I highly recommend it.",1433808000,38,1772,4.936026936026936

I love that it was fast paced and exciting, but the thing that I really enjoyed most about it was the character development and the interpersonal things that went on between many characters in the story.

I did find the part about the private contractors or mercenary soldiers that our government uses over in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots interesting.  Of course in the story they are being used in our own country, something the American people would never tolerate.  It is kind of a reminder of the greed and corruption in our government and what is wrong with the system, but I don't believe that it was cancelled for political reasons simply because a lot of interesting and  popular shows are cancelled for no obvious reasons.

3166487,5,B001715A92,"What if? What if your town was one of the few towns to survive a nuclear attack on this country? This is the premiss of Jericho. Jericho is a small town that survives while 23 huge cities are destroyed by nuclear bombs. The country is in chaos and the people of Jericho are cut off from any kind of civilization. Soon food becomes scarce, those who are evil try to take what they won't work for, and people are put to the test of survival in a new country. This first season of Jericho is about survival mostly and about human nature at it's best and worst. The series explores a world gone upside down from the inside out. The show has love, romance, action, drama, and human reaction to the unthinkable. The show has great character development, great story-lines, and a point that cannot be overlooked. The fans fought and won an extra season of just 7 episodes that brought this great show to a form of a conclusion. The second season picks up where the first left us hanging at the seasons end, then takes the show in an inevitably different direction. I personally felt the story remained solid in the second season. But, I was unhappy with the direction that the story took. I felt it was less about the people of Jericho and more about the nation and how corporate America has become too controlling of this nation. All in all, the second season did bring us a great conclusion to the series and I cannot complain about that.  I don't recommend buying the first season, because then you would only want to buy the second season. Instead I recommend buying the complete series. It's a great show with a great moral. Buy it, you will be glad you did.

3166513,2,B001715A92,"A decent concept completely undone by . . . well, every other aspect of the show. Sets and effects are often hilariously cheap, notable whenever there's a fire or a flying object of any kind -- these things will often be shot akimbo, in an obvious attempt to disguise the fact that they're badly-drawn cartoons. The writing is clunky and stupid, prone to that worst of Hollywood clichs, to wit, the tendency of characters to describe one another to each other's faces in an attempt to communicate characterization that is not visible in behavior or attitudes. Plotting his hilarious and silly, with characters often doing things for no reason and then departing a location for equally unknowable reasons, as typified by the first season episode ""National Response"", in which the main character desperately tries to extinguish a fire at his brother's house, apparently fails, and then bones out (offscreen) before he has to confront said brother's reaction to the burnt house. (Seriously, ""National Response"" may be the worse episode of television I've ever seen. This plot point is only the tip of the iceberg.) The romances are perfunctory and depressingly typical, as the hunky hero falls into a love triangle before choosing the brainless hot blonde with no personality over the spunky (but, this being television, still hot) brunette who actually does stuff and has a personality and all those annoying things that real women are always up to.

And the acting . . . oh, the acting. Skeet Ulrich isn't exactly Marlon Brando, but he is not alone in grim woodenness, not here, oh no: the actors who play his family are alternately cardboard-bland and shrill; the actor who plays his best friend seems to have taken classes in the Hollywood Cliche School for the Dumb but Sweet; both of the love interests seem to be trying as hard to remember their lines as to give them feeling. And the bit players . . . oh, the bit players. If the world had this many people like these, I would be glad it got nuked. The cast is, basically Shoshannah Stern floating in flat, featureless ocean, acting her poor heart out against the waves.

3166520,5,B001715A92,"A friend introduced me to this series on Netflix last year. I had somehow missed it when it had come out on TV. I was hooked halfway through the first episode when this town and it's citizens realized they had witnessed a nuclear episode of some kind and they began the process of trying to learn exactly what it was and where it came from. The suspense of not knowing if it was an accident, or if it was an attack, or who was responsible was intense. The acting was top notch and the characters were all believable even if some were the kind we love to hate. While it is not a program you can catch here and there or be distracted while you watch, this is a powerful story and it hits close to home when we think of where the world is today with nuclear capabilities and global politics.

3166526,2,B001715A92,"I saw this DVD set available at library and after quickly checking the amazing ratings here on Amazon I picked it up. Like the other two-star reviews I'm also puzzled by the rabid fandom of this show.

The Good: Jericho has a very interesting premise, I can see a producer's eyes light up when coming across a script like this. Much like Stephen King's The Fog, this is about the quiet life in a small town being disrupted by a catastrophe and the uncertainty as they try to figure out what has hit them. There is a large cast of characters and some small twists. There was surely enough promise to make this an EPIC series, unfortunately that's as far as Jericho gets: promise.

The Bad: The bad is most of it. The writing is risible and clich&eacute;d. The acting talent is not uniform; it ranges from very good to wooden, no character ever giving you enough for you to care about them, and the director(s) don't know how to tease you into watching the next episode. And this is what dooms Jericho: the awful directing.

My little rant: the last 10 years have been the golden age of TV series because production companies are FINALLY getting it; giving more creative control to the writers and directors make for better shows. They've abandoned the sacred cow idea of the supremacy of the focus group nonsense, since these just recycled their ideas and didn't really reflect what people want to watch. You can't make a stand-out product by following the same recipe over and over, year after year. This is why series like Battlestar Galactica (with its many faults in the latter seasons), Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead, to name a few, have become a TV phenomenon; they dare to be different. This is also why Jericho fails, by trying to present a brave new world while using the same, trite TV-series recipe that makes for dumbed-down and complacent storylines. Whoever was directing this seemed very beholding to the old, uncreative way of doing a TV series.

The problem is Jericho tries to present a post-apocalyptic world by insisting in treating day-to-day life with the same banality as the day before the explosion. After a catastrophe of that magnitude SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE (anyone who lived through 9-11 -an incident that Jericho tries to capitalize on- knows life didn't feel quite the same for a LONG time) but the good folk of Jericho remain downright indolent. The neighboring city of Denver has apparently been wiped out and no one seems really affected by it; people go to bars, not as refuge or escape, but to kick back, only the main characters have a sense of urgency and most folks treat the whole thing with like a traffic jam.

The perfect example is on episode 2 - when the alarm is raised of the threat of -what they thought would be- acid rain. The episode is divided between frantically finding shelter for people and scenes where the two escaped convicts dressed as patrolmen are trying to... well, it's never clear what their objective is, so they decide that having a casual breakfast and hinting at nookie is better than escaping the inevitable cloud of doom approaching, again: no sense of urgency. At least the quiet, cute and shy ""weird"" kid in love with the spoiled, rich girl finally gets a chance to spend alone time with her through the storm. But as soon as the rains end her friends, whom you'd expect would be huddling with their families at home, show up at her house with the same levity they'd on a regular Saturday afternoon and judge her for hanging out with him, i.e. ""you're hanging out with that loser? Ewww!"" ... because that seems like the most important thing in the world after a nuclear explosion has gone off miles from your town.

And the show goes on like this. Episode after episode.

You're either doing a disaster series/movie or a banal soap opera, and Jericho, to its failure, insists on being both. It doesn't get that some topics are game-changers: if you do a post-apocalyptic scenario then you're turning the world upside down (Walking Dead, The Fog) and life on screen would be rough and bleak. If you combine that with the frivolity and insipidness of Melrose Place you end up with this disaster.",1397088000,6,4170,4.66530612244898

After watching only the first episode  , I had serious doubts  about this series

I have only watched 7 episodes to date but cannot watch any more as I am bored bored bored by the whole show .

Whist the over concept of an armageddon in the USA has so many interesting possibilities for the shows writers etc , they in main  concentrate  only 10% of each episode on the big picture of what is happening to the USA after nuclear war heads have been expolded at various locations throughout the USA

The rest of the time we have a deputy mayor having an affair , will he won't he leave his wife ( who cares), for the last three episodes the  mayor has had flu !!! some horses being stolen !!!!! ,  people complaining that a broken water  hydrant is ruining their front lawn ,a 15 minute  scene is given to a little girl who has went into a school on fire to collect a doll !!!!!!!! everybody seems to spend all their time in the local bar drinking as if nothing has happened to the country , basically in each episode the story progresses forward very little to hold anyones attention

I am sorry but the dialouge is stilted, abysmal , the characters so wooden  and stereotypical

I can see why  this show was never given a 3rd series when compared to some of the excellant shows out there to watch",1396224000,5,1426,4.320754716981132

3166540,5,B001715A92,"A creepy and perhaps all too plausible scenario: A small Kansas town pulls together for survival in the wake of surgical, ""insider"" nuclear attacks conducted against major cities throughout the United States by an unidentified enemy.

The show deals with the ensuing societal chaos and upheaval you would expect to see following such an event.

Towns are isolated and cut off from each other, Communications networks are limited (or gone entirely), and nobody really knows who is still alive, how extensive the attack was, or what is happening in other parts of the country.

Though sort of a failure by commercial standards, it had a loyal core audience. I am convinced this show influenced other, later programs, including ""Last Resort"", ""Revolution"",  ""Lost"", and ""The Last Ship.""

However, it was too esoteric and nuanced for many viewers; not enough carnage and action. The show was a bit too slow moving and cerebral at times, and the final episodes sort of shoehorned a seemingly contrived ending into a short window of time. Thus, the series ended weaker than it started for my tastes. Still, if this is the kind of conspiratorial story line you are into, it was a really cool series.",1387929600,,1192,4.94

The writing was solid, and frankly I wish the series had gone on and on and on.  29 episodes was just too few, and the story lines left we hoping for more.

I liked that the writers didn't give everything away right away.  I mean, I was as lost as the poor folks in that western Kansas town were, and grasped at every bit of information about what had happened, and what was happening, just like they did.

The writing didn't come across as contrived or formulaic.  Jericho is solid drama.

5 stars, no question.

Oh, I also loved that though there was a significant amount of tension, action, and even some violence here and there that the overall rating was still TV-PG.  Very watchable.

3166580,5,B001715A92,WOW... I first saw this show on Netflix! A friend of mine had mentioned it too me years ago when it was on TV but I never got around to watching it. I AM GLAD I HAVE... I watched it twice on Netflix and now purchased the entire series for the special features. ...

3166586,5,B001715A92,"Please understand.  I do not feel it is possible to better state what others have already stated... That is not my intent.
Now, I did not see this series when it came out, and was 'ressurected', because I could no longer afford TV. Such is life.
Only because of an Amazon Prime membership, which is SO much less expensive than either Netflix OR Hulu; was I able to see it, ""live"" it, and mourn the end of Ssn. 2, Ep. 7;  along with everyone else...
So, Here is my Question:
IF, as is 'hinted' in reviews ( if not right out stated), a commercial broadcaster received pressure to remove the series because of the possibility of television becoming 'too close to real',  why did an independent (say, HBO) not try to pick up the show?
Or, did they try, and possibly get the same pressure to NOT proceed?

This show, so quickly canned, must be far too close for comfort for ""someone"" out there ... is our government agency controlling TV broadcasts that paranoid, that they wholeheartedly believe the American public cannot at least enjoy a 'fictional' story, albeit so beautifully written and played by the cast(s)?  Yes, they made it all feel ""very"" real...and I'm not going to go further with that
But, it makes me wonder (and surely others have wondered long before me) just what was the governing federal agency worried about?
Does ANYONE know?  I feel like the proverbial mushroom being kept in the dark.

3166601,5,B001715A92,"Another criminally underrated show that deserved to air for much longer than 2 seasons. It's right up there with Firefly, Dollhouse, and FlashForward as far as quality of acting and writing goes. But at least the two seasons we got were wonderful, edge-of-your-seat, white-knuckled ride that stayed in my heart and mind for a while.

My only complaint here is that the first few episodes have some pretty silly fallacies (fallout that ""clears"" in 4 days? Ahem). A nuclear apocalypse purist that I am, I rolled my eyes and was tempted to turn it off right then and there. But the show drew me in with great actors, complex characters, and interesting twists and turns. The rest of it proved so good that by the end of the first season all those little imperfections were completely forgiven and forgotten. After that it was ""one more episode... one more episode... one more episode..."" all the way till the end, and sadness once it was over.

I think the main thing this show has going for it is extremely likable characters who aren't cookie-cutter, and whom the average Joe can relate to. There's great chemistry between these actors, lots of great character development that they handle in a great and believable way. I rooted for the good guys, I laughed, I cried. This show is especially relevant now, in this rapidly changing world, where we don't know if tomorrow we may too find ourselves in this situation.

3166607,5,B001715A92,"Jericho: The Complete Series comes housed in a slipcase with the individual releases for the two seasons packed next to each other. There's nothing significant about this set other than the cardboard slip, which has that jaw-dropping image from the series finale as its cover, but it does have a bonus disc full of extra stuff that fans will want to see. We'll tackle that disc in turn, but first the individual season sets:

Season 1:

Inside the cardboard slipcase are three thin-pak cases that house two discs each. Covers for each disc range with the cast of the series, ranging from main to supporting; Jake's present in all of the covers, with Emily Sullivan (Ashley Scott) and Heather Lisinski (Sprauge Grayden) being on two of the three as well. Disc art features a character on each and menus for the show are motionless with only the morse code beeping over the main menu. The presentation of the show is remarkable. Great colors, grain where it's needed and a clear image throughout, the show looks great. The audio, a solid 5.1 mix that actually gets used, is also a nice addition. I'm glad to see that 5.1 seems to be the standard for these TV shows on DVD as it really adds to the viewing experience. There is a lot of needless bass in the show at times, with commercial breaks being sounded by a resounding reverb on more than one occasion. Still, I like bass--obviously, otherwise I wouldn't have bought a subwoofer about three times too big for my room. The back of the packaging states that some things may have been edited out from the original broadcast, but since I didn't watch the show as it aired originally, I don't know what was left out. Moving onto the special features we get a mixture of deleted scenes for twelve separate episodes. All of the deleted scenes come with commentary by producers Dan Shotz and Karim Zreik and there are some really nice things left on the cutting room floor. Mostly character elements, but they're worth watching, especially if you're a fan of the series. Next up are five commentaries on ""Pilot: The First Seventeen Hours"", ""Fallout"", ""Rogue River"", ""Red Flag"" and ""Vox Populi."" All of the commentaries are fun to listen to, with Skeet Ulrich and Lennie James being the biggest clowns on the tracks. Executive producers Jon Turtletaub and Carol Barbee keep the tracks on-topic with comments about the production of the specific episodes and other technical aspects. ""Building Jericho"" is your typical making-of featurette with interviews from cast and crew. We do get to see a lot of the set that we don't normally see, which is very cool--it takes some of ""wow"" factor out of the show when you realize it's all on a sound stage, but how they hide everything and still manage to make it look as great as it does is a true testament to the technical team working on the show. The actors chime in with their comments on the show and how much fun it is to work on it. There's back-patting all around and not a single mention of the show being cancelled at one point. Guess they're saving that for the second season DVD, complete with a full count of how many nuts were sent to CBS. The final extra is a ""What If?"" extra that is a ""revealing look at how the nuclear arms race evolved since the end of World War II."" This extra isn't really related to the show other than the nuclear aspect and it doesn't do much else than scare the bejesus out of the viewer. Nuclear war is always a scary prospect and this documentary doesn't do much to help ease the fear--in fact, it does the opposite. Overall the series has a solid representation on DVD. Fans will be able to watch their favorite episodes over and over while they wait for the second season to premiere (as of this writing it is still unscheduled) and it will hopefully bring in a few new fans (I already plan on lending out my copy to help rope in a few more viewers) so that the show can have a very successful return to air. Recommended.

Season Two:

Jericho's second season comes housed in a two-disc amaray DVD case without a slipcover or insert. Jake gets center stage on the cover as well as the DVD menus and disc descriptions are placed on the reverse of the DVD insert, behind the discs. The video and audio presentation is identical to what we got on the first season set: clean, clear and without flaw. The image is a tad soft, but I think that's just me being used to Blu-ray's and overly critical of DVD transfers now. The extras for this set start out on the first disc and don't stop until the second (not really saying much considering there's only two discs, but still). Each of the seven episodes feature commentary with Jonathan E. Steingberg and a mix of other crew and all but one episode (""Jennings & Rall"") feature deleted scenes. The commentaries are all insightful and a treat to listen to considering the first season set, containing sixteen episodes, contained commentary on only five of the episodes, so it's quite the rare occurrence to have commentary on everyone of the episodes (unless you're The Simpsons). Fans of the show will want to check the commentaries out for nuggets of information that aren't available anywhere else...not to mention the general fun mood of the commentaries, which translate into an entertaining listen as well. There's also an alternate unaired ending cut of the finale that's included here as well that has a different commentary track starting at around the third act of the episode. Next are the deleted scenes for the episodes: ""Reconstruction"" (1:25), ""Condor"" (1:12), ""Oversight"" (0:57), ""Termination for Cause"" (1:02), ""Sedition"" (3:47), and ""Patriots and Tyrants"" (6:17). As you can see the scenes get lengthier as the episodes go about and each one of them has commentary to accompany it and discussion on why certain things were cut. Also included here is the ""Alternate Ending for Series"" (25:11), which also has commentary and is simply clipped from the alternate unaired ending version of ""Patriots and Tyrants."" Following that there is a pair of featurettes: ""Rebuilding Jericho"" (25:56) and ""Nut Job"" (9:46). ""Rebuilding"" talks about the return to the set and the changes that needed to be made to the show to meet its new shorter shoot schedule as well as smaller budget. ""Nut Job"", of course, revolves around the fan effort to deluge CBS with peanuts. I'm not sure what this show will go down in history more for: being a highly entertaining and original show or for the Nuts campaign. Either way these two extras reflect an incredible amount of love for the fans, as without them this second season set wouldn't even have happened. From the very first episode till the last it was on the edge of your seats action-drama series. This is a must have for action-drama lovers. 5 star all the way.",1354320000,,6786,4.671404682274248

I do not understand why this one was cancelled so quickly.

However, I am especailly appreciative to the producers and writers that they supplied a reasonable ending even if it came all too soon... and then gave us an alternate ending to allow for some of us to continue the story through a new form of media (graphic novels). Granted this is not the best TV show I have ever seen, but it deserved a better chance to continue. I definately finished season two wanting more.",1349654400,2,809,4.6573426573426575

3166621,5,B001715A92,"Jericho is a gripping drama of the aftermath of partial US destruction via limited nuclear detonations.  It follows the effects on life in a small middle of the US town not directly impacted by the explosion, but suffering the collapse of the easy life and modern comforts we've all grown to expect and depend upon.  My family was never able to watch just one episode - we were immediately drawn into the story and the characters' lifes and had to ""play the next episode"" to find out how the current issue resolved.  Warning: This series is addictive!  While the storyline in this case follows limited nuclear weapons detonation, it could easily have been set up with a biological outbreak or economic collapse as foil and the story would have been just as riveting.  It is not only a great series with excellent writing and acting, it can be seen as a superb cautionary tale for what may occur in the US if we continue on the reckless ""spend 50% more than you make"" trajectory that the politicians have set and the international loans that keep this nation afloat are suddenly cut off.",1340236800,,1086,4.635416666666667

3166626,5,B001715A92,"Jericho was a near future sci fi TV series set in Jericho, a small farm and mining town in Kansas.  The isolated location of this town, allowed it to survive a national catastrophe, the destruction of 23 major U.S. cities by terrorist planted nuclear bombs. The series mixes the post apocalyptic story of the town's adaptation to end of the world with the discovery of the secrets of the true perpetrators of the attack. There are lots of plot twists and turns and action sequences. The scathing caricatures of government contractors run amok, and of corporate and political corruption at high levels still seem relevant. Maybe more so today than when the series aired. It's well written and the actors did a good job with their roles. Their characters lives and interactions are more complex than first appear. The fans demanded the short second season and the team put out a great effort, packing a lot of big screen action and drama into the small screen episodic format. My set also included an additional separate bonus disc, and there is optional commentary and deleted scenes for all episodes. Also, there is background material included.

Brad Beyer who plays his best friend Stanely, that even after five years still accepts him and Shoshannah Stern who plays Stanley's deaf sister, walks away with all respect for the way she plays this roll.  Then we have Lennie James who ends up a somewhat friend to Jake because of the deep desire to make amends for all the wrongs that he and everyone else perceive that he has made.

3166633,5,B001715A92,"Can not comment on the DVD items, but the show is absolutely AMAZING, very addictive, great script, great actors. Season 2 definitely add more gorgeous cinematography. (SPOILER ALERT): The story begins with the defiant rebellious youngest son of the current Jericho's Mayor mysteriously shows up after five years of unknown whereabouts. The story is centered on an after math when ""the bombs"" was dropped and divided the United States governments. A little town in Kansas called Jericho is left to defend itself against waring neighboring towns, nomadic wanderers, gangsters..etc. and at the same time they're trying to keep Democracy alive within and remain civilize. The story implies that when us human are stripped of everything our only instinct is to feed and survive no matter the cost. I like how the story shows that even in the midst of all the chaos where there are no rules or law that are still good people who with fight to maintain law and order and be ""civilize"". This show is way better than ""LOST"". I'm a movie buff and I would rank this #1 on my 20 years list.
Again a great show for the family, I have to walk away from the TV when I get teary eyes...and I have never had teary eyes watching a movie.",1332720000,,1220,4.652777777777778

This is exactly the kind of program we all need to be watching today. What I find interesting is that the series was pulled just with the election of our present President. Hmm! And those jokers who have given their negative reviews on Amazon, supposedly in objective fashion, how many of those I wonder are sheeple who bow and worship our present President and believe in all his lies, because they are too lazy to think for themselves. They allow the government to think for them. Yes, I could see why they feel so threatened by such a series as ""Jericho"". That would be why they would participate in the same campaign as their liar and chief to dissuade others from watching this series. Do not believe them.

3166644,5,B001715A92,"Top-notch series entertaining, exciting and dramatic with lots of well-done twists and turns. Interestingly, since this show was mainstream network, it demonstrates vividly that an exciting and intense drama can be developed without the kind of gross overuse of obscenities, extreme violence, blood & gore and graphic sex that the writers of series on paid channels like HBO and Showtime seem to feel they MUST use since they CAN. (For example, Dexter is a great show but if his sister uses the F* word one more time in her ordinary conversation, my shoe is going thru the TV box!) My only quibble involves the occasional weak plot device such as having critical electronics like laptops and communication devices not protected by passwords so a passer-by can uncover earth-shattering secrets with the press of a button. But I guess the writer could always have found another device to disclose the secrets, in order to keep the story moving, so I forgive them! HIGHLY recommended, wish it hard run for more seasons!",1322784000,,1016,4.982352941176471
3166645,5,B001715A92,"When this show was on TV I worked nights so I never had the opportunity to watch it.  I don't own the DVD's but discovered that the show suddenly appeared on Netflix.  I eagerly sat through every episode within a 3 day period, devouring the show as I felt I would when I had seen the promos.

I love post-apocalyptic horror/drama, and boy did this fit the bill.  I was a bit leery as I'm not a big fan of Skeet Ulrich, but in this show he really grew on me.  I was unfamiliar with many of the actors, which actually made the show better.  It reminded me of ""Alas Babylon"" revisited.  Sudden nuclear holocaust takes out most of the US leaving few small towns left standing.  This series follows the trials and tribulations of the small town of Jericho as they attempt to rebuild their town, defend it from vicious attackers, feed it's citizens, get the power on, and figure out just what happened in the world. If you watch it, you will find yourself watching show after show into the wee hours of the morning.

Though some of the characters are a little week, I did enjoy the majority of them.  I didn't find too many cringe worthy lines or utterly absurd moments (I don't watch much TV because of it).  What I was happy to see was a very plausible reaction of a small town to a major catastrophe.  The trials they faced felt all too real, and their individual reactions (many of which were things I would never do) did remind me of how many people would react in that situation.

Was this the perfect show?  No, first of all it was only a season and a half.  Although the final episode does give an ending, I was left wanting so much more.  Second the acting in parts was very TV movie, but most of the leads did fantastic jobs, with one scene in the second season almost bringing me to tears.  I was not overly thrilled with the very first episode, but by the third I was officially hooked.

I can envision myself watching this show again from beginning to end in a year or so when it will feel shiny and new again.  Rarely do I feel engaged in a TV show, this one pulled me in and kept me furiously watching until the end.  I gave this 5 stars because of how it pulled me in and kept me there.

There is blood, and there are killings, and this is far too adult for the kiddies to enjoy, but I loved it.",1320105600,3,2305,4.20501138952164

3166649,5,B001715A92,"This is my 1st review from several purchases of boxed sets from Amazon, but I felt compelled to give my opinion on this series.

Jericho is your worst nightmare come true. Multiple nuclear bombs are set off in key cities throughout the United States. Jericho is a small town with good small town morals that has to deal with this crisis. The citizens saw the mushroom cloud of one of the cities and find out that there was at least one more bomb set off in Georgia. But they are isolated, without power or communication and they don't know how many more bombs may have been set off. Jericho is a very emotional series that deals with right versus wrong, and how one small town tries to maintain their morals. There are a lot of twists and turns you don't see coming. For example: is there a terrorist living among them?

Jerisho deals with emotions and several moral decisions. But it is also an informative series as well. What should one do if nuclear fallout is headed your way? What happens when your town runs out of food as no deliveries are being made?  How do you battle a neighboring town, thugs travelling from town to town, or a new self proclaimed government? How do you rebuild your once peaceful town?

The writing is good, and the acting is great. Skeet Ulrich gave an outstanding performance as the once bad boy of Jericho who returns as a good man. (He's also not bad on the eyes for you female viewers, and we do get to see him wrapped in a towel!)

I missed Jericho when it was aired on TV and I am so pleased the fans demanded a second season when it was cancelled after the first season. There are plenty of extras on this set including an alternate unaired ending from the season finale.

This is just another example of an excellent series being cancelled before it's time, and probably replaced by some new ""reality"" show that makes most of us want to puke. Jericho grips you from the start and you hate to see it end. If you want entertainment and information, this is the series for you.",1317513600,2,2013,4.412398921832884

3166651,5,B001715A92,"while the show takes a lot of liberties - like the ones some people mention, for instance - that's part of telling a good story. you choose to not focus on certain things so you can focus on others. this is such a story.
and while there's a lot of ""well, they could have just done that!"" or ""how can they possibly look like that!"" ... everything within the story IS within the realm of possibility. there are no gaping logic holes - stretches of the imagination, sure - but things MAKE SENSE. and that's much more than can be said for most of tv and movies.

And incidentally, people weren't walking around in rags and filth before washing machines were invented, you know. There isn't a single thing in my closet that I can't wash, dry, and iron without any electricity at all. so for those people who will always complain in shows like this that folks are too clean or too good looking... well, maybe you should use your imagination and creativity a little more instead of depending on appliances :)",1312243200,,1001,4.469945355191257

JERICHO is so much more than a ""Red Dawn"" adventure.  It so accurately portrays with startling realism the chaos and panic that would ensue when our nation loses almost 25 cities in nuclear bombings.  It shows the decay of morals and civility within a country when your focus becomes water, food, fuel, electricity, and medicine.  Without these necessities, life deteriorates within days.

The acting and plot lines were magnificent.  Absolutely every single actor and writer should feel proud to have worked on this series. Bravo!!  I believe that it will stand out as one of the best television shows of the decade.

It is a bit of a tear jerker at times. Afterall, a lot of people die off and some when you have become quite attached. The story centers around a town in the midwest that has to deal with what happens to the US after an atomic war takes place.

3166662,5,B001715A92,"It all began with mysterous mushrooms growing in the clouds, and developed into something that was quite the interesting thing. From the problems that came with needs to the things that people held onto because they hoped beyond hope that things like family and cities and nationalism could survive, Jericho quickly grew. It brought up a lot of things that series like to leave out, like what happens when a community wants a piece of your land so they can feed themselves or if one person has the right to hold a town almost at gunpoint because they own a store that happened upon some food along the way. Combine that with one of the most intriguing characters you'll ever see hiding in the background (he was one of those people you wanted to figure out, wanted to believe, but really didn't ever know for cerrtain), with flashes of brillance in the form of skirmishes that turned into mortar rounds and that turned into warfare, and with streaks racing through the sky and little glimpses of the world in a few frames and you have something that existed wonderfully - if briefly - on a channel that didn't love it enough.

In Jericho, I found a great thing because this was more than a normal series. It didn't place faith in filler and it didn't really place trust in things happening matter-of-factly. The acting got better as the series went on, the characters got more interesting as you got to know them, and Jericho got more pressing as their wants and needs began to get bigger. The way they thought was beautiful, too, from the reasons you needed to take the logos off of vehicles to the pressing notion of love, loss, and alcohol on a town that didn't value most of these things enough before - whatever it is - begins developing. You don't know what it is developing either, and that;'s a great thing. honestly, I liked that most of all.

If you need the whole series in one sweep, this is a good way to do it. If not, perhaps you should look into other avenues but you'll still want to finish it out. After watching some of it you'll see why the fan following was so dedictated to their show, too, and why cancellation was fought off for a time by peanuts for thousands upon thousands of fans simply because they liked what they saw.
The sea of channels seems littered with the static of beautiful sdhows - that is one thing I have begun noticing more and more as time presses on. This is just another 5-star example of that hideously unfair thing.",1290729600,,2463,4.495535714285714
3166663,5,B001715A92,"Network TV needs to re-evaluate how it determines which shows to cancel and which to keep.  Jericho joined the ranks with Miracles and FireFly as excellent entertainment shut down by idiots in power.  At this time, the only network show I watch and enjoy is Castle and I'm sure some overpaid suit will cancel it before it's time.

Jericho is not only entertaining and thrilling but thought provoking.  What would you do, how would you react if nuclear bombs went off in America?  If you were in a small town, which town would you wish to be part of - Jericho or New Bern?  What would you do if you were caught in the wrong town?  How far would you go to protect yourself, your family and your property from your neighbors?  How far would your humanity stretch and when would it break?

These were the same questions I asked myself after reading (then watching) The Stand by Stephen King.  Would I stay put?  Would I try to get to my family who live over a thousand miles away?  Of my things, material things, what would I take if I had to leave?  Would I be able to defend myself?  Would I be smart and lucky enough to survive?

I think it's interesting, and honest, that in the case of both Jericho and The Stand, our own government became our, and their own, downfall.  The greed, corruption and stupidity of those in power is quite frightening in the real world.  I'm not sure it's a large stretch from real world to Jericho or The Stand.",1289260800,,1441,4.377358490566038

3166666,5,B001715A92,"""Jericho"" is a frightening story about America after a devastating nuclear terrorist attack against 23 US cities.  The small town of Jericho -- 5000 souls, is not touched directly by the nuclear attack.  The national power and information grid is gone, and the industrial and agricultural back of the nation is broken.

One of the strongest aspects of ""Jericho"" are the superb characterizations. The cast in this series is excellent, and does a fabulous job of transporting the viewer into a scenario that is all too believable and even plausible.  People in this series act like real people, not Hollywood cut-outs.  Season One ends with a weird scenario in which certain Western States combine into the ""Allied States of America"" with a creepy new flag and a plan to shred the Constitution -- beginning with the Second Amendment's promise of the right to keep and bear arms.  Nothing blew my mind half as much as the close-up of this new flag, which promised ""a new direction"" for the Nation.

Hollywood could not resist a few stupid and pointless jabs at the right-wing of this country, but I refused to allow this obnoxious Hollywood trait to interfere with my enjoyment of this superb series.  No spoilers here, but if you watch the series you will see that to which I refer.

It is highly regrettable that this series did not make it into Season Three.  ""Jericho"" is a find, and it caters to the thoughtful viewer.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1286668800,4,1447,4.790322580645161

This series is absolutely fantistic! I was ""glued' to the T.V screen, impatient for each episode! This series vividly depicts the aftermath of a home grown terrorest attack with nuclear bombs on dozens of american cities! Making a bad situation go to worse, another nuclear bomb explodes high in the atmosphere resulting in an electro-magnetic pulse, shockwave, that fries over 90% of electronic instruments computers and cell phones over a ""hundreds of miles"" radius. The towns-folk of Jericho are then forced to band together for mutual survival and to fight off groups of maurading thieves, mercenaries and killers. Even a decleared war from a neighboring town that wants to forceably take their meager survival provisions! This series is very thought-provoking and scary! We may be on the verge of something like this in the near future. This series is a must-see for all survivalists! The action and suspense will have you wondering just what would you do in a similar situation!",1282521600,11,1158,5.85207100591716

I told my husband he would enjoy it too, so we rented Season 1 and watched it in its entirety.  We knew we would want to own this TV show, so held off on watching the second half of Season 2 (my husband had missed the first half) until we could purchase the series.  We had a great week watching the whole thing and find it a series worth having in our permanent collection!  It is extremely frustrating that TV executives cancel series like this one.

3166685,5,B001715A92,"I never watched Jericho on TV.  I never DVR'd it.  I had heard the hype, which generally causes my fanboy-repulsion-reflex to kick in (although Battlestar and Firefly are two of my favorites, so maybe I'm not immune).

So we Netflixed it recently, and by about episode 2, we were hooked.  The acting, the story, the action sequences, and even the effects are all top notch, by any standards.  By the end of Season 1, I was very skeptical that they could wrap this whole complex and layered plot up.

But they did.  In 7 short episodes of Season 2, things speed up and take on a more epic, desperate tone, and ultimately end up resolving themselves, more or less.  So don't be afraid of Jericho, thinking you are getting involved in yet another doomed TV show that was too good for the general population and badly marketed by the network.  There IS closure  on this one, and in my opinion, when the final credits roll, you will agree this is one of the most original and well executed action/dramas that has been on TV.

And it took the 2nd season to make it so.  I can completely understand why fans went ""nuts"" at the close of S-1, but I think all of us fans will now rest, perhaps, a little easier.  Jericho is a series you will want to make a cornerstone of your collection, without a doubt.",1236902400,7,1295,4.390756302521009
3166686,2,B001715A92,"Who doesn't enjoy a post apocalyptic story, show, movie etc. I know I do and when I first heard about this show I couldn't wait to see it.  Unfortunately after seeing the first six or seven episodes I realized, this show is terrible.  I do not understand why most of the other reviews are so positive.
ACTING- 1.5 out of 4 (a few of them are not terrible actors)
STORYLINE- 1 out of 4 (The town elders realize at the last minute that the hospital generator will be out of gas in a few hours.  They race to get fuel from nearby town to keep the hospital generator running, que dramatic music while the camera follows a gas delivery truck driving to and from the other town. Don't worry, they make it back in time for life support machines.)
LOGIC- there is none! I could go on and on about the head scratching lack of logic in every episode I saw.  For example three men hijack an armed truck on horseback.  The driver and passenger didn't think to step on it or use their guns.  Later 4 good guys take on 8 bad guys armed with automatic rifles.  Stop me if you've heard this terrible TV writing cliche before,  good guys firing from behind the trucks wheels are not hit, the tires don't even get hit, but the bad guys end up dead.
Never did I get a sense this was a post apocyliptic world.  Sure there's no power so no lights or heat or hot water.  Yet everybody in this bumpkin town dresses in nice expensive clean good looking clothing.  Good to know the laundrymat's still open.  Everyone always looks freshly showered, the womens makeup is always perfect.  If anything I think for most of the shows characters, this whole nuclear annihalation thing is just an irritating little side show to what's going on in their daily lives.  Did I mention the acting is really bad?
I have only seen about half of the first season because I finally just had to skip to the season 1 ending so maybe the episodes I skipped plus season 2 were better then the ones I saw, or maybe their not.

P.S. If your looking for a good apocalyptic story to read, buy Robert McCammon's Swan Song, and if you enjoy that, buy almost any other book by Robert McCammon",1236556800,22,2139,4.339195979899498

3166695,4,B001715A92,"I have to preface this review by revealing that I do not watch TV. That's right, America, I actually do not watch TV. Oh, I have a great, big, 42"" LCD HDTV, but I choose to only use that for watching DVDs because, quite frankly, commercial TV sucks. Having said that, I do have a membership to NetFlix, so I have previewed a few TV shows there because they are commercial free. My most recent discovery is ""Jericho"".

I originally played the first episode because I am a fan of Skeet Ulrich (Jake Green). Many have referred to Skeet as a poor man's Johnny Depp, but I think Skeet is just a little more relaxed with his performances since he doesn't have so much pressure to be the big Hollywood star. Add Gerald McRaney as Skeet's father (Johnston Green) and mayor of the town and top it with the tough as nails mom who just can't wait to bake you a homemade pie, Pamela Reed (Gail Green), and you have an instant winner.

I can't say enough about this show. I love the fact that Jericho is a speck of a town in the middle of Kansas that chooses not to fall apart during the worst disaster in the history of the United States. The people of Jericho simply ""get it"". Towns surrounding them have fallen into anarchy while Jericho celebrates Thanksgiving, manages to keep their grocery store in business, and still feels it is important to go out and vote. This isn't just an apocalyptic tale of death and chaos, it's a family story from the word go.  Ulrich's Jake Green has just returned to town from a self-imposed exile when the whole world gets turned upside down. Throughout the first few episodes we see the uncomfortable silences between Jake and his father. We also watch as the friendship between Jake and his brother, Eric (Kenneth Mitchell), slowly rebuilds. Of course, what end of the world tale would be complete without the ""boy sees girl he has always loved but now she is engaged to someone else"" arc?

Buy this boxed set if you want to sit down and have a literal marathon of excellent TV. I know CBS cancelled the show mid-second season, but let me tell you, the suits at the Eye are idiots and should all be fired. This is TV worth watching. There are film makers out there who should watch this little show and take notes. The soundtrack alone is worth the purchase. My favorite musical finds are Coldplay's ""Til Kingdom Come"" and Damien Rice's ""9 Crimes"" which played during the perfectly choreographed final scene of season two, episode four, ""Oversight"".

Of course, this is just my humble opinion, but I think CBS might actually take me seriously once they see the film I'm working on. If that happens, I'll make sure Jericho gets a second chance!",1229558400,38,2669,4.5175983436853

3166700,5,B001715A92,"I really like television shows like ""Lost"", ""Damages"" and others that are not the standard fare.

""Jericho"" fits right in with these with its basic concept of what happens if something strange,  in this case a nuclear disaster, happens.

The characters were well developed and the mystery of what was going on was addictive.  Story lines were solid and the writers were not adverse to providing some shocks along the way.

The second season may not have been quite as good as the first season, but it was probably due to the strike and the fact the show was always in a difficult position as to whether it would be renewed.  So the second season seemed just a bit rushed in that respect.

Like some other shows I wish were around longer I was dissapointed to see it was not renewed for a third season.

3166701,5,B001715A92,"As a fan of the show while it aired on CBS, I am not completely objective.  However, I will say that I am a busy person with little time for TV, but this show captivated me and pulled me in from the beginning.  Though the post-apocalyptic theme may have viewers thinking that it's a death, doom and destruction-type show, it's much more than that.

Jericho is a study in the 'character' of the characters and how disaster can either bring out the worst or the best in individuals.  The show also showcases how the values related to home, love, family, community, teamwork, and compassion still ring true -- no matter how dire the circumstances and even if the world as we know it is no more.

I enjoyed seeing some familiar faces like Skeet Ulrich, Gerald McRaney, Esai Morales, Alicia Coppola, etc., as well as getting to know many new ones to me, like Brad Beyer, Lennie James, Ashley Scott, Bob Stephenson, and others.  There's no more handsome, heroic, and yet flawed ""prodigal son"" than Skeet's Jake Green, no better moral compass than McRaney's Mayor Green, and no badder, more awesome mystery man than James' Robert Hawkins.

Jericho is a town not unlike ones in which we grew up, and the townsfolk are very similar to people you know. And because of that, it forces you to confront the question of ""What if.....? What would I do if this happened to me?""

Jericho is still too much of an undiscovered gem for too many people.  Do yourself a favor and figure out why, even after two TV cancellations, this show still has such a staunch fan base that insists the Jericho story continue.",1220745600,21,1591,4.593639575971731

3400854,5,B001715A92,"With season two just being completed and put out for sale this compilation would be the solution if you have yet to purchase season one.  Jericho, in my estimation, was one of the best dramas on TV.  Nicely, it is a change of pace from the great investigation, police or courtroom dramas that are so very good and popular.

The neat thing about Jericho as a series it is a continuation of a story flow, you get hooked from the moment the bomb goes off.  There are scenes in the first episode reminscent of ""The Day After"" and other nuclear war type movies of the 80s.  However, the people seem real and you get into the characters right away.

There are families, three and four generations of hometown Americans.  This movie shows values in relationships and core values of a people trying to survive and overcome hardships in a small town.  For those not in the know, Jericho was supposed to end with Season One.  There was a firestorm after the last episode where a reference to the battle of the buldge is mentioned and the term Nuts is used.  Well, the heroes of season two include the thousands of viewers who sent tons and tons of packaged peanuts to CBS demanding that Jericho stay on for one more year.  CBS relented and ran seven episodes.  That is season two.

However the seven episodes took on a big screen dimension.  Interestingly, many of the episodes in Jericho had a big screen feel to it.  The last episodes of season one and virtually all of season two gave you the big screen feel.  Sadly, with so much more of a focus on getting the meat of the story in season two, you miss many characters and possible themes.  You have to watch season one.  There is the character who is the town bad boy with a very large group of men as his possee.  What could they have done with them in season two?

Well, I guess the only thing left is a possible movie.  Too bad that Jericho was placed against Idol the first year and put on at 10 PM the next.  Really was a welcome relief to reality TV and will be missed.  Jericho will most likely have a 'cult' following for years to come and when people get around to watching it, they will wonder why they missed in in the first place.",1211673600,236,2187,4.332512315270936
3400855,5,B001715A92,"Our favorite series of all time. We still wish NETFLIX would pick this up and do a couple movies or another series. We loved the whole idea of the small town apocalypse scenario and really doesn't seem like it's been touched in the industry. The actors are all nobodies but they are EXCELLENT we love everyone of them and wish they would be in more things. And it's fairly family friendly. With mild language, no sex/nudity, and some violence. It's action packed but on a wholesome level. And you just get so much character development that you really feel so connected. This is one of the only series we watch again and again. We watch it every couple years. It's our favorite when anyone asks!",1508976000,3,695,4.568

My wife and I both went into this blindly, not knowing what to expect, and were both overwhelmed with how well written, produced, acted, this series was.  CBS should have recognized the gold they had, but all they saw (and cared about) was numbers.  I am grateful that they actually bowed to the fans and allowed this show to come to some semblance of a conclusion (kinda sorta).  I am overwhelmed with emotion as I write this, it was just that good.  I wish there were more TV shows like this, instead of the tripe that's on television these days.

Heather was underutilized, but I won't get into that for brevity and sanity's sake. I think the best part of the show is that it has a rich cast of characters that bring all different perspectives of society into play. You have the mayor and family, the farmer, the orphaned teen, the school teacher, the government agent, the cops, etc. It's not just focused on one person, and each sect of characters has its own issues. This is especially true of the first season. It also deals with the nuclear fallout issues realistically. Did you know that acid rain would be a problem after a nuclear explosion happened miles away?
 I didn't, but the writers did. They made an effort to make things as realistic as possible. Maybe not perfect, but pretty darn close. Definitely worth purchasing and watching if you enjoy well acted and well-crafted stories. It ends slightly open ended, but it brings closure, so don't worry about that aspect of it.

3400879,1,B001715A92,"The caliber of this low budget production was no where near my expectations encouraged from the apparent low standards of reviewers who consequently influenced my decision to purchase this B-rated Hollywood production.

I'm sorry I can't disagree more with the rave reviews of this series.  I have extremely high standards, so much so that today's television programming I no longer waste my time with.  I stopped watching television programming in 2007!  I only purchased this due to our current trend of rumors of wars in America to give me ideas of ways to prepare for possible nuclear fall out since our own government won't help at all.

I only watched the first two programs to discover I couldn't any longer dedicate my precious time left to the bad acting, unrealistic scripting and behaviors with vain attempts of depth of character. It was an amateur production of B- rated status in my humble opinion, so bad it doesn't even meet the criteria of helping people consider how to prepare themselves.

3400893,5,B001715A92,"In the history of network television, there have been a short list shows that have gotten a reprieve from cancellation by a unified effort of the show's fans, Jericho was one of them.

Jericho is a small, fictional Kansas town that finds itself isolated after the detonation of a number of atomic bombs across the country in major population centers by unknown perpetrators.

The story the over the first season follows the town's struggles to survive without modern communications or infrastructure while more questions arise about who could have been behind the bombs and parts of the country find new leaders and governments. The very short second season shifts to uncovering the conspiracy surrounding the establishment of an alternate government styling itself as the Allied States of America that includes Jericho in its claimed territory.

In addition to the stories of survival and conspiracy, there's some soap opera as characters mix and match while finding ways to keep the lights on and the food supplies coming. There's a type of plotline for everyone.

There are also characters for everyone: the loyal son who cheats on his wife (Eric Green), the wayward son returning from parts unknown (Jake Green), the mysterious newcomer with a very big secret in his basement (Hawkins), the mayor who tries to hold the town together after the attacks (Johnston Green), the IRS auditor from the big city who ends up stuck in the rural town (Mimi), and the young farmer (Stanley) and his deaf sister (Bonnie) who both have enough backbone to stand up to all comers.

The bonus features include a number of episode commentary tracks by producers and actors. These are worth the time if only to hear Lenny James's (who portrays Robert Hawkins) real accent. There are behind the scenes features about special effects and CGI used in the episodes and the construction of the town set along with deleted scenes and the alternative ending to the final episode of the short second season.

The set includes a Bonus Disk that has a few short features about the campaign to reverse the cancellation decision for the show along with quick takes of ""thank yous"" from cast members for the reprieve. The Bonus Disk also includes the alternative final episode that would have been broadcast if the series had been continued. This disk was a disappointment since the alternative ending is already on another DVD as deleted scenes. The space would have been better used for more short features about the development of the series and technical details of its production.

A major part of that effort including sending several tons of peanuts to the offices of CBS to convince them to reconsider their cancellation order. Why peanuts? Watch the episode DVDs and the Bonus DVD to find the answer.

Highly recommended, especially for those who enjoy conspiracy stories.",1479945600,,2852,4.989473684210527

Like so many other fans of the show I was extremely disappointed when it got cancelled not once but twice! Now that I have it both seasons on dvd, I can watch it any time I want. The plot in which terrorist attack with nukes, the story line of how the people of the town reacted and coped with it, and acting of the people portraying the characters, were all excellent. Unlike all other post nuclear attack shows and movies that came before and after Jericho, it is the most believeable depiction of what life in a small town or america for that matter, would be like after a surprise nuke attack. I still can't believe that the ratings were so low that CBS  cancelled it the first season when it had such a huge fan base that wrote enough letters to get it brought back for a second season. Unlike the conspiracy theorists who like the show, I believe that given the fact that Jericho aired just 5 years after 9/11, that the majority of americans were still recovering from the events of 9/11 and were not ready yet to watch a show about a more horrific terrorist attack.

Set during WWII Jericho is a commando team that can perform just about any operation needed behind enemy lines.  I remember being excited to see it in fall of 1965 but our local CBS affiliate didn't carry it because of a local football program.  So I patiently waited for football season to end but Jericho was a midseason casualty (very rare for back then) so I had to wait another 20 years until TNT reran it.  It is finally nice to own it and have all 16 episodes.  It may not be the best adventure series ever but is far from being the worst and can be quite entertaining.,1448841600,2,692,4.204545454545454

And despite some very easily defeated Nazis and (by modern standards) downright silly action sequences, it still succeeds quite well on its terms as light-hearted adventure (with occasional sober moments) performed by an attractive cast, with stock WWII movie footage giving it a needed boost in the special effects department. I would cheerfully watch another dozen episodes, if only they existed.

3400964,5,B001715A92,"In 1966, 2 excellent and similar series premiered on CBS: Mission:Impossible and Jericho.  Mission ran for 7 years and became a tv and film legend.  Jericho was gone after 4 months and is little remembered.  Why?
Jericho was executive produced by Norman Felton, the producer of U.N.C.L.E.  However unlike U.N.C.L.E. which was being played for laughs in its 3rd. (1966) season, Jericho was played straight.
Jericho concerned three allied agents who performed various impossible missions behind the lines during W.W.II.  The American played by Canadian Don Francks (most recently known as ""Walter,"" the weapons expert on the La Femme Nikita tv series,) the Frenchman by Marino Mase, an Italian actor and the Englishman by John Leyton, best known as Charles Bronson's best buddy and the other tunnel king in ""The Great Escape.""
Like Mission:Impossible, the show was exciting and suspenseful.  It featured a great musical theme by Jerry Goldsmith.
The show premiered Thursdays at 7:30 against the highly-rated Daniel Boone on NBC and the still-popular (but for not that much longer) Batman on ABC.  When it did poorly in the ratings, rather than changing its time period as had saved so many other shows like U.N.C.L.E. and Hawaii Five-O, CBS simply cancelled it and it was gone by January.
I watched this show at the time and thought it was on a par with Mission:Impossible.  So many adventure series premiered that 1966 season: Mission, Star Trek, The Time Tunnel, The Green Hornet, etc.  These series are still well-remembered today, Jericho is not.
TNT did rerun this series Friday nights about 2AM during the 1990s, I used to tape it on my VCR.  Well my VCR no longer works but I am happy that I can now order this terrific adventure series on DVD. I highly recommend it.",1433808000,38,1772,4.936026936026936

I love that it was fast paced and exciting, but the thing that I really enjoyed most about it was the character development and the interpersonal things that went on between many characters in the story.

I did find the part about the private contractors or mercenary soldiers that our government uses over in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots interesting.  Of course in the story they are being used in our own country, something the American people would never tolerate.  It is kind of a reminder of the greed and corruption in our government and what is wrong with the system, but I don't believe that it was cancelled for political reasons simply because a lot of interesting and  popular shows are cancelled for no obvious reasons.

3400984,5,B001715A92,"What if? What if your town was one of the few towns to survive a nuclear attack on this country? This is the premiss of Jericho. Jericho is a small town that survives while 23 huge cities are destroyed by nuclear bombs. The country is in chaos and the people of Jericho are cut off from any kind of civilization. Soon food becomes scarce, those who are evil try to take what they won't work for, and people are put to the test of survival in a new country. This first season of Jericho is about survival mostly and about human nature at it's best and worst. The series explores a world gone upside down from the inside out. The show has love, romance, action, drama, and human reaction to the unthinkable. The show has great character development, great story-lines, and a point that cannot be overlooked. The fans fought and won an extra season of just 7 episodes that brought this great show to a form of a conclusion. The second season picks up where the first left us hanging at the seasons end, then takes the show in an inevitably different direction. I personally felt the story remained solid in the second season. But, I was unhappy with the direction that the story took. I felt it was less about the people of Jericho and more about the nation and how corporate America has become too controlling of this nation. All in all, the second season did bring us a great conclusion to the series and I cannot complain about that.  I don't recommend buying the first season, because then you would only want to buy the second season. Instead I recommend buying the complete series. It's a great show with a great moral. Buy it, you will be glad you did.

3401010,2,B001715A92,"A decent concept completely undone by . . . well, every other aspect of the show. Sets and effects are often hilariously cheap, notable whenever there's a fire or a flying object of any kind -- these things will often be shot akimbo, in an obvious attempt to disguise the fact that they're badly-drawn cartoons. The writing is clunky and stupid, prone to that worst of Hollywood clichs, to wit, the tendency of characters to describe one another to each other's faces in an attempt to communicate characterization that is not visible in behavior or attitudes. Plotting his hilarious and silly, with characters often doing things for no reason and then departing a location for equally unknowable reasons, as typified by the first season episode ""National Response"", in which the main character desperately tries to extinguish a fire at his brother's house, apparently fails, and then bones out (offscreen) before he has to confront said brother's reaction to the burnt house. (Seriously, ""National Response"" may be the worse episode of television I've ever seen. This plot point is only the tip of the iceberg.) The romances are perfunctory and depressingly typical, as the hunky hero falls into a love triangle before choosing the brainless hot blonde with no personality over the spunky (but, this being television, still hot) brunette who actually does stuff and has a personality and all those annoying things that real women are always up to.

And the acting . . . oh, the acting. Skeet Ulrich isn't exactly Marlon Brando, but he is not alone in grim woodenness, not here, oh no: the actors who play his family are alternately cardboard-bland and shrill; the actor who plays his best friend seems to have taken classes in the Hollywood Cliche School for the Dumb but Sweet; both of the love interests seem to be trying as hard to remember their lines as to give them feeling. And the bit players . . . oh, the bit players. If the world had this many people like these, I would be glad it got nuked. The cast is, basically Shoshannah Stern floating in flat, featureless ocean, acting her poor heart out against the waves.

I was hooked halfway through the first episode when this town and it's citizens realized they had witnessed a nuclear episode of some kind and they began the process of trying to learn exactly what it was and where it came from. The suspense of not knowing if it was an accident, or if it was an attack, or who was responsible was intense. The acting was top notch and the characters were all believable even if some were the kind we love to hate. While it is not a program you can catch here and there or be distracted while you watch, this is a powerful story and it hits close to home when we think of where the world is today with nuclear capabilities and global politics.

3401023,2,B001715A92,"I saw this DVD set available at library and after quickly checking the amazing ratings here on Amazon I picked it up. Like the other two-star reviews I'm also puzzled by the rabid fandom of this show.

The Good: Jericho has a very interesting premise, I can see a producer's eyes light up when coming across a script like this. Much like Stephen King's The Fog, this is about the quiet life in a small town being disrupted by a catastrophe and the uncertainty as they try to figure out what has hit them. There is a large cast of characters and some small twists. There was surely enough promise to make this an EPIC series, unfortunately that's as far as Jericho gets: promise.

The Bad: The bad is most of it. The writing is risible and clich&eacute;d. The acting talent is not uniform; it ranges from very good to wooden, no character ever giving you enough for you to care about them, and the director(s) don't know how to tease you into watching the next episode. And this is what dooms Jericho: the awful directing.

My little rant: the last 10 years have been the golden age of TV series because production companies are FINALLY getting it; giving more creative control to the writers and directors make for better shows. They've abandoned the sacred cow idea of the supremacy of the focus group nonsense, since these just recycled their ideas and didn't really reflect what people want to watch. You can't make a stand-out product by following the same recipe over and over, year after year. This is why series like Battlestar Galactica (with its many faults in the latter seasons), Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead, to name a few, have become a TV phenomenon; they dare to be different. This is also why Jericho fails, by trying to present a brave new world while using the same, trite TV-series recipe that makes for dumbed-down and complacent storylines. Whoever was directing this seemed very beholding to the old, uncreative way of doing a TV series.

The problem is Jericho tries to present a post-apocalyptic world by insisting in treating day-to-day life with the same banality as the day before the explosion. After a catastrophe of that magnitude SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE (anyone who lived through 9-11 -an incident that Jericho tries to capitalize on- knows life didn't feel quite the same for a LONG time) but the good folk of Jericho remain downright indolent. The neighboring city of Denver has apparently been wiped out and no one seems really affected by it; people go to bars, not as refuge or escape, but to kick back, only the main characters have a sense of urgency and most folks treat the whole thing with like a traffic jam.

The perfect example is on episode 2 - when the alarm is raised of the threat of -what they thought would be- acid rain. The episode is divided between frantically finding shelter for people and scenes where the two escaped convicts dressed as patrolmen are trying to... well, it's never clear what their objective is, so they decide that having a casual breakfast and hinting at nookie is better than escaping the inevitable cloud of doom approaching, again: no sense of urgency. At least the quiet, cute and shy ""weird"" kid in love with the spoiled, rich girl finally gets a chance to spend alone time with her through the storm. But as soon as the rains end her friends, whom you'd expect would be huddling with their families at home, show up at her house with the same levity they'd on a regular Saturday afternoon and judge her for hanging out with him, i.e. ""you're hanging out with that loser? Ewww!"" ... because that seems like the most important thing in the world after a nuclear explosion has gone off miles from your town.

And the show goes on like this. Episode after episode.

You're either doing a disaster series/movie or a banal soap opera, and Jericho, to its failure, insists on being both. It doesn't get that some topics are game-changers: if you do a post-apocalyptic scenario then you're turning the world upside down (Walking Dead, The Fog) and life on screen would be rough and bleak. If you combine that with the frivolity and insipidness of Melrose Place you end up with this disaster.",1397088000,6,4170,4.66530612244898
3401024,2,B001715A92,"After reading so  many excellant reviews for this show I made the purchase and looked forward to many hours of being entertained

After watching only the first episode  , I had serious doubts  about this series

I have only watched 7 episodes to date but cannot watch any more as I am bored bored bored by the whole show .

Whist the over concept of an armageddon in the USA has so many interesting possibilities for the shows writers etc , they in main  concentrate  only 10% of each episode on the big picture of what is happening to the USA after nuclear war heads have been expolded at various locations throughout the USA

The rest of the time we have a deputy mayor having an affair , will he won't he leave his wife ( who cares), for the last three episodes the  mayor has had flu !!! some horses being stolen !!!!! ,  people complaining that a broken water  hydrant is ruining their front lawn ,a 15 minute  scene is given to a little girl who has went into a school on fire to collect a doll !!!!!!!! everybody seems to spend all their time in the local bar drinking as if nothing has happened to the country , basically in each episode the story progresses forward very little to hold anyones attention

I am sorry but the dialouge is stilted, abysmal , the characters so wooden  and stereotypical

I can see why  this show was never given a 3rd series when compared to some of the excellant shows out there to watch",1396224000,5,1426,4.320754716981132

This story plays out with such carefully drawn visions of what can come that you immediately begin to draw stark parallels to our world today.  Frightening thoughts about power, greed, treason and complicity through inaction should compel you to scream at the television to take it all back.  You will enjoy the beautiful performances and strong characters, but will also identify with the delicately veiled people present on our own Capitol Hill. I encourage everyone to watch this.

3401037,5,B001715A92,"A creepy and perhaps all too plausible scenario: A small Kansas town pulls together for survival in the wake of surgical, ""insider"" nuclear attacks conducted against major cities throughout the United States by an unidentified enemy.

The show deals with the ensuing societal chaos and upheaval you would expect to see following such an event.

Towns are isolated and cut off from each other, Communications networks are limited (or gone entirely), and nobody really knows who is still alive, how extensive the attack was, or what is happening in other parts of the country.

Though sort of a failure by commercial standards, it had a loyal core audience. I am convinced this show influenced other, later programs, including ""Last Resort"", ""Revolution"",  ""Lost"", and ""The Last Ship.""

However, it was too esoteric and nuanced for many viewers; not enough carnage and action. The show was a bit too slow moving and cerebral at times, and the final episodes sort of shoehorned a seemingly contrived ending into a short window of time. Thus, the series ended weaker than it started for my tastes. Still, if this is the kind of conspiratorial story line you are into, it was a really cool series.",1387929600,,1192,4.94

The story line was fantastic.  I sat in rapt attention nearly every episode.  The actors, individually and collectively, did a fantastic job.  The staging and story lines were also top-notch.  The writing was solid, and frankly I wish the series had gone on and on and on.  29 episodes was just too few, and the story lines left we hoping for more.

I liked that the writers didn't give everything away right away.  I mean, I was as lost as the poor folks in that western Kansas town were, and grasped at every bit of information about what had happened, and what was happening, just like they did.

The writing didn't come across as contrived or formulaic.  Jericho is solid drama.

5 stars, no question.

Oh, I also loved that though there was a significant amount of tension, action, and even some violence here and there that the overall rating was still TV-PG.  Very watchable.

3401083,5,B001715A92,"Please understand.  I do not feel it is possible to better state what others have already stated... That is not my intent.
Now, I did not see this series when it came out, and was 'ressurected', because I could no longer afford TV. Such is life.
Only because of an Amazon Prime membership, which is SO much less expensive than either Netflix OR Hulu; was I able to see it, ""live"" it, and mourn the end of Ssn. 2, Ep. 7;  along with everyone else...
So, Here is my Question:
IF, as is 'hinted' in reviews ( if not right out stated), a commercial broadcaster received pressure to remove the series because of the possibility of television becoming 'too close to real',  why did an independent (say, HBO) not try to pick up the show?
Or, did they try, and possibly get the same pressure to NOT proceed?

This show, so quickly canned, must be far too close for comfort for ""someone"" out there ... is our government agency controlling TV broadcasts that paranoid, that they wholeheartedly believe the American public cannot at least enjoy a 'fictional' story, albeit so beautifully written and played by the cast(s)?  Yes, they made it all feel ""very"" real...and I'm not going to go further with that
But, it makes me wonder (and surely others have wondered long before me) just what was the governing federal agency worried about?
Does ANYONE know?  I feel like the proverbial mushroom being kept in the dark.

3401098,5,B001715A92,"Another criminally underrated show that deserved to air for much longer than 2 seasons. It's right up there with Firefly, Dollhouse, and FlashForward as far as quality of acting and writing goes. But at least the two seasons we got were wonderful, edge-of-your-seat, white-knuckled ride that stayed in my heart and mind for a while.

My only complaint here is that the first few episodes have some pretty silly fallacies (fallout that ""clears"" in 4 days? Ahem). A nuclear apocalypse purist that I am, I rolled my eyes and was tempted to turn it off right then and there. But the show drew me in with great actors, complex characters, and interesting twists and turns. The rest of it proved so good that by the end of the first season all those little imperfections were completely forgiven and forgotten. After that it was ""one more episode... one more episode... one more episode..."" all the way till the end, and sadness once it was over.

I think the main thing this show has going for it is extremely likable characters who aren't cookie-cutter, and whom the average Joe can relate to. There's great chemistry between these actors, lots of great character development that they handle in a great and believable way. I rooted for the good guys, I laughed, I cried. This show is especially relevant now, in this rapidly changing world, where we don't know if tomorrow we may too find ourselves in this situation.

3401104,5,B001715A92,"Jericho: The Complete Series comes housed in a slipcase with the individual releases for the two seasons packed next to each other. There's nothing significant about this set other than the cardboard slip, which has that jaw-dropping image from the series finale as its cover, but it does have a bonus disc full of extra stuff that fans will want to see. We'll tackle that disc in turn, but first the individual season sets:

Season 1:

Inside the cardboard slipcase are three thin-pak cases that house two discs each. Covers for each disc range with the cast of the series, ranging from main to supporting; Jake's present in all of the covers, with Emily Sullivan (Ashley Scott) and Heather Lisinski (Sprauge Grayden) being on two of the three as well. Disc art features a character on each and menus for the show are motionless with only the morse code beeping over the main menu. The presentation of the show is remarkable. Great colors, grain where it's needed and a clear image throughout, the show looks great. The audio, a solid 5.1 mix that actually gets used, is also a nice addition. I'm glad to see that 5.1 seems to be the standard for these TV shows on DVD as it really adds to the viewing experience. There is a lot of needless bass in the show at times, with commercial breaks being sounded by a resounding reverb on more than one occasion. Still, I like bass--obviously, otherwise I wouldn't have bought a subwoofer about three times too big for my room. The back of the packaging states that some things may have been edited out from the original broadcast, but since I didn't watch the show as it aired originally, I don't know what was left out. Moving onto the special features we get a mixture of deleted scenes for twelve separate episodes. All of the deleted scenes come with commentary by producers Dan Shotz and Karim Zreik and there are some really nice things left on the cutting room floor. Mostly character elements, but they're worth watching, especially if you're a fan of the series. Next up are five commentaries on ""Pilot: The First Seventeen Hours"", ""Fallout"", ""Rogue River"", ""Red Flag"" and ""Vox Populi."" All of the commentaries are fun to listen to, with Skeet Ulrich and Lennie James being the biggest clowns on the tracks. Executive producers Jon Turtletaub and Carol Barbee keep the tracks on-topic with comments about the production of the specific episodes and other technical aspects. ""Building Jericho"" is your typical making-of featurette with interviews from cast and crew. We do get to see a lot of the set that we don't normally see, which is very cool--it takes some of ""wow"" factor out of the show when you realize it's all on a sound stage, but how they hide everything and still manage to make it look as great as it does is a true testament to the technical team working on the show. The actors chime in with their comments on the show and how much fun it is to work on it. There's back-patting all around and not a single mention of the show being cancelled at one point. Guess they're saving that for the second season DVD, complete with a full count of how many nuts were sent to CBS. The final extra is a ""What If?"" extra that is a ""revealing look at how the nuclear arms race evolved since the end of World War II."" This extra isn't really related to the show other than the nuclear aspect and it doesn't do much else than scare the bejesus out of the viewer. Nuclear war is always a scary prospect and this documentary doesn't do much to help ease the fear--in fact, it does the opposite. Overall the series has a solid representation on DVD. Fans will be able to watch their favorite episodes over and over while they wait for the second season to premiere (as of this writing it is still unscheduled) and it will hopefully bring in a few new fans (I already plan on lending out my copy to help rope in a few more viewers) so that the show can have a very successful return to air. Recommended.

Season Two:

Jericho's second season comes housed in a two-disc amaray DVD case without a slipcover or insert. Jake gets center stage on the cover as well as the DVD menus and disc descriptions are placed on the reverse of the DVD insert, behind the discs. The video and audio presentation is identical to what we got on the first season set: clean, clear and without flaw. The image is a tad soft, but I think that's just me being used to Blu-ray's and overly critical of DVD transfers now. The extras for this set start out on the first disc and don't stop until the second (not really saying much considering there's only two discs, but still). Each of the seven episodes feature commentary with Jonathan E. Steingberg and a mix of other crew and all but one episode (""Jennings & Rall"") feature deleted scenes. The commentaries are all insightful and a treat to listen to considering the first season set, containing sixteen episodes, contained commentary on only five of the episodes, so it's quite the rare occurrence to have commentary on everyone of the episodes (unless you're The Simpsons). Fans of the show will want to check the commentaries out for nuggets of information that aren't available anywhere else...not to mention the general fun mood of the commentaries, which translate into an entertaining listen as well. There's also an alternate unaired ending cut of the finale that's included here as well that has a different commentary track starting at around the third act of the episode. Next are the deleted scenes for the episodes: ""Reconstruction"" (1:25), ""Condor"" (1:12), ""Oversight"" (0:57), ""Termination for Cause"" (1:02), ""Sedition"" (3:47), and ""Patriots and Tyrants"" (6:17). As you can see the scenes get lengthier as the episodes go about and each one of them has commentary to accompany it and discussion on why certain things were cut. Also included here is the ""Alternate Ending for Series"" (25:11), which also has commentary and is simply clipped from the alternate unaired ending version of ""Patriots and Tyrants."" Following that there is a pair of featurettes: ""Rebuilding Jericho"" (25:56) and ""Nut Job"" (9:46). ""Rebuilding"" talks about the return to the set and the changes that needed to be made to the show to meet its new shorter shoot schedule as well as smaller budget. ""Nut Job"", of course, revolves around the fan effort to deluge CBS with peanuts. I'm not sure what this show will go down in history more for: being a highly entertaining and original show or for the Nuts campaign. Either way these two extras reflect an incredible amount of love for the fans, as without them this second season set wouldn't even have happened. From the very first episode till the last it was on the edge of your seats action-drama series. This is a must have for action-drama lovers. 5 star all the way.",1354320000,,6786,4.671404682274248

I do not understand why this one was cancelled so quickly.

However, I am especailly appreciative to the producers and writers that they supplied a reasonable ending even if it came all too soon... and then gave us an alternate ending to allow for some of us to continue the story through a new form of media (graphic novels). Granted this is not the best TV show I have ever seen, but it deserved a better chance to continue. I definately finished season two wanting more.",1349654400,2,809,4.6573426573426575

3401118,5,B001715A92,"Jericho is a gripping drama of the aftermath of partial US destruction via limited nuclear detonations.  It follows the effects on life in a small middle of the US town not directly impacted by the explosion, but suffering the collapse of the easy life and modern comforts we've all grown to expect and depend upon.  My family was never able to watch just one episode - we were immediately drawn into the story and the characters' lifes and had to ""play the next episode"" to find out how the current issue resolved.  Warning: This series is addictive!  While the storyline in this case follows limited nuclear weapons detonation, it could easily have been set up with a biological outbreak or economic collapse as foil and the story would have been just as riveting.  It is not only a great series with excellent writing and acting, it can be seen as a superb cautionary tale for what may occur in the US if we continue on the reckless ""spend 50% more than you make"" trajectory that the politicians have set and the international loans that keep this nation afloat are suddenly cut off.",1340236800,,1086,4.635416666666667

3401123,5,B001715A92,"Jericho was a near future sci fi TV series set in Jericho, a small farm and mining town in Kansas.  The isolated location of this town, allowed it to survive a national catastrophe, the destruction of 23 major U.S. cities by terrorist planted nuclear bombs. The series mixes the post apocalyptic story of the town's adaptation to end of the world with the discovery of the secrets of the true perpetrators of the attack. There are lots of plot twists and turns and action sequences. The scathing caricatures of government contractors run amok, and of corporate and political corruption at high levels still seem relevant. Maybe more so today than when the series aired. It's well written and the actors did a good job with their roles. Their characters lives and interactions are more complex than first appear. The fans demanded the short second season and the team put out a great effort, packing a lot of big screen action and drama into the small screen episodic format. My set also included an additional separate bonus disc, and there is optional commentary and deleted scenes for all episodes. Also, there is background material included.

Brad Beyer who plays his best friend Stanely, that even after five years still accepts him and Shoshannah Stern who plays Stanley's deaf sister, walks away with all respect for the way she plays this roll.  Then we have Lennie James who ends up a somewhat friend to Jake because of the deep desire to make amends for all the wrongs that he and everyone else perceive that he has made.

(SPOILER ALERT): The story begins with the defiant rebellious youngest son of the current Jericho's Mayor mysteriously shows up after five years of unknown whereabouts. The story is centered on an after math when ""the bombs"" was dropped and divided the United States governments. A little town in Kansas called Jericho is left to defend itself against waring neighboring towns, nomadic wanderers, gangsters..etc. and at the same time they're trying to keep Democracy alive within and remain civilize. The story implies that when us human are stripped of everything our only instinct is to feed and survive no matter the cost. I like how the story shows that even in the midst of all the chaos where there are no rules or law that are still good people who with fight to maintain law and order and be ""civilize"". This show is way better than ""LOST"". I'm a movie buff and I would rank this #1 on my 20 years list.

Interestingly, since this show was mainstream network, it demonstrates vividly that an exciting and intense drama can be developed without the kind of gross overuse of obscenities, extreme violence, blood & gore and graphic sex that the writers of series on paid channels like HBO and Showtime seem to feel they MUST use since they CAN. (For example, Dexter is a great show but if his sister uses the F* word one more time in her ordinary conversation, my shoe is going thru the TV box!) My only quibble involves the occasional weak plot device such as having critical electronics like laptops and communication devices not protected by passwords so a passer-by can uncover earth-shattering secrets with the press of a button. But I guess the writer could always have found another device to disclose the secrets, in order to keep the story moving, so I forgive them! HIGHLY recommended, wish it hard run for more seasons!",1322784000,,1016,4.982352941176471
3401142,5,B001715A92,"When this show was on TV I worked nights so I never had the opportunity to watch it.  I don't own the DVD's but discovered that the show suddenly appeared on Netflix.  I eagerly sat through every episode within a 3 day period, devouring the show as I felt I would when I had seen the promos.

I love post-apocalyptic horror/drama, and boy did this fit the bill.  I was a bit leery as I'm not a big fan of Skeet Ulrich, but in this show he really grew on me.  I was unfamiliar with many of the actors, which actually made the show better.  It reminded me of ""Alas Babylon"" revisited.  Sudden nuclear holocaust takes out most of the US leaving few small towns left standing.  This series follows the trials and tribulations of the small town of Jericho as they attempt to rebuild their town, defend it from vicious attackers, feed it's citizens, get the power on, and figure out just what happened in the world. If you watch it, you will find yourself watching show after show into the wee hours of the morning.

Though some of the characters are a little week, I did enjoy the majority of them.  I didn't find too many cringe worthy lines or utterly absurd moments (I don't watch much TV because of it).  What I was happy to see was a very plausible reaction of a small town to a major catastrophe.  The trials they faced felt all too real, and their individual reactions (many of which were things I would never do) did remind me of how many people would react in that situation.

Was this the perfect show?  No, first of all it was only a season and a half.  Although the final episode does give an ending, I was left wanting so much more.  Second the acting in parts was very TV movie, but most of the leads did fantastic jobs, with one scene in the second season almost bringing me to tears.  I was not overly thrilled with the very first episode, but by the third I was officially hooked.

I can envision myself watching this show again from beginning to end in a year or so when it will feel shiny and new again.  Rarely do I feel engaged in a TV show, this one pulled me in and kept me furiously watching until the end.  I gave this 5 stars because of how it pulled me in and kept me there.

There is blood, and there are killings, and this is far too adult for the kiddies to enjoy, but I loved it.",1320105600,3,2305,4.20501138952164

3401146,5,B001715A92,"This is my 1st review from several purchases of boxed sets from Amazon, but I felt compelled to give my opinion on this series.

Jericho is your worst nightmare come true. Multiple nuclear bombs are set off in key cities throughout the United States. Jericho is a small town with good small town morals that has to deal with this crisis. The citizens saw the mushroom cloud of one of the cities and find out that there was at least one more bomb set off in Georgia. But they are isolated, without power or communication and they don't know how many more bombs may have been set off. Jericho is a very emotional series that deals with right versus wrong, and how one small town tries to maintain their morals. There are a lot of twists and turns you don't see coming. For example: is there a terrorist living among them?

Jerisho deals with emotions and several moral decisions. But it is also an informative series as well. What should one do if nuclear fallout is headed your way? What happens when your town runs out of food as no deliveries are being made?  How do you battle a neighboring town, thugs travelling from town to town, or a new self proclaimed government? How do you rebuild your once peaceful town?

The writing is good, and the acting is great. Skeet Ulrich gave an outstanding performance as the once bad boy of Jericho who returns as a good man. (He's also not bad on the eyes for you female viewers, and we do get to see him wrapped in a towel!)

I missed Jericho when it was aired on TV and I am so pleased the fans demanded a second season when it was cancelled after the first season. There are plenty of extras on this set including an alternate unaired ending from the season finale.

This is just another example of an excellent series being cancelled before it's time, and probably replaced by some new ""reality"" show that makes most of us want to puke. Jericho grips you from the start and you hate to see it end. If you want entertainment and information, this is the series for you.",1317513600,2,2013,4.412398921832884

3401148,5,B001715A92,"while the show takes a lot of liberties - like the ones some people mention, for instance - that's part of telling a good story. you choose to not focus on certain things so you can focus on others. this is such a story.
and while there's a lot of ""well, they could have just done that!"" or ""how can they possibly look like that!"" ... everything within the story IS within the realm of possibility. there are no gaping logic holes - stretches of the imagination, sure - but things MAKE SENSE. and that's much more than can be said for most of tv and movies.

And incidentally, people weren't walking around in rags and filth before washing machines were invented, you know. There isn't a single thing in my closet that I can't wash, dry, and iron without any electricity at all. so for those people who will always complain in shows like this that folks are too clean or too good looking... well, maybe you should use your imagination and creativity a little more instead of depending on appliances :)",1312243200,,1001,4.469945355191257

JERICHO is so much more than a ""Red Dawn"" adventure.  It so accurately portrays with startling realism the chaos and panic that would ensue when our nation loses almost 25 cities in nuclear bombings.  It shows the decay of morals and civility within a country when your focus becomes water, food, fuel, electricity, and medicine.  Without these necessities, life deteriorates within days.

The acting and plot lines were magnificent.  Absolutely every single actor and writer should feel proud to have worked on this series. Bravo!!  I believe that it will stand out as one of the best television shows of the decade.

3401159,5,B001715A92,"It all began with mysterous mushrooms growing in the clouds, and developed into something that was quite the interesting thing. From the problems that came with needs to the things that people held onto because they hoped beyond hope that things like family and cities and nationalism could survive, Jericho quickly grew. It brought up a lot of things that series like to leave out, like what happens when a community wants a piece of your land so they can feed themselves or if one person has the right to hold a town almost at gunpoint because they own a store that happened upon some food along the way. Combine that with one of the most intriguing characters you'll ever see hiding in the background (he was one of those people you wanted to figure out, wanted to believe, but really didn't ever know for cerrtain), with flashes of brillance in the form of skirmishes that turned into mortar rounds and that turned into warfare, and with streaks racing through the sky and little glimpses of the world in a few frames and you have something that existed wonderfully - if briefly - on a channel that didn't love it enough.

In Jericho, I found a great thing because this was more than a normal series. It didn't place faith in filler and it didn't really place trust in things happening matter-of-factly. The acting got better as the series went on, the characters got more interesting as you got to know them, and Jericho got more pressing as their wants and needs began to get bigger. The way they thought was beautiful, too, from the reasons you needed to take the logos off of vehicles to the pressing notion of love, loss, and alcohol on a town that didn't value most of these things enough before - whatever it is - begins developing. You don't know what it is developing either, and that;'s a great thing. honestly, I liked that most of all.

If you need the whole series in one sweep, this is a good way to do it. If not, perhaps you should look into other avenues but you'll still want to finish it out. After watching some of it you'll see why the fan following was so dedictated to their show, too, and why cancellation was fought off for a time by peanuts for thousands upon thousands of fans simply because they liked what they saw.
The sea of channels seems littered with the static of beautiful sdhows - that is one thing I have begun noticing more and more as time presses on. This is just another 5-star example of that hideously unfair thing.",1290729600,,2463,4.495535714285714
3401160,5,B001715A92,"Network TV needs to re-evaluate how it determines which shows to cancel and which to keep.  Jericho joined the ranks with Miracles and FireFly as excellent entertainment shut down by idiots in power.  At this time, the only network show I watch and enjoy is Castle and I'm sure some overpaid suit will cancel it before it's time.

Jericho is not only entertaining and thrilling but thought provoking.  What would you do, how would you react if nuclear bombs went off in America?  If you were in a small town, which town would you wish to be part of - Jericho or New Bern?  What would you do if you were caught in the wrong town?  How far would you go to protect yourself, your family and your property from your neighbors?  How far would your humanity stretch and when would it break?

These were the same questions I asked myself after reading (then watching) The Stand by Stephen King.  Would I stay put?  Would I try to get to my family who live over a thousand miles away?  Of my things, material things, what would I take if I had to leave?  Would I be able to defend myself?  Would I be smart and lucky enough to survive?

I think it's interesting, and honest, that in the case of both Jericho and The Stand, our own government became our, and their own, downfall.  The greed, corruption and stupidity of those in power is quite frightening in the real world.  I'm not sure it's a large stretch from real world to Jericho or The Stand.",1289260800,,1441,4.377358490566038

3401163,5,B001715A92,"""Jericho"" is a frightening story about America after a devastating nuclear terrorist attack against 23 US cities.  The small town of Jericho -- 5000 souls, is not touched directly by the nuclear attack.  The national power and information grid is gone, and the industrial and agricultural back of the nation is broken.

One of the strongest aspects of ""Jericho"" are the superb characterizations. The cast in this series is excellent, and does a fabulous job of transporting the viewer into a scenario that is all too believable and even plausible.  People in this series act like real people, not Hollywood cut-outs.  Season One ends with a weird scenario in which certain Western States combine into the ""Allied States of America"" with a creepy new flag and a plan to shred the Constitution -- beginning with the Second Amendment's promise of the right to keep and bear arms.  Nothing blew my mind half as much as the close-up of this new flag, which promised ""a new direction"" for the Nation.

Hollywood could not resist a few stupid and pointless jabs at the right-wing of this country, but I refused to allow this obnoxious Hollywood trait to interfere with my enjoyment of this superb series.  No spoilers here, but if you watch the series you will see that to which I refer.

It is highly regrettable that this series did not make it into Season Three.  ""Jericho"" is a find, and it caters to the thoughtful viewer.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1286668800,4,1447,4.790322580645161

Making a bad situation go to worse, another nuclear bomb explodes high in the atmosphere resulting in an electro-magnetic pulse, shockwave, that fries over 90% of electronic instruments computers and cell phones over a ""hundreds of miles"" radius. The towns-folk of Jericho are then forced to band together for mutual survival and to fight off groups of maurading thieves, mercenaries and killers. Even a decleared war from a neighboring town that wants to forceably take their meager survival provisions! This series is very thought-provoking and scary! We may be on the verge of something like this in the near future. This series is a must-see for all survivalists! The action and suspense will have you wondering just what would you do in a similar situation!",1282521600,11,1158,5.85207100591716

3401182,5,B001715A92,"I never watched Jericho on TV.  I never DVR'd it.  I had heard the hype, which generally causes my fanboy-repulsion-reflex to kick in (although Battlestar and Firefly are two of my favorites, so maybe I'm not immune).

So we Netflixed it recently, and by about episode 2, we were hooked.  The acting, the story, the action sequences, and even the effects are all top notch, by any standards.  By the end of Season 1, I was very skeptical that they could wrap this whole complex and layered plot up.

But they did.  In 7 short episodes of Season 2, things speed up and take on a more epic, desperate tone, and ultimately end up resolving themselves, more or less.  So don't be afraid of Jericho, thinking you are getting involved in yet another doomed TV show that was too good for the general population and badly marketed by the network.  There IS closure  on this one, and in my opinion, when the final credits roll, you will agree this is one of the most original and well executed action/dramas that has been on TV.

And it took the 2nd season to make it so.  I can completely understand why fans went ""nuts"" at the close of S-1, but I think all of us fans will now rest, perhaps, a little easier.  Jericho is a series you will want to make a cornerstone of your collection, without a doubt.",1236902400,7,1295,4.390756302521009
3401183,2,B001715A92,"Who doesn't enjoy a post apocalyptic story, show, movie etc. I know I do and when I first heard about this show I couldn't wait to see it.  Unfortunately after seeing the first six or seven episodes I realized, this show is terrible.  I do not understand why most of the other reviews are so positive.
ACTING- 1.5 out of 4 (a few of them are not terrible actors)
STORYLINE- 1 out of 4 (The town elders realize at the last minute that the hospital generator will be out of gas in a few hours.  They race to get fuel from nearby town to keep the hospital generator running, que dramatic music while the camera follows a gas delivery truck driving to and from the other town. Don't worry, they make it back in time for life support machines.)
LOGIC- there is none! I could go on and on about the head scratching lack of logic in every episode I saw.  For example three men hijack an armed truck on horseback.  The driver and passenger didn't think to step on it or use their guns.  Later 4 good guys take on 8 bad guys armed with automatic rifles.  Stop me if you've heard this terrible TV writing cliche before,  good guys firing from behind the trucks wheels are not hit, the tires don't even get hit, but the bad guys end up dead.
Never did I get a sense this was a post apocyliptic world.  Sure there's no power so no lights or heat or hot water.  Yet everybody in this bumpkin town dresses in nice expensive clean good looking clothing.  Good to know the laundrymat's still open.  Everyone always looks freshly showered, the womens makeup is always perfect.  If anything I think for most of the shows characters, this whole nuclear annihalation thing is just an irritating little side show to what's going on in their daily lives.  Did I mention the acting is really bad?
I have only seen about half of the first season because I finally just had to skip to the season 1 ending so maybe the episodes I skipped plus season 2 were better then the ones I saw, or maybe their not.

P.S. If your looking for a good apocalyptic story to read, buy Robert McCammon's Swan Song, and if you enjoy that, buy almost any other book by Robert McCammon",1236556800,22,2139,4.339195979899498

3401192,4,B001715A92,"I have to preface this review by revealing that I do not watch TV. That's right, America, I actually do not watch TV. Oh, I have a great, big, 42"" LCD HDTV, but I choose to only use that for watching DVDs because, quite frankly, commercial TV sucks. Having said that, I do have a membership to NetFlix, so I have previewed a few TV shows there because they are commercial free. My most recent discovery is ""Jericho"".

I originally played the first episode because I am a fan of Skeet Ulrich (Jake Green). Many have referred to Skeet as a poor man's Johnny Depp, but I think Skeet is just a little more relaxed with his performances since he doesn't have so much pressure to be the big Hollywood star. Add Gerald McRaney as Skeet's father (Johnston Green) and mayor of the town and top it with the tough as nails mom who just can't wait to bake you a homemade pie, Pamela Reed (Gail Green), and you have an instant winner.

I can't say enough about this show. I love the fact that Jericho is a speck of a town in the middle of Kansas that chooses not to fall apart during the worst disaster in the history of the United States. The people of Jericho simply ""get it"". Towns surrounding them have fallen into anarchy while Jericho celebrates Thanksgiving, manages to keep their grocery store in business, and still feels it is important to go out and vote. This isn't just an apocalyptic tale of death and chaos, it's a family story from the word go.  Ulrich's Jake Green has just returned to town from a self-imposed exile when the whole world gets turned upside down. Throughout the first few episodes we see the uncomfortable silences between Jake and his father. We also watch as the friendship between Jake and his brother, Eric (Kenneth Mitchell), slowly rebuilds. Of course, what end of the world tale would be complete without the ""boy sees girl he has always loved but now she is engaged to someone else"" arc?

Buy this boxed set if you want to sit down and have a literal marathon of excellent TV. I know CBS cancelled the show mid-second season, but let me tell you, the suits at the Eye are idiots and should all be fired. This is TV worth watching. There are film makers out there who should watch this little show and take notes. The soundtrack alone is worth the purchase. My favorite musical finds are Coldplay's ""Til Kingdom Come"" and Damien Rice's ""9 Crimes"" which played during the perfectly choreographed final scene of season two, episode four, ""Oversight"".

Of course, this is just my humble opinion, but I think CBS might actually take me seriously once they see the film I'm working on. If that happens, I'll make sure Jericho gets a second chance!",1229558400,38,2669,4.5175983436853

3401197,5,B001715A92,"I really like television shows like ""Lost"", ""Damages"" and others that are not the standard fare.

""Jericho"" fits right in with these with its basic concept of what happens if something strange,  in this case a nuclear disaster, happens.

The characters were well developed and the mystery of what was going on was addictive.  Story lines were solid and the writers were not adverse to providing some shocks along the way.

The second season may not have been quite as good as the first season, but it was probably due to the strike and the fact the show was always in a difficult position as to whether it would be renewed.  So the second season seemed just a bit rushed in that respect.

Like some other shows I wish were around longer I was dissapointed to see it was not renewed for a third season.

3401198,5,B001715A92,"As a fan of the show while it aired on CBS, I am not completely objective.  However, I will say that I am a busy person with little time for TV, but this show captivated me and pulled me in from the beginning.  Though the post-apocalyptic theme may have viewers thinking that it's a death, doom and destruction-type show, it's much more than that.

Jericho is a study in the 'character' of the characters and how disaster can either bring out the worst or the best in individuals.  The show also showcases how the values related to home, love, family, community, teamwork, and compassion still ring true -- no matter how dire the circumstances and even if the world as we know it is no more.

I enjoyed seeing some familiar faces like Skeet Ulrich, Gerald McRaney, Esai Morales, Alicia Coppola, etc., as well as getting to know many new ones to me, like Brad Beyer, Lennie James, Ashley Scott, Bob Stephenson, and others.  There's no more handsome, heroic, and yet flawed ""prodigal son"" than Skeet's Jake Green, no better moral compass than McRaney's Mayor Green, and no badder, more awesome mystery man than James' Robert Hawkins.

Jericho is a town not unlike ones in which we grew up, and the townsfolk are very similar to people you know. And because of that, it forces you to confront the question of ""What if.....? What would I do if this happened to me?""

Jericho is still too much of an undiscovered gem for too many people.  Do yourself a favor and figure out why, even after two TV cancellations, this show still has such a staunch fan base that insists the Jericho story continue.",1220745600,21,1591,4.593639575971731

The writing is so absurd and the directing so poor that every episode, no, make that every moment, of this ridiculously implausible tale of post apocalyptic horror strains credulity. The writers never miss an opportunity to turn the most mundane moments into contrived and grossly overwrought drama. The townspeople seem to be oblivious to the fact that the world as we know it has ended as they live their most vapid and useless lives. Its like Saved by the Bell with guns. You won't care if everybody dies. In fact, youll probably be hoping for it like I was. None of what you see is remotely plausible. Everything is intended to drive more and more unnecessary and unrealistic drama. Its very obvious that the writers have zero practical knowledge of the subject matter and would be better suited to writing for the Hallmark channel. Sadly, after sticking it out to the end, hoping for redemption, there isn't even one thing about this series that makes it worth watching.

No clear reason why someone should get excited to something, that is already available. Dumb",1523232000,,269,4.0

8264534,5,B001715A92,"I love this show. I've watched it several times. It's the first series I remember that questioned the use of contractor mercenaries to fight our wars and also questioned the use of torture. Lennie James and Skeet Ulrich are terrific in this show. James went on to The Walking Dead.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002), and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1521158400,,1729,5.6937984496124034
