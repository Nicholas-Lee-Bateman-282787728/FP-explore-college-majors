1342095,5,B00004RESK,When I was Watching this pay-per view i fast forward through atleast half the matches so the actual pay per view matches sucked except for Booker T vs Jeff Jarret. I gave this pay per view a 5 star for vince russo. What he did to Hulk Hogan was offf the hook. I mean he did to him wat im sure even Eric Bischooff ANd Vince Mcman wanted to do. And then the unbelieveble speech that was not planned ever. I really felt were Russo was coming from.......how the wrestlers that actually wrestle and care about the business are being held down. Russo ripped Hogan a new one on T.v. THis was great. And im even a hogan fan but Russo was right! If ur going to buy this Bash at the Beach buy it for Hogan and russo saga and the Booker T Jarret World title match!,1104105600,2,753,4.094594594594595

WCW Tag Team Championship match: Kronik Vs The Perfect Event

out all the stops but Kanyon gets the win with interference
from Jarrett. 8/10
United States Heavyweight Title Match: Scott Steiner Vs Mike

7920770,4,B00004RESK,"This PPV at the time when it aired in July 2000  seemed under whelming to say the least little did Pro Wrestling fans know how bad
pro wrestling would be less then 5 years later
This was during the heated Monday Night War (when both WCW & WWF were drawing record numbers) and there was a 3rd somewhat mainstream promotion in ECW
The AOL Time Warner merger had yet to take effect for WCW the other shoe had yet to drop

1. Lt. Loco vs Juventud Guerrera  (WCW Cruiserweight Championship)  solid 4 star lucha style match,
2.  Big Vito vs Norman Smiley and Ralphus  (Handicap match for the Hardcore Championship) terrible ECW gimmick match waste of Norman Smiley...
3. Daffney (with Crowbar)  vs Ms. Hancock (with David Flair)  **Gimmick T&A match decent you get Daffney and a young Stacy Keibler doing the silly Ms Hancock censor character
4. KroniK vs  The Perfect Event  ( WCW World Tag Team Championship) 3 star match
5. Kanyon vs  Booker T  (great 5 star singles match between two of the most underrated stars in WCW)
6. Mike Awesome vs  Scott Steiner  ( WCW United States Heavyweight Championship) better then you'd think the two work off each other surprisingly good
7. Vampiro  vs The Demon  (Graveyard match) Vampiro being miss used in a average but, silly gimmick ""Undertaker style"" match
8.  Shane Douglas vs Buff Bagwell  (Shane carries this match) you realize very quick how horrible Buff is in the ring
9. Hollywood Hogan vs Jeff Jarrett  ( WCW World Heavyweight Championship) Hogan used his creative control contract to refuse to put Jarrett over which leads to a horrible incident where  Vince Russo had Jarrett lie down for Hogan....
Which leads into a seemly legit uncensored shoot on the state of WCW and Hogan
Russo publicly fires Hogan this all seems legit since Hogan did sue Russo
Vince Russo is a huge dirt bag but, this meltdown is the first time he actually made sense
10. Goldberg vs  Kevin Nash  (Scott Hall's contract on the line) terrible match between two monster that both kind of suck in the ring! maybe 6-8 moves ever used...
11. Booker T vs Jeff Jarrett  (WCW World Heavyweight Championship II) very good match 3.5 Stars

This PPV now is a interesting time capsule of WCW less then a year before they would be bought and the legacy would be assassinated by the WWE
It has a handful of duds but, it also has some stand out matches
I'm not sure if the WWE has ever played this complete PPV uncut and uncensored on there titanic style ""network""
Since they love to spin it that WCW was all garbage and they won!  worth checking out to see what WCW was all about  7.5/10",1452470400,,2596,4.564935064935065
7920771,3,B00004RESK,"Though controversial, The great thing about this night were two things. The first was Booker T winning the title for the first and becoming the new face of the dying wcw. By this time, Booker was so over with the crowd that he deserved to be a world champ but it was too bad that it came at a time where the company was floundering. The 2nd was Russo. Though Russo is not the smartest tool in the shed, he was right about one thing and that was when he said that guys like Booker T couldn't get any opportunity because of guys like Hogan. Even though Hogan pretty much made wrestling what it is today and i have great respect for him for that, he also didn't help get any rising stars over because of his massive ego and obsession with being on top. What was wcw thinking in giving him the creative control clause? Despite that, the right man walked out with the title while one man finally got what was coming to him",1452470400,,917,4.215909090909091
7920772,3,B00004RESK,"The show starts off with Ernest Cat Miller stepping out of a limo in the parking lot and saying that the Misfits In Action are banned from ringside in the opening Cruiserweight Championship Match.

1.) WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match: Juventud Guerrera w/The Filthy Animals vs Lt. Loco (c) w/Misfits In Action

While Lt. Loco (Chavo Guerrero) was the champion, he didn't enter the match with the championship as it had been stolen by Juventud prior to the PPV. This was a fine paced match with Juventud and Loco pretty much getting every spot in the match to perfection. Nearing the end, MIA come through the crowd in masks to distract the referee. Tony Schiavone tries to insult the fans' intelligence by doubting whether or not it's MIA under the masks. While the ""masked hooligans"" distract the referee, Major Gunns comes down to ringside and distracts Juventud, who was on the top turnbuckle, by ripping her shirt off. Loco knocks Juventud off the top rope and drills him with a Reverse Suplex for a close 2 count. In the end, Loco gets the win with a Tornado DDT on Juventud",1436400000,,1084,4.73015873015873

7920774,4,B00004RESK,"If you ask me, this is the last great WCW event. This isn't a front-to-back great card, but there's a mix of everything people enjoyed about wrestling at the time and even some legitimately shocking moments. The surprises make this event the best of WCW 2000 and the last time fans had even a sliver of hope that the ship would right itself. It wasn't to be, but the momentary excitement was appreciated by this WCW fan.

That's not to say there wasn't crap on this show because there certainly was; an bimbo T&A match and a couple weak matches bring this down a notch, yet the event survives these missteps because the good stuff is SO good!

Kanyon and Booker T had a good match on the undercard as did Scott Steiner and Mike Awesome while the Cruiserweight Title and Tag Team Titles match were good enough to keep the event flowing. Even the Vampiro/Demon Graveyard Match added something to the show in spite of it being a pale imitation of Sting and Vampiro's graveyard encounter months before.

The meat of this event was the shoot promo from Vince Russo and the faux Title match between Hogan and Jarrett that still elicits controversy from fans. The subsequent World Title match with Booker T and Jarrett brings down the house and caps off the night with a great, feel-good moment.

Even compared with WCW's shows from their heyday, this one remains a truly memorable event, resurrecting a Bash at the Beach's glory for one final send off.",1407024000,,1446,4.614785992217898
7920775,5,B00004RESK,"I love this ppv. I was one of the few that liked The Goldberg Heel Turn. I liked seeing Nash as The Face against The Heel Goldberg. I thought it was cool and different. I thought WCW got the jump on WWF by turning their Top Guy Heel. We all thought Stone Cold might have been turning Heel when he returned to WWF. It was fresh but Goldberg's heart wasn't in it. Goldberg did a good job being a Heel I thought. I was so excited for his match against Nash. I wish the match was longer but it was still good. It was a typical Goldberg match. I think Goldberg would have had a good Heel run but in the state WCW was in I think it was best he was the Face.

  The other match on here that makes it an awesome ppv is Booker T vs Jarrett. It was a great match. This match alone is worth it as it was great to see Booker T Win The Belt. There were a lot of guys in 96-98 in WCW who could have been World Champion that were buried in midcard so it was nice to see a deserving wrestling get it. Jim Ross always takes a dig at Booker T for not being a Ric Flair type champion Booker T put on some great tv title matches that were better than a lot of main events on WCW. Booker T of course after this had a good run. He picked up a win over Goldberg, beat Jarrett and beat Nash in an awesome Cage match at Fall Brawl.

  Now to breakdown the other matches. Mike Awesome vs Scott Steiner. That was great. Awesome was getting a good push after he left ECW for WCW. I think Awesome should have atleast US Champion. This was a great match though two power guys going at. I do think Big Poppa Pump was long overdue for a title run. I think he was a better Heel than Jarrett. He would have been better to use as the Top Heel. One thing that was good about WCW in the end was Pump being the Champion in the last days.

  Vito vs Smiley was great. Vito was an underrated wrestler. This match was great based on entertainment alone as Norman always playing the scared sissy that you love to cheer for. Daffney vs Stacy Keblier was great. Those two were great. I think in real life those two didn't care for each other so that added to the match. Daffney was a great wrestler and character who really should have been in wrestling longer and more regularly. Keblier had a great run in WWE. The Vampiro vs Demon match was meh. It was not the best. Vampiro was a decent worker and good character but not in the same league as a guy like Sting. I was glad Vampiro got the opportunities though.

  Shane Douglas vs Buff Bagwell was a good match. I liked those two as a tag team they should have stayed a tag team longer but both really did need to be in single. Buff never got a World Title run and I think he was good enough to be champion. He had a great match with DDP at WCW Souled Out. Buff got no World Title shots at all. Douglas had a successful WCW run winning the US Belt which I think was a big accomplishment. Douglas never became a big star in WWE or WCW but he was a good worker. I thought he had some good matches in WCW but he was best in ECW.

  Kanyon RIP vs Booker T was a great match. Kanyon was a good wrestler not the greatest ever but I liked his character. DDP may have helped him in getting a push. I think Kanyon should have won a few singles titles in WCW. Booker T as usual put on a great match and gave the fans their money worth. The Russo Shoot was historic. It was maybe a low point as it was a bad move. They should have had the match. If Hogan didn't want to lose he could win by DQ or something. They could find another way for Booker T to face JJ on the PPV. I don't blame Hogan for not wanting to lose to JJ. But the end result Booker T walks away champion which what was best for WCW at the time.

  In the end you can see this as another turning point in the end of WCW or a fun PPV. I like it for Booker T winning the belt. I thought that signaled a new era. Although it didn't last it was new. I loved The Goldberg Nash Match as it was more the build that sold it for me. The match was not as good as Starrcade but it was a fun match. I enjoy WCW until the end. I was an interesting last year of WCW. Cheers and Enjoy!",1402358400,,4134,3.907032181168057
7920776,3,B00004RESK,"This was the end of WCW. Ok short matches. Could have been a good ppv but all anyone remembers is Vince Russo shoot on Hulk Hogan. Whether you like Hogan or not he put wrestling on the map. For anybody who thought Hogan was an ego maniac he was overshadowed by Vince ""the joke"" Russo on this night. This is the last WCW ppv appearance of Hulk Hogan. If you are a fan of wrestling history purchase this ppv. But don't spend more than $30. Not worth anything more than that because of the weak, short in-ring action.",1379462400,,514,4.255102040816326

7920778,2,B00004RESK,"There were some fun matches on this card so for that I will give it two stars, because if it were not for those matches i would consider this one of the worst PPV's in history.

Russo thought he was going to be so cool and creative and try to trick the fans into thinking he tricked hulk hogan and some people actually believed it! Tony and the other commentators repeat over and over ""wow, this is real life folks"" while Russo talks about Hogan not wanting to lay down for jarrett. which is stupid, because wrestling fans paid to see hogan and they paid to see wrestling. How would you feel if during your favorite movie it stopped half way through and the director came on screen to ""remind you that this movie is fake and it's not real at all so please don't be entertained by entertainent?""
Russo tried to create his own version of Montreal and instead drives another bigger dagger into a company that was once considered a real wrestling fans company.
This vhs is not worth the hundred bucks or higher that it usually costs on amazon, if i were you, id just try to youtube or download the russo stuff if your curious and want to see how fake it came accross, if not i highly recommend getting some great WCW stuff from 1998 and back.
Like i said, (and the match listings are on here by other people), alot of the matches are fun besides the completely lame graveyard match, so if you can get the tape for [...] or so, and/or loved some of the WCW guys like goldberg, nash, booker t, mike awesome, etc.  then pick it up.
just don't consider the wopping [...]or more it usually is.
hope this helps.",1233964800,,1601,4.333333333333333
7920779,3,B00004RESK,"The Lt. Loco-Juventu Guerrera-Cruiserweight title match was a basic,solid,high-flying match. The Big Vito-Norman Smiley & Ralphus Handicap match for the Hardcore title was ok for a hardcore title match. The Daffney-Ms. Hancock-Wedding Gown match was a dumb mindless filler. The Kronik-Perfect Event-World Tag Team title match was a basic,solid tag team bout. The Kanyon-Booker T match was not great but pretty good. The Scott Steiner-Mike Awesome-U.S title match was a good match ruined by a lousy DQ ending. The Vampiro-KISS Demon-Graveyard match was a down & dirty but somewhat boring brawl. The Shane Douglas-Buff Bagwell match was a pretty solid brawl. The Hulk Hogan-Jeff Jarrett-World title match was nothing more then a lazy,dumb,BIG LIPPED ALLIGATOR MOMENT. The Goldberg-Kevin Nash match was slow but still pretty good in some ways. The Booker T-Jeff Jarrett-World title match was a hard-hitting,back-and-forth,smash-mouth brawl.
