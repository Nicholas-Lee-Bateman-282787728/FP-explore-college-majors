8310131,4,B001HZ59IK,Surf's Up and Monster House both surprised me.  Very well made with humor for kids and adults.  I think the best of these movies entertain all ages and all three of these movies do that.  I think Monster House is fine for kids - at least it was so in my family.  My six year old daughter loved it as did a number of her classmates.  Amazon's current price for the bundle is not so attractive.  Better deal if you purchase them individually.,1232496000,,440,4.240963855421687

We purchased this bundle during christmas for the family.  Surf's up and Open house were good and Monster house was not good for the kids.  I am not sure why they included that for us to buy possibly because it was not selling standalone DVD.  I would buy them seapartely if I know what I know now.

We used Surf's up most of the time and not the other two.",1232236800,,427,4.957746478873239
