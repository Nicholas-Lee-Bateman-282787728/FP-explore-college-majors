5379573,5,B00A2VKOSA,"Purchased this along with Moto 3 for my son and the feedback has been excellent.  When asked how he liked it the response was ""It's sick!"" I believe he and his friends have watched this at least 4 times in as many days.  Fuels the desire to ride and the videography is breathtaking.",1362441600,,282,4.30188679245283
5379574,5,B00A2VKOSA,Bought this because our three year old loves dirt bikes. Downloaded it for quick entertainment while out to eat. I Have now watched it several time and I am now following the sport a little.,1362441600,,190,4.457142857142857
5379575,4,B00A2VKOSA,We have the complete collection 1-4 and this version is good also. The part I didn't like were the sound tracks...for some reason they weren't as up beat and motivating as previous movies. The footage and camera angles are amazing as always and it was good to see some fresh faces.,1357689600,,281,4.529411764705882

5379579,5,B00A2VKOSA,"This film is awesome!  Moto 4 displays an excellent soundtrack for all riding scenes, a nice mix of mx and enduro, and great camera work.  Really, the camera shots and slow mo makes me wanna go ride and film!

If you liked the other moto movies, you will not be disappointed.  This is the best one yet!",1355270400,,302,4.245614035087719

8546341,3,B00A2VKOSA,I had a motorcycle as a kid and I'm trying to get my kids interested in motorcross. This show does a good job of showing motorcycles going fast down trails and doing jumps. Which is basically all of motorcross I believe but the high speed footage tends to wear on you after a while.,1392854400,,282,4.2407407407407405
8546342,4,B00A2VKOSA,"this was a good and entertaining film. I enjoyed it. I must apologize for my comments on Moto 3, I thought it was a different film and was therefore a little upset with what I said.",1389657600,,181,4.055555555555555
8546343,5,B00A2VKOSA,"Excellent Motocross movie.  Highly recommended.  Great photography.  Wonderful story interviewing riders and there stomping ground.  I just bought Moto 5 and I think Moto 4 is much better.  I like the sound track (Music) much better.  The story is more connected and getting to know the lifestyle of the riders is more entertaining than moto 5 which is mostly just helicopter videos of riders with not much story line.

I have watched this at least 4 times and plan to watch at least 4 more times.",1385683200,,497,4.709302325581396
