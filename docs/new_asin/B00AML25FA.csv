8553855,5,B00AML25FA,"This show is more real and intelligent than Sex and the City and I don't get the comparisons, other than the obvious.  I think they set it up to comment and ironically show how this generation has real problems and are not going to glamorize it.  This show is just better and more interesting, and people only hate on Lena because she is funny, beautiful and successful and that is hard not to be jealous of.",1365465600,,408,4.355263157894737
