4498366,1,B004XYABMQ,"For those who are not aware of this, there is a long history of representing women with lesbian desire as twisted, creepy, psychopathic, desperate perverts.  In the paperback industry, authors could include lesbian characters, as long as the moral of the story was that lesbians are dangerous and crazy.  When characters with lesbian desire began appearing on the big screen in the 90's, ignorant filmmakers resurrected this McCarthy era theme.

This film is offensive and gross.  It perpetuates the stereotype that the source of lesbian desire is some form of twisted psychopathology.  From the very second the Spanish girl arrives at the boarding school, the viewer knows she will end up dead.  The only mystery is figuring out which character with obsessive, stalkery lesbian desire will be responsible for her death.  As it turns out, they are both partially responsible.

In addition to the tiresome homophobia, the filmmakers added tiresome sexism.  Hmmmm, let's do something new.  Let's center almost all the action on teenage girls being super catty and mean.  That has never been done.  That is such an empowering portrayal of young women.  Boys in boarding school have a ton of fun and form bonds of brotherhood.  Girls taunt each other to death.",1413763200,2,1256,5.0931372549019605

4498368,4,B004XYABMQ,"I won't bother with a full synopsis as I'm sure one may have read the other reviews I believe Miss G was more or less abandoned at this boarding school as a very young child.  And therefore it became her whole world.  That somehow made the outside world too frightening.  So her ""adventures,"" were only lived through books. Along comes Fiamma someone who's had a life beyond the confinds of school. Who's traveled, who knows literature, who is more worldly then the girls of miss g's dive team. Fiamma  Is everything to Miss G that she only imagines herself to be.  Miss G falls for her or feels she has.  It's more obsession then love or outright pedophilic lesbianism.  I would have liked to seen a bit more of Miss G's obsession. I.e. her  slight stalking of Fiamma,  There's a scene where Fiamma is adrift in the lake in a row boat.  Which I take is her way of getting away from Miss G.  Because when Miss G finds her, Fiamma says ""Why must you follow me?""  You never really see her following her.  Except the morning after a certain event I shant tell you. It's a good movie.  It can drag just a bit though.",1408752000,6,1112,4.334951456310679
4498369,5,B004XYABMQ,"This movie is something like a cross between MEAN GIRLS & THE DEAD POET'S SOCIETY.  Eva Green plays a mid-20th century physical education teacher of a very conservative British girl's school.  Come to find out, she is an alumnus of the school herself and it appears the experience has warped her a bit.  She is totally at home in the company of girls & women, but is a nervous wreck whenever she's around strange men.  As one might expect, Sapphic love is her preference.

Along comes a gorgeous young student who is heads & shoulders above the rest of the girls both athletically & intellectually.  The young teacher can't help but fall in love with her.  In this respect, you could say that the film resembles a girl/girl version of LOLITA as well.  Naturally, the other girls get frustrated with the situation, feeling that they are being left out of the attention of their favorite instructor.

There is the framework of the film;  a story that details the pitfalls of a school that is overly strict and where the no-fun-rule is always in effect.  Typically, this leads to more problems than what the approach  is designed to solve.

4498371,4,B004XYABMQ,"This was beautifully acted and intense.  But I don't think I could watch it again... for much the same reasons I don't care to watch movies like Heavenly Creatures and Boys Don't Cry again- even though they were also very well done.  Ultimately, just too dark and depressing.

This one takes place at an all-girls British boarding school set on a remote island in 1934.  The template is loosely reminiscent of the classic The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie by Muriel Spark-- a creepy-queerish disturbing tribute?? It centers around the relationship of a diving instructor and the relationship she maintains with her group of girls.  I was completely seduced by the teacher the moment she was introduced.  She glamorously strolls by all her girls with a knowing look and a flirty smile...  I so get it.  She's beautiful and elegant and inspiring and very capable of lavishing all her attentions on little ol' you.  The smoldering sexiness combined with her worldly, well-travelled persona seems to have them all seduced... particularly her diving captain who clearly controls all the others.  It's quite the set up.  Miss G is the queen of her magical little kingdom of blossoming and adoring young girls.  If you ever had a beautiful or charismatic teacher or mentor you would do absolutely anything to please... Eva Green completely embodies that energy.

Upfront I didn't imagine her as anything too bad.  She crosses enough lines to just be super cool and dreamy in the very beginning.  There's no blatant sign she's a lesbian, but we don't see her involved with men either.  Mostly she just seems like a ham for adoration and she uses her appeal to control her girls... particularly with her aggressive diving captain where there is some romantic tension.  But I felt it was kept at arm's length and used more as a manipulation because the captain is, as a result, emotionally loyal and keeps every girl in check.  However, when a beautiful and aristocratic student from Spain transfers in, the dynamic of Miss G's group shifts dramatically.  Fiamma is an immediate outcast among the girls, but her diving skills and worldly attitude deeply impress Miss G.  The teacher embraces her, but Fiamma is intuitive and defiant and sees through Miss G's glamorous and seductive facade.  She isn't having any of it.  Miss G soon falls into a creepy obsession with Fiamma.

Overall, this was just depressing to watch the fall of Miss G-- a disgraced and fallen idol. I was rather enjoying her initial seductive nature!  But this just got ugly.  She slipped into something diabolical and evil.  Like, disheveled and unkempt nervous breakdown evil... not Elizabeth Hurley in Bedazzled sexy-Satan evil.  Crazy evil.  The world she's built with her girls comes tumbling down.  Nasty stuff here.  Just plain sad, really.

For those of you expecting some kind of Loving Annabelle storyline... forget it.  These two don't have anything like that going on. The student hates her.  The one intimate scene (no actual sex is portrayed) is predatory and more like pedophilia than the sensual teacher-student taboo fantasy portrayed in Loving Annabelle.  Definitely hard to watch.  There is a very fine line when you tread through taboo themes... very fine.  And this one ultimately lands in the more disturbing arena.

Very well done, but just too dark for a second watch.  But I will say... Eva Green is a top notch actress and definitely one sexy and mesmerizing creature... and if you're intrigued by the strange taboos she's willing to explore here, definitely check her out in Womb, lol....",1387065600,6,3572,4.9411764705882355
4498372,3,B004XYABMQ,"This is very much like the film ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie."" There is much to like here but the hand of God (the writer) comes down and forces the story.

Here's the scoop. It's 1934 and Eva Green plays Miss G., a free spirited teacher in a stodgy English boarding school situated on an Island. She smokes, wears pants and tells her students of her adventures as she tries to free their minds and souls. Along comes an aristocratic girl from Spain with a mysterious background. The young woman throws a monkey in the wrench and the equilibrium of the relationships is in the balance.

This starts out well enough. The situation is set up well and the sets, costumes and such are spot on. The viewer is right there with these people. The language seems right on with the time as well and you see how the lines are drawn. Miss G's girls love her. Particularly Di (Juno Temple) who will even share a cigarette with Miss G from time to time. She makes her girls feel special. But are all the adventures she shares with her students really from first hand experience? As it is said, those who can do. Those who can't teach. When the new girl, Fiamma, arrives Miss G's exploits are called into question, as is her past. There is a dark spot there that is not brought to light. And Fiamma herself is not at the school on a whim. There is a darkness there that is also alluded to. The problem comes in as the story progresses. I felt the writer begin to force the issue and I didn't believe it. You know that if a person has asthma, this will rear its head sometime during the proceedings. And did it really have to end as it did? Is Miss G threatened to the point that this would be the outcome? It were as though the story was written for the characters and not the other way around. And I took issue in that most of the girls below the level of Di were sketches at best.

There is much to like here and for the most part it was a good watch, but it could have been so much more.",1369267200,3,1977,4.197368421052632
4498373,5,B004XYABMQ,"St. Matilda's School for Girls sits high atop a small island off the coast of England; a ferry is all that connects them to the outside world. Di Radfield (Juno Temple), the captain of the diving team dominates the other girls in the group. Di and rest of the team worship their diving teacher, Miss `G' Gribben (Eva Green) who weaves stories of adventure and intrigue for the amusement of ""her girls"".

When Fiamma (Mara Valverde), a beautiful Spanish student arrives, she captures Miss G's attention much to the dislike of Di who has feeling for Miss G. When Fiamma rebuffs Miss G's advances and even challenges the validity of her adventures, the rest of the girls turn on her. After Fiamma disappears, the delicate facade of truth and lies begins to crumble and both the girls and Miss G are changed forever.

Director Jordan Scott (daughter of Ridley Scott) has created a moody drama of academic rivalry and coveted secrets set in the cloistered environment of an island. The film, based on the novel written by Sheila Kohler, was filmed mainly in County Wicklow, Ireland.

The glorious Eva Green portrays Miss `G' to perfection, her precarious grip on reality slips as truth and lies mingle, slowly revealing her true nature. Juno Temple is wonderful as captain of the diving team and ruthless leader of her small band of girls.

4498379,5,B004XYABMQ,"CAUTION:  SPOILERS AHEAD!

One of the best films I have seen in years.  ""Cracks"" (2009) is a blend of ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brody"" (1969), ""Atonement"" (2007), and Lillian Hellman's ""The Children's Hour""; but ultimately it is unique enough to maintain considerable originality.  There was more of a ""Lord of the Flies"" homage in the source novel, what with its more savage African setting, but if anything the film works better with that replaced by claustrophobic and cloistered interior sets.  Jordan Scott  has great acting for-the-camera directing skills.  The principle casting is especially good with Maria Valverde excellent and Eva Green (much like Elizabeth Hartman) able to tap into her inherent shyness and bring a more powerful authenticity to her character.  And Juno Temple (a ringer for a young Glenda Farrell if you watch a lot of 30's films) is quite simply a force to be reckoned with, something you already know if you have watched her in other films.

What follows is full of spoilers as I am trying to assist people in understanding the story.  So if you have not watched I suggest you stop reading and come back for the rest after your first viewing.  Then watch it again as like most really good films it withholds at lot of its pleasure for multiple viewings.

So here are a few thoughts from my twisted mind:

You only begin to understand what the screenwriter/director is trying to say when you realize that the story is being told entirely from Diana's (Juno Temple) point-of-view and the other characters are simply plot devices to illustrate Diana's coming of age story.  Miss ""G"" (Eva Green) is another Miss Brodie (Maggie Smith) and Diana is another Sandy (Pamela Franklin).  As in the 1969 film, the star pupil gets her back up when the teacher she worships finds someone else to be her student ideal.

A key to both films is Tennyson's ""The Lady of Shalott"", which was quoted in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brody"". ""When the Moon was overhead, Came two young lovers lately wed; ""I am half sick of shadows,"" said The Lady of Shalott.""

In the poem she is a magical being who lives alone on an island upstream from King Arthur's Camelot. Her purpose is to look at the world outside her castle window in a mirror, and to weave what she sees into a tapestry. She is forbidden by the magic to look at the outside world directly. Looking at the world in a mirror and depicting it in a work of art is an allegory for the life of a teacher viewing the world from an ivory tower and interpreting it for her young students.

In similar ways Miss Brodie and Miss ""G"" are wonderful teachers and most young girls would have benefited from membership in their groups, mostly because of the breaking of conventions and the encouragement to openly explore the possibilities life offers.  But both have fatal flaws.  Miss Brodie is judgmental and irresponsible, full of misguided ideals and grievances, and totally confident that the world is as simplistic as she wants it to be.  Miss ""G's"" confidence, on the other hand, is a complete faade; hiding a brittle basket case who can only bloom in the protected niche of the school, despite her seeming openness to experiencing life.

Both are downbeat films but ""Cracks"" considerably less so.  This is because while Sandy's depressing transformation into and betrayal of Miss Brodie was the principle dynamic, Diana ultimately wises up to the folly of what her teacher is about.  And Diana's atonement is a very positive one.

Once you understand that Diana's growth is the principle dynamic, the rest of the story fits together rather smoothly. The fatal attraction of Miss ""G"" to Fiamma (Maria Valverde) is almost a Hitchcock McGuffin,  in that it provides a lot of character motivation but is ultimately just a plot device.

Interestingly the climatic scene comes well before the end of the film.  It is the scene where Diana is helping Fiamma put on makeup for their ""Eve of St. Agnes"" feast.  The importance of the scene (and the reason they linger on Fiamma's eye contact) is that it is at this point that a part of Fiamma's spirit becomes a part of Diana, something which symbolically happened when Fiamma gave her the bottle several scenes earlier. And Diana takes both bottle and spirit with her when she leaves the island at the end.  In ""Jane Eyre"" this same dynamic occurs between Jane and Helen; with the gentle spirit of Helen passing to Jane and ultimately being the transformative force in her life.

Although I love this climatic scene, my favorite scene comes a bit later when Diana is alone with the headmistress in her office. I think that I like it so well because for a first time director, Jordan Scott has an intuitive grasp of the limitations of sentimentality and she creates a scene which affects the viewer in a way they cannot help, and they cry. This can be wonderful but a director must carefully employ it because it will not work if the viewer picks up on ""false"" sentimentality. So unlike such scenes in many movies, Juno Temple (who has no lines in the scene) is not weeping, trying to get you to weep. Instead she is trying not to cry; and the scene is so much more powerful because of this restraint, the slick way the scene is edited, and the talent for nonverbal acting that Temple brings to the film.

The ending of ""Cracks"" is both moving and intriguing, in large part because of the slick editing.  They cut between shots of the girls reading a note and shots of the exiled Miss ""G"" unpacking and staring at a photo of her team (after counting to be sure she only has five items on her nightstand).  Then the audio reveals it is not Miss G's message but Diana's atonement note, at which time the editor cuts to a shot of Diana sitting on the ferry with the book, the bottle, and their map.  The film goes out on a shot of Diana's face; as she is leaving the cloistered island to take the path in life that she believes Fiamma would have taken.

Then again what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1358467200,7,5993,4.614514608859566

4498381,3,B004XYABMQ,"Public schools (aka private schools) have always been a subject of endless fascination in the movies, especially boarding schools, which are believed to be hotbeds of warped sexuality, repression and sado-masochism.  Films like IF ... and ANOTHER COUNTRY are earlier examples; even DEAD POETS SOCIETY, while celebrating the efforts of an inspirational educator, contains slight echoes of such preoccupations.  CRACKS is a film situated squarely within the same tradition, in which young women are shut up in an incarcerated world, and have to learn to live (or not live) with one another, and a young teacher (Eva Green) comes to grief, despite her best efforts.  A low-budget effort with a certain grisly fascination.",1353801600,2,718,5.336283185840708

We get a hint when she goes out to buy breakfast for one of the girls but we don't realize it until the very end. Great movie, great plot. Deserves 10 stars.",1339804800,6,508,4.3578947368421055

Actually, it offered a different spin on a story that could be true/reality. The art of storytelling is difficult, but I think the writer of this film did a good job turning a book to a movie. I love Miss G's style and grace, but this teaches us not to invest too much in what people show us on the outside. Man will always be surprising and naturally bad when not trained to be and do good. It also teaches us how some of us cannot control our desires. Desire allows us to achieve anything, but you still must control your desire. The ending wasn't as powerful for me and the movie was slow in some instances, but it was still a good film. I like that it showed the realities of asthma. I have a friend with asthma who almost died once as a child. It can be scary. So for all of you who don't know about asthma, this is a good depiction of its seriousness.",1331683200,4,1018,4.1725888324873095
4498384,4,B004XYABMQ,"This film is gorgeously photographed and unfolds an unusual story.  Juno Temple plays Di, the main character through whose eyes we view most of the action.  Di is a saucy suck-up to her dream teacher, Miss G.  Eva Green plays the central character of Miss G with great variety.  At the beginning, we see a beautiful woman with an air of mystery.  She masks so completely some of the later aspects of her character that we are startled.  When she devolves into lunacy, grasping for control, she is extremely scary.  The role is quite different from her work as Vesper in the two James Bond films, although even there she seemed to excel at duplicity.  Green certainly is a star-quality actress who keeps us glued to the screen.

Spanish actress Maria Valverde plays Fiamme who comes to the school, apparently an outcast for some unknown reason, but is introduced as a princess.  She excels at diving, which puts her squarely in Di's sites who finds herself supplanted as Miss G's favorite.  Valverde brings a complex and richly colored performance to her role.  Irish actress Sinead Cusack does an excellent job as the head mistress of the school who covers up scandal.

This film was a bit disturbing.  As my adult daughter who watched this with me pointed out, we don't usually think of pedophiles as female; so it was perhaps shocking for that reason.  Content aside, this is a gripping film, strong for the way in which it tells this intense tale of womanly desire.  Enjoy!",1325030400,5,1476,4.70703125

These girls are young teenagers and one of them in particular is considered the leader of the pack- she's the one in control and calls the shots.  Whatever she says, her classmates do as they're told.

One day the teacher says they have a new girl attending the school- a talented swimmer from Spain.  The girls don't initially realize she possesses such a talent- it takes for a particular diving lesson to bring this exciting and surprising news to light.

Well the other girls don't like this new girl at all.  They think she's spoiled and arrogant.  A ""daddy's girl"".  However the teacher actually likes her a lot... more than a teacher should EVER like a student in fact, which is the basis of this story.

For the most part I was enjoying Cracks because it was unique watching a fairly strict Catholic school in Ireland.  Plus the main character -the one girl who's the leader- showed me some amazing talent.

My only grip is that the storyline never really let us on to believe the teacher had a ""thing"" for this particular student other than a few scenes.  I suppose the late night swimming parties should have been obvious something was up, because the teacher was there with the girls in the water.  Otherwise the plot focused around the girls bickering, experiencing anger and jealousy, etc.

However, absolutely NOTHING could have prepared me for the ending.  I wasn't expecting *that* to happen, haha.  What a surprise!  The storyline doesn't progress in a way that leads one to believe such an outcome is even possible.

Overall, Cracks is a decent way to spend 90-plus minutes, but perhaps some more storyline development would have been nice.  I still enjoyed the film overall, though.",1323475200,6,1799,4.782467532467533

The story is set in a '30s British all girl's school that, outside of a nearby village, is isolated on an island from most of the world. One of the teachers who herself was a student at the school fantasizes about the world yet because of her own insecurities has been nowhere but at the school. The interplay between the teacher and her students was well and accurately written as she strives to give them dreams to seek and offers opportunities for them to practice succeeding. Problems arise through conflicts of emotional attachment and detachment between all the parties. Yes, it does have it's darker sides.
Great acting, directing, musical score, script and cinematography.",1321488000,13,745,5.016129032258065

4498391,5,B004XYABMQ,"Jordan Scott, niece of director Tony Scott who with his brother Ridley Scott serve a executive producers of this film, makes and impressive debut as a director/writer (with Ben Court and Caroline Ip) in this intensely interesting and well crafted adaptation of Sheila Kohler's novel CRACKS.  This is a period piece (1934) that takes place in St. Mathilda's School in Stanley Island, England, an isolated all girl British boarding school. The mood is one of gothic evil where rich young girls participate in the cloistered rigid education imposed by the matrons of the school -Miss Nieven (Sinad Cusack), Matron (Helen Norton), and Miss Lacey (Deirdre Donnelly) - whose chief concern is to guard the reputation of the school at all costs, and lightened only by the presence of the swimming/diving coach Miss G (Eva Green) whom the girls admire for her exotic beauty, worldliness, supposed travel around the world, and her possessiveness of her brood.

One of the girls, Di (Juno Temple in a brilliant performance), is the team captain and the apparent favorite of Miss G - until the sudden arrival of a beautiful Spanish girl Fiamma (Mara Valverde) who tends to set herself apart form the rest of the claque (Di, Poppy (Imogen Poots), Lily (Ellie Nunn), Fuzzy (Clemmie Dugdale), Laurel (Adele McCann) and Rosie (Zo Carroll).  Fiamma is an expert diver and her gifts as a sportsman as well as her beauty attract Miss G, replacing Di as her favorite.  In jealous rage Di gathers the claque and plans the exit of this unwanted intruder. How this backfires and increases Miss G's attraction to Fiamma leads down another path of evil that pulls this little tale of terror to a surprising end.

Eva Green manages to make Miss G a fascinating character and her gradual obsession with Fiamma and the direction that takes her is a very fine performance.  But the entire cast  - girls and teachers  - is superb, especially Juno Temple in a career making role.  The cinematography by John Mathieson finds both the haunting beauty of the isolated St. Mathilde's School and the splendid panoramas of nature add immeasurably to the film as does the musical score by Javier Navarette - a score that combines Anglican hymns with gentle piano music.  This is a triumph for all concerned and bodes well for the career of Jordan Scott.  Grady Harp, October 11",1317513600,15,2339,4.866498740554156
4498392,4,B004XYABMQ,"The actors here are wonderful, including the younger ones; and the locations in Ireland are gorgeous.  The photography and music are well chosen too.

This is a compelling story of jealousy and obsession in a girls' boarding school in the 1930s, with a spirited teacher and a small group of girls involved in the main events and conflicts.  Probably more could have been done with the story, but it is mostly interesting and quite unpredictable.",1313625600,3,445,4.906666666666666
4498393,5,B004XYABMQ,"An excellent production, a sort of all-female private school ""Lord Of The Flies"" set between the wars. Other reviewers have summarized the story. Let me add that the acting is quite wonderful, including the very young minor characters, and that the production is equally fine. If you like movies and/or stories set in a confined ""hothouse"" of a boarding school, this film is not to be missed. Highly recommended!",1313193600,11,412,4.9855072463768115
4498394,3,B004XYABMQ,"""Let nothing hold you back except the air itself. You are between heaven and earth. The rules no longer apply.""  A teacher (Green) at a boarding school for girls tries to teach them about real life.  When a new girl arrives at the school and takes Miss G's (Green) attention from her, Di (Temple) becomes jealous.  This is a movie that drags a little, but is still very good.  Eva Green's performance alone is worth watching this for.  The entire movie she keeps you guessing as to what kind of person she is. Just when you think she is helping the girls, something changes and you are not sure anymore.  I would compare this to ""Dead Poet's Society"", but a darker version of that movie.  I did enjoy this but again, it is pretty slow in parts but it is worth it to stay with it until the end.  Overall, this is a good movie, but not for everyone.  A very dark British version of ""Dead Poet's Society"" for girls.  I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.

4498395,5,B004XYABMQ,"One of my favourite movies, hands down.

What I love about this movie more than anything, more than the acting or the gorgeous scenery, is how even though one of the main characters is at least a bit bent, it doesn't focus on her sexual orientation. Cracks was not afraid to step beyond its safety rails and brush off the fact that a character(s) was not straight, even though it kept coming up again and again. Never once did any of the other characters bring comment on it.

(SLIGHT SPOILERS)
I've seen some awful reviews for this on afterellen.com saying that this film set the LGBT movement back because the lesbian was the antagonist. They compared it to Loving Anabelle, a film in which the relationship was consensual, and declared Loving Anabelle by far the superior movie. I'm going to heavily disagree on all accounts and say the fact that the antagonist CAN be a lesbian is PROOF of the success of the LGBT movement. There are plenty of films about girls and boys coming out of the closet, after a while the same taste becomes stale. Finally it was safe to make a film like this where the sexual orientation of the character does NOT matter, Fiamma could have been male or rather, Ms G could have been male or they BOTH could have been male and the story would not have changed in any way whatsoever.

I believe this film was just what the LGBT movement needed and furthermore, Cracks stands mighty tall on its own. The acting, the script, the little things you have to watch it over and over again in order to see... It's slow moving, but it's truly a work of art. Not at all what I expected when I first heard they were shooting.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a love for art and an open mind!",1310342400,37,1721,4.419558359621451
4498396,5,B004XYABMQ,This film is a tale of obsession and desire. Brilliant performances by Eva Green and Juno Temple. It follows the diving team of an prestigious bording school and its cult like structure. When new comer Fiamma (played by Spanish actress Maria Valverde) comes and threatens that structure things take a unexpected turn. Loosely based on the novel of the same title by Sheila Kohler it gives entertainment and the chance to see what the nature of obsession can become. It is a very interesting piece from director Jordan Scott and draws its poetics from works of writers like John Keats and Mary Kingsley.

She's played some really strong and heroic characters who all seem to be flawed in some way, but she always works flawlessly in the role which leaves you constantly wanting and waiting for her next performance. Beautiful scenery and some familiar young girls that later come into their own successful careers. There are kids, but not a kid friendly movie and the difficult topics in the story line could have been revealed with more dimensional scenes. While the subject matter was introduced and the script gets that across, but lacking and you feel you've wasted your time unless you're an Eva Green fan.",1519776000,,646,4.881818181818182
