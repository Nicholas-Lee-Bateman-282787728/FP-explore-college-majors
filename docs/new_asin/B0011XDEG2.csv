The teacher is amazing, you almost believe it is the actual historical person in front of you talking just to you.  I recommend this to any one wanting a basic American History class.  I especially recommend it if your student has a dislike for reading for any reason.  The workbook is wonderful with an outline for each lecture and questions for each lecture.  You need both the video and the workbook to be able to get full benefit.",1360281600,2,506,4.640449438202247
8242906,5,B0011XDEG2,"We use this for homeschool course, American History. Prof. Thompson really gets into his lessons with period costumes and characters to teach the lessons in a memorable fashion. He is fun to watch, the workbook questions are well targeted, and the outside required reading helps round out the lessons. We also use additional reading and geography work to further nail the lessons down.",1351468800,2,385,5.126984126984127
8242907,5,B0011XDEG2,"We use this as most of our History program for my son's highschool and add in some supplemental material and projects.  My younger girls love just watching these for fun as I narrate along and explain it to them.  He keeps it fun and interesting, but also challenging with the questions and workbook...great product!!!",1267056000,8,318,4.87037037037037
8242908,5,B0011XDEG2,"This dramatic presentation of American history has been thoroughly enjoyed by my teenage son.  We had previously used a World History course from The Teaching Company, which was taught by the same teacher, and so we expected this to be good.  The DVDs consist of 30- minute lectures in which the teacher, through the use of costumes, becomes a historical character narrating his own story. The set comes with an outline for each lecture, essay questions, and comprehension questions. It is definitely high school level.  I consider it to be a very balanced representation of history- there is no attempt to be ""politically correct"" and the presentation is factual not interpretive.",1257120000,6,681,5.117117117117117
8242909,5,B0011XDEG2,An excellent presentation of Early American history by Thompson - a teacher who loves American history so much that he presents in character!  Very suitable for homeschool or classroom students from 7th grade to highschool.  Thorough enough to be a full 3o week course in its own right.  We used additional historical fiction for variety.,1254268800,6,338,5.109090909090909
