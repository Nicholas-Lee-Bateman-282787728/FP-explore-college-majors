 2 Peter 2:15

The video is filled with false testimonies and lies about the lives of the people portrait.  They are not accurate and do not represent the truth.  The Gospel does not need inflated testimonies that are simply not true.  Just preach the truth of the Gospel and let God do his sovereign work.",1450310400,,442,4.544303797468355
