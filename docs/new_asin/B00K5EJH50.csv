8655969,4,B00K5EJH50,"a well-done documentary showing how Eric Lomax came to forgive his former tortuer, Nagase and the lovely meeting they had.  Gave me more insight to Eric's process shown in his book and in the movie, The Railway Man.  A truly horrific story of man's inhumanity and the more than 50 years it took for Eric to find him and to finally forgive him.",1442016000,,343,4.428571428571429
