8436092,5,B000CA6DDQ,"This video was SOOOOO helpful with learning yoga!  I was skeptical at first, but it was worth ever penny for the disc.  I love how the video was not shot in a studio, but instead on the beaches of Costa Rica...very soothing.  I recommend it for beginners and even intermediate yoga users because the instructor was very descriptive in the lessons.  Have fun!",1135900800,,358,4.634920634920635
