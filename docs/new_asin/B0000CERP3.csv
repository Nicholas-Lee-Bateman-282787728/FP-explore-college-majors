1919077,5,B0000CERP3,"For years the typical Sherlock Holmes has been defined by Basil Rathbone with his memorable profile. This movie bends the rules of the canon Sherlock and turns him into something new and fresh and it ultimately works mainly because of the actors involved.

Sherlock Holmes is pitted against the nemesis, Professor Moriarty. At stake is the drug market, which Moriarty is trying to control. Sherlock is pushed to his limits as he tries to capture his rival and protect a woman he has come to love.

This Sherlock is not your typical, woman disdaining, snooty detective. This Sherlock is arrogant, womanizing and quite willing to go on a drunken blitz when the moment comes, but he's also more human than the canon version. James D'Arcy gives Sherlock an aloof demeanor yet is still very vulnerable, especially where his emotions are concerned. Richard E. Grant is also memorable in his brief role as Mycroft. Watching D'Arcy and Grant act for all they're worth against each other in their one big scene was a treat. There are less than memorable moments with Gabrielle Angwar though. Her character hardly has an impact, which is a point that comes to play later in the movie to prove she SHOULD have had an impact. The story is your basic detective mystery with the surprising addition of a really good sword fight at the end.

While this Sherlock doesn't follow the typical rules, he's still worth a watch and a welcome fresh addition to the Rathbone staple.",1096848000,15,1458,4.800796812749004
1919078,5,B0000CERP3,"Thought this story presents a younger Sherlock Holmes-who's character and appearance are quite different from the works of Conan Doyle (or the drawings of Arthur Paget)it is still a very good story which maintains the viewers interest throughout.
The Holmes in this story is rather sexually amoral--but the fate of the woman he loves at the hands of Moriarty-provides a plausible explanation for Holmes' later apparent disinterest in the fairer sex.  In this story we are also given a reason for Holmes' original addiction to Opium.
James D'Arcy is far from my favorite Holmes-but his performance is adequate as long as one doesn't expect Jeremy Brett.  The actor who portrays Watson is also adequate-though not outstanding.  But, Vincent D'Onofrio is perfect as the evil Moriarty--far surpassing his performances on ""Law & Order""--though a little ""over the top""--his Moriarty is perfect-at least in my opinion.
Though some may dislike the revisionism--this is a very good story and well worth watching and owning!",1082246400,,1014,5.285714285714286
1919079,4,B0000CERP3,"Like the Ultimate Spiderman comic series which starts with the basics and redrafts it for a new audience so does Serlock: Case of Evil. It takes the basic elements and provides a new spin on Holmes as a good-looking, arrogant, publicity seeking Holmes who likes women.
The movie looks great! Widescreen with a pounding score. This is the Holmes the BBC should have done as a man of action rather than the latest version of the Hound of the Baskervilles with Richard Roxborough. This movie in one way pays little fidelity to Holmes but captures another version that it Holmes were created today this is how he would be like. Its something akin to what we can expect from the new BBC series of Doctor Who in 2005.",1081296000,,711,4.5625

1919081,4,B0000CERP3,"My wife grabbed this DVD off the rental rack, I am usually very  cautious about period pieces that I have never heard of, especially those pertaining to well-known fictitious characters such as Holmes.  Maybe I am gun-shy after the horrible `League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,' but there was nothing else to rent so we decided to give this one a go.  Well, let me say I was pleasantly surprised!  This is a great film with well-acted characters and a plot that moves along.  Sure, it has its faults, the relationship between  Holmes and Rebecca Dolye doesn't unfold to a level necessary later in the script (I won't ruin any of the plot); but the inclusion of Holmes' brother Mycroft to explain Holmes' disdain for Professor Moriarty as well as Mycroft's role in this movie are well done, as it the introduction of Watson into the film.
Far from perfect, this was a very entertaining movie that grabbed my attention from the start and kept it throughout.  I can understand why some Holmes fans wouldn't like it, his character does take a beating in this movie but his fundamental strengths are still highlighted.  It isn't a Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce adaptation of  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's beloved character, but a genuine fan of Doyle's works (in other words, those who have read his books and not just watched movies based on them) will appreciate this version, which delves deeper into the character and his fault's than the more sterile versions done by Rathbone/Bruce.  Don't get me wrong, I love those movies, but this adaptation of Doyle's work probably is much closer to what he intended.
Bottom line, great movie and well worth renting/owning.  Although rated `R' it is a fairly tame movie with just a few scenes not suitable for younger viewers (e.g. autopsies).",1074384000,6,1774,4.8604651162790695

1919083,2,B0000CERP3,"I have been a Sherlock Holmes fan since I was a kid and I have to say this is one of the worst Holmes films out there (even Matt Frewer's Holmes is better). I don't mind leaving canon behind for new and original stories, but completley reinventing the whole history just doesn't work. The only good thing about this film is the portrayal of Moriarity by Vincent D'onofrio. His Moriarity is as eccentric as Holmes is supposed to be. However, even with D'onofrio's performance I can't recommend this one.",1071273600,2,502,4.651685393258427
1919084,1,B0000CERP3,"I have been a Sherlockian for more than 30 years, but I have always loved good revisionist Sherlockiana. I am a big fan of Billy Wilder's PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES. I adore both films in which Holmes meets Jack the Ripper (STUDY IN TERROR and MURDER BY DECREE). I am a very big fan of Charles Marowitz's ""blasphemous"" play SHERLOCK'S LAST CASE. I love the latest anthology of short stories, SHADOWS OVER BAKER STREET, which stick Holmes into H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. But this film, first shown on USA network early in 2003, is a ""revisionist"" Holmes adventure WITHOUT Holmes, or Watson, or Moriarty. Holmes is portrayed as a drug-soaked dimwit who hasn't got a clue. Why or how did he ever become a detective? Watson works in the morgue at the Yard. The two are not partners. Moriarty is a silly, flamboyant fop. As a Holmes buff, I do not shy away from ""playing"" with the Doyle characters, but I *do* insist that a genuinely Sherlockian foundation be built upon. Otherwise, what's the point? They could have renamed this movie's characters and no one would have suspected that it was intended as a piece of Sherlockian revisionism.

1919087,4,B0000CERP3,"I, too am a big Holmes fan and have seen many manifestations of this character.

First, I'd like to say that for me, the appeal of this film is that this actor's age is much closer to the age of the star of the current hit BBC Sherlock show that I so adore.  It's true that I also adore Jeremy Bret's portrayal of the beloved character, what I REALLY want to see is a younger Holmes, closer to Cumberbatch's age.  This film is a great find for me in that it stars a competent, young, good-looking actor playing a Victorian-era Holmes!  In a sea of Sherlock Holmes films, that is a jewel of a find!  The actor was well cast for the role.

I very much enjoyed the high-production values of this film.  From the costumes and sets, all of the visual elements were attractive and helped draw me in to the story.  The performances were all excellent, and the script creative.  I LOVE the evilness of Moriarty and I loved the way the filmmaker so graphically showed the seedy side of London with the drug use.  I felt ill just watching any of the drug scenes and I especially felt horrified to see the drug-torture of Holmes.

That being said, this film has many things in it that simply don't make sense to me, or in my opinion, are just really strange and bad choices.  For example, I agree that the actor cast as Watson is a fine actor, but...what the heck where they thinking casting him in that role??? I don't understand it when ACD clearly describes the physical attributes of Sherlock's brother, Mycroft so that readers know that Mycroft is a very big, over weight man.  So WHY cast a Watson that fits that body type when nowhere did ACD craft Watson's character to look like that.  This may be completely shallow, but it bothered me so much that this Watson was so much older than Holmes and obese.

On the other hand, WHAT were they thinking when they came up with the character of Mycroft???  Sorry, but they might as well have not written him into the script at all if they had no interest in honoring the character that ACD wrote. Mycroft is neither thin, nor is he a cripple. It's almost like they arbitrarily decided to ""switch"" the Watson and Mycroft characters, although Mycroft's physical condition was much worse than ACD's Watson.

I didn't mind the Holmes that clearly enjoyed women so much, but the m/f interaction could have been far more subtle given that, whatever one thinks of the reason, Holmes does swear off women for the majority of his life.  Shrugs...I would have appreciated just a bit more consistency to explain why a young man goes from being a typical, red-blooded, straight male, to one who lives the majority of his life as a confirmed bachelor who uhm...doesn't care for women.

I'd recommend this film to anyone who has seen most of the films and craves something different.  I'd just caution them that there are more than a few artistic choices that may leave one scratching their head.",1382572800,3,2922,4.519011406844107

1919095,2,B0000CERP3,"This television movie shows us Holmes as a young man at he start of  his career  and not yet established  in the private detective business. He is arrogant and full of his own cleverness ,self -confident to the point of being unbearable .He is approached by a personable young woman claiming to be a titled lady and also to be  being blackmailed .Holmes takes the case ,finds that the culprit is none other than Professor Moriarty ,the Napoleon of Crime, and appears to despatch him in a duel with sword and pistol .Holmes uses a gutter journalist to spread news of his ""success"" and is soon the toast of London -indeeed he achieves great success with the ladies and for the first time in a ""legitimate "" Holmes movie is depicted in bed with a woman ,having parlayed his fame into sexual gratification.

Naturally all is not as it seems and following his investigation into the murders of various individuals connected with the burgeoning opium trade Holmes realises he has been duped and that Moriarty is not only still alive but planning to expand his activities and take over the whole drugs trade in London. He sinks into a decline full of recrimination and self doubt until the support of his new friend ,the London pathologist Doctor Watson encourages him to resume his battle with Moriarty .It is  a battle that results in tragedy and death ,plus a narrowe escape at the hands of Moriarty who uses him as an unwilling guinea pig for trials on a new and potentially  lucrative drug .

The acting is a tad on the melodramatic side with all performances being slightly overdone and mannered while the script is weak .I do not mind movies taking a revisionist approach to established literary creations but they need to add something fresh when they do and this is all pretty old hat ans slovenly in its execution  .It is not awful just mediocre and will go down as a minor addition to the Holmes canon on movies and TV",1254873600,,1922,4.5964912280701755

1919097,3,B0000CERP3,"A Study in Scarlet is thrown out and Sherlock is introduced anew in this stylish production.  Things drag a bit in the middle portion, possibly because D'Onofrio's over-the-top but very convincingly malicious Moriarty is offstage.  The picture's notable mainly for the famously misogynist Holmes bedding more women than James Bond ever did in a single film.  (He even has a threesome.)",1233446400,2,385,5.278688524590164
1919098,4,B0000CERP3,"I first caught this movie on USA network one night and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of both cast and script. James D'Arcy (probably best known for his role as Lt. Pullings in Master and Commander) makes a very attractive, young Sherlock Holmes. Brash enough to barge in uninvited on Scotland Yard investigations, vainglorious enough to keep newspaper clippings on his successes and wild enough to enjoy the limelight and perks of fame - namely female admirers. Holmes is a restless genius; absinthe is his drug of choice in the early days. But Holmes is still a recognizable Holmes and you know when he matures he will become the finest detective around.
One person distinctly underwhelmed at first however, is Dr John Watson. (Roger Morlidge) Watson sees the potential in Holmes and Morlidge also does a good job of foreshadowing the loyal friend and biographer to be. Their relationship in this movie reminds me a bit of Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke; Watson is a bit older and rock steady, while Holmes leaps around from genuis to despair. Richard E. Grant, someone who seems to show up in almost every Euro/British production nowdays, plays Mycroft Holmes in a drastic departure from the books. He does a good job but one wishes there was more to his role than what we're shown. Exactly how did he get involved with Moriarty and drugs?
As usual, there is Professor Moriarty, this time played be Vincent D'Onofrio, the main man of Law & Order these days. D'Onofrio's Moriarty is no urbane, intellectual mathematics professor; he is a snarling, spitting evil drug lord whose relationship with the Holmes family goes back several years, starting with Mycroft. D'Onofrio is perhaps guilty of hamming it up but he is easily the most vibrant, evil Professor Moriarty that I've seen in quite a while.
Nicholes Gecks does a solid job with Inspector Lestrade (I wouldn't have minded more with him) and Gabrielle Anwar does a lot with a small role as the actress Rebecca Doyle. Its a pity there wasn't more with her either.
The film does have its drawbacks. To me, there are a lot of gratutiously gross autopsy scenes; some of them go on and on. Also, if you are one of those who simply cannot stand any deviation from the Doyle stories, you won't like this movie. For one, the Study in Scarlet never happened as Holmes and Watson meet in a morgue, where Watson is performing an autopsy. The changes with Holmes and Watsons' characters can be explained as they are both growing and learning but the changes with Mycroft and Moriarty are much deeper and more permament. Also, this is a very dark film, sometimes it almost feels claustrophobic. Holmes does some deducing in this one but if you're one who prefers rather sedate pipe puffing logic puzzles, you probably won't care for this.
However, if you can be somewhat flexible in your Holmesian tastes, I think you'll enjoy this movie. I've watched nearly every Holmes onscreen that I could find and I think it stacks up well. The acting is good, the plot is solid and the dialogue is crisp.
One trivia note: when USA aired this movie, there was a short scene with the injured Holmes in hospital where a nurse gives him morphine for his wounds, over his objections. It clearly foreshadows the coming dependence on cocaine but for some reason, this scene is deleted in the DVD. (Just thought I'd mention it.)",1224028800,,3367,4.767123287671233
1919099,5,B0000CERP3,"Vincent D'Onofrio is well known as a character actor.  Playing a ""bad boy"" is nothing new to him.  For example, in the 13th Floor, one minute he's shooting the hero, and in the next, he's like a little boy with his face pressed up against the candystore window pane.

In this film, however, D'Onofrio really explores his lesser nature, and carries his character to a truly shocking and inhuman level.  In other Sherlock Holmes presentations, Professor Moriarty is an ""evil"" that is more alluded to than ever actually presented.  Here, the Professor, in D'Onofrio's capable hands, finally lives up to all that hype!  He is one bad boy!

Granted this is a ""Sherlock Holmes"" film, but the star is D'Onofrio - James D'Arcy is effective in portraying a Sherlock Holmes still in the formative stages...not yet purified in his personal crucible of fire.
D'Arcy's Sherlock is more a male debutante shopping for a life by sampling various human experiences...until the Professor introduces him to an unrelenting reality of loss.  Therein does Sherlock become the seasoned warrior who finds his inner strength to battle his famed nemesis.  It is almost inescapable that the power and force of Moriarty actually encourages the growth of same virtues from Sherlock.

For D'Onofrion fans, this is the one movie where his hair is ""absolutely beautiful"" - curly, thick, lustrous, etc. Okay, I didn't want to say it but I will....He's gorgeous!

For Sherlock fans, there's some suggested insights worth a looksey!

I would certainly recommend this film, Sherlock: Case of Evil.  But, do remember this is D'Onofrio being a ""bad boy"" and when he's bad...he's very very bad!

1919100,4,B0000CERP3,"I am a big Holmes' fan. I've read all the Doyle stories and I think of Jeremy Brett the quintessential Holmes. I've seen many, many other films that do not live up to the Granada series and Brett's take on the role. I've seen all the Basil Rathbone films and the Ian Richardson films. I've seen Christopher Plummer, Peter O'Toole, Rupert Everett (who did a fine job), Robert Stephens, and Christopher Lee play the role. Recently I had the displeasure of seeing Jonathan Pryce and Matt Frewer.  I haven't seen Peter Cushing, but I have it on order through Amazon. Uk.

This film is quite good, though.  James D'Arcy is excellent as Holmes. He looks young, but once you are able to get past that, he does a wonderful job. He's subtle, true, but his expressions and characterization is spot-on.  One of the things that might bother some viewers is Holmes' experience and activity with women.  From Doyle's stories, Holmes didn't show much interest in women (except for ""the Woman""). But, I can accept that a much younger Holmes might have.  I can accept that this younger Holmes who also didn't seem to mind the limelight so much may have changed a bit during the following years.

Vincent D'Onofrio was a perfect Moriarty. He was suave and confident-- and very evil. Although we don't get to know his character so much from this movie alone, you get the sense that there's an entire backstory to him-- he isn't flat nor two-dimensional by any means.

I wasn't sure I'd like Watson (Roger Morlidge) when we first meet him on screen, but he turned out to be smart, inventive, and brave.  None of the bumbling idiocy that I've seen in some of the Holmes' films.  He makes a formidable counterpart to Holmes, rather than a 'sidekick'.

Lestrade (Nicholas Gecks), too, was more in line with how he's depicted in the Granada series.  He makes mistakes, but he's honest and, for the most part, capable. He's a pleasure to watch.

Gabrielle Anwar was perfect as the love interest, Rebecca. Although her on-screen time is limited, she definitely gets to show her range.

Mycroft is played by Richard E Grant. Often, Mycroft is so interesting that the viewer (or reader) wants to learn much more about him.  This is true, here, in this film, too.  He's definitely a complex character.  I wouldn't mind seeing Richard Grant play Holmes in a future film. He's definitely capable.

All in all, this was a surprisingly good film.  Considering some of the stuff out there, I'm surprised this hasn't gotten better reviews. I don't think one has to suspend disbelief too much to accept Holmes as expressing an interest in women in his younger years.  This Holmes is a little less certain than he is in later years, but no less brave and no less intelligent. One can accept that he puts women aside as he ages so to concentrate on his work without distraction and emotional attachment. Holmes ends up a bit eccentric, but there is nothing in the canon to assume he started out less interested in basic pleasures than his peers.",1198800000,34,3007,4.680608365019012

I was amused by this young, attractive Holmes. In most of Doyle's stories Holmes is a young man, even though most actors who portray him are much older.

1919106,3,B0000CERP3,"The film begins with Holmes (James D'Arcy) in hot pursuit of his archenemy Professor Moriarty (Vincent D'Onofrio). They duel, and Holmes shoots Moriarty, who falls into an open sewer hole. Holmes looks down the hole and sees Moriarty carried away by the rushing sewage and presumes him dead.

This is a problem. No Sherlock Holmes (nay, no reasonable detective) would presume death in the absence of a corpse. Yet Holmes does. Firmly. That he is young should in no way prejudice him.

 Holmes ingratiates himself with the public coroner/pathologist, Dr. Watson, by proving insightful during the autopsy of a murder victim. And after that autopsy, he deduces the height of the murderer, along with other ""facts"", and he even has a name for the person. The Inspector, Watson, Holmes and the police go to the address of the alleged murderer, only to find him hanging in an apparent suicide. Holmes believes it is not a suicide, and eventually comes to believe that Moriarty did not die, and is still alive.

The film introduces us to some novel concepts that never saw the end of Doyle's pen: 1) Holmes had a personal vendetta against Moriarty because Moriarty drugged his brother Mycroft, leaving him so sick that he is all but convalescent; 2) that Mycroft was poisoned by anyone, much less Moriarty; 3) that Moriarty may have been responsible for Holmes's occasional cocaine and morphine use; 4) that Moriarty had an interest in the use of drugs at all.

Still, it's fine to be novel in one's approach.

D'Arcy's Holmes is sexy (so says the Netflix description). He is certainly young. D'Arcy is a fine actor, so it wasn't difficult to imagine his character as a maturing detective - indeed, that is what the filmmakers wanted us to think. The very last scene of the film makes that obvious. But D'Onofrio's Moriarty was confusing. His accent was sub par at best, and with a wealth of British actors to choose from, one wonders at this choice.

The plot is fairly straightforward. Moriarty has stumbled upon heroin, a drug that he seeks to sell both in the colonies and in England. He is taking out his perceived competition, traders in the opium market. While it's difficult to feel too much sympathy for drug dealers meeting a nasty end, it is Moriarty that is doing the killing, of course, and we want to see Holmes carry the day. There is a slight cat and mouse game played, and it is entertaining to watch. This is by no means a great film, but it is good.

It's interesting to note that Moriarty has become greater over time than he was during the writing of the books. He only appeared in, I believe, two books. Yet such is his fame that if Holmes had been chasing anyone but Moriarty in this film, it would not have been interesting to watch.

1919108,2,B0000CERP3,"Setting aside the gross inconsistencies with the original stories, this film does little to distinguish itself from any run-of-the-mill made-for-cable movie. The actors are adequate, and the production values are adequate, but the script is dull and predictable. There is nothing to hook the viewer in at all. The makers seem to concede this fact by throwing in plenty of cheescake (various women are eager to bed young Sherlock) that serves no narrative purpose and does nothing to add depth to any of the characters, for whom it is hard to feel anything but indifference. The romantic element is also just tacked on in the most generic fashion, and is ineffective precisely because the viewer could care less about either Sherlock or what's-her-name. There is plenty of filler, such as the recurring flashback of the villain injecting Sherlock's older brother with something nasty. The scene is filmed (or rather digitally dressed up) in a slick, MTV-ish style, but it lacks emotional impact, and by the third or fourth time we've seen it, it's just plain tiresome. The film doesn't even rise to the level of cotton candy; it's more like that dried-up, crunchy bit a chewing gum that used to come with a pack of trading cards. The only people who seem really enthusiastic about the project are the set and costume designers, and maybe some others involved in creating the look of the film. Because in the end, the look is all this film has to offer.",1165622400,3,1451,4.854838709677419
1919109,2,B0000CERP3,"The Sherlock Holmes film `Case of Evil' is, as the tagline says, about the `past' of the greatest detective. The made-for-TV film is based on the completely original story set in Holmes's younger days when he met Doctor Watson. I admit the idea itself is not a bad one. What is terribly annoying is the way they put together the clichd elements which you might have seen in the usual crime dramas, totally ignoring the Arthur Conan Doyle's books and our feelings towards the much-loved world of the sleuth.

James D'Arcy plays young Holmes before he meets Doctor Watson. Holmes is already a national hero because he killed (he thinks) the arch-villain Moriarty (Vincent D'Onofrio) after the Three Musketeers-like sword fighting. Now Holmes is very happy, popular with women, until he encounters another case that strongly implies that the master criminal is not dead.

But of course he is not dead. Everyone who chooses to see this film has some knowledge about Holmes, and they all know something about the waterfall and Holmes' Japanese martial arts skills. So when Gabrielle Anwar appears as aristocratic Lady D'Winter, we know that she is not what she appears, and we are in for the secrets in London.

But these secrets are only part of the whole merits of watching or reading Holmes's adventures. They also include the unique personality of Holmes that has become the legacy of all the human beings, and the dark-lit streets of the foggy city of London too. Sorry to report this, but this version `Case of Evil' has very little of them despite the very good title.

In fact the Sherlock Homes you see here is not your regular Holmes. Holmes sleeps with women; Holmes engages in a shoot-out; and worst of all Holmes is afraid of losing face, too much concerned about his fame while our beloved Holmes is a true gentleman, who would do none of this. Roger Morlidge plays Watson who is so clever that he can invent some gadgets James Bond would die for. Gabrielle Anwar shows her cleavage (yes, I confess, I like that part) and Richard E Grant appears as Mycroft with both legs nearly paralyzed. I still cannot comprehend the meanings of, or intentions behind these changes, and don't know whether they changed the basic setting with or without any purposes. If they have one, that must be to surprise us, and they did succeed in doing that, but not in the same way they intended.

I heartily welcome any additional materials to the Holmes world from the persons who truly understand why he and his London is still loved by billions of readers. Many of them including me would like to see his younger days, but not the puppy-faced playboy from a brat-pack.",1154822400,18,2659,4.734341252699784
1919110,1,B0000CERP3,"I'm afraid I must take exception with Ryan Piekenbrock's review of this sorry mess!  Far from Sherlock's best, CASE OF EVIL is closer to CONAN THE BARBARIAN than CONAN DOYLE.  Piekenbrock's review is rife with pithy and pretentious posturing in a sorry attempt to paint a Picasso with little more than good intentions and a pail of panda piss; the only mystery with CASE OF EVIL is why anyone would bother watching the thing...",1146096000,2,427,4.756756756756757
1919111,4,B0000CERP3,"In this fantastic made for TV adventure, we get to meet the Great Detective early in his career, and find out the basis for many of the things we have come to associate with the character. James D'Arcy, who did a wonderful job of portraying Lt. Tom Pullings in Master and Commander: The far side of the world, presents us with a Holmes who is actually HUMAN, as opposed to the emotionless, walking deductive machine as done by Jeremy Brett and others. His Holmes has uncertainies, even faults. He drinks, smokes, and even womanizes, as evidenced by a scene where after meeting two adoring young ladies outside Baker Street, he invites them up for a drink and as he begins to kiss and cuddle with one, her companion stands up and starts removing her dress and lacy victorian undergarments until she's nude. But this is a Holmes who is also driven by vengence to get the man responsible for crippling his brother Mycroft; namely Professor Moriarty. Holmes catches up with his nemisis early in the film and aparently kills him, leading to his public aclaim, but things are not as they seem, and Holmes later learns the Proffesor is alive and well and behind a rash of murders of Opium dealers in London. The chase is on, climaxing in a sword battle high in the interior of Big Ben.
Besides D'Arcy, the film has a good cast of supporting Characters. Watson is working as a CSI style autopsy surgeon at the yard, Moriarty has just the right sort of pompus evil about him, and Holmes is given a tragic love interest in an actress who once worked for Moriarty as a pawn to fool Holmes, but now, aids him in his quest to bring the Criminal Genius to justice, and when she is murdered before Holme's eyes, it lights the fire of vengence that will fuel the Detective's pursuit of the Napoleon of Crime all through his career.
Granted, some Holmes purists might have some exceptions to how this film deviates from Doyle's original take on the character and seting, but it is still a good gripping thriller nonetheless and I highly reccomend it.",1116374400,3,2033,4.587912087912088

7999190,1,B0000CERP3,"Look, I like D'onofrio as much as the next person.  And he seems to be having fun with his bad James Mason imitation in this movie.  But I don't watch a movie that's supposed to be about Sherlock Holmes to watch one actor chewing the scenery, no matter how well he does it (Take James Spader, for instance, in the totally unbelievable Blacklist).

But its STILL a bad James Mason imitation, and this movie STILL has nothing at all to do with the Sherlockian legend.

Here we have a Sherlock Holmes who staggers around London carrying a sword, indulging in swordfights, getting high on opium or some other drug, bedding every female that comes his way, and generally being a total boor and not very bright.  Chasing a Moriarty who is apparently a well-known flamboyant criminal who indulges in petty crimes such as minor blackmail rather than the thoughtful, highly intelligent silent spider in the middle of his unseen web who pulls the strings on major criminal enterprises without ever making himself known to the gendarmes, or even most other criminals.  The whole mystique of Moriarty was built around his anonymity and shadowy existence.

Then there's Mycroft - who, instead of the hyper-intelligent prodigy who surpasses even Sherlock with his powers of deductive reasoning, is instead a broken man who hides in his club in fear of a Moriarty who allegedly crippled him in his youth, for no apparent reason (and yet left both him and Sherlock alive, and in the case of Sherlock, didn't even hurt him - but tortured his brother and possibly killed his mother? one of many unclear plot elements).

And then there's whatever fat f*** is playing Dr. Watson as some kind of mad steampunk genius who invents all sorts of unbelievable weapons and instruments and in between butchering corpses in the goriest possible manner while allegedly performing autopsies and who, for no apparent reason whatsoever, latches on to Holmes when he gives every appearance of absolutely loathing Sherlock, and then totally turns around and becomes his best friend - again for no apparent reason.

Meanwhile our mustache-twirling villain, Moriarty, for no apparent reason baits Sherlock with a young woman who, for no apparent reason, Our Hero falls in love with and then, again for no apparent reason, Moriarty kills her rather than just shooting Sherlock and having done with it.  And at every turn, we have Moriarty saying ""Well I didn't see THAT coming"" or similar phrases when the hapless Sherlock somehow manages to accidentally surprise him.  If he had half a brain he'd have shot Sherlock and had done with the whole thing but NOOOOOOO.  That wouldn't let him twirl his mustaches and gleam and twinkle at us, clever rogue that he is.

In short, there is no apparent reason to bother to waste time watching this.  PASS.  Go find Jeremy Bret or even Basil Rathbone (with the updated-for-WW2-plots) instead.",1509840000,,2894,4.9137577002053385
