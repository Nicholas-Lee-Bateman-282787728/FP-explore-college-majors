6228947,4,B00HVBB140,Great old movie,1404259200,2,15,4.333333333333333
6228948,5,B00HVBB140,"Better than I remembered. Although it is just the DVD and not BluRay, the details are fantastic. Highly recommend.",1404172800,11,114,5.052631578947368
6228949,4,B00HVBB140,I give it 4 stars because I believe this is the recolorized version and not the original version that came out in 1939. Other than that it is exactly the same. What else can be said about a timely classic like this other than you have to have it.,1403568000,16,246,4.040816326530612
6228950,5,B00HVBB140,"Along with Cole Porter and Lorenz Hart, THE WIZARD OF OZ's E.Y. 'Yit' Harburg (it's often misspelled 'Yip') was one of the most original lyricists of his generation. Besides the many great songs he gave voice to in FINIAN'S RAINBOW, Harburg's unique style of wordplay is most evident here in Bert Lahr's ""If I Were King of the Forest"" and the poem that follows, ""Courage"":

Dorothy: Your Majesty, if you were king, you wouldn't be afraid of anything?
Lion: Not nobody, not nohow!
Tin Man: Not even a rhinocerous?
Lion: Imposserous!
Dorothy: How about a hippopotamus?
Lion: Why, I'd trash him from top to bottomamus!
Dorothy: Supposin' you met an elephant?
Lion: I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Scarecrow: What if it were a brontosaurus?
Lion: I'd show him who was King of the Forrus!

All three: How?
Lion: How?
Courage! What makes a king out of a slave?
Courage! What makes the flag on the mast to wave?
Courage! What makes the elephant charge his tusk, in the misty mist or the dusky dusk?
What makes the muskrat guard his musk?
Courage! What makes the sphinx the seventh wonder?
Courage! What makes the dawn come up like thunder?!!!
Courage! What makes the Hottentot so hot? What puts the ""ape"" in apricot?
What have they got that I ain't got?
All three: Courage!
Lion: You can say that again! Huh?

From Scarecrow's loose-limbed dance during ""If I Only Had a Brain"" to Tinman's 'hard'shoe routine on ""If I Only Had a Heart"" to Dorothy's sweetly poignant ""Over the Rainbow,"" the music of this classic movie raises it to a level that few others have ever even approached.

So many of us grew up watching ""Oz"" every Easter season on CBS-TV. Forty-plus years have since passed and with them our youth. Can one so along in life still relate to this ""kid's"" movie? The answer is a resounding YES. Its theme of visiting a mystical, mythical land far, far away is as old as humankind's first yearnings, a timeless, ageless desire that when fulfilled in our imaginations gladdens the heart, warms the soul and enriches the spirit.

If you haven't seen ""The Wizard of Oz"" since childhood, please do so again. You'll discover things in it and in yourself that may have been forgotten long ago. To those who still haven't glimpsed that land at the rainbow's end, the time is now. There's a scarecrow, a tinman and a lion waiting to escort you along the yellow brick road to Emerald City, home of ""the great and powerful Wizard of Oz!""",1397865600,15,2425,4.630232558139535

Well their mom stated they watched it everyday for two weeks in a row!  They can sing the songs and impersonate most of the characters so now its become one of their favorite ""make believe"" games during playtime.

The colors, once in OZ, are vivid and much better than I remembered. This film is a well loved classic for a variety of reasons. Wonderful music and fabulous character acting done by Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion, Jack Haley as the Scarecrow and Margaret  Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West and Mrs Gulch. If one has never seen this movie before, or even if one has, it is well worth going over the rainbow. Though I for one would be reluctant to come back.",1460419200,6,592,4.285714285714286

6229150,5,B00HVBB140,"The Wizard of Oz on blu-ray now with new HD transfer in 1:37:1 ratio courtesy on Warner bros
originally owned by MGM but now Warner bros has the rights to the film
the original dvd version was in 1:33:1 full screen as was the original Theatrical presentation back in 1939
well now that Warners has the rights to the film they've tried to expand the screen ratio a bit to 1:37:1
which looks slightly wider on screen you still get the black bars at either side but it's slightly wider than 1:33:1
the new HD transfer does look pretty Good probably slightly more cleaned up than the old dvd version
but warners have made more effort with the sound quality they have given a new 5.1 master audio mix for this blu-ray
which does sound better than the old Dolby digital mix.
about the special features, there's over 2 hours of extras that's for sure
one of the extras is a new retrospective Documentary, the rest of the extras are carried over from the old 2 Disc special edition dvd
this new Doco which is a new blu-ray exclusive is suppose to be feature length Doco on the making of the Wizard of Oz
according to the back cover
it's suppose to be the most Detailed making of retrospective well it's not
the back cover says feature length, well feature length is about 90mins or more long
this new Doco only goes for 70mins tops so obviously it's marketing Gimmick by warners, what else is new
this new Doco is excellent anyway it covers the script, the cast, the different Directors that tried to complete the film
the problems on the set, the Hazardous accidents, the films release and reaction, the Legacy
alot more can be said in 70mins that's why feature length means feature length
typical bulls*** from warners what else is new
about the rest of the extras, there's hours & hours worth of extras most of it are archive featurettes from the old 2 disc dvd set
plus you also get the TV movie Dreamer of Oz only a Digital remaster transfer of the film in 1:78:1 ratio
and you get the other versions of the Frank baum books that were made in the early 1900's in 1:33:1 fullscreen ofcourse
and lots of other extras, you can spend all day just watching the extras
the amazon product details on the listing says 1 Disc, well this is wrong dead wrong
this blu-ray reissue is 2 Blu-ray Discs in a standard blu-ray case that's it
5 stars for both 2013 & 2014 reissues so much content over 2 Discs, incredible!",1453334400,,2401,4.4343891402714934

6229217,5,B00HVBB140,"When this movie was made most people in the US lived in the country.  They sat in the dark theaters in small farming communities surrounded by dirt roads and fields, the browns and dusty greens of rural life, much like the Kansas of Dorthy's home.  When Dorthy opened the door of her house and walked into OZ they too were awestruck with the blaze of color and exotic images of the munchkins and good witch Glenda.  A perfect venue for the color movie and special effects which delight us even today.  A cast of highly talented people who dance, sing, and act relying on their talent and skills honed on the stages of vaudeville.  This is a must have for a movie buff for it's historical significance.",1431993600,,701,4.488188976377953
