I don't think even today we would know if there is a sister planet on the other side of the sun 93 million miles out from the sun circling at the same speed as us. Could be they are years ahead of us in tect  or a million years behind us. Could all the u f o's we see are from there. The movie sure gave me something to think about.

6991971,5,B00ST5TC4S,"JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN [1969 / 2017] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] You Will Meet Yourself Face-To-Face . . . When Earth Meets Its Duplicate in Outer Space! Original and Intriguing!

Classic Sci-Fi adventure and suspense has never been more exciting as when you JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN [Doppelgnger original title]. One hundred years in the future, two astronauts are sent to uncover the secret of a duplicate Earth on the other side of the sun. When they crash land three weeks earlier than they had planned, they must embark on a life-or-death mission to determine whether they have arrived back home or on the strange mirror world. This imaginative space adventure offers a journey few will ever forget!

FILM FACT: To create the illusion of the parallel Earth, the images of say the reversed text, both quickly and cheaply, the production staff inverted the film negatives using an optical process known as ""flop-over."" This technique saved the time and money that would otherwise needed to have been spent in building sets and props with specially reversed elements, or organising road closures to film cars driving on the ""wrong"" side of the road. However, the scenes set in or around the parallel EUROSEC Headquarters required careful rehearsal and co-ordination with cast and crew prior to filming. The incorporation of the flop-over technique results in some continuity errors: for example, the terminals of the Heart Lung Kidney machines on-board Phoenix are seen to be connected first to Colonel Glenn Ross and Dr. John Kane's left wrists, then their right.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: In the 1960s, pretty much nobody could touch Gerry Anderson who had pioneered the Supermarionation format of television programmes in the UK with action/sci-fi series like Supercar, Stingray, Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and their most famous output, Thunderbirds. These shows used marionette puppets as the characters, but it also utilised some fantastic model work and spectacular special effects. So in 1969, riding high on all of those TV series success, ITC President Lew Grade, who is always credited as Lord Grade, agreed to finance a live-action feature film that Gerry Anderson and his wife Sylvia Anderson would co-produce and write. The result was JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN (aka Doppelgnger), that is basically like a Supermarionation film with people and not puppets, but there is of course brilliant spectacular model rockets and other over the top effects.

Though directed by American director Robert Parrish, whose only other film I have heard of is the over the top spoof James Bond film Casino Royale in 1967, which I loved, but a lot of people hated, as it was not pure James Bond genre, but this film has the magic touch of Gerry Anderson and Sylvia Anderson, who were part of a team who did the screenplay. JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN was a $6,000,000 British sci-fi film which and received a less than enthusiastic response upon its initial release.

JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN plot of the film revolves around The European Space Exploration Council (EUROSEC) has sent up a probe to orbit the Sun called, are you ready, Project Sun Probe. The probe locates an object, a planet, orbiting the sun in a pattern such that we have never seen it before. A new planet! Unfortunately, EUROSEC scientist Dr. Kurt Hassler [Herbert Lom] is selling information to the Eastern Block and now the Soviets now about it. EUROSECs director Jason Webb [Patrick Wymark] wants to hurry and get the West to the planet first, so he makes a deal with NASA to send up one British astrophysicist named Dr. Kane [Ian Hendry], the man in charge of the Sun Probe project, and seasoned U.S. astronaut Colonel Glen Ross [Roy Thinnes], who is famous for being the lead in the sci-fi TV series The Invaders.

After being in suspended animation for three weeks, Dr. Kane and Colonel Glen Ross awaken and see the new planet, which looks eerily familiar. They cant quite get the readings they need so they decide to land on it. Their lander crashes on the rocky terrain and Dr. Kane is badly injured. Theyre soon discovered by a Mongolian rescue worker, and are they back on Earth already, as it is only been three weeks? With Dr. Kane in the infirmary, Colonel Glen Ross is questioned about why he abandoned the mission, which he maintains he didn't and that something weird is going on. Colonel Glen Ross is also having trouble seeing things properly and getting more confused all the time, because everything looks backward. When Dr. Kane dies, an autopsy reveals that all of his internal organs are on the opposite side of his body, mirrored. Colonel Glen Ross then realises that maybe it is not he who is seeing things backwards. Maybe the other planet is an exact mirror of Earth and the mirror worlds Colonel Glen Ross is on regular Earth right now? Well, the film never really answers that, but Colonel Glen Ross does make a new rocket, dubbed Doppelgnger, to try to go back.

What I love about the Supermarionation film is the brilliant model design elements and the amazing special effects work. Derek Meddings had worked with Gerry Anderson as the model maker and special effects guy on the TV shows for a number of years, and he was promoted to Special Effects Director from Stingray onwards. With the film JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN, Derek Meddings was also the Special Effects director, and there is a great deal of them in this Sci-Fi film. Every wide shot of the EUROSEC base, and every shot of the rocket and other flying implement, the planet, space itself, and even some of the backgrounds in the film were all Derek Meddings models. While the models certainly have the look a lot like Thunderbirds, I think they are totally awesome and I would watch more films like this any time. Derek Meddings went on to do more special effects for the bigger films including all of the four James Bond films in the 1970s that starred Roger Moore, and the final film Moonraker, which was nominated for Best Special Effects at the Oscars. Whilst perhaps sadly not fully exploring the concept of a parallel Earth in any meaningful way, but there is still much to recommend about the film JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN, particularly if you are into the classic retro look of the 1960s futurism is something you enjoy. This is a very classy curiosity piece, that should have had been a longer film to realise its greater potential. Released the year after the film 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Apollo 11 moon landing, the Supermarionation film has reached cult status, with many Gerry Anderson and Sylvia Anderson fans viewing the film as a ticket to true Gerry Anderson and Sylvia Anderson fandom.

For lovers of 1960s futurism there is much to enjoy in Bob Bells customarily retro art direction and from the fashions, to the sets, to the vehicles and its a future which very much brings to mind the look of Gerry Andersons follow-up TV series UFO. The film music score by Gerry Anderson and Sylvia Andersons regular composer, the legendary Barry Gray and is one of his best and features cues which were also later used in TV series UFO. The miniature effects work of Derek Meddings, which included Thunderbirds, Captain Scarlet and UFO is as always top-notch and fans of his particular design aesthetic will not be disappointed.

Also it would not be a Gerry Anderson and Sylvia Anderson production without stuff blowing up and JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN is no different, especially with a spectacular explosive finale to rival anything seen in Thunderbirds. It has always remained a mystery as to why things in Gerry Anderson and Sylvia Andersons productions tend to explode not once or twice, but three, four, or five times or more. Not that Im complaining, I just love watching stuff blow up, especially with a Gerry Anderson and Sylvia Anderson production value, but it is something Ive often wondered about. That idea of beauty, of course, is countered, in the films finale, when man makes a mistake with his technology, and disaster blossoms.  But still, there are moments in JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN that veritably promise a golden age of space travel and space technology. These moments still have the capacity to inspire. This imaginative space adventure offers a journey few will ever forget! But in reality, I have always wondered if there is actually another Earth Doppelgnger in complete opposite on the other side of the sun and I wonder if we will ever find out. One thing I was totally baffled and confused was right at the end of the film when Patrick Wymark who is seen in a wheelchair and starts racing towards the mirror and crashes into it, to the point it left me high and dry and wondering was there any kind of logic, especially with his state of mind, which obviously he was definitely not in his right of mind or was it they had run out of money and this last scene was the consequences? Answers on a post card please?

Blu-ray Video Quality  Universal Studios brings us a stunning 1080p Technicolor encoded image and an equally impressive 1.85:1 aspect ratio, which is far superior to the inferior DVD release. Colours are strong and luscious. Black levels are deep and good. The space scenes are very effective and the details on the modelling work are clear and look realistic. The 1.85:1 widescreen shape focuses compositions, while the better resolution reveals the added grain and flat colours of several optical shots. All in the entire overall image looks out of this world. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Universal Studios blasts us into outer space with just one 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio experience. There is great clarity when it comes to the dialogue, music, and the awesome explosive sound effects, as well as crashes, and the firing of the rockets really makes you feel you are actually there, and other aggressive sound effects really resonate and give your speakers a good workout definition and exactness. Dialogue is very straightforward and very clear throughout the Sci-Fi film.

Finally, JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN [1969] is a perfect example of late 1960s British popcorn fare overseen by one of the best showmen and interesting sci-fi writers of the day. If you can overlook the eccentric quirky screenplay, you end up with a pretty good gorgeous and weird mixture of grown-up ideas and children TV show visuals. And, hey, if you're a classic Doctor Who fan, you can catch Nicholas Courtney, who played the Brigadier, in a small role, and perennial villain Philip Madoc in a slightly larger one. Also, I suspect when you see certain scenes, you will be saying, Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who is that gorgeous reflection I see? Although parts of this sci-fi tale require a major suspension of critical thinking, But JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN [aka Doppelgnger] is nevertheless a very enjoyable experience harking back to a different era in film-making. The spectacular modelling and even more spectacular special effects are brilliant, while the theatrical acting, psychedelic effects and dramatic music help create a vintage, surreal sci-fi experience. If that isn't enough, there is plenty of entertainment that can still be had from watching a 1960s style vision of the future, along with its whacky cars, sliding doors and world where everyone either wears a turtleneck sweater or a plethora of mini-skirts. The only disappointment is that there is not a plethora of extras. Highly Recommended!

These three ingredients make for a hit film.  I love B-movie sci fi classics with low budgets, cheesy sets and acting, but the bigger budget movies like this one are great too.  The look of the movie is really good.  Just the fact too that it's not another story about either going to the Moon, going to Mars, or alien visitors makes for a nice change of pace.  If I made a Top 5 list of my favorite pre-1970 sci-fi movies it would be included.  There are one or two sci-fi movies of this same era that get a million times more praise and notoriety that I won't mention because I don't want to get into a debate about what boils down to personal taste, but this movie in my opinion is better.",1463529600,4,855,4.176829268292683

On the Blu-Ray that I received from Amazon, there are no special or bonus features. Indeed, the only special feature is that you can select the chapters. This is disappointing to me.

6991997,3,B00ST5TC4S,"BOTTOM LINE: This film is simple harmless fun and it's a charmingly stylized piece of 60's esoterica for Brit & old school sci-fi fans. 3 STARS

THE STORY:  A duplicate Earth-sized planet is discovered on the opposite side of the sun and, after much political pontificating, a space shot is launched to explore it.  Roy Thinnes, (star of the cult 1960's TV series ""The Invaders""), is the leader of the astronaut team sent to investigate the doppelganger planetoid. TWILIGHT ZONE-style plot twists abound here; if you've seen much sci-fi you'll figure out the ""surprise"" ending long before anyone in the film does.

THOUGHTS: I originally caught this years ago on a late night TV airing and was pleased to see it getting a hi-def release. JttFSotS is a fun flick, just not as engrossing as I remembered. Roy Thinnes is quite good here, plus there's the usual parade of Anderson series' regulars to flesh out the cast. Definitely has Gerry & Sylvia Anderson's unique visual fingerprints all over the finished product, making it enjoyable for the 60's-era gadgets & ""retro-futuristic"" look, if nothing else.

THE BLU-RAY:  Universal Studios' Blu-ray for JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN arrives in excellent (if unspectacular) shape. The picture & sound are top-notch and there are a few extras tossed in for good measure. Worth owning if you're a fan of such fare.",1443916800,10,1364,4.908695652173913

6992000,5,B00ST5TC4S,"I first saw this film when it was broadcast on TV. I knew then as now that to enjoy this film I needed to suspend a cart load of disbelief. I have never been a big fan of Anderson's productions and his use of what I considered, even as a child, poor FX models. That said I loved the ""what if?"" ideas that made up their movies and live action TV programs. I keep waiting for someone to wake up and do a serious remake of Space 1999 (Season One only) and UFO. My ""what if?"" with CGI and good writers extrapolating out what might really happen to both populations, Earth side and Lunar side.

Speaking of reality I would probably give this film a 2 or 3 star review at best if I was to see it for the first time now(keeping in mind it's age), but over the years I have enjoyed playing with its premiss, with my addition of a ""worm hole"" to the story, in my mind. So when I saw it  available in blu ray I couldn't resist. The best analogy I can make watching it again, 40 some odd years later, is like playing an old playstation one game; You know there are far more sophisticated games and game systems, but some times a little retro, that made you happy then, is a lot of fun today.",1442534400,,1180,4.060085836909871

I always look at movies in the time period they were done, and not compare them to today's over-CGI'd movies of the modern era.

6992009,2,B00ST5TC4S,"At first glance I confused this with another, more recent sci-fi film with a similar title, which I liked quite a bit.  Alas, this isn't that film.  This is a 1969 production recently re-released on Blu-Ray.  OK, admittedly it does have a slightly interesting plot.  For me, nothing else really worked.  Way too much time waiting for something to actually happen.  What seems today like primitive special effects.  The so-called acting.  The--I hesitate to use the word ""script"".  The physical impossibility--not improbability but impossibility--of the basic premise, which actually should qualify it as a fantasy movie rather than sci-fi.  But I digress.

Some have said Plan 9 From Outer Space is the worst movie ever made.  If so, then I shall re-name this one Plan 8 From Outer Space because it really should rank somewhere in the bottom 1% of films.  Go ahead, torture yourself if you wish.  I give it an F+.",1436832000,2,913,4.882352941176471
6992010,4,B00ST5TC4S,"This 1969 movie is beautifully restored. The color is great and everything is crisp and clear. For its day, the special effects were very good.  In fact, one of the spacecraft looks eerily like NASA's not-yet-designed Space Shuttle.  This is not an action thriller. The plot and screenplay are more subdued and cerebral. Although it may not be the most imaginative science fiction story even written, the movie is certainly enjoyable. Its tame G rating even makes it viewable by the entire family.",1436054400,4,497,4.975903614457831

6992014,1,B00ST5TC4S,"What a waste of my money! My failure was in only reading one or two reviews; had I realized it was a British film, I would not have purchased it, but I bought it because of the main star whom I remember playing in a sixties television show. Anyway, it was boring and there was little suspense to enjoy, nor was there was much of a story. Of all the DVDs I have purchased through the years, this one tops the list in regards to being the absolute worst waste of money.",1433289600,,467,4.086956521739131

6992018,3,B00ST5TC4S,I thought the movie was better than what I remember it being watching it a while back. Got it because I like the actor Roy Thinnes but it was disappointing especially the muppet movie setting for the end of the movie. Did not mingle with the live portion of the film so it was hit and miss and a little confusing. But If you like the actor Roy Thinnes than the 1960 series The Invaders is an excellent series for your collection you will not be disappointed check it out.,1431561600,4,471,4.2444444444444445

6992020,5,B00ST5TC4S,"Yes, the special effects are a bit dated, but for 1969, the miniatures are pretty impressive and many of the shots hold up incredibly well. Derek Meddings went on to do the special effects for UFO, which was another Gerry and Sylvia Anderson project, as well as several of the James Bond movies. An interesting story with a great cast, including Roy Thinnes and the late Patrick Wymark, who basically steals every scene that he's in. In a lot of ways, this was a movie that was well ahead of its time and one that never really received the recognition that it was due.",1431302400,6,568,4.471153846153846

8699157,5,B00ST5TC4S,"It is the dawn of the space age. A space probe comes back with the news of another planet in an orbit opposite of earth. Due to the fact that security was compromised, we have to hurry-up and check it out with a manned probe. We send the top astronaut Colonel Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) and top scientist John Kane (Ian Hendry) on a three week mission to check it out. Instead, they return after three weeks.

Why did they turn back?
What is upsetting Colonel Glenn Ross?

Of course, we know the answer but it is fun watching the characters discover the secret.

The clothing and props naturally reflect a 1960's concept of the future. The space ship models look a little hokey but when you get used to it, the story is fun and well acted. This movie will make a good addition to you cultural history collection.",1526860800,,810,4.386666666666667
