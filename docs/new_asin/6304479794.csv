893900,3,6304479794,"Yeah Baby! Austin Powers really did exist, if one can believe this Presley curiosity. I mean, groovy chicks, kitschy psychedelia and one smooth lead combine to assault the senses, a la our Mr. Powers. All right, so Elvis  doesn't talk scouse, but he does have a cool way with the women, one of  whom happens to be his (on-screen) adversary, and who's pretty stylish  herself (Nancy S).
So that no-one goes away without a (wry) smile on  their face Elvis even gets to NOT win the climactic race! Wow! Now that was  radical, but even better would follow as Elvis adopted a different (read:  less wooden) screen persona and  experimented with more contemporary  situations (bedroom scenes, branding and glimpsed nudity).
However, by  that stage no-one really cared anymore, and this slightly whimsical piece  was swiftly consigned to late night TV.
Best song: ""Your Groovy  Self: Singer: Nancy Sinatra (solo). At least E still got the girl!",935193600,2,937,4.9423076923076925
7873368,5,6304479794,"The movie came in excellent condition and arrived quickly. Elvis and Bill Bixby are in a race to see who can win in the Daytona 500. It's a challenge for both of them, but Bill wins in the first race. In the second race things heat up as they go around the race track and in the end Elvis wins to the delight of the crowd and especially his girl. This movie is an attention getter because of the action. Get ""Speedway"" and you'll be glad you did.",1363305600,,446,4.079545454545454
7873369,3,6304479794,"I saw Speedway at the drive-in in the summer of 1968 ! so it holds a special place in my mind. Not a bad movie .. and a few good songs. Let Yourself Go featured in this movie was also featured in the 68 Elvis tv special. Nancy Sinatra looks very hot in this movie,and Elvis as always is his cool self. A good family film !!!",1057795200,2,324,3.8507462686567164
7873370,5,6304479794,"Everything about ""Speedway"" is as groovy as Elvis always performs. I just love the way Nancy Sinatra performed the song ""Your Groovy Self"" and the way she moved around as she sang. Nancy's really hot! Bill Bixby was quite hilarious. Elvis' song ""Let Yourself Go"" is super cool. The scene where Elvis sang ""Your Time Hasn't Come Yet, Baby"" to the little girl was kind of cute. And the sounds of those roaring engines in the race were very much electrifying. Some of the plots really did show off Elvis' real-life self as the generous and giving person he was. He buys for a friend and his 5 little girls a brand new station wagon, also helps out a troubled waitress with her upcoming wedding. Unfortunately Bixby's character messes everything up for Steve Grayson (Elvis), by betting Steve's money on the horses, instead of paying for those things Elvis bought for his friends, and besides makes an outrageous tax claim form for Steve, with deductions such as perfumed record albums and [money]for air? Oh yes! Lucille Ball's ""Mr. Mooney"" was kinda funny too and was excellent for the role of the head IRS agent R.W. Hepworth. When I first saw this movie in the theater I cracked up at the ""He's Your Uncle, Not Your Dad!"" sequence. It was funny it was cool. Just everything about ""Speedway"" is superbly exciting. But what else could you expect out of a movie that starres the king of rock and roll! And lets not forget Nancy Sinatra who is more than just the icing on that cake. It's not everyday you see such a gorgeous tax collector.  I give this film a perfect A+. It's just loaded with the stuff! ""Speedway"" is an honest to goodness must see.",1035331200,6,1646,4.579661016949153
7873371,5,6304479794,"""Speedway"" is not too bad for being one of Elvis' last 5 pictures. I like the restaurant ""Hangout"" because the booths are cars. Elvis and Nancy Sinatra blend together in ""Speedway"". Bill Bixby is Elvis' ""buddy-buddy"" manager, who thinks he's a chick magnet, like so in ""Clambake"". He's only there for comic relief. Elvis is the true star. I like the fight scene where Elvis punches the man who plays Paul, a rival stock car driver, into an open elevator. ""Speedway"" still proves Elvis rocks!",1019260800,4,491,4.788235294117647
7873372,5,6304479794,"Elvis Presley and the daughter of Frank Sinatra. But I bet you may or not know is that Elvis and Nancy met for the first time after Elvis came back to the United States after being in the army for 2 years. Most of the songs are sung by Elvis Presley with only one sung by Nancy on her own, and the title of the song is ""Your Goovy Self"". Steve Grayson (Elvis Presley) is a race car driver who wins races. And Nancy plays Susan Jacks. And in the film, Presley's character lives in a trailer. and Bill Bixby plays his manger.",1001116800,,523,4.087378640776699
7873373,2,6304479794,"Okay here is my opinion.  One of my favorite actors in the whole universe is Bill Bixby.  If Bill had not been in this movie, I would've gave it 1 star.  I have respect for Elvis as a singer but he could not act worth a lick!  This is another typical Elvis movie, that you just sit through it and by the end of it you think to yourself that you have spent 50 years watching this movie.  I think that what makes me like it a bit is because of Bill Bixby being in it.

7873374,2,6304479794,"By 1967, enough was enough with the light fluff comedies starring Elvis Presley. Throughout the 60s, Elvis was being humiliated making bad movies like TICKLE ME and HARUM SCARUM while The Beatles and Bob Dylan were  changing the music scene.
In SPEEDWAY, Elvis plays a singing race car  driver (for the third time!) who gets into trouble with the IRS. He falls  in love with Nancy Sinatra, and that's about it for the plot.
The only  saving grace is that the cast is better than average. It's quite  interesting to see Elvis act alongside ""Lucy"" regular Gale  Gordon. The songs are a little better than average, especially the quite  good ""Let Yourself Go"".
Again, it's not that bad. It's a  definite improvement over CLAMBAKE, but a far cry from JAILHOUSE ROCK or  KING CREOLE.",960768000,9,778,4.746268656716418
7873375,3,6304479794,"One of those Presley movies that even the diehards have no time for - yet another ""formula"" flick. But this one, like many Elvis movies, deserves an objective second chance: there are alot of surprises here.  Probably the most interesting is the rare occasion that elements of Elvis'  real life are reflected in his movie character - it is well-known that he  was hopefully generous, to the delight and sometimes consternation of many.  In the movie he constantly goes out on a limb to help down and people. I  thought that was a nice touch. Also, the fact that he does NOT win the  (well-edited) race at the end, and good-naturedly uses that result as an  excuse to really rock it up back at the club with a delirious cast number.  Another positive is the teaming of Elvis & Nancy. They handle the  lighthearted proceedings nicely. It should also be pointed out that Nancy  Sinatra's career was at a peak when made this movie!  Speaking of the  music, we can certainly hear a revitalized Presley - especially on the  title tune and the closer he really lets loose. (There is a remarkable  difference in these cuts and the previous ""Clambake"" session.)  The film yielded a minor country hit, ""Your Time.."", as well.",960595200,5,1215,4.665094339622642
7873376,3,6304479794,"Granted, Elvis Presley, great entertainer that he was, was by no means the world's best actor.  Very few singers-turned-actors make it, and by chance he did.  However, reasons for his popularity as an actor most likely were  carried over from his incredible success as a singer.  Nancy Sinatra, also  a great entertainer, starred in a handful of movies, and like Elvis, does  not retain any credible acting ability.  Thus, they are the perfect match  for each other in ""Speedway.""  The humor is pure corn, the songs  are so-so, the story is borderline pathetic.  Therefore, all the fun Elvis  and Nancy are having in this film (and it is evident making this film was  fun) does not carry over to the audience. They're both charming, but  complimenting more is stretching it.  Highlight: Nancy mustering up some  love and affection on her rousing solo, ""Your Groovy Self.""",946339200,,871,4.903448275862069
7873377,4,6304479794,"Gee wiz, these guys reviewing this movie are harsh.  I mean, come on, this was 1968 after all, and I'm sure the director wasn't expecting to win an academy award for it, for Lord's sake.  It's  suppost to be a  ""fun"" movie -- and it is.  I like  the sense of humor through out  the film -- like when Elvis is listening to the radio and the announcer  breaks in:  ""This is a special bulletin. All of the animals have  escaped from the zoo.  That is all"".  I'm sittin' there crackin' up  over gags like that.  It's a great film to watch even if you're the most  casual of Elvis fans.  You get to see Elv lean, good looking, singing away,  etc. Another thing -- As I've stated it is a ""fun"" movie -- This  is something that seems to have eluded films over the last ten years or so.  Everything is so serios and PC today -- It's like the string ran out on  making comidies like those old Elvis pictures.  That old saying: ""They  don't  make films like that anymore"" rings true. Rent or buy it --  you'll enjoy it.
