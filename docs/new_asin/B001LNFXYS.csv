The Spanish Civil War breaks out and he has only one son, played by a very multi- talented Miguel Bose.
This son though spoiled is the apple of his father's eye. He can do no wrong. In fact without his father's knowledge he is carrying on in a sexual affair with one of his father's past conquests. So, it is without saying that since the war broke out and many men are joining up sides and going to war. The father is concerned that he just might loose the love of his life. In his father's heart when there's a war there is no right or wrong side. The loss of losing you child is a heavy price to pay even if there is victory. His wife has another mode of thinking. She believes the old fashioned way that if he is destined to die in the war there will be nothing she can do to prevent it and she believes in dying for a cause.
The father would rather not take sides and let the war run it's course. However, anyone reading this who is a parent knows that after a certain age you are limited in protecting your children. They eventually have to learn how to drive, how to live on their own and if their beloved country is facing a Civil War, they may even be forced to pick sides and die leaving the parents with a void that can never be replaced.
This is a real heart breaker of a film. Anyone having a son or daughter in the service of any country can relate to the terrors and the torment the father is feeling. While others may side with the mother's attitude thinking the ""cause"" was worth the sacrifice.",1255132800,,1758,4.188790560471976
