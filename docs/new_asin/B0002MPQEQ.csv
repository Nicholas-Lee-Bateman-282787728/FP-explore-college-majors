8029540,4,B0002MPQEQ,Educational learning tool for anyone wanting to pursue Guitar.,1427932800,,62,6.0
8029541,5,B0002MPQEQ,Just got the DVD and watched most of it. I got this DVD cuz I ran across a clip on You Tube and thought it would be worth getting. At the beginning of the DVD Don Latarski does sagest getting the book as well because it has more info in it. I feel that the instruction is solid and when I got to the end of the DVD I was hoping for more. I do hope that there will be a part 2. If you want to learn some basic music theory then this DVD is for you.,1269302400,4,447,3.5714285714285716
8029542,5,B0002MPQEQ,"I bought this recently and watched the whole thing. I think all begining guitarists (and some more experienced too!) should know a little something besides just picking up a guitar and learning to play cover songs. This DVD has it all. The instructor is solid. He goes over everything nice and slowly so you have time to ingest and comprehend it all. He does everything very methodically so you're not learning by skipping from one thing to another, then back again, like some other DVD's I've watched. (It may seem repetetive but you can always skip to the next part - there is a lot to learn and memorize afterall!)
For the guitarist (new and old) who want to learn what the intrument is all about this is a perfect tool. You'll be able to understand where soloing comes from, how chords are formed (not just what chord is what so you can play songs) and the techniques of finding things on the fretboard.
So far, I have learned that the more knowledge you have on guitar THEORY, the better a guitarist you'll become!
Totally worth the cheap price.",1211846400,15,1050,4.560846560846561
8029543,5,B0002MPQEQ,"The fact is that, unless you're a punk rocker (3 chord rock), one cannot arrange varied/weaving (interesting) music without basic music theory knowledge.  One must understand what the ""major scale"" is, how it relates to chords and, ultimately, ""modulating"" to chord progressions in different keys.  Without this knowledge, music is a dead-end street.

I've tried other theory learning materials and all of them were confusing by iether a lack of restraint and/or organization.  Guitar Theory Basics is just that: the basics...taught in a simple, linear fashion that works. Even I, with a doctor diagnosed case of ADD, absorbed all the information on this disk.

It has on-screen tablature, so there no need to fetch en extra booklet and being able to read music notation isn't necessary. Just pop the DVD in and learn.",1185062400,19,818,5.120300751879699
