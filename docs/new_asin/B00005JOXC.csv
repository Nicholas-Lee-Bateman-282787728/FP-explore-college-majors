1547452,3,B00005JOXC,"Bones is a show that is inches away from perfect.  Its character design, story telling, and humorous dialogue easily carry the show through each episode: right into a train wreck.

The idea is simple: take the Odd Couple and have them solve crimes.  While that may be simplifying things to their basest roots, the show does add in their own touch to the mix.  Booth and Brennan are experts in their respective fields: Booth is a former Army Ranger turned FBI agent, and Brennan is a brilliant criminal anthropologist at the top of her field.  The catch is that neither of these two people knows a thing about their partner's field, leading to awkward, and often humorous situations often involving Brennan eagerly asking for a gun or Booth using the most basic of terms in the midst of deep scientific conversation.

The actors do a great job and perform excellently with the mix of drama and comedy that comes in every episode.  The episode writing is always interesting, offering a good range of murders to solve, and often has the two main characters drawing themselves into the crime.

Doesn't sound so bad, does it?  So where does the train wreck start?  Any time there is any emotional dialogue the show falls apart so quickly it can nearly ruin a perfectly good episode.  The emotional dialogue might as well be written by George Lucas: it's that bad.

Overall, Bones is a drama that's so close to being great that it's frustrating.  Not every episode has the accursed emotional dialogue, and the ones that do usually only have 2 minutes of it.  Hopefully with Season 2 the producers will see the light and hire some dialogue specialists.  If it happens, there's no doubt the next season will get 5 stars.",1150070400,5,1712,4.697986577181208
1547453,5,B00005JOXC,"I am one of those viewers who came in halfway through the season.

However, I am absolutely hooked.

A character analysts by nature, I am enthralled by the very real and endearing personalities of the characters in the show. From world, multi-faceted Booth to the awkward but extremely intelligent Zach. While Tempe is the main character, Booth steals the show. The way his character expresses his views and opinions very loudly without giving to much about his past away makes you feel like he is someone you know.

In addition, Booth has very real problems and a very complicated past as so many of us do. He grows and changes before your eyes. In each episode you see a different part of him. The viewer believes that they have him figured out when in reality it is impossible to understand who he really is. I don't even believe the writer completely knows the character of Booth. I find myself curiously awaiting what he'll do next. You never now exactly how he'll react to any situation and that keeps you intrigued. Also, he appeals way every person differently because each one of us knows a person who is in some way, Booth.

Tempe is sweet and endearing, almost like a child but very intelligent. She keeps a lot to herself, and many times the viewer just wants to give her a hug. She is stubborn and strong-willed, but vulnerable and cautious. Temperance is so out of touch with the world and her inability to recognize bands and songs is always comical. Her habit of taking most things literally is also adorable. However, she is very intelligent and a little quirky. After all she tells Booth, ""my best relationships are with dead people.""

Angela is Tempe's ever present friend and adviser and it is obvious that the to depend on each other. Angela keeps Temperance partially in tune with the real world and also helps her with social problems. The viewer does wonder where Tempe would be with a friend like Angela.

Hodgins is your typical man. He voices his opinions loudly and loves a good argument. However, he does have a caring side and it is easily seen in his relationship with a certain character. Hodgins is easily annoyed and quick to think up a conspiracy theory. He and Zach make for very good comic relief.

Zach, the youngest of the team is an interesting individual. His near genius IQ marks him as a very smart individual. However, all he really wants is to fit in with the rest of the group. He isn't really sure where he belongs. In my opinion he looks at Tempe as a little bit of a motherly and nurturing figure. He is awkward and a little nave, but comical and cute.",1148947200,2,2601,4.568669527896995
1547454,5,B00005JOXC,"I started watching this from the beginning, intrigued by Fox's promos.  I had no idea who David Boreanaz or Emily Deschanel were, so I went into it with no expectations.

The first episode was a bit awkward, but I saw something exciting there.  I was a huge fan of the X-Files, and when Booth's character made reference to Mulder and Scully in the pilot, it made me snicker, because I didn't think that this was going to live up to the X-Files standard.

I was wrong.  After a few episodes that played around with the characters, they finally found the right mix, and it quickly became one of Fox's best, right up there with 24 and House, MD.  David Boreanaz is absolutely wonderful, managing to make us giggle and cry, sometimes even in the same scene!  Emily Deschanel is adorable too, and while she comes across as slightly wooden at times, it doesn't detract from the story because her character is supposed to be very detached.

The supporting cast is also brilliant, with the socially awkward 'squint squad' rivalling the Lone Gunman for both comic relief as well as professional contribution to the cases.

I'm looking forward to this coming out on DVD, and I hope Fox continues to promote and work with this show, because it has the potential to be the best.",1148428800,8,1266,4.616071428571429
1547455,4,B00005JOXC,"Bones started weak but eventually got very smart and exciting episode by episode. It was pretty obvious that the writers are brainstorming on the way as the season progresses, and wrote a few ""try-out"" episodes. But eventually they got into it, settled down with a solid ideal in where the storyline is going (and of course that's after it's being confirmed that Bones is staying for a second season YAY!) and the story became very strong.

David Boreanaz, our beloved actor of Angel, has dazzled us once again with his talent of the ability to take on muli-different roles and personalities. His Booth character's silliness, humor and charm takes a while to get use to (after that depressing depressing season five of Angel can you blame me?). But it was definitely a breath of fresh air, it helped us move on, lean us away from that horridly sad reality of a fantasy (heh) and gave us a character who isn't in constant danger of sinking into hell or turn evil or being misunderstood. It was a great change, and I'm almost out of Angel withdrawal, just a few more seasons and I will be out of my depression (I think... :P). He captured that ex-sniper ex-ranger but at the same time a very normal average American perfectlly! His talent showed off in that fantastic episode Soldier In The Grave, in which his dark side and inner conflict surfaced as well as his breaking down of emotion of the ""things he did"". It was a brilliant performance.
  On the other hand, the Scully (so to speak) star and main character of the show, Dr. Temperance Brennen, lovingly addressed ""Bones"" by her partner Booth, was the perfect scientist. Although Emily is just not a good actor as David, she tries very very hard in trying to master her role, had lots of practice, and her acting got better. But from Woman In The Limbo, I was deeply disappointed to see that she had not shown ANY natural talent in mastering human facial expression. The writers set it up perfectlly for her- denial, grief, nostaligicism, sadness, anger... but her transformation from each emotion has no precision like that of David, so not only was it unnatural, but it made her acting very ""hard"". Before that I've always thought it was her role, that she is suppose to be like that. But sorry, you are either convinced or you are not; when you have your mother's skull in your hand, there must be at least SOME difference, but she seemed like always, with the blinking of the eyes and the firmness of the jaw (that sometimes makes it like she was yelling), it just did not go well. And it made me (sadly) realize that the reason why she's SO PERFECT for this role is simply that she LOOKED like the perfect Anthropologist. David's performance made me BELIEVE the horror of what he did, even though it wasn't something that is conceptually wrong, I was utterly convinced just how horrible it was. But Emily's performance did not waver me as much, even though her condition should've been the one that has the most appeal to me. David is just light years above Emily I'm (almost) sad to say. But heck, practice makes perfect, maybe as the series goes on Emily will get better and better, who knows, her acting is not as nearly as bad as some of the others I've seen. But I can only say that from the overall reflection of this season, she still has a way to go.

This show's strength lies at the chemistry-filling character interaction. Booth and Brennen has lots, in which Booth drag Brennen further down to earth and turn her more and more into a human being (so to speak hehe), and Brennen gives Booth hope every day with her brilliancy that no matter what, they will catch the killer.

The only thing (other than Emily's acting on that last episode) I did not like is the Hogins/Angela arc. It was too sudden and made the storyling too inconsistent. To be honest, as the series progress I found myself liking Hogins less and less, he is a very interesting character yes, but he just got so annoy, and then the writers feel need to have a Hogins/Angela chemisty, sorry, I really didn't like that.

The cliffhanger at the season finalle set up season two very well. I only ask of the writers to not make Bones into an Alias-like scenario for the second season; basically please please don't change the characters over and over and over again and make us guess and guess and guess, believe me, that will just completely tire us out to the point of annoyance. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy mystery, but even mystery has a limit, if you go over that limit, the storyline will get ridiculous. I'm only hoping that that won't happen.

I look forward to season two and beyond, hope the DVD comes out (*clear throat* IN THE US!!!) soon!!!",1148342400,9,4688,4.553973902728351
1547456,5,B00005JOXC,"Bones follows the work of forensic antropologist Temperance Brennan and FBI Agent Booth as they use skill and science to solve difficult cases. The chemistry between the characters (all of them, not just between Brennan and Booth) sparkles. The character development is superb and you will find yourself genuinely caring about each of them.

I only hope the DVD will be out shortly. The season is nearly over!",1147392000,12,409,5.014705882352941
1547578,5,B00005JOXC,"This show surprised me. Unlike the usual detective/cop murder shows, this one has insight into the construction of a murder: bone, tissue, bugs, facial reconstruction. The characters are very personable and different, making the mix intriguing. The ""squints"" from the Smithsonian Institute who are all high IQ geniuses in their field and the lone macho FBI agent who tries to get workable information out of them is hilarious. I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who likes murder mysteries with the focus on laboratory findings and an outclassed, frustrated FBI agent trying to get the ""squints"" to speak in simple layman terms so he can solve his cases.",1518393600,,669,5.146788990825688

1547921,5,B00005JOXC,"This has been a great show. I enjoyed watching it when it came out on tv and I enjoyed binge watching it.

The characters are mostly believable. Temperance Brennan, also nown as Bones, is a scientist. She works at an institute similar to the Smithsonian. It doesn't say specifically but it seems to me that she might have high functioning autism (or something simiilar). She thrives on routine, clear directions and she does not do well when plans change and often doesn't understand humor. Somehow Bones and an agent Seely Booth have great chemistry, despite their many differences. Together, along with a team of scientists, murder cases are solved.

What makes this show is not the crime solving but rather the fun chemistry between all of the characters.

The cast is fabulous and talented. The setting is interesting and only adds to the show. The characters have access to all sorts of interesting technology and what they don't have access to, they are able to whip up with equipment on hand.

1548052,1,B00005JOXC,"Can't reccommend the series.  It's hard to believe Dr. Reichs lent her name to it.

Characters are terrible by comparison to the book.  Dr. Temperance Brennan, in contrast to the humble, recovering alcoholic, divorced mother of a college student in the book, is an arrogant, smug single woman.  Her on again, off again boyfriend, Andrew Ryan, who, in the book, discovers much about himself & his life & is equally humble, is again portrayed as smug & egotistical.

I tried two episodes of the series & could take no more.  As someone who works in health care, I couldn't believe we were seriously expected to believe that a doctor would show up at a scene with decomposition, which would obviously include insect infestation, in expensive designer wear & dress shoes.

Start from the first novel, which I do believe is ""Deja Dead"", instead.",1465776000,,840,4.8321678321678325

Yeah, that's it. And she looks at gory dead bodies, where maggots have taken up squatter's rights, and tries to work out how they became dead (the bodies not the maggots). There's also  a guy who works for the FBI (hey, guy & FBI rhyme. I'm a poet and I don't know it). And a couple of other hot women and a few dorky guys.  Anyway They all get together in the Jeffersonian, pick the bones of the victims clean, like a vulture at a bar mitzvah, and do some pretty damn fine crime solving in a thoroughly entertaining way.

There's more chemistry between the characters than you'll find at a crystal meth convention. And the script is sharper than a tack who's a member of Mensa. This raises the plots above the ordinary and takes them into the rarefied air of that small percentage of TV shows that are actually worth watching.. well, when there's no decent sporting events taking place.

Buy this, watch it, and you won't be disappointed... unless you are... in which case it's obviously your fault and not mine.",1460678400,,1191,4.577464788732394

1548430,4,B00005JOXC,"I am a fan of procedural crime shows, and was a loyal follower of ""House"", so of course I watched ""Bones"" when it debuted. And, overall, I liked it. The dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments. The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see. I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think ""CSI"" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene. xI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.",1438300800,,911,4.364705882352941
1548431,3,B00005JOXC,"The DVD content is top notch, and a review of the program itself is not necessary, but Season One deserves to be singled out because it has been pressed on ""two sided"" discs, which is not only cheap and stingy on the part of the manufacturer, but also puts the program material at risk.  Two sided discs are clumsy to handle, easily subject to scratching, dirt, dust, and fingerprints, and prone to glitches which cause pixilation and freezing up.  The ones I got in this set came scratched and suffer occasional picture problems, although I can generally ""nurse"" them along and see the episodes all the way through.  The program itself deserves top rating, but I am giving this set only three stars because of the ""two sided"" discs.  Fortunately, seasons two and onward are done properly, on single sided discs.",1437782400,5,812,4.73758865248227

I find it provides a pleasant focus during my exercise - I limit myself to an episode every time I exercise. Though I am not into gruesome, their depiction of bodies etc. has major visual impact. Generally the dialog is very entertaining - not always believable, but it is entertainment.
The only episodes I am not a fan of for this or any other series are flash backs with the actors in prior time periods.

1548545,5,B00005JOXC,"Just finished watching the first season of BONES for the second time since I purchased it in November 2008. Originally I watched the first four seasons before I stopped. Lately I've been having a hankering to watch BONES again. I miss it especially since I won't watch any current or syndicated episodes of a series I've purchased to view on DVD until I finish watching the entire DVD collection. It's been so long since I watched this DVD set that I forgot the discs were double sided. When it didn't play well I cleaned my DVD player and had no further problems.

Oh how I've missed these folks. How great it was to be reintroduced to gorgeous buff Seeley, the deep voiced handsome director at the Smithsonian, Hodgins the curly headed conspiracy theorist, the chronic PhD candidate-lab rat Zach, sexy artistic creative Angela, and then there's socially challenged Bones with her big brain and pretty expressive eyes. Hearing again Seeley's jokes and labels given to the ""squints"" are still laugh out loud funny. Watching Seeley's admiration grow with each solved crime. It's amazing how Brennan can tell a story with just bones. The rest of the team uses whatever else is found in and around the bones to assist in the apprehension of the bad guys & girls.

Each episode is a creative story based on the books by Kathy Reichs. In the TV series it seems as though the characters have taken on a voice of their own. These episodes are often both fun & sometimes gross to watch, but there's also poignancy, anger, energy, excitement, suspense and a mystery.

Brennan's insensitivity shows she has a lot to learn. The anticipation of what she'll say next or how she'll respond during a situation increased my enjoyment of the show.

Since it's been so long since I first watched this DVD set (five years), each episode still has a lot of surprises. Seeley was the best person to join the Jeffersonian group. He balanced out many of their quirks. He and Temperance were perfect partners. The rational scientific mind and the intuitive gut hunches combine to be great crime solvers. I eagerly look forward to finding out more about Bones' family. Wonder what will Hodgins and Angela do? Is Zach going to be forced to leave to finally finish his PhD? What will happen with Seeley, his son and his romances? I'll be beginning Season 2 later on today. I can't wait!!",1428796800,6,2360,4.720873786407767

So I returned it and asked for a replacement. The replacement came and I should have known it wasn't going to work because the case had the same markings as the first one I bought.

1548795,5,B00005JOXC,"I don't know why I never wrote a review about BONES....but...I really didn't like the first couple of shows so I dismissed it. For whatever reason I decided to buy the DVD of Season 1 (I'd give it another chance) which led me to Season 2 which led me to Season 3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9! Guess I liked it after all.

The premise of the show as everyone knows by now is  using forensic science to find out who the (usually murdered) person is when they have been out in the cold, the heat, over a tree, burned beyond recognition, skin eaten by bugs, smushed, smashed and in some form of disgusting and how with this science these labrats  not only find out who the person(s) are but also who killed them (that's where the FBI Booth (David B) comes in.

I loved David Boreanez in Angel and Buffy but for some reason I can't explain I didn't like him in the first couple of shows...but...when that wit came about (which is so appealing) that got to me and I wanted to see more.

Bones is 'Booth's'' his pet name for  Emily Deschanel  who is the head forensic genius in the lab. Eventually they would get together (as we knew they would but it took forever). The other characters are a great backdrop and have story lines of their own. I adore 'Hodges"" - known as 'bug boy'....but everytime he is talking, playing, using bugs for one thing or another (like they used leeches in the old days) I cringe. This is one phobic gal writing this.

In  the end Hodges is another genius and can tell all kinds of things about 'bugs' and how they help in various ways (still ick). All I want to do is not see them at all or kill them so those parts are a little creepy to me.

In any event the stories are great, the actors are terrific. I do have something I've been wondering about.. Angela (in the lab) is an artist and she comes to work and all of a sudden she knows a hell of a lot about a lot of 'stuff' that she wouldn't know about unless she'd studied for years-confused? me too! But she is adorable so who cares!

There is fun, and mystery and romance and pathos (and yes, I cry a lot) and icky stuff all around and so much more. I won't go into all the aspects of the series as some others have already  done that maybe more than you wanted to know-some things have to stay under the table for the viewer to find out for themselves.

I will tell you I've seen the DVD's at least three times so that tells a story (or does it?). Yep, I'm a fan!

Check it out, it's a great show and I can't wait to get the DVD for year l0....what in the world comes next as they've done everything ....or have they????

We have to see a romance with 'Sweets' the therapist (profiler for the FBI) and he is one adorable guy. I'm waiting for a romance for Cam, the head honcho of the lab and the list goes on.

I have reformed completely and so I tell you-check it out! It's really a good show.

Now I'm going back to watch the 9th DVD -and who knows, maybe there will be another viewing!

Thank goodness for a lousy memory-some of it is like seeing it for the first time!",1417651200,,3039,4.156996587030717

1548875,5,B00005JOXC,"One of my all-time favorite TV series, perhaps unmatched for quality season over season, when you think how many seasons and how many flawless episodes they've cranked out so far.  Many topnotch series tend to peter out or go soft after the first five seasons and the syndication requirement has been met.  Many don't even make it that far before the quality drops off.  There's just the right blending of comedy and drama to keep the mysteries both poignant and fun.  In fact, with rare exceptions, getting on to my all-time favorites list pretty much requires nailing that balance between the comedy and drama just right.

The over-arching story lines connecting seasons, moreover, work.  I find this tends to be the weakest component of most long-running TV series.

I own the series in Blu Ray format when available, but the DVD-only seasons are fairly crisp, excellent transfers.  That's my one nitpick; they should treat their fans better and have all seasons available in Blu Ray.",1414368000,,987,4.9393939393939394

The subsequent seasons get better... so if you're one of those people that has to watch each episode of a show, try to get this one as cheap as possible.",1405987200,,451,4.317647058823529

Every DVD in the set is filled with stutters and gaps. Some of the episodes are completely worthless. 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment chose to use double-sided DVDs that are especially thin which, apparently, caused the DVDs to be unreadable in any of the three DVD players and two computers I tried. DVDs for the remaining seasons are also exceptionally thin and have stutter and gap problems but are not TOTALLY worthless. I threw Season One away. As a corporation, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment clearly values profits above the satisfaction of their customers. They should be ashamed.

Halfway through the show the dvd began to have tiling with the picture. The picture had a frozen frame and would not advance. The only thing you could do was advance the dvd forward to the next show. So I am left with the decision of buying another season one and hope it doesn't do the same or keep what I have with the screwed up episode.

1549301,5,B00005JOXC,I really like this series and the way we are gradually introduced to a wide variety of complex characters who grow almost every show.  I have not read the book or books so do not know whether the portrayal Brennan as a high function aspergers is consistant but it seems that as the series develops her autism gets worse.,1384560000,,320,4.423728813559322
1549302,2,B00005JOXC,"My review is for the quality of the DVD release itself and not the quality of the show. I'd give the first season of Bones 5 stars if it wasn't for the double-sided discs, which were completely unnecessary and highly annoying, and the most poorly conceived navigation menu I've ever seen for a series release. There is no ""play all"" option, which I normally always use, and to further annoy the viewer, when you click on the episode title, instead of playing the episode it takes you into a menu for that episode so you have to press play a second time. When the episode is done playing it takes you back to that episode menu instead of the main one which means you have to manually return to the main menu to go through the main and episode menus for the next episode in order to play it. The sound and video quality of the episodes themselves are great and it's one of my favorite shows, but why on earth they designed the menu this way and cheaped out on double sided discs just boggles my mind.",1383868800,4,998,4.3138297872340425

1549373,4,B00005JOXC,"This is a really fun show. There are plenty of serious moments, and even a little action. But the comedic moments are what really makes the whole thing worth watching. The Booth character's background is pretty clich, but many of the other characters are well-thought out. Good fun for those CSI, NCIS, and NYPD Blue fans out there.",1379721600,,332,4.741379310344827
1549374,1,B00005JOXC,We finally had the time to begin watching the first series of the Bones TV show that we ordered from this seller. When opening the case we discovered blank DVD's not DVD's original to the series. It looks like someone made a pirated copy of the televison series. And when viewing the DVD's we discovered that over half of the episodes were missing.  We would not buy from this seller again. I do not believe in breaking the law by receiving illegally DVD's of movies. It is against the law to copy them and we do not like receiving only half of what we ordered.,1378771200,4,561,4.3428571428571425
1549375,5,B00005JOXC,"In watching the first season, I was reminded that many of my favorite episodes are from the first and second seasons. The opening (Pilot) episode is especially good. The first five minutes are worth the price of admission, when Booth arranges to have Brennan detained by homeland security at the Washington airport, just so he can stage a rescue for her. The plan backfires when Brennan flips the officer who tries to detain her on the airport floor.

There are two or three more incidents like that in later episodes. Even better is when Brennan brandishes a huge silver revolver, which I can only guess is a 357 Magnum, but without the long barrel on Harry Callahan's revolver. Another stand-out episode is when the whole gang is trapped in the lab when it is shut down by a quarantine, over Christmas. A third is a late episode starring Adam Baldwin in his classic ""loose cannon"" kind of role which began in ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Firefly.""

I actually rather like the role of Dr. Daniel Goodman as ""the Boss"" in place of Camille Saroyan, who replaces him in season 2, because she becomes, after about half a dozen episodes, not much more that ""one of the guys"" as Brennan reclaims her role as alpha dog (she is even above the ""king of the lab"" game between Zack and Hodgins).

The one thing I noticed is that within that one season, Booth and Brennan got so close that Season 2 seemed to be dedicated to putting some distance between them. I also like the character of Sam Cullen, Booth's boss, who brings a sense of reality to the fact that sometimes Booth seems like he can do anything he wants, without FBI management and direction. He and his family play an especially poignant role in this season's episode 20.",1376697600,8,1721,4.5811688311688314
1549439,5,B00005JOXC,"This show is really good.  It's a who-done-it show, with plenty of humor thrown in.  It can be gross when they find a dead body, but keep in mind it's fake, just a TV show.",1376697600,,172,3.8857142857142857

1549533,5,B00005JOXC,"Season one is what I call the pilot season for one of the best TV programs ever to be put on the air.  It is superbly produced with fine sets, excel. photography, sci-fi story lines,
brilliant cast and humor galore that should keep many a folk happy.  The choice of Emily Deschanel who I had never heard of before (I knew of her equally beautiful sister Zooey) as Dr Temperance
(Bones) Brennan along with David B. (can't spell his name!)was a brilliant bit of casting.  She is a great actress whether she is a humanitarian or a self-centered bitch.  And she is so
beautiful to watch.  Angela and Hogkins along with Mr Goodman are also great choices.  The first two seasons I call ""pristine"" because they set the table for Bones & Booth to become identifiable
personages and develop their personalities.  Their interplay & bickering remind me much of Ron Weasley & Hermminie interplay in the HARRY POTTER series which of course I purchased in the entirety
from AMAZON.  Also reminds me of Capt. Kirk & Spock relationships.  Some of the sexual blather bothers me a bit for a prime time show but I guess that's the way things are today.  Never-the-less
I give five stars to this season and the rest of the seasons to FOX for the superb overall production quality of the films.  Nice goody gore touches also!
  Note to FOX: for future seasons from 9 on, bring back Zach, dump the moron Dr Sweets and give more time to Bones, Booth, Angela, Hogkins & Cammile: love them all!

Then there is no reminder. I tried watching this series a few times and each time at the beginning of season 2 I would get mad because the plot fell apart. It was not until I took out a magnifying glass and read in tiny print around the inner part of the last disc that I read about other episodes on the flip side. So, on my third try of watching Bones I got to see the missing episodes. Now Season 2 makes sense and I can continue watching and enjoying.

1549886,3,B00005JOXC,"Bones sounded like an interesting show & amazon had the first season for a really low price. Bones is a pretty good show. I realize that ""Bones"" (the female anthropologist) is SO into her work that she is totally clueless about normal every day to day things in the outside world, but they really run that into the ground. She also has a genius ""student"" working for her who is also totally out of touch (& clueless) with the outside everyday world. I realize that this is the ""joke"", but honestly they take it a little too far. So much that Bones talks in monotone much of the time, & after a while it gets a tad annoying that everything has to be answered in a scientific manner. (I get the joke.) But like I said, for me it gets old real fast. They advertise there is so much sexual tension & great chemistry between the 2 main characters but I don't see it. (I didn't buy it for that reason anyway, but they try to play that angle up in the show & I don't see it.)  It comes across to me as 2 friends trying to get to know one another better & that's nice. (If you want sexual tension & great character chemistry watch CASTLE) The show is well done (although sometimes a bit gruesome) & the scientific angle is very interesting. (They've come a long way since QUINCY) Some of my ""dislikes"" could be because it's the first season - sometimes first seasons are a bit rough. I was going to purchase the 2nd season & rate the show 4 stars, but I had such a hard time trying to get through the last 5 episodes I probably won't buy anymore. ""Bones"" talking in monotone & being dull I couldn't take it anymore. (I guess that's why my sister didn't like the show either.)",1358294400,3,1667,4.2421383647798745

If you're trying to find a good set to buy - don't buy this one.  The disks don't run properly, some episodes play fine, but sometimes they skip or lag, and sometimes an episode just won't load at all.  I was really excited to get the whole series on a black friday sale, but if all of the seasons have this problem I'll be very disappointed and return all of them.  Seriously Amazon? You're better than this...",1354320000,4,515,4.333333333333333
1550013,5,B00005JOXC,"If you are a fan of CSI (and who is not?), you will probably look sceptically at this show, which seems to following in the tracks of this major franchise. Well, you would be wrong. ""Bones"" does much better than just following - from the first episode it actually switches to its own ways and, if put in parallel with the venerable CSI, it could very well take the lead. And here is why.

First, there is Bones herself. She is incredibly inteligent, succesful, pretty, liberated, courageous woman, fully in control of her life and perfectly able to kick a bad guy's a.. without any problem if needed. In one word, she is a genius, but she also has a serious case of social autism, which makes many of her interactions with the regular society histerically funny. As a forensic anthropologist she clearly is very comfortable around the skeletons - but her relations with living are not half that succesful. And when the recent deceased are concerned, just wait for the scene when Booth takes her for an autopsy...

Then, there is agent Booth. I always liked very much David Boreanaz (""Buffy"", ""Angel"") but I was a little concerned if he still can play without turning into a vampire every two minutes or so... well, he can!! His caracter is great - he is clearly a macho, good cop but clearly not genius (unlike people he works with), in principle just a honest, simple guy - but with some secrets in his past, very much in control of his life and having some really funny habits. Quite smart, handsome and with sense of humour - Booth is surprisingly likeable.

Then there is the relation between Bones and Booth - I must say that I enjoy watching it almost as much as the one that existed between Mulder an Scully. They are soooo different that they simply can not stop bickering and both being smart and having humour (although for Bones it is a little... skeletic) they exchanges are a delight. Just wait to see the episode in which Bones is charged with murder!

There is more. Other members of the team working in the criminal anthropology lab are as irresistible as the main characters - there is Zack, the genius young anthropologist, who is even less adapted to life in society than Bones. There is Dr Jack Hodgins, ""slime and bugs guy"", who actually is almost normal - the stress is on word ""almost"". Finally there is Angela, an adorable Eurasian girl, who actually is an artist as much as a scientist - she designed software for graphic projects and adapted it for the reconstruction of faces and bodies from remains. She is the merriest and most normal person in the lab - although the way she gets the attention of clercs in crowded offices will probably surprise you...

Stories are good, some of them very hard. The atmosphere is less gloomy that in CSI and there is definitely much more humour. After watching Grissom and his team for years I really was ready for something new, as smart as CSI, but freshier, funnier, less macabre and - surprise - even more original. I bought the first season and swallowed it in a couple of evenings. I can't wait to buy the second.",1352937600,,3083,4.567811934900543
1550014,4,B00005JOXC,"Generally I'm not a fan of procedurals (shows without a continuing story, where each episode stands on it's own and is
about 'procedure'; legal, medical, etc), but this is as close to an exception as I'll get.

Give credit to excellent writing, directing and acting, and having supporting characters that are rich and really add
something to the show. When it's at it's best this can be downright terrific, bringing me to tears more than once, and
making me laugh out loud a few times too. It's sometimes very smart.

On the other hand, it only hits that level of excellence every 5th episode or so. The rest are mostly fine, (one or two
really don't work) but often you can see the twists coming a mile off, or the jokes get a little stale (e.g. Bones' complete
lack of familiarity with common cultural references is funny... for a while).

The show is at it's best when the episodes are really about the inner lives of our running characters, and not simply about
brilliantly (and inevitably) catching the bad guy/gal. Or when it's dealing with the more human side of forensics - the grief
and pain of those left behind. That's when the show moves way beyond 'clever crime of the week' status.",1352764800,3,1195,4.60093896713615

1550017,5,B00005JOXC,"Since I didn't start watching bones until the second season, I hadn't seen the ""pilot"" episode. Thus, I was happy to see that it was included within the list of episodes available via my Kindle Fire HD. I found it very interesting that the relationship between ""bones"" and ""Booth"" hasn't changed too much from the pilot up to the point that they develop a more intimate relationship. However, that is not to say that ""Bones"" hasn't quieted down somewhat since the pilot. I also found that the supporting characters present throughout the series have maintained their ""pilot"" character. All in all, I believe that people who see the pilot before the remaining episodes will not be disappointed. The only area that surprised me somewhat was how the number of characters have grown throughout the series. However, the addition  of the characters familiar to series regulars only make the series more interesting. I especially enjoyed watching it via my Kindle Fire HD connected to my HD flat screen TV with the sound coming from my hi-fi system.

The character quirks make it a much more interesting show than your standard crime-solving show.

The discs in this collection surprised me by being two-sided, which I haven't seen in any other tv show collection (or any other seasons of Bones), but I find the economic way of creating more with less material a good thing (even if I was confused at first).",1348876800,,741,4.408759124087592

It doesn't help that Brennan is portrayed as a young woman with no social characteristics. She is totally ignorant about everything, and is allegedly too brilliant to care. So she hires an intern who is very similar.
So why did they get rid of him in season 3?

The series should be called Leuton Lab in deference to the old Peyton Place my grandmother used to watch. Bed hopping, sexual innuendos or blatant comments. TV has really deteriorated.

I am watching reruns from the first season, so here's the basics: Bones - a super smart anthropologist that teams up with a hunky FBI to solve murders. I just did a review on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prophecy-of-the-Flame-Love-s-Dawning/dp/B004KKXSNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prophecy of the Flame - Love's Dawning</a>&nbsp;and it inspired me to do a review here as well. I was talking about how Bones went to a small town to find out why a human hand was inside a bear... every guy in the town was drooling over her - they were all making passes (annoying the hunky FBI agent, Gosh what is his name?). I realized that in just about every episode, there is someone trying to bed Bones... In other reviews of what is not one of my favorite books, they called the main character Reba, a Mary Sue because she has a couple of hot princes after her.

So does that make Brennan (Bones) a Mary Sue... what exactly is a Mary Sue?

Man, how did I get so off course! Bones... If you haven't seen it, it's a must!

I feel another review coming on... lol!

The fact that it takes place is in previously male macho FBI-forensics is no coincidence. That this shamelessly gender-revisionist show can still keep us engaged is because forensic anthropology intrigues, the cast-chemistry is good, the writing is often creative, and despite the well-engineered sexual tension it takes half a dozen seasons and dozens of installments for boy to get girl - just kidding! - girl to get boy, of course...:)",1335398400,,1438,5.662037037037037

And I've been hooked ever since (although I regret to say lack of cable has put my behind a bit).

The first season of Bones definitely introduces us to all the characters.  In fact, Bones is named after the main character of the story; Temperance Brennan, a brilliant, if socially awkward forensic anthropologist who can definitely be considered a genius.  She is the best at what she does, and that is identify people from their remains.  And FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth, the one who gave Bones her nickname, needs her for cases.  So she agrees, on the condition that she gets to go into the field with him.  And thus starts a partnership that works for both of them, solving crime with his people skills and her deduction and logic.  They have the help of a few others of course, the people Bones works with in the lab, including her assistant (also an awkward genius) Zack, her friend and an artist Angela, and Jack Hodgins, who investigates blood and slime.

Episodes
**This section could contain spoilers, you have been warned**

Pilot:  Bones and Booth investigate the murder of a woman found in the lake, who leads to someone a little bigger and badder than they may be prepared to take down.  We also get a close look at all the characters and a bit of their history.

The Man in the SUV:  When a diplomat appears to have blown up a car in a terrorist attack, killing himself at the same time, Bones and Booth try to find out why.  And the clues lead them to a plot even more dangerous.

A Boy in A Tree:  When a teenager is found dead of what looks to be a suicide at an exclusive private school, Booth and Brennan investigate to find out why the school seems to want to keep it a secret.  There were also plots against the boys family, convuluting the case.

The Man in the Bear:  One of the more exciting episodes, Booth drags Brennan out to a small town called Aurora where the remains of a man are found in a poached bear.  More clues lead them to believe they are chasing a cannibal in the small town.

A Boy in a Bush:  The remains of a small boy are found and when his foster brothers don't appear to be telling the truth multiple suspects arise.  A look into the boys history also finds some secrets that causes Brennan to relive a little bit of her past.

The Man in the Wall:  When Brennan gets into a fight at a club, and exposes a dead man behind the wall, she stumbles into another case.  Drugs, music, and rivalry seem to be behind the murder.

A Man on Death Row:  Howard Epps, a man that Booth arrested is about to be given a lethal injection when he implores the team to reopen  his case.  They find a lot more than they bargain for and new clues cause them to question how the case was investigated the first time.

The Girl in the Fridge:  After opening a tossed fridge and finding the remains of a girl, Brennan goes head to head with an old lover and teacher on a case.  She believes that it was murder, while the old lover believes it was accidental. And the jury is hard pressed to decide who is right.

The Man in the Fallout Shelter:  Ah the Christmas episode.  Now that I've watched more of the series I was able to appreciate this episode better.  When a contamination forces the team to stay in the lab over Christmas, they learn a little more about each other, and about the body that started it all.

The Woman At The Airport:  The remains of a woman are found in LA, but she has been so cosmetically altered that they can't figure out who she is.  With the help of a screenwriter/FBI agent, they look for clues to see who the girl may have been once.

The Woman in the Car:  A woman is found burned and her child missing.  The father is a witness on a high profile case and refuses to cooperate until his child is found.

The Superhero in the Alley:  A boy, dressed as a superhero, is found in an alley where the only clues to his death are in the comic book he helped write.

The Woman in the Garden:  When a gang member is pulled over with a body in the car, Booth and Brennan find it hard to investigate due to the people's fear of police.

The Man on the Fairway:  After investigating an airplane crash, bone fragments are found that indicate another murder happened in the same place.  And a man who's father went missing is more than willing to help Brennan find clues to the murder.

Two Bodies in the Lab:  Brennan is nearly shot while working on a mob case but it only further determines her to keep going to find the killer.  Booth wants to keep her safe but isn't prepared to keep himself safe as well.

The Woman in the Tunnel:  A body is found in the tunnels beneath the city and it may be because of hidden treasure.  Booth and Brennan have to find the treasure before the murderers get away.

The Skull in the Desert:  This is probably my favorite episode of the series, although it is very sad.  Angela is visiting a boyfriend out west when he goes missing and a skull appears.  She asks Brennan for help because in her gut, she thinks it may be him.

The Man with the Bone:  At the bottom of a tunnel dug in pirate country, a man dies, but dies with a 300 year old finger clutched in his hand.  Had they actually found something, or was he murdered for another reason?

The Man in the Morgue:  And quite possibly my least favorite of the series, for reasons I can't even quite figure out, this episode has Bones in New Orleans.  She is helping identify remains after Katrina when she wakes up in a pool of blood and has no recollection of what has happened.  But when a doctor she is working with turns up murdered, she is the main suspect.

The Graft in the Girl:  The FBI main guy's daughter is in the hospital with a rare cancer.  Investigation proves it came from a bone graft, which was illegally harvested from a sick man.  Bones and Brennan have to find out what happened as it could effect quite a few more people who may have gotten transplants.

The Soldier on the Grave:  A murdered soldier in Arlington cemetery has the team scrambling to find out what happened.  It also raises questions to what happened overseas when another soldier died.

The Woman in Limbo:  When helping to identify remains, the skeleton of Bone's mother is identified.  This leads her to make contact with her mother and come to terms on the abandonment as a child but raises more questions than it answers.

All of the episodes are pretty exciting and interesting in this series.  Sure there were some I didn't care for, but the majority kept me hooked.  And the last episode had a good tie in to make you want to watch the second season.  But because this is a forensic show, there's a lot of nasty scenes.  Some of its gory, some of its gruesome, and some of its bloody, icky, sticky, etc.  This is not a show for those people with weak stomachs.

Casting was extremely well done.  I can't say there isn't any character that I don't like in this show.  I especially like Emily Deschanel as Bones.  She plays her role well and I actually identify with her a little bit when it comes to social awkwardness, although I am nowhere near a genius like her character.  David Borneaz as Booth, well he's eye candy, but he also plays the sensitive tough guy role extremely well.  He's actually the heart of the show I think and I couldn't imagine watching it without either one of them.  The side characters are all great too and I would be hard pressed to watch the show without Angela or Hodgins.  Zack is interesting, although cringe worthy in his behaviors at times.

They filmed this show pretty well.  Camera shots are good and while you know you're not actually there, it doesn't always feel like you're watching tv.  Of course that could just be because of the humor thrown in making everyone seem like real people.  I do have to say that whoever they hired to put music to the episodes is doing a great job.  I love all the music and have actually downloaded several songs as a result of watching an episode.  It may actually be why I like the one episode ""The Skull in the Desert"" so much.  I am completely enamoured with the end song.

A great show, but definitely one that should be watched in order.  Maybe after you get to know the characters its ok to get out of sequence, but its really hard to develop that connection if you just jump around episodes starting out.  I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes crime or medical dramas with just a small twist of humor.

1550171,1,B00005JOXC,I bought this as a gift thinking it was a Boxed Set. It is nothing more that the first five seasons shrink-wrapped together.  I should have read the other reviews.  Do yourself a favor: add the individual seasons to your cart and save $20+,1327104000,2,239,4.409090909090909
1550172,5,B00005JOXC,"I watch this show every week.  It has some comedy mixed with drama and mystery.  The characters work great together and the supporting cast is amazoning.

It shipped in record time and in perfect condition.  I love buying my stuff from Amazon!",1327104000,,243,4.714285714285714
1550173,5,B00005JOXC,"Bones is a great series.  Seasons 1-5 had some ups and downs.  But a very well written show with developed characters that are entertaining.  Episodes were for the most part one and done, with some story arc's taking up more than one episode.  Many can be watched alone and out of order, though you miss some of the  shout outs to past happenings.  A great series, highly recommend the DVD's as they are definitely re-watchable and still entertaining..",1326844800,,452,4.730769230769231

1550279,4,B00005JOXC,"I love watching Bones! I have gotten addicted to it. I like how Booth and Brennan completely offset one another with their views on the world. Booth is very down to earth and practical while Brennan is very rational and logical and she does not understand when a decision is irrational or the logic behind Booth's decisions or his answers. The entire staff at the Jeffersonian works well together with the different world views that they bring. When someone is down, there is someone there to cheer them up. They have each other's back. Overall I would have to say that this is very well produced show completing each other's values and belief systems.",1323043200,,652,4.728070175438597

I could understand that maybe they wanted to save money but not putting 4 episodes on each disc, but I mean come on. Episodes on both sides of the dvd. It is stupid. It is really easy to get your fingerprints all over it.

I'm glad they got rid of the black eye makeup and let her natural beauty show through.  Whoever thought that original makeup appropriate must have thought they were making the Adams Family.  It is a quite addictive show although I am sorry they got rid of Zach.  I thought he was an interesting character.

The disks of season one are double sided and are supposed to contain episodes 1-4 on side A and episodes 5 and 6 on side B. However, on my disk episodes 1-4 were on BOTH sides of disk 1. So I did not have episodes 5 and 6. I don't know if this was a major manufacturing accident that happened to everyone or if it just happened to mine. I didn't send it back like I could have done though because I wasn't very concerned about them. Aside from that one little mis-hap everything has been great.",1312761600,11,619,4.115702479338843

I was very disappointed to see that it is still packaged very cheaply, with episodes on both sides of the disc. With no ""safe"" place to put my fingers, or set it down for a moment, it is impossible to avoid scratching.

I would happily pay a few dollars more for a re-packaged version, in the style of seasons two to five, if it were to become available. If it ISN'T re-packaged, when this set inevitably gets scratched, that's it. I'm not buying it again with episodes on both sides.",1312416000,5,578,4.392523364485982

I'm a pretty big fan of this show, and had initially purchased all 5 currently available seasons individually. I was really irritated that season 1 was on double sided discs, so when I saw this box set, I had to pounce. I must say that I'm a bit disappointed. I was hoping that season 1 would be re-issued on single sided discs, similar to what happened when the House season 1-5 box set was released. Either the market place seller I bought from isn't selling an authentic version of this Bones box-set, or this is the crappiest release ever. It is identical to the 5 individual seasons I already owned; no matching cases for each season or anything. I wonder if I would have received a different product if I would have bought directly from amazon. If anyone has any insite regarding this matter, I would really appreciate it.
So, five stars for the show, but one star for this seasons 1-5 box set, assuming, of course that I got the legitimate product.",1304985600,17,1108,4.545
1550517,5,B00005JOXC,"I wasn't introduced to Bones until Season 3, but I watched earlier episodes sporadically as they appeared on Hulu.

And I wasn't disappointed; not only does the season one DVD set have all 22 episodes, but it also has several behind the scenes featurettes and commentary.

SPOILER ALERT

Season one is a very solid set up to the series. The serial killer Howard Epps is introduced, who's character extends into season two. The relationship between Booth and Bones is given a very strong foundation, while the occasional sexual tension only adds to the fun. Plus, Bones' estranged parents and orphaned childhood is explained (at least in part) in this season, which gives Bones a great deal of character development. The supporting cast is developed very fully, as well, with at least one revealing secret for Hodgins, Zack, Angela and Dr. Goodman that help the evolution of all of the characters.",1304812800,3,1014,4.8895348837209305
1550518,5,B00005JOXC,"I am of two schools of thought on this series... 1) Bones is a not so undercover Vulcan denying her emotions while exploring the human condition, 2.) She is a Replicant and as an android, only thinks she is denying those emotions ... Which ever you embrace determines your take on Booth's intent to either turn the Vulcan Doctor into a vampire or retire the Skin-job... Because sometimes Blade Runners retire Vulcans by mistake.. And tryin' to turn an android into a vamp would just be silly.

Seriously it's an awesome and quirky take on the whole morgue genre.",1303776000,,562,4.6767676767676765
1550519,5,B00005JOXC,"""Bones"" didn't take long to find it's voice. The pilot has a few rough edges and inconsistencies with the rest of the series, but not many. The pilot story is just plain solid, though. This season introduces a long-term villain, Howard Epps, and establishes the main characters beautifully. There are tearjerkers like ""The Man in the Fallout Shelter"" and some really funny moments like the introduction of Caroline and how Brennan ultimately deals with an evil voodoo practitioner in ""The Man in the Morgue."" You have to have this season if you're a serious ""Bones"" fan. It may not be their best season, but it's a good one, as they all are.",1302998400,3,641,4.732142857142857

1550523,1,B00005JOXC,"I had heard good thing about the show and I got season one as a gift. Talk about a let down. Brennan is a completely unlikable character. She's clueless to social etiquette and popular culture, and worst of all, completely dismissive of others' belief systems. That lack of respect really turned me off to the show.",1295395200,8,315,4.642857142857143
1550524,5,B00005JOXC,"This new series has a pilot and twenty-one more episodes, and to cover this series five years later you have to consider two things: the content of the episodes, or their subjects, and the characters and plot treatment.

The subjects are always limited in one episode and they are often dealing with immediate reality. There is thus no surprise to find one essential subject is the Iraq war in 2005. This subject comes back in several episodes and these show that the war itself was not very clean and they reveal one attitude only: anything unjust has to be redressed. It has to be redressed because the victims of this injustice have the right to know and because the author of the injustice is a plain criminal, murderer most of the time. This attitude is all the more emphasized and even dramatized because Agent Booth is a veteran of the Kosovo war and has seen, experienced and suffered some such episodes.

That's the second thing you have to keep in mind with this series: Agent Booth is an FBI agent but also a Kosovo survivor. He merges a very military dynamism, extremely precise work, a great sense of logic and deduction, total commitment to fairness and truth. This is also very important when they deal with the case of illegal immigration and more or less clandestine and illegal refugees from the Central American countries that have been ridden with civil wars most of the time supported on the wrong side by the US. On the wrong side, I will say because of what we know today, since today in most countries the left-leaning insurgency has politically recovered and electorally re-conquered power. In other words the US support and at times intervention was wasted and badly advised. And that has to do with Iraq where such an ill-advised intervention was going on at the time.

The second main character is Doctor Temperance Brennan. She works for the Jeffersonian Institute and she is a bone specialist in all fields where bones have to be scrutinized, analyzed and reconstructed as to what they may tell about what happened to the person they belonged to once.  She is assisted by three people. First an art-trained person is there to recreate places and bodies from the remains or the memory of witnesses thanks to highly specialized software. Then another doctor trained in physics, chemistry and biology who has an extremely high level of knowledge in his fields and can analyze any matter, stuff or whatever that can reveal the circumstances of the death of a ""patient"". Finally a young intern who is working on his doctorate thesis and is also extremely and sharply specialized and informed in the physiology of the body or the skeleton of any person. The boss of the Jeffersonian institute is a Black man who used to be an archaeologist but who remains discreet on scientific matters.

Yet the series avoids any kind of over-learned language that we wouldn't be able to understand. Nevertheless it uses a lot of the paraphernalia of software and computer assisted and aided visualization to make laboratory scenes palatable and even interesting.

The final great point of this series is the very careful study of the relations between these people, administrative, authority, personal, even intimate relations and problems, knowing there are two women and three men and they all have personal lives. But the series insist on the background of Agent Booth but also of Dr Brennan: her parents disappeared when she was a young teenager, her brother abandoned her when he was 19 and is on probation for some crime. At the end of this first series the body of the mother is found, her death is clarified, Dr Brennan gets to some kind of reconciliation with her brother and the father remains alive, talkative on the phone but absent physically, in fact escaping justice as he would deserve due to his criminal past.  That's where the plot sickens for the second season.

1550599,3,B00005JOXC,"Happily, I see the show at this point is in its sixth season, so that nothing I might say will have any impact on its success. In brief, I did find the technical stuff interesting but the remainder of each show is a rather tedious, abbreviated rehash, of every man-professional woman relationship since Tracy and Hepburn made a series of classics (and, no doubt, before that). I have no quarrel with rehash when well done but here I find it so compressed and stereotyped as to make it nothing more than an adjunct to the modern machine stuff and predictable to boot.
Overall, this first year would have discouraged me with it after several weeks were I watching it in real-time. Never having seen it on TV, perhaps I am mistreating an experience intended to be seen in 45 minute segments only once a week.
Oh, yes, the discs themselves, while looking and sounding OK (so far as I can tell since I used the subtitles), forced me to get out the most powerful magnifying glasses I have just to read which side I was on and what it contained.",1284854400,3,1038,4.468421052631579
1550600,5,B00005JOXC,Absolutely one of the best shows on TV. The play between Booth and Brennan is fun to watch. Her social awkwardness and his gut instinct work great together. Their fledgling partnership can be seen developing episode by episode into a greater friendship and they catch the bad guys while having fun. Their banter sets the tone and other cast members are icing on the cake. The quips between the characters lighten the mood where the bodies and heinous nature of the crimes being solved could drag the episodes into darkness. Add on the forensic verbal gymnastics and it is worth the price!,1282003200,3,588,4.7745098039215685

I've already ordered and watched two more seasons and can't wait to see the rest. The only problem I have (and why I gave the product 4 stars even though it deserves 5) is because the DVDs in this set were made double-sided, possibly to save money on the manufacturers part. However, I found that they got scratched very easily and episodes I hadn't even gotten a chance to watch yet were scratched when I got to them. It was disappointing, but since this first season/dvd set I haven't had the problem because the rest of the seasons are one-sided discs. it's a small, unfortunate problem for someone like me who wants to watch the episodes and can't because the DVDs will be scratched. I do wish they'd re-release the set and make them one-sided, but that's just wishful thinking...",1281744000,3,927,4.590361445783133
1550602,5,B00005JOXC,"Move over Martin and Lewis, Burns and Allen, and all other great comedy duos.  For now we have a forensic anthropologist and her FBI sidekick for the freshest most offbeat comedy duo I have ever seen on tv or film.  Bones and Booth are at one and the same time absolutely convincing as crime investigators and comic sidekicks.

All cases involve corpses reduced to bones.  This is what brings Dr. Temperance Brennan (Bones) into investigations as she is a forensic anthropologist.  She is not a pathologist.  A pathologist works on dead bodies where the skin still remains.  Her partner is an FBI agent, Booth, who connects with people better than the ""all science all the time"" Brennan.  Brennan regularly insults just about everyone as she tends to see them as anthropology constructs instead of as people.  He is positively touchy feely and the soul of sensitivity compared to her.  She recognizes virtually no popular icons and does not even own a tv set.

Next, there is an artist who works the cases too.  She reconstructs by computer and her art abilities the bones into visual three dimensional projections of what those bones would look like as a living person.  She can also recreate the crime in different scenarios of commision this way.  I find this absolutely fascinating and way better than anything being done on CSI.

There are also two other highly skilled lab people.  Hodgkins specializes in bugs and particles and is as oddball as someone who holds multiple doctorates in such a field would be.  Zach is Bones's grad assistant and intern,  who has even less social skills than she but who is equally gifted with corpses reduced to bones.  The supporting cast has been well selected and grows on you over time.

David Boreanaz, who play Booth, deserves special mention.  He is absolutely convincing as an FBI agent yet he can also turn into Jerry Lewis on a dime.  It is an amazing comedic balancing act which he achieves.

I've watched all the seasons and this show keeps getting better and better. Try it out.

Sorry, but when I watch something I don't like rooting through the menu every 40-45 minutes.

But the acting and characterization on the show is GREAT. I want to be friends with every character, which hardly ever happens. Usually a couple great characters make the show worth watching despite terrible secondary characters. But every character here brings something to the table.

Also, surprisingly funny for a show about rotting corpses!",1275609600,,552,4.989130434782608

The start of everything that is Booth and Brennan, Booth's problems with squints, and Brennan's lack of pop culture knowledge. It's all here.

Season 1 is a little different than the later seasons, at first it may be difficult to get used to a different boss.  Still, all the forensics is there, and i9t's interesting to see all that goes into their dynamic.  Re-watching the first season also makes me miss Zack, who was a great character.

Overall, the first season is definitely worth a watch, or a re-watch.  The set has double sided discs, which is not ideal, but sometimes that's the way life goes.",1275004800,3,743,4.548872180451128

1550705,5,B00005JOXC,I love this TV series.  I think Bones has much cleaner humor than what is out there these days.  It also has a good story line for all the characters and you find out more and more about each person from episode to episode.  It can definitely become addictive.  I think if you like investigative shows that are more light hearted and funny then Bones is an awesome pick.,1269907200,,370,4.318840579710145
1550706,4,B00005JOXC,"Most Pilots have problems with characters that are too broadly drawn, settings that are too generic, and and an overall ""cheap"" feeling.  Not so with Bones.  From the few episodes I've seen from the following seasons, I can tell the characters are still themselves as portrayed in this first episode.  The setting is strong, making you believe these people work and live in the portrayed world, from giving glimpses of their daily lives to showing an interesting and believable work environment.  The only time I was drawn out of the show through noticing a sense of staging was in one scene in a car, in which it was obvious that the background was a film.

I wanted to know more about these people and what they would do next.  I laughed out loud a few times, and was suitably drawn into the serious nature of the plot.  Even one-shot characters, those we will never see in any other episode, were well portrayed and interesting.  I wanted to know more about the ""stalker""; was he crazy, not good socially, a killer, a sweetheart of a guy, what?

1550795,5,B00005JOXC,"Emily Deschanel plays Dr. Temperance Brennan aka ""Bones,"" a forensic anthropologist working with the FBI courtesy of the ""Jeffersonian Institution"" in Washington DC. David Boreanaz (formerly of ANGEL) plays her foil, Special Agent Seeley Booth.

This series has matured since it debuted in 2005. At first just another also-ran in the CSI/NCIS/COLD CASE/FORENSIC FILES/etc. mold, BONES has developed a quirky, sassy, and comic edge all to itself. BONES is based on the real-life work of Dr. Kathy Reichs, who invented the character of Bones in her novels who in turn invents a character named Kathy Reichs in her novels. Get it?

Bones Brennan is brilliant and beautiful but hyperintellectual and painfully (sometimes laughably) lacking in social skills. In the first season she comes across as mechanical and almost too aloof, but the character does mature as the season progresses. Although she still suffers from Poindexter Syndrome even now, she's lovable and incredibly sexy; if women with quadruple digit IQs turn you on this is your show. It's mine.

Booth is funny and good looking and charming. Boreanaz was the original drawing card for BONES, and he acquits the role well. He names Brennan Bones out of annoyance, but soon grows fond of her (and as of 2010, love blossoms).

Season one is a bit stiff, but it's entertaining. It's also a necessary baseline to develop a real attachment to the show and its very original characters.",1260403200,2,1440,5.088983050847458
1550796,5,B00005JOXC,I have read all of Kathy Reichs books ... so I loved Temperance Brennan long before there was a series ... and what a series --- absolutely terrific!  David & Emily and the whole cast are amazing; hope the series continues on for years!!!  (I am just buying the first season again -- because I share my DVD's and somehow one of the discs from season 1 got lost -- so I reordered to have a complete set.)  I will continue to collect as the seasons continue!,1259712000,,456,4.218390804597701
1550797,5,B00005JOXC,"One night while making dinner, I turned on the TV and it was the first time I saw part of an episode of Bones. The subject matter was intelligent, the observations of such depth and the plot to captivating that I was hooked.

For a birthday gift, I decided to buy Season 1 for Alex Ariano and now we can't have enough of Bones, watching an episode per night so we may be acquiring the entire collection.

Bones is based on the science of forensics with episodes that cover crimes committed where the evidence, for the most part bones, is the remains of people so disfigured or decomposed that only a group of experts could unravel the mysterious deaths.

Combine a forensic anthropologist, an FBI agent, and the Smithsonian Institute experts assigned to each case and the possibilities are endless. The main characters are FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth, masterfully played by David Boreanaz and Dr. Temperance Brennan, AKA Bones, played by Emily Deschanel with such appeal that we simply love her intellectual brilliance. Emily Deschanel provides a character that is honest, direct, lacking in social skills but providing direct statements with such a straight face that it is actually humorous.

The episodes are based on Dr. Brennan being called to crime scenes where she examines human remains of murdered victims to solve the case. While FBI Special Agent Booth is very good in his role, he is devoid of forensic or scientific knowledge and it is that special bond that is formed between a good detective and an amazing scientist that hooks you from the start.

As the episodes unfold, we become involved in the lives and relationships of the characters, finding that after a few episodes are complete, we are part of the family of Bones.

Michaela Conlin playing the role of Angela Pearly Gates Montenegro, is a forensic artist that has invented a three dimensional reconstruction program that generates holograms that provide the team with a vision of the victim's features. Razor sharp technology!

Erick Millegan plays the role of Zachary Uriah Addy, a graduate student who assists Dr. Brennan as he awaits his doctorate in Forensic Anthropology. Of all the characters, Zach is one of our favorites because he demonstrates extreme intelligence, an IQ of over 160, a genius, and yet, adorable in his inability to decipher the most basic of human emotions.

T. J. Thyne plays the role of wealthy Jack Stanley Hodgins, an entomologist who reads spores, minerals, and bugs. He balances Zach and challenges FBI Special Agent Booth with his conspiracy theories.

The special features provided with Season 1 revealed that the show is based on the real life of forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs. The episodes are based on the written crime novel series written by her. The soundtrack album titled Bones Original TV Soundtrack was produced by Maria Alonte McCoy and Billy Gottlieb.",1257897600,,2884,4.979209979209979

They see the boy in each other and themselves.",1255478400,,283,3.8135593220338984
1550859,5,B00005JOXC,"Be warned, this is not just another crime show.  This is not a procedural drama, more of a character drama that adds humor and a twist to the ""who-did-it question.""  Special Agent Booth (David Boreaneaz from Angel) and Dr. Brennen (Glory Road, Cold Mountain) have a wonderful working relationship matching his street smarts and her book smarts to make a formidable team in solving crimes.  She uses her ""squint sqaud"" - a group of genius scientists and an artist - to figure out who the victim is, how and when they died, and give Booth and the FBI the means to figure out who the killer is and why they killed.  And just when you think you have figured out who the killer is, surprise!, it's someone else.  The comedy exists in Brennen's (Bones) lack of pop culture references and Booth's constant attempts to teach her.

If you're looking for a crime drama that adds a touch of humor, keeps you guessing as to who the real killer is and has strong character development, look no further than BONES.  I do highly recommend that you watch these shows in order the first time you watch them.  References in season 2 shows depend on you seeing season one episodes.  I highly recommend BONES.",1254441600,2,1189,4.570754716981132

It is not as good a show as House is but does have interesting well made episodes.  I will watch the second season and see how the show goes on from there.  I enjoy the mystery and the cases but am put off by the business-like atmosphere of the show and what I see as its impersonal-ness.

2) No ""Play All"" feature, one of the reasons people buy TV show DVD's such as this is No Commercial breaks and being able to watch multiple episodes back to back in one sitting, so in this instance I have to > go to main menu, then click play on the next episode.

The characters are lively and outrageous, and when put together create some very interesting moments. The only thing I'd criticize are the inconsistencies. One minute Bones is too literal to understand a joke, but later one she makes one herself. Zack is even more literal, but occassionally we hear him say things like ""Be Kind, Rewind"". There are a lot of great episodes with tons of character development in this season, namely the Christmas episode - ""The Man in the Fallout Shelter"", and ""Two Bodies in the Lab"". The special features are great as well, especially David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel's commentary over the ""Two Bodies in the Lab"" episode.

1550914,5,B00005JOXC,"I have first hand experience in the field of forensics. So the program Bones is more than entertainment for me. It's possible that media helps us to process our lives, especially when there's no one to talk with. In real life, most people would rather not hear about things related to forensics, hospitals, police matters, etc. Yet these same people may benefit from such services. It's hard, demanding work in many ways. It's also understandable to want to avoid these matters unless necessary. Bones puts a human, humane slant on forensics. The spirit of Dr. Reich's work as forensic anthropologist lives strongly in this program. Technological advances have streamlined the work over the years in ways not previously imagined. This is amply portrayed, along with the notion of using technology in productive, creative ways. My work doesn't allow me to change the tv channel in my mind, or turn off the inner broadcast. However, watching Bones injects some humor into the picture. I often encounter people like those portrayed here - focused geniuses who are socially clumsy. The human chemistry portrayed is as interesting and grounded as the scientific chemistry. In the test tube of life, I'd say this program contains all the ingredients for a desired result. That is, if the desire is for intelligent, informative, human and humorous viewing. The viewer also seems invited to see how things continue to evolve. Bones offers a unique view into an interesting aspect of life and work.",1233100800,,1489,5.056910569105691

Season 1 establishes the working relationship between Seeley Booth and Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan. He is an FBI agent and she is a forensic anthropologist working for the Jeffersonian. Their partnership is not only unique, it is ... show would Booth put it?... Symbiotic. These two complement each other perfectly, each learning from the other and learning through their interactions. Booth is the jock, charming, intuitive guy and Bones is the rational, assertive, and yet, socially awkward brilliant scientist.

1550986,4,B00005JOXC,"While stretching their (um) phalanges in reach of a hit, these writers, and actors, have grasped gold.
The formula is simple, with trait opposites to create banter, and chemistry to bond, the main characters of Dr.""Bones"" Brennan and FBI Special agent Booth embody a partnership that sparkles . . . and sizzles.
Though it takes a couple episodes to get away from boxes of ""macho/angry"" and ""analytical/unfeeling"" the duo soon settle into shades of grey we can relate to.
The stories/cases they solve are at times a little too fantastical, but it's t.v. so we let them have their fun. Though I'll admit that some of the stories echoed in my brain weeks after.
Most interesting to me is that as these cases move along, the shades of color, not just grey, of these characters emerge, and in the moments of their (extraodinary) lives we see a dynamic unfold that makes it impossible to look away.
Superhero in the alley, was my favorite for story, Woman in the Car for tear enducement, and Man in the Morgue has the greatest premise: Bones wakes up injured and bleeding in her hotel room in New Orleans having lost an entire day. Don't worry, Booth will be by her side to join in the pursuit for the truth. Because that's what they do.

1551047,5,B00005JOXC,"I've been an avid fan of David Boreanaz ever since he stepped scene on Buffy: The Vampire Slayer.

I was roughly 16 and was happy to see his career blossom onto Angel for 5 seasons.

When Angel was unfortunately axed, rumor began shortly after that he was going to be on a show on Fox about forensics.

CSI was pretty popular at the time and I thought ""Not another knockoff"". I tried watching it for pure support of him but found I could not get into the show.

A couple years later, I watched the first few disc of Season 1 and found myself completely engrossed in the characters.

I love the way the show has grown in the 3 years it's been on (going into 4 this fall) as well as the way the stories have gotten more complex yet humorous.

When you follow an actor or character, you always hope to see something familiar yet something new.

1551102,5,B00005JOXC,"I don't get to watch TV shows that often, so had never seen or even heard anything about this show. Then while walking through Blockbuster last sping (2006), I saw the first seasons DVD there, and thought I would check it out. It did not take long till I was totally hooked. I have seen bits and pieces of the many CSI type shows out there, and some of the real life educational programs, but they were never enough to keep me coming back.

In my free time at work, I eventually watched through the entire first season. This show was VERY witty, very funny, yet very intelligent and educational in the way they connected the dots and solved crimes. Of course, having such an attractive star doesn't hurt AT ALL!

Shortly after finishing eason one, the season two discs came out (perfect timing). Around the same time I decided to start setting my DVR box to record the new season episodes, and at this time got my wife to sit down long enough to watch an episode with me. After one episode, she too was hooked, so we started watching the season two discs together.

Now, once the younger kids are down for the night, my wife and I brew up a pot of something hot (coffee or dandelion brew), and along with our 16 year old son, sit for a most entertaining and captivating episode either on DVD or DVR of a recorded episode. Now, with the writers strike haulting season 3 episode, my family gets to enjoy reruns from seasons 1 & 2 also.

The characters all have their own witty, intelligent and qirky characteristics, and it is so entertaining to watch them interact off each other. Of course the highligh of every episode (for us) centers around the back and forth dialog between the two main characters usually in the car driving to a crime scene most every episode (season 3 has changed the pace some by putting that highlight in their sesions with the therapist...my gosh, hilarious to say the least).

I am just impressed that there can be such highly educational forensics happening amidst this motley crew of squints that merge and clash to cuse such humor.

Great series...heck it out for sure.",1201478400,,2099,4.525065963060686
1551103,5,B00005JOXC,"Since ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"" debuted in October 2000, forensic shows have flooded the airwaves, each with a slightly different take on the idea of scientists solving crimes. So what makes ""Bones"" one of television's most under-rated dramas?

Like most forensics shows, ""Bones"" operates on the premise that science can be used to solve crimes. Forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel) is world-renowned for her work at identifying victims through their skeletal remains, and she is one of the Jeffersonian (Smithsonian)'s best scientists. Brennan, however, is not good with the living, and despite her intelligence and success as a mystery novelist, she struggles to connect with people. After working in collaboration with the FBI on a few cases, she is assigned to work with Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz), a former Army sniper who is convinced that cops - not scientists - solve crimes. Booth is as smooth as he is smart, and his ability to connect with people aids him in solving crimes.

It's no surprise that Booth and Brennan (whom he has sarcastically nicknamed ""Bones"" - hence the show's title) clash over just about everything, from religion to families to who is going to drive to the crime scenes. Despite their near-constant bickering, the duo manage to complement each other, and with Brennan's colleagues, the lovable ""squints"", they are succesful at their work.

Along with Boreanaz and Deschanel, the series features several unforgettable characters, including conspiracy buff bug-and-slime guy Jack Hodgins (TJ Thyne), whimsy yet grounded forensic artist Angela Montenegro (Michaela Conlin), and Brennan's grad student, super-logical genius Zack Addy (Eric Millegan). However, it is the two series leads that allow the show to sparkle.

So what makes ""Bones"" different from all the other forensics shows on television? It could be the witty banter between the characters, or the portrayal of Booth as the ""straight man"" in the world of scientists. It might even be the crimes that the show features. But most of all, it's the humor on the series. For once, this is a forensic drama that doesn't take itself too seriously. Under-rated, indeed.",1200873600,,2202,5.300859598853868
1551104,5,B00005JOXC,"I just recently got into watching this TV series. Thus, I started from season 3, and Season 1 is just as funny and interesting. The dialog between Booth and the squints is hilarious. The bonus material isn't much though.",1200528000,,220,4.666666666666667

If you've just started watching, this gives you the opportunity to understand the characters and why they are the way they are.

I was not too enthusiastic about Season One but went ahead and bought Season Two anyway. I had a hard time finishing each episode. There are some mystery/detective series that keep you hooked. You cannot tear yourself away from the TV till you have reached the end of the episode, and if you have a collection, you want to put on the next episode. This is not the case with Bones. You find reasons to press the pause button.",1195084800,6,705,4.1911764705882355
1551182,2,B00005JOXC,"In the interest of full disclosure, let me start by saying 3 things:

1.  I really wanted to like this show.  I think David Boreanaz is hot, and I never got to watch him in Buffy, because I don't like that genre

2.  I am not a fan of CSI-type shows.  But I did watch CSI first season and thought it was excellent.

3.  I have watched 6 episodes so far hoping for a turnaround, but think I will just abandon.

Some people have called Bones a sexed-up CSI.  I think a better description is a dumbed-down CSI.  I do not understand the almost 5-star rating for this show.  Here are the problems I see:

1.  Bad acting by Boreanaz.  I hope he was much better in Buffy.

2.  Cardboard characters such as Zach.

3.  Bad writing. You want to shoot the writers with some of those lines.

4.  Predictable endings.  You can guess who is the murderer 90% of the time.

5.  Repetitive plot cues.  Dr. Brennan always figures out a case by a ""eureka"" moment, after someone says something not related to the case.

6.  Oversimplification of characters:  Dr. Brennan is so asocial she doesn't even get pop cultural references thrown at her by Booth.

7.  Everyone talks about sexual chemistry between the 2.  Please....

8.  When they are driving in the car, the outside looks fake.  In ""The Man in the Bear"" episode...the mountains looked pasted in the town's background.  All the corpses look fake too.

Well, I could go on and on.  I really want to stop watching and then because of the rave reviews, I hesitate. I wonder if the show gets better.  Alias' first 5 episodes are horrible, and then it becomes really good.

The problem is that not once, have I felt the urgency to stay up and watch the next show.  This urgency is a sure indicator of how good a tv series is.  The advantage of buying a DVD set is that you don't have to wait one whole week to catch the next episode.  Perhaps in this show's case....waiting a whole week might actually be a good thing.  Long enough to make you forget the bad stuff, short enough to incite you to give it a second chance.

1551205,5,B00005JOXC,"This has got to be one of my all time favorite comedy/drama shows ever!  It is my favorite for the last two seasons of all shows.  The chemistry between Seely Booth and Temperance (Bones) Brennen is so thick you can cut it with a knife.  The plots and storylines are fantastic.  As this is based on an actual person who is a forensic anthropologist it is interesting, educational, humorous and above all an absolutely great show to watch!  The interaction of the entire cast is like one big family that cares for each other as well as the bones they try to solve cases of.
If you have never watched this show, it gets better and better with each episode.  Try it, you'll like it!!!!

1551207,5,B00005JOXC,"A very good crime drama somewhat in the vein of CSI. The interplay between the main characters is what drives this show. David Boreanez is light years from the brooding (but still wonderful) character Angel he played for many years, and he really shines with the serious/smarmy FBI detective Booth role. Emily Deschanel is very believable as the brainy forensic anthropologist ""Bones"" Brennan. The rest of the cast is also excellent and provide great interaction. The dialogue can get a little difficult to understand, but the show still manages to pull off each episode pretty well. All in all, Bones is a very entertaining drama and well worth watching.",1186358400,2,655,5.018348623853211

The DVD itself is worth picking up. Amongst the extras are 2 episodes with commentaries: one done by the series creator & a producer which was very informative. Includes bits on how the actors were cast. The other done by David & Emily which I had a few laughs listening to. Quality of pic and sound are also excellent.",1181952000,3,574,4.917525773195877

I would say the show is comfortable.  It doesn't have the highs of the X-Files nor the chemistry of those leads, but again it is just good enough to make it a pleasurable to watch.

I didn't grab on to the show right away since it seemed like another CSI clone.  It did find its way though and the banter and relationships between all the regulars is much improved.

1551211,3,B00005JOXC,"I picked up season one of Bones from my local Blockbuster due to friends recommendations and being a fan of David Boreanaz's from his years of playing Angel on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I have to say that this series takes some time getting used to. Not that it's complicated or boring - but it's just....blah at first. Blah is different from boring. How? No clue. Haha. It just took me some time to get into the characters and the story itself.

I liked Agent Booth from the start probably due to being a fan of David's(also the fact that he's disgustingly hot helps too). But Dr. Brennan (the other lead)? She annoyed me to no end at first. She's somewhat cold and unfeeling (you later learn why). The constant comparisons between how she and Booth differ in mindsets does become a bit jarring and ""please shut up! We get it already people!"" How in the world does Angela, who is supposedly just an artist, suddenly know everything about the human body and can come up with all these things on her nifty image machine deal? Umm. Yeah. Also the first batch of episodes just seemed to have the same plot over and over again.

As the season wore on...I started to become a very big fan of this show. The episodes became better written and the storylines became more interesting. The writers started to delve into the characters backgrounds, which helped the general storyline and the viewer's ability to understand why a certain character is cold or etc. Also the chemistry between the two leads - Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan - is great stuff. Eric Millegan, who plays young genius Zach Addy, is surprisingly great and funny in his role. Still, I sometimes cringe at some of the lines, especially those said by Dr. Hodgins. But...the season did end on a very interesting note, and I can't wait to jump into season two.",1180051200,8,1816,4.584615384615384

1551263,5,B00005JOXC,"I freely admit to giving this show a shot only because I loved ANGEL.  Before watching BONES, I had no expectations other than a mild anxiety that I wouldn't be able to accept David Boreanaz in a new role.  However, I surprisingly found that all the ingredients that make me sit up and pay attention were there:

1.  An intelligent female lead (Bones).  While she's also pretty and funny, she has endearing flaws.  Her superwoman-esque martial arts and marksmanship abilities (she can apparently shoot better than her FBI counterpart who used to be a sniper) are blatantly over the top.  However, I have no compunction ""giving"" that to the writers since it opens the door to occasional action sequences.  Also, it helps (a little) to fill in the gaps left by ALIAS and BUFFY.

2.  Science and technology are portrayed pretty realistically (for tv) and are heavily showcased in the show.  In my book, any show that says science is sexy = super hot!

3.  The interaction between scientists and noscientists (Squids and FBI agents) seems pretty realistic and fun.  Their strengths pull them in opposite directions and the clash of different philosophies and approaches to a problem are handled like a well-choreographed dance - fantastic.

4.  FBI role is a perfect fit for Boreanaz.  Joss Whedon (and others) have noted that David Boreanaz sparkled when the Angel character was ""petty.""  [Season 5 of Angel succeeded (in part) because of the hilariously antagonistic relationship between Angel and Spike.]  In BONES, Boreanaz now has free reign to comedy - pettiness and hilarity abound.  Emily Deschanel (Bones) plays opposite him as everything guileless and straght-edge - I can't say enough about how perfect this chemistry is.  (This type of overblown comedic writing is exactly what draws me to romance novels.  Refreshing it is to (finally) see this on tv!  As everybody will notice right away, this follows in the footsteps of the tension between the two leads of X-FILES.  Great!)

5.  The Squints are SO well done.  As a scientist with a similarly abnormal IQ to the Squints on the show, I have to say that this is one of the few shows to realistically capture the personalities of scientists.  (Ok, yeah, you don't often hear scientists ""name-dropping"" their credentials or their IQs like I just did, but, on the show, it's a necessary evil of tv exposition.)  The writers of the show might have just as easily observed my lab and jotted down our (stilted) interactions to write into the show.  The little character elements that tend to drive scientists (like how they'd rather be ""right"" than ""well-liked"" not just because they like to be right but also because they need to make sure that ""right"" has a voice) are all there.  Not only do their personalitites and quirkiness actually make sense, but we are SHOWN how smart they are, not just TOLD (though we are told often).  Importantly, each Squint contributes interesting ideas and breakthroughs to the team - the other scientists aren't just there to show us how smart Bones is by contrast (a problem I have with HOUSE).  For me, a phenomenal comedic show - A+",1178150400,6,3124,4.856060606060606

The two leads are terrific and have great chemistry--the dialogue is surprisingly good and well timed.  But the secondary characters are fantastic...well drawn and acted....and everyone has their own personality.  It's really a fun show.  It may appeal a bit to the hidden science geek in me, too.

The episodes are good. Although (of course) the name of the show is ""BONES"" (Emily Deschanel's character), I think the supporting cast of Zak, Angelam, Jack and Dr. Brennan should have more screen time and plots written around them.

Each episode is full of humor, drama, great group chemistry and realistic crime scenes.  I love the interaction between the two main characters, with all their flaws and merits.

While I wish there was more commentary the other extras more than make up for it.

The writing is not bad. the actors, while improving a lot over the whole series are however somewhat problematic. Indeed they are somewhat too polsihed in a visual sense and do not give off a real ""live"" feeling so to say. They come off somewhat too youthful; maybe this was intentional in order to provide a ""geeky"" feel to the crew but it is in my opinion somehwt counterproductive given the sometimes gory content. Fortunately the gore aspect is somewhat downplayed towards the end of the series and the charactes become more realistic at the same time. Also, it is difficult to forget that Boreanaz played Angel in the Buffy series where he was really perfect and the association of his face with that series renders his credibility also somewhat less. Anyway I still liked it a lot: the plots are interesting and the episodes never boring.

The characters, while taking a few episodes to find themselves, are infinitely more three dimensional and lovable. This show offers humor and intellect as well as refreshing plot lines that further enhance character relationships and leave you guessing until the last moment. The chemistry between Boreanaz and Deschanel is amazing, and the lab trio offers comic relief as well as intelligence. While I was skeptical of Boreanaz playing a character with a similar mission statement as his previous television hero, Angel (repent for all the killing he has done by saving lives of as many people), Booth is a far cry from the dark and moody vampire. He also makes for the perfect counterpart to his partner, Dr. Brennan (Deschanel), whose intelligence and dedication to her work tends to make her come off as aloof and cold. Booth and Dr. Brennan's earthy artist friend, Angela, help Dr. Brennan (affectionately nicknamed ""Bones"" by Booth) connect to people throughout the series, although both are somewhat stymied at her utter lack of pop culture knowledge. Overall, Season One of Bones is a witty, fun, intellectual alternative to reality television, and is an excellent springboard for future seasons of this show.",1173484800,7,1425,5.094017094017094

1551372,5,B00005JOXC,"I have nothing but praise for this show. Although it may sound like another variation of CSI, Bones only shares the same genre and that's about it. In Bones, the police procedural side of things disappears in favour of the lab work, and the mysteries are usually more fascinating than the ""Who-killed-this-guy?"" approach we usually see. (How often does a CSI plot involve underground catacombs, a serial killer who uses tumours to kill his victims, or a search for lost treasure? Just to name a few). Bones is a fun yet cerebral, often dark and often moving series, full of clever and engaging plots, and a cast of very appealing characters.

The two leads are a definite source of the show's strength. Emily Deschanel as ""Bones"" has got to be the least stereotypical television heroine in years. She's all brains, totally analytical and professional, making her at once both brilliant and isolated. Bones' lack of social skills, non-existent knowledge of popular culture, and her extremely literal way of taking things makes her seem adorably naive. It is as though she's an alien transplanted to Earth who can't quite adjust to the unusual Earth people surrounding her. At first, Bones comes across as abrupt, insensitive and something of a spoilt brat (like many a professor I've known). However, as the series progresses it becomes clear that Bones' ultra-rational approach to the world is a well developed defense for a vulnerable person who, abandoned at a tender age, has had to raise herself through the hardest growing up years alone, with only her intellect to rely on.

Agent Booth (David Boreanz) on the other hand, provides the human face of the team. Booth serves a number of important roles in Bones' world, aside from that of rugged hero type. With the possible exception of Angela (Bones' best friend), Booth is about the only member of the team whose feet are firmly set in reality. Although he may be lacking in the intellectual sophistry of the rest of the team, more often than not Booth is the one who pulls all the pieces of the puzzle together to solve the mystery. There is a distinct impression, particularly in the earlier episodes, that Booth also serves as the diplomatic liaison between Bones and the people in the outside world she tends to rub the wrong way. Despite being an outsider, Booth seems to have more control over Bones' team than she does, and seems to be the one person who can keep the ""squints"" as he calls them on task. Most importantly, Booth fills in the role of the overprotective big brother that Bones seems to have needed all along. (In fact, in one rather touching episode, Booth winds up rescuing Bones twice PLUS interrogates her latest date to make sure he's up to scratch).

Although the series has its cliches - the hero with the dark past, the will-they-won't-they subplot - it only casually touches on them, then subverts them. Booth is a war hero who is haunted by the things he has done, but contrary to the standard cliche, he is still proud of his millitary background, fiercely devoted to his country, and seems to be better adjusted than everyone around him. Bones is an orphan, but contrary to cliche, she seems to enjoy being her own person and isn't searching for a substitute family. Bones and Booth are constantly being stuck in will-they-won't-they situations, but the scripts make it so obvious that he sees her as a bratty little sister that there is no way the cliche can be realised without a lot of Freudian implications. Even the casting of Deschanel is, in itself, quite contrary to cliche. With slightly unusual facial structure, a nublike nose and ears that stick out like wings, plus a slight gawkiness that is quite charming, she is about as far from the typical female lead look you can get. Maybe that's what makes her so convincing as a Professor at the Jeffersonian (certainly a more convincing casting than Jessica Alba or Sharon Stone). Her appearance is definitely striking, but again, more for her alien-ness than as a movie star. In short, she's perfect for the role and not just a piece of eye candy.

Bones is well worth viewing. If you want an entertaining and fun story, with well-crafted characters, that actually steps outside the bounds of typical cliches, this is it. Let's hope it gets the kudos it deserves.",1173225600,5,4310,4.781208053691275
1551373,5,B00005JOXC,"At last it is on DVD, one of the best series to come out of the US since CSI.

You can't help but like the characters in Bones, the brittle but brilliant Dr Temperance Brennan, the handsome yet intelligent FBI agent Seely Booth and of course Dr Brennan's side-kicks, Zak, Hodgins and Angela, all experts in their fields but not as quirky as Dr Brennan often called Bones by Booth who obviously has a crush on her and he on him.

The series is all about bodies that have to be identified by their remains, sometimes there is a whole body stripped of flesh, other times just fragments of clothe and flesh, and each episode is pretty much a stand alone so you can watch it either from the beginning of the series or come into it later and still have a good idea as to what is going on.

There is a common thread though through much of the series which surrounds the sinister disappearance of Bones parents when she was a child, a disappearance that has made Bones who and what she is today, a loner who is often unable to understand basic human emotions because hers are kept under check and hidden away from the world.

Funny, dark, and gruesome, there are some good special effects, lots of bodies that make you go ""YEECH"" and some good acting all around from major to minor characters.",1173052800,3,1285,4.38655462184874

The characters make this show. The cases are good as well, but the chemistry between all the characters is what this show is all about. I actually enjoy it more than CSI, mainly because it isn't so darn serious all the time. David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel are the new Mulder and Scully. They just play off each other so well.

I also love that the writers add a bit of humor into an already stellar drama.  David Boreanez and Emily Deschanel have great chemistry as well, and the supporting actors are great in their respective roles.  I can't wait to see what else is revealed in this first season, as well as in what I hope will be many more to come.

1551488,3,B00005JOXC,"I've loved David Boreanaz ever since..well, you know when!

He's back to a supporting role in this series as Special Agent Seely Booth--a former army sniper now working for the FBI. A single parent to young Parker, Booth is very much a human in this role and does show a comedic light-hearted wit, but Boreanaz again gets to play somebody who must atone for killing others in his past (the whole sniper former-career).

This time, the supernatural and odd stuff gets handled by his partner, Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel) a character who is closely based on real life series creator Kathy Reich's experiences solving cases as a forensic anthropologist. Yes, Brennnan is good looking and she and Boreanaz make a good couple together, but her character's obvious lack of people skills is a recurrent story arc and it speaks of Reich's own talent if the character who is supposed to be based on her own experiences constantly gets tagged with such an obviously unflattering trait. Somebody else with a monster ego would have instead gone around wanting it to be 'her show'and that particular character to be especially perfect.

Twenty-two episodes are included in this 2005-2006 first season. My favorite one has to be ""The solider in the grave"" just because it could be ripped from current headlines about the war in Iraq. I'm also partial to ""Superhero in the alley"" because despite having a crowd of friends at my high school, we were the unpopular bunch who did not fit in with the status quo. Imagining this

The ""Man in the Morgue"" is another episode which effectively touches upon current/real life events. The whole 'vodoo in New Orleans' link could seem a little contrived to some people, but having TV characters go down to an area which is still very much in the news to investigate always has been a favorite plot device of mine.

Yes, I admit, I like to watch 'action/adventure/drama' shows. However, this one is so much more addictive since it intentionally injects a little bit of humor into it's periodically 'gross' storylines. I even detected a little bit of the formula from season one of 'Lois and Clark' (where two people who were not sure if they liked each other had to work together). Boreanaz can do romantic comedy!

The only thing which really annoys me about 'Bones' is that the characters constantly mention they work at the 'Jeffersonian' when no such building exists for the FBI.  If the series has permission to use exterior shots of the building and it's actually named after J. Edgar Hoover, just be honest and admit that it was named after him. Its not like Hollywood would be promoting the guy through the correct building name dropping.

Specific to the DVD's though, I wish that I had read the 'song replacement' comments before getting a hold of this set because the music was altered. DVD sets tend to be expensive enough as it is already despite this technology having been out on the market for a long time now. Yes, I know companies and artists are trying to make as much money as they possibly can, but a DVD set with unaltered vs. altered music is like the differences between cheddar cheese and imitation cheese product--which would they honestly want to buy let alone eat?

Finally, there are featurettes, commentaries from Boreanaz and Deschanel, and character profiles. But, why oh, why are companies continuing to do double sided discs--the people who purchase season sets are the hard-core fans who play episodes over and over again. Even the most careful handling of a two sided disc wears out quicker than if it were only one-sided.",1170892800,3,3589,4.822764227642277

The season is very nice to have for I do not have to wait an entire week to see the next episode. And I may also rewind or skip to a scene that I enjoy. Such as in ""Body In The Morgue"" one of my favorite scenes is the one where Jack comes up to Zack with the x-ray explaining that he can see particles, but there is no way to find out what they are. To which Zack say they are probably dirt, to which an admonishing Jack says he needs to ""feign interest in someone else"". Zack gives Jack an example which only succeeds in agravating Jack more. The scene ends with him telling Zack to forget it and then Jack prtends to wring Zack's neck. I can watch that very part as many times now which is quite nice.

The character can be a little irritating, but that's exactly how it's suppose to be. Can hardly wait to see when the two of them hook up.

Our daughter does not have Cable so we have been taping the episodes this year for her to see. Her husband and boys have also gotten the ""bug"" for the series.  Of course we had to check out the DVDs for quality inspection and enjoyed the first year all over again.  We think the DVD set and the books are first rate stories and the TV series well acted and with a cast of characters who really work well together.  Although there are a lot of yucky, skeletal and sometimes gooey scenes (not fit for young children) the humor is priceless.

It is wonderful to see the fantastic David Boreanaz, doing something other than wearing stupid vampire make-up, or deathly (in-effectual) masks! He deserved better and I hope this wonderful show goes on forever (or as long as it can). The characters of Seely Booth and Teperance Brennan, played by Emily Deschanel, play off one another, it such a way, that it goes beyond sexual tension (which has always been over-rated) to an intelligence level, of real friendship.

What I really wanted to do was give the packaging ONE star.  If I had paid the full price of $50.00 and not gotten it on sale for half that here at Amazon, I would be extremely upset.  The discs come in cheap slim cases -- 2 discs to a case.  There isn't a single printed image on the discs and you practically have to get out a magnifying glass to read the very small print around the inner hole to see which disc you are looking at.  It came without a insert that would talk about the episodes and instead it's all in small print on the back of each jewel case.

There's nothing to this set.  Good thing the show stands on it's own.  If you DVR'd the season I say don't bother buying the set, put the info on your computer and watch the eps through it.  At least that way you would get all the original music...

I think that as a procedural show, ""Bones"" is superior. The cutting-edge technology and unusual approaches make even the nitty gritty of the cases engaging. Especially interesting is the juxtaposition of the scientific methods employed by the ""squints"" and the psychological and intuitive methods used by FBI Agent Booth.

The best part of the show is the relationship between Dr. Brennan and Agent Booth. The Season 1 set provides the captivating opportunity to watch them banter back and forth through every episode and ultimately establish a relationship that is closer than either of them ever thought it would be.

In Agent Booth, it's nice to see an unapologetically masculine character who is a Christian, loves his son, and believes in the work he does. Boreanaz plays this for real-not at all tongue-in-cheek. Emily Deschanel also does well with Dr. Brennan's technical dialogue and lack of knowledge about popular culture. The other characters are also cleverly written and acted.

""Bones"" keeps getting better, but this set is a fine beginning.",1167782400,6,1255,5.019230769230769

Then in the bear episode the beginning song was replaced.  I was disappointed since I have watched all the episodes many times from TV.  I guess the rights to the songs were pretty steep for them not to be included.  There could have been a warning that songs had been replaced to let buyers know.  I would probably still bought this set for the extras anyway but I probably will not watch the shows with the replaced songs.

While I enjoyed Boreanaz in it as I knew I would I fell in love with Emily Deschanel's character. She plays one of the most interesting people on television today.

The banter that goes on between these two main characters is a joy to watch. I'll even say that the two of them may have the best chemistry on tv. Boreanaz plays tough as nails but nice guy in the inside  Agent Seely Booth, and Deschanel plays Dr Temperance Brennan a forensic anthropologist. Booth who works for the FBI investigates the murders that occur and Brennan determines the cause of death and uncovers clues based on the bones.

Each episode plays as a stand alone but the character dynamics build throughout the season and really is a joy to watch. As I said I'm not a huge fan of crime dramas but if for nothing else I deeply enjoyed the cast of this excellent show. And also loved the crime aspect as it is done differently than other crime solving shows.

1551578,4,B00005JOXC,"CSI and its various offspring continue to garner strong ratings on television as people are fascinated with how the authorities use state-of-the-art technology to solve crimes. The latest incarnation is Bones, a T.V. show that takes the CSI template and attempts to inject some humanity and characters that we actually care about. While the actual cases obviously take up most of an episode's running time, the personal details about the characters' lives are gradually revealed. The show took a few episodes to find its rhythm and fortunately its ratings were strong enough to allow it to get better.

After the untimely demise of Angel, it is nice to see David Boreanaz in another successful show. While the writing isn't as strong, his natural charm is a large part of the appeal of his character. Also, his backstory - an army ranger sniper - hints at a slightly dark past. It also helps that he has excellent chemistry with co-star Emily Deschanel whose character also has an intriguing past - her parents disappeared when she was 15 years old. Deschanel is an excellent foil as she plays someone who is more comfortable in her lab surrounded by the remains of dead people than in a noisy nightclub filled with people. She clearly lacks the necessary people skills. However, Bones is hardly a helpless bookworm as she has plenty of strong opinions and is not afraid to voice them. She is also capable of defending herself physically as well.

An easy comparison for Bones would be a combination of the partner dynamics of The X-Files with the formula of CSI. Where The X-Files dealt with supernatural crime, Bones deals with more natural crimes but the Mulder/Scully dynamic is certainly present in the relationship between Bones and Booth. What makes Bones work is not really the various cases but the characters and how we grow to care about what happens to them.

The first disc features a commentary on the ""Pilot"" episode by executive producer Barry Josephson and creator/writer Hart Hanson. They touch upon the test screening process and how this resulted in a few changes to this episode.

Disc three includes a commentary on ""Two Bodies in the Lab"" by actors David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel. They joke with each other in this relaxed track. The two actors make fun of the sexual tension between their characters. But what is evident from this track is the genuine chemistry between them and one can see how this translates to what we see on screen.

The fourth disc features several featurettes including ""Bones - Inspired by the Life of Forensic Anthropologist and Author Kathy Reichs"" a profile of the woman whom the character of Bones is based on.

""Character Profiles"" are text biographies on each of the main characters.

""Squints"" takes a look Bones' team of scientists. It's an actual term that is used and the cast members talk about the dynamics between their respective characters. They talk about how fascinating the technology aspect is.

Finally, there is ""The Real Definition,"" that examines some of the overtly technical terms from the show and defines them in plain English.",1165536000,12,3106,4.91412213740458

1551580,4,B00005JOXC,"BONES is a well done, excellently acted crime series based on the life of novelist Kathy Reichs who introduced her heroine Temperance Brennan in best selling novels.  In transferring her story to the tv screen, there's not a whole lot of similarity to the books.  Emily Deschanel is wonderful in the role of Temperance Brennan, a seemingly cool and aloof forensic achaeologist who can tell a lot about people from their bones.  She works with FBI agent Seely Booth, also well played by Buffy's hunk David Boreanaz.  Their romantic banter is nicely played and we soon find out that they both aren't what they often appear to be.  Brennan can be a little harsh and her lack of social aptitude hinders her relationships, but as the season proceeds, we find out a lot about her painful past, as we do with Boreanaz too.

The episodes are a little slow in pace, but each one is enjoyable and the supporting cast of Michaela Carlon, TJ Thyne, Eric Millegan and Jonathan Adams are top notch.

Although BONES is reminiscent of the popular CSI trilogy, it is different in many ways, as most of the victims have been dead for a while.  I wish it would pick up its pacing, but overall I enjoyed the season.",1165104000,4,1195,4.577464788732394

The characters are rich, not commonly known for people like us (regular people), because they're geniuses, that are strugling to be just like everybody else.

And in this show not only the main couple have great chemistry, the all cast work like a well oiled machine, beautifully together, with great chemistry.

The principal lady, well someone ""strange"" maybe, lacks of interpersonality relationships skills or known of tv shows, pop culture etc. When you meet her, you realize that she had experience some really hard things and that is the cause of her actual personality... just trying to avoid getting close to people so she can't be hurt.

And the FBI agent....ohohohohohohhohh .... THE FBI AGENT... what can I say (IT'S DAVID BOREANAZ!!!) it's smart, funny, handsome, sexy, charming, athletic and above all he really cares about the persons he likes.

We get to see the interaction between the two main characters. First they hate each other, just because they're so different but when the time passes and they get to know each other better and better and better, and they share personal things they realize that they are no as different as they think and that they had built a really rally nice friendship... a friendship that is full of richness and sexual tension... they just love each other but they can't figure it out yet.

The chemistry between Boreanaz and Deschanel is AMAZING, I doubt you will find another couple like this in today's TV.  No kidding.

The seasons to come (hopefully many many many more) are going to be very exciting as we get to see how they relationship grows with their love.",1164240000,8,1753,4.8006644518272426

The science in the stories (forensic anthropology) is fascinating, as is the view of the protagonist (Dr. Bennan) as she tries to compensate for her lack of social skills, with her brilliant abilities. I like this part of the show especially, as I always enjoy an exploration of the alienation of those with exceptional abilities. I also like the story of the FBI agent ( Special Agent Booth) as he deals with his own inner conflicts of his past. I guess I really like that there is an effort in the writing to give a real life depth to the characters.

I like holidays that are about what is good in the world.  Bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day.  I cry through half this episode, but in a completely good way.  Buy, watch it, love it.  But watch it with a friend if you don't want to cry alone.  So moving, great performances by the whole cast.  Emily Deschanel was powerful in this one, she brings real vulnerability to Brennan here.  David Boreanaz, as always the perfect sympathetic hero, loveably old-fashioned. Cute, funny moments.  Touching, poignant moments.  This really is the best of what is great about Bones.",1161648000,6,920,4.70440251572327
1551625,5,B00005JOXC,"This one has one of those touching endings where you get to see that even Booth has a heart...well, more so than we already know.  The ending got me, I got misty over it.  Enjoy with someone you love.",1158883200,5,200,4.102564102564102
1551626,4,B00005JOXC,"While not as great as many of the shows out there, this show is interesting and has a great cast.  Temperance Brennan is an unusual character for a leading lady in a drama, which is partly the shows appeal.  Not as good as CSI, but definitely a quality crime drama.",1158278400,6,265,4.28
1551627,4,B00005JOXC,"The series is great, but there are ""skips"" while viewing the DVD. A problem I've encountered before with double-sided disks. The packaging itself is good - Thin-Pack plastic cases.

1551628,5,B00005JOXC,"I'm not into all of the crime dramas that have currently taken over television (aside from the fabulous Cold Case). However, I found myself thoroughly enjoying the first season of Bones, which seemed to get better with every new episode. People talk about the romantic chemistry between Agent Booth (David Boreanaz) and Dr. Brennan (Emily Deschanel), but personally I love the playful chemistry they have as friends. As intelligent as Dr. Brennan is, she doesn't possess a lot of people skills and is constantly being taught to appear more sympathetic and less harsh by Booth (in a kind of role reversal) and her best friend, Angela. As the season progresses, we see her opening up a little more and viewing other people as individuals rather than simply as part of the cultures she's studied. We also see the trust and friendship being built between her and Agent Booth. Though the show's subject matter is often very unpleasant, the main characters all have a certain charm that makes it very enjoyable to watch. The show also has a delightful sense of humor that I think is lacking in most of the other dramas on TV. The writing is smart and David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel are extremely likable as the two leads.",1156723200,115,1219,4.781990521327014
1551629,5,B00005JOXC,"Good to see Bones: The Complete First Season is out on dvd. I've waited for this. Debuting in September 2005 on the Fox Network, Bones very quickly garnered rave reviews and amassed a loyal following. Bones is loosely inspired by real life forensic anthropologist and author Kathy Reichs. This funny, clever, sometimes gross, and totally addictive crime drama centers around forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperence Brennan (Emily Deschanel), who toils out of the Jeffersonian Institution and, on the side, writes mysteries starring her fictional heroine (and here's the twist) Kathy Reichs. Because Brennan has an almost supernatural ability to generate accurate assumptions based on her examination of the corpse's bones, she is often consulted by the FBI on difficult, seemingly unsolvable cases. She is frequently partnered by brash wiseacre FBI Special Agent Seely Booth (David Boreanaz), who seems to hold a bias against science and those who practice in that field. It's Booth who breezily saddles Brennan with the nickname ""Bones."" Naturally intuitive and freewheeling, Booth immediately is at odds with the clinically analytical Brennan. But, despite their personality clashes, and with the aid of Brennan's gifted and quirky colleagues, the cases do get solved.

It's no great secret that the palpable chemistry between Deschanel and Boreanaz is what actually propels the show and is what separates it from the other, more formulaic, dispassionate crime dramas. Every week, fans tune in for the leads'  deliciously caustic banter more so than for the weekly dose of mystery. You see, the mystery jones can be fixed by viewing any other one of the gazillion forensic dramas so currently prevalent on the airwaves. So the mystery is basically the MacGuffin that drives the show forward. But the cantankerous chemistry - that palpable ""something"" between the two leads as they hilariously bicker and wrangle - is definitely unique to this show. You won't find this sort of wicked rapport going on in any of the CSI or Law & Order shows.

Emily Deschanel  is a find. I haven't seen her before but she's awfully good and ingratiating enough with her acerbic character. She imbues Brennan with a cooly detached yet vulnerable and lonely quality that intrigues and endears her to the fans. Her social awkwardness and pop culture ignorance are also quite charming. It's pretty funny that a mention made regarding a pop culture reference almost always elicits a response of ""I don't know what that means"" from the clueless Bones. And, of course, her expertise in the martial arts doesn't detract from her allure.

And David Boreanaz. Yeah, I found it difficult going, at first, watching him in a new role, seeing as how I'm a fan of Buffy and Angel. But it helps that Booth isn't much like our vampire with a soul. This ex-Army Ranger Special Agent is breezy, personable, and outgoing, not brooding, tortured, and introspective like Angelus (although Booth, also, is trying to atone for past actions). So, the transition, while disconcerting for me, was ultimately smooth enough. Boreanaz brings such command, self-assurance and charm to his character that I bought into it soon enough.

My favorite episodes are the pilot episode, where we are introduced to the cast; ""The Man in the Fallout Shelter"" - the team is quarantied together in the Jeffersonian during Christmas and we learn personal stuff about the characters; ""Two Bodies in the Lab"" - character development galore in this episode as Brennan dates on-line and is targeted while she works on two cases; ""The Superhero in the Alley"" - a decomposed body is found wearing a superhero costume; and ""The Woman in Limbo"" - a gripping, emotional season finale as Brennan discovers shocking facts about her parents.

Special Features contain episode commentaries on the ""Pilot"" (with Exec. Producer Barry Josephson & Series Creator Hart Hanson) and ""Two Bodies in the Lab"" (with David Boreanaz & Emily Deschanel); Disc 4 has ""Squints"" - an 8-minute-long behind-the-scenes look; ""The Real Definition"" - A ""squint's"" guide to forensic terminology; and ""Bones: Inspired by the Life of Forensic Anthropologist and Author Kathy Reichs"" (with, of course, an interview with Kathy Reichs); and character profiles.

So, to sum it up, this show has a lot to offer. It has a fabulous cast, great character development, and engrossing, well-crafted  storylines. The forensic geek, the drama lover, the repartee admirer, the romantic (have patience) - all can meet here and each is guaranteed to come away with something from this intense, smart, funny series. Long live Bones, long may she ""squint.""

1551631,5,B00005JOXC,"""Bones"" is one of my favourite tv series. It is difficult to define it, due to the fact that it has crime, drama, mistery, and even some elements of comedy and romance. Strange, I know, but it works.

The two main characters in this series are Dr. Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel) and Special Agent Seely Booth (David Boreanaz). Temperance Brennan is a forensic anthropologist that works at the Jeffersonian Institution, and that also happens to write whodunnits in her free time. Seely Booth works at the FBI, and used to be an Army sniper. Of course, both characters are very different, and that is probably the reason why they clash from the very first time Temperance is asked to help out in one of Booth's cases. How can an anthropologist help the FBI solve a crime? Well, the answer is in ""Bones"", and it is more than interesting :)

All in all, I must say that this show is extremely engaging, and that I think it is getting better with time. I believe that you are highly likely to love ""Bones"", if you like a good thriller that has lots of action, but that also pays attention to the interaction between the characters. I must confess that I am one of those fans of ""Bones"" that cannot wait for the beginning of its second season, and I am pretty sure you will eagerly wait for the same thing if you watch this dvd. Recommended!

PS1: I forgot to tell you that I don't recommend this show for children, as some crimes scenes are more than unsettling.

PS2: If any of the scriptwriters of ""Bones"" is reading this, I have two things to say. First, THANKS!. And secondly, wouldn't Temperance and Booth make a great couple?",1152057600,7,1645,4.525252525252525
1551632,4,B00005JOXC,"Like a typical first season, Bones grapples to find its voice and gel the characters into a cohesive whole.  Thankfully, unlike many other series, the dynamic chemistry and delightful banter between leads David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel carry this series beyond its tottering first steps into one well worth watching by the end of its fledgling season.

While the Pilot episode didn't bowl me over, I liked the proposed premise and thought the characters had promise.  After Bones' debute, each succeeding episode revealed more about secondary characters who at first appeared as merely one-dimensional decorations on a snazzy set.  But that's what first seasons are all about; discovering who these people are, what they do, and why we should care about them enough to tune in every week.  Episode #9: ""Man in the Fallout Shelter"" is where I officially climbed aboard the Bones' fan train.  This episode showcased the promise of this smart series, solidified the cast and highlighted the unique charms each member brought to the ensemble.

Though I hope season two moves beyond the stand-alone episodic formula and branches out into some arcing storylines, this series is quite enjoyable and worth becoming addicted to.",1150502400,8,1223,5.209183673469388
1551633,5,B00005JOXC,"This programme is pure genius.  The main characters play off each other so well because they are so very different.

Booth is light-hearted and shows his emotions (up to a point - he is a man!) where as Temperance has been so effected by the disappearance of her parents and her perceived abandonment by her brother she is unable to show her emotions.  She has no social skills to speak of and this makes her unique and very interesting.  The supporting cast are also great, individual and complex.

The comments about poor acting really made me annoyed so I have had to put my opinion in.  Emily (Temperance) is supposed to be hard and unfeeling, that is the point of her character!  When she delivers emotive dialogue it is supposed to be wooden as she is unable to express how she feels, her work is everything so even when holding her mother's skull she is the consummate professional and doesn't let emotion cloud her work.

I have looked forward to this programme (and CSI; NY) every week and have watched every episode even though they play opposite Lost and Invasion and Cold Case and Close To Home here in New Zealand.

I can't wait til this is released on DVD and am extremely happy to hear there will be another Series.",1150502400,11,1230,4.529411764705882

7941298,2,B00005JOXC,"In marked contrast to the eminently readable, well-told, entertaining Tempe Brennan whodunit novels, season 1 of the Bones TV series comes across as a fantasy-based dark sitcom, developed and presented as an appealing diversion for the beta-wave brigade.
The Temperance Tempe Brennan I came to know from reading Kathy Reichs series of novels is vastly different from the Temperance Bones Brennan portrayed by Emily Deschanel in the TV series.  The ink on paper Tempe Brennan appears to be an intelligent scientist somewhat lacking in social graces, appearing a notch or two on the pretty side of plain.  On the flipside, based upon viewing the first season of the Bones TV series, Temperance Bones Brennan is verifiably a few giant steps on the opposite side of pretty from the ink on paper Tempe Brennan.  Furthermore, Emily Deschanel portrays her Bones Brennan character as a sometimes Aspergers savant, a sometimes pigheadedly defiant 12-year old and, once in a while, a somewhat normal person.  Fortunately, in contrast to the TV shows Bones Brennan, there is a genuine girly girl series regular in the person of Angela Montenegro, portrayed brilliantly by Michaela Conklin. Kudos to the other first season core characters, FBI agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz), technicians Jack Hodgins (T. J. Thyne) and Zack Addy (Eric Millegan) for their comedic contributions, and to Jeffersonian head honcho and straight man Daniel Goodman (Jonathan Adams).",1521504000,,1452,5.3
