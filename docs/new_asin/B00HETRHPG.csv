6160490,5,B00HETRHPG,"Great deal. The two great movies look nicely updated in blu-ray. Aside from the great films themselves, I was surprised to find a lot of additional material on both discs. The beauty of blu-rays/dvds (at least for me) are all the extras that can be added to help give a picture of what went on to make the films. The films are on separate discs making for overall better quality. If you're eager to add to your Clint Eastwood collection, this set is a great next purchase.",1330819200,,472,4.436781609195402

6160492,5,B00HETRHPG,"This is a must have for Dirty Harry fans. The picture and sound are awsome,and lets not forget the low price,what more could you possibly ask for? Well I guess free would be one of the things I could ask for,but that will never happen.

I love it.

6160493,5,B00HETRHPG,"""Dirty Harry"" and ""Magnum Force"" are arguably the two best Dirty Harry flicks, although fans can argue about this endlessly.  This double feature is too good to pass up and for the price is an outrageous bargain.  The mastering/remastering here is very good, and fans will like having a Blu-Ray copy of these films in the library.  ""Dirty Harry"" is a classic ""Good versus Evil"" film (has any villain ever been more evil than the villain in this film?) while Magnum Force, by contrast, warns of vigilantism and the danger of cops taking the law into their own hands.  Messages aside, these are excellent, fast-paced films that entertain with humor, violence, and Eastwood's best acting ever.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1324425600,16,717,4.983193277310924
6160494,5,B00HETRHPG,"This double feature blu-ray set is the cost effective way to add old movies to your library.  I like that there is a disk for each movie.  Some older DVD movie double-feature sets have a movie on each side of a single disk.  Having separate disks is much better.  ""Dirty Harry"" movies are classics.  If you were expecting a review of the film, there are plenty of those to Google.",1305676800,2,380,4.371428571428571

6160496,5,B00HETRHPG,"The rating is for the value along with the excellent picture and sound quality. You like these films or you don't, that is up to you. But if you love them like I do, these editions are the best way to get them. They save shelf space and if you shop around you will find even better deals then seen here. The best buy(hint) I found was these two films along with the other double pack with ""The Enforcer"" and ""Sudden Impact"" for $20. That's only $5 per blu ray. They aren't stripped of their special features either. So you miss nothing. Collecting doesn't come any cheaper.",1286323200,10,573,4.364485981308412
6160497,5,B00HETRHPG,"Had to wait till I saw both transfers before writing an opinion.  First:  what a great deal!  I got these blu-ray movies for $10 at Wal-Mart. So, I had little to lose.

It's been so long since I'd seen the movies that I'd forgotten what was going to happen, and it was like watching them for the first time.

The transfers on both were excellent.  There were a few grainy scenes in Dirty Harry, but I think it was the darkness of the scenes, and there are a bunch of those in Dirty Harry.  I didn't notice any grainy scenes in Magnum Force at all.

As a musician, I was very interested in the audio. I went back and forth between 5.1 and True Dolby.  There was a super difference in quality.  The highs were more evident, and the lows became clearer, cleaner, and smooth.  Great jazz soundtrack for Dirty Harry.  Wonderful drumming (both with sticks and brushes).

Loved seeing some stars who became individual stars, David Soul for one.  Robert Urich and Tim Matheson for others.  You won't be disappointed for getting these films in a blu-ray package at a great price.",1269129600,15,1070,4.471502590673575
6160498,5,B00HETRHPG,"Don't listen to people about double dipping. This is a great deal. Dirty Harry alone on Blu-ray is about $23.00, and Magnum Force isn't even available individually (it's only available in the Dirty Harry Box Set). Magnum Force is the best sequel, and it's great that you only have to pay less than $9.00 for it in this double feature pack. It's literally two of the best Dirty Harry films for the price of one film (actually, even less than one film, as Dirty Harry alone costs said $23.00 in that horrible blu-ray book). This packaging is much more compact and storable compared to the blu-ray books that Warner issues. The only reason Warner makes the blu-ray books is to justify a higher price and some completely forgettable booklet that you can't even remove from the blu-ray book. Buy it if you're a Dirty Harry fan.",1267056000,3,822,4.636986301369863

6160514,5,B00HETRHPG,"DIRTY HARRY has stood the test of time and remains a classic film based on the mores of a modern society tempered with logical judgment of how to dispense justice to those unlawful individuals in that society. Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry is the personification of that tool of logical judgment much to the disdain of his superiors and to the legal system he works within. DIRTY HARRY brings the motivations and morality of this character under close scrutiny as he comes full circle with a rather dichotomous approach to his job over the span of time. Looking at MAGNUM FORCE there is an attempt to justify the true motivations of the character, but that film did not seem successful thematically and seemed rather heavy handed at the time of its release. I see MAGNUM FORCE in a much different light now. For one thing, Eastwood's performance is very realistic and very natural. He is not the man on the edge that he was in DIRTY HARRY. He is methodical as he goes about his job and he is the dedicated civil servant. MAGNUM FORCE and DIRTY HARRY both very good dialogue that bring the character home.

Lalo Schifrin's scores for both films are very good. With MAGNUM FORCE, it seems like his music focuses more on Eastwood's character because he utilizes that particular melody quite a bit. It is a good counterbalancing of the Harry's ethics and motivations. Schifrin's score for DIRTYY HARRY seems to focus more on the villainy and the the psychology of Andy Robinson who is a complete psychotic sociopath.",1415923200,,1512,4.7272727272727275

6160520,4,B00HETRHPG,"Two of the best of the series. The running commentary for DIRTY HARRY is great, although the one for MAGNUM FORCE is a little disappointing. I have always loved watching John Milius being interviewed. He always provided a much needed macho tongue-in-cheek right wing humour to a discussion, but here he falls short somehow. He seems to write-off this wonderful sequel as just a good ""B"" movie. This disc has some great goodies packed onto the discs. If you don't want to spend the extra money on the deluxe DIRTY HARRY single film package, this is a great 2nd choice.
The only thing I hate is the audio tampering that both films have suffered even before this Blu-ray version. The replacement of certain sounds always takes me out of each film. Since both these films in-packed me at an early age, the loss of certain sound effects from the original release still knaws at me.",1388880000,2,876,4.658064516129032

6160523,5,B00HETRHPG,In a world of political correctness run amok we need Harry.

6160527,5,B00HETRHPG,"Dirty Harry is probably the best cop movie ever. It's nearly flawless. Magnum Force is it's sequel, which is nowhere near as good as the original Dirty Harry, but is still good and is also the best of the Dirty Harry sequels.

6160539,5,B00HETRHPG,"This movie is so good and so fun to watch - it makes you wonder why they don't make them like this anymore.  Clint Eastwood is fantastic as Dirty Harry.  The other cast does a fantastic job as well.  This is often on lists of great movies of all time, so we decided to watch it with our 17 year old son.  It was so entertaining.  I must have watched this movie 20 or 30 times in my life, and I enjoy it just as much each time.

6160540,5,B00HETRHPG,"What more can be said about this franchise? The nitty don't get no grittier. The Harry Callahan characterization  changed the American cop drama like nothing else before. Eastwood brought his ""Man with No Name"" tougher than nails attitude into the Twentieth Century, still on the outside, still looking in, still trying to right the wrongs of his era.

6160544,5,B00HETRHPG,"I've always like Dirty Harry but only recently discovered Magnum Force, I actually think I prefer it to Dirty Harry in many respects

Both movies look really great, for some reason films of this era always seem to brush up better on blu-ray compared to 80's films for example

Really colourful, sharp picture and great audio.. I especially love the music on both movies

A real bargain for the price and nice to have 2 discs in one slim case",1351728000,2,441,4.4875
6160545,5,B00HETRHPG,"It's been awhile since I saw these films, tho they were favorites when released in the theater.  They have held up well and their look and sound have definitely been improved from the original DVDs by Blu-ray treatment.  Each film is on a separate disc with bonus features  appearing on each of the two discs.

Turns out after time I liked 'Magnum Force' slightly better than 'Dirty Harry', tho both were the best of the series.  It came to my mind that Eastwood's Dirty Harry character was probably a inspiration for Raylon Givens charater in the 'Justified' series; tho certainly more so in the TV Series itself than in Leonard's short story upon which the series is based.

Getting to watch again a great cast in both these films was a pleasure, particularly to see those who have become screen staples over the intervening years.  I got great joy from again being reminded of Hal Holbrook's performance in 'Magnum Force'; enjoying his great performances over the the decades had blurred my recall as to how good he was in his role in this film.

Just as enjoyable as the two films were all the wonderful bonus features on each disc.  A great, very large package includes wonderful interviews and clips full of details about the films, the series, and much information on Eastwood's long and successful career.  Many clips from these two films do show up in some of the bonus features and provide a great sort-of-instant comparison to remind us just how good this older films appear on Blu-ray.

The films are great, the Blu-ray is splendid, the memories were fun, the many features are great bonuses, and the price is right.  Can't recommend this set enough, particularly if you may not want all the Dirty Harry series, just the best of the bunch.",1344816000,,1751,4.704918032786885

6160547,5,B00HETRHPG,"Don Siegel's DIRTY HARRY has stood the test of time and remains a classic film based on the mores of a modern society tempered with logical judgment of how to dispense justice to those unlawful individuals in that society. Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry is the personification of that tool of logical judgment much to the disdain of his superiors and to the legal system he works within. As viewers we cannot help but see it Harry's way under Don Siegel's direction. When the system breaks down, we are thankful that a blunt and decisive instrument comes forward and protects the innocent from all the parasitical freaks and dregs of their society. There is no job too dirty for Harry Callahan. There is something romantic about San Francisco, but the character of Harry is less a romanticized hero and simply just a necessary instrument to bring down the likes of psychopath Andy Robinson. And when Robinson goes down Eastwood symbolically tosses his badge in the drink for a thankless job well done.  MAGNUM FORCE is a direct sequel to DIRTY HARRY and subsequently the second film in the DIRTY HARRY series consisting of 5 films. To digress, those 5 films somehow never truly seemed like a series, but an initial film followed by one sequel after another. As a direct sequel, MAGNUM FORCE is a complete inversion of its predecessor. Instead of justifying his actions that appear to go beyond the law, Harry finds himself on the other side of the fence bringing in those law enforcement people who have truly overstepped their authority in a rather brutal fashion. These maverick officers seem to think Harry methods are too conservative to the agenda they have aligned to. This is not a bad film, but it seems too implausible (even given that it was scripted by John Milius and Michael Cimino) a plot and is orchestrated in rather lackluster fashion under Ted Post's direction when compared to Don Siegel's DIRTY HARRY. An early scene aboard the airliner shows Harry in true form and is probably the best scene in the film along with the dramatic handgun competition. Even with an impeccable cast that included Hal Holbrook, Tim Matheson, David Soul and Robert Urich and an over the top score by composer Lalo Schifrin, I still prefer some of the following Dirty Harry films to this somewhat experimental approach to justify Harry's persona and unique approach to getting the job done in today's society. I can still remember Reni Santoni asking in the original DIRTY HARRY, ""Why do they call you Dirty Harry?"" Well, seems like ages ago, but we know the answer.",1337040000,,2562,4.809523809523809
