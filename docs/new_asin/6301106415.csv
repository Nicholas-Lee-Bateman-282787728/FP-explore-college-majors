308613,1,6301106415,"Watching this movie the other day on cable made me cringe ... badly!  It is chock-full of those awful 80's clothes, makeup, hair and music montages (that ""Family Guy"" and ""South Park"" regularly make fun of nowadays).  The storyline is okay - about how tough the wrestling business is - but this movie just screams cheesy.

I was a die-hard wrestling fan from the mid-80's to the mid-90's and I was thrilled to come across this movie as a teen wrestling fan.  I was especially relieved that Hulk Hogan's name or face came nowhere near it and it had cameos by the late ""Classy"" Freddy Blassie, Ric Flair (who I was in love with then.  Thank goodness I've long grown out of that!), and the greatest wrestling of all-time, Bruno Sammartino.  I must confess that I enjoyed ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper's role (he doesn't have to say a word and I start cracking up.  He always had a wicked sense of humor and quick, biting wit!).

Major positive is that Hogan had nothing to do with this.  Major negative is that the movie is just downright cheesy.  - Donna Di Giacomo",1153526400,,1053,4.494736842105263

308618,2,6301106415,"""Body Slam"" was released in 1987, and starred Dirk Benedict (""The A-Team"", ""Battlestar Galactica"") and ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper (""They Live"".)
Back in the 80's when I was a HUGE wrestling fan, I stumbled across this movie and rented it in a second (me as a teen: ""A movie ABOUT wrestling? I'm so gonna watch that!"")
Benedict plays a down on his luck manager who, desperatly looking for a way back into the limelight, takes on a pro wrestler (Piper) as his new charge, but fails to realize how cut throat the business is.
Ok sure, ""Body Slam"" is no landmark cinematic achievement, but certainly it qualifies as a guilty pleasure. For an former (or current) wrestling fans, the film features quite a few appearances by some legends, including Bruno Sammartino, Capt. Lou Albano and Ric Flair.
I don't believe the film got a theatrical release (it just looks direct-to-video) and for years, I had no idea which studio owned the rights. Well, it was broadcast on Encore today and wouldn't ya know it, the MGM logo appeared at the end, so I think it's safe to assume it's an MGM title.
So if anyone from MGM ever reads this, maybe you guys can find a slot in 2004's schedule for a ""Body Slam"" DVD. Widescreen please!
If anyone would like to write MGM and ask for a release, here's their address;

308677,4,6301106415,"The 80's was a great time for a lot of different things, most notably the use of alternative entertainers appearing in motion pictures. For anyone that enjoys the combo of comedy, 80's rock, and wrestling, this is a great movie. In a lot of ways, this movie is a bit prophetic and historical, as it shows in its own way how wrestling went from being just some back woods hillbilly sort of thing to mainstream entertainment that is a major influence in the culture today.

Dirk Benedict is great in this film, playing the sleazy yet caring Harry who is like any other agent thinking of himself first, but also genuinely cares about his clients as well. If you enjoyed him in the A-Team, you'll love him here.

Tanya Roberts does her typical fare from this period as the beautiful love interest. She goes blonde for this picture which is a shame, but overall she plays a nice role that fans will appreciate.

Roddy Piper I think steals the show playing the veteran wrestler looking for a break. Reminds me of so many of the stars that came out of the 80's and 90's. Along with so many other wrestling legends in this film like Captain Lou (I tip my hat to him), you'll find they all perform remarkably in this film.

Overall, the movie has a bit of that 80's cheese feel, but if you enjoy a good comedy, enjoy wrestling, or just want something that is entertaining, I think you will enjoy this film.",1388534400,,1397,4.4453125

308731,2,6301106415,"I usually like Hal Needham films, I especially love ""Smokey & The Bandit"" and ""The Cannonball Run"". I also don't mind wrestling... when someone told me about this movie, I thought it would be a terrific movie and couldn't wait to see what Hal did with names like Roddy Piper and Captain Lou Albano. Unfortunately, what I got was Face from the A-Team going from managing musicians to wrestlers, and coming up with an idea to combine the two. Basically a band plays during the wrestling show, and they call it Rock N Wrestling.

Rock N Wrestling takes off to become a huge successful event that tours America. I find this a bit hard to swallow as a band playing amongst wrestlers was not a new idea, it had been done even as far back as the 70's. And I find it hard to beleive these guys would end up on the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine, especially as how an event like this would be peanuts compared to Wrestlemania which started a year or two before this films release.

Oh well, it was a film from the 1980's, lets suspend belief and try to sit back and enjoy the film for what it is. The title is called Body Slam, so you expect it to be something heavily in wrestling, however it takes a while for any wrestling to come into play, as most of the film is setting up Face as being a con-man who owes a lot of money and stumbled upon Slick Rick (Piper) and accidentally becomes his manager.

Face manages a tag-team who go up against the champions and lose, then go cross country making a big name for themselves, with a band called Sticks, and build up popularity. The tag team champs are a rip off duo of The Road Warriors (Legion of Doom) and horrible actors mind you. They are managed by Captain Lou ""Super Mario"" Albano and are a bunch of annoying typical 80's stereo type wrestlers with more muscles then brains. Of coarse, you can guess how the movie will end already.

Thats the whole plot... apart from Face wanting to win over a woman. Doesn't sound like much of a plot, because there isn't really one. Sure, you could say movies like Cannonball had no real plot, but it was full of entertainment and laughs through out it, where as this movie, not so much laughs as more, trying to take it too serious, and trying not to expose the wrestling world for what it really is.

I can't beleive anyone would actually say this movie is great, and I can guarantee you people giving it higher ratings then it's worth are just giving it those ratings because it contains actual wrestlers in it. Roddy Piper, Tama, Head Shrinkers, and a few more, as well as brief cameos by Ric Flair, Fred Blassy and a couple of others. However, looking past who is it in, I wouldn't give a favorite actor/actress 5 stars just because they are in it. In the end, it's not an overall stinker of a movie, i managed to watch it from start to finish, but when it was over, I have no intentions to watch it ever again.",1370476800,,2899,4.331491712707182

308736,5,6301106415,"I was so happy to see that Body Slam finally got a DVD release.  Technically, this is not a regular release, it's a DVD-R recording from MGM, but still, the disc plays well.  No chapter selection, but you can skip around.  The DVD extras are at the bare minimum because of its DVD-R format, there is a trailer, which I would assume was from VHS releases since the picture quality and trailer is quite horrendous.  As for the movie, picture is pretty crisp for a DVD-R, absolutely no complaints.

And for the film itself, I love it.  It's one of those films that gets better the more you watch it.  It's definitely very 80's!  The story revolves around Dirk Benedict's character, Harry M. Smilac, a sleazy but likable music promoter.  Smilac ends up getting into the wrestling business when he mistakes Roddy Piper's character, Quick Rick Roberts, as a musician.  Now Smilac is the wrestling's newest manager.  This doesn't sit well with Roberts' manager, Captain Lou Morano (ahem, Captain Lou Albano).  I'll stop giving away the plot there.  Anyway, the movie is just fun to watch.  If you're a wrestling fan, there are a TON of cameos - Ric Flair, Classy Freddie Blassie, Sika, Bruno Sammartino, etc...

There's actually a strong supporting cast - John Astin, Barry Gordon (voice of Donatello from TMNT), Tanya Roberts, Charles Nelson Reilly, Kellie Martin, and Billy Barty.

Body Slam also brings in the Rock 'n' Wrestling element with the band ""Kick"", whom I have never heard of beyond this film.  The music isn't bad (again, it's very 80's).  Although it may not be saying much, it's the best wrestling movie I've ever seen.  I highly recommend Body Slam, especially if you're an old school WWF or NWA fan.",1303862400,5,1710,4.755102040816326
308737,2,6301106415,"Awful, awful, and awful, ""Body Slam"" will only appear to the most seasoned pro-wrestling fan, wanting to poke fun at the goofiness of the 80s and just how far some wrestlers have come in the acting world. MGM's technical presentation isn't outstanding, but for as terrible as the movie is, it feels better than it should be. The general population should stay far away from this one though. 2 stars.",1303689600,,399,4.714285714285714
308738,3,6301106415,"Growing up a pro wrestling fan in the 1980s, ""Body Slam"" seemed (at the time) like something of a godsend, a MOVIE about wrestling starring some of my all time favorites? I enjoyed it then though even as a child I recognized this was not what one would consider to be a high class production. As an adult and avid movie lover now, you shouldn't expect great dialogue, glossy visuals from a movie directed by Hal Needham (""The Cannonball Run,"" ""Smokey and the Bandit."") Needham's direction, as it is, comes of sloppy and the editing does it no favors. ""Body Slam"" has all the style of a 80s made-for-TV production.

and 80s it is. The vapid music used throughout dates the film horribly but perhaps not quite as bad as star Dirk Benedict's (""The A-Team"") wardrobe. Benedict plays M. Harry Smilac, a down on his luck music agent/manager who stumbles into a negotiation between a lowlife promoter and ""Quick"" Rick Roberts (played by co-star and wrestling legend ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper.) Smilac thinks Roberts is a musician and quickly jumps into the fray, getting Roberts a much better deal than what his previous manager agreed to, the villain of the film Captain Lou Murano (a genius change of name for the man playing him, another wrestling legend, Captain Lou Albano.)

From this point on, Smilac realizes he has crossed over into an entirely new field and decides to cross breed his clients, booking his cheesy 80s ""rock"" band Kicks to perform at the matches for his growing stable of wrestlers. Of course this does not go over well with Murano who vows to destroy his former star Roberts and new manager both in and out of the ring.

The acting, such as it is, comes off as mostly forgettable (both Piper and Albano have done much better work in other films, ""They Live"" and ""Wise Guys"" respectively.) Benedict primarily walks through the story looking embarrassed.

Still, ""Body Slam"" has a hard to avoid B grade silliness that still makes this enjoyable to watch. Yes production values are amateurish, virtually the entire cast comes off as buffoons or merely doing it for a paycheck but the wrestling scenes are staged very well (one would hope so with all the real life grapplers involved) and Needham himself is a former stuntman. There are a few cameos that should please wrestling fans near the end of the film, most notably those by Ric Flair and Bruno Sammartino.

""Body Slam"" by NO means is a great film and it certainly has not aged well at all but for 80s wrestling fans feeling nostalgic, it would make for a entertaining sunday afternoon viewing.

MGM has released ""Body Slam"" though their ""movies on demand"" line, basically when you order a copy only then is it produced and mailed to you, this way for films that have very limited appeal, this is a major cost saving way to do it otherwise ""Body Slam"" would likely never see the light of day. Presented (for the first time on home video) in 1:85 widescreen (16x9 enhanced) the picture quality is about as good as you'd expect, in other words don't expect some kind of full restoration. Colors are a bit faded for example but this is likely the best it will ever look. Audio is Dolby Digital 2.0, not much in the way of bass and it comes of a bit tinny but again, short of a full remix, this is the best it will ever sound. The only extra is the film's trailer presented in a rather rough looking 1:33 frame. This is certainly a budget title and I wish MGM had priced it accordingly but if you're like me and you NEVER thought you'd be able to own it on DVD, you probably won't mind dishing out $20 for it.",1301097600,4,3571,4.554517133956386
