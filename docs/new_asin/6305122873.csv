7883884,4,6305122873,"This VHS Box Set is wonderful -if you're willing to accept its limitations. This set was released in 1998 and seemingly only on VHS. VHS tapes wear out, so unless you're willing to drop the money on a sealed copy, expect some wear. That said, the overall quality of the circa 1968 original tapes is wonderful, and the quality of the 1980s program that these are taken from preserves this well. The amount of music in this set is astounding, as there is -for good or bad- almost no narration or other filler. Sure, most of the artists aren't doing their biggest hits, or are at least doing other more forgettable songs as well. If you like '60s folk music or in general, you will find at least some music on this that is worth the average price on Amazon. Unfortunately no other footage from the original show ""From The Bitter End"" appears to have been released by this company or any other. Some other footage does show up occasionally though, such as the performances by Phil Ochs that appear on the PhilOchsVevo channel on YouTube. Around 5hr 5min worth of music for not a lot of money. Enjoy.",1427500800,,1095,4.507537688442211

7883886,4,6305122873,"If you are a Mitchell Trio or Michael Johnson fan, this tape collection can't be missed!  Check out the great harmonies of the Mitchell Trio and the early apperance of Michael Johnson.  This tape set is a must for all collectors of folk music.  The only problem is that some of the song selections are unusual.  However, watching these early performances is like mining for gold-some are so-so while others are great finds.",1101513600,,423,4.7534246575342465
7883887,3,6305122873,These 7 tapes have wonderful songs from the 60's. They include Linda Ronstadt from her early days but they don't include any Rick Nelson songs. He justs introduces the acts. I was upset since I'm a huge Nelson fan but  overall tape is exciting  to watch but don't buy if your looking for your  Idol Rick Nelson,946252800,28,310,4.4035087719298245
