7920780,5,B00004REMZ,This video is brillant but i hate cliffhangers. I am really glad that this is available subbed. The story is for teenagers and above not kids because of the nudity and violence. This story really shows how much they love each other.,992908800,,232,4.5476190476190474
7920781,5,B00004REMZ,"After failing with trying to couple with Miaka to steal the Shinzaho, Nanako get badly hurt by Tamahome. However, Miaka still feels that she lost her power. Feeling lost, she runs away from Tamahome and runs into Amiboshi, who was thought to be dead. It turns out that a couple has taken him in when they found him in a river. Amiboshi doesn't remember anything about himself and just assumes he was always the child of the couple. Miaka later reveals to Amiboshi who he really is. Meanwhile, Tamahome is in trouble as Soy seduces Tamahome into believing she is Miaka. However, it doesn't take Tamahome long to realize that she is not Miaka and makes a run for it only to be stopped by Tomo, a master of illusions who also has the other members of the Suzaku seven trapped in an illusion. Later, warriors attack the town where Amiboshi is. Amiboshi and Miaka split up to find Tamahome and manage to take out Tomo. However, Tomo reapears and staps his feathers right through Tamahome's chest, sending off a cliff. Tomo traps Amiboshi in vines and also puts Miaka into an illusion that will trap her and steal her powers. Quite a cliffhanger. I would keep this tape away from younger viewers for obvious reasons. The dub is played out very well just like other volumes. Overall, a pretty good volume that is recommended for those in love to watch.",984182400,2,1345,4.5850622406639

A familiar face returns and he does bring a major element of change, that may drive the seies in a new direction.  The only  drawback is that the most of the Suzaku Seven are in the desert doing  nothing and I got to wait a month for the next one.",953856000,3,342,4.121212121212121
