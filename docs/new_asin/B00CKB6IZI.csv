8582773,5,B00CKB6IZI,"It's great that Ted Williams has used his voice talents to help others.  He did a good job with the narration.  I have mixed feelings about the college kids - some definitely wanted to help, but others weren't very nice.  This is a tough subject to deal with on film and full credit to these guys for putting together an entertaining and enlightening look at the homeless.",1400976000,,372,4.522388059701493
8582774,5,B00CKB6IZI,"This is an intriguing film in that I did not expect some of the homeless to admit that they wanted to be there.  Overall, well put together - they tried to make it more like a musical celebration rather than your typical news-style expose.  It was tough watching the one guy eat grass, and the other one smoking a cigarette out of his eye was a little over the top.  This is definitely the best film I've seen about the homeless though.",1400025600,,436,4.2926829268292686

It does not interview any women, it uses a homeless person to speak about how most of the people he knows are on drugs, but ""there are some good people out here!""  What kind of message is that?  He also says college students have been very supportive of houseless in IV, and I think that is an assumption, not fact.",1381536000,,341,4.380952380952381
