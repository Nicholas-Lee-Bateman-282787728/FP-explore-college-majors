1332428,4,B00003OSU2,"Although Betty (Isabelle Huppert, who was 43-years-old when the film was released) calls Victor (Michel Serrault, who was 69) ""Papa"" on occasion in this smooth and restrained thriller from Claude Chabrol, he is not her father by any means.  The term is merely one of ironic affection.  What they are are modern ""gypsies"" living on the fringes of society plying their ancient trade.  Perhaps they were lovers in the past.  Clearly they are a team, dependent upon one another.  In particular what these small time con artists do is go to conventions, medical, dental, farm equipment salesman conventions, find a target and con the poor dupe out of some of his money.

Some.  The film begins at a roulette table on the French Riviera with Betty stringing along a not entirely bright lawnmower salesman whom she invites for a drink.  She slips some knockout drops into his drink and quickly invites him up to his room where, after he is out cold, Victor follows.  They take some of his money.  Victor insists on always playing it safe and using a rather strange but plausible psychology (which will figure later in the movie) of making the man think that perhaps he wasn't robbed, since if she had intended to rob him, would she have only taken part of the money out of his wallet?  They do forge his signature on a check, but he will only find out about that later, and indeed might not be sure about how that happened.

So this is a small time con.  Trouble begins for our vagabond thieves when Betty meets the CFO of a big corporation who is transferring five million Swiss francs in cash out of the country.  She senses the chance for a big score, and after the mark falls in love with her (she thinks) she brings Victor into the scheme.  With some tricky exchanges of the metal suitcase containing the money Betty and Victor end up over their heads in some very hot water.

The plot is a little on the unlikely side, as thriller plots tend to be, but the thing to keep in mind is the idea of taking only PART of the money.  This is what fools the bad bad guys (as opposed to the good bad guys who are our vagabond duo, Betty and Victor).

Any movie starring the incomparable Isabelle Huppert (La Pianiste 2001; Merci pour le chocolat 2000; La dentelliere 1977, and many more ) is worth seeing and any movie directed by Claude Chabrol (Une affair de femmes 1988; Betty 1992; La ceremonie 1995, etc.) will have something of interest in it.  Add a fine performance by Serrault, one of the great veterans of the French cinema, and ""Rien ne va plus"" is definitely worth seeing.  However the role played by Huppert does not challenge her and Chabrol's more famous films (some of them also starring Huppert) are decidedly more interesting.

But see this for the lighthearted chemistry between Huppert who is sublimely fetching and Serrault who is clearly past the age of any pretension.  Such a quasi-Platonic union based on the love that still warms the embers in a dying fire has become almost a staple of directors past their prime.  See Claude Sautet's Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud (1995) which also featured Serrault for another example.",1166659200,,3133,4.615523465703971
1332429,3,B00003OSU2,"A disappointing snoozer of a French art film, one of Claude Chabrol's later efforts... Isabelle Huppert stars as a con lady with an older accomplice, in what is (I assume) intended as a deconstruction of your typical caper flick, with the scams going awry and the plot details involving the ironic inclusion of modern European culture... But there's little momentum in the script and direction, or spark between any of the actors.  This film just kind of sits there and does very little to surprise or amuse.  Next!",1039478400,2,515,4.840909090909091
1332430,4,B00003OSU2,"This rather low key Claude Chabrol thriller which he wrote and directed, and which was the inspiration for the John Flynn 1983 Scam, is more a chuckler than a spine tingler. Isabelle Huppert and Michel Serrault have great chemistry as a father and daughter team of con artists who choose their victims from hotel conventions. The film begins with Huppert seducing a lawnmower salesman and Serrault observing, so that at first we think he is spying on Huppert because he is a hotel detective and on to her. Huppert doesn't even try to hide her duplicity by wearing a terrible and obvious black wig. Serrault is established as the mastermind of their operation, but Huppert upstages him at their next venue, a dentist's convention in St Moritz, when she appears with Francois Cluzet who has a suitcase of stolen money. Chabrol then toys with us with the allegiances of the three, and it's never clear who is trying to con who, until we reach the West Indies and things turn deadly serious. Chabrol underlines the menace of the climactic confrontation by having Tosca playing as Huppert discovers a dead body, and gives the floor of a gangster's house a checkerboard pattern. Hupperts second change of hairstyle may be inexplicable but it is definitely disappointing considering how beautiful she looks with long strawberry blonde hair and wearing dark glasses a la Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity. Chabrol also uses a white colour scheme, from Serrault's hair to the snow in St Moritz, the voluminous dress a dancer wears, and the colour of the family van, and the song Changez Tout at the end became quite popular.",996364800,8,1619,4.890909090909091
1332431,4,B00003OSU2,"""The Swindle"" marks another superlative effort from Claude Chabrol. A tense taut tale of a small heist gone awfully wrong, this is a thriller which will be appreciated by European film noir fans who  do not  mind the leisurely pacing and elliptical polt unfolding. Isabebelle Huppert  is superb as usual as a small time crook,and Michel Serrault is dazzling as  a cleverly disguised old timer. If you loved ""La Ceremonie"", this  one is definitely one to see.",955324800,6,458,4.896103896103896
7919308,5,B00003OSU2,"This is a clever film about two delightful con artists, who get in over their heads with some dangerous characters. Elegant, classy, with a subtle sense of humor, lead by the incomparable Isabelle Huppert and directed by the brilliant Claude Chabrol. It is not, however, a ""thriller"" as the film's write-up says. Just a sheer delight to watch, so forget trying to categorize it by genre and enjoy.",1520553600,,397,4.852941176470588

7919311,4,B00003OSU2,"Isabelle Huppert is a name to remember after her Acadamy Award nomination this year for 'Elle'. She gave such a memorable performance that will linger. This French film is twenty years old, and I may have missed the star if not told who it was. Another brilliant performance from this woman.

Isabel Huppert, plays Elizabeth aka Betty  and Michel Serrault, plays Victor in this film. We are not told right away what their relationship is, lovers, niece/uncle, father/ daughter who knows, but they work well together. They are both con men, fooling someone, but leaving just enough so that the conned isvnot really sure if anything has happened. They con men at conventions, and are quite successful. They drive a motor home from place to place and then back to Paris. They have expensive tastes, and Betty is apt to leave Victor after a successful con to go on vacation. In this film, a planned  con is open for interpretation. Is Betty conning, Victor, are they both conning other people?

This is a Hitchcock line suspense/thriller, humorous at times and then reverts to drama. Well planned, directed and superbly acted.

Recommended. prisrob 03-16-17",1489622400,2,1153,4.953367875647668

7919317,3,B00003OSU2,"Rien Ne Va Plus/The Swindle is another minor late Chabrol effort that spends too long treading water and which lacks the lightness of touch to really pull off the caper movie it wants to be. The first hour is flat, with Isabelle Huppert unconvincing as a conwoman you couldn't imagine fooling a deaf, dumb and blind man while Michel Serrault has little to work with as her partner in crime. But once the twists kick in in the last 40 minutes, it does pick up even if it never surprises, and at least the scenery is nice.",1201046400,,520,4.371134020618556
