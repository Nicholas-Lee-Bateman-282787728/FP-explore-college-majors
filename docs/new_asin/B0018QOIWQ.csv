The craft is being sent to the Northern Polar region of the planet in an effort to find ice. Craft can only be sent to Mars every two years due to orbit.

This begins with 141 days to go. It goes to Lockheed in Denver and then to Florida. 250 people work on the project. It is launched and that is it.",1438992000,,429,4.047058823529412

If anyone reads this review and is aware of a good DVD available from Amazon that documents the Phoenix mission to date or at least a bit further, I would appreciate being told via comment.  I have searched for it and failed to find it.  I have also searched Google.

I was able to find the following at Amazon (anyone know anything about this?):
