1750493,4,B00006FDAO,"Those who remember watching The Carol Burnett Show know that Tim Conway is perhaps the funniest actor to ever live.  The two films on this double feature DVD, Longshot and They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way, are not legendary classic comedies, but they each contain a number of very funny scenes and offer an overall kooky good time.  Tim Conway not only stars in both films, he wrote both of them.  Longshot (1985) is particularly noteworthy because it features a reunion of the funniest comic duo of all time, Conway and Harvey Korman.  They team up with Jack Weston and Ted Wass to form a team of all-time losers and underdogs.  They continually berate themselves for passing up opportunities in the past, missing out on some big payoffs just because they are afraid to take risks.  When a stable worker from the tracks tells them he can guarantee the victory of a longshot horse in a certain race, they decide, for once, to go for it all the way.  Their partner in the stables has a special little pep pill that will make the horse run like the wind, and he agrees to slip the pill to the horse if the guys will place a bet for him along with themselves.  Logic and common sense says the horse can't possibly win, but the guys not only place a huge bet on the horse, they borrow all of the money from a local mobster.  As the movie progresses, there is a lot of pretty funny physical comedy, Jonathon Winters shows up to add his own twist of fun to the proceedings, and the ending plays out much better than I expected.
They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way is actually the older of these two films, dating back to 1978.  In this one, Tim Conway teams up with Chuck McCann as incompetent police officers who are sent to jail undercover to try to find out where a notorious bank robber stashed the money from his heist.  No one at the prison knows they are cops, and no one would believe it, anyway, as these guys are just pathetically slow about a lot of things.  They find the money a few days before they are set to be released, but to their great dismay the only person besides themselves who knows they aren't really criminals suddenly dies.  Faced with the dire circumstances of a ten-year stay in prison, the duo decides to break out of jail and take the recovered money to the governor.  There are some really funny scenes in this movie, including a truly classic scene wherein Tim Conway finds himself ordered to pull the warden's bad tooth and has just a little bit of trouble with the Novocain - this scenario reminded me a lot of some of Conway's classic performances on The Carol Burnett Show.  Another memorable scene features Conway impersonating a Japanese translator at the governor's party.  Interestingly, this movie features two characters from The Dukes of Hazzard - Enos (Sonny Shroyer) and Ben Jones (Cooter).  This ending of this movie did leave me feeling a tiny bit cheated, but I can't complain about all the laughs I had along the way.
If you are a fan of Tim Conway, this double feature DVD is certainly worth picking up at its affordable price; you get about three hours and fifteen minutes of comedy, and you'll certainly enjoy a number of really funny scenes even if the movies as a whole don't live up to your expectations.  For me, the dentistry scene in They Went That-A-Way is worth the price of the DVD all by itself.",1052784000,41,3352,4.512396694214876

1750579,1,B00006FDAO,"You can read any of dozens of reviews about these 2 movies. Whether or not you like them is personal preference. What I think needs to be exposed, is that these 2 movies are either cropped or pan-and-scanned for the old 4x3 TV format. The packaging states that both movies are ""modified to fit your screen"". This doesn't make any sense! The time line involved for this product make this statement false. First off ... HD widescreen arrived 2 years before this DVDs production and it was clear from the beginning that widescreen was the future. Furthermore ... the menu ACTUALLY IS formatted in a 16x9 `widescreen' format. If 4x3 is the format which `fits our screen' why would the menu be the 16x9 WIDESCREEN? It is clear that they knew that the format for these movies wasn't `modified to fit your screen' (and it is also obvious that they really don't care how inferior the picture quality is). The conflict between the movie format and the menu format tells me that either the information on the case was false from the very beginning or they have made changes to the DVD since the first release, and failed to remove the deceptive statement from the case when the DVD was modified. In either case, this is a POOR product being marketed with ambiguous and misleading information.

Unfortunately these movies are not popular enough that they will ever be release in a high resolution and original format, so buying this VHS quality junk is the only option. Sadly, I am guessing that this is why the DVD is not even close to the quality most people are hoping for. Why should they make a decent quality DVD when they can get away with selling this low grade excuse for a DVD?

These are the cold hard facts. If you want these movies, this is the only option, but unless you just have to have them for your collection, I would recommend that you spend your money elsewhere.",1389139200,5,1873,4.571428571428571

There are long stretches to get a half-a-chuckle. As a matter of fact, the movie just seemed long period.

1750663,4,B00006FDAO,"These are not two of Time Conway`s best movies, but they are not bad. You could do a lot worse. They are far better than most of
the gunk that oozes out of hollyweird these days.
In the Longshot, Tim Conway, Harvy Korman, and freinds are a bunch of race track bums who get a $10,000 loan from a loan shark to
bet on a longshot in a horse race. It has some good laughs, but considering the talent of Conway and Korman, it really should have
been a lot better.
In They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way Tim Conway and Chuck McCann are a couple of bumbling cops that are sent by the governor into
a prison farm to find out where an old man hide his loot from a robbery. And with Dub Taylor as the warden and Richard Kiel (Jaws
from the James Bond movies) as the intimidating bad guy it makes for some good laughs.

1750664,4,B00006FDAO,"The Longshot

A group of four buddies (Tim Conway, Harvey Korman, Jack Weston, and Ted Wass), losers, but not bad guys, get a tip on a sure thing at the track--a longshot that's guaranteed to pay off big. The only problem is that they don't have the money to bet big enough to make it worth the while of the guy who's promised to fix the race for them. So they go to the local mob boss for a loan.

Which succeeds about as well as Tim Conway's character trying to seduce the money out of a rich dame. That is to say, not at all.

It's a comedy of errors, and boy, do these guys make a lot of them. This is a low-key sort of comedy, but the four are such genial losers you can't help but like them even while you know they're going to screw up.

My kids enjoyed it, too--in fact, one came in while I was writing this and said ""oh, The Longshot! That was a good movie."" Proof that it doesn't have to be all about slick special effects and frantic action.

__________

They Went That-A-Way and That-A-Way

Bumbling small-town deputy Dewey (Tim Conway) and his partner Wallace (Chuck McCann) are tasked by the governor for a top-secret mission known only to the three of them (Dewey, Wallace, and the governor): go undercover in a prison and try to find out where a notorious bank robber hid his loot.

Hijinks ensue. And they get wilder when the governor dies, and Dewey and Wallace decide they'll have to break out of the prison.

There are some hilarious scenes, like Dewey posing as a dentist and having a bit of trouble with the Novocain, and Dewey and Wallace posing as a Japanese translator and his wife, respectively, but the humor has a distinctly different tone than current humor. I wanted to describe it as low-key, but that's not really it. It's definitely over-the-top, but it's quieter, somehow. Oh, heck, I don't know how to describe it. If you have any ideas, pretty please let me know.

Anyway, it was different from most modern comedies, and I enjoyed it. No real themes or anything, just fun silliness--kind of like an extremely extended skit from the Carol Burnett Show.",1214438400,,2087,4.439790575916231

The Longshot is the better of the two movies, though I enjoyed them both. I laughed like mad at The Longshot it was perfectly cast and written by Conway. It was a very very funny film.

They Went That-A-Way was good also, it was basically a modern day Laurel and Hardy film, made in 1978.

Which makes the movie only more realistic. Any fan of gambling will appreciate the moments at the track.  Each character brings something different to the group, yet no one dominates the action even though Tim Conway appears to lead them.  It's a lighthearted comedy that has funny moments sprinkled throughout with a general depressing yet funny atmosphere...Watch for Tim Conway visiting Ms. Dixons apartment, it's one of the funnier sequences in the movie.",1102464000,14,797,4.969924812030075
