7969400,5,B00006IUIR,A double-feature worth having.  Digitalized for a nice clean viewing film.  A must have for all Hoppy fans.  lYou won't be sorry.,1361145600,,129,4.7727272727272725
7969401,5,B00006IUIR,These are the best renditions of old Cassidy movies available as the quality and sound and lack of defects make these the best in my opinion. The 2 movies on this DVD are both from 1936 and this was the second year of Boyd and Ellison working together. Ellison as a straight hot headed lover boy sidekick is my personal favorite but all that have come after as sidekicks have filled in well enough to make all Hopalong movies enjoyable. Well worth your time and attention if you share the same passion for great westerns!!,1178409600,3,522,4.505263157894737
7969402,5,B00006IUIR,I grew up watching Hopalong Cassidy. I had searched everywhere for these DVD'S no one had them and they didn't even know who I was talking about. Then I remembered Anazon.com. Finally I found them. These are old western TV shows. I would recommend these DVD's to everyone. They are great and no fowl language. Young kid's of today would love them.,1140652800,,347,4.612903225806452
7969403,5,B00006IUIR,"Paramount Pictures came up with a fine screenplay from Doris Schroeder and Vernon Smith based on a novel by Clarence E. Mulford ""Hopalong Cassidy's Protege"", released with a new title ""Call of the Prairie"". This 1936 film is just as fresh today with plenty of action as Shanghai McHenry (George Hayes) the leader of a gang outlaws, is planning to rob the Bar-20. Only one man can tame this notorious army of badmen ~ our man from the Bar 20...Cassidy. Director Howard Bretherton takes full advantage with his cast of players William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy), Jimmy Ellison (Johnny Nelson), Mauriel Evans (Linda), Howard Lang (Buck Peters), Al Bridge (Sam Porter), Willie Fung (Wong) and Chill Wills and His Avalon Boys. Johnny has gambling debts and is taken prisoner, while Buck is forced to give to fight off the bandits who leave empty handed.  At the very end of the film McHenry (Hayes) saves the day by warning Hoppy, we knew durn well Gabby couldn't be all bad in this western yarn.
With ""Heart of the West"" another Paramount release in 1936, based on ""Mesquite Jenkins, Tumbleweed"" (Clarence E. Mulford) with the guiding hand of director Howard Bretherton and our fine cast of William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy), Jimmy Ellison (Johnny Nelson), Sidney Blackmer (Big John Trumbull), Lynn Gabriel (Sally), Charles Martin (Jim Jordan), but wait ~ enters one of our favorites in all of westerns George ""Gabby"" Hayes (Windy Halliday).  Hoppy and Johnny save Windy from drowning...thus the adventure begins with rustlers, stampeding herds and outlaw take-over ranches for their own profit.  Mixing dynamite with a cattle stampede does the trick for Hoppy and the rest of the good guys.
Must mention that it was sure good to see one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks George ""Gabby"" Hayes throw in with Hoppy.  The added special features are simply great ~ Coming Attractions:""Hopalong Cassidy:Public Hero #1"", plus a poster gallery, still gallery and my favorite is original materials from ""Merchandising King of the Cowboys"" museum exhibit.  Hope ""Image Entertainment"" will keep releasing this outstanding series featuring Hopalong Cassidy in glorious black & white.  I'll be standing in line for the next adventure with the Bar-20 wranglers ~ William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy), they'll never be another like him ~ gotta love it.",1036713600,15,2324,5.134920634920635
