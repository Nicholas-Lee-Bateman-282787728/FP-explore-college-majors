3064549,5,B0011FLGUQ,"excellent box kit, great movies with a excellent delivery. I have all the collection and its a documentary you can watch again and again",1357603200,,136,4.708333333333333
3064550,2,B0011FLGUQ,"As I've said before, I'm a huge Clive Cussler fan. I own both books these movies are from, annnnnd. I really wanted to like this, I really did. Buuut alas, I couldn't. i felt like I was being lectured on shipwreck diving, and how to preserve shipwrecks. Instead of exploring the wrecks, I give it two stars. The books are much more exciting",1329868800,,340,4.412698412698413
3064551,5,B0011FLGUQ,"It's frustrating that only 13 episodes (from 38) are available on DVD, I don't want them on instant, I prefer DVD.",1328054400,,114,4.476190476190476
3064552,4,B0011FLGUQ,"Clive Cussler is an incredibly knowledgeable fellow, but not an extraordinary speaker, good thing he does not narrate the entire show, and just makes cameo's for comments, that said the shows move well and are informative. Well filmed and worth the time to watch. If you enjoy undersea archaeology then you will find this fascinating to say the least. Interesting topics. I would probably rate it 4 out of 5 stars.",1327190400,,414,4.845070422535211
3064553,4,B0011FLGUQ,"Clive Cussler,famed best selling author,who also has had a long standing passion for the sea and its underwater shipwrecks,is back to host volume two of the Sea Hunters. And like volume one there are some fantastic eps of dives onto hitherto undiscovered wrecks,writing new chapters into the history books.
Included in this volume,a two disc collection in slims packs and all inserted inside a bigger box,are the following eps:
The Carpathia-We all know about the Titanic but do you recall the ship that first arrived on the scene to rescue its passengers? This is a dive to locate and find this lost ship.
The Andrea Gail-This is a search for the fishing boat who was the central focus of the book and later film called the Perfect Storm.
The Vrouw Maria-In 1771 this ship was returning to Russia loaded with historic paintings and other booty for Catherine the Great and which now lies on the bottom of the Baltic.
Russalka-This is a dive to a wreck also in the Baltic. In 1893 this Ironclad was lost in a terrible storm and is well preserved,yet is sitting in a very odd position.
The Akron and Macon-The search and dives on two of the U.S.Navy airships lost on the 30s,one off the west coast,the other off the east coast.
The SS Alabama-A look at a Civil war raider ship of the south,designed to beat the Union blockade of the southern ports.
These six eps will have you literally glued to the set,from beginning to the end. These dive teams may be experienced but they take nothing for granted as the sea can be an unforgiving taskmaster. One tiny mistake could cost ones life,especially in the deeper dives.
I took one star away from this set,as good as it is,because unlike the first volume there are fewer eps on this one(six compared to eight on volume one),which of course means one less disc(two instead of three)and there are NO bonus features at all. This really should be the cheapest set of the two but it isn't. Go figure.
Anyone with the least bit of interest in underwater archeology,diving and shipwrecks will just love volume two of this series. This along with volume one is a must have. Highly recommended.",1326499200,,2128,4.662234042553192

Clive Cussler's Sea Hunters-Set 2 is a suspensful lesson about many ships that have made a difference in our history.  I had the wonderful feeling with each segment, that I was actually on each voyage.
I would recommend this Set to anyone, beginning in Sunken ships, or advanced knowledge.  Excellent material.",1210723200,2,672,7.828947368421052
