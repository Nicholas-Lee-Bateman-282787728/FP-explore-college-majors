2840202,5,B000QUCRGO,"This is a decent documentary of Princess Diana & only giving it a 5 Star because Im a fan of hers! There are better documentaries of her out there, but this one is worth it too! Personally I think this one could be better if they added more people who knew her more & better then Mr Mohammed al Fayed(Dodi's father)! But this is worth checking out at least!",1261180800,2,357,4.188405797101449
2840203,5,B000QUCRGO,"It is a very nice dvd & i enjoyed watching it. It is based on eye witnesses who were their with her in her last weeks ,so it displays un seen story & dialoge we have never seen or knew .Actors played their roles more than perfect very similar to the real characters .I advice people to see Diana in her last days with Dodi & explore in her intimate life.",1191369600,4,354,4.0

2840217,2,B000QUCRGO,"There were a few new things I didn't know about the late Princess Diana mentioned in this documentary, but the quality of it was so terrible I had a hard time watching it without feeling like I was going to be sea-sick.",1406764800,,219,4.238095238095238

2840219,1,B000QUCRGO,I've seen several documentaries about Princess Diana. This one is the absolute worst! It's mostly about her attraction to astrology and psychics and the people she saw in these fields. There's very little real history about her. Poorly done!!,1400716800,,242,5.230769230769231
2840220,4,B000QUCRGO,"I would have like to know more of the personal side of Diana and maybe no one knows that. I saw all of the public parts already just wished that they could get more into the dynamic of family and siblings and relationships that developed her personality.
Such a beautifully compassionate woman, I wonder what made her feel like not enough.",1400630400,,339,4.573770491803279

2840222,2,B000QUCRGO,"It's 2012, but hostess Joan Collins looks like she's just walked off the soundstage of ""Dynasty."" She can't resist reminding viewers that she met Diana ""several times,"" and that she loved San Tropez first. Na na na na na.. There's a heavy emphasis here on interviews with Diana's faith healers, astrologists and acupuncturists. They offer very little insight. The interviews with Mike Walker of the National Enquirer are actually the best!  We haven't heard from him over and over, and he seems to have liked and understood Diana. He respected the adversarial relationship she had with the press, and admired the clever ways she pulled off end runs around the paparazzi. Video and sound are uneven, and of the million or so images there are of Diana, only about 20 are used here. Over and over.",1399680000,,794,4.838235294117647
2840223,1,B000QUCRGO,"The movie was for my wife who is a big Diana fan but she said it was not one of the better one's that she has seen. Said it
made Diana look like a mental mess",1399248000,6,158,3.4166666666666665
2840224,1,B000QUCRGO,"I watched this through Amazon Primes free and unlimited streaming; so in my opinion nothing but my time was lost. If the plethora of Psychics and Mystics, dubious Editors or Authors weren't the giveaway that the content was going to indeed be questionable, then all one had to do was wait long enough for Joan Collins to begin reciting (incorrectly) the particulars of her own English history, on two occasions she erroneously refers the late Duke of Windsor as King Edward VII; when he was in fact Edward VIII. One has to ask, did neither the Director nor Ms. Collins not catch the mistakes; or was it just that they simply did not have the budget to reshoot those portions, either way it speaks volumes for the integrity of this documentary. And of all the wonderful titles offered by Amazon this is not one that I would remotely recommend.",1398556800,3,842,4.657718120805369
2840234,5,B000QUCRGO,"I liked the way they portrayed princess Diana, who was more than a princess. She was definitely a beautiful human being, and it was nice to hear what everyone that knew her closely had to say about her.",1393891200,,202,4.342105263157895
2840235,1,B000QUCRGO,"cheap cheap cheap!
When one of the main ""authorities"" on Diana is ""Mike from National Enquirer"", something's fishy here!
Andrew Morton is a sell-out, and need I say more about the ""astrologers/friends"".
I hope her kids never see this.
Has anyone noticed that the person most vilified in the whole Diana saga, has never spoken out?
(and please someone tell Joan Collins, her time is up!",1393718400,3,385,4.848484848484849
2840236,1,B000QUCRGO,There's so much wrong with this silly film I don't know where to begin.  A number of mystics are interviewed about Lady Diana.  What a waste.  Why should we care what an astrologer thinks?,1393632000,7,188,4.470588235294118
2840237,1,B000QUCRGO,"This was an ""as-told-to"" spying-through-the-keyhole-and-rummaging-through-dustbins combination of pseudodocumentary and pop hagiograpy, Joan Collins was the ""anchor,"" I guess by virtue of celebrity and the remains of an English accent, and the ""experts"" interviewed included a clairvoyant, a masseuse, and some (probably very minor) former member of her staff, which last interview was shot in the public park outside Kensington Palace, well away from the palace itself--in other words, where anyone can shoot just about any footage they like: ""Just behind those trees is the wing where our offices were,"" declaimed in portentous tones--that kind of thing.
I turned it off in disgust at the point when they started following a psychic through Dodi Fayed's London apartment. His father seemed genuine, and I felt for him that his obviously real love and grief for his son were so tarnished by association with the rest of the picture.
The whole sorry affair left me wondering where I might find a shower.",1393286400,4,1003,5.314465408805032
2840238,5,B000QUCRGO,"My wife just loves it. We took a little trip and she watched the movie while I was driving. She it was easy to follow, and very well done. Now I guess it is time to get her more",1392508800,,177,3.5641025641025643

2840240,2,B000QUCRGO,This video is a rehash of what has been said before. A total waste of time. I only watched about 30 minutes of it.,1391385600,,114,3.7916666666666665
2840241,4,B000QUCRGO,Nice start into  the  life  of 1  of  the  Greatest Women and  role models of  our  times. Very well put  together,1390521600,,114,4.0
2840242,2,B000QUCRGO,"Princess Diana was a sweet, beautiful soul and her death was a loss to the world.  In this movie, there is way too much gibberish and way too little of the Princess.  I feel bad that someone made money just by putting her beautiful face on the cover and put so little of her in the movie.  It's a total waste of time and money.  The only thing that kept me from rating ""I hate it"" is that her name is on it.",1389052800,,407,3.8674698795180724

2840245,3,B000QUCRGO,"It seemed like a TV show, nothing really new in it after all the things we've read about Diana.  It was a fantasy life marred by tragedy, what else can be said.",1385337600,,160,4.0
2840246,2,B000QUCRGO,This was really a tribute to Dodi rather than about Diana. It also featured her astrologer. I was hoping for more on her.,1376438400,8,121,4.304347826086956
2840247,5,B000QUCRGO,Great look back at a most loved person... though Joan Collins did a wonderful job of hosting.  Appreciated info had not heard of before.,1375315200,,136,4.666666666666667
2840248,3,B000QUCRGO,"This looked into a lot of Diana's past which I did find interesting. But it dwelled on her accident a little to much, which no matter what we do today, is all to much speculation. Only God and, Doty, and Diana will know what really happened an they took that to their grave. There was a nice interview from Doty's father which also added more history to Diana's past. I did like it, but it left me with an uncomfortable feeling when it was over.",1374278400,,445,4.247058823529412
2840249,2,B000QUCRGO,"While I enjoy a good story as much as the next person, this video was full of fantasies.  Mohammed Fayed is still pushing his fabrications about Diana being engaged to Dodi, that the Duke of Windsor's old home in Paris was going to be their residence, etc. The most enjoyable thing was seeing pictures of Diana over the years and the memories they brought back.  It's just too bad the story was so patently false.",1371945600,9,413,4.493333333333333
2840250,3,B000QUCRGO,I didn't think this did her justice at all.  I think Diana was amazing and what this focused on was the same trash the tabloids did!  One of the primary people who did the talking about Diana was a person from a tabloid!  They also had two of her spiritual advisers...really!  They knew Diana best????  This was rubbish and Joan Collins  please.....,1371168000,3,349,4.548387096774194
2840251,1,B000QUCRGO,"After seeing the other reviews, I am blown away.  This is by far the absolute WORST portrayal of one of the most amazing people that ever touched our world.  The people who talk about her include her psychic, astrologer and acupuncturist.  Her astrologer at one point is describing two dreams she had that could have been a ""sign"" that Diana was going to die.  What they talk about has been known for a long time and their descriptions are weak at that.  Last, if you are looking to see Diana in action, you will be disappointed.  They do not have anything live, just a set of well known photos shown over and over again.  I have tons of Diana memorabilia, but this DVD is going in the trash!",1367020800,17,692,4.359375
2840252,5,B000QUCRGO,Very informative and well produced. You really get a feel of how Diana held up under all the pressure of royal life.,1362787200,2,116,4.318181818181818
2840253,5,B000QUCRGO,"As a fan of Diana, Princess of Wales, I have watched and read many topics on this amazing woman. This was another interesting look into Diana's world, hosted by Joan Collins. Of course we all know the stories that surround Diana but if you're like me...I can never get enough and this program was a wonderful tribute to the Princess. There are interviews with two of her main astrologers and two women I believe she trusted. Andrew Morton provides his expert knowledge on the princess and is believable when he says that he is certain that had Diana lived after that night in Paris,  she would NOT have continued her relationship with Dodi for much longer. Of course, Mohammed Al Fayed is also  part of this feature and he has generous things to say about Diana and still appears as obsessed as ever with his theory that Diana and Dodi were murdered by the Royal family to prevent the princess from marrying a Muslim. Al Fayed is a grieving father and I sympathize with him but I find some of his ""memories"" of Diana and Dodi's relationship a little delusional. Afterall, they had only been seeing one another for 11 days. I'm sure Dodi did buy Diana a gorgeous ring but those closest to her insist Diana would never have married Dodi. Diana loved her boys too much to make such an outrageous decision.
Most of the video footage and photos are nothing new to the public, however, there is an incredible glimpse inside the home of Wallis Simpson and the abdicated King George VIII, Prince Edward. Al Fayed speculates that Diana and Dodi were going to live at the House of Windsor in France once they were married. Dodi's bereaved father claims the Princess and the playboy were going to announce their engagement THAT Monday....had they survived. I doubt this as do her closest confidantes. Andrew Morton, Penny Thornton and others give convincing and kind insights into the private and public life of one of the greatest, most beautiful and fascinating women of the 20th century. ""No one like her shall ever pass this way again."" This is a must for serious Diana, Princess of Wales fans and collectors.",1362182400,5,2102,4.678378378378379
8197380,4,B000QUCRGO,"This is mostly a collection of interviews of people she knew including the author of the book about her and Dodi's father. Includes some images. At the end there is a  recreation of her post-accident treatment and it is compared and contrasted to the United States and France. Insightful and sad to watch.

She resorted to New Age ideas to see if there was light at the end of the tunnel and had her chart done. RIP.",1506038400,,416,4.3896103896103895
8197381,1,B000QUCRGO,"Disappointing documentary containing factual errors. I purchased this DVD thinking it was part of 'Lifetime TV: Intimate Portrait' series - boy, was I wrong! Had some nice footage of Diana, but the host claimed that the Queen made her speech regarding Diana after Diana passed away at Windsor Castle (nope - Buckingham Palace.) Frankly, I don't understand the errors, even a quick Google search can confirm facts. Purchase at your own risk!",1501459200,,440,5.125

8197387,1,B000QUCRGO,"This is a terrible documentary. Joan's commentary is often partially about herself or is ridiculous. They bring in a psychic to go through Dodi's apartment to see if there are any ""memories or remnants"" of Diana there. Their documentary style and interviewees were completely limited to 1 genre of people in Diana's life and that's the perspective they take on everything : an alternative spirituality spin. It was very disappointing.",1432684800,2,434,5.214285714285714
8197388,5,B000QUCRGO,"Of course, even in death we can never get enough of Princess Diana. She was England's breath of life to not only her English subjects, but to the world as well. What woman wanted to be and look like her? Without the happiness she lived, and the mother we all hope to be. She would be ecstatic with her new granddaughter now, but she is enjoying her sons and grandchildren more than what we ever will know. As for this documentary about her, she had a world all her own looking for the earthly happiness and especially the love that was denied her by the Royals and especially Prince Charles. So it is to no surprise that she consulted Astrologers and Psychics before her untimely death.",1430956800,,686,4.4523809523809526

I met Taylor Swift a few times and I live in Nashville- doesn't mean I'm anyone significant in her life. Joan spins everything to be about herself.
