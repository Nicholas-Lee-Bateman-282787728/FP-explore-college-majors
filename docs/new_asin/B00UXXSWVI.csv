7071895,5,B00UXXSWVI,"I watched this in English dub, and Japanese with subtitles on the Funimation app. I have to say as far as prequels go this is definitely worth the watch. You will find yourself falling in love with some of your favorite characters all over again. The storyline does follow three indecisive teenage girls, adjusting to life for the very first time at the DWMA. If you're looking for an easy watch that is cute and playful, then this is for you. Soul Eater Not! By no means destroys the original series, but definitely is not as epic as the original. It will explain a few things here and there leading up to the original series but nothing too major. Every anime fan probably already has Soul Eater in their collection. Soul Eater Not! will make a fine addition as well :-) I have already preordered it, as well as Soul Eater Premium Edition!",1435276800,3,841,4.503267973856209
7071896,5,B00UXXSWVI,First thing is that yes this is dubbed! This series is a very good addition to the original series and the events taking place here are before the original series and it does answer a few questions like death city is in America (Death Valley Cal.?) and one big question about Sid but enough of that. I really enjoyed this series it doesn't have as much action and is not as intense as the first series it focuses more on the three girls and their adjustment to life at the school and with each other. Most of the characters from the first series show up some more than others and most of the action takes place in the last few episodes if your a fan of the original Soul Eater you should enjoy this series also. Their is a bit of teaser fan service but not a whole lot so don't let that influence you I recommend this series highly I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and would really like to see more from this franchise it's always been entertaining.,1433894400,17,953,4.184782608695652

7071899,5,B00UXXSWVI,"Loved the actual Soul Eater and this one is just as cool.  It is a proper prequel, but doesn't base itself off of the main characters of Soul Eater.  It has its own main characters who drive the show.  It has some decent action scenes, but it mainly focuses on school drama against witches that wish to destroy what the school stands for.  I buy a lot of my anime based on the lack of ""Fan Service"" so I can watch it with my kids.  This show has mild elements of fan service, but not enough to detract from what is going on.  There is a segment where one of the main characters is talked about because she isn't as.... uh...chesty as another character, but this isn't something that comes up often enough to be a deal breaker.

All-in-all, this show is pretty cool for the family, and ties up some loose strings left behind from watching Soul Eater.",1459987200,3,849,4.30188679245283

7071901,5,B00UXXSWVI,"This is a prequel to Soul Eater. I like this so much better because it tells a story of how some girls get into the academy and figure out what they can do, and how things work. And it's not too long. It's fun with action, and cameos from the original series.",1458950400,,259,4.0
7071902,5,B00UXXSWVI,Happy that I added to my anime collection. Loved watching it.,1454976000,,61,4.636363636363637
7071903,5,B00UXXSWVI,"I enjoyed the original Soul Eater immensely. When I heard about this spin off, I was worried because it didn't have the same feel as the first series. As it turns out, that is a good thing. It's Soul Eater from a new perspective. The new characters are cute and likable, it also showcases some of the side-characters from the original series that never had much screen time. I like how the originals showed up, but the story never focused on them, it was entirety about the new characters and their growth as friends and how they fit in together.",1454544000,,546,4.47

7071913,5,B00UXXSWVI,definetly worth the buy I have the first four sets of dvds of soul eater I should waited for them to come out in one box set. but I didn't I loved the first soul eater so I heard there were dubbing this series I was like oh to joy. I love the charaters I love the girls the show good friendship and growing. I won't say what happens I glad I bought this I am a fan.,1438041600,,365,3.6923076923076925
7071914,5,B00UXXSWVI,A nice little prequel. Hopefully we get more soul eater content.,1437523200,,64,4.909090909090909
7071915,4,B00UXXSWVI,"The anime is great top notch quality but the packaging for it not so much. If you like Soul Eater then this anime is for you. I watched this anime dubbed and it was very well done. My only complaint and the reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the packaging is terrible. The box came cracked and won't close all the way with the paper cover slip, also  the back part of the case art is very blurry and over saturated.",1437523200,,425,4.059523809523809
7071916,4,B00UXXSWVI,"Soul Eater Not's a pretty fun romp with action, slice of life, yuri (girl+girl romance), drama & more sprinkled all through out. This anime prequel definitely has alot going for it underneath its cutesy exterior if you give it a chance. Firstly a much better climax compared to the original SE anime with its filler and dumb punch to the face. Support characters (such as Clay, Akane, Jacqueline, Kim, Ox, even Liz & Patty) also get their time to shine too, the English dub was well done. And the fight scenes were also fluently and well animated just like the original SE anime. Pertaining to the title the primary reason for it is because the 3 female leads are Not-Class Students of the DWMA Academy (Not because it's Not Soul Eater). But if you are craving action packed episodes with unique art often like the original then be sure to keep expectations low.",1436400000,6,862,4.640522875816994
8708708,5,B00UXXSWVI,"This shows a bit more tacky like kill la kill, not a bad thing but a different feel from original soul eater for sure, I'm about half way through right now for this review but i do love seeing soul and makko in the series and the origins thing that's going on is cool. I'm happy to have purchased this series along with the og soul eater",1524614400,,337,4.044776119402985
8708709,3,B00UXXSWVI,I love SE and loved the SENot manga. But just could not get into the anime much. I'm shocked at myself...,1518134400,,105,4.0476190476190474
8708710,5,B00UXXSWVI,For the soul eater fans who watched the original season this is a must own to keep up with the original story you'll find a couple of surprises,1502582400,,143,4.142857142857143

8708713,4,B00UXXSWVI,"Soule Eater Not is exactly as the name suggests, it's not Soul Eater. It's cutesy, it's super fan-servicey, but at the same time, it's set in and expands upon the Soul Eater universe. While I haven't finished watching it, what I have watched is good. Recommend it for the hardcore Soul Eater fans out there that are interested in the universe and characters, not just in the action of Soul Eater.",1484611200,2,396,4.591549295774648
8708714,5,B00UXXSWVI,The box there was a little bent at the top corner but other than that it showed fantastic and it came five days early. It has both Blu-ray and DVD versions,1483142400,,155,4.032258064516129
8708715,5,B00UXXSWVI,It isn't the same as the original show but it was very cool to get a different perspective of the DWMA before the original story took place. Worth having in my collection for sure,1475625600,2,179,4.294117647058823
8708716,5,B00UXXSWVI,Not a bad anime but feels like a different movie. However some soul eaters dose show up now and again.,1474848000,,102,4.15
