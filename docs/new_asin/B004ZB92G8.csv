4506655,5,B004ZB92G8,"I have been using Leslie Sansone's ""Big Burn Intervals"" for the past 10 weeks and decided to try Amy Dixon's ""Total Workout in 10"" and ""Ultimate Fat Burn"" workouts as a way to spice up my routine, amp up my stamina and suprise my body. I quickly became a fan of Amy's warm, inspirational yet no nonsense personality!  While browsing Amazon.com for more interval training videos, I came across ""Breatless Body: The Ultimate Calorie Burn"" and was instantly intrigued: not only do I get to ""work out"" with the wonderful Amy Dixon but I get the benefits of a HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training"" Tabata protocol work out as well.  WINNING!

When I received the DVD, the first thing I did was watch the entire workout and knew it was going to be tough, regardless of whatever level you choose. Amy has a beginner, intermediate and advanced level so there are points for EVERYONE to start from and aspire to! Many of these drills (speed skaters, jumping jacks, mountain climbers, jumping lunges, punching high and low), I have done at a local boxing gym and as a part of Wushu martial arts training but needless to say, after giving birth 10 months ago, I haven't done them in a while!  By the end of the entire Jumping Jack set (the first drill!), I was truly ""breatless"" and by the end of the entire 8 drills, my lungs felt as if they'd been scrubbed clean!  Even as I type this, I feel like after one workout, my lung capacity has improved!  Based on this, I can see how Tabata protocol can quickly improve your cardiovascular and endurance levels!  As other reviewers have noted, this is a hard, intense workout BUT if you follow Amy's directives in the introduction to go at your own pace or level, take breaks when needed and bring your best mental attitude to this workout, you'll do great and will love it!  And what I truly appreciate about this workout is that it isn't the same static workout day after day: you can truly progess to the different levels as your fitness and stamina improve!  This is another fantastic workout by Amy Dixon!",1310169600,17,2047,4.5710382513661205
4506656,5,B004ZB92G8,"I am not new to Amy Dixon, but I've never tried interval-style workouts before. I'd hit a weight loss plateau, so I was willing to try this DVD. Twenty seconds is nothing, right?

Wrong. This workout is intense, and if it wasn't for Amy's modifier Aimee, I wouldn't have been able to do this at all. It starts off simple with a nice warm up, and then Amy explains each exercise. She shows Level 1, which is the easiest, and is done by Aimee. Then she does Level 2, and her other assistant Sarah does Level 3. When I first started, I could only do Level 1, but I'm building my way up to Level 2. That doesn't mean that I can do Level 2 in every exercise, but I do attempt it, and if I can't make it, then I go down to Level 1.

What I like most about this DVD is that you don't need any weights or mats, just yourself. I also like that she warms me up pretty well before the intervals, because that is crucial. There are some sets that I really like (lunges with leaps), some that I'm ambivalent about (because really, 150 jumping jacks in four minutes isn't my cuppa), and there is one that I still can't complete (aka anything that requires me to go down into plank position). But despite my limitations, Amy keeps the energy up. I love that she's doing it with me, because I can see her sweat and become tired just like me, and it pushes me to keep going. I know she's a lot more fit than I am, but I'll catch up to her one day! Even thought I'm not fond of every exercise, I do like that she works every muscle group, and so I do everything I can. If it were left up to me, I'd never work my abs, because ouch. I often need the positive encouragement Amy gives.

The best thing about this workout, no lie, is the modifications. I came into this as an intermediate exerciser (I've been working out for a few months now), but I would be far too intimidated to try this if I didn't see multiple ways of doing the exercises. If I was a beginner, I'd probably run through the warm-up twice, and then just push through the DVD. Even if you can only do half of it your first time through, the point is to try. It is a major calorie burn DVD, and I use it about twice a week (especially on days when I want to eat out, since I know that I can stay within my calorie limit if I use this DVD).

Besides your health and your own fitness goals, what's not to love about Amy? I've been using her DVDs for the last two months and I don't know if I'd be where I am now if it wasn't for her. She'll encourage you through to the very end, and remember, the cool-down is just as important as the warm-up!",1309996800,9,2589,4.05078125
4506657,5,B004ZB92G8,"This may be the hardest cardio workout video I own. Since what one person's advanced workout is another person's warm-up, I will provide some perspective on my exercise level.  Since a naturally fast metabolism is not in my genes, I work hard to stay in shape because I know I gain weight extremely easily (I lost a lot of weight years ago and I work hard to maintain this).  I run 3-4 times a week, often incorporating sprint and hill runs.  I do an advanced level 1 hr bootcamp class twice a week (pull ups, hill runs, jump-ups, man-makers, etc) and I also do weight training.  I have a resting heart rate in the 40s (bpm).  I think I am pretty good shape.  I think this workout is really hard and effective and a major butt kicker.  This is a cardio junkie's dream workout.

This is a high intensity interval training (HIIT) workout based on the tabata protocol, which means you go full intensity cardio for 20 seconds and then rest for 10 seconds.  This is repeated 8 times per exercise interval.  There are eight intervals in this workout.  Between intervals, there is a short recovery period where you are performing a low intensity move while Amy runs through the next series of exercises.  For each interval, there are three levels of intensity (beginner, intermediate, advanced).  There are two other exercisers in addition to Amy who perform either the beginner of the advanced workout.  This workout requires no additional equipment (you use your own body).  Many of the exercises are high impact (with the exception of the beginner's level).  Amy is very personable instructor with a great you-can-do it attitude.

A break down of the workout:

Cool down.

All in all a great workout and one of the only tabata style workouts that I know of on the market (there is one in the supreme 90 day workout series and if you know of another one, please leave a comment!)  I was dripping sweat at the end.  Highly recommend.",1309651200,206,3756,4.777777777777778
4506658,5,B004ZB92G8,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

The good:  This was a tough workout that I will have to work up to.  I was able to finish the entire workout doing advanced or intermediate-advanced alternations.  High impact, high intensity, major sweat-fest, excellent workout.  Format of simple, tough, repeated moves works for me.  Instructor cues well, ""backup dancers"" non-annoying, good camera work.

The bad:  Instructor talks way too much.  It is a testament to her fitness level that she can talk almost continuously throughout but I would rather she limit it more to cues and counts or just rely more on the beat of the music (which I could hardly hear) to keep everyone in sync.  As always, wish all workout DVDs would come with ""cues and music only"" option.

I have improved enough that I have to modify moves on my own for many of my current workouts to make them tougher but this one left room for me to improve just as it is.  I gave this five stars because the pros of a solid, killer workout outweigh the cons.",1309478400,3,1034,4.590163934426229
4506659,5,B004ZB92G8,"No props, machines, or fancy fitness clothing...Amy Dixon gives you the real deal when it comes to working out. The results happen, but you gotta have the dedication and desire to work hard. Having a goal orientated coach like Amy Dixon to motivate you is only half the battle, when going breathless in terms of your exercise intensity. Showing up and being consistent will bring on the bodily changes.

I am blessed to train with Amy Dixon in her SUPERFIT BOD classes at Santa Monica Equinox, but due to my schedule being busier, I cannot always make it to the times she teaches. I am stoked that I just purchased her 2 new DVDs because, the awesome workouts you get from these DVDs, created by Amy is exactly what I would get in a live group exercise class. The best part is I can do these invigorating workouts anytime I want.

 When you complete a heart pumping interval tabata style cardio drill, the effort endured is so well worth it. Amy makes you feel rewarded, yet challenged throughout each of those 8 segments that really do burn a ton of calories in the Breathless Body DVD. Background exercisers, Aimee and Sarah, provide easy to follow modifications and advanced options so that all fitness levels can have the opportunity to work hard at their own pace. The energy and effort that all 3 women endure by working out together makes this challenging fitness class look like so much fun. And when you get to participate in any one of Amy Dixon's various fitness classes, you can't help but not have fun, while getting your total body transformed. Amy offers variations, motivation, and passion for a multitude of exercises that can impact a room full of people to smile while sweating. Now that is talent!
Buy any one of Amy Dixon's workout DVDs, they are a great investment for your heart's health! Go get ready to get sweaty, you won't be sorry.",1308700800,7,1859,4.627272727272727
4506660,5,B004ZB92G8,"WoW!  I absolutely LOVE this workout!  HIIT & Tabata workouts are proving to be excellent for fat burning and muscle retention, more so than steady state aerobics! This is one of the best workouts I've found for quick, super-effective fat burning.  I'm almost to the point of obsessed over it!  My husband and I work out together and he loves it too.  There's no embarrassing ""dancy"" cheerleading stuff to make HIM feel like an idiot.  It's all athletic moves.  There are 8 four minute Tabata cycles (20 seconds of intense work followed by 10 second rest repeated 8 times).  If you are working at your absolute max, just ONE cycle would be sufficient...but Amy Dixon provides 7 more!

We sometimes use the dvd for timing with Amy's encouragment to work hard while doing our own moves, such as jumps on and off a step, or plyo-lunges on the box (think Cathe).  It is so versatile, you can design your own Tabata style workout!  Amy has a good style (not annoying) and I would definitely buy more of her workouts like this one. The bottom line is if you are serious about fitness, willing to work HARD, and want the best, most effective cardio workout on the market, GET THIS DVD! I'm SO happy I did!!!

UPDATE 7/27: After ONE MONTH of doing this workout OR Cathe's HIIT three times a week and yoga on alternate days, I've seen more changes in my body and fitness level than doing 3 months of P90X (we just finished the program).  THE BONUS:  With P90X, I was working out over an hour each day.  With my current regime my workouts are done in 30-50 minutes and that is perfect for our busy life!!  Thank you Amy Dixon, make some more DVD's like this!",1307923200,77,1648,4.461538461538462
4506661,5,B004ZB92G8,"Love.  Love.  Love this workout!!  It's killer, don't get me wrong, but still...love.

As the other reviewers have mentioned, there just isn't another (at home)workout out there like this one.  I have done Turbo Fire, Insanity, I work out daily with Cathe Friedrich (love her, too, but that is a whole different review now!), yet I have found nothing quite like this.

This is a Tabata style workout.  You have 8 exercises that you will do 8 times in 20/10 intervals, with about a minute of active recovery in between.  For instance, the first exercise is some form of a jumping jack.  Background exerciser, Amy, does a standard jumping jack, Amy Dixon preforms at level 2 doing a power jack, Sarah (poor Sarah) is at level 3 with an Air Jack.  Now you do your intervals, 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 8 times.  As I said earlier, when you finish your 8 intervals you get about a minute (2?) to hydate and learn what the exercise will be.

Amy Dixon is straight-forward, motivating, encouraging, yet not over the top (oh, you know what I mean!).  She is working hard right along with you (something I enjoy).  I see myself making a few more purchases!

This workout is tough, but can be modified for anyone!

Try it, you'll like it!  :)",1306195200,44,1237,4.524886877828054
4506662,5,B004ZB92G8,"Amy Dixon's latest is unlike any other DVD currently on the market. I have taken the Tabata workout in person, and this approach -- 20 seconds of hard work followed by a 10 second break -- is one of the most effective and efficient ways to get lean in the least amount of time. You're able to go harder and get stronger faster, and rather than leaving you exhausted, this approach to cardio jacks up your metabolism and makes you feel fired up and ready to go. This is cross-training at its best! Who has time for hour-long slogs on the treadmill or hours in the weight room? This is a serious energy booster, and you will notice the difference straight away. Amy, as usual, is better than Jillian, better than Jackie or Jane or Kathy or anyone else who does home workout DVDs. This is a workout for people who are super fit, as well as for those who strive to be. It's a great DVD for people who are longing for something new in their workout program or exercise routine. Literally anyone can do it: I have an artificial leg and do all of Amy's workouts; they have changed my body. Added bonus: Amy is an incredible personality. She is kind, motivating, and strong. Her instructions are clear and easy-to-follow, and the best part about working out with Amy? You can tell her heart is in it, and she's right there doing the work alongside you. Gone are the annoying but typical motivations common to home workout programs (get skinny, fit into this or that swimsuit, etc.) The goal is simple: to strive for your best and fittest, healthiest self. The approach here is about fitness and health, about feeling good and looking even better. It's a refreshing approach to workout DVDs, a holistic, full-body understanding of the benefits of exercise. Truly a workout for the 21st century! It's about time!",1305849600,16,1802,4.58204334365325
4506663,5,B004ZB92G8,"Just completed Breathless Body for the first time--what a great workout! Totally different approach from any other workout I've done before. This style of workout uses 10 second breaks to help you recover between the 20 second intervals--don't think that these short breaks are a waste of time.  The intervals are all carefully planned out so that your heart goes on a bit of a roller coaster ride--best bet for jump starting your metabolism!  I love the three skill levels that are clearly shown and explained--always something to fall back to and work toward--and, how about the bionic woman doing the advanced moves the whole time? Inspiring. Loved the cool down music and Amy's cheerful, encouraging personality--feeling invigorated and ready for the day.",1305763200,4,759,5.162601626016261

The nice part is every exercise has three levels so on a bad day I do more of the lower level and on a good day I do the middle level.

While I enjoy the TabAta style , I prefer the 40 seconds on 20 off rather than 20/10. I find that doing each drill 8 times is really monotonous. I also hate the burpees and the donkey kick drills. They cause me to feel dizzy so I did another exercise instead.
Still, this is a id workout and I'll keep it in the the rotation. Amy's personality is motivating and I like her teaching style.",1467676800,,493,4.178947368421053

I still have pain but I wanted to get back to working out so I decided to try this DVD.  really like that this workout has three people doing different levels of the workout.  There is one that does more of a lower impact, another does a little higher impact, and the third person does the high impact.  I was able to get through the entire workout doing either level 1 or level 2 and sometime switching back and forth between those two levels.  This is a fun workout, I enjoyed doing it, and I got a really good workout.  I think the title of this DVD is perfect, because after doing this workout I was definitely Breathless.

My blood pressure is good. I just work out at work, during lunch and sloooooow times. And oh hot d@mn this workout will make you sweat. Which I take to mean it's working.

I want to do it more often but that's another tangent we won't go down.

That woman doing the ""difficult"" routine is amazing. If I could do what she's doing, and be like ten years younger I'd feel perfectly confident joining the marines, knowing I could carry a 200lb load miles. That's what it reads to me. Heck I bet Amy could be horseback riding and let's say her horse breaks a leg. She could carry it to the nearest vet. Or if she met Chun Li from Street Fighter, well she'd kick Chun Li's butt. And let's face it ""low intensity,"" she could do those things too. She's just very humble and willing to demonstrate a workout for us mere mortals.

So, Amy Dixon projects understanding, and she's clear and easy to follow. I am so thankful for the intensity level compadres and the great dvd navigation.

Each drill consists of eight 20-second sets of a particular exercise with 10 second rests in between. There are 3 different versions of each exercise - beginner, intermediate and advanced - but even the beginner is not easy. Case in point: when mountain climbers are the ""easiest"" of the 3 options, you know you're in for an ass-kicking workout. It's also comforting to see the people on the screen are sweating and breathing as hard as you. About 10 ,images after the workout,  felt like I might vomit...

4506683,5,B004ZB92G8,"This is one of the best exercise DVDs available if you want to work really hard and burn a lot of calories - all in less than 50 minutes.  I am always hesitant to try a new workout DVD because a bad workout can make you feel like you wasted your morning.  So I was nervous when I first tried this out.  But it definitely did not disappoint.  This workout is based on Tabata theory - you work REALLY hard for 20 seconds, and rest for 10.  You repeat this 8 times - for a total of 4 minutes.  Amy Dixon does 8 Tabata sets with about 2 minutes of rest in between each set.  The name of the DVD - Breathless Body - is spot on.  You will feel winded by the middle of each set.  Some sets include more difficult moves than others, and I think she does a great job of spreading the really difficult ones out.  One of the things I love about this workout is the simplicity.  You only have to learn 8 different moves (and she includes three different levels of difficulty for each, so beginners should jump on in - there's something for everyone).  Each move is very simple and you repeat each move 8 times, so you really know it by the time you are done.  The other thing I really like about this workout is that each set includes moves that are traditionally accepted athletic training movements.  She doesn't include any crazy aerobics moves.

One note I should add - some people complain of getting bored during this workout. It's a tough workout and there aren't many moves, so that's a valid complaint.  However, this is based on good exercise principles, so I would recommend pushing through on weeks when you're up for it.  That said, I stave off boredom by changing the first direction or first foot I use during each 20 second set.  It's not super creative, but it makes the time seem to go by faster.  I also change the direction I'm facing during the burpees.  I give myself 2 sets looking one way, then turn around and go the other.  That seems to help quite a bit.  I also change up some of the exercises.  Also, I recommend Amy's second DVD - Breathless Body: The Edge.  I get the same calorie burn, but I find that workout is easier to get through (mentally).  If I want to challenge myself, I pick out this DVD.  If I'm feeling less motivated, I always enjoy that workout.  Same calorie burn, so it just depends on how I'm feeling.  I do one to  two HIIT workouts a week, so sometimes I'll do both during the week.

I'm going to give a brief list of the moves in this DVD below and then add the number of calories I burned, according to my Garmin GPS heart rate monitor.  I should add that HRMs just give you an idea about calorie burn, but aren't necessarily accurate.  However, I use it as a gauge to see how one workout compares to another or how hard I'm working one week compared to the next.  Today I really pushed myself and burned 450 calories during this workout. I've had days I can't really get into it, and I'm looking at burning only 360 calories.  You will get out of this what you put in.  For those of you wondering how this measures up to other workouts: I burn roughly 420 calories in P90X's PlyoX if I push myself during all the rest periods.  That workout is an hour and this is only 50 minutes, So I think this is a tougher and more efficient workout than that one.  I burn nearly the same calories in this or in the second Breathless Body DVD, so I consider them interchangeable.  I've only done the third one a few times and I found it really difficult to get my heart rate up.  I will drag it out of retirement some time this month to review.  Also, use your arms - they make a huge difference.  For reference,  I am 33, female, and weigh 135 pounds.  In shape.

Here is the breakdown:

Warm up (I actually like the warmup for her second DVD better)
1. Jumping Jacks/Star Jacks - 50 Calories - the star jacks are deceivingly tough.  Also, she actually does 9 sets, which is an editing error.  I'll take it.
2. Speed Skaters - 49 Cal.  I modify this a bit as the actual skaters tend to hurt my back.
3. Burpees.  56 Cals.  Yes, folks.  That's TABATA BURPEES.  If you've never done a burpee, follow Aimee for level 1.  These are crazy tough.
4. High Knees.  52 Cals.  Great exercise - I cycle between Sarah at level 3 and Amy at level 2.  My hips don't like the level 3 eight times in a row.
5. Mountain Climbers/Donkey Kicks - 51 cals. Full disclosure - I cycle between jacks and the donkey kicks.  These are tough.  Probably the toughest of the 8, but Burpees may be just as tough or tougher. It's a tough call.
6. Jumping Lunges - 51 cals
7. Jumping Squats - 52 cals
8. a track drill, the name of which I cannot remember right now - 45 cals.
Cool Down/Stretch

That's the workout in a nutshell.  I really love this workout not only because Amy is really upbeat and not overly annoying, but also because I can easily do this workout anywhere any time with just a tabata timer on my cell phone.  Definitely try this one out.  It will be tough, but you can always switch levels.  If you are looking for a challenge, this is worth the purchase.",1426723200,7,5073,4.2306889352818375
4506684,5,B004ZB92G8,"Great workout with modifications, you do not have to be coordinated to do this workout.  Clear directions.  Tabata isn't for everyone because it is very repetitive, but she does a great job with this style of workout..",1426204800,,218,4.864864864864865
4506685,5,B004ZB92G8,I tried this for the first time last Monday and it really does make you Breathless and I was shocked that I got thru it!  I always have exercised so I guess I am in better shape than I thought and I will use this to lose  5lbs this month in preparation for spring. Some reviewers have said that it is boring but how can that be? I was so busy trying to say in the game to be bored.

4506687,3,B004ZB92G8,"I gave this a low review simply because It has you going to and from the floor so much I was more Breathless from vertigo than cardio. I know it's good to be able to get down and up quickly and get those burpees and mountian climbers done, but she doesn't let you catch your breath between sets,hence the title. Also, probably not the best video for a beginner or someone with joint problems either.",1425081600,4,399,4.333333333333333
4506688,5,B004ZB92G8,"So hard and so good!  It's really a mental challenge since you do one drill in each Tabata as opposed to four exercises repeated twice.  I think this is probably the hardest workout of this type that I own because of that.  I really do get breathless when I do this!  And I love Amy's personality.  She's really working hard with you.  And she's so down to earth while also being so damn pumped about working out!  I can't think of single reason not to try the most effective form of working out with an instructor that's so fun to have on the screen.  There are lower intensity options if you have knee problems or anything like that.  If you have wrist issues like I do, you may want to have a step or a chair handy for some of the drills that are based around planks - or you can do some other move that you know!  One of the great things about this workout is that it really doesn't matter what move you do - just do something all out for 20 seconds while Amy Dixon cheers you on.  Go for it!",1424908800,,996,4.082474226804123

4506692,5,B004ZB92G8,"I'm a former gym rat who works out at home these days mostly for time reasons. I enjoy the variety of workout dvds but I never feel like I get quite as much of a workout as I do at the gym where I feel absolutely shattered (in a good way) when I'm done. Breathless Body by Amy Dixon has changed that entirely.

This workout is INTENSE!!!! I'm a runner, a graduate of the Insanity Asylum, have done Turbo Fire, most Jillian Michaels DVDs (shout out to my favourite Banish Fat Boost Metabolism), have done several Cathe etc and this workout is harder than all of those. The strange thing is that it's very repetitive and seems easy and low key to start with. There are a total of 8 moves that you repeat 8 times each at high intensity with short periods of rest in between. Amy Dixon and her 2 assistants offer 3 levels of intensity total (beginner, intermediate and advanced) that you can choose from to complete the 8 repetitions. The moves are incredibly easy. No choreography to remember, no complex moves, just very basic one-exercise movements. So at first, it's easy to underestimate this workout and chose the highest-intensity level first. Ha! Do that at your peril. By the 8th rotation, I guarantee, if you're putting everything into it, you'll be ready to exhale a lung.

The way this workout is set up, I would say you'd need to be at an intermediate level of fitness to complete the whole video. In spite of the easyness of the movements, this is not really a beginner workout. Even though there's an assistant showing the ""easy""/""beginner"" version of the exercise moves, it's still by no means easy or beginner-friendly, particularly not for 8 rounds. Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred for example would be more appropriate for the more advanced beginner to intermediate exerciser looking for a challenge. Of course, because there are distinct exercises, you can choose to do only some of the moves and you certainly don't have to do the entire video. I consider myself an intermediate to advanced level exerciser and I tend to do the whole video which takes about an hour and according to my Polar hrm, I've burned up to 750 calories in that one hour pushing it and doing mostly the level 3 moves.

I highly recommend this DVD. If I need a huge calorie burn, this has become my go-to. You don't need any extra equipment, just you and your workout gear. The level 1 moves are mostly low-impact if that's a concern and they will still give you quite a workout because they are by no means easy. My only regret is that I got this on Instant Video, so I'm stuck watching it on my iPad for now. On the bright side, it's excellent for travel and since travel usually means I'm probably not eating very well, I DO need a bigger calorie burn. I'm looking into getting the other Breathless Body dvds so I can have Amy up on a big screen.

This is my first Amy Dixon workout ever and I'm impressed. She's not one for much talking as she's too busy working out. You're not going to learn a lot about her as a person and her family and motivations in this workout and she doesn't have any jokes, but it doesn't matter, we're all probably too breathless to notice and this is a serious, all out, to-the-wall cardio workout with no time for cuteness.",1417564800,3,3246,4.496610169491525

4506697,5,B004ZB92G8,"I've owned this workout DVD for a long time, and I finally pulled it out this summer and started using it. I wasn't doing a great job of keeping up with my workouts and wanted something new to add to my routine. I really like this DVD, and use it about once a week. I like to mix up my workouts throughout the week. I do Bikram yoga, circuit training with weights, pilates/ballet, and HiiT cardio. So I can't tell you that any results were solely a result of this DVD. However, this has quickly become my favorite Tabata workout. Other reviewers have given you the breakdown, so I will just share what I feel sets this DVD apart.

Highlights
*Amy does a really good job of reminding you to breathe. She emphasizes exhaling during the move, and you can even hear her breathe out when she is moving. Breathing in sync with the moves really helps your muscles (especially the abs!). A lot of pilates instructors will emphasize this, but most cardio instructors don't.
*Although there is only one video on the DVD, there are three different levels for each move. Each is demonstrated between sets, and you can move between the levels within your workout. For some moves, I'll do one set at the easy level, then a set at the medium level, and switch back and forth for all 8 sets.
*This is more than just a cardio workout. It will also give you legs a workout. Between the lunges and the squats, my legs are usually sore the next day.
*This video has a true warm-up and cool-down. Not only does the warm-up get my heart rate up, it also opens up tight spots by using moves similar to those that I will be doing in the video. No need to warm up on the elliptical!

Music: Has a beat, but nothing special. Not as much fun as a TurboJam DVD, but not annoying elevator music.
Instructor: I like Amy's approach. She does the moves with you, and consistently applauds your efforts and reminds you that you are ""almost there."" She does not have the extreme perkiness of Chalene Johnson, nor the hardcore-ness of Jillian Michaels. Overall, she is positive and hardworking.

**TIP for Beginners** - When I was just getting the hang of this DVD, I would do four sets of a move, then hit the ""Next"" button on my remote and go to the next move. It will take you to the next chapter, which starts at the rest period when Amy models the next move. By doing this, I was able to practice all the moves with about half the actual work. It helped me work up to doing the whole DVD, without having to quit halfway through. I still do this sometimes when I am pressed for time.",1410134400,10,2552,4.357142857142857
4506698,2,B004ZB92G8,"This workout is WAY too insane, even doing the easiest version of it.  I'll probably end up selling mine.",1408579200,,105,4.526315789473684
4506699,5,B004ZB92G8,"If your goal is to torch calories and drop pounds, definitely choose this workout dvd by Amy Dixon. This workout utilizes Tabata- which is basically a physical workout in interval drills. You do high-intensity activity for 20 seconds and then recover for 10 seconds.  There are 8 drills total in the dvd, and each of those 8 drills is performed 8 times-  (20 seconds of activity, followed by 10 seconds of rest). Some of the drills were new to me (ole lunges, core kicks, and pogo jumps) while others I was already familiar with- like power jacks, speed skaters, and athletic beach volleyball (which at an intermediate level is basically a burpee).

A very good aspect of this workout is that there are three levels given for each drill (beginning, intermediate and advanced)- so you can perform the workout at your level, and increase in difficulty as you progress. You can mix it up as you like- Some drills you'll be able to do at an advanced level, while others you can only do at an intermediate level. Or you can do 50%advanced and 50% intermediate for any given drill. Just do what you can, while always pushing yourself.

My advice is to pace yourself as you go through this workout. I intentionally don't give 110% at the beginning, because I want to be able to finish the workout.  Another piece of advice which many fitness professionals will give you is that form trumps quantity- meaning it is better to perform fewer repetitions in good form than to perform many repetitions with sloppy form. Get the form down first, and eventually the number of reps you do will increase.

I am a fan of Amy Dixon. She is an athlete herself, and in my opinion former athletes and competitors make some of the best fitness instructors. Her workouts really make me sweat, and I am getting to an advanced level, so finding a workout that challenges me is becoming more difficult.

Finally, just to compare this dvd to volume 2 (which I actually bought first). Volume 2 (Breathless Body: The Edge) is also a great workout. Follows a similar outline, except that your intervals of both activity and rest are a little bit longer).

I highly recommend Amy Dixon and this dvd, especially if weight loss and burning calories are your main goal.",1408406400,,2234,4.666666666666667
4506700,4,B004ZB92G8,"This is a hard core workout that will definitely make you sweat. Amy Dixon is sweating right there with you, and she is a great motivator. The drills are all modified for beginner, intermediate and advanced, which is great because you can switch it up throughout the drills. She is easy to follow and never annoying. The only reason I didn't give this DVD 5 stars is because the repetitions can get a little boring after doing the DVD many times. But sometimes I add my own variations to keep it interesting. Overall, this is a great workout that works lots of muscles.",1408233600,,569,4.533980582524272
4506701,5,B004ZB92G8,"I'm obsessed with this video. It's super challenging, yet still fun. I'm very fit and was worried it wouldn't be enough of a challenge - boy was I wrong.

4506703,4,B004ZB92G8,"This is based on Tabata style, you work hard for 20 seconds and then rest for 10 seconds (which seems like 2 seconds). It has 8 different drills that you do 8 times each. She has two others with her and each person does a different version. You pick which version to do based on your fitness level. The easiest version is mostly low impact (a few are high), I have bad knees so I do all low impact and I modify it to low impact if its not. I find it a little boring to do each drill 8 times, but it goes pretty quickly and is easy to follow, but challenging to do.  Amy Dixon is very upbeat and encouraging.",1407456000,,607,3.9754098360655736

It's fun and challenging and I can modify sequences as needed to limit the impact on my knees.  Tabata has helped me reach another step in my strength and endurance.  I always appreciate that Amy does a thorough warmup and stretch sequence as well.

4506708,3,B004ZB92G8,"I would have rated this lower since it didn't get my heart rate up much. The workout is good and I was able to keep up just fine, but all the stops frustrated me. I know it's a Tabata thing to go for twenty seconds and stop to rest completely for ten seconds, but I really didn't like that because it's not challenging for me.
The first time I did this workout was when I woke up in the morning before eating (something I normally don't do.) I was really disappointed in the workout. I was looking forward to trying it again for some reason. The studio is bright and clean, Amy Dixon is a lovely redhead who seems friendly, and the workout outfits were cute and motivating. (It's the small things.)
So I tried it again and ate an hour before, figuring maybe I'd been crabby the first time with no food in my stomach. Wrong. After a bit it was still too easy. I did a few of the advanced moves this time instead of intermediate, which helped, but some of them are really high impact and I have small wrists. Like I said, the workout is good, it's all the stopping that frustrates me. I guess I'm not a Tabata girl. I prefer HIIT where you haul butt for a minute and half or two minutes and then slow to a jog or less intense movements for thirty seconds to a minute, not stopping completely.
So what I did to make this workout more tailored to my needs was when they stopped for ten seconds, I kept going. I did this through most of the workout and only stopped during a few of the breaks to get water and catch my breath. Much better! I realize that makes it not Tabata, but it worked better for me. This was my first experience with Tabata, so lesson learned. I'd be willing to try another Tabata workout to see if different moves have a more intense effect, but overall I'm more of an HIIT girl.
That said, I have to give this DVD credit for presentation and also Amy as a trainer. She's in great shape. She's got muscles developed in her legs that your average person doesn't see. Something about this DVD made me want to try it again and with the modifications I made for me, it's a four star workout. I had to give it a three, though, since on its own it's not enough for me.
Please don't let my review discourage you from trying her other two DVDs in this series. Both The Edge and HIIT one are excellent. I want to do both those DVDS one more time before rating them so I can give a more detailed review of them, but they are both five star quality and among my favorite cardio DVDs. My face was rosy pink after doing them and I was hot and sweaty. She's a great trainer and delivers fantastic HIIT DVDs. Tabata just isn't my thing, but I had to try it to know that. Now I know. You might like it, though. Everybody is different.",1405814400,2,2736,4.173913043478261
4506709,4,B004ZB92G8,"I am a runner. I don't do weightlifting and I do not like to cross train much. I got this DVD because I was getting bored of the treadmill during one very cold and snowy winter. I thought this would be a good work out for the days that I want to take it easier and just get my heart to pumping. Man, was I wrong! This is NOT easy! I chose to do Amy's level of intensity and I was so out of breath and energy after 6 drills that there was not way I could do drills # 7 and # 8. I was furious and yet excited to commit to this challenge. After about 4 times of trying to do the whoe video, I managed to finish all drills after my fifth attempt. I bought two more Breathless Body videos shortly after, and I love every one of them. And I have developed stronger legs and core after doing at least two of these per week. If you are training to a half marathon or a marathon, or you simply want to run longer distances, this is a perfect cross training routine. Get it- you will not regret it! And for all guys out there that think they are tough and this is only for girls, well..... I would like to see you finish the entire video!",1405296000,4,1128,3.908695652173913

I was sore for days after using it but eventually my body got used to all the squats and jumps and isn't sore after using it. The workout is about 50 minutes but goes quickly.

4506712,5,B004ZB92G8,"I was curious why some people rated this 2 out of 5 stars and I saw the critics thought it was boring, redundant and repetitive. Someone mentioned they dreaded it. My response to that, for the sake of people considering the pros and cons of this and if it's worth a try is this: running is redundant, ellipticals are redundant, weight training is redundant...unfortunately, but they all deliver results. And it definitely depends on your preference I suppose. I found this to be not as redundant and boring as Insanity with Shaun T. (sorry Shaun T. lovers) and I found this to be not as repetitive to one muscle/joint group as Turbo Fire can become after time and time of doing it (Shoulders and elbows from punching/punching/punching). Compared to Insanity...the exercises are similar and the mental grit required to complete 8 sets of each and then quickly move right on the next exercise is similar, however I could ""stay in the game"" with this DVD (I drop like a fly somewhere in the midst of Insanity and find it hard to regain form and breath). I felt like I could not only work to my max., challenge my limits but also dial it back ***just enough*** to stay with it all the way through without burning out the muscles to where they were so jello, they wouldn't come back to life to finish the 60 min. workout. I am in average cardio shape and am just now beginning to develop muscle from beginning weight training 3x weekly, and this is a great challenge and I think it would work for Interval training/hiit workout that a well rounded fitness plan needs at any fitness level. I love the trainer too. She is pleasant yet motivating. A win!! Great purchase!! Good luck!",1403913600,6,1675,4.586666666666667

It's been years since I've actually ""worked out"" because I never had enough energy or stamina to do so, so I thought I would start off slow and try to build all of that back up again.  I like this DVD because there are three different levels that you can follow when you are doing the DVD.  The moves are pretty easy and their energy and the music they play is energetic.

I have a pretty intense 3-hour workout rotation that I do every day of the week, but I decided to switch it up by adding Breathless Body to see if it could take my workout up another notch -- and it certainly did.  This is a tough, athletic workout, with simple choreography (nothing too dance-like) so it isn't hard to follow right out of the gate.  Another plus is the instructor style; Amy Dixon is very high-energy and provides motivation without being derogatory, critical, or rude.  I also really appreciated the instruction in between the tabata drills when I first started doing this workout; however, I agree with another reviewer that it would be nice to have a way to bypass those instructions once you're used to the workout.  I tried this out as a rental but have decided to purchase it so I can make it a permanent part of my workout routine.",1399507200,,914,4.617283950617284

4506720,5,B004ZB92G8,"This is a tough workout. I was sweating and breathing hard the whole time. I was very proud of myself for completing the entire workout without stopping. I've been working out for a while and I have lost over 50 (and have to lose about 50 more) pounds. Recently, I've hit a plateau in my weightloss. I knew that I needed to challenge myself in order to break through the plateau. I had seen a preview for this video months ago and thought, ""Oh heck no, I can't do that"". I read the reviews here and actually found a site where I could watch the whole video before hand and decided that now was the time to try it. The goal is defintely to be breathless, so you have to push yourself past your comfort zone. There are low impact modifications if you are newer to working out. If you are an advanced exerciser there are modifications for that as well. This video is worth putting into your rotation. Amy Dixon is a great instructor she's encouraging with out being too annoying or overly chipper. She's sweating, breathless and working hard with you which really helps! I hightly recommend this workout, especially if you want a new challenge or if you have a plateau to break through.",1397347200,,1183,4.456221198156682

I like that. 2.) You can modify the moves when needed. I like the hard-core nature of this, but some days (or for folks maybe just starting out or coming back to exercise), an option to modify the moves is needed. 3.) It's a long workout (almost a full hour). You can always stop a DVD and cool down if you don't have the time, but when yiu want a longer workout it's nice to have that option. 4.) I have worked out in many forms for many years, and this was still challenging. 5.) You don't need a lot of space for this; a small room is good enough. 6.) There is variety enough so you don't get bored to tears. In summary, this is a fun, challenging workout that will make you sweat.",1394928000,2,856,4.162650602409639
4506722,5,B004ZB92G8,"I just did this workout for the 5th or 6th time today and finally made it through the entire thing. You do 8 different tabata drills, each lasting 4 minutes. All of the moves work the entire body and there are 3 different levels for each move, which is great because you can choose which level is right for you. This is my first Amy Dixon workout.

This allows a person to start out relatively unconditioned and continue to use this DVD as they build their conditioning over time.  So it's not a workout you are going to outgrow quickly.  It doesn't require any equipment, which is a positive, and doesn't require a tremendous amount of floorspace.  So you can do this easily at home in a small area in front of your TV.

Standard warning:  this is not really a beginner workout.  Like any true tabata workout, your heart rate is going to get close to your max.

The steps are VERY easy to follow and it is repetitious because it is Tabata-style. It's 55 minutes long but because it's repetitive, you don't really notice time pass by. You get a good workout based on the level of intensity that you put in. Her workout does not have a timer that you can monitor to know when to stop and start so you can't really put her on mute. But it's OK because she doesn't really sound annoying. I found it quite encouraging actually to hear her getting ""BREATHLESS"" too as she is doing the workout.

Pros:
1) Perfect, consistent cueing
2) EXCELLENT modifiers. I switched from the advanced versions, intermediate, and beginner all throughout. Beginners, you CAN do this!
3) Tabata is definitely worth trying. It's great to push yourself really hard, knowing that a break is only 10 seconds away.
4) No complicated moves!
5) The warm-up and cool-down were some of the best I've ever experienced and did not feel like a waste of time, as some others do.

In other words, it's worth the money!",1384041600,3,699,4.768595041322314

Each time, getting over the injury completely took a couple of weeks.  At the time I tried the video, I was in excellent physical condition and working out regularly (5-6x a week with weights and cardio, including a lot of lower-body work), so I don't think poor conditioning was to blame.  I do think the lack of stretching in the video contributed.

It is repetitive, as others have noted, but if you can stand the repetitiveness it probably would get you into pretty great shape.  I would advise stopping the tape and doing some serious glute stretching on your own in order to avoid injury, though.",1379894400,4,727,4.6484375

4506746,4,B004ZB92G8,"I have been doing Jillian Michael's DVD's, cardio and interval training, but wanted something fresh. This DVD sounded intriguing and I had done a short tabata series with another DVD.

What I loved was that not only did she show you modifications, you could really do your own thing too. If I can't do for one of them becsuse of achy knees for instance, level 2 or 3 but level 1 is too easy, heart rate isn't that high, I will do something similar that does work for me. Can't lunge, do jumping jacks...high knees...the idea is to be ""breathless"" and work hard.

Amy is very motivating and not overly chatty. There were DVD's I had to stop using because the constant chatter/stories got old. As challenging as it was the time flew by and I felt very tired but good at the end.

It also helped me lose a pound during a week of pizza and pasta dinners when I thought I might go up in weight. I love mixing it up and this DVD will defintely be in the rotation.

Amy is a wonderful motivator; she explains everything very well, offers support along the way, and consistently keeps you on time. I run several times a week in addition to HIIT workouts and weight training. This workout will never NOT be hard! With three different levels of drills (8 sets with 8 20 second reps with 10 seconds of rest in between), you can always adjust the difficulty level for yourself. Even when you become better and the drills become easier,  you will naturally go faster, making the workout challenging again. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone with any fitness level!",1377734400,,738,4.951612903225806
4506749,5,B004ZB92G8,"Just finished it and totally love it. This workout is a great addition to my every day workout collection (Jillian Michaels, Kathy Smith, Jackie Warner and many more) - this one is different though because it's an intense interval training (Tabata style) that takes me to my limits which is GREAT!!! The choreography is very easy to follow.

The workout consists of 8 moves that you do eight times each in 20 second intervals with 10 seconds breaks in between and a longer break between the different moves in order to catch your breath and calm down your heart rate.

This workout slightly reminds me of Beachbody's ""Insanity"" training which I did  more than a year ago - from ""Insanity"" I came out injured after I got through the 7 weeks because the daily intense jumping was too much stress on my feet. Therefore I'll do Amy's workout (which includes jumping, too) once a week (max twice) for a change.

I'd categorize this workout as
- cardio only interval training
- intermediate/advanced (for level 2 and 3)
- approx. 55 minutes

I'm going to order also Amy's ""breathless Body 2"" and can only highly recommend this one.",1376956800,,1125,4.690355329949239

You do this eight times, then move on to another exercise ( for example, skaters) and repeat the process. There are eight different sets. I only do 7 of them because I can't do the mountain climbers due to pinched nerve in my neck. There are three women in the video and each one does a different intensity level, low impact, medium impact and high intensity. You can choose which to do or even make your own modifications.

This does it!  There are 8 different exercises that you do in bursts.  The whole workout is about 40 mins.  Each exercise comes with the regular exercise, then an easier modification and a harder modification.  So, you can really tailor it to what YOU can do.  Some exercises, I could do the regular, and on some I had to do the easier mod.  And some days, I just don't have the time to do all 40 mins, so I can do 20 mins, and still get a pretty darn good workout!

Also, try Total Workout in 10.  Very scalable.  The ab ""bonus"" workout is what I do all the time on this one -- It's on the ball, and is WAY better than a zillion crunches on the floor.  If I have not done it in a week, I have sore abs for a couple days.  It also gets you to stretch your abs in a bunch of different ways.",1365033600,,963,3.917098445595855

I like the format of this workout, but my favorite part is Amy herself. She does the whole workout, and I really believe that she is feeling it. She might not be struggling quite as much as I am, but it's no breeze for her, and certainly not for the lady who's doing the advanced version the whole time!

I like that each move has three different levels, and I'm free to choose which level I'll follow for each move. Amy does a good job counting down the repetitions of each drill, and that countdown really helps me to believe I'll survive. The ten second rest periods are ridiculously short, but somehow they make it possible to carry on. So many of the other videos I've done are sculpting videos.

To give you an idea, I've run a few marathons (4 hrish) and always have a half marathon that I am training for. I was looking for a DVD that would break up my boring gym routine that do on my alternate running days. The ones I've purchased in the past were never very challenging. This DVD is very challenging and I find myself struggling to complete it. The good news is she offers 3 levels so when I'm really tired, I'll do level 2. Level 2 is still quite challenging and I will do level 3 if I'm feeling like a superstar. I like that it works different muscles while giving me a cardio workout as I never strength train because I find it too boring.

4506774,5,B004ZB92G8,"While I've never been a fan of workout videos and their constant annoying 'cheerleading', I was pleasantly suprised with Amy Dixon's Breathless Body Tabata-style workout. It's composed of 8 supersets, each superset consisting of 8 20second sets of exercise with a 10 second break in between. Was very happy to see that burpees were included! As a 6' 195lb male I burn about 600ish calories during the full workout (don't pause it you pansies!). Great buy.",1358985600,,455,5.0
4506775,5,B004ZB92G8,"Talk about being ""breathless!"" The title of this workout is no joke. For all those who consider themselves in ""excellent"" shape, be prepared for a humbling experience in which this Tabata workout will mercilessly challenge your heart rate to a new level! For all those who are in the beginning stages of working out, don't hesitate to give it a shot. Just do what you can and take as much rest as you need. This is a tough workout for ALL levels.

Basically, Amy Dixon engages you in an exercise (with modifiers) for 20 seconds, then allows you to rest for 10 seconds. This is repeated about 8 times, after which she moves onto another exercise that will be performed at the same interval. For those 20 seconds, your goal is to push yourself hard without holding back. You want to breathe hard, and you want to feel like you can't move a single muscle even if you were paid to.

If only there were more tabata-style DVD's (especially from Amy Dixon), I would have bought them all by now! An important note is that, despite the high intensity level of this workout, Amy always lets you know that you can do it. She pushes you just the right amount - not too soft and not too aggressive.

It's worth the copious sweat!",1358553600,,1216,4.443946188340807

With that said, I die every time I do this workout. I LOVE IT. It's fun, effective, and challenging. I saw the difference within the first week. It helped get me through my very stubborn plateau. Amy Dixon gives very good instruction on form, and is genuinely motivational without being obnoxious or annoying.",1357776000,,464,4.406976744186046
4506777,5,B004ZB92G8,"Amy Dixon is my favorite fitness instructor out there. I don't really have anything to add additionally to what all the others who sing her praises have said about her. I agree that she is NOT annoying, she is great at queuing, she is motivating, and she does the workouts along with you, which is inspiring. I like the fact that she is a real women with a natural skin color and a seemingly medically unaltered body.  She also has natural looking women in her videos and that really says a lot about her. She's not selling you an image, she's selling fitness.

That being said, this workout is no joke. It is challenging and not like anything else out there. It isn't dance based or heavily choreographed, but more sports centered. So, you don't have to take a long time learning the moves before you can jump right in. The video is about an hour long and consistes of 8 exercises that you do 8 times.  There are 3 levels of difficulty that you can switch back and forth on during your 8 reps. I love Tabata style workouts because you really do build your cardio endurance and burn a ton of calories. I typically burn around 500 calories with my heart rate monitor doing this workout. I'm so thankful that this workout is available. Keep them coming, Amy!",1357344000,3,1256,4.452173913043478

It contains very straightforward moves, nothing dancy or overly complicated, and it is very simple to modify the moves as needed for your fitness level. I can't see how anyone could do this video & claim it didn't give them a great cardio workout. I also like the instructor a lot, she was not irritating at all but not devoid of personality either. And I love how in between sets she is showing you each level so you have a few moments to decide your fate haha

I did this video for the first time today and basically alternated levels depending on my ability to perform whatever move it was, mostly I stayed in the level 2 range. Sometimes I would get ambitious and aim for level 3 but i'd always end up having to drop it down halfway through the sets because it was just too much for me to keep it up for a full 8 sets. One of the moves i had to level 1 it the whole time. The important thing is that there was ALWAYS a level that would get me huffing & puffing & dripping sweat. I actually felt a tiny bit nauseous afterwards so I maybe should have taken it down a notch more than i did, but wow! I got a great workout!

edit 2/8/13...i have kept this video in my rotation & performed it several times now, and i am in much better condition than when I started. I can keep up at level 3 throughout for a few moves but still need level 2 for a lot. It remains very challenging & I get a huge calorie burn every time i do it.

Everytime I do this workout Im not bored, Im sweating and huffing and puffing.  Its definitely a challenge but not something a person who really wants to change your body couldn't do.

  What I really like about this type of workout is that she offers you 3 different versions of one workout.  Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.  I often jump around from level to level depending on how I feel that day.

  I will be honest the first time I did it, I wasn't sure I would be able to do any of the Advanced moves or even some of the Intermediate moves but now I have moved up. After about a month (I do it about 2-3 times a week). Im able to do more of the moves with more ease.  Thats not to say they are easy.  Each time I finish I feel accomplished  and as cheesy as this sounds, Breathless.

 I do love the fact that she does all of the exercises with you and isn't annoying and peppy.  She is encouraging.  Im glad I bought this!!!

Fit and strong, no matter the body size is what is a healthier message for me.

I feel sweaty and cardio is done, ready for some weights when I do this workout. Hopefully I will be able to do more but I am recovering from Lyme disease so I need to be careful.

Amy is a good instructor. If you get it and you are in poor cardio shape,  take it easy!!!! Start slow and build up to more at your pace.

4506790,5,B004ZB92G8,"This was my first time buying an Amy Dixon DVD and also a Tabata Style DVD.  I have to say, I did this DVD 3 times already in a week and a half because it is exactly what I needed on my tough days.

Just a little background, I am a certified AFAA Group Exercise instructor and teach 4 classes a week (2 step/2 yoga)  On my ""off"" days, I usually work out to home DVD's (I have a library of over 100 fitness DVD's) or hike.

I like the convenience and versitility of exercise DVD's and can change my workout daily if I want or need.  Suffice it to say, if I repeat a DVD more than once or twice a week, I really love it and I love this one.

This DVD is not for the beginner exerciser.  Even though there are modifiers, I believe that to get to the ""breathless"" almost exhausted state safely, you have to be a regular exerciser for a few months at least.  That being said, if you work out and need an extra boost, this DVD is for you!  I completed the entire workout, varying between the intermediate and advanced levels (there are three levels given) and I felt it the next day.  I can count on one hand the number of DVD's that I own, that actually make me sweat at home.
The workout is only 45 minutes or so, but if you want to workout longer, just index it back to the last set of exercises.  Since the segments are broken down into the 20-10-8 rounds (20 seconds breathless, 10 seconds rest, 8 times) it is very easy to find the last set and add 4 minutes at a time to your workout, although, I bet you won't need it at first.
Some reviewers subtracted stars for Amy's ""chatter"", but for me, I needed the constant encouragement to finish.  Her letting me know there were only ""20 more seconds"" or ""we're half way through"", helps me to push hard--just to the end of that particular segment.  I LOVE IT!!  Will use it again and again.",1343520000,3,1835,4.132394366197183
4506791,5,B004ZB92G8,"This is a great cardio kick-butt video.  I really like the Tabata/HIIT method used.  Completing HIIT on a treadmill is very boring to me, so this video really gives more variations to that method.  I read that some people think only 8 exercises are boring, but it is so invigorating to actually complete the whole video.  I usually go through a whole bottle of water during this video.  I recently just received Breathless Body 2, this one really prepares you to complete that video.  I complete 4 of the exercises at the intermediate level and 4 at the beginning.  On Breathless Body 2, I can complete everything at the intermediate level.  This video and the second one are highly recommended.  Amy Dixon is my new favorite DVD trainer, she is not annoying and does all of the moves with you.  One other note, there are three levels to select from for every exercise.  Amy demonstrates the intermediate level and she has two other woman showing the beg. and advanced levels.  It is actually not distracting that each level is being performed at the same time.

I got what I wanted out of this video. Amy Dixon has a great presence, I found her to be inspiring and personable. I like that she keeps this video ""real"" by showing how much her and her models struggle with the moves and how they need to take breaks and they truly sweat - unlike some other videos where the instructor and the models look perfect without any sweat or grimacing. Although this exercise relies on repetition, I still found it to be fun and interesting. It is fun enough that the first night I did the video I wanted to do it again the following night. I mix it up between level 1 (the easiest) and level 2, I find the level 3 variations to be too difficult for me to keep up with. I don't sweat as much as Amy and her models but I guess overall I am not a big sweater. My heart rate is up the entire time and my legs are sore the next day. I am going to keep this video in my rotation and I expect to see results in improving my cardio and endurance. I would like more videos in this Tabata style.",1336867200,,1181,4.008474576271187
4506796,5,B004ZB92G8,"""Oh my goodness!"" exclaims Amy on finishing the third out of eight sets echoing what I had just thought seconds earlier.
Others have already written comprehensive reviews of this excellent product. I can confirm that this is certainly one of the hardest programs (and I have a few) I have found for pure cardio-vascular training and I love it. The difference between this one and say Bob Harper's ""Inside Out Cardio Burn"" is that this is pure cardio/body weight, where as Bob uses weights to give a semi- strength-endurance which is hard (you better believe it) but not in the total breathless way as Amy. As observed else where this program has eight sets of exercises (of which there are three variations of differing difficulty) which are 20 seconds long repeated eight times after a 10 second rest. Believe me the 20 seconds last forever and the 10 seconds flash by. That gives 32 minutes of exercise but actually with the active warm up (excellent) and the pre-sets instruction (which is also excellent with demonstrations whilst you are doing recovery movements) and cool down it takes about 50 minutes. The eight routines are well thought out testing most of your body and ordered for maximum effect. I love it because I have a separate routine for strength (again body weight/callisthenics) and use this DVD for pure cardio/sweat/getting breathless. In one week of doing this twice a week I had dropped my resting pulse from 58 to 50 beats a minute. So Amy certainly gives Bob and Jillian Michaels a good run for their money. Ultimately I'll be switching between them as its good to keep your body guessing and not get stuck in a rut. Meantime I'm tempted to see what else Amy has produced.
P.S. Yes, she does loose count on the first exercise and you do nine and not eight sets!",1336694400,2,1787,4.712460063897764

I do this one about 2-3x a week, sometimes breaking it up or doing the entire 60 mins all at one time. I used to dread pulling out this DVD because it really does punish you and you will work harder than you ever thought possible. But a funny thing happened a few weeks ago: I actually started to like pushing myself! Oh and seeing some results isn't bad either!

You have 8 cardio drills, you do each of those drills 8 times for 20 seconds and then rest/recovery for 10 seconds. I reccomend this to anyone! This video provides 3 different levels of intensity.

4506799,5,B004ZB92G8,"A little background on my perspective. I am an intermediate level exerciser, who has only really gotten into fitness DVDS in the last 4 months or so. I usually use Jillian Michael's NMTZ, BFBM, Bob harper's cardio rev, other Jillian Michaels etc and run. I work out about 6 times a week.

I really like this workout. I find it's simple, there are modifications and you get out of it what you put into it. I do mostly the highest level version. I find its fun to challenge yourself to do more and push harder every time you do it. I find Amy Dixon has a personable manner and is encouraging.

The first time I did it, I thought... hmmm maybe it is repetitious and  has the dread factor... but it's just a matter of making it into a game... do more every time and have fun with it. And I really feel it the next day. I do it once or twice a week. It does have lots of jumps, so I can only do it when the neighbors are out.

One con I find surprising noone has mentioned. In the first drill  there's an extra set. Instead of 8 repetitions, there are 9! I find this a little cruel as that first drill if you're doing the full jumps is tough and to do set 4 - she says do this you're over the hump and then the next set... Ok, now we're on set 4.... groan....... I think maybe they edited it a bit quickly. Also on the menu... Athletic is mispelled as atheltic.... Or maybe i was just sent a bad version...

But extra set and spelling issues aside.. it's a great workout with a good instructor. It'll get your heart rate up, and make you sweat but I think it works best for people who really want to push themselves.",1334707200,,1611,4.098412698412698

The work out is hard. And because you are repeating only 8 exercises, 1 at a time, it is very boring.  Not what you want in a strenuous workout.  You want the time to fly.

I know Amy Dixon has her supporters, but I really do not like the constant narration.  It's too shrill and distracting for me.  Does not inspire or motivate.  I prefer instructors who let the workouts speak for themselves.",1334448000,5,562,4.336538461538462

In Breathless Body there are 8 blocks of high intensity workouts that challenge you from start to finish with 3 options of difficulty.  I love that Amy does the workout right there with you and struggles through it with you.  She acknowledges when its getting tough and helps get you through it.  Unlike in the Jillian Michaels videos where she stops and instructs but doesnt actually finish the excercises with you.  This is an awesome workout because if you don't have time to do the whole dvd you can just select a few drills to do and still walk away sweaty in just ten minutes.  The music it great too, it isn't that annoying fitness-esque music you find in alot of workout dvds. In addition, I love that YOU DONT NEED ANY EQUIPMENT!( I would just reccomend a carpet-less surface).

In the DVD there are 3 levels of exercise intensity- beginner, intermediate and advanced and these 3 levels are very well demonstrated by 2 other exercisers. All of these women have great form and maintain it throughout the exercises- wonderful.
Amy makes it easy to get your calorie burn without having to struggle to follow along. the moves are easy enough to catch on to and she is very motivating without being over the top. It is also good to see that she is sweating right along with you.

4506806,5,B004ZB92G8,"I'm at a fairly high level of fitness: running, spinning, yoga, Turbo Fire from beachbody, etc. I had to take a break from running and kickboxing due to a calf strain and came across this dvd as a cardio alternative. I do HIIT training with Turbo Fire and running intervals and love them, and I found this to be just as awesome! I was truly breathless after the first drill. First time I did it I tried Level 3 because I'm used to air jacks with Turbo Fire. By the 8th round, I was spent. I mainly stick with Level 2 and find myself breathless and sweating profusely. The kickboxing drill is too easy at Level 2, so I switch out between Levels 3 and 2. I don't personally like the ""butt kick,"" so I do a vigorous mountain climber on that one. My balance suffers during the pogo jump (last drill), but I hope to improve. All in all, I think this is a solid workout and one that I enjoy. I don't get bored with it as a couple of others posted; to me it moves along very quickly because you have mini goals to accomplish. One note about the low impact level: I realized after doing this a couple of times that the jumping jacks and mountain climbers were aggravating my calf straing, so I took it down a level. I didn't personally find that level challenging, but I think for beginners, it definitely would be. My only real negative comment is that the stretching was not enough. After the first time through, my hips and outer glutes were abnormally sore for days, so much so that I couldn't do the full range of motion on the skaters or pogo jumps a full week later. I realized that it was that I'm not used to that deep a movement and needed deep stretching, which I started doing during the cool downs in between drills. A deep runner's lunge (deeper than she does, which is really Warrior One from yoga) will help with that.",1333584000,,1826,4.280346820809249

If you do the whole thing you are getting one heck of a cardio blast...I only did the whole dvd once.  Now I use one or two segments on my weight training days just to get some quick calorie-blasting cardio as an add-on.  The dvd menu makes it easy to select the segments that you want.,1333324800,,491,4.191489361702128

Basically you do 1 exercise 8 times in the 20/10 fashion and there are 8 exercises.  This is my 1st Amy Dixon DVD and I really like her.  She is very straight forward, doesn't talk down, doesn't seem conceded, or isn't a drill sergeant.

This video kicks my butt.  Amy gives you three levels to choose from for each move, and I usually do level 2.  Some moves I can do a couple at level 3, and some I have to do a couple at level 1.  I can't imagine doing the whole thing at level 3, I would probably collapse.

4506811,5,B004ZB92G8,"I bought this DVD because I saw it advertised as an advanced workout in ""Fitness"" magazine. I would say it delivers as promised. I have been a big fan of beachbody products (especially Insanity and ChaLEAN Extreme). This workout is in the same range as a first month Insanity workout or the ChaLEAN Extreme ""Burn it Off."" Without the insanity groundwork, I think I would have found this workout over the top. It would be a good workout to substitute into those programs for variety. A few of the tabata drills were quite intense (e.g., the squat thrusts), especially if you did them at Level 3. I did the Level 1 mountain climbers rather than the ""donkey kicks, for example, because the donkey kick types moves seem to put a lot of pressure on my neck and shoulders but that is a personal limitation of mine. At about 56 minutes from start to finish this is a long workout. The actual tabata sections is 8 drills, done 8 times each, for 20 seconds on and 10 seconds rest. That adds up to only 32 minutes. The other 24 minutes comes from the warm up and cool down and some relatively simple, fairly low intensity recovery moves such as side steps. I wish there were a few more minutes of warm up (especially some stretching). I found the cueing to be good. There is no clock on the screen but Amy counts pretty consistently and gives you a 10 second and/or 5 second warning to help give you the drive to finish a section. Amy herself does the middle level of difficulty, maybe because she needs to talk through the whole workout, and she does the workout too. I feel sorry for Sarah (the girl who does the highest level) as some of the moves (like the first tabata drill that is jumping jacks at the low level and leaping into the air jumping jacks at the highest level) are quite intense, especially if you can't take a break because you know you might be on camera. At about 15 dollars, this video isn't too expensive. Since there is only one workout it might get repetitive after a while. But it is much cheaper than buying a beachbody type program that offers more routines but might cost ten times as much.",1329955200,4,2110,4.412820512820513

She's not cutesy, mugging for the camera, or making you feel bad. She's super encouraging while acknowledging how #$%^ hard this video is! Because of the 3 levels you can work at your own difficulty level. I think it'd be impossible to ever find this too easy. Because it's not choreographed, it's the only video my husband's ever agreed to do with me, and it kicks his butt too. My only complaint, and it's small, is that while it IS a whole body workout I'd like it to spend a bit more time on upper body. I drink 2 bottles of water during it..that's how intense it is.",1325376000,5,748,4.388489208633094

4506815,5,B004ZB92G8,"I really love this workout! I wish I could give it 6 stars! It truly is the ultimate cardio workout. Even though I am slim, I'm genetically prone to developing a belly. So for several months I began to jog, swim and bought several of Jillian Michaels's videos (which I love) and they really built up my endurance and stamina. So when I came across this DVD on Amazon and read the rave reviews I decided to buy it and oh boy it didn't disappoint. It's for anyone who's hit a plateau and/or want to seriously challenge themselves and/or shed fat. It's a tough workout but there are modifications for beginners.

I've never heard of Tabata HIIT (high intensity interval training) before and I must say it seriously challenged me aerobically. Tabata HIIT is designed to torch a massive amount of calories without compromising your muscle mass. The format is this: You perform a specific exercise for 20 seconds as intensely as you can and then rest for 10 secionds and then you repeat it 8 times. Believe me, those 10 seconds will feel like a split second. You can't even catch your breath because before you know it the 10 seconds are over and you're repeating the same drill again. According to studies done by Tabata and his team, HIIT burns calories long after you've finished your workout and spikes your metabolic rate up to 24 hours, as opposed to lower intensity cardio which is why its a great workout if you're looking to lose weight. What I like about this DVD is that I don't find it boring since you mentally focus so much on pushing your body to finishing the 20 seconds of intense exercise. When I tried it for the very first time with a friend who's a seasoned jogger and is in pretty good shape, her and I were both soo incredibly sore (the good kind) the following day. We felt it in our hamstrings, quads, shoulders and especially our glutes! Prior to trying this workout DVD, I thought Banish fat, Boost metabolism by Jillian Michaels was a killer cardio workout, but after trying Breathless Body I find it way tougher and challenging! I highly recommend this workout DVD and Amy Dixon and her assistants are great! I wish there were more workout DVDs based on this type of program.",1324512000,5,2198,4.564556962025317

I do like that it offers three various methods for doing the routine so that it can be adjusted to your own level of challenge. I tried this DVD three times but it did not interest me enough to want to do it again. Not to mention, after the first time I used the DVD I began to encounter issues with it stopping a few times midway through some of the exercises.

It's the hardest cardio DVD I've ever done and am usually sweating buckets by the time it's over with my face the color of a tomato. What's great is there are three different levels of each drill so that you can adjust to your ability level and switch it up during the drill. Usually I go with the hardest or middle level of exercises but this workout had me so out of breath I had to alternate between the easiest and middle levels. Amy's cues are perfect and she gives you plenty of time to see the different exercise levels before you start the moves. It's a great workout for those already working out at least a couple times per week. If you're new to working out or coming back from a hiatus, be prepared to have to pause the DVD to catch your breath and not hurt yourself!

NOT a ""beginner"" level workout, but it is challenging and exciting!

4506825,5,B004ZB92G8,"First, a disclaimer: When I found this DVD, I was already familiar with the Tabata protocol from taking classes at Equinox clubs in Chicago, so luckily I knew what to expect in terms of format, intensity, etc.  That said, I am awarding the first two stars for the mere fact that this DVD exists at all - Tabata is a tough workout - even at the gym we only go for 45 minutes, this workout is an hour and adds at least 3 intervals to what I've been doing in live classes.  Go Amy! That said, you CAN do this workout (yes you can!) - there is no need for fear or dread factor.  Amy gives some advice at the beginning that can't be over-emphasized: go at your own pace, mix up the levels if necessary (this single piece of advice alone can get you through the entire thing), and if you're not feeling it, SKIP that interval.  Now, that's obviously harder to do in a live class situation and not my favorite option (read: I'm stubborn!), so I made use of ""mixing up the levels"" a lot.  One Tabata Interval contains 8 sets total: you can do the first 2 at Level 1; try Level 2 for the next 2 or 3; recover for 1 at level 1; and then push yourself again at the end.  Of course, you can adjust the ramping up and recovery, the point is that mixing it up is a very good way to improve your endurance - and it will improve!  Also, if you feel like something is just not working, pick the level you like and stay there.  A good example of this for me was the ""Mountain Climber"" series.  Mountain Climbers are tough - even at the first level.  I watched the Butt Kickers (Level 2) and the Level 3 option and decided that, at least the first time through, I'd stick with level 1 and adjust the speed if I felt up to it - and that was plenty.  My final piece of Tabata advice: my favorite live instructor always reminds us that ""The last 2 sets are purely about mental toughness!""  You'll be exhausted, breathless and ready to quit, but push yourself for just 2 more sets and you'll start to see some fabulous results. Good Luck!",1317254400,14,2015,4.164948453608248

I don't have time for that, and this is a little better on my knees.  I like Amy Dixon because she is encouraging without being annoying, although she does say ""make it happen"" about drying off with a towel!  It cracks me up.

This one however is something completely different to what I had experienced before!! This workout is a killer, but only if you want it to be!!  There are 3 different levels of intensity for each move and you can mix it up to suit your energy levels on the day or fitness levels and capabilities.  I do something different every time I put on the workout and each time I find myself going ""breathless"" and getting maximum results!  The tabata drills keep you moving without feeling like it will never end and the recovery periods are just enough to keep you in the game.

4506832,5,B004ZB92G8,"I was familiar with Amy Dixon from her previous Women's Health magazine DVDs. I liked those DVDs a lot and used them quite frequently, but I wanted to up the intensity a little so I moved onto Jillian Michaels' and Jackie Warner's DVDs. I happened to come upon this workout b/c I reached a plateau and wanted something different.

This workout is UNBELIEVABLE! You will be tired, you will be sweaty and you will be sore! Amy takes the Tabata method--sorry I knew nothing about this method but after doing this DVD, I will do some research on it--and uses it for a good, solid 50 minute workout. Your heart will be pumping and you may think your legs will fall off. But believe me, it is all good.

Amy takes 8 intervals of cardio moves, and does 20 second spurts followed by 10 seconds of rest. Sounds pretty easy right? Wrong!! By the 2nd or 3rd interval, you will be gargling your heart--in a good way of course. The great thing about this DVD beside the insane workout, is that Amy gives you options. She is backed by 2 other women. The first does the level one lower impact move. Amy does the level 2 intermediate move, and the last girl does the level 3 advanced move. Amy says you can choose whatever level you can handle, which is great because if you can't do as much, there's no need to stop, just drop down a level and you will still get a great workout. She also says that if the recovery period of 10 seconds is not enough, pause and take a minute to get back into it. No pressure, and she doesn't make you feel weak if you choose this option.

I found myself solidly on level two and keeping up with Amy pretty well. When I got ambitious, I would try level 3 for a spurt of two but if I felt it was too much I went back down to level two. For the tougher intervals, I alternated between level 1 and level 2. So it's great that you can do whatever level you are feeling up to that day, and not miss out.

After the workout I was dripping and my butt, legs and arms were so sore! I can only imagine how I am going to feel tomorrow!! Another reviewer didn't give this a very good review and said it has a ""dread factor"" and I can see that. But I think that this motivates me to want to do this and get better and maybe working up to a level three move here and there. (Oh, God. Just thinking about that makes me hurt.) That's what makes a good workout DVD in my opinion: you can start out and improve or take it easier, whatever you like, but you never lose your edge.

This was an awesome workout. When I finished I was so proud of myself. I felt the same sense of accomplishment and exhilaration that I feel after I do my 4 mile run!!

I also ordered another one of Amy's DVDs, Give Me 10 More (a more strength training based workout), which I will review after I try it out. If I like that one as well, then I am going to alternate these two DVDs during my workout days of the week.

I personally like Body 3 better than this DVD, thus why I am giving it a slightly lower rating, however I am a fan of this video and Amy Dixon does a nice job with encouragement and explaining the drills.  The main reason I like Body 3 better is I personally like the longer Tabata segments (40 seconds on with 20 seconds rest rather than this Video which is 20 seconds with a 10 second rest).  I felt the longer segments provided a bit more of a challenge and at least it felt like to me a little harder workout.  Body 3 also has an Ab segment at the end as well as a cool down stretch; I wish this video would provide stretching at the beginning and end.  As others have commented, there are 3 Levels of intensity, so a beginner could do this video, I followed Level 3 throughout and would compare doing Amy Dixon's video at Level 3 is a nice mix-up and addition to my daily Insanity workouts.
