Recording engineers and technicians still make the difference, given the BEST format. This is one of the ULTIMATE FEW.",1401667200,13,233,4.9743589743589745

5750736,5,B00CX7EK7M,"On the whole I enjoyed it very much,specialy Aaron Copland ( saving private Ryan !! ),Tchaikovsky,etc... Evidently like many reviewers commented, Anne Sophie Mutter is incredibly marvelous.
The coral fantasy disturbed me a bit the first time I heard it because of the slow tempi chosen by Peter Serkin ( hear his father Rudolf Serkin on CD ) but after vrios listenings,I got to like it very much. Like I said this blu ray deserves 5 stars. I cannot fail to add that the quality of the sound and image is very very good,even for a blu ray.",1379721600,15,538,4.5

5750740,5,B00CX7EK7M,"This was the last filmed concert to be shown on PBS' summer arts festival from 2012 and it was well worth the wait.  Tangelwood managed to gather some giants for this one:  Emmanual Ax, Yo Yo Ma, Anne-Sophie Mutter, James Taylor, Keith Lockhart, and several more.  Many of these performers were here for a week giving several concerts and master classes as well as treating over 20000 concert goers to outdoor humidity endured exceptional performances in the Berkshires of Western Massachusetts.  It must have been a dream come true for the students that make up the accompanying orchestra to be led by these famous conductors and taught by these great musicians. Yo Yo Ma is seen in performance and rehearsal with the young students he will play with and he is very generous and encouraging.  Virtuosos do not always make the best teachers and some can be down right snobs.  But not Yo Yo Ma.  He is very welcoming and enthusiastic about all styles of music and totally unpretentious.  James Taylor is still great to listen to, even though the only pop musician there, he fit right in.  Fantastic performances from everyone but by far and wide the show stopper had to be  Anne-Sophie Mutter.  Performing the virtuosic flashy Sarasate Carmen Fantasy,  Mutter proved why she is considered the best violinist in the world.  The Carmen Fantasy is a great piece to really show off your musicianship, dexterity and skills and play at lightning fast speeds.  Mutter played with amazing passion and so fast that if you blinked you would have missed it!  The last few bars are so exciting the audience erupted in cheers as if at a soccer match and gave her a well deserved  standing ovation.  And there must have been at least 15000 people sitting on the grass, which is a huge audience for a classical musician.  You could tell Mutter really enjoys playing this and still has it at a young 50 years old!  If you ever get the chance to see her live (I have seen her 4 times) she is totally worth it.  Until then enjoy this performance from Tanglewood, you will be spiritually transformed.",1376352000,34,2080,4.693370165745856

8587145,5,B00CX7EK7M,"This Blu-ray disc is clearly a disc of exceptional import for followers of the Tanglewood series of concerts now reaching back a full 75 years. These open-air events have been very well captured both sonically and visually and feature three orchestras, a number of conductors and soloists of repute. The program on this disc could be described as Tanglewood highlights in terms of choice and all are delivered with the skill and sympathy that all potential purchasers would expect based on previous experience.

The concert starts in spectacular fashion with a sonically wide-ranging delivery of that American statement, the Fanfare for the Common man taken from the start of the final movement of Coplands third symphony. The Bernstein dance episodes from On the Town make for an enjoyable continuation of the American theme and that focus is concluded with James Taylors rendition of songs from the Great American Songbook. That completes the contribution from the Boston Pops Orchestra.

The next pieces feature the student orchestra of the Tanglewood Music Centre Orchestra for which no musical or technical apology needs to be made. The absolute highlight of this section must be the Andante cantabile for solo cello and orchestra by Tchaikovsky. YoY o Ma leads a performance of extraordinary subtlety on every level and this could arguably be chosen as the musical highlight of the disc.

The final two movements of Haydns D major concerto, though fine, do not match YoY o Mas performance and neither does Anne-Sophie Mutters performance of the Sarasate Carmen Fantasy. This is played with considerable romantic emphasis and mostly slow tempi which rob the music of its essential rawness and energy (Bizets intention), as well as humour at death-defying virtuosic pace as a display piece (Sarasates intention). Essentially, although technically note perfect, Mutter unfortunately seems temperamentally unsuited to this type of repertoire.  For that there are exhilarating versions by Sarah Chang and Gill Shaham on DVD as well as Perlman on CD which really demonstrate what is missing here.

The disc concludes with the return of most of the Boston Pops Orchestra plus others in the form of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  The first of the two concluding items is Ravels La Valse directed by the ever cheerful Andris Nelsons who makes a point of searching out and extracting every expressive detail imaginable in a more varied approach to tempi than usual. This rises well and convincingly to climatic moments despite the widely varied tempo fluctuations.

The final item, and also the longest, is the Choral Fantasy by Beethoven featuring Peter Serkin on piano, an extended solo introduction for this piece, and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus which possesses an attractively youthful vocal timbre which ideally suits the work. David Zinman directs a typically no-nonsense performance which is completely consistent with his best-selling recordings of Beethoven and Schumann amongst other equivalent repertoire. This brings a finely recorded and enjoyable disc to an appropriately celebratory end.

This is an enjoyable disc which delivers a rewarding and celebratory souvenir of an important American musical institution.",1451347200,4,3228,5.365612648221344
