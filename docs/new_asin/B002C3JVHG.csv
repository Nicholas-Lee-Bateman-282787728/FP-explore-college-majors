Even if I dislike some facial expressions in the firsts episodes, this is still a classic in Anime culture.",1403136000,,215,4.657894736842105
8363035,1,B002C3JVHG,"If you're looking at a new copy of Evangelion (especially from outside the US, it is 99% a bootleg on here. The show has been out of print for years. There is no such thing as a 7 disc platinum version. All they're shipping is pirated copies off the show that you can download off the internet, burning, them to disc, printing out some artwork, and throwing it all in a case and shipping it to you. I am ESPECIALLY talking about this new listing on here with ""Edition Gold"" and the random D thrown throughout. Do not buy this, wait for a re-release in the coming years.",1392163200,26,569,4.277777777777778
