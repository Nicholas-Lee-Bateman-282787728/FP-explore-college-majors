Look for a different film.",1148774400,,290,4.471698113207547
8179648,3,B000067IWN,"Unfortunately this movie was not what it suppose to be.  According to the plot, it was one brother trying to find and kill his other brother, after being caught attempting to rape is sister in law.  However, this movie was quite different,,it turned out to be some killer cop, hunting down some gold robbers,,chopping there heads off one at a time. However, don't get me wrong, I'm not into swords play, but this was not bad, especially the final 5 mins. I just like to get what I buy seen!!!",1145318400,,492,4.455555555555556
8179649,5,B000067IWN,So what if this DVD is about sword fighting... some people like sword fighting.,1111017600,4,79,4.714285714285714
8179650,1,B000067IWN,This movie does not have any kung-fu fighting!!  Its all about sword fighting.  If you're looking for real shaolin type kung-fu I suggest you look elsewhere. This is NOT kung-fu.  I could only muster watching about three-quarters of the movie.  Take my advice and don't waste your money on this crap.  I guess you pay for what you get.,1080518400,2,335,4.610169491525424
