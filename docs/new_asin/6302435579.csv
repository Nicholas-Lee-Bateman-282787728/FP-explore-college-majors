Thanks to a couple of wonderful browser plug-ins (Netflix Queue Sorter for Firefox and Netflix Sorter for Torch), I have the ability to sort my Netflix Instant Streaming queue by average rating. Which I do once a week if I've added anything to it. I usually have a perverse urge to watch, on my Tuesday work-from-home all-movie days, at least one movie from the bottom five in my queue, something that, basically, all of Netflix loathes. Last week's was Strippers vs. Werewolves, and I have to say I thought the masses were wrong, wrong, wrong about that one. Today's was the very bottom movie on the queue, The Sculptress, which is presently floating around Netflix-land under the title The Demon Within. It's not quite as bad as the movie that was at the bottom of the heap two weeks ago, before I watched that one (the ridiculous Fading of the Cries), but man, it did its best to get there. This is a movie so bad I don't even know where to begin telling you about its badness, so I'm going to quit typing, to to bed, and see if I can come up with some new words for ""suck"" while I'm sleeping tonight.

Plot: the titular sculptress, Sarah (Idle Hands' Katie Wright in her final, to date, feature appearance), is a British student who has just transferred to a prestigious art school in San Francisco. She spends her first few weeks flat-hunting before landing a room in a building also inhabited by Matthew Dobie (The Lawnmower Man's Jeff Fahey), a seemingly out-of-work Shakespearean actor (you find out why he's always out of work pretty early on) who moonlights as a serial killer. She also draws the attention of hunky classmate Chris (Crosscut's Allen Cutler), a possible romantic interest, and obsessive professor Giraud (Panic Room's Patrick Bauchau), who is the first to notice that something is very amiss with Sarah--some of her work is very, very different from the rest of it (and, Giraud tells us, every sculptor's style is as individual as a fingerprint, so this doesn't make one bit of sense). She soon finds out, with the help of Giraud and psychic Madame Cleo (Rent's Vivis Colombetti), that she is a pawn in a demonic game much, much larger than any of its participants...

It wouldn't surprise me if there were a pretty good script somewhere in the draft stages before this movie started filming. There are some fine ideas at the bottom of this, but they were all strangled by the time they reached the screen, by everything from Merrick (The Black Panther)'s questionable choices of camera angle at least once every five minutes to Jeff Fahey's hilarious (unintentionally, one assumes) overacting. And what we ended up with is just awful. *",1368921600,,2699,4.738297872340426
7825875,4,6302435579,this has got to be one of the weirdest movies ever!  i think other people did not watch the entire movie because they were looking for something else i say weird but it is an interesting film plenty of wacos and crazy stuff give this film a chance i am sure you will like it  i found this vhs version in the trash where i live with several others i checked out the title on the box and the picture i am a sucker for this stuff and since i paid no money for it i was quite pleased with what i saw not a great film but who cares?,1334102400,,527,3.7818181818181817
7825876,1,6302435579,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I kept watching it hoping, thinking that the scares were only a scene away, they never came. If you could die from boredom, I would be. Save yourself the pain of death-by-boredom, and pass this one up.",1117670400,3,243,4.304347826086956
7825877,2,6302435579,"Writer/director Ian Merrick's DEMON WITHIN is full of such gaping plot holes and inconsistent motivations that it ends up being nothing more than a mishmash of derivative horror cliches.  Jeff Fahey, usually a sturdy presence in films, is outrageously awful in the role of Matthew Dobie, who has obviously been both a priest and a stage actor of ""great"" renown?  Katie Wright as our heroine, Sarah, seems to be psychic as she manages to create busts of the murder victims.  And somewhere out of the clear blue sky, her professor (Patrick Bauchau) decides she's the target of an Incubus..and his enlightenment comes from a crossword puzzle.  Where did he even consider this?  The one good thing is the musical score, which combines techno pop with choral vocals reminiscent of THE OMEN.  But, that's it....this is coherent, ultimately boring and an ending that comes as a total downer.",1075852800,,884,4.979591836734694
7825878,1,6302435579,"I guess I'll start positive, this movie was decently filmed and the acting was acceptable... okay, I'm done there at being positive!! This movie was so boring it's obscene! I guess it could cater to the fans of the ""Poison Ivy"" genre, but this movie had no horror, no suspense, no thrills... this movie might have made it as 2 separate stories; the demented cross-dresser/ costume freak-----and the mentally-unstable student with an attraction to MUCH older men... but intertwined as one story; this movie, despite its interesting end,came up dry...real dry (interpretation: BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!)",1055289600,2,594,5.397849462365591
