3527721,5,B001D8W7JA,Is this movie about a marriage proposal or some other type?  One might be surprised after viewing the movie.  Characters in the film are equally surprised as events unfold which makes this a movie to enjoy by young and old alike.  Arnold plays his usual wonderful self in yet another Christmas feature.,1261180800,13,302,4.769230769230769

3527728,2,B001D8W7JA,"Home is where the heart is, but don't you say that to Rick Kirkland (David O'Donnell), big city attorney to real estate mogul Alexander Malone (Tom Arnold). Malone's latest gleam in the eye is to develop Rick's hometown of Fillmore into a year-round ski resort. He deploys Rick to Fillmore to argue his case and to oppose local legal counsel Lisa Donahue (Nicole Eggert). Oh, and Lisa happens to be the high school sweetheart whom Rick left behind all those years ago. For good measure, the extra slap in the face comes in the shape of Rick's snooty girlfriend Regan (Sarah Thompson, ANGEL) whom he's brought along and to whom he plans to propose and who happens to be the land developer's daughter. Can the movie do anything else to ensure that your sympathy lies with Lisa? Is it a spoiler to say that Rick wins his case? After the victory, he and Regan can't wait to tear out of town, except his $80,000 car then suffers a breakdown. Stranded in Fillmore, what are the odds that Rick looks around and realizes that his hometown is too special to be targeted for demolition?

Is it just me or has Lifetime gotten its act together within the past few years? At least when it comes to putting out good holiday content? Except I don't rank 2008's A CHRISTMAS PROPOSAL in that category. This one smacks of lazy, derivative filmmaking and I didn't much like it. I won't grouse about how I want two hours of my life back because, frankly, I did like some of the commercials on Lifetime. The plot just drifts along, not really taking off, nothing feeling real. It's a cast of caricatures, from the snobby girlfriend to the buffoonish best friend. David O'Donnell has got that Rob Morrow/Patrick Dempsey thing going on, and he's okay but the script gives him nothing to do and even cues him to do a painful double take or two for the sake of pitiful comedy. Tom Arnold pops in here and there and isn't funny in any scene. Nicole Eggert is the best thing here, but it's irksome that the camera seems to focus mostly on her face as if all too aware that she'd packed on a few pounds. Except that Eggert still looks fantastic, no matter that. But even Eggert's presence fails to ingratiate the show with me. Those moments in which Lisa and Rick were supposed to reconnect left me cold. Those things that were supposed to remind Rick that Fillmore is a special place worth saving left me unconvinced. And when Rick got up on stage in that barn party to sing? Train wreck, yo. You'd be better off switching to Hallmark or watching superior Lifetime holiday flicks like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dear-Santa/dp/B005K1VPY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dear Santa</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twelve-Trees-Of-Christmas/dp/B00GOF7AV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twelve Trees Of Christmas</a>&nbsp;(on Amazon Instant Video),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kristin-s-Christmas-Past/dp/B00GTXHPAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kristin's Christmas Past</a>&nbsp;(on Amazon Instant Video), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-at-the-Christmas-Table/dp/B00DW7IV5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love at the Christmas Table</a>.",1419811200,,3281,5.682281059063136
3527729,1,B001D8W7JA,"Poor script, poor scene set-up and lighting, poor acting with a couple of exceptions. At least chemistry between the leads could make for partial redemption, but it was absent here. Stick with something from the Hallmark channel. We watched most of the movie in fast forward from the mid-point on.",1417996800,2,297,4.96
3527730,5,B001D8W7JA,great movie,1416787200,,11,5.0
3527731,2,B001D8W7JA,"At the 50 minute mark I felt like I had been watching it for two hours.  Very drawn out for such a simple storyline.  Not entertaining.  The story has a young man, on the verge of asking his girlfriend to marry him, travel back to his hometown and former girlfriend on a mission for his future millionaire father-in-law to basically destroy the town he grew up in.  Seldom do I watch a Christmas movie and wish for it to end.",1415923200,2,425,4.275

3527735,4,B001D8W7JA,the film is light-hearted and at the same time explores the reasons people are infatuated with one another. What is important is compared with what is possibly convenient or superficially attractive to a relationship.,1389571200,,217,5.411764705882353
3527736,5,B001D8W7JA,Great family movie.  My wife loved them all.  I have no regrets on the purchases of that movie bought at the same time as others.,1377043200,2,129,4.12
3527737,5,B001D8W7JA,"I would suggest this movie to people of all ages.  Puts you in the Christmas mood, immediately.  A very family movie.",1361491200,,117,4.523809523809524
3527738,5,B001D8W7JA,This movie is great if you like to see a hometown boy return home after being in the big city for several years.  He thinks he knows what he wants and it's fun to see how it all unfolds and what he will do with his life. Highly recommend.,1356652800,3,238,3.857142857142857
3527739,4,B001D8W7JA,"I loved this movie.  Nicole Eggert is so lovable. There's nothing like an old fashioned way of life at Christmas to get you in the spirit.  David Deluise (son of Dom Deluise) is a riot. And Reagan the prissy girlfriend is someone you just want to smack. But luckily Rick realizes what he's been missing after hanging out with his old gang and falls back in love with his first love. There's a special moment with the song ""Are you coming home for Christmas"" which got me teary eyed.  Had to buy this movie for my dvd collection.",1355011200,,528,4.36734693877551
3527740,1,B001D8W7JA,"Unfortunately, somehow I decided to watch this movie on the TV. Bottom line: bad acting, bad script, bad everything! It is nauseating to say the least.",1353110400,,151,4.846153846153846
3527741,5,B001D8W7JA,This is a great movie very funny. Ive seen it atleast 10 times and getting ready to watch my Christmas movies again. I do this every year.,1353110400,,138,4.148148148148148
3527742,5,B001D8W7JA,"Very fun Christmas Movie!! Small town boy left small town girl and moved to the big City! Came back with up tight girlfriend for (not telling) and I assume you can figure out the rest! But, it has a lot of cute scenes and the actors are all great! I liked it enough to order it after seeing it on TV 3 times!",1348272000,,308,3.9047619047619047
3527743,1,B001D8W7JA,"... on this movie, and spend it with family members and/or friends instead. You could tell each other better stories than this one, I bet. This two hour-ish tale could have easily been told in 5 minutes or less. I suppose it could be on the TV as background video while decorating the house for the holidays, wrapping presents, or cooking holiday desserts or meals.",1322265600,,365,4.630769230769231
3527744,1,B001D8W7JA,"Predictable plot, horrible acting, totally formulaic.  A total waste of time.  The ""bad guys"" are over the top bad and the ""good guys"" are so sugar sweet that I felt like I needed some insulin.  It's supposedly in the mountains at Christmas time but they apparently used some back lot location for a show set in the summer because there are leaves on all of the trees and summer flowers are blooming all over the place.  THe characters don't even bother to pretend it's cold outside and in some scenes one character will be in a t-shirt while another will be in a coat and scarf.  And naturally the final scene has the prerequisite cheesy snowfall.  It's like a movie put together by a bunch of teenagers for a school project.

There's two hours of my life I'll never get back!",1322092800,3,777,4.468085106382978
3527745,2,B001D8W7JA,"Good story line, but the actors have to be related to one of the investors, cause they were really hard to relate to. I give it two stars because they had some really great music and a couple of good supporting cast. Do yourself a favor and pay 2.99 and watch it on line. Merry Christmas",1318291200,,287,4.142857142857143
3527746,4,B001D8W7JA,"As a collector of Christmas movies, I had to purchase this for the family.  It has a basic theme and the usual conflicts of most movies.  The acting was nice, but not spectacular.  Tom Arnold is a ham, but a lovable one in his few scenes. It is just right for a winter movie fest and the family always enjoys the night.  I recommend it for collectors of Christmas movies, but for any who love a gentle, predictable, movie.",1304294400,,422,4.30379746835443
3527747,4,B001D8W7JA,"Good movie.  Things work out as they should in the end.  Great song, ""Are You Coming Home for Christmas?"".",1295395200,4,106,4.526315789473684
3527748,3,B001D8W7JA,"This movie was just okay. I like Tom Arnold in other Christmas movies, but he wasn't really in this very much at all. Overall, the actors in this movie seemed like they were trying too hard, which made it feel stiff.",1289606400,,216,4.2926829268292686
3527749,2,B001D8W7JA,"We were honestly a little disappointed in the movie, altho it was in good quality, and we appreciate your promptness.",1265414400,2,117,4.9
3527750,4,B001D8W7JA,Picked up this movie over the holidays and enjoyed it.  A heart-warming movie suitable for the entire family.  Interesting costuming--  watch-out for the fruitcake!,1265328000,7,164,5.75

8292350,3,B001D8W7JA,"A wheeler-dealer dad (Tom Arnold as Malone, a Trump-like land developer) and his spoiled daughter (Sarah Thompson as Reagan) coerce a sap (David ODonnell as Rick) into doing their dirty work for them.  In this case, willfully flattening his hometown so Malone can build something bigger and better.  This includes his mothers place!  The sap is an attorney of no distinction or scruples (at one point hes caught going through another attorneys papers!).  The other attorney happens to be his old girlfriend (Nicole Eggert as Lisa) who he dumped and deserted without notice, years before.  Shes fighting to maintain the integrity of their community.  Old friends (Shannon Sturges and David DeLuise) conspire to get the couple back together, in spite of the fact hes getting engaged to the spoiled brat Reagan.

Realism was not part of the plot.  It feels contrived from start to the obvious conclusion.  There are no surprises along the way.  A lot depends on how willing the viewers are to accept this stale romance.
Pity they didn't think to inject it with charm and the spirit of the holidays (it looks as if they filmed the outdoor sequences in the spring.  The fake snow arrived too late to turn this into a real holiday movie).",1480291200,,1232,4.84688995215311
