8271381,4,B0018WOUJ6,"While the plot is nothing particularly new, this over-the-top violent film is surprisingly entertaining and effective.  The main draw is ambition of the filmmakers despite the tiny budget mixed with the guerilla nature of the shooting.  It all feels very real, almost documentary like despite the fact that the principals are all acting.  Everything else - the background, the extras, locations, etc. is all the real deal and the mixture of authentic unscripted backgrounds and fictional narrative is a mind-boggling unique experience straight out of BORAT (but not played for intentional laughs here).

On top of that, there's a few oddly good performances from the unknown actors.  Director Fredianelli shines as the star of the film, a conflicted drug addict cop who murders more innocent bystanders than your usual game of Grand Theft Auto.  The music mostly adds to the charm too, but feels a little choppy and loud at times.  The ending is pretty downbeat, but I wouldn't say predictable... there's enough amusing shootings, fistfights, gore, full frontal female nudity, and even some very realistic sex scenes thrown in.  Overall I'm glad I saw it - the price was right anyway.",1210032000,2,1184,5.130208333333333
