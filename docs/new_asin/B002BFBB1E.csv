3894368,5,B002BFBB1E,I'm going to be soooo disappointed when I finish with the last disk.  I've so enjoyed it.,1258934400,,89,4.235294117647059
3894369,2,B002BFBB1E,I would love the set as the office is a fave... the set I got used was in very poor condition and I question if the set is the original... would hesitate to ever buy used dvd's here again.,1255132800,6,188,3.8461538461538463
3894370,5,B002BFBB1E,"This is a great set for fans of ""the office"", providing tht one doesnt already have any or all of the season sets.

Also, the price is very reasonable if you buy it in this set compared to buying the sets individually. You save about 30-50 dollars.

Overall if you haven't gotten into the office yet, now is the time. Once you stop watching, you will NOT want it to end.",1251676800,14,370,4.197183098591549
3894401,5,B002BFBB1E,I was very please with the DVD set I purchased! All of the disc were in great condition with no scratches! I got this set for my husband for Father's Day and he loved it!! And they arrived at my house fast!,1309651200,,206,3.9285714285714284
3894402,5,B002BFBB1E,"Whether you're a huge Office fan, and looking to keep a collection of every episode at home, or a casual fan who catches the show when it's on TV, this is one of the best deals you'll find! The price really can't be beat (each individual season goes for $40 at most local stores), and you'll have an excuse to spend hours of your day laughing by yourself (one of the only shows able to make me do that). Until another bundle including seasons 6 & 7 comes out, this is the best deal you'll find. I would recommend buying this set, along with the newest seasons separate if you're looking to be caught up with the series. The Office is and will always be one of the wittiest and most clever shows on television this is one of the best ways to enjoy it.

P.S. If you order used, expect awkward packaging, but flawless disc play nonetheless.",1297468800,,837,4.2974683544303796

3894408,5,B002BFBB1E,"Super funny, awesome, hilarious, fantasic, even all the episodes I've seen dozens of times still crack me up.

Only works on some dvd players in Australia due to region coding",1285200000,,105,5.625
3894432,5,B002BFBB1E,"The unique cast makes this show a classic. Every character seems like a derivative of some person in our everyday life. It's got everything you could want in a tv show: humor, love, romance, friendship, spontaneity, etc.",1284768000,,220,4.972972972972973
3894433,5,B002BFBB1E,We purchased this set for Christmas after the bad reviews the first thing I did was check the discs. All were brand new and in great shape. If you can get this for on sale it's a great deal considering the single season sets would add up quickly. Overall pleased with my purchase and sorry that others had a bad experience.,1280966400,,323,4.311475409836065
3894434,5,B002BFBB1E,I purchased this item directly from amazon because I was afraid of buying disks from another seller. The box season collection arrived faster than expected and the items were in good condition. I would recommend!,1275955200,,212,5.085714285714285
3894435,5,B002BFBB1E,"The Office Seasons 1-5. When I need a laugh this is my go to set of dvds. The absurdity of the situations, the characterisations and the wonderful comedic talents of the cast make this a must have. Enjoy",1275523200,,203,4.368421052631579
3894436,2,B002BFBB1E,"The only thing that pleased me about this item was that the discs were perfect. I buy a lot of items from amazon and am almost always satisfied with my purchases.......not the case with this one. I bought this item directly from amazon rather than a 3rd party seller hoping to avoid some of the same things that other purchasers had experienced but I didn't pass unscathed.  Like I said, the discs were perfect but that was the ONLY redeemable quality. All other reviews I read were correct. This is a repackaging scam.  I thought perhaps this was just the case with 3rd party sellers but no.  The images posted for this item on amazon (there are 2) are misleading. There is one that shows the blue box the item actually comes in, but the second image that looks like an office supply portfolio of some sort is pretty much false advertising.......if not an outright lie. The first image is what the item really looks like. The blue box is nothing but a near-paper thin box that contains each individual season exactly how you would buy them off the shelf, except that they aren't even individually sealed. The only one that was sealed was the first season which is in the single dvd-style case as it is only one disc. I can understand a business throwing all of the individual seasons into some new packaging to try and make some sales, but to throw some items into a box that may as well be near-mint used items and call them brand-new is not right. Also, the item was shipped as to provide no protection at all. It was so banged up that it damaged all of the individual seasons.

Like I said, the discs were perfect and I love this show so that's the important thing. Not too mention if I were to buy each of these items individually it would have been more expensive than the price I paid, but I still have issues with this purchase. While I understand the risks of internet shopping and 3rd party purchasing, I bought this item from amazon and this was the first time they have let me down. HEY AMAZON! DO ME A FAVOR AND HAVE THE 2ND PRODUCT IMAGE REMOVED, YOU KNOW, THE ONE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WAY THE ITEM LOOKS AND IS ACTUALLY PACKAGED. I really enjoy buying stuff from you guys and coming home to see a package on my doorstep, it makes it fun, but it is ruined when I start opening a package not even worried about quality issues  because I bought it directly from you, just to find out that its all banged-up and not what I thought I was paying for.  It also was unfortunate that I just got an amazon.com/chase credit card and was excited to use my $40 credit towards an item that wasn't really worth getting.

Anyway, if you don't care about false packaging images, unsealed items and horrible shipping protection then get this item. If you're going to get it, I would still suggest buying from amazon versus 3rd party sellers. My discs were perfect and I've read horrible things about scratched/unplayable discs from the 3rd party sellers. BUT BE AWARE THAT THIS DOES APPEAR TO BE A REPACKAGING SCAM FOR POSSIBLY USED ITEMS..........i'm sorry, I have to say it again, IF YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME WHAT I COULD BUY OF THE SHELF IN SOME DIFFERENT BOX, AT LEAST MAKE THEM INDIVIDUALLY SEALED SO I KNOW THEY ARE NEW AND TAKE THE LIE-OF-AN-IMAGE OFF OF THE SITE PLEASE!",1274054400,8,3282,4.441860465116279
3894437,1,B002BFBB1E,"I was really disappointed, amazon has always been a reliable and trusted shop and they should be clear and fair on that aspect,the blue box was in really bad shape. I'm pretty sure this is not a brand new DVD set. really low price but at the end the cost was really high",1273795200,8,270,4.113207547169812
3894438,4,B002BFBB1E,"How do you review ""the office""? It is some of the best comedy writing I've ever witnessed. I stopped watching television after ""Angel"" ended several years back, and had become bored with the endless selection of reality crap that flooded the market, as well as the quality of written shows that were once good, like the last few seasons of ""Friends"". I'll probably get a lot of flack for that comment, but I honestly defy anyone to watch a random episode of ""Friends"" from the first two or three seasons, then an episode from the last two seasons, and not see a decline in writing that defers to having Phoebe say nonsensical comments for the sake of nonsense, Monica yell every line, Chandler no longer being funny, and Ross making inferred comic comments as opposed to the actually intelligent statements a paleontologist (or whatever he was) would. It was once my favorite show, and absolutely fell.
Whatever.

""The Office"" reinstills my faith in the ability to make new television for written production. Anyone that has worked in an office can instantly identify with several of the situations that make this program spot-on the mark. Having a crush on someone you work with, sharing a workspace with someone whose habits are different than your own, having a boss who is ridiculously clueless, and so many more that I can't even think of them all.

It is also incredibly funny just on its merit, and really does not require you to have ever worked in an office. Believable characters that find themselves in situations that truly make one laugh out loud.

As for this DVD pack, I'm mostly impressed and happy with it. I have been without television connection for a few years, and only caught a few episodes of this show in syndication on TBS from time to time at a friend's house before I purchased this boxset. Apparently, the show continued to a sixth season, whereas this boxset ends at season five. Not that big of a deal, since the enclosed packaging are actually just the individual seasons' sets previously released individually. But it's a little bit of a drag that this boxset doesn't complete a collection. (I suppose I didn't make it clear, but the sixth season is currently being broadcast, and hasn't been released on dvd yet) I have two other problems with the discs. One is that one of my discs came with an episode completely unwatchable. It looks like there was some kind of error in the production of the disc; which is not that big of a deal, anyone who's burned a disc knows that not every one will be perfect. I've been meaning to contact the dvd company to see if they'll replace my disc. The other is that the compression quality is rather shabby. Seasons 1 and 2 show definite artifacts, suffering from, I assume, a low bitrate. I've only watched season 3 of the rest, so far. But even that one has not improved much. I did notice that some of the later seasons were released on Blu Ray, which will look much better. I've seen one episode of season 4 on Amazon on demand's high definition playback, and it looked great.

As a quick hit to get your ""Office"" fix, this set is fantastic. It is packed with a lot of extra features, including several videos made by characters within the show that you can watch full screen. But if you really want everything, you might want to wait to get all six, or however many they come out with.",1273104000,,3360,4.604340567612688
3894439,5,B002BFBB1E,The product I ordered and received were just as the seller described. It arrived sooner than I had expected.,1270944000,,108,4.7368421052631575
3894440,5,B002BFBB1E,I bought this item for my brother for his birthday and he absolutely loved it. It was way cheaper here then in stores. The delivery was fast and right on time for his birthday. Would deffinatly buy from seller again.:),1270944000,,218,4.475
3894441,3,B002BFBB1E,"since everyone is having trouble im just suggesting what I'm doing. Order seasons 1,2,5 individually but they have a bundle of seasons 3 and 4 for $37. it'll cost you around $8 more and you won't get the nifty box but hopefully all the discs will be brand new",1270425600,3,259,4.3061224489795915
3894442,1,B002BFBB1E,"I purchased this boxed set so I could finally catch up with the show everyone talks about. I love the few episodes I've seen, but I haven't watched The Office much because I like to see shows from the beginning and watch them chronologically. Therefore, I believed this box set would be the buy for me.

Unfortunately, I'm not going to even bother trying to play these DVDs. As many other reviewers have said, the set is an obvious repackaging scam. Many of the discs I got were either scratched or showed obvious signs of use.

I was told that I was going to receive new DVDs. I obviously did not receive new, and am already working towards a return. I am very displeased. Don't let yourself be fooled. Don't buy this box set.",1269993600,68,727,4.417910447761194
3894443,2,B002BFBB1E,"I ordered this with the impression that it was in good quality but when I received the discs a few of them were unplayable. The seller was quick to send me a replacement after I found the first disc that was unplayable especially when it you are watching one season after another, it takes awhile. It was just too much hassle to ask for replacements for every disc that wasn't working so I didn't contact the seller about it. So the condition the claimed was a little deceiving. Some times it  is worth  a little extra to get what you want. I will say that the seller was very pleasant and easy to work with.",1269302400,8,608,4.278260869565218
3894444,5,B002BFBB1E,I bought this as a gift after purchasing one on Ebay that did not work. This one was brand new and worked well. No complaints. A big hit for the office fans in the house. The extra footage was pretty hilarious.,1268611200,,210,4.146341463414634
3894445,5,B002BFBB1E,"The Office is a fun comedy, enjoyable, and you would want to own the full series.  However, you would want to have extra time in your day to watch.  The series show the life of a manager and his employees in an office.. (ironic since people want to get out of their offices and not think of work)  but it's a fun comedy and the characters (michael, jim and dwight) make the series worthwhile.

i would recommend it to anyone.",1268092800,,425,4.275

It is a GREAT show and will keep you entertained for plenty of time.  I purchased my 1-5 box set a little after christmas 2009, merry christmas to me.  I paid $127.00 for the 5 set, I see the price now for $87.00!!!! I cant help but feeling over the barral.  I thought $125.00 was barely what the dvds were worth, but I wanted it.  Now that NEW is $87.00 well it is really really worth the money.  I just wish I would have waited for the lower price, oh well, thats how it is now adays.  Enjoy!!!",1264464000,3,637,4.0

3894456,1,B002BFBB1E,"Just got this delivered today, and it appears that this is some sort of repackaging scam; where items returned to vendors are bundled up and sold as a ""collection"". All the seasons boxes were dirty and or smudged, including most of the DVDs. In one of them, the plastic DVD holder was completely detached from the cardboard, with the DVDs just floating about. I'm not even going to bother to play any of the DVDs. I payed for new, and that's what I expect. It seems I'm not the only one with this problem. Other reviewers have alluded the same.
