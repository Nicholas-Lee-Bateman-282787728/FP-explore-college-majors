3650601,2,B001J4E1CY,"First off, the obvious: Oliver Twist has been produced many, many times, so I accept that someone might want to say something ""different"" in a production rather than stay faithful to the book. However, I really can't understand why this version was made as it strays so far from the book and can't seem to make up its mind about what it intends to be. The modern soundtrack music was jarring to me and not at all fitting with the desperate situations the film presents. The sets must have been built on a shoestring budget. I am a high school English teacher, and my students commented on the cheap looking scenery and how it made the movie look like it was made for tv twenty years ago. I know a screenwriter is free to choose what details to leave out or change, but I couldn't fathom the purpose for most of them except to twist Dickens' meanings to fit our times. For example, Sikes' means of death was changed in the movie to give it a very different spin than the book had, and the only reason I can think of would be to make the viewer feel sorry for him. Basically, I didn't ""get"" this movie. I tried to keep an open mind as I watched, but I ended up just feeling let down. Dickens' book is so rich, and this movie is so plain and tasteless that I wouldn't recommend you spend your money on it when there are so many other versions available.",1235433600,5,1350,4.27734375
3650602,5,B001J4E1CY,"This BBC production of Oliver Twist is simply marvelous!  Fresh and energetic, it makes a familiar story new and engaging.  With vivid characters one loves to hate ever plotting against the defenseless in a society notorious for exploiting and oppressing women, the poor and the different, this movie streamlines the monumental opus that is Oliver Twist into a classic tale of good vs evil for the 21st century.

It's ridiculous to cavil at a filmmaker for failing to stick to every detail of an 800 page novel when making a three hour movie.  This version of Oliver Twist is no exception.  Yes, some of the story was changed to fit time, budget and casting constraints, but the result is faithful to the overall tone and plot of Dickens' novel, making it accessible to a new generation.  It is well worth watching.

This film is particularly effective in portraying 19th century anti-Semitism.  If the details of Fagin's character and treatment were changed to convey this, it is an integral part of the story and in this PC age, I was delighted.  Mrs. Sowerberry's hat collection served to illustrate the hypocrisy of the characters and skewering hypocrisy was one of Dickens' favorite themes. If the fimmakers took liberties with the details, the overall message was very Dickensian.

The dissonant soundtrack created a sense of urgency, unease and danger, and the production values were impeccable--the dirt and darkness of the workhouse and thieves' den in contrast to the light interiors and costumes of the Brownlow household--and did much to add to the atmosphere.  All told, this was a very thoughtful, well-designed and well-acted production.  Purists should reread the book and congratulate themselves on catching the changes.",1235347200,10,1737,5.098939929328622
3650603,1,B001J4E1CY,"The other reviewers have already listed some of the MANY liberties that this production has taken with Dickens' great work.  Rather than elaborate, let me just say that it's what you might call the ""Oliver Stone version"" of Oliver Twist.  Compared to many of Dickens' other works, Oliver Twist is not a particularly long or complex tale, and there's no excuse for the distortions and omissions in this latest Masterpiece Theater version.  And as for casting the cheerful and enigmatic Spuds McKenzie as the evil Bullseye, gimme a break!",1235260800,14,536,5.0
3650604,1,B001J4E1CY,"The producers, director and script-writer of this ""Masterpiece Classic"" version of ""Oliver Twist"" obviously detest Charles Dickens and this is their revenge upon him. Mine is not a ""purist's"" critique. When employing the term ""purist"" it suggests a stickler fixated on mere details that have gone awry. But what we have here is falsification of Mr. Dickens' book and the ideas he was attempting to convey.

People think they know Dickens because familiarity breeds contempt and ""Oliver Twist"" has been a musical and has been filmed numerous times and even falsified before (most notoriously in the TV film with Richard Dreyfuss in the lead). In the public mind, ""Oliver Twist"" is just a tale of the slums and of a handsome little boy who asks plaintively for ""More, please."" There is so much more to it.

Dickens was exposing the anti-Christian political philosophy of predatory capitalism in ""Oliver Twist,"" just as he was in ""A Christmas Carol."" But this ""Masterpiece"" version has the workhouse board of directors hurling Christian imprecations at Oliver, as if they themselves were Christian fundamentalists. This is tantamount to rewriting ""A Chistmas Carol"" so as to make Scrooge into a grouchy Bible believer. Nonsense!

Fagin, a kidnapper and fence who was a character of almost supernatural evil in Dickens' original, is, in keeping with the suffocating political correctness of our times, shown as benevolent. He's also shown as an observant Judaic (which he is not in the book) and yet beardless! A frum Judaic in 1839 who shaves? Ridiculous.

There is much more that could be said about the buffoonish fabrications in this disgusting parody of a great achievement in English literature. Fortunately, the rock-music soundtrack for the film is so grating and out of synch with early Victorian England that even my teenage children were repelled by it. The intrusive soundtrack should guarantee that ""Masterpiece Classic Oliver Twist"" is consigned to the obscurity it so richly deserves. To Sarah Phelps, the screenwriter: shame on you!

For those who want to see a film version of ""Oliver Twist"" that actually is based on the book Dickens wrote, they should watch the 1985 BBC version, 352 minutes in length. It's well done, educational and entertaining and while it has omitted some parts, it has preserved the central characters, plot and themes, including the fact that Oliver is rescued from Fagin, Bill Sykes, one of his own evil relations as well as the heartless capitalist system that oppressed children in workhouses and sold them as slaves to chimney sweeps, by the charity and kindness of true Christians.",1234742400,21,2625,5.10955710955711
3650605,5,B001J4E1CY,"The first reviewer, Mr. Raker, is right about one thing: it ain't exactly like the book. Purists and high school English teachers can go on showing David Lean's classic B&W if fresh, creative vision offends them, but screenwriter Sarah Phelps has done something remarkable - she has given Dickens' impossibly precious title character a spine.  This Oliver stands up to his tormentors, despite the cruel handicap of being young, and the result is that we no longer pity the lad, we actually care about him.

It was unseemly to torpedo this excellent re-visioning of Oliver Twist, tautly directed by Coky Giedroyc, before it had been shown on PBS, for it clearly was made by intelligent artists who did not deviate from the original just to be different.  They bring a creepy slumdog vitality to an old and well-loved story.",1234742400,11,822,4.899280575539568
3650606,1,B001J4E1CY,"I watched the first twenty minutes of this DVD on PBS and found far too much of the dialog unintelligible due to the extreme accents of the actors. This is not the case, for example, with the BBC production of David Copperfield where the speech is quite okay. I find it odd that given the desire to sell to the US public the producers would not make sure that the dialog was reasonably easy to understand. If they could do this with David Copperfield, why not with Oliver Twist? I would buy the DVD if it had English subtitles but I can't find this out, so I fear I won't be buying this version.",1234656000,5,595,4.228070175438597

3650612,5,B001J4E1CY,"As many reviewers have pointed out, this Oliver Twist is not for purists.

But it is fabulous.  It captures the energy and grime and horror and wonder of the original book.

Do watch the ""A New Twist on Oliver Twist"" program at the end.  The script-writer, as well as the set-producer and director and costumer and makeup artists and even some of the actors, go into great detail on how, and why, they made changes from the original.

The acting is really good, but Timothy Spall steals the show as Fagin.  He plays Fagin as the outcast, a man soured by the society that can't accept him, yet one who is avaricious only out of the same climb-out-of-the-gutter ethos that propels the rich and famous in the society.  He is genuinely liked by his boys, especially the Artful Dodger, even though he shamelessly manipulates them.  And Fagin's end is truly shocking (though very faithful to the book): he is executed more because he is a Jew than because he is a fence who corrupts children.

The Dodger's end is quite spectacular too.  His adoption of Bull's Eye, and his fierce elbowing aside of people in the street, show that Sykes will be reborn not very long hence.

Sykes's demise is quite different from the book, but equally compelling: instead of falling off a roof and accidentally hanging, he sinks into the sewer and hangs himself, apparently in remorse over Nancy.

As the actor and writer point out, Monks is completely transformed from the book, and made into an interesting character in his own right (which he is not in the book).

The Brownlow household is also interesting.  In the book it is oversentimentalized, whereas in the movie it is clean and pure and deeply stricken with loss and secrets and violence.

Dickens is famous for characterization--except for his sympathetic heroines, who are usually one-dimensional at best.  Here that flaw is perfectly remedied, by a wonderful, shocking, and genuinely heartwarming Nancy, and a tough, courageous, feisty Rose.

The settings and ambience are perfect.

The only flaw I see, and it's not large, is the actor who plays Oliver.  He is pretty, but has a tendency to stare vacantly and smile at all the wrong times.  On the plus side, he is spunky and stands up to everyone from Bumble to Sykes.

Best of all the new takes, and the one many hate, is the music.  It is rapid and sometimes dissonant but always percussive and dancy, varying from reggae beats to near classical to Polka like accordions.  This fits perfectly with the often handheld camera work racing through the streets and giving a low, child-eye view of the teeming streets and crowds.

Really smashing.",1465948800,,2636,4.768211920529802

This is NOT an adaptation of Oliver Twist, but a new story.  Charles Dickens reacted to critics of Oliver Twist's dark subject matter by providing an introduction to the novel titled ""Preface to the 1841 Edition"", in which he describes his goal of portraying Evil ""in all their deformity; in all their wretchedness; in all the squalid poverty of their lives; to show them as they really are...."".  The 1985 BBC version of Oliver Twist is an adaptation of the novel, and if you are interested in Charles Dickens, you would be well advised to steer clear of this version and head for the other one.  If, on the other hand, you have no interest in Dickens, and are looking for entertainment, this is not a bad story.  The actors are first rate, and the production values are high.  If you are familiar with Dickens and insist on seeing this version, don't be surprised if you wind up laughing at ghosts!",1401408000,,1063,4.587301587301587
3650630,1,B001J4E1CY,"Blind arrogance or crass stupidity must characterise any persons who think they can improve on Charles Dickens' immortal tales.  Any lover of Dickens' work and especially ""Oliver Twist"" must squirm with discomfort at the tasteless liberties taken by the screen writer of this movie.  She has stolen sufficient of the real ""Oliver"" to make her effort appear authentic but the indignant conclusion from those who know must be, ""this is not he"".  I am a confessed Anglo-phile and have always delighted in the BBC Masterworks productions but this time they hit the bottom and I feel betrayed.

Having said which, I must add that cinematographically this production is spectacular apart from the music which is tasteless, offensive and has no relevance whatever to the Victorian plot.  The cast members, almost without exception, are brilliant.  One glaring exception is the Magistrate who is completely phoney with his ludicrous wig and three-day growth of beard which in the twenty-first century apparently signifies masculinity but somehow seems out of place for a Victorian magistrate.  The other character who totally fails to convince is Fagin.  At no point could I see anything ""Jewish"" (a beardless Jew?) in this character and yet the screen writer rightly makes anti-semitism a prime factor in the plot.  Timothy Small's Fagin appears not as a villain but rather as a clown.  He ends up as the innocent victim of rampant anti-semitism and his own naivete which leaves him at the mercy of ruthless  criminal types and fundamentalist Christians (with whom Ms. Phelps apparently has an axe to grind).  Fagin's pious refusal to acknowledge Christ in the final court scene is so totally out of character as to be laughable if it were not so utterly tasteless.

The portrayal of Monks is a masterful tour de force.  I have never seen a nastier character.  Edward Fox' portrayal of this evil character is powerful and completely believable.  Nancy is beautifully and convincingly played by Sophie Okonedo.  What a talented actress she is! Oliver and the Dodger are both talented young charmers however ten years in a Victorian workhouse would never produce a healthy, bright, guttsy child, cute as the dickens (no pun) but totally incredible.  The horrible end of Dodger (a future Sikes) is wickedly synical.

Bill Sikes suicide in a fit of nauseating self-pity again is totally out of character.  The powerful drama of the original has been replaced with nauseating insipidity.  The screen writer, directer, whoever let this one through definitely needs help.

Obviously great care has been taken with the sets and costumes and the use of color and shadow to create atmosphere deserves the highest commendation.

So if you love spectacular movies and can tolerate a phoney plot, go for it but if you love Dickens take a barf bag.",1399680000,4,2827,5.058315334773218

Since I was just fresh from reading it, I was able to easily recognize all of the many ways this movie strayed from the original. Lots of characters are missing entirely, and so many parts of the plot changed that I couldn't even begin to make a list.

That said, I actually really loved this movie. It made me cry, it repulsed me, it made me happy, relieved--every emotion was felt.

I've been guilty myself of being the worst purist...especially with adaptations of Jane Austen novels into film. I hate almost all of those movies. (The exception is the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.) I don't have the emotional attachment to Dickens that I have to Austen, so perhaps that is why I didn't react to all the changes of this story, I just accepted them and waited to see where the story would take me.

If you're a Dickens purist, you are better off skipping this. If you are looking for an entertaining film that is well acted and emotionally satisfying, then you should check this one out.",1367884800,,1173,4.4672897196261685

I was thoroughly entranced by this movie.  From start to finish, the characters held me spellbound and I loved it.  The performances were top notch, especially by Sophie Okonedo who played Nancy, Tom Hardy who played Bill Sikes, and William Miller as Oliver Twist.

If you want a movie to be identical to a book, then you're likely to live a life of constant disappointment. Movies are movies and will always be the fraternal twin of the book rather than the identical twin.  Yes, this is very different in some ways to the book, but the adaptation still shares the DNA of ""Oliver Twist"".  Those of you who say it would be a great movie if only it had a different title would be screaming the injustices of plagiarism if this movie were made and NOT titled ""Oliver Twist"".

You are reviewing a FILM not the book and though it's a film adaptation of a book, it's still a creative piece of its own and as such deserves to be reviewed that way.  The book is excellent.  It's a classic for a reason.  Read it, by all means, I highly encourage everyone to read the book and never rely on a film for your literary knowledge.

3650649,2,B001J4E1CY,"I was looking forward to watching this with the Dickens Bicentennial this year. As it opens, you can tell it had great production values -- costuming, set design, all superb.  It opens with a slight but forgiveable deviation from the original.  Unfortunately, the deviations grow ever larger through the course of the movie to point that it dropped from being a 4.5 star rendition to 2 stars.

I don't mind someone thinking they can try to improve on Dickens' material -- the musical version was indeed an improvement in many ways -- but these unnecessary changes, from the constant focus on Fagin's Jewishness (including his final court scene) to Bill Sikes' final kidnapping of Oliver and run through the streets of London, were no improvement.  Even poor Mr. Bumble's unhappy marriage to Ms. Corney is rewritten to suit someone's ego.  The little psycho drama with Bill Sikes at the end instead of using Dickens' original dramatic ending was as pathetic as the ego that conjured it up and was very much out of character.  I don't know whether to blame Ms. Sarah Phelps (credited with writing) or Coky Giedroyc (credited as director) but I found this truly upsetting.

Timothy Spall turns in a highly original version of Fagin.  He's not at all what one pictures after seeing Ron Moody or Ben Kingsley but he is quite believable in the role.  Sophie Okonedo also gives a slightly different but acceptable twist as Nancy.  Her performance is powerful until ruined at the end by the aforementioned psychodrama.  Edward Fox's Mr. Brownlow was less charitable than seen in other renditions but a powerful performance (as always true of Mr. Fox) and strangely in character even when inconsistent with Dickens' masterpiece.  William Miller's Oliver Twist just felt ... bland.  He just doesn't convey the sense of innocent naivete Mark Lester gave the role; he almost seemed like he'd have had more fun if he'd been able to play the Artful Dodger.

In the end, while this aired on PBS's Masterpiece, it is far from one.  The superb photography, set and costume design cannot compensate for the unnecessary changes to the material.  If you're a Dickens fan, do yourself a favor and watch any other version of this story -- even one of the Disney renditions.",1331164800,3,2251,4.868766404199475
3650650,2,B001J4E1CY,"Let me say this:  If you have no familiarity with the novel and want to watch this only for the cinematic performances, I can heartily recommend the film.  The pace is quick, the acting is very good (especially Mr. Spall) and the production values are top notch.  However, if you know and care about the novel this film used as a springboard, run for your very lives.  To witness the liberties taken with Mr. Dickens's tale is enough to make one lose one's faith in humanity.

I've always thought one of the failings of the 1968 musical is that it lopped off the last third of the novel.  I realize now it was being kind.  In this adaptation, very little of Dickens's marvelous dialogue is included. The famous speech of Bumble's ""If the law supposes that ... the law is a [sic] ass...,"" is entirely removed.  A character who never asserts herself in the book bids to become a modern crusader in this film and the terrifying death a horrendous villain justifiably gets on the page is changed to a cowering, deliberate suicide.  While it was nice to see the character of Monks utilized (for a change) he becomes a harasser of the fair Rose instead of a devious, dissolute man bent in discrediting Oliver.  The cheering characters of Charley Bates and Harry Maylie are omitted altogether.

One change is believable and conveyed in an artful way.  The Dodger is sentenced for transportation in the book after giving a performance in the London courts that is delightful if untainted by the truth.  This film makes the suggestion, with a few lines and thirty seconds of camera time, that society's neglect of a redeemable Dodger will serve only to breed the next Sikes.  This is a subtle and chilling sequence, well worth being in the movie although not consistent with the original story.

As I've said, watch or purchase this if you are solely interested in realistic portrayals of the street life young Oliver Twist was exposed to.  If your aim is for a visual retelling of the famous tale, look elsewhere.  The Dickensian details and twists that made this story popular enough to demand adaptations have been removed, like cream from the milk.",1331078400,3,2143,4.702412868632708

3650655,2,B001J4E1CY,"The only reason I even bothered to give this atrocious miniseries two stars is because I loved how tender Nancy & Rose were with Oliver in this re-interpretation of Charles Dickens' classic (originally published in serial form between 1837-1838 in ""Bentley's Miscellany""). Other than that, it was a very, very, very poor version of the novel. Firstly, there were some sexual references and an implied sexual relationship between Noah & Charlotte. Secondly, the mood was too light. Thirdly, Nancy was black. Fourthly, the relationships were so changed from what they were in the novel that I barely recognized it as being based on the book. Fifthly, the villains were not even on-half as menacing as in the novel. SPOILER ALERT: Sixthly, Mr. & Mrs. Bumble weren't even punished. Seventhly (and my last point), Oliver talked back. Back then, if you talked back, you got smacked around, and in the novel, Oliver was smart enough to avoid doing that. I did, however, enjoy the scenes with Nancy, Oliver & Rose (especially the look on Rose's face when she realized something crucial and a passionate speech she gave on Oliver's behalf in Episode III), particularly one scene where Rose & Oliver are playing the piano together. I love those scenes. They're the only reason I even bothered to watch this atrocious miniseries. If you want to see a version that's close to the book, the best one out there (as far as I can tell) is the 1985 BBC version starring Eric Porter as Fagin. While it does have its faults, it's better than the musical version, the 1999 Masterpiece Theater version (though I liked a few scenes here and there) and even the 1922 version. STAY AWAY from this crappy version. Dickens would be turning in his grave at this desecration of one of his most beloved novels.",1265932800,3,1781,4.804560260586319
3650656,5,B001J4E1CY,"I am a big fan of classic literature, and I love well-done adaptations.  I really enjoyed this version of Oliver Twist.  The mannerisms of the characters and the music are all very modern, and though I enjoy the more closely representational adaptations, I enjoy the ones that take more liberties as well.
I personally thought the acting was well-done.  I enjoyed the different takes on Dickens' characters.  The camera work added another modern and fun note.  It's a very up-beat, fast-paced, and exciting adaptation.

In short, there are an abundance of bad reviews for this movie, so I thought I'd try and give it a lift.  Check it out.  If you like classic literature adaptations, and you're not of the overly-purist sect, I think you'll enjoy it.",1262304000,11,751,4.858267716535433
3650657,2,B001J4E1CY,"I am such a big fan of Oliver Twist that I can find merit even in a poor and largely unfaithful adaption such as this one. Besides deviating from the values and intent of the novel, however, this version also fails in characterization. There are boo-coo fascinating and exciting characters in Dickens's novel, and the temptation is to get deep into the minds of all of them to interpret their actions and worldview. You can't do this without getting too far away from the main thread of the plot. The effect is far too muddy. This film gets close to the bad guys in a way that makes their actions seem comprehensible, which is exactly the opposite effect of the book. The Artful Dodger, for example, is potrayed in the book as having some swagger and artistic flair, but as internally darkened -- as deeply as a boy can be. The Dodger in this film is a fully likeable character. He could be the kid next door. There are many such examples. Strangely enough, the novel's ""good"" characters are here potrayed as grittier, moodier, more steely. The bad guys get softer and the good guys more hard-core. ???",1259625600,2,1102,4.570707070707071
3650658,1,B001J4E1CY,"I had the misfortune of watching this version of Oliver Twist on the local PBS station. It not only takes great ""liberties"" with Dickens' masterpiece, but it reflects an utter contempt for its values. It reflects current trends in English culture to deride Christianity, detest capitalism, and despise their history. While Oliver Twist is a timeless classic, it is very much a product of the Victorian Age. The producers of this mess wasted talents like Timothy Spall in order to make what John Henry Newman referred to as ""smart hits at easy targets,"" with Christianity foremost among them. Dickens aimed his satire at hypocritical Christians, not all of them; he worked to improve state institutions, and he did not unilaterally attack all of them. He was not the most nuanced of writers--he still had a quaint belief in things like good and evil--yet he was enough of an artist not to render these values according to class, race, or religion. The producers of this version of Oliver Twist should have done their research and kept their pet hatreds to themselves.",1251590400,9,1066,4.927777777777778

3650660,1,B001J4E1CY,"If you are expecting a recreation of Charles Dickens' classic story, you are in for a surprise! The screenwriter (Sarah Phelps?)almost created her own story while using the classic Oliver Twist as a template. Although bearing the same names, the characters in this movie were not ones created by Charles Dickens. They looked like someone born in the wrong century. It's bad! I wonder how such a script got made into a movie by BBC. There was no artistic value here. A total waste of public money!!!",1245801600,9,498,4.735632183908046
3650661,1,B001J4E1CY,"This BBC adaptation twists around all that is fundamental to the story.  And the acting is stilted and over-dramatic.  After watching 10 minutes, I could not stand it any more. I switched to watch a short feature about the making of the film.

The director said she was tired of the usual way the characters were played.  She choose to portray Oliver as a strong-willed boy who could stand-up up to Fagan & Sikes instead of a frightened and passive boy.  She cast Fagan as a large man, not a skinny man.  I'm sure she went on to explain more, but I had had all I could take.

The problem with this 'interpretation' is that it is not what Dickens wrote.  I am a fan of Dickens--I don't' want the director's version of Oliver Twist.  I want Dickens's.  Oliver is believable & interesting because of the way Dickens wrote him.  If Oliver was strong-willed, the story wold have been different.  Same goes for the other characters. Skip this and get a version that is more faithful to the book.",1245628800,16,989,4.4636871508379885

3650664,5,B001J4E1CY,"I saw this DVD on sale in a Target store, so I took a chance on it. Luckily, I hadn't read the reviews here or I would have given it a pass. This production of Dickens' famous novel is the least faithful of all the versions I have seen, but I expected that going in. It's basically a stylistic rewrite of the story with a modern audience in mind. Had I been a Dickens purist looking for a mirror image of the book, I would have been appalled, as some reviewers here obviously were.

Instead, it's a fresh take on an old story. It doesn't pretend to be faithful. The result for me is that I was highly entertained, and as someone else has pointed out, instead of looking for how many deviations I could find, I was enthralled by the fact that I did NOT know what was coming next. This in effect freed me from the book, which I have read several times (yes, I like Dickens), and allowed me to judge this fresh approach on its own merits.

I was quite satisfied with the story as it stood on its own two feet, although the original story is much better. But that was a book (a newspaper serial, actually), not a 173 minute television mini-series. Were I to produce a faithful mini-series of Oliver Twist I would require at least ten hour-long segments. It's a very complicated yarn. (I'd love to film the chapter where Oliver is recuperating in the country.)

The cast is excellent for the most part. William Miller (Pieter in ""Krakatoa"") was an inspired choice for what he was intended to do: portray an appealing yet fearless version of Oliver--a boy who has been subjected to the dreary trials of a workhouse upbringing, yet because of his character has come through it all as a soft spoken, kindly little soul. Adam Arnold as Dodger presents a new ""twist"" on the character, who is shown as being quite sensitive and vulnerable, and in love with Nancy (who throws him over for Oliver). Bill Sykes is played by Tom Hardy, and while he looks fine in the part, his accent is so extreme I could only understand ever tenth word. He also suffers in my eyes because he's no Robert Newton. That holds true with every other actor who has played Sykes. Similarly, Timothy Spall is no Alec Guiness. I had a hard time swallowing his Fagin, but again this is a rewrite of the story and he does an adequate job with the writer's reconstruction of the character. Mr. Brownlow is played by the ubiquitous Edward? Fox (is he William, James or Edward? I wish he'd make up his mind).

If it sounds like I'm having fun with this review, it's probably because I had fun watching this DVD. The extra on the disk is a ""making-of"" documentary. I enjoyed meeting Will Miller, Sophie Okonedo (Nancy), and others. However, when you listen to the writer, Sarah Phelps, you begin to get an insight into why this Oliver Twist is so different from all the others. She strikes me as an angry, over-the-top liberal who has strong opinions on Dickens and other societal matters. She rubbed me the wrong way, but at the same time I did like very much what she produced. So there you have it in a nutshell.

The music didn't bother me one little bit. In fact, its spirited tone fit the revised character of Oliver very well, and I felt it was perfect for this particular production. William Miller is a handsome, lovable boy, and I was very pleased to see Oliver Twist as an engaging, sturdy and athletic youngster for once instead of the meek, frail waif we have always seen, a character who we are to pity. It's a fresh outlook. The rest of the cast, the authentic costuming and backgrounds, yes and even the heavily rewritten story, support this new twist on Oliver Twist very well.

It's a good movie. Don't miss it. Take the sour apple reviews with a grain of salt.",1236038400,41,3734,4.443795620437956
3650665,5,B001J4E1CY,"The cast showed up for work in this darker adaptation of Dickens's novel. They are all terrific and make for a memorable movie. In particular, William Miller plays Oliver with remarkably gritty determination--you're pulling for him throughout the movie.  Hardy and Rhind-Tutt are scarily evil as Bill Sikes and Monks respectively. Tim Spall plays an interestingly ambiguous Fagin; Sophie Okonedo wonderfully captures Nancy's sympathy for Oliver despite her trapped circumstances.

This is much more of a thriller/ suspense story than a light-hearted adventure through London's slums. A few annoyances are present such as barely audible dialog in some scenes, occasional jarring music and irritating anachronisms, but they do not seriously damage an emotionally affecting and compelling film.

3650666,3,B001J4E1CY,"This version of Oliver twist  was not a bad film, in fact it was quite good. It should not be compared to Polanski's film or the 1968 film. It should be compared to David Lean's excellent film with Sir Alec Guinness. Many previous films including the 1968 film and polanski's omit an important character in Oliver's half brother ""Monks"" or Edward as he is called here. Yes in the book Monks was a major villain who employed Fagin to corrupt Oliver, And in this film Monks is a well portrayed villain who threatens everyone he meets and  tried to seduce his cousin. True, in the book he does not seduce his cousin but he does everything else. Timothy Spall's Fagin is quite good and shows that poverty has corrupted his soul. To show him as a proper jew honors the true nature of a very complex character of which Dickens only shows one side to Fagan. No this production is not a word for word literal telling of Oliver Twist but it opens up old characters and shows that evil has many faces. It is not a perfect film and sometimes the soundtrack was annoying but it was overall a good production and worth watching.",1235433600,15,1115,4.434146341463415
8311825,5,B001J4E1CY,"Truly this Masterpiece edition of Oliver Twist stands out as the Best among all other adaptations, as Masterpiece usually does.  And it stands out not just for the darker tone that adheres more to the actual mood of Dickens' novel but in its keeping more to the core plot of Dickens novel with Monks and the mystery of Oliver's parentage. The fact that is a mini-series probably is what makes a difference, I always go for the mini-series when there's a book with a juicy, complicated plot because they often to do it better justice.

There are many characters here too that are missing in most adaptations but are actually from the book. Rose Maylie, Mr. Brownlow and Edward Monks I was so surprised and glad to see, and not just cameos but solid characters central to the plot. And then the Cast does an amazing job breathing new life into familiar characters.
Timothy Spall is delightfully repulsive as Fagin just as he was as Peter Pettigrew in the Harry Potter franchise, Julian Alistair Rhind-Tutt is a sinister Edward Monks that almost is an equal in chilling drama to Tom Hardy as Bill Sikes. I have to give this Nancy, Sophie Okonedo, particular praise because she gave a coarse but inherently nurturing personality to the character that was great to watch. To me, its the Best adaptation alone just by the effort the Cast put into making every character tangible and powerful even more then the figures in Dickens book.

So yeah, if any Dickens fans want the best adaptation of Oliver Twist, this is it. I wouldn't really bother paying attention to many others.",1521590400,,1571,4.705454545454545
