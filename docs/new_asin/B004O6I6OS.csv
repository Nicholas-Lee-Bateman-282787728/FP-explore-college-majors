4436708,4,B004O6I6OS,"I enjoyed it. It isn't up to Dorkness Rising's standard -- that's got to be one of the funnier movies of all time, at least if we're scoring by how many times my family wanted to watch it. But I enjoyed both the story and the humor in JourneyQuest, and thought it was a good start.

The problem is that it's way too short: you're just getting started and it's over -- and the story is nowhere near complete. I understand that they need to raise money for season two, and you have to see this DVD in that light or you will likely feel a bit gypped.

That said, it's a good beginning and another fine effort from Dead Gentlemen featuring Brian and Christian -- sometimes you have to take what you can get.",1307664000,2,703,4.2
4436709,5,B004O6I6OS,"An amusing story about four heroes on a quest. Although the term 'hero' may be a bit much for a group that includes a cowardly wizard who wants nothing more than to avoid the quest altogether and a knight who believes honor can be gained by killing anything in sight. Fans of high fantasy settting (such as Dungeons and Dragons) will probably find this more to there liking; but overall I would recommend it as an amusing diversion for anyone.

While pretty much the entire span of the disc is available in short 3 to 5 minute episodes on-line (so you can try it before you buy it, if you are so inclined) The title is still worth purchase to show support to those who created the series, and to help pay for another season. So if you like it enough to want to see more, go ahead and purchase a copy.",1307577600,2,800,4.2631578947368425
4436710,5,B004O6I6OS,"The quality of this DVD is great (resolution, packaging, etc.) My only complaint is that since it is based on a web series of fairly short episodes, the Intro/Title sequence every 5 minutes or so gets a little irritating. I know, I know. Each episode has a title, but still. I guess it does give viewers a brief chance to comment between episodes.

 Dead Gentlemen Productions deserve praise for knowing their subject matter. So far they have released several ""gaming"" series/movies and each one is somehow familar to anyone that watches them (whether you are a gamer or someone who knows a gamer) while being just different enough from the other two to be new.

 Even if you aren't familiar with gaming, you still might enjoy these movies based on their own merits of good acting, fast pacing and entertaining dialogue and story. They are memorable for their honesty and sincerity and are a lot of fun to watch. While costing less than 1% of a typical Hollywood production, DGP films are far more worthy of your time and money, especially if you believe that the best movies are FUN movies.",1306972800,,1091,4.696335078534031
4436711,4,B004O6I6OS,"While it's not as good as the ""dorkness rising"" videos it is funny.  I'd have preferred a full story, as it's just part of a story but it definitely has it's moments.",1306454400,,166,4.1875
4436712,5,B004O6I6OS,Definitely a must for fantasy fans with a sense of humor. Manages to be funny without turning into a stupid web show,1305763200,,116,4.318181818181818
4436713,5,B004O6I6OS,"I found out about JourneyQuest randomly on the net and since then I'm truly hooked.
If you like role-playing games or medieval times with magic and quests surrounded by great humor, then you should definitely watch it!

The DVD makes the whole first season a great moment.

It's also a good way to make sure the second season will come as well ;)",1304985600,,346,4.476190476190476
4436714,5,B004O6I6OS,"JourneyQuest is one of the new breed of homebrew projects that just didn't exist until very recently, - very professionally written, acted and directed, but made as a labour of love on a very tight budget, hoping that DVD sales will pay to make the next series.

It's a fantasy romp featuring orcs, a particularly hapless wizard, an elf with a future, an unlucky cleric, a secretive bard and Glorion, a fighter with HONOR!

The characters are well presented, and despite a screen time of only 45 minutes and the amount of plot that is fitted in, you do get a good feel for each character, and care about what happens to them.

The writing is generally excellent, containing some nice ideas, and giving the feel that this is a true epic fantasy world despite not seeing many characters on screen. It also presents rules and background that makes it feel like much more than just-another-fantasy-world.

The acting is inspired, Brian Lewis and Christian Doyle have come a long way since Dorkness Rising, (another excellent video), and turn in beat perfect performances. Kevin Pitman is excellent playing Glorion-the-possibly-psychotic, and Emilie Rommel Shimkus makes a wonderful bard, even though much of the time she is acting by herself. Anne Kennedy plays the offish elf maiden excellently, and the supporting cast was great too, Jeremy Spray, Scott C. Brown and a woefully underused Nathan Rice in particular. My only gripe would be Samara Lerman, who did her best with the only piece of two dimensional writing in the script, but couldn't quite manage to pull it off.

Directing such a production, with very limited time and money must present a huge challenge, and Matt Vancil generally did a great job. Having said that, the beach scene feels a little forced, and could have done with a little more work, though this is only noticable because of the consistently high quality of the other scenes. Inevitably in such a low budget production, all bow and arrow related actions looked hammy at best.

The attention to detail is remarkable given the budget, especially the invention of the ""Modern Orcish"" language from scratch.

Overall, JourneyQuest is a wonderfully funny, clever, well written, well acted, well directed and above all, fun video, which I'd heartily recommend to anyone looking for something a little different from the pap on network television.

Can't wait for series two!",1304467200,2,2395,4.984962406015038
4436715,5,B004O6I6OS,"Great quality video. Superb acting. Fun story. Amazing Orc-speak (especially from the yellow robe). This is far too enjoyable to miss and don't spare it on the elderly, they will love it too!

Seriously, I can not wait for more from the great people. Keep up the good work!",1302480000,4,273,4.571428571428571
4436716,5,B004O6I6OS,"JourneyQuest is ambitious project. The high production value (it's better than Dorkness Rising, but not quite up to network tv) means that it is not a cheap series to produce- and yet, they did produce the first season, on their own dime. Now it's up to us! Watch part or all of it online (Yes! They support this!) then come back and buy the dvd. You not only get to watch the whole thing in movie mode, but there are also some really fantastic extras (including a teaser for season 2).

The thing I really love about this project is their 'No Studio, No Cancellation' tagline- if we want more, we don't have to worry that a network or studio will bury it, we can support it ourselves! So buy it! Share it! Let's keep it going!",1302220800,21,727,4.306569343065694
4436717,5,B004O6I6OS,"You will love JourneyQuest.  It's a great continuation of the fantasy gaming comedy that started with The Gamers.  Don't let the production value fool you, the budget may be low but the acting and writing raise it up pretty high. If you liked the Lord of the Rings movies, any movie by Mel Brooks, books by Terry Pratchett, and good goofy humor, then this is the film and the film makers for you.

Matt Vancil once again proves his writing ability, and shows a steady improvement in directing, and brings to mind the early gorilla style filmmaking of Kevin Smith. The cast of characters really bring this piece together.  Each actor could easily star in a big league hollywood movie.

If you haven't seen, watch it.  You will not regret it.",1301961600,11,740,4.6106870229007635
4436718,5,B004O6I6OS,"As much as I hate budget films in general, this one makes an excellent exception.

4436723,4,B004O6I6OS,"And I mean that in the best possible way. The film-makers here, knowing their tight budget would limit many things, decided to accept and ""go for the gold"" making stuff like the ""not ready for the big screen"" special effects and bad costuming a feature not a bug.

Quite possibly the best D&D series ever done, with Iconic Characters and much tongue in cheek humor.  The acting is mostly surprisingly good. I swear I have played with these guys.

I am looking forward to season 2!",1342396800,2,480,4.558139534883721
4436724,5,B004O6I6OS,"One of the most fun indie creations I've ever seen.  The comedic writing is what makes the series (don't tune in for the special effects or fight scenes, although even there I'd say it rivals the Syfy channel).  You can tell the actors are just having a good time together, which makes for good chemistry, which makes for good comedic timing.  This one is destined to become a cult classic.",1330646400,,390,4.542857142857143
4436725,5,B004O6I6OS,"it's Dead Gentlemen Productions/Zombie Orpheus Entertainment.  if you like t, you love it.  if not, then jsut watch something else.  understanding that they have never had any funding until recently (new kickstarter donation campaign for ssn 2/3) might make people appreciate what these folks doa  little more.",1323388800,2,310,5.531914893617022
4436726,4,B004O6I6OS,"""This may very well be the least heroic party ever chronicled,"" laments the web series' resident bard who aches to record an epic narrative but got stuck with this party of yahoos. When the wicked monarch of the land hired this bunch to procure and destroy a mystical sword fated to someday topple this current regime, who knew a year would elapse and still without any results to show? The meek bard Wren, who'd been shadowing these questers, is pretty fed up.

Perf (Christian Doyle), a scrawny sorry excuse for a spell caster, comes off like a kindred spirit of  Rincewind, Discworld's cowardly wizard. And I wouldn't doubt it that Terry Pratchett's works have inspired the creators of JOURNEYQUEST. Perf fills in the wizard's slot in this fellowship, even though he's only managed to memorize three spells, one of which is for conjuring milk. His group pursued by orcs, Perf would've normally already abandoned the quest except that he harbors a crush on the cute bow-wielding elfmaiden Nara (Anne Kennedy). Naturally, Nara despises Perf.

JOURNEYQUEST Season One opens with our adventurers finally stumbling across the dreaded Temple of All Dooms in which awaits the ancient evil artifact, the Sword of Fighting. But if you think this web series then follows the expected arc of a high fantasy epic, you'd not be right. JOURNEYQUEST doesn't pass an opportunity to poke fun of the genre and, in doing so, travels down surprising paths. I surely didn't expect the thing that happened to the cleric. And if the funniest thing isn't the imperious but dim-as-a-cave warrior overcoming his obstacles in oblivious fashion, then it has to be Perf's impromptu imparting of grammar lessons to a gang of orcs while engaging them in a fire fight (and by engaging, I mean that he cowers behind a tree).

The masterminds behind GAMERS and DORKNESS RISING have produced a top-flight web series and have populated it with curious characters: a disinclined hero, a consecrated zombie, a ninja-type bounty hunter, a really snarky magic sword... With a new web series popping up on the net more frequently than Nara, an observer of the obvious, says ""You should see this,"" it's becoming a job to sift thru to the good 'uns. JOURNEYQUEST unveils a narrative arc that isn't as linear as you think and peppers it with plenty of humorous jabs and barbs. And if the production values aren't quite Pixarlicious or Michael Bey-ish, so what? What really works is that the actors manage to commit to their roles and yet be tongue-in-cheek when called for. So if it's quality of work that determines the strength of fan support - which then directly translates to solvency - then look for JOURNEYQUEST to hang around for quite a few seasons. Sod the quest? No, not yet, please.

The DVD's plentiful bonus features include, among others, a 17-minute gag reel, 7 audio commentaries (8 if you count R.L. McSterlingthong & Jen Page's in the DVD ROM contents), and fan submissions such as an animated version of episode one's opening passage.",1321142400,2,3013,4.9
4436727,5,B004O6I6OS,"The Dead Gentlemen, comedians and nerds extraordinaire, have brought us another triumph.  I've got Demon Hunters, Demon Hunters II Dead Camper Lake, The Gamers, and The Gamers Dorkness Rising, and I had started to despair that my favorite indie acting troupe had split up and quit producing the indie films I still drag unsuspecting guests to go see.  Then I saw this on Hulu and needed a copy of my very own.

This short little indie flick, assembled from webisodes, is intelligent, funny, and layered.  It's got enough straight-up humor for the uninitiated layered over in-jokes for the hard-core gamer or Dead Gentleman fans.  Every time I show this video to someone I find some new little nuance to laugh at, and the jokes have some staying power.  The actors are older now, and they're no longer over-doing things in every scene.

I could rave about the individual characters and ideas for paragraphs (wizard robes reflecting Karate belt colors), or say that any gamer who has ever run a dungeon crawl MUST see how Glory solves the dungeon's puzzles.  The Orcs steal several scenes, and the running commentary from the magic sword had me in tears.

The concept is interesting, and the production values are high.

This series follows in the footsteps of on-line gamer related series such as Neil, the Guild, etc.

This is a fun series to watch for the gaming crowd.

** beware spoilers follow **

It took me about halfway though the DVD to figure out what was going on.

There was a bard who was chronicling the Party.  The Party was theoretically aiding a not-so-bright fighter, but after an ork ambush the cleric is killed, and the ranger and mage characters find a shortcut into the dungeon of infinite dooms.

This allows the cowardly Perf, the mage, to become the wielder of the Sword of Fighting.

Perf tries to resurrect the cleric, but the spell backfires and brings the cleric back as a sentient undead -- oh no!

Through a series of misadventures, the fighter makes his way through the dungeon of doom only to find out that Perf has stolen the Sword of Fighting already.
