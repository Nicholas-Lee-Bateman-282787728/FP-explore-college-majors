8525681,2,B0085QNMJ2,"Thanks to the WWE Network, I was able to relive an event in the fifth Clash Of The Champions which was titled ""St. Valentine's Day Massacre.""  Now for those who don't already know, the Clash Of The Champions events were the NWA/WCW's equivalent of WWE's ""Saturday Night's Main Event/The Main Event"" where it was a big event broadcast for free on cable which in this case was the warm-up to the upcoming Chi-Town Rumble PPV less than a week later.  It should also be noted that along with the matches during this event was a big angle were Ric Flair came out in an expensive suit with lovely ladies to have a verbal confrontation with Ricky Steamboat that lead to a physical one where Steamboat literally beat the pants (and other clothing) off of Flair.

Midnight Express vs. Russian Assassins - Paul E. Dangerously was on commentary for this match as the Express had the early advantage keeping a fast pace & frequent tags while staying one step ahead of their opponents including using them against each other with Cornette on the outside not being afraid to get his shots in as well as Jones getting hit as well before the Assassins were able to slow down the pace & keep breaking the Express' momentum focusing on one part of the body on one of their opponents using their power or illegal tactics whenever possible in a solid tag team match with the only real negative being that they went to commercial & you never saw the finish to the match.

Steven Casey vs. Butch Reed - Casey was being built as ""undefeated"" coming into this match as he was able to gain early offense here using his superior quickness to his advantage when it came to reversing Reed's offense as both men used the same tactics against each other to neutralize each other's strengths while Reed resorting to taking shortcuts & using his power to keep the momentum in his favor as this was a match that never left first gear & went too long for what it was designed to be.

Lex Luger vs. The Blackmailer - Luger was set to challenge Barry Windham at the upcoming PPV so Hiro Matsuta hired & was in the corner of The Blackmailer as Luger showcased his power offense along with easily shaking off whatever The Blackmailer gave him while not only showcasing some strategy that he would use against Windham but also using some of Windham's own signature maneuvers as his own resulting in this being exactly what it was designed to be in a ""preview"" of what was to come for Windham at the PPV.

NWA United States Tag Team Champions Varsity Club vs. The Fantastics - This was the rematch from Starrcade with Rotunda replacing Sullivan as the Varsity Club dominated with Williams strength & Rotunda's wrestling ability as they kept the pace slow & grounding them also using some illegal double teaming & working them over on the outside while The Fantastics kept up a faster pace with using the strategy of ""hit & move"" using their athleticism & double team offense of their own including being able to use their opponents own momentum against them in a back & forth competitive match.

Ricky Steamboat vs. Bob Bradley - Bradley was able to get some offense in but this was just a short offensive exhibition for Steamboat that's only noteworthy for the mixed reaction Steamboat got.

Rick Steiner vs. Rip Morgan - This was a non-Television Championship match that was a short back & forth match with Steiner showcasing his style of mixing power with amateur offense.

NWA Six Man Tag Team Champions Road Warriors & Tenryu vs. Varsity Club - The challengers were originally suppose to be Sting & Junkyard Dog & Michael Hayes but they were locked backstage allowing the Varsity Club to take their place in what the commentators called the ""the bullies vs. the bullies"" as it was a quick six way brawl with each team exchanging big hits against each other before the original challengers were able to make it out ending this in a nine way brawl between everyone involved as this was just an angle to officially make the Road Warriors babyfaces again (since the crowd never stopped cheering them when they were heels anyways) while it should be noted that this was the last appearance of Tenyru forcing the titles to be vacated & inactive for an extended period of time after this match.

This was one of those events where it was a ""one match show"" with that one match being the U.S. Tag Team Title match along with the other thing to watch on here was the Flair/Steamboat confrontation & comparing the different crowd reactions to Steamboat when they went back & forth verbally before getting into it physically.  Past those two, this was pretty much a prime time edition of their weekly TV show with the matches pretty much speaking for themselves based off who's competing against whom & a main event that was only an angle.  It should also be noted that I noticed more than ever on this show that they kept cutting away from the match to show the crowd more than ever before including one shot of a couple not even watching the match & making out with each other which got annoying throughout the show.  In the end, I stated it previously that there was really only one match & one angle worth watching here but a show you can easily skip past that.",1416355200,,5219,4.580921757770632
