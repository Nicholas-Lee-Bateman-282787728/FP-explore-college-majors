These are really great short stories about a wide range of topics that I  found very engaging and heart-felt. It used to be hard to get gay indie shorts and this collection includes a lot of my favorites.

I'm not sure what the negative reviewers were looking for but I think these films are great and many reviews for the separate dvds of the series are positive. Now you can have 5 series at a lower price.",1416096000,,562,4.333333333333333
8144725,1,B000IB12BC,"Don't buy this item.  From reviews that I had seen of the various Boys Life series, I was anticipating touching, heartfelt stories about the coming out process.  Instead, it is a series of very poor quality videos whose content is so poorly created and executed that they are absolutely worthless and devoid of any entertainment value.  Of course, they are a bit variable.  Some are completely nonsensical and incoherent.  Others look as though they might have potential, but end before anything develops.  None, however, makes the purchase worthwhile.  It is a complete was of your money and, if you watch them, they are a complete waste of your time.  Pass this item by.",1241913600,,672,4.884955752212389
8144726,3,B000IB12BC,"There is no porn showing on these DVD's however some of them are very steamy! I thought each disc would be like that in the series and it was not...the best ones are the beginning of the series, and not the end. The first discs are about coming out and that first time for all of us. The last ones are more depressing dealing with issues in a gay life.",1236816000,,352,4.042857142857143
