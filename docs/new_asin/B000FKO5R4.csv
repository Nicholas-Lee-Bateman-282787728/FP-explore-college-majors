2570208,5,B000FKO5R4,"The movie plot compensates for the terrible acting by Lucas Black, he looks constipated & no amount of fibre is gonna pull him out of it... but guess what? Lucas Black failing to deliver on acting is exactly what this movie required to make it acceptable &/or believable. LOL.  Good/Bad Job, Lucas...! Horribly Amazing.  ...Now excuse me while I watch it again, yes.. it's that bad.",1152230400,3,382,4.7727272727272725
2570209,5,B000FKO5R4,"I never would of thought this movie was a low budget movie. It looked very professional and the acting was great. The plot was very interesting. Nat(Lucas Black) meets Finch(Peter Coyote) who seems very suspicious throughout the movie. Nat remains confused about Finch through the entire movie. The ending is never what you would of expected. I thought Peter Coyote had the best peformance in this movie especially the line ""We have a situation."" Overall A+ to this movie. Then after I watched the movie I read the book and it was even better then the movie. I highly recommend both Deepwater's.",1149984000,12,595,4.8431372549019605
2570210,1,B000FKO5R4,"Story unrelentlingly violent, little character development, unlikely story (I don't often say that), mental health aspects of story so dated. Caters to those who enjoy violence and murky intrigue.",1205020800,3,196,5.793103448275862
2570211,4,B000FKO5R4,"This movie will keep you on edge. All the characters are at least slightly tilt. All of them seem to have the potential to turn truly dangerous.

Peter Coyote comes across as being the most likely one to tip this uneasy ensemble of characters into deep water. He assumes an unnaturally gravelly voice for this role. But he otherwise carves a convincing portrait as the owner of a flagging motel business. As he wheels and deals on the side as a ruthless loan shark and casino backer, you increasingly feel he is not someone you would want to cross. His need to maintain his position as Alpha Male despite his years - his penchant for perpetrating cruel practical jokes and the raucous glee he takes in their execution - all this makes him the kind of character we want to back away from.

Then there's Mia Maestro as his much younger wife. She seems to have stepped out of a 1940s film noire. She's the kind of woman who was often named ""Lola"" in those films and who usually proved to be playing her own dangerous game with the detective as patsy.

In this case, we fear the patsy might be Lucas Black`s character, a young man who's just been released limping from the hospital and who immediately gets himself embroiled as a handyman in the unwholesome dynamic at Coyote's motel. But we see that he too is veering into his own dangerous obsessions.

This is a well-made, more-intelligent-than-average suspense drama. It kept me tautly balancing, like someone sitting in a small canoe in choppy waters. And it gave me a real feel for what it must be like to have a troubled psyche and to be looking at the world through broken glass.",1174262400,13,1633,4.54421768707483

2570213,5,B000FKO5R4,"I had seen this at its premiere. It was a great representation of the book. It even adds a few things to make the story more interesting. The director introduced the characters and set up the conflict very well. It has a turn of events that will shock you guaranteed. Anybody who is a fan of suspence films will love this movie. Worth a rental, sure. Worth a buy, definately.",1160697600,7,375,4.371428571428571
2570214,3,B000FKO5R4,This low budget Indie Film was agood attempt at a dark feeling film. I liked the feeling of betrayal as the audience slowly figures out that Nat was the guilty one. Although I generally don't like camera trickery to set up moods in a film this one seemed to work out. Over all a dark suspencefull film with a good twist at the end.,1158624000,3,331,4.1875
2570215,4,B000FKO5R4,"I watch the movie, however somehow my dvd player continued to freeze up on several different dics that I used. I even change players to see if that works, but no! I did see portions of the movie when it froze, I moved forward to the next frame. I love what I did see. Lucas was pretty mental and anal. The ending was good and threw me for a loop. I'm trying to get a good copy so that I can relax and not get cut short. It's a good movie, a thrill, adventure, suspense, cunning, deceptively mining and with a preety good script.",1154476800,5,528,4.086538461538462
2570216,2,B000FKO5R4,"Nat Banyon played by Lucas Black (Sling Blade, Jarhead) is just released from a hospital. He steals a car and winds up saving the life of a guy named Herman Finch played by Peter Coyote (The 4400, Sphere). When Black is arrested because he stold the car Coyote bails him out and has Black do work around his Motel that he owns. Mia Maestro (Alias, Poseidon) plays Iris a maid who Black falls for. Coyote has Black train for a fight in which the two will go head to head against each other. Black doesnt want to fight Coyote and he soon finds out that Coyote might be a dangerous person since dead bodies happen to pop up. Interesting but story gets tiresome as it goes along until the ending. Black is in nice form but he needs to work more on his acting. I wasn't feeling his performance in this. Coyote livens the movie up as usual and the beautiful Mia Maestro has her beauty but she's done much better. Also starring Lesley Ann Warren (Clue, Teaching Mrs. Tingle), Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars, Pulse), Dee Snider (Strangeland), Jason Cerbone (Paper Soldiers, Shade), Xander Berkeley (Air Force One, 24) and Michael Ironside (Starship Troopers, Major Payne)",1154476800,10,1160,4.635922330097087
2570217,4,B000FKO5R4,"This is not my genre of choice, but I got hooked early on and was totally surprised at the ending. I told myself as I watched the movie that movies should be entertaining and determined I was. I will never forget this movie. If you like Psycho-drama, you will love this flick. It is psycho alright, but who is actually crazy will surprise you.",1153958400,8,343,4.375
2570218,5,B000FKO5R4,"Here's a film in which the mood is at least as important as the story.  I came across it because I heard the score was done by Charlie Clouser of Nine Inch Nails.  To my surprise, it's the best use of Nine Inch Nails music since the title sequence of ""Se7en"".  The story and the music are like an inseparable force pulling you toward... madness?  They really got the dark vibe thing working.

Story concerns a drifter who gets a job painting an old motel in this rural town.  On one level it's like a 1950's thriller, but it also feels like it's on acid.  We watch the main character go through his daily routine, but it's always like there's this huge, horrible thing looming around him.  And when we figure out what that thing is, the film achieves some old-school catharsis.  There may be some rough spots along the way, but unlike a lot of recent films that rely on cheap ""twist"" endings, Deepwater's twist is the real deal.  Well worth watching, and LISTENING.",1153958400,21,965,4.462857142857143
2570219,5,B000FKO5R4,"I totally want to hang out with Nat Banyon!  (if you know what I mean)  Lucas Black makes even a psycho seem HOT.  But really, all the characters are genuine, likeable and intriguing.  This movie sticks with you long after you've seen it.  The tension and suspense are amplified by the kick ass music.  I didn't hit the pause button even once.  More work from this director, pleeeeease!",1153612800,5,386,4.588235294117647

8124004,3,B000FKO5R4,"Deepwater (2005) is a thriller, keeping viewers guessing until when
the story is well underway, with plenty of suspense and action in
between.

The study of human rapport in an environment of limited
information, mystery, and where a frank and open discussion of day
to day dealings is prohibited is the core. It is also coupled with
a newcomer and various parties each coming up with their best
guesses on the underlying motives and on what is truely happening
around them.  ""Best guess"" is the key phrase here, in building the
story and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.

Mia Maestro's character, is remarkable and speaks volumes from her
visual impact, natural feel, rapport built and presence with the
other characters, turning them real.

Peter Coyote, as Finch does a wonderful job as a veteran mobster
who is a key figure in the underlying operations of a casino on an
Native reserve,  collecting illegal debts, receiving payoffs,
loansharking to local honest businesses, skimming profits for top
bosses, and more. His influence with the local Sherrif is decisive
in terms of who is detained or not, as well.

Next, this film projects a strong sentiment of isolation. It stems
from the very isolated community featured, but also from the
""hazing"" (also seen in military bootcamps) felt by those who are
dropped into small groups, with tremendous unknowns - at least
initially. Lucas Black,  plays a youth who is released from
detention, and assigned to rebuild his life after some time away
from freedom, thereby doubling the challenge at hand.

Black's character is then given a valuable opportunity to
demonstrate his work ethic, ability to learn, to take in stride
various challenges, such as paying down a vehicle in return for his
labor in doing various handyman tasks (painting, cleaning,
carpentry, driving and being Coyote's personal assistant, etc.)

The compulsion to gamble is the least of concerns as an entire town
(small shops, restaurants, and more) depends on the consumer using
up all their savings at the slot machines.

Naturally, the youth tries his hand at deciphering how deep and
significant are Maestro's flings with him, considering that he has
to deal with her official story of wanting out of her relationship
with Coyote or her tasks as a hotel house keeper vs. doing what
Coyote's wanted her to do (have the flings?) or privately going
outside of marriage with the mobster.

The outcome of the story needs to be seen to be appreciated.

Finally, the film is not wide-screen, and lacks subtitles. However,
footage quality is valuable, notably the moments chosen in filming
the action, the relaxed atmosphere, the hint at an egomanical
authority being exerted by some individuals, of cliques, clans, and
everyone having to learn their role and limitations in that area
and managing those relationships, and the outdoor settings.",1252800000,,2872,5.04862579281184
8124005,5,B000FKO5R4,"Wow! For a movie that seemed to drag in parts, it certainly set itself up for a completely unexpected ending. This has got to be the most daring twist-ending of the year, and they pulled it off without a hitch. It utterly took me by surprise. The entire movie held an eerie, creepy atmosphere. I loved it! I can't really say anymore about it without revealing its secrets. If you like endings that can't be guessed, you'll love Deep Water.",1251676800,2,439,4.5
8124006,3,B000FKO5R4,"**1/2 2005. This film was based on Matthew F. Jones's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deepwater-A-Novel/dp/1582340595/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deepwater: A Novel</a>&nbsp;and was written and directed by David S. Marfield. A young man is heading to Wyoming when he meets Herman Finch, a man who seems to have the town of Deepwater in his pocket. Soon, two persons who had dared contradict Finch are found murdered. DEEPWATER is a B movie with two well-known actors such as Peter Coyote and Lesley-Anne Warren in its cast, the other actors being either promising newcomers (Lucas Black) or TV performers (Mia Maestro and Xander Berkeley). The result is no more than average but, still, DEEP WATER is worth seeing if you're curious. The film belongs to this special kind of movies that make you say after its ending : "" Gee! now I know why the director insisted on that scene at this moment or filmed this action with a shaking camera "" and so on. So every detail, scene or dialogue of DEEP WATER is meaningful. In short, I had the strange feeling to have had the opportunity to be in the head of Michael Myers for a while with DEEP WATER.
