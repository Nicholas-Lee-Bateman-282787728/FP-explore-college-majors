8424667,5,B000LMPNBI,"I was fortunate enough to catch this late at night when it was on CBC.  For any Law & Order fan, it's easy to see that this performance by Sam Waterston was his audition for his role as Jack McCoy.  What was fascinating is that the characters in both Law & Order and in this movie were much the same in that the courtroom performance of both characters were much the same.  The gestures were the same, as well as the type of questions asked, the ""looks"" that Waterston delivers as McCoy, etc.  However, the performance was actually much better in this movie.  You can see the passion and raw energy that Waterston delivers better in this movie than it is in his now comfortable Law & Order role.  I found the acting riveting, the script intelligent and pertinent; all in all it was one of the best movie's I've seen recently.",1191110400,2,825,4.394736842105263
8424668,4,B000LMPNBI,"This movie seems to be almost completely unknown, which is unfortunate as it's a pretty good movie, at least if you like thought-provoking movies about international current events.

I chanced upon this movie by accident. I found it for sale on DVD at a flea market for $3 and took a chance and bought it. When I tried to read about it on IMDb (The Internet Movie Database) I found only three reviews! (Most movies at IMDb have dozens or even hundreds of reviews.) And here at Amazon there were no reviews at all.

Let's start with the basic facts. This is a made-for-TV movie from 1988. The original title was ""Terrorist on Trial: The United States vs. Salim Ajami"". It is being sold on DVD in the USA, the UK, Scandinavia and perhaps elsewhere as ""Hostile Witness"", and in Australia as ""In the Hands of the Enemy"". The Scandinavian version that I watched was 125 minutes (too long), while the version being sold in the USA is apparently 100 minutes.

The story is about a Palestinian terrorist named Salim Ajami (Robert Davi) who has been kidnapped in Beirut by American Special Forces personnel and transported to the USA to stand trial for the murder of four American tourists in Spain.

The movie starts with Salim Ajami's arrival in the USA. We see discussions at the Justice Department and the recruitment of a defense lawyer (Ron Leibman) and a prosecution attorney (Sam Waterston). We follow both sides as they prepare for the trial. Then the movie becomes a courtroom drama, and finally the verdict is handed down.

This is not typical light entertainment, and many people may consider it to be boring.

There are many thought-provoking ideas being considered here.

- Does the United States have the right to kidnap a suspected criminal in another country and bring him/her to the USA to stand trial? (What if Danish police kidnapped an American in Los Angeles and brought him to Copenhagen to stand trial?)

- When is a terrorist a terrorist, and when is he a soldier or a freedom-fighter? (Or an ""insurgent"" or an ""enemy combatant"" to use the current labels?)

- Was dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in Japan in the Second World War an act of terrorism?

- What can explain the mentality of the Middle East activists who kill innocent people and expect that this will aid their cause?

It is especially this last question that the movie tries to explore. On one hand it is made obvious that Salim Ajami is responsible for unspeakable acts of terrorism, killing and injuring innocent American tourists. On the other hand Salim Ajami comes across as intelligent and articulate, maintaining that he is a soldier who is fighting using a new kind of warfare.

The movie does a fairly good job of giving the viewer the information that allows us to understand Salim Ajami, although not accepting his deeds. This is provided by Salim Ajami's own testimony about the conditions in the Palestinian refugee camps, by descriptions of how Western military operations have killed many Arab civilians, and by the explanations of an Iranian living in the USA about how Arab resentment towards Western colonialism makes any Arab fighter a hero.

This movie was made almost 20 years ago at a time when most people in the West had almost no knowledge of Middle East affairs. As such it was fairly daring. Today we have much more knowledge and many more opinions due to the Gulf War, the 9/11-2001 terrorist attacks, the toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the establishment of the Guantnamo Bay detainment camp and the on-going Iraq War.

Still, even though it is dated it is a pretty good movie for those who like thought-provoking stories that attempt to explain the terrorist mentality. The acting and direction is good and the story is believable.
