8086116,5,B000BF2ZWA,"This show is by far the best video documentation of Alice in concert I have ever seen. Everytime I see this I envy those fortunate to have seen this. To see the master so vigorously reclaiming his throne in person at a time when the general public began to think he was a nostalgia act would have surely been an experience. Anyone that went to a show on this tour expecting to see a tired routine of the golden oldies of the seventies went out with a well implanted fear of the ambition and determination of the performer he or she just watched.
This dvd should be shown as a documentation of how a concert should be performed and why we line up and pay our hard earned money to see the voices permeating through our speakers at all hours of the night in our endless persuit of life.",1214006400,,783,4.261744966442953

8086118,5,B000BF2ZWA,"For those of you who might remember, this was the show that MTV had broadcast on Halloween night, 1986. Later it was put out on VHS. After a four year break, Alice had apparently decided to give his fans what they wanted, a return to the 'old Cooper type' show. Seventeen cuts here to thrill and amaze you. This is the tour that Kip Winger was on bass. Tracks that made this concert so worthy were the opener ""Welcome To My Nightmare"", ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"", ""Be My Lover"", ""Cold Ethyl"", ""Ballad Of Dwight Frye"", the rarely performed (anymore) ""Sick Things"", ""I Love The Dead"" and ""School's Out"". There are also three tunes from his new (at the time) 'Constrictor' album. Good picture and sound quality. A must-have for all Alice Cooper fans, completists and collectors alike.",1141430400,3,777,4.63768115942029
