4717967,5,B005KMKFH6,"For those who are tired of the bravado and unbelievable death-defying heroics of many war movies, THE SEA SHALL NOT HAVE THEM is a breath of fresh air.  It tells the story of one Air-Sea Rescue launch manned by men of the Royal Air Force.  Their mission is to rescue the crew of a downed Lockheed Hudson bomber, one of whom played by Michael Redgrave, has documents which must not fall into enemy hands. In a role usually given to the likes of Richard Attenborough, Dirk Bogarde is the whining complainer who makes life even more miserable for those in the floating rubber dinghy.  Bit by bit, we get to know all of the men on the rescue launch, their personal problems and just how well they do their jobs.  As the film nears its climax, we wonder if the rescuers will reach the dinghy before it drifts on to the German-occupied Dutch coast and will they survive the murderous barrage from the shore batteries.  This is a film which explores human strengths and failings rather than being just another war action movie.  If you've never seen it, it will show you a little-known branch of the armed forces and the important work that they did.",1339200000,4,1143,4.524271844660194
8476962,3,B005KMKFH6,"This film closely follows the book of the same name by John Harris. It covers a little known aspect of the air war during WW 11.
Like virtually all the contemporary British immediate post war films it is in black and white , but this doesn't detract from the story.
Some of the special effects are crude by today's standards but  a surprising degree of authenticity has been achieved in the depiction of the RAF marine rescue craft and the RN Sea Otter substituting for a Walrus amphibian in use at the time of the story . (All now replaced  by the ubiquitous helicopter.) Surprisingly, the sinking Lockheed Hudson was not a model .
Although there is an excellent cast some of the script and acting is a bit substandard ,which is a pity because there is an interesting mix of characters .",1410566400,,788,4.503496503496503

8476965,2,B005KMKFH6,"I bought this because I remembered how I loved it as a child. Oh dear. Big mistake. Its OK I suppose...not much of a story though. The quality of this DVD is pretty dreadful and it certainly does NOT warrant the hefty price tag that is usually applied to newly released films on DVD. Don't waste your money unless you really, really, REALLY want this.",1376092800,,351,4.415384615384616
8476966,5,B005KMKFH6,"This film is a black and white masterpiece from the 1950s. The story of a British bomber crew down in the North Sea drifting in their rubber raft for two days as they wait for rescue, capture, or death. We learn a bit about each guy, but are spared the detailed flashbacks to detail their lives. One fellow an Air Commodore with the secret papers brief case handcuffed to his wrist is played by Sir Michael Redgrave. Another, the R/T operator who is not sure the SOS was received is Dirk Bogarde . Other faces are familiar if you view British films of this era. While they wait, we ride along with the crew of a RAF rescue launch...a PT type boat designed for water rescues of downed airmen. Will they save the raft occupants before hypothermia kills them, they drift into a German minefield, or back onto the Enemy held coast of Holland? See the movie...you'll enjoy it right down to the last minute.
A real plus is the fact the movie has all of the proper WWII vintage equipment to use, and it's shown on film for the public to see for what was the first time. The rescue launches, the Sunderland patrol plane, the Walrus seaplane looking for the lost British airmen finding the (properly dressed an equipped) Luftwaffe fighter pilot that shot the bomber down at the start of the movie! The extensive time spent aboard the RAF rescue boat is great. For a scale modeler, aviation, nautical, or history nut, it's a must see.",1370563200,,1424,4.501930501930502
8476967,3,B005KMKFH6,"To be fair, this film is hard to be excited about in 2013 because of the style and how the story is presented.  Our modern war movies are much more realistic and we are a much more demanding audience than when this movie was made.  Still, it covers true life situations which real men lived and I watched it with interest.",1360800000,,322,4.262295081967213
8476968,5,B005KMKFH6,Great movie about the RAF. Good parts in this movie of the RAF Air Sea Rescue and what those men had to go though.,1359590400,,114,3.7916666666666665
8476969,3,B005KMKFH6,This movie is about a rescue boat crew and the crew of an aircraft that have to ditch in the sea.  The rescue boat breaks down and delays the rescue of the air crew that are now in a bad way from exposure to the elements.  Michael Redgrave has an admirable performance but all in all this movie is poorly shot and lacks realistic drama.  Only interesting from a standpoint of post war Britain.  Don't waste your money on buying it.,1353888000,,431,4.283950617283951
8476970,5,B005KMKFH6,"Great movie for the war buff, who likes world war 2 movies. It shows the battle the sides had to win. THANKS",1352073600,,108,3.9545454545454546
8476971,5,B005KMKFH6,"I have not seen this movie in 30 years. But I remember it is a classic British WWII movie in the very low key ""just chaps doing their part"" kind of way. What makes this movie unique is that it is about the very brave souls of the RAF who manned high speed boats designed to go out to sea and pick up aircrew that had crashed. Such was the need for trained pilots and other aircrew in WWII that the British expended every effort to go and recover the crews of ditched aircraft.  This is probably the only movie made about these very brave boat crews and if you are in any way interested in the heroism of the average Brit in WWII you owe it to your self to see this wonderful movie.
I will update this review when I have had a chance to see this movie again in the next few weeks.",1343952000,7,779,3.9935897435897436
