8346291,5,B001VG2M6M,"When I was pregnant with my daughter, now 16 years old, my husband and I watched this show on a loop.  The cool thing was that when we got into the delivery room, I knew not all, but most, of what the possibilities might be for her delivery.  I knew most of the terminology they would use.  I knew about so many different ways that people plan the births of their children, as well as how the plans can change at a moment's notice.

A friend of mine is now pregnant.  She is one of those people who has no cable in her home and I wanted her to see some of the stories that we saw when I was pregnant that made me so comfortable.  I hope she enjoys these as much as I enjoyed the show so many years ago.",1446076800,2,702,3.908450704225352
8346292,1,B001VG2M6M,"Got this for my pregnant wife. She hated it. This show pushes an anti-natural birth agenda, with some of the laboring mothers even being ridiculed by their doctors for going natural. Also features lots of unprofessional behavior from doctors and other staff, and some really stupid, bad calls by the docs (like administering Pitocin to a woman at 9cm). It's not just the staff that's anti-natural- even the title sequence makes a comment about natural birth being scary and dangerous.

To be clear, this is not an educational show. Do not expect to get any information out of it. This just shows some couples laboring. If that's what you're looking for, my wife recommends the BBC show One Born Every Minute (you can even find it on some video sites).",1433289600,,751,4.776923076923077
