8513442,3,B007AKDQMC,"Xie Jing is one of China's fourth generation film directors (educated during Sino-Chinese War in Chongching -- WWII) and directed movies for over 50 years.

Movie is about a professional women's soccer team -- unusual based on a male-dominate society -- seeking talent and recognition.  Within the team there are personality conflicts, marital conflict within coach's marriage, team training, etc.  Probably partially based on true events:  Chinese team plays against a Japanese team in Japan and experiences discrimination.

Moderate recommendation based on director and performance by Kechun Li (coach's wife), and one professional player used in movie.",1378684800,,655,5.711340206185567
