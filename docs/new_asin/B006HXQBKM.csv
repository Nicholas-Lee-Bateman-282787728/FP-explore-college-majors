I had been searching for something nature-focused, that wasn't obnoxious -- like so many children's ""educational"" programs are these days, filling with loud, blaring music, animations (or worse, digital renderings... as if even cartoons aren't modern enough for today's children), or sappy, stereotypical kinds of early childhood content. My husband and I want to raise our son with little to no television, save at times of utmost need, and we want to raise our son to be curious about, delighted by and have a deep respect for nature.

This production by Knowing&Growing absolutely fits the bill.... I can't say enough just how wonderful it is. The music is gentle, soothing -- at times a mildly brooding or pensive New Age sound, at others a light and rhythmic jazzy quality, and still others an almost celestial sound evocative of starlight and the cosmos. A range of babies, toddlers and young children serve as the ""guides"" through various and sundry New Zealand ecosystems. The journey begins in the cosmos, with the waking sun, and the children who descend to earth to explore and play. They follow a stream from the mountain-tops through various habitats -- alpine stream, temperate rainforest, waterfalls descending over rocks to still pools, underwater to see different fish, lilypad pond, field and orchard, all the way to an estuary, sand dunes, ocean beach, and then onto the rock pools before a dip beneath the waves to explore some life in the oceans.

For Waldorf-minded parents -- which we feels largely describes us -- this video is absolutely perfect and fitting. The video concludes as the babies return to the cosmos at the setting of the sun, as the moon awakens for the night. I don't want to mislead about these baby ""guides"" -- it's not over-your-head or overdone. The babies are seen floating through these environments, engaging with nature, playing with pine cones, sampling fruit from the orchard -- but it's all very gentle, soothing and of great delight and interest to young children! I was very surprised at just how much my son loves watching these babies and toddlers. They don't speak, but some of them smile and wave; others are looking around or pointing at things; others play with bits of nature they have discovered.

There is an adult female narrator, and the narration itself has a gentle rhyme.... One thing I LOVE about the DVD version is that there's an option to turn off the narration and view the video with just the musical score. This is wonderful for those early mornings or late nights when our son has awoken or is having trouble relaxing, but we want to minimize the degree of stimulation.

The DVD includes three bonus features (nature alphabet, nature colors, and nature numbers) -- AND there's an option to listen to the whole video in Spanish. For parents who want a well-chosen video that imparts a sense of awe and delight in what nature has to offer, or simply want a video that is produced well and bucks some of the insidious trends in early childhood material, this video is very much money well spent.

I just wish I could find out what became of Knowing&Growing since this video was produced over a decade ago ...",1461715200,,3292,4.840142095914742

8498637,5,B006HXQBKM,"There are so many bad/poor quality children videos on the market. Many look like they are made by amateurs.  However the Knowing and Growing videos are extremely well done.  Our infant son absolutely loves them.  The video is made with backgrounds of nature.  Birds, trees, rivers...etc., are all used to teach.  I recommend this video above all of the Baby Einstein vids.  It's the best!",1393632000,,388,4.892307692307693
