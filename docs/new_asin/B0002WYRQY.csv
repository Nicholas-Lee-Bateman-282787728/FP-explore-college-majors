2128674,5,B0002WYRQY,"Another brilliant series by Paul Abbott, creator of Shameless and State Of Play.  Each episode focuses on an individual yet all are interconnected and by the last show, I was wishing the next 3 seasons were available on dvd, as I didn't want it to end.  Winner of numerous BAFTAs.",1178150400,,280,4.58

8033783,4,B0002WYRQY,This is a early Sarah Lancashire performance....still very good in lightweight story. Catch her in Happy Valley which she won a BAFTA AWARD for she is brilliant in this drama series on Netflix ....then watch her on LAST TANGO IN HALIFAX...also a BAFTA for this...she is a excellent actress!,1510876800,,290,4.938775510204081

8033785,5,B0002WYRQY,"This excellent first season (2000) of BBC's award-winning drama has many familial faces: Sarah Lancashire (Happy Valley, Last Tango in Halifax), Philip Glenister (Ashes to Ashes), Christopher Eccleston (Dr Who, Cracker), Lesley Sharp (Scott & Bailey), John Simm (Human Traffic, Prey), Siobhan Finneran (Downton Abbey, Happy Valley), Diane Parish (Corrie) and more.  Each of the six stories hold one's interest.  There are no subtitles but the accents aren't heavy and the dialogue is clear.  I share the others' frustration that the additional series aren't available on dvd.",1438473600,,575,5.586206896551724
8033786,5,B0002WYRQY,"Worked fine on a Region 1 system when I did the following: I used a Mac program to extract the episodes from the disc, then streamed them to my TV. The episodes were enjoyable to watch.",1431734400,,185,4.166666666666667

8033790,5,B0002WYRQY,"Living in australia i bought this without knowing anything about the series as it was never shown here. i was very surprised at how great it was
Ibecome involved with all the wonderful characteres from the first story
My only disappointment is i am unable to get series 2,3,or 4",1331251200,,278,4.58
8033791,4,B0002WYRQY,"Clocking Off is a wonderful series, based on the first one which is the only one available. Paul (State of Play) Abbott is a wonderful writer and keeps your interest high throughout this series of interconnected lives.

Why BBC won't release the next two parts is beyond me. There is a lot of interest on both sides of The Pond.

Very frustrating to get so into these characters and then know you can't follow them all the way, even though there are more series rotting somewhere in a BBC vault.",1281052800,,495,4.488888888888889
