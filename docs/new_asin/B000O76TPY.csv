8183320,1,B000O76TPY,"How does a movie like this even get made, when there are dozens of extremely talented directors who can't make movies because there's no money? Regardless of how little it cost to make this one, it was too much.

The two kids are very good actors, but their characters are the most obnoxious kids I've seen in ages and should have been killed off early. But then we would have been left alone with the duck-lipped Italian woman and her gross, greasy German boyfriend, and God knows: NOBODY deserves such a fate.

Watching this movie is torture! I felt like I was tied in that chair with Duckwoman for 95 minutes. The ONLY interesting thing about this movie is that her armpit hair didn't grow even a millimeter during her days of captivity. Now, does that sound like a movie worth watching?",1396310400,,790,4.556338028169014

8183322,2,B000O76TPY,"To me 'Out of Hand' contained a storyline that had potential it didn't reach.  For starters, there is no real gay or homoerotic action between the boys.  Pretty much what you see in the trailer and in the pictures on the DVD box, is all you get.  There is abundant female nudity and very breif male backside nudity.

As for storyline, I call it underdeveloped.  The boys becoming friends is awfully abrupt. The ending is also abrupt.  Situations like Paul's mother being very poor and sick or even Sebastion's little crush on Paul seem like they will be important and expanded upon, but aren't.

The movie can be slightly disturbing and explicit sexually (just not between the boys).  I'll leave it at that.

All in all, I purchased this film because it was advertised as a man/man love story, which it was not.  Setting that aside, I felt the storyline had a lot it could have expanded on, but didn't.",1340928000,2,902,4.58125
8183323,4,B000O76TPY,"it was different than a lot of the gay themed movies we see.  you see are two young teens that meet at first glance and then again later on after their meeting on the train.  they decide to head and hang with each other all the while getting into all kinds of trouble.  For one its something he hasn't done before or experienced.  The other boy its because he has everything already and is bored so he needs this things, stealing, shooting guns and kidnapping to keep him excited and interested in life.

They also have other issues back at home one lives with his mom in the lower parts of the city.  While the rich kid that has it all stays far away from there and parents are seldom around to provide any kind of structure.  They keep uping the stakes until one day after following a woman home.  They (one of them) decides to kidnap her and thats really where the story starts to heat up.  The rich kid (also interested in his friend but doesnt speak on it) and isn't interested in her in anyway other than something thats fun and funny.  The other is more inclined to sympathize with her and starts to fall for her.

I thought it was pretty interesting how its touched on but not put out there too much.  His longing and fascination with his friend, he doesnt really press it on him.  He treats him well and gives him time and attention.  All and all i found Out of Hand to be something that is watching worthy if only to see that all gay films don't have guys running in drag, speaking in a girlish tone or just fitting every label.  They put on gays in general Out of Hand...kept the story in hand,acted nicely and directed also in a way that allowed the actor/actresses to do their thing and add something to their character.",1190851200,11,1733,4.305555555555555
