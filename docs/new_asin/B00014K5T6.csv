8006322,5,B00014K5T6,"Of course, it's a shocking, sexual movie. And it's unconventional sex.

Okay, a spoiler, revealed early-on: The plot spins around hermaphrodites.

Yet it's elegantly and tastefully done, more into human drives and emotions than simply sex, to create a sophisticated adult romantic melodrama. The sophisticated graphics and intelligent, believable scripting raise this movie and its topic above a film aimed only to titillate and shock. The unusual graphics create a tense aura that add to the eroticism and an other-worldly feeling.

For those interested in the genre, cruise through Japanese
films. Mostly, they're non-exploitative yet pretty hot.",1203465600,,648,5.65979381443299
8006323,5,B00014K5T6,I knew that this movie was going to be awkward. I really liked it. Noone will watch it with me so i watched it alone. I'm really into these kind of movies. Homosexuality and stuff. Its my thing. I think this movie would of been better if the acting was more realistic.,1166659200,,268,4.173076923076923
8006324,3,B00014K5T6,"I am quite a fan of lovely Kumiko Takeda. I bought some of her movies without subtitles (I studied Japanese) in San Francisco's Japantown: ""Double Cast"", ""Gurenbana""(has two Kumikos, Akiyoshi and Takeda), ""Jingi 2"", Mangia Mai"", ""Zero Woman 3"" and of course ""Close Your Eyes And Hold Me"" which is my least favorite Kumiko movie...but nothing with her can be very bad to me. This is the only one that has her totally nude, rather than just topless. She is well-endowed for a Japanese girl with 34""/22.7""/32.4"" figure at 5'2"". I just received from Tokyo a DVD profile titled ""Diva, Kumiko Takeda in Los Angels"" (Angeles really). In ""Close Your Eyes..."", she is a man who dresses as a woman. I can hardly believe that the most beautiful living woman is a man. She wears a blonde wig and sings at a hermaphrodite nightclub. (She has success as model- actress-singer, so no one must sing for her.) She seduces both the hero and his fiancee. This film won some international awards, but I think Kumiko's other movies deserve that more. I do like to see Kumiko in anything, but I wouldn't own this movie if a lesser lady was the star.",1152489600,,1127,4.611940298507463
8006325,2,B00014K5T6,".......I felt kinda dirty or something after watching this.  I do give this film 2 stars simply for what could have been.  The plot was decent enough(see previous reviews) and the movie explored very basic human emotions and fears such as love, betrayal and lonliness.  Unfortunately, all this goes by the wayside in favor of lots of pretty explicit sex scenes....Amane and Hanabusa, Juri and Hanabusa, Juri and Amane, Hanabusa, Juri and friend, etc.  If you like lots of homosexual sex scenes then this is probably right up your.....alley.  Definitely not for the traditional minded.",1114905600,2,584,5.105263157894737
8006326,4,B00014K5T6,"This story is basically about Amane after having sexual relationship with Hanabusa(whom was hit by car which Amane drive on the highway) where he later lost interest of his girlfriend, Juri. She later find Hanabusa and was lured into having sexual relationship with her and later with Amane's friend either. I am not going to tell the full story as this made the movie less interesting to find out. There are a few sex scenes which includes woman to woman, woman having sex with man and two counts of sex between man and woman in this movie. Recommended purchase to those whom like this genre of movie....
*these erotic movies are usually done by hooker and pimps but they did a paste of these people with actress. This information is also for Singaporeans whom are deciding whether to embark on the buying and watching spree of these erotic movies.",1081123200,4,849,4.704697986577181
8006327,5,B00014K5T6,"A Tokyo executive named Amane has his ordered life turned upside
down when he accidentally hits a woman with his car.  She is a very exotic beauty, and in the process of accepting responsibility for his actions, promising to pay her hospital bills, and to do anything at all for her, she shocks him by asking him to run her over again.  She says, ""I wish you had finished me off.""
The mystery woman discharges herself after a day, and Amane follows her to what turns out to be a hermaphrodite bar, which means... He finds out ""her"" name is Hanabusa and discovers many things about ""her"".  Actually, many things about him, which is hard for me to use considering how lovely Hanabusa is.
Amane doesn't care--he loves Hanabusa, and breaks up with Juri, his long-time fiancee.  Demanding an answer, she confronts Hanabusa, only to spend the night with him.  Hanabusa may be a man but still has some emotional qualities of a woman.  ""Men are so arrogant.  They give you no alternative"" he tells Juri.
One concept explored here is the differences between men and women.  Hanabusa embodies both, having the breasts of a woman but the genitalia of a man, yet when the right button is pushed, she can feel either masculine or feminine.  ""Love changes its form with different partners"" he says.  Amane and Juri are bound by their own distinctive sexuality, but a disadvantage is that Hanabusa is caught in the middle.  He bitterly describes himself as a ""plaything god created out of a whim.""  Later, he revises that statement that ""we are all god's playthings.""
Loneliness is another.  The three principals are trying to fight that disease.  Juri herself turns frantic when she is dumped, as she has no-one else to turn to.  Amane tells Hanabusa he missed him.
Some great camera shots include a long shot of Amane running down an escalator, coming closer.  Then there's an extreme closeup of a stocking foot with high heel about to step onto the road.  It then cuts to an aerial shot of Amane's car, Hanabusa sprawled out in front of it.  However, the winner is that of Hanabusa, dressed in his long black coat, walking down the highway bridge in slow motion as the snow falls.  That shot alone embodies the loneliness embodied in this movie, and when I saw it in a preview, I knew I had to find out about this movie.
Another is the colour contrast.  There's the antiseptic cold white of the passionless corporate building where Amane and Juri work.  The bed scenes between Amane and Hanabusa are closeups on their skin, which is warmer and more full of life.
Both Kazuya Takahashi and Natsue Yoshimura (Amane and Juri, respectively) are passable.  However, Kumiko Takeda (Hanabusa) is by far the most interesting and appealing character here, and she single-handedly carries this unique erotic love story.  Definitely a different role from the title role in Zero Woman-Assassin Lovers.  Her voice ranges from low and silky to something more feminine.  She plays someone who is cut off from a normal existence and makes do with what she has.  She even sings one of the telling morals of this story, ""Ever so earnestly with a singular purpose, we go on with our lives.""  If I met a hermaphrodite as exotically beautiful as her, I wouldn't care--I'd marry her all the same.",1062115200,11,3262,4.717314487632509
