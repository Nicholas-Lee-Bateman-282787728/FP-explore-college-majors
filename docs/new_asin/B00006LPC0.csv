1786478,5,B00006LPC0,"With headliners Cher, Celine Dion, the Dixie Chicks, and Shakira, Divas Las Vegas 2002 rocks the MGM Grand.  Anastacia and Stevie Nicks came along as special guests.  With rocking ""Shook Me All Night Long"", world-wide hit ""Believe,"" fun-filled ""I'm Alive,"" and a must-have Elvis finale, this special is worth everyone's collection.  Even though Cyndi Lauper, Mary J. Blige, and Whitney Houston said no for the release, the rest of the Divas belt out to the point where you do care about the rest!  I recommend this for everyone.",1035590400,4,528,4.965909090909091
1786479,2,B00006LPC0,"Well I am very disappointed in this DVD/CD performance.  The wonderful duet between CHER and CYNDI LAUPER singing Turn Back Time was most unfortunately cut out.  Mistake number one.  Mary J. Blige was taken out of the entire dvd and cd.  I don;t know why.  Maybe she didn't want to be on it.  The duet with her and WHITNEY HOUSTON singing Rainy Dayz was also cut out.  BIG mistake number two.  The two other DIXIE CHICKS songs were taken out.  Bad move.  The duet between MARY J BLIGE and SHAKIRA was taken out.  They sang Love Is A Battlefield.  The DIXIE CHICKS, MARY J BLIGE, and STEVIE NICKS were even taken out of the finale.  That was the last straw.  I am very disappointed.  This is a good disc to see for Celine Dion performances.  You see two CHER performances.  I am happy they kept the Landslide duet between STEVIE NICKS and the DIXIE CHICKS.  That is the only saving grace because the finale was ruined.  Even the special feature of the backstage film monly has Celine Dion, Shakira, and Anastacia in it.  No CHER, she was the other headliner.  i think VH1 needs to start distributing the full show of the DIVAS performances form all the years.  They edit out every single one.  Most disappointing.",1035244800,118,1212,4.5092592592592595
1786490,3,B00006LPC0,"A great concept with great stars and a great band and great sets.....and a barely good result.

Typical hyperactive camera direction, terrible editing, and what appears to be either out-of-sync vocals *or* simply playback vocals. Hard to tell.

Viva Las Vegas - Divas las Vegas has to have an Elvis tribute and it's very well done: best performance by Shakira of under-discussed Elvis classic, ALWAYS ON MY MIND; funnest performance by Cher, doing HEARTBREAK HOTEL wearing a jetblack wig, more reminiscent of Bela Lagosi, and curlin' lip while swingin' hips. She's luvvin' it.

So far we got a very high * * * * . But Anastacia is an omnipresent drag, with her third rate Tina Turner imitation on everything she touches; plus, Stevie Nicks wondering where she is, while delivering an agreable LANDSLIDE with the Dixie Chicks. One more song by those
two and two *less* by A....and we are still in the * * * * range. But..no.

To wrap it up, if you love Cher (and want to see her do her thing on (THIS IS) A SONG FOR THE LONELY, in what appears to be a chastity belt over tight jeans - wow - buy/rent this, enjoy.",1342915200,,1111,4.512437810945274
1786491,5,B00006LPC0,"I loved this dvd, i never watched the whole show so someone that did prohbably would be disappointed beause i guess a lot of the show was cut from the dvd.. i don't know why, but still,i enjoyed it very much, i recomended if you are fan of Celine like me, or Cher, or even Anastacia, i'm not sure why she is on the cover as a guest, she is on the dvd more than the dixie chicks, so you would like it.
I definately recomend it, it's a fun show.",1258502400,,443,3.879120879120879

1786493,2,B00006LPC0,"I was lucky to watch the original broadcast on VH1. Then I waited a long time for the DVD release, I purchased it and was very disappointed of the editing. I would be very interested in purchasing this concert (I don't mind paying again for it) and other VH1 DIVAS concerts if they are released, at least, the way they were originally transmitted on TV.

1786494,5,B00006LPC0,"Even though I did not see the VH1 special in its entirety, I still cant even fathom any review from anybody that says anything but utter perfection. Flawless performances from the worlds best Diva's. i do enjoy and love the entertainers that were cut from the vidio. However, in my opinion, they didn't belong on stage with the worlds best. I still don't know how annastasia pulled it off, but she was given her finest gift and acheivement being on stage with the best. dixie chicks didn't belong there either but were included for some reason. Celine, owned the crowd, as she should have.",1168905600,,589,4.673076923076923
1786495,2,B00006LPC0,"I bought this because Cyndi Lauper was supposed to appear on this. I was very disappointed firstly because Cyndi was not on it and secondly it was a very short dvd for the money.

However a good dvd for fans of Celion Dion,Cher and Anastasia. Also Stevie Nicks performance was so short. Why cut out all the good stuff.

Next divas please do not cut any of Cyndi Lauper,s performance.",1162771200,,383,4.457142857142857

1786497,1,B00006LPC0,"When I watched this concert on television I thought that the highlight was when Cher and Cyndi Lauper duetted on ""If I Could Turn Back Time"". It was one of those magic moments but it has not been included on the DVD. Why???",1109721600,27,223,4.209302325581396

1786499,1,B00006LPC0,"When I saw this on VH1, I loved it. It had fun performances and was hosted by the always funny Ellen Degeneres. She was the host and opened the show with a warm-up with the dancers and a performance of Salt N' Peppa's Shoop, in the Britney Spears style with dancers and all. And then she went on with an even funnier monologue about how Cher flicked her off. How could you cut that??? It was hilarious. Even worse, they cut some performers altogether and some great songs as well. What were they thinking when they released this dvd? Why would any fan of the Divas Live series want this poor example of a commercially available dvd? I'll be looking for someone hawking an unedited bootleg and give them my money instead. Bad decision VH1!",1089158400,17,738,4.474074074074074
1786500,2,B00006LPC0,"Honestly, it would have been very good but they deleted performances by Cyndi Lauper, Mary J. Blidge, & Whitney Houston. All the while I thought Vh1 Motto is to save the music but are they eating up their words of wisdom because this is one way or the other misleading the public. If the record company has something to do with it then at least Vh1 top caliber executives must be consistent in fighting and saving the music. You have mislead us already from Divas live 1&2 by deleting a lot of the divas performances. A piece of advice ""Fight for what you believe and save the music"". Please don't get me wrong all the stars are great but this dvd deserves ""2 stars only"".",1082678400,6,672,4.384
1786501,1,B00006LPC0,"I thought this show was to SAVE THE MUSIC as was meant to be, but they forgot to SAVE SOME ARTISTS MUSIC by editing a little too much on this DVD, i feel ripp off. i saw the show on tv and couldn't wait to have the DVD to really enjoy a better quality of sound and picture, and here i was by the day it was released, just feeling angry after i played and watch the whole thing, wondering if my copy was defective,or probably i got a special rated version or who knows,  after doing some searching i realized that that the way it was, and i've been waiting to see if they might release a DIVAS LAS VEGAS 2002 ""PART II"" or director cut edition, or extended version...whatever put the songs and artists back to the show,like CYNDI LAUPER and CHER duet, but as today, my guess is they are no gonna do it.
 My advice: DON'T BUY IT, just wait to see it on VH1 and record it, so you will have the whole show.
Save the money and buy new CYNDI LAUPER standard's album ""AT LAST"" instead.",1072656000,12,977,4.083333333333333

1786503,1,B00006LPC0,"I expected more from this DVD. I watched Divas live! 2nd edition (the one with the red front), and this is really crap. Songs are great, okay, but it's extremly SHORT!! I bought this DVD on my trip to Argentina, hoping that when I came back to my home country I'll be excited to see it. I was wrong. 45 minutes for the price is just too unfair. Think twice if you want to buy this. I don't know why in the world they ever released it!
I have to confess, though, that I bought it only because of Celine Dion.",1066262400,8,507,4.02970297029703
1786504,2,B00006LPC0,"The production of the DVD is horrible.  Way too much was cut out.  Charge me a little more and give a nearly unedited show.  Would that really be so difficult?  Why cut out artists altogether???  Same thing happened to Stevie Nicks on another show.  Why were these two enigmatic performers edited out of shows?
Don't buy this version.  Write to the producing/distributing company and tell them to try again.",1065052800,5,407,4.811594202898551

1786506,2,B00006LPC0,"It's a pitty that a concet such as this one didn't have a good video and cd production. The singers were great (Celine Dion, Anastacia, Cher, Dixie Chicks and Shakira).
The first song it's the best one, the AC-DC cover ""You shook me all night long"" were you can see and hear two real divas (Celine and Anastacia). Cher also made a great work dressed as Elvis. In fact the live show was amazing but the edition on dvd and cd was terrible, the label left on a side several songs.
I hope that one day they release the complete version because this one is shameful.",1048982400,10,561,4.30188679245283
1786507,1,B00006LPC0,"I saw ""VH1 Divas Las Vegas"" when it first aired in May of 2002.  It was done fairly well considering the lineup was put together all wrong--Stevie Nicks and Cyndi Lauper should have been main performers, whilst Dixie Chicks and Shakira should have been the special guests. The performances were not earth shattering, but they were good nonetheless. Mary J. Blige poured her heart and soul into ""No More Drama.""  Diva-in-the-making Anastacia worked the stage like a seasoned pro.  Stevie Nicks was good but her voice sounded a little weak.  Celine was fantastic as usual--especially during her duet of ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" with Anastacia.  Cyndi Lauper's appearance left me wanting more.  I was unimpressed by the Dixie Chick's performance (Why couldn't they have performed ""I Can Love You Better""?) Shakira was good but her unusual wattle of a voice kepy making my skin crawl.  In short, I liked the concert enough to buy the DVD only to find that half the show has been omitted.  NOTE TO ALL MARY, WHITNEY AND CYNDI FANS:  Don't buy this DVD!  All of Mary's performances were cut (including her duet with Whitney).  Apparently Mary's record label would not allow her to be inlcluded.  Cyndi's performance was cut due to her on-going fued with Epic records.  VH1 needs to work out kinks such as these before they expect us to pay a sh--load of money for only HALF of what we expect to receive.",1047945600,16,1402,4.743801652892562
1786508,2,B00006LPC0,"I can't really understand how the producer could remove more of the half of this great concert. I saw it on TV and was my number on priority buy for a dvd, but I got really dissapointed as soon as I saw it on the shelfs.  There were many other singers that must have been on it, but not they just include less than 10 songs leaving out many other performances, like mary J with shakira, cher and cindy lauper etc... I wouldnt recommend to buy this dvd for this price, this is like a single dvd.",1043107200,4,494,4.092783505154639
1786517,5,B00006LPC0,"I really did not like this Divas Live because there were only two artists on it that I like and that's Celine Dion and Cher. I muted my TV when the rest of them came on. So it really doesn't bother me that they cut most all of the songs on this DVD. Just as long as Celine still gets to sing ""I'm Alive"" I'm happy.",1042848000,,314,3.772727272727273

'Divas Las Vegas' is another entry for the VH1 Save The Music Foundation. A big portion of this concert is left on 'the cutting room floor' for various reasons leaving us with a condensed concert that focuses on the highlights of the evening. The Divas this time around include Cher, Celine Dion, Shakira, Anastacia, Dixie Chicks & Stevie Nicks.

1786520,2,B00006LPC0,My opinion is that the whole show should have been in tact.  Some of us prefer one artist over the other.  I am disappointed to hear that the duet with Cher and Cyndi were left out.  Those 2 artist are a legend in their own time. Really bad mistake mad there......,1039392000,2,264,4.137254901960785
1786521,1,B00006LPC0,"I just saw the broadcast of this show over here in Singapore (like half a year later!) and I was pretty impressed and keen to get the DVD!
BUT when i found out from the tracklist that they took out the the duet between Cher and Cyndi, Whitney and Mary, and EVEN the shoten terrific Elvis medley to ONLY 4, I was TOTALLY [cheesed] and disappointed!!!
You dun expect me to get this! I would rather juz download the FULL, broadcasted show from somewhere in the net than to spend $$ on this!
What's wrong with these people who make the decisions!!! Not only its poor marketing, it certainly dun help to beat the piracy!!! Good luck!!!",1038614400,,630,4.3931623931623935
1786522,3,B00006LPC0,"I have to give this DVD three stars because Cher, Celine and Anastacia deliver great performances.  I'm actually glad they cut out Mary J Blige who I thought was a good singer but her performance at this show was pretty bad.  They should have cut Shakira out too.  She tried but she's so not at the level of the other performers.
AND MY NUMBER ONE PROBLEM IS CYNDI LAUPER'S DUET WITH CHER IS MISSING IN THIS DVD.  That was by far the biggest highlight of the Divas show.
What's ironic is that this DVD will come up if you search for Cyndi Lauper.
The Divas special is supposed to benefit the ""Save the Music"" foundation.  They certainly didn't save the best music from this show.",1037836800,12,679,4.4

En el audio 5.1(en believe) la voz original de CHER es remplazada y parece que no esta cantando en vivo pero esto no sucede con PCM y puedes disfrutar la voz en vivo de CHER, ambos audios son grandiosos al igual que la imagen(1.33:1).
