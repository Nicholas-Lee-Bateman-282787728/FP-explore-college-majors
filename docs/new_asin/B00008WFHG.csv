Makuta uleashes the Rahkshi to stop the toanuva from finding the 7th toa! While they don't know that Jaller is looking for it. I get the magazines and if they are the same as the movie this will be great! i also cant wait for the game and the next comic.",1060819200,,319,3.923076923076923

Jaller is chosen to find Takanuva. the Rahkshi are trying to find the Mask of Light. And well, you can figure it out from there. And, I also have good news, 2 more Bionicle movies are going to be released between now and 2005. So, This movie isn't the end. I also heard this movie is rated PG for violence and Scary images, So YAY, This isn't going to be a little kid movie. This movie mostly focuses more on the Matoran then Toa.

1864983,5,B00008WFHG,"From everything I've heard and seen about this movie. I think it's going to be worth the money, to say the least.
From what I've heard this movie is about the comming of the seventh toa, Taka(probably Nuva), the Toa of Light. There are six new enemies that Makuta has created, the Rashki. Since the the ToaNuva Defeated the BrorokKal, life on the island has been peaceful. Now these six new ""Anti-Toa"" are racing the ToaNuva to find the Mask of Light and prevent the Toa of Light from coming into existance. (Needless to say, they fail) Beyond that, I don't know what happens. But one thing that will make this movie worth is is that it's being done in photo reallistic Computer Animation.
All I've got to say is it better not be a ""LITTLE-kids"" Movie.
And Why the heck is it not being released in Theaters?",1057536000,,807,4.45945945945946

1864992,5,B00008WFHG,"As Bionicle's first ever movie, does Bionicle - Mask of Light live up to its full potential of entertainment?

I won't give any major spoilers, but I will say that there is a surprising twist at the end that you CANNOT miss.

The story starts when we're introduced to two matoran: Jaller and Takua. Things already seem to look intense when Takua discovers a great Kanohi mask after a sacred stone is burned in the volcanoes of Ta-Wahi. It is while playing a game of Kohlii (a sport in the Bionicle world that combines hockey and soccer together) when this mask shines its light on Jaller--and he is believed to be the herald for this mask: the mask of light. As a result, Jaller and Takua go on a quest to find the seventh toa--a toa of light.

When the main antagonist, Makuta, discovers this mask, he sends his sons, the Rahkshi, to look out for the mask and bring it to him. The Toa find out about this plan and desperately try to stop the Rahkshi from taking possession of the mask. It all leads up to a major twist near the climax.

All and all, Mask of Light is a fantastic movie. For a movie created eight years ago, its visuals were amazing; I'd be surprised if they weren't awarded for being the best visuals of 2003.

The characters' personalities are perfectly captured, as well. To add to this, many of these characters hold their own special accents and distinct attitudes.",1322092800,,1386,4.462450592885376

1864995,3,B00008WFHG,"This film, is definitely for Bionicle fans only, and I, being one enjoyed it.

If you are not a Bionicle fan, be warned, it will be nearly unwatchable, the scrpit was not all too great, the visuals were a bit choppy. The story of the film itself is decent, but it will not be understood if you are not a Bionicle fan.

Bionicle fans will be pleased, as long as they aren't expecting theatrical quality. The story keeps true to the storylines previous, and you may find it above expectation.

The only fantastic thing about this movie is the soundtrack, it literally compares to that of Star Wars, it's intense! It has a great main theme, along with awesome later tracks. They really should release a soundtrack.

1865000,3,B00008WFHG,"OK, Bionicle fans skip this review because I'm about to insult this movie--bigtime.

This movie makes ABSOLUTELY no sense.  Unless, of course, you have been a fan since you're two and have every bit of Bionicle paraphernalia in creation--comic books, T-shirts, posters, figures, movies, the whole nine yards. Even then, there are a couple of things...

For instance: where are the other Toa (Lewa, Kopaka, Onua) and Matoran at the Kohli game?  And, why WEREN'T they there in the first place?  What are totems?  Do you have to go over to read them, or are they a sign of danger that one sees from afar?  A lot of things are just NEVER explained in the whole thing! The mask powers and weapons just get more and more random throughout the film, not to mention the powers of the Rahkshi (sorry for misspellings).

And, why a character who would jump across lava JUST to look at a stupid totem that he can see from meters away WOULDN'T agree to carry a mask is beyond me.  If he thought he could just stay back and record life from the sidelines, then they should have (gasp!) EXPLAINED IT--something that seems to be beyond the filmmakers.  If they'd wanted THAT effect, h shouldn't have been going across the lava at all.  Just because they needed the plot to move forward DOESN'T mean they should have discarded the minute traces of personality they actually HAD placed in the characters.

The music was OK, but it sounded very Lord-of-the-Rings-esque .

The animation? The horror... The sheer horror of it all... JUST because a movie is in three dimensions does NOT mean that you don't have to do what other movies have to do--tell a story, show personalities, and above all----MAKE IT BELEIVABLE!!!!  The characters in this just don't work.  The random, unnecessary gestures they add to make the characters more interesting are the marks of truly horrid actors.

In short------
If you want a good movie, go somewhere else.
If you're a Bionicle fan, enjoy.

1865001,3,B00008WFHG,"I didn't notice it at first, what with running back and forth to the kitchen filling everyone's requests, until my husband pointed out that this is a (VERY) cheap animated knock-off of Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings'. Now that I think about it, it is more like half LOTR and half Star Wars. It starts out with a young robot jumping from rock to rock across a river of lava in order to see what a 'totem' (rock) on the other side says. When he reaches it, he accidentally drops it in the lava, only to have the rock coating burn off to reveal The Mask of Light.... After doing a kitchen run, I get back to see the same robot in some sort of contest against other robots (= pod racing). Next kitchen run, he and another young robot/droid were riding on the back of a crab shaped robot that is supposed to be equal to a human's dog through a lush forest, in an attempt to get the Mask of Light out of their city, and run into a 'superior' robot resembling either Aragorn or Legolas and is the ruler of air..... While they are away, three robots from another race smash a hole in the ground and are racing towards the city on what could be Darth Mauls' Sith speeder, and engage in combat with the ruler of fire using two knives that shoot light out of them resembling lightsabres. Need I say more?
I didn't particularly like this movie, but what the heck; both my kids (soon to be 3 and 5 this coming June) seem to enjoy it a lot. At least it is pretty non-violent considering no one on either side gets hurt, and there isn't any gore whatsoever. So it can't be that bad.",1082160000,5,1571,4.2052980132450335
1865002,4,B00008WFHG,"This movie is cool! The only drawback i sthe animation. Tahu, Gali, Lewa, and Onua don't look like they do on those toy commercials. About the only two Toa Nuva that look okay are Pohatu and Kopaka. But still, another animation drawback is the Rahkshi. What's up with those messed up heads when the kraata comes right through it? That was disgusting! Anyway, Takanuva's creation doesn't follow the comics, and his voice sounds like a girl's. He also looks like Onua with gold and white armor, but the mask is like exactly the same!
Overall, this movie is good. It may be scary for little kids, but it's pretty cool for older ones. Anyway, I'm sure
Bionicle 2: Legends of Metru Nui is going to be much, much better. The Toa Metru are better, anyway.

1865003,3,B00008WFHG,"I am a Lego fan, even in my late 20`s.  So I was excited when I heard about this movie.
Now that I got it, here is my 2-cent-worth review.
It is an entertaining little romp in the world of the Bionicle.  Some kids were amazed to see their favourite toys brought to life onscreen.  The animators manage to take some liberties in adding some features to the characters for obvious reasons (i.e. adding fingers to the hands, slight mask modifications to allow mouth movement...) while maintaining the spirit of the Bionicle.  And the story is good for a kid-oriented movie.  Adults would be able to watch it with their children without feeling bored.
As pleasant this movie has been, there are a few issues that brought the score down.  First is the art and animation.  As great as it may be, I have found some of the design and scenarios to be uneven.  An example would be a scene where a character pokes her head out of the water near the top of a waterfall.  As the raging water comes rushing, the head does not seem to be affected by the flow of water.  There is no water turbulence, splash or drag animated around the head.  There is barely a ripple.  After seeing the movie, I do not understand why more details where added, since the rest of the movie was of an above average quality.
Also, the story seems to have some holes that do not explain certain plot details.  Sometimes a character would just suddenly KNOW something out of the blue, without any explanation on how he/she got to that conclusion.  At other times, heroes would conveniently appear during critical situations without explaining why and how.  Things like this makes you scratch your head and wonder if you have missed something.  After seeing the movies four times, I still do not have all my questions answered.
But despite all this, the movie entertains us.  The characters are more than cardboard, bland figures based on toys.  They have emotions, personalities and behaviours that make you forget that this movie is based on a Lego product.  The music is also well delivered, with a good quality orchestra.  Although not memorable, the main theme may echo in your head for a while.
In my book, for a first movie from Lego and Miramax, the producers did a good job.  Here`s hoping that there will be more.",1077321600,10,2284,4.5763546798029555
1865004,2,B00008WFHG,"I'm at a loss to explain the 5 star ratings this film got.  It literally has no plot. Tons and tons of expository dialogue to explain the ""mythology"" (so that your 5 year old feels justified in demanding that you buy all the ""characters"") and ""glory shots"" of things getting blown up and characters running and screaming. But it has so much jargon that if you're not already familiar with the characters, the plot will make no sense.  My son's Dad and I have watched it with my 6yo son (who admittedly loves it even though he can't explain what it's about either) and we still can't discern an actual plot.

1865010,3,B00008WFHG,"Let's face it, this is a product tie-in movie.  In addition, it is a straight-to-video movie, so let's just say my expectations were looooow.  Pokemon Low.  I expected ""My Little Pony meets Lion King 2""-level quality.
But the movie is actually coherent, thoughtful, moral, quasi-religious, and suspenseful.  Maybe my low expectations had me disarmed, but it was genuinely not torturous to watch.  The two children I watched it with, 6 and 8 years old (and both girls!), were mesmerized by it, and had to watch it again immediately.  About 2/3 of the way through the first viewing, I thought, wow, this is actually pretty good.  Then one of the girls exclaimed, ""This is REALLY GOOD!""  For this type of movie, what more can one hope for?
I give it 3 stars because, I mean, it ain't exactly Kurosawa or Hawks or anything.  This is hardly One For The Ages.  But for an entertaining evening with children and adults both watching the same thing, enjoying it, and discussing it afterward, this movie is exactly what you want.",1065484800,9,1020,4.744318181818182

I have to agree with the other reviewers though that the voice given to Lewa was all wrong.

The story fits well into the Bionicle world without being impossible to understood by non-fans and the visuals are simply stunning.  The soundrack is appropriate and well composed.  The voices, however, leave something to be desired.  Especially Lewa who, instead of being his fun-loving wise-cracking self, is some sort of derranged hippy, speaking almost completely in mutilated Le-Koronan slang.  For instance his line, ""There'll be no landwalking today, just airflyin'!""  may seem funny at first, but seems to become truly disturbing later veiwings.",1064188800,3,670,5.333333333333333

The only ones that reallty fit the character they played were Kopaka, Thau, Vakama, and Hahli.

It's rated PG for a reason...there ARE some darker images...a character who sacrifices himself and the whole good vs evil concept is shown in truly dark graphic ways. But if your child is old enough to play with the small sized lego's then they shouldn't have a problem with watching the dvd. There are a lot of extra's...an entire map of the ""bionicle world"", descriptions of all the baddies and what horrible things they can do to you, the making of featurette and some information on the next installment.

This morning my son wakes up, and is so excited that the movie was going to be released for sale today.  I reluctantly bought him a copy.
We sat down and popped the DVD in, and my first impression was ""Hey this is kinda cool"".  Its got really neat interactive features ( I won't go into great detail, as I wouldnt want to ruin it for you, and I would list them but you can see them in the product details).
After playing with the bonus features, we started the movie.  The graphics and sound are AWSOME!!  There is a feature that you can toggle on an off that allows additional information to be viewed during the movie (like the pop up bubbles).
Its a tad slow during one part (but me not knowing really what was going on..well that could be because of my lack of Bioncile knowledge).  I actually enjoyed the movie.  There were three adults and one child, and everyone was GLUED to the set.  No one moved or made a sound during the entire film.
Its got a good story line.

This movie had characters that were unique and individual, a good plot, and even showed me what the island of Mata Nui looked like. It was fun and action filled, and had good dialogue. Heck, we even got see what sport is played on the island! The story gives us a sense of culture, character, and even geography. All in all, a good setting.

I loved the voices the characters were given, and I think the voice actors did a great job expressing emotion in a group of beings who were both flesh and robotic. The animation was also incredibly good. It allowed you to see the detail of each limb, and you realized that they are still made of separate pieces all put together, just like the toys.

If you're a really big fan of BIONICLE, like me, there are a bunch of easter eggs you might pick up on, like the fact that there are different words written in their language. Whenever it's necessary, the characters will read it for you, but it's fun to be able to read the small bits of information hidden around the island.

All of my sisters and my brothers enjoy this movie, and we will constantly quote this movie, seeing as we've been watching it for at 9 years now.

All in all, I love this movie, and I'll probably buy it to add to my movie collection for college.",1405296000,,1484,4.304659498207886
