to the original John Fogerty.  Elliot Easton is a rock guitar player Virtuoso who has played with other major groups.  Take
note of this guy's skill, as his creativity gets better as the performance progresses.  Elliot Easton is the left handed guitarist
who takes the performance to the level of Fogerty's group.  Vocalist is also strong,  along with Easton, makes this as good
as Fogerty's group.  No disrespect for Fogerty who set the high bar, but these guys keep the dream alive and kickin'.",1445126400,,615,4.79047619047619

The music is pure CCR and up to the quality of the live shows I have seen.",1439251200,,251,3.7547169811320753

8541442,4,B009H3LNRK,"There is good and bad here.  This is a step above a bootleg film.  It seems to have been recorded on multiple VHS video cameras and a separate stereo sound system and mixed together later to make the DVD.  You hardly hear the huge and rather close, audience.  The video and sound are mostly not in sync and are up to 1/2 sec apart.  Some places, near the end, they are in sync.  There are several places where the video is spliced in with no sound. The volume jumps up and down in places.  The tone changes once and a while.  There is a list of songs on the package but no further info, including nothing about the band or concert.  The disk and case are professionally made.  The video just stops.  There are no credits at the end.  There are no extras on the video to select.  The tribute band is a good band and plays the songs well and sounds like CCR but is just enough different that you know you are listening to a tribute band.  Two members are CCR's bass player and drummer which helps the sound.  It's filmed in South America.  The video plays fine in North America.  It is a great video for CCR collectors or even for someone new to CCR as long as you understand that this is a tribute band.  Many top songs are played and the video is about an hour and a half long.  There are 23 songs and some showmanship. I'd buy it again and recommend it to any CCR fan.  I would see this band live, especially since seeing CCR is not possible.",1394755200,,1443,4.159420289855072
8541443,2,B009H3LNRK,"When I received the item I was pretty disappointed, as it is a tribute band and not CCR playing...my fault, I did not look at it close enough. I actually saw this band in Atlanta and they are good. However, then I go and  play the DVD and the sound does not match the video. Oh well, the risk of purchasing stuff on line.",1371513600,,321,4.015625
