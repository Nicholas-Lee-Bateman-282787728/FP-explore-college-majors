8564170,4,B00B8O4V84,I really like the DVD set. There are some good workout on it and you do only the ones you choose to do. I have a lot of Baron Baptiste dvds and I like the hip opener one on this DVD it is a good buy.,1422576000,,199,3.347826086956522
8564171,1,B00B8O4V84,"The level of Yoga required for this workout was not indicated. It's way to fast paced for a beginner to attempt to learn to follow it. The set was new as indicated, no condition issues.",1416009600,,185,4.314285714285714
8564172,5,B00B8O4V84,this is perfect for after running or any type of cardio.  It's great to have short programs that work the whole body,1411862400,,116,4.2727272727272725
8564173,5,B00B8O4V84,"This is a gem. Short work outs that are geared to the more experienced yogi.  I am still getting to all of the work outs,but they are fun, different and challenging. Well worth the money. Here's the breakdown:

8564174,2,B00B8O4V84,"I suppose there is nothing wrong with this two disc set from a technical standpoint. It just doesn't work for me. It mixes easy, beginner level yoga with advanced form all in the same session. I couldn't follow them very well.  I like Rodney Yee, Sarah Ivanhoe, Barbara Benagh, and Rainbaeu Mars, but I  sometimes look for something new. This was new, but not what I wanted.  It's too hard. I can't use it.
BTW The girl on the cover is not in the video. Why do they do that?",1371081600,,474,4.2444444444444445
8564175,3,B00B8O4V84,"This is a two disc set from Yoga Journal that indicates there are 3 workouts on each disc.  Disc 1 claims to have as the 3rd title, Standing Hip Openers.  Disc 2 claims to have as the 3rd title, Meditation Preparation.  Well guess what?  Both items are the Meditation Preparation.  So instead of 6 workouts, I got 5 (well who knows?  maybe fewer since there are still 3 workouts I haven't tried).  I was really looking forward to the standing hip openers.  This is the second YJ video I've had problems with, and I'm not likely to buy another product from them.",1370822400,2,561,4.431372549019608
8564176,3,B00B8O4V84,"I can only review practice 3 on disc one. I have watched the others but not performed them. First, the practice is incorrectly called standing hip openers; it is not that; it is  a 25 minute practice is aimed at getting you ready for meditation and if you go to the yoga journal web site it is described correctly. Secondly, Baron Batiste, who leads the practice, does pigeon on the right side and not on the left side; an un-balanced practice.
Clearly this DVD set was thrown together with little attention to detail. As I do more of the practices on this DVD I'll be able to say more. It's too bad, because the Batiste practice is not bad, except for the omission of pigeon on the left side. It is very hard to find good yoga DVD's.",1369612800,9,734,4.318840579710145
8564177,5,B00B8O4V84,Liked this DVD.  So many focus on just specific weight loss or body parts and poses.  This is well-rounded and a 2 disc set so fairly complete.  I find myself using this more and more and my others less and less.  I am enjoying it very much thanks.,1366243200,,248,4.104166666666667
