8244824,4,B00128X6PK,"In the annals of jazz history, ESP Records has a prominent niche, admittedly (and proudly) well outside the mainstream.  This documentary brings to life figures from the label's 60's roster such as Alan Silva, Marion Brown, John Tchicai and Burton Greene, all of whom have legendary status for free jazz fanatics like myself.  Quite a few ""I wonder what happened to..."" questions are answered by this film.  Important non-ESP figures prominently featured in the doc include Joseph Jarman of the Art Ensemble of Chicago, as well as the indefatigable and highly articulate William Parker, who is one the central figures in free jazz's persistence and in its somewhat higher profile over the past few years.  I wish Milford Graves could have been included.  Hovering over it all is the holiest of ghosts, Albert Ayler.  Is there any video footage of Ayler in performance to be seen anywhere?

Roth's documentary is lovingly and thoughtfully made.  While it is neither exhaustive nor definitive, it is a must-see for fans of free jazz, particularly for those who still feel the magic and mystery of those crazy-beautiful LPs that ESP put out in the mid-sixties.",1270425600,13,1157,5.020942408376963
