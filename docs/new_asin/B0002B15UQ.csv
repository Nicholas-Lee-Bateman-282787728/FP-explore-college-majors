2073688,5,B0002B15UQ,"The quality of these movies varies from average (Thirdspace) to excellent (In The Beginning). But that is not why I am giving this collection 5 stars.
Babylon 5 is a story told over five seasons. In this story we grow close to characters who grow and change like real people. The Londo and G'kar in season five is to see characters with strengths and weaknesses shaped by extraordinary circumstance.
These movies give us an added treat. JMS has given us the opportunity to step out of the regular schedule and learn in more detail about some of the back story we can only infer from the series. The Babylon 5 universe is of enough depth that I wish we could have had even more of these special movies.
As a bonus, we get commentaries by JMS. While it is always interesting to learn what he had in mind, Babylon 5 speaks eloquently even without commentary.",1090281600,13,855,4.52258064516129
2073689,4,B0002B15UQ,"Number one is ""A Call to Arms"" - Other than the ""The Gathering"" and ""In The Beginning"", which have already been released, this is by far the best of the remaining movies.
Number two is the inclusion of commentaries.  JMS's commentaries are some of best, so even if you had the first movie disk, this collection has something to offer.
I, for one, am glad that ""The Legend of the Rangers"" is nowhere near this collection.  Makes it easier to pretend that atrocity never existed.",1089763200,5,477,4.6
2073690,5,B0002B15UQ,"I first bought the double sided disc of The Gathering and In The Beginning right here at Amazon.  I then bought Season 1 New elsewhere, 2 and 3 from a used/new store in my neighborhood (well 3 from their sister store near Baltimore), and 4 and 5 from reliable Amazon Marketplace clients.  It stands to reason, that I should get this final box set (well maybe next to last if Crusade comes out soon) directly from Amazon especially at the preorder price showing as I write this.  It completes the cycle of what is probably the best scifi series of the 90s, and shows not everything is in Gene Roddenberry's universe (although I do like Trek and other stuff of his).  Joe Michael's universe is just as wonderful, and these 5 films help explain it as well as (if not better) than the series.  However, the other reviewers are right, if you haven't seen the hour long episodes, get them first before you buy this set, or buy (or maybe borrow) a copy of the fore mentioned double sided disc (I'm giving mine away as soon as this set hits my mailbox).  Once you have all 6 sets, sit back and enjoy a gourmet selection of Babylon 5.  You'll be glad you did.:-)",1089504000,5,1153,4.384976525821596
2073691,5,B0002B15UQ,"J. Michael Straczynski (jms) created the space station Babylon 5 and spent years getting it produced and on the air.  It premiered about the same time ST: Deep Space Nine did, and for a while, fans compared the two.  It was almost ""apples & oranges"" time, but it was tried.
As a long-time Trek fan, I was surprised when I first saw the pilot (""The Gathering"") in 1993.  I was absolutely stunned.  It was marvelous - a space station as a port of call and hope for interstellar peace with resident alien ambassadors who really looked ALIEN not just odd noses and hair.  I had to recognize the wonderful character actor, Andreas Katsulas, BY VOICE!  And why Babylon 5, not just Babylon Station?  Well, #s 1 - 4 were sabotaged & destroyed; # 4 disappeared after going on-line.  (Disappeared?  It's 5 MILES LONG, for crying out loud!)  Word was that this would be an on-going, progressive five year story arc, the likes of which hadn't been done before on US television.  Risky.  Okay, jms had my attention.  When the series finally made it to the air, I (being cynical of tv production in general) figured it wasn't going to stay as good.  It didn't.  It steadily got better.
I repeat, I speak as a long time Trek fan (beginning with the original series - skip Voyager, I did).  B5 is one of the best televison series ever produced.  Note I did not say ""science fiction series.""  (It is THE best s/f series ever put up to the audience.) I introduced several non s/f fans to the series, as a dramatic series and they all loved it. (So much for ""only for space opera hounds."")
Crowd scenes were, well, crowded, with humans of all types and aliens as extras wandering through scenes. (The aliens, by the way, are much more than odd skin colours, strange noses and ""hair."")  The station wasn't pristeen, the population wasn't always picture perfect.  We have shysters, homeless, personal problems, espionage, humour, betrayal, relationships, and deaths (being in the opening credits did not guarantee survival, and it didn't always happen at the end of a season).  The plotlines are tight, and the threads are woven into five years of shows.  The special effects are believable. (Yes, you could ""hear"" space battles, but hey, cut them some slack - NASA asked for plans of the Starfuries for reference for future space station repair vehicles.)  B5 was the first show to rely on CGI effects, born out of budget necessity.  More than once, watching the show, I found myself pounding the furniture with excitement - and we won't go into (here) what I did during series finale ""Sleeping in Light.""
Sinclair, Sheridan, Ivanova, Garibaldi, G'Kar, Londo, Lennier, Vir, Na'Toth, Talia, and Lyta came into our home as people with problems.  The characters grew and changed and made choices and dealt with the consequences of those choices for good or bad.  G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) put it best: no one on Babylon 5 is exactly what they appear.  There is no clear deliniation of good guys and bad guys - mostly it's all shades of grey.  Acting (with the exception of one season five regular) is superb.  What more could you ask!  For the first four years, the hardest part of being a B5 fan was FINDING it.  (Our local station played ping-pong with its time slot.) To own uncut, widescreen versions on DVD of the whole story arc was a dream we had.
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS SERIES NEEDS TO BE SEEN IN ORDER, STARTING WITH ""THE GATHERING"" AND MOVING FORWARD THROUGH THE SEASONS. (Don't worry about where the movies fall in the arc just yet, and STAY AWAY from ""In the Beginning,"" ""River of Souls,"" and ""A Call to Arms"" until you have viewed the series through ""Objects at Rest."")  It IS a total story.  Now the episodes and movies (all but the series ""B5: Crusade"" and ""Legend of the Rangers,"" which are not integral to the main storylines) are available.  This movie set is a ""must-have"" for any B5 fan.",1088812800,28,3889,4.637426900584796
2073692,4,B0002B15UQ,"The story behind these movies makes each of them worth having and seeing, if you have seen the rest of the series.  If you haven't, your money is better spent on one of the season sets.
I think the pilot is best viewed after seeing the rest of the series, because it sets up nothing that isn't included somewhere in the main series, and frankly is missing the pacing, dialogue, and polish of the first season.  I regard it as an interesting curiousity, not an essential part of the story.  2/5
""In the Beginning"" is fascinating because of the excellent presentation of the various stories you have heard before, now in full detail and color.  However, it is more a series of linked short stories than a single cohesive story, and those unfamiliar with the charactors will find it disjointed and confusing. 4/5
""A Call to Arms"" is probably the best and most complete of the lot - it lacks the pathos and heroism that make ItB so memorable, but it is a single story that anyone can enjoy even without any previous B5 experience.  However, it is a lead-in to another show and not part of the B5 arc at all. 5/5
The two stand-alones, ""River of Souls"" and ""Thirdspace""  are almost writing experiments for JMS - a way to write about something that doesn't have to fit into any story arc.  Each has its strengths and weaknesses.  The best element of each is how relatively minor charactors in the main series get a lot more screen time in them.  The worst elements are the often cheesy dialogue and weak, IMO, direction.  3/5
However, while the average would be only a bit above 3/5, I think this series will deserve an extra star for the commentaries.  I have these movies on tape but will get them for the new insights you always get from The Great Maker discussing his craft and creation.",1088208000,7,1784,4.492260061919505
2073693,4,B0002B15UQ,"I'm giving it a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 because it appears that this set does not contain the ""Legend of the Rangers"" movie.  Not that I especially liked that movie, but in the interest of completeness it really should be there.  I mean, they're re-including ""The Gathering"" and ""In the Beginning"" though those had already been released... why not get it right and make it complete?
As for the movies... ""The Gathering"", ""In the Beginning"", and ""A Call to Arms"" are the ones to pay attention to as they are part of the canon and overall arcs.  ""In the Beginning"" is especially stellar, having an epic quality in and of itself.  Of course to any newcomer, it is a severe (and I DO mean SEVERE) mistake to watch it before watching season 3 at least.  The fact that the remaining movies had little to do with the seasonal arcs and themes, something with which Strakzynsky had addicted me, is what made me like them less.",1087257600,10,914,4.481927710843373
2073694,5,B0002B15UQ,"""In the Beginning"" is probably the best of the B5 movies, and it adds quite a bit for the seasoned viewer because it tells us all of what happened in the Earth Mimbari War, only small bits of which were discussed in the main series.  And given that the story is being told by Londo it's all the better for having so much of the series best character (tied with Garibaldi of course).  Having a comentary track for that is a good reason to get the box set, everything else is gravy.",1086912000,8,480,4.206521739130435

2073725,5,B0002B15UQ,"If you have not watched the series do it first. Well, the first movie ""The Gathering"" is also the piliot for the series, so that's OK to see first... If not you'll see lots of series spoilers in these made-for-TV movies and a lot will be out of context without watching the series first. Just plain better to see these after (except the first).

Here are the movies:

1  ""The Gathering""
This is also the pilot for the series and the first episode on the
2  ""In the Beginning""
This is a prequel set 10 years before and covering the Earth-Mimbari war often spoken about in the first and second seasons.
3  ""Thirdspace""
This is the B5 foray into multi-dimensional space and fighting foes from another dimension
4  ""River of Souls""
This is a return of the Soul Hunters from one episode in the series
5  ""A Call to Arms""
This is the setup to the post B5 series Crusade and sets up the premise for that short lived series.

While the movies (except the first which is part of the series) are not so integrated I think they add to the experience for a B5 fan like me. I enjoyed these enough that I'm giving them 5 stars.

But wait - there is also a DVD of Babylon 5 the lost takes that was released after this in 2007. While a long time after the end of the series they tie up some loose ends and I think are worth a watch. Kind of a late present to B5 fans.",1508025600,8,1351,4.145593869731801

The Gathering and In the Beginning were both good and A Call to Arms wasn't very well done (it seemed rushed and fell prey to the ""Whoever the current bad guys are, they are as bad as the Incredibly Powerful Bad Guys we defeated last time!"" problem) but it had the spirit and energy of the series and lots of fun fight scenes. River of Souls and thirdspace were just trite and pretty awful watching. They seemed better at the time as they added to the lore and universe of Babylon 5, but years later....that's about all they offer, and it's not nearly enough.",1505865600,,724,4.37037037037037
2073737,1,B0002B15UQ,"I purchased the complete set years ago and all of the discs worked fine.  However, after about 1-1/2 years I tried watching the set again and two of the discs no longer worked (one would skip and freeze and the other would not play at all).  I tried playing the discs in 3 different DVD & Blu-ray players and in 2 computer DVD drives with the same results.  After about another year, I again tried to watch the set and discovered that more discs would not play.  Now, I have at least 9 discs that will not play (I stopped trying to watch after season 3).  There are no scratches or other visible defects...they simply will no longer play.  Also, a couple of the packages are falling apart in spite of my very careful and gentle handling.

That being said, now, with wiser eyes, I keep in mind that the special effect in the 90s just were not up to today's standards and TV shows often don't have the budgets that movies have.

Too many people I know said the show was good.  So, I finally watched it - all of it.  The technical aspects of the production/delivery are adequate and, I forgave the costumer, more or less).  And I am actually fond of all the characters.

The  story line is great.  An example of what a good writer can do, if the network execs don't meddle too much.  The sequel series only made it one season - I never understood what network execs can't be happy with a good show that is popular, but not wildly popular.",1476921600,4,939,4.32

One caveat: I would give this four and a half stars if that was available for the simple reason that this product is pictured where you think you are getting each season as a boxed set. (I'm speaking of the high quality boxes - actual boxes, that many DVD sets come in). Instead, each season actually comes in a plastic casing.

While that is not all bad, they don't stand up as well for display, and are in fact cheaper than the actual box sets many DVD series are sold in (this one included). So the ad is a bit misleading.

I will not spoil anything here, but the movies are a great addition to the series itself, and I consider B5 to be the best Sci-Fi series of all time, with Farscape a close second.  B5 has the depth, story line, acting, writing, and screen play that places it in the same category as any of the Star Trek variations and pushes the envelope more than Star Trek ever did.  What I mean by pushing the envelope is this is not a ""softball"" Sci-Fi opera; you will find some serious critical thinking going on in your head about today's foibles and issues and no rock is left unturned by JMS (the series creator/writer).  Although set in space with lots of aliens in the future, B5 is about the human condition.",1464998400,,738,4.364963503649635

2073938,5,B0002B15UQ,"I first encountered Babylon 5 (B5) when it was in its second season on TV. I enjoyed it immensely & when my local library got the DVDs for the whole series some years later, I went on a B5 marathon watching mission. I've seen all of these before & wanted to see them again at a somewhat more leisurely pace. Thus, my library, which has only one copy & will loan a ""season"" set of DVDs for one week at a time before charging a $1.00/day late fee wasn't going to work out! So, I bit the bullet and purchased this set. It plays great!

One other thing is that the show's ""high-tech"" stuff is a bit dated (CRTs instead of flat screen displays & etc.). The CGI is quite good for its time, but gets a bit old as stuff is repeated. (Then again, so is some of the Star Trek stuff. ... Look at the first BORG encounter on ST-TNG. The BORG are using 5-1/4"" floppy drives set in the wall next to their hibernation bays. I'm sure that they were cheap & the set builders have them just as fillers, but there they are! Then again, the original TERMINATOR is running on 6502 Assembly Code & may just be Apple II Compatible.) So, watching the show & checking for some of the (old-new) hi-tech stuff is always fun. //Also, look for the Lincoln 1 cent piece. It'll show up as a prop!//

Note: There are some other B5 episodes on one more DVD & a follow-on series that I was not interested in purchasing (or watching).",1424304000,4,1399,4.197026022304833

When Delenn orders a genocidal attack on Earth, the pain she feels is more poignant when you realize actor Mira Furlan is a refugee from the Bosnian conflict. Some of the scenes must have been very hard for her to do. I'm a typical guy in that I enjoy seeing beautiful women. The story opens with a closeup of Jasmine Baytock as a Centauri nanny in the emperor's palace, soon followed by large-eyed Claudia Christian. Just about my favorite character is G'kar, the placid and deeply philosophical ambassador of the Narn. Andreas Katsulas is very good in his acting, despite the heavy makeup.

2073947,5,B0002B15UQ,"I'll be reviewing both the series as a whole and the packaging, separately.

PACKAGING: The series was originally released in cardboard booklets with super-glued plastic DVD holders. My dad owns this set, and it's really quite terrible.

The series was later released in large DVD cases about half as wide, but the brittle plastic doesn't hold up. Out of all 6 boxes, all that I received were broken internally, and only one was useable. Luckily, I store my DVDs in carrier cases and use the cases as decorations, and none had any external damage.

So it's up to you, whether you want the big carboard set that falls apart or the plastic set that falls apart, but I believe unless otherwise stated, you'll be getting the newer all-plastic cases.

The cover art is wonderful, as you can see. The only thing that bothers me is that some characters are featured on the covers more prominently than others. For example, Londo is on nearly every single one, yet Garibaldi and Ivanova each appear once. Another disappointing thing is that this set doesn't include The Lost Tales, Legend of the Rangers, or Crusade, but oh well.

REVIEW OF THE SERIES:

Though I was born halfway through this show's original run, thanks to my dad purchasing it on VHS and making me watch it growing up, it's somewhere in my top three favorite shows. If you're reading this, you're probably familiar with it. If not, well...

The story is great. There are minor details, lines in season one that have repercussions all the way until season four. The special effects are terrible nowadays, and you can easily tell what was shot on film and what was shot digitally, especially in earlier seasons, so when you see the screen get slightly pixelated, you know someone's gonna pull out a laser gun or use space magic or something. I imagine this wasn't too apparent on TVs of the time, but if watching this on an HDTV, it's painfully obvious. The CGI gets significantly better over time, though, as does the film quality. And the story.

Side note: Some say the series is a ripoff of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, but though DS9 was released a few months prior, Babylon 5 started production first. But, there are plenty of die-hard Star Trek fans that love Babylon 5 as well. The two series are not at all in competition, especially now, 20-some years later.

The following is a spoiler-free review of each season and movie, in chronological order.

In the Beginning: Prequel movie, which starts near the end of the series, and may spoil a few minor things, but figuring out how those things come to be may be fun. Best viewed either at the beginning of the series, or after Season Four.

The Gathering: Pilot movie. A rather bad reflection of the series. Characters are undeveloped and aliens' makeup (Such as main characters Londo, G'Kar, and Delenn) looks both cheesy and completely different from how they look in the rest of the series. A murder mystery, packed with sci-fi action and politics.

Season One: Almost unanimously considered the worst season, the dialogue is cheesy, as is the makeup, and characters disappear at the end of the season. The main purpose of Season One was to introduce the titular space station's mission, with various political and religious issues among different alien races. (One episode features a boy dying of a condition a simple surgery can fix, though surgery of any kind is against his parents' religion.) Though each episode is independent, some hints are sprinkled in there of the coming seasons.

Season Two: The next two and a half seasons blur together, but this season features a new captain, John Sheridan, a hero from a past war with one of the alien races. This causes some tension, but these issues are irrelevant in the coming danger everyone senses.

Season Three: The series really picks up steam in the third season, with an all-out war between nearly every alien race in the galaxy, even the nearly-omnipotent Vorlons and Shadows. In the process, the Earth and Centauri governments are infested with corruption. subtle dialogue hints from Season One start coming into play. Two old characters return, and another falls.

Season Four: Originally, this season was supposed to be two, but the series' contract expired and the two seasons had to be condensed into one (And it was later renewed for a fifth season, which didn't work out too well. More on that later.) The Shadow War seemingly ends halfway through, but the threat remains. Major characters are put in serious jeaopardy on several occasions. Between the two major story arcs is a movie, Thirdspace. More on that later. After this, the cast takes the fight to Earth to rid its government of corruption. The last episode features a look at the consequences of the series up to a million years later. I recommend watching this episode just before the Season 5 finale.

Thirdspace: Inspired by the works of HP Lovecraft, this movie puts a horror twist on Babylon 5. A lot of major characters are not featured, but aren't necessarily needed. Not one of the series' high-points in my opinion, but worth watching, regardless.

Season 5: The plans for the series' fifth season were, as previously mentioned, condensed to fit into Season 4, so this season seems a bit superfluous. Though it doesn't live up to seasons 3 and 4, it's definitely worth watching, even without a few fan-favorite characters. STOP and do NOT watch the last episode of this season. You have a bit to go yet.

The River of Souls: This movie features a race from Season One coming back to haunt Babylon 5, figuratively and literally.

NOT INCLUDED: Legend of the Rangers: To Live and Die in Starlight: Failed pilot episode to a spinoff series. Poorly received, but worth watching.

A Call to Arms: Pilot episode to spinoff series Crusade, featuring a new cast trying to find a solution to a major problem left behind by the Shadows, threatening everyone on Earth and potentially the rest of the galaxy.

NOT INCLUDED: Crusade: This series, as mentioned, follows A Call to Arms. Definitely worth buying, though the episode order is a bit jumbled.

NOT INCLUDED: The Lost Tales: This two-part movie made several years after the series' end is basically just two more standalone episodes for Season 5, with a higher budget and better CGI.

THEN watch the Season 4 finale. Though it chronologically takes place at the end, it would be a terrible finale. Season 5's finale ends the series perfectly.

Season 5 finale: NOT INCLUDED: Box of tissues. Seriously. You need one. Or maybe three. By far the best series finale I have ever seen. That's all I'll say.

IN CONCLUSION: If you want an underrated, deeply philosophical sci-fi series full of realistic characters and issues and of course packed with epic space, gun, and fist fights, this is the series for you. It's well worth the price.",1422403200,21,6835,4.801533219761499

2073962,5,B0002B15UQ,"The DVD set is a great way to finish out your Babylon 5 collection.  There are definitely some special features that are fun to watch.  I'll go ahead and do quick reviews of the individual films:

The Gathering: A very good pilot of the show.  Great plot, great atmosphere.  Very enjoyable to see the start of the Babylon 5 Station.

In the Beginning: It's an enjoyable movie with some very memorable parts (particularly the President's speach, that will give you goosebumps!).  I was a little annoyed at the shoehorned meetup of ALL the main characters years before we see them apparently meet for the first time in the show.  It seemed rather unnatural.  And the destruction of the Black Star was at odds with the description given in the show.  But overall, solid movie.

Thirdspace:  There's nothing really bad about thirdspace.  It's like your average filler episode of Babylon 5, expanded a little longer than normal.  Worth seeing once, but probably not more than that.

River of Souls:  I was very pleasantly surprised by River of Souls.  It's an enjoyable tale about a mysterious, interesting people (the Soul Hunters).  It's got good acting and great writing.

A Call to Arms:  This is a fantastic movie that leads up to the fantastic but short-lived series Crusade.  It's got action, humor, and a badass new space ship.  My only gripe is that the battles and a few other scenes feel a little rushed - I would have liked a bigger view of the battle over Earth, we don't really see much but cloudy hazy dark shapes in space half the time.  Still, great movie that you'll want to watch again.",1415232000,5,1600,4.676258992805756

2073977,5,B0002B15UQ,"SPOILER ALERT: I've tried to be as general and non-specific as possible in talking about the series as a whole, but the only way I can present my recommendation on how to view this is by revealing that certain characters do have ""a destiny,"" even when I don't specify what it may be.

FIRST, an overall intro. These are five movies produced in conjunction with the Babylon 5 five-year TV series which totaled more than 100 episodes. The series is one continuous narrative with several --many-- interrelated story arcs. Two of the most striking things about the series is how various back-story and contextual details are only filled-in slowly, giving viewers new perspectives on what they have already seen; and how characters change and develop over time.

That is why a lot of  the reviewers here suggest following the original broadcast order, and not seeing ""In the Beginning"" first. But J. Michael Straczynski, who created this insanely great series, wrote most of the episodes and served as ""show runner""  suggests seeing In the Beginning first. It is true that you get all at once the story of the Earth Membari War and see Ambasador Mollari decades in the future and the state of his world.

JMS wrote that ""If you want to play it as a strict mystery, then no, probably don't go near ItB...but frankly, if I were going to start someone off on B5, I'd definitely want to start with ItB, which sort of skims in and out of the overall storyline in a beautiful fashion."" Essentially ItB is Mollari recounting what happened 10 years before the beginning of the series 20 years after the series ends.

That's the way it was done on TNT which was when many people were first exposed to the Babylon 5 universe as previously it had been scattered in syndication over various U.S. and Canadian stations and not well promoted.

The main reason to start with the prequel movie is that it is such a powerful and moving piece of storytelling. Unless you're a big fan of science fiction (in which case you've already seen the series) I think it will draw you to this wonderful body of work in a way that starting with the original pilot will not. Although the last scene in the movie, where Mollari asks for more of his favorite alcoholic beverage, and then watches a snippet of an encounter between two other central characters, will not make sense until you get to a specific place in the series, at the end of season 3.

That said, after ItB or instead of it, the next thing you have to see is the pilot, The Gathering. This was filmed more than a year before the series went into production; as a result, a couple of people who played characters meant to continue in the series did not return and there is a noticeable change in both how Membari character Delenn looks and how the actor portrays her. The change isn't huge but it can be a little jarring.

There is a web site called ""The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5"" that features what it calls the ""Master List"" of movies and episodes in the right viewing order. It is better if you wait on the other movies until you get to that place in this listing. Also the listing is slightly adjusted from the original air sequence for better flow and chronological order of events, as a few times shows aired out of order due to practical difficulties. Nothing major -- but you might as well go with the  intended order.

The guide also has and episode-by-episode analysis, including bringing together many of JMS's online comments and interactions with viewers especially when the series was in production. Reading the material on each episode as you watch them will add to your enjoyment but don't skip ahead in the reading.

I don't think any attempt at story-telling this epic has been attempted on television before or since, never mind succeeded as Babylon 5 does.",1410134400,,3809,4.626666666666667

You get the mysterious, exciting, and fascinating events of some of the first days of space station Babylon 5's operation, in ""The Gathering.""
You get the Lovecraftian story of terrors from beyond our realm of understand in ""Thirdspace,"" featuring Shari Belafonte.
You get the reality redefining events of ""River of Souls"" featuring Martin Sheen as a Soulhunter (not to be confused with his brother, Joe Estevez in ""Soultaker"").
And finally, you get the epic struggle against the Drakh, a race of pawns for the Shadows, as Sheridan and company race against time in ""A Call to Arms.""

2074041,5,B0002B15UQ,The graphics were crude even for its day but this defect is compensated greatly by a unique story line that involves the interactions between different species of intelligent life.  There is an almost 'Flash Gordon' quality to the computer graphics but you just tend to ignore that after awhile once hooked on the story line.,1386720000,,325,4.909090909090909

2074045,4,B0002B15UQ,"Not bad.  Unlike the TW online ""free"" version this collection actually has s1ep17 and the video quality is slightly better than what TW streams.

That said, I watched their free online until 'lo and behold s1ep17 is missing online, and ordered this collection in the feeble hope that they hadn't ""accidentally"" ""lost"" it, which they hadn't. I'll add another star once I've slogged through the rest of s1 and then 2-5 plus the movies if it all holds up.

Blu ray: ain't no way they're gonna be able to make the blu-ray whiners happy with this footage, as I suspect even the pristine film was probably shot on very low budget rates.  The CGI is showing it's age already even at DVD res.  I guess the free analog TV ""filtering"" hid alot of CGI ""sins"" from that time period...  Just have to remember that this series was ultra-low budget, just watch the props as you watch the series for an education...

[EDIT]
I suppose that I should mention that this was with a generic R/W LG DVD drive in a desktop, playback center was media center, win7 x64 pro, nvidia 780 Ti.  i.e. I'm not at all certain what, if any extra processing was done at any step in the playback v. what was streamed by TW, just that the DVD set results were WAY better and missing ep s1e17 ""Legacies"" is present on the DVD set, but missing from TW, or so last I checked, Sat/Sun?

 I had a hard time trying to buy the series locally, so I turned to Amazon.  I bought most of the series at the same time, with the exception of what little I had already found.

It is a wonderfully written character driven show with an amazing ensemble cast.  I originally purchased it simply because I am a huge Bruce Boxleitner fan, but soon became addicted.  The first season seemed a bit slow to me and I was not fond of the actor who played the Commander, but the rest of the cast was supurb and it was the beginning of many story arcs.  It's my guess I wasn't the only one who felt that way and that is why they brought Bruce Boxleitner in to start the second season and he was great as Captain Sheridan.  This space station where beings from all over the universe lived was a fascinating place.  The costumes and make-up were absolutely amazing.

Additionally, there are large and numerous defects in the original tape that flash on the scene as jagged patches. The story is great, but the gross defects in much (would estimate about 30%) of the video quality are distracting and disturbing. It seems inconceivable that there is not some software or technique that could not repair some of these damaged and out-of-focus scenes. Perhaps B5 should set up a volunteer web-site and allow B5 devotees to volunteer their time and expertise to digitally repair and patch up some of the damaged footage for later release as a ""cleaned-up"" copy? Perhaps these B5 digital repair volunteers would receive a free DVD/Blu-Ray set of the ""cleaned-up"" copy? It would be a win-win.

""The Gathering"" was the pilot for the series, and unfortunately not all that great, luckily they still picked up the series.  The special effects in Thirdspace, and River of Souls is good but the story is a bit lacking in Thirdspace.

2074154,3,B0002B15UQ,"I purchased the movie collection more for completeness sake than for any other reason. It has a reworked version of the original pilot for the series, The Gathering, that I liked enough at the time. It was much as I remembered it, intriguing enough, but not great.
The second movie in the collection,  In The Beginning, gives a more thorough reworking of the back story behind the building of the Babylon 5 station. It deals mostly with the Human-Minbari war as told by Emperor Londo Molari.  it dovetails nicely with events as outlined in the series and gives a little more feel for the end of the world desperation humans were confronting as the Minbari systematically destroyed their military forces on the way to Earth. Not bad but really requires one to have watched some of the rest of the series for any sort of appreciation of what's going on and why certain characters are given unexplained cameos.
The other movies were generally a disappointment. I was looking for more exploration of the problems on Centauri Prime after the Shadow war.  It was not forthcoming.
The Call to Arms movie isn't really worth watching.
All in all it's not a really good collection, just fair but for me for completeness sake nice. I'm thinking a collection with the first two movies would have been just as good for me.",1354838400,3,1309,4.707423580786026

2074178,5,B0002B15UQ,"Vor Jahren sah ich (wie wschl. die meiten anderen auch) diese Serie hier zum ersten mal im Free - TV. Damals noch nur an Star Trek usw. (the Next Generation, Deep Space Nine bzw. Voyager) mit allen seinen Ableger - Serien gewhnt, hielt ich ""Babylon 5"", vielleicht gerade wegen seiner sehr, - verglichen jedenfalls mit den eben genannten ! - anspruchsvollen Erzhlstruktur fr nicht unbedingt so gut. Aber erst viel spter begann sich mir, das wahre und recht komplexe B5 - Universum irgendwann zu erschlieen.

Heute, wo ich diese Serie mitlerweile in, - und auswendig kenne und auch, so richtig verstehe, kann ich sie wrmstens jedem empfehlen. Hatte dann irgendwann (dh. als es so eine komplette und totale Edition wie jetzt hier noch garnicht gegeben hat !) auch nochmal jeden Film einzeln bewertet, - bzw. versucht, zu - fast - allen verfgbaren Staffeln etwas zu kommentieren. Hier ist die gesamte Zusammenfassung davon. (ps. das ist nur meine Meinung von damals, - heutzutage wrde ich die aber leicht revidieren. Und rate absolut zum Gesamtkauf, - also auch - inclusive - der Staffeln 1 & 2 dieser Serie, - sowie smtlichen Ablegern, - Prequel, Sequel und Crossover - Filme der Reihe.)

Spacecenter Babylon 5 - Staffel 5 (6 DVD's)

Staffel 3/4/5 kaufen, - (zum verstehen) den Rest aber anschauen

Dieser nur gutgemeinte Ratschlag kann hier nur jedem sonst Durchschnittszuschauer (also nicht wirklich extremen B5 - Fan, der sich ja doch sehr wschl. trotzdem alles komplett zulegt) gegeben werden, oder eben zum wenigstens alles 1x anschauen.

Wie beispielsweise auch ""Deep Space Nine"", ""Star Trek - Voyager"" oder auch ""Enterprise"" (die Serie von 2001 - 2005, nicht das alte Original) sowie einigen anderen, - dh. mehr oder weniger guten bzw. erfolgreichen TV - Serien, fngt es auch hier erst gegen Ende der 2. und zu Beginn der 3. Staffel an, so richtig durch komplexere Haupthandlungen, auf jeden Fall spannender und interessanter zu werden (etwas, - das ganz offensichtlich viele Serien gemeinsam haben, weil dann wschl. erst nach gewisser Zuschauerakzeptanz angefangen wird, sich etwas mehr Mhe bei der Produktion zu geben). Auch ist das zum groen Teil sogar von Fans gegebene Urteil nicht 100% zutreffend, diese 5. Staffel war untig und die ganze Serie htte nach 4 Staffeln doch besser eingestellt werden sollen, ist aber auch hier wieder einmal nur lediglich reine und individuelle Geschmacks, - und persnliche Ansichtssache.

Auch wenn sich hier bereits alles stark (selbst fr den weniger kundigen Zuschauer) in Richtung Machtwechsel und / oder Verlagerung zu evtl. dann weniger wirklich interessanten Themen andeutet (auch vertrgt es sich oftmals nicht sehr gut, bereits lieb gewonnene Darsteller aus zu tauschen bzw. nach soweit gewachsenen Handlungsstrngen noch neue Schauspieler zustzlich und nachtrglich neu mit einzubringen), ist aber auch hier noch immer ein genereller Anspruch verglichen mit den ersten beiden Staffeln noch allemal gegeben und zu erkennen.

Was hier m. E. sehr gut gemacht wurde, ist das Nebenfiguren wie z. B. ""Lyta Alexander"" (Patricia Tallman) und dem Thema Telepaten - Menschen Konflikt, - ein immer wieder erwhnter Aufstand bzw. nachfolgender Krieg, der nicht mehr gezeigt wurde, war ja dabei schon bereits zu ersehen, in etlichen der besseren Folgen hier viel Spielraum eingerumt wurde oder auch die Episoden, die sich wieder mehr mit Londo Mollari und den Nachfolgern der Schatten beschftigen, es sind aber auch zugegeben einige hufig lieblos gemachte Folgen zu finden, die so wschl. ausschlielich nur den vorbehaltloseren Fans richtig gefallen werden.

Es mssen aber, trotz der gewhlten berschrift, auch die vorhergehenden, frheren Staffeln 1 & 2 zumindest ausgeliehen und wenigstens einige der Schlsselfolgen davon angesehen werden, sonst hat man keinen Einstieg mehr und kann nun berhaupt nichts mehr damit anfangen. Kauftip (bzw. Ausleihtip) hier der Staffeln 3, 4, - und bei Gefallen auch 5 bzw. aller Staffel (einschlielich 1 & 2) also nur fr reine Gelegenheitzuschauer, sonst ist alles komplett empfehlenswert.

Spacecenter Babylon 5 - Staffel 4 (Box Set, 6 DVD's)

Staffel 3/4/5 kaufen, - (zum verstehen) den Rest aber anschauen

Dieser nur gutgemeinte Ratschlag kann hier nur jedem der eher Durchschnittszuschauer (also nicht unbedingt fanatischen Fan von B5, der sich ja doch alles zusammen kaufen wird) gegeben werden. Wie beispielsweise auch ""Deep Space Nine"" oder auch ""Voyager"" fngt es erst gegen Ende der 2. und zu Beginn der 3. Staffel dieser um Lngen (verglichen zu anderen Konkurrenz - Serien) besseren Geschichten an, so richtig spannend und interessant zu werden. Auch ist das zum groen Teil sogar von Fans gegebene Urteil nicht ganz zutreffend, die 5. Staffel war untig und die Serie htte nach 4 Staffeln besser eingestellt werden sollen, ist aber auch hier wieder lediglich reine und individuelle Geschmacks, - und Ansichtssache.

So ca. zu Anfang dieser Staffel hier findet der groe Krieg gegen die Schatten erst einmal ein gutes, allerdings nur trgerisch sicheres Ende (durch die bereits von vorneherein geplante, epische Lauflnge von 5 geplanten und doch noch realisierten bzw. beinahe dann nur 4 gewordenen ist es wschl. soweit zu erklren, warum dieses Thema nicht schon bereits mit dem Abschlu der 3. Staffel richtig abgeschlossen wurde), - die Menschheit hier vor allen ist nun auf sich allein gestellt, mu einen weiteren Brgerkrieg gegen ihre eigene Erdregierung fhren sowie sich mit - in einigen seperaten Folgen dieser Staffel - den blichen Stationsproblemen befassen.

Auch wenn sich hier bereits (auch fr etwas weniger kundige Zuschauer der Serie) alles in Richtung zumindest teilweiser Machtwechsel und bereits Verlagerung zu evtl. weniger interessanten Themen ab der 5 Staffel dann andeuten werden, so ist der immer noch generelle Anspruch verglichen zu den ersten beiden Staffeln gestiegen. Auch mit durch die eher komplexerere Haupthandlung anstelle frheren meitens kleinen und in sich geschlossenen Episoden.

Ob es nun wirklich zwingend notwendig gewesen ist, nun auch hinterher noch eine fnfte Staffel zu drehen, oder besser die Serie hier mit der schon bereits fertig produzierten und sehr guten Abschlufolge (in Staffel 5) enden zu lassen, wird wschl. ein guter Streitpunkt bei Fans ebenso wie den daran weniger interessierten bleiben. Und dies sollte ein jeder ganz fr sich entscheiden und beurteilen (ich sage es mal so, - generell falsch war es nicht direkt).

Es mssen aber, trotz der gewhlten berschrift, auch die vorhergehenden, frheren Staffeln 1 & 2 zumindest ausgeliehen und zumindest dabei einige der Schlsselfolgen angesehen werden,sonst hat man keinen Zugang mehr. Kauftip (bzw. Ausleihtip) hier der Staffeln 3, 4, - und bei Gefallen auch 5 bzw. aller Staffeln (einschlielich 1 & 2) also nur fr reine Gelegenheitzuschauer, sonst ist alles komplett empfehlenswert.

Auch ist das zum groen Teil sogar von Fans gegebene Urteil nicht ganz zutreffend, die 5. Staffel war untig und die Serie htte nach 4 Staffeln besser eingestellt werden sollen, ist aber auch hier wieder lediglich reine und individuelle Geschmacks,- und Ansichtssache.

Ab dieser Staffel beginnt sich der groe Krieg gegen die mysterisen Schatten sowie noch nebenher der Aufstand gegen die Erdregierung zu entwickeln bzw. es gibt etliche extrem spannende Folgen mit Gefechten (wobei halbwegs realistisch hierbei nicht stndig und malos bertrieben Gerusche wie Explosionen und Schsse usw.usf. bei Kmpfen im Weltraum zu hren sind, - ein deutlicher Vorteil und anders als z. B. bei ""Deep Space Nine""),auch das Thema Verstrickungen und Gewissenskonflikt von Centauri Botschafter Londo Mollari und der sptere Aufstieg der Telepaten bzw. der ab der 5. Staffel dann nher beleuchtete Machtfaktor derselben, mndend in einen weiteren, - allerdings nicht mehr gezeigten Konflikt wird ausreichend behandelt.

Auch einige (bei Insidern der SF - Materie) Gastauftritte, - wie z. B. der von Majel Barrett (vielen wschl. besser bekannt als ""Lwaxana Troi"" aus den diversen Star Trek - Serien mit ihren vielen Ablegern), brigends eine der wenigen Darsteller, die in - dh. fast - allen wichtigen Serien prent waren, sind nicht zu verachten und der generelle Anspruch steigt nun durch die eher komplexere Haupthandlung anstelle von vorher meitens kleineren und in sich abgeschlossenen Episoden doch deutlich.

Es mssen aber, trotz der gewhlten berschrift, auch die vorhergehenden, frheren Staffeln 1 & 2 zumindest ausgeliehen und zumindest dabei einige der Schlsselfolgen angesehen werden,sonst hat man keinen Zugang mehr. Kauftip (bzw. Ausleihtip) hier der Staffeln 3, 4, - und bei Gefallen auch 5 bzw. aller Staffel (einschlielich 1 & 2) also nur fr reine Gelegenheitzuschauer, sonst ist alles komplett empfehlenswert.

Babylon 5 - the Movies (6 DVD's, inkl. Legende der Ranger)

fr B5 - Fans wschl. ein Pflichtkauf, - sonst jedenfalls Ausleihtip

Tja, - hier sind sie alle und dazu auch noch ziemlich preisgnstig verfgbar, die 4 (dh. mehr oder weniger wichtigen) Ableger - Filme zur Sci - Fi Serie ""Spacencenter - Babylon 5"" inclusive des (hier mehr berflssig gewesenen) Zusatzfilm's ""Legende der Ranger"" , - war ein Pilot zu einer eigenen, allerdings recht schnell dann wieder eingestellten und nicht sehr erfolgreichen Nachahmungsserie mit dem hier noch nicht verstorbenen Andreas Katsulas (""Mafia - eine Nudel macht noch keine Spaghetti"") als einzigen mit Wiedererkennungseffekt in einer kleinen Nebenrolle. Der leider nun berhaupt nicht mehr wenigstens halbwegs den Anreiz der brigen Filme besitzt.

Deshalb (was alle sonst interessierten aber nicht davon abhalten sollte !) gibt es auch den lediglich einen Stern abgezogen, ist aber nur meine ganz persnliche Anssichts, - und reine Geschmackssache. Ich selbst wrde also z. B. nicht unbedingt diesen Film jetzt einzeln nachkaufen wollen. Nur wie hier als Bonus aus Grnden einer Vollstndigkeit und fr die komplette DVD - Sammlung der ganzen Serie.

Obwohl, das betrifft keinen eingefleischten Fan, der hier bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt sowieso dann bereits seine Filme besitzt, - ""Waffenbrder"", ebenfalls so etwas wie ein verbindender Anschlu, - und Einstiegsfilm zur letzten Staffel von B5 bzw. zu einer zwar noch deutlich besseren, aber ebenso wenig vom ""breiteren"" Publikum angenommen und somit vorzeitig wieder eingestellten (obligatorischen) Nachfolgerserie, - Titel: ""Crusade"". Sowie ""die Zusammenkunft"", - der Pilotfilm zur Originalserie (jedenfalls, auch wichtig fr weniger infomierte Gelegenheitszuschauer dann sptestens ab der Staffel 3 bis 4, - und evtl. auch noch 5), - ""der erste Schritt"", - Prequel Film, mit ausfhrlicher eingehenden Handlung auf Themen, die immer wieder in der spteren, fast epischen Gesamtserie angesprochen und auch mehrmals gezeigt wurden.

Sowie ein schnes Wiedersehen mit alten Gesichtern, - wie Michael O'Hare als Captain Sinclair und mit darin gleichzeitig sein Nachfolger Bruce Boxleitner (""Agentin mit Herz"") als - dh. hier noch - ""nur"" 1. Offizier.

Und auch, - gibt es sozusagen hier noch als Geschenk, ""das Tor zur 3. Dimension"", - ein ebenfalls sehr wichtiger und berzeugender Zwischen, - bzw. Einschubfilm, - ca. passend in die Mitte  und den Anfang der Staffel 4. Und noch vor der bis dahin zwar bereits vorgesehenen, aber fast nicht realisierten Staffel 5. Oder ""der Flu der Seelen"", - ein ganz netter, aber auch nicht allzu besonderer, zustzlicher Film mit bergang's - Schauspielern (z. B. Tracy Scoogins, - durch mehr kleinere, vorrangig hbsch anzusehenden Statisten - Nebenrollen mit dazu noch etwas Text in etlichen der mehr oder weniger erfolgreichen Filmen und Serien einen doch ziemlichen Bekanntheitsgrad erreicht) und Stars der allerersten Generation (wie Jerry Doyle, - auch hier wieder in seiner Rolle als Michael Garibaldi).

Die sich zwar noch lohnen knnten, - aber sonst wschl. mehr richtigen Fans der eigentlichen Serie gefallen werden. Auch, da viele Anspielungen, Kommentare und Rckblenden o.. zu gewissen Schlsselszenen usw. aus dem B5 - Universum angedeutet sind. So das leicht der allgemeine Durchblick etwas schwer fallen wird bei allen, die bisher von der ursprnglichen Serie noch garnichts gesehen haben.

Es ist also (Fazit) wirklich nicht ganz unerheblich, die Serie vorher bzw. wenigstens noch nachtrglich mit dazu auszuleihen und mindestens 1x sich anzuschauen. Jedenfalls dann fr alle mehr unwissenden und wenn auch hier nicht gro(artig) erwartet wird, nur reine Schlachtenfilme mit ewigen Weltraumkmpfen oder extrem kernigen Dialogen sowie dabei hufig stark bertriebener Effekthascherei zu erhalten. Sonst bei Durschnittszuschauern fr ein abwechslungsreiches Filmwochende ganz empfehlenswert. Kauftip (hinterher einzeln / komplett, je nach Preis und Gefallen), oder (verglichen zu Konkurrenz - Serien) alternativer Ausleihtip.

Betrifft also jetzt die (quasi, - in einer Art - Zusammenfassung) "" Spacecenter Babylon 5 - Complete Collection [auf insgesamt 37 DVD's] "" hier, - absolute Kauf, - und Leihempfehlung. Selten werden sie jemals wieder solch ein absolut episches Gesamt, - und Meisterwerk finden. ;-)",1353196800,,13652,5.483333333333333
2074179,5,B0002B15UQ,"What more can I say? I thoroughly enjoyed watching these movies. However, be aware that there is a proper sequence and timing (intermingled through the series episodes) in which to watch these movies, because Babylon 5 is one HUGE, very entertaining, five-seasons-of-television-episodes-long story. In addition to all this, there are novels and even comic books (the latter now almost impossible to find.)",1353024000,,405,5.548387096774194
2074180,5,B0002B15UQ,"I bought the entire 5 year series of Babylon 5 about six years ago and recently, while watching it again I realized I was missing the introduction movie entitled ""The Gathering"". You really need to see the movie because it sets up what is going on in the Babylon 5 series. Even more important that this movie is another one called ""In the Beginning"" that explains why the Babylon station was built in the first place.

I was looking for the ""The Gathering"" on Amazon and found this set of all 5 of the movies including ""A Call To Arms"" which is the setup movie to the short lived series named ""Crusade"" which only lasted half a season with 13 episodes being made.

I was looking for a used set of these movies (hoping to save some money) and found it on Amazon for around $30. I then noticed one place was selling it NEW for $22.71 with the shipping cost of $2.98 bringing the total to $25.69!!!

With the absolute lowest USED price of right at $27.95 (plus shipping) I decided to ""chance"" the new set of movies but in the back of my mind I was thinking this new price is too good to be true.

After receiving the DVD movie set about 10 days later, I realized my apprehension was unfounded. It was a nicely boxed set of new movies as advertised by the company named ""dvdbarginbuy"".

Inside the dust jacket box there's plastic box that contains 5 DVD discs with all 5 movies on them. There are also ""special features"" included on most of the discs.

I was extremely pleased with all of the DVD's and still can't believe they were less expensive if bought new than used.

If you decide to buy this set I'd advise you to watch them out of sequence. Watch movie # 2 (In The Beginning) first and then watch movies number 1, 3, 4, and 5 in that order as this is how they would fall into place if you were to watch the entire Babylon 5 series.",1352073600,2,1836,4.258620689655173

2074187,5,B0002B15UQ,"There have been a number of reviews done on the "" Babylon - 5 "" series and the movies. Some of them have been good and some not so good.  Some of the reviews have even tried to describe the proper way to watch the series along with the movies.  Babylon - 5 was one of the most awesome science fiction television series ever produced and sadly, the spin-offs were short lived. TNT television executives really missed the train and due to their shortsightedness and greed, caused the demise of what could have been the most profitable and the greatest science fiction television space opera in history. Babylon - 5 was well written and produced. It had the effect of drawing the viewer into the lives, loves and actions of all the characters that came and went.  I have been a Star Trek fan forever but I think that in many ways, Babylon - 5 surpassed the Star Trek series and that is saying a lot because Star Trek was one of the best.  With all the reviews, no one has actually mentioned the one phenomenal and IMO, the most interesting technical segment about the series; all the graphics production was produced on a group of 16 plus Amiga 2000 computers with "" video toaster "" graphics cards.  The whole series with movies was very low budget when you consider the expensive computers, network servers, miscellaneous equipment and army of technicians and artists used today, to produce all the latest science fiction shows and movies. The small production company that produced Babylon - 5 was highly skilled and way ahead of their time. When you consider this, it just makes this series package with movies, all that more valuable and worth watching.  As I consider what is currently available for watching in today's movie market, this packaged series is an amazing value and should be a standout part of every person's science fiction space collection. I only wish the series had continued on like the Star Trek series. This is not a series collection you want to pass up, if you are a serious science fiction space fan, this would be a mistake to pass by.",1346630400,,2062,4.620218579234972

2074201,2,B0002B15UQ,"I watched Babylon Five the TV series with enthusiasm. I consider it unique as I consider it  the first TV Novel. I was disappointed when Legend of the Rangers wasn't picked up and when Crusade was canceled. I recently bought this Babylon Five TV Movie collection, surprised it existed, was so highly rated here and yet, I had never heard of it.

In my opinion, the set represents J. Michael Straczynski's version of ""I'm out to lunch"" project! Another great sci-fi master, director George Lucas, did similar odd stuff. He went back and ruined his first film, a sleeper gem, ""THX1138"". I cannot believe what he did to his film for the Director's Cut DVD releases. Its like a master painter drawing with crayons over his own  great work of art.

My advice is to skip this set. There is nothing to recommend them to anyone who has seen the TV series or the spin off chows. the brilliant doctor, the Narn ambasador and the female station commander (Lt Commander Ivanava) is missing from most of the set. I'd be really angry about the set had  I not bought it for under $15. Forget disc 5. The background sound and music is downright bad B movie quality, reminding me of the goofy music and sounds used for the highly camp, miscast TV series ""Space 1995"". The entire 5th movie takes place on one set and the actors seem to be just saying lines. It is just plain bad, odd ball camp at best. I highly recommend  the series: ""Crusade"", the ""Legend of the Rangers"" TV Movie-Pilot and the masterpiece 110 episode Babylon 5 but forget the movie set.

We sit 8 feet away from a 60"" HDTV that has been ISF calibrated and use a BluRay player that is highly regarded for its HDTV up-conversion.  The DVD's are widescreen and are enhanced for widescreen TVs (i.e. anamorphic) .  This show was one of the first to use CGI.  Scenes with no CGI look good considering the age of the show with excessive film grain visible on occasional scenes.  However, scenes with CGI have noticeably worse picture quality.  Overall, the picture quality was better than I expected considering some of the reviews and comments I've seen on the internet.

In my opinion B5 - along with Twilight Zone and the re-make of BSG - is one of best SciFi shows ever made, making occasional ""jaggies"" only a minor annoyance that don't get in the way of an amazing story.",1319241600,4,1079,4.409090909090909
2074206,5,B0002B15UQ,"The Babylon 5 Series is probably the best Science Fiction Series for TV ever made.

You must endure the first season (which has lots of hints needed for later)!

The series was plagued by politics as is all science fiction due to the costs vs. the costs of adult comedy & non reality reality shows. So the series is kinda out of order.

Season 4 was the end of the show. So the very last episode of Season 4 should be watched after the entire series, movies, and sequel series (Crusade & Jeremiah).

The prequel (""In the Beginning"") was actually released in Season 5 when TNT reran the show and contracted for Season 5 and some movies. (The prequel is told as a ""past history"" so a few hints from season 1 are given early if you watch the prequel first.)

So watch ""In The Beginning"" > ""The Gathering"" > Season 1-4 (but last episode of season 4) > Season 5 Episode 1-3 > ""Thirdspace"" rest of Season 5 but last episode > River of Souls > Call to Arms (the prequel to Crusade) > ""Lost Tales"" > Last episode of Season 5 and then last episode of Season 4.

Then optionally watch or insert after ""Lost Tales"" the rest of the story...

Crusade Series (dropped by TNT after show 13)... OK, not great to watch, but could have been if profit had not gotten in the way.

Jeremiah Series (cut short too).  OK, not great to watch.

2074208,5,B0002B15UQ,"...And so begins the five year story of J. Michael Straczynski's Babylon 5. Anything I say in a review won't do this show justice. It simply is one of those eternal shows that stays with you, even though the effects look dated, even if it doesn't have the same name recognition as Star Trek or Star Wars.

Every now and again, far less often than we'd hope it will, there comes a series that shows what television could be. Television can be intelligent. It can push the creative boundaries of storytelling. It can be a place for big ideas and (dare I say) philosophy. Babylon 5 is one of those shows.

This set is really *the* way to see this revolutionary show. Unlike the past combo package, you get the movie collection as well which is well worth having. At least two of the movies (""The Gathering"" and ""In the Beginning"") are crucial to the story. Also, the packaging was not as good quality-wise before the ""repackage"" set was released. I've had to glue my old sets back together multiple times. Plus, right now Amazon is offering this set at a great price.

Now a little more about the series and why it's worth seeing -

The Babylon 5 story arc was planned out in full from the very beginning by series creator J. Michael Straczynski as a novel for television. Because of this, it was very innovative for its time. Even today, there has been nothing else quite like it. It is so meticulously planned out that there are layers within layers of complexity and various, seemingly unrelated, plot threads that come together in unexpected ways. Some things that happen in season one will resurface again two or three seasons later. You can rewatch this series multiple times and still find new insights.

One of the great things about B5 is its ability to play with our expectations. Things don't happen and are not resolved in a traditional way. Also, every now and then there will be a curveball episode completely off traditional TV format. Some of these turned out to be among the best in the series.

So the plot is rich and mind-blowing, and then the characters are well-developed and finely nuanced. Characters hardly get better than this on TV. They are all multi-dimensional and hardly ever fall into neat good-guy/bad-guy divisions. They are somewhere in between, they have pasts and make mistakes or terrible decisions, but they always have a reason behind their actions that we can if not sympathize with, at least understand. Your opinion of a character can change completely in the course of just one season. The simple, ordinary and extraordinary human-ness of all the characters - even the aliens - brings the larger-than-life plot down to earth (so to speak). In the midst of all the battles and political intrigue, we cannot forget that this is also about the personal journeys of this group of misfits stuck together on a space station in the middle of it all.

This is a series worthy of being called a classic. It deals with universal issues like power, xenophobia, self-sacrifice, heroism, and leadership quite deftly and without ever being pedantic or moralizing. I can't think of another show that so skillfully explores both the good and the dark side of the human psyche and our potential for destruction or hope. Most stick with one side or the other.",1316131200,14,3282,4.717277486910994
2074209,5,B0002B15UQ,"What can I say about Babylon 5? This has been my favourite science fiction series since it's release on tv, and I believe that it will continue to be for the remaining of my life. JMS does a unique job, of telling a tale that is epic and personal, of gods and men, Quoting one of the characters: Noone in Babylon 5 is what he appears. and as the show progresses you see character development,and growth. Even characters that are minor and seem comic relieve end up being crucial. I just wish B5 would go on as a franchise. No, not as a franchise but as an epic story told by the master JMS. I hold this tale dear to my heart and plan to watch it again and again, and in the future when all the effects are dated all the makeup seem silly show it to my kids, so that they may see that even with limited resources faith manages. To all the cast and crew of B5, my best wishes to you all.",1315699200,11,885,4.034090909090909
2074210,5,B0002B15UQ,"Babylon 5 has been recently re-released with all new packaging, smaller plastic cases as opposed to the glued cardboard cases that were part of the initial release.  This is a good change (The glue had a tendency to melt and the plastic innards would fall out damaging the disks.) plus the price is far less then the 40-60 dollar first editions.  Yes, they probably should have included the Legend of the Rangers and Lost Tales Movies, but by buying those separately you can show WB that there is still interest in this show.  (I'd gladly pay an extra 30 bucks if it'd mean that more B5 would come out).  I hope this helps people looking at the difference between the 2 versions listed here on Amazon.  I highly recommend watching these movies, they add quite a bit to the B5 universe.  However, these movies are out of order (they always have been).  If you watch In the Beginning, due to the way it's told, you will be given many spoilers to the rest of the series (even though the main story takes place prior to The Gathering.)  You will not miss anything if you don't watch In the Beginning.  I would recommend watching in this order as to get the full affect and placements of these movies and the series.

It also has 5 disks; the cover art is the same. So what's new?

That said, should you buy this edition? Well, DUH! It's J. Michael Straczynski, people! You will *not* be bored. (I must emphasize that the following is based on the older release and assumes that there are no real differences between the two sets.)

 ""The Gathering"" is the B5 pilot (and there are several differences between it and the TV series).

 ""In the Beginning"" tells the story of the Human-Minbari War. (If you need an explanation as to what that means, don't buy this set!)

 ""Thirdspace"" is a horror story homage to H. P. Lovecraft. (You will either love it or hate it; there's no middle ground.)

 ""The River of Souls"" is based on the return of the ""Soul Hunters"" from the TV series, and deals with the problem of being absolutely dead wrong when someone thought they were being merciful. (The ""holo-brothel"" sub-plot is enjoyable: Captain Lochley has her image pirated. So you get to see Tracy Scoggins parading around in negligee.)

 ""A Call To Arms"" is the pilot for the spin-off ""Crusade"" (If you have the collected ""Crusade"" TV series and you don't have ""A Call To Arms"", you don't have the full story.)",1298937600,15,1501,4.605263157894737

*THE GATHERING - Watch prior to starting Season 1 (episode 1)

*IN THE BEGINNING - Recommended to watch at the end of Season 5 (episode 20) prior to the final episodes but you can watch this after season 3 ends and not have any spoilers.  IMO it seems to fit better at the end of season 3 just before season 4.

*THIRD SPACE - Watch after episode 7 of season 4

*RIVER OF SOULS - watch prior to watching the final episode of season 5

*CALL TO ARMS - can be watched prior to the final episode of season 5 or even after season 5

left off is the movie LEGEND OF THE RANGERS.  While Legend of the Rangers wasn't the best production it still has a strong place in the Babylon 5 lore so it is a shame it was left out.

The 5 movies  above are not only very entertaining, but help to provide a deeper understanding of the Babylon 5 lore and setting the ground work for many plot devices that occur during the show's 5 season run.

in my opinion: the two weakest of the movies are  CALL TO ARMS and THE GATHERING, while the best is hands down IN THE BEGINNING.

THE GATHERING is actually a good series premier special that lays the foundation for much of the drama to come.  It just seems very obvious there was budget restrictions and some of the characters seemed out of place.  The story however is very good and as some reviews pointed out -- it is worth returning to re-watch this movie after season 3 to see if you can spot all the clues the movie cryptically gave you about the main plot.",1289952000,2,1621,4.180645161290323

Between 'In the Beginning' and 'The Gathering,' the action, suspense, and edge of your seat suspense of how will they get out of this impossible situation will keep you glued to the tv till it's over.
'Thirdspace,' my favorite, is a wonderful mystery all on its own, and the nail biting end, the worries of will good win over evil is one of those classic 'against all odds' sort of situations that makes any moview worth watching.'
'River of Souls,' whatever you may think of the afterlife, this will bring back that old phrase of there being some things worse than death. Not only does this science fiction version of the ghost story pack an intellectual punch, but it makes this fan of the series happy that they finally expanded on a much underrated, and, in my oppinion, unappreciated species, the Soul Hunters, and their technology.
""A Call to Arms"" may be the last movie in the collection, and it may have been intended as a series premiere for Crusade, the sequel, but is a wonderful stand alone movie. I wish it was longer, because there's so much story crammed into this near one hour and a half movie, but its worth it, and brings home the message of 'If I don't act, who will?""

In the Beginning is a prequel movie, which covers the events of the Human-Minbari war.

Thirdspace was very neat. One of the assumptions about B5 is that you can have coherent civilizations within a galaxy, but not between galaxies. Thirdspace breaks this assumption by means of a lost Vorlon device that basically creates a faster hyperspace. It leads to a dominant species from a different galaxy, who are basically the Vorlons of their galaxy, only evil.

A Call to Arms is fabulous, but it is also depressing as it will make you watch the excellent and canceled Crusade.

Started rewatching with one of my daughters.. man, I'm like a kid with a new toy!!!",1207353600,,417,4.291139240506329
2074240,3,B0002B15UQ,"Getting into the BABYLON 5 universe can be confusing for newcomers.  To see everything you really need the DVDs in this box as well as all five seasons of BABYLON 5 the series and the single-season series CRUSADE.  I'm going to give a simplified chronology.  You can make it even more precise by putting one movie in between two episodes of a single season, but I don't think you gain too much by doing that.

First watch BABYLON 5: THE GATHERING from this boxed set.  To be blunt, it is not very good at all.  It is basically a pilot and not an especially compelling one.  We meet some -- but by no means all -- of the important characters of forthcoming seasons, and get a taste of the B5 universe, but this is just a dull, chatty, uninteresting debut.  And the make up for G'Kar looked like it was in planning stages!  Very, very different from how he looked on the subsequent series.

Next, watch Seasons One through Four of BABYLON 5 the series.  The first season is slightly more interesting than the pilot, but not by much.  Season Two gets slightly more interesting, especially near the end of the season when the Shadows plot really kicks into gear.  From this point to the end of Season Four B5 is incredibly compelling.  Just be patient watching the first two seasons.  You'll start getting hints in Season Two of how good it will eventually get, but there will still be plenty of dullish episodes instead.  The series is not terribly balanced because the network changed its plans a couple of times, first telling Straczynski that the series was going to wrap up at the end of Season Four and then, after he had collapsed two season's worth of stories into one, telling him that the show would be renewed for one more season.  So much for planning.

Next, before watching Season Five, watch another movie in this set, IN THE BEGINNING.  This is far and away the best of the B5 movies and is fully as good and as entertaining as Seasons Three and Four.  It goes back before the beginning of the series, giving the details of the Minbari was.  But the narrative assumes you've seen the first four seasons.

Next, watch Season Five of BABYLON 5.  Because he really had a different story arc planned for Season Five one had to be created pretty quickly.  The whole telepath arc simply never caught fire and it does not represent the best of B5.  The last third of the season focuses on the decline and fall of Centauri Prime and this is B5 at its best.  There are a string of very, very good episodes as well as a very beautiful series finale.  Mention must also be made of a lovely episode in the first half of the season written by the great Neil Gaiman.

Season Five was actually broadcast in split seasons and a couple of the movies -- THIRDSPACE and RIVER OF SOULS -- were broadcast before the series actually finished.  Your call.  Neither is all that great and neither really requires to be seen at a certain point.

The next movie, however, BABYLON 5: A CALL TO ARMS, should be viewed after the end of the series and the previously mentioned movies, and before the series CRUSADE.  This episode features Bruce Boxleitner very prominently as Sheridan and is probably his last great hurrah in the series.  The movie introduces the new and highly advanced space ship Excalibur and deals with a Drakh attack on earth, infecting it with a slow-acting virus that will kill all life on earth if a cure is not found (but since B5 the TV series gave us multiple glimpses into the future, we know that doesn't happen).  This required the need for a search for a cure for the virus, a search that was continued on the quickly cancelled CRUSADE.  The show never really got off the ground, but it had some interesting characters (especially Galen, played by Peter Woodward, who also appeared in the films A CALL TO ARMS and LOST TALES).  I do recommend that fans of B5 see CRUSADE.

The next movie was THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS: TO LIVE AND DIE IN STARLIGHT.  Horrible.  This is the worst of all the B5 movies, the worst thing ever done in the entire run of the show.  I honestly don't even recommend this for fans of the show.  The most I can say in support of it is that it is one's last chance to see Andreas Katsulas as G'Kar.  He died a couple of years later of lung cancer.

Last, and not quite least, there is 2007's THE LOST TALES.  It is definitely not as bad as THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS, but not as good as IN THE BEGINNING.  My reaction was that it was nice to see some familiar characters again (mainly just Tracy Scoggins's Captain Lochley, Bruce Boxleitner's Sheridan, and Peter Woodward's Galen).  But definitely not B5 at its best.  Most fans describe it as ""chatty.""  There are entire scenes devoted to nothing but talk, and not terribly good talk at that.

A lot to see.  For me the heart consists of the end of Season Two, all of Seasons Three and Four, the movie IN THE BEGINNING, and the last third of Season Five.  My advice to anyone newly approaching B5 is to stick it out through it all.  Much of it is dull, some of it even downright bad, but the best is very good indeed.

""A Call to Arms is the most important of the TV films, laying the ground for the future TV series Crusade..."" While it was a nice movie, this one doesn't even come close to having the same plot significance as any of the other four, in terms of the five-year story arc.  But of course one would have to know that there was a five-year story arc.

""Set five years after the Shadow War, it tells the story of a Drahk revenge attack on Earth."" - the name is Drakh, OK?

""The cliffhanger ending sets the scene for new starship Excalibur to boldly go on a five-year mission to explore strange new worlds...""  And what other TV series is Gary S. Dalkin confusing this with?

I disagree with the reviewer who said the movie doesn't give much away; that is absolutely incorrect.  Much of the fun of watching the series is watching plot elements unfold in a very deliberate way, as intended by the series creator and executed brilliantly in the series.

A good pilot to an excellent series, Babylon 5 - The Gathering, brings to the screen the parallel stories of prominent people aboard a major station under Human control in neutral territory.

The setting is the Babylon 5 space station orbiting Epsilon 3. The year is 2257, nine years after the Earth-Minbari War (one year before the series begins), and representatives from the four major space-faring races, the Centauri, Humans, Minbari, Narns, as well as numerous minor races have all gathered at B5 in a last effort at maintaining galactic peace. The arrival, however, of the fifth major space-faring race's ambassador, the Vorlon Kosh, will result in quite a bit of turbulence...

Michael O'Hare, Mira Furlan, Andreas Katsulas, Peter Jurasik, and the rest of the cast, carry out their performances well though one can tell that they are a bit uneasy, as is the case with most series in the beginning.  4 Stars

In the Beginning: Guaranteed to shed a tear

The year is 2278 and an elderly Emperor Mollari sensing his end is nearing narrates the story of the Earth-Minbari War and its heroes to a young Centauri boy, his sister and their nanny.

Bruce Boxleitner, Mira Furlan, Andreas Katsulas, Peter Jurasik, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors' performances are highly commendable.

In the Beginning contains a lot of information found within the first four seasons of B5 and then more, therefore, it should be viewed at some point during season V, preferably right before Sleeping in Light, the last of the original episodes.  5 Stars

Thirdspace: ""It's anti-life itself""

Though I haven't yet read the book (for which I've heard good things), Thirdspace the movie was quite a disappointment.

Set during Season IV, the crew of Babylon 5 recovers a huge ancient artifact, which when activated could bring more doom and destruction than the Shadows themselves...

1) To start with there is no Garibaldi, Gkar or Londo and their absence is definitely felt.

2) Everybody is too stiff.  Performances seem forced and not natural, especially Dellen and Vir who are not their usual selves.

3) Sheridan scoots through an intense space battle in a space suit (!), dodging both friendly and hostile fire (!), plants a nuke manually (!), gets out avoiding the guardians (!), survives the nuclear blast and then jokes with Delenn... Hmmm... Am I missing something?

4) Finally the elevated level of horror served as a repellent more than anything else.

2.5 Stars

The River of Souls: ""Life in Death... Immortality!""

The year is 2263, six months after President Sheridan's departure for Minbar, and the Soul Hunters return with an unexpected visit to Babylon 5... en mass.

Though most of the major characters are absent (similarly to Thirdspace), excluding Captain Lochley, Security Chief Zack Allen, Lt Corwin, and Michael Garibaldi, the River of Souls turns out to be excellent in every possible way; the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful!

There is also the surprise, though not great, appearance by Martin Sheen, who probably should have stuck to the original plan and played the archeologist instead of the Soul Hunter.  4.5 Stars

A Call to Arms: Now this is a Babylon 5 Movie!

AMAZING from start to finish, A Call to Arms brings to the screen the long awaited conflict with the hated Drakh!  The Year is 2267 and President Sheridan is contacted by the Techno-Mages who have been keeping tabs on the Shadows' former servants/allies and who inform him that the Drakh are on the warpath.  Their target... Earth!

Bruce Boxleitner, Jerry Doyle, Jeff Conaway, Tracy Scoggins, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the special effects are simply incredible!

So never miss them!  One may watch them first, or after watching some episodes of the TV series.  Movie 3, Thirdspace, is about aliens whom even the builders of jump gates feared.  This may be a homage to Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.  Movie 4, The River of Souls, is about soul hunters that appeared somewhere in the TV series.  These two may seem nonessential, but I think maybe Straczynski wanted to say such powerful godlike beings still err.  Movie 5, A Call to Arms, is a prelude to Crusade series, which is also sold as a DVD boxed set.  Galen and Dureena, regular characters in Crusade, make their first appearances.  We see how they constructed the ship Excalibur, commanded by Captain Guideon in Crusade.  Maybe one should watch this before watching Crusade series, if timeline is considered important.

It's a strange thing. I loved watching Babylon 5, and one of B5's strengths was the fact that its plots were interwoven and built up over time; every episode was a part of the larger whole. (Most of) the films in this collection, however, are stand-alone plots. They feel like big episodes, and not even the best stand-alone episodes that B5 has delivered (or even close). For instance, the River of Souls film deals with the Soul Collectors, but the first season episode about them was actually better.

One of the problems is that, in several of these films, a lot of the cast are missing (including, in River of Souls [which is really pretty bad], Sheridan). Although fans of Capt. Lochley (there must be some, right?) will be happy because, if you take away Sheridan, Delenn, G'Kar, Londo, Lennier, Vir, etc., you have to spend more time getting to know her. What choice is there? The cast in River of Souls is so sparse that we finally get to develop that one unnamed Lieutenant whose been there since the beginning.

Otherwise, Thirdspace and A Call to Arms are both fairly forgettable (though the latter might be better if one has seen Crusade, which I haven't). The prequel film is interesting, but very little of consequence happens. The only movie that is really essential to Babylon 5 viewing is the pilot, but even there, so many cast members get immediately replaced that a person could start at Season 1 with very little sense of having missed out.

If possible, see the pilot before watching Season 1. Otherwise... ehh... some of it's okay, but most of it is beneath the otherwise stellar quality of this series.",1139875200,28,1878,4.681818181818182

THE GATHERING (the series pilot)- 3 Stars. Pretty darn clunky and quirky, The Gathering still has a lovely evocation of the station's alien environment - the best of the whole series, perhaps.  Much of the acting is frustrating, but I have rewatched this movie the most of the bunch and it doesn't fail to continually please in atmosphere and implication of a great world-depth over time (mostly due to the art direction and the opening travelogue of the station.)  Thank goodness the right half of this cast was replaced, though.  And thanks, too, to J.M.S. for justifying those characters' existences anyway later on in the series with references and returns (particularly Lyta's.)

THIRDSPACE - 3 Stars. Trippy, almost great, but finally a big mess.  Beautiful images of surreal universe-bending.  Some awful, awful station mayhem scenes.  Lovely, artful, ambitious CGI. Generally, a lot of nonsense plotwise. This feels like a TV movie made to have something to try out the CG artists' skills with... and to maybe suggest a B5 horror movie with sci-fi CG without actually being one.  Contemporaneous Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within and Independence Day (the inside the mothership scenes) contain better CG images though, and of the same kind of eerie sci-fi/horror subjects... the suggestion of alien environment so threatening it seethes...

In the Beginning - 4 or 5 stars, depending on my warmongering mood - The epic Minbari War series prelude - essential to any Babylon 5 fan's appreciation of the show. Chapters of it are better than other chapters of it... for several reasons. The whole is pretty incredible.  Lovely expressionist direction on the whole... Love that Vejar light-play.  But parts that add up to the sum are fairly crappy in places, especially due to some peculiarities of the typically speechy J.M.S., so: Great Whole, Less Great Sum.  The last chapters, especially, though fairly full of war-glory, are just awesome.  Enjoy the tightly knitted plots and pieces of multiple series episodes into this one movie. Extremely clever and often quite moving stuff, this. (Despite its prelude status, don't watch this one until after season four of the series unless you want to be spoiled.)

The River of Souls - 1 star - a curiosity for drunk fans.  Laugh, cry, have a pizza.  This movie is CG-pretty, but, frankly, very dull and kind of pointless once Ian McShane's character gets possessed. A great big waste of potential with a pre-West-Wing Martin Sheen slumming it in a truly bizarre performance. Unless, that is, you are a huge fan of Captain Lochley, who has her brightest limelight in this film.

A Call to Arms - 2 or 3 stars (depending on how grumpy I am that Crusade didn't stay on) - The pilot to Crusade.  This movie's got some really strange pacing, incredibly predictable plotting, dead time galore where suspense should reign, and a rather cheesy sensibility, as though it was made for less than your average episode... and it never gets a real momentum going, despite the high level of stakes in the actual events of the thing.  Shame.  However, the intro to Crusade is very valuable and the patience that it does have for such an introduction is firmly in step with the strange, ponderous, verging-on-majestic pace of that series.  Don't watch this movie in a vacuum; as a Babylon 5 component, it's oddly very off key and off-putting.  Notice the beginning of the weird, atonal and quirky Crusade incidental music style...

AND I still haven't seen The Legend of the Rangers: To Live and Die in Starlight and it's not in my DVD collection, dammit.

To speak of these DVDs, I'd say that this is a fine collection.  There are commentaries to treasure (In the Beginning and The Gathering) and commentaries to avoid (The River of Souls and A Call to Arms ... unless of, course, as I said before, you're drunk and with friends... distracted.)  The documentaries are fine and interesting, though.

And finally, really, I must heartily recommend this stuff, flawed as it is, flawed as the strange, occasionally brilliant series it comes from was.  And... I also recommend Crusade, once you've suffered through A Call to Arms. Enjoy. Drink a little bit. Be Merry.",1138233600,31,4487,4.928191489361702

2074272,4,B0002B15UQ,"I really got into Babylon 5 when it moved to TNT.  Yes, I was slightly behind.  Therefore, I saw many of these movies early in the process of getting to know the show and never sat down to watch them again until recently.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.

This is a five disc set containing all five movies shown on TNT.  The only Bab 5 movie missing is ""Legend of the Rangers.""  I'm guessing that legal issues are holding it up since it's still not available.  With the exception of ""The Gathering,"" each movie gets the wide screen treatment.  I think the picture is better then it was for the series releases.  The sound is mixed in 5.1 surround and sounds wonderful.  Each movie also gets a four-minute intro and a commentary.  Four of the movies include J. Michael Straczynski and various crew while ""Thirdspace"" is just the director and four of the actors.  There's also a brief documentary on the last disc about how real life science effected the creation science of the show.

So, what about the movies themselves?

""The Gathering"" is the original pilot presented here with the new edit and music created for the TNT run.  This is the only version I've ever seen, so I don't know how it compares to the original.  The story opens as Ambassador Kosh of the Vorlons, the final of the five major races, arrives on the station.  He's hardly on board before someone tries to kill him.  Was it Commander Sinclair?  This movie falls into the trap so many pilots do.  How do you explain things in an entertaining way?  I find it's lengthy exposition mostly boring, but any newcomer should start with it.

""In the Beginning"" is on disc two.  This movie takes the history of the Earth-Minbari War we know from the series and fills in the gaps.  Creating a prequel can be tricky, but this one manages to have enough new information to keep your attention.

""Thirdspace"" follows.  When an ancient artifact is brought back to the station, pandemonium ensues.  Is this a giant leap forward in technology or the end of the universe?  A weird movie set in the middle of season 4.

Up next is ""River of Souls.""  When an archeologist employed by Edgars Industries brings his latest find to Babylon 5, he draws the attention of the Soul Hunters to the station.  Martin Sheen guest stars as the soul hunter we see the most.  I wasn't a fan of the Soul Hunters the first time they showed up, but this movie raises some interesting questions about the after life.

Finally comes ""A Call to Arms.""  Designed as a bridge between Babylon 5 and Crusade, this movie finds President Sheridan drawn into a race to stop the Drakh from using the last Shadow planet killer on Earth.  Will the new ships help?  This is a perfect passing of the torch with the premise, two of the new characters, and the new ships being introduced here.  It's too bad the series never made it past 13 episodes.

These movies allowed JMS to explore his universe and fill in some of the gaps.  They also gave him an opportunity to go more into a sci-fi mode and escape the political drama that was the heart of the series.  As such, I find I enjoy these movies less then the series since I'm really not a big sci-fi for sci-fi sake fan.  On the other hand, each movie has some character moments designed to please fans of the show.  As with the series, not all the characters are in each movie.  It would have been nice to see some of them more, but many times that would have slowed the movies down.

With the exception of ""The Gathering,"" this isn't the place to start watching the series.  This is designed to please long time fans, and they will truly enjoy it.",1118707200,9,3627,4.461890243902439

As others have already indicated, The Gathering (the original movie/episode to begin production of the show) is a good place to start, even (or especially) for people who haven't learned the outlines of the story yet. This collection is then interesting to watch: for the improvement in the prosthetics worn by many actors, the development of much more moving stories (here, it is appropriate to mention Londo Mollari's talents as a storyteller/emperor), and the better production quality once things got going (including wonderful music).

OK, the soundtrack to Crusade was nothing less than horrible.  Let's leave it at that.  Really detracted away from the movie experience which was all ready not that spectacular.

Characters are twisted and turned in Arms, etc.  I found the technomages in the entire series a bit cheesey.  They were supposed to use technology to mimic magic, but how does the technomage able to give Sheridan revelations? The thief character was nothing special.  A thief with an attitude and a loner type.  Not very original.

2074278,4,B0002B15UQ,"""Babylon 5"" the movies is a fabulous reminder of what a heck of a show/series Mr. Straczynski created.
Each one either fills in gaps that the shows weren't able to and/or expands further our look at the Babylon 5 universe.
And what a wonderful world it was.
I,like many, have been a Star Trek fan since that shows' inception. My favourite of those series was the original and the one which was running concurrently with ""Babylon 5"",""Deep Space Nine"".When I first viewed B5 I wasn't taken with Capt. Sinclairs' character very much but I realized immediately that this was a very different perception of the future and with so many other characters and intricasies of plot going on this was one little sleeper of a show I just knew was going to go far. And it exceeded my expectations by light years.
What the show lacked in budget it more than made up for in its' quality.
As we all know budgets do not a good show make. I refer you to Star Trek ""Voyager"" and their current canard ""Enterprise"".Quality and originality will win out over budgets everytime.
The first title in this B5 movie pack is ""The Gathering"" which is shown in its' original standard format and is a slightly altered version from the original in that the character development is expanded to a more satisfactory degree which is much closer to what Mr. Straczynski wanted in the first place.
The rest of the movies here are all in their original wonderful widescreen format.
This is indeed a wonderful set and I recommend it highly to all fans of the series. And a BIG thank you to Mr. Straczynski for your guts,vision and persistence in finally getting the series produced and aired. We are forever grateful.",1094342400,6,1676,4.646464646464646
2074279,4,B0002B15UQ,"Of course seeing the pilot is tremendously good background on how the original vision was transformed. And the other movies are pretty good. Particularly strong are ITB and ACTA.

2074282,4,B0002B15UQ,"Some reveiwers have indicated a specific order for watching the B5 movies. While ""The Gathering"" and ""In the Beginning"" are both essential at filling out the background of the show, they you can easily enjoy the 5 seasons of the series without having viewing any of these. On the other hand, it does fill in quite a bit of information on the series but, again, the events depicted in these two first TV movies are actually hinted at throughout the entire run of the series.

That said, the transfers here look and sound about as good as the last three seasons of B5. ""The Gathering"" improves slightly on the previous DVD release that, and the fact that it has a commentary track, should entice viewers that have it already. The same can be said for the static ""In the Beginning"". I personally found that this TV movie was a bit disappointing as it spelled out what had been hinted at and throughout the series. It also features some scenes that showed up later on in the series (particularly those involving the show's original lead Michael O'Hare). Both tend to look a bit grainy at times and the underlit scenes are not well served by the DVDs. It would probably have benefited both these (and the TV movie ""Thirdspace"")with transfers onto a dual later DVD with more space allocated to the visual part of the picture. ""The Gatering"" is the pilot episode of ""B5"" and the only movie presented in full screen. Commander Sinclair (O'Hare)presides over a ceremony greeting the Vorlon ambassador. It will be the first time humanity has had direct contact with the Vorlons. Unfortunately, ambassador Kosh of the Vorlons is attacked by a lone assassin. When Kosh's mind is read it appears that the assassin is....John Sinclair. Security Chief Michael Garabaldi (Jerry Doyle) and Sinclair have limited time to discover who is behind the murder and why they are trying to pin it on the commander. ""In the Beginning"" portrays key incidents from the Earth-Minbari war involving both Sinclair and John Sheridan who will inherit Sinclair's job as commander of B5 during the second season of the series. We see how the war began due to a miscommunication between two species that have more similarities than differences.

""The Gathering"" has its moments but is the weakest of the TV movies. The film has the unenviable task of setting up most of the B5 world and ,as such, the mystery at its core really is designed to provide more details about the background of the world J. Michael Straczynski created for the series. With only three regular cast members carried over to the series (Sinclair and Garibaldi although and telepath Lyta Alexander), ""The Gathering"" mostly sets up the saga that JMS designed for the 5 year series. After the original premiere JMS upgraded the optical effects for the movie in preparation for a reairing of the TV movie and home video release. The pilot here is somewhat different from the original TV movie. JMS went back and made some minor tweaking including more character moments. The transfer looks slightly better than the first dual sided disc that featured this and ""In the Beginning""

""In the Beginning"" spells out many of the adventures and conflicts hinted at throughout the run of the series during the Earth-Minbar war. We finally see how Sheridan helped turn the tide in the war against the Minbari. We also see key scenes that show up later and are important to explaining the fate of Sinclair in the show. The transfer improves slightly on the previous DVD release but is still somewhat grainy and dark at times.

""The River of Souls"" was actually the fourth movie produced and relates to a first season episode involving a race that collect the souls of the living after they die. They hope that they can preserve the essence of the person and allow them to share their knowledge and wisdom. The commentary track here, on ""Thirdspace"" and ""A Call To Arms"" are among the best. Since it involves JMS, director Janet Greek and actress Tracy Scoggins we get a whole bunch of neat tidbits. The image quality is, again, an improvement over the broadcast version but it has some of the same flaws as the other TV movies included. Overall, the visuals look pretty impressive here as with ""Thirdspace"".

The ones that interested me the most was ""Thirdspace"" and ""A Call to Arms"". Both were offshoots from the main story arcs of B5 and are excellent stand alone movies. Although the latter film was prepared as a ""B5"" ""Crusade"" bridge, it operates quite well as an open ended TV movie. Here's hoping that  ""Crusade"" will follow and that JMS will tie up all the lose ends of that series. In ""Thirdspace"" the B5 crew discovera massive spaceship stranded for centuries in hyperspace. They bring the ship out and discover it has unusual properties including the ability to drain any ship coming into contact with it of all its energy. Meanwhile, resident B5 mindreader Lyta Alexander begins having strange visions of B5 destroyed by a massive power and overrun by creatures from another dimension.

In ""Crusade"" a deadly virus is unleased on Earth by minions of The Shadows. Without the cure, the people of Earth only have 5 years to live without a cure. Both look pretty good and are an improvement over the broadcast quality images but, again, a bit more care could have been taken with these occasionally grainy and dark transfers. Any scenes involving the opticals and live action appear especially effected by these transfer issues. On the whole, though, both look pretty good.

Overall, a great set and addition to the B5 universe. Of the five movies included here, only three are essential but all five are pretty solid in terms of the quality of the writing and performances. My only complaint is that I wish that Warner would take a bit more care in transferring these to DVD as they do share many of the same flaws from seasons 3-5 with somewhat murky images and grainy transfers. It's a particularly issue when it involves the CGI effects integrated into live action sequences. A very good set and an essential purchase for B5 fans. As with the previous sets you get a booklet with credits for each movie and the who is on the commentary track. There's also a touching note from JMS about the death of the talented actor Richard Biggs who played Dr. Stephen Franklin on the show. Tragic loss at such a young age. The single extra includes a featurette on how science effected B5 and visa versa. Pretty interesting but you probably won't watch it more than once.",1092700800,25,6493,4.760213143872114
2074283,5,B0002B15UQ,"Actually, I am going to disagree with other reviewers about one thing-new viewers need to watch ""In the Beginning"" BEFORE watching the series.  The title says it all-the movie tells the beginning of the story, and yes it does drop in some things that might remove a little bit of the mystery later, but not very much.  But the movie itself is so great, and sets up the meaning of the Babylon 5 station and the places of characters and races in the B5 universe so well, that it makes a great hook to get new viewers to watch the series.  When this film originally aired on TNT, followed by the re-airing of the first four seasons starting a week after, it convinced ten people that I know to start watching the show.  In the Begining is the hook, and a great one at that.

Follow your viewing of In the Begining with ""the Gathering."" This is really a great film that sets up the station itself and many of its principle characters.  Now, like any pilot, the actors and crew are still getting their sea legs, and it shows, but the pilot clearly shows how Babylon is a lot edgier than other scifi shows.  Plus, there is some great character stuff in it, especially for Peter Jurasik (Londo Mollari), Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar), and Michael O'Hare (Commander Sinclair).

""Thirdspace"" should really be viewed sometime mid-Season 4 of Babylon 5, right in between the time of the Shadow War's ending and the time when the stuff with the unrest on Minbar and the Earth Civil war.  It is a great story, reminiscent of Invasion of the Body Snatchers or Invaders from Mars, with great space sequences and chaotic and dark elements.

""River of Souls"" should be viewed after ""Objects at Rest"", which is the episode of Season 5 right before the series finale.  This is a decent film, but its the weakest of all the B5 movies.  Martin Sheen is in it as a Soul Hunter, and there is some good comedy involving a holo-brothel on the station.  Other than that, the plot is actually kind of slow in places, but its still worth viewing once in a while.

""A Call to Arms"" is really the set up the for ""Crusade"" series.  Its good to have with the others, but really belongs as the openere to the other show.  Its a great film, though.",1092441600,94,2209,4.444168734491315
2074284,5,B0002B15UQ,"These are just my suggestions on where to watch these movies in the B-5 structure:

disc 1 - The Gathering:  this is the pilot and should be watched before you start with season 1.

disc 2 - In The Beginning:  This was aired after season 4, and should not be watched before that season is over, though I'd recommend watching it just before the final episode of season 5 (but after ""River Of Souls"" and before ""Call To Arms"", as explained below).

disc 3 - Thirdspace:  This was a stand-alone story that took place during season 4 - watch it after the 7th or 8th episode (or 2nd disc) of season 4.

disc 4 - River of Souls:  This was a stand-alone story that took place shortly after season 5, (but before the last episode of season 5).  Watch this one just after the 2nd to last episode of season 5 (and preferably before ""In The Beginning"").

disc 5 - Call To Arms:  This again takes place just before the final episode in season 5, so watch this accordingly after ""River of Souls"", but before the series finale, ""Sleeping In Light"". (though I'd watch ""In The Beginning"" before this)

2074285,5,B0002B15UQ,"No self-respecting B5 fan wants to be without this collection, and no serious fan of SF can ignore this series that MIT dubbed The Most Important TV SF Series Since The Original Star Trek.

As B5 continues its path toward the 21st-century version of Star Trek, i.e. becoming more successful long after its first run, this grouping of the five B5-specific films (not including the orphaned The Legend Of the Rangers) is the perfect capper for the release of the five season sets.  It's also a nice bridge to the soon-to-be-released Crusade DVD, the sequel series that died a horrible death due to the meddling of network executives.

A few helpful words to add to those already posted by other reviewers:  In the Beginning should NOT be viewed by anyone who has not yet seen the first four seasons of the B5 series.  For those who aren't aware, B5 is an ongoing story told in chronological order (with the occasional flashback and forward), and In the Beginning contains lots of information from all points of the story.  Since the mysteries of the story, plot surprises, and development of the characters are such a huge part of enjoying this series, avoid ItB until after seeing the fourth season.  It's kind of a recap, with many delicious twists that are best enjoyed by those who have followed the story to that point.

The Gathering, of course, is the pilot film.  It gives the real beginnings of the five-year story arc, laying groundwork and introducing new fans to one of the charming aspects of being a Babophile:  Watching J. Michael Straczynski and his crew learn how to make A Television Series.  The early work is a bit raw (more than a bit in some places), and the consequent rough edges are being smoothed until late in the first season.

Although ItB type spoilers are not so numerous in the other three films, it's best to know that Thirdspace takes place midway thru Season Four, River Of Souls takes place six months after the end of Season Five, and A Call to Arms takes place toward the end of Season Five (prior to Sleeping in Light, the series finale).

Thirdspace is a story of a Big Bad Alien Race threatening to take over our universe, by way of a door from an alternate dimension.  Sure, that sounds trite, but until you've seen it done the B5 way you haven't seen it.

River Of Souls deals with Soul Hunters, the ghouls of the B5 universe who collect souls of poets, artists, blessed lunatics, those whom they deem worthy of saving in their little globe-shaped prisons.  They talk to their collections and learn from them.  Nobody likes these guys.....and they're coming back to B5, having visited briefly in Season One.  Very emotional, starring Martin Sheen as a Soul Hunter.

A Call to Arms takes place after all the several Big Bad Alien Races have been chased out of our universe.....but no, we forgot somebody, and they're aiming straight for Earth.  A remarkable film that leads directly into Crusade.",1091059200,105,2936,4.697265625

Two of the set are standouts: 'In the Beginning' and the Babylon 5 pilot, 'The Gathering'.  Both offer background into the B5 universe and some insight into the characters...and interestingly, the behavior of the secondary characters is very different than their behavior in the series at the time TNT showed these movies.  Both of these films are worth careful, repeat viewings to catch the foreshadowing of future events....and it's satisfying to watch a teleplay that is this careful about its plot development.

'Thirdspace', 'River of Souls', and 'A Call To Arms' give some zing to some tertiary characters, and are also enjoyable, though the occasional viewer may be a bit confused as to the motivation and actions of the characters.

2074287,5,B0002B15UQ,"This set will be awesome

For those of you new to all things Babylon 5, here is my run down of this set:

1. THE GATHERING - As the series pilot it is a decent effort. It's best to see this one before watching Season One but it's fine if you catch it anytime. In fact this one is worth viewing again after watching seasons 1-3 to catch A LOT of foreshadowing. You can't realize the of traps JMS has set just in this pilot. I give this one 3.5/5.

2. IN THE BEGINNING - Holy crap! 5/5. By far the best effort of JMS and his crew, second only to Severed Dreams (episode in Season 3). Anyone can thoroughly enjoy this this one without ever seeing one episode of Babylon 5 (like my wife) there are some big spoilers. So do yourself a HUGE favor. Do not watch this movie until after you have completed Seasons 1 through 3. Also, this one features Chris Franke's best score. This one alone is nearly worth the purchase price.

3. THIRDSPACE - I like this one more than many others might. It introduces a H.P. Lovecraft type of element to the Babylon 5 universe. Personally I really like this new wrinkle and wish that it received further exploration. Catch this one after about the 7 episode in Season 4. This one features a crazy (perhaps even ridiculous) battle scene and a girl fight at the end that is well worth seeing. 4/5.

4. RIVER OF SOULS - A story about the Soul Hunters (introduced early in Season One). Martin Sheen is in it (a bit of a miscast for some people). Watch this before the last episode of Season 5 (Sleeping In Light). I like Franke's score alot. This one focuses more on some of the peripheral characters like Lochley and Zach which makes for a nice change IMHO. Tracy Scoggins in lingerie = yummy! Also, another series regular has a terrific performance at the climax that should not be missed. 3.5/5.

5. CALL TO ARMS - This is meant to serve as the transition to JMS's next Babylon 5 series: CRUSADE. IMHO, Chen's score is totaly out of place and is a distraction. The effects are not as good as the other films as well. On other hand, there are some new and interesting characters (many which become part of the Crusade series) introduced that still make this one worth watching. Peter Woodward and Tony Todd really shine in this one. 3/5",1090368000,519,2262,4.3610451306413305
