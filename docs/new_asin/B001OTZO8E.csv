 Jan is a mid-20's Norwegian man who has fallen in love with a Pakistani-Norwegian, woman (Jasmin) who loves him too, but her family has arranged a marriage with the son of a man who lent them money to come to Norway. Jan gives her a ring in the film's opening scenes hoping she will marry him, instead.
  The marriage becomes imminent when the groom gets his visa to come to Norway.  Jasmin tells Jan she can't run away with him because that would shame her family. She will only marry someone of her family's choosing so they must never see each other again.
 But Jan loves Jasmin so much he can't be without her. Instead, he is determined to become the man her family could choose.  He starts working for Jasmin's father Allahditta, a cranky store owner who is predjudiced against Norwegians. Jasmin's father is unaware that Jan even knows Jasmin.
 Jan works very hard and makes himself indispensable to the store and even helps with a sensitive family problem when the youngest son balks at getting circumcised as a good Muslim.  Jan goes with the son to the clinic and they are both circumcised. Jan has done this and become a converted Muslim in order that Jasmin's family will accept his asking to marry Jasmin. Jan also helps Jasmin's sister's husband with his marital problems and tries to help him get a taxi license.
  Jan sends his Swedish parents to Jasmin's father and mother to ask for Jasmin in marriage as Allahditta has told him is the Pakistani-Muslim tradition. (They tell Jasmin's father that they too are immigrants to Norway.) Since Jasmin's father was not aware that Jan had any interest in Jasmin before this, this results in some comic mayhem to Jan's rock band mates at Jan's apartment when Jasmin's father and friends come armed with wooden paddles.
  The wedding has been planned and the groom and family matriach arrive from Pakistan expecting a traditional arranged wedding.
  Very like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" but from the man's point of view.",1257552000,,1992,4.736231884057971
