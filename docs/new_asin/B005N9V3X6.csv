8480242,5,B005N9V3X6,"I love this! You're not intended to do everything perfectly the first time, so don't expect it. You're suggested to leave the video playing even if you mess up and try to learn what you can. The second, third, fourth time through the DVD, you'll notice you're getting a LOT better. Very helpful!",1485561600,,295,4.584905660377358

8480246,1,B005N9V3X6,"The exercises are fine, the method is fine, but it's difficult to follow because it only shows one line of tab at a time.  The instructor in this video will put together several lines of tab to play together but only one line appears at a time therefore, as you near the end of one line, you have to wait for the next line of tab to just pop-up on the screen and you're scrambling trying to get to the notes in time.  It's ridiculous to try to follow.  Also, there are no chapter marks at the beginning of each exercise.  This sucks because when you mess up you have to actually rewind to get back to the beginning of the exercise instead of just hitting previous chapter.  Piece of crap.",1385510400,3,688,4.221374045801527
