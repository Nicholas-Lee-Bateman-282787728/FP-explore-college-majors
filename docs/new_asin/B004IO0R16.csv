Animals while he's watching cartoons",1404604800,,106,3.8636363636363638
4387309,5,B004IO0R16,The voices on the video have happy tones.  The music is upbeat. Nothing scary for kids. It's a great learning tool!,1394409600,,115,4.476190476190476
4387310,5,B004IO0R16,My three year old son loves these videos!  We got this DVD as a gift for Christmas just before he was 2.  He didn't really care for it until just a few months ago.  Now every day after school he has to watch the Cat in the Hat!  I love that they are short (about 12 min each story) so he can watch 2 in less than 30 min while I start dinner.,1346457600,,341,3.6301369863013697
4387311,5,B004IO0R16,"I bought three of these DVD's for my son. He loves the cat in the hat show on PBS, but it only comes on once a day around his bathtime so he would miss it often. I use these in the portable DVD player or laptop and I also burned a copy to my itunes and put it on my iphone. (literally kept him occupied for 45 mins while we waited at the DMV) Shipping was fast and they were in unopened original casing. (not some bootleg ripoff copy) Good price too, these sell for almost 20$ each at retail stores.",1314662400,,499,3.9504950495049505
4387312,5,B004IO0R16,"Since ""The Cat in the Hat"" first appeared on PBS, my boys have been hooked.  It is such a simple show but has fun characters, colors, and rhyming. This DVD is just about an hour long and contains five episodes.  I love that know we can watch ""The Cat in the Hat"" anytime or bring the DVD in the car with us, as before we had to wait for it to be on PBS.  Since it is a PBS show, it is very appropriate for young kids and my 2 and 4 year old love the different episodes.  It is a show about two kids, one boy and one girl, who are best friends and go on crazy adventures with the Cat in the Hat to discover new things and answer simple questions.

Episodes:

  * A Sticky Situation
  * Trees Company
  * Rain Game
  * You Should Be Dancing
  * A Tale About Tails

Mom and More Disclosure: I was sent this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.",1302134400,6,852,3.888888888888889
4387313,5,B004IO0R16,Great!,1447718400,,6,6.0
4387314,5,B004IO0R16,"PBS does it again! The Cat in the Hat Knows A Lot About That is such a fun and educational show for little kids and is the sort of entertainment that I am comfortable with. My daughter is 3 and loves it. When we leave to go somewhere, I often get her excited about it by singing, ""Here we go go go... on an adventure!"" And every episode really is an adventure but it relies on lessons and learning instead of loud sounds and crazy action to keep attention. It is the perfect combination of fact and imagination. I also cannot imagine the cat working so well with a voice other than Martin Short. He fits the role perfectly. This version of the cat looks just like the one in the books, but he is a welcome guest, not a creepy intruder. He and the fish are also friends. Nick and Sally are playmates instead of siblings. I find the DVD version much more likable.

Running time is approximately 60 minutes plus bonus content. There is also a Spanish language option, but I have not tried it out.

Episodes include:
A Sticky Situation
Trees Company
Rain Game
You Should Be Dancing
A Tale About Tails",1447372800,2,1096,4.341463414634147

4387317,5,B004IO0R16,I bought this for my god daughters. This PBS show is awesome so I thought the DVD would be a great gift. It was a great price!!,1446595200,,127,3.740740740740741

4387319,5,B004IO0R16,"I purchased this when it went on sale. Excellent price for about an hr or more of silly ""Cat in the Hat"" fun.

This was a gift for my youngest. We get a kick out of ""Cat in the Hat"". We have many books, that sometimes end in a tongue twister. Which makes them all the more fun.

My 5 year old wants to watch it almost every day after School.",1446422400,,341,3.788732394366197
4387320,5,B004IO0R16,"This was a TERRIFIC deal! I first bought it thinking it was a book. It turned out to be a DVD which was even better!!  My son is 4 and he absolutely loved the collection of Cat in the Hat stories! It was just long enough to keep him interested, without being too much. Great stories, I highly recommend this video to all parents and grandparents!!",1446336000,,347,4.257575757575758
4387321,5,B004IO0R16,"My kids love Cat in the Hat and this DVD has 5 episodes for them to sit and enjoy.  I got this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas and we ended up opening it up right away!  Each episode is about 12 minutes, although there are commercials in between which is a bit irritating with a DVD.  I'd expect them on the TV or even a free streaming app, but not on a DVD I purchased.  Nonetheless, my children still love it and love the rhyming and different stories they tell.  The DVD is just about an hour in total length and perfect for my toddlers, ages 2 and 4, since they don't have a very long attention span. The five episodes are A Sticky Situation, Trees Company, Rain Game, You Should Be Dancing, and A Tale About Tails.  This is a great DVD for kids, especially if your children already love the Cat in the Hat, I've yet to meet a child that isn't!

Purchase was made with my own money, a review was not required.",1446336000,,917,4.146892655367232

4387330,3,B004IO0R16,"This is one of my son's favorite shows, but I was disappointed with commercials inbetween episodes on a DVD. We try to avoid watching channels with lots of marketing to a small child, so we watch PBS. I was shocked to see so many commercials on a DVD for a PBS kids show.",1445299200,,271,4.132075471698113
