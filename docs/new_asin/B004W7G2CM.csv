8444691,5,B004W7G2CM,"There's nothing else like this on DVD, no Vanderbilt or any other famous stately mansion on DVD, decorated to the nines for Christmas. You'll enter historic Pittock Mansion elaborately decorated. See the marble staircase, entrance hall, The Music Room, the Library, their private dining room, descend to the kitchen to see the sweet treats laid out (my favorite), then up to the children's nursery and some private bedrooms, gorgeous ornament-laden trees and fireplaces throughout.  Stunning evening blue windows at dusk.  You get nearly one full hour of a private tour, no people, no talking, no roped off areas - you get the mansion all to yourself with your choice of piped-in music.  Six musical choices from opulent Tchaikovsky Christmas; Piano; Harp (there's even one in the Music Room); Choral; Brass; and my favorite... String Quartet & Guitar which is very elegant and fits the cinematography perfectly.  If you can't get to Portland, OR, to see the mansion in person, and they decorate it differently every year by professional designers, this is a lovely next-best thing. Pittock Mansion is credited at end of footage.  I got this for a little less from a vendor not on Amazon, but it's worth it. Try to find another Christmas mansion DVD, and you will not be able to get one.  This is one of a kind.",1513728000,,1311,4.882882882882883
