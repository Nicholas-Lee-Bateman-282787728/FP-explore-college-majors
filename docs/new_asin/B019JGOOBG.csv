8745400,5,B019JGOOBG,"This is a contemporary commentary on Tchaikovsky's private life with the current hate status of Russian homophobia contrasted with the historical and seemingly embedded homophobia of Soviet life and culture.  It makes Tchaikovsky's plight all to real and truly unfortunate and worst of all, still going full force.  Will this ignorant persecution never end?  How he composed such glorious  music under such oppressive societal bigotry stands as a moving testament to the greatness of one of my absolutely favorite composers.  The BBC has also made a documentary regarding this man and his music:  _Tchaikovsky-the tragic life of a musical genius.",1461369600,2,646,5.41
8745401,2,B019JGOOBG,"Flamboyant, bizarre, campy, strange, excessive, self-indulgent, this movie, very loosely about Tchaikovsky, resembles a Cockette performance from forty years ago, though clearly it is striving to be ultra-hip and post-modern.  I recall Capote's wisecrack about one of them:  Bad art is not good enough.  The interviews are relatively sober, though either highly conjectural, erroneous as to the facts, or commonplace.  There really is nothing to be learned here.  The snippets from a ballet on Tchaikovsky shown in the film are as extravagantly bad as the film itself.  A performance of the fine Tchaikovsky song, usually translated as None But the Lonely Heart, is a travesty, crooned, off pitch, like a bad pop song by a half dressed young man with mascara running from his eyes.  Just awful.  No one should see this movie who really cares about Tchaikovsky.  His life is turned into the doings of a hysteric, for the most part, and his music reduced to that sort of biography.  Occasional glimpses of a better film appear from time to time, mostly in the commentary, but the movie is far more interested in itself than it is concerned about Tchaikovsky and his music.  What one sees in it is a post-modern sense that all you need to do to make art is throw a bunch of images together and let them run amuck, the more eye candy you can add the better.  It is odd how often Tchaikovsky and his work have been abused in this way.  It needs to stop.",1458777600,7,1448,4.698412698412699
