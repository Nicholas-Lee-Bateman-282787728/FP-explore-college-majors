6464450,1,B00L47E39W,"The story was ok, some of the acting was great, but the lead acting seemed flat. It was nice to have a film that wasn't filled with violence and gore but I'm glad it only cost 3.99 to watch it instead of full price for three at a theater. Wade Williams is just not a good actor.",1412121600,2,278,3.8947368421052633
6464451,5,B00L47E39W,"My wife and I were looking for something to watch on a Saturday evening and I decided to give this a try. Were we ever glad we did. This is an excellent movie that covers a policeman's life, a school teacher, coach, and Christian. It is the story of a man struggling with his faith while struggling to coach a high school baseball team. Very good story, and acting. You have to watch it all the way to the end that is through the credits, to see the biggest surprise of them all.",1410566400,16,479,4.161290322580645

6464505,5,B00L47E39W,"What a surprise to find out The Investigator was written by Ray Romano's brother and based on his life! I thought his script for this story was cleverly put together. Although I'm a sports fan, I think the baseball tangent perhaps was emphasized a bit more than needed and there should have been more footage of the investigation. That concept is not new; both Lee Strobel and Josh McDowell eloquently documented their investigations on the topic of Jesus Christ. However seeing a class full of screw offs transform into keenly focused and highly motivated historical detectives was precious. The acting was solid. The sports action was fairly realistic (something you don't see much). And the cinematography didn't scream ""low budget production"". I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I highly recommend it.",1487808000,,805,5.152671755725191

You will be surprised to discover the main character's connection to a person nearly all of us have seen at some point in the television media.

6464530,5,B00L47E39W,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I like that it was based on a true story and that is shows how we may have struggles that may test our faith but in the end actually make our faith even stronger.

6464554,5,B00L47E39W,"I've watched this video twice and I think I liked it even more the 2nd time. Why? The brutal honesty of dealing with unwanted and uncomfortable circumstances. Even when our faith is shaken God never leaves us or forsakes us. He does challenge us and puts us in situations that give us the opportunity to turn back to Him. This is not your typical sports movie even though there are sports involved. It's a story of new beginnings. Sometimes we just need to take one step at a time especially when we don't want to. God is faithful, the question is, are we?",1462924800,,556,4.407766990291262

Based on true events the people in the movie actually looked quite similar to the people they portrayed.  I wish they would have showed more of the man's wife but it was actually more about the man who lost a baby, his job, and went from sargeant of a police force to teaching criminal justice and coaching a softball team at a high school.

This movie was in my watch list and I decided to give it a try. So glad I did!!  Was it a high budget Hollywood blockbuster? No. But the story was incredible. Decent acting. A man's life is turned upside down by 2 devastating events. He is filled with anger esp at God. But God has His own plans for this man. That is the beautiful story of this film. And you will be totally Surprised at who this story is about. Although the names are different the brothers are real and it is revealed in the credits. Loved it",1441584000,4,648,4.225806451612903

It was refreshing to see a Christian message in a movie, and I really liked how the coach used the investigation technique to not only help the students with faith, but to regain his own after some tough life circumstances gave him every reason in the world to lose that faith.

I hope to share my copy with friends. What a surprise at the end! They said it was based on a true story, but I had no idea I would know who it was about.

6464673,5,B00L47E39W,"""The Investigator"", inspired by true events, written by Richard Romano, brother of the renowned & beloved comedian & actor, Ray Romano, is an excellent film you don't have to hesitate viewing with the entire family, regardless of age. Rich, a born again believer in Christ Jesus, is a former NYPD sergeant who after retirement became a criminal justice teacher & baseball coach at a Long Island high school. The film follows the life of the lead character, Detective James Buanacore (in actuality the screen depiction of Rich Romano), very believably portrayed by actor Wade Williams, who is forced into early retirement after an undercover drug bust involving another police officer escalates into a scuffle between police & suspected street dealers, resulting in fatal consequences for one of the suspects. Added to this another tragedy, the miscarriage of the baby Mrs. Buanacore was expected to soon give birth to, sends the ex-detective from nominal Catholic to angry agnostic. I think where the film is at its best is when the agnostic Buanacore, ironically on the faculty of a private Christian school, is challenged by a student to involve the class in an investigation (hence the title's double meaning) of the historical existence of Jesus, & the Biblical claims by & about Him using extra-Biblical evidence, as a class project in his criminal justice course. Rich Romano told me that Josh McDowell, author of the highly acclaimed ""Evidence That Demands a Verdict"" (& subsequently, ""New Evidence That Demands a Verdict: Evidence I & II""), who I had the privilege of interviewing on my radio program years ago, was & is an inspiration to him. Keep your eyes open for my updates on the radio interview that Rich Romano has agreed to participate in when my program, ""Iron Sharpens Iron"", returns to the airwaves.",1426118400,3,1819,5.046511627906977
6464674,5,B00L47E39W,"This story hit a nerve.  We all go through periods in our Christian walk when we really don't know if we believe anymore.  That feeling is compounded when circumstances push our thinking.  Coach didn't want to face his questions until he was forced to not only acknowledge his fear and rage, but question the legitimacy of it all.  He determined to find the answers even when they did not match what he had conceived in his mind as the answer.  The acting was real, the emotion was tangible.  I enjoyed this movie because it made me look a little deeper inside my own Christian walk.  The fact that it is based on a true story makes it have a bigger impact.",1425945600,7,657,4.380165289256198

6464677,1,B00L47E39W,"We decided to watch this movie because we are Christians and like to watch inspiring, uplifting Christian films.  This movie got great user reviews, but I have to disagree.  It only took us 15 minutes before we had to turn it off.  Wade Wilson's acting was atrocious, as were the other actors. Too over-dramatic and unrealistic.  The night before we watched 23 Blast which was much better.  Save your money--there are plenty of great Christian options out there with better acting.",1425081600,4,481,4.888888888888889

The faith in Jesus question  was real and relatable, remembering too, this is based on a true story. It was handled with facts, without the preachy tone I don't mind but others do. Amazing turn around that although may have been seen in other movies, this one is real life, true events. If you do not read any additional information on the movie, (my husband & I didn't) a nice, ""Wow, you are kidding me!)moment happens at the end when showing pictures of the real people their update next to the actor that portrayed them.",1511568000,,682,4.636363636363637
