and need to entertain the little guy. Very educational for the child.",1313971200,,134,4.4
4503767,5,B004YVO5ZM,"very good show for young children. always relays a positive message and enccourages exercise. I watched it closely in the beginning to make sure there was no funny business going on, but now it's the show she loves that I tolerate best. lots of bright colors, good musical guests. it's a wholesome show that doesn't feel dated. I highly reccommend it.",1313280000,,351,4.770491803278689

4503769,4,B004YVO5ZM,"Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict-- For parents of children that need to mainline Yo Gabba Gabba!, Nickelodeon has made life a bit easier with this three-disc collection of the monster hit kids show. Party in a Box delivers 288 minutes worth of DJ Lance Rock, Muno, Plex, Toodee and Brobee and if you don't have the ""Friends"" song memorized by now, just wait: this release will ensure that your nights are besieged by the tune running through your head forevermore.

Here's what's in the box:

The Dancey Dance Bunch!
* ""Friends""
* ""Eat""
* ""Dance""
* ""Happy""

Birthday Boogie!
* ""Birthday""
* ""Dress-Up""
* ""Talent""
* ""Ride""

Clubhouse
* ""Clubhouse""
* ""Adventure""
* ""Summer""
* ""Animals""

But really, it doesn't matter; if you're at all familiar with the workings of Yo Gabba Gabba!--my favorite toddler-centric show by the way--the themes are consistent. DJ Lance wants to get your rugrats up and dancing, with any lessons being taught (e.g., eating well, not biting your friends, using your imagination) woven into catchy song and dance routines. It's a great set-up and a presentation that my one-year-old absolutely adores.

Standard-issue Nick release: full frame, 2.0 stereo, no extras.

However, why in the name of DJ Lance Rock would you make the box set like this? Lord have mercy, just release the seasons on DVD! It's ricockulous that they boxed them like this and put like 5 episodes on each DVD. Bizarre move on their part and even more disappointing when I was forced to buy it because Netflix removed the show from streaming. It's the only way my kid can get his fix now.

We prefer the Music Makes Me Dance video, but this one is great too.

This is the first show my son would watch with complete concentration.  Before this we might occasionally turn on PBS kids and he'd watch a few seconds and turn away.  He is GLUED to this show.  He asks to watch it.  I think it's a fun show that toddlers are very attracted too because of all the music, dancing, and bright colors.  We adults love it, too.",1381881600,,713,4.176470588235294

4503906,3,B004YVO5ZM,"If you see one episode you've got the gist as the format for this show remains constant throughout- which isn't a bad thing. It's fair to claim this show is different than other children's shows, it has a much different look and feel than anything out there, but I can't help but think this a modern version of the early days of Sesame Street, when the show was at it's peak. It's easy to forget Sesame Street was once hip and refreshing compared with other shows as it has grown stale and repetitive over time. Perhaps the greatest sin of Sesame was the over-saturation that lives on today (seriously, can I buy a sippee cup WITHOUT the sesame street, Dora, or Disney characters?).

So 'Yo' is different but I wouldn't claim it's landmark/revolutionary. In fact, I think it's a show that will show it's age quickly as all the 'current' acts are rooted in what is hip today rather than what might be timeless. Sometimes I feel the show tries to be hip just for the sake of being hip, and that is somewhat repellent.

Mind you, I actually like all the bands and hosts. I grew up on quirky music when quirky music wasn't considered cool. I like the way the kids in the show look like IKEA models. I like the off-beat nature of the show but this is the problem: I feel more like Yo is geared toward me rather than my child. They spotlight  the quirky asides (bands, kids, cartoons) much more than the four main characters, which is what I always hated about Sesame Street. They'd cut to a kid or contemporary figure I'd never heard about and I'd be like, 'Alright, this is slow and lame. Where are the puppets?' And that sentiment runs through my brain every episode here, as well. My child says 'skip through this' whenever the segment leaves the four major characters and I sympathize but then a hipster band I like plays tunes that seem meant for me. See the problem? Who is this show for?

So that's my discord with the show.",1356048000,,1926,4.432203389830509
4503907,5,B004YVO5ZM,"I ordered this for my grandson and he loves it!

Turns out, the near future was about 5 minutes. This show really calmed my baby down when he was in a fussy mood & I have seen other babies calmed while watching Yo Gabba Gabba!. The DVDs seem to be of MUCH better quality than just watching it on cable/satellite also, much clearer in video as well as audio.

I know some parents who don't like this show, but I love it for the themes that are relevant to my kids at their ages (3-7).  I think it's a good message that they don't *have* to share, but that selfishness has consequences, too.  for example)

I love that the kids see other kids exhibiting talents (and many of them are things my children could try to do).  And that the kids on the show dancing, are dancing with the exuberance of children who are moving with joy, not direction.  I love how the music is mixed in.  I love the energy.  I love how my kids interact with it; how they dance around, sing, and then discuss some of the things (like how to deal with bullying).

It doesn't hurt that orange is my favorite color, either.  I'm making my kid a DJ Lance Rock hat.  However, I am NOT sewing him an orange jumpsuit!",1317081600,5,1014,4.2513089005235605
