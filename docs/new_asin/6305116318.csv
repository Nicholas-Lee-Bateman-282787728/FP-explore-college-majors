988004,5,6305116318,"This is a film I saw as a kid on a summer afternoon in one of those grand old downtown movie palaces and it's still my all-time favorite fantasy film. Steve Reeves is magnificent as the chiseled, moody Greek hero; his performace is timeless. My favorite scene has Hercules supplicating the gods to permit him to experience the joys and sorrows of human life. The heavens answer the hero's plea with a deluge of rain, freeing the hero of godhood. The script adapts episodes from the Labors of Hercules and the Quest for the Golden Fleece; sets and costumes suggest the rugged age of myth; supporting roles are played by attractive and competent performers. The dragon guarding the Golden Fleece is nothing to write home about, but who cares? ... we came to see Steeve! A classic not to be missed!",1029715200,,795,4.6453900709219855
988005,4,6305116318,"I challenge Leonard Maltin's use of the term ""musclebound"" to describe Steve Reeves. That word means ""stiff"" or ""rigid"" due to some muscle-related problem. Reeves is most definitely NOT ""musclebound"". Maltin knows nothing about muscles. Reeves is built (!), aesthetic, athletic. This movie is meant to be fun, like a ""comic"" book, & Reeves is a terrific hero, with terrific muscles. He inspired many guys to get buff, way before ""Ahnold"" came along. Cool? Yes!",1008892800,6,460,5.1466666666666665
988006,3,6305116318,"This is a review of the DVD by Gemstone Entertainment -  ISBN 0-7694-1100-2,  UPC 84296-40174.  Judging by the price, the  one listed here on Amazon.com is likely to be similar.
I would rate the movie itself as one of my all time favorite fantasy adventures, although many would view it as ""campy"" I view Steve Reeves as the best Hercules ever.
I was rather disappointed that the DVD was a formatted-for-TV version of the movie, apparently made from a rather faded print of the film.  The sound was generally out of sink with the actors lips.  (Stopping and restarting my SONY player did not fix the problem.)
I'm glad I have some version of this movie in my library.  Hopefully a restored, letterboxed version will be done someday.",992044800,37,732,4.671875
988007,5,6305116318,"I can relate to the individual who said that Steve Reeves was his boyhood idol. He was mine as well. I can remember as a 8 year old watching Steve Reeves battle Barbarians in ""Goliath and the Barbarians"", my first Reeves movie. I sat mesmerized by Reeves. Many years later, I started weight training and eventually got into powerlifting competition  winning the YMCA Nationals and AAU North American Championships and then went on to bodybuilding promotions like the AAU Atlantic States (a title I created), the first IFBB Teenage Mr America and the WABBA/NABBA USA vs Europe Challenge match, IFBB Jr. Mr. America and IFBB Mr. North America. Reeves planted the seed in me at age 8, he was the Arnold of his time. Food for thought: If it wasn't for Reeves, what would Arnold be doing these days? Reeves opened the door for many bodybulders who followed. On to the movie. Obviously this movie would not win any academy awards, but it helped win for Reeves the #1 box office champion of his time. It starts off with a runaway chariot and suddenly we hear the sounds and see a tree being uprooted. It's our Hercules saving the lady in distress and his future bride. Hercules is a fun movie. It is badly dubbed. But so what. Reeves looks good. The Amazon girls look really great. There aren't any great specia effects, but this was the fifties and the movie was made over 43 years ago. The plot is simple; kill the Lion, kill the Cretan Bull, renounce your immortality, save the people and help Jason and Argonauts and instill in Ulysses that his destiny will be determined by a bow and arrow! Oh, and marry the beautiful Jole and lets not forget how he pulls the Temple down ala SAMSON but lives. Seriously, Hercules is still a fun movie and deservedly a classic. The entire bodybuilding world owes a great debt to Reeves, the Italian producer and Joe Levine. One only has to watch the Hercules, Maciste, Goliath movies that followed this in the 60's or the Lou Ferrigno version of Hercules in 1980 to appreciate this one. Reeves was, is the one and only Hercules. This was the first and best Hercules movie.",983232000,12,2104,4.595744680851064
988008,2,6305116318,"I will make frequent reference to my copy, a discounted version on the  notoriously low-quality ""Goodtimes Home Video"", especially the  trademark misrepresentation of the sleeve. SLEEVE:  ""The Best Heroic  Action Movie Ever Made"" TRUTH:  Probably one of the most ambitious  plots.  By this print in 1990, there may well have been better action  movies. SLEEVE:  SEE Hercules single-handedly wrestle a man-eating lion!  TRUTH:  LAUGH at Hercules as he single-handedly wrestles down a shag  carpet. SLEEVE:  SEE Hercules beat the infamous Cretan Bull down with his  fists! TRUTH:  SEE footage of a bull!  SEE Hercules struggle for ten  minutes with a taxidermist's rendition of a different bull. Strangely  enough, these encounters in the first half mean nothing to the  plot...because they are about Hercules.  The movie, it turns out, is not  about Hercules, as he just ends up being an Argonaut stooge. While better  dubbed than--say--a Bruce Lee movie, it tries to be a similar style of  action (fighting) movie, and these scenes fail miserably by today's  standards.  It's a given that no child will ever choose this film over the  cartoon.  However, it was probably doomed to the classic nostalgia crowd  anyway.  It's a shame Disney got hold of him before there could be a  Godzilla-ish remake.  All the classics seem to go one way or the other.",961027200,4,1350,5.055045871559633

988069,4,6305116318,"As a very young boy watching this version of ""Hercules"" at the Saturday kiddie matinee, I was awed by the muscles and strength of Steve Reeves. I was totally entertained by the fights with the lion, the Cretan bull (a buffalo?), the monster, and the guards. It didn't matter that some of the effects and props were a tad cheesy and cheaply made, or that it seemed that the sounds (including those of the water, the horses' hooves, the singing boatmen, and others) were dubbed. As for this dvd, I would like to join with others in insisting that a better version should be made. There were parts of the film that were very grainy, scratched, or unfocused. 'Nuf said about that. Watching this many years later, ""Hercules"" was still entertaining, and I now could enjoy the beauty of Sylva Koscina and Luciana Paluzzi (Paoluzzi in the credits). Who would have guessed that Ms. Paluzzi would go from acting as a mild servant girl to becoming one of the best evil James Bond girls?",1497657600,,975,4.609195402298851

988071,5,6305116318,"As far as sword and sandals movies go, this is the Gone With the Wind of them all starring the Lawrence Olivier of this genre, Steve Reeves. Also you get Gianna Maria Canale, perhaps the Meryl Streep of these Italian epics. Acting? The acting is far superior to most of these flicks. The special effects are... well the bull is kind of fake looking. The lion I am glad to say got another roll later in life, fighting Scott of the Sahara in a Month Python sketch. That means the lion was laughable, but that means nothing. This one has a coherent plot, decent acting and great fights. When you say this is the standard by which all sword and sandal movies should be judged, you are wrong. This movie sets the bar way too high. When it comes to sword and sandal movies, there are bad ones, okay ones, good ones and Hercules with Steve Reeves. Watch and enjoy it for what it is. Fun fun fun.",1495756800,,888,4.291666666666667

988234,2,6305116318,"What 13-year-old of my generation did not want to grow up to be Steve Reeves?  His physique was unparalleled in the Saturday matinees of the time.  The stories were mostly scrambled combinations of bits and pieces of mythology, and production values were cheesy (with extremely tiresome dancing girls), and why would I now (as an adult watch them again)?  I think it is a way of recapturing my boyhood, when I could believe in heroes.  Which other Steves Reeves movies would I watch again?  Often it is the case that the movie as a whole might not be satisfying, but that certain scenes are amazing.  The Thief of Bagdad (Steve Reeves version) has two stunning scenes--his churning a well, and his crossing a precarious an approach to a castle, in which he is clad diaphanously.  That's really heady stuff at age 13.

988376,3,6305116318,"This was the first attempt since HELEN OF TROY to make a movie in the Mycenaean Era and it was set earlier portraying both the adventures of the demi-god Hercules and Jason's voyage of the Argo. Steve Reeves, a World War II veteran, who had won the Mr. America title as a young man, then the Mr. Universe title, and done some acting, was chosen to play the lead role chiefly because of his unrivaled physique and handsome features. Although he was about thirty-six at the time, he understood as few men have, how to maintain a fantastic musculature without steroids. His natural proportions and maturity also helped him in the role as did real strength and agility. Reeves was a great runner, and despite his size, once did a 4minute 25 second mile. All these things helped make a low budget movie memorable. Some of the special effects such as the dragon guarding the Golden Fleece could have been helped by Ray Harryhausen. Reeves was genuinely concerned with the welfare of the men his role required him to knock around. He was disgusted that his voice was dubbed. His salary reputedly was $8,000.00, which was little for the role that started an amusing run of ""sword and sandal"" epics none of whose leading men equaled Reeves.",1384214400,2,1231,4.67741935483871

988543,4,6305116318,"""Hercules"" (""La Fatiche di Ercole""), the French/Italian 'epic' that launched champion American bodybuilder Steve Reeves into meteoric, if brief, film stardom, is unabashedly low-budget, with laughable special effects, but it still holds up as entertainment surprisingly well, after 50 years, and, was the foundation of the 'sword and sandal' genre of films, that continues to this day.

While this edition of the film has problems (when will a digitally remastered version of ""Hercules"" be offered, in the widescreen format it was filmed in?), the print is the best I've seen. The story, loosely based upon ""Jason and the Golden Fleece"", offers a dubbed Reeves as demigod Hercules, who renounces his status as a deity (while keeping most of his superhuman strength) for the chance to help mankind, and win the love of young princess Iole (lovely Sylva Koscina). When he befriends Jason (Fabrizio Mioni), foretold to overthrow Iole's father (Ivo Garrani), the sly old ruler says he'll abdicate, IF the famous fleece can be recovered. With a crew of legendary heroes (including Gabriele Antonini as the young Ulysses), Jason and Hercules embark on their epic quest, aboard the 'Argos'.

Packed with battles with creaky mechanical 'monsters' and less-than-ferocious beasts (including a rather docile lion), Reeves' handsome face and incredible physique are displayed to great advantage; his acting skills, while not great, are certainly no worse than his successor in the genre, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Forget, too, the 'urban legend' that his voice was dubbed because it was tinny and high-pitched; it was actually quite close to the dubbed one (remember, Cecil B. DeMille nearly cast him as Samson, so it couldn't be THAT bad!)

If you're looking for superior fantasy, Don Chaffey and Ray Harryhausen's superb 1963 ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (featuring Nigel Green as an aging, less heroic Hercules) is certainly the film to choose; but I recommend ""Hercules"" if you want to just have fun, and enjoy the 'ride'. As a boy, I loved this film, and I still get a kick out of it, today.

First of all, the actors are perfect for the film, in my opinion. Steve Reeves, who was named Mr. Universe right before filming Hercules, really is the perfect Hercules figure and the casting director for the film deserves a lot of credit.  The fact that Steve performed his own stunts while riding a horse (in what is possibly the best horse scene in a film ever!) helps to expand the ""cult"" of Reeves fans, of which now I'm, a little begrudgingly, a card-carrying member of.  The incredibly handsome Steve can't be denied!

But of course, even the parts where Steve's not baring his brawn are fun.  The director, Pietro Francisci (who, by some sort of horrible mix-up directed the awful 1977 Star Pilot), wove two separate tales from Greek mythology together, from Jason and the Argonauts and the 12 Labors of Hercules.  It's a brisk enough pace to keep the movie fun and cool.  Watching the movie, I could really see how it caught the attention of teenagers in the late 50's.

988600,5,6305116318,"A Real Action Adventure with the Greatest Hero of All time !!!!,

HOW DOES THIS FILM WORK SO WELL?

This old, dubbed in, and poorly acted epic is actually awfully good entertainment. Most of the transparent plot sequences are a joy to behold despite their obvious and predictable nature. I still recall from the theatre [1959] the scenes where Hercules threw the Discus into the heavens at the shock of all onlookers and when he fought the Creten Bull as a mortal and actually bled. It does not matter that the Creten Bull was just an ordinary steer [in reality], as the scene, like all the action scenes involving Steve Reeves, illustrates ""reel pathos"". When I saw the film again, over 40 years later, my perceptions where essentially unchanged - it was awesome!

After each viewing I found myself wishing, and then imagining that I was Hercules.

Reeves projects a uniquely wholesome and nievely irrepressible goodness that exemplifies how good will ""ALWAYS"" ultimately triumph over evil regardless of the odds or circumstances. Even the phony ""dubbed in"" tough guy voice, fails to undo the uncorrupted qualities of Hercules' which Reeves projects throughout the film in literally every scene. This is a real action adventure with the greatest hero of all time.",1138924800,6,1264,4.976303317535545
988601,5,6305116318,"Hey, these film were cartoon fun.  Nobody in their right mind should even attemt to review Hercules or Hercules Unchained in a serious manner!  Reeves was fabulous looking and he was the original action man, muscle-bound boy`s toy creation, super hero of the 1950`s.  Of course, he couldn`t act and his voice was dubbed.  Another thing, he was not tall.  In one scene, we see him towering over all the others, especially Iole but later on, when he talking to Iole (Sylvia Koscina) he is the same height as her!!  The director continually placed him on high vantage points to make him seem taller. He was a bit like the bionic man!!

Still, those fims had a charm and innocence which make them entertaining.

I laughed at the scene where Hercules arrives at the battle scene to help Jason and the pals.  Jason looks up from his sword combat and shouts, `It`s Hercules!`

All the others, including the enemy warriors stop and look, and then go back to their sword fighting!

Also, at the end, Hercules brings down a huge building single handedly to prevent about 6 warriors on horse back from attacking his band of warriors.  Apart from the threat of killing all his own men, it would have been easier to defeat the few horsemen by hand combat.  Still, we had to see Reeves flexing all his muscles!  I remember in the cinema where I first saw Hercules circa 1960, we all cheered like mad when the building came down.  He was our hero!!  If only we could look like him, aged 10 years!!

They were cartoon films and should just be enjoyed as timeless nostalgia.  Great fun!!!

Did he remove all his chest hair? His chest always looked shiny and polished!! Thanks for the memories, Steve!

988605,5,6305116318,"Ah, yes! Those were the days! Disregard the dubbed-in dialogue and hokey plot lines. The orginal 1957 ""Hercules"" is a treasure of fantasy and fun. To those Americans who possess a sense of the past (what used to be known fondly as ""nostalgia"" prior to the MTV generation and its contemptuous stance toward anything that occurred prior to the maturation of Jennifer Lopez's big, fat posterior), Johnny Weismuller was Tarzen. Bela Lugosi was Dracula. Clayton Moore was the Lone Ranger. And Steve Reeves was Hercules. Long before Arnold there was Steve Reeves, the prototype body builder who in the 1940s and 50s surpassed what Charles Atlas initiated a generation earlier. A scrawny, unathletic kid who was teased unmercifully, Reeves decided to do something about his predicament. He made body building and fitness a way of life. Between 1945 and 1950, Reeves won every body building competition and award in the universe, and he did so without the use of steroids or any other drugs. It didn't take long for Hollywood to come calling. After being considered and then turned down for the role of Samson (for being ""too muscular"") in the 1949 MGM production of ""Samson and Delilah"" opposite Heddy Lamarr, Reeves spent a few years playing mostly forgetable parts in a number of films before achieving celluloid stardom in his adopted home, Italy. In 1957 Reeves portrayed the legendary Greek hero Hercules in the film of the same name, and repeated the role in its sequel, ""Hercules Unchained,"" two years later. Reeves was extraordinarily handsome with black wavy hair and piercing blue eyes. With his beard and spectacular physique, Reeves looked exactly like the image of the Greek demigod as it had been depicted for thousands of years. So ingrained became his image in the minds of movie fans, that the names ""Steve Reeves"" and ""Hercules"" became synonomous. For a time in the late 1950s and early 1960s he was the highest-paid movie star in the world. To kids growing up in an innocent age of malt shops, high school dances, science-fiction comics, and ""Father Knows Best,"" Reeves was the epitome of wholesome manliness. He became the idol and inspiration for a whole new generation of weightlifters and body builders, including Lou Ferrigno, Franco Columbo, Reg Park, and old Arnold himself. He enchanted young and old alike as Hercules and as a number of other legendary Greco-Roman characters. In the late 1960s while still fit as a fiddle, very popular, and only in his early 40s, Reeves was asked by Sergio Leonne to star in a series of Spaghetti Westerns. But Reeves decided to leave the acting business. His place was taken by Clint Eastwood, and the rest is history (there's that anachronistic word again). Reeves continued living in Italy where he could be spotted daily ""power-walking"" (rapidly walking while carrying light weights in his arms) around all the famous sites in Rome. By the 1990s he and his wife returned to America where they raised horses and lived quietly on a beautiful ranch in Southern California. Reeves still looked great into his seventies and remained a steadfast advocate of drug-free athletics. Which is why it was so shocking to hear of his sudden death from cancer in 2000. Supposedly, Reeves visited his physician and was diagnosed with an accutely malignant form of cancer. In two weeks, he was dead. Upon hearing the news, I couldn't accept the fact of his passing. ""Steve Reeves dead? Can't be."" He always seemed so invincible. How time marches on. But the image of Reeves as the prototype celluloid demigod will endure. In the hearts and memories of many a young boy in the 1950s and 60s, there was no more popular person in the world than Steve Reeves. In many ways, Reeves may well have been the last great role model of an America that used to be. Malt shops are gone. Early sci-fi classic films with thoughtful plots like Howard Hawks' ""The Thing From Another World"" and Robert Wise's ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" are now considered archaic by a generation whose attention span is measureable in nanoseconds. High school dances long ago devolved into loud, coarse, uncivil environments known as ""clubs."" There are no TV shows even remotely resembling the quaint idealism of ""Father Knows Best."" Yet certain images from yesteryear remain transfixed eternally in the minds of those still thoughtful enough to remember. Steve Reeves will always be the one and only ""Hercules."" So long, pal.",1064707200,158,4439,4.935828877005347
988606,4,6305116318,"Finally, Steve Reeves on DVD!  The version sent to me was by Gemstone Entertainment; but appears to be the same version as United American Video.  A few years back I was on Steve's web site and commented that I was disappointed that there were none of his films on DVD, and the reply that I got back was, ""Only on VHS now; but just wait a bit longer....""  I remember the first time I saw this movie as a kid, I was totally hooked on Steve Reeves and his name was forever connected with Hercules, which is kind of funny considering that he only made two Hercules movies.  Though watching Italian movies can take a little getting used to, mainly due to the editing practices, in addition to dubbing the sound in after the movie had been completed, this movie holds the test of time very well, considering that it's almost 45 years old.  My only real complaints are that it's not presented in a natural widescreen format and that the copy of the print was not in pristene condition; but don't let the TV format, soft focus and colors in some spots, and a few scratches and specks during the movie deter you from getting this classic.  Some day I'm hoping to see a higher grade edition, in widescreen, with the film digitally restored and maybe a few extras; but until then, this will more than suffice.",1043452800,37,1299,4.436974789915967
988607,4,6305116318,"This movie is a wonderful treat for those of us who marveled at Steve Reeves and his awesome presence in a series of otherwise forgettable 1960s sword and sorcery adventures. Reeves, a former Mr. America and Mr. Universe, was absolutely stunningly handsome, and as a result became the perfect archetype for young pubescent males looking for a role model. While his wonderful baritone voice was dubbed (much later I  heard him talk on ""Entertainment Tonight"" about the newer types of bodybuilders coming to the fore under the influence of steroids, and he squawked out an answer in a tinny little voice that made one instantly realize why he never achieved wider stardom in more diverse American films.
But he was all beef and brawn here, and with the magic of a well-dubbed vocal effort became the star of the decade. This was his first role, as the immortal Hercules, and he plays the part well. As someone who saw the movie dozens of times in the theaters, believe me, it was all Reeves that explained the hit movie and the string of successors that followed. Of course, film producer Joseph E. Levine threw in the lovely Sylvia Koscina and a veteran cast of character actors. The special effects are a bit dated, and the sets are nice, but any chance to watch Reeves going through the motions is an exercise in watching someone so handsome and so well built that none of the rest of it mattered. Not a great movie, but one that is fun to watch to remember way back when....Enjoy!",1033344000,11,1482,4.634980988593156
