7364227,5,B013FJFWCI,"This is closer to historical detective drama than to chemistry class.

Starts with Priestly and then includes Lavoisier, Davy, Mendeleev, Moseley, Curies, Seaborg, etc. Does a excellent job off presenting the meaning and development of the periodic table. Starts with oxygen and covers the key discoveries and the human drama that produced the whole table.

This presentation sets each scholar in their time and world. Shows them using replicas of the original lab equipment. Priestley in Puritan England, Lavoisier in the French Revolution, etc. Reenacts the famous dinner party with them both. Wonderfully done!

Explains Humphrey Davy and his background as rural school boy, to famous speaker on science to thousands in London. His reckless self experiments with various gases and then discovery of 'laughing gas' is covered.

Mendeleev recieves deserved time as the key player in this drama. Covers his youth traveling thousands of miles, due to his determined mother, to get a scientific education in pre Soviet Russia. Presents the key weeks of his agony in organizing his mind to write down the table. Shows his still exant documents that he used that day! I was just drawn in to his struggle. Marvelous.

Harry Moseley working in the cavendish laboratory with Rutherford is shown as it was then. Shows the apparatus he invented and used. This enables the viewer to easily follow his thinking and feel his emotion. Explains the importance of his discovery of atomic number.

The Curies and their work with radium and radioactivity gets due time. Marie's travel from Poland and struggle to be accepted as a female scientist is touching. She named a new element 'Polonia' after her homeland. Her partnership with her husband is explained.

Glenn Seaborg in California concludes the story.

This drama is the gold standard for presenting the history of ideas. I plan to watch many times with my wife, grandson and friends. I hope many more videos like this are produced!",1445558400,23,1974,5.108695652173913

7364231,5,B013FJFWCI,"Thank you PBS
I loved this documentary. I watched it in on line but I also ordered it.
Beautifully done. Great documentary. I highly recommend for anyone who is curious about elements, atoms and history of those.
Please purchase this along other fascinating DVD programs in order to support PBS.",1441238400,5,295,4.92
7364232,5,B013FJFWCI,"I have watched this series over the past several nights.  This is a subject which can be very dry, but this production is compelling and brings back information that I learned years ago in a chemistry class in a very entertaining way.  Watch this, and you will learn.",1440460800,9,267,4.541666666666667
7364233,5,B013FJFWCI,"For almost a year, I have been following BBC with their great production of elements which has fascinated me greatly since after all we humans are made of such elements and every time that I take my blood test, I have to analyze the level of those elements and then adjust my lifestyle accordingly from increasing the level and type of different sports to different food ingredients that I consume in order to maximize those elements for a healthy body. This 180 minutes of PBS production covers the elements in a different way than BBC production. This is more about the geniuses who discover the elements and the process that they go through to discover such elements. A superb, well done, informative and educational  documentary that will require many, many reviewing, rewinding and taking notes in order to soak in the information that is provided in this documentary in the most entertaining manner possible. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1440115200,29,935,4.955414012738854
7364234,5,B013FJFWCI,"A must have for any student of chemistry. It is also filmed for the layman as well. This is a video you can watch many times to get more out of it each time you watch. A very well produced show on how many of the elements were isolated and discovered. Chemistry-science teachers, I would recommend showing this at least once during the semester to your students.",1512864000,,362,4.417910447761194

I enjoyed it and that says a lot because as a student I feared and disliked science. I got this for my grandson who loves science. Presented in this way, science is enjoyable - wish I could have seen this years ago!",1498176000,3,337,4.451612903225806

7364241,5,B013FJFWCI,"An excellent historical account of four important developments in chemistry and related physics: (1) the discovery of oxygen seen through the principal experimenters of the time
(2) The use of battery-powered electricity to discover further elements  (3) the development of the periodic table from Mendeleev's early work  (3) The discovery of radio-activity and the pioneering work of the Curies and (4) the contributions of Moseley and Seaborg in the formulation of an atomic basis for chemistry.  A most likeable and lucid commentary by Michael Emerson and numerous brilliant re-enactments make this DVD a compelling choice for school libraries and the general public alike.  Highly recommended.",1479859200,5,697,5.609523809523809

A big ""Wow"" to the producers, the foundations that supported it and to the Creator God who has made and sustains an intricate world with such in-depth wonderful orders and beauty!",1528156800,,399,5.03030303030303

8727548,5,B013FJFWCI,"Very well done, in my opinion.  Models the curious and thoughtful mind.  I appreciated little things such as when a scene was shown of Lavoisier in his lab, actual drawings made by his wife of the apparatus and layout were shown.  The action is slow which is good and gives time to think as the scientists themselves were pondering.  It was a different age, one we can learn a great deal from.",1524096000,,393,4.416666666666667
