8471278,1,B005G7WGZ4,"this documentary totally sucks.
the same annoying music and video clips at the beginning of every episode.
the producers are amateurs; professional editing skills are non-existent
its just an interview of a few people with some recycled youtube videos i want my money back. Buy at your own risk.",1330128000,3,295,5.040816326530612
