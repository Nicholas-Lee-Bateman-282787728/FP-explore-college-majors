4096956,5,B0039BQYOI,"Hey, there.  This film has Mari Blanchard in all her unsubtle glory.  The film is totally horrible as was the television script it was based on but I will never forget seeing it at the Town theater in downtown Miami.  It was a little theater sandwiched in between the Paramount and some gift shop and a Sloppy Joes, orange and sandwich stand.  I loved the movie and even though it has been almost 55+ maybe more years since I saw it, I will never forget it.  I totally loved this sci-fi/trashy film and my eyes didn't droop once.  I was just so fascinated by the plot, the bosoms on Ms. Blanchard and the fair performances.  No special effects.  This all relied on telling a story and suspending any disbelief you might have.  I remember every moment to this day, especially that moment when Ms. Blanchard is trying to steal something out of a dress shop and she's in the dressing room and looks down at the sink with this ""what am I gonna do, what am I doing here, why did I do what I just do"" and suddenly she looks up at herself and she's no longer the mousy brunette but a spectacular blonde with a suddenly not so innocent look on her face.  Honestly, this film is a blast and a keeper, especially if you are stuck in your house on a rainy day or have encephalitis or menengitis or something that's keeping you in bed.  It'll take your mind off of it as you all of a sudden realize that not all good stuff is entertaining.  If Ms. Blanchard could have a half way descent career off of crap like this and I can remember what a knockout she was, then I think that speaks volumes.  Go ahead.  Have some fun.",1356998400,9,1609,4.25
4096957,5,B0039BQYOI,"There's something about Mari Blanchard, and I'm gay no less.  It was very interesting reading about her challenging life on several websites.  I remember her as a guest on a Perry Mason episode in the early 1960s, where she was stalked by a marksman.  Anyway, She Devil maintains a good pace, and the storyline is campy in a delightful way.  I can imagine the cast had a good time making this film.  I've shown my VHS copy from off TV years ago to several friends and they enjoyed it.",1353888000,5,484,4.393258426966292
4096958,5,B0039BQYOI,"Given the age of this film, it's very well preserved here, a lot better than I had expected.  These were the years of low-budget sci-fi/horror flicks, and this is one very special to me as I almost married a girl who looked exactly like Mari Blanchard, albeit twenty years younger.  The camera and director really liked Blanchard in this film and it showed. It very sad that they don't make films like this this anymore.  Modern horror is very ghoulish and gross to the point of being sickening, while this takes us back to a time where films actually required to have some semblance of a story before they were released as opposed to nothing more than people being torn apart. This is a very rare and almost unknown film to contemporary movie-goers, but well worth the money. If you're into these types of films, I highly recommend this one.  Just staring at Blanchard's stunning presence for 90-minutes is well worth the price of admission. You won't be disappointed.[...]  Barry E. Taff,Ph. D.",1348790400,6,996,4.734104046242774
4096959,2,B0039BQYOI,"It is a pity that this edition of ""She Devil"", made by the Spanish company L'Atelier 13 (which has released other films in excellent copies), is so poor. Mari Blanchard plays the title ""diabla"", an agonizing tuberculosis dark-haired patient who is literally revived with a serum that turns her into a hideous blonde ""femme fatale"". This is really a shame because the pack has a handsome presentation, including a booklet and two other versions of the story that inspired the film, which were made for television. The copy is not in the wide-screen format (as was the film, released in RegalScope, another name for CinemaScope) and the image quality is very low. If you are a fan of this Kurt Neumann cult film, you will have to do with this for now.",1344470400,9,749,4.681818181818182
4096960,5,B0039BQYOI,"This is Science Fiction at its best, because the most frightening thing is ... could it happen?  A nice aside is to see Grandmama Addams in a normal role!",1380672000,2,154,4.310344827586207
4096961,4,B0039BQYOI,"This movie is much more interesting than I thought it would be.  Mari Blanchard as the She Devil has an envious figure and good looks.  The outfits she wore complimented her figure and added to her beauty -I would love to have clothes like that!  She was
evil, yet in some ways her character evoked sympathy.  The ending was good.",1373328000,2,330,4.45
4096962,4,B0039BQYOI,"I remember seeing this type of movie when I was a boy.  The blue ray, and sound are OK remember these were cheap B movies put out on the cheapest film stock.  The actors, and production teams were second rate, but every once in a while they put out a enjoyable little movie that some of us old timers still enjoy watching.  This is part of film history, and I like to think worth having in your blue ray collection.",1370044800,,415,4.1625
4096963,2,B0039BQYOI,Decent image quality but She Devil has to be Kurt Neumann's worst sci-fi movie. The dialog is infantile and the big deal here is that Mari Blanchard is able to change the color of her hair. A wig would have done just as well for her. In the original story she can change her features. Best thing about the movie is Paul Sawtell's sleazy main title. The rest of the score is good too.,1368057600,,383,4.1891891891891895
4096964,4,B0039BQYOI,"Thoroughly enjoyable ""B"" flick looks amazing on Blu-Ray!  I'm so use to seeing murky copies of these kinds of movies on VHS and late night TV - it was a little startling to see She Devil in such a pristine form.  Fun film!",1366761600,2,222,4.1395348837209305
4096965,4,B0039BQYOI,"As much I love 50's sci-fi and monster movies, this one somehow eluded me all these years.  But after reading a few good reviews, I decided it was time to correct that oversight.  And after viewing the film for the first time, I'm prepared to call ""She Devil"" a minor classic.  There are other reviews that give you the details of the plot, but I think this is one that's best enjoyed with very little foreknowledge.  Suffice it to say that if you like low-budget films that somehow succeed on creativity and raw nerve (not to mention a quite committed performance from the leading lady), you'll probably have a good time with this one.

Like other recent genre releases from Olive Films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers/dp/B007Y1NNAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>&nbsp;and the oft-overlooked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Space-Children/dp/B007PXYVA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Space Children</a>, the transfer on this one is top-notch.  I viewed the anamorphic widescreen DVD on my Blu-ray player connected to a 60"" plasma screen, and was very satisfied with the results. Unfortunately, there are no extras at all, just some generic chapter stops.  But if you're a fan of the film, my guess is that you'll be delighted to have such a fine copy for your collection.  And if, like me, you're just discovering She Devil, you will probably appreciate that such apparent care has been taken in offering this top-notch presentation of the film.",1362960000,3,1606,5.892241379310345
4096966,4,B0039BQYOI,"I saw this as a kid in the theater and was totally fascinated by it.  Imagine!  A tse tse fly serum that cures disease and changes hair color, to boot. This movie is so much fun.  Get a group together and you will be in B movie heaven.  Mari was a doll and she appeared in a few movies but, contracted cancer at a relatively young age and passed away.  But she left a lasting impression.  You might double bill this with Frankenstein's Daughter and really be in 7th heaven.",1362960000,2,473,4.2
4096967,4,B0039BQYOI,"Like previous reviewers, I recall this movie from TV reruns in my boyhood ... and having been a boy of just the right age then, I especially recall Mari Blanchard! But when I ordered this crisp new DVD release, I wondered if it would hold up after all these decades.

No need to worry! It's still as enjoyable as ever, with the additional bonus of being faithful to the classic sci-fi short story on which it's based, Stanley Weinbaum's ""The Adaptive Ultimate"" -- and how often does that happen? It may be modest in scope & budget, but it makes the most of what it's got -- and what it's got the most of is Mari Blanchard, playing the happily amoral Kyra Zelas with trampy zest. Just watch her sashay up those steps after confronting the drab, boring, but filthy rich couple in the garden. Clearly she was having a wonderful time with the role, and she just eats up the screen.

And as I watched the film again, I realized that I was still rooting for her to succeed, even though she's supposedly the monster of the story. One of the doctors refers to her as a goddess at one point, and he's not far wrong -- she's a bolt of lightning in the drab, male-dominated world of the 1950s -- and of course the gods aren't held to the same standards as mere mortals. Yes, she's got men stopping in their tracks to follow her anywhere, but they're all too willing to go along. I love the old housekeeper's sour glances at young, besotted Dr. Scott -- you can tell she's thinking, ""You big dumb sap!""

In the end, of course, she has to be punished for asserting herself. The only difference between her & the gaggle of rich men she meets is that she doesn't put on the facade of respectability. She may go after what she wants, but she's open & honest about it. And she never really seems truly evil -- after all, she's just trying to survive in an alien (i.e., men's) world. Oh, she's a bad girl, and no mistake ... but you can't help liking her.

A minor film, certainly no masterpiece -- but it's great entertainment -- highly recommended!",1362528000,10,2032,4.367724867724868
4096968,4,B0039BQYOI,"This review is for the blu ray from Olive Films.  The image quality is superb, as is the audio.  There are no extras and no subtitles.  I would like to deduct a point for no subtitles alone on all Olive Films (and Warner), but this bizarre flick from the fifties is truly a B-movie masterpiece.  Mari Blanchard shines in her role as a woman reanimated from certain death with an experimental drug, which has the side effect of making her ruthlessly independent, self-seeking, and death-proof!  Albert Dekker, always entertaining, has to struggle with some truly awkward scriptwriting, but the combined talents of just about all the actors in the film make it entertaining enough.  You could take the entire film allegorically, as being anything from a glimpse into the horrors of women stepping outside their established, stereotyped roles, to a criticism of the hypocrisy of men, as the anti-heroine wraps them around her little finger.  Or better yet, just enjoy this film for what it is (even if a bit overpriced for just the film alone), and be sure to spot all the medical/science errors!  The doctors take great delight in traipsing about a T.B. patient's room without masks, and the lung x-rays look surprisingly clear of disease all around, to name just two.",1362441600,9,1266,4.883177570093458
4096969,5,B0039BQYOI,"I cannot believe this film is finally being released on DVD; I have waited probably some thirty years to see this again. I first saw it when I was a little kid, on a black and white teevee set in San Diego (Creature Features comes to mind), and I never forgot it. Though at a young age I didn't know what campy meant, or what having a voluptuous body entailed - I just knew there was something evil and sexy about Mari Blanchard's character.  You can say this film has haunted me because through the years, I have waited for it to repeat on teevee, searched for it on cable (set up TiVo so it would auto-record any Mari Blanchard film - and I wouldn't miss it on the off chance some retro station aired it), and even did an extensive search on the internet only to find a $35.00 VHS copy (oh, come on!).  Ms. Blanchard plays a TB patient who is given an experimental drug, which not only restores her health, but turns her into a murderous she devil. The film is as cheesy as all get out but who cares, its pure fun. About four years ago I found the short story The Adaptive Ultimate by Stanley G. Weinbaum upon which the film is based. The story was written in 1935 so of course its not glamorous and kitschy like this 1957 film. If you like films like The Hypnotic Eye (with the devilishly handsome Jacques Bergerac), the original Attack of the 50-Foot Woman, The Brain That Wouldn't Die, or Tormented, you'll love She Devil. I'm doing a happy, campy, sexy dance!",1357776000,6,1465,4.323636363636363

8392054,5,B0039BQYOI,"Whoa! Not only is this bad girl totally hot but she gets herself in and out of close calls in almost every scene. So glad I bumped into this at YouTube. But with Paramount's production values and Olive Films' restorative expertise, this BluRay edition will be awesome. Speaking of Olive, check out ""A New Leaf"" and ""Obsession"".",1406332800,2,327,4.754385964912281

8392056,4,B0039BQYOI,Nice modest little late 50's thriller.  A pair of doctor/scientists create a serum from the life juices of a fruit fly.  A fruit fly?  With it they cure a moribund tuberculosis victim.  Once she is well her personality completely changes.  She is out for herself and doesn't care who she mows down in her selfish quests.  Her hair changes from brunette to platinum blonde on its own and changes back when she commits mayhem.  The doctors spend the bulk of the film trying to stop this Frankenstein monster they inadvertently created.  The DVD from Olive Films has no extras but is in excellent condition.
