8066871,5,B0009UZG82,The Brits do mystery so well. Have loved this series from it's start. Every bit as good as Inspector Frost and P.D. James. Love the way the lead characters play off the rich man/working girl relationship.,1319241600,,204,4.694444444444445
8066872,1,B0009UZG82,"At least one of the discs is damaged - ""Deception on His Mind"".  I have cleaned the lens on the player just to be sure, and the picture shill breaks up then freezes.",1316649600,,165,4.0
8066873,4,B0009UZG82,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoy British Mysteries and this set meets all of our expectatons.
The only problem with the set was the three broken holders for the DVDs.  Luckily no DVDs were damaged - I don't think the problem lies with the shipper but with the manufacturer of the case to hold multiple DVDs.",1312502400,,305,4.446428571428571
8066874,5,B0009UZG82,"I like the author, Elizabeth George, and I like these adaptations. They do not follow the story line all the time, but they are still excellent.",1168300800,3,144,4.576923076923077
8066875,5,B0009UZG82,"Wait. They're British, and somewhat understated, so they can't really ROCK!!! But they rock anyway. Best detective series out there (other than Foyle's War).",1163030400,10,157,5.583333333333333
8066876,5,B0009UZG82,Over the years I have seen several of the Inspector Lynley mysteries and was very impressed. This collection provides 13 intriguing episodes including the premier. The pairing of Lynley and Havers makes for great characters and brisk repartee between the lofty Inspector and the common sargent Havers. This is really a great mystery series with suspenseful plots and very talented actors. The DVDs are of high quality and the first series has quite few extras. Well worth the money.,1160092800,10,482,5.113924050632911
