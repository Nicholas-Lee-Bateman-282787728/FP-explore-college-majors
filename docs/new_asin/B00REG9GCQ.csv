So guess what happens in ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" which takes the battle between good (Aslan) and evil (green mist) to the high seas. The first half of the movie is rather choppy and rushed, but the second half blossoms into a solid adventure yarn with  sorcerers, dragons and a nameless evil lurking near the end of the world.

Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) have been sent to stay with their relatives, including their noxious cousin Eustace (Will Poulter). But then a mysterious painting whisks them into Narnia -- right next to a Narnian ship, the Dawn Treader. King Caspian (Ben Barnes) is on a quest to retrieve seven exiled Narnian lords (and their enchanted swords).

But they soon find that something is spreading through the Lone Islands -- a malevolent green mist that begins to mess with the Dawn Treader's crew. The only way to defeat it is to lay the swords on the table of Aslan (Liam Neeson). They must grapple with some terrible obstacles -- slavers, magical water, invisible foes and cursed treasure that causes a horrifying transformation in Eustace -- if they have any chance of victory...

""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" is one of those movies that requires patience. The first half is kind of choppy -- we're given a string of episodic subplots that usually end pretty quickly, and which are pretty rushed (the whole slavery-island thing takes about TEN MINUTES!). I don't blame director Michael Apted, though, since C.S. Lewis' book was even MORE episodic.

However, the movie becomes smoother and more streamlined in the second half. Suddenly we have a solid intermingling of religious symbolism (both dark and light), some humor (""I'm a pacifist-"" ""EN GARDE!""), and a truly epic sea battle as the climax (including the most grotesque sea serpent I've ever seen in a movie -- knotty green blubber-skin and a mouthful of spidery tentacles).

Keynes and Henley give strong performances as two kids on the cusp of adulthood -- Lucy struggles with her envy for her sister (even stealing a magic spell), and Edmund feels that he isn't appreciated as a man. And Caspian -- now sporting a hot little beard and piratey clothes -- has to deal with his daddy issues, and even gets a love interest near the end.

And Poulter gives a very impressive performance as Eustace -- his character starts out as a fusty, annoying little twerp, but a magical transformation helps turn him into a very different person. And his friendship with mousy swordsman Reepicheep is just cute.

""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" has a wobbly first half, but the combination of action, humor and uplifting fantasy really makes it fly.",1423699200,,3002,5.18595041322314
