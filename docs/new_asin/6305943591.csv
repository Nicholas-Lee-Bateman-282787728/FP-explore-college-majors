1091550,4,6305943591,"This neat little vampire flick---known in Europe as CURSE OF THE GREEN EYES---is one of those rare films that although made on a small budget, manages to catch lightning in bottle.  As is often the case, those involved probably didn't even realize what was so special about the film they'd made.

The film is a fine example of the sexy and imaginative horror movies made in Europe during the 1960s.  It features interesting turns on the genre, spooky cinematography and production design, and an unmistakably 1960s musical score.

The DVD---which is Region 1---has good sound and a good, clear picture. A fine addition for any Vampire/Eurohorror collector, and at a bargain price. You'll never feel the same way during a nighttime power outage after seeing this.",1150070400,25,762,5.023809523809524
1091551,3,6305943591,"Odd film concerned with the mysterious deaths of local villagers.  An inspector is sent to the small town to solve the mystery, where he encounters a collection of unusual characters. Before a murder occurs the electricity in town fails and vampire marks are discovered on the victim's necks. In addition, the bodies are also vanishing after the funeral. Upon talking to the locals the inspector discovers that a professor and two assistants have moved into an abandoned castle six months earlier, conducting research on blood. The villagers express fears regarding vampires inhabiting the grotto adjacent to the castle. The movie relies more on plot, with some excellent photography and creepy night sounds as opposed to thrills. Fans of modern horror films may want to stay away from this one. DVD is a quality transfer of the film.",1125360000,20,834,5.087591240875913

Not to say that it's great, but you can clearly see that the people behind this film were making an effort to tell a story, and pulling it off better than most B pictures.",1407456000,3,365,4.27536231884058

1091851,3,6305943591,A neat little low budget horror movie from around 1964. You have to be of a certain age to appreciate these films. Way to slow and boring for modern audiences. I recommend this to people that remember watching shock theatre years ago on Saturday nights and love the old movies as I do.,1395705600,2,285,4.39622641509434

correct. The picture is good as is the sound.",1383350400,,333,3.8405797101449277
1091855,4,6305943591,"After six women are murdered, inspector Doren is on the case. While staying at an inn, the seventh woman is killed in the room next to the Inspector's! The locals blame vampires, and send Doren to see the town witch. She warns him of the vampire epidemic, and gives him the magic weapon to defeat them. Doren is invited to stay at the castle of a mysterious professor. What is his role in all this? Soon, the dead begin to rise. Does Doren stand a chance against the forces of darkness? The actual CAVE OF THE LIVING DEAD itself doesn't really come into play until near the end. A fun, different sort of vampire movie...",1377388800,4,620,4.4
1091856,3,6305943591,"Not enough people listen to the side characters. Heed the old village woman. She knows things about them, of how they were driven to the grottos over two hundred years ago by a curse, of how they venture out each night at midnight for one hour minus one minute. Don't dismiss the castle manservant, him who cautions a young lady: ""The lights went out all over. All the hounds yellin'. The moon hid behind the clouds. The wind blew in the trees. It's not good for you to be out alone.""

Were you and I avid spelunkers, we'd surely still avoid someplace called the Cave of the Living Dead. But you and I, we're neither as fearless nor as intrepid as Inspector Frank Doren (Adrian Hoven) of the Interpol. About to embark on holiday, in some bar eyeing the gams on some girl, he's pulled away to a remote German village and tasked with solving the mysterious deaths of six young women, the first of which happened six months ago. One quirk attached to the case: in each death, the village has suffered from an hour-long power outage. You get the feeling this won't be a routine police enquiry?

It's an inauspicious arrival for the investigator. He checks into the local inn at night only to wake up the next morning to learn that the maid occupying the next room has become the latest fatality. The local police are baffled. The superstitious villagers are frightened. The creepy physician forcefully insists that these deaths resulted from heart failure, an assertion that earns him a quizzical look from Inspector Doren. The Chief Constable, when briefing our guy, had remarked that the deaths had all occured in close proximity to the grottos. The chief even supplies him with an infrared viewer.

An above-average 3 out of 5 stars for this one. Directed by Akos V. Ratony (I bet I know what the ""V"" stands for), ""Der Fluch der gr&uuml;nen Augen"" is a modest but nifty slice of Euro-horror. This film was first released in Germany in 1964. Producer Richard Gordon then picked it up, dubbed it (not quite impeccably) in English, and re-released it, re-titling it ""Night of the Vampires"" in the UK and ""Cave of the Living Dead"" in the U.S. It's filmed in black and white which bolsters the gothic atmosphere. Adrian Hoven makes for a composed and open-minded hero (usually, the frustration lies in that the hero takes so long to buy into the supernatural). He draws from the script enough satisfying beats to flesh out his character. It's too bad that Karin Field's role of professor's assistant (and obligatory love interest) doesn't get the same good treatment. No end of colorful (re: suspicious) characters skulking around, whether it's the deaf village bully or that creepy doctor or the even creepier professor who arrived six months ago (dunh-dunh-DUNH!). I guess those two village cops are too bumbling to be considered as suspects. But they do provide some comic moments. Adding to the off-kilter feel is the film score comprised of this inappropriately upbeat instrumental that we only hear at the beginning and end of the movie. It's a jarring choice, probably what the director intended. The film also produces traditional horror scares that, by today's standards, aren't so scary. Probably the most unsettling moment happens within the first fifteen minutes as we see the shadow of an eerie figure sidling up to the inn with clawlike hands outstretched. During, of course, a power outage. It's a cool cult film, but I wish it had explained the correlation between the blackouts and the vampires. As an avid spelunker, I demand to know.",1376784000,,3546,4.800327332242226

1091859,4,6305943591,"My friends and I generally liked this one, though we thought the ending was quite lame and uninspired. There's a really pretty lead actress, would like to have seen her in more films. Every actor did a fine job and the story was good up to the end where it kind of flopped. The picture was pretty good. Not grainy or worn. I wouldn't spend too much for this but it's still worth having.",1327449600,5,386,4.22972972972973
1091860,5,6305943591,"Interesting entry to gothic/Euro/vampire series of the 1960's, this b&w little gem has alot going for it such as odd characters: mute menace, weird village doctor, amiable/alcoholic tavern keeper, black man-servent of great strength; a breezy jazz soundtrack; some outstanding set design (caveren/tombs) and nice camera work.
It seems there has been a number of deaths (6 young women in the last 6 months) in this tiny village in the middle of Yugoslavia and Inspector Doren (Adrian Hoven...catch him in the Jess Franco RED LIPS films!!!) is sent to get to the bottom of things. He ends up battling vampires of course! When the young tavern maid is killed we see shadows of Nosferatu all along the walls. You've just got to love it! You have gothic castles, scantly clad Euro-babes, a gypsy witch-woman, Wolfgang Preiss (Dr. Mabuse himself!) as a bizzare scientist living high a-top the village in rotting splendor, and those wonderful on location Yugoslavian village shots which are probably exactly the same today, white-washed simple structures 100+ yrs. old! You can smell the decay of vampires! You can see everyone's breath in the cold dampness! Lots of candle-light and crackling fires!
This is certainly an underated little treasure of a vampire film and I would urge any lover of such horrors to snatch up a copy before this one goes out of print. Great (AND FUN!) stuff.",1208044800,13,1380,5.004347826086956
7897964,5,6305943591,"Good spooky mid 60's West German-made, English-dubbed horror-thriller.  A police inspector goes to an isolated small town to investigate strange vampiric killings.  The mood is similar to the West German Edgar Wallace films made at the time.  Has a politically incorrect character in the role of a reclusive professor's black servant.  Has some spookily atmospheric scenes.  The only available DVD is the Image Entertainment DVD.  The quality is very good.  No extras though.  The film starts immediately.  Highly recommended for the film itself.",1524268800,,546,5.481927710843373

7897968,3,6305943591,"Sexist, misogynistic, racist. What fun the 60s were. This is pretty much for fans of B horror movies, nothing really scary in it, at least by today's standards. The movie has a small problem with continuity here and there, which is normal for this genre. The dubbing isn't as bad as usual for this type of movie, most of the time what they say makes some sense. A bit of brief nudity, side-boobage and open front nightie, nothing really exciting.",1478649600,,446,4.5875
7897969,4,6305943591,Excellent atmosphere and enjoyable.  Brace yourself if you like the eerie Edgar Wallace type of dreary environment.  The vampires are great and the mood is well worth the time to watch this.  The print is nice too..,1478304000,,215,4.756756756756757

7897971,3,6305943591,"You won't fear shadow after this movie, but it's still kind of fun.  I watched this online, not DVD.  The image and sound were both ""grainy.""  That didn't adversely affect the movie too much, though.  Funky 60s music, man!  (Or was that the 70s slang?)  I love old horror, and this didn't disappoint in that genre.  It's no ""Alien"", though.  Great play B&W light and shadow in places.  The plot is rather silly.  It did, however, do some things that are rather different--almost unique.
