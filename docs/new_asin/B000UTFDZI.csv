This is a true story, which John Huston was passionate about bringing to the screen. Which is why he worked so hard to put the project together. Pele was in it because he was involved in the events depicted in the film. The film cast one or two other of the original protagonists to play themselves, and also, I believe, genuine orphans to play the orphans. This was intended to lend authenticity to the performances, which it does. It also lends a natural, unforced, quality to the performances of the children. The quality of the script and direction is such that you don't need precursor events to set up one's knowledge of the children's characters. They are simply who they are, and the viewer, if paying attention, understands them and their motivations immediately. This film is admittedly not typically in the American style, as it does not spell everything out. It tends more towards the European style of film making, with its lean and spare script assuming intelligence in the viewer. I love the refreshingly un-cutesie nature of the film, and the fact that its not a straight-forward City Corporation bad, orphans good story. It is never that black and white.",1428969600,,1340,4.8304347826086955

Given the low budget and time constraints of a project already underway that required rewriting with a shooting schedule already set the movie is not too bad. The real last minute miracle of landing famous actor/director John Huston whose performance stands out was a major coup. Legendary soccer star, Pele does a creditable job as a non actor portraying himself and the kids are delightful. If you're expecting spify production values you will be disappointed. Unfortunately the DVD transfer is blurry and reduced to a 5/4 aspect ration from the original widescreen release. The soundtrack is of equally low quality.",1422403200,,734,5.125

8214779,1,B000UTFDZI,"My one star rating is actually one star more than it deserves.  I really wanted to rate the copy of this wonderful movie with no star whatsoever.  Doing so however, would have qualified my review as contrary to the guidelines for submission and it probably wouldn't have been posted.

This DVD is absolutely the poorest quality video I've ever seen.  I was very excited to receive the movie because I liked it from the very first time I viewed it, which was many years ago.  The sub standard video and sound quality make it almost impossible to watch all the way through.  Even though it cost under two dollars to purchase, I would encourage everyone not to.  I don't believe anyone would just discard two, one dollar bills for the sake of throwing them away.  Buying this very inexpensive ""Minor Miracle"" DVD would be doing just that!  I should have known that purchasing something that cost next to nothing will get you something that is worth next to nothing.  Unfortunately, to date I have not been able to locate a more professional copy of this great movie.",1244419200,5,1063,4.636363636363637
