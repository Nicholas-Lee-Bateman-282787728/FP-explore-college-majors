2666876,1,B000J41GSM,"If I could leave zero stars, I would.  I picked this up thinking it was de Palmas Dahlia- what a complete waste of time... I forwarded through most of it..not sure why...I guess I was hoping I hadn't wasted my money.  Please don't encourage this guy to make any more movies...seriously, it was awful.",1162944000,,300,4.537037037037037

2666878,1,B000J41GSM,"Ulli Lommel's (who is this anyway) Black Dahlia is the most worthless piece of nothing that I have ever subjected myself to.  I'm embarassed to admit that I actually watched this poorly produced, poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorly directed piece of poo.  Steer Clear of this trash.",1161216000,2,284,5.0212765957446805
8149145,1,B000J41GSM,"I accidentally ordered this movie, thinking it was the other 2006 Black Dahlia film, with Hilary Swank, and when this came on, I had absolutely no idea what to think.  I actually watched this entire log of dookie, it was like a bad train wreck.  I kept wanting to look away, but couldn't veer away from my state of disbelief and curiosity. This movie is actually worse than dragon wars.  It's gory, but not in a scary way, they cut up a lot of girls, but it's very obviously all rubber body parts, and it's effing hilarious.  It's like some really bad combination of a snuff film, outtakes from a reality show, and Insomniac, all shot in infomercial quality film.  Seriously, worst movie ever! I don't advocate drug use, but this movie makes it seem ok.  It had everything: gimp masks, football helmets, rubber body parts from a Halloween store, a ""cop"" who always wears a hoodie and has emo hair, oh yeah, and a Satan worshiping school girl who does a lot of push-ups and plays army. If I ever meet Uli Lommel, I'm going to shake his hand, then kick him in the junk and demand my money back.",1321920000,4,1092,4.407960199004975
8149146,4,B000J41GSM,"Ulli Lommel's Black Dahlia: 7 out of 10. No the score is not a misprint. Yes I'm going to have to use the entire review to explain this grievous lack of judgment.

First of all this is not the studio release of Black Dahlia. This is a Z budget rip off with decent cover art. Second this is an Ulli Lommel movie who I swear is Uwe Boll's uncle and one of the worst directors working in sub-par serial killer films today. (His Zodiac Killer was one of the worst films I've seen this year) He and his trusty 1985 camcorder have been shoveling out serial killer movies the last few years and he apparently has some compromising pictures of Lion's Gate executives because they keep releasing them.

Half the cast is unnecessary, the drunken cop is over the top and one of the main bad guys is Anna Nicole Smith's first husband. The Saw rip-off directing style and three sets location are horrible.

So why the positive score? Somewhere in the first twenty minutes or so the movie becomes so bad it actually becomes good. There is something ridiculously appealing about vivisection, bondage and catholic school girl uniforms mixed in with swing music. Now read that last sentence again if that doesn't appeal to you run far and fast. There is nothing else to see here so keep moving.

Also in the films favor is that the acting isn't so bad it grates on the nerves. (A real risk with zero budget films) The gore scenes are plentiful and done in a Monty Python over the top style. The ladies are somewhat attractive and actually look like real people. (I don't think this was a naturalistic touch by Lomell I just think he couldn't afford better looking plastic woman.) The soundtrack is an excellent combination of catchy monk style classical (think the Conan soundtrack) and 40's style pop tunes. When a pigtailed catholic schoolgirl and two masked guys dance around with severed limbs to a Sinatra tune you simply can't wipe the smile off my face. That's why I liked it. Excuse me while I go seek some help.",1255910400,8,2003,4.555555555555555
8149147,1,B000J41GSM,"I was also unaware there were two versions of this movie made. I should have known to stop watching after the first ten minutes of the movie, but i sat through the whole thing thinking it might get better. IT DOESN""T!  Don't getme wrong I am a huge b-movie fan and i love budget horror movies, but this was as close to unwatchable as i have ever seen.  I couldn't tell but it almost seemed like they were deliberatley attempting to make a bad movie...which is always a bad move.  it was as if the directer (Ulli) had no movie making experience what so ever and the actors had never taken a acting class in their lives.  A freshmen in film school could have made a better film.  This film is BAD and not the good kind of bad...just straight bad. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! Zero Stars!!!",1211587200,4,781,4.285714285714286
8149148,1,B000J41GSM,"Sadly, I also confused this movie with the one released in 2006. The ""acting"", ""directing"", and ""filming"" of this movie are so disgustingly terrible. I paid $10 for this movie, and I should have known that the quality was going to be poor. Do not waste your money!

I only gave it a 1 because it made me rate it, otherwise it would be a -100.",1199750400,,342,4.181818181818182
8149149,1,B000J41GSM,"I bought this movie on sale thinking it was the good one (THE Black Dahlia), which I have not seen yet. I knew in the first several minutes that it was going to be bad. By the time it got to the second murder scene, which was identical to the first, I started the fast forward and just inserted my own dialogue, which was mostly ""blah blah blah."" You would have to pay me at least $20/hour to watch it again. Not since Plan 9 From Outer Space have I seen plot and acting flounder so badly. Plan Nine, though, is genuinely funny. This tripe is not.",1178755200,,547,4.121495327102804
8149150,1,B000J41GSM,I wouldn't wish any Ulli Lommel movie on my worse enemy.  This movie was terrible.  Is this guy mental or does he really think that he makes quality movies?,1167350400,,156,4.344827586206897
8149151,1,B000J41GSM,"I ordered this DVD mistakenly, confusing it with Brian De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia"" which was also released in 2006.

I suffered through about 30 minutes of this near unwatchable film in the hopes it was a slow starter. It would be no exaggeration to say that in comparison to this picture a movie like ""Ishtar"" looks like a cinematic masterpiece.",1166918400,6,348,4.704918032786885
8149152,1,B000J41GSM,"I also was unaware of the fact that there were 2 ""versions"" of the movie. I have to ditto other reviews. Horrified, my husband and I fast forwarded assuming this was some sort of dream sequence gone bad and the investigation would start up soon.  Wrong.  Just avoid this movie it is really awful.",1166918400,4,296,4.462962962962963
8149153,1,B000J41GSM,"Hands down the worst movie i've ever seen.  My buddy makes better ones for his freshman film class.  The only reason this is making money is because people mistake it for the blockbuster that was recently released under the same title.  We fast fowarded after the first 5 minutes to see if it got better, but to no avail.  I see better acting in the children's theater and better effects at the free haunted house that my neighbors throw each year. Thank GOD for dollar rentals in the wonderful city of LA. (i only wasted 1 dollar and about 6 minutes of my life)",1165708800,2,562,4.375
8149154,1,B000J41GSM,"This movie was the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life.  I wouldn't even give it one star.  A complete waste of my time and money.  Shop well, don't see this movie.  Horrible, horrible movie!!!!",1164931200,,205,4.315789473684211
