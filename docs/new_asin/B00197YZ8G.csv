3426061,5,B00197YZ8G,"A great array of British talent with some Irish (The Corrs) and some American (Brian Wilson), and one Australian (Barry Humphries aka Dame Edna) in a hilariously irreverent welcome to the Queen. Cliff Richard looked and sounded good as did Sir Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart and Ray Davies. Sir Elton John could have selected a better song to sing in that regal setting. Noticably absent were the Rolling Stones and The Who. Otherwise every big British name from the 60s and 70s still alive was there, and in good form. I was very touched by the appearance of Sir George Martin as chaperone to the royal family when they were introduced to the performers. Then Paul McCartney took charge for the finale. These two men thereby symbolised, and rightly so, the superior status of The Beatles in British popular culture.",1354579200,2,827,4.830985915492958
3426062,5,B00197YZ8G,"This DVD of the Party at the Palace was fantastic!! All those performers who came out and for the family, yes, the queen herself, was incredible. I am now looking for this on a CD. It was a great show for the Family.",1349222400,,216,4.046511627906977
3426063,5,B00197YZ8G,I loved watching this show the first time it was on television and now we can watch it whenever we want. We quite often put it on when we are having a party. It's GREAT entertainment!,1308355200,,183,4.111111111111111
3426064,4,B00197YZ8G,"Audio is very good, but only Dolby 2.0 stereo, video is very good and the show is very good except for the crappy 1st 4 groups (not worth seeing anyway) that the band and orchestra obviously said, ""Your music is not very good anyway and we are not going to take the time to attempt to learn and play it"", so instead the band and orchestra sits silently while they ""sing"" to Karaoke music. My Yamaha receiver in Pro Logic Enhanced mode made the music have a center channel.",1285804800,3,472,4.314606741573034

3426069,5,B00197YZ8G,"The Party at the Palace: Queen's Golden Jubile was fantistic. It was almost like you were there, but better",1224806400,2,107,4.684210526315789
3426070,5,B00197YZ8G,"Have always regrded the British Royals as having outstayed their welcome a bit - especially the younger generation - but I must say that this concert,  celebrating the Queen's 50th year of Queendom, is really quite moving and positive. Most of the Brit (and some US favorites) pop establishment appears - Tom Jones and Shirley Bassey look fabulous! - but for some not-very-mysterious reason the Stones are absent, not sure why David Bowie isn't there. But there's Rod, and Eric, and Paul, and of course Elton, and it's a pleasure to see them all lined up through the course of a very long day.

My favorite moment is Rod launching into All You Need Is Love, and then Eric and Paul dedicating While My Guitar to George. The Royals come out and chat with all the performers like old friends, and the crowd is waving little Union Jacks for a change instead of being soccer hooligans. Lots of younger stars too, not my generation, but the whole DVD is a happy occasion and well worth watching.",1218758400,9,989,4.613636363636363
