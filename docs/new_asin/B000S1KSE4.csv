8323673,5,B000S1KSE4,"This film transports us to the beautiful land of NZ, where the filmmaker embarks on a journey of curiosity, discovery, and determination. As a viewer, we're lucky enough that he takes us along with him. The scenes are gorgeously shot, yet the movie is kept very real -- I love some of the personal insights that the filmmaker interjects throughout the journey about his own life as he reflects while hiking hundreds of miles. The people he meets along the way couldn't be more colorful, and they open up to the camera in a way that is both endearing and highly entertaining. If you like adventure, the outdoors, beautiful scenery, and history, all paired with a good soundtrack and thoughtful dialog, this movie is for you!",1304640000,3,723,4.746031746031746
8323674,5,B000S1KSE4,"An entertaining and very well crafted documentary depicting one man's journey from the business and superficiality of the modern city / society to the fate of the open road. Along the way he encounters a number of unique and interesting characters whose lives he delves into creating interesting side plots. Inter-dispersed through the film he presents history lessons about the trials and tribulations the Maori people faced (and continue to) as a result of the European settling of New Zealand. He also gives the viewer a glimpse into his own life and upbringing through his introspection and reflections. For one student to write, direct, produce and edit this film, it is hard not to be impressed.",1304640000,3,701,5.051724137931035
8323675,5,B000S1KSE4,Sandor takes his viewers on a wonderful introspective journey across North New Zealand.  Along the way he sheds light on the habits and behaviors of locals and fellow travelers alike.  So many unique characters! Additionally much light is shed on the current situation for many people in the Maori community- A wonderful fresh view of a people and a culture not much explored by people in the US.  Recommended whole-heartedly!,1209600000,3,426,5.057142857142857
