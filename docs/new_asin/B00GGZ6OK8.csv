A classic Firm, but this will not disappoint. Just about all Firm videos can easily be modified to suit your fitness level, but this one will start off solid intermediate, beginning advanced+ for how hard you'll work, no fancy moves or excessive coordination necessary. The cardio in this video is also perfect for those who need low-pact due to back or knee problems. If you don't have their Fanny Lifter (2 part aerobic step) you can use any other step or even a stool that's high enough to sit on comfortably. Other equipment you'll need: dumbbells of various weights, small/light barbell (I use my dumbbells instead), a dowel or long stick (optional for stability, I use my Firm Sculpting Stick), medicine ball (I used a 4lb. ball, any weight will do), an optional 2x4 wooden plank (used to step on for heel elevation. I've never used this, but optional for muscle isolation). Also useful to note: this video is a compilation of several other Firm videos featuring their upper body routines. Each segment transitions seamlessly, imo.",1494460800,,1197,4.901477832512315
