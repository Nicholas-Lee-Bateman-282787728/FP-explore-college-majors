This contains the following episodes of the TV series:  Child's Play and the Microbots! These are two of the Best episodes of Season 2!  There is a great fight scene between the Autobots and Decepticons in Child's Play! The Decepticons want to use a Baseball park as a new base for the Space Bridge.  The Decepticons interupt a Baseball game in the middle of the park.
The Decepticons of course endanger the humans on the field and statium!  then, the Autobots arrive and the incredible fight scenes starts! Some of the Autobots and Decepticons get knocked into the center of the Space Bridge. Megatron is outside the area and tries to blast trailbreaker and Perceptor from using the Space Bridge control panel.  Several Energon cubes, Autobots, Decepticons, Optimus Prime and Starscream included vanish and are transported to another world! Findout what happens next?  In the Microbots , some humans archeologists find a lost spaceship near a Myan burial site. It is actually the Decepticon ship, the Nemisis!  If you watched Beast Wars then you have to watch this video because this refers to the Decepticons spaceship that crashed landed with Ark four million years ago. (ties into the Best Wars storyline!)  Megatron invades the site and stops the archelogists from opening the ship's hull. Guess what is inside? The Heart of Cybertron, the very thing that powered the Nemesis is implanted in Meagtron's Chest! And that is bad news for Optimus Prime and the Autobots! Find out what happens next?  Buy this video! A must have for all Children of the 1980s generation!",993081600,5,1699,4.950704225352113
