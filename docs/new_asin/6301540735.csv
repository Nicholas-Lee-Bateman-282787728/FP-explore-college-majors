I'd summarize by saying if you like Kenny G and ""smooth  Jazz"" (YUCK) than these are the tapes for you (vols 1 & 2). A  yuppie-like trendy over fluffy misinterpretaion of Ellington's otherwise  great compositions are captured here in a high budget high profile  performance in Hollywood, by otherwise fine musicians, but musicians that  CANT and shouldnt be ruining Ellingtons work in the completely annoying and  misguided manner in which they do.  These performances are very ""chuck  mangione"" like, and are utterly and completely without soul.  (""Lets all play this sheet music like robots in 8/8 time and don't you  dare add any heart to the music"" might be their motto) (""oh and  remember this is an upper crust white bread audience and we wouldnt want to  have them think this is any more ""jungle"" than, say,  Mozart"")
The musicians would be great at playing some posh dinner  music engagement or a GENERIC Summer Concert for the Hollywood Glitteratti,  (oh wait, thats what this is)
I could go on, but don't say i didn't tell ya  so....",965174400,,1121,4.815789473684211
