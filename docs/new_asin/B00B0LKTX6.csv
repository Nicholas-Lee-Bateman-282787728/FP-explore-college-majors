8560331,2,B00B0LKTX6,"Price (Patrick McKnight) is in trouble with the police for using a fake credit card. He hides out with his cousin Andre (Dane Hereford) at his frat house, his all gay frat house. The name of the detective in this film is Dick Johnson (Burton Gilliam) and the humor doesn't get any better. The gays are extremely over-the-top stereotypes. There is a scene where they attempt to spoof ""Animal House"" but it lacked humor, as did most of the film.

This is strictly a juvenile amateur attempt.  Not worth a rental. Originally released in 2003 under the title ""Sweet Hideaway.""

Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word. Near sex. No nudity.",1376697600,,626,4.777777777777778
