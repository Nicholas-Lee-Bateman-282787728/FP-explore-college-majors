5838953,4,B00DOZNIVG,It is a classic tv western and is the story of a U.S. Calvary unit in Texas after the Civil War along the Mexican border. I grew up watching it and would recommend it to all classic tv and western fans.,1384646400,,202,3.951219512195122
5838954,4,B00DOZNIVG,To bad this series was so short.  One of the better cavalry stories.  Richard Carlson did a great job as MacKenzie.  The rating gurus spelled disaster and cancellation for a number of great TV series.  This series was well produced.,1383868800,,232,4.725
5838955,5,B00DOZNIVG,Excellent old tv show.  Very good quality picture and sound on dvd.  Brought back lots of memories of watching tv in the 50's.,1383868800,8,126,4.434782608695652
5838956,5,B00DOZNIVG,"I was glad to see this old series released on DVD.  Richard Carlson is really good as the the intrepid Lt Col Ranald McKenzie of the 4th US Cavalry.  In each episode, he leads his command in pursuit of savage Indians or Mexican bandits.  Most times, they have to cross the border into Mexico to accomplish the mission.  Lt Col Mckenzie had secret orders to cross the border, but if caught or killed the US government would disavow any knowledge of his activities.  Kind of like a western Mission: Impossible. The series featured a lot of action, hard riding, and good stories, all packed into 30 minutes episodes.  It was a good guys vs. bad guys series and very enjoyable.",1383091200,21,673,4.566666666666666
5838957,4,B00DOZNIVG,I have only 12 really bad copies of this gem.  It's owned by Via com.  Could someone please release the 39 episodes of this historical treasure.  How I loved it as a child.  Tod Andrews deserves remembering.,1382486400,,207,4.513513513513513
5838958,4,B00DOZNIVG,Missed seeing this when I was young but saw many of the other westerns of the day.  This still holds up well as entertainment for the boomers.,1382313600,,142,4.2592592592592595
5838959,5,B00DOZNIVG,"Ziv produced many 50's classic syndicated shows like Sea Hunt, Bat Masterson, I Led 3 Lives and Tombstone Territory. Mackenzies Raiders ran for only one season, unlike the others mentioned, and therefore with only 39 episodes produced disappeared from ""re-run heaven"" until this release. Colonel Mackenzie, played by Richard Carlson, is a very strong willed man, similar to Marshal Dillon. The ""raiders"" are his group of soldiers who are forbidden from crossing the Rio Grande despite regular attacks from renegade Indians and Outlaws. If caught, Mackenzie and his raiders would face a court martial. This premise would re-appear in the 60's in Mission Impossible, obviously to a greater degree of TV success. However, do not dismiss this show as the quality of scripts and acting is top notch. On a scale of 1-10 it would be rated by myself as a 8/9. I have no idea why it was only on for one season, perhaps Ziv was overloaded with all the other series it was producing, but lost as it may have been it is here now and I urge anyone to check it out!
Timeless has released so many great 50's oaters like Restless Gun/ The Texan/ Destry/ Riverboat/ Tales of Wells Fargo and Tombstone Territory. As fans of this genre we must support this company with our wallets and that way they can continue to issue more [ please, more Tombstone seasons 2 and 3?]",1382313600,51,1350,4.70042194092827
5838960,5,B00DOZNIVG,I purchased this for my husband. It is a wonderful series--we ration ourselves to watch only two or four 30 minute shows. Wish I could find more like this one.,1381881600,10,159,4.333333333333333
5838961,5,B00DOZNIVG,"I am very impressed with Timeless Media....making the ZIV series available to we fans in what has been so far Bat Masterson,Highway Patrol,Sea Hunt,Ripcord etc with quality that is second to none. Looking forward to more of these releases",1376956800,26,238,5.128205128205129

5838995,5,B00DOZNIVG,This is not the run of the mill T.V. series from the fifties. It has plenty of action decent stories and a good actor for a lead(Richard Carlson one of my personal favorites)plus it has been cleaned up and the image looks sharp and clear. I hope they release more classic but little known T.V. series with this level of restoration,1447804800,2,331,4.442622950819672

5839013,3,B00DOZNIVG,"Fairly good acting, but uninspired story lines and drab scenery and mediocre camera work.  Series was only on for one season.  Has some curio value as well as historical value (although the real Ranald McKenzie -- ""Bad Hand"" --  was nothing like Richard Carlson's character).",1429920000,,275,5.066666666666666
5839014,5,B00DOZNIVG,"American cavalry to make unauthorized raids into Mexico meant risking international incident,  but the battle wise Mackenzie routinely went across the border to inflict punishment on bandidos, gun runners, and renegade Apaches who raided on American soil then crossed the Rio Grande into Mexico seeking safety.  But, if he or his troops got caught,  our government would disown him.  Mackenzies forays into Mexico soon
made the outlaws think twice about raiding in Texas.",1427328000,,471,5.410958904109589

5839067,3,B00DOZNIVG,"The product, quality, price and packaging is excellent.  The series itself stars Richard Carlson as on of the commanding officer of a cavalry detachment in the Old West.  They are secretly authorized to cross the border with Mexico and pursue bandits, criminals and renegade Indians.  I love old black and white western series, but Richard Carlson's character reminds me of all of the overbearing and self-righteous bosses I ever had.  His role really is really a know it all hero who somehow never loses.  Add to that the fact he has virtually zero cast interaction, banter or support.  A bizarre thing is their mission is top secret but they wear their uniforms when crossing into Mexico.  The early 1950's narration is used in every episode too which I can take or leave.  Good to see early shows, but this might be the first black and white western I did not like.",1400976000,,868,4.701986754966887
5839068,5,B00DOZNIVG,Great quality on the DVDs and brings back those pleasant memories of growing up during the 50's and 60's. A great series for those who enjoy television westerns. We could only receive two TV channels but what quality and entertaining programs were broadcast during this time period. My wife and I are thrilled that Mackenzie's Raiders is finally on DVD and are enjoying each episode.,1398470400,,383,4.907692307692308

5839082,5,B00DOZNIVG,"Waited a long time for this series to become available. Having seen only a few episodes I considered this series a must-have.

5839084,5,B00DOZNIVG,"I remember watching this series in syndication as a kid in the late 1950s or early 60s. Around that time I always purchased copies of TRUE WEST, FRONTIER TIMES and REAL WEST magazines from the local drugstore (along with comics and monster magazines) and those magazines were often featuring stories/articles about Col. Ranald Mackenzie and his raiders and I remember just sucking it all in, as this was my favorite television show for at least a year or so.
Now, my recall of actual episodes is non-existent but the images remained alive as I popped in the dvd and enjoyed. Richard Carlson was more memorable to me for his sci-fi/horror movies and I had forgotten that he headlined the series as Mackenzie. I won't go into plot detail for the series except to state as others before have that this series looks just FANTASTIC, crisp and clear, and that you should buy this product without hesitation. I wasn't even sure that I needed to chime in anything about this series, except that...
The first episode reminded me a lot of Sam Peckinpah's feature MAJOR DUNDEE, in which a troop of cavalry illegally crosses the Rio Grande and carries out their agenda with no government backing. MACKENZIE'S RAIDERS then seems to be perhaps a blueprint for MAJOR DUNDEE,...or is this just me daydreaming.
...psssst, both stories feature a trooper Ryan, the massacre of a family and a night time ambush.",1390694400,15,1391,4.824267782426778
5839085,4,B00DOZNIVG,As far as TV Western's go this series is okay considering they were made with small budgets and filmed in black and white I enjoyed watching many year ago and still do now,1390089600,,171,4.212121212121212
5839086,5,B00DOZNIVG,"I now have a great collection of 1950s and 1960s westerns.  As a kid growing up in Australia we got a few of these (Gunsmoke, Laramie, Rawhide, Maverick, Wagon Train and quite a few others), but I don't recall this one being shown.  While Colonel Mackenzie actually existed and served in the South West at a lower rank than he did during the Civil War, the narrator in the show claims historical accuracy when in fact it seriously historically fact-impaired.  But the stories are enjoyable and the DVD transfer excellent.  It is a shame that one episode of this series cannot be found to transfer to the DVD format.",1389830400,2,615,4.614678899082569

8595529,3,B00DOZNIVG,"The first disc was defective. It stalled on the 4th episode about 6 minutes into the episode and would not rewind or move forward. It took me awhile to find that, by restarting the episode and using my next chapter button, and then slowly moving backwards from there to about the 7 minute mark, I could continue the episode. There was no flaw on the disk that I could see so it must have occured during the copy process. None of the other discs had issues.
The only other reason for just 3 stars is the overly violent scenes in most stories. It is definitely not for very young folks. Granted, westerns in the genre have shootouts and the like, but the soldiers not only shot the bad guys, but often shot many times into the bad guys after they looked to be fatally wounded and no longer held a weapon. Even when using the bowie knife they carried, the stabbing often looked manic, especially when it was Mackenzie fighting his foe.
With this in mind, I would screen the series before letting young kids see it.",1461196800,,1011,4.411764705882353
