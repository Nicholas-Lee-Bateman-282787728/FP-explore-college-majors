Total bummer and I, instead, got to teach my kids that this is not the sort of show we watch.  All about the intrigue, personalities, personal sin and general ""Catholic Church is always up to something a little shady"" attitude. Blah.

Main problem: Didn't seem to be heading into anything about the engineering aspects of the cathedral.

Secondary problem: Really didn't appreciate the sly/snarky tone.",1453420800,3,616,5.0594059405940595
8199289,3,B000R7I4AO,"When I picked up the dvd from the library I was expecting for the show to dig into the real engineering that went on behind the Colosseum, the Pyramid at Giza, and Chartres cathedral, but instead the series focused a lot more on the history and intrigue with a dash of architecture thrown in. There was very little actual engineering explained, which was disappointing. It was still enjoyable however, but totally softcore on the math and architecture behind the monuments.",1313884800,8,473,4.925
8199290,5,B000R7I4AO,"I'm not going off into a diatribe regarding this video series, only to say it gives you the information it says it does. Some a bit long-winded but that's what you get in a television program nowadays. Worth the price of admission.",1312675200,,231,4.523809523809524
