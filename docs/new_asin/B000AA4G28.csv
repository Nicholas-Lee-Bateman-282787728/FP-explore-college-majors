The execution of these two artists with two instruments, no overdiving just pure music, acoustic piano and guitar. I can only describe this recording as: ""The brasilian music taken to the upper limits of gods creation"".",1206316800,,412,4.885714285714286
8365517,5,B000AA4G28,"When I was in Brasil two years ago my friend suggested that I buy this DVD...I did and it was OUTSTANDING.  There are only five stars to give...if I had my way it deserves ten or more.  Cesar Camargo Mariano is the consement Brasilian pianist; most likely the most technically perfect Bossa Nova pianist I have ever heard.  Romero Lubambo makes love with and to his guitar...the two of them sound as one.  Of particular note is the expression on Romero's face as he begins Fotografia""; it's like he has discovered new chords for the first time.  I would recommend this CD to anyone at any time.",1198886400,,594,4.514018691588785
