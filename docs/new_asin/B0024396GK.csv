A director is supposed enhanse the creator's vision-not steal it.  I won't be buying the rest of this dreadful ring cycle.",1342051200,,246,4.674418604651163
8350248,1,B0024396GK,"To endure watching this half-baked piece of dreck from the land of Hamlet, no less!

Another Eurotrash concept for bored musical illiterates out there...

First, the music.  Conductor Schonwandt leads a sloppy, erratic performance. Often much too fast for the poor singers who struggle just to get all their words out. The first occurrence of the Giants motif is taken so fast, it might as well be a country gig, certainly not ""firmly measured"" like the composer indicated. (The short sixteenth notes almost sound double-dotted at this unreasonable speed). From the singers, the best impression vocally is the lovely voice of the Wotan,  Johan Reuter. The rest are not much to write home about, and the top Rheinmaiden is just dreadful. Erda seems to have a fine voice, but the conductor merely had her sing mezzo voce with no support. What was the point of that?

But, by today's standards, these vocal forces might not be the deal breaker. That odious honor belongs to the Director. Kaspar Bech Holten was 36 years old at the time of this Copenhagen Ring, and judging by these videos, it is a pity he was ever allowed out of the sandbox.

I am truly saddened when I read viewers praising how these type of productions stimulate them and bring so much more insight and sensitivity than those hackneyed stagings of yesteryear etc etc etc.... I am saddened because these people are running away from encountering the music drama on its own terms, and the only way they will attend the opera house is if there is something controversial, shocking, or modernized. They trivialize the Ring by pasting on torturous symbols, equivalencies, hidden ""meanings"" by making it more ""relevant"" for us. At least, that is their stated purpose.

But to put it briefly, what the audience will come away with is not a deeper insight into Wagner and his music, but rather an undesired glimpse into the neurotic fetishes of the Directors.

Equally depressing, there are countless disconnects between music and ""concept"".

For example... Loge is the god of Fire, mercurial, brilliant, clever, mischievous. Wagner's music is quick-silver, constantly in motion with shimmering chromatic movement. How does that square with Copenhagen's dour-faced Loge, who gets bogged down with always scribbling down notes (hmnn, must be not too bright?) and constantly chain-smoking. The armchair intellectuals will say ""ah, he smokes because he is the god of Fire. I've made a connection. How clever!""  Well, I was just waiting for the god of Fire to keel over in a coughing  and retching fit. Unwarranted and idiotic as the killing of Loge by Wotan was in the last scene, I admit I secretly enjoyed it because watching him smirk and scowl through the whole show made me want to throttle him myself.

Wotan... all powerful king of the gods?? Wotan, who in Die Walkre kills Hunding with a contemptuous wave of his hand, here indulging in sadistic high school sport of burning his cigarette into the neck of the enchained Alberich? How regal is that? And pray tell, just what ""interesting"" does it tell you about Wotan's character? Also, to show Wotan on all fours selfishly gnawing on an apple is just distasteful and comical. No wonder Wagner did not indicate anything like that in his specific stage directions.  If the Director and his admiring sheep want to play at opera, go ahead and write your own. Don't mess with genius.

(Tell me, how many aficionados of Mozart were out there in the general population before trendy ""Amadeus"" pictured him as a vulgar buffoon? Do we really need to have genius brought down to the mob level before we will listen?)

What does it really tell us to see Wotan pull Alberichs' pants down, or to see the buck-naked swimmer as the Rheingold in the first scene... except maybe some wish fulfillment on the part of Kaspar Bech Holten?

The three powerful scene interludes go for nothing as we are forced to watch the same intrusive and boring videos of Brnnhilde thumbing through all those books in Wotan's library. (She is ""Wotan's Wille"" after all, she knows all Wotan's innermost thoughts and desires. Why on earth would she need to do research in a celestial Bibliotheca?) Non-existent is the primal thrill of the Rhein prelude building by wave and wave... gone is the terror of the Descent into Nibelheim and the later Ascent to Valhalla. When the ensemble of anvils occurs, it makes a pitiful impression like tinkling Jingle Bells.

I am a professional conductor and have encountered too much of this crap, especially in Germany. I once suggested to a Stage Director let's have a moratorium on all your ""concept""-driven stagings and instead allow conductors to substitute violins with synthesizers, and other instruments with bass guitars etc, and let's reverse all the tempos. She was not amused.

And then there is the irritating high school level of directing where the characters not singing are mouthing some other conversations to each other. I suppose this was to lend ""verisimilitude"" like they sing in Gilbert and Sullivan. What a poverty of imagination and resorting to common effects. Ugh! how amateurish.

If you would like to see how an intelligent approach can unite a vibrant, creative presentation and still keep true to Wagner and his music, try the Met's LaPage Ring or the Mehta Valencia Ring. Light years better than this turkey from Copenhagen.

Leave this tortured abortion of Teutonic ""intellectualismus"" to gather dust on the shelf where it belongs. This emperor has no clothes.",1341014400,4,5506,4.931891891891892
8350249,5,B0024396GK,"n a world where opera companies fall over themselves to stage Wagner's four-part Der Ring des Nibelungen, it is rare to see a new production that actually has something valid to say. If this  Das Rheingold (filmed at the Royal Danish Opera in 2006) is any indication, director Kasper Bech Holten may have accomplished this difficult feat with his Copenhagen Ring, available on DVD from Decca. He stands on the shoulders of directors who have come before (particularly Patrice Chreau and Harry Kupfer) but fuses these theatrical ideas into a new, exciting whole to make an impressive start to this Ring.

Holten stages the ""preliminary evening"" of the Ring as an extended flashback, framed by Brunnhilde (Irne Thorin) going through the old Valhalla family albums in a dusty attic. She discovers that her father was a vicious, sadistic murderer who would stop at nothing to pursue power. This of course is Wotan, played by resonant bass-baritone Johan Reuter. It is his quest for the Ring, and his cruel treatment of Alberich (Sten Byriel) that stands at the bloody heart of this production.

For his part, Mr. Byriel's Alberich is the best performance here. The dwarf is re-imagined as a disfigured, doddering old family uncle, drinking alcohol in a pool with three flapping floozies--the Rhinemaidens. He sings with a fine, dark baritone, never resorting to growls or barks in place of singing. The Rhinegold is portrayed by a studly young swimmer (Danny Olsen) whose heart is literally torn out to forge the Ring--a process that leaves Alberich with deep burn marks on his arm.

Scene II finds Wagner's gods bivouacked in tents, surrounded by suitcases. Fasolt and Fafner are two blue-collar builders (with Fafner (Christian Christiansen) confined to a wheelchair, probably due to some Valhalla-related industrial accident) with a genuine beef with a boss who doesn't want to fork over their ""wage."" The production plays up the sexual attraction between Freia (Anne Margrethe Dahl) and Fasolt, (Stephen Milling), with the nature goddess toying with the burly worker. Mr. Reuter's Wotan has the whiff of an African explorer who just got back from a blood-drenched safari on the dark continent.

The idea of Wotan mutilating Alberich to get the Ring started in 1976 at Bayreuth, when Mr.  Chreau introduced the idea in his ""Centenary"" staging of the Ring cycle. Mr. Holten ups the gore factor, staging Wotan and Loge's theft of the Ring, Tarnhelm and Rhinegold in a white-tiled torture chamber worthy of the Saw movies. Alberich is tied and spread-eagled. Wotan literally takes a carving knife and hacks off his arm, leaving the bloody stump dangling and covering himself in blood. This is powerful and disturbing stuff.

Loge (the excellent Michael Kristensen) is a chain-smoking hard-drinking newspaperman, the only one of the Gods willing to work for a living. Small wonder then that the whole tragedy ends with his murder by Wotan. (He's seen too much.) Mr. Reuter and Mr. Kristensen made this final killing an epitaph for this dark, brilliant Rheingold all the more chilling because it was casually and cruelly done. As his body slumps to the stage, the Gods rise on a scaffolding, up their new skyscraper. Again, this is a borrowed idea, but in this context it works very well.",1297468800,7,3282,5.033149171270718
