4934942,5,B006363QHE,"During the 1970's, CBS created a golden age of great comedy.  Among them was the ""Carol Burnett Show"", ""Bob Newhart Show"", ""MASH"", and the groundbreaking ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"".  This series centered around a single young woman who becomes producer of the news at a Minneapolis television station.

The ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" was different from its predecessors because it portrayed a thirtyish woman who is smart, capable, independent, and happy being single.  The episodes spent as much time examining Mary in the workplace as they did chronicling her social life.

The quality of writing for the ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" was consistently intelligent, mature, and funny without being crude or condescending to audiences.

The characters on MTM were so richly developed by the writers and a brilliant acting ensemble that audiences could see them as real people, not one-dimensional caricatures.  You came to love and understand them:  Mary Richards, intelligent and vivacious, generous, and level-headed.  Lou Grant, Mary's boss, gruff yet fair.  Ted Baxter, anchorman, vain and self-absorbed, but also childlike and vulnerable.  Murray Slaughter, Mary's supportive co-worker and foil to Ted Baxter.  Rhoda Morgenstern, Mary's sarcastic and street-wise best friend who has a soft heart.  And Phyllis Lindstrom, Mary's highly educated old friend who can act pretentious but means well.

You really wanted to know and root for the people in Mary's life despite their flaws.  They must have had something going for them if Mary cared about them.

And regarding Mary Tyler Moore herself, she is one of the most beautiful and talented actresses to ever grace television.  Her comedic timing and instincts are almost peerless.  (To me, only Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett, Candice Bergen, and the casts of ""The Golden Girls"" and ""Designing Women"" could match Mary's skill.)  But the quality that shines most about this genuine legend and star is her humanity.  You just sense that Mary Richards/Mary Tyler Moore is a good person.  She is kind and respectful, and in turn we respect her.

It is lamentable that most current ""comedies"" are tasteless exhibitions of people's worst behavior.  The ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" offers us a more noble and enlightened view of human nature while still acknowledging our frailties.  And in the process, this landmark series made us laugh, cry, and think.  What more is there?",1334275200,73,2405,5.232984293193717

4934950,5,B006363QHE,"How can you NOT buy this set? I'm hard to please...this pleased me. One small warning--I lived through the 1970s but was not prepared for the visual shock of seeing Rhoda's GROOOOVY apartment and Mary's bellbottom pant suit. Even if you don't like the situational humor (and how could you not?) you'll be laughing at the way people dressed. Yes, seriously.",1501027200,3,356,4.852459016393443

4934952,1,B006363QHE,"I am VERY disappointed with this purchase!  I received the DVDs and I didn't put them in to watch them as soon as I received them because of our DVD player not working .  When I finally received our new player (the 2nd one...1st one didn't work) and played the first DVD it would not load.  The 2nd DVD loaded but then I discovered you have to play EACH show separately, meaning I can't leave the DVD in to play all shows without stopping.  I haven't ever had DVDs where I was forced to sit and watch ONE by ONE.  Such a POOR design!  And the show is not as clear as my I LOVE LUCY DVD collection which I have had for YEARS and it STILL is clear.  I am working on getting a refund, and at this time was told it was too late.  I will try again to receive a refund.  If I do, I will write again...I will not be able to give the DVDs any higher of a rating...but I will be happier with the company I purchased them from!",1499644800,6,917,3.9135135135135135

4934963,4,B006363QHE,"Review of seasons 1-7.  I have seen all the shows,  since I grew up with this show.  I have not watched all the dvds.  Just finished season 4.  I am kind of wondering tho.  Why was this called the Mary Tyler Moore Show?  The character Ted Baxter is the only one who gets to talk.......on and on and on and on ....................  A little bit of Ted Baxter  is ok,  but too much is too much.  His monotone droning voice is mostly annoying.  A better title would have been,  Ted Baxter and others.  Thank the creators for the fast forward button.  Same thing they did to The Big Bang show,  Seriously  I don't know why they just don't call it  ""That Sheldon Show""  but anyway.............................. Sorry I got off track there.  I'm not saying the show is bad.  I enjoy the non-ted parts.  Mary is so talented.  Luckily her talent can make you forget about the ted rambles.  The show is so much better than most anything on today.  After watching many episodes in a row without commercials,  It just doesn't seem like Mary has much to do but react to everyone else.",1490832000,,1072,4.424870466321243

I know I should contact the seller,  but since this is for all 7 seasons I just let it go....My fault. And my loss. Each season case is divided into 3 discs. I was also disappointed that there is no case for Them all- each season is in one case and they came taped together.usually this type set comes in a case to store them all together. I have each season's disc (7) temporarily in a small shopping bag.
. Other than that, each season was sealed in  cellophane very  nicely. A wonderful set of fabulously packaged memories!",1489795200,4,652,4.436974789915967

One previous review indicates that there were some problems and I am hoping that is not the case for the discs I have received. The first disc seems fine and I enjoyed watching the shows again. The packaging, however, is absolutely terrible. The seven cases (one for each season) were held together with cellophane and sticky tape. The plastic cases for each season were very difficult to unwrap with more cellophane and more sticky tape. Worst of all, the cases themselves were flimsy and several were completely broken. I hope the discs have not been scratched.",1485043200,3,664,4.833333333333333

4934986,2,B006363QHE,"Well, I have to say of all the 1970s shows I have purchase this is the worse quality I have ever seen. Yes, even if the source used was video tape, which I am not sure it was not. Blurry picture with ghosting effect, and pixilation artifacts on some fast movement scenes. This occurred on all First Season and Fifth Season, with the same ghosting and pixilation. I even tested on an old Daewoo crt flat screen, adjusting the sharpness to try to blend out the ghosting, to no avail.  I usually do no return DVD series or DVDs in general if there are a couple of episodes freezing or skipping. Some DvDs improve on my Daewoo crt tv, which did not occur with this series.

I have only watched the first two seasons though and am now taking a break to watch my usual July movies.  The way that Mary's home life and her work life are blended together in this series is very nice.

I would give this an unconditional ""buy"" (bought on an Amazon sale.)  But be forewarned, on the first few series, you have to go through a very annoying process to play each episode.  There is no ""play all"" option.  Seems like a fix that surely could be cured with today's technology.  Because of this, I took away a star.

I have to say, not yet having made it through all the seasons and despite enduring the technology annoyances of the first few seasons -- this set has already provided a great many laughs to many.",1404691200,6,781,4.535714285714286

This DVD collection was advertised as new when I had purchased it on Amazon but when I had gotten it in the mail, the DVD cover for Season 2 was damaged. The plastic piece that holds all of the DVD's in place was broken and all of the discs in Season 2 were loose, as a result. Also, the side of the box that holds Season 2 was damaged and one of the discs in Season 2 was scratched. Perhaps, I am anal but if I but something that is advertised as new, I expect it to be in mint condition.

There is a 90 min documentary on one disk that details the making/production of the show which is neat, giving you a peek behind the scenes.

4935060,5,B006363QHE,"I was delighted to see this series come available for such a good price. I have many fond memories of watching this show with my parents years ago. It is difficult to overestimate the influence the show had and still has - I think it did a lot to change society's attitude toward women by portraying Mary as such a strong, independent person. Compared to other shows in its day, it was groundbreaking and paved the way for many shows which have imitated but not duplicated its formula. With an absolutely fabulous ensemble cast this show is still great today.

But, if you are reading this review you already know what a great series this is so I won't waste any more words there. I mainly wanted to write this review to convey picture quality to those interested in the set.

After reading some early reviews noting the picture is grainy I immediately opened up my just-arrived pack. Each season is in a separate holder. So far, I've looked at several episodes and it looks good. The film when transferred was pretty clean, occasional spots are noted but nothing that most people will see unless looking for it. This is a DVD (not Blu-Ray) so of course it is not HD but it upscales well and looks fine on an HD TV. In short, I think it is a good transfer and makes the series look as good or better than I have ever seen it on broadcast TV.

In summary, you should not let any concern about picture quality make you hesitate from buying this classic series. I doubt that a Blu-Ray version of this will ever be made and even if it was I don't think the show would benefit from it. Buy with confidence and enjoy it from the first awkward meeting with Mr. Grant to the final moving group hug!",1377907200,50,1690,4.375796178343949
4935061,5,B006363QHE,"The Mary Tyler Moore Show is outstanding.  That goes without saying.  You probably think so too, otherwise you wouldn't be looking at this listing.
To get all 7 seasons, on DVD, in good packaging is just icing on the cake.  Each season is in an individual case, with all of the DVDs for that season in it.  The cases are durable plastic and the disks are held firmly inside in sort of an alternating layout so they don't take up so much room with the artwork you see in the listing photo.
I am just half way through the first disk.  The picture is clear, and the color is vibrant and sharp.  But, of course, we are talking about 70's TV.  There are special features and a few commentaries (although there might be more later), but honestly having the show itself is enough for me.
To see Mary and all the gang again is so awesome.  The comedy from that time is so funny and always makes me feel good.  Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, MTM, Maude are all so good and so much, much better than watching yet another season of ""Two and a half dreks"" or ""Southpark"".  If Amazon released those other shows like this one, I would buy them in a heartbeat.

Quick! Snap this up! $66.00 for all 7 seasons!!!!",1377734400,11,1193,4.304932735426009
4935062,4,B006363QHE,"As is to be expected this show is still fantastic, unfortunately fox couldn't be bothered to put any effort into creating these DVDs, particularly after the second season

Pros-

- This package has every episode ever
- The episodes do not appear to be edited versions
- When you buy this you will be able to watch the episode where chuckles dies anytime you want
- You stand to get a good discount on the bundle (each season costs about 15 dollars each if bought separately)
- Includes bonus features, most of which were put together in relation to the early seasons.

Cons

- Fox did nothing to make these DVDs special
- The video quality hasn't been touched everything is still very grainy
- This is just an amazon repackaging of the original DVDs so don't expect anything new or fancy that you didn't get before
- This set doesn't even come with episode lists until season 6
- Special features and content stops mostly after first two seasons
(This last bit was initially a big deal to me as I have become bitter over fox eventually abandoning this series but many other commenters have noted that there is more than enough present in the early seasons. It is up to you to decide if this matters)

------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: After much discussion in the comment section I would like to clear something up. I originally had an oversight in my review that there were no special features. I was in correct and changed my review. I had a clear statement in the comments explaining this. After a few more comments I have decided to bring this forward to the main review.

There are features that came packed in with the first two seasons. After those two seasons there was limited additional special features. That information is actually comprehensive and I am sorry that my first review was inaccurate.

On my end these original seasons were watched as they came out and I would say that I became a jaded viewer when seeing fox not add any more content. Over the years as a customer it becomes more and more depressing to have to wait for more releases. At one point they stopped releasing individual seasons and just released the whole series as a single set. This would mean you were forced to rebuy seasons if you wanted to see the previously unreleased seasons.

Over the years fox seemed to abandon this DVD series and I guess my bitterness led to me writing an inaccurate review. I will be adjusting this and I am sorry to have allowed my bias to skew my review.

In fact, Mary was so witty, so classy and so smart, that none of her associates, superiors or even personal friends measured up, but they did not seem to mind.  There was the white stereotype male Murray, the Archie Bunker wanna be Lou Grant, and .... Ted (Thadeus) was the target of Polish jokes of the time.  The only normal person was Gordon, the weather man, who represented the African-American stereotype of the time.  Great show to watch, but it definitely had a social agenda with unfortunate consequences 40 years later.  Ted morphed into Joe Biden, Phylis became Nancy Pelosi, Rhoda's mother became Hillary and Gordon transformed into Nikki Haley.
