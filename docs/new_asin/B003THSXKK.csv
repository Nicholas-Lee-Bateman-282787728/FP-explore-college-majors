8405135,5,B003THSXKK,"My 6 year old granddaughter and 3 year grandson love all the Madeline dvds. All episodes on this dvd have a winter or holiday theme to them but dvd does not contain the actual ""Madeline's Christmas"" story. Adults enjoy watching as much as children. Christopher Plummer's narration is fabulous.",1389139200,3,293,5.0
8405136,5,B003THSXKK,"I remember watching Madeline when I was a child and I absolutely adored it - every second of it. In fact as I grew up and the episodes on the TV became scarce I never forgot the theme song to the show and often found myself humming along to it in my head. When I discovered that these DVD's's had been released I was very quick in purchasing each one I could find - not a huge amount - 8 separate DVD's with a varying amount of episodes but hell, even having just a few is more excitement than I intended of ever being able to find. I know I am no longer a child but I love the fact that if I ever have my own child that I will now be able to share apart of my childhood that made my day every day it aired on the TV. Even so with that in mind, I am still quite content to sit down and watch these DVD's, while now they seem quite childish to me, it definitely is a childish amount of love I am happy to endure.

8405137,5,B003THSXKK,Childhood favourite of Madeline the book series - had to get it for my little niece to enjoy. The smallest one was Madeline......,1383350400,,129,4.6521739130434785
8405138,5,B003THSXKK,"The only thing I do not understand is why the dvd is titled 'Madeline's Christmas' when the episode of the show that shares the same name is not actually on this dvd? Other than that, the episodes on it are great and appropriate/entertaining for all ages to enjoy. All have a winter or Holiday theme to them.",1373328000,2,308,4.421052631578948
