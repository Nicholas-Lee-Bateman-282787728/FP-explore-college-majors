3149160,5,B001608MGC,"As in Alfred Hitchcock's films, the suspense in Sam Zalusky's ""You Belong to Me"" stems from the psychological complexity of the characters.  There are no black and white heroes and villains here but complex human beings whose motivations and emotions ring true throughout the film, thanks to both the quality of the screenplay and the quality of the cast, especially the inspired Patti D'Arbanville.  The real source of horror in ""You Belong to Me"" is how in our increasingly alienating society, people's search for connection with each other can go horribly wrong.  And in this film, when things do go wrong, we shudder not just with fear but with recognition of our own human foibles.",1218326400,3,686,4.947826086956522

8260595,5,B001608MGC,"Sam Zalutsky sure knows his way around a movie camera! I was on the edge of my seat while watching this and guarantee that you will be, too. Totally creepy (and that is a compliment). If you are interested in obsession (and who isn't?) this movie is definitely for you.",1515715200,,269,4.4
8260596,5,B001608MGC,"Wonderful! I loved it. Beautiful cinematography, extremely creepy, the landlady's performance was one of the highlights for me. If you love Hitchcock, this is a great movie to watch, it's a well-done modern thriller, told in Hitchcock style. Great writing, excellent direction -- such high quality for a low budget indie film -- really exceeded my expectations.",1481414400,,361,5.350877192982456
8260597,3,B001608MGC,"""You Belong to Me"" suffers a bit from the lead character's imbecilic choices and fuzzy motivations.  Plot: Gay Jeffery, after a one night stand with another gent, becomes obsessed enough to follow this guy to his apartment building and rent (on the spot!) a vacant apartment there.  This impetuous (to say the least) behavior and it's ramifications are the bare threads of the story.  Jeffery foolishly steals a ring... Jeffery idiotically sneaks into another apartment uninvited...  Jeffery crashes a party in order to get close to the one-night-stand man who obviously wants nothing to do with Jeffery and his creepy behavior.

This makes Jeffery sound like the film's villian, but he is meant to be the hero.  If you can get beyond his obvious failings and accept his faults and ineptitude (at one point he is locked in a basement, but doesn't seem to try very hard to break out - even when puny boards nailed over a window easily bend as he pulls on them!), then perhaps you will enjoy this movie more then I.  Don't get me wrong.  I found much to enjoy here.  Otherwise I would not have given it so many stars.

On the plus side:  Patti D'Arbanville plays the aparment building's owner/landlady and she is a great treat.  Her rich performance is carried off with such aplomb and finesse that I've felt compelled to seek out her other roles.  And there are several scenes of fine tension and delicious suspense.  The acting is fine, the camera work is decent, the editing is actually quite good.  I am anxious to rewatch this with the director's commentary.

Unfortunately, the climax threatened to crumble into a French bedroom farce with characters running up and down corridors, yanking on doorknobs, hiding in rooms and slamming doors.",1390953600,,1743,4.818181818181818
8260598,4,B001608MGC,"Originally. I thought was a gay version of Fatal Attraction, but not quite. It certainly had some good scares, but another website made it look terrifying, but I've seen enough scary movies in my life, not so much for me. It was good though and I would highly recommend it, obviously, not everyone will like it, and I'm very aware of that.",1390348800,,339,4.483870967741935
8260599,2,B001608MGC,"This is a low buget movie, an ok storyline. Nothing to write home about. Its alright for watching one time. Wouldnt pay alot for this dvd.",1347148800,,138,4.346153846153846
8260600,3,B001608MGC,"This was definitely a refreshing film. It has an interesting plot, and I like the interaction between the lead character and his best friend.

Shortly into the movie, the protagonist takes an apartment in a building so that he can be near a guy he desires. Unfortunately, the love is unrequited. After he moves into the building, things turn dramatically worse for him. Saying more, would give away the plot.

This part of the story is very suspenseful. The viewer is kept intrigued waiting to discover the motive of the people who are threatening the protagonist and to see how the conflict is resolved. So, after all of that wonderful build-up, the reason for the conflict and the resolution left me wanting more.

I totally ""get"" the reason for the conflict, but the actors involved did not portray ""insanity"" effectively to make that explanation credible. They were just too campy. Also, the resolution -- ""I'm here"" -- was way too short. It did not give this wonderful film the conclusion it deserved. I say - watch it, but I think you will like the run-up more than the finish.",1338163200,2,1083,4.71957671957672
8260601,5,B001608MGC,"Don't be fooled by the blurb from ""Variety"" that Wolfe Video has used to market the DVD release of ""You Belong to Me"".  That trade magazine claimed that this suspenseful thriller offers ""A gay spin ... on Polanski's The Tenant and Rosemary's Baby.""  This well-meaning ballyhoo serves only to arouse false expectations in the minds of viewers.  Yes, there are gay characters in the film, and yes, certain plot elements recall to mind aspects of Polanski's two classics ... as well as ""Psycho"", ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"", ""Fatal Attraction"" and other cinematic shockers.  However, such ham-fisted exploitation is hardly necessary, because ""You Belong to Me"" is both original enough and well-crafted enough to attract its own audience.

The main theme of this creepy film is obsession in all its forms, and the plot examines the ways that people who are obsessed can themselves become the victims of the same destructive behavior that they engage in.  Bouquets to filmmaker Sam Zalutsky, who wrote a tight script filled with believable characters and dialogue, and then brought his vision to fruition by directing and co-producing.  Roses also to Jonathan Furmanski's cinematography and Tamar Gadish's production design: together they create a claustrophobic atmosphere that oozes with menace and foreboding.  And of course, full credit is also deserved by a particularly talented and effective cast, led by Patti D'Arbanville and Daniel Sauli, both of whom shine in very demanding roles.

I approached ""You Belong To Me"" with moderate expectations, and was more than amply rewarded.  I jumped several times during the course of the film's 82 minute running time, and my attention never once wandered.  I can honestly say that I'm looking forward to watching it again and sharing it with some friends who I know will appreciate the skill with which it was made.  Highly recommended to fans of well-acted, cleverly crafted nail-biters ... a solid four and 1/2 stars.",1328054400,2,1970,5.17981072555205
8260602,5,B001608MGC,"""You Belong to Me"" is a super Hitchcockian thriller from director Sam Zalutsky.  Jeffrey (Daniel Sauli) is a young gay architect who becomes obsessed with Rene (Julien Lucas) a handsome one night stand who rebuffs his attempts to continue their relationship.  So obsessed is he, that Jeffrey follows Rene and, discovering where he lives, impulsively decides to rent an apartment in the same building, owned by landlady Gladys (Patti D'Arbanville).

Once he moves in he finds himself becoming in turn the object of obsession of the strange landlady. Mysteries abound in the building.  Why does Gladys take such an interest in her new tenant?  Why did the former tenant of his apartment (who also happened to be named Jeffrey) disappear so suddenly, leaving his belongings behind?  Who is the creepy handyman who peers through the apartment windows?  And most of all, what are the strange groans coming from the apartment below Jeffrey's?

As our hero tries to unravel the mysteries he finds himself plunged into a terrifying nightmare which threatens his sanity and his very life.

Sometimes funny, often down right frightening, the movie spins along at a rapid pace, giving the viewer little time to pause and catch his breath.  The ending sequences are superb.

The standout performance belongs to D'Arbanville, who is the epitome of creepiness. Sauli is fine as Jeffrey.  The only weak performance (and the weakest link in the whole movie) is given by Lucas, whose bland character makes it difficult to appreciate Jeffrey's obsession.

Is the story improbable?  Absolutely!  But then, the stories behind most thrillers are.  These things, after all, don't happen to people everyday.  If the viewer can suspend disbelief and just go along for the ride, he will be rewarded with 82 minutes of enjoyable suspense!",1310860800,,1812,5.108843537414966

8260604,2,B001608MGC,"""Variety"" magazine hailed Sam Zalutsky's brief 82 minute thriller as ""A Gay Spin on...Polanski's ""The Tenant"" and ""Rosemary's Baby."" HARDLY!!!! Talk about false advertising!!!! The movie has nothing to do with being gay... except for the fact that the main character Jeffrey (Daniel Sauli) is gay and smitten with his one night stand Rene, who barely acknowledges him. Jeffrey, along with his trusty dog Max, moves into Rene's apartment building. So you might think the film will be about Jeffrey's obsession with Rene; but Rene is less than secondary to the plot. Jeffrey hears strange moaning coming from beneath the floor boards in his new apartment. Landlady Gladys (Patti D'Arbanville) turns out to be the obsessed one, but calling the film ""Psychotic Landlady"" would have been too obvious. The film does achieve some degree of claustraphobic tension, but it all boils down to a case of ""been there, seen this"" and I've seen this done much better.  I did care if the dog Max survives all the ""psycho inmates are running the asylum"" goings-on, though. But the human characters are rather dull and one-note.",1219017600,2,1110,5.032608695652174
