8218239,4,B000VD5HV8,"This dvd is loaded with information about a rough time in American History.  FDR is seen as the hero as he institutes different programs to get Americans back to work.  His helping individual Americans is seen as successful, whereas President Hoover's attempt to help Americans by starting at the top to stimulate businesses, is not.  FDR used the media - specifically radio - with his ""fireside chats"" to connect with Americans.  This dvd discusses the start of the Social Security Administration, the FDIC, labor unions, and what some labeled FDR's ""alphabet soup"".  It ultimately says the end of the depression was our entrance into World War II after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the war production booms.  The one thing I had issues with is that the chapter breaks aren't necessarily in synch with the subjects - some are in the middle of subjects. This dvd is appropriate for middle and high schoolers.",1204156800,17,911,4.883116883116883
