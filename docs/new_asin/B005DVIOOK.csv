4662760,5,B005DVIOOK,"Charles Kuralt claimed he did not have the look of a TV anchorman but that there was an advantage to being ""fat and bald"" when you were on the road. A pig farmer from Illinois might be nervous before a television camera but one look at Kuralt would assure him that he could relax and be himself. Charles Kuralt was not only fat and bald, he was humble as well. Kuralt had a tremendous gift for noticing things most of us don't notice. He understood what those 'unnoticed stories' implied about America and it's people. He also had an unrivaled talent as a writer and then he could convey what he wrote to an audience with genuineness and warmth. Frankly, I can't think of an anchorman that has ever matched his abilities.

This DVD set brings together three previous sets into one and my only regret is that there are, as far as I know, no extras included. I hate having to buy a new set to get a bit of bonus material but I wish there was more in this case.

Kuralt's final and most important gift is that after we have watched him, we learn to be more like him. We are more careful observers, more appreciative of America and it's people and more apt to slow down and notice everyday greatness. Thanks Charles.

(PS- If the producers of this set ever want to release more material from Kuralt's long and varied career you will sell a set or two to me).",1317686400,30,1354,4.322834645669292
4662761,5,B005DVIOOK,"CHARLES KURALT and his ON THE ROAD ""lifetime achievement"" is, simply put, pure fun. The best way to describe ""ON THE ROAD WITH CHARLES KURALT"" is repeating the title. For those who remember watching the segments on CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, this is nostalgia at its peak. For those too young or anyone who somehow missed all of the weekly segments over the 20 years, this is a slice of perhaps the best reporting ever broadcast on TV. It is nostalgic in segments from early days because of the dress of the Americans interviewed. The 20 year span is as timeless as the stories he found along the by-ways of Americana. The common man's poet.

Kuralt and team wore out six motor homes over the years beginning in 1967, when CBS gave Kuralt a 3-month ""trial"" of his ""On the Road"" journalism idea. Only the reporter's death would end the famous and enjoyable good-news segment weekly awaited upon by millions of Americans. It helps one forget troubles and simply enjoy moments in America that are centered on ordinary people

It is funny at times because of the oddity that is being reported or the way Kuralt has of presenting it. It is often quite heart-warming, touching, and home-spun. It is, upon occasion, patriotic, not political--there is a huge difference and Kuralt knew it. Sometimes it shares a life-time achievement of an individual that made a difference only in his/her own neighborhood, never flashy stars. Athletic achievement is in the form of people, like the 104 year old man who out ran almost everybody in town, including Kuralt when he visited. Amazing at time. Historical at others. Surprising. Challenging. Intellectual once in a while and informative always. A reviewer could come up with a superlative for every segment of every episode. Let's just leave it as history has done and simply say this set is ""On the Road with Charles Kuralt.""

4662812,5,B005DVIOOK,"This is a true American classic, the likes of which doesn't show up much in the world of television today, more's the pity. It celebrates the seemingly mundane aspects of ""everyday"" America with wit, charm, and and empathy. Charles Kuralt was one of the vanishing number of superior American journalists, keeping company with Edward R. Murrow, Erik Severeid, and Walter Cronkiet. In my opinion, Kuralt was the most personable of the group and had an old-fashioned charm and gentleness that is absent in current American, and possibly world, journalism. If you want to mellow out and appreciate America of a by-gone era, watch these episodes. Human interest journalism is lacking in today's broadcast news; this will make you appreciate it, and mourn its absence.",1445472000,2,762,5.153225806451613

4662817,5,B005DVIOOK,"I would recommend this dvd set to anyone who loves Americana. Charles Kuralt was a great storyteller and a great history teacher. His story from
Constitution Hall in Philadelphia about the debate leading to the adoption of The Declaration of Independance was superb. He had the knack of telling his stories with just the right blend of humor,compassion and patriotism. Don Hewitt,longtime executive producer of 60 Minutes, said
all news reporting is telling a story and no one told stories better than Charles Kuralt.",1429401600,4,517,5.166666666666667

So far we've watched one disk and really enjoyed the episodes on it.  My husband calls them video time capsules.  We watched these episodes as kids with our parents and its so nice to be able to watch them again.  Want to share them with our son so he can see how things were and in many cases still are in America.,1325808000,4,491,4.11578947368421

4662841,5,B005DVIOOK,"As far as I am concerned he had the best job in America. From 1967 to 1988 CBS News correspondent Charles Kuralt and his cameraman Isadore Bleckman criss-crossed the highways and byways of America in a motor home in search of fascinating people, captivating places and unique events. Sometimes they would get a tip from a viewer but more often than not they would just stumble upon a story themselves as they scoured the back roads eager to discover for themselves ""what's around the bend"". When the series concluded in 1989 CBS News released a three tape VHS collection called ""On The Road with Charles Kuralt"". My wife purchased it for me for my birthday. I always said it was one of the best things I owned. Now in 2011 Acorn Media has assembled an amazing 9 disc set entitled ""On The Road with Charles Kuralt: The Americana Collection"" featuring more than 200 segments that were featured on the CBS Evening News. This collection features just about all of the segments from my old VHS collection and a heck of a lot more. What a find!

As you might expect ""On The Road with Charles Kuralt: The Americana Collection"" features a bevy of unforgettable people. You will meet the 104 year old man in San Francisco who had been jogging every day since he was 9 years old. Kuralt attempts an interview while running alongside of him but in a mere matter of moments the elderly gentlemen leaves Charles in the dust. ""Humiliated by a 104 year old man"" is the way Charles described it. Simply hilarious! Then there is the incredible story that was filed from North Platte, NE about how the people of North Platte and the surrounding towns offered a hot meal and a piece of pie to the troops heading out on the troop trains during World War II. This labor of love went on every single day for several years. You will meet two of the ladies who were involved. One of my favorite stories was of the Iowa farmer who dreamed of sailing around the world. He made his dream come true by building a yacht in his barn! Talk about American ingenuity! Then there is the man and wife who gave up a comfortable life in the city and moved to a secluded area in deep in the woods of Northern Minnesota and built birch canoes from scratch for a living. These canoes were literally works of art and if I am not mistaken Charles Kuralt bought the last one this man ever made. So many interesting people and the list goes on and on......

Over the years ""On The Road"" featured numerous stories from just about every state in the nation. From here in my home state of Rhode Island Kuralt tells the story of the founding of the First Baptist Church in America in Providence by Roger Williams in 1638. You will travel to a small town in Vermont whose residents still made major budgetary and policy decisions at an old-fashioned day long town meeting in the dead of winter. You sure get the feeling that this is the way the Founding Fathers intended it to be. I wonder if this tradition still continues today.  From there travel to a tiny town in the midwest for an old fashioned red, white and blue Fourth of July. Wherever you live in this great nation there is probably a story originating in your neck of the woods. These are uplifting and heart-warming tales that will lift your spirits and make you proud to be an American.

As I mentioned earlier, ""On The Road with Charles Kuralt: The Americana Collection"" offers up more than 200 of these memorable vignettes. Also included is a 55 minute interview with cameraman Isadore Bleckman and updates on quite a few of these stories. Since there is more than 17 hours of material in this collection it is going to take me a while to get through all of it. There are dozens and dozens of stories here that were not included in my old VHS collection. I doubt I have seen any of them since they first aired on the ""CBS Evening News"" so many years ago. I can't wait to see them all again. I have extremely fond memories of Charles Kuralt and his ""On The Road"" series for two important reasons. First, he taught my wife and I how to travel. More often than not when vacation time rolls around you will find us exploring back roads in out of the way places. But perhaps more importantly, Charles Kuralt introduced me to the person that I admire most. That's right. His name is Jethro Mann a/k/a ""The Bicycle Man"" and at the time he was a North Carolina state worker. Check out his story in the collection and see if you don't share my admiration for him. What a kind and generous man!  ""On The Road with Charles Kuralt: The Americana Collection"" would be a tremendous addition to any video collection and would be the perfect gift for that older person in your life. This is a collection that you will definitely want to share with family and friends.  Very highly recommended!",1322524800,34,4794,4.46689497716895

I just finished re read 3 of his books and got nostalgic to see some of the TV shows. Kuralt was an American treasure . Very few have the talent with the written word that he possessed.

I think the world would look a little sunnier if someone tried to recapture the flavor of ""On the road"". We could all benefit by seeing some of the good folks and places out there in America. They are still out there.",1497312000,4,553,3.981981981981982
