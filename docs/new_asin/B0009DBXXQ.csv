2278251,5,B0009DBXXQ,"This may well be the Verdi Requiem you always waited for; in spite of its almost 40 years of having been recorded, it is only now that it gains legal and therefore more widespread circulation. Thoroughly idiomatic, with a cast the stuff dreams are made of, a marvellous and authentic-souding choir and orchestra. If Karajan's antics and mimics, the maestro ever the grand poseur, annoy or distract  you, turn the telly off and just listen to the sound through a good sound system. The sound is remarkably fresh and proportions or sound planes between soloists, orchestra and chorus well managed. The La Scala orchestra may not be the Berlin Philharmonic -at the time an awe-inspiring virtuoso body of orchestral musicians, but  Karajan still ventured ocasionally out of his Philharmonie to conduct elsewehere and other ensembles, his love affair with the Dresden orchestra is well documented- but they were long accustomed to the maestro's ways (they had often worked together since the war and through the 1950's and 1960's) and their enthusiasm and commitment do compensate for their lack of finesse -again, compared to the berliners of the time, I don't want to imply they play sloppily or inaccurately, nothing of the sort, they may well have been, and by far, Italy's best orchestra at the time-. The vocal quartet is beyond belief and has been sufficiently praised in these pages by others.

There was criticism in the press at the time of the concert this film was connected to about Karajan's overly theatrical approach, but in a way the work calls for it, Toscanini being the obvious model. Southern european warmth and commitment, roman catholic awe before the inevitability of death ot the ever announced day of wrath and a musical setting much imbued of the pomp and circumstance the Vatican Council would do away with a century later? That is the cultural environment the performance takes place in, the performance inheritance Karajan and his musicians performed under, barely three years after Vatican II strongly frowned upon the liturgical context Verdi wrote for, regardles of whether you think this Requiem better suits the church or the theatre. In some way or another, most of the great recordings of the work throughout the 20th century are closely associated with italians or roman catholics (Toscanini, De  Sabata, Serafin, Abbado, Muti), practising or not but definitely bred and raised within a solid roman catholic conception of what a Requiem Mass is about and what it means. Does the work prove elusive to non-catholics then? Perhaps, but Karajan extracts wonders from his performers, Price and Cossotto the undoubted stars of the event. The would-be Parma footballer, Luciano Pavarotti, (thank God he exchanged the ball for the voice) is hard to recognise without his familiar beard and (for his later standards) slenderness, rendering a Kyrie and an Ingemisco that announce why he was starting to make a lot of noise in italian musical circles (and proves Karajan's hindsight as regards promising singers), Ghiaurov was by then an established figure, sought by all great houses on both sides of the Atlantic.

There is no way for me to sufficiently praise this recording. There are visual flaws as the work was studio-recorded to a large extent (if not in its entirety, there's no way to tell accurately) and the sound later dubbed in onto the image, which of course allowed Karajan to concentrate substantial film time on his image, gesturing and playing the mesmeriser to orchestra, soloists and chorus before an absent audience. He was, as I said above, a grand poseur but no doubt a fabulously equipped musician, to borrow  somewhat from Harold Schonberg's remark on Bruno Walter, as this Verdi Requiem recording amply proves.

Full 1960's glamour then, weird female hairdos and all, all fully dressed up in full gala costumes for a truly memorable experience.",1143676800,44,3895,5.067082683307333
2278252,5,B0009DBXXQ,"I support everything said by the other critic in the previous review. This 1967 filmed performance of Verdi's Requiem is a long awaited treasure of classical music. For years it was not commercially available and now thanks to modern digital technology, it's available on a fine DVD. The DVD itself is not to blame for the lack of synchronization in sound and film; it was Karajan and his people's fault since they were working with primitive camera technology. It was filmed in the Teatro A La Scala, Milan, Italy, sans an audience, providing the performance with a studio recording feel, perhaps to make the singers feel more comfortable. And what an ensemble well-endowed singers! Soprano Leontyne Price, tenor Luciano Pavarotti, mezzo-soprano Fiorenza Cossotto and bass Nikolai Ghiaurov. These singers are captured in their glorious prime and at this time their careers were taking on a meteoric rise to fame in the opera scene of the late 60's and would continue well into the 70's. The Verdi Requiem continues to be a staple of sacred music repetoire and it's a work of tremendous power. The chorus and soloists have music written to sound operatic but the traditional Requiem form is maintained- Requiem Dona Est Domine (Peace Grant them O, Lord), the Dies Irae (Day of Wrath) Rex Tremande (Tremendous Majesty) Tuba Mirum (A Trumpet Shall Sound) Libera Me (Free My Soul) etc. Verdi wrote the Requiem for his deceased friend the author Manzoni. It is his most beautiful and stirring non-operatic work, one of the last things he ever composed. It was an ambitious project and many times it resembles the grander requiems from before Verdi's time- Mozart's, Beethoven's Mass in C, Berlioz's large-scale Requiem and Brahm's German Requiem. But Verdi's signature is clearly on it.

Leontyne Price was championed by Karajan and at this time she was probably a close friend of his, having worked with him in studio recordings and Vienna Opera productions of Tosca and Il Trovatore. In '67, Price was still in great shape vocally. Her radiant high register was marked with a supersquillo quality and her lower chest voice had not yet developed that disturbing depth it would have in the 70's that plunged into the mezzo soprano/alto range (which is why she was able to sing Carmen). Her voice is beautiful and dramatic, angelic and noble, furious and vulnerable all at once. Toward the end of the Requiem, in which her voice dominates even the orchestra, Price becomes a goddess. I wonder what it was like for Price to work with Fiorenza Cossotto, rumored (by Maria Callas) to be an insufferable diva. Cossotto was the hottest item in La Scala at that time in the late 60's. While I never cared for her voice, she is doing a fine job here, and it is superior to her studio recordings under RCA with Price and Domingo (Trovatore, Forza Del Destino). Cossotto did not possess a dark enough lower voice and many times she resembles a wannabe soprano. Even Price has a darker range in this performance.

Luciano Pavarotti is VERY YOUNG here. He is not my favorite tenor but from his effulgent voice on this Requiem, a voice that can break glass with its piercing ""ping"" quality, we know exactly why he rose to the top. Ghiarov is also young here, and had not yet married Mirella Freni and his bass voice is dark and god-like. Karajan is also in his prime and he moves with agility and conducts with more energy than I have ever seen (except for the Carmen film with Grace Bumbry also around this time at the Salzburg Festival). Karajan has a tendency to close his eyes when he is most involved in the music. He is still able to push his musicians to perfection and in this DVD we see exactly what Karajan did when he was probably able to conduct every one of Mahler's Symphonies in the course of a single year! Without hesitation buy this DVD. It is a fine documented moment in classical music history. By the way, Price, Pavarotti, Cossotto are still alive. Karajan passed away in 1988 and Ghiurov passed away a few years ago around 2003.",1128384000,75,4034,4.75320970042796
2278253,5,B0009DBXXQ,"I have waited long for this, having seen it once, long ago.

Filmed in 1967, in an empty La Scala Opera House after a concert commemorating the ten year anniversary of the death of Arturo Toscanini, this is a performance for the ages. Great, legendary voices - Price in her prime; Cossoto, whose work alone is worth the cost of this DVD; Pavarotti, almost svelte, here you can honestly see what all the fuss was about so long ago; and Ghiaurov, whose voice is so well suited to this work. And then there is Karajan. Not the enfeebled shadow of himself, hardly able to walk and unable to gesture, that we see in so many of the Sony DVD documents from the 1980's. This is a younger, healthy Karajan, vigorous, committed and imploring the singers and orchestra to play their hearts out. Again, as with Pavarotti, ones sees what the fuss was all about.

The La Scala orchestra is not on par with Berlin or Vienna, particularly in the brass, but the chorus is rich, full and expressive.

The ""but.."" in my review concerns the inattentive, sloppy and sometimes dishonest editing. There are not a few moments in the performance where the sound and picture are not in sync. Any musician could see this immediately. For one example, there is a great climax in the ""Tuba Mirum"" where the sound clearly lags the picture by more than a half of a beat. Later, at the beginning of the ""Ingemisco"", Karajan is clearly conducting something other that what we are hearing. The same shot is used later in the same movement at the proper time. Retakes are also obvious, in that the orchestral seating changes within the same movement: at one moment Leontyne Price is standing in front of a row of trumpeters used in the ""Tuba Mirum"", and a moment later they are gone, then they are back!!! These are not as disturbing as the occasionally poor sync between music and picture.

Ultimately though, this is a valuable DVD to have. Five great artists at their best, on film. That's enough for me.",1127433600,16,1972,4.577903682719547
2278274,5,B0009DBXXQ,"Most of the major classical composers from Beethoven to Britten and Lloyd Webber have written at least one requiem, some have written more. This has not been the norm however for composers more attuned to operatic composition, with a few exceptions. Verdi may be an exception by accident. Rossini died in 1868. Even though his last years were spent in Paris, Rossini had brought attention and respect to Italian Opera. Grand Opera was the only rival to Italian Opera at the time and that existed only in Paris. In the same month shortly after Rossini's death, Verdi wrote to his publisher, Ricordi, suggesting the composing of a Requiem Mass to honor Rossini's memory. He further suggested that the Mass should be composed by the most distinguished Italian composers, each one selected to compose one of the parts of the Mass. As this project moved forward, Verdi's task became the composition of the Libera Me. A commission was formed to oversee the effort. The intention was for the first performance to occur on the first anniversary of Rossini's death. Sadly though as work progressed on the various parts resentments and jealousies developed among the composers and both impresario and performers revealed their pettiness. Once it became obvious that the targeted date could not be met, Verdi insisted himself that the whole project be halted. Verdi though had already completed his part, the Libera Me. During the period before the project had been abandoned Verdi had received a letter from Alberto Mazzucato, Director of the Milan Conservatory and a member of the commission for the Rossini Mass. The letter praised the beauty and power of Verdi's composition saying ""...You...have written the most beautiful, the greatest and the most colossally poetic piece imaginable"". Partially as a result of this letter it is believed that in the succeeding two or three years, Verdi's displeasure at the failure of this joint compositional effort caused the gestation of the idea that he should compose the entire Mass himself. Verdi's concern with the fate of Italian music in general and with the National tradition in particular, was not confined to his plan for the Messa a Rossini. On May 22, 1873, Alessandro Manzoni, the revered Italian poet, died, a figure who was at the very center of Italian culture. One day later Verdi wrote ""I...shall in the future...make some proposal for the honoring of his memory."" Some think that there was little doubt that Verdi was thinking of the Requiem on which he was working. As early as June 9, Verdi had written to the mayor of Milan confirming his intention of accepting a proposal for solemnly celebrating the first anniversary of Manzoni's death with the performance of a Requiem. This in fact occurred on May 22, 1874,in the Chiesa Di San Marco, Milano, a church which Verdi considered acoustically superior to either the Milan cathedral or the church which Manzoni himself attended, San Fedele. Critical evaluation at the time was mixed. Noted German conductor and (Richard) Wagner fanatic Hans von Bulow (despite Wagner's despicable treatment of him) called the Requiem ""an opera in church vestments"" believing that it should have been performed in an opera house. None other than Johannes Brahms responded saying ""Bulow has made an immortal ass of himself with this, only a genius could write anything like it."" Eighteen years later Bulow wrote Verdi a penitent letter asking pardon for his ""injustice"" and ""intolerance"".

This performance from 1967, a commemorative concert on the the tenth anniversary of the death of Arturo Toscanini, under the conducting of Herbert von Karajan, sans baton, features four of the operatic superstars of the mid to late 20th Century, but, here we have them in the earlier stages, and for some possibly the peak, of their illustrious careers. Indeed Price and Ghiaurov are the oldest at 40 and 42, while both Cossotto and Pavarotti are only in their 32nd years. Many opera lovers, for example, will have no memory of Pavarotti sans mustache and beard. These four had one particular quality in common, their voices were all powerful. And both Price and Cossotto sing entirely from memory!  All four some sixteen years later appeared in the Metropolitan Opera Centennial Gala on October 22, 1983, with Price and Pavarotti singing the Act II Un Ballo in Maschera duet which was the closing performance of the evening. This presentation, first available on VHS, then Laser Disc and now on DVD is arguably the definitive recorded performance of the Verdi Requiem.",1429228800,8,4544,5.057333333333333

minus is the poor cinematography by none other than George Clouzot.  What Clouzot was trying to do is beyond me, but he
ended up destroying the dramatic impact ot this beautiful masterpiece as well as ignoring much of the soloists singing in search

Every single piece keeps me on edge wanting to hear the next while at the same time causing me to want to back up and listen to each segment again and again.  I bought this recording on VHS about 20 years ago and was very excited to get it again on DVD.  I'm hoping a MP3 version will show up soon.

2278283,5,B0009DBXXQ,"Considering that this DVD was recorded in the 1960s, it is extremely well done.  Verdi's Requiem is one of the greatest operatic choral works ever composed and this version, conducted by Von Karajan with superb soloists including Luciano Pavarotti and Leontyne Price, is a total treat.  You will not be disappointed if you purchase this. It does have more close-ups of the conductor than I might have wanted, but not so many that it will spoil anything for you.",1379894400,,461,4.822784810126582

2278285,5,B0009DBXXQ,Von Karajan's direction of this great requiem is masterful. The chorus is excellent and the four soloists are unbeatable.

2278287,5,B0009DBXXQ,"This Requiem is as fabulous and glorious as one would expect from the incredible divi singing it in their prime under Herbert von Karajan. One probably will never be able to find a more stupendous one or one that sends chills down one's back in it's intensity.
Unfortunately, in this world, few things are perfect. It is really totally strange to look at Leontyne Price, Fiorenza Cossotto, Luciano Pavarotti and Nicholai Ghiaurov without a slight disbelief: they look so desperately young, so very different from the mature artists they became and as we remember them.
So, if you must, close one eye but listen with both ears to be overwhelmed by a mind-blowing performance.",1370736000,5,674,4.921052631578948

2278291,5,B0009DBXXQ,"Despite questionable directorial decisions, particularly during the Libera Me when the viewer is ""treated"" to watching von Karajan's histrionics rather than Price's magnificent singing (especially the high B flat) this is a stunning recording.  I own  multiple recordings of this work  and have attended many performances in Philadelphia, Washington and Boston.  This is now the go-to recording when, as was true last week following the death of a close friend and former professor, I need to listen to the entire Requiem as I pray.  Pavarotti, though he appeared anxious, was excellent; this coming from a man who was not a fan of ""The Pav"" during his days of morbid obesity, histrionic narcissism and handkerchief waving.  A pity he let himself go not too long after this recording.  Ghiarouv's singing was magnificent.  He is one of the very few who does not strain to hit the lowest notes.  Cossotto was also magnificent.  In some of the performances I've heard the mezzo gets lost during the quartets.  Not here.  Price's singing was sublime, particularly during the Libera Me which is how I judge all performances of the Requiem.  Her final notes were chilling in the most positive sense.

I am a Catholic priest.  The reverence with which the singers, both soloists and chorus, performed their parts, the sense of awe and trembling during the Dies Irae, is splendid.  Years ago I tired of the  ""nyah nyah na na na"" arguments that Verdi was an avowed atheist and that the Requiem is operatic, not liturgical.  When I listened to this disc the first time I froze as Price intoned, with a hint of a groan of the dying, Libera Me Domnine . . . .  at the end.  This is a deeply liturgical work for those who pray.  It is a deeply consoling work for a priest who has to prepare homilies for funeral Masses, oftentimes for friends or family. It is a work imbued with hope in the resurrection while at the same time expressing the pain of death for those who grieve.  This is the gem of my liturgical music collection.  It is one of the discs I will never ever loan to anyone.  Yes, you may listen to it if I am in the room but no, you may not borrow it.",1329955200,7,2153,4.575916230366492

2278304,2,B0009DBXXQ,"This is an example of what happens when the enthusiasm of the director gets in the way of the art. A simple basic rule of filming singers is that the camera stays on the singer all the time they are singing. On this dvd Henri-Georges Clouzot constantly moves the camera off the singers half-way through the phrase. It's distracting and makes it impossible to focus properly on the music. Given that in this instance the singers include at least two of the greatest of the great, it's particularly distressing.",1270857600,13,509,4.730337078651686

2278306,5,B0009DBXXQ,"When Herbert von Karajan walks out on to the stage to the podium I thought I had finally received a new dvd in which the sound had been left out.  I was expecting wild applause of course, but then it became clear that there was no audience at all.  This is a famous film, film being the operative word.  The chorus is dressed to the nines, the women all draped in fawn grey satin shawls over their black, low-cut gowns, many in pearls, hair done to great heights, eyes lined like Egyptians and an abundance of green and turquoise eye shadow and pink lipstick.  It's all very late 1960s looking and brought back many memories of those days (I was 15 when this film was made so it all seems familiar to me).  These fashion aspects add to the poignance of this very great performance, for me, because most of the people in this film are probably dead.  Most are not very old in the film but it was forty odd years ago and most of them were middle aged at that time and well over 100 years old by now.  The impact of a requiem for the dead is thereby heightened by this realization.  Of the principals only Leontyne Price and Fiorenza Cossotto are still with us.  Price, Cossotto and Ghiaurov were at the peak of their awesome primes and Pavarotti was just starting on his glorious career and I've never enjoyed his singing more.  He is humble and looks a bit scared in that exalted company.  This was before his ubiquitous grizzly bear beard appeared, so you can see his baby face tottering on the edge of going to fat.  It's very interesting to see him in this.  I don't think I ever liked him much after this period, this film and his Duke of Mantua in Bonynge's Rigoletto with Sutherland and Milnes on Decca were his greatest recorded legacies before the Ham took over.

It doesn't take any time at all to get used to this artificial concert.  The performance is classic and will probably never be replicated or even approached in greatness.  The solo quartet are amazing.  All of them stand perfectly still throughout, no grimacing or arm waving or over-acting.  They stand and deliver, huge, beautiful voices coming out of mouths that appear to be speaking normally.  Perhaps they are lip-syncing, I don't know, but they appear to be actually singing.  I know there was a degree of splicing and dicing of the sound to the picture but I don't think the singers were doing a Brittany Spears fake-out.

Whatever the case, the performance is stupendous.  Even if you hate Karajan you will have to admit that this is one of the greatest filmed musical events laid down for posterity to enjoy.  Many think it's all just another big ego trip for Karajan, but I didn't detect ego at work, primarily, but rather an almost child-like wonder from the podium at the glory of the music.  The forces of La Scala play and sing this music like no other.  Clouzot's direction is occasionally a bit fussy but it never gets in the way of the impact of the music.

This is a Verdi spectacular as far as musical forces goes.  I counted 14 trumpet players, some in side balconies.

The sound quality is good, well-balanced, not tinny or boomy.  It appears to have been recorded at a fairly low level and I had to crank the volume up to hear it.  The picture quality is fine.  I bought the 2005 dvd release as the original 2001 release is ridiculously priced in the hundreds of dollars.  I don't think there can be much difference in overall product quality between the two, in fact I might expect the newer release to be slightly improved upon.

2278308,2,B0009DBXXQ,"No quarrel with the musical properties of this DVD. All four soloists are in a stupendous form of voice. But why is the filming team concentrating so much (to a disgusting exaggeration) on Karajan's hands and movments and by=passing the singers at theirs most glorious moments ?
Is it because of the Karajan cult ?
Take an example of the filming team stupidity:
""Liber scriptus"" - the mezzo-soprano solo, instead of the camera concentrating on her, the camera is 'searching' for faces in the female choir, but the female choir is silent at that passage, so why ?
Take the Dies Ira - the camera abandons the solo-quartet and goes to Karajan's hands instead of showing the climax high C - 'property' of Leontyne Price and the other soloists at the peak of that passage.
Too much of Karajan and too little if the singing quartet.

2278310,5,B0009DBXXQ,"When I purchased this marvelous disc from Amazon, the customer ratings stood at 22 five-star raves and two equivocal three-star posts that focused on alleged audio deficiencies. Perhaps an average run-of-the mill surround sound system registers defects, but I can attest that the recording sounds fabulous on a state-of-the-art stereo rig. Needless to say, sound technology has developed considerably since - of all people! -- famed director Henri-Georges Clouzot (""Les Diaboliques"" and ""The Wages of Fear"") filmed this in 1967. Still, it is damned good, with virtually no audible distortion and a tremendous dynamic range. I was delighted! It's always fun to watch the pompous but brilliant von Karajan, and the now legendary soloists are fabulous - especially Fiorenza Cossotto. Despite that disturbing whoop of a slur Leontyne Price often made, she is at her glorious best; Giaurov is superb; and Pavarotti never sounded as wonderful as he did in his youth. Clouzot's filming is exemplary and the 4:3 video image is quite clean and clear.",1234483200,3,1041,5.27710843373494
2278311,5,B0009DBXXQ,"This version of Verdi's Requiem has been
reviewed by opera fans much more
knowledgeable than I am, and I agree
with just about all of them. This is an
absolutely stunning performance
with four of the most beautiful operatic
voices of a generation.

While I originally purchased this DVD to
hear a youthful Pavarotti, I have to
agree with Mr. Kay that out of the four
superstars, it is Fiorenza Cossotto,
the mezzo soprano, whose star shines
brightest here. He cites her
performance in ""Liber scriptus,""
but I'd like to add ""Lux aternum.""
The beauty, clarity, and range of
her voice in these pieces is simply
extraordinary.

I once read a music critic describe
her voice as ""not really beautiful,
but she colors it in a way that makes
you think it is."" I disagree. I think
her voice is simply beautiful without
any qualifiers.

Finally, what makes this Requiem so
special is many of the principals
have passed on...Karajan in the 80s,
Ghiaurov in 2003, and Pavarotti in 2007.

It's wonderful to have this treasure on
DVD to be able to see as well as hear
these extraordinarily talented artists
perform one of Verdi's most beautiful
works.",1228608000,4,1137,4.7272727272727275
2278312,5,B0009DBXXQ,"My opinion about this DVD is not at all as technical as the others I've read here. And it shouldn't, it's beyound my skills. But, as a only recently afficionate of classical operatic songs, I must tell that I came across with this DVD almost by chance on the internet and since I bought it I got really ""arrested"" by it. To my feeling, Karajan's way of conducting without the scores and with passionate movements, just like his whole body is singing the music, seems trully genuine, although certainly not conventional. As I could see in many videos with him teaching and rehearsing, this seems to reflect the way he really thinks an feel about music.
The second remarkable impressions was with Ghiaurov's performance. I heard him for the first time on the Gounod's ""Faust"" DVD, as as much sounding and full of expression Mephistophelis. I've heard other recordings of Verdi's Requiem, as, for instance, the one with the great Finnish bass Talvella. But I think Ghiaurov's performance in this recording was much better, with a good diction, great interpretation. He, by himself is an impossant figure... I find Talvela's voice more ""dense"", if I can express this way, but Ghiaurov singing ""Confutatis"" is awesome.
Pavarotti was for me the greatest surprise, since I had never seen him so young and without his ""trademark"" beard. After listening to his interpretation of Ingemisco, I can hardly stand the performances recorded by some tenors... A potent voice, clear pronounciation, perfect high-pitch notes. And he was only 32 years-old.
About Cossotto and Price, they were both great also. But Cossotto touched me more deeply, specially in her ""Liber scriptus"" performance. Summing up, the four soloists were in great balance for my ears, with great individual performances and aso sounding perfectly together.
I can say that this film really opened my mind to many other routes of music. Through it I cultivated and deepened a great respect for Pavarotti, Karajan, Verdi...
I highly recommend it.",1225065600,5,1998,5.039274924471299

Let's get one really serious bugbear outta the way. I LAUGH

when reading that the directorial credit is ascribed to one

Henri-Georges Clouzot. It's plainly

obvious that the Master Controller here of All Things

Camera is Herbie The Self-Love Bug. He's a camera-hogging

poseur, putting on these lofty faces of beatitude and

self-reverence, doing a virtual ballet with his arms and

hands. It's a frustrating state of affairs to hear the

singers' most crucial lines going forth expressively whilst

we want to take an elbow and knock the camera off Herr

Herbie toward what we're missing. The Von does a fine

conductorial job, tempos usually well-judged; in particular

the sensitive moments are beautiful texturally, and

eloquent. Elsewhere, in the more fiery damned-to-hell

sections, he rather sweetens them with Deutscher Zucker,

and misses out on the terrifying thunderous sweep of the

Italians, Toscanini and De Sabata, or the weeping wrath of

Giulini.

The Scala forces are as always, right on top of this music,

and the chorus, well highlighted here, demonstrate their

inborn affinity with this music.

What makes this a near-definitive version are the soloists,

all at their Spring-of-life prime.

It's a jolt to see a clean shaven, ineffably boyish

Pavarotti, comparatively trim and well turned-out. It is as

well refreshing to see him in state before he became The

Pav. Forced into this formalized surrounding, and absent of

the later self-conscious self-awareness, he looks part of

the ensemble, and for all intents and purposes, like a

serious artist. For all of that, he is not very expressive

in face, looking slightly out of it, with a sort of worried

little frown - apropos? But, for compensations, there's

the voice, fresh, pingy and with that characteristic combo

of silver and gold. And under Von Karajan's eagle-ear, he

manages some fine modulation of tone, without resorting to

the breathy attempts of later years. ""Ingemisco"" peals out

quite eloquently.

This is Ghiaurov's best account by far of the bass part. In

the Giulini recording I felt he lacked depth at the bottom

of his range, and his sense of rhythm was a bit slack. Even

in this film he is more bass-baritone than true bass; to my

ears he lacks the forbidding blackness in the lower reaches

(Siepi on the De Sabata set is my ideal). He frequently has

to alter vowels in a conspicuous attempt to achieve depth;

for example 'suplex' becomes 'soaplex', 'natura' becomes

'na-toh-ruh'- yet when he has to sing the high-lying

'responsura' - the vowels are all pure. The final

'stupedit' is breathy. The upper range is magnificent; the

opening of 'Confutatis maledictis' thunders out splendidly.

Moreover though, he sings with a great deal of feeling, and

puts a lot of care into his phrasing.

The ladies, though, take top honors here.

Fiorenza Cossotto is right smack in her most

refulgent-voiced period of her career, just a few years

before the nap wore off her upper register and turned hard

and narrow. Here though, she is in shining, full tone.

Cossotto is in the same period as her recorded Santuzza

with Von Karajan, unfailingly demonstrating a rapt, finely

detailed musical expressivity, and her voice obeys her

every wish. She follows the score markings scrupulously.

The portamenti at 'proferetur' is simply ravishing;

Cossotto at this time was capable of real modulation, and

she imparts an ethereal ""tubular'sound for those high-lying

lines where there is an ideal purity. 'Lux terna' is

ravishing, spiritual. On the other end of the scale, that

immediately identifying plum-burgundy colored tone has

never etched the lower lines more satisfactorily than here.

Absent of any coarseness, the mellow richness is a pleasure

in this music. Best of all: she is a perfect match for

Price in their sections in unison. In the 'Recordare,' you

will not believe your ears when you hear their harmonizing

on the word 'redemisti'. Or their shadows-and-light effect

in 'Agnus Dei' - eerie, haunting, otherwordly! Timbres and

vibrations ideal in a way that they rarely are.

Prepare yourself for my words on Price. To my ears, this is

the greatest account of the soprano part I have ever heard.

I have heard nearly every commercial and a few live ones,

and no soprano can beat Price for sheer ease and beauty of

tone. It may even be Price's finest recorded document.

Challenge me if you wish, this is a personal observation,

but I have practically memorized the score, and her

attention to the special, specific dynamic markings is

unparalleled. Why? Because she CAN. From soft to swelled,

back to soft again? Pfftt. No problem at all, sure,

anything you want. And I'll make it easy for you; she can

boast of hitting a hallmark standard because it is

fulfilled as it rarely is in vocal music. In this account,

there is no strain or struggling ANYWHERE. The top sails

forth with a rapturous abandon, ease and purity you won't

get in any other soprano. And if anyone had a patent on

beauty of tone, it was Price. It was the voice from heaven.

Clich&eacute;d and kitsch metaphor aside, I never cease to be

amazed at how anyone can float and send out a high tone

with such lack of effort. One thing about Price's top

notes. You know how a lot of sopranos seem to reach for

their upper notes in an interval, as if they were

""climbing"" in a sense? They hit the note, but it seems to

be where the vibrations are on the underside of the pitch;

with Price, she seems to drop squarely from the sky right

onto the note. Not necessarily on the upper side of the

pitch, but just the ability to gently land on it. That's

how secure she was.

Price once said (and I paraphrase) ""Sometimes I just move

myself to tears. That sounds so conceited, doesn't it, but

I can't help it!"" Well if anyone had a right to say it,

she did. Especially on this occasion.

How beautiful is Price's singing here? So beautiful, that

the andante section `Requiem, ternam' in the ""Libera me""

still has the power after all these years, to jerk the

tears out of me.

In the dramatic opening section of ""Libera Me"" you can see

how involved she is, really investing into the text and

emotions in a very personal way. For once, that dusky, not

always focused lower register works just right here:

somehow the absence of chesty bellowing sounds apropos for

this religious piece. The fear and recoil is vividly

projected, and it is therefore more effective.

But nothing will prepare the listener when Price does the

`Requiem ternam.' It is an amazing circumstance, when you

follow the score, to see how conscientiously she is

following the gradations of p, pp, ppp, and pppp, executing

them flawlessly, and yet with such an abundance of feeling,

such a malleable, unforced legato line. When she's asked to

start softly, swell, and then pull back on the first

`ternam,' your ears pin back at Price's staggering ease.

 And on top of that, a tone so buoyantly glistening, such

joy in the gilding of a line where so many have audible

trouble just to keep up with it.

The most boneheaded decision though, a serious editing

mistake (one for which you feel like smacking Von Karajan

upside his head) is denying us the pleasure of seeing Price

sail out the climactic high C at the end! Did Herbie wish

to upstage her? He succeeded. What more criminal thing to

do?

If you already haven't done so, do yourself a favor and get

this release. It is a legendary document of

all the artists involved at the pinnacle of their careers.",1180137600,23,7902,4.8264462809917354

2278320,5,B0009DBXXQ,"Not much to say but what we have here is the definitive recording of the great Verdi Requiem.  However, This 2005 release of the actual recording of 1967 seemingly sacrificed the (vocal) audio for the superb video quality.  The images are crystal clear.  I don't know how that was managed but I have the 2001 release of this same dvd and the audio (vocal) is superior.

Price, Gihiaurov, and von Karajan are as close to perfection as one could get. Cossoto is great and I was totaly unaware of her before this recording.  However, if you listen closely you'll hear her having some difficulties vocally in two areas.  You'll have to listen to find out for yourself. Pavarotti was too nervous and stiff for me and I wish a more seasoned tenor could have been chosen.  However, he possessed the voice in spite of his stage presence.

My disappointment is that Von Karajan allowed the chorus to accompany Price as she soared to those beautiful notes in the Libera Me.  Trust me; she needed no help.  It would have been the icing on the cake if she had been allowed to do it alone.  I would have loved to have seen her soar alone as well!!!

The orchestra and chorus were simply amazing.",1170115200,8,1182,4.497652582159624
2278321,5,B0009DBXXQ,"If the readers will forgive me, the following is a reprint of my 2004 review of the VHS tape that was sporadically available at exorbitant prices. It is now re-issued on DVD for fraction of the price with vastly improved sound and picture quality.

""This is Herbert von Karajan's first video of the great Requiem by Verdi. It comes from 1967 when he was still relatively young, only 57 years old. He collected all the best forces available: the Orchestra and Chorus of the Scala of Milan and some of the greatest soloists of all time. It is a magnificent performance. There is total commitment throughout, an almost religious devotion to the conductor and the work itself.

That Karajan does this with the Scala forces immediately dispels the notion that he achieved all his fame due to the Berlin Philharmonic. The Orchestra plays with fierce intensity and precision that has rarely been heard from them. And the Chorus of serious and devoted Italian women and men sing like angels.

Karajan's concentration and total control is astonishing. His beat is almost unnoticeable, but his tempi are always perfect and relentless. His delicate hands, featured often in the film, shape the melodies and inspire the entire ensemble. But he is also capable of the superhuman hammer blows of the Dies Irae sequence, which are shattering. Tuba mirum has rarely sounded more awe inspiring, sending shivers down on everybody's spine. One could go on and on...

The soloists certainly do justice. Leontine Price , who sings without score, is showing intense sorrow throughout and great drama at the final Libera me section, her crowning achievement in this performance. Fiorenza Cassotto, one of the most underrated singers, is wonderfully mellifluous with her rich dark hued mezzo soprano voice (she also sings without a score). A young Pavarotti, his voice in its prime, is very impressive indeed.(he hasn't got the famous beard yet!) and Nicolai Ghiarov, probably the best basso of our generation, is beyond praise.

Unfortunately,for some reason, Deutsche Gramophone, after releasing it in DVD, seems to have withdrawn or discontinued it. Right now they are only available onVHS and not too many of those either, so the price is exorbitant. Hopefully DGG will realize the problem and re-release the DVD soon.

In spite of all this I still highly recommend it.. It is an other worldly experience.""

Price, Cossotto, Ghiaurov and the very young Pavarotti are great singers, and the La Scala orchestra is maybe more expressive than the Vienna. Pavarotti has an effortlessly pure voice, compared with Carreras', which can seem forced at times. Ghiaurov's bass is stronger than Van Dam's, although the latter has a more subtle quality in some passages. Price is more powerful than Tomowa-Sintov, but Baltsa has a lovely, dark quality not present in Cossotto's.
