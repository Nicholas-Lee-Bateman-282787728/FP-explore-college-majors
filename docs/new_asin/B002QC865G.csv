8377643,3,B002QC865G,"Music is nice, and fairly decent work-out.  Cues are a little difficult to follow, but after doing it a few times, it gets easier.  The twist on the grapevine move is a bit awkward (stepping in front instead of behind), but again, you get used to it after a few times.",1433894400,,268,4.235294117647059
8377644,5,B002QC865G,"This video is perfect for beginners and people with arthritis. I especially like the fact that it had ""Praise"" music in the background.",1365033600,,135,4.913043478260869
8377645,4,B002QC865G,This is a good workout if you can do cardio.  I bought it with hopes I could do it with my physical limits but it is to fast and the movements are to much if you have any limitations.  If you don't good work out I DID WATCH IT AND TRIED SOME OF IT.,1319414400,,248,3.574074074074074
