8300915,1,B001F2W56O,"DO NOT FALL FOR THIS! As seen in other reviews, when this DVD was opened it turned out to be for Torchy, Series 2 only, meaning something like the first 28 or so episodes are NOT included.  I was of course charged the full price. False advertising on Amazon continues without correction and I'm getting sick of it.",1381881600,,314,4.413793103448276
8300916,5,B001F2W56O,"This was one of the 2 shows that Gerry Anderson did in the 50's (before he became a household name with Thunderbirds in the 60's, and the other being Twizzle). I was only familiar with this show from the few You Tube clips and happy that the complete series has been released. Primitive compared to his other shows, but it shows how he started out and how his technique eventually evolved.",1375056000,,389,4.492957746478873
8300917,3,B001F2W56O,"This is not a review of the content, but a warning, as one of the reviewers wrote, I ordered 1st and 2nd series, but only was sent the 2nd series, completely different DVD.",1358467200,,172,4.242424242424242
8300918,1,B001F2W56O,Where is the first series?  My receipt says THE COMPLETE FIRST & SECOND SERIES but AMAZON only sent the COMPLETE SECOND SERIES.  Great show and quality BUT missing a year :),1357776000,,173,4.548387096774194
8300919,3,B001F2W56O,"This is the complete series, 52 episodes, which come in around 15 minutes each.  Nice puppeteer work.  Not as polished as Supercar, it's still worth a look.",1273536000,,156,4.7407407407407405
