7975181,4,B00007DNCX,"I've been following Toto since their first album.  This DVD is a great addition to my collection.  As other reviewers have noted, the quality isn't the best, but it's not all that bad.  Some of the cuts are puzzling: the choppy editing of ""Child's Anthem"" and the fade-out of ""Goodbye Elenore.""  All in all, for 10 bucks, a great find. Any fan of Toto should own this.",1332806400,,368,4.447761194029851
7975182,1,B00007DNCX,"In product detail, the format of this DVD is shown as NTSC, which is compatible with TV sold in the US.  However, the DVD I received was ""PAL"" format, which is standard in Europe but NOT compatible with TV sold in the US.  Please be careful!",1236124800,11,241,4.217391304347826
7975183,3,B00007DNCX,"Being the first to review this DVD should have aroused my suspicion. With that being said, It is my fault for purchasing an item that had little to no description of said item. I thought I could look up the CD of the same name and cover art to see the track list that I would be buying. I was pleasantly surprised to see all the great hits plus acoustic versions I would be getting. Nothing could be farther from the truth! The video quality of this concert looks pirated(TERRIBLE),only 12 songs from a concert in Paris,a ""Behind the Scenes""that is patched together and finally a Toto interview  that looks like it was done with a defective camcorder. Don't get me wrong,I am a HUGE Toto fan and even a deceptive DVD seller can't make them sound bad. Word to the Wise;don't buy undescriptive items and most important,save your $26.oo & change and don't buy this DVD.",1195257600,18,866,4.515923566878981
