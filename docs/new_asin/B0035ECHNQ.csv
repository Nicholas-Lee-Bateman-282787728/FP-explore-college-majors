8388870,5,B0035ECHNQ,"I have been playing guitar for about 8 months now and have been learning from dvds at home (Keith Wyatt ""Getting Started on Electric Guitar"" and John McCarthy's Rock House dvd's). So I know some techniques now, and with this Guitar Play Along: 60's classics I can now use those beginning/intermediate techniques in real songs. I have tried some of the other Play Along dvds and books, but the songs are too hard to play all the way through (specifically the solos). This is one is a good fit for someone at my level.
Song by song, here are the skills that you need and will practice:
Cissy Strut: single notes groove in c pentatonic and a few chords
The House of the Rising Sun: arpeggios of open chords, strumming in 6/8 time
Proud Mary: open chord and barre chord rhythm, solos in d pentatonic contain slides, hammer ons,and chicken pickin'
Surfin' U.S.A. - rhythm using 10 bar blues structure
My Girl - Bar chords, (you also learn how they use a key change in the middle of the song; that was new for me)
Wild Thing - power chords, very simple
Pipeline - (surf guitar) palm muting, single note melody in e minor
No Particular Place to Go - probably the most challenging piece on this dvd. Augmented chords, Chuck Berry blues/rock licks in g pentatonic, the solo is pretty fast for a beginner/intermediate player. Lots of bends and slides.",1331424000,,1341,4.568464730290456
