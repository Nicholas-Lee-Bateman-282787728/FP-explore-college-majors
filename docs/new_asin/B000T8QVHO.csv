8208118,5,B000T8QVHO,"This documentary is from 2001 but even after so many years, it's still very interesting and a good picture of what child beauty pageants are like. This is the precursor to shows like TLC's Toddlers and Tiaras. Swan Brooner is so adorable, not spoiled or bratty. I am impressed by the ability of these young children to entertain and remember routines...they display such polish.",1346025600,2,378,4.921875
