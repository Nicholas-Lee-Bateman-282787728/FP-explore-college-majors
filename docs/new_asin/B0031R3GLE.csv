8387171,3,B0031R3GLE,"What's going on with all the recent Hong Kong productions with similar story lines spoofing their own historic action martial arts flicks? As an example see the deeper & more polished ""Just Another Pandora's Box"".

Negatives: A little too superficial writing, editing & filming in this, a little-too-timeworn-slapstick, comedy that does the usual retelling of Chinese history and martial arts movies. The spoofs of Andy Lau, Jet Li and Jackie Chan as singer, monk and clothier while novel were not developed as well as they could have been. Everything from storytelling to acting to martial arts scenes seemed a little too rushed.

Positives: Interesting ideas for the acting and lookalike spoofs of the above mentioned actors. Good, although nothing new, wire flying. Good Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider type maze. Pace Wu. The spade (hoe) moral at the end was a nice twist. Even more so if it's past and future story could have been developed further.

Neutral: A few, sort of, funnies. Good to see English subtitles in"" Extras"" although they need to proofread errors such as the following Pace Wu comment ""doing a TV soup opera"".",1285718400,,1127,5.048387096774194
