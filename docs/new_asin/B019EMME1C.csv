I was a little hesitant to buy it due to some bad reviews claiming that DVD didn't work appropriately but mine worked perfectly all the songs are there and the quality of the sound and image are impeccable. I would recommend this product to anyone either starting or professional guitarists will learn a lot from this!!",1509408000,2,407,4.746478873239437
8744990,1,B019EMME1C,"I bought this from another retailer and only 6 of the 12 songs will play. I called them, they sent me a second disk but it was messed up as well. It appears to be production defect.",1464912000,,181,3.918918918918919

8744992,5,B019EMME1C,"As with all Doug's Play-Along DVDs, this is no exception, he clearly explains everything you need to play each song, as well as giving you a mini history of each song and any tips to help you play the song.
You want to learn Hendrix, this is top notch.  Doesn't matter if you are a beginner or advanced guitar god, this will work for you.
Beginner? Run this at half-speed and review often.  Anyone can learn Hendrix with this DVD, it's simple, easy and clear.

I read the other two reviews, (one is deleted now) warning about how the DVD is bad and doesn't work.  I'm here to tell you I went thru every inch of this DVD and there is absolutely no issues with playback, so they must have recalled/fixed the first generation DVDs.

I did notice on the halleonard(.)com site this is listed as Vol 44, but it shows 41 everywhere else.

If you want to learn Hendrix, this is the DVD for you.

Songs include;
All Along the Watchtower
Can You See Me
Crosstown Traffic
Fire
Foxey Lady
Hey Joe
Manic Depression
Purple Haze
Red House
Remember
Stone Free
The Wind Cries Mary",1463788800,,1063,4.392857142857143
