If you are trying to make a comedy or even have funny moments in your film to lighten up the mood, then this class will teach you how! I use to think humor was hard until I started seeing how to break down funny scenes in other movies the way this class does. You can then change the ideas to make new ones for your own films.

Humor is like building a funny ""muscle"" and this class helps you to get a handle on how the whole funny thing works. This DVD does not have as many cuts as the other ones but it says on the website that there is new version with more cuts coming soon. If you are new to the DVD class this one may seem a bit strange as a stand alone since there are just lists and lists of funny techniques you build up in each of your 40 plot point scenes.

Ace Ventura Pet Detective When Nature Calls is broken down in many of the examples which helped me to get how those movies work. Lots of Southpark examples too. You learn how to understand other filmmakers humor styles and create your own.",1277856000,,1083,4.0514018691588785
8311418,5,B001IV61EE,"This video gives you 100+ tips on making funny moments in your animation or film. If you have been following along with the other videos you just fill in a humor technique or several for each scene. They sort of build up and create a bunch of little funny moments. You also learn how to spot humor techniques in other films to use in your own.

This class made making funny films much more simple for me. If you use each of the techniques she tells you to you will end up with a funny story. That said, there are not as many graphics on the screen as in the earlier videos but you can read all of the techniques in the workbook you use to follow along. Humor is hard for most writers and this class makes it less challenging for the naturally unfunny group. At least it did for me.",1244332800,,781,4.1381578947368425
8311419,2,B001IV61EE,"I don't like to give so few stars to someone else's effort, but I found this DVD boring to the tilt.
Mostly a woman's face (maybe the author?) telling and/or reading to us of all kinds of ""funny"" things to insert in a script: Funny names, funny existing places, funny wardrobes, funny situations, and so on. When the woman's face is not on the screen, we see uninteresting shots of babies or people in ridiculous dresses. WOW!
I am giving  more than one star as someone else may find the above very original for a funny script.",1244073600,3,527,4.43298969072165
