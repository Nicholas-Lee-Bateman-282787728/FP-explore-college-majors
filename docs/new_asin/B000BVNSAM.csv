2443345,4,B000BVNSAM,"While I am glad there's a company releasing films like this in the USA now, I have a concept I would like to share with the discerning reader, and following reviewers of this DVD: THIS ISN'T A KUNG FU FILM. Really.

I sincerely hope that Image will figure out a better way to market the films they put out than slapping ""KUNG FU"" all over the place, and writing a press release that gives a mistaken impression also...unless of course, it IS in fact, a Kung Fu film!

This film is properly described as ""Wuxia"" or Swordplay genre. This is the 21st century, let's start getting this stuff straightened out finally, OK? One reviewer here, however much they are a Kung Fu film fan, needs to go do a little reading-up on the history of HK/Taiwanese cinema before doing writeups...no offense.

The film, which is unfortunately without original language and english subtitles, is a fairly average example of this genre, which in the early 70's was still without developed choreo, wirework, and effects that were so dominant in the late 70's and early 80's films (and later, in the over-the-top ones of the 1990's New Wave era) BUT i'll give them credit - they used what they had, and did the best they could. Obviously a low budget Taiwanese film, it will be fairly entertaining if you enjoy, say, swashbucklers, or are familiar with this genre, but if you were expecting ""Enter the Dragon"" or ""Venoms"" quality fight choreography, well, sorry! That's a different animal entirely...

As most of the old school Wuxia films are not yet available in the US (unless you're hip to Shaw Brothers and Celestial Pictures' remastered DVDs, and online Asian retailers) this might be a good place to start though IF you haven't seen King Hu's ""A Touch Of Zen"".  Miramax is STILL sitting on some dozens of classic Wuxia and Kung Fu films that they had purchased a few years ago, which is a shame really, THOSE would be the best example of this sort of film for you to look at...

Well, aside from any of King Hu's work outside of Shaw that is.

Also, keep an eye on Image, as I understand they are looking to start bringing out other examples of HK films from the Shaw Brothers (FINALLY!) in the USA, possibly with your choice of Original language and English dubs, and English Subtitles as well. This one, well...Points for putting it out at all, albeit

8093316,3,B000BVNSAM,"Id prefer to focus on the audio commentary for the FEARLESS FIGHTERS DVD because it offers a very instructive look at the art of film distribution, dubbing and marketing in the U.S. back in the 1970s, when numerous foreign genre films got dubbed into English and distributed to neighborhood theaters, grindhouses and drive-ins throughout the country. At the time FEARLESS FIGHTERS came out, such venues were awash in English-dubbed kung fu films from Hong Kong, following the success in the U.S. of FIVE FINGERS OF DEATH (released by Warner Bros. in March 1973) and the early Bruce Lee films, FISTS OF FURY and THE CHINESE CONNECTION (both distributed in the spring of 1973 by National General). Richard Ellman, the distributor of FEARLESS FIGHTERS, and Dick Brummer, who edited the U.S. release version and helped Ellman oversee the English dubbing, provide the commentary and discuss the whole process of finding the film and figuring out how to prepare it for the American market. They made a point of recruiting Chinese-American film actor James Hong (who has been acting steadily since 1955) to hire a cast of Asian-American actors to do the dub voices and help in the rewriting of the script. Yet, Ellman acknowledges doing a lot of the voices himself and even recruited Caucasian character actor Charles Napier to do some voices, so they were not all Asian voices.

As a longtime fan of Hong Kong films who prefers English subtitled versions of original Mandarin and Cantonese language prints of classic kung fu films, I was dismayed to hear the two men talk in such a cavalier fashion about cutting dialogue scenes out of the film that explained the characters relationships, since Im so used to seeing such scenes in historical Chinese adventures and being guided through the interlocking relationships and getting greater insight into Chinese history and culture as a result. To remove such scenes might quicken the pace and punch up the action, but it also undercuts whatever characterization might have existed in the original script. The two men also relate how they renamed all the characters and came up with new phrases to describe the weapons and martial arts techniques the characters use. I, for one, would prefer to have heard the original names used. One female character is named Mulan, for instance, and Im assuming that name was picked to reference the famous female warrior of that name in Chinese folklore. Since theres been a Disney animated feature devoted to the character (MULAN, 1998), made since FEARLESS FIGHTERS but before this commentary was recorded, I would think that Ellman would have made the connection between the two in his commentary, but the subject is never raised.

I understand the needs of the market at the time and the prevailing mindset that any strategy was fair game to make a foreign film attractive to theater owners throughout the U.S. This wasn't an art film and it wasn't aimed at discriminating audiences the way later releases like CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON were. After all, more than one Godzilla film was completely re-edited with newly shot footage before being released in the U.S., so Im not criticizing Ellman and Brummer for their decisions. In fact, its very clear from listening to them that they had, and still have, great affection for the film and were genuinely excited about their work on it and getting it out to audiences. Not many distributors in the exploitation market had that much regard for their product, so it is a rare treat to hear from one who did.

One aspect of the commentary that should amuse longtime fans of Hong Kong films is the insistence by Ellman and Brummer that the films use of strong female swordfighting characters was something of a first and may have influenced later films like CROUCHING TIGER and HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS. Even though Ellmans remarks on this may be tongue-in-cheek, it does show a limited knowledge of the martial arts genre in Hong Kong and Chinese cinema, since female swordfighters were a staple of these films at least since the 1920s!",1431216000,,4068,4.944444444444445

8093319,5,B000BVNSAM,"The 1st thing I intend to write about this film is that it is one of those entertaining gems from the golden age of the 1970's that you cannot pass up if you are a hard core Kung Fu Fan.  I was very lucky enough to catch this wonder when it came out in 1973-4. After Bruce Lee had kicked and quickly died, U.S distributors were trying to cash in as fast as they could on the '' Kung Fu Craze''. I still remember being 10 years old and since this was an rated R film, I had to beg my Dad take me. Big mistake. He never took me to another one again, Lol.

That was okay, I snuck into most of the films back then anyway. I can still hear my Dad complaining about the actors '' Flying over Mountains and Rivers'' and that is not far from the truth. This film has an amazing array of sword fights and ''trampoline Fu'' that will def wet your appetite. The wire acts and reverse film footage was in full effect here and will not disappoint.

I'm sure you thought you would get a full review of the film, but I think you should hear it from a fans point of view. I must say that this film is entertaining and you will def get your money's worth. It should be noted that this film  along with 5 Fingers of Death was one of the 1st to hit the U.S. shores and be part of Kung Fu Lore.

Enjoy. I know I have for almost 40 years now...",1265846400,,1323,3.921641791044776
8093320,4,B000BVNSAM,"No, it is not the finest movie ever made, but this movie is awesome for what it is.  Tired of movies with stinky plots, slow parts, art scenes, character development?  Look no further -- this movies has NONE of that.  It is PURE FIGHTING.  Oh sure, there is a vague plot, but you won't make sense of it until halfway through the movie.  There was even a 38 second romantic interlude followed immediately by fighting.  There are absurd jumps (literally) where the action moves from one locale to another.  If you are looking for a movie that is easy on the brain, look no further.

If you want something a bit more cerebral, try to figure out what is going on.  When they fight a group of, well, random guys, one of them runs off to warn the evil leader.  The good guys are headed towards that same evil leader.  The bad guy takes roughly 2 minutes to get there and he is injured.  The bad guy leader has enough time to put a contract on somebody's head, hire a killer army, and set up ambushes.  Meanwhile, the good guys take a full day to get there.  There is plenty more where that came from.

Sit back and enjoy!",1187308800,2,1115,4.267942583732057
8093321,4,B000BVNSAM,"Back in the early 1970s independent distributor Richard Ellman and film editor Richard Brummer presented American audiences released this Chinese made nugget titled Fearless Fighters, originally released in 1973 by an entity called Sun Wah Motion Picture Company, with the American version released in 1974.  I know not who wrote, directed, or even starred in this film, but I will tell you this, I thought it a lot of fun, and worthwhile to anyone who digs on old school martial arts 'B' films featuring a whole lot of crazy, high flying action.

As the story begins we see a man practicing his martial arts skills by throttling a tree, collecting the leaves that fall on his sword blade, and then using said leaves much like one would use throwing stars, impaling them into a target, in this case, a tree, possibly the same one from whence the leaves came, I don't know, but I digress...cut to a convoy, lead by an elderly man on horseback.  Some highwaymen appear, and we learn they're members of the Eagle Claw fighting clan.  Seems the convoy is carrying a shipment of royal gold intended for distribution to the poor, and the fighting clan, lead by an odious fellow, aims to procure the goods...not very honorable, but soon enough we're knee deep into a fight sequence and we see the old man, who's actually the `All Mighty Imperial Lighting Whip', opens a six-pack of whupazz, as his whip skills are quite impressive (one might even go so far as to say they're da bomb).  He manages to fend them off, but the clan returns in greater numbers (and with archers), eventually taking the gold and leaving the old man mortally wounded.  Now, the man we saw at the beginning, whose name is something like Napalm (at least that what I kept hearing...actually, it might have been Lei Pong), who is a member of the Eagle Claw fighting clan, being the decent, honorable fellow he is, tries to get his fellow clan members to return the gold and cop to their crimes, but they're having none of that as they frame him, get him arrested, and kill Napalm's entire family (in an effort to get rid of any witnesses), except for his annoying, young son whom I've dubbed `the boy of never ending tears' given his penchant for the waterworks (thankfully, he's not in the movie all that much).  Now the old man with the whip bites its, but not before relating what happened to his son and daughter, both of whom team up with Napalm, break him out of jail, hook up with another sword wielding female who looks like a flying nun, all in an effort to retrieve the stolen gold and seek revenge on the clan what caused all the trouble in the first place.  But wait, the evil clan isn't just sitting around counting their dough (actually, they are), but realizing the impending danger, they go ahead and hire the most ruthless killers they can find, creating a veritable army of bloodthirsty cutthroats this side of the Yangtze River.  Oh yeah, it's go time all right...

Now I'll admit, I don't know the various, different types of martial arts films from a hole in the ground, but I know what I like, and I really dug this film.  Perhaps it was the fact that you couldn't go five minutes without a fast and furious fight sequence breaking out, but it was more than that...how could you not enjoy a film with characters with names like Soul Picker, One Man Army, Solar Ray of Death, and Dragon Razor?  Well, I suppose you could, if it were poorly done, but I didn't feel that the case here.  Most of the action involves the use of weapons, swords, pole arms, spears, whips, bow and arrows, throwing knives, hand claws, along with some unusual pieces like short, curved handheld blades referred to as flying sparrows, and shiny sewer cover sized discs used not only to try and slice opponents, but also to focus and reflect the sun into powerful blasts capable of great damage (perhaps not as effective at night...moon power seems a lot less menacing than sun power, unless you're talking in terms of vampires or werewolves).  Also we see items one might normal not associate with as being weapons used as such, including leaves, hats, cups, etc.  On the wacky side there's even one character in the film who becomes seriously injured, and has some of his limbs replaced with mechanical type, spring loaded replicas, ones which he can launch and do critical damage to an enemies guts....woo hoo!  The Six Million Yen Man...anyway, as I said, the action is virtually non-stop throughout, and, at least I thought, done very well.  Most of the characters seem to have crazy go nuts, superpower-like abilities in that they can jump up mountain sides or across lakes, and some can even catch arrows shot at them and throw them back at the archer with such force and accuracy as to kill (there's a great scene where an old man catches a number of arrows shot at him, mostly in his hands, and one in his mouth).  I lost count of how many people got killed in this movie, but I'd guess it was near the triple digits as often we'd see a large number of enemies surround a hero character, only to quickly get pared down due to the awesoma skills of the protagonist.  Some of the weapons didn't look entirely realistic (some swords had the appearance of being made of wood and covered in foil), but the actual fighting and stunt work looked pretty amazing to me, and one could tell the performers were highly trained in their various crafts.  Heck, there are even a handful of bloody deaths, if you're into that sort of thing.  There is a story present, one that does get a little convoluted at times, but overall I felt it was easy to follow, and didn't suffer overly from the introduction of pointless and unrelated elements, as I've seen in other films of this type.  Once in awhile the transitioning from scene to scene seems a little awkward as things don't always jibe, but overall things work out well.  The one aspect that was the goofiest to me was the dialog, specifically in using a very westernized manner of speech during the dubbing of the film.  If possible, I'll choose to watch a movie like this with its original audio, and use English subtitles, but that's not an option here as all that's available is the track created for the American release of the feature.

This DVD release of Fearless Fighters marks Image Entertainment's first foray into releasing martial arts films, and I hope they continue, as the widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic presentation is very good.  The picture does have wear, but overall it seemed very clean, and the Dolby Digital audio comes on strong.  As far as extras, there's a very worthwhile and entertaining commentary track featuring Richard Ellman, the distributor who brought this film from China, and editor Richard Brummer, who was responsible for editing the American release of the movie.  Also included is a rough looking theatrical trailer (with optional commentary from Ellman and Brummer!).  As an added bonus, there was a mail-in questionnaire card inside the DVD case, one that states if returned, Image would send back a 16"" by 24"" poster, featuring the same artwork used on the cover of the DVD case for the film.  I mailed the card in and the poster came within a week.
