8406823,2,B003VI2J34,"I guess you could call this an ""I spit on your grave ripoff"" except there is no nudity. There is gore and the acting and story are pretty good. I saw this movie cut on SYFY and then the DVD and there was really no difference",1479772800,3,224,3.891304347826087

8406826,4,B003VI2J34,"A solid slasher film from Norway. The argument is taken, apparently without authorization or credit, from the US slasher I spit on your grave (1978). It is competently made (despite its almost zero budget) and it held my attention for an hour and a half despite seeing it late at night, when I was ready to go to bed. The plot: A young woman returns to her rural hometown for an unspecified reason; soon she is harassed in the remote house where she stays by two young men she knew from her childhood (there are some issues about something that happened in the past between them, but I never made sense of them and I honestly don't think they are that important). Eventually, these men (the Norwegian equivalent of rednecks) enter her house and brutally rape her. Her even more brutal revenge on them is the movie's final act. Featuring a hand held camera, editing tricks and amateurish acting (the main actress, reportedly a famous porn star in Norway, is quite effective in her role) is a good example of a slasher film, not particularly original but very effective",1419897600,5,1067,4.650793650793651
8406827,4,B003VI2J34,"I purchased 'Hora' (= Norwegian for 'whore') because I wanted to know what Norwegian grindhouse looks like. And yes, the cover of its DVD-box looks cheap, carrying slogans like 'low budget', and 'the best in bad bad taste'.

So I prepared for just another horror movie badly put together. With terrible acting, keeping itself alive on abundant ultra-violence, sex and nudity. What I got was a coherent plot, gradually & cleverly building up towards its gruesome climaxes. All in a very Norwegian setting, warming up everyone familiar with this country. With pretty adequate acting throughout. And featuring a lead-girl that isn't particularly beautiful, but surely knows how make this film work.

Given these qualities, I think it too cheap to label 'Hora' as a rip-off. Its good Norwegian horror keeps you tensely on your seat from start to finish. At times its fluent passing-by of pictures is interrupted, or switches from color to black & white and back. Just to allow you a few seconds to recover.",1328572800,5,1002,4.994011976047904
8406828,1,B003VI2J34,Don't be fooled this is nothing but a foreign version of (I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE)AKA(DAY OF THE WOMAN).But it's worth a watch because the girl in this film is smoking hot.,1321056000,2,169,4.3125
