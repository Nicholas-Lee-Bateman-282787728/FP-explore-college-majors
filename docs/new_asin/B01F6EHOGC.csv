I always found it hard to watch this season, because some of the episodes are just too silly. Two Episodes that really stand out, are ""The Gay Bar"", and ""78 Musical"".  The other episode that made me laugh and cry at the same time, was the 3 part Series Finale, ""Maudes Big Move.""  In any regard, I do highly recommend that you purchase this season. Although not as great as others, this season still has Maude doing her same liberal progressive things! Even if you don't like this season, purchase for completeness. The BEST seasons were 3-5 with the incomparable Hermione Baddeley as Mrs. Nell Naugatuck. She should have stayed through Season 6 as well! She was always my favorite character, besides the lovely Bea Arthur starring as Maude Findlay. Buy this set! You won't regret it!",1473206400,2,939,4.616766467065868
8760258,4,B01F6EHOGC,"For those who didn't spring for the fantastic Deluxe Complete Series in early 2015, we have finally arrived at the finish line for the individual season releases of MAUDE. While not up to par with the stellar fifth year, Season Six suffers from the recasting and re-imagining of two regular characters, and the tone of the show is taking on a more traditional sitcom feel than the theatrical beginnings it boasted in earlier seasons. Marlene Warfield, who made her debut at the end of Season Five as new housekeeper Victoria Butterfield, is not living up to her potential and does not show any of the spunk demonstrated in her terrific premiere episode. The recasting of grandson Philip with the cherub-faced, sweet-tempered Kraig Metzinger is a misstep as the character is no longer the mischievous, smartass foil for Maude that Brian Morrison portrayed so wonderfully.

The season opens strong with MAUDES GUILT TRIP, one of the funniest and wittiest episodes of the entire series. It concerns the arrival of Maudes insufferable Aunt Tinkie, whose plane crashes en route to the Findlays right after she spitefully takes out a life insurance policy to make Maude feel bad. Bea is brilliant as she vacillates between guilt over Tinkies death and giddy delight over using the blood money to take a coveted trip to Rome. The only other truly classic episode this season is THE GAY BAR that starts doing business in town, which has conservative Arthur (Conrad Bain) crusading to shut it down, but not before liberal Maudie drags him there for some enlightenment, to hilarious results.

The remainder of the season has some very good episodes, but they pale a bit in comparison with some of the excellence of Seasons 1, 2, 3 and 5. Fan-fave MUSICAL 78 is undoubtedly the best of the telethon/variety/talent show offerings due in large part to the character of bratty, not-so-wheelchair-bound child star Baby Sally and Maudes reactions to her. VIVIANS DECISION is a great showcase for the wonderful Rue McClanahan and the three-part season finale MAUDES BIG MOVE set the stage for the revamped format that was not to be. The ratings dropped to a dismal 66th place in the Neilsens so the series was essentially cancelled, but CBS let Bea bow out gracefully.

The show is starting to look tired and some cracks are beginning to show, but I still recommend this final season because on a bad day MAUDE still outshines todays sitcoms at their best.",1462665600,8,2439,4.900726392251816
