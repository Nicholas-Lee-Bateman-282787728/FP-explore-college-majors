1786388,3,B00006LPH9,"This movie comes up wanting in my opinion.  The story line was okay in it's intent but lacks in it's production.  There was a bit more language than was necessary.  My favorite star ended up on the wrong side though, I believe he felt he was the right way to bring about peace that he was after.  There is violence in it too much for my grand-kids.  Parents should preview it first.",1363132800,,382,4.25
1786389,5,B00006LPH9,"Sci-Fi b movie, solid plot and decent acting. Good movie for a snowy or rainy night with popcorn and a few hours to kill. Give it a go, for the price its a deal.",1358985600,,161,3.764705882352941
1786390,1,B00006LPH9,The plot was so convoluted you were never sure what the all drama was about. It started out OK but the ending was lame...,1354320000,,121,4.083333333333333
1786391,4,B00006LPH9,I had never heard of this movie but have heard of the 2 main actors.  This is deffenetly a different kind of movie.  I enjoyed it.  I would reccomment it.,1351987200,,154,4.066666666666666
1786392,3,B00006LPH9,I must say that this is one of the  weakest  movies that I have seen Dean Cain in.  While some of the Special effects are not bad the story line is  pretty bad. I would avoid this movie.,1322438400,,186,3.8157894736842106
1786393,1,B00006LPH9,"Dean Cain made a pretty cool Superman in Lois & Clark, and he did okay in an episode of Smallville. In general
this movie reminded me of ""Red Dawn"" in the rebellion stages  and so forth, ""Red Dawn"" was much better. It was really hard to believe that this story took place in a galaxy far away and all that, every scene outside looked Canadian or northern US. I will probably avoid any more Dean Cain movies after seeing this one. Seemed like a lot of bit part semi-stars that I see in a lot  movies and TV shows, but it really lost me. It was really cheap and used and I forced myself and my brother to sit through it to the end. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who really enjoys sience fiction.",1195430400,4,705,4.176470588235294
1786394,5,B00006LPH9,"I loved Starship Troopers and many other movies that have no notariety at all, and now I'll be adding this movie to that list. If you like ""b"" sci-fi movies, then this one will be right down your alley! Sure the acting isn't top par, but the sets and CGI make up for any of that. Worth a watch if you like these kind of movies, but if all you like are the multimillion dollar movies such as the StarWars franchise, then pass on it.",1157328000,12,431,4.08235294117647
1786395,4,B00006LPH9,"I liked this movie, but truthfully I think what I liked the best was seeing Jimmy Olson and Clark Kent from an alternate universe.  NOT that I am saying that this is what the movie is about, but I think for fans of 'Lois and Clark' that is what you might be thinking in the back of your mind.",1135641600,5,292,3.9491525423728815
1786396,1,B00006LPH9,possibly the worst film i have ever seen. do not buy it it is rubbish. looks like it has been filmed by a bunch of 10 year olds.,1080086400,5,128,3.607142857142857
1786397,1,B00006LPH9,"... The grotesque dialogue and meandering plotline offer nothing to the viewer more than possible gastro-intestinal problems. This is not even a film that could entice fans of ""quality"" B-flicks for the sake of amusement. I, personally, enjoyed the Evil Dead series, Killer Klownz from Outer Space and eagerly anticipate watching Sgt. Kabuki-man, NYPD. I'm not certain I could watch this movie again even if shown as part of an Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode (which I enjoy also). ...
 That said, it's a sci-fi flick without any coherant plot wherein even the slightly well-known actors display acting skills on par with the last elementary-school play you've been to. I sincerely believe that any actor of any standing in this movie was blackmailed to appear in it. If you want comparatively quality movie-watching, watch USA-network movies, the series VIP or any porno you can think of....",1050192000,7,897,5.1438356164383565

7972159,2,B00006LPH9,"This picture has some good cast members and a few good scenes and very respectable special effects. Some of the early dialog is OK too. Yet, the plot makes no sense. My guess is that this is a film based on a video game (or comic book). Regrettably, it does not work.",1403568000,,267,4.153846153846154
7972160,4,B00006LPH9,If I could I would give this movie three and a half stars.  That is it's worth watching. The problem seems to be that another better movie was made and this was made out of the scraps from that other better movie. Otherwise it's O;K. and I did like it.,1385596800,,252,4.04
7972161,2,B00006LPH9,"This was a very(BAD) movie the plot was stupid the acting was terrible and it just didn't make any sense. One of the worst movies I have ever seen, I would not recommend it to anyone.",1373760000,,183,4.111111111111111
7972162,1,B00006LPH9,"If I hadn't seen with my own eyes that Miramax was associated with this film, I would not have believed it possible whichever of its owners were in control. Skimming through some of the reviews, I found that some of the actors and actresses are professionally employed in known productions. I guess that the weight of a dead script and direction can create leaden  performances from even people who are accepted as qualified to do more than high school productions.
I see some reviewers believe otherwise, so I will simply refer the reader to them with the unnecessary (I'm sure) admonition that tastes vary in this caveat emptor (buyer beware) buying world.
If you are persuaded to buy the film, I would advise buying (with Amazon Prime) the '10 Movie Sci-Fi Pack' for under five dollars and getting nine other movies with it.",1373068800,,827,4.783216783216783
7972163,3,B00006LPH9,"Final Encounter (also known in some markets as ""For the Cause"") reunites Lois and Clark alums Dean Cain and Justin Whalin as futuristic soldiers on a distant, war-torn planet. Their nation of Brecca has almost crumbled under the offensive of the rival city-state Obsidian (each side being companies responsible for colonizing the world) and is now little more than a handfull of paramilitary encampments scavenging the ruins of their own society. Teaming with a motley crew of commandos, including two ""programmers"" (all-female users of all-but-forgotten mental projection technology who are analogous to witches in the film's neo-feudal society) they embark on a quest to deliver an electronic countermeasure that will disable Obsidian's advanced technology.

This plot is a lot to swallow, and that is really the film's main sticking point. We are asked to assimilate volumes of lore, some of it presented only very briefly, in order to understand a planetary history spanning over a century of politicking and war. It's a rich, inventive history, but the film just can't express it well enough in its running time to make us care. That's too bad, because there is a lot about Encounter to enjoy.

First of all, the cinematography is aces. The rugged countryside and crumbling post-soviet architecture of Bulgaria are used to brilliant, Tarkovsky-esque effect to convey the idea of a modern society in ruins. Costuming is a believable mix of futuristic and contemporary. Weapons seem sophisticated, but not so much so as to be silly. And the effects, for such a modestly budgeted film, are quite good- about on par with the Stargate TV series, to which this film is contemporary. Some of the cyberpunk ""magic"" the programmers display is a little fake looking, however, and in crowd scenes the actors are not directed well in reacting to CG.

Second, the acting is quite good. Cain and Whalin have made careers in TV and direct-to-video schlock, but their performances here (alongside a similarly talented cast) remind the viewer that these actors were once considered rising stars until an inability to escape TV (Cain) and being tied to the horrible Dungeons and Dragons film for 7 years (Whalin) doomed them to the B list.

Final Encounter is not at all a bad film, but its tremendous ambition just barely exceeds its grasp. It could have made a deeply compelling TV series, and with more money and a more spaced out plot it might have been a really brilliant film. It's still worth your time if you're a fan of other clever budget sci fi, like Hardware, Screamers, Hunter Prey, or even (dare I say it) Krull, all of which it resembles. Just prepare to be disappointed at what it could have been.

PROS
-Good performances
-Above average effects
-Strong attempt at original worldbuilding
-Great locations

CONS
-Too much lore for one film to fit
-Effects just try TOO hard in places
-Action sequences are a little confusing in places",1371600000,3,2936,4.981632653061224
7972164,2,B00006LPH9,"OMG, was my reaction to this movie.  Was it supposed to be thought provoking in some way? The movie was poorly filmed technically and made minimal sense.  It was one of those movies that you watch to answer the question as to why it was even made.  You'd think with the money I'm sure went into it, they could have done better.",1367452800,,327,4.241935483870968
