8254819,4,B0014AX80Y,"Like the other reviewer, I mostly bought this for the ""Night at the Museum"" movie which is a decent, but not great movie which my kids love.  The other movies were fair, but considering the price, the pack was certainly worth it.

Next, these movies seem to come boxed as a ""3-pack"", not for individual sale and from some sort of free giveaway with purchase of an HDTV.  2 of the 3 had real UPC codes.

My only real gripe about this set was the case/box for ""Night at the Museum"".  They put security seals on all 3 sides.  Unfortunately, the glue on the seals (which doesn't really stick to the case plastic) bonds to the vinyl cover window, and it is impossible to remove without destroying the case.  Thus, if you are a neat-freak, you will have to find another case.  Also, these could be a bit old as the ""security device"" on Invincible had become unglued and was actually stuck on the disc (but easily removed without incident).

Finally, the seller sneakapeaka shipped very quickly.  No complaints about the seller.",1257120000,2,1021,4.56043956043956
8254820,5,B0014AX80Y,"I was able to get the 3 pack for just a little more $$ than just the price of ""Night At The Museum"" (which was the one I wanted). It shipped fast, and I had it 3 days later (Sat & Sun included).",1240790400,2,194,3.5348837209302326
