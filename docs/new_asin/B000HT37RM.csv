8141105,5,B000HT37RM,"Dr. Blaylock delivers an excellent lecture in this video, complete with studies and evidence cited that support his claim that artificial ingredients in food are crippling our brains and influencing our behavior.

Since watching this DVD I have purchased and read Dr. Blaylock's book ""Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills"".  I am thoroughly convinced that Blaylock is to be trusted as a doctor as well as a scientist and has demonstrated extensive knowledge of both the human brain and the effects of food and food additives on the developing brain and the mature brain.

I recommend this video to any and everyone that has even the slightest care for their health and wellness.  If you have children (I have three toddlers), this DVD is a must see!!!  Do not trust that what billion dollar food corporations put into your food is put there for your benefit.  These additives are included for one purpose only: profit.  And the agencies and offices whom are suppose to protect us from harmful ingredients in our food are bought and owned by the very corporations they are suppose to be critical of.
Bottom line: the effects of these additives are devestating.  Dr. Russell Blaylock has dedicated his life to exposing this tragedy and it is my hope that America will someday wake up.",1260921600,6,1280,4.8663594470046085
