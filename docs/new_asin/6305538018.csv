1044865,3,6305538018,"Existenz is movie set in a virtual world where a game designer is attacked at a game launch and a marketing guy is told to get her out of there to safety, but she won't let him contact their company to tell them where they are or send someone else to protect her, and insists she must get back into the game to save her work.  Because she's hot he of course goes along with her wishes, including getting a game port injected into his spine, which he has deliberately not done in his life up to then.

The movie itself isn't that boring, but I can't imagine anyone actually playing the game the characters go inside, not finding that game where you don't really do anything other than gut animals at a fish factory to be anything but boring as hell.  I can't see this being a top game that anyone would want to kill the game designer over.  It's a 90's movie so there's aspects such as not predicting cordless technology, in this film you attach an umbilical chord looking thing into a port in your back that's somehow connected to your spine and your mind beyond.  There aren't really any special effects as you would expect, there are a lot of realistic looking fake animals with internal organs and liquidy guts that get sliced open constantly or eaten.  But that's where the special effect budget went.

I found the over all movie to be predictable, but that's because so many films have done that, perhaps back in the 90's when this came out that wouldn't be the case.  But viewing it today, it is.",1491868800,,1502,4.397111913357401

1044867,4,6305538018,"""eXistenZ'' arrives a few weeks after ""The Matrix,'' another science-fiction movie about characters who find themselves inside a universe created by virtual reality. ""The Matrix'' is mainstream sci-fi, but ""eXistenZ,'' written by Cronenberg, is much stranger; it creates a world where organic and inorganic are not separate states, but kind of chummy. Consider the scene where an oil-stained grease monkey implants a bio-port in the hero, using a piece of equipment that seems designed to give a lube job to a PeterBilt.

Jennifer Jason Leigh, that fearless adventurer in extreme roles, plays Allegra, whose new game is being marketed by Antenna Research. Jude Law is Ted, the company's marketing trainee. Allegra barely misses being killed during a demonstration of ""eXistenZ,'' when an assassin slips past the metal detectors at the door with a gun made of flesh and blood. Ted helps her escape, and later, when he cuts the bullet out of her shoulder, he discovers it's not a bullet but a ... hmmm, this is interesting ... a human tooth. She decides Ted needs his own bio-port, and looks for a ""country gas station.'' When she finds one (with a sign that says Country Gas Station) we assume they're inside the game, which is why she knows the station's name: She wrote it, and maybe also created its owner, named Gas (Willem Dafoe).
She knows her way around this world and isn't surprised when they're told, ""Look for a Chinese restaurant in the forest--and order the special.'' The owner rattles off the chef's daily selection, explaining that ""mutant reptiles and amphibians produce previously unknown taste sensations.'' But Ted insists on the daily special and gets a dish that's really bony. No wonder. The bones click together into a gun. And soon they visit the Trout Farm, where organic game pods are grown, and come up against Kiri Vinokur (Ian Holm), who's the owner of Cortical Systematics, a rival game firm.

Cronenberg's film is as loaded with special effects as ""The Matrix,'' but they're on a different scale. Many of his best effects are gooey, indescribable organic things, and some of the most memorable scenes involve characters eating things that surgeons handle with gloves on. He places his characters in a backwoods world that looks like it was ordered over the phone from L.L. Bean. Then he frames them with visuals where half the screen is a flat foreground that seems to push them toward us, while the other half is a diagonal sliding off alarmingly into the background.

""eXistenZ'' is likely to appeal especially to computer game players, since it's familiar with that world and speculates on its future development. Allegra explains to Ted such phenomena as ""genuine game urges''-- ""something your game character was born to do.'' She regards her programming handiwork with musings like, ""I've devoted five of my most passionate years to this strange little creature.'' At one point she's alarmed to discover, ""I'm locked outside my own $38 million game!'' And without the password, it looks like neither she nor anyone else can get back inside. What? You mean she didn't back up her disc?",1487808000,,3121,4.998076923076923

Its an interesting take on VR (although the idea that some people might take such a drastic stance towards the technology is a little hard to swallow), and the surreal, twisted journey through reality is compelling to watch even if its a theme that has been covered many times before and since. Its also visually inventive and very funny at times. Its true to say that its not Cronenbergs best but its still a must for fans and gamers alike.

This film was made in 1999 so the directing style, the feel, the story line all fits in that category.  If this film was remade today I think it would have a few different ways of telling the story, and/or different scenes etc.  If you are into westworld, matrix, Philip K Dick, science fiction this film is awesome.  Enjoy the story, it may have some interesting ways of connecting characters, but as an avid PKD fan this film is really amazing compared to similar titles.

1045011,3,6305538018,"While eXistenZ is just another video game movie where two people are stuck in a virtual reality world, this one is executed differently.  It's about Jennifer Jason Leigh's character who's apparently a genius video game designer, and she has a new cutting edge type of video game technology that involves some kind of injection in the spine.  It's all so very confusing (*very* confusing for 98% of it) that it's hard to tell what's going on most of the time.  Jude Law is a video game lover who's afraid of the back shot at first, but eventually gives in and accepts the injection so he too can be part of some of the most realistic gaming imaginable.  This is when Jude and Jennifer go off on an adventure after a shooting escape.  A minor theme is that everyone wants to kill Jennifer's character because there's a 5 million dollar award for doing so.

Everything about the story is just totally confusing.  We're often not sure if we're watching reality or the two characters stuck inside a video game.  Strangely the game controllers are gooey, slimy and blob-shaped, and there's so much of this story that makes little sense such as Jude and Jennifer having hot romance because they think they're in a video game, attachable guns to ""kill"" their victims, Jennifer forming a double-headed nicely animated small reptile creature at a gas station, shooting a Chinese waiter, eating slimy delicious reptile food, umbilical tentacle cord insertions, and later explosions, fires and gunmen running around a log cabin/forest area.

I've played video games for 25 years and I honestly have no idea what just occurred, haha.  So your guess is as good as mine!  I think the biggest issue is that the virtual world looks exactly like the real world, so it's hard to figure out what's going on.  I did like one scene that reminds me of several Playstation 1 games (Spyro the Dragon in particular).  When you can be standing right next to a character but you have to actually talk to them, otherwise they'll daydream in la-la land and pretend you're not even there.  There's a scene where a similar instance occurs.

There are twists at the end, but they're the kind of twists you'd expect.  The ones that question reality from the gaming world, so of course the conclusion isn't going to make sense and I honestly don't think it's trying to make sense.  It wants you to guess if all this was part of the ultra realistic gaming experience or actual reality.  I can forgive the confusion to some extent because this movie came out in 1999 when video gaming really was going for a much bigger/grander type of experience so eXistenZ came out at exactly the right time in gaming history, but eh... this storyline tends to drag and never make sense.  I thought there'd be monsters but no, nothing like that.  Just Jude and Jennifer sorting their way through a world of confusion.  Then again maybe it's making fun of the many 3D games I've played that do the same thing- show a realistic setting but are slow and boring to travel with confusing stories!  Those tricky movie writers, haha!",1440547200,2,3075,4.697761194029851

1045169,5,6305538018,"I am one of those people that likes some but not all, of David Cronenberg's movies. For example, I dislike M butterfly and Dead Ringers. However, my favorite movie of his is a more mainstream movie, The Dead Zone.  My next favorite movie of his is this movie Existenz, which questions what is real or not real while playing games. The gaming pods in this movie are directly attached to your spinal cord. Man in the future has learned to use the flesh and bone from animals to create gaming pods that make you feel you are gaming in your mind. This is not one of Cronenberg's mainstream movies but is without question Cronenberg. For example it has his signature flesh, bone and blood images thrown right in your face. He could have left all the blood and bone out and it still would have been a great movie but Cronenberg wants to make sure we are watching one of his movies.

The best part of this movie is how it truly questions what is real and not real. Everyone games in this movie, not just younger people but grandparents as well. Our future society in this movie has become pathetic in its dependence on games and game reality and strikes a much deeper and scarier cord concerning our dependence on games today, as this movie was released in 1999. About half way through the movie Jenifer Jason Lee, tells Jude Law at a deserted ski lodge that people no longer ski physically, it is done all in the mind.  The only real difference in this movie and our dependence on games today is our weight problems, something Cronenberg could not foresee 1998-99.

This is not an action movie or it is not full of CGI but it is a movie that requires you to sit still and watch its story unfold. I liked it better this time, 14 years later because game reality is starting  to happen now. Death to the game designers we want what is real.",1401580800,6,1832,4.392330383480826

The technology behind Existenz which generates virtual reality have made virtual reality so real that players of Existenz finds it quite addictive and nearly impossible to distinguish it from the real world. Well in this movie not giving away any spoilers but what happens in the beginning pretty much explains the ending and the entire movie. What you have is a bunch of self proclaimed individuals who feels that Existenz have become too much of a threat to the social moral fiber of society and have decided to make themselves judge and executioners by attempting to assassinate those responsible for bringing Existenz into existence.

Unfortunately, the plot itself although intriguing turns out to be very boring and forgettable. It was hard to care anything about any of the characters in the movie. I am not sure where the five stars are coming from but don't be fooled Existenz is a terrible movie. I would recommend a movie called Inception and also a movie called The Thirteenth Floor which I think are much better alternatives to Existenz.

The problem with Existenz is that it tries too hard to be trippy. Its like someone who tries too hard to sing as oppose to singing naturally. In the same way while watching this movie it felt as if the director here was trying too hard to create a trippy movie and in turn ending up with a movie that fell flat. The Director introduces all of these social moral implications about the possible dangers of virtual reality but barely touch upon the subject in the movie. Its as if those subjects were put in there just to give the plot direction and nothing more. The 5 star ratings that this movie have been receiving from others is in comparison to what other movies in the genre.

I really wanted to give it 5 stars but the acting of everyone involved felt like they could have stepped it up a notch.  The varying levels in the story more than make up for it though.  It was a very creative storyline that reminded me of a Mobius Loop.

Be forewarned if dissecting frogs in HS science class turned your stomach, this probably isn't the movie for you because there are some great ""organic"" special effects.  A quintessential David Cronenberg film, a writer/director who is a bit of an acquired taste.  I didn't equate it to The Matrix at all but I can see how some would.

Thanks to the reviewer who said to avoid the Blu-ray.  I did and was happy with the 1.85:1 widescreen format DVD.  It was a solid sharp digital transfer.

I mean, at a real basic level, isn't that what we are all doing in our lives anyway?
And that to me, is the genius of this film. It's a very profound look at life wrapped up in the guise of a virtual reality thriller, and an entertaining one at that. Not only that but it holds up well under repeated viewings.

If you're a fan of this film and want to upgrade to the hi-def picture, you'll be pleased to know that the transfer is superb, adding a level of clarity that adds immensely to the experience. But be warned:  the extras consist only of three interviews (with the two principal actors, and the production director). If you own the original Canadian DVD release, don't part with it, since it contains the director commentary and a 'making of', neither of which are included in this Blu-ray treatment.

That commentary was an invaluable aid, and explains certain directorial decisions that impact the pace and style of acting. For one thing, Cronenberg was inspired by Salman Rushdie, who, as you may recall, was the exiled Persian author marked for assassination by Islamic fundamentalists in the late 90s. Cronenberg took this concept and applied it to a game designer (played here by Jennifer Jason Leigh), who is trapped in her own creation, and winds up in a game of EXistenZ (""capital X and capital Z"", explains the marketing rep), fighting for her life. Another aspect of the production involves the cues taken from early video games, in which characters appear to be catatonic until the others utter a phrase that prompts the required response. For viewers who missed this type of gaming experience, this may come across as bad acting, or a Cronenberg conceit. Of course, it's neither. There are other touches: generic locations labelled COUNTRY GAS STATION, HOTEL, and CHINESE RESTAURANT, which reflect the conventions of early gaming.

Cronenberg was known earlier in his career for emphasizing fleshy horror - exploding heads, dissection, and body metamorphosis. This will surprise viewers who have come to him only recently, in his more mainstream thrillers, 'A History of Violence' and 'Eastern Promises'. With Existenz, we're somewhere in between: Existenz is played by a group who are all connected by a type of fleshy umbilicus. You have to have a bioport installed in your lower spine, and need to purchase a controller that looks more like a mound of flesh than a joystick or mouse. The film is rife with imagery involving 'jacking in' with the ports, and sly body humor. On the other hand, the setting is pure thriller, in its own way.

I follow Cronenberg closely and rank this film in the top 50% of his output, on a par with 'Videodrome', but not quite as satisfying as 'Dead Ringers', and 'Spider', both of which bring in a new level of human tragedy not found in all of Cronenberg's work. (in the former, there's also the magnificent Jeremy Irons in an Oscar-worthy performance).  As far as I know, Existenz is the first Blu-Ray revamping of his earlier films. As other Cronenberg films are upgraded, I'd like to see more of the excellent remastering we have here, without sacrificing the commentary and other features that were so valuable to the overall package.",1356480000,3,2946,4.931451612903226

1045366,5,6305538018,"From the hypnotic montage of its opening title sequence to its disturbing dark-comedy ending, David Cronenberg's eXistenZ is a thinking person's virtual reality movie.  The plot revolves around a star game designer, Allegra Geller, (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who is nearly assassinated during the test launch of her latest creation - a game called eXistenZ.

Forced to go on the lam with her security guard Ted Pikul (Jude Law) Geller travels through a dream-like landscape inhabited by mutant reptiles and living computer game devices that plug directly into the human body.  But as they seek for safety, the line between reality and fantasy begins to blur.

Leigh is truly remarkable as the neurotic misanthropic Geller who oscillates between frazzled screaming hysteria and edgy mordant sarcasm. It would be difficult to describe just how nuanced her performance is without giving away key plot elements, but I have found my appreciation for her work in this film grow with each successive viewing. She portrays Allegra Geller as a kind of addict whose need for the false reality of her game-world is palpable.

The ever versatile Jude Law plays the nerdy marketing trainee cum security guard with pitch perfect panicked naivet. The movie also includes wonderful little star turns by Willem Dafoe and Ian Holm.

Cronenberg's signature obsession with the joining of flesh and machine is on full display in this film. But eXistenZ is more than just a speculation on biotechnology or even on virtual reality. The ""games"" in the film become metaphors for other things that control our perception of reality. As such eXistenZ can be viewed as a thought provoking multilayered satire or allegory.

Howard Shore's moody and ominous score and Peter Suschitzky's beautiful cinematography also contribute a great deal to this multifaceted little jewel.",1343433600,2,1841,5.241496598639456

1045447,5,6305538018,"What is amazing about this movie,  the strange underworld of one persons game creation... is that no one,  including the viewer, seems entirely comfortable with the concept of reality.  Whose game are we watching?  And has the game ended?  Did they kill someone?  Or were they all game characters?  I've watched it three or four times now.  And I am still not sure that they return to reality... I believe that was the directors intention.  I cannot understand how these reviews miss this.  The fact that it has a different name at the end,  Transcendenz,  this does not mean it was the 'real' game.  The room they are seated in,  like the room in the beginning,  is a very bizarre room to do a game text.  I have read that it is a nice film because the female lead is not just a reference for sex .  Sure,  thats good.  But thats not what makes the film great.

  As the couple enter each new level of this game,  the line between reality and game becomes more obscure.  The cast is wonderful,  and we are not embarressed by any goofy computer special effects.  Its just
good,  simple visual and clever writing.  The game world... so like ours.... We see her running her hand along a gas station wall,  we see him squeezing the leather or the velvet
in a chair.  The characters are experiencing the textures and emotions of real life in this bizarre environment.  This film successfully translates our acceptance of the bizarre.  LIke children,  we accept what
we are told is real.

  The story has a woman shut in who creates games,  a hero to gamers.  She is traveling inside her own game,  trying to fix her 'pod'  and the organic material used to make the pod and the game.  Animals are being mutilated to make the game parts,  and people walk like zombies from the forest to Chinese resteraunts.  The male character worries that he is accepting this as real.  He is concerned about the killing, and the well being of his body... reason in an unreasonable world...  He resonates an anti game playing personality in a resonable way.  The double agent who tries to kill her ( they are either yelling death to Reality or Death to
Existenz) is supposedly the 'real'  game creator,  who worries about the anti game theme.  But the resonable young man turns out to be the real assasign of Jennifer,  the game game-creator.  then when she survives,  and kills him,  and yells death to reality,  the game apparently ends. Or does it?  Now they are in a new 'level'  which we think is real,  and yet I am not so sure.  They they kill this 'real'  game creator.  Or do they.

  In what appears to be reality,  we,  or rather they,  are taken back to a room that we began in in a GAME.  Can that be reality?  Now the people in the 'reality'  sit and watch without emotion pretty much like they watched people murdered back in the game.  When they kill the people in the 'real '  room,  the heros yell the same line they yelled in the game.  ""  DEATH TO..""  Is it not likely that their game characters are still in play?  And yet,  they seem do so real, especially when the Chinese guy says Guys,  are we still in the game?  and thats the point.  thats the terror,  thats the fantastic ending.  I read a review of this movie that said 'when the return to the Real game'  and thought what are you talking about?  YOu missed the point.  I think. ?  Did they return?  Are we still playing the game?

  I love this movie,  I think you will too. Like many great records,  and books,  this film is perhaps made for these times rather than the ones that did not understand them ten or twenty years before.",1314921600,5,3591,4.374807987711214

Now, before you jump down my throat, yell at me that I'm just some girl with no ideas, I'd like to inform you that I am a gamer and I do follow what Cronenberg was trying to accomplish here.  Real life meshes with a video game virtual reality console developed by Dolores Clairborne.  eXistenZ, the game and the movie, swirls and blurs the lines of what is real and what is not to create a layered dimension of interesting commentary on video games.

Unfortunately, unlike video games, movies tend to get hokey if they follow a video game story line.  I could never feel for the characters or gain a connection with them because what was hokey turned funny.  Fake romances, changing of personas, odd tasks, ridiculous conversations, etc, that are all found in video games become absolutely ludicrous in film.  It does make for some oftentimes hilarious sections of the movie, but it takes away from the drama that then becomes severely lacking.

Underrated futuristic Sci-fi/horror/action thriller from famed Canadian director David Cronenberg (""Scanners"", ""The Fly"", ""Videodrome"" and ""History of Violence"").

It's a gory yet action packed thrill-ride that came out during the same time as ""Matrix"" in 1999 yet it's almost as good as that movie but it's more of a long awaited semi follow-up to his masterpiece ""Videodrome"" in the traditional sense.

Cronenberg is a master of mixing up reality with non-reality and physical with non-physical. I think one of the beauties of ""eXistenZ"" is the ugliness of the Virtual Reality world created by Geller's (Jennifer Jason-Leigh) half-mutant amphibian/half plastic game pod. The icky porting into it with an umbilical cord into the spinal column is so Cronenberg. I liked the way he had the characters (and us) believing they were out of the game when they were still in it... those pesky nested realities. It does harken back to some of Philip K. Dick's visionary short stories, as well as Cronenberg's own ""Videodrome"" (especially with the ""Death to..."" sequence). I also liked the use of some of Canada's best actors who have since become more well known, such as Don McKellar, Callum Keith Rennie (by way of Sutherland, England), and Sarah Polley.  In fact, Cronenberg played a character in Don McKellar's 2000 film, ""Last Night"", which also starred McKellar, Rennie, and Polley, not to mention Sandra Oh. I liked the way some of the characters in the Virtual Reality did not respond unless they were fed the correct line. That was brilliant, and I have not seen that done anywhere before or since. I also liked the gun made out of a jawbone that fired teeth for bullets. Cronenberg is brilliant. Take a pop over the Amazon's sister site, IMDb.com, and look at Cronenberg's filmography.

The idea of a thriller wrapped around a virtual reality game has been done many times, starting with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Videodrome/dp/0783228457/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Videodrome</a>&nbsp;and continuing through movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strange-Days/dp/B00000JSJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strange Days</a>.  But what really sets this movie apart is the interesting way it's done; the overtones of attraction, the sexual nature of the apparatus, the philosophical struggle between reality and fantasy.  All of the concepts that make such an existential dilemma meaningful are here.

The ambient filming and dark mood lighting of the film lend to a kind of overall *horror mystery* sort of vibe.  All along, we are trying to determine what is real and what is fantasy.  Are we in the game or out of the game?  The way the camera work is done is a big part of that.

Similarly, the cast is top notch.  While one cannot always expect a good cast to yield good results, when it's combined with good writing the results are positive.  And that is what we have here.  Jude Law is consistent as ever, as is his co-star and the supporting cast.  All the portrayals are under-stated.  But the strong writing makes them impactful despite the methodical pace of much of the movie.

The special effects are also nicely done. All of the effects have a role in the story.  The technology used in the game is given a weird appearance, as if it was a strange body part that was removed at birth.  All the little details such as these really made it clear to me what the message behind the movie was.  You will have to decide for yourself what your interpretation is.

Because of the philosophical nature of the story, the movie can be somewhat preachy.  Not everybody is into that.  The ending also left me feeling like they took the easy way out so to speak.  Once again, you will have to make up your own mind.  No spoilers here!

Conclusion

If you are attracted to weird, thought provoking, horror mysteries, this movie is basically in its own category.  If you are looking for the simple scare and don't want a lot of preaching, this may move too slowly for you.  As for me, this is one the movies I turn to often.  As long as you are in for something far out, I highly recommend it.

1045508,4,6305538018,"Ever wake up from a vivid dream and wished that you could make it into a movie? If you're David Cronenberg, you don't have to wish, and the result is Existenz, an ethereal, strangely sensual odyssey into a world only the subconscious mind could conjure.

A weird little movie with a befittingly weird title, Existenz flew under the radar during the 'Summer of the Matrix'. On the surface, Existenz is little more than a vague narrative of two unlikely companions, played by Law and Leigh, who alternate between reality and a virtual reality game called Existenz.

On a deeper level, this film is an an exploration of the meaning of consciousness and reality and revisits Cronenberg's fascination with the power technology has over its creators. It features Cronenberg's trademark gooey special effects and organic weirdness, but the most striking element is the conspicuous eroticism of existenz's virtual world.

Existenz is an unusual but entertaining and worthwhile film, and though it fails to fully hit home with some of its philosophical arguments, it connects well enough on others. A host of familiar names and faces round out the cast. The DVD offers little in the way of extras (just the theatrical trailer, which I didn't bother to watch). Dolby 4.0 is available, picture quality is great (only widescreen is offered on this disc).",1222646400,4,1342,5.036036036036036

That's the general feeling of this movie.  One just doesn't know whether the game is still on or off, and if still on, on which dimension and how far advanced the players are in the game.  It is an eerie thought that someday, maybe, those gamers out there might just slip into the gaming world and never ever return to the real world.  Splendid performances from Jennifer and Jude.  I find the movie a little too gory and violent, without a clear sense of direction or purpose.  Plugging the pod to the spine is both horrifying and scary.",1220745600,,702,4.3538461538461535

I find it odd that it was a flop at the Box-Office. I first saw ""ExistenZ"" the year it first came out on VHS, and enjoyed it immensely. Of course, I'm biased, because I'm a HUGE fan of David Cronenberg's works. Where David Lynch uses a feather floating on air, David Cronenberg uses a sledgehammer (of course, AFTER he has given it his trademark ""biomechanical"" look)!

Some would say it has a passing resemblance to films such as ""The Matrix"", but I see it as totally unique. As in ""Naked Lunch"", we are treated to a trip through Cronenberg's twisted mind, where nothing is as it seems to be. Seeing it through the eyes of Ted Pikul (Jude Law), is this live? Or is it Memorex? Cronenberg leaves you to decide, but for just a little while, when you are treated to another ""reality""! Good ol' Ted is being led around by Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the creator of ""ExistenZ"", the newest VR game to hit the streets. There are others who take exception to this, however, and try to kill allegra. Ted is forced to do things he would not normally do, but he is pressed into protecting Allegra.

This film is just a lot of fun! Oddities abound. The Uh...weapons, are....unique? Ted's rush to build one, at a restaurant is alternately cool and disgusting.

It has been compared and was released around the same time as Matrix, which also dealt with multiple levels of reality.  From the lower level of reality, it is a story of a group of people testing a new game.  The story moves from one level of reality to another, playing the game, and is based in part on the premise that there are game people who want to live 100% in virtual reality and those people who are angry that some people don't want to live in ""this"" world and create a fake or illusory world - contrary to what is best for the culture.

The higher level question is what is reality; and what do we create by the use of our minds to ""create our world.""  There is a line in the movie were Jude Law's character Ted is stating that the ""game"" world reality they were playing has no rules or structure and everyone is moving about looking for a purpose (or something to that effect).  Jennifer Jason Leigh's character, who is the game's creator Allegra, in the level of the game, says: how is this so different from other realities?

This movie and Matrix, in different ways, ask us, the observer, to question reality to see what we create with our Minds and that in turns brings to us that which we ""see and believe"" is true.  We create our own reality - all else is illusion.",1198195200,6,1442,4.330855018587361

This is a tough and frequently unpleasant movie (what Cronenberg film isn't), relentless even (much like a video game!), but as social/technological criticism it has legs galore. I find myself studying the art direction, acting, and script to see how he tweaks and disorients so subtly all through the entire film. It is meticulously crafted. The ""bad acting"" noted by the other reviewers is a depiction of social disorientation, detachment, sociopathology, and near-autism in a nightmarish future society where people can no longer distinguish between illusion and reality (and, as you learn from the film, neither can the audience). The final moment of the film boldly makes that point.

My personal feeling is that this is Cronenberg's greatest achievement. However, it is high art and those that go into it with conventional film expectations will be (clearly ARE) disappointed.

Jennefir Jason Leigh is awful, as usual, but you can't really blame her or anyone else in the movie. Except of course for having been duped into participating. Ian Holm for Godsakes was awful. All I could think of, was ""Bilbo! How did you get mixed up in this?"".  But I am quite aware that the characters were not in effect professional actors in ExistenZ as much as they were amuteur actors playing roles within an interactive game. So everyone, apart from JJL gets a free pass.

The movie itself, has been applauded as a work of technogolical philosophy, but it was always and inescapably immersed in Cronenbergs immature fascination with bloody fleshy goofiness and misplaced eroticism. It's as if he's still a six year old boy on the playground, trying to impress the six year old girl on the playground by eating a bug or poking a dead squirrel with a stick. Enough already.

I watched this in a film class so I couldn't turn it off or walk out. I was dreaming of going home and playing with my kids or immersing myself in some competent movie or philosophy but I was stuck.

There is a twist at the end, that may get you or not, but like a long-winded joke, the last minute of intrigue can't hope to justify the other 96 minutes of low brow schlock.

I am also aware that incomprehensibility was planned, and a part of Cronen's art, but the philosophical, metaphysical and technological ideas raised have all been dealt with competently and more effectively in 30 seconds of any decent Simpson's episode.

By comparison, The Matrix had an interesting and stimulating theme running through it on several levels, enough political, philosophical and theological questions to make you want to watch it again and again and to ponder it for quite a while and effects to blow you out of your socks  though it also suffered from weak acting I'll grant. eXistenZ was a B movie by comparison.

This movie is based on the book ""eXistenZ"" written by David Cronenberg.  Cronenberg also wrote the screenplay, directed, and was one of the producers of this movie.

The movie occurs in the near future where computer game designers are worshipped like superstars and players can enter inside the games.

The virtual reality game alluded to in the title of this review is called eXistenZ which was designed by Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh).  Players can enter the game via a ""bioport"" (essentially, ""a hole in the [player's] spine"").  A connection is made where one end of an umbilical cord is attached to the bioport and the other end is attached to the game proper (called a game pod--a synthetic, seemingly organic device).  The game runs on the energy of the body's nervous system and can tap into the player's mind.

Forced to flee a failed assassination attempt from another computer company, Allegra teams up with a person named Ted Pikul (Jude Law) who becomes her unintended bodyguard.  Allegra asks Ted to test the game with her and we see through Ted how the game works.  To convey to you how the game actually works, here are some actual things Ted says to Allegra:

(1) ""I'm not sure...I'm not sure, where we are, is real at all.  This feels like a game to me.""

(2) ""I'm feeling a little disconnected from my real life.  I'm kinda losing touch with the texture of it.  You know what I mean?  I actually think there's an element of psychosis involved here.""

(3) ""We're both stumbling around together in this uninformed world, whose rules and objectives are largely unknown, seemingly indecipherable or even possibly non-existent, always on the verge of being killed by forces we don't understand.""

The movie becomes a bit tedious as we are going through the game's world.  In fact, it took me awhile to figure out what was going on and I thought the movie was kind of strange and confusing, especially at first.  But I stuck with it until the end and in its fantastic double climatic ending everything is explained (more or less).  I suspect that those who gave this movie a low rating did not stick with it and gave up on it too quickly.  (This is the biggest mistake you can make when viewing this movie.)

The acting of this movie is very good.  Both Leigh and Law carry the movie.  There are seasoned actors like Ian Holm and Wilem Dafoe that, even though they have small parts, give memorable performances.

This movie has some of the gore associated with Cronenberg's movies.  Thus, this movie is not recommended for the queasy.

This is not only a science fiction movie.  It is filled with corporate espionage, virtual reality gaming (as mentioned),  suspenseful elements, technology, physiology, psychology, and even sexual metaphor.  It can also be thought of as a black comedy on computer games and those who play them.  (Some of the actors probably broke up laughing.)

This movie is not for everyone.  Those who are not patient and who like a movie to tell you everything as it goes along will not like it.  Here are a couple of tips to watching this movie:

(1) Watch the beginning very carefully.

(2) Even if you don't understand everything as the movie proceeds, keep watching and observing because everything is explained in the movie's endings.

(3) Especially note that the game as played in this movie has an anti-game theme.

The last words in the movie are, ""Are we still in the game?""  To understand these words, you have to watch the movie carefully.

Finally, the DVD itself released in 1999 has good picture and sound quality.

In conclusion, this is a fantastic, intelligent but different movie.  Watch this movie carefully so that you understand its riveting conclusion!!

1045722,4,6305538018,"eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, wherein characters run from realm to realm, landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where it's leading them. Within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games, calling into question which reality they arrive from is the ""real"" one.

Of course it's not spectacular at hiding the fact that it's not going to reasonably answer to a true reality, instead tossing the idea of whether it's real or a videogame into question even up to the end. I'm not even sure Cronenberg pretends that twist won't be there, it's so incredibly obvious in a sense it's kind of disconcerting.

The problem with this film though is its base nature, in a sense. Cronenberg is questioning reality AND criticizing game play. Yet the same things that he uses to criticize gameplay makes him revel in it: the violence, the discontinuity, the lack of focus and in a sense, the pixellation even if there isn't such pixellation in the film. I have once heard someone state that Cronenberg's violence is actually a criticism of hyperviolence in media, but he hides that well with the fact that he derives such incredible pleasure in ripping new orifices into humans, animals, and amorphous piles of biological sludge.

What IS brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of videogame conceits (not being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes, relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that don't make sense, only a few people around where it feels there should be many and vice-versa, all of that stuff) along with the motif of penetration. It definitely deconstructs the videogame reality in a way that's nauseating and absurd, but it does it even better by replacing videogame electronics with literal ""pods"" of biological matter that squirm and shift and are, frankly, disgusting to the one of the most horrifying degrees. For what it's worth, this film causes a reaction in you.

But what for? It criticizes virtual reality, but it's a movie: it is its own virtual reality. It seems to criticize the banality of videogame plotlines and character design, yet it maintains that banality. It definitely seems to worry over whether killing a videogame character is more okay than killing an actual human being and how videogames can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their actions in real life, and yet I say again, it derives the utmost pleasure from ripping people, objects, beasts, things, and organisms into bloody shreds.

So whereas it has a key focus of angst, it doesn't really do anything with it, not really. Only what it does do is present that angst in such an original way it can't really be denied its own moment of splendor.

In a sense, it'd be much easier to just hate this movie for being gory and violent, because there's no good reason I can see for loving it and yet I can't disregard it as mediocre or bad. It'd be easier to simply not be able to take it, but since I can, there's nothing I can really do with it. I do believe it is a little excessive, it really didn't need to go as far as it went, but Cronenberg's intentions are so mixed up and confused I don't know if that was Cronenberg's flaw or Cronenberg's point, and I don't think there's really any way to figure it out except maybe ask him directly.

1045723,4,6305538018,"I mean, play the game. 'eXistenZ' is the next generation of video game, the one that jacks directly into your nervous system. Allegra, a pert blonde, is the game designer. For the first time ever, she has emerged from her coding den to launch one of her games, to face her adoring public.

Except, one of them doesn't adore her so much, and takes a shot at her with a bizarre weapon. The crowd pulls their own guns, and pumps a few pounds of lead into the would-be assassin. The chase is on, with Pikul (Jude Law) at her side. They enter the hyper-realistic game and leave it a few times, signalled by changes to Allegra's perm. The action is low-key but moves along well, down to the very end. In the last moment, you'll have reason to rethink everything you've seen, back to the opening sequence.

Effects and chases are decidedly low-key. There's minimal loss of blood, except among the genetically engineered amphibians who give their all (or at least some pinkish wobbly bits) to biological game consoles. People of queasy stomachs might have a bit of trouble. It's an interesting, watchable movie, and presents a reasonable attempt at being thoughtful. It's also one of that very small genre that takes place almost (?) entirely within the game.

At that price and with a cast that included Sarah Polley, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Ian Holm I figured, why not experiment? Unlike most of my video experiments I fell immediately into the story and really enjoyed the film. It is easy to watch and while Polley and Holm have small parts, Leigh is on screen for almost the entire film. Which is probably why she elected to do this instead of ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Her co-star is Jude Law in what I would rate his all-time best performance.

Although I was very impressed I don't recommend ""eXistenZ"" for everyone. It could be described as an anti-""Matrix"". Not in an intentional sense since they were being made at the same time, but rather in their respective target audiences. So if you seek it out because you really liked ""The Matrix"", you may be disappointed.

It has a fairly narrow target audience and because of this it was not aggressively distributed in the U.S. and did much better in Europe. Generally those who really connected to ""The Matrix"" will find it insufficiently manipulative (requiring too much viewer self-analysis and participation) while those who hated ""The Matrix"" will hate it for being too manipulative. So if you found ""Matrix"" generally intriguing but did not go ga-gah over it, you should make it a point to check out ""eXistenZ"".

It is not really sci-fi or action adventure but a psychological thriller (just as ""The Hole"" is not a horror film but a psychological thriller). It places Kurt Vonnegut's theme ""you are what you pretend to be so be careful what you pretend to be"" into an allegorical tale of shifting reality. Do we ever actually exercise free will? Does escaping from reality contribute to reality getting worse, in actuality or in our perception? You are meant to internalize this theme and to ask yourself these questions.

My only real complaint is that the final twist (unlike the earlier twists) does not click into place when you first see it nor later as you work backwards to find clues and foreshadowing elements that support this element. Without these the twist is silly and unnecessary. While it does not ruin all that has gone before it seems like just a lame attempt to prepare the way for a sequel.

She is the world's foremost game designer and must be guarded against possible assassins (ala videodrome). You see, there is an underground group of revolutionaries who seek to bring back reality as a viable lifestyle. One of them attempts a hit on Geller, only to be terminated himself. Enter Ted Pikul (Jude Law) as the one who must protect Geller and transport her to a safe location. Along the way, we are treated to several strange occurances that make us wonder if any of this is real; especially the 2-headed amphibian critter and the playing of the game eXistenZ itself.

You are placed in a world directly wired into your nervous system, and required to figure out the purpose, direction, etc.  It's the ultimate and horrible extension of those antique computer ""Adventure"" games, where you read the first line of a sentence like ""You are in a dark room with a door in the corner"" and you have to figure out (and type out the answer) what to do next.

One of the issues that prevents this movie from being as good as it could have been is that much of the Existenz world is paralogical. For example, you are shown a strange lizard in several scenes, and then you are served a plate of. . .that lizard. . .and you take the bones and assemble them into a grisly gun.  There are a number of these bizarre and arbitrary connections that make you wonder whether who is more psychotic - the game designer, the character whose nervous system is being jacked, or the author of the script. Which muddies up some of the  important issues the film is trying to deal with - the nature of reality, whether video games are morally evil in their pull away from reality, whether people will become extensions of their games, rather than vice versa.  All weighty and very disturbing issues.  So 4 stars for being a really creepy, very memorable film, with one taken away for confusion - the viewer's.",1112918400,5,1493,4.487084870848708

It lacks great visual effects, action, dazzling camera work... etc. But as time goes, this movie completely destroys the Matrix! and I mean it. The ""philosophical"" issues raised by the Matrix seem like a walk in the park compared to this. Typical issues of ""existentialism"", (a branch of its own in philosophy) are raised all throughout the film. This seems like a favorite topic of Cronenberg in his movies. He always likes to send his audience home thinking.

There are many similarities with his opus Naked Lunch. too many to even start writing them here. This is like Naked Lunch, but where the video game eXistenZ replaces Interzone city and video games in general replace drugs. As usual the cast is flawless. This time I was more impressed with the secondary characters than with the central characters. How could you not like Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe's acting?

I would give it 4.5 but I can't, so I give it a 4. The only reason is because it is just a little bit below the greatness of Naked Lunch. Maybe if Dafoe and Holm had more screen time and the movie was twenty minutes longer, it would be comparable.",1112918400,3,1238,4.597285067873303

The central idea was sound and interesting, imagine a future world were games become so real they obliterate the divide between reality and fantasy, were gamers aren't sure any more what is real or not or even worse - have been conditioned by immersion in the game to behave chaotically in real life (strong implications of the effects of game/tv violence here). This is what (apparently) happens to the main characters as they jump from scene to scene after entering the virtual reality world of the game.

The film itself is set in a world in which there is a pregnant tension surrounding the very idea of virtual reality games, where some people are concerned about the idea of the human race vegetating in fantasy and this theme is played out in the game the two characters play. They jump from scene to scene as secret agents working alternatively for the realists and the fantasists, the heroine plays the role of a hunted game designer in the game and there is an amusing undercurrent of Che Guavara style rebellion about their involvement in the game-sequences of the film.

The director chooses to leave the film open to interpretation, the ending is deliciously ambiguous (and the best part of it), unfortunately by then many viewers will have become befuddled and thrown off by the endless shifting between 'realities', the ending explains most of what you just saw nicely and throws in a vicious little twist at the very end.

Opinions on this film vary. Die-hard Cronenberg fans sometimes find eXistenZ to be a little lightweight. Especially when compared to more provocative films like Crash or depressing films like Spider or Dead Ringers.
On the other end of the spectrum, those unfamiliar with Cronenberg's work may find this movie to be too bizarre!
I won't talk too much about the plot, as other reviewers are better at it than I am, but I'll say that it's kind of a game within a game within a game (within a game?). Like a few other films of the day it explores the nature of reality (The Matrix of course is most popular).
eXistenZ was actually Cronenberg's biggest budget at 25 million (not including his current project A History of Violence). The special effects are fantastic, and there are some good moments of gore. A couple people get shot in and around the face. Yes, this is a return to his past in many ways, though again, in a slightly more playful manner.
There's plenty of extras on the DVD, most notably three separate commentaries and a long (almost an hour, I think) feature about production designer Carol Spier which mostly focuses on eXistenZ but also touches on some of her earlier work with Cronenberg.
Definitely worth getting, and an especially good introduction to Cronenberg's work (before moving on to more disturbing pictures like Videodrome and The Brood, and more slow, paced pictures such as Spider and Crash).",1092614400,4,1554,4.802238805970149

I like the whole game idea, It's a great concept.

His imagination is to be heralded, what with live pods and stranger things going on with guns that shoot teeth, etc., etc.  The problem is the whole thing is so chaotic, tedious and self-serving that EXISTENZ becomes little more than a muddled bore.  I wasn't impressed with Jennifer Jason Leigh or Jude Law; they appeared to be acting and not inhabiting their roles at all.

Everything happens the way the characters you are projected into decide, and yet your deeper psyche can influence the characters. You liberate in such a game your most sombre death instinct and psychotic tendencies. You become the character and the character becomes you. You are entirely dominated by a logic that comes from the character and from the deepest layers of your impulses and passions. You burn up yourself in such a game and you do not know any more where reality is and where you stand in it. Everything becomes both virtual and real. You are lost and unable to make a decision and get out of this virtual world which is just as real as reality. Reality disappears by being blended with virtuality. The game becomes a nightmarish experience and a psychotic trip. You use any weapon at your disposal, in the game or in reality, to kill and destroy yourself and other characters or individuals. Death is at the end of the line, death of your mind, death of your psyche, death of your individuality, death of your freedom and free choosing mind. This film is dangerous because it reveals a real danger we are confronted to : playing any game builds in you a second nature that is rooted in your most morbid passions.

1045897,5,6305538018,"What a wonderful movie.  All of the mind twisting about just what is reality anyway? and a feeling for what it's like if you are a videogame character living in a videogame world, where you may have to chop off a person's head to proceed with the game.  I love the homage to Philip K. Dick, who beat the reality problem nearly to death in his works (movies made from his stories include Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, Screamers, Imposter (which I haven't seen), and the embarrassing Paycheck).  When the main characters in eXistenZ get hamburgers to take to the motel, the burgers come from Perky Pat's, and Perky Pat comes from Philip K. Dick.  Residents of Mars, to spice up their boring lives in The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, take a drug and play with their Perky Pat dolls, becoming the dolls and trying to live a Barbie and Ken existence.  They know it's not real, but it becomes more real than real.  You know that you are viewing a great simulation of reality in this movie when the burgers come from Perky Pat's.  This movie would not have been made if Philip K. Dick had not lived, and we are better for both of those events.
 It also seems to me that people who love The Matrix as much as I do - and there are millions of us - can't help but love this film.  I can only attribute this movie's small potatoes performance vis a vis The Matrix to not enough people having seen it.

However, as in all Cronenberg movies, he is the star and the actors are basically meaningless. Like ""Naked Lunch"" and ""Dead Ringers"" the sets and effects are striking and often gross.

1045900,4,6305538018,"The biggest strike against David Cronenberg's eXistenZ is the year that it came out - 1999. It was a summer dominated by Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss. Cronenberg's film covers strikingly similar territory to The Wachowski Brothers' comic book/kung fu/sci-fi/action opus, The Matrix. Whereas The Matrix was a big-budget Hollywood movie aimed at a wide mainstream audience, eXistenZ is an independent lower budget Canadian production aimed at a significantly smaller audience. Both movies deal with issues of technology, specifically actual reality versus computer-generated reality. That's where the similarities end. The Matrix may ask profound questions, but it's an action film at heart, and it's only interested in asking those questions so long as they pave the way for a set piece filled with special effects and stunts. Cronenberg is not interested in dazzling the viewer with effects and action. He wants to make the viewer think (and of course, feel completely repulsed and disgusted).
eXistenZ is a smart sci-fi thriller that is thought-provoking, complex and completely immersing. The premise is pure Cronenberg brilliance: A designer of virtual reality games which use living, organic ""controllers"" that plug into the user's spinal cord, is pursued by a gang of realists who resent her attempt to deform reality as we know it. She enters her game to make sure it wasn't damaged in the attack, and things get interesting from there. Is anyone even after her at all? What is real and what isn't? Cronenberg manages to infuse his usual trademarks into the story, particularly technology versus biology. The part synthetic/part organic game pods are very clever, and I especially liked the completely organic gun made of bones and cartilage which fires human teeth as bullets. Cronenberg loves to combine flesh and bone with technology as illustrated in many of his films. The film has its share of gross-out moments as per usual for the director. The Chinese restaraunt sequence was particularly memorable for me. This film may put you off Chinese food for good.
Cronenberg's vision is decidedly much darker than the comic book universe of The Matrix. I felt that The Matrix had good intentions but took the wrong approach. It's very difficult to successfully merge existentialist philosophy with action shoot-outs. The Wachowskis felt the need to dumb down their subject matter for the action movie crowds and the movie suffered as a result. David Cronenberg is not trying to make an action movie, so the ideas reign supreme here. The subject matter itself, is hardly original, but Cronenberg deals with it in a fresh and unique way adding his own grotesque sense of style. This is not a movie for all audiences, certainly. For those who like their science fiction cerebral, dark and grimy, eXistenZ should be right up their alley. I find it to be an overlooked gem of a film that is a great alternative to that over baked Hollywood cash cow The Matrix.",1076716800,26,2987,5.122950819672131
1045901,4,6305538018,"Every once in awhile when I am feeling reflective I like to watch a David Cronenberg film. I have seen quite a few of them at this point, from some of his earliest stuff like ""Shivers"" to his seminal reworking of ""The Fly"" starring Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. One thing you will always get out of a Cronenberg film is a serious look at how technology and human beings interact. Like science fiction author J.G. Ballard, Cronenberg's films embrace a synthesis of man and machine that is exceedingly grim, usually served with a generous helping of gore. The overarching theme in his cinematic examinations seems to be that humans simply do not know enough about the technology they develop, or if they do, their arrogance in the ultimate abilities of mankind always leads them charging into experiments despite the risks. That we are just not far seeing enough to predict the outcome of using new drugs, messing around with human genetics, or plugging game units into our spinal cords may be a good message to take from a Cronenberg film. ""eXistenZ"" is almost a sequel to his masterful early 1980's effort ""Videodrome."" Whereas ""Videodrome"" dealt with the addictive and manipulative potentialities of television, ""eXistenZ"" warns about the addictive and manipulative potentialities of video games.
Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a top video game designer, is about to premier her latest efforts to a select gathering of techies and marketing schleps. Called eXistenZ, the game promises to blow every other previous effort out of the water, and the people in attendance at the debut of the game are beside themselves with joy. It is difficult to get so excited over a mere video game until we learn that the games these people play goes well beyond a television set and a joystick. In Geller's world, the games plug directly into the human brain via a bioport, or a hole in the base of the spinal column. The system connected to the spinal cord is a half-flesh/half machine game pod, a squishy, living organism sporting an umbilical cord attachment. The action starts when a person plugs in and uses their hands to manipulate this grotesque bag of skin. As for the program itself, well, it goes far beyond virtual reality to create a reality nearly identical to the one we see through our own eyes. Sure, there a few differences easily noticed by players, such as characters who repeat phrases until the player says the right thing to move the game along or weird little creatures that could never exist in reality, but eXistenZ is light years ahead of Donkey Kong.
Geller barely fires up eXistenZ before a nut in the audience attempts to kill her with a weird gun fashioned out of bones that uses teeth for bullets (!). Allegra flees the chaotic scene with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a public relations gopher, and the two head to a hotel out in the sticks until they can figure what the heck is going on. Geller's astonishment about Pikul's lack of a game port leads the two to an out of the way gas station where a guy named Gas (Willem Dafoe) installs unregistered bioports for a fee. More weirdness ensues when Gas makes an attempt on Geller's life, fortunately thwarted by Pikul, and the two confused fugitives head even deeper into the woods to a pod repair shop run by a couple of Geller's old friends. As if it couldn't get any stranger, Pikul and Geller at this point plug into eXistenZ in earnest and are rapidly propelled through a series of strange scenarios involving a Chinese restaurant, a really disgusting meal, one of those strange bone guns, a pod manufacturing plant, and a conspiracy concerning Geller's invention. You are never quite sure when Geller and Pikul are in the game or in reality, which makes the movie quite confusing at times. About the only thing that really makes sense is the conclusion of the film, an ending I will not spoil except to say that it was quite a twist and one which I did not see coming. I probably didn't pick up on the numerous clues throughout the movie because I spent too much time soaking in all of the epic weirdness going on every few minutes.
I always enjoy a Cronenberg film, but the real reason I liked this film was the presence of Jennifer Jason Leigh. Although I have heard several things about her that are slightly off putting, I think she's a real cutie who only gets better with age. I also admire the risks she has taken with some of her roles over the years. I couldn't help but draw a comparison several times in ""eXistenZ"" between Leigh now and Leigh when she starred in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" two decades ago. She's definitely attained a greater range since the early 1980s, and she is much, much prettier as an older woman. At one point in the film the script calls for Allegra Geller to cradle an assault weapon while talking to Pikul, a very short scene that reveals how stunning Leigh is even while toting military hardware. As for Jude Law and Willem Dafoe, they do an adequate job with what they have to work with here. ""eXistenZ"" ultimately focuses more on the twisty plot and the oddball effects than it does with character development. ""eXistenZ"" is not David Cronenberg's best film, but it is an entertaining romp through employing his usual themes. The DVD has no extras except for a trailer, disappointingly, but the movie is in widescreen and the quality is excellent. Here's to a long career for Cronenberg, a man who has brought up plenty of wild and wacky films and who will hopefully bring us a few more in the future.",1074556800,7,5523,4.677286742034943
1045902,5,6305538018,"Although eXistenZ came out around the same time as The Matrix, it seems to be a response to that film. Where The Matrix gave you a digital divide between reality and virtual reality, eXistenZ takes place in the gray area between.
But it's not a PK Dick rehash. Cronenberg spends as much time on the characters and their motives as he does on pseudo-intellectual questions of reality. (The film is also a humorous spoof of computer-game devotees.) Although there are a lot of scenes that lay flat --- instead of moving the plot forward --- the actors are so good, everything is easy to watch. Willem Dafoe is charming and scary as Gas, and Jude Law plays a pitch-perfect resourceful sidekick to Jennifer Jason Leigh. (You also have to hand it to Cronenberg for making the central character female without making her a damsel in distress or an masculine action heroine.)

The story is about the creator of a game called eXistenZ, which plugs into the human nervous system via a bioport on someone's back. It deals with far more though, it is not so much the story which is important, as are some of the underlying themes and questions, such as `what constitutes reality?'

In this world, there is also a faction of ""realists"" who are bent on destroying this game technology.
There are some serious flaws in this movie that detract from the basically good plot idea.  First of all, the game intself is strangely bizarre and gross.  There are lots of body parts, organs, exploding heads, and bloody gunshot wounds.  It seems hard to believe that such a game would be appealing to a large enough of an audience to inspire a terrorist group to oppose it.  In fact the game is an absolute nightmare.  The second point that bothers me is that the test group is freakishly cultish, which again detracts from the idea that this game is a mainstream thing.  The test group meets in a small country church in the middle of nowhere.  Where is the logic in that?  Why isn't the product testing held at the company's headquarters?

The mouth is not ""opening"" straight into the human body as would a hole directly into flesh, organs, or the spine, in fact the entire digestive column can be considered as an entirely separate hollow tube inside of the body, with membranes to control what passes in and out of what is actually part of the human body.

This isn't the best, but it is a bold attempt and it is captivating throughout. It just lacks a sense of originality. Cronenberg's directing is dank and dirty, appropriate since a large amount of the film has our characters dissecting gooey creatures. This isn't a movie to eat a pizza while watching it. Our characters serve as mere tour guides into the mysterious future that lays before us, where humankind has become addicted to VR video games.

Cronenberg's movies do present a reality warping into paranoia, conspiracy and a bizarre sexuality. eXistenZ is no exception. In this film however the predominant element is the paranoia, the bizarre sexuality is subtle, but clearly there. Bio-ports are the gateway into a world that is already winning the battle against reality. Escaping into the twisted world where nothing is as it seems. Control of even your own speech and actions doesn't belong to you as you submit to game urges that push the plot along.

1045998,3,6305538018,"Welcome to the bizarre world of David Cronenberg, and a film in which he considers the implications of modern technology and where it's all taking us as a society-- a  contemplation of hypothetical possibilities that are at once unsettling and exciting.  It's ""eXistenZ,"" written and directed by Cronenberg; a mind-bender that will have you meeting yourself coming and going, and not knowing which is which before it's all over.  But that's the nature of the game, and there is, in fact, a very real possibility that you're actually not even reading this page right now-- I mean, how can you tell for certain?  And that gives you an idea of where this film is about to take you.
Video game maven and designer ""extraordinaire"" Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) has created the ultimate virtual reality video game, eXistenZ (pronounced EGs-ah-stenz), and a control group has been assembled to test it out, with Allegra herself as the guide and game-master.  This is not your typical video game, however, not by a longshot; to play, in fact, the participants have to be fitted with a ""bio-port,"" which is implanted in the base of the spine, and into which the game is hooked up via a connection that looks like an umbilical cord.  The game module itself is like nothing you've ever seen, either.  A kind of erotic-looking latex affair on the outside, the components are actually organic in composition.  From all appearances, this is going to be one wild ride of game, which is exactly what Allegra and her company is promising.
The night of the test is ill-omened, however, in light of the fact that rival companies are out to either steal or stifle the realization of eXistenZ.  There have even been death threats, and an assassination attempt on Allegra's life at this juncture is clearly within the realm of possibility; and accordingly, a bodyguard, Ted Pikul (Jude Law) has been assigned to protect Allegra, and most importantly, the game-- the prototype of which is the only one in existence.  And it is in Allegra's personal game module.  And so the festivities begin, with the promise of excitement that just may transcend even all that eXistenZ has to offer.
Reminiscent of a couple of his earlier films, ""Videodrome"" and ""Scanners,"" Cronenberg has crafted and delivered a thought provoking film, the message of which he presents (as he did with his aforementioned films) in fairly graphic terms.  He plants the seeds of disconcerting shadows in your imagination, then waters them with visual stimuli that encompasses myriad forms of all things creepy and crawly.  In addition, he weighs in heavily on the fear factor, relying on the effects blood, slime and things that ooze will have upon his audience.  And it's all very effective.  He sets a good pace and attempts to balance out story and F/X, but he does enjoy things that gurgle and spill out, and more often than not the F/X tend to take precedence over the story.  But this is Cronenberg's style, and it works well for him in most instances.
Having such a definite visual style, however, does not necessarily lend strength to character development, and Cronenberg (it would seem) relies upon the creativity and initiative of his actors to find the tone that will most effectively convey their respective characterizations most accurately and efficiently.  Essentially, the characters are a secondary consideration, if fact, so any depth that may have added considerably to the emotional involvement or impact of this film is absent.  Cronenberg is too intent on suggesting the effects of all of this on ""people,"" and as such, the individual gets lost in the shuffle of goo.
Given Cronenberg's priorities, it's no surprise then that the performances suffer somewhat from it.  Jennifer Jason Leigh looks terrific in this one, and she's certainly convincing to a point, but Cronenberg has written a one-note symphony, and that is precisely what he extracts from his actors-- nothing more and nothing less.  There's just not enough ""shock value"" to be derived from detail and nuance of portrayal, so Cronenberg simply doesn't bother with it.  Jude Law also succumbs to the maestros style of conducting, but he plays the note he's given as well as can be expected.
As Kiri Vinokur, Ian Holm's talents are wasted in a role better suited to the likes of Vincent Schiavelli or Dick Miller.  Furthermore, Shciavelli would have been perfect in the role of Gas, as well, which in the film is played convincingly enough by Willem Dafoe.  But again, for Cronenberg's needs it was a phone-in; certainly not a stretch, by any means, for Dafoe.  In fact, it would have been an interesting casting twist to have Schiavelli play both parts (and it would have saved on the budget-- two birds with one stone!).  Also slipping into the portrayal Straits of the Individual Lost are Sarah Polley (Merle) and Christopher Eccleston (Levi).
The supporting cast includes Don McKellar (Yevgeny), Callum Keith Rennie (Hugo), Oscar Hsu (Chinese Waiter) and Kris Lemche (Noel).  In retrospect, Cronenberg's film is something of a study in contradictions; while it has a concept that is intellectually stimulating, the presentation is designed for a target audience that will inherently lack the capacity or experience to appreciate the more profound aspects of it.  Interestingly enough, this same year (1999) the Wachowski Brothers explored similar territory, thematically, in the resoundingly successful ""The Matrix,"" which not only has superior F/X, but pays close attention to characterization, through which a sense of autonomy-- even among the masses-- emerges effectively.  And it is precisely that lack of consideration of the individual human element that makes ""eXistenZ"" less than satisfying.  Cronenberg has a terrific idea here, at the heart of which is a cautionary tale with a significant moral; and it's a shame that that is not the film he made.  Instead, he delivers a film that is entertaining on a very base and basic level, but which, in the final analysis, limits itself unnecessarily.",1028851200,6,6046,5.029058116232465

note: I'm aware of what the ending implies, but it's not that original of an idea, believe it or not Mark Twain wrote something similar in ""No. 44 The Mysterious Stranger"", therefore I think the Matrix was more original. I also don't like the game idea because it implies there's a human like creator, and a winner. So I say if all these people are allowed to say their views on reality, I'll say one of mine. In western music the scale is divided into 12 notes(chromatic scale) if you play these notes from top to bottom they sound like nothing. ""Which ones are the good notes which are the bad?"" None of them. It's not until you divide the notes in a way to form a reference point, for example the C major scale(cdefgabc). Starting from C it sounds all happy but if you start from the next note up, d,  it will sound dark. These are called the modes, there's 7 of them in the major scale. So I'm saying it's not until there's a reference point that things can be distinguished, so therefore being human is a reference point. I also like the existing yet not existing quality of music, and the same song can be played on many places of the world at the same time, and there isn't really a human like creator nor is there a winner.",1020729600,,1374,4.2846153846153845

1046044,4,6305538018,"The gifted Canadian director David Cronenberg first got attention in America with a little film called Videodrome. Later, he helmed the commercially successful remake of The Fly, one of my favorite sci-fi movies of the 1980s. With few exceptions, he has stayed in the fantasy and sci-fi genres. eXistenZ is his best effort in over ten years, but is the kind of movie which divides audiences into those who think its a cult classic and those who think its just bizarre.
Cronenberg has a fascination with technology and how it might alter civilization in ways much more ominous than the average person would ever dream of. In eXistenZ he looks at how game technology might advance to the stage where is alters our perception of reality. His vision may seem silly to many viewers, but, considering that some current popular video games are said to be much like those our armed forces use to dehumanize recruits, he may be more on target than we'd like to think.
It is hard to say much about the picture's plot without giving too much away. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Allegra Geller, a brilliant games programmer. She is a star to game world aficionados. A group, perhaps terrorists or perhaps people from a rival corporation, are out to get Allegra. Ted Pikul [Jude Law] is assigned to protect her, and the two go off in search of a safe place. Along the way, she talks him into playing her latest virtual reality game, which is eXistenZ. I'll end the plot information by saying that this is one killer game.
Cronenberg has created a movie that works only if you go with it. If you resist what you see, it doesn't work. The scenes where Allegra and Ted are in the virtual reality game are naturally dreamlike, but even the scenes in real life have a disturbing, nightmare quality to them. Rest assured that everything makes sense in the end.
Jennifer Jason Leigh is near perfect, as always. She has always chosen roles that appeal to her, rather than ones which might make her a movie star. As a result, she is easily among the top ten actresses of her generation. Her Allegra is intense, alert, brilliant, driven, and more than a little crazy. Jason Leigh is one of those rare performers who has acting down to a glance, a hand motion or a slight shift in eye focus. Jude Law himself continues on the road to becoming a memorable character actor. His Ted is at once sensuous yet reserved, cocky yet paranoid, steely yet vulnerable. I can't imagine anyone else in the role.
eXistenZ certainly does not have the digital FX power of The Matrix, a film it vaguely resembles. It is not played for laughs like The Mummy. It is a carefully thought out movie. Cronenberg has delivered one of the scarier and more innovative pictures of the year.",1016668800,3,2735,4.62962962962963
1046045,3,6305538018,"If you enjoy wondering how you know if your really awake or dreaming, this movie will really rev your engines. Cronenberg plays with layers upon layers of being inside virtual worlds. I enjoyed it. My wife thought it was weird. My teenage son started badmouthing it with her, but about 1/3 of the way in, told her to ""please shut up.""
It is intriguing and well conceptualized. It lacks the Gee-whiz FX of Matrix, the painstaking attention to detail of Thirteenth Floor, and the sympathetic character bonding of Jim Carey in The Truman Show (I won't say it lacks acting talent, a la Arnold Schwartzenegger in Total Recall, however). Perhaps this is part of the point? It's a video game, a toy. MS Flight simulator doesn't have the realism of the military flight simulators developed by LockMart & others.
What left me feeling flat was that the movie never really grabbed me. I found it much more entertaining than Dungeons and Dragons (for instance), but I didn't really jack in. It never provided me with the virtual reality so necessary for a great movie experience. Video games lock me in. Addict me. Far too often I say ""Oh [impolite word for excrement]!!! The sun's rising and I have to go to work!!!"" before I turn a game off.
While this movie had a game-like quality, it didn't have the hook, and that was disappointing. Matrix, The Truman Show, Thirteenth Floor, and even Total Recall--these are movies I watch again and again. eXistenZ ... once was probably enough.
I'd give it 2 1/2 stars. It had some creative ideas. It dropped some good hints early on, hints that were subtle enough not to give anything away. It ended ambiguously. I like that. But it really failed to dig deep, to stir anything in my soul or my shadow, to make me recoil or cheer. If you enjoyed eXistenZ, you'll probably really enjoy Jack Chalker's excellent Wonderland Gambit trilogy (books, not videos!). It's well written and it plays with reality levels in some creative and intriguing ways.

1046046,3,6305538018,"""eXistenZ"" uses virtual reality as a loophole and an excuse to whittle its commitment to the viewer down to nothing. It raises questions and then pretends it didn't. It begins a philosophical parable and ends a horror show (though, I have to admit, a staggeringly simple and effective one).
I find it rather ironic that the first entry I made in my notes while watching ""eXistenZ"" is the following: ""From the first scene there is a feeling of artifice. The speaking characters are continually framed so as to make them appear alone before the camera. They talk, they grimace, but there is neither cause nor effect. They are reciting lines of dialog, but the dialog is cast in stone. There is no sense of reality."" The film is indeed about detachment from reality, and, for all its simplicity uses a number of tools with great mastery to evoke a powerful knee-jerk response from the viewer, but (unfortunately) little else.
The scenery is a big help: a sort of X-Files meets Sliders ominous evergreen forest, a forsaken ski chalet, a dark, lonely gas station (one character suggests going to ""a local country gas station,"" and seconds later arrives at a building conspicuously labeled ""Country Gas Station""; elsewhere, there is an equally anonymous Chinese Restaurant, though it's nothing like you would expect). There is a lot of reasonably cheesy squishy, squirming, stomach-turning, slimy little things, like mutated amphibians and the Metapods reputedly cobbled from their flesh. Cronenberg doesn't even reveal the true story a good while into the film - he's too busy grossing us out with the over-the-top wet sounds of umbi-cords being plugged into spinal bioports.
A glycerin coat of tongue-in-cheek humor keeps the level of absurdity down. ""eXistenZ"" continuously pokes fun at the gamers' technobabble, with some accuracy (""It's most probably a pathetically mechanical attempt to heighten the emotional tension of the next game sequence"").
Sadly, ""eXistenZ"" is a bit too trigger-happy with the virtual-reality switcheroos. Whenever any single storyline becomes potentially interesting, it is revealed to be unreal, just another level of Allegra's game. Pretty soon I stopped caring, since whatever was established in the previous stretch is put on its head in the next.

For some reason the sight of ten fleshy blobs sitting on peoples' laps while pulsating and screeching is one of the most deeply disturbing things i've seen in campy sci-fi movies since the facehugger in Alien.
The plot itself is rather sketchy and confusing, though I personally think the acting was potentially shaky, giving a more realistic portrayal of video game characters.

One of the problems with auteur directors who write, produce, and direct their movies is that you tend to see a repetition of themes. Now these might be put down to style, but there are lots of ideas here from Videodrome and The Fly, albeit with more up to the minute special effects. The obsession with the body, self-inflicted bodily change and decay is here, with a good measure of William Gibson thrown in. Unless I missed something, the idea of plugging yourself into an organic computer and experiencing virtual reality first came up in the Matrix in 1976's Doctor Who in the story The Deadly Assassin, and the idea of not knowing which reality you are in has been rather worn out by Philip K. Dick. It's not a bad film by any means, and Jude Law turns in a particularly impressive performance.

1046128,4,6305538018,"David Cronenberg has always been an unpredictable filmmaker, and even after 25 years in the business, his unique visions show no signs of decay.  The possibilities of the human body used for malevolent purposes fueled his ""Shivers"" and ""Rabid""; the eerie drama of the human subconscious punctuated ""Dead Ringers,"" ""Naked Lunch,"" and ""Crash.""  With ""eXistenZ,"" Cronenberg takes eager aim at the future and questions our reality in a film that's devoid of flashy, computer-generated EFX and mindnumbing violence (*ahem*, ""Matrix""), but is exciting and intelligent all the same.
The plot concerns a Virtual Reality game designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) previewing a new system--'eXistenZ'--to the public, but things go horribly wrong when a would-be assassin puts her on the lam with a P.R. nerd (played by Jude Law).  For the rest of the film, this odd couple wanders about the VR world, occasionally coming out of the game, to the point where the line between fantasy and reality is blurred (the last shot in the movie only reinforces it).
Cronenberg has gathered possibly his best cast here, getting a lot of mileage out of familiar faces (including Willem Dafoe, Christopher Eccleston, Don McKellar, and Ian Holm, among others).  And even though the acting is occasionally overwrought and laughable, the director doubles back in the final sequence, critiquing his work with tongue planted firmly in cheek.
Perhaps most importantly, ""eXistenZ"" proves that FX don't necessarily insure a more 'futuristic' film.  Through subtle camera techniques, Cronenberg successfully merges from one level of reality to another with an expert hand.  Unlike ""The Matrix,"" which impressed me only on a technical level and left my brain hollow afterward, ""eXistenZ"" is for cerebral moviegoers, people who demand a little more than chic black leather and slow-motion bullets to propigate a satisfying experience.",999216000,8,1892,5.375

It definitely has interesting situations...and a few twisted images.  Cronenberg doesn't leave you with much to think about, just a few ooh's and ahh's.  Jennifer Jason Leigh doesn't give much to the film.  She's as whiny and annoying as ever with the exception of the lines ""Did I win?"", ""Did I win?"".  That was endearing.

The title is just one annoying aspect of many in the film, which plays like some kind of nerd fantasy involving lots of weird technology crap and Jennifer Jason Leigh in a miniskirt.  The film begins when Allegra (Leigh), a world-famous game designer, survives an attack from a would-be assasin during a company demo of her new game, eXistenZ.  Ted (Jude Law), a PR agent-in-training for the company (and her temporary bodyguard) whisks her away to a motel to hide out.  In order to test whether her game (a revolting, squirming flesh pod thing with an umbilical cord...yum) has been damaged in the attack, she must test it out with someone friendly.  After Ted is installed with a BioPort, the two can enter into eXistenZ to see whether the game has been damaged.  Unfortunately, things get pretty freaky and soon it becomes difficult to discern between reality and the game.  For the rest of the film Allegra must give Ted dangerous come-hither looks from under her eyelashes, and he must shoot waiters and yell, ""something doesn't feel right!"" periodically.
Hmmm...what to say, what to say?  Oh yeah: yuck.  This movie lacked any kind of a coherent plot and contained a few too many bloody animal parts for my taste.  Jude Law is even kind of boring in this one (oh, except when he slurps the head off of a mutant frog snake...thing). Mostly he just whines at Jennifer Jason Leigh in a bad American accent (but this CAN be forgiven as he was an excellent American in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' and he is my favorite actor.)  Jason Leigh just seems tired and PO'd for most of the film, although her hair is quite stylish.  All in all, this movie has great special effects and very realistic fake blood and organs.

The legend in the potrait is just a ""promo"" thing, the one about Matrix is just Child's play, but eXistenZ is a most intelligent look about the distorsion of our reallity and the creation of new ones.

1046197,3,6305538018,"As one of the few passionate admirers of Cronenberg's *Naked Lunch* (I've screened the film nearly thirty times in eight years), I had understandably high expectations for this, his latest effort.  *eXistenZ* is something like a ""sequel"" to the earlier film, a dreamscape of surrealist sound-stages backlit with vulcan reds and dusky blues, spinal landscapes of inverted logic, odd reversals and breakneck paradigm-shifts, paranoiac espionage metaphors right out of Philip K. Dick, cipher-cored characters traversing the eXistenTial dream-labyrinths of ye olde Interzone....
Sounds good, right?
Unfortunately, *eXistenZ* just doesn't work as a film.  Like the fish at the end of that Faith No More video, the actors flounder and suffocate on-screen, trying to build scenes out of dramatic deadwood, congested dialogue in the plaqued-out arteries of Cronenberg's screenplay.  The quietly compelling labyrinth of *Naked Lunch*, a world of mystery, omen, conspiracy and strange portent, yields throughout in *eXistenZ* to mere non sequitur, to unconvincing performances and unintentionally funny tableaux.  A slow narrative train-wreck, unable to really grip the viewer for more than a few minutes....
On a brighter note, the set-design is outstanding, with built-environments and color-schemes rising to the level of visual poetry.  The trout factory, the Chinese restaurant, the sunny outdoor tidal pools as a hatchery for mutant sea-creatures (right out of William Burroughs's *The Soft Machine*), I would love to page through this designer's sketchbook.  Much of the film has a cheery, sunny, brightly lit ambience unusual for Cronenberg, an oddly refreshing melange of natural sunlight and blue-green organic flourish, of brown shadows and biomechanic grunge.  But brilliant sets and dreamy atmospherics aren't enough for a script-treatment that's more or less dead in the water.
As a treatise on the postmodern, *eXistenZ* almost redeems itself, and will no doubt appear on course syllabi for many semesters to come.  Jude Law, shortly after being spineshanked with an eroto-mechanic BioPort jacking him into Leigh's proto-sentient game console, complains that this new game is frustrating, absurd, obstructionist, rife with abrupt and meaningless transitions, peopled by plastic ""game-driven"" personae, and just not a whole lot of fun.  Who would ever want to play a game like this?  To which Leigh's character replies, We've been playing eXistenZ all our lives.  Which addles the viewer into a culture-concept catch-22.  If virtual reality is the wave of the future, digitalized full-body immersion technology designed for the ultimate in simulated experience, why would consumers want to ""escape"" into a heightened reality even more brutally absurd than the existential meatspace of ""real life.""  The game is praised as ""more real"" than any of its simulacral predecessors, but isn't there an inherent contradiction in the idea of ""escaping into reality""?
*eXistenZ*, after all, is a game for elite postmodern junkies, a culture-portal for those who've abandoned the material world to simulation and simulacra, addicts of trendy nihilistic doctrines beneath a television sky.  It can hardly sustain the shallow, narcissistic fantasies of 21st century pop culture.  Games like *Myst* and *Riven* are remarkable entertainments, but as a ""text"" they're as shallow as spit on a rock, neo-Christian allegories as tendentious as anything by Tolkien or C. S. Lewis.  *eXistenZ* ultimately flounders because it assumes that the television-shrunk minds of pop culture will want to enter virtual-reality environments as emotionally and intellectually challenging as a deep, Melvillean work of literature.  But will those same consumers who carry Cliff's Notes editions of *Moby-Dick* to English Lit. class ever slap down sixty bucks to jack into *eXistenZ*?  Seems about as likely as Harold Bloom zoning out on Sony PlayStation.
As always, Cronenberg should be applauded for grinding against the grain of adolescent wish-fulfillment which dominates the science-fiction film market (*The Matrix*), but the ultimate value of *eXistenZ* may be as a case-study for what happens when visionary experiments collapse under their own conceptual weight.  A chastisement to would-be visual poets everywhere.  A crash-profile in the annals of conceptual and aesthetic failure.  A painful disappointment, but one that rewards film students with careful scrutiny as to what exactly went wrong.",986601600,4,4475,5.669161676646707
1046198,3,6305538018,"I have been a fan of David Cronenberg's movies for some time, and of movies and sci-fi writings that successfully question reality. BRAZIL and JACOB'S LADDER or DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP, are among my very favorites. I was all set to love eXistenZ, but I have to report that it SEEMED quite unsuccessful to me.
Was it really unsuccessful?  The acting was ponderous, with lines delivered slowly, awkwardly and with some of the thickest, most unconvincing accents ever committed to film--true, this was supposed to help us understand that the characters were actually in a game.  The special effects were amazingly awkward--although the designs were interesting, the models didn't seem organic, but obviously rubbery.  I'm sure Cronenberg would say that the  SFX were designed to further this understanding as well.  So it wasn't REALLY a bad movie, but it was a good movie PRETENDING to be a bad movie.
But let's add another plot twist to our critique--what if eXistenZ wasn't really a good movie pretending to be a bad movie, but was instead a bad movie pretending to be a good movie pretending to be a bad movie?  How could we tell?  Maybe, if the script weren't particularly good, and if everything were explained according to a reality that left no questions unanswered and was conceivable at the beginning of the film--that would surely be an indicator.  And, I'm afraid, that is indeed the very nature of eXistenZ.
On one level it does have something to say about addiction and humanity's self-destructive nature, and on another there are many of the Cronenberg touches--lots of goo and exploding heads--his fans will be familiar with; maybe the real statement eXistenZ makes is about its director's addiction to slime and gore.  But ultimately the movie doesn't really work that well on the surface, and it doesn't work as a deep philosophical exploration either.",985392000,5,1879,4.977635782747604
1046199,4,6305538018,"It has been almost two years since I first wanted to see eXistenZ by David Cronenberg. And I do insist on the particular ortography since, in the very first sequence, one of the movie's characters says that ""It's a new game - it's spelled like this: small 'e,' capital 'X,' capital 'Z.'"" But the game is not new at all! It is as old as time, except now somebody has finally done a coherent, solid, and downright smart film about the make-believe of video games. Before them, of course, it used to be the theatre and film that got accused for their make-believe.
Done with much much less money than the well-acclaimed ""Matrix,"" eXistenZ should also stimulate much much more neurons than Keanu Reeves's square-shaped face that - unfortunately - haunts me not through the films he's made but through his bad-hair-day appearances at various gatherings and awards. In lieu of him, eXistenZ features one of the best actors to emerge from the UK in the past 3-4 years - Jude Law. Beside him, there's Jennifer Jason-Leigh - whom, after seeing this film, I will never again mistake with Claire Dannes or Julliette Lewis. And of course, it doesn't hurt the movie a bit that alongside these two there are Willem Defoe and Ian Holm.
It is a general opinion that Cronenberg has got us used to strange films, which is a strange affirmation in itself since all of his films deal with very human themes, even though sometimes they are very obscure. eXistenZ does not contradict this. It is a story in which the constant shifting of perspectives and the director's imagination create a rhythm that cannot by any chance be equalled by the fights and special effects of ""Matrix."" Moreover, while ""Matrix"" is already dated (probably in less than ten years from now people will regard it as some sort of ""Blade Runner,"" if that) eXistenZ will stay fresh because it is already filmed as a classic. Don't get me wrong - it is a Sci-Fi alright - but it also demonstrates very well how it is like to cut a little on the special effects and add a little on the mental effects!
Cronenberg is diabolical - he will make you want to go right back to the beginning of the film once you've watched it, and make you want to watch it again and again. He will also make you want to play eXistenZ - the video game - which to my knowledge does not exist (while the one based on ""Matrix"" is probably already out of fashion) and he will make you want to be Law of Jason-Leigh. Which is perfectly alright since they are both fresh and sexy.",984787200,4,2500,4.508810572687224
1046200,3,6305538018,"David Cronenberg is a very sick man. Everytime I tape another one of his movies & sit down to watch it, I wonder about an industry that would continue to give this man money with which to record his personal obsessions. Of course, the fact that I find it necessary to tape & watch the films provides the answer!
""eXistenZ"" is, in a nutshell, Cronenberg's return to the themes of his first film ""Videodrome"". Since ""Videodrome"" was produced at the dawn of the cable era, it used the video aspect of modern society to make its' points. Now that computer gaming is so much a part of modern society, Cronenberg has found an even more potent tool for his surgical dissections of mass media.
To viewers who haven't seen this earlier work, Cronenberg's repeated use of ""bioports"", ""gamepods"" & other artifacts of mutant genentech may seem ripped out of William Gibson's later works. However, ""Videodrome"" presented us with repellent representations of man merging with plastic way back in the late 70's (well before Gibson was a household name). The vision however has grown much darker. We've watched the progression thru the intermediate works of ""Dead Ringers"", ""the Krays"" & ""Naked Lunch"" but ""eXistenZ"" is so dark as to be almost unwatchable at times.
I realize I am completely ignoring any plot synopses, but you can read other reviews for that. I will mention that Jennifer Jason Leigh does excellent work as the ""demoness Allegra Geller"" & Jude Law does an excellent ""PR nerd"" keeping an American accent credibly thruout.
Will you enjoy ""eXistenZ""? That depends on your gross-out factor. If you enjoy watching amorphous pulsating blobs slithering into apertures in people's spinal columns, the answer is a resounding YES. For the rest of us, the answer is a little more ambivalent.

1046203,5,6305538018,"I caught this on cable while surfing, and it pulled me in, just as the game in the movie does to the main characters.  There's so much going on in this movie that it's difficult to sum up in a short review.  Cronenberg and his team did such a surprisingly fantastic job on this movie that I can't beleive no one noticed it when it came out.  Despite what other reviewers have said, the character portrayals are multi-dimensional, as are the attention to such details as costumes, make-up and even sets and props.  Best of all, this film works in a way that makes you want to sit back and enjoy the ride, just as Leigh's character instructs Law's character in the film.
But the most important element of this film is the message that is transmitted.  Someone in another review of this film kicked The Matrix, but that movie is an excellent allegory for the civilization we live in, and thus can be forgiven the ludicrous future vision necessary to deliver that message to the sheep who need it so badly.  Existenz gives us a vision of a much more probable future, one that we will likely bear witness to.  In the not-too-distant future humans will have the option to completely escape reality through computer technology, and in it's very likely that Cronenberg's vision won't be too far off the mark.

1046205,2,6305538018,"I've enjoyed several other Cronenberg films but Existenz really didn't do much for me. Maybe this was intentional, but the dialogue was really stilted, and the acting--stiff, unrealistic, without any real passion--turned me off. Existenz's protagonists speak in this slightly off dialogue that reminded me a bit of the futuristic lingo in Aeon Flux, but in this case it just came off silly. Watching this in the theater, I wasn't the only person chuckling at some of the unintentionally bad one-liners...
What sort of irritated me about Existenz, and a lot of what I'd call ""art film,"" is that it seems to substitute ""meaninglessness"" for ""ambiguity."" In other words, the movie throws in a few visual flashes and C's trademark weirdness for no other reason than to be ""different,"" and then expects the viewer to attribute some sort of deep meaning to what's going on, when it's really just an exercise in stylistic excess. I've noticed this in some of David Lynch's film, and it's a habit that makes Existenz a little annoying and even condescending to the viewer.
Anyway, I've heard the film compared to the Matrix, and the overarching theme (confusion between virtual reality and actual reality) is there, but the non-linear plot seems like it's there just to serve the visuals--namely some strange physical weaponry, a couple interesting settings, a few murders, maybe one steamy sexual scene. It reminded me more of Videodrome, a much better Cronenberg film that managed to hit on all of the themes of Existenz (technology, virtual reality, sexuality) plus quite a few more (moral decay, societal corruption, S&M, voyeurism, etc.).
Videodrome is, in my opinion, a lot more interesting visually, it has much more resonance and was just a flat-out more entertaining and satisfying flick. It's not that I didn't like Existenz, but it's sort of like Inferno is to Dario Argento's Suspiria--basically an inferior copy of a much better movie by the same director. Existenz is worth renting if you aren't familiar with Cronenberg or are a big fan/completist, but Videodrome is the real deal.",979603200,8,2088,5.0726744186046515

I've been a fan of David Cronenberg for years, but this movie just wasn't up to his considerable par. The themes are fascinating, and the storyline progesses nicely, but the entire feel of the movie left me a little bored. I didn't really care whether or not the characters were able to do what they had to do, even when that included Jude Law eating a double headed lizard, which should have been disgustingly interesting.

The overt strangeness and many twists are what make this movie work. Cronenberg introduces bizarro elements from the beginning, so the viewer accepts them without much fight. As things get weirder, and admittedly grosser, you almost don't notice - except that Ted (Law) annoyingly questions everything. Of course, Allegra (Leigh) is so blase that you figure everything must be fine. Carry on. By the end, you've accepted so much on faith that you're left wondering what just happened - and why you didn't see it coming.

So much happens at so many levels that you have to see the movie a couple of times to catch it all.

1046274,2,6305538018,"This movie started off like it could have been a great low-budget tech thriller, but due to lack of consistency, poor acting, and patchy direction, it just falls apart into a mess of good ideas gone bad.  Sounds like a number of other Cronenberg projects...
Cronenberg has shown on a number of occasions that, when inspired, he can direct on a level with many other big names.  In this case, I think he fell for a good pitch during a time when the ""What is reality?"" idea was popular.  Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have a leg to stand on when compared with other movies that shine in this sub-genre.
Cronenberg tries to slip all this by in a sleek and sexually charged package, complete with Jennifer Jason Leigh as a smolderingly sexy game programmer, and a game system with a nipple that needs to be tweaked frequently.
Jude Law makes several attempts to make his character seem real, but for all his trying, it comes across rushed: as if Cronenberg had a deadline to meet, and tried to make the movie in one take.  Leigh never really does anything except play her part in such an over-the-top manner that it's really quite laughable.  If you're looking for a movie in which these two stars shine, try The Talented Mr. Ripley for Law, and Delores Claiborne or The Hudsucker Proxy for Leigh.
All in all, this movie was more of a disappointment because it could have been so much better.  I'm a sucker for Sci-Fi, and I tend to make excuses for a bad movies that I like.  I can't scrape up any excuses for this flick, however.

It's much more than Cronenberg probing the usual, uh,  orifices.
The plot has been laid out sufficiently if superficially by the  amazon.com reviewer; the effect is what matters.  Cronenberg has captured  the queasy and always sexual tension of psychedelic forays whether induced  by chemical agents or, in this case, flesh pods plugged into a backside  orifice.  Jude Law's squeamishness at having a BioPort installed is one of  the funnier sequences; he's a fine actor and always compelling to watch.  Jennifer Jason-Leigh was well-picked for her role: her hard edges mesh well  with the self-possesed character who imagines herself as a computer game  genius.  The Chinese Restaurant sequence wherein Jude is forced to make a  gun from the bones of Mutant-Cuisine is stupendous in its evocation of  dread. It suggests that certain moment when the tripper wonders which way  the drug/game is going - towards illumination or total mayhem and madness?  Lines of kinship between Anxiety and Sex pop up frequently in such  sequences in eXistenZ, and its ofttimes hard to tell which is  which.
There are also compelling moments that would make social engineers  and extreme right-wingers very anxious: the threads that hold 'social  reality' together are very, very thin, and eXistenZ tweaks this  well.
eXistenZ is Cronenberg's sexiest, funniest flick, and a nice  follow-up to CRASH, whose porn-in-form-but-not-in-effect conceit alienated  most viewers and left them cold. Plus only a handful got the outrageous  joke about combining car crashes with eroticism, as obviously absurd as it  was.  For myself, I found CRASH to be an absorbing study of how fixed and  single-minded sexualized attention can become, and its eventual drift into  pornography. In retrospect, ""Crash"" is a study of the  pornographic mindset.
I can't imagine Cronenberg mining this material  much further, though.  One could bookend this outing with THEY CAME FROM  WITHIN (SHIVERS) and have a nice body of work from a very entertaining mind  who excavates humor from the strangest crevices.",968112000,4,2383,5.32345013477089

Imagine 'Star Wars': ""This is your father's Light-sabre Luke, the light comes out of this bit but it doesn't go on and on forever, gradually getting dimmer like normal light, it stops after a while. Also it can cut through things and hurt people which light can't normally do, and.........blah, blah, blah, blah, blah""

1046350,3,6305538018,"David Cronenberg's ""eXistenZ"" is one of those films that falters badly during much of its running time, but which redeems itself with a cleverly revelatory ending that explains and justifies some of the seeming  nonsense that has come before it.
Joining an increasingly long list of  thrillers dealing with the concept of virtual reality, this latest  Cronenberg effort raises an increasingly disturbing question: will cyber  ""reality"" ever advance to the stage where it becomes  indistinguishable from ""true"" reality? In an earlier time, this  theme usually developed along the lines of dream vs. conscious reality,  wherein characters would become caught in dreams within dreams with the  hapless victim ultimately left in a state of perpetual confusion and  desperation. Now, this theme has moved into the realm of cyber reality  (i.e. ""The Matrix"") but the essential question still remains -  only now the issue is a more complex one because, unlike dreams which exist  beyond the control of the dreamer, cyber reality is a conscious outgrowth  of mankind's quest for ever increasing technology, employed in the purpose  of achieving more leisure time gratification. Soon, novels and movies will  become passe as ordinary citizens take on the virtual reality roles of  daredevil adventurers or irresistable romantic heroes. In many ways, this  theme was touched upon as long ago as 1983 in the film  ""Brainstorm"", which, in retrospect, seems to become more and more  prescient in its view of a world laying just a few decades down the  road.
Unfortunately, ""eXistenZ"" works mostly in retrospect  itself. Too much of the film borders on the ludicrous and incomprehensible  and Cronenberg needs to begin to shed his junior high level obsession with  goop and gore. However, when the ""reality"" of the film is finally  revealled, much of what has occured previously begins to seem justified and  the audience does leave the film with some food for thought. Also,  Cronenberg continues to explore the motif of bizarre sexuality he exploited  to the full in his last film, ""Crash"". Here, sex is as simulated  as all other virtual reality activities, with the computer game  ""plug-ins"" and receptors functioning as substitutes for the more  traditional sexual organs.
""eXistenZ"" may provoke more giggles  than gasps during much of its running time, but it is a film worth sticking  with to its rewarding conclusion.",964483200,7,2412,5.216710182767624

1046405,5,6305538018,"This great flick is of the same general theme as ""Dark City"", or ""The Matrix"".  It's really creepy.  You almost feel like you are watching a play here, there is a very minimalist approach to settings,  generally speaking, and very few real special effects.  (I pause here to  note that what special effects are featured, are done in classic,  characteristic Cronenbergian fashion, i.e., they're usually really gross.)  Also, there is relatively little background music, which makes you focus on  what the actors are saying, more than on the general background mood that  the music is usually there to enhance, if you see what I'm saying.  But  beyond that, the actors generally really respect each others' space in this  movie.  It is a little like the isolating effect produced in ""The  Shining"".  A character speaks, there is an almost imperceptible pause,  and then the next person speaks.  This is sort of what I mean by comparing  it to a play -- they aren't usually caught up in some physically wild  situation which forces them to be yelling in each others faces, etc.
The background theme that this is all about social games that go on  every day, is quite intriguing.  Sarah Polley has an interesting, albeit  small, role at the end, in which she seems to really play up the whole  theme of small social games having a perhaps overriding importance in our  whole sense of who we are.  The whole thing of having games within games is  quite mesmerizing, and in a horrible way, Jude Law and Jennifer Jason  Leighh's very last lines are really something to mull over, calling into  question the whole idea of Art.

Do we have to despise him in the same manner some people have despised John Carpenter in the mid-nineties ? I think that we  ought to remember that the filmography of Raoul Walsh and Alfred Hitchcock  counts a certain number of not so glorious movies !
And I loved the  toothgun, a Cronenbergian weapon which shoots teeth and the game pod, a pod  dedicated to all the seganintendosony addicts. Slightly erotic, isn't it,  guys ? In fact, eXistenZ could have been named SeXistenZ. The way the games  are downloaded in humans is, it's the least one can say, very sexual and a  second or third vision of eXistenZ could reveal some other surprises hidden  in the movie.
The weakness of the movie lies in the screenplay. Is  eXistenZ a charge against video games which, according to David Cronenberg,  are the new drug threatening our children ? If it is, the demonstration  isn't convincing at all. I prefer to consider eXistenZ as the gameroom  containing all the obsessions or our beloved director. And the key is  ours.

1046409,3,6305538018,"One thing I've noticed about viewers' reactions to this film is that most people seem to have either loved it or hated it - strange, considering that the thing with eXistenZ is that it delivers exactly what you expect it to  ... and no more.
 I'm still not quite sure as to what to think about this  film: still ""digesting"" it (without wanting to incur visions of  that ""yummy"" Chinese special .. ). The way the film shows the  confusion between reality and virtual reality is effective, if not  immediately obvious. However, the story just never seems to hang together  as a whole; a tighter structure might paradoxically have allowed a more  open, more disturbing interpretation of this vision of the future. As it  is, eXistenZ is interesting enough in itself; but, ironically, I never  managed to fully immerse myself in the strange new world created for us.
  I guess that the reason I'm so confused about this film is because, as  others have said, you're never sure whether you're judging the movie or the  game. Perhaps the strangely claustrophobic feel of this film is deliberate:  eXistenZ and later tranCendenZ open up whole new worlds for the characters,  but also isolate them because they're never sure what to trust.
 Not  sure about the acting either: Jennifer Jason Leigh is good, but not  entirely convincing; Jude Law is low-key (but still gorgeous!), sometimes a  little too much so. However ... like with the main story ...
 ... the  problem is deciding whether that's deliberate or not. The reason I have  rated this movie at 3 stars (which for me is a ""good"") is because  David Cronenberg appears to have done what he set out to do: make you  unsure about the difference between reality and fantasy.

What might that merit be?  Reading the seventy or so reviews by others was enlightening.  Apparently  the director, Cronenberg, has elevated protoplasm-like, revolting props to  something of a trademark.  While this may help viewers easily identify his  movies, it doesn't make the movies themselves particularly attractive.  In  the Naked Lunch, he used such images to underscore an important social and  psychological issue (drug addiction).  ExistenZ also promised to explore  an intriguing social phenomenon (preoccupation with virtual reality), but I  don't think it achieved that end.  The ""blurring of reality""  theme might have served as a substitute, but again this germinal idea,  instead of being nurtured and cultivated,  was aimlessly tossed around and  eventually crushed underfoot.  Any attempts at suspense or drama produced  only comic results.
Take for example, the scene near the end where our  hero cut his companion's ""umbilical cord"", releasing a gush of fake blood.  The ""B"" horror movie imagery, funny enough in itself, was further  heightened by the heroine's forced orgasmic groaning and the hero's  pathetic cries of despair, ""I just don't know what to do.""  Then  in came a third person exclaiming, ""I know what to do,"" whereupon  he began to incinerate a small, gooey creature using an enormous flame  thrower.  The scene came across like a Saturday Night Live skit - the whole  movie, in fact, was little more than a string of such skits.
One critic  pointed out that the movie intended itself to be taken in a sardonic vein -  something along the lines of Natural Born Killers or Boogey Nights.  But  these latter two were subtle and clever mockeries.  EXistenz had no  surrealism, no creative graphic montage, no intelligent lampooning of  societal fixtures.  The only possibility left is that Cronenburg intended  this film as a satire on his own movie-making style.
Others critics  defend this movie as something that only ""some"" can understand.  Perhaps  there are those who find this director's repulsive props an attraction in  themselves - I certainly am not one of those.
ExistenZ is the first  movie I've watched in a long time that I found so wretchedly bad that it  actually created some resentment on my part.  I watched it because I was  with a friend and wanted to be polite.  As it turns out, I should have  erred on the side of rudeness.

Too much rehashing of  ideas from videodrome, reality merges with fantasy, organic gun technology  etc. I  hope cronenberg has not lost his touch and will return to form.

1046501,2,6305538018,"Have you read Ian Watson's Deathhunter? It took me a while to make the link, but now I know why I didn't like eXistenZ that much. It's just been done better before. Watson similarly deals with virtual reality and the  blurring of it and reality. He also has a similar cop-out ending. Only he's  more imaginative than Cronenberg.
eXistenZ is an ""interesting""  movie. Blurring the lines between reality and fiction, not knowing what is  real and what is not, can be an effective way to introduce suspense.  eXistenZ doesn't manage that fully. It remains an interesting ride, but  never really takes off. It slowly introduces us to an interesting world,  but just as we get to understand it better, it suddenly ends. There is no  real closure, and the movie left me with a feeling that David Cronenberg  just wanted to confuse me. The ending seems like a cop-out - although a  predictable one. It is a little thought provocative, but mainly in that you  have to think real hard to make sense of it. Jennifer Jason Leigh's  character is not easy to like or identify with, which didn't help. All in  all, it's a movie that you can afford to miss. Star Trek: The Next  Generation had a better episode that dealt with uncertainty about the real  reality (and I'm not that great a fan of ST:TNG), and, as I said before,  Ian Watson also did it better (not that his book was perfect). But eXistenZ  could probably be adapted to a nice TV series.
The DVD is also nothing  special. You get the usual scene selection and theatrical trailer, and the  really pathetic ""film recommendations"". The latter shows you  pictures of the covers of six other films that you might like to see.  Pictures! Static pictures! You'd think that someone with half the brain  would have put the trailers for these movies on the disc (it's not like  it's crammed too tight with material). But no, they had to put just  pictures! Sorry, got carried away a little. It's just that this really is  the most pathetic DVD feature I've ever seen.
Final comment: After  reading some of the customer reviews, I removed the obvious comparison to  The Matrix. They really are too different, execpt for the subject of  virtual reality. However, The Matrix was a well done action film, and a  really well done DVD. eXistenZ is just okay. I have nothing against the  acting or the gore or the effects, but if you want a really imaginative and  funny movie that blurs reality, see Being John Malkovich.",950313600,5,2454,4.624129930394432

Law and Liegh are two  actors that I like and love, respectively, but here they are flat. I cant  remember Liegh being this robotic since Flesh and Bone, and Law gives the  worst male lead preformance since that god-awful guy who was in Scanners.  Cronenberg must have gotten too used to actors like James Spader, Holly  Hunter, and Jeremy Irons, who seem, and probably are, effortlessly easy  actors, who understand Cronenberg (hey,not everyone can). Law and Liegh  need a little prod. In a movie so keen on the spinal column, they don't seem  to have any electricity in thiers.
Perhaps a little of that blankness,  that lack of soul, and bitter shallow from Crash bled through into this. In  Crash it made sense, but in Existenz, the labored pacing and empty dialouge  delivery go nowhere. What we need are a few thrills, a punch in the face,  that don't see coming.

not empathize with or enjoy thinking
about It much. In fact I am from
circumstances where I struggled
for years on my own with the vague
sense that something like this was
going on around me but with a
complete inability to integrate
with It or to shut It out of my
consciousness. In that regard the
comparatively light tone of this film
(light compared to other Cronenberg
features) is a little off putting to me
and nearly offensive. My experience
in similar mind-spaces to this were
completely dysfunctional.

On top of this I could not get the
circumstances to stop nor could
I verbalize my situation in way
that anyone could recognize
as a cry for help. The excite-
ment for this kind of new integrated
game culture was too high to hear
the crazed voices of those who
were screaming for aide. Add to that
a culture of silence and denial among
those most privy to the gaming
patterns and you have a sketch
of what life was like for those who
were not blessed to be hip enough
to be functionally operative or in the
know with what was happening. -:-_~

I am grateful to the filmmakers
for making a film that gives some
fictionalized explanation of a version
of what was happening in real life.
That the movie is executed in a
way that makes the consequences
of such participation seem light is a
concession to the irresistible popu-
larity that these programs were
destined to enjoy in-spite of the
protests of those incapacitated by or
alienated from the culture that hosts
them. That the film ends with some
vigilante, resistance style action
seems like artiface. I suppose,
however, that Cronenberg is
able to imagine the nightmarish
consequences for those who are
not carefully integrated into such
systems better than anyone else.

Except maybe for me.",1509926400,,2296,4.549636803874092
7891161,4,6305538018,"Cronenberg uses video game platforms as a metaphor for the conflict between mind and body. He's addressed this theme before, but never so opaquely and obliquely. The basic structure of the movie is to have the lead characters escape a confined, bleak environment using video game technology. However, it's usually out of the frying pan etc. and into another oppressive, grimy environment. We begin in a church, transport into a country gas station, from there to an abandoned ski resort and on to the stockroom of a game store--finally ending up in a dark, gloomy factory.

The most unique aspect of this movie is the use of fleshy, quivering gamepods that users use to play the game. Similar to these pods are mutant amphibians, which are harvested and used to build game components.

I think the weird quivering and wriggling motion these mutants exhibit are meant in some way to represent the struggle between mind and body. The suffering and grotesque behavior of these creatures represents the mind's attempt to escape the confines of the body--always to no avail.

Cronenberg reinforces his themes with subplots regarding conspiracy and betrayal. Pro-reality spies appear throughout the movie and try infiltrate and assassinate game players, who themselves are agents of imagination. Mind vs. Body, Imagination vs. Reality--this conflict continues thru the movie all the way to the end with no resolution.

So Cronenberg sees us as shrieking, wailing amphibian mutants, unhappy on land, unhappy in water--hopeless and forever without a resting place.

The movie has no lack of intelligence or ambition, but a great lack of clarity. Cronenberg's skills as a director are extraordinary here, inspiring fabulous work from DP Peter Suschitzky, Production Designer Carol Spier, and composer Howard Shore. But the whole movie displays too much self-indulgence on Cronenberg's part--it's one-half tour de force, one-half ego trip. Cronenberg explored the same themes in Dead Ringers, only with more restraint and more clarity.

I wish I could give it 5 stars, but Cronenberg doesn't show enough respect towards his audience's need for sense and logic.",1509408000,,2150,5.271929824561403

The idea of the film brings the viewer to question what is reality and what is not.  All the actors play their parts very well, the plot is excellent and draws the viewer in and the props are all handmade,which is awesome, no cgi.",1502755200,,354,4.603174603174603

7891166,4,6305538018,"From the brilliantly twisted mind of director David Cronenberg comes ""eXistenZ."" What is ""eXistenZ,"" exactly? A new male enhancement product? No, rather, it's a reality enhancement product; a new type of video-game/virtual reality experience, to be even more specific. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the programmer of said video game, while Jude Law plays her hapless protector and our surrogate as the audience. The further down the rabbit-hole Law's character goes, so too do we, until we are left dizzy and without words to describe what we just saw.

Early in the film, our characters are on the run from somebody who wants to do away with this ground-breaking technology. They'll have to deal with a creepy Willem DeFoe character and deadly spores along the way, while still finding time to explore their new reality and test their limitations. Cronenberg's film pretty much hits the ground running and doesn't allow us the chance to catch our breath as it levels up. Because this is vintage Cronenberg, of course there is plenty of gooey grossness to go around, the least of which are the ""portholes"" that allow would-be gamers to plug in. Those crushing on the lovely Leigh may find themselves feeling somewhat conflicted about whether the ""porthole"" exploring is sensual or nausea inducing.

Plot-wise, the film draws comparisons to other late '90s tech-thrillers like ""Dark City"" and ""The Matrix."" Heck, even the DVD box-art states that ""eXistenZ"" ""makes 'The Matrix' look like 'Child's Play.'"" Well, I don't know about all that, seeing as how I personally don't ever recall seeing a killer doll dodging bullets in that movie, but no matter. What sets ""eXistenZ"" apart is that it is less focused on its dystopian future and more focused on our present quandary in balancing technological advances with good old down-to-earth human experience. Like the best Cronenberg films, ""eXistenZ"" has a lot to say about that subject, but doesn't bludgeon or bore his audience with it. Trade the giant placenta-like sacks of skin in this film for the latest iPhone, and it's safe to say that ""eXistenZ"" was ahead of its time, to say the least.",1494720000,,2136,5.031073446327683
