6207476,5,B00HSOM9ZK,"I'm familiar with Jessica through her You Tube site, where she works hard to provide so many free workouts. I love her take on Barre! It's like working out with a good friend that happens to be in great shape!",1402617600,2,209,4.25
6207477,5,B00HSOM9ZK,"Jessica Smith never fails- this a one of the best ""barre"" style routines I have done!  She does not do the same old stuff. It is not too intensive for the balls of your feet either like most barre routines. I love the 3 different workouts on this DVD. I will always buy any workout Jessica puts out there- she knows what women need and want in at-home routines!",1393027200,7,361,4.231884057971015
6207478,5,B00HSOM9ZK,"I had no intention of buying another workout dvd, but I was intrigued by the title of this one, so I gave it a try.  Boy am I glad I did.  These three routines work out your entire body, but what I love most about them is that they work out muscles that you might not be utilizing while doing other workouts / routines.  The cardio section is reminiscent of a ballet class; it's hard work and a lot of fun.  The barre section will put you through your paces, and the stretch section will tone and lengthen you.  Each of the three sections is twenty minutes long.  Overall, this is a great workout!  I love the upbeat classical music too.  Brava Jessica!",1391644800,15,653,4.252032520325203
6207479,5,B00HSOM9ZK,"Barre Fitness with Jessica Smith, features three 20-minute routines that focus on frame, balance and functional movement.  The workouts can be done individually, or back to back for a complete 60 minute experience.  All three workouts are suited for all fitness levels, and modifications are provided where necessary (namely during jumps or other high impact moves).  There is minimal equipment needed for the workout (light hand weights which can be substituted for 16 oz. water bottles or soup cans, a sturdy chair, and yoga or children's play ball or alternatively a small pillow) Shoes are not required for this workout.

This workout was filmed waterside in beautiful Sarasota Florida.  Sunshine, breeze and beautiful sea birds provide a relaxing backdrop for the film.

The soundtrack is excellent.  Dance-y, rhythmic classical adds to the grace of the DVD and inspires fluidity, movement and motivation.

I am relatively new to Barre workouts.  I've tried others, and found they we're not for me.  Either they we're too long, hurt my back or emphasized my lack of grace and elegance.  I enjoyed this DVD from start to finish, and love incorporating individual routines into my other programs.  Inherit grace NOT REQUIRED.  :)

While the first workout on the DVD is more structured to build cardiovascular strength and endurance the remainder of the DVD is excellent for light toning, lengthening and stretching, developing posture, poise and grace.  It is an excellent addition to any workout collection, for new or older fans of Jessica Smith's routines.  2-Thumbs Up and 5 STARS from me.",1390694400,30,1596,5.17578125
6207480,5,B00HSOM9ZK,"Jessica is truly my favorite instructor because of her form, cuing, and professional and engaging workouts. This new ballet dvd is no exception. The first routine, Ballet Cardio, is so much fun. I never took ballet (more the gymnast type) but felt graceful, had fun, and worked up a nice little sweat. Workout 2 includes a series of great moves to tone your body with a pair of light weights. The third section, Floor Barre, is just wonderful. It's sneaky in that you are really worked and yet there is such a wonderful stretching component that you feel so good when done. Jessica's background in dance shines through in this workout. This one is highly recommended as it is effective, fun, and feels good.",1390176000,10,707,4.709677419354839
6207481,4,B00HSOM9ZK,"I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by this DVD. I have tried Jessica's DVDs before (10 Minute Solution), but I just couldn't get in to them. I love doing barre workouts, though, and have been building a collection of these for a while. When I saw that Jessica had a new barre DVD coming out, I figured I would give her one more try. I'm glad I gave her the benefit of a doubt!

I don't do any of Jessica's YouTube workouts (although they are free, and she has a large library to choose from), but I read an article where she wrote about some of her newest DVDs that were coming out. She said that they decided on what kinds of DVDs to do (walking, barre, etc) based on the requests she was getting from her YouTube users. She also said she wanted these new DVDs to be more like her YouTube workouts, more ad-lib and less scripted. I thought this would disappoint me, but I have to say, it was an improvement over the stilted language she used in the other DVDs I have tried.

I watched the DVD the day before attempting it (I try to do that with any new DVD so I know what to expect), and one of my first impressions was that it did not seem very professional. I believe her brother did a lot of the filming (or editing or something). At first, I was distracted by the weird things the camera does sometimes. There are times that the picture seems to slow down for a second. I was also taken by surprise by the main menu screen goes directly into the workout, no intro or anything. But once I started doing the workout, I got into it and didn't pay as much attention to all that stuff as when I was just watching it. I would have probably given it a 3 just by watching it, but since Jessica herself does such a good job, I am bumping it up to a 4. The workout itself is very good, and as I said, you get lost in it and forget about the rest :) She doesn't focus as much on form as Suzanne Bowen, but she does give enough cues to be respectable.

Cardio Ballet - I have never taken any dance classes, and the other barre DVDs I have done have not had ""Ballet""-inspired cardio. This was lots of ballet moves that I have not done, and I was a little nervous about doing them. But it is not a routine to learn, just doing one move at a time, so it was manageable. I did love the classical music in the background - it was at a very fast ""workout"" pace, but I recognized Ode to Joy among others. Jessica usually shows you 2 or 3 levels, beginning with level 1, then showing you an intermediate version, and sometimes even an advanced version. The intermediate or advanced versions are sometimes also higher-impact. You usually stick with one move long enough to really ""get it"" before moving on to another move.

Barre Burn - This is what I wanted to try the most! She uses a chair for balance (the ""barre"") and 3 lb weights in this segment. You work hamstrings, chest, arms, back, balance, seat, hips, triceps, biceps, shoulders, core, lats, and thighs. Some of this is done using the chair, some free standing. She gets a lot done quick in this one! I really felt the burn in my standing leg during some of the exercises. That's one of my favorite things about barre!

Floor Barre - This is all done using a mat and Pilates ball. I haven't done a DVD that uses a ball in forever, so this was a nice, fresh change for me. The ball sometimes seemed to make a move a little easier (behing your back for some Pilates-type work), but sometimes it really made it harder (causing you have to have to balance in a move). She covers the whole core in this one - and abs, back, obliques, hips, some lower body. There is also a short stretch at the end.",1390089600,18,3646,4.188034188034188

6207484,4,B00HSOM9ZK,"I'm so glad this video returned to the market!  This is an interesting blend of barre with classic calisthenics, a la Jessica Smith.  I do Part 1 Cardio on a mini-trampoline for extra challenge, even if it restricts my range of motion.  Part 2 Strengthening will challenge your arms, but I think Tracy Anderson's Mat workout is the best arm workout anywhere for firming the flab, with Classical Stretch a close second. Part 3 concentrates on abs (floorwork) in novel yet challenging ways.",1505606400,5,488,4.855421686746988
6207485,5,B00HSOM9ZK,I love Jessica Smith's workouts and this DVD does not disappoint. I love Barre workouts in general and this DVD is one of my favorites. I like the variety between the three sessions on this DVD. They are the perfect length to fit into my busy schedule as well.,1504137600,3,260,4.326530612244898
6207486,5,B00HSOM9ZK,"I am a former dancer and do a lot of barre/ballet workouts to stay in shape and this is one of my favourites. Although it is not an intense workout, it definitely works your muscles, and you feel energized rather than exhausted afterwards. I also think Jessica is a wonderful instructor.

6207490,5,B00HSOM9ZK,"I wasn't sure that I was going to like this DVD because I don't usually do these kind of workouts, but I loved it. For me it was a little challenging, but definitely doable. As usual Jessica has a great attitude throughout and it makes the time go by quickly and the workouts fun to do. Even though I exercise regularly I certainly felt the workouts the next day. I'm glad I purchased this DVD.",1492214400,3,394,4.266666666666667
6207491,4,B00HSOM9ZK,"I love Jessica Smith, but this set of 3 workouts was too challenging for me.  The cardio segment would have been easier with shoes (all 3 segments are done without shoes).  The second segment uses light hand weights and a chair, and I enjoyed this segment, as it was a good strength-training workout.  The 3rd segment on the floor was my least favorite.  It focused mainly on abs and stretching.  It was strange.  I'm not used to moving my body this way.

I've discovered that I enjoy Jessica's walking workouts, where she has friends working out with her.  I find the workouts Jessica does alone are tougher.",1491177600,7,609,4.626168224299065

6207500,5,B00HSOM9ZK,"I'm a huge fan of Jessica and bought this as part of ""The Ultimate Workouts for Weight Loss"" DVD set but hadn't gotten around to trying it since I've been following her Walk On program.  Wow!  I've done a lot of barre routines (Tracey Mallett, Suzanne Bowen, Leah Sarago) and while all are great in their own way Jessica packs so much into her three 20 minute segments that you really get a bang for your buck.  I loved the classical music and the fact that you can do all of these barefoot but the best part is Jessica and her cheery, can-do personality.  All you need is a sturdy chair, yoga mat or other soft surface, weights (3+ pounds) and a small playground ball.  A breakdown of the disc:

Cardio Ballet:  Lots of first position pulses, grand plies, hops, and other basic ballet moves done quickly to elevate the heart rate.  Jessica does some high impact jumping that I avoided but even then I was sweating and felt my pulse rise.  As there wasn't much of a warm up or cool down this was a very efficient cardio session.  While most moves focused on the lower body Jessica also does a series of ""swan arms"" and other arm movements to keep the entire body moving.  I didn't look at all like a ballerina or swan but it was a lot of fun!

Barre Burn:  More first position pulses and plies but with weights incorporated for toning.  Jessica uses 3 pounds but I opted for 5 and found it to be challenging.  She pairs up the exercises so everything is worked at once: grand plies with chest raises, squats with tricep kick-backs, shoulder/leg raises (that also utilize the obliques), passes (?) with bicep curls... very effective.  She finishes with modified planks on the chair for more core exercises and lunges with rows.

Floor Barre:  This segment uses the playground ball to mainly work the core and back.  The ball was a little unwieldy but I loved that she focuses on the belly ""pooch,"" as that's my problem area.  She does bridges, side planks, and other moves that target your entire waistline, along with some push up pulses, cobra, and back stretches.

All and all this DVD will have you sweating from head to toe.  No muscle group is left untouched and since the segments are short they can easily fit into busy schedules.  I'll be returning to this one quite often!  And did I mention that it's actually fun?  :)",1442361600,7,2328,4.485714285714286
6207501,5,B00HSOM9ZK,"I *love* this workout. It's been a long time since I felt a workout this much the next day. If you want to feel the burn, this is the dvd for you.",1438992000,2,146,3.59375

6207508,3,B00HSOM9ZK,"I absolutely love the scenery in this workout but to be honest,the only segment I really enjoy is the middle segment,which uses light weights. I love that this is broken down,so I can choose to do just that 1 segment. I have been using workout dvd's for many years and due to several injuries in the last few years,I have been incorporating some Barre&pilates type dvd's into my rotation. My favorites are Squeeze,Squeeze Stronger,Tracy Anderson Mat and the middle segment of this dvd! I also love the new Ellen Barrett DVD Stretch Sculpt-normally her workouts are too dull or silly for me!",1427241600,,590,4.794117647058823
6207509,5,B00HSOM9ZK,"I have been on a barre kick lately.  I've also been on a Jessica Smith kick, so I was very happy to have found this workout, which combines my two latest interests.

This workout is just Jessica, working out barefoot harbor side in Florida.  There are 3 workouts on this DVD:  Cardio Ballet, Barre Burn, and Floor Barre.  Each workout is about 20 minutes.  You have the option to play all or select which workouts you want to play.

Cardio Ballet is so much fun!  It has more of a ballet feel than a barre feel.  The music is upbeat and somewhat fast tempo.  I look nothing like a ballerina doing these moves, but I sure feel like one!

Barre Burn will make you burn!  Jessica uses a chair as a balance prop.  I especially like how Jessica has us put our hands on the chair seat and work the back of our legs.  I find this so much more comfortable than leaning on the back of the chair.  I can really concentrate on working deep into the muscle instead of being distracted by my discomfort.

Floor barre has both leg and core exercises.  You'll need a mat and a little squishy ball for this workout.  Jessica has a cute little pink ball.

Whether I do a single segment or all of the segments, I finish the workouts feelings stretched out, taller, aligned and relaxed.  If that doesn't make me want to do these workouts again, nothing will!",1424044800,3,1339,4.32258064516129

6207514,4,B00HSOM9ZK,"I wouldn't consider this ""pure"" barre, in the good sense. To me, it's even better. It combines barre exercises with pilates and sculpting moves. It's made up of three 20 minute sections: 1) Cardio-ballet (I don't think this burns as much calories as the treadmill as Jessica says, BTW) 2) Sculpting with light weights and a chair (I find annoying the stupid chair in every barre workout) 3) Core with a soft ball or a pillow. I would say the latest is my favorite. I do recommend to get a ball if you don't have one, they sell it at Walmart for 6 bucks - and I would swear it is the same as Jessica uses in the video, at least the appearance is identical. Fist time I did this one with a pillow and it was much worse.",1414972800,8,717,4.16546762589928

6207516,4,B00HSOM9ZK,"If you like ballet barre exercising, you can't go wrong here.  Three different 20 minute workouts, they stand alone nicely or do a couple if you have the time.  I have to say I don't care for the mat portion but that's just me, it's a fine workout.  The cardio is great when you want to do that, I worked up a nice sweat (and it's really got a ballet feel) and my favorite is the barre portion, a really enjoyable 20 minutes that works me all over - arms, thighs, glutes.  I like Jessica, the background is different, don't love the disco classical music but I don't really care.  Exercise DVDs run the gamut from wow, this is way too easy to are you freaking kidding me?  I don't work at Cirque du Solei -  this one is great for beginners (who might need to work up to it, but that will come quick) and intermediates alike.

6207518,5,B00HSOM9ZK,"Fun, fast and afterwards, I feel great. I love ballet, have always danced, etc. Many ballet videos are NOT ballet, or they are so boring and tedious, even my teachers would scream foul. Not so with Barre Fitness. Lots of fun, and the 60 minutes feels like half that. Since working out to this DVD, I have noticed a lot more tone to my triceps and inner thighs. I must say, they are ""waving"" to each other far less than they used to. Any woman over 40 knows what I am talking about.

I loved the outdoor setting--on the water with boats and sea birds passing in the background. The music was perfect--recognizable classical melodies (such as Beethoven's Ode to Joy and Pachelbel's Canon) arranged with a beat which worked well with the moves. There were options for those of us who prefer low impact; I was surprised at how much of a sweat I worked up with what looked initially like one of those gentle workouts.
