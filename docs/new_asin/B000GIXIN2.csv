2614120,5,B000GIXIN2,"Ok... I know what you're thinking... ""Why should I buy these two Munster movies on DVD AGAIN?""  Well, despite the fact that the packaging is stupid and ugly.  Despite the fact that there are NO bonus extras of any kind.  Despite the fact that there aren't even any trailers or chapter stops.  It doesn't matter.  These new digital transfers make seeing ""Munster, Go Home"" and ""The Munsters Revenge"" an ENTIRELY new viewing experience.

I've loved ""The Munsters"" since it's CBS premiere in 1964.  I have every episode on 16mm as well as on DVD.  I even have a 16mm print of ""Munster, Go Home"" in IB Technicolor!  NOTHING compares to Universal's crisp, new transfer!  Watching the film in in its widescreen 16x9 theatrical aspect ratio was cool enough.  But the colors!  WOW!  Herman is REALLY GREEN.  Eddie's costume is a deep PURPLE.  Lily's cheeks are BLUE.  The clarity.  The focus.  Awesome!  Even the sound is crisp and clear.  When compared side-by-side to the earlier Good Times DVD, the visual difference is shocking.  The Good Times transfer is muddy, contasty and just plain crumby by comparison.  The only SLIGHT drawback is the trade-off in aspect ratios.  The Munsters series and ""Munster, Go Home"" was shot in 35mm 1.33::1 aspect ratio.  Basically the same as what you see on TV.  In 1966, the film would have been shown in theaters cropped at the top and bottom to approximate a widescreen or ""cinematic"" look.  In other words, ""Munster, Go Home"" would have been shot in a 4x5 or ""Flat"" aspect ratio but was designed to be cropped for movie theaters.  This is the aspect ratio Universal has chosen for this transfer.  The Good Times DVD preserves the full frame, so you do get more picture information on the top and bottom.  Nevertheless, this DVD gives you about 5% more picture information on each side of the frame and, because a widescreen TV will ""blow up"" the image to fill the screen,  the overall effect is just like seeing the film in a theater in 1966.  Better, actually; because not even a 35mm IB Technicolor print could match this transfer for sharpness.

""Munster's Revenge"" is similarly sharp and clear, although it is presented as it was always intended to be seen:  in a 4x3 or ""flat"" aspect ratio.  Unfortunately the increased picture and sound quality can't make up for the fact that ""The Munster's Revenge"" is just plain painful to sit through.  Produced in 1981 as an NBC TV movie, the film reunited Fred Gwynne, Yvonne DeCarlo and Al Lewis just a mere 15 years after the series cancellation in 1966.  Nevertheless, the script is weaker than a cobweb and creakier than a coffin lid.  The actors look old and bloated.  The incredibly sharp Gwynne/Lewis comedy timing is all but gone (save for a genuinely funny scene where they sport drag in an Italian restaurant).  DeCarlo is sadly overweight, a fact hardly hidden by long black hair, billowing shrouds and careful lighting.  Gwynne's makeup is also uneven.  Just watch how his headpiece changes shape and size from scene to scene.  Only rarely do we see glimpses of the old Munster magic.  Because this story was supposed to take place 2-3 years after ""Munster, Go Home"", it was decided to recast the roles of Butch Patrick and Pat Priest.

According to Fred Gwynne, NBC had hoped a good rating would justify bring ""The Munsters"" back as an NBC prime time series.  CBS was so threatened, they put ""The Wizard of Oz"" on opposite it.  They needn't have worried.  K.C. Martel as Eddie looks like a poor kid's Scott Baio.  He looks so strange it reminds you of just how cool Butch Patrick really was.  (Proof that not every 13 year old boy can get away with wearing knickers, face paint and a Little Lord Fauntleroy jacket!) Jo MacDonnell as Marilyn looks the part, but that's about it.  According to IMDb her last professional acting credit was in 1987.  Too bad she didn't quit before she took this part!  Look for Munsters series director (and former child star) Ezra Stone in a supporting part.  Lots of old ""McHale's Navy"" performers, too.  Bob Hastings does a credible job as a new family member referred to by Yvonne DeCarlo as ""Cousin Phantomoftheopera.""  (Yep... You heard me correctly.)  Former funny-man from the 50s Sid Caesar should have stayed home.  Likewise Howard Morris.  It seems like the writers ran out of material to fill a 90 minute time period so the actors just ham it up to kill time.  The pacing is similarly dreadful.  Leaden is a better word.  Bad puns like ""I'll drink to that"" lie there like corpses.

But, in fairness, I remember that NBC ran ""The Munsters Revenge"" in 1981 with a laughtrack -- so that it would seem like a vintage episode of the series.  Editing for a laughtrack requires that ""laugh pad"" is added after a joke so that the canned laughs have a chance to subside.  The problem is, by taking the track out, all Universal has done is expose bad jokes for what they are... BAD.  But the poor comic timing isn't Gwynne and Lewis' fault.  Bad editing and weak writing will make even the best actor look like Ben Affleck in ""Pearl Harbor.""  (Now THAT's scary!)

Ah, who cares!  Munsters are great!  Munsters rule!  And this DVD combo is a must have - no matter its shortcomings!  (For extras, by the way, check out ""The Munsters: America's First Family of Fright"" DVD from Image Entertainment.  It's the perfect companion!)",1159574400,87,5350,4.6936353829557715
2614121,4,B000GIXIN2,"Although we get a bare-bones treatment here without commentaries from such surviving cast members as Butch Patrick or Yvonne DeCarlo, or even a promotional trailer, nevertheless ""Munster Go Home!"" looks great. I have the old ""GoodTimes"" release on DVD, but this comes from Universal and, unlike the GoodTimes release, this one is presented in widescreen and looks sharp and crisp. ""Munster Go Home!"" is the best of the lot as ""The Munsters' Revenge,"" as most fans know, wasn't up to par. Still, that TV movie looks great too. I am taking one star away because of the lack of extras but Munster aficionados will want to purchase this DVD.",1159401600,23,637,4.853211009174312
2614122,4,B000GIXIN2,"Well, I have read the other reviews boasting of picture quality, and purchased my own copy. My copy of the GOODTIME version of MUNSTER, GO HOME! was actually very good. But this new release is roughly a 30-35% improvement over the GOODTIME release. However the lack of scene selection is somewhat annoying. I never purchased the original dvd of MUNSTERS' REVENGE so I can't compare dvds to that, but I have a recorded from cable VHS copy that I thought looked ok. But when compared to this, it looks downright dreadful. Munsters' Revenge may not be as good a movie as Munster,Go Home. But niether one comes close to the TV Series. I have a theory as to why Pat Priest was not included in the Munster, Go Home cast. First of all had Pat been in the movie, they would have to recast Robert Pine's role because Robert Pine (Roger Morseby) would not have been a convincing suitor for Pat Priest. Also when Squire Morseby and his wife (Roger's Parents) expressed their intolerance for the Munsters, Pat Priest's Marilyn would have stood her ground better and convinced the Squire and his wife that the Colonial Munsters were nothing like their British counterparts. Therefore diminishing the intended subplot of Marilyn and Roger at odds with each other. Money was paid, locations rented, and a cast ready to go. This movie was rushed into production. Had they been able to wait a little longer we probably would have had a better Munster's movie that included Pat Priest.",1156723200,11,1467,4.734375

It's campy and silly and has somewhat lousy FX and the characters are a bit predictable and it's still a great bit of fun for a afternoon or a B-movie night marathon. The addition of Richard Dawson in his side role makes the movie a 5 star for me. Bernard Fox just adds to it. The teenaged daughter's attitude is perfectly in keeping with the time period but did make me cringe.",1451088000,,512,4.34375

Munsters Revenge was done about 5-6 years after the series ended, and while containing some laughs from Herman and Grandpa doesn't compare to the other movie.  However, at the price it overall was a great deal.",1449014400,,348,4.564516129032258
2614157,5,B000GIXIN2,"HERE it is the Munster's two movies. The original one and best long episode ever made Munster Go Home and the 81 TV movie that is not as
good as the first movie but with Gwynne and Lewis and De Carlo they make what is not a great movie a good movie! It certainly is better than
many of the 80's TV sitcom and movies and anything Hollyweird can put on TV or the big screen today! The story is pretty good and has
some funny moments for fans of the show and kids! Sid Ceaser and Howard Morris are as funny as ever and make this even more fun.
No it's not as good as the TV series that was cancelled after 2 seasons but especially today with crap being made this is two great fun
movies for the entire family. Gwynne and Lewis not only look the same but have the same chemistry they always had! A must for movie fans.",1448496000,,814,4.0
2614158,4,B000GIXIN2,"Wanted to write this review so that everyone can avoid the confusion that I had. I had previously ordered the Season Two set of ""The Munsters."" When I received that order, I got a six-disc set that includes 32 episodes, the documentary ""First Family of Fright!"", three documentaries on the main actors, and a single DVD of the two movies ""Munsters, Go Home"" and ""Munsters Revenge."" That sixth DVD is the same as this separate offering. And, that Season Two set is even listed in the ""Frequently Bought Together"" section of the page for this DVD. Since the amazon page does not say that the Season Two package includes these movies, I thought I should buy this DVD to complete my collection of The Munsters material.
Lucky for me, amazon gave me a quick refund, so no big deal. I know it's probably hard for them to keep track of this kind of stuff, but we can help by educating each other, right?",1448323200,7,896,4.5030674846625764

The first was basically the same old gags done in a movie in color, the second was a little less ""formulated"" on the series standard jokes and mixed in some new humor with the old.

I picked up these movies cause I had never seen them ever  Thanks to Nick at night and Tv Land I felt I had scene all the munsters a 100 times over  So I was curious about this as I found it on Amazon
Munster go Home  Herman inherits a castle in England  (the story explains why england and not Germany But I wondered why they choose to go that way  Germany seemed so natural of a choice)  And of course the story is Relitives try to do away with Herman and get the castle
The whole cast came back except Marilyn  No disrespect to the gals who play Marilyn but you hardly notice  small part
Munsters Revenge
Herman and Grandpa are mistaken for Wax Robots who rob people at their creaters command  Sigh  Sadly this was not as good as the first movie  IF there is an upside to this movie you get a very 60s ish feel to the movie
This time you have yet another Marilyn  She has a bigger part in this movie as she is the object of affection to the young cop trying to clear Herman and Grandpa
But this time Butch Patrick was Not Eddie
And even as he too has a small part  You miss him

I rate it 5 stars even though the second feature, ""Munsters Revenge"" is terrible.  The non-stop antics of of the Munsters in ""Munsters Go Home"", along with very funny performances from Hermione Gingold, Terry-Thomas, and John Carradine make this disc a welcome addition to anyone's DVD shelves.",1289174400,,426,4.821917808219178
2614248,5,B000GIXIN2,"TV's First Family of Fright (sans The Addams Family, who were just plain weird) get their two feature-length films showcased in this delightful DVD pack. First up is ""Munster, Go Home"", a mid-60's theatrical release that Universal used to springboard the popular characters into movie stardom right after the series ended. Lively & funny, the gang--Herman, Lily, Eddie, Marilyn and Grandpa, this time in vibrant color--is in top form with a dandy story about Herman inheriting an English mansion. Broad, ghoulish laughs abound as Herman allows his new ""lordship"" title to go to his flat head, including a shipbound romantic subplot between ""homely"" Marilyn & a dashing young English race car driver (Robert Pine, of ""CHiPs"" TV fame & real life father of ""Star Trek's"" Chris Pine). Upon arriving to claim his inheritence, it soon becomes apparent that someone wants Herman eliminated, which is linked to ""the secret of Munster Hall"". The original cast is surrounded by some terrific comic supporting players, including Terry-Thomas as a bratty, homicidal relative, Hermoine Gingold, Bernard Fox, John Carradine, and Richard Dawson. The gag-filled car race climax (with Herman driving that groovy souped-up dragster of Grandpa's invention) is a gas!
Less enchanting but still enjoyable is ""Munster's Revenge"", a made-for-TV reunion made in the early 80's. With original cast back in make-up (Marilyn & Eddie are replaced with new actors, for the obvious reason), it involves robot lookalikes of the Munsters being used to commit crimes, with Herman & Grandpa taking the rap. And so, the bulk of the film deals with Herman & Grandpa trying to clear their names, with the rest of the family off on the sidelines. Marilyn teams with the police chief's son to help her hapless relatives. There's even the addition of a new Munster relative---the Phantom of the Opera, who delights in hitting high notes which shatters everything within earshot. Legendary TV comedian Sid Caesar brightens the film as a comic villain with an accent resembling Chico Marx's, and Howard Morris steals the film (briefly) as Igor. But constricted to TV standards (and budget), it's an occasionally laborous affair as the pace drags & the laughs get corny (putting Herman & Grandpa in waitress drag is stretching it a bit!). Still, it's welcome nostalgia to see the old cast, the old Munster house & hearing those trademark Munster jokes.
Great family fare to watch with your kids during the Halloween season or all year round!",1287273600,,2498,5.14004914004914
2614249,5,B000GIXIN2,"THE MUNSTERS has to be the most popular, two-season television series of alltime.  The show only ran 1964-1966 but it has been in reruns ever since.  Apparently it's cancellation at the end of the second season was a surprise to Universal as well as the cast for the studio was in preproduction plans for a Munsters feature film, something that has only been done very few times: a movie from a television series with the original cast.  Happily, the studio went ahead with the movie MUNSTER GO HOME (1966) which gave fans a chance to see the first family of faux fright at last in color.  While not as sharp in it's satire as the original series and boasting an even paler shade of black humor, the movie is highly entertaining.

Fred Gwynne's Herman Munster has to be one of the greatest comedy creations of the small screen and works just as well on the big screen.  Yvonne De Carlo proves as she did in the series  that she was an extremely underrated comedienne while Al Lewis' caustic but lovable Grandpa remains a hoot (or is that a howl?)  Butch Patrick as the Munster spawn Eddie walks a neat line between little monster and classic tv kid.

And there's poor Marilyn.  She really is poor Marilyn this time!!  Gorgeous Pat Priest from the series was dumped for the movie in place of one Debbie Watson.  The reason appearing to be that Ms. Watson was a Universal contractee the studio briefly hoped to turn into a movie star.  Alas, they couldn't even turn her into a Munster.  Watson is a perky ingenue totally wrong for sexy blonde bombshell MM. While modestly cute, she completely lacks the va-va-voom quality of Pat Priest that made the Munster clan's belief that Marilyn (not being ghoulish like the rest of the family) was the homely one in the family so hilarious.  Watson also lacks Priest's sweet comic edge and doesn't mesh well with ""the family"".  The movie is fortunate though to have a sensational supporting cast with the great Hermonine Gingold and Terry-Thomas as their caucasian British relatives who can certainly rival the American editions in creepiness.  The print of this film is gorgeous and if the story's ultimate conclusion has a rather incredible villain, fans of the show will still find much to enjoy here.

Fifteen years later Gwynne, De Carlo, and Lewis recreated their characters for the TV-movie THE MUNSTERS REVENGE (1981) that's the second film in the collection.  Unfortunately, this lame comedy is the worst sort of horror film: it's boring.  This one gives us Gwynne and Lewis as something of an undead Laurel and Hardy, which really wasn't their interplay in the series yet an even more grave offense is reducing De Carlo's Lily to little more than a supporting part.  Eddie and Marilyn are now played by two rather unknown television actors of the day; given how small their parts are in this movie it made little sense not to bring back Patrick and Priest for these walk-ons. Only in brief moments can the script catch the ghoulish fun of the original and it's sadly clear the cast was still able if the script had been willing.  It was nice though to see Fred, Al, and Yvonne one more time back in character.

One last comment about the cool packaging: be sure to carefully remove the orange sticker from the cover that's on most copies of this DVD as it holds the spider-web cardboard box to the dvd case, there is no other way to get to the dvd case without tearing the cardboard wrap which most fans undoubtably will want to keep.",1280275200,5,3482,4.64437194127243

The first movie, Munster Go Home, was the best.  It has a haunted mansion, a road race, a family feud, young love, and crooks.  It's quite clean and I believe kids will enjoy it.  Herman does mentioned wanting to get stoned at a party, which is quickly vetoed by his wife.
The Munsters' Revenge was a little disappointing.  Museum monsters, including replicas of the Munsters, are really robots controlled by thieves.  Mother and Son were pretty much left out of the plot that is dominated by Dad and Grandpa.  We do get a little more of Spot though.",1258761600,6,775,4.532374100719425

The second movie was made a number of years later. It is the last time we get to see Fred Gwynn play Herman Munster. Although the movie itself is not very funny, it is nice to see the original Herman, Lily, and Grampa. It's obvious that all of the original cast has gotten older, particuarly Lily.
