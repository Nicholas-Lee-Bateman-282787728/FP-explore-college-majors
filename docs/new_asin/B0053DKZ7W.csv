4533840,4,B0053DKZ7W,"Peter Benchley's Amazon is not a documentary - it is a TV series. I watched it years ago and I recently wanted to view it again. I realize now that since then I have been spoiled by well-made, visually stunning series and movies. But this, in more than one way, feels like the original. The series is set in the Amazon forest, where a small group of plane crash survivors tries to deal with the perils of wilderness and local tribes. Even though the budget obviously didn't cover filming everything on site, the story still has the heavy atmosphere of a damp forest where everybody is struggling and sweating and trying to be creative in an alien world. Yes, we have seen better, but where did other TV and movie productions get their ideas from? This series is fun to watch and slow-paced, and never mind the occasional oak leaves that come into view.",1314057600,9,852,4.538961038961039
4533841,5,B0053DKZ7W,I've been waiting for this to become available for a long time.  I loved this show so much I even contacted Atlantis Alliance and ordered the VHS tapes from them years ago.  The quality of the DVDs are so much better and at a great price too.,1405641600,,242,4.127659574468085

4533844,5,B0053DKZ7W,"The predecessor to ""lost"". This movie may have started it all. A classic. Buy it, rent it, just be sure to see it! Made for TV, the budget was pretty good for then. The cast was great too.",1359849600,2,188,3.973684210526316

4533850,5,B0053DKZ7W,A different shipper never sent it to me so Amazon gave me credit which I spent here to get the item. This one came on time in great condition. I watched from start to finish. I never got to see all of it when it was on TV so now I know how the series ended. Thank you Amazon!,1324684800,3,275,3.6779661016949152

8455183,5,B0053DKZ7W,"You will be addicted after the first episode...the writing, cast and locations are breath taking. You become so absorbed in the story line, that you can't stop watching. Spoiler alert though, as the ending is less than satisfying. Nothing more to say, but get this series,please!!!",1446768000,,281,5.130434782608695
8455184,3,B0053DKZ7W,I have watched this on You Tube and will probably buy the series.  Obviously not very successful since it was cancelled after 22 episodes with a very anti-climatic ending.  You can see comparisons with this and the movie The Island about a group of pirates who abduct a 12 year old boy and claim him as their own as the tribe in Amazon initiate young Will as one of their group.  The storyline is full of twists and turns but it's never able to reach it's full potential like so many American shows but a good effort just the same.,1420329600,,531,4.29
8455185,5,B0053DKZ7W,watched the series as soon as I received it.  Loved it just wish it had a better ending.,1415318400,,88,3.888888888888889
