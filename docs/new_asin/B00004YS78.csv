1377596,4,B00004YS78,I really like this movie. It had been a long time since I had seen it. Couldn't beleive I found it on DVD. The old Bob Hope movies are fun to watch. I want to get Paleface next.,1265760000,,177,3.6842105263157894

1377599,5,B00004YS78,we really love this movie and were glad to find it on dvd.  A great family movie.,1207872000,,81,3.764705882352941
1377600,3,B00004YS78,"Why this film was a commercial failure and is critically loathed is beyond me. No, this is not one of Bob's best, not by any means. But Hope himself is in fine form, and while the film is uneven, there are enough good one liners and sight gags to satisfy his fans. Hope is ably supported by an ace supporting cast, including Phyllis Diller, Dick Sargent, and Jeffrey Hunter. Just sit back, relax, and laugh.",1082160000,10,407,4.44
1377601,3,B00004YS78,"It is rather ironic that Bob Hope (who turned 100 today) provided so much entertainment for American troops in the field from World War II to Vietnam and beyond yet could only come up with this less than stellar military comedy.  Bob plays the titular Sgt. O'Farrell, the power behind the throne on a U.S. base during World War II.  When the base turns dry, the result of a Japanese torpedo and unsympathetic officeers, the sarge comes up with a plan, involving his own private navy, to get beer to the troops.  O'Farrell is helped by Calvin Coolidge Ishimura (Mako), a Japanese deserter hiding out on the island.  Once the boys are liquored up, the next goal becomes female companionship.  The good news is that this brings Gina Lollobrigida to the island; the bad news is that it also brings Phyllis Diller, who plays Nellie Krause.  She takes a liking to O'Farrell, which makes it difficult for him to go after Gina (or ""Maria"" as she is called--but no name on earth is as good as Gina Lollobrigida).  Hope and Diller worked fine in their first film together, ""Eight on the Lam,"" but not this time around as she relentlessly pursues O'Farrell.  There is some good slapstick shtick and good lines here and there, but overall it is rather uneven.  Is this the best Bob Hope comedy film ever?  No, that remains ""Paleface,"" even above the Road pictures.  But it is not as bad as ""The Iron Petticoat"" with Katharine Hepburn.  Be glad I do not let anybody see my copy of that film.  ""The Private Navy of Sgt. O'Farrell"" is worth one look, but I would not consider it worth repeat viewings.",1054166400,3,1586,4.561837455830389
1377602,5,B00004YS78,"Of all the Bob Hope Movies during the sixties, this was one of the best (even though I loved them all). It had the slapstick with Hope and Diller playing off each other, the friendly Japanese soldier (Kinda like McHale's Navy TV Series), and just a light hearted plot that wasn't offensive to anyone. Leonard, you must have been sleeping thru this one, because you usually like the easy going movies like I do)... I just wish they would release the others, such as Boy Did I get A Wrong Number and Critic's Choice on DVD... Enjoy the fun everyone!!",1004572800,20,548,4.49
1377603,4,B00004YS78,"This is one of my absolute favorite Bob Hope movies.  The supporting cast is wonderful, and the plot is light-hearted and entertaining.  I could watch this one over and over again--and have.",984355200,7,190,4.90625
1377620,5,B00004YS78,"I'm not a fan of Bob Hope but got this for my hubby who is. I watched it with him and it was actually a good show, which I would watch again. Being a Bob Hope show it has a bunch of silly stuff, but it also has a good story line. I would recommend it.",1451433600,3,251,3.5

1377641,5,B00004YS78,"I am sure the current generation would not find this movie interesting at all, but for the time it was made, it was funny and entertaining. Bob Hope was an icon and a man no one could ever find fault with. His acting was what it was and Phyllis Diller did her thing as well (sometimes too much). As I said before, it was what it was for its time. I still don't know what was Dick Sargent's part and why it was in the movie, but I am sure there must be a purpose to it. The plot and outcome predicable again for its time. With all that said, I'd rather watch a movie like this than some of the new ones which are much too graphic and unrealistic. What was interesting, Dick Sargent was given credit, while other actors (Michael Burns) seemed to have a larger part and on the jacket not mentioned or listed at all.",1397260800,2,812,4.113207547169812
1377642,5,B00004YS78,I liked this movie when is was first released years ago and thanks to Amazon I have it and find it just as crazy and laughed just as hard now . You should see it.,1394582400,,162,3.657142857142857
1377643,2,B00004YS78,"This movie was very depressing, all the sailors who needed a woman came up short, while the Captain Hope got the best looking girl at the end to marry him. The movie dragged on, as Hope is hopeless in his older age. Calling of ""Japs"" as such not used in movies anymore, neither is the drubbing of ugly women, Diller. I can think of a lot more ugly women then Diller, but she was the but of ugly jokes here. Totally unrealistic and one of Hope's worst movies.",1386460800,,458,4.215909090909091
1377644,5,B00004YS78,I love this movie and was just as amused by watching it again. Would recommend this to anyone that loves this duo.,1377561600,,114,4.2272727272727275
1377645,5,B00004YS78,"Love this film with Phyllis Diller it was hilarious. Luckily I got to see this in the theatre. A funny film everyone in the family can enjoy. Great support was provided by Michael Burns, Bob Hope, and Gina Lollobrigida.",1361059200,,219,4.641025641025641
1377646,5,B00004YS78,"This is classic Bob Hope and Phillis Diller,very funny and entertaining. It reminds me of McHales Navy from TV. Good for family entertainment.",1348185600,,142,5.217391304347826
1377647,5,B00004YS78,"Just having Bob Hope and Phyllis Diller in a movie makes it funny.  Mix in some WWII soldiers on a back-water island,
a bunch of pretty nurses, and a sunken shipload of beer and you've got a great comedy!!",1337212800,,205,4.256410256410256
1377648,4,B00004YS78,"Another of the Brentwood Bob Hope releases.  Enjoyable, fun film with a quite good print.  No complaints about quality, but as with all these Brentwood releases, it is full-screen.",1296518400,,180,5.172413793103448
1377649,4,B00004YS78,"The Private Navy of Sgt. O'Farrell is a fun movie.  In the spirit of the Wackiest Ship in the Army, Bob Hope pokes fun at the military and particularly his rivals the Navy!  This movie was made back in the days when comedians would make movies that would make fun of the military, without degrading the service, the USA or the service members.

Don't look for any extensive combat scenes or high budget special effects.  Drop this DVD into the machine on a Saturday afternoon and watch it with a friend for a few laughs.  I watched in the theater as a child and recently my wife and I watched it together.  Not a great movie, but a fun movie.

7927438,4,B00004YS78,"No discernible plot and a senseless, rambling story line but still good for a few lighthearted moments and a chuckle or two. Basically another late 60's war-time comedy/propaganda film which ends with Bob single-handedly capturing a Japanese sub then rowing it back to base in his one-man dingy. The main 'theme,' however, seemed to revolve around reclaiming a large shipment of beer (Pabst Blue Ribbon) that was thoughtlessly sunk by said submarine. Equally unlikely was Bob's romance with Gina Lollobrigida. But it was Phyllis Diller's contribution (as nurse Krause) that was truly priceless. While her intended role as 'morale booster' for the isolated sailors and soldiers out in the Pacific fell a bit short of their expectations, she did provide plenty of comic relief for the audience. Her bit was really what made the film worth watching.",1500854400,,846,5.182481751824818
