8496868,5,B0002PUDI2,"The Media Training Worldwide tapes are extremely effective in providing the information one needs to prepare and deliver professional presentations.  Although I purchased the entire tape series, this tape is sufficiently comprehensive in highlighting many of the topics covered in the series.  It includes tips relevant to the scope of the presentation, preparation of Powerpoint slides, and practicing and delivering a presentation. While Media Training recommends it as a month long seminar, one can sit through it in about 1 hour and get the extremely useful advice one needs to prepare a successful presentation.  I strongly recommend the full series of tapes for those who seek a thorough training seminar in a short timeframe.  For those with limited funds, this tape is an excellent starting point.",1100563200,,805,5.365079365079365
