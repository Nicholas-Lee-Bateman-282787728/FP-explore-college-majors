211870,5,6300167003,"I don't care what people say, this is an adorable movie.  I really like the old jalopy featured too.  I can barely remember them, as I was a little, very little child while they were still around.  The film version of jive talk is interesting, in a fun way, as representing the period, if you are interested in those types of cultural changes.  Every new generation thinks they have the newest and best version, that they came up with themselves, but that is far from the truth of it.  I found some personal irony in the film too.  While her parents are scheming, grandpa mentions his ""perpetual motion invention,"" which is what the free energy scam was called then.  My own father was one of those guys who thought he had the ""secret.""  When I finally suggested that he patent his idea, he refused, suspecting the government, or someone would have him killed.  So my slightly eccentric, paranoid father died with his secret, not suspecting that the fraud was so well known, even then (known in the 19the century, in fact!), that it was used as an off-hand joke in this Shirley Temple film.  But the film is fun, cute and entertaining.  It ought to be put out on DVD, perhaps part of a new Temple collection.

By the way - Thank you Shirely Temple (Black), I love you.",1265932800,5,1268,4.489082969432315
211871,4,6300167003,"Shirley Temple starred in this movie when she was at that difficult age when most child stars founder and disappear forever.  It's a pleasant, easy to watch movie, although today's kids probably won't care for it much.  Annie Rooney (Shirley Temple), the daughter of an unsuccessful inventor, and her friends meet at each other's houses to dance and have fun.  Listen for the forties slang!  When Annie meets a new boy, and a rich one at that, she teaches him the slang and the dances and he becomes infatuated.  This movie has some well-known character actors and some young actors who became better known later.  Annie's best friend is a scream.  It's particularly funny to hear Annie's father trying to interpret what the kids' slang is saying (""I feel like I'm hearing a foreign language!"") with the grandfather's help.  And Temple is adorable as always, but really gives a pretty good performance, especially considering her age.  A charming movie; well worth watching more than once.",1109980800,15,989,4.945454545454545

7803627,5,6300167003,Can't find this anywhere else! I bought this immediately because it is one of my favorites. Shirley Temple is wonderful as always and the story is so innocently sweet. Great for the family to watch or just a classic movie night.,1386460800,,228,4.585365853658536
7803628,4,6300167003,"Cute movie for all the Shirley fans! It's cool to see them dancing the jitterbug! The quality of the tape is pretty good, it's nice that it's colorized, (or you could always decrease the saturation on your tv temporarily to watch it in B&W) one more Shirley Temple movie added to the collection.",1375056000,,295,4.584905660377358
7803629,5,6300167003,"This is an adorable movie starring a teenaged Shirley. She was about 14 years old or thereabouts. There are some great dance sequences for those who are interested in how the jitterbug was done back in the 1940's. Shirley and her friends speak 1940's jive. The plot is similar to her previous movies, but it's a fun, feel-good film that the entire family can enjoy. I hope this movie is issued on DVD. I lucked out and found a colorized VHS copy here on Amazon, but I'm hoping a box set of Shirley's teen-age films will be issued.",1370736000,4,530,4.418367346938775

7803631,4,6300167003,"1942 B&W Shirley Temple, Guy Kibbee, Dickie Moore. I enjoy Shirley Temple as a teenager. She does not lose all her talent as she becomes older. Shirley is 14 and this it the second film she made after her Fox contract expired.  Captain January (Guy Kibbee)costars with her again as her loving and protective grandfather. Child star, Dickie Moore plays her love interest and gives Shirley her first on screen kiss(Hardly a peck on the cheek). The acting is very good in this film, but it is not always a cheerful plot. The movie was made during World War II and it portrays that time period.
Many people seem to think that ""A Kiss for Corliss"" (AKA Almost a Bride) is a sequel to this movie, but it has nothing to do with it.  As a Shirley Temple fan I would rank this movie at 37 out of her 46 movies.",1311638400,4,801,4.298013245033113
7803632,5,6300167003,"Even though all of Shirley Temple's movies were made before I was born, I still love her movies -- no matter how old she is in them.",1308960000,,132,3.925925925925926
7803633,5,6300167003,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would enjoy very much seeing the industry come out with more films of Shirley Temple in her later years. I believe she is a wholesome, entertaining actress, no matter her age.",1286236800,3,216,4.7105263157894735
