7923182,2,B00004TX5Z,"2 G's & a Key is your typical, straight-to-video urban flick.  The story involves Curtis (played by Conroe Brooks) getting back into the drug game after spending several years in prison.  To make matters worse, he has to deal with a dealer he double-crossed, other vengeful dealers, and shifty women.

The story is unoriginal, and the acting is downright terrible.  The film is written and directed by Paul Wynne, whose portfolio includes a number of other low-budget movies that went straight to video.

The only reason why I gave the movie two stars instead of one is because of the decent comedic performance by Warren, Curtis' trusty sidekick.  The irony is that I can't recommend the actor, because he had his name replaced with a pseudonym in the film's credits out of embarrassment.  The only thing I like about this movie is that it's so bad, it's intentionally entertaining.",1263945600,,883,4.885906040268456

THE ACTING WASN'T ALL THAT GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE'S ACTUALLY OK. THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST GANGSTA MOVIES TO HAVE COME OUT IN THE PAST 5 YEARS. IT'S WORTH RENTING.",1071705600,,311,4.2
