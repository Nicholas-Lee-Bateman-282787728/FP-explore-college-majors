8531735,1,B008XAT1A4,"I've enjoyed other movies by the renowned directtor Andr&eacute; T&eacute;chin&eacute;, but this one just didn't work for us. The concept is a promising and quirky one: an author of detective stories engages detectives in real life to tail his daughter and his wife. And it's filmed against the scenic background of Venice. But it turned out to be a big disappointment. The characters simply weren't interesting or sympathetic. And the revelations that the detectives tracked down stimulated yawns rather than shock. To top it off, the film included a gratuitous scene of simulated (I hope) animal abuse. Not an enjoyable movie,",1487635200,,628,5.227722772277228
8531736,4,B008XAT1A4,"It's virtually impossible to describe Unforgivable (Impardonnables), a deceptively simple slice-of-life story about two years in the life of a French couple who meet, fall in love, and marry in Venice.

A story with no real beginning, middle, or end, writer-director Andr Tchin's 19th feature is an exquisitely crafted, brilliant, confusing, disordered, maddening, and wonderfully flawed film that tries to show life as it is lived.

A master psychologist, Tchin creates characters who are changeable, fickle, contradictory, pulled to and fro by desires they scarcely understand.

Above all, they are incomplete and they suffer for it.

Changing Times (2004) is about a man who waits three decades for the love of his life finally to return to him. The Girl on the Train (2009) is about a young woman who tries to feel needed, important, and complete by falsely accusing a group of black and Arab men of attacking her in an anti-Jewish pique.

Tchin's latest entry stars Andr Dussollier as Francis, an aging French mystery writer (""the king of neo-gothic thrillers,"" critics call him) who decides to write his next book in Venice. Looking for a house to rent, he meets and immediately falls for his real estate agent, Judith, a former model played by the always radiant Carole Bouquet.

White-maned and with the hint of a white beard, Francis is charming, charismatic, and smart. We're immediately taken by him - despite his absurd decision to invite Judith, within three minutes of meeting her, to move in with him.

We jump ahead 18 months to find the couple living an idyllic life in their rustic island home outside Venice. Things begin to sour when Francis' daughter Alice (the cherubic Mlanie Thierry) and 12-year-old granddaughter Vicky (Zo Duthion) come for a visit.

Alice, who was herself a teenager when she had Vicky, is petulant, perpetually angry, and rebellious. She tells Judith that Francis drove her mother to suicide, then takes off to party with her drug-dealer friends, leaving her father to care for Vicky.

""There should be a ban on reproduction,"" Francis later tells a friend. ""It's the only way out of guilt.""

Francis' obsessive need for control drives him to hire a private investigator to tail Alice, who, meanwhile, has decided to leave her family for good. Francis hires a second person to follow Judith, convinced she is having an affair.

If we once found him charming, giving, now we see in him a vain control freak. Like all people, he's both.

Tchin keeps the plot simple, yet continuously adds new layers to his remarkably memorable characters.

Francis and Judith's small circle of friends includes the P.I.; Anna Maria (Adriana Asti), who was once Judith's lover; and her son, Jrmie, a sullen, violent 24-year-old man-child who lures gay men only to beat them up.

So who or what is unforgivable? Parents, for having children? Jrmie, for his hateful, violent outbursts? Alice, for abandoning her child? Francis, for his creepy obsession over the two women in his life?

There are no revelations in Unforgivable, no epiphanies, and above all no resolutions. Only the constant movement of life and the chance events that lead us to make and break connections.

As Tchin knows all too well, it's impossible to capture life in a story - all stories invariably simplify the truth. But he comes close with Unforgivable. Its characters will haunt you long after you see it.",1474588800,,3404,4.987632508833922
8531737,2,B008XAT1A4,"The best thing about this film is the cinematography.  There are some nice shots of Venice and surroundings.  Other than that, there's nothing to like.  The characters were unrealistic and unlikable.  The plot is absurd.  Don't bother.",1375747200,3,235,5.243243243243243
8531738,4,B008XAT1A4,"The movie is a special one because of its way of the camera perspectives. It gives you many impressions and it holds on the fantastic atmosphere. Good setting with actors, who play Vers good. The film is one of a famous producer. So it makes fun and produces fear thriller like. In my opinion the movie is more for people who like movies like this because the jumping perspectives is not for everyone. Fantastic movie with ansolutely good actors, good atmosphere. Like it.",1374192000,,472,4.698795180722891
8531739,4,B008XAT1A4,"I was recently browsing the foreign movie section of my local library and stumbled upon this. I read the DVD jacket and when I saw that Carole Bouquet was one of the leading performers in this, I immediately picked it up.

""Unforgivable"" (2011 release from France; 112 min.) brings the story of Francis (played by Andr&eacute; Dussollier), a successful writer who is looking for a place to rent in Venice while looking for source material for his next novel. Francis meets Judith (playewd by Carole Bouquet), who runs a real estate agency in Venice. Francis immediately falls for her and eventually they get married and settle in. Alas, all the happiness in the world can't help Francis to get rid of his writer'e block. Meanwhile, Francis' daughter Alice comes to visit and then disappears mysteriously, causing great concern to Francis who ends up hiring Anna Maria, an old acquaintance of Judith, as private investigator. Last but not least (if you are still following me), there is Jeremie, Anna Maria's son who was just released from prison. Will Alice be found safely? What about Jeremie's role in all this? And will any of this have an impact on the marriage of Francis and Judith? To tell you more would ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see it for yourself.

Couple of comments: even though this is billed as a drama and there are the obvious questions that may have a slice of mystery to it (suc as what happened to Alice), this movie is pretty much a ""talkie"" in which a lot is said and not much drama or mystery is created. That said, once it became clear to me what kind of movie this was, I adjusted my expectations accordingly and I ended up enjoying it. Beware: it isn't until late in the movie when we fully realize what the movie's real focus is. The other reason I really enjoyed it is of course Carole Bouquet, whom I hadn't seen in a movie in quite some time (i grew up in Belgium and saw quite of few of her movies there). Now in her mid-50s, if you can believe it, she is still quite the beauty. Last but not least, the scenery in and around Venice and the surrounding Laguna is nothing short of spectecular and pure eye-candy. Bottom line: if you are in the mood for something different than your usual Hollywood fare, try this movie and chances are you'll enjoy this more than you'd thought.",1369612800,,2330,4.558472553699284
8531740,3,B008XAT1A4,"Director Andre Techine (Wild Reeds) is known for his studies of characters who long to connect to other people but whose own resistance to single identities/lives makes it virtually impossible for them to do so. As a result his nomadic characters often become disillusioned with relationships altogether and often seek refuge in art which allows them greater fluidity than real life. Techine's best film Wild Reeds (1994) was exciting because the characters were at that point in life when they were just discovering what they believed to be their true (and solitary) natures; Unforgivable is about what such characters might be like once they reach middle age (or beyond)and realize they are tired of being alone.

Techine divides the film into four parts, each named for a season.

Autumn: The central character, Francis (Andre Dusollier), is an established writer of some renown, who moves to Venice to work on his latest ""neo-gothic thriller."" As soon as the 65 year old Francis sees his much younger travel agent Judith (Carole Bouquet who is actually 55 but looks 35), he immediately invites her to live with him in his island villa. Since he doesn't even know her there is no way to interpret this love at first sight as anything more than lust at first sight. But, for reasons unknown, Judith accepts. End of part one.

Summer: When the film resumes, it is 15 months later, and judging by the looks of things it would appear that this love or lust at first sight has worked out and suits them both quite well, but when Francis' adult daughter/actress, Alice, and her daughter Vicky come to visit, Alice doesn't take the relationship seriously and she tells Judith she shouldn't take it seriously either because her father will eventually tire of her just as he has of all of his previous lovers. This infuriates Francis. In Francis' view, Alice ruins everything, but we can see that restless/artsy Alice is actually a lot like her restless/artsy father, and we cannot help but think she may well be right. Alice is unhappy with her life as wife and mother and daughter, and so she is barely there a day when she decides to slip away into the night with a young lover (who happens to be a young Venetian aristocrat, albeit a ruined aristocrat who must support himself with shady art and drug deals). Francis reacts by hiring a detective to find Alice because he wants to bring her back to her family even though Judith cautions him to let Alice live her own life. And, as we find out in the course of this story, that is exactly what Francis and Judith have both always done -- they each have a history of casting off old lovers once the passion begins to fade.

Winter: Francis and Judith's love has cooled. Francis hires one of Judith's ex-lovers, Anna Maria (Adriana Asti), and Anna Maria's ex-con son Jeremie to trail and discover the respective truths about his daughter Alice and his lover Judith who he no longer trusts. In this section Francis bonds with Anna Maria (with whom he shares a few words about the inevitable guilt that comes with being a parent) and he bonds with her son (apparently because he cannot bond with his own daughter)but the son has even more difficulty connecting to people than Francis does and the relationship is always awkward and strained (and like everything else in this film, not altogehther believable).

Spring (spoilers): In the last section, the characters start finding ways to come to terms with themselves and each other and they start finding ways to connect but since the characters are not that interesting to begin with you are not that invested in them or their sudden and unexplained changes of heart. Plus Francis and Judith's last act reunion (suddenly and inexplicably full of passion again) is no more believable than their first act seduction. Every scene where Francis and Judith are supposed to show desire for each other is forced/unconvincing/passionless/emotionless.

The title refers to both parental and relationship guilt, but its never made clear exactly how one form of guilt is related to or contributes to (or if it is related to or contributes to) the other. Nor is it clear what inspires Francis' change of heart towards Judith. And nothing about Judith is ever explained (least of all her attraction to men and women who look old enough to be her parents).

It is an intriguing premise -- a detective novelist who must rely on real-world detectives to help him discover the truths about the people in his life. Unfortunately nothing feels particularly genuine in this film. The Venetian settings, the character's and their professions and desires, the romantic epidodes, the strange and unexpected bursts of violence, the mystery plot, all seem the stuff of fiction. And the unreality of the characters (and the strange way they are each disconnected from life and each other) is not particularly interesting and after the first hour of this two hour film patience for these characters wears thin.

I stuck with it but only because I like some of Techine's other work. I have no idea why Jonathan Rosenbaum (a critic/essayist I greatly admire) put this on his 2012 Top Ten List.",1367193600,3,5159,4.834654586636467
8531741,1,B008XAT1A4,"I rented this movie because I have loved every movie by Andr Tchin I've ever seen, and I've seen most of them. After I had received the DVD in the mail but right before I watched it (Thank God!) I read several online reviews warning that it contains an appalling depiction of cruelty to an animal&mdash;a dog, evidently. I wish I had seen those reviews before I put this movie in my DVD queue; I'm just very grateful that I read them before watching it.

ALL animal cruelty depicted in a movie is gratuitous and inexcusable, by the way, and it doesn't matter AT ALL whether the abuse is real or simulated. Whether the animal hurt was alive or a very well-crafted prop doesn't matter to me as a viewer, although those who do hurt real animals for entertainment&mdash;and movies are entertainment&mdash;deserve to have the same things done to them (and, thank God, again, that's exactly what will happen eventually).

Shame on Andr Tchin! What he did here is what's Unforgivable. He is one of the greatest modern movie directors, but after this he's off my list forever. Although I just got the DVD, and it's sitting in the player right now, I'll send it back to the rental company unwatched. By an act of superhuman will I am not going to crack the DVD first, but I sure would like to.

I have never before written a review of a movie I didn't see or a product I didn't use. I ordinarily disapprove strongly of reviewers who do such things, but this is not an ordinary situation. My personal experience with the movie is less important than spreading the word of the abuse it contains in any way I can.

I sincerely thank those earlier reviewers who published the warning, and I now pass it on to the next generation of movie-lovers who are considering this movie and care about animals. If those earlier reviewers were lying, if they have induced me to disparage this movie unfairly, I regret that, but it's a risk I'm willing to take for the sake of the animals and others who genuinely (and not just glibly to make themselves sound good) love animals. To those of you who despise people like me, I say: I couldn't care less what you think.",1359417600,5,2141,4.510309278350515
