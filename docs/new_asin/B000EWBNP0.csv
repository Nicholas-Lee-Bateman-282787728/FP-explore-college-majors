8114878,1,B000EWBNP0,"""Double Exposure"" is the title of a bio-pic telling the story of Margaret Bourke-White. That was what I thought I was ordering. What arrived was a gay porn movie starring two pairs of twins. It is still in its cellophane wrapper.",1237939200,,229,4.609756097560975

8114880,2,B000EWBNP0,Double Exposure is a movie based on the life of photo journalist Margaret Bourke White who worked in this field at a time when it was male dominated. She was actually kicked on the set of the movie.  It stars Farah Facette and Fredrick Forest. Parts of this movie were filmed in Russia. Candice Bergman played the role of Margaret Bourke White in the movie Gandhi. She interviewed some high profile people and did some controversial stories. I'm sure Bourke White's life was more interesting than this movie. It's long and boring. I purchased it only because I was an extra on the set of the movie in the parts which were filmed in New Orleans.,1219363200,,644,4.551724137931035
