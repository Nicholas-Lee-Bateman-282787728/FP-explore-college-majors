5015244,5,B006S314SA,"I consider myself to be an advanced exerciser, but have never done any of Leah Sarago's workouts before getting the three Signature Series DVDs.  I had heard such raves about her downloads and these DVDs on the Video Fitness forum, though, that I decided to give them a try.  Although I have done workouts like Booty Barre, Rockin Models, Physique 57, and Core Fusion before, I had been worried that the Ballet Body workouts would be too advanced for a newbie like me.  While they are definitely challenging, they are fun and tough -- and I'm so glad that I got them!

As other reviewers mentioned, the Lower Body workout will have you shaking, but in a good way!  It's tough, but you can start by taking more frequent breaks if you need to or by doing half the reps.  This particular workout is divided into half standing work and half mat/floorwork. The workout runs about 54 minutes long, and you'll need a mat and a chair or ballet barre to do it.

One of the only negatives in this and the Core workout is that sometimes I had a hard time seeing the angles and positioning of Leah's body.  Instead of shooting her straight on, the camera sometimes shot from a side view, which made it hard for me to see the exact placement.  I'm hoping that as I do this DVD more, though, I'll be able to make sure that my positioning is correct.

On her website, Leah also has posted various rotations for using the DVDs. (I would include the link here, but usually Amazon won't allow you to include links in reviews; if you look at the product description above, though, you'll see it.)  Here is a basic rundown of some of the rotations:

BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE:
Day 1 Lower Body
Day 2 Cardio for 30-40 mins.
Day 3 Core
Day 4 Cardio for 30-40 mins.
Day 5 Upper Body
Day 6 Cardio for 30-40 mins.
Day 7 Rest day

INTERMEDIATE:
Day 1 Lower Body
Day 2 Core + Cardio for 30-45 mins.
Day 3 Upper Body + Cardio for 30-45 mins.
Day 4 Rest day
Day 5 Lower Body
Day 6 Core + Cardio for 30-45 mins.
Day 7 Upper Body

ADVANCED:
Day 1 Lower Body + Cardio for 30 mins.
Day 2 Core + Upper Body
Day 3 Lower Body + Cardio for 30 mins.
Day 4 Rest day
Day 5 Core + Upper Body
Day 6 Lower Body + Cardio for 30 mins.
Day 7 Core + Upper Body

For cardio, Leah suggests that you do things like dance workouts, cycling, or swimming -- activities that won't ""bulk"" you up.

I'm just starting a six-week rotation using these, so I'll be sure to update my reviews of each DVD as I continue with this program.

Overall, though, I really love each of these workouts, and am eager to see what changes they'll bring.

UPDATE AFTER THREE WEEKS:  I did the Intermediate rotation using all three DVDs for three weeks (after which time I had to stop working out for a few weeks due to some stitches), and loved the results I was getting!  My abs and arms were noticeably tighter, and I could see more muscle definition.  My legs seemed to lag behind a bit, and I felt like my saddlebags were a little more prominent, but perhaps that is because I needed to add in a bit more cardio. These are great workouts, and I look forward to starting back up with them!  The next time, I will take measurements to track my results better.

UPDATE ON 5/22/12:  I put something in my original review about how I thought that this workout made the sides of my thighs (the saddlebag area) bulge out more, but I think that that was the result of the program I did right before this one, which was Chris Freytag's 10 Pound Slimdown Extreme.  I plan to give Leah's rotation another go some time this summer, when I have a bit more time to work out for longer periods.",1330560000,17,3604,4.264705882352941
5015245,5,B006S314SA,"I am a life long exerciser and have tried every type of workout. I've become a big fan of the barre workouts in the last two years. I wanted to get away from high impact exercises and yes-- bulking from heavy weights although the experts say that heavy weights don't bulk you up (just observe how Cathe's physique has changed since her STS series-- she looks much bulkier and thicker than she used to). Perhaps its the shape of the muscle that heavy weights create that gives that impression, but in any case, I much prefer my slender physique since I switched to barre workouts. Variety is important to keep things fresh so I'm consistently seeking new challenging advanced Barre workouts to add to my rotation, and what a find this has been! I love everything about it, the slower pace, which allows for greater  mental focus in working deep into the muscle, the count system and number of exercises per set (mostly 3 sets of 8 before changing), which I find perfect, as knowing when the set will end gives you permission to push yourself to your very edge of fatigue rather than conserving your energy to make it through the whole set, a highly efficient way to change the shape of a muscle quickly.  The moves are slightly different than those in the other barre workouts, for example she use a unique pattern of circular side rotations and angles that elongate the hips. I appreciate her calm voice-over and form pointers and find the music hypnotic and complementary to the focus required, but an option to do the video without music is available. I bought all 3 of her DVDs and each one is professionally executed and effective and offers something new from what's out there. I highly recommend this DVD but will require modification for beginners until they grow stronger. For those new to barre workouts, I also recommend The Bar Method, both of Tracy Mallet's advanced barre workouts, the Core Fusion DVDs (all excellent), Pure Barre, Rocking Models, Squeeze Stronger, Cardio Barre and Cathe's Turbo Barre. I also did Physique 57, Tonique and Tracy Anderson workouts for some time but quickly tired of the instructors' personalities and experienced strain injuries from repetitively overworking the accessory muscles of the same body part for sets that went on much too long.",1329091200,88,2285,4.811704834605598
5015246,5,B006S314SA,"I am a subscriber to Ballet Body downloads since June 2010. I have all of Ballet Body downloads and the Periodization System. I love everything Leah Sarago has put out and I have been anxiously waiting for the Ballet Body Signature Series to be released. The wait was worth it!

Ballet Body Signature Series Lower Body is an intense workout that will have your legs shaking with every exercise! Leah has you working your thighs, hamstrings, and glutes to a point of failure with a series of plies, foldovers, and bridge sequence. My legs were shaking from the very first exercise and didn't quit until the end of the workout. I was sweating a lot and my heart rate was elevated thoroughout the whole workout. Leah works your thighs first, then your glutes/hamstrings, then your thighs again, then your glutes/hamstrings, etc. It is nonstop action. Plus I really enjoyed the music that Leah used for the Signature Series especially with the lower body dvd. I found the beat and rhythm of the music kept me focused during the exercises and motivated me to keep going. Leah completes the lower body dvd with a series of stretches that elongates and relieves any tightness your legs may have after the workout.

Get the dvds...you won't be disappointed!",1327881600,10,1249,4.804651162790698
5015247,5,B006S314SA,"I love barre work and I love working my lower body, so it is no surprise that I absolutely love this DVD.  Leah's physique is inspiring, which motivates you to feel the burn and go just a bit lower in each and every plie squat.  The exercises are well-choreographed; Leah alternates between quad (plie, parallel squats and lunges) and glute/hamstring work (foldover and sitbacks).  The sequencing is truly genius, as it allows you to intensely challenge all of the muscles in your legs by giving the muscles rest in between each set.  Most barre workouts - to my knowledge - work the quads until exhaustion first and then begin to work on the glutes.  Once again, Leah's variations are truly unique, and it's those small differences and variations that make this DVD particularly challenging.

What I loved most about this DVD was that it concluded with the most wonderful 15-minute stretch, which felt great after all the quad and butt-burning!",1327881600,9,945,4.875
5015248,5,B006S314SA,"As I stated before: I am a Heavy girl, and I don't have a lot of time: This will not waste your time: do not let your weight deter you from getting these. [or time!] And then supplement them with leah Sarago's ballet body downloads. [again just do a google, you'll find them and they work hand in hand with the dvds].

Regarding the dvds:
Leah will slay you dead - and the beautiful part is that just when you think your thighs can't take anymore, guess what: glute time! and then rinse and repeat. The sequencing is magical, and just enough work and holds for you it to make a difference. Leah Sarago knows what she's doing and the results are nothing you've never seen - because you actually DO see them

[please note: Leah does work the thighs a LOT - so if you are prone to ""bulking"" I strongly suggest you do a good 15 minute stretch everytime you use this dvd. It helps your muscles develop properly, especially your glutes, which you work a lot anyway].

Your heart rate will go up, your legs will look fantastic. There is are rotations available to get maximum results. Again, regardless of your age or size or time, this will do the trick. [and supplement with the downloads! 93+ and counting!].

I always say Leah is love and I LOVE these dvds. Buy them. Do them. Get Results.
I am, and Ive lost almost 100lbs.",1327795200,121,1320,4.353658536585366
5015249,5,B006S314SA,"I've been doing Leah's downloads for quite a while and can never stop singing her praises.  Here, she compiles the best of her lower body work.  You will feel this, everywhere in your lower body.  She does not overwork the quads as many workouts do.  Everything gets worked here and by the time you hit the floor to do bridge work, you'll be wiped out.  It's all worth it because Leah delivers both in strength and aesthetics.  You will not bulk but you will get a strong, leaned defined lower body.  This is not a beginner's workout but you can build into it by doing half the reps.  She helps you build strength fast, so it won't be long until you can do the whole workout.  It will never be easy because you will continually refine your form and go deeper into position so you will remain challenged, and you'll look great coming and going!",1327708800,13,843,4.387096774193548
5015250,5,B006S314SA,"As a weekly download subscriber of the Ballet Body segments since the very beginning, I was pretty excited for this series to come out.  I really wasn't sure what to expect with the Lower Body DVD, since I felt like Leah has thoroughly covered that area with her segments - how could it be anything new or better?!  Well, I was wrong - this DVD is amazing.  I really thought it would be my least favorite of the 3 DVDs and it turned out to be my favorite (if I had to pick a favorite!).  Its like the very best of Ballet Body all in one DVD.  Its like Leah took all the best lower body segments and put them on this dvd.  She alternates between thigh work and glute work.  Just when you think you can't take it anymore, she switches to something new and your thighs (or glutes) get much needed ""rest"" by moving on to the next exercise.  The real zinger comes near the end with some bridge exercises that thoroughly exhaust the glutes.  I could barely life my seat off the ground at that point!  This DVD is tough and would probably be tough at first if you are a beginner.  But trust me on this - this method is genius.  If you stick with it and go at your own pace, you WILL see results.  Leah knows her stuff!  And it is very clear by the shape she is in for these DVDs.  She looks absolutely flawless!  Other things you might want to know - the music is good, in my opinion.  The instruction is voice over (which you have the option to turn off if you want).  The set is nice - the lights are dimmed down, but you can see Leah very well.  The stretches at the end are ahhhhhmazing after the hard work you do in this DVD. Overall, I am really, really happy with this DVD (and the others in the series).  Leah really outdid herself!  I have no idea how she'll top these with her next set (assuming that there will be one!  Pretty please Leah?!).",1327708800,8,1846,4.126404494382022
5015251,5,B006S314SA,"I've been using Leah's downloads for several months now, and I was waiting quite anxiously for her Signature Series DVDs. The wait was totally worth it. I've done the Lower Body DVD twice now, and it's amazing. She doesn't rep moves to death, and she changes positions at the bar several times, so it's never ""plain"" or boring. After 20 minutes at the bar doing variations in plies, fold overs and lunges there's a short section in bridge that's just killer (my thutt cries every time), and she finishes things up with a well deserved deep stretch.

I don't have a proper bar, but I have a pull-up bar that I adjust waist high in a door frame. I got it here at Amazon for about 40 dollars and it works great - almost as good as a fixed bar. I've used my balcony railings too.

You'll be working your legs deeply and everywhere, and you can do it as hard or as easy as you want. This is my favorite workout of the three, probably because my legs are rather strong compared to my arms and core... but that's another story :P",1327708800,6,1022,4.290155440414508
5015252,5,B006S314SA,"I love the Ballet Body series videos. I am not a barre beginner and this is a good video for all levels. I was worried about getting something too easy or not challenging, and I was happily surprised by the contents, format and routine.",1475107200,2,236,4.386363636363637
5015253,4,B006S314SA,"I enjoy Leah Sarago's DVD's very much as she uses voice over cues and the scene and music are great. The leg work is very minute and cool, but one still must warm up and be very careful not to hurt their achilles tendons. It is also too long for one workout at 54 minutes. I haven't tried to see if the DVD separates the workout into chapters, but find doing one section for 20 minutes is plenty. I would prefer Sarago had made the long version and then set it up so a person could do a 20 minute session. The moves are clever and tough. I like that she really does seem to want to create a ballet body and not a bulky one.",1471910400,7,623,3.9523809523809526
5015254,5,B006S314SA,I can't speak for wether or not this dvd would or  would not be good for dancers the review have been mixed on that. This is defintely not for a beginner in fitness.

However, 7 lbs. & a few months later I decided I needed to do something to get into shape. If you're a newbie like me, as long as you're ok with taking frequent breaks throughout the video it will kill you, in a good way! I can tell I'll barely be able to walk tomorrow. My usual form of exercise is exclusively yoga since I have bad knees & detest cardio.

The music is upbeat and her direction is perfect. Its a voice over, so when you watch her she is not talking but you hear a voice provide direction in-sync with the moves she does.

 I own quite a few ballet/cardio exercise DVD's but wanted one that focused specifically on the lower body. The other ballet inspired exercise videos all have a cardio section; and while that is great, I just wanted a low impact one that concentrated on just that.
It's somewhat slow moving in the beginning but builds up. She incorporates different moves that the other instructors do not have on theirs.

Leah is more muscular, more bulky in her shoulders and thighs than others doing ballet type DVDs such as Mary Helen Bowers (an actual ballerina), who have a less muscular but leaner build. So this is more of a fitness video with dance inspired moves but it's not done by a ballerina nor does it involve ballet.",1405382400,,405,4.413333333333333

5015288,4,B006S314SA,"I've done all three of Leah's Signature Series and consider this the easiest (the upper body I still can't get through).  That doesn't mean it's not challenging, however!  She is very good at using different moves to work the most muscles possible and switches focus the minute you think you can't do anymore.  By that I mean she'll kill your thighs, shift to the glutes, return to the thighs, etc.  The mat work at the end is almost entirely is glute work and had me feeling the burn.  I liked the bridge positions as they are great for the back muscles as well as your legs.  She also does a wonderful and comprehensive stretching routine at the end, which is to me is a rarity.

I have a few issues with this DVD, though.  I didn't know if I was in proper form during some of the exercises, which could be why I thought it was easier than it really might be.  The lack of pointers regarding how exactly to perform the moves didn't dissuade me from using the DVD, I just wish I knew if I was doing things correctly.  I realize Tracy Anderson provides zero instruction but because Leah is more precise and the moves slower a bit more information would have been helpful.  My other main gripe was that some of exercises were a little difficult to do even with a sturdy chair and mat.  Again, it's possible I was not using the correct form and could be why I had some trouble.

Overall this is a solid workout for your legs.  I have a feeling that the reason a lot of people have noted not feeling sore the next day is because of how thoroughly Leah stretches you out at the end.  I would recommend this entire series and don't find Leah to be annoying in the least despite the voiceover and relatively bare studio.  I prefer the one-on-one format to those where numerous exercisers are in the background so these DVDs fit the bill.",1402444800,3,1831,4.35693215339233

5015291,5,B006S314SA,"I'm on a ballet/barre kick these days. My usual workout routines were heavy weight training and intense cardio. I've done multiple rounds of Beachbody's P90X, X2 and X3 routines, as well as Cathe's STS series. I'm also a big fan of Beachbody's Insanity and Asylum workouts.

In an effort to completely mix things up, I'm doing ballet and barre. Talk about a humbling experience!

Why I love this Lower Body workout:

* The moves are very much ballet inspired and a bit different from the typical barre routine. I know pretzel and thigh dancing are effective exercises, but it seems every barre workout includes these. It's nice to have some new moves to try.

* It burns! So I thought I was in pretty good shape and that my legs were strong. Well, maybe strong for doing squats, but try a tendu leg lift and that's another story.

* The one on one workout with Leah. It's just Leah doing the exercises with her voice over giving the instructions. I felt as though I was having a private lesson with her.

*The minimal equipment needed. All you need is a mat and a chair.

There are a few things to note about this workout. They didn't bother me since I loved this routine so much. They are:

* The set is a very plain ballet studio. It reminded me of a ballet room at the local YMCA. That was okay with me since it meant there were no distractions.

* It's just Leah in the workout, no background exercisers. Background exercisers can be helpful for showing modifications and providing some distractions from the `pain' of the workout.

* Even though the workout is intense, Leah is somewhat low key. I wouldn't pull out this workout on a day that I was tired or low on energy. On those days I need a livelier instructor like Tanya Becker of Physique 57.

If you are looking for some new ballet exercises to really work your lower body, this may just be the workout for you!",1393459200,,1874,4.434402332361516
5015292,5,B006S314SA,"I did Barre classes which I loved but they only had them 2 days a week and I wanted more so with a small investment (which will save me big time in the long run) I bought the bar and have been doing different videos. This one uses most of the moves I did in my class and way more!
I really like it, I have been doing this for almost a week and notice a difference!",1391644800,3,364,3.74025974025974
5015293,5,B006S314SA,"I have sought out low-impact workouts due to a hip injury that has pretty much barred me (punny) from high impact fitness. I have practiced callanetics, yoga and pilates for years and would consider myself a bit more than reasonably fit. I decided it was time for me to try ballet workouts.

This is a challenging workout and you can be a beginner or a more advanced exerciser and be able to find your place within this workout. Leah obviously has a very strong body, but she works out at the intermediate level on this workout. You are well aware that she can take her plies deeper than she does. She can take the sit backs deeper than she does. I appreciate this level of restraint in teaching  - its thoughtful. The intermediate advanced exerciser can see what she is doing and when she recommends that you ""could go deeper"", but then doesn't herself, allows you to be a better part of the process. Its sorta yoga-esque in that way. (Someone who can easily bend over their legs knows that there is always a deeper stretch to be reached.)

The most noteworthy thing about her lower body workout is the stretch afterwards. I am absolutely positive that at least one of her exercises for thighs or glutes will get your legs shaking. I don't care who you are or how much barre work you have done. These exercises will reach you somewhere - quads, hamstrings,glutes (maximus and minimus),& hip flexors. Yet, even after some pretty hard work, I have found that because of her 10 minutes of stretching - I am not sore the next day. The following morning, my muscles were very tired, but not sore. It seems that a good deal of exercisers do not seem to recognize the difference between muscle exhaustion and muscle strain. I think the point is - is that you want to work to exhaustion, to that tired very heavy feeling, rather than strain - that I cannot make it up or down the stairs without grimacing feeling. This lower body workout, IMHO, successfully, and humbly walks that fine line. It is incredibly thoughtful in that regard. As you conquer that exhausted feeling, you are ready to ""go deeper in your plie"".",1391126400,14,2110,4.562005277044855
5015294,5,B006S314SA,"Wow!

I'm an intermediate level exerciser and this completely surprised me! I'm used to using weights so I thought it would be easy with just my body weight but I was wrong! I'm rarely sore after a workout and after doing the Core, Lower Body, and Upper Body I felt muscles in my abdomen, legs, and shoulders I didn't even know that I had.

Pros:
-excellent price
-soothing voice, good cueing
-very different from typical workouts, a great addition to a workout DVD collection
-40 minute workout with around 10 minutes of stretching

Cons:
-strange background music
-would not use for weight loss (your heart rate doesn't get very high) but for toning instead
-few modifiers

At first while you are learning Leah's training style and the exercises themsleves, you may feel it in the knees, compensating for underutilized muscles. Also she doesn't talk much about technique. Another review states that this was the case. There is not much of a warm-up here, and unlike Bar Method, P57, Pure Barre, etc., the stretches do not occur until the very end of the work out. The seat work is sprinkled in. This is mainly thigh-focused which is what I am trying to target. Many reviewers on Amazon have mentoned that they have seen amazing results with this method.

5015299,5,B006S314SA,"Full disclaimer... this is my new favorite workout series. She had me at Core. This workout is HARD. You will need a bar or some kind of sturdy support (a chair/back of a couch might work) to do this one or it would be a solid 5 stars. Who has a bar?? Luckily I had a piece of furniture that worked. IF you have a bar (or its equivalent) this is one of the best lower body workouts on the market. My legs got hit in ways I never imagined possible. Traci Anderson says she is working the small overlooked supporting muscles. Leah actually does work them all and does it in a systematic way that does not irritate my lower back. My back is a quirky mess. The only time I was reminded was with the last set at the end that involved bridge work.  My legs were shaking by the end of this workout.

After every Leah workout I feel like I have a mesh of sore muscles encompassing her target area. This is no exception. This is a tough, comprehensive lower body workout.",1387929600,12,962,4.166666666666667

5015302,5,B006S314SA,"Legs have always been my problem area. Overall I'm probably on the 75% of the normal range of weight for my height.  So weightloss isn't important to me as somehow slimming my legs down is.  I find that while my stomach and upper body look fabulous, my legs and hip area continue to grow wider and wider.

I started jogging for about 4 months, 5 miles per day the last mile up a steep hill.  I noticed my legs firmed up, but my pants were harder to put on because I had 'bulked up'.  Trust me, I did not believe the 'bulking up' talk that most talked about until it happened to me. Running also made me eat like crazy--like breakfast, 2 lunches, 2 snacks and dinner.  After 4 months I had a really bad groin injury and running was impossible.

I discovered Leah's videos after 2 months of rest and after my legs were starting to re-jiggle and get fattier.  I never believed in the ability to tone specific areas, but her video actually did that.  Not only were my legs toned, but her exercises targets certain muscles that when firmer, make you appear slimmer.  I don't know how else to explain it.  It only took me 2.5 months to get the results! And, my pants fit better than they ever have!  Another benefit is since there is very low cardio, I don't eat as much as I did with running.  I was about to give up on toning my legs and thinking they'd be fat the rest of my life.  But now, my legs look much better than my stomach..

5015337,4,B006S314SA,"This is a pretty challenging set of lower body exercises! Executed good with great form! Love the instructions, nothing annoying like repeating same words over and over or silly comparison:)
This also not a beginner barre workout so be ready.
The  Only thing not sure if I'm crazy about the model not interacting with the camera and not a lot of modifications given..
But other than that there is a great verity of awesome burning:)",1351641600,,432,4.76
5015338,3,B006S314SA,"This workout was okay.  I prefer my other dvds, like physique 57 and Tracy Anderson.  I really wanted to love this dvd b/c of all of the great reviews.  I didn't feel any intense burning except for towards the end with the hamstring moves on the floor. I thought those exercises were great!  I thought there were way too many tucking moves though, which I got bored with quickly.  I did this workout last night and I am not sore at all or anything.  I'm a little disappointed.  Perhaps if I didn't have any other barre/ballet workout dvds, I would have enjoyed it more.

Also there were times when she said I should feel it in the glute area but I could barely feel anything in the glutes.  I wasn't sure if I was doing some of the moves correctly.  I didn't think she explained some of the barre work very well.  However, I could have been doing the moves correctly, but they were not challenging enough for me.  I'm just not sure.  I can always feel the burn with all of my other barre workouts, and I have a lot of them by different instructors.",1350432000,8,1048,4.285714285714286

5015341,4,B006S314SA,"This is a good barre-style workout.  She has some innovative moves, it is a good option.

My critiques are that I would prefer an all-over workout like you get with a Tracey Mallet or Physique 57 DVD.  It looks like you have to buy all 3 DVDs to get that.

Also, the reason that I work out with DVDs at home is that I want someone to workout with.  The voice over is very matter-of-fact announcing the instruction. The exerciser is like an automaton performing what the invisible voice is telling her to do.  She has no expression at all.  She doesn't show that the workout is any effort.  I appreciate some empathy from my DVD workout ""partner"".  The lack of emotion makes this just a decent work out, no fun at all.  If you're all business, this one is for you.",1340841600,9,763,4.309859154929577

5015343,5,B006S314SA,"I have tons of fitness, yoga and pilates DVDs but this one is one of my favourites. I'm so used to find the same exercises from one DVD to another, but this workout is so different it's refreshing. There's a  lot of exercises I'd never seen before. Every part of your lower body is engaged. I like that the exercises are simple and yet very effective. Even small movements are efficient, you can feel your thighs burning in no time!
I like how every time I feel I can't hold it anymore, the exercise changes and focuses on a different part of the thigh so I never collapse and I don't have to take a break.
Even the stretching part is good, long enough and efficient.

I did the exercises twice a week and after only two weeks, I swear I could already see the reults: my thighs were thinner, especially the area above the knee, and it's always been a delicate spot for me since I have a tendency to bulk up when I workout too much.

By way of example, I would say I prefer this DVD to ""Ballet Beautiful"" (though it's a nice DVD to complement this one) which is more tedious because of the endless sets of movements and the too quick stretching moves.

A must buy.",1336780800,8,1163,4.248868778280543

If you have no time or don't want to pay for any of those Ballet-inspired fitness class like me, this is your answer.  Some moves are hard to follow but I hope over time, it will come easier.
If you are considering buying it, just go for it.  You won't be disappointed.

I've been doing bar workouts for a couple months now (3-5 times a week) and have been loving them.  I bought Leah's videos to mix things up a bit.  This video just about killed me...but in a good way, if that's possible ;).  I don't believe it's for the faint of heart--you better want to work your butt of when you pop this baby into the DVD.  I had to pull out of position many times just to give my thighs a break for a sec, and while I find that a bit annoying right now, I look forward to pushing myself further each time until eventually I can get through the whole darn thing.  Leah definitely knows her stuff, and I look forward to trying her upper body and core workouts.",1335657600,7,759,4.094594594594595

I do some form of bar every single day, so I'm about as familiar with it as one can be without taking classes outside the home.  I had never heard of this Ballet Body series so I was really excited to receive it in the mail.  It was fun to do and was easy enough to follow, but I never felt that intense burn in my legs like I do with some other dvds, namely the physique 57 and bar method dancer's body.  Also, later in the day I noticed my knees sort of ached, which is very unusual for me.  I'll definitely give the video another chance, but if it yields the same results the dvd probably won't make it into my rotation.",1330646400,35,728,4.020833333333333

8503719,4,B006S314SA,"In this DVD Leah offers a great leg routine. As in her other series DVDs, reps and sets are never numbing and variations allow you work several group muscles. As I wrote in other Leah's DVDs reviews, I do not follow her periodization. I work out 14-16h a week on ballet / barre / toning DVDs, but I do like to keep some of her DVDs in my weekly rotations: one is upper body, the second one is lower body (I don't have Total Body and I find Core very mild).
Within my current rotations are: MHB's, Sleek Technique's and Leah's.

In this DVD, some sets of exercises, like those on front thighs, do give my legs a shake and these are just on muscular groups I don't usually work with such an intensity apparently, so perfect deal!
On the other hand, I don't find the workout intense enough on outer and inner thighs, reason why I am happy to use this DVD as a complement to my usual lower body routine. I would have probably made it a bit longer to pincorporate these muscle groups in a more intensive way. Arabesques don't come out of the blue...though I guess this is not the key objective of every customer :)
The stretch could be done in between series, but she prefers putting it at the end of the routine. It'ok, not super complete, but good.
On a total personal note, I am not a fan of her music style and scene colours. I find her voice very pleasant, but the execution very 'robotic'. I don't take stars off for this as this is a personal remark and takes no points off the efficient workout proposed by Leah.

Enjoy it!",1482105600,,1526,4.27681660899654
