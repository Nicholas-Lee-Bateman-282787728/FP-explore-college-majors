4172276,2,B003R0MEPE,"So I just got this DVD yesterday when it came out. I was looking forward to watching it. I got it home and started watching it. The episodes have a very high quality picture, so it seemed like a good DVD so far. Then I watched a little more, and I noticed something. The first episode appeared to be the syndicated version. As it turns out, all of them are like that. They all have scenes missing, and are the exact same versions you can find on TV. The ABC Family versions had more scenes from the original episodes. Though one thing these episodes have that wasn't on ABC Family  is the ending credit scenes, but you can still see those on TV on other networks. Why would you buy a DVD of episodes that have just as many scenes missing as the versions on TV? Well, if you are a huge fan of the show, and want to see better picture quality of the episodes, then you may consider making the purchase. If not, then don't get this DVD. Buy the first three seasons, though, those are all mostly uncut episodes. I doubt it will happen, but I hope they re-release it with the missing scenes intact sometime.

Update: They have re-released the DVDs with the missing scenes all intact! All episodes except for Number 1 with a Bullet are now completely uncut. Make sure to buy the correct DVD when purchasing this one, UPC code for new one is 8 83929 41379 9. The DVD is fine except for the one episode, though season 4 was never one of my favourites, though.",1391558400,21,1451,4.291970802919708
4172277,5,B003R0MEPE,"this was what we did when tgif was around.lol this full house, dinosaures, step by step...and some other show. i am counting down the days to relive this show all over again. loved it then love it now. life was good. not too many funny loving blk shows around anymore..so this must go in the collection.",1389744000,,303,4.428571428571429
4172278,5,B003R0MEPE,"I've always loved ""Family Matters"".It was a show that I used to watch all the time when I was a kid. I have so many great memories from all of these classic episodes. What made ""Family Matters"" so great was,it had a good moral message to it,and at the same time,was very funny too. The characters were also so likeable,and you could relate to each of them in some way or another. I wish they would do a reunion show with all of the cast members...or better yet,bring it back to TV.I would rather have ""Family Matters"" back on television again,compared to all of this garbage that is on nowadays. Overall,a great classic family show that every family should have in their collection.",1389571200,2,682,4.5528455284552845
4172279,5,B003R0MEPE,"I loved watching this show with my Grams as a kid and now I can rewatch it in its unedited form. I found this season sad since it was the last one to have Judy and Rachael as part of the series, I mean they could have dropped Judy to recurring or gave her a chance to shine like eddie and Laura since she had potential but it got wasted.",1388707200,,337,3.8285714285714287
4172280,5,B003R0MEPE,"I absolutely love this show! I used to watch this series as a kid on Tv and I really missed it. I was so excited that they released it on dvd. The only thing that bothers me is that we have to wait so long for each season. I don't understand the year wait. They need to hurry up and release the 4th season. I already own the other 3. It seems like they are hesistating to release a lot of the older black tv shows. I have been waiting on the rest of the Sister Sister dvds to come out as well. I hate that they did not release the rest of the ""Different World "" Dvds due to sales. If you love good tv. This is one show you should definetly watch. The third season is great!",1375488000,22,673,3.8489208633093526
4172281,5,B003R0MEPE,"I have the first three seasons and I like them alot but please hurry and release the other seasons there are some pretty good and funny episodes that I love. What I really want is Season 5 because it has the two episodes: ""Dr. Urkel and Mr. Cool"" and ""Stefan Returns"", where Steve Urkel turns into Stefan Urquelle those episodes are pretty funny.",1369180800,35,346,4.507936507936508
4172282,5,B003R0MEPE,Release Family Matters soon.  I would buy them and I am sure others would as well. I don't know why they take over 10 years to release some seasons.  They would make money either way so what do they have to lose.  Release them please.  I am tired of waiting for them to be released.,1369094400,43,282,4.072727272727272
4172283,5,B003R0MEPE,"I must say at first I wasn't that impressed with this show. The first season to me was the weakest. Then when the second season hit store shelves on February 14th of 2012 (a year and EIGHT months later) a friend of mine bought it and I watched his. I got to thinking ""Well, well, well. A little bit of an improvement here"". So I went ahead and bought seasons 1 & 2 (wouldn't make since to skip the first season all together). Then a WHOLE year past and that's when the third season finally came out. I bought mine, took it home, popped it in and laughed till I cried. Great season. Urkel really started cracking me up in that one. Now I am noticing something really odd about the release dates for these seasons. Think about the newer TV show's that's still in production today like ""Two and a half men"", ""The Big bang theory"", Criminal Minds"", etc. Other than the time frame from the first to the second season which was ridiculously long, i'm noticing that the time frame between season releases are the same time frame as the other aforementioned shows listed above. This is a 90's show. It has great family values. Values that's too hard to find now days and that's a sad fact. And with a character like Urkel running around you can't help but laugh on top of true emotional moments. This show is the definition of ""Life values"". For those of you who are true fans and I know ya'll are out there please, if you can, please help Warner Bros. squeeze out the rest of the seasons starting with the fourth season of course. And sooner than a year. I'm already up to MY neck in ""cancelled"" TV shows on DVD. Don't let this be one of them.",1363651200,53,1636,4.314935064935065

4172306,5,B003R0MEPE,"I miss Judy Winslow. It's a shame that they had to remove her from the rest of the show
Why would they use a family member character if they weren't going to use her again.

4172308,4,B003R0MEPE,Great comedy but picture quality could be better. When the characters move there is a blur sometimes and there is a haze. The box says widescreen but you have to set your TV to full screen to get the right picture!,1466985600,,214,4.2439024390243905

4172310,5,B003R0MEPE,"I love it! But since there are two different copies based on the upc code and running time it gets very confusing. The original copy with the edited episodes has the upc code: 883929373949 and the running time: 524 minutes. The rerelease copy with uncut episodes has the upc code: 883929413799 and the running time: 550 minutes.

4172338,5,B003R0MEPE,"I belong to a generation who because of when we grew up got to watch Family Matters when it originally aired on ABCs TGIF lineup (later CBS) and in syndication on TBS among other networks. To me, Family Matters will always harken back to a time when my biggest responsibility was being a kid. Part of me wonders how I can possibly be objective under such a strong nostalgic pull but here it goes

With the fourth season, Urkel starts to encroach upon things further and the characters of Judy and Rachel are relegated to the background. Yet as I say this, many of these episodes were the core of my Family Matters viewing experience such as Carl and Steve on American Gladiators, Carl and Steve in the same hospital room, and Harriet refusing to clean the house among others. So yes, the family piece begins to take a bit of a backseat, but they hadnt veered off into the extremes of the later seasons.

A good season that avoided the silliness of later years.",1459036800,,960,4.48

4172504,3,B003R0MEPE,Season 4 is a good season especially if you are a Family Matters Fan. But I did not like Season 4 as much as I did the rest of the seasons. Season 4 to me seemed to be a sad season where Laura seemed to have a lot of epiphanies that compels her to put herself in Steve's shoes. Although that is not a bad thing the comedy becomes more of a drama rather than staying true to simply just comedy. I have to be honest I did not finish the season out. I stopped at the 3rd disc. But for the most part the seasons of family matters are really good. And I would still buy all of them and keep them as a collection. But I wish family matters stayed on one side and stopped crossing fences. It always seems to be a switch between seasons whether they focus more on drama or comedy. I personally do not like the two to mix. I understand there will be times and important shows where the two will have to meet but consistency is important to me. But overall Season 4 is good and all time favorite television show of mine. So no matter what I will buy again.,1419206400,,1046,4.009569377990431

4172607,4,B003R0MEPE,"Season 4 of Family Matters is definitely worth getting although there are some gripes. For one, I think the transfer could've been a lot better as in my opinion it looks inferior to the last 3 seasons. The frame rate looks kind of sluggish at times. And also, the back of the box set says that the season is presented in the matted Widescreen format. I would've loved that... if it were TRUE. It is in the exact same 1:33:1 standard aspect ratio as before. On the positive side, WB has put back the 2.0 stereo track (removing it from the season 3 release was a huge mistake). It's a great season nonetheless and is my second-favorite of the four released (I rank them as 2,4,3 and 1). And thanks to some helpful reviews, I now know that season 4 has been re-released with the UPC of 8 83929 41379 9 (check the barcode on the back). I think some of, if not all the episodes are uncut now. So that's good news.",1409616000,,908,4.254335260115607

4172615,5,B003R0MEPE,I love this show. I'm 33 now and I can remember watching this every Friday evening as part of the TGIF line of shows in the 1990's when I was a kid. I remember being glued to the TV for 3 hours straight (2 hours of TGIF and 1 hour of 20/20) from 8 to 11:00 on Friday nights. They just don't make shows like this anymore. All the stuff on nowadays is trash. I hope they come out with the rest of the seasons. This was before TV went down the toilet.,1406505600,4,448,3.827956989247312
4172616,4,B003R0MEPE,"I started to type a review on this 4th season of Family Matters on 7/21/2014, and today is 10/1/2016.

Family Matters is my all-time favorite show, and this is the 4th season that I have on the DVD set. I also have the first three seasons, and seasons 5-8 of Family Matters on the DVD sets. There is also a 9th season of Family Matters, which is really the last season, but I don't like that season for a simple reason, so I wouldn't buy or watch the 9th season. Seasons 1-8 of Family Matters is good enough for me to watch anyway, including this fourth season.

It's also noticeable that this show Family Matters even came out with seven Christmas episodes from the 2nd season, from this 4th season, and from seasons 5-9. The 2nd season of Family Matters has the first Christmas episode ""Have Yourself a Very Winslow Christmas"", and this 4th season has the second Christmas episode ""It's Beginning To Look A lot Like Urkel"". And their both good Christmas episodes, and so are the Christmas episodes from seasons 5-9. I do like the Christmas episodes, and they do bring back good memories of the whole family celebrating Christmas in the show. But the Christmas episode from the 9th season is what I would do without watching, because again I don't like the 9th season of Family Matters, and I wouldn't buy or watch it for a simple reason. And I've seen the Christmas episode from the 9th season before anyway. So the Christmas episodes from the 2nd season, from this 4th season, and from seasons 5-8 of Family Matters is what I'll just stick with watching. And like I said, seasons 1-8 of Family Matters is good enough for me to watch, including this fourth season.

 Other than that, I do like all the regular episodes from this 4th season, because they also bring back good memories with Jaleel White and the Winslow family. And not only do I like Jaleel White in the show, but also like all the other main characters.

From this 4th season of Family Matters, I have to say that one of my favorite regular episodes is ""Hot Wheels"", an episode where Darius McCrary as (Eddie) gets an old beat up police car and remodels it brand new with a good working condition. I thought that was a good episode when I first saw it.

And another one of my favorite episodes from this 4th season is ""Stormy Weather"", an episode where there's a junior prom, and everybody gets soaked and wet. And the last scene from that episode is also my favorite scene with a happy ending, and it shows Steve and Laura caring about each other. That's also an episode I would never want to forget.

Jaimee Foxworth was one of the main characters in Family Matters, who played the younger daughter as (Judy) from the first season, and the last episode with her from this fourth season is ""Mamma's Wedding"". After that episode, she was never seen again in the show or was never mentioned in anymore episodes from this fourth season or from seasons 5-9 for some reason. So knowing that about Jaimee Foxworth, she will always be known and remembered as (Judy) in Family Matters, playing the younger daughter from the first three seasons and from this fourth season, and it's good to know that they did not bother to replace her by any other character. And even though Jaimee Foxworth was no longer seen again in the show after this fourth season, Family Matters is still a good show to watch. But the first eight seasons is what I just like to watch, including this fourth season. The 9th season of Family Matters is the very last season I don't like to watch for a simple reason, so I had to say that I just like the first eight seasons to watch, including this fourth season, being that I said that Family Matters is still a good show to watch.",1405900800,,3714,4.493333333333333

4172743,1,B003R0MEPE,"First off, I'm rating this one star for the edited versions. I don't understand why one has to rate an item before they review it. Now to the point of my review - the limited, replacement discs. What I also don't understand is why the studio is releasing these unedited episodes, the ones we customers asked for, for only a limited time. Limited is the key word here. We should not, and I repeat, should not have to suffer for a mistake that Warner Bros. studios made, which is exactly what seems to be the case. I'm not saying we actually are suffering, but it certainly feels like it, It's not the consumer's fault Warner Bros. didn't provide the uncut episodes the first time around. Now I'm sure the studio probably has a very good reason for this (and I hope they do), but I still feel that I need to write this. While it's good that they're also providing them for the online consumers, why can't they also have these new discs in the packaging (for online purchase as well)  for the people who didn't by the set the first time around? This seems to be another sign that we're suffering for their mistake. Let's just hope they don't make this mistake again in the future.",1397088000,4,1177,4.423963133640553

WHY WOULD THIS MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR COMPANY DO SUCH A THING?

ANYWAYS, BECAUSE OF THE OUTSTANDING CHARACTERS ON THIS FAMILY COMEDY SITCOM, I HAD TO RATE THIS DVD

AT FIVE STARS.

ALSO, THE MORAL OF THE STORIES OF FAMILY MATTERS ARE UNLIKE TODAY'S COMEDY SITCOMS OF NO REAL VALUE.

FAMILY MATTERS, IS RATED FOR A  FAMILY OF GOOD MORAL STANDARDS.

IT'S FUNNY, HEART WARMING AND EVERYTHING THAT LIFE SHOULD BE.

ERKEL'S TALENTED PERFORMANCES ENTERTAINS ME THROUGH OUT EVERY EPISODE,

AND KEEPS ME LAUGHING MY BRAINS OUT!!

Key Summaries about this 4th Season:
- This season did have Judy in a few episodes and mentions of her as well.
- Eddie and Steve get their own rides. Also learned the ""clown car"" Steve has is a BMW!
- A few episodes where they are on the roof which were some of my favorites!
- Introduction of Myra! (Forgot she was Ted's cousin)
- Waldo at his BEST
- Classic ""Did I Do That's""

When all of the original broadcast episodes from this season are available then I will give this DVD set 5 stars.

Hey Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, When will Family Matters: The Complete Seasons 5-9 be available? I want the complete series of Family Matters, All of the original broadcast episodes.

Hopefully, new collections are available, now... without the hassle I went through{Warner Bros
