Some Thoughts About The Movie (NOT a base for my rating):
THE BEYOND stands beyond many Italian trash and horror movies. FULCIs influence on the production made it a special kind of its own. The visual style seems directly be taken out of a ghost-story comic-art book. This comparison comes in mind due to the tradition comic art-books have in Italy. For example, MICHELE SOAVIS wonderfully crafted DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE (1994) is based on the Italian comic-book series DYLAN DOG. Have a closer look on the MARIO BAVAs works. You can make out this reference in nearly all of his movies, first of all his obvious comic-book referenced DIABOLIC! (1968). Many declare THE BEYOND as FULCIS masterpiece. I think he made some other movies having more depths in storytelling like DONT TORTURE A DUCKLING (1972) or FOUR OF THE APOCALYPSE (1975) but he never achieved a movie to be more atmospheric and intense than THE BEYOND. Decoration, set-design, special effects, choice of actors, camera work, (editing I have to set in brackets), color- and light-compositions create sheer eye candy on screens. This movie was made by a talented crew who pulled the maximum out of the given (small) budget. Do not search for logic. Do not search for epic dialogue or depths in story and you may enjoy THE BEYOND due to its beautiful visuals, tense atmospheric elements and because it is referenced spiritually to POE and LOVECRAFT. I cannot label THE BEYOND a typical zombie flick, at core it is more a haunted house ghost-story featuring some (very well designed) zombies. Although FULCI relies on the impact heavily explicit gory effects have, THE BEYOND is spooky and frightening too. The mixture of atmosphere, creepy elements and gory effects is well balanced. Although it misses logic and it seems silly and unintended funny at times, the movie never really becomes antic. Strange but true, FULCI created a convincing and believable movie, regarding within its own boundaries  similar to the story-universe H.P. Lovecraft has created. The cleverly established surrealistic elements are one of the main reasons why THE BEYOND works so well although the story indeed is hair-raising. Last but not least, the musical score by NAME is awesome. It adds so much tension and underlines the atmosphere. I know this movie since the 80th. As a child I stubbed my nose at the BEYOND poster artwork at the local cinema, which I came across on my way to school. A little later I watched it for the first time, the rest is history. For me THE BEYOND is one of them movies which never loses weight through all those years. Now, regarding with a certain distance and being rationally I am going so far to call THE BEYOND a well crafted unique visionary piece of art of modern horror cinema. This is the one FULCI movie you have to see under any circumstances.

No Grain Baby, No Gain / The Transfer/ The Comparison GRINDHOUSE vs. ARROW:
The 2K transfer from original vault elements for this BD set unfortunately is nothing else than mediocre. I am afraid to say it, but after waiting all the time since ARROW released their BD-Set in 2011, this is not a definite new transfer which outperforms all earlier releases. It even seems like the same base-scan was used for this re-mastering (the sharp edges in both releases are exactly identical) but of course I could be easily wrong with this assumption.

The details:
The biggest issue with the GRINDHOUSE version for me is the harsh balance between dark and bright values. The so called gamma is set far too hard. Even if you turn gamma down all the way in your system (if you are lucky enough to own such a function), the gamma-balance still remains too sharp(ARROW did a better job on that side). That results in a hard and not film-like color and tone-reproduction. The middle and upper spectrum is hitting hard, looking slightly false. A grain structure is left throughout the whole presentation but overall the master seems to be heavily DNR-treated. THE ARROW BD has a more film-like grain structure in general. Many scenes have no texture and grip to it and faces often tend to be waxy. Do not compare the heavy grainy car on the bridge-segment. That scene was shot completely different than the rest of the movie and by nature it offers a lot more grain. There you can really see the filter in action. Due to the consequential loss of details overall the picture has been sharpened and one clearly can make out edge enhancement allover and especially during the little red-haired girl (No it is not a scene from THE PEANUTS) waiting in hospital floor-segment  to mention at least one extreme example.

We Interrupt Our Program For an Important Message:
Peopleyou cannot bring back photographic details by sharpening. The quality of every frame of any film-negative is also hidden in the grain itself. Grain is a part of each developed single picture frame (depending on development process and choice of film material and amount of light), film-grain is not a disturbing flaw, it is an essential element for an organic non-digital looking result. We could also say each single photographic picture is set together by nothing more than billions of dots, created through a chemical process including the factor light. Every single dot (similar to the digital photography nowadays) contains quality details like the amount of contrast-, color, brightness and whatnot more information. The final picture can be imagined as a puzzle, put together by those dots. Using filters, those qualities will be manipulated, bent, reduced and worst of all irreparably destroyed. What is gone will be gone forever. No filter, no matter how good it works will change that or even make things better. That is impossible. What a big and commonly established error in reasoning, thinking a sharp picture automatically would be a high-quality picture. The big winner on that side is the level of detail (remember the dots). Maybe you already guessed it. Grain is an essential part of the level of detail. Filter grain out and you mess up all the above mentioned factors - slice for slice! PLEASE STOP THIS BULLSHIT and throw your DNR overboard. Certain directors have spoken out loud that demand years agopartially unheard by the industry. It has become way better in the last few years, but there still lies a long and winding road before them.

This is The End of The Middle of The Movie, now we continue our Program:
The ARROW BD shows the exact same problem here (edge enhancement). Maybe the lack of grip, texture and detail in general is given because they scanned a low contrast interpositive or even a dupe-negative. I am not sure about this. But for sure the inorganic looking and destructive working sharpening-filter has been applied manually by a human being. In addition there are some details missing in darker scenes but that is not really a distracting fact. The overall situation in blacks is still good. The colors seem to be boosted strongly, especially on faces and greens you can recognize this. I have the feeling this appears even more on the ARROW disc. Beside those facts I could not spot block noise, odd grain behavior (when it appears on screen) or other digital encoding atrocities. I have to mention that the ARROW print shows a very annoying bright line directly under the upper 2.35 : 1 black matting-bar. THE ARROW transfer is much more colored which supports the comic-art-book style of the movie and the GRINDHOUSE transfer was done with more focus on earthy tones which supports the grim content of the movie more. Like always, the choice is yours. ARROW also tinted the beginning sequence sepia but it looks quite different in comparison to the GRINDHOUSE opening. Despite the extreme color boosting of the ARROW version they UK mates made the more film-like and less harsh looking version. Both versions are not able to offer state of the art transfers and mastering-results.

Cut and Run:
This is a version intgrale. No inserts from low quality source-elements or SD materials have been applied.

THE BEYOND is presented completely uncut.

Sound-Restoration:
The great soundtrack acts as an important enforcer for the films atmosphere. It sounds as special as the movie looks. The roots basically can be found in jazz and the composer wrote it fitting the pictures mood perfectly.
The 5.1 Soundtrack unfortunately does not pay full tribute to the music qualities. It is re-mastered and mixed way too thin and clean sounding. Kind of narrow, being pushed exactly in center pan-position, what results in certain segments sounding like not being an organic part of the movie at all. Regarding the foley-sounds, for example the thunder at the beginning, they completely have gone mad piloting the sub-bass frequencies. I do not like the sound of this 5.1 soundtrack at all. What they did to the picture using too much filtering, finds its equivalent in the sound re-mastering.
I stuck with the 2-way stereo track which I find much more homogeneous, while not being perfect either.
I did not listen to the whole original mono-soundtrack but I think it will be purists first choice. Since my childhood days I am a total music freak and I do operate a little sound-studio for myself and therefore I am extremely critical, concerning sound-design, mixing and mastering.

Final Thoughts:
Fans and collectors in general may spend their money for this BD Set without remorse. Because GRINDHOUSE released a great collectors item regarding supplement materials which includes a booklet, a Soundtrack CD and a second BD with tons of extras. The Package is wrapped by a thin carton imprinted with a reproduction of the legendary cool designed poster in green, yellow and red colors. It is the same artwork ANCHOR BAY used years ago on their beautiful limited Tin-Box-DVD Set which still sits on my shelf. Well done GRINDHOUSE.
People with big screen-home-cinema-systems or HD-projectors and videophile film-gourmets will have to live with the many obvious flaws regarding the visual quality of this transfer (and the sound-mixing decisions). Do not panic. As always, the biggest cows on the meadow will be milked and milked again and there will for sure be a glorious 4K transfer out there one day. Because we got the cash-cow situation in film business, I assume at first someone will throw a further new 2K transfer on the market in the future. Anyhow, stay tunedit will be exiting. For now I finally have to state that there still does not exist a definite digital film-transfer of THE BEYOND on the whole wide world.

How I rate / What I rate:
My ratings refer exclusively to technical aspects of BD sets. The more film-like a HD transfer looks and feels via a projection, the more high-class the source is scanned and digitally treated afterwards, the higher my ratings will be. Digital phenomena like edge enhancement, block noise, digital appealing grain, swarming grain / noise behavior and DNR filtering will directly result in lower ratings.
I do not rate movies at all. In the introduction part I just offer my opinion, based on taste, preferences and knowledge about film/photography in general. Movies are artificial constructions where many efforts have been taken (including complex postproduction) to accomplish a vision of whatsoever kind. No movie made for cinema ever shot has earned a 1 star rating on AMAZON or a 1 point rating on IMDB. I have studied many publications about making films, their psychological impact, and the subject violence on film. I am a hobby photographer knowing much about frame compositions, color and light effects and different styles. I am also a hobby musician and sound designer for my own private joy. I could rate a movie/ its soundtrack, but why should I? Things are what they are and nothing more or less. I like to think beyond mind constructed terms of good and bad. So called ""objectivity"" becomes fast diluted by preferences which results in comments of personal taste. These comments are fine but they go without any base value for creating a rating-scale out of them. Technical aspects are a different kind of matter. DNR, edge enhancement, block noise and such things are obvious even on small screens and maybe we can speak more of objectivity and measurability in this area. I think we should be informed about the quality of a product.

All about Ev(m)e:
I am a collector of films for 27 Years, own about 3.000 films (would be far more, but I often sort out transfers I do not like) and watch them in a home-cinema room via big screen projection. I am also a hobby musician and photographer with some experience scanning camera negatives in high definitions.

This is a shockingly amateurish, nonsensical, plodding bore of a movie with no point to make. It feels like a collection of disconnected scenes written by a five-year-old. Though I am sure that a kid could write better dialogue.

It begins promisingly with a 1927 prologue in sepia-tone, it has atmosphere and suspense. After that we cut to 1981 and everything falls apart. A woman inherits a hotel where BAD THINGS HAPPEN....OOOOOOHHHHH!!!!!

Utter, complete, disjointed, meaningless, total effing garbage. The people involved in making this movie had no talent or ability and it blows my mind that it is even remotely considered a cult film. It's not even entertaining accidentally. Even at a mere 87 minutes it feels long and empty. Many, many scenes could have been trimmed to half the length as there is frequently nothing happening. But they wouldn't have a marketable movie if it lasted for only 44 minutes so be prepared to sit through LOTS of pa-aa-ad-ding.

For a movie about a gateway to hell I guess I should give it some credit for making me feel like I had actually went to hell for an hour and a half.

1106566,5,6305972079,"Sometimes I wish I could show you guys how excited I get to do certain reviews. This is one of them.
Lucio Fulci. The Godfather of Gore.
In horror circles, you either love him or you don't know who the hell he is. For those that dont, it's okay. This is something you have to seek out. He does not show up on Netflix. Despite directing a number of movies, beginning in the late fifties, it wasn't until the early seventies with two giallos that we began to see the Fulci we would all come to love. In 1979, he was given the chance to direct the Italian sequel to George Romeros Dawn of the Dead (in Italy, it was released as Zombi, so Fulcis movie was Zombi 2 there, but today it is just called Zombie), and I can honestly say that I've never seen anyone create zombie art like Lucio Fulci. Over the course of the next six years, he did a handful of gore films, each one beautiful in its own way, and all to be reviewed here eventually. After 1985, he split from his screenwriter, and the next eleven years were filled with failed movies and declining health, until he passed away from complications from Diabetes on March 13th, 1996 at the age of 68. Now let's get to The Beyond!
The movie begins in Louisiana in 1927, at the Seven Doors Hotel, where a lynch mob accuses and murders an artist in room 36, because they believe him to be a warlock, and that he has placed a curse on the town. Despite his protest that the hotel was built over a gate to hell, and that only he can keep it closed, they beat him with chains, crucify him, and throw acid on his face. That's the first five minutes of the movie.
In 1981, Liza (Katherine McColl) has inherited the hotel, and plans to renovate and reopen it. Unfortunately for her, her actions open the portal, and lots of people die in very violent ways.
Plot was never Fulcis strong point, and sometimes it seems like things happen just to set up the death. Liza meets a blind woman named Emily(Cinzia Monreale) who warns her of the portal, but it really just feels like the conversation about the addition of her character went like this.
Fulci: Write in a blind woman.
Script writer: Why?
Fulci: So I can have her dog rip someone's throat out.
That's the feel of the entire movie. My plot synapses could actually go like this. Gates of hell. Stuff happens. Someone dies. More stuff. Someone else dies. A little bit more stuff. Another death. Zombies. The End.
But that's not a bad thing. You don't watch this movie for story. You watch it for the glorious amounts of gore that pours from every character,  every few minutes.
To understand how much gore we are talking, when the movie was first released on VHS, it was heavily censored and renamed to The Seven Doors of Death. We had a copy at the video store I worked at, and I was super excited when I brought it home with me one night. That excitement lasted about 20 minutes, and the rest of the movie was me completely bored. It's almost a different movie. Finally, in 2001, the first uncensored copy came to America, and I've owned at least one copy of it since then. While not for everyone, those of us with an appreciation for carnage will adore every blood soaked second of this film.
Scare Factor 6/10 It does have its creepy moments but it's usually just imagery. Everytime your mind thinks ""That's spooky"", it will follow with ""But I don't know what the hell it means, so I'll just wait for more death. The plot of the movie does have a very creepy premise. A woman takes over a inheritance,  only to find out its a portal to hell. See....that's scary.
Gore 10/10 This movie has all of the gore, and then still brings more.
Multiple Acid Baths: Check
Dog Attack Throat Rip: Check
Human Face Eating Spiders: Check
Multiple Zombies: Check
The special effect that Fulci excelled in was eye torture, and there are no less than three examples of this in the film.
Even with all of that, my favorite death from this, and one of my favorite deaths of all time shows what happens when you completely obliterate a human head with a very large handgun. I watch that scene at least three times, every single time I watch this.
Recommended 8/10 I know I've made it seem like this movie makes no sense, but that isn't really the case. It has a definite plot. It's just not one that you should worry about if something confuses you or doesn't make sense. It's best to keep watching, and not struggle too much to comprehend every little part. The only reason this isn't a 10/10 is that it is for the hardcore. While some of the effects look really fake (I'm looking at you, Human face eating spiders), Fulci was still a master of this art, so it's not for anyone with a weak stomach. That being said, anyone that can handle it, should see this immediately.",1458086400,,4749,4.389330306469921
1106567,5,6305972079,"I haven't seen anything like this kind of horror movie for a long time.
This is a really scary thing. It's not a slasher or bloody movie but rather a calm but little by little eat you up kind of movie.
The woman with no eyeballs is really scared and when main actors become one of them, that was really creepy.
Also when there were living dead appeared, it was not like one of those Geaorge Romero's. They were more, way more scary.
The story is rather simple.
The cellar of an old hotel is built on top of the door to the beyond. Bloody zombies roam there. A young woman who is heir of the hotel wants to restaurate it. She is confronted with strange events. A painter has a lethal fall, the plumber vanishes and her friend breaks his neck. When she escapes to the hospital of a friendly doctor she doesn't know what a nightmare is waiting there.
The special effects are top notch knowing that the budget was aroun 400,000$ it was magical.
All the actors are dead serious and they are really good.
The camera and lighing were all A+ and they looked like hollywood top class work.
I don't even know how this Italian director managed this movie to be made with such a low budget feature. Then again money doesn't matter to true artist at all. I saw many directors who were once great artists went to hollywood and with the great budget they became corrupted and end up with nobody. Sometimes being hungry makes them a great artists. This guy is one of them, I thought.
I found out later that he is a legend in horror film in Italy. I should find some of his other works.
Some people are complaining about the music but for me the cheap sound actually worked even more. They seems like perfectly matched with the almost fallen down cheap motel and background.
I bought this film in Korea paying only 2.5$ and felt almost sorry for it bacause it was so cheap. I think no one even knew how great this movie was.
It was 87 minutes uncut verson. Rated R. (18 and over of ages can watch).

The story itself involves an old hotel in New Orleans which just happens to also be one of the 7 doorways to Hell and once opened, very unfortunate events begin to unfold. As with most Italian horror movies made in the early 80's, this one has plenty of impressive gore effects as well as zombies lurking about.

1106678,1,6305972079,"Maybe I missed a pivotal moment, but I frankly don't know what all the online fuss is about regarding this film.  The special effects are dated, but admittedly probably better than normal for an 80s horror flick. Unfortunately, the effects are overdone to a level of unbelievable annoyance -- elongated scenes of ooze dripping from skulls, spider attacks, and shredded cadavers.  This makes the effects the sole object of note for a film that lacks substance of plot.  The central idea is sound and could have been developed in depth: an old hotel that is one of the Seven Gateways to Hell.  But, other than an old book, there is no good investigation of how the inn got there, why the site was chosen to be 1 of 7, and no interesting iconography to bind the audience to the story or the site of the story.  Instead, we have unremarkable people wistfully trudging around a hotel that is in a state of disrepair, mindlessly falling victim to the supposed damned.  The most horrid thing I found in this creature feature was the acting/overacting.  Better than most of what Hollywood produces today, but still not worth a serious look.",1444694400,,1132,4.686868686868687

1106680,5,6305972079,"I must say Grindhouse Releasing really went out of their way with this one.  I've never purchased any of their movies but this really makes me want to get more.  The print, sound, and extras are well worth it, but what really sold me was the packaging.  Not just the eyes of the red woman glow-in-the-dark but the eyes on the creatures in the background as well as the title both on the cover and all three spines as well.  Perhaps its my fault for not reading more about it in the product description, but I didn't know it also came with a cd of the movie's soundtrack.  The score is a masterpiece almost equal to Goblin's Suspiria.

The movie itself is pretty amazing.  I'm not going to ruin much for you if you haven't seen it but it pretty much has everything, witchcraft, zombies, a haunted house, chain whippings, eye gouging, flesh eating tarantulas, rabid dogs, and a portal to hell.  Its almost as though someone had a checklist of weird, creepy things you put in a horror movie and decided to check them all.  The commentary while not adding much is at least amusing.  It features the movie's two leads instead of Fulci and if that upsets you just remember even if Fulci were on the commentary his english was never very good.

I can't say I've watched all the extras on disc 2 but I can say the interview with Catriona MacColl is interesting.  Everything here is impressive and I love this movie but the thing I found most entertaining were the 30 plus minutes of trailers for Grindhouse releases.  I found myself laughing hysterically, not to mention curiously transfixed by titles such as:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-American-Hippie-In-Israel-Limited-Edition-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-3-Disc-Set/dp/B00DELTUEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An American Hippie In Israel (Limited Edition/Blu-ray/DVD Combo-3 Disc Set)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Massacre-Mafia-Style-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00R8O809O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Massacre Mafia Style Blu-ray + DVD Combo</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-With-The-Pope-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00TA9VS6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone With The Pope (Blu-ray + DVD Combo)</a>",1442534400,,2270,6.078369905956113

1106761,1,6305972079,"I was disappointed here.  Being used to, and enjoying, the American horror movies of Tobe Hooper, which are surprisingly less graphic, all the while delivering far more 'fright'.  With a reputation this movie, and Director, has, I was consequently displeased with the general lack of terror or awe.  Though true, there were some eerie moments, but the film as a whole was not at all very scary, or even interesting for that matter.  The film did not have a good premise, and though while never at all unintentionally 'silly', it barely held your attention, though I did watch it to the conclusion.  And the latter was at least somewhat poetic, in a Serlingesque manner .  So therefore in sum, if you are used to American horror, do be ready for a change here: and I don't particularly recommend it.",1440547200,,798,4.705035971223022
1106762,5,6305972079,"Ok. Here we go. ""And you will Live In Terror!'' in the late Lucio Fulci's gruesome and rotting masterpiece - Lldila (The Beyond). This film has it all that refers to the splatter horror theme, with all-too disgusting visuals, combined with masterful-milked photography by Sergio Salvati (Ghoulies II), great dramatic score conducted by Fabio Frizzi, and of course- stylish visuals by Fulci. Fulci brings out all in his heart-pounding horror set-pieces. 1. Possessed hotel with it's basement (Oh s*** Joe! Don't knock down the secret chamber! It's infested with rotting zombies eager to gouge out your eyes in a graphic mess). 2. If your arachnaphobic you won't want to stomach Giannetto de Rossi's infamous venomous tarantula scene. Ok, anyone can tell that some of these spiders are made with pipe-cleaner sticks, but even this makes it more off-putting in some way (The fake ones have a more ""vile"" tone). 3. Of course- Zombies. Even it's debatable to this day what the stumbling dead near the end in the hospital intended to do their victims (if they were quick or smart enough to catch them in the first place), my main conclusion is that the Zombies wanted to devour them, Dawn Of The Dead - style. I wish Fulci put had the authentic vision and put a Zombie flesh ripping, devouring scene in this film, if only just one at that. Hey- he served us this before with ""Zombi 2"" and sought of with ""City"", and that gave those films their own merit. Right?? 4. Loaded with pure suspense. One in about 5 lovers of Lldila will quote that they were s***less in this film. Espescially what the scenes contained resulting in the prologue about room 36, and the crucifiction in the basement. By the way readers - Even when Emily quotes that Sweik did die in Room 36, when he clearly didn't, the simple fact is that she just didn't know this. 5. The ending. Pure emotional, dynamite. You may even wan't to replay it to get that surreal, ""Buzz"". Had allot of censorship problem before the mid-late 90's, beware of cut and ""edited"" versions, but by now you probably don't have to be an idiot to know that. Cut to the chase, if horror is what your expecting with this film , you'll definitely get it. With style complete with great music, yes too. Just don't expect much with excessive plot and dialoque. Oh yes, I own the Arrow UK Blu-ray steelbook(s), and a couple of copies of these new beauties from grindhouse (which includes a Soundtrack CD!) Plus I have all kinds of post-dvd versions of this film. Thanks Lucio, you were extremely talented.

1106765,5,6305972079,"Lucio Fulci's Italian Splatter Horror fest means a great deal to me
Due to the fact it's the first Fulci Film i discovered late in my Collecting

I'm gonna share with you the day I came across the Beyond on DVD
It was late spring of 2001 had no car (Due to my little sister wrecking my only car) It wasn't exactly a great car but, it was mine  and I needed a wheels to go to and from my new job
I was able to get my Grandfather to let me take his pride and joy a 1977 Ford T-Bird to work while i looked for a new car
Found out about a CD Store 35 miles away That took used CD's in Trade for store credit or cash
Went through my massive collection of cd's found 150 cd's to take there for trade (CD's I know longer wanted/I needed to cut down on my cd Collection) Drove to this Store handed the sales man a massive box of CD's told him i'll take Store credit
I looked around this store was very cool (It was a typical late 90's Music Store) but, they also sold vinyl records, VHS Tapes , and the new Hot format DVD
I wanted to add more to my very small dvd Collection (Maybe had 6-8 dvd's) Keep in mind this was very early on Best Buy & Circuit City  still sold more VHS over the dvd Format
This store actually had a lot of dvd's for a small Music retail shop the problem was they were super over priced
While looking through what they had on dvd i seen a few things that Interest me, one being this super Cool Limited Edition Tin of The Beyond (with the coolest art work and a massive warning label on the front of the case (No one Under 17 Should view this Film) The downside to this Limited Tin it was marked at $39.99 so i just put it back and talked to the manager about my Store credit
I was lucky to get $125.00 Store Credit so I swallowed really hard and gave in and added The Limited Edition of The Beyond (Anchor Bay TIN) to the stack of stuff I took...... That DVD was a massive blind buy (There were no smart phones to check price matching, etc.)
Later on a day or two later I cracked up the TIN (I've bought a number of Special Edition Anchor Bay VHS Tapes) So i knew Anchor Bay at the time was a 5 Star Distributor they really put there heart and soul into this stuff back in the days of dvd's
This Film blew me away everything about it even on a SD tv you could pick up on the Beautiful Lighting,The  Production Values were insane everything is practical and Organic and it adds so much to the film over all
The Beyond IMO one the Best Italian Horror Films ever! It pulls no punches and doesn't pull back when most films would
The Ending is Anti Hollywood =Meaning it's more realistic Life is complicated Life is messy There is no real Disney Ending
After watching this Film the first time I became a die hard Luci Fulci Fan i tried to get all his Horror Work very quickly
I probably watched this dvd at least 5 times in a month 'Cause it was so fresh and unique and just Perfect even the negatives with this film you can turn to Positives......
I was so obsessed  at the time I over payed to get my hands on the Limited Edition version of Zombie on Laserdisc  (Needless to say I payed more for a outdated Laserdisc then for the New Format dvd) But, any Collector can relate to this
Collecting is very much a OCD thing some people will not admit that I on the other hand know what I am and admit it freely

Enough of this Palaver lets get the show on the road

I'm gonna try and  review and point out the Positives & Negatives surrounding the Blu Ray home video versions of
Lucio Fulci's The Beyond  (Note: I've had almost every version of the beyond put out on DVD) I've seen it with terrible edits  The Seven Doors of Death **On The Cheap** dvd) to HQ DVD's like the AnchorBay Version & The 2008 Grindhouse Releasing, Inc. Version

The Arrow Video (UK Release) The ""Original"" Arrow BR is region Free
This Version is flat out amazing it's a 2-Disc Set (One Disc Being a BR and the second disc being a dvd) Both disc are region free
Arrows Cut is a Brand New Uncut HD Restoration + 160mins of Special Features all there extras are exclusives to Arrow Video

AKA Sarah Keller: Cinzia Monreale remembers ""The Beyond""
Catriona MacColl  Q&A from Glasgow Film Theatre (very cool Catriona is one of the Scream Queens That really gets over looked in Horror)
Open Your Eyes Easter Egg

Disc Two (DVD) everything on this dvd is Exclusive to the Arrow Video BR
One Step Beyond Catriona MacColl Remembers a Spaghetti Splatter Classic (great interview) after watching this I became a bigger fan of Mrs MacColl 'Cause she's a Legit Actress that fell into the Horror Genre and seems to accept her past and embraces it and Respects the fans!
Beyond Italy- Louis Fuller and the seven doors of Death Interview with US distributor and editor of the beyond Terry Levene  (very interesting)
the Living Dead Legacy of special effects wizard Gianetto Di Rossi (This is a must see Gianetto Di Rossi is without a doubt super under rated he's in the same league as Tom Savini But, most people don't know his name) Which is a tragic shame
Fulci Flashbacks: Dario Argento, and others close to him remember the Godfather of Gore
Alternative colour pre-credits sequence
Original International Trailer

The Grindhouse (So-Called Limited Edition BR)
I'm gonna be completely Honest this BR is a utter disgrace  Grindhouse took there previous dvd version from 2008 and Transfer everything from the dvd on to the HD Blu Ray and put the extras on a second BR Disc to pad this set!! All the extras are copied and pasted from the dvd and it's Cheap and a joke over all The only thing remotely exclusive is the Bonus CD with the Newly Remastered Soundtrack album (The cd comes in this uber cheap cardboard case God forbid they figure out how to put it in the case
I'm pretty sure Grindhouse bought the US Rights to the Arrow HD Transfer and just carried over the Film itself and tacked on ""old"" dvd extras
The Grindhouse Version is a quick money grab Nothing more nothing less (No Real exclusives) Except a CD that's in a cheap cardboard case
I payed $30.00 for the BR when it was on sale Massive waste of $$$$ IMO

Without a doubt buy and cherish the Arrow Home Video Version that is the BEST and only way to get a Proper BR of the Beyond
Buy the 2008 Grindhouse Release dvd don't Support a Company that Thinks so little of Fans the only thing they give is a bloody CD Soundtrack for a exclusive selling point
I Love The Beyond The film over all is Close to Perfect  9.8/10
But, whatever you do DON'T Buy the Grindhouse BR it's a massive money grab that is a smack to the face to Fulci and his fans!",1436832000,,7079,4.316265060240964

I must say that I was a little disappointed.  Basically, if you have seen the trailer, you have seen all the scenes and moments worth watching in the film.  I loved the music and found it very haunting, but you need more than that to make a great horror film.  It wasn't awful and I would watch it again,  but it doesn't even hold a candle to most other classic horror films that I can think of.  I would recommend it to people who enjoy ""B"" horror films from the 70s and 80s, fans of Italian horror (this movie is in English), and just any horror fan really.

AS I WRITE THIS....MY FINGERS ARE TREMBLING IN PURE TERROR!!!!! DUE TO THIS MOVIE...I AM AFRAID THAT ZOMBIES ARE GOING TO EAT ME!!!!

LUCIO FULCI DIRECTED THE BEYOND. HE IS KNOWN FOR A DRAMATIC MUSICAL SCORE, ""UNIQUE"" SPECIAL EFFECTS....AND BAD DUBBING.

He is also known for making the most of a low budget and sadly that isn't the case for the BEYOND...right before a person is HORRIBLY MUTILATED....the screen frame suddenly skips...and in the persons place sits a WOODEN MANNEQUIN...as the MANNEQUIN is grotesquely mawled to death we clearly see glue and the EXPRESSIONLESS FACE coming apart at the seams!!!

THE STORY IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. SOME LADY INHERITED A HOUSE. PEOPLE START DYING IN STRANGE WAYS......SOME BLIND PERSON WARNS THE LADY TO GET THE HELL OUT OF TOWN. DOES THE LADY LISTEN? Yes...and the movie ends in a abrupt and peaceful fashion. NOT!!!!!

WHILE SOME MIGHT REGARD THE BEYOND AS ""GARBAGE"" AND ""ABSOLUTE DRIVEL""...lucio RESPONDED HEAD ON to the criticism!!!! He said that he would NEVER BE CONFINED to such things as TRADITIONAL PLOT POINTS!!!! He wanted the film to have a DREAM like energy.....that's why certain people die and show up again with no explanation....that's why the characters act in mind numbingly dumb ways...it makes perfect sense to me!!!!

THE BEYOND AKA THE SEVEN DOORS OF HELL IS NOT ONLY THE GREATEST HORROR FILM OF ALL TIME....IT IS THE GREATEST FILM EVER. IT IS UNPARALLELED IN EVERY WAY. WATCH IT AND YOU SHALL BE CONVERTED.

The sound, especially on surround sound, is really magnificent. I haven't heard an older horror film ever sound this great. The packaging is fantastic, including the extra disc of the soundtrack. And lastly, the special features are an absolute treat. Especially the interview with Catherine Macoll (check spelling on her name).

1107021,5,6305972079,"This has to be the ultimate The Beyond release.
The soundtrack comes in one of those cardboard/paper sleeves,and not in an actual case.  The music has never sounded better, Grindhouse
really put in the work in the CD as well as the movie. Once you open up the actual BluRay case(which is of the same type that Criterion uses for their Blurays), you'll see not a reversible cover but a complete Lucio Fulci filmography.  Nothing too interesting for a longtime fan, but useful if The Beyond is your first Fulci film.
The movie is what matters,and it looks really good.  All the colors looks vibrant(well as vibrant as a movie about doorways to hell can be!), and I didn't notice any imperfections. I've never owned any of the previous versions, but the image looks really sharp on my 40 inch screen.

The menu is mostly static, with a picture of Emily in the front, and a static-y hotel in the background(the music that plays is the main piano theme). Most of the extras are on the second disc, but the first does have the color version of the pre-credit sequence(you're given both german and english audio options). You also get a mini collection of trailers for the Beyond, along with tv spots(yes, you do get a trailer for the rare ""7 Doors of Death"" edit of Fulci's classic,which tries to sell the Beyond as some kind of slasher flick).  The best extra here however is the wonderful commentary with Catriona MacColl and the always awesome David Warbeck. He really sounded like he had fun recording it.

The second disc is where the main extras are. The menu background image is of the Book of Eibon, with more of Frizzi's music playing (the same music when Emily first opens the book in the film). You get Interviews, Still Galleries, and Grindhouse Releasing Prevues.  If you're a David Warbeck fan, you will love the 1996 Festival of Fantasic Films one, which I believe was the last one he did.

Overall, if you are a Fulci fan, you need this set in your life.  :)",1427241600,,1968,4.568181818181818
1107022,4,6305972079,"I just received this 3 Disc Blu-Ray Edition today.  So it is brand spanking new!  While I am not a HUGE Lucio Fulci fan, I do have an appreciation for his work.  First & foremost, Grindhouse has gone out of their way to put the Film AND the extras on 2 Blu-Ray discs (Normally most companies will put the extras on a DVD disc with the Feature Film on the Blu-Ray Disc).  And the third disc is a CD of the film's Score/Music.
  That being said, the transfer to Blu-Ray is AWESOME.  The picture is STUNNINGLY great!  The sound quality is equaly as good.  Seeing some of said features, while they didn't need said Blu-Ray treatment, are also equally well done.  And having the Movie score/soundtrack, while not necessarily a feature I usually go for with most collections, was very neat to have.  I wound up driving to work listening to it.  Overall I give this 3 Disc Collectors Edition an A + (Amazon Rating of 5 Stars)
  The only reason, and I mean the ONLY reason, I am giving this Film a 4 Star Rating is the simple fact that I don't find this film as good as his other work.  Like ""Zombie 2"" or ""House By The Cemetary"".  But please don't take the 4 Star rating as a reason NOT to buy this Edition.  By all means, I truely feel this Editon of Grindhouse's ""The Beyond"" is EXCELLENT.  And is well worth the money to purchase it.  If you like Fulci & enjoy is work (or just simply enjoy Italian Horror Genre Films), than by all means, this Edition by Grindhouse is one of the supior editions I have bought.

Story goes a portal is underneath this hotel and evil things are brewing. This is hardcore cool man all the gore scenes are unique
 The story is just one of those that i rememner watching the movie when i was about 5or 6 with my mom. I remembered this and licked it up. I am a big fan of Lucio Fulci and i have a ton of his films. Some recommendations would be House by the Cemetery,Cat in the Brain,Zombie,City of the Living Dead,Maniac Cop,Don't Torture a Duckling ...i could go on and on. However the version i got had an interview with Lucio Fulci himself and if your a metal fan you'll love
this they got the video for
Necrophagia's And You Will Live in
Terror and i love metal. I'm a big
Necrolhagia fan and Phil Anselmo
fan so that's a bonus.
The movie is really deep in the bayou of Louisiana where a hotel has been cursed for years because 40 years previous the hotel & townspeople kill this ""ungodly warlock"" and torture him then wall him up in room 36 and never speak of it. Fast forward 40 years and it all starts up again,the terrible accidents of the people on the property. There is a blind woman who shows up and then tries to warn the people (especially the lead Catriona McCall) until her dog rips her throat out.

Things appear and disappear without reason, characters are then aren't.  A girl is orphaned in an instant and left to wander, no one to care for her.  We quickly learn that guide dogs aren't to be trusted.  Books come and go while tall ladders and scaffolding lead to great falls.  What's the point in staying at a hotel that has little to boast but a flooded cellar and a gateway to hell (scenic route notwithstanding)?  This is a triumph of desolation.  Hieronymus Bosch would be so proud.  This is everyone's worse nightmare.  Favorite scene, the guy who rises out of a bathtub of dark goo to make use of a nail in the wall.

1107116,5,6305972079,"I first fell upon The Beyond in a video store. Only instead of The Beyond, it was titled Seven Doors of Death. I bought it because I've heard of Lucio Fulci's work and heard how he tends to go overboard with the violence. It was cheap too, but sadly this DVD release was completely botched. Supposedly it was widescreen but it seemed more like it was instead of just having two bars on top and bottom, it had a black box around it. A big one at that leaving about 40 50 percent of the screen black while I watched the movie. Pathetic, so I decided to get a legit release of this movie and I forked over the 20 dollars to get the Grindhouse Releasing of The Beyond. It was worth it.

I was able to fully watch the movie without having the nagging realization that I'm watching a small screen with black around it (trust me it was annoying). This release blows the other release out of the water, and it is too uncut in all it's gory glory.

A movie that relies more on heavy atmosphere than a solid story (like a Dario Argento film) it pulls it off well. Lots of great kills, cheesy dialogue, and plain crazyness makes this film a great movie to watch with friends and have laugh out loud time.
 The extras aren't really that engaging with the most interesting one being interviews with people who worked with Lucio Fulci (sadly they aren't that interesting to listen to, to be honest.)

Still a great release, and a must get for Italian horror fans.",1392249600,,1449,4.3357933579335795

The only good thing about this film is the ending which features a strange 70's soundtrack, matte backdrop of hell and a bizarre expression on the characters faces, reminscient of Dario Argento's films, other than that, this is a waste of time.",1389830400,,534,4.752688172043011

1107121,3,6305972079,"For all but his most ardent fans, Italian director Lucio Fulci can be somewhat of an acquired taste.  Memorable more for their gore than for coherent plotlines, Fulci's oeuvre boasts outrageous imagery that often tests the gag reflex of the most hardened horror veterans: major eyeball damage is always a threat for the characters who populate Fulci's world, as is throat ripping, flesh melting, chain flogging, head crushing, gut munching and any other other disgusting fate that can be conjured up by the human mind.  All this, and more, is on vivid display in what many fans consider to be Fulci's masterpiece, ""The Beyond"".  Certainly, ""The Beyond"" is (I think) his most lavishly baroque excursion into the grotesque, although describing it as a ""masterpiece"" might be a stretch. Since the film's 1981 release, movie special effects have come a long way, but, to be sure, the blood and gore on display here are plenty revolting, even in scenes where the moviemaker's trickery is obvious.

The plot, such as it is, involves a hotel in the Louisiana bayou that is situated over one of the seven doors to hell.  In the early part of the 20th Century, a horde of angry townsfolk (who make the angry townsfolk in Universal's ""Frankenstein"" movies look like the Seven Dwarfs) track a local artist to the aforementioned hotel, where, believing him to be a warlock, torture and murder him in the grisliest manner.  Fast forward 50 or so years, when a young New Yorker named Liza inherits the hotel and sets about renovating the crumbling structure. This does not set well with the demonic residents, who immediately embark upon a course of gruesome mayhem that, somehow, goes undetected for much of the film by our heroine and her new friend, John, the local doctor.  There's a blind girl named Emily, who seems to have dropped in from some sort of limbo, essentially to set up the other characters as sacrifices, but who ends up (to her detriment) being more of a help than a hindrance.  Other characters come and go, some showing up, seemingly, for the sole purpose of dying a hideous death, and things happen that move  the story nowhere, but the atmosphere Fulci creates is genuinely creepy, and there are some evocative shots of New Orleans.  In fact, the movie, lovingly restored and presented by Anchor Bay, looks great, beautiful, in fact, in spite of the horrific murders.

The performances are really not as bad as I'd feared (and heard).  Fulci regular, Catriona MacColl, gives a spirited performance as the attractively spunky (if none too bright) Liza.  Although British, MacColl makes a convincing American yuppie-type, while David Warbeck, also a Brit, plays it strait-laced to the point of being wooden, as the local doctor/hero.  Also memorable is ""Inferno's"" Veronica Lazar, as the hotel maid; with her wild hair and slovenly manner, she lurks in the shadows knowingly,  a little like Agnes Moorehead in ""Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte"".  Cinzia Monreale, as the blind Emily, with her ominous warnings and flighty departures, makes the most of a role both sympathetic and menacing.  The rest of the players are interesting, too, although few are allotted more than a few minutes of screen time.

At its best, ""The Beyond"" is like a carefully crafted, beautifully filmed nightmare that is effective and disturbing, without having a particularly coherent narrative.  However,  that is almost overridden by Fulci's penchant for lingering lovingly on gross-out scenes of carnage--sometimes for minutes at a time--which seems gratuitous, bordering on obscene.  But that's Fulci, extreme and fearless as a filmmaker, so you either take him or leave him. Having heard so much about this film through the years, I really wanted to like it more than I do.  As it is,  ""The Beyond"" has a fantastic look and feel--the atmosphere, in this case, is almost everything--but you have to possess a certain amount of patience and have a certain sensibility (not to mention, the stomach) for this kind of thing, otherwise you're not likely to appreciate it.",1377475200,,4048,4.982169390787519

1107123,5,6305972079,"This was my second Arrow video purchase, the first being Dario Argento's Phenomena aka Creepers on Blu-Ray, and I was very happy to get this on DVD finally, along with the great packaging goodies like the booklet, poster, and four-sided sleeve. I've been a huge fan of Lucio Fulci since I was a teenager when I first saw this movie. It shocked the hell out of me and reminded me of H.P. Lovecraft's stories, who's my favorite author, but with a spaghetti western and gore-ish type flavor added. The main thing I got from this film was the intense moody atmosphere with the New Orleans dreary setting and the masterful music of Fabio Frizzi. I love movies where the atmosphere is most important and in The Beyond it is all about the atmosphere. There are a couple of gore scenes that don't really do anything for me anymore, but they don't take away from the horror of the situation. This is my 2nd favorite of Fulci's films, the first being ZOMBIE, but THE BEYOND will always have a special place in my heart. If you're looking for an intense story with a great plot and well drawn characters, then this is not your movie. However, if you like moody, epic, and retro-stylized films then this is definitely for you. It's great to see Fulci's movies coming out in these Arrow Video collections-I wish they were blu-ray though, but that's okay. Also, when I tried to watch this on my PS3 and then on my regular DVD player it didn't work, so I had to watch it on my computer, which was okay but still would like to see an all-region blu-ray version released.

1107124,4,6305972079,"I have always liked this film from 1 of my favourite Italian Horror directors, Lucio Fulci. I like the look of the film and gore
effects looks mostly good to me, despite some of course looking fake now. Also the music by regular composer of
Lucio, Fabio Frizzi who think is a very good composer. I really like the main theme.

I think some of the zombies look good and some don`t. This also stars the lovely British actress, Catriona MacColl who
was in 3 Fulci films. Who now sports an southern accent in this film. Not perfect sounding accent, some of her
pronunciation of words sounds English, like a Londoner, where she was born. It`s Catriona`s own voice. She dubbed it
herself in all 3 films.

Picture quality: 4/5

This Arrow Video Blu-ray looks much better than my old Anchor Bay DVD. Much improved contrast, blacks, colours,
details and sharpness. The blood and such of course looks improved. Some problems with DNR and noise again. Some
scenes looks too clean and smooth. I remember the film grain looking more like noise than actually grain. So, it seems
like the grain and noise is mixed in together.

I actually saw this using the corrected replacement version which Arrow Video still have, but won`t have it forever. The
faulty disc was only on a 25 GB disc + an average of 12 bitrate and the film took only 8 GB. This replacement disc is on
a 50 GB and an average of 27 bitrate and the film is using 18 GB of total 25 GB. The last 7 GB is used on the
remaining audio tracks and the extras which is in 1080p.

The corrected disc have better blacks and the overblown contrast which the faulty disc have is gone + some pixelation
and artifacts. This is the best the film has looked on home video.

1107125,5,6305972079,"They definitely don't make horror films like this anymore! ""The Beyond"" is a supernatural nightmare, and easily one of Lucio Fulci's best films!

People begin dying in mysterious accidents, eyeballs are gouged out, flesh-melting acid is spilled onto faces, tarantula spiders attack, dogs go mad and turn against there owners, and the dead return to life in order to drag the living into hell!
It's nice to watch a film that doesn't play by the rules that most ""haunted place"" movies tend to be regulated to! And any movie that features a fight scene between a zombie and a dog gets top marks in my book!

1107206,3,6305972079,"Fulci's ""The Beyond"" is a creepy little romp centered around one of the 7 portals to Hell. Specifically, a run-down hotel on the outskirts of New Orleans. The film starts off in the 1920's when a murderous mob from town storms the hotel where they murder a painter, accusing him of being a warlock. Flash foward sixty years and a young woman who inherited the old hotel is trying to get it up and running again.

Bad idea what with a gate to Hell located next to the leaky pipes in the basement. After a series of strange accidents, and ghostly encounters with a blind woman, the young woman and a local doctor try to solve what is causing all of the trouble.

Sometimes I just get that horror itch that only a 1980's Italian horror flick can scratch. I love the excessive gore, the music and the general nightmare-like atomosphere found in films like ""House by the Cemetery"", ""City of the Living Dead"" or ""Zombie"". ""The Beyond"" fits nicely right alongside those blood soaked titles, and really has it's moments. I really enjoyed the sepia toned opening, and the haunting final minutes of the film are some of Fulci's best work. The gore flows freely of course, and the atmosphere genuinely creepy, a nightmarish vibe runs through the whole film.

There are a few mis-steps in ""The Beyond"", like the laughable tarantula attack and the sound effects that go with it, but overall it's a fun creepy ride. The DVD is well worth adding to your collection simply for the extras. An Fulci interview, interviews with cast and crew, full trailer, and the print looks and sounds fantastic!

1107210,2,6305972079,"The reviewer on amazon going around saying things like ""Fulci is god!"" probably was somewhat overwhelmed he had a catalog so full as he has, but forgot to check out the contents therein.  Fulci began with some interesting films, westerns and some pretty good giallos, but was always over-shadowed by other directors who showed him up, until he stumbled upon a cross-section of giallo and something new: splatter flicks.  He had a minor sensation in 1979 with ""Zombie"" starring Tisa Farrow which began a cult following for his incredibly slow films which allowed for some extended scenes of decay and mutilation, but less on continuity and thereby credibility.  This includes films like ""House by the Cemetery"" and later ""House of Clocks"" (made for TV originally (in the age of permissiveness), but incredibly bad in make-up and special effects that are disgusting but somehow unbelievable and all moving at a snail's pace).  So in between Fulci had his day with his new-found and cultivated fame and produced his ""masterpiece,"" ""The Beyond.""  The script has so many holes and scenes that are ineptly left to viewer's discretion as what is happening to appear sloppy, and scenes where you scream at the screen because the characters act so dumb.  (And Fulci even leaves his actor's poor takes in to contribute to the amateurishness).  There is a genuine cohesiveness that surrounds the script that elevates this particular subject matter over his other stuff.  Granted, I have not seen ""City of the Living Dead"" or some others, but I've been taken in by just enough of his hype to know he should have stuck to his guns originally when he had a talent for making films that stood as art and not product.  Fulci is quoted as saying he finds the things he films ""repugnant,"" ""but it has to be done.""  It's so like someone who believes God is responsible for all the terrible things in life.",1311897600,,1886,4.829192546583851

This import from Arrow has got a brilliant and detailed transfer of the 1080p print. Colors are bold and the reds really shine (to the point of looking fake). The soundtrack is DTS-HD and sounds great with bass and surround galore.
Be forwarned, the initial pressing messed the beginning segment up. Instead of sepia, it wound up black and white. Arrow has fixed this problem by releasing the right print of the movie. If you get one that is bad, contact Arrow Video and they are quick to ship out the right one.
With all the pressing problems, this IS the best way to watch and hear this Fulci classic until Blue Underground releases their version on blu ray.

Roger Ebert, THE CHICAGO SUN-TIMES
""THE BEYOND does not disappoint.""

Perhaps nothing is quite as exciting as viewing classic Fulci films for the first time & this will be an experience you're virgin eyes won't soon forget.

The Beyond is perhaps Fulci's most surreal, yet visceral experience & is regarded by many as his masterpiece. Although Fulci has been gone from the realms of horror cinema for many years now, his work lives on through various re-prints & re-issues. Thankfully, Grindhouse Releasing saw to it that this film was re-issued in 2008 & with the same goodies that Anchor Bay's Limited Edition Tin Box bequeathed to us many moons ago. Sadly, that tin box has been out of print for many years now but this release will definitely appease fans who would surely miss The Beyond.

Not unlike many great horror films, The Beyond has gained an impressive cult following over the years so it's fair to say Fulci's classic has come a long way from being the heavily censored film Seven Doors Of Death released to America in 1983. Thankfully, we can now see the original uncut version through either the out-of-print Anchor Bay releases or Grind house Releasing. Rumor has it there are also cheaper DVDs floating around in America under the Seven Door Of Death title that feature the uncut version but I cannot substantiate this info nor did I wish to waste money.

Initially, Fulci had intended to make a film about a woman who inherits a haunted house but was convinced to shoot a film with zombies as the living dead were still all the rage around that time in Europe. Lucio agreed to re-write the film altogether including zombies & even modify the original intended ending. Irregardless of the revisions, fans from around the world have cited this final product to be one of Fulci's greatest works.

In 1927, Seven Doors' Hotel is the site of a brutal murder involving a lynch mob determined to kill an artist believed to be a warlock, which in turn opens one of the seven portals to Hell. Many decades later, a beautiful young woman (Catriona MacColl) inherits this hotel with the intention of re-opening it for business unaware of spooky goings-on in the area. Through her renovation, the hell-portal is activated & she finds herself dealing with ghosts, zombies, & other seemingly indestructible entities. With the assistance of a doctor (David Warbeck), the two must be figure out a way to escape the evil & madness which lingers on.

I can understand why so many have lavished praise on this work & it actually looks better each time I see it. I wish I'd never let go of my Limited Edition Tin Box set that Anchor Bay released back in 2000 but I guess one lives & learns. I am glad, however, that the film is still readily available for purchase online & that Grindhouse granted us yet another chance to view the film in it's entirety.

I own many of the old classics, but this movie is no masterpiece. Anybody who likes these kind of movies should stick with Argento or Romero, those are the real masters of horror. I would recommended if you can find this movie for about $5, but don't pay more for it. Also bought Zombie, it's a little bit better. But doesn't come close to Dawn Of The Dead or any other Romero movie in that matter.",1304812800,,576,4.342592592592593

If you have seen Fulci's film ""Zombie,"" sometimes referred to as Zombie 2, and you enjoyed it, then you will probably enjoy ""The Beyond"" as well.

But The Beyond  didn't have that same feel.  Maybe because it has been  25 years since i've seen The Gates of Hell, special effects  were more advanced for the 80s compared to the 70s.  But  watching a movie in  2010 from the 1980's  you really zoom in on the bad effects.",1299283200,,472,3.989130434782609
1107265,4,6305972079,"Lucio Fulci, the master of Italian gore cinema, concludes the ""Gates of Hell"" trilogy with what is easily his most sublime and stylish Horror film, THE BEYOND. As is the case with CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD and many of Fulci's other offerings, the swirling atmosphere and suffocating mood in THE BEYOND take precedence over any sort of cohesive storytelling. This time, one of the seven gateways to hell opens up beneath a decaying hotel on the Louisiana bayou, spewing forth armies of the undead and an array of other ungodly creatures to terrorize anyone that stumbles inside. What results is a gooey gore spectacle unlike any other! Fulci is sure to include his trade-marked eye-gouging, while he also depicts scenes of face-melting, shotgun blasts to the face, a bloody tarantula attack, and many other gruesome deaths. If the gore was not tough enough to beat, the ambiance would be nearly impossible. THE BEYOND creates a dreary dreamscape, an inescapable nightmare that leads up to a hopelessly downbeat ending. With a wide number of stunning visuals, THE BEYOND is widely considered to be Lucio Fulci's finest film and a shocking gore opus from one of the masters of the macabre!

1107266,5,6305972079,"If you're new to Lucio Fulci films, look no further, watch The Beyond (aka Seven Doors of Death).  The Beyond is a very original atmospheric zombie/haunted house Italian horror film set in New Orleans.  The effects are gruesome and insane and the storyline is cool.
What a lot of people overlook is the often amazing cinematogrophy of the film.  There are long Kubrickian shots, intense Sergio Leone style shots and the lighting/colors look like a Dario Argento film (intense blue, red shots).
If you are a fan of old school gory horror flicks you HAVE to get this movie.
If you enjoy The Beyond I strongly also reccomend checking out Zombie (aka Zombi 2) and City of The Living Dead (aka The Gates of Hell).
And if you're new to Italian horror you definately want to watch some old Dario Argento films such as Suspiria, Deep Red, Inferno, Bird With the Crystal Plumage, and Demons (Argento didn't direct demons, only wrote and produced it, but its definately worth checking out)",1288569600,,979,4.747058823529412
1107267,4,6305972079,"Lucio Fulci spent his youth in occupied Italy, and he saw the horrors that the Nazi's committed. The fears this imprinted upon him, and the struggle to understand how people could do such things deeply shaped his filmmaking, no more so than in the Gates of Hell trilogy (City of the Living Dead, The Beyond, House by the Cemetery).

In 1920's New Orleans, a painter, Sweick, locks himself in his room and obsessively paints images of a windswept plain littered with bodies of the dead. Strange things are happening in town, and the people blame Sweick. They nail him to the wall of his room and cover him in boiling wax, then entomb the body in part of they labyrinth that makes up the cellar.

Sixty years later, Liza [Catriona MacColl] inherits the dilapidated hotel and begins putting things in order. One of the first jobs is to paint the outside, but work stops when a painter falls from the scaffolding, screaming ""the eyes!"" No one finds out what he means before he dies. Then a second man goes into the basement, to discover the cause of a leak that has filled the cellar with water and kept anyone from venturing there in decades. He discovers the walled off room, and the gate of Hell is re-opened, taking him with it. Both men wind up in the hospital morgue, but not for long, because the powers of evil have a job for them and the other morgue residents to do.

Like its predecessor, City of the Living Dead, in this movie Fulci explores fear through allegory, bringing it to life in the form of mindless zombies who do the bidding of a greater intelligence (one we will not meet until the final movie in the trilogy). In doing so, Fulci returns to his obsession with the Nazis, and the way thousands of Nazi soldiers did the bidding of their evil superiors by simply mindlessly following orders. But behind these minions the real evil lurks, safely tucked away, controlling the chaos and slaughter from afar, just as the Nazi high command did. Fulci's movie is less driven by plot than by a series of nightmarish images that recall his childhood in occupied Italy, as he struggles to understand, and come to terms with the great evil that was done to his people, and so many people.",1288396800,,2195,4.5518987341772155
1107268,3,6305972079,"A young woman from New York inherits a hotel in Louisiana that is really one of the seven doorways to Hell. As she renovates the place, the dead begin to escape and slaughter the living in the kind of horrifically gory sequences that Italian horror is famous for. Only a local doctor and a mysterious blind girl are around to offer assistance as the young woman tries to survive and unravel the inexplicable series of events she's found herself in.

The second film of director Lucio Fulci's so-called ""Gates of Hell Trilogy"", 1981's ""The Beyond"" is often heralded as his masterpiece. This isn't my own, personal opinion. I have only seen a few of his films, not enough to make such a bold statement, but I haven't been inspired to call any of them ""masterpieces"". They are great for gorehounds if they are not picky about realism, and they can have awesome endings (like this one or the end of Zombie), but they focus so much on (often rather fake looking) gory death scenes and the writing is so bad that it can be hard for them to hold my attention, even when they have great stars among the many bad actors, like this film. ""The Beyond"" also has a great setting and a good concept that just are't fleshed out enough. I don't feel the Louisiana feeling is truly captured, probably in part because of the largely Italian cast that is fully dubbed throughout. Plus, there's the fact that zombies were stuck into the story just because they were popular at the time. Watching the film, it does seem like the zombies were thrown in just for the sake of having them. Negatives aside, there's some good, creepy imagery in this movie, and especially the payoff of the final scene. The film stars Catriona MacColl and David Warbeck, who have a delightful commentary on this DVD that I found more enjoyable than just watching the film itself. Some other extras include trailers, still galleries, some insightful interviews, a ""lost"" German pre-credit sequence, a freaky Necrophagia music video, and an intro by Catriona MacColl. It's a great DVD release for true fans of this film. If you're not familiar with it though, ""The Beyond"" may or may not be your cup of tea. I like the concept and the creepy ending very much, but the final product hasn't made me a fan of Italian horror yet. I just don't feel they are well paced or coherently written and put together. The gore is gratuitous in the worst way and the dubbing just doesn't work for me in stories set in English speaking countries. Nevertheless, I'm glad I got the chance to see this one. Any film as beloved by fans as ""The Beyond"" is worth viewing once at least and looks good on the true eclectic's DVD shelf.",1255046400,,2666,4.577405857740586
1107269,3,6305972079,"The Beyond is a 1981 Italian horror film directed by gore pioneer Lucio Fulci.  While this film might have a decent enough story to get more credit than other movies of its ilk, it would be a huge oversight to avoid stressing that this is a very gory movie.  Fulci stares at gore and especially seems fixated on destroyed eyeballs staring right back at him.  It's almost distracting how obsessed he really is with it.  Fulci, who died in 1996 and is often called ""the godfather of gore"", also directed the semi-cult classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombi-II/dp/B0018V0B4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombi II</a>, a film that features the long awaited battle between a shark and a zombie.  That's right, a shark fights a zombie.  Obviously we are not talking about Alfred Hitchcock here, but I'm rating this on perhaps a different scale.  This is a Halloween horror treat that has moderately creepy moments, hilarious zombies, and gore like nobody's business.

In 1927 Louisiana, a cliche angry riot go to this hotel and dump calcium oxide on some poor artist who they believe to be some kind of evil warlock.  They're right actually, and killing him opens up one of the seven doors of hell, and so the dead can now walk the Earth.  Sixty some odd years later and the hotel is inherited by some girl from New York.  The film has some characters that are memorable enough and in the end the story comes together and actually turns out to be pretty interesting.  This was one of those movies I stayed up late watching one night waiting for the actresses to take their clothes off, which tends to happen in movies like this more often than not.  It never happened here but I finished watching it anyway which says something about the quality I suppose.  In other words, even for it is, The Beyond is not total trash.

As it turns out there is even an interesting, albeit vague exploration of life and death happening here that creates a surprisingly unique atmosphere.  If you've seen any of Fulci's other films you might think it was an accident, but some scenes shoot zombies in colored light and so forth which is not only a direct atmosphere tip from Dario Argento, but also very intentional.  There is a creepy surrealist feel in The Beyond.  I'm giving Fulci some credit here, he tried hard to make this movie more than just a splatter film.  On the flip side of the atmosphere coin, and atmosphere is always so crucial in a horror film, the music in The Beyond is nearly unbearable.

Anyway, so I'm giving The Beyond a partial recommendation to those of you who might appreciate a horror film that is gratuitously gory and sort of unique. There is no doubt in my mind that many will call The Beyond garbage.",1254873600,,2760,4.79492600422833
1107270,4,6305972079,"During Sid's journey to do 31 horror reviews for the month of October proves to be a time to get some cult classics in. For us it has to be a mixed bag of everything to do it just right. Our attempt is to sample a little from each type of horror category. Tonight we landed on hell dwelling bloodthirsty zombies, which appears to be a category on it's own. The Beyond is known as one of director Lucio Fulci's best works showing off his twisted imagination in a world nobody wants to enter, especially an elf named Sid.

Story goes like this; New Yorker Liza Merril winds up inheriting a run down hotel in Louisiana and decides to make a little investment out of it. Not a good idea. She dumps her savings into the building in hopes to restore it only to have most of the repair workers die off quick. Reason being the hotel was built atop one of the gates of Hell, which proves to be not the best real estate property. Despite being warned by a blind woman Liza decides to investigate and finds herself in a world of blood thirsty zombies. Since the portal was opened during construction the dead were permitted to roam free.

This one was a very strange experience, but not in a bad way. Any Italian horror is far different from the typical crap we pump out every week here in the US. It just messes with your brain far more then any other genre. When it comes to the Halloween season this would be a good one to watch despite some slow moments. There were some moments of boredom but not enough to make it a bad watch. When you combine zombies, flesh eating Tarantulas, all knowing blind girl and her killer German Shepard, with a hotel built over the gates of hell you're sure to have an interesting horror on your hands.",1254528000,,1725,4.320987654320987

if you want a good one with little blood and humor go with 'hide and creep' and consider, once again, 'shawn of the dead.
if you want a worst of the crop go with 'zombie lake' or 'dead clowns'.

1107325,5,6305972079,"I always liked the plots and stories from Lucio Fulci movies. The Beyond was the first Fulci movie I've seen so far, though I'll see more. I was very impressed by The Beyond.
 The Beyond takes place in Louisiana at a hotel that was built on a gate of hell. The owner of the hotel is executed by a lynchmob after accusations of witchcraft and occultism. Decades later, the abandoned hotel is reopened by a woman and the gate is unwittingly opened causing hell to break loose.
 Lucio Fulci's giallo films have strong literary devices and themes. The smartest example would be Cat in the Brain. In Cat in the Brain, Fulci plays himself having PTSD-like symptoms when he has visions(which is archive footage) of his films. I'm not being specific about Cat in the Brain's theme of course because I don't want to spoil it. That's why many don't get Fulci's films, they think the films make no sense. I believe the main inspiration of Fulci's supernatural and psychological horror is the concept of nightmares and possibly his experiences. I think I should stop there and go back on The Beyond.
 I enjoyed The Beyond. The gore was good and disgusting which is typical of Fulci but I think Fulci made more extreme; like the gore in City of the Living Dead and The New York Ripper. Katherine MacColl is one of those cult actresses I like and she appears in this. Katherine also appeared in similar Fulci films City of the Living Dead and House by the Cemetery which are somewhat related; though House by the Cemetery is much different and less apocalyptic. David Warbeck and Sarah Keller were good too and that's all I could say about them. Fabio Frizzi's score is very occultish sounding which fits well. Now jumping off topic, listen to Frizzi's occultish ""Apoteosi del Mistero"" off of City of the Living Dead which is more haunting and occultish. I highly recommend The Beyond to horror fans. It is one of Fulci's most original films.",1237680000,,1928,4.648093841642229

Co-starring David Warbeck and Sarah Keller, this is Lucio Fulci's all-time great masterpiece. Influenced by the works of H.P Lovecraft, this Italian supernatural horror thriller has became one of the best horror movies of it's time and still holds up. Sure the plot is silly and at times the film can be ridiculous, but it is a very shocking and gory as hell movie with stunning images, scares and of course gore galore like eyes being plucked out, throat ripping and even the infamous spider attack sequence. The gore and make-up effects by Giannetto De Rossi are just realistic and jaw-dropping and the music score by Fabio Frizzi is very haunting, this is one of the most atmospheric and scariest movies of the genre and one of my favorite horror movies in this must see movie.

Myself and my extended family( 5 adults and no kids (PS this film is not for children)) and I sat down to watch it recently and we knew what to expect from the beginning...ie- 1)no real plot, 2)bad acting, 3)bad dubbing, 4)over the top ridiculously fake gore and 5) a Fulci movie that would be so bad it would be comical. I mean what an opportune time to watch this film... we started laughing hysterically when the doctor was introduced...his character name...John McCaine. John McCaine kept us laghing throughout the film... I mean I remember the main female character running into a hospital with McCaine, she is hysterical because of all the zombies and McCaine raises his hand infront of her face to tell her ""It's OK, I'm a doctor"".....oh well that makes everything alright then I guess...lol. McCaines magical revolver is also amusing... firstly for those of you who do not know about guns, a standard 1980's revolver would hold either 4 or 6 bullets depending on the caliber of the weapon. Judging the size of the weapon McCaine uses in the hospital scenes it is a standard 6 shot revolver... McCaine upon first using the weapon is able to fire 9...count em 9 shots from the 6 shot revolver before its empty.  He then retreats into a hospital room, and upon the zombies breaking in and may I add without reloading the gun, he is able to fire 9 more shots at the zombies before the gun is empty again. After this Mcaine and his girl retreat into an elevator and he states that he has to reload the gun...... we were laughing to the point of tears when Mcaine is briefly viewed reloading the gun by putting 1 bullet down the barrel....... this movie was just as ridiculous as the above described scene throughout...... we gave it a 5 star review because we have never laughed so hard in a long time.",1226880000,,1873,4.522123893805309
1107334,5,6305972079,"I already reviewed The Beyond so if you wanna see my thoughts on the film itself just go through my reviews until you find it. This review is mainly for the DVD.

Many people hail Lucio Fulci's The Beyond his masterpiece though I would have to disagree with that and go with Don't Torture a Duckling, but The Beyond was a solid flick in the career of Lucio Fulci, which is best remembered for the crazy amount of gore, which believe me this film has plenty of. While I did enjoy The Beyond as I've gone back and watched some of Lucio Fulci's movies from the 70s I've sort of lost patience with his splatter flicks. While I still enjoy The Beyond and some of his other movies from the splatter era, but when compared to such movies as Don't Torture a Duckling, The Psychic and even Zombie his later work fails a bit in my opinion. But with that said The Beyond is still a solid movie by Fulci.

The new DVD released by Grindhouse Releasing is the same released a few years ago by Anchor Bay. Anchor Bay released two versions on DVD. They released a standard DVD with very little in the way of extras and they released a limited edition tin chock full of extra features. Grindhouse Releasing has re-released the limited edition tin (without the tin case) and normally I would give a negative review due to it being the same exact disc. But the reason I'm giving this DVD release such praise for one reason; the Limited Edition is now long out of print (same for the standard DVD).

Getting yourself a copy of The Beyond isn't easy to do that goes for both the Tin and standard DVD and if you are lucky enough to come across either you'll have to shell out a lot of money. While it would be nice if The Beyond had some new extras it's really not a very big deal since the DVD is very hard to come by now. For those of you out there that have the Limited Edition Tin there is no reason to buy the new DVD as long as the DVD you own is in good condition. All you are getting here is new cover art and that's it; for those with the regular DVD if you liked the movie a lot than I would recommend buying the new disc.

Some features include Images of The Beyond, which is a collection of stills from the movie as well as stills from the making of the movie, the score plays over the photos. There are also brief interviews with David Warbeck, Catriona MacColl and Lucio Fulci. Than we have Voices of the Beyond, which features interviews with several members of the cast and crew.

Voices of the Beyond is highly enjoyable, but truth is you won't learn anything new on Lucio Fulci. This seems to have been done at a horror convention and sections of this also appear on the Media-Blasters DVD for Zombi 2 (though they the interviews are different, but in both they pretty much say the same thing about Fulci). I suppose those who know nothing of Lucio Fulci will enjoy this more, but even we fans who already know about him will still find this enjoyable even if again nothing new is learned. There is also an audio commentary by David Warbeck and Catriona MacColl, which was on both Anchor Bay DVDs, but anyways, the commentary track is one of the very best out there. You learn a lot about the film and it's actually quite funny at times.

The DVD list an onset interview with Lucio Fulci, but the interview is actually from the set of Demonia. We also get the lost German pre-credit sequence, which can also be viewed in English. All the extras on the DVD are excellent and a must have for fans. The only new feature is a brief introduction before the movie with star Catriona MacColl.

As for the picture and sound I believe it's the same as the Anchor Bay release. I previously owned the Anchor Bay VHS so I cannot compare the Grindhouse DVD to the Anchor Bay DVD, but I do believe it's the same exact transfer. Overall this is an excellent DVD and once again Grindhouse Releasing proves why they are the very best for horror films. The Beyond DVD is a must own for all fans, but like I said if you have the Tin and it's in good condition there's no reason to buy this. Despite the Grindhouse Releasing being the same I'll cut them some slack since the DVD from Anchor Bay was very tough to come by these days.",1226102400,,4208,4.292191435768262

in my top 30 and Clintster is talking from 1919-2008 TOP 30!!!  This is the story of a old New Orleans hotel built upon one of the 7 gateways to hell, and no we are not counting the one in Brooklyn Heights ala THE SENTINAL!

This movie has fantastic music and keeps at a steady pace with beautiful
cinematography and GORE galore.  Though this is shot on the cheap, this has moments of surreal beauty in its TERROR and if I may still some vocabulary  from my dear friend NO LONGER DEVIL has a sepia-tinted opening.  Watch for  the incredible shot of light shining through a hole blasted through a little girls head(yes Fulci does not play by the rules of HORROR either and like HENRY-WHO CAN KILL A CHILD & JAWS  kiddies are not safe :) I feel this was a homage to Sir Argento's INFERNO and if it was then Messier Fulci has great taste.

1107392,3,6305972079,"When it comes to Lucio Fulci I always say either you'll love him or you'll hate him. Fulci's style isn't for everyone; some will hail him as a master of horror and others as a no talent hack who can only deliver on the gore. I do understand both sides of the argument; Fulci's splatter era while fun films were often very incoherent, which does at times bring the product down.

I'm a pretty big fan of Lucio Fulci, but people often forget he was a filmmaker who can actually tell a story that makes sense and that is very suspenseful without the over the top gore his later films would feature. Seven Notes in Black AKA The Psychic and Don't Torture a Duckling are prime examples of his talents as a filmmaker that I urge even people who have disliked his work to search for. The Beyond is hailed by many as his masterpiece, but I still go with Don't Torture a Duckling.

As I've gone back and searched for Fulci's early to mid 70s work I have found myself starting to lose patience with his splatter era. Movies I once loved I now think are alright and I say to myself what happened to this filmmaker who did such amazing work? The Beyond does suffer from the typical 80s Fulci problem. The plot is very incoherent and nothing ever is really explained thus making it for me a little frustrating.

If you want gore though you will very much find it here. Giannetto De Rossi did the gore F/X and this just might be his very best work of his amazing career. You have eyes being ripped out, a face melted by acid, tongues ripped out, ears ripped off a throat ripping that features a fountain of blood and gun blast to the head, which leads the head being blown to pieces. This is where the reputation of The Beyond stems from; this just might be Fulci's goriest and the F/X are just as good as any out there and are a million times better than any CGI.

But the fact so little is explained plot wise does for me take away from the film. The screenplay written by Dardano Sacchetti, Giorgio Mariuzzo & Lucio Fulci isn't very good. This might be a low budget 80s horror flick, but still not a logical excuse. While the plot is interesting nothing is ever really explained. The characters are quite stupid, some more than others and while there is a hint of a plot had things been better explained it easily would have made up for any flaws.

As director Lucio Fulci does put together some nice scenes of suspense and his gore shots are wonderful. Fulci's most popular run is from 79-82 and while this is one of his stronger outings from that era I wouldn't rate it as one of the best. While The House by the Cemetery might be just as incoherent that one has an eerie feel that I felt was lacking at times here. That's not to say there isn't any suspense and or tension, there's plenty of that, but I just felt it was lacking at times.

The late David Warbeck played Dr. John McCabe and has to be one of the dumbest characters I've seen. And when I say dumb, I don't mean in a fun way. He shoots the zombies in the body than finally does a headshot, which kills the zombies. The next few are headshots than for whatever reason he begins to shoot them in the body than the head. That was just damn annoying.

Warbeck though does a solid job despite playing a rather idiotic character. The rest of the cast is also good; one time Fulci regular Katherine MacColl stars along with Antoine Saint-John, Cinzia Monreale (under the name Sarah Keller) and Fulci regular Al Cliver.

The Beyond despite all the flaws does make for a fun time. The pacing is pretty good so you'll never be bored and the gore is simply amazing. This one is insanely gory. Like I said I do enjoy The Beyond and I do very much enjoy Fulci's splatter flicks, but after watching some of his earlier work and seeing what a terrific filmmaker he was (not to say he wasn't in the 80s), but after seeing how he can tell a coherent story that was well written my patience aren't what they once were with his splatter era. But again despite any flaws The Beyond remains one his stronger efforts and makes for a great double feature with City of the Living Dead as both deal with the gates of hell.",1208131200,,4152,4.314102564102564
1107393,5,6305972079,"This review is for the Anchor Bay DVD edition.

This film is the best and is a gorehound's fantasy, literally. But beware of the edited versions! The original UNCUT version on DVD is manufactured by ANCHOR BAY and Anchor Bay only. It is 87 minutes in run time. It is severely out of print.

If you come across a copy of The Beyond for sale that advertises itself as an import, especially if it is from Korea. These versions vary in run time but are usually cut by a few minutes. I have one that is 84 minutes long, but the cover artwork and special features are identical to the Anchor Bay version.
The ""Seven Doors of Death"" version of The Beyond is about 83 minutes long. The edited versions have alot of the gore cut out of them. For example, the eye-gouging scene, the spider attack, and the whipping and acid attack scenes have been shortened, as well as other parts.
  Bootlegging of The Beyond on DVD is rampant because the film is such a classic and so incredibly hard to find in it's uncut version. Somebody needs to reissue this movie uncut. Most of the other Italian gore films have been reissued by other companies. Anchor Bay doesn't seem interested in horror films anymore, and most of their recent releases are NEW movies, usually poorly made direct-to-DVD stuff.

1107395,4,6305972079,"Getting the obvious out of the way, this is a movie for B Horror splatter fans, not for mainstream horror audiences. This movie, like Fulci's other films, places emphasis on graphic depiction of gore material, while paying little to no attention to plot, script, or acting. He definitely succeeds in giving zombie fans what they want, however if you expect anything more you will be disappointed. The script was particularly bad, and not in a cheesy-but-good B movie sort of way, but riddled with inconsistencies and occasionally just plain dumb. Like for example in the hospital scene with all the zombies it's obvious that the only way to take them down is to shoot them in the head, yet the guy wastes 3-4 bullets on a single zombie, gets it with a headshot, and then repeats the same pattern numerous times. Sure enough he runs out of bullets sooner than he wishes to. Acting is pretty bad too, not very credible at all. You have the typical protagonist who's seeing things others aren't, and of course those things aren't there when someone else checks it out, yet the character doesn't sound convincing at all when she's trying to explain that those things really are there and it's not her imagination. You can almost tell someone told her what to say just minutes before and she's struggling to remember. To summarize, this movie is underdeveloped but thrives on its gore factor which is fairly elevated all things taken into consideration. Don't leave this one out of your zombie film collection.",1178928000,,1505,4.814671814671815
1107472,3,6305972079,"The Beyond opens with what has become one of my favorite scenes. A strange man is painting pictures of Hell on a canvas in room 36 of an old Louisana hotel. The year is 1927 and the mans name is Sweik. The natives of the town believe that Sweik is placing a curse on thier village through his drawings and what follows is a typical southern stereotype. A lynch mob storms the hotel and constrains Sweik as he is finishing one of his paintings.

The mob then drags him down a spiral staircase into the basement where he meets his fate in the form of being crucified against a wall and then drenched in flesh eating acid. All while that typical annoying as hell gaillo music is playing in the backgound. Kathrine MacColl inherits the hotel where Shiek meet his unfortunate and horrible demise some six odd years later.

The hotel has all sorts of strange occurances, not the least of which is the consistant flooding in the basement. As she is preparing to open the hotel the flooding in the basement starts to present a real problem, thus she calls in a plumber. Joe the Plumber (yes that is the characters actual name) is called in to fix the issue. What he finds is far more serious than leaky pipe...

The reason that this film works is because of it's take no prisoners presentation. Fulci knows what we want to see, and he more than delivers. It works on the same principle that John Carpenter's 'The Fog' works, the events are presented with no context. You never really know why this guy has no head, or why that lady just got an acid bath. Nor do you care. Fulci doesn't raise any questions and he certainly doesn't answer any, but hey, thats ok with me.",1176163200,,1661,4.421568627450981

They make no sense, they are so ridiculously cheap, the dialogue is horrendous (in both the English dub and the original Italian version), and the acting is atrocious.  However, they are rather nasty in their gore.  You do remember it in all of his films.  Here, it's acid getting poured on someone's face, a man's face being eaten by tarantulas, and the usual zombies getting their brains splattered everywhere.  The ending is a bit surreal (which I usually like endings like that), but I don't know whether it was intentional or just an accident because of lazy, incompetent filmmaking.  I have seen many Fulci films, including House by the Cemetary, Cat in the Brain, New York Ripper, etc..  I saw this one twice.  The first time was with a friend, and she wouldn't shut up during it, commenting on how bad it was.  So I rented it again, and it was as bad as she said it was.  I even watched the original Italian version with English subtitles, and it was still awful.  People swear Fulci's a genius.  You can see his influence on many horror films today, with their emphasis on gore, incoherency, underdeveloped storylines, junk dialogue, and bad acting.  I read that Lucio was originally a comedy director in Italy, and he worked with Toto the Clown, one of the most famous clowns/actors in Italy during his heyday.  Supposedly, those films were really good.  I would like to see them.  They have to be better than this stuff....",1157846400,,1525,4.647940074906367
1107481,5,6305972079,"This is one only for the serious Horror fan not your average `Scream' fan, but of course if one is a serious Horror fan then you already owns this. Yes? .... No? Why the hell not! Are you crazy, this is the crowning glory of Italian zombie/gore/horror cinema?

Lucio Fulci began his career in film at the Experimental Film Studios where he was accepted by Luchino Visconti himself, and spent many years as an assistant director. During this period he made comedies, musicals and westerns, but it was in the late seventies/early eighties when he made the films that would secure his reputation as the King of Gore/Zombie flicks. Between 1979-1981 he made `Zombie Flesh Eaters' (1979); `City Of The Living Dead' (1980); `House By The Cemetery' (1981) and `The Beyond' (1981). All four are essential viewing for any Fulci fan. Did anyone see these at the cinema?I can't think of anything cooler than being able to say you saw these on the big screen. I'm sure the majority of people saw these for the first time on video and it's in this format that these films gathered their cult following, that is of course before they got banned and label as video nasties. Yeah sure ban them it'll only add to the legend. Fulci was the natural successor to George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead, 1968) when he took the zombie film further by adding the blood and guts splatter of the `godfather of gore', Herschell Gordon Lewis (Blood Feast, 1963).

`The Beyond' opens in 1927 where the film has monochromatic brown texture and within a couple minute we get our first taste of things to come followed then by the title sequence with it's foreboding music. Sergio Salvati and Fabio Frizzi who work on all four of the above-mentioned films delivered the cinematography and music respectively. Special make effects were by Giannetto De Rossi and Germano Natali, Rossi would eventually go on to work with Bernardo Bertolucci on `The Last Emperor' (1987). The dubbing can be a bit distracting but that's just the nature of Italian cinema production techniques and no reason to slate the film. The great thing about `The Beyond' is it's wonderful gothic atmosphere, slow pacing along with its surrealist plot. The key to any horror film is atmosphere and I can't believe the rubbish that Hollywood dishes up as horror nowadays. How many more times am I going to have to hear Blue Oyster Cults `Don't Fear the Reaper' playing on a soundtrack or watch the beautiful people running away from hyper energetic wire-fu zombies. Oh please, this is the way zombies should behave.... they hardly move.

It would be silly of me to say that this is great cinema when it's not anywhere near the genius of many, many world cinema giants. What is important though is that it is viewed within the context of gore/zombie cinema, a much-maligned subdivision of horror, not art house or even mainstream cinema. If gore/zombie films are what you like then this is for you, if not then that's ok, but within context this is a five star zombie film. Fulci didn't care what the critics thought of his films but rather what the fans wanted. Check out the other three of this zombie quartet all of which are must haves for serious horror collectors.",1157414400,,3210,4.728571428571429
1107541,3,6305972079,"""The Beyond"" is the flagship film for director Lucio Fulci.  Hailed by many as his best work, it has all the qualities standard to Italian horror from the era.  Style is given much more attention than substance, plot continuity and story development are ignored in favor of the advancement of a particular tone, and above all, gore is the means of delivering that tone to the audience.  For those not familiar with Fulci's work or other Italian horror films done in the same style, The Beyond will probably be baffling and nonsensical to the point of actually angering the casual viewer.  Be forewarned - storyline arcs will appear and disappear without any kind of proper resolution, events will occur for no adequately explainable reason, and eye gouging will most definitely happen much more than is necessary.

What little story exists in this film actually reinforces the nonsensical juxtaposition of random scenes.  A gateway to hell hidden under an old hotel in Louisiana has been opened, and reality is subsequently breaking down.  Undoubtedly this was just a fortunate coincidence, and not any actual purposeful decision on Fulci's part, but at least it's there.  In some respects however, it may have actually been better it Fulci had chosen a different background story for his mood specific gore fest.  The idea of Hell slowly seeping into the world, turning everything inside out and upside down, re-animating the dead, corrupting the innocent and perverting the holy, really should have absolutely terrified the viewer beyond anything they had previously experienced.  Instead, the viewer will mostly just be slightly uncomfortable because of all the gross-out, face dissolving, eye-gouging gore scenes.  To be fair, a thoroughly creepy mood is occasionally achieved successfully, most often when the blind prophetic woman Emily appears, accompanied with the fabulous score by genre favorite Fabio Frizzi.  Of course, even the musical score isn't all good.  The last scene of the film, which is intended to push the viewer over the edge into despair and insanity, is actually irritating and annoying, because the music is strangely upbeat, completely destroying the all important mood.

The Beyond is occasionally great, but mostly mediocre and sometimes sub par.  I suggest all horror fans watch this movie at least once to decide whether Italian horror turns their crank or not.  If this movie frustrates you, you can officially junk the idea of any other Fulci or Argento style work - they only get more bizarre and nonsensical from here.

1107544,2,6305972079,"i have a theory about many gore cult classics: most of them are ""classics"" because a) their fans watched them when they were kids; b) the gore and weirdness strongly affected their impressionable little brains (as well they should); c) as grown-ups, they are afflicted with the same nostalgia for these films that one would have for anything else that was an important part of one's growing-up.

in the absence of this or a similar theory, it really is difficult to explain why ""the beyond"" has acquired the reputation that it has. the film is essentially a montage of gore scenes (some more convincingly done than others) cushioned with bad acting, a paper-thin plot, equally thin characters, and admittedly gorgeous photography. it really isn't particularly scary (or perhaps my problem is that i simply don't find zombies terribly scary and that knowing what i do about special effects, it's hard to take the gore seriously.) the music by fabio frizzi is simply absurd -- in typical Italian ""beat"" style, it is incongruously jaunty when it should really be trying to creep you out instead -- and is tremendously effective in destroying whatever feelings of dread that Fulci is able to drum up with his more atmospheric sequences (of which there are several - including an almost Hitchcockian moment when one of the protagonists encounters a blind girl and her dog on an empty highway.) if you like gore you'll be in hog heaven -- various fleshy surfaces are punctured, perforated, and ripped in quite creative ways, and the camera lingers lasciviously over every gaping wound to the point of it being yawn-inducing.

by the time the atmospheric finale rolls round, you're sort of past caring and are more inclined to suspect Fulci of last-minute intellectual pretensions to compensate for his lack of film-making skills.

if you're in the mood for some Fulci and want something truly scary, give ""The House by the Cemetery"" a whirl instead -- in spite of all its defects, much better than this overrated ""masterpiece"". better yet, exhaust the dario argento catalog first.

Secondly: I've given it 4 stars on the Fulci scale, not in comparison with another director or film (ie: Suspiria). That said, I think Zombie is his classic, though The Beyond will certainly creep you out enough to take a bathroom or beverage break and maybe even turn the lights back on. This is mainly due to the speed with which he jumps into the gore scenes. Several actors stand out in this; the little girl and the blind woman (the maid isn't bad either). I thought this one interesting as it focuses more on the curse of hell's seven gates than on zombies. This involves a number of deaths, but they all seem to be by the same hand or related to the nebulous curse. In fact it's not until quite late in the film that you begin to get the idea that this will turn into a zombiefest, which is still under the guise that ""on the day that hell's gate opens, the dead will rise."" The whole story feels more like H.P. Lovecraft, and over all the basic plot is fine; but the details lack continuity (guns, co-workers, tarantulas, etc).

The more I read about Fulci, the more I come to the conclusion that he only made horror films to keep his career afloat because of the popularity of the gore market in the late 70's and early 80's. Whereas a director like Dario Argento seems to really love the fantasy genre, and his passion is evident there on the screen, there is a certain contrived atmosphere about Fulci's horror films which suggest that he could really be working in any genre, he just adds or embellishes the required trimmings that he thinks fit what the fans want - without which all his films would probably be pretty similar. The trimmings I am referring to in his horror movies are, of course, the gore scenes, and ""The Beyond"" has these in abundance.

The story concerns a young woman called Liza (Katherine MaColl) who has inherited an old hotel which appears to be cursed following the murder of a heretic there many years ago. Many strange and gruesome events happen to her and people around her, culminating in the revelation that the hotel is built on an actual ""gateway to hell"". Now, on the plus side, Fulci manages to strike up some convincing gothic atmosphere with lots of fog, some austere landscape scenery and plenty of enigmatic characters (like the blind girl, Emily). Then, while Liza is uncovering the mystery surrounding the hotel, many of the supporting characters start to die in various gruesome ways, and it's soon clear that Fulci is aiming this film squarely at the gore market. The fact that the gore scenes go on for so long indicates that Fulci considers that more is definitely more as far as violence goes. One character has their head pushed onto a long nail after a ridiculously drawn out struggle, which exits out the front with their eyeball perched improbably on the end if it, while another gets their throat torn out by a dog, which makes a long bloody mess of it, only to return while the character lies dying to have a go at ripping off an ear as well for extra points. The most absurd shock sequence of all has to be the one set in a hospital morgue. With no real reason or relation to any of the film's storyline, a fallen woman lies prone on the floor while a large jar of acid drips onto her face and eats it away, causing a huge pool of red froth to spread across the floor, backing a terrified onlooker into a corner. Oh no, sorry, even that is topped by a scene in which a guy falls from a stepladder and lies prone on the floor (again!) while a swarm of tarantulas crawl over him and eat his eyes, nose and tongue. I have to say this about Fulci films, the death sequences always require the victim to remain practically motionless while they are slowly mutilated or dismembered. More proof, I think for the arguement that Fulci is too concerned with satisfying the splatter hounds to bother with any kind of realism.

Sadly gore alone can't stop ""The Beyond"" from being ultimately more annoying than entertaining. The reason I say this is that a lot of the parts of the plot in the movie just don't make sense, and the overall impression left is the Fulci really doesn't care. He gets the required atmosphere and visual impact, so as far as he is concerned, it's a job done. How much more impressive this movie would be if all the wildly unresolved plot strands got knitted together along the way, but they don't, and it's for this reason that a lot of horror fans are turned off by the waves of illogicalities present throughout the proceedings. When Fulci's first splatter epic ""Zombie Flesh Eaters"" was unleashed on the public, it generated real excitement with its extreme violence, but it also had some great cinematography, plus something close to pacing and a plot that went in one clear direction. This film confuses and loses the audience several times before its conclusion, a problem also shared by ""The House by the Cemetery"" (which throws red herrings everywhere and then either drops or blatantly contradicts them later on), and ""City of the Living Dead"" (which has no coherent rhyme or reason whatsover).

In conclusion, ""The Beyond"" can be beautiful to look at in places, such as the scenes with Emily, and the claustrophobic ending, and it also has masses of gore, some of which is quite startling, like a particulalrly graphic shotgun blast in the face for a young girl zombie. But it drapes all it's good effects and atmosphere around a laughably under-developed story. The likeable Katherine MaColl looks as lovely as ever, but she's saddled with a script and plot that left me scratching my head for far too much of the time. A visual success, then - but intellectually this film leads the viewer down nothing but a load of dead ends.",1142985600,,4890,4.618390804597701
1107548,5,6305972079,Another Fulci film that was concieved from intense vision only to be realized as a laughable nightmare. Purge yourself of Hollywood conceptions and embrace this film for what can only be achieved in this genre.,1140480000,,210,5.0285714285714285
1107549,2,6305972079,"The hype surrounding this movie is undeserved.

Firstly, you will find it hard to believe that The Beyond dates from just 1981, as it feels like an amateurish effort from at least a decade earlier. The picture quality, even though allegedly ""remastered"", is poor and glitchy, as is the crudely dubbed sound. The standard of acting varies from mediocre to cringingly embarrassing, and the score sounds like something from a cheesy 1970's soft-porn movie.  Then it is, of course, hugely derivative, owing a great deal to the Romero classics.

Whereas Romero had the genius to inject huge dollops of subtle irony and black humour into his movies though, Fulci takes it all far too seriously. His heavy-handed and unsubtle direction results in an irritatingly fragmented stop-start plot,  containing more holes than a zombie's string vest. How one mouldering cadaver is somehow transported from the morgue to a bath full of filthy water is never explained, and some of the shenanigans with versions of the cursed book are just plain baffling.

The gore is undoubtedly gruesome. Fulci is, admittedly,  quite an expert at the old dissolving face routine but, when analysed, it is really little worse than when the Nazi guy gets his comeuppance at the end of Indiana Jones!  Flesh being ripped by chains, demonically-possessed dogs or tarantulas is quite nasty, but certainly no worse than say the extended flogging scene in The Passion of the Christ.  The old popping eyeball gag works much better in The Evil Dead too!

Above all, what this film lacks is any panache or style, with its unsatisfyingly flimsy plot merely used to string together a series of gory set pieces.  There is no tension and no genuine shocks.  And that does not a good horror movie make! Any of the Romero movies or even the stylish campness of the Abominable Doctor Phibes movies is infinitely more satisfying than this.

If, as is claimed on the box, this is Fulci's best movie, the others he churned out must be unbelievably bad.

All in all, a huge disappointment.  Off to the local DVD exchange with this one!",1130457600,,2083,4.880681818181818
1107550,4,6305972079,"THE BEYOND is the best, or one of the best, Fulci efforts. This guy really likes his movies about zombies. We have ZOMBI 2; we have CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD; and now, we have THE BEYOND. Fulci really went all out for gore on this one. One of the best elements of the movie are the two leads who actually are much better than leads in his other movies (although CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD came close with Catriona MacColl). David Warbeck and MacColl really play their roles with vigor, and thanks to the mostly very suspenseful moments, it is obvious that they won't meet a grim end (but it won't be roses either).  Sarah Keller also played great acting as the blind mystic Emily, and her grim fate was very disturbing. MacColl inherits a New Orleans hotel, which supposedly is one of the seven gateways to hell. The beginning of the film features one horrific beating of a supposed satanic artist who is melted away by acid, and the scene is just gruesome. After the man in the basement (waterboy if you will) tears down a wall and then his eyeballs are gouged, it's anybody can go at that point and the mayhem begins (is Fulci obsessed with gouging eyes out or what?). This ultimately sets off a series of gruesome events as zombies start to spring up everywhere, and now Warbeck and MacColl must fend off the flesh-eaters in order to survive. It was sad to see Emily get torn to pieces by her own dog after he socked the rest of the zombies in the scene where she gets surrounded by them. I guess maybe dogs are not man's best friend? The scene where the little girl gets her head blown off was just gruesome, just absolutely gruesome. You gore aficiandos will be very satisfied with THE BEYOND. You horror buffs with either like it or hate it, but THE BEYOND is a strong horror film that benefits from suspense, scares, and mucho gore. Fulci sure likes his violence juicy. That scene where the guy gets attacked by tarantulas was gross. The semi-downbeat ending featured our leads finding what must be ""the beyond"" and ultimately they, much like Emily, turn to blind people and the look on their faces are of pure terror. I was just a little let down by the ending, but still you can't go wrong...this is a good, good horror movie.

Fulci sadly died of a diabetes related illness sometime in the 80s, and his legacy in the Italian horror genre is most assured by his movies. He has an eye for all-out, gross-out gore and some nauseating special effects. He also has some grip on suspense in most of his films, and the terror is real. If you want satisfying Italian horror, you can't go wrong looking 'BEYOND'.",1129766400,,2608,4.465408805031447
1107611,2,6305972079,"Things I learned from this movie
- There is an infinite number of ways to gouge a person's eye out.  You can impale their skull on a conveniently long wall nail which will push the eye out of the socket.  Skeletal talons on the hands of the Undead are good for hooking and pulling out eyeballs.
- Gouging out a living eye makes the same slurpy sound as sucking on a straw in a cup mainly full of ice.
- If you gaze on the Place of the Undead your eyes turn into blind, pearly-green eggshells and resemble painful looking contact lenses.
- One of the Seven Gates of Hell is located in the basement of an old and deserted hotel in New Orleans.  A Lord of the Undead used to live in room 36.
- If you're a good guy and fall on your back in a deeds office - fall hard enough to paralyze yourself - a herd of furry legged tarantulas will crawl out from under the door to investigate.
- Tarantulas move faster than the plot of an Italian horror movie.
- Tarantulas like to eat the tongues, lips, noses, and, of course, eyes of living humans.  While eating, tarantulas make a slurpy sound like a straw in a cup that is mostly ice.
- When the building is filled with zombies do NOT (bang-bang-click-click) leave your office without an extra gun clip or two.
- Bang bang.  Sometimes empty guns are reloaded by Divine Intervention, or when an Italian director cuts away from and then back to the gun-toting hero.
- You can't take a zombie out with a body shot, so quit trying!  Head shots only!

 Wondering what all the fuss was about I buried Lucio Fulci's THE BEYOND on my rental queue months ago.  If this is a high-point of the genre I won't be putting too many more on anytime soon, although Dario Argento's SUSPIRIA is supposed to be pretty good.  Fulci's THE BEYOND, though, is simply a meandering mess.  I only figured out what was happening after listening to the commentary track with co-stars Catriona MacColl and David Warbeck.  Warbeck, who died of cancer shortly after the commentary track was completed, cracks wise through most of it while MacColl interrupts him a time or two to admire her acting.  The gore is professionally done if not terribly convincing.  Fans of this type of movie, and it has a sizable cult, may get a kick out of this gorefest.  The rest of us will have to remain bored and a tad baffled by all the fuss.",1125705600,,2335,4.347926267281106

I am the latter person when it comes to films of this caliber. There is nothing scary about shambling, poorly made up zombies, fake spiders or dog puppets that bite. There is some humor, although unintentional, in this film. I especially like the heroes handgun which disintegrates a young zombie girls head, yet only seems to splat red dye onto the other zombies. It is as if the director was working on a tight FX budget. Realistic effects are few,only two scenes that come to mind, but effective. The beginning was creepy enough to gain my attention, but I was sorry I paid for this DVD as soon as I saw those fake spiders. The funny thing is that the director lets the gore scenes linger, a technique which might be effective if the FX were not so cheap. The story itself was creepy enough to have worked well without the much hyped gore, which was over emphasized enough to take away from the story. Hell, on the DVD case all of the prominent gore/shock scenes are pictured. Save your money.",1117670400,,1172,4.481308411214953
1107616,4,6305972079,"First of all if your looking for an intriguing plot, great dialogue, oscar worthy acting and a fantastic soundtrack you need look elsewhere as this movie delivers none of the above. However, if you love the gory,cheesy Italian Zombie movies from the 70's and 80's then this is definitely for you.

Released in The States as ""Seven Doors of Death"" many consider Lucio Fulci's ""The Beyond"" to be his masterpiece. As in most of his works, this film deals with zombies, the depths of hell, magical books, and brims with abundant GORE. You can also expect the typical bad acting and weak script but any fan of Fulci expects this going in.

""The Beyond"" is perhaps Fulci's most atmospheric horror film. The cellar of an old Louisiana hotel is built on top of the door to the beyond, where zombies and nightmarish images unleash terror. Perhaps the goriest of his films, including scenes of acid melting a woman's face, tarantula's eating off half of a man's face, an incredible head shot that blows half a zombie's face off and of course his signature eyeball gag.

While ""The Beyond"" is not my personal favorite of the signature Fulci movies it is one of his better efforts and fans of Fulci and cheesy Italian Zombie movies in general should be happy with the brutal gore splattered throughout. Worth an evening!",1115683200,,1308,4.728070175438597

1107684,4,6305972079,"I've only seen 2 Fulci movies other than this (Zombie and City of the Living Dead), and this is by far the best of them. (Though they're all worth seeing)  Yeah, it's pretty derivative, taking notes from Suspiria, Inferno and The Sentinel in particular, but most movies are so who gives a damn.  The acting isn't so hot, though perhaps not particularly bad for the genre, the plot often incoherent and the dialogue is either stilited or laughable most of the time. (Though I believe the ""You have carte blanche but not a blank check"" line was actually meant as a joke, but you never can tell) And, once again, I say, who gives a damn.  If you make your Italian horror movie right all of the aforementioned portions of the film will be given an absolute minimum amount of screen time possible to make way for more zombies, spewing blood, creepy locales, cool synth music and all those other things that make this sorta film great.  If that's what your looking for there's no reason not to pick this up.  If you don't like this sorta film in general this isn't at all likely to convert you.

This film is a quasi-sequel to City of the Living Dead, in that it involves the opening of a gate to hell, this time located underneath a hotel in Louisiana, resulting in supernatural goings ons and the presence of phantasmic zombie-ghosts and conventional zombies. This fulfills all the absolute necessities of a horror film plot: It allows plenty of opportunities for death and horror. (And it gets bonus points for including zombies)  And yeah, there are some particularly stupid things related to the plot, such as why the doctor insisted on attaching a EEG machine(maybe that's the wrong name, I forget) to a corpse which is essentially fossilized, and why some people with the icky cataracts are evil for no apparent reason while other are good, and why the stupid doctor never seems to figure out that he needs to shoot the zombies in the head, and why there is a sign that says ""Do Not Entry"".  But none of that really ought to matter, if your interested in the rest of the film.  Other than a few things  this is all actually fairly slick and professional, far more so than many Fulci critics would have you believe.

There is essentially no character development, but I think the main protagonists are kinda likable. Also, Veronica Lazar is quite creepy, though it's hard to say why, either from a practical or plot standpoint. (And Catriona MacColl is kinda hot. Wooo! And she gives one of the better performances, I suppose.)  Still, to call the acting good is a stretch, but is more than sufficiently competent for the material.

I would dare say that the biggest flaw in this movie is that there is a bit too much gore.  I'm not opposed to the gore in and of itself, but I think it is so prominent that it really throws the pace off some of the time and detracts from the excellent atmosphere.  That, and drawing out a gore-scene too long makes it less effective, not more, as it becomes easier to pick out the problems, and you just kinda get used to it after a few seconds.(Gore Spoilers ahead)  This is most problematic during the spider scene, which I think is slightly disturbing at a few moments, but goes on forever and is mostly just either silly or boring as hell.  The head-melting with acid is also quite weak and boring.  These two scenes should've been cut, in my opinion  Most of the rest of the gore is at least pretty good, if not exactly convincing.  The chain-whipping/crucifixon/quick-lime melting at the beginning is pretty effective, and quite painful to watch much of the time.(Though the sliding zooms into the chain-wounds are quite annoying, and it is a lil bit to drawn out).  The, eye-poked with the nail  is perhaps the best effect, and it wisely shown only very briefly.  The throat-ripping is comically over the top by the end, but is effective in it's way.  And there's the famed magnum-head-explosion, which is quite nice.

Still, I think the atmosphere and style are the better part of the film.  The ""sepia-tinged""(brownified) opening is quite intense, despite some overacting, and sets the mood very well.  Fulci's love of shooting closeups of people's eyes is pretty effective too, I think, so long as he doesn't over do it, and the misty green cataracts that are in some character's are creepty and gross.  The score is quite cool as well, and not as massively Goblin-derived as some of Frizzi's other stuff.(though it is still influenced by them, for sure) It's fairly low-key most of the time, with some particularly effective use of synth-choirs.(Perhaps influenced by Emeron's score for Inferno.) The zombie-filled ending is really cool too, with some very nice-looking and particularly lethargic zombies.(Though some of them are a little bitt too lumpy, I think)  There's a particularly great shot of a pack of zombies standing at the end of a hallway, with a mysterious blue light behind them.  It's oddly majestic, I think.(You may think I'm joking: I'm not)  The best scene would have to be when seeing-eye dog lady is surrounded by ghost-zombies in the hotel lobby.  It's perfectly lit and shot, goes on just long enough.

The Anchor Bay DVD looks absolutely great, as usual, and the commentary is pretty amusing. This movie pretty much rules, if you like this sorta thing.  I suspect that the extremely informal nature of this review may make it look like I think this is a good-bad or so-bad-it's-good movie.  This isn't the case. This movement has a number of flaws, for sure, but the positives far outweigh them, and this is definitely a good film by horror film standards.",1100563200,,5627,4.6955193482688395

1107687,5,6305972079,"Like chianti, ouzo, and foie gras and monkey brains, Lucio Fulci is an acquired taste, certainly not for everyone. Like the other Italian Grand Masters of Giallo and Splatter horror, Lamberto Bava and Dario Argento, Fulci is a consummate stylist, an artiste of atrocity, a master of mutilation, capable of seeing the beauty in the cinematic popped eyeball or the fake freshet of arterial spray---and as such, not everyone gets him. Judge from the reviews here alone: people either love Italian giallo horror or they despise it---and those with really weak stomachs rarely stay around to be sure.

That said, if you're willing to drop your pre-conceived notions about what a horror film should be---and if you accept that for Fulci's splatter masterpiece you're just going to have to disconnect some of your critical faculties (just as Fulci holds plot, character development, dialogue and editing in abeyance)---then you're going to be treated to a sumptuous, brutal, occasionally shocking and highly Gothic treat. ""The Beyond"" is an ensanguined festival of blood, bile, brains, gore, and New Orleans swamp horror, all beautifully filmed and served with a heaping, steaming platter of full-bore horror and genuinely creepy atmosphere. Did I mention Chef Fulci lays on slathers of the red sauce with his steak tar-tar?

Again, the plot here isn't important. In 1927, an accused sorcerer is brutally tortured and slaughtered in the basement of a New Orleans hotel. Nearly six decades later, a woman (who bears a striking resemblance to the proprietress of the old hotel) buys the place, and begins to renovate it.

Unfortunately for her, the property sits atop one of the Seven Gates to Hell, and what a time for her to dispatch a plumber to help her with the flooded basement! Naturally, the liche-sorcerer's zombie gets loose, pokes the plumber's eyes out (a Fulci specialty!), and things get out of hand. What more could a horror-hound want, you ask? Plenty, and Lucio Fulci delivers, offering up double-servings of:

*Nasty, sneaky, goopy mutilated zombies, all appearing at the worst possible moment and specializing in popping their victim's eyeballs out---slowly!

*A creepy blind woman whose 'blindness'(which looks like a bad case of cataracts) could be a trap for our heroine---and that's not even counting her bone chomping seeing-eye dog! Fetch, Fido!

*Lip eating, eyelid-biting giant tarantulas in the public library!

*Brains, blood, bile, and goop, goop, and more goop!

*A mysterious painting that lures its victims into a hellish netherworld!

*the nastiest, creepy-crawly morgue scene ever filmed, guaranteed to make you say ""Ick!""!

*Best of all, eye gouging galore by the Master of Movie Eye Gouging!

Full disclosure: You might have to give ""The Beyond"" more than one look to really appreciate it---and it's best to have high quality equipment to view it on, as this is a lushly produced DVD with a gorgeous transfer and 5.1 sound (it's also got some jolly extras on it, including a music video by Necrophagia called ""And You will Live in Fear""). Some bourbon on the rocks doesn't hurt, either. I had heard so much about Fulci and 'The Beyond', and I must confess that I was initially mystified at all the hype: the director has awful pacing, sequences occur seemingly without any relation to the rest of the movie, the acting is atrocious, and Fulci lets the camera linger on his splatter scenes far too long, undermining their shock.

But I gave ""The Beyond"" a second chance, and I'm glad I did. The movie is genuinely unsettling, beautiful to behold, and the gore scenes are almost sensual in their bloody beauty. And for my money, the zombies in the climactic morgue scene are some of the nastiest and most terrifying ever put to celluloid.

If you love splatter cinema and want to get a look at an Italian maestro at the top of his game---and you're willing to shut off a few critical blinders---then you'll find ""The Beyond"" a fine witches' brew, indeed. Bon appetit!",1097712000,,3993,5.013595166163142
1107688,2,6305972079,"I seriously tried to like this movie. I saw it at the drive-in when it was first released to the states. I did not like it at that time. I had since read several reviews and comments acclaiming it to be one of Fulci's best, others claiming it to be his best work. This was when Anchor Bay released a so-called restored copy. So, I figured that perhaps it was the editing and I was wrong and should give it a second chance, and thus bought a copy. Now I have seen a movie I did not like twice and own a copy of it. 'The Beyond' as a movie concentrates on the look of the film with very little attention paid to story development. Its style is deliberate (as Fulci's style was) but slow. Since the story is disjointed, so is the pacing. The special effects are mostly very good as you would expect from Giannetto de Rossi, the dog attack and the pipe cleaner tarantulas are exceptions. The tarantula scene and the bathtub scene with Joe the plumber among others beg for a coherent explanation. Scenes in this movie are just that: scenes for the sake of how they look with little or no attention given to how they fit with the rest of the picture. This movie as a whole is frankly ambiguous giving way to the viewer to draw their own conclusions to complete the story; rather like a paint-by-numbers on film, you fill in the blanks. This approach may work for some but it did not work for me.-Bob",1097625600,,1393,4.28030303030303

1107780,5,6305972079,"This movie is probably a benchmark for budget horror movies and compared to some of Fulci's other efforts this seems dramatically more focussed and complete.  It is also a zombie movie that will no doubt appeal to zombie fans.  For a low budget horror flick, this contains a number of classic scenes. The blind girl on the bridge, the bodies in the freezer, the plumber's demise and then his return, the comical spiders scene, the opening scene.. the list goes on.  There is plenty of tension created as well with a suitably evil sounding sound track.  Whilst many horror scenes flash the gore in front of your face for an instant and then quickly take it away (presumably so you will not notice the poor special effects), the Beyond draws the gore scenes out for seemingly minutes at a time.  The plot is somewhat vague, but there are no dull moments as we move from one scene to another.  Overall, wether you choose to laugh at the film, appreciate its finer points, or get scared or disgusted by it, this rates as a classic horror movie and will appeal to collectors.",1092355200,,1070,4.575916230366492

I ordered it from some cheap video company that was offering uncut horror movies from other countries. For my money Lucio Fulci made 4 great horror films-Zombie,Gates of Hell, House by the Cemetary, and this, his ultimate, The Beyond. I never dreamed something like this would ever come out on DVD, especially with the special edition treatment this got. The picture and sound are awesome. This is the kind of movie that is so great for pissing off your girlfriend (or wife.) This is one of my favorite horror films of all time and I didn't even see this until about 1995! With the new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack this now has, its almost as much fun to crank up as Suspiria (the greatest horror film of them all.) I can't say enough great things about the presentation on this DVD.",1091232000,,865,4.515923566878981

The camera and the director breathe in and revel in every shot, their attention is totally unwavering and they have an eye for the beauty in the scenes, actors, and in the horror as well. Frankly, I couldn't take my eyes off it if I tried, it demands your attention.
 Find me any film let alone a horror film from 1983 that looks so crystal clear, so well framed, and so well filmed, its impossible. This film is timeless in that respect, if you told someone this was a 1980's period piece that was filmed in the late 1990's they'd believe you.
 Like all Italian horror of the time, the emphasis wasn't put on the script, which is being generous to some of the scenes.
 The visuals rule the day though and win out, the quality of all these elements puts you in a forgiving mood for the lesser qualities of the film.

1107783,3,6305972079,"Ok, it is obvious that the majority of Italian horror fans feel that character developement, good story, and most importantly, good acting are not iportant factors when creating a horror movie. This film is considered by many Italian Horror films to be one of the best, if not the best Italian horror movie ever shot. Though the story isn't to bad, the acting and the character developement are NO WHERE to be found! There are TONS of scenes where you the victum had seconds if not minutes to escape some slowly approaching zombies or what ever, but rather decided to screw around until they were killed, transformed or what ever. It's almost as if Lucio did this on purpose so that he could squeeze an extra long gore sceen into the picture. Like where the young girl walks in to see her mom collapsed on the floor, with her face being slowly eaten away by acid...
...you would think she'd run away, but rather, she decides to make her self at home. I can NOT stand idiotic moments in horror films like that.
On a good note, the gore in this movie is AWSOME for the most part. There are a few sceens that could use some serious work, but for the most part, most scenes turn out great!
It is too bad for Lucio, his films were definatly visually disturbing, and at times almost creepy, if it were not for the comlpletely un-creepy sound tracks, horrible acting, and over abundance of moments where the victum could have escaped, but chose not to apparently.
Your better off with Zombie, or Zombie Hell House, two of his other films that are still imperfect, are MUCH better than this over rated piece of crap...

If you're sick to death of narcoleptic commentaries by tedious filmmakers describing camera set-ups or Hollywood stars blowing smoke up each other's arses, this is the commentary for you. Fresh from a boozy lunch, Mr Warbeck and Ms MacColl affectionately recall the horrors of working in the Italian film industry, (...) about their co-stars and create an extraordinary portrait of director Lucio Fulci all the while name-dropping furiously and trying to outdo each other in admiring their own performances. Warbeck is especially endearing as he reels off a string of off-colour jokes at the film's expense and MacColl is very entertaining particularly when her ladylike reserve is upset during the gore scenes which she obviously has trouble watching. All of this is delivered by two chums clearly delighted to be sitting down together having a good old chat after all this time. It's DVD commentary as it should be: entertaining.

Liza hires Joe the plumber to fix a leak in the basement that is now more like a small lake. Joe finds the source of the leak, tears down a wall, and gets his eyes popped out by an extremely gross-looking Sweik zombie! One day, Liza almost runs over a beautiful blind woman and her dog.

and you ask:
Zombie: how did the zombies make it to the main land?
well if you knew anything about zombies you could figure out that there could be two explanations.

#1. the zombie that is found on the sailboat at the start of the film is only shot in the torso (not fatal for a zombie) and falls into the ocean. as we learn later in the film, zombies can function underwater. maybe this zombie walked along the bottom of the ocean and up onto land. although this would be a difficult task for a zombie, it is still a possibility.
#2. a police officer was bitten by a one of the zombies on the sailboat. the last we see of him, he is on the autopsy table. he more than likely became re-animated and attacked the two doctors performing the autopsy! duh!",1082419200,,811,4.266233766233766
1107788,4,6305972079,"Although The Beyond was nowhere near as well done as Fulci's horror masterpiece Zombie, with its vague plot intermixed with some grossly cheesy scenes, (the blonde blind girl, whom I assume was a ghost, playing that creepy tune on the piano whenever the main character had an epiphany, and the literal tearing apart of the face of a man by a gang of tarantulas, although well executed with much pus and blood, was a bit difficult to suspend my disbelief for)it was still highly enjoyable to watch, if only for the gore. And gore there was. Punctured eyeballs, nails driven through the back of skulls, crucified artists with deliciously large amounts of blood squirting from hammered wrists, a blood drenched, face mutilating, blood gushing mauling by a german shepard,stigmata,bullets from a revolver being blasted through the foreheads of bloodthirsting zombies,acid turning faces into bubbling bloody liquid, and more punctured eyeballs made for a gorehound holiday. In fact, this movie should be watched if only for the classic scene in which a little girl gets the entire top of her skull blown entirely off, creating one of the most shocking and expertly simulated deaths in the history of horror cinema. Yes, that vision will be with me for quite a long time.
If you are a horror fan of the likes which stand disgusted before the cinematic sycophantic Blockbuster jokes risibly attempting to pass themselves off as ""horror,"" that has been vomited out by Hollywood in this modern day of artistic degeneracy, then you will no doubt appreciate the uncensored, boundary breaking audacity of Lucio Fulci's ""piece de resistance.""",1081814400,,1629,5.082089552238806

In the 50's 60's Fulci directed(or writed)a lot of Comedies,but in the 70's he took to us 'The Lizard in The Woman's Skin"",and ""Dont Turture the Duckling"" that are thrillers if i know right. The people of Italy liked the style of Fulci and they liked Dawn of the dead too,so Fulci made a sequel titled as Zombie(AKA Zombie 2 in Italy),thats a big success again. Fulci made other horror movies like:Manhattan Baby and The Gates of Hell(City of the living dead),and Beyond.
In Beyond,Fulci made new heights on the ""apocalypse feeling"".

There's some guy that gets whipped and gets acid thrown at him; apainter that falls off a ladder; a plumber that gets his eye popped out by a mysterious hand from nowhere; a dog that bites a blind lady (she was a ghost or something) in the neck, creating a waterfall of blood; a guy that gets his face eaten by fake looking yet cool spiders; acid pooring on some guy's face and changing colors. Then there's the final zombie takeover where a couple heads get blown off. This is Fulci's most epic accomplishment because of the creepy atmosphere and graphic violence. Any true horror fan probably has seen this or atleast knows about this film. Don't try to hard to understand the story because there really is no substance to the film. You might get bored if you try and sit through the whoel story, paying attention to every muttered word. Just mindless creative violence that makes good eye candy is what you get.

Any ways, it can't possibly be that good of a movie if its cut and edited ""Beyond"" incoherency and released under a different title. If you want zombie movies with plot, watch and play Resident Evil, if you want zombie movies because of zombies, thats definitely Romero's ""Holy Trilogy"". thats zombie movies with human behavior and the ""what if"" or ""what would you do?"" theme.

Feluci movies should be more like Baseball, Feluci is the starting pitcher and someone else should close the game/end the movie. His films are like most Japanese horror films, great endings that make no sense:

Zombie: how did the zombies make it to the main land?

City of the dead: what did they see? who cares

Zombie 3: did you even make it to the end of that movie?

the Beyond: I've erased that movie from my memory as i did with house by the cemetery

1107912,4,6305972079,"No figure in the horror film genre is as divisive as Lucio Fulci. After watching one or two of his films, viewers tend to move into one of two camps. One side hails Fulci as a master of terror, a man who upped the gore quotient in his films while creating wonderfully atmospheric pictures. For these people, Fulci is right up there with the likes of Dario Argento as one of the best filmmakers ever to emerge from Italy. The other camp sneers at these claims, pointing to the plodding pace of his films, the use of extreme gore to camouflage plot holes, and the director's inability to draw good performances out of his cast as evidence of mediocrity. Initially, I enjoyed Fulci's films, specifically ""Zombie,"" ""City of the Living Dead,"" and ""The New York Ripper"" because I did not know any better. When I came on the scene, you went to Fulci to feed your craving for gore. What a difference a few years exploring the genre makes! While I will not go so far as to remove Lucio from my play list altogether, I have seen enough of his films to realize he is not a cinematic genius. He is at best a competent director, at worst an abysmal one, and there are plenty of examples of bad filmmaking in this director's filmography. Fortunately, ""The Beyond"" ranks as one of Fulci's better efforts.
The film opens in 1927 New Orleans at the Seven Doors Inn located out in some bayou. Strange things have been going on in this rickety looking motel, and the local townspeople plan to do something about it. A painter in room 36, as it turns out, found a key to one of the seven doorways to the underworld and has since made paintings of what he found inside the gateway. While a young girl reads about the pathways to Hades in the Book of Eibon, a lynch mob bursts through the door of the painter's room and promptly carries out a grisly execution using chains and what appears to be quicklime. The mob leaves the painter nailed to a wall in a basement as Fulci treats the viewer to a new definition of the term ""pudding head"" (watch and see). Meanwhile, the young lady reading the book goes blind when the tome explodes into flame. Confused yet? That's a perfectly acceptable condition to find yourself in during a Fulci film. Don't worry, understanding will come to you soon enough. Even if it doesn't, don't fret too much. This is Fulci, man! Lighten up!
Flash forward to 1981. Liza (Catriona MacColl) inherits the run down Seven Doors Inn from her rich uncle. Deciding to abandon life in New York City, Liza heads into the swamp to fix and reopen the motel. Almost immediately problems emerge of a most sinister nature. One of the workmen falls of a scaffold and seriously injures himself. A plumber looking for a way to fix the water filled basement dies horribly when he uncovers a nasty little secret tucked away in one of the walls. Things become so touchy at the inn that local doctor/forensic pathologist John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives on the scene to investigate. The good doctor becomes intrigued when Liza tells him she has met and talked with three people who really shouldn't be living anymore. The most important of these people is Emily, the aforementioned blind girl who pops up occasionally to warn the new inn owner about the dangers emanating from room 36. According to Emily, the painter who died painfully in that room--he didn't; he died in the basement but Fulci's script fails to remember this fact--has now returned to the world of the living. In fact, soon all of the dead shall walk the earth because the gate to hell is now open. And hey! Emily is right. The dead arise and attack the living in glorious Technicolor. McCabe and Liza attempt to escape the wrath of these zombies and discover what is going on at the inn. How does one close a pathway to the underworld? Watch and see.
I generally liked ""The Beyond"" and consider it one of Fulci's better efforts although it is not as good as ""Zombie."" This movie primarily serves as a vehicle for various gore effects. You get faces covered in acid, a messy tracheotomy and severed ear incident, nails hammered through wrists and heads, bullets to numerous foreheads, and a nasty looking spider attack that is sure to turn a few stomachs. The real capper consists of three separate eye sequences, particularly notable since many consider Fulci the king of eyeball violence. I don't think these scenes hold a candle to the memorable splinter rendezvous in ""Zombie,"" but to each his own. The gore works better than the acting (wooden) or the pacing (better but still slow). I got a few unintentional laughs out of McCabe's shootouts with the shambling zombies. Even I realized immediately that shooting the creatures in the head polishes them off, but McCabe wastes a lot of ammo plugging bullets into stomachs and chests to little effect. I did, however, enjoy watching the actress who plays the blind Emily; she's a real cutie who steals a bit of thunder from Catriona MacColl's Liza character.
""The Beyond"" DVD bursts at the seams with extras. You get a commentary with MacColl and Warbeck, colorized versions of the opening sequence, trailers, stills, interviews with Fulci, a short interview with MacColl and Warbeck, a lame video from some thrash/death metal band, and a nice widescreen format for the movie. Trying to read meaning into a Lucio Fulci film is an exercise in futility practiced mostly by people who spend their entire waking hours watching Lucio Fulci films. ""The Beyond"" is a gorefest, plain and simple, and viewers should enjoy it as such.",1073088000,,5533,4.670081967213115
1107913,5,6305972079,"Fulci's The Beyond is probably the most beautiful gore movie ever made. The film simply looks astonishing especially this DVD transfer. You will not see a better looking horror film than The Beyond. With that said The Beyond has a terrible premise and an awful plot to boot that does not make sense. The story is about a woman who buys a hotel that looks like something out of hell and ends up being just that. The basement is flooded to such a degree that shots done down there just might as well have been filmed in Venice. The house has a history of an old sorcerer who fell on the wrong side of the locals in a Dr. Frankenstein sort of way and who continues to haunt the hotel. A doctor shows up to help the woman come to terms with a strange number of deaths that have taken place in the hotel. There are several eye ripping/popping scenes that all stand out as classic scenes in cinema. The doctor here will have you laughing, mostly unintentionally, when he deems the cause of death of a number of eyeball ripped victims as ""accidental"". Later on in the movie he pulls a gun from his own GPs desk and starts to shoot some zombies only to run out of bullets and then suddenly begins shooting again. He also shoots out a door across the room and manages to kill someone in a very unbelievable way that will have you scratching your head. A young redhead girl defines the term ""redhead"" in one of the most shocking scenes of them all. A number of spiders eat a guy to pieces, a mom has her face covered in acid and a blind woman runs out of a house at top speed with her guide dog running after her. The film is inadvertently side-splitting because of all the crazy bad plots and their bungling execution by Fulci but this all adds up to make it a classic horror movie. If you have not seen The Beyond then you should, not matter what anyone else tells you. The ending is fantastic, not because it makes any sense, but because it is the best cinematic rendition of hell that you will ever see. The cinematography blasts away most of what Hollywood has to offer and the set-design is A+. The look of this film is outstanding for the genre and is nothing short of a modern cinematic masterpiece apart from some visual effects problems along the way (however this was made in 1983 and so all can be forgiven there). Twenty years later The Beyond looks better than most mainstream horror movies and in the opinion of this reviewer it is the best looking horror film ever made. In short there is enough dazzling cinematic material here to even get mainstream non-horror moviegoers to take a look, even if they are squeamish.
The Beyond is vastly superior to another movie by Fulci called ""The House by the Cemetery"" which came out a few months after this one and is almost identical in terms of story. If you have a choice between the two then this is one to get by a long shot. The Beyond is also one of Fulci's best movies and many fans of that director will list this as the ""numero uno"" horror film of all time. It is hard not to see why horror fans worship The Beyond.
***When first released The Beyond was heavily cut before receiving the classic X rating. It received further cuts for its video release. The Beyond is also known by the title ""7 Doors of Death"" but avoid this version of the film like the plague as it is generally heavily cut. Eighteen seconds where cut from the start of the film featuring a man getting whipped by chains. There was also cuts made to this same crucifixion scene and the acid to the face scene was also cut heavily. The eye-popping plumber scene was cut, the spider attack scene was cut, the cleaning lady death scene was cut, the dog attack scene was cut and the redhead scene was cut. In total 1 minute and 39 seconds where cut from the original release of this movie which is quite a lot of cutting.

1107914,5,6305972079,"""The Beyond"" is a gory film about the gateway to hell residing in the basement of a Louisana hotel. Thats really all the plot synopsis you are going to need. While there is some depth and development to be sure(far more than some of Fulci's other pictures) the plot is almost consequential to the gore effects on the screen. Italian horror is one of my favorite genres and to be honest there are certain expectations that one should have before watching this film or any other Italian horror film.
A. If you don't like horror films... Don't buy this, don't rent it find something else to watch.
B. If you like horror films but don't like gore... Keep looking this is not the movie for you.
C. If you like horror films and a friend recommended this to you...try to remember whether you have anything in common with said friend after all we wouldn't want you questioning his ""inteligency""
D. If you have never watched a Italian horror film...I urge you RENT THIS FIRST, don't buy it or any other Italian horror film. I know people that love Freddy, Jason, and even Romero's dead trilogy but can't stand Italian horror.
E. If you like horror, gore, have cool friends, and have watched an Italian horror film before...by all means pick this up.
In my opinion only ""Suspiria"" rivals ""The Beyond"" for the best horror film to come out of Italy. Of course, it has bad acting, of course its gory, of course its derivative, because almost all horror films from Italy share these qualities. You either love it or its not for you and it never will be.

Within only minutes (screen time that is) zombies, hungry tarantulas, possessed dogs, and acid (yes, acid) all begin attacking the living - Fulci style, which means, in the most gruesome ways imaginable.

I recently purchased ""The Beyond"" from AMAZON.CA to add to my ever growing horror DVD collection and I must state that I'm extremely glad I did. This is the Fulci film that rightfully deserves its praise and many of his fans have called it his masterpiece. While the so called ""Godfather of Gore"" has a devoted following, his films are indeed an acquired taste, even for those who love horror films. And while many of his films, ""Zombie"", ""City of the Living Dead"", ""The House By the Cemetery"", have their fans, myself included (""City of the Living Dead"" being my least favorite), many mainstream critics have nothing positive to say about any of Fulci's blood-soaked films. This movie may be the exception.

""The Beyond"" is beautifully filmed. The Louisiana setting is lovely; the 2 lead actors (David Warbeck & Catriona MacColl) are very attractive; the make-up effects are gruesome and generally effective and like any other Fulci movie the star is the gore. The gore effects surprised me in this film, especially when taking into consideration the films budget and the time period but it should be stated, the make-up effects are not always successful. At times, the ripping flesh stretches like melted cheese, loosing it's realistic edge but the highlights are many. There are scenes involving face mutilations, eyeball removal, one fantastical scene involving a horde of hungry tarantulas, and several tense scenes involving countless zombies (I just wished these living dead would have moved a bit faster).

If you approach this film wanting realism and logic you will be disappointed. This film, for the most part makes no sense. It's just a whole assortment of strange, super-natural images and the main characters are moved from scene to scene and placed in the most bizarre scenarios imagined. Trying to make sense of this film would be like trying to explain or decipher the many lines and colors of an abstract oil painting. Some films just need to be viewed and enjoyed for what they are and this film is art. It is grotesque art but it's art nonetheless. It is also entertaining and it's nightmarish tone and the tension that permeates the atmosphere gives this film an authentic, surreal aura, and like Argento's ""Suspiria"" (another favorite of mine), this film almost looks like an actual nightmare visualized on film.

""The Beyond"" has entered my top 10 list of favorite horror films. Unlike Fulci's other films that only hardcore B-movie gore-hounds can actually love, ""The Beyond"" stands above them because it qualifies as a well made horror movie (although you really have to suspend your disbelief). From the disturbing sepia-toned prologue to the haunting finale, ""The Beyond"" is an effective horror tale that is beautifully filmed and well acted (if you can get past some of the dubbing) and is gripping from start to finish. It may disturb you the way a good horror movie should but most importantly, it will or should keep you entertained for the full duration of its blood-drenched 90 minutes. Enjoy.",1068249600,,3346,4.991039426523297
1107916,5,6305972079,"The Beyond is the bar by which most of Fulci's movies are measured.  Close to this level you will find City of the Dead, Don't Torture a Duckling and Zombie--all of which have their merits, and as many of the one-star reviewers point out, their shortcomings.  If you have never seen a Fulci movie, understand this:  he's not trying to reach your brain (if you want a thinking man's horror film, go see the Exorcist or the Omen), he's looking to savage your nerves. Forget the story, consider the concept:  a gateway to hell (one of the seven in existence)exists in an old, rundown New Orleans hotel; zombies are crawling out of hell and into our world, and they are doing nasty things to people.  Yes, Fulci is very sadistic sometimes:  in many of his movies, good people are killed for no logical reason and at a shocking moment of the film; the Beyond is no exception.  Consider the man-eating spider scene, and Dicky the dog; there are even two scenes alone where a character gets acid thrown into their face, and Fulci's camera traces every moment of the acidic breakdown!  As always, there is a parable of sorts to his films.  In the Beyond, the hotel and the heroine are a good example of curiosity run amok; there is a great scene where one of the books that has information on the original building scheme of the hotel rewrites itself--almost as an attempt to ward the overly curious main characters away from the fate that awaits them.  I didn't find the acting to be wooden.  Maybe some of the character's actions can be described as implausible, but the actors give it a good go.  Don't be put off because this is an Italian production, believe it, this is one of the greatest modern horror movies ever made from one of the greatest horror directors of his time.  They don't call him the Maestro for nothing!",1067731200,,1819,4.542944785276074
1107917,5,6305972079,"This is my first time writing a review but after watching the beyond i felt compelled to share my views. First of all let me say that i have previously watched two other fulci films, Zombie and The house by the cemetary, and in my opinion the beyond is a great improvement on these films. Zombie had pretty weak gore with no real story and HBTC whilst having a great opening never went any where.
Right, back to the beyond. It is great gory fun. The story was much better than i expected and certainly better than the two aforementioned films. The acting was average but was helped by the good dubbing. I hardly noticed it and my friends didn't even know it was dubbed until i told them. Of course the only reason we all watch fulci films is for the gore. This film will not disappoint. It starts with a great opening scene and from there fulci shows the viewer many ways to kill someone, usually involving the eyes.
Dvd presentation was excellent. Picture quality was very good especially as being a horror film most of its shot in the dark. Sound was even better. The 5.1 mix really impressed me with a good solid front stage and nice use of the surrounds. The extras help to round off the package and for once the trailer doesn't show all the good bits.
I'll leave you with this warning the same warning on the cover: caution some scenes may be too shocking and violent for some viewers! Enjoy.",1063324800,,1397,4.397683397683398

1108008,5,6305972079,"""The acting is terrible"", ""the effects are bad"", ""it doesn't make sense"", tra-la, tra-la.  These remarks are scattered throughout the negative reviews for The Beyond.  These ""critics"" obviously aren't Fulci fans.  Even the most hardcore of Fulci fans will admit to his films being cheesy.  I don't think there's a single person out there that has been scared senseless by a Fulci movie.  I guess there's some out there who really look deep into them, but I tend to like them for their high entertainment value-including the cheese factor which I'll admit is high.  I also admire the guts(no pun intended)Fulci had to make such un-audience friendly, over the top horror.  It's the Fulci fans that'll be creeping around this page reading the reviews, and no amount of negative press is gonna change their minds-we are a fervent bunch.  Besides, we've heard it all before from the legitimate critics.  The Beyond is basically the flipside to City Of The Living Dead.  City dealt with the gates of hell opening in a small town courtesy of a priest's suicide as foretold in(drum role): The Book Of Enoch!  This time, one of the doorways to hell-located on, in, or under a hotel-is opened courtesy of a warlock lynching as foretold in(drum role):  The Book Of Eibon!  The same events are played out in The Beyond as in City: Ghastly apparitions, zombies, insects, random weirdness that doesn't make too much sense.  I hate to sound like all the other reviewers, but it does follow dream logic, as so many Italian horror films do.  Don't put it in logical terms, are your own dreams logical?  Of course not, neither are the events in this film, or the actions of the characters.  Catriona MacColl is back and it's up to her to do something about all this funky stuff that's going on.  David Warbeck is the skeptical doctor who helps her out.  He's also the best actor in the film.  This guy is so cool he can get nine shots out of a revolver.  Yup, there's lots of gore too, but we've all come to expect that from Fulci.  His films without gore aren't half as enjoyable.  This is considered to be his best film.  I guess I can see why, but my heart still belongs to Zombie, probably coz it's the first one I saw when I was a kid.  If you don't already have this in your Fulci collection, shame on you!  If you're curious about Fulci, rent this first if you can find it.  It's an acquired taste and not for everyone.",1059523200,,2408,4.53953488372093

The movie can get a bit boring, and the tarantula scene makes me cringe at it's badness when ever I see those plastic spiders waddle towards their victim. The soundtrack can be so bad that it's good, I personally love it when those funky disco beats come in, but I could see how it can be somewhat laughable. For entertainment I perfer Zombie or House by the Cemetery, but this movie is still very good.

1108011,3,6305972079,"Gee, I don't know, this was kinda depressing.
But seriously now-- I should have known that I've seen enough of these Italian zombie-undead-possession-gore slicks that most never have a real upbeat ending-- usually it's one of the following: a. everybody dies b. everybody dies and the world is taken over by  zombies c. the world is transformed into hell d. the one survivor is killed by their daughter/son/pet, who turned out to be possessed/a zombie or e. any combo of the above. I won't spoil this movie by telling you if it has one of these endings or not, just commenting on this.
I think this movie has more eye gore than any other I've seen. One scene involving man-eating tarantulas (I laughed at first, too) is especially nasty and left my covering my eye protectively. The spiders in question look phony half the time, but it'll still make you sick. Besides eye violence, there's buckets off blood and gore and goo.
I actually thought I'd seen this before. What I had seen was the US hack job 7 Doors of Death which has most of the gruesome scenes edited out. That one made me almost fall asleep, this one definitely kept me awake. I was thinking, some of this looks familiar, but I don't remember it being anywhere near this nasty.
This complete, uncut version is the one you want to see, or don't bother seeing it at all. The movie is set in Louisiana and the sometimes nebulous plot concerns a mansion built on the gateway to hell. In the 1800s some evil guy lived there, but in the pre-credit scene, a bunch of PO'ed villagers broke in and nailed him to a wall and tossed lime or something corrosive all over him. Unfortunately, a couple moves in and eventually all hell breaks loose, including some really nasty, gory, well-lit scenes at a hospital. I won't go into the plot more than that. Some seemingly random characters do just kind of stroll into the plot part way through the movie mainly to be killed horribly, but hey, it didn't seemed contrived and I wasn't complaining.
The film isn't just gore, it does have suspenseful scenes, good cinematography, a very nice creepy atmosphere. I didn't really buy that we were in Louisiana, but hey, who cares. The mansion is very creepy. There's an especially chilling shot of it towards the end, at night, from the outside; though the owners have fled, lights begin to slowly go on in various room and shapes start shambling around.
If you like this kind of thing or are a Fulci fan, I recommend just buying the DVD. It is loaded with extras including commentary, images, poster art, behind the scenes, etc. And don't miss the two easter eggs: In the audio setup menu, highlight the faint symbol under the ear, in the image gallery menu, highlight the symbol in the lower left corner for maybe the bloodiest trailer I've ever seen: Cat in the Brain ((sometimes literally- God, did they leave any of the movie's gore OUT?).
I wouldn't really say I enjoyed or loved this movie, it was so grim and nasty I probably won't watch it again for awhile. But I definitely give it credit, and it's worth a watch.",1056153600,,3065,4.58287795992714

Sure, there are several incredibly well done scenes (the nail-in-the-eyeball gets 5 stars from me), but there are many, many terrible ones. The score was fantastic, the story was great, and the atmosphere was perfect for a classic gorefest.... but something was missing. Fulci had a great thing going with the taratulas... I'm even willing to overlook the visible strings on the puppet spiders... but the scene where Emily had her throat torn out by her dog made me want to cut my credit cards in half.

Anyways, The Beyond starts out well, and ends well, but going the whole way through in between can just get kinda... boring. It takes place in present day, where a woman wants to start a Hotel in some suburban area, she buys, rents,leases, whatever a huge 2 story house, and yes, it has been built over some old mine where a man was tortured,killed, and crucified decades earlier. The Gates of Hell are about to open and no one can stop it (if you've seen ""gates of hell"" you've seen ""the beyond."")
Zombies walk, people are killed along the way, and then it ends. I didn't really like it just because it just wasn't very scary. The funky church/opera type music didn't help at all to tense up the atmosphere, it more or less ruined it (Fulci seems to use this music type in all his films and it never seems to work). The gore was pretty good, but too low budget to produce anything really lifelike or wretched. It was lacking in that department as well.
The extras: well, they too were kinda boring, yea a few trailers that showed the same scenes over and over, nothing special. A public interview with Lucio Fulci himself which I found boring,a nd some still shots.
Overall, the extras are extras, whatever. The movie itself has a ""been there, seen that"" premise and drabby mood all the way through. It starts out well, but towards the end really didn't leave much desired.",1036454400,,1594,4.5190311418685125

1108289,5,6305972079,"I want you to know I'm not a sad gorehound fanboy. I don't think every Fulci film's a great film just because he directed it, and I don't send fan mail to Katriona MacColl. But I've studied cinema and I've seen few films that have affected me in as profound way as The Beyond.
The Beyond is an exercise in cinema in its purest and most artistic form. Fulci uses the mechanics of cinema (lighting, editing, rhythm and texture)to raise the intensity of images and sounds, creating a truly evocative, lyrical quality. The film contains a truly mystical quality. Even in scenes that could have been simply repulsive and gratuitous, like a bottle of acid spilling on a woman's face, the film is magical and wonderful. The process of signification (the images, sounds, etc)raises the images from the potentially prosaic to the mystical. Very few films can match the pure atmosphere that this film possesses. Because of the low budget, there is one very bad scene, when the obviously fake spiders bite a man's face. But this is only 4 minutes of rubbish in an otherwise perfect film.
It's worth noting that recognised classics like CITIZEN KANE have some truly fake scenes (remember the fake background with fake bats, an image stolen from a King Kong sequel). Or what about the pathetic Jar Jar Binks in the awful Phantom Menace, not to mention the fake backgrounds. THE BEYOND is more forgiveable due to the minute budget.
Critics have always trashed this film, because they don't understand it. They ignore poetry when it is applied to genre films (see William Friedkin's marvellous Sorcerer). The thing is, in the horror genre, which is based around extreme feelings and sensations, when the mechanics of cinema are applied to such an extreme subject, the images and textures have to be even more powerful, evocative, extreme and atmospheric. That's why the best Italian horror films are so good, and this is why the genius of Fulci is allowed to flourish in its most unadulterated form.
Another aspect that is often criticised is the bizarre logic that the film possesses. For example, when the protagonists exit the hospital, why do they end up in the hotel cellar, which is located miles away? When a renovator falls off a ladder, why is he devoured by spiders? The answer is obvious if you understand surrealist cinema and the use of the set piece in Italian horror cinema.
First, Surrealists like Bunuel and Dali scripted their films through the process of automatic writing, as ideas from the subconscious were scribbled down and then filmed. Hence the abrupt transitions and illogical phenomenology. The link to the subconscious can be found in The Beyond because it has a true nightmare quality; almost every image in this film feels like an overwhelming, frightening dream.
Secondly, the story takes a back seat to the set pieces in Fulci's films. In Hollywood films, which ususally tell straightforward stories, the set pieces act as a spectacle to momentarily detour the forward motion of a clear narrative. Fulci gives the set piece precedence in his films; the narrative is one nightmarish event after another. These sequences are held together tentatively by small story threads.
Fulci combines poetic cinema, nightmare images, and exquisitely horriffic set pieces to create a film where the image is all important. Fulci wants us to feel this film, to experience the startling images ""without reflection"". We should forget logic and story; The Beyond is an amazing sensory experience. It is a true enigma that favours strangeness over familiarity, poetry over prose and nightmare logic over narrative clarity. Let the jaded critics rave about Citizen Kane, Vertigo and Regle de Jeur. Let them shamefully neglect superior filmmakers like Fulci. But don't follow suit. This is a great dvd for a great film, one of the best ever.",1030579200,,3838,4.961180124223603

1108293,4,6305972079,"This beautiful piece of work is, besides a great visual fest that delights by itself, a metaphor of christianity. If you pay close attention to the beginning, the end, and the nature of the painter, you will recognize the elements of sacrifice, similar to that of Jesus, or Prometeus in Greek mythology, warning and apocalypse. After he is made into a zombie, he is the only one who doesn't attack and kill people, his presence being only some kind of warning of what's going on, just as the prescence of the book in different geographic sites, insistently. The apocalyptic fate of Liza and the physician is a representation of what the experience of the end of all hope would be like, not clearly being individual or for the rest of humanity, or both at the same time, but one of the most creative, multidimensional scenes ever, ever shot. The seven doors of evil (textually, not death as many see) are a transposition of the seven capital sins to the geographic dimension. Overall, this is, for me, a transposition of the christian doctrine in Fulci's view,just like the unfairly underestimated ""Conquest"" is of the encounter of civilizated and barbarian men, both in the search of light and fighting a common enemy, because of the symbology and semiotics that he uses, which are pretty obvious for me. He also tried to synthesize the lovecraftian principle of ""supernatural horror beyond human description "" and shows a great knowledge of the written theory and creative works of the great horror writters: He knows, and he puts those elements in practice. All with a hint of the phantasmagoric atmosphere of the haunted hotel, created somewhat by Stephen King/ Stanley Kubrick, and the handling of the eye expressions, similar to Luis Buuel's ""Un Perro Andaluz"", which justifies the gore (centered in the eye ) and gives it a certain sequence. Too bad some people are too biased and blinded (just like those in the movie) by all the bad stuff being said about this true genius, banning themselves to the chance of this undescriptible, beautiful, and spiritual experience.

The story is simple. In 1927? some creepy warlock is messing around with a painting? and he warns the mob who is about to tear him up that the hotel is sitting on one of the 7 holes of hell.
Well they mess that guy up pretty good including coating him with hotwax. Then the film jumps to 1981 still in Louisiana with the new owner of the hotel fixing it up. Bizarre happenenings begin like the death of plumber Joe and the maid and the dimball butler.

1108297,5,6305972079,"Hello!  This is really quite the film and a fantastique DVD for your collection of Italian horror.  All I need to review here is the DVD quality.
The sound is superb; absolutely superb.  The film will begin quietly and then the thunder will rock you, flash you, and boom your speakers.  Sound is crystal-clear throughout the movie; although in some of the soundtrack music, bass is lacking so it feels more shrill.  Bass is used in sound effects sparingly & effectively, so for added shock value make sure you have a great sound system.  There is sufficient volume for this movie, so I didn't have to set speaker and software volume to maximum.  I understood each spoken word, clearly.
Horror sound effects for grotesque sequences are quite lively and I assume, realistic.  Who would know?
The picture is not as clear as the sound by any means.  In fact, there are two annoying splotches of reflective light at the top of the picture for approx. the first twenty minutes of the film.  I own two separate DVD's (different packaging) of ""The Beyond"", and the dots appear in both.  They are obviously from the film master.  Do not let that make you hesitate to purchase this glorious masterpiece of horror.  I'm not sure where to rank it, but it's definitely one of the finest films ever made.
The beginning of the film has a nice sepia tint effect, but parts of the DVD extras are true colour beginnings in English and German.
Because the sound is so superior, I have bumped this up to 5 stars despite the <slight> picture shortfall.  Only once in a while does a DVD entertain the ears like this one!  ""Suspiria"" and ""Opera"" are two that come to mind.  And in fact, ""Opera"" is the only other DVD (from an older source) that I've rated 5-star based on quality alone.

The Beyond (Lucio Fulci, 1981)

Many hardcore fans of Italian horror cinema consider The Beyond to be Lucio Fulci's best film; more than one will  likely opine, if you ask, that The Beyond is the finest Italian horror film ever made. While that's probably stretching the case more than a little (I still prefer Fulci's raw,  almost unbearably campy Zombie), there's a whole lot to be said for The Beyond as loads of fun. Without doubt, it is one of Fulci's brightest moments. (Note that all description below  is from the uncut version on the Anchor Bay limited edition DVD, and as I've never seen the cut version released to theaters, some of what is described below may not sound  familiar to those who have already seen the movie, which had a theatrical re-releases in 1998 as Seven Doors of Death.)

The Beyond takes place in the Louisiana bayou country. It opens with a scene in 1927 detailing the brutal lynching  of Sweik, an eastern European of some sort who the natives believe has placed a curse on the town. During his lynching, Sweik protests that, in fact, he's the only  person keeping the town from falling under the curse. Needless to say, they mob doesn't listen to him, or a very short film we'd have. We then skip to 1981, as our heroine, Liza  (Fulci regular Catriona MacColl, seen most recently in the well-received 1998 film A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries), inherits the hotel where Sweik was staying at the time of his  unfortunate demise. The place is haunted, especially Room 36, Sweik's room. As well, the basement is constantly flooded, and no one can figure out why. A plumber is  dispatched to find the source of the water, and in his attempt he instead finds the source of the hauntings. Complications, as they say, ensue.

The Beyond works in no small part for the same reason that John Carpenter's contemporary film The Fog works--the  events are presented with absolutely no context. The filmmaker hands up a plate of hot, steaming horror and raises no questions as to why any of this is happening. This  is an important distinction; whether the film itself raises unanswered questions is often the difference between the success and the failure of a venture like this one. Fulci  doesn't raise the questions, and The Beyond works. Argento doesn't raise the questions, and Suspiria works. (Argento tried to raise the questions in Inferno, and boy, did it  ever not work.) Fulci throws us an extra bone, however, in
allowing one character to raise one question that no one in the film is capable of answering. Very nice touch,  that.

Beyond (no pun intended) the film itself, the DVD release falls apart a bit, which is somewhat surprising in any  Anchor Bay release, and is especially troubling in such an expensive, limited disc. Most of the extras that come with the release are either soundless (which is quite  annoying when the extra is, for example, an interview!) or have a harsh soundtrack overlaid onto them. Might have been nice to use Fabio Frizzi's score for the film, which is up to  the usual Frizzi standard and even surpasses it in places.

The film itself is definitely worth watching, both for fans of Italian horror specifically and the more general  horror-fan population alike. However, you may want to wait for a non- limited release from Anchor Bay or Elite before picking it up on DVD. **** for the film, **  for this particular  release of it, so we'll compromise and say ***.",1012521600,,3515,4.721311475409836

1108398,2,6305972079,"There's an intentionally ironic scene in Italian horror filmmaker Lucio Fulci's ""The Beyond"" involving a hospital cart with excruciatingly squeaky wheels. This cart is wheeled by a soon-to-be victim of Fulci's special-effects crew. Listening to the weird, erratic soundtrack, I found myself praying for those sqeaky wheels to return.
Lucio Fulci is the Italian gore king that brought us such classics as ""The New York Ripper"", ""Zombi"", ""The House By the Cemetery"", ""The Gates of Hell"", ""City of the Living Dead"", and the inexplicably titled ""Don't Torture Duckling"" (?!).
""The Beyond"" isn't so much a film as, say, an excuse to show off 14 or 15 really cool gross-out scenes. Acid on face, plastic tarantulas eating face, acid on face again (Fulci apparently had a thing for acid), and various scenes where eyes are popped out of their sockets.
I mentioned the music. The schizophrenic music varies between very chilling, effective mood pieces to completely confounding horror-disco. Nothing funkier than a scene that builds, and builds, and builds until the shocking acid-on-the-face climax is accompanied by the Italian equivalent of the Bee Gees.
Watching this ""film"", one is left with several questions: why film in Louisiana if all the actors are all British and Italian? Why is it that Bob the dead plumber rises from the dead in a completely new outfit? When did he change his clothes? Are the dead that conscious about fashion? Is the video store still open so I can go rent something better?
If you enjoy watching dogs tear out people's throats, chain-beatings, and bad overdubbing (and who doesn't, I ask?) then Lucio Fulci's ""The Beyond"" hits the spot.
Since I'm reviewing the DVD version, I'll mention the extras. Each schlocky, unbearable frame of the original print is lovingly restored for the DVD.

1108400,3,6305972079,"Like Argento, Fulci makes horror movies filled with excellent cinematography and special fx, decent acting, lots of graphic gore, etc. Unfortunately, Fulci's plots tend to be messy and confused. In this case, as with many of his movies, the thin plot is just an excuse for zombies to go around killing people.
A woman buys a house in New Orleans that turns out to contain a gateway to ""Hell"" (actually, it is more like the original Greek conception of the afterlife which was created as a philosophical allegory: everyone winds up spending eternity lying around on a muddy, foggy plain no matter their station in life). Zombies from this hell kill anyone who hangs around the house, and everyone the zombies kill also become zombies.  They don't kill people for food (they don't eat anyone after killing them), so at first it appears that they are guarding the gateway.  But their ations aren't consistent since they go around killing everyone they come across, even when they have been nowhere near the gateway. Nor do they act like escapees.  For example, they go after a blind woman who tries to warn others away from the house in order to take her back to hell (apparently people who enter hell alive go blind instead of turning into zombies), thus acting more like prison wardens.  In other words, the zombies don't act with any sort of consistent motive, and there is just a lot of killing and ominous warnings with no logical consistency.
The deaths themselves tend to get ridiculous. It is never enough for someone to just die a horrible death.  For example, a bottle of acid will fall down on an already dead body (talk about flogging a dead horse), or flesh eating spiders will appear out of nowhere and start eating a victim (whose flesh unrealistically tears like cotton candy). The cotton candy flesh is an another problem with Fulci: in order to make the scenes as graphic as possible, the victims sometimes stay conscious and alive longer than is realistic, or too much detail is shown (making the effects noticeable), etc. As a result, the effectiveness of these scenes actually decrease because of the director's attempts to make them more gory than necessary.
Adding to this film's problems is an often annoying soundtrack. But, hey, it is still more fun than most big hollywood horror movies if you don't take it too seriously.",1006128000,,2346,4.797029702970297
1108401,4,6305972079,"Anyone who has seen a film from Lucio Fulci knows a few things to expect: 1) Gore is always the name of the game. 2) Eyeballs are wholesale items to be popped out, burned, cut open, eaten, and just plain demolished. 3) The plot's always as incoherent as one of those Saturday morning serials back in the day, but that proves to never matter. 4) Never eat before the film and never encourage others to eat. 5) This director isn't famous for keeping couples together, especially the ones where the guy has to force his girl to sit down for one of his movies.
Most of Fulci's films are for guys who moonlight as gorehounds; guys who are in love with George Romero for creating the kind of flick that gave birth to Fulci's ability to pop out eyeballs and burn people's faces off with sulfuric acid. With ""The Beyond,"" Fulci fans get everything they want, without (shock) the gratuitous nudity you get in so many of his films (see my review for ""The New York Ripper""). The plot is basic: This hotel down in Louisiana is home to one of the Seven Gateways of Hell, and when a man is tortured to death (and when I say tortured, you better believe it; I've never cringed at the sight of a horror film murder so much) the gate is loosened. When his body is discovered years later, the gate is opened. What happens next is a steadily increasing amount of the living dead coming out of the city morgue, all of which are as grotesque looking as my mom's meat loaf. The film has its moments of complete stupidity, like when the male lead obviously has figured out that you have to shoot the zombies in the head to kill them, but he just keeps wasting ammo on body shots. That's all forgivable, I guess, because the rest of the film, especially its haunting closing shot with creepy voiceover to accompany, is so atmospheric, and filmed with a passion for the craft. The opening scenes, despite the savagry, are my favorite because of the way Fulci colored the film to make it look like an old faded photograph in motion. The gore effects are professional and convincing, the zombies are plentiful and even scary, and the acting... well, the acting is as wooden as that puppet who wants to be a real boy. But that's Lucio Fulci, and this is his ""masterpiece,"" as it is proclaimed.

I sat down to watch this and it started out on the right note, exactly what any horror movie fanatic would want, a vicious beating which ultimately ended in the crucifixion of a radicalistic priest. Come on tell me thats not what you wanted as an opener. And as the movie progresses more and more unfolds to the effect of the seven gates of hell. I thought this movie had a great ending which I will not reveal was very unique in its own way. But the thing that got me was the zombie attack in the hospital,hich was added only because of the zombie carze in Germany(bless those germans), was spectacular.

1108404,1,6305972079,"Gosh,where do I begin.
  I know Fulci has a huge cult following, and this movie is supposed to be his magnum opus, but I honestly cannot say enough bad things about it.  Those supposedly ""in the know"" exalt ""The Beyond""'s lack of cohesive plot in favor of its surreal imagery, but I'm guessing that most of these people are just gorehounds who obviously have not seen a lot of movies.  There are plenty of movie directors who do this well (ever hear of David Lynch?  Cronenberg?  Argento?  Kubrick's ""2001""?), and, hate to break it to ya, folks, but Fulci ain't one of 'em.  For one thing, it's not even original -- Fulci's pretty much doing his inferior version of Dario Argento's ""Inferno"" (which is far from Argento's best -- it starts to fall apart in the third act -- but it's still twice as good as this junk.)  Oh yeah, and Fulci's still stuck on copying Romero's shoot-em-in-the-head walking zombies (not that the idiotic hero can figure that out -- right up to the end, he keeps shooting them three times in the chest before trying the head -- man, that kinda stuff ticks me off!)
  More than anything else, this movie's been applauded for its gratuitous gore scenes, including spiders eating a face, acid eating a face (yawn) and so on.  I'm not a prude -- I don't have a problem with good gore scenes if the entire movie has more to offer and is not built around them.  Well, ""The Beyond"" is built entirely around its gore scenes -- and if anything's gratuitous, it's how stupidly these scenes are set up.  For example, the guy's up on a ladder -- Fulci can't think of any other way to get him to fall off so he can be slooooowly eaten alive by spiders, so he has a FLASH OF LIGHTNING come OUT OF THE FREAKING BLUE and startle him into falling to the ground where, apparently, he becomes paralyzed as spiders eat his face in a laughably fake, rubbery FX scene.  Dumb.  Also, the acid scene -- the chic turns around and shrieks -- NOT because there's a hideously-grotesque monster lying on the bed behind her, but because, I guess, a jar of acid is somehow tipping over on a high shelf and she somehow gets under it???  HUH?!?!  No one else felt cheated by the utter stupidity of this scene?  I get the impression Fulci had all this makeup and fake blood and goo and rubber heads and junk to work with, so he just threw a bunch of wretchedly prolonged, gooey death scenes together and hardly bothered to link them with some contrived storyline -- sort of a ""gee, what weird, gross death can we cook up for this scene"" mentality.  You want to see a bunch of fake death scenes?  Rent ""Faces of Death"" -- you don't even have to sit through ludicrous ""plot development"" -- (and, for this movie, I use that phrase very loosely.)
  Oh -- the acting's atrocious, too.  Ex.: a lady discovers a body in the cellar spitting up its guts and its eyes gouged out and her expression DOES NOT CHANGE AN INCH!  Sorry, but that sucks.  Didn't Fulci want some kind of reaction? Who is he -- Ed Wood?  He can only do one take? I know all you fans are saying, ""Man, you just don't understand, dude"" -- well, maybe you're right.  I don't understand how something so obviously idiotic could achieve cult status PLUS an endorsement from Quentin Tarantino!  Guess he's not as cool as I thought.
  To sum up, I haven't seen a lot of Fulci's movies, but if they're all like this one and his Romero wannabe, ""Zombie"" (which, granted, is the tiniest bit better than this one), then I'll pass.  Judging from these, I get the impression he couldn't direct himself out of a cardboard box.

I agree with the lack of plot, but I wonder how anyone -- even the most devoted of Fulci fans -- could call this film stylish, that is, unless style is by definition that which contains an infinity of bad special effects. I can't stop thinking about the spider scene -- spider marionettes eating latex. And then there's the acid scene . . . and the dog scene. Fulci seems to construct these death scenes for the purpose of showing excessive gore. I have no issue with excess, it's just that the effects in this film are so amateurish and laughable that they try to add a ""camp"" value to this work, a value that is undermined by Fulci's serious tone.
Fulci wants to make a great film, but doesn't have the budget to do so. Rather than restraining himself to protect the project's greatest weakness, that being its meager budget, Fulci insists on going as far as possible, even if that means putting on film effects that would be laughed out of film school. To Fulci's credit, The Beyond is clearly the work of someone who can't be bothered with dissenting opinions. I suppose that I admire his courgage.
I am not a Fulci hater. In fact, Zombie, New York Ripper and Don't Torture a Duckling are good horror films, in my opinion.

""Zombie"" could at least boast being a guilty pleasure, but this actually tried to be a straight up horror film.
I ask some people how this film was good.  They usually reply with ""Well, it has good atmosphere and gore.""  First off, without plot, good acting, or character development, atmosphere and gore can't save anything.  Secondly, what atmosphere? Oh it was there, but it was unbearably dull.  I never had any sense of dread, fear, or suspense.
The gore, however, is top notch.  Fulci did have a talent for it, but directing was something he just wasn't good at.  The ending is really downbeat as well, which is always a plus when it comes to horror.

I won't go into the plot since it's been recapitulated many times in previous reviews.  I couldn't wait to see this movie thinking it was a zombie feature along the lines of ""Dawn of the Dead"" but as I was falling asleep 15 minutes into this banal production, I knew I had been duped!  There is not a single moment of building anticipation in the first three quarters of the movie(with the exception of a ""zombie dog"" that provides a much needed moment of shock).  I like gore as much as the next horror fan, but being sanguineous for the sake of being sanguineous didn't scare me--it just made me nauseous(i.e. The never ending spider attack and the eternally long face-burned-with-acid scene come to mind).

As a lover of certian genres such as italian horror, this is merely an average film. It's way too uneven.. It's starts off with a bang with a heinous murder of a cultist.. then loses focus.. the horror scenes are too far apart, untill the end in the hospital when its a zombie attack. Then the very end makes no  sense, typical italian film. On the plus side the cinematography is good, Fulci uses great shots and focus tricks. Some of the special effects aren't bad either, such as the first eye gouging or the nails through the wrists. Others such as the spider scene are a mixed bag. All in all, for the money its a good movie to have on hand to play in the background of your Halloween party, or when you have a BAD movie party. Enjoy!

But you have to realize the funds he was working with, and the time as well. When you watch the Beyond, you musn't snicker or get hung up on plot holes, b/c it isn't trying to outsmart the viewer. It is Lucio Fulci giving he best shot to direct this film,and the actors are giving the movie the seriousness that it deserves. It all centers around a gate of hell being opened, and a limited amount of time before the dead walk the the earth. To me that is a good foundation for a movie. It throws little details in as you go along to add to the mystery of what is going to happen. It has good gore, a dark attitude, and good direction. The directing was very silent, in that Fulci never really warns you when something is going to happen. He just lets you see it and hits you hard when something does happen. In the end, I enjoy this movie with each viewing, and feel that it shouldn't come off as trying to be too smart for the viewer. Just sit and watch it, without thinking too much or getting hung up on anything.

Though once again Fulci throws logic out the door, the film functions nicely as a nightmarish descent into Hell.  Catriona MacColl and David Warbeck both give solid performances(this despite the dubbing) which allows the viewer to sympathize with them as their world is brought crashing down around them and they are plunged into a waking nightmare where the dead walk.  Fulci uses odd camera work, strange color schemes and bizarree music(Fabio Frizzi'a very Goblin-esque score) to create an atmosphere of mounting terror that doesn't let up until the very end.  Anchor Bay has done an excellent job(as usual!) on this film.  It looks and sounds absolutely fantastic(many times better than the pan-and-scanned, faded 7 DOORS).

1108532,4,6305972079,"""The Godfather of Gore""-Lucio Fulci. People either love the guy, or hate him. Some call him a hack, other's consider him a genious. Whatever the case I consider him to be a very fine craftsman who took to the horror genre with a vengeance. Controversial even in his homeland, Fulci was rejected by the press after attacking the Catholic Church in his films BEATRICE CENCI and DON'T TORTURE THE DUCKLING. The latter film in particular is an emotionally shattering masterpiece that seriously needs better exposure. Fulci found his biggest success with his gory zombie tetraology of 1979-1982: ZOMBIE, GATES OF HELL, HOUSE BY THE CEMETARY, and which Brings us to this film, hailed many times as his very best, his outr&eacute; masterpiece, ""The Beyond."" A film Made with skill, wit and bracing efficiency, the film evokes Lovecraft in it's moody, decaying ambience and create an environment in which -- as the director observed -- ""horror is ubiquitous, in even the most innocuous forms."" Fulci conceived what he set out to do, creating a ""Living Nightmare"", full of looming misty imagery, full of vibrant oranges and reds. Hyponoticaly inticing the eye, while at the same time displaying such nightmaric-dream-like proportions filled with brimming piano death melodies that cultimate in the films dream-like structure. This is a film where the term ""Logic"" is total-nonexsistent. Where the film's script doesn't have to be ""coherent"" enough to make sense, it's structured as a dream--So like a dream nothing really makes sense, when one dreams one can not make out what extally they are dreaming of, but a bunch of images and sequences, just like most of Fulci's films. But this time the plot device--is the advantage. It all makes sense even though it really doesn't seem to. The Performances are, like most of Fulci's low-budgeties appear wooden. With the exception of David Warbeck-who by far pulls out the best performance. Fulci's direction is certainly top-notch, as with most of his Zombie films, he seems to be focused more on style & gore than substance. Overall ""The Beyond"" remains and always will remain(as much as mainstream critics despise and pan it as hack-work) a ""Cult-Classic"" of the Horror Genre, and one of the most important, trend-setting zombie films of it's decade. As well as an extreamly fun-gore-packed-chiller-zombie flick. It delivers in all respects, but for an required taste, that is.  Try and get the DVD version, it's a Fulci-Fan's delight!

With that aside, 'The Beyond' pretty much plays along with the usual Fulci fare...zombies, heads exploding (which is also featured in 'New York Ripper) melting flesh, and the signature eye gouging. The storyline is lacking as with most of Fulci's films with the exception of 'Cat in the Brain' (which is more autobiographical---Fulci was brought up on animal cruelty charges in the mid-80's). But what makes 'The Beyond' so different is the fact that Fulci had a unique talent to create atmosphere without much of a storyline and his and 'The Beyond' is his magnum opus for such feats.",987033600,,824,4.892857142857143
1108605,5,6305972079,"A run down hotel in New Orleans that rests atop one of hell's seven gateways serves as the focal point for most of this movie's action. This particular gateway has remained open since 1927 when a warlock was lynched by an angry mob, whipped with chains, and crucified to a wall in the hotel's basement. He warns the townsfolk, ""Be careful what you do, because this hotel was built over one of the seven doors of evil and only I can save you."" Rather than heed this ominous declaration, they award him a faceful of unforgiving quicklime and leave him there to die horribly.
  Flash forward several decades to 1981. Liza, a promising and beautiful young woman from New York, has inherited the old building but does not detect the demonic forces already in residence. That's because nothing altogether odd has really happened, at least not yet. Before long, however, people associated in whatever fashion with the hotel begin dropping like flies. A house-painter working by the upper-windows falls from his scaffold, a plumber is found mutilated in the basement, and a man researching the blueprints for the hotel succumbs to a grisly attack by tarantulas. Add to the mix the blind and mysterious Emily who pressures Liza to pack up and flee, a skeptical doctor, the ancient book of ""Eibon"" as well as a handful of zombies, and you should have a general idea of what this movie is all about.
  ""The Beyond"" released here previously as the heavily edited ""Seven Doors of Death"", is what I believe to be director Lucio Fulci's greatest work. It debuts uncensored on DVD with an absolutely awesome transfer, the same remastered print Quentin Tarantino used when he re-released the film back into theaters in 1998. Never has it looked or sounded any better. Give credit where credit is due because Anchor Bay has just done a phenomenal job with this disc.
  An effectively eerie soundtrack along with the traditional gore Fulci was known for easily elevates this well and above the recent watered-down, mainstream-friendly slasher films we've all grown sick of. This is the type of horror film no american director would ever have the proverbial guts to put out, never mind the occasional acting gaps and dialogue, and is a definite keeper.

Sure, some of the acting leans toward hoaky.  Yeah, the gore and monster effects sometimes look pretty bad, (those spiders).  Instead of viewing these as hinderances, I've actually come to enjoy them along with all of the other BRILLIANT moments.  What does the film have going for it?  Beautiful cinematography.

The plot is simple enough. A woman gets an ancient hotel that contains one of the seven gateways to Hell. People that have anything to do with the hotel die in gruesome (and very cool) ways.

For those new to Fulci, or even Italian horror, here is a film to start with.  Italian horror films, such as those from Fulci and Argento, rely less on plot, so don't expect any classic lines, a realistic plot, first-rate acting or a Hollywood ending.  Instead, what the Italians were going for was mainly atmosphere, and you get lots of it here.  Horror films back then were more visual and atmospheric, designed to truly scare the audience, relied less on Computer FX, and no confusing script; The plot only serves as a clothesline for the AMAZING gore scenes here (all close-up), which come out of nowhere and will shock even the most jaded viewers.  These include realistic scenes of tarantulas eating away at a face, two gruesome scenes of eye gouging, a dog attack on its owner (homage to Suspiria), and a gunshot to a girl which blows away the top half portion of her head.  Needless to say, gorehounds and horror fans must pick this up, especially the Limited Edition, which automatically is a keeper, and will be worth more than what it is selling for in the years to come.
This film, always condemened for its hokey acting and lame dialogue, was very important to the Italian horror film movement, and this film was just as significant.  Just like Kurosawa's ""Stray Dog"" was important to the growth of Japanese film, Fulci's ""The Beyond"" was one of the great classics of Italian horror (and one of the last), right up there with Bava and Argento, and no doubt influenced many horror filmmakers to come (Raimi, Jackson etc).  The Collector's Edition comes with a keeper's box, a 40+ page in-depth analysis of the film, Fulci, and other Italian filmmakers, and miniature posters from other countries.
This restoration of a classic movie is important, as it harks back to the days where filmmakers did not rely on computer special effects, but in fact constructed FX from scratch (this shows the effort of real artists), while having fun at it (and thus more realistic).  This film is true inspiration:  Made on a very small budget (nowhere even close to $1 million), this film still survives, very much talked about at film festivals and finally, rereleased in a very beautiful print (you couldn't tell it was made nearly 20 years ago), this is the one you must have in your collection.

Support the horror scene, so that many more horror films out there only available in the public domain can be rereleased in beautiful prints so the fans can enjoy truly what a horror film is.",977270400,,2722,4.844827586206897

Fulci's zombie opus is both visually stunning and entertaining - the levels of gore are as high as ever, some truly imaginative deaths and sequences. However, the story itself also holds up very well, the set pieces are excellent, lifting far beond almost any other zombie pic made. Whilst not maybe quite as fun as Fulci's 'Zombie', this is probably the one you want to get if you're at all curious about the zombie horror genre. Superb DVD and arguably Fulci's finest horror - watch this now!",973296000,,782,4.7153284671532845
1108660,2,6305972079,"""The Beyond"" is certainly an infamous movie, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to its notoriety. It's crime: the movie is BORING. The shocker gore scenes are laughable (much agreement to the earlier critic who asked about the pipe-cleaner tarantulas. No doubt!), the zombies pretty damned ridiculous, and the pacing sluggish. There were some highlights, however, including the dialogue ... priceless! ""I've lived in New York all of my life, and if there's one thing I know, there's no such thing as ghosts."" Oh my god! Another highlight: the red-haired, pig-tailed girl getting her head blown off. Impressive. However, I would recommend Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" before this over-rated bag of hooey.",973209600,,711,5.300884955752212
1108661,4,6305972079,"Well, this is a grisly little item! Unlike most of the other splatter movies of the western hemisphere, this one is as frightening as hell, too! The best time to watch it is in a stormy night with no light except for a burning candle on your living-room table. You'll know what I'm talking about after you watched THE BEYOND. You'll get some extra goosebumps if you sit with your back to the room entrance. Leave the door open and never turn around while the movie is running. If THE BEYOND doesn't frighten you, you're probably dead already.",972777600,,542,4.540816326530612
1108662,5,6305972079,"European Cinema was the first to release THE BEYOND on DVD.  Then Anchor Bay put out their version.  To compete with the studios that have more money, Diamond Entertainment released THE BEYOND under its old American title, THE SEVEN DOORS OF DEATH.  They  did NOT use the old, butchered print of DOORS.  Diamond used the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio print that European Cinema used, which is the same one Anchor Bay used.  I have all 3 of these DVD's and the title and extras are the ONLY difference.  There is NO missing footage in any of these releases.  Some people post their comments based on old VHS movies they saw years ago.  If you want the economy priced version of THE BEYOND, then get SEVEN DOORS OF DEATH.  If you want the version with the audio commentary, you'll have to buy Anchor Bay's version of THE BEYOND.  I'll say it once again:  This version of SEVEN DOORS OF DEATH is exactly the same, scene for scene, as Anchor's release of THE BEYOND, only the titles and extras are different.",972604800,,1003,4.5418994413407825

For example,when we watch a horror movie like ""The Beyond"",there is no doubt in my mind that this is a film that came from the brilliant mind of Lucio Fulci.""The Beyond""challenges any horror film goer to simply take what they see on the screen.

Most of the film's more intense sequences have been edited or removed, and certain scenes are missing altogether.  Now that Anchor Bay has released The Beyond in a definitive edition, don't even bother with this.  I'm sure ""Seven Doors..."" won't even be on the market much longer as a result of the Anchor Bay version.

1108685,5,6305972079,"No director is more misunderstood than Lucio Fulci. And no director is more deserving of such misunderstanding. To the impatient viewer his films seem like mindless low-budget slasher films and nothing more. However, a more perceptive audience will realize he has created a truly unique artistic vision thru the medium of low-budget gore films.  I was fortunate enough to experience this film in the theater, and was able to see Fulci's genius at work first hand. Within the first 15 minutes his disturbing imagery had forced several unprepared audience members to leave in disgust. Impressive, but not difficult to acheive. What truly astounded me was how most of the remaining audience laughed at what they perceived to be unintentional continuity flaws and other imagined mistakes.  Fulci had gotten the better of such viewers. If they were unable to see such deviations from conventional filmmaking as anything other than unintentional errors and illogical sloppiness, they could not hope to appreciate the social criticism and dark humor hidden within.  And yet, these viewers still left the theater satisfied. They had seen gratuitous amounts of gore and had gotten a good laugh at a ""cheezy"" horror movie.  The artistic genius is well hidden in Fulci's films and only those open to it will be fortunate enough to appreciate it. Let the others laugh and think they get it...the movie is one of the goriest ever made, and deserving of all the acclaim it receives for being so. But it is also much more. And the fact that most viewers overlook it's other attributes is an extremely gratifying one to those of us who can see it as more. Thank you, Lucio Fulci. Thank you for giving me the most satisfying cinematic experience I could ever hope to have.",971222400,,1755,4.938983050847457
1108686,5,6305972079,"The music of this film is excellent. The acting is great. The ending is perplexing but cool. Lucio Fulci is at his best in this one. I liked Zombie better, but this is just awesome. I recommend it for REAL horror fans.",971136000,,218,4.214285714285714
1108687,4,6305972079,"These films by Fulci are best left to watch in the late hours of the evening with all the lights off. THE BEYOND is a worthy  follow up to Zombie. The cinematography by Sergio Savati is excellent, especially in the contrast between the opening sequ- ence in 1927 and the cut to 1981. I remember seeing this in 1985 or 1986 at the local neighborhood ""Family Four"" cinema, if you can believe the irony in that. It was called SEVEN DOORS OF DEATH"". There are some great scenes of mood in this, especially when Liza travels down the highway and meets Emily the blind girl and her doggie. Great nihilistic ending too. Score is considered the best in a fulci film but I disagree, Zombie had the best score for midnight movie horror, and Gates of Hell had the most depressing and disturbing. Watch for the great mistakes in this such as ""DO NOT ENTRY"" and my favorite line""You have carte blanche, but not a blank check"". Great to watch this with Zombie, House by the Cemetery, and Gates of Hell.",969494400,,988,4.458563535911602
1108688,5,6305972079,"I saw this on the big screen a few summers ago thanks to  Quentin and Rolling Thunder Pictures who restored and re-released it. I stood in line  for 2 hours to be one of twenty to get a ""Beyond Eerie Eyeball.""  Damn, it was well worth it! This wasn't the only treat. Before the movie  they played old trailers: Deep Red, Evil Dead, Murder Mafia Style, Cannibal  Ferox, and Blood Feast! Now, if they would only have midnight showings of  these as well.
There are seven gateways to hell and if opened, the dead  will walk the earth. One such door is located in Louisiana's Schweik Seven  Door Hotel. In 1927 a Satanist opened one of the seven gateways before an  angry mob of townsfolk crucified him and proceeded to do unspeakable acts  to him. The townsfolk were too late. The door was left open.
1982. A  young woman, Eliza shows up in Louisiana to collect her inheritance, the  Schweik Seven Door Hotel. Of course strange things begin to happen. People  are mysteriously ding from eye eating tarantulas, impalement, eye gouging,  acid, etc. Then the freshly dead at the morgue decide to get up and walk.  While all this is going on Eliza befriends John, a local doctor, and tells  him about a mysterious blind girl. According to John the girl has been dead  for many years. While trying to settle their curiosity, the two search the  Hotel and examine a book of Eibon that they found. The book explains the  seven doorways to hell. Now they must try and close this gate to hell or  become trapped within.
It's better than it sounds. The gore is  fantastic. I have never seen so much eye gouging in all my days. Were would  a Fulci movie be with out it?
I don't like to nit-pick films but what's  up with the tarantulas looking like they were made out of pipe  cleaners?
The end is ball breaking.  It's very climatic with zombie  shooting and a little girl's head being blown apart. I hate happy endings  and this is far from happy.",965520000,,1933,4.464183381088826
1108689,4,6305972079,"I have been a big fan of Lucio Fulci for quite a while now, and still my Fav Mr Fulci film is 'Don't Torture a Duckling' but this movie would have  to be a close second. I am from England and from the country that has very  strange censorship laws (BBFC, mentioning no names! ) and I am always on  the lookout for uncut versions abroad. My work takes me to Los Angeles and  while there I pick them up, first on video and now on DVD. This picture had  everything, a good story (although drops a little in the middle) great  special effects for the time, creepy atmosphere and the acting was good  (not great, a little corny but acceptable) The transistion to DVD was okay,  being a fairly low budget pic anyway the picture was a little shaky and a  couple of times the colour was a little drab, but all in all they have done  a good job. I do wish that they would have added a few extra features with  it but the movie really speaks for itself. This film is definatly not for  the faint hearted, yes it is very gory, yes it is quite explicit but anyone  who is aware of Mr Fulci's work knows exactly what they are in for and as  for any fan who will see this they will not be disappointed. A real Horror  flick that beats any Scream10 , I know What you did Last week, month year  etc. Watch and learn!  Enjoy.",965001600,,1308,4.086614173228346

It's entertaining, certainly.  Good mood and practical effects, decent acting, and apparently a plot of some kind.  As for the eye rolls, you'll be treated to morticians with ""brain wave machines,"" huge, open jars of acid inexplicably placed atop wobbly cabinets, corpses kept on display at room temperature in mortuaries, revolvers that miraculously reload when emptied, and so on.  The set-ups are a bit obvious.  Twenty foot ladder? Get ready for a fall.  Scaffolding?  Ditto.  The more outlandish moments occur when the heroic doctor pulls a revolver from his desk drawer (what??) and proceeds to plug away at zombies, oddly oblivious to the fact that only his head shots are effective.  The funniest scene occurs in the blink of an eye at about the 1:19 point, when the actor playing the doctor (who is apparently unfamiliar with guns) steps into an elevator and attempts to reload his revolver by inserting a bullet into the tip of the barrel.  But it's all good fun, and overall an enjoyable, if not particularly scary, experience.",1497830400,,1206,4.891625615763547
