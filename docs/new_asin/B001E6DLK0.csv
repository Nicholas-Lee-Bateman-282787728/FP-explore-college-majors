3546065,5,B001E6DLK0,"""Swingtown"" is the best series television program that has been on American television in years and years. I cannot remember the last time I've watched a show that was so entertaining and funny and clever. A series like ""Swingtown"" restores my faith in broadcast network television which has otherwise gone to hell in a hand basket.

Truth be told, I never would have watched this show if none other than Grant Show were not staring in it. He's one of my favorite actors and he was on one of my favorite TV shows so I had a feeling that anything he would be in would at least be mildly fun to watch. But this show is way more than just a little fun. And, even if Grant weren't in it, I think I'd still enjoy it. But watching him is just icing on the cake. Doesn't he look so sexy with that mustache, too? In a recent TV Guide interview when asked about his new 70's appearance Grant said: It's a boom-chick-a-boom-boom mustache, that's for sure.

This is the main cast:
Grant Show / Tom Decker
Lana Parrilla / Trina Decker
Shanna Collins / Laurie Miller
Jack Davenport / Bruce Miller
Miriam Shor / Janet Thompson
Nick Benson / Roger Thompson

The show is basically about 3 very different families, living through the free-loving 70's in a suburb of Chicago. The Miller's are more or less your typical family. They moved to a nicer neighborhood with their children. And when they moved, they met Tom and Trina Decker. Tom and Trina are a little more adventurous and enjoy trying new things. Janet & Roger are the Millers' neighbors from their previous neighborhood who they were always very good friends with; however since the move the relationship has become to start getting strained for a variety of reasons.

What's so special about this show?

Well, as the title (may) suggest, some of the principal characters enjoy swinging. The Decker's are serious swingers who just want to make new friends and enjoy themselves. The Miller's are (much) less adventurous, however after meeting Trina and Tom they decide to throw cautions to the wind and try it. And, the Thompson's are at the other end of the pendulum. I wouldn't call them prudes, though. Because I don't think many people would consider swinging a fun thing or even something that would be simple to try.

What's most interesting about this series is watching these 3 very different groups of people come together and put their differences out there for everyone to see. They each have a very diverse perspective and they're each right and wrong in their own ways.

When I think of swinging the very first thing that comes to mind is that hilarious ep from ""All in the Family."" Do you remember the one? Edith invited a couple that she met from a personals ad over and unbeknownst to her they were a couple of swingers. And, when she found out that they both enjoyed having sex with multiple partners because as they put it, ""we were drowning, swinging saved our marriage,"" Edith replies: ""I think I'd rather drown.""

Frankly, that's how I feel, too. I'd sooner walk though a burning building before I or my husband ever did such a thing. But that doesn't mean that this series still isn't informative and just great to watch. You don't have to take sides and you don't have to be for it or against it to enjoy the show.

CBS has ordered a total of 13 eps for Season 1 (these were actaully filmed last year) and these included:
Pilot
Love Will Find a Way
Double Exposure
Cabin Fever
Go Your Own Way
Friends With Benefits
Heatwave
Puzzlerama
Swingus Interruptus
Running on Empty
Episode #11 - title not yet announced
Surprise
Take It To The Limit

Two fundamentalist groups already tried to get ""Swingtown"" boycotted. Whatever happened to live and let live? I suppose changing the channel would be too difficult for these people. Remember, judge not lest ye be judged and in the case of this series you are not what you watch.",1220140800,20,4107,4.762306610407876
3546066,5,B001E6DLK0,"I found SWINGTOWN to be one of the best shows of 2008 - Well acted, well written, well produced.  The controversy that surrounded it when it began I think was unwarrented.  While yes, there are some scenes of 'swinging', they are not exploitive or tasteles. There is certainly nothing more 'provacative' then you usually see in a daytime soap opera. I think the show focuses primarily on the lives of the main characters who are caught up in a time of change and discovery.  While not a perfect show, it is certainly better than most of the garbage that passes as entertainment today.  It is original and creative and that alone makes it surpass most of the rehashed series on network TV and certainly any of the endless reality crap that we are subjected to.  I hope the DVD set does the show justice and that there will be a Season 2 to follow next year.",1220054400,19,856,4.461538461538462

I'm not surprised it got cancelled, it's a small miracle they made one season of it.  But I wish they could have hung on for another season or two.",1413936000,,240,4.0638297872340425
3546069,5,B001E6DLK0,"Interesting look back at the 70's.  It is a good series, and probably should have been on cable to get more than one season.  All the actors/actresses turn in great performances.",1402704000,,178,4.709677419354839
3546070,5,B001E6DLK0,"This show was superbly cast, sets and wardrobe were perfect to set the era, and the characters were well developed.  It was probaby just too early for its time.  Mature subjects tastefully presented.  I laughed, I cried, I reminisced.",1402531200,2,234,4.948717948717949
3546071,5,B001E6DLK0,"It's too bad that this show only had one season. It's title gave it a bad name - literally. There were three couples in various situations: one swinging couple, one traditional couple, and another where the couple was moving up in the social scene so they were looking for something more, but not quite ready for swinging. This took place in 1976, when I was a kid, and gave an insight into society's changing times.

Summer + eye-brow raising title made it lose steam.

There were some things about it that weren't so great, but the adult actors (at least the 6 main characters) were not the issue.",1393200000,,599,4.537037037037037
3546072,5,B001E6DLK0,I am truly dissapointed that they cancelled this lovely show. It was my time. I grew up in that era and identified with it.,1390780800,,123,4.166666666666667
3546073,5,B001E6DLK0,I am a big fan of this show and have seen it many times.  I think it takes on the question of what the consequences would be if we did whatever we wanted.  Sometimes it is better to keep things as a fantasy.  Love the acting as well as music and remembering the 70s.  Makes you want to go out there and enjoy the life you have.,1389139200,,327,3.8358208955223883
3546074,5,B001E6DLK0,"Fun series for a few reasons: it seems like a nice rewind of the 70's - clothing, events of the time, etc. The acting is good; the plot lines really aren't so different from any well developed character series. These characters are interesting and their relationships seem real. I didn't care for the final episode's twist and results as I found it a bit judgemental and probably not accurate for those in the swinging lifestyle. But it was a fun series nonetheless and if there was a 2nd season, I'd watch it.",1378080000,,510,4.554347826086956
3546075,5,B001E6DLK0,"It turned out to be a really great show, I kinda wish it didn't get cancelled. All the actors did amazing job. It was great to see a show that exploded the themes it did.
But to me the stand out of whole show was Lana Parrilla, she plays Trina Decker... when ever she's in a scene it steals it. She's just captivating and an amazing actor. She was cast perfectly for her role.
If your an evil regal buy this you're going to love every minute Lana's on scene!!",1375660800,,459,4.111111111111111
3546076,5,B001E6DLK0,"Bought this season for one reason only! Lana Parrilla! So sad the show didn't make it past the first season but glad she's on once upon a time!

3546077,5,B001E6DLK0,"This is one of the only shows I know of where I smiled throughout each  and every episode---and it's not even a comedy. It's just feel good TV (corny, but true)!",1367539200,2,161,4.193548387096774
3546078,5,B001E6DLK0,This was one of the shows I made sure I didn't miss; while this wasn't my generation and times are might different I loved the show. It was one of those things that would push the boundries and tried to stay its own.,1360886400,,216,4.046511627906977
3546079,5,B001E6DLK0,"Re-watched Swingtown last week with a friend who had never seen it and we both loved it.  I originally watched it when it was first on CBS and was sorry to see that it didn't get renewed, so when I saw the DVD at Target of all places, I grabbed it, knowing I would enjoy seeing it all again.  I felt that some of the ""swinging"" scenes were a little racier than I remembered them, but overall such a good show with very good depictions of the 70's.  Everybody was well cast and it was interesting to see the changes that all of the characters went through.  I was really looking forward to watching as they journeyed further through the 70's and into the 80's, but it was not meant to be.  It was also neat seeing the old rotary phones and other 70's stuff that I remember so well.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a well written and enthralling drama/soap opera taking place in the 70's.",1360108800,3,914,4.254335260115607
3546080,4,B001E6DLK0,"So, I originally only started this series because of the fabulous Lana Parrilla. I'm a Once Upon a Time fan, and my fellow Evil Regals got me hooked on all of her other projects. I was hesitant at first because of the show's initial themes, but when I really started watching it online and getting into it, I fell in love. It wasn't just some gratuitous show about sex. There was a lot to be said about family and marriage and life in general; and while I can't say I agree with all of the show's liberal views, it was fair and enjoyable. The characters were lovable and easy to relate to; the actors did a wonderful job at making them very human and real. Also, I loved all the 70's culture thrown in. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever hear the songs featured on this show the same way again.

But since I've finished watching it, I've been itching to re-watch in better quality. Now all that's left is for me to wait not so patiently for my DVD to arrive. :)",1356048000,4,960,4.245901639344262

3546082,5,B001E6DLK0,"This is a great show, witty and classy despite the topic which may make some viewers uncomfortable. Great acting, good story line. Too bad it didn't get more traction, would have loved to see the next seasons.",1350604800,,209,4.675675675675675
3546083,1,B001E6DLK0,"Honestly, I don't understand all the 5-Star reviews for ""Swingtown,"" because I found it poorly made on almost every level.  And if you're looking for anything even remotely close to the quality of ""Madmen,"" sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this show is at Titanic level depths beneath the quality of ""Madmen.""  First problem, the writing of Swingtown was terrible.  Evidently none of the writers grew up in the 70s, because there was virtually zero attempt to make the characters speak like they're actually in the 70s.  The 70s were exploding with words, phrases and slang unique to the 70s but you'll find hardly any ""70s-speak"" on this show.  What's worse, the writers use words in ways they were not used back in the 70s, such as the dismissive form of ""whatever"" and the buddy/pal form of ""dude.""  Those uses of ""whatever"" and ""dude"" didn't start until the mid 80s.  So sloppy lazy writing that fails to immerse you in the time period.  Set design is also weak, with far too many sets and locales looking too ""stage-y"" and fake.  And if you look closely in some scenes in which characters are driving around in a car, you can see 2000-era sports cars and SUVs driving past in the background.  I mean that's so bad that it's like Ed Woods levels of incompetance.  Stories?  Forgettable.  Acting?  Forgettable.  Editing?  Forgettable.  Music/Soundtrack?  So-so.  I mean I love good TV shows set in by-gone eras, but if you're going to make a show set in the 70s you better make it FEEL like the 70s.  I grew up in the 70s, I knew the 70s, and you, Swingtown, are no 70s show.",1341100800,5,1585,4.553191489361702
3546084,5,B001E6DLK0,"I happened to find this show somewhere on the internet, and have watched the series from beginning to end.  It perfectly captures the 70s lifestyle.  Even the cinematography is luscious.  The characters are well-developed - so much so that we actually ""like"" the swinging couple who will gladly hook up outside their marriage.  So disappointing that religious zealots and the like had to pull this show off the air.  It's always the good shows that die first, while the Big Bang Theorys live on forever.",1331942400,,503,4.870588235294117

3546086,5,B001E6DLK0,"this series was hampered by it's initial premise.  most people probably looked at the whole 70s/swinger thing and kept on going...

3546087,5,B001E6DLK0,"It was our loss that the program was not picked up by any network...I can only assume it resulted from the yellow stripe syndrome.  Many programs that went on to become big hits started slowly and this program would have made it big.  Why HBO didn't pick it up is beyond me.  It was a nostalgic walk through memories of yesteryear.  If you're a boomer or almost a boomer, and not a prude, you will love this program.  It is far more than a program on swinging...it is far more about the lives of boomer suburbia in the 70's and how a few found themselves looking for answers in the arms of their neighbors wives and husbands.  If you're not a prude...there will be something to enjoy for almost anyone of the boomer generation...the younger generation shouldn't watch to avoid jealousy of a simpler time, swinging not-with-standing.",1301270400,4,832,4.625850340136054
3546088,5,B001E6DLK0,"I don't know? 'Swingtown' was one of those shows that came on in the middle of the year--I'm thinking like the Spring season, in the middle of the week--that I guess I could never quite keep track of.

And maybe that's what happened with a LOT of other people too--which probably lead to this show's cancellation.  And what a shame!  Because&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swingtown-The-First-Season/dp/B001E6DLK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swingtown - The First Season</a>&nbsp;was a GEM of a show!!!

The character's were so wonderfully put together.  And the actors who got to play them were EVERYTHING and MORE than you would've wanted them to be!!!

And the funny thing--and it's not even really funny, but the MAIN reason that I wanted to get this show was because of the actor Jack Davenport--who I remember enjoying from the BBC show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coupling-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0000797E5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coupling - The Complete First Season</a>--I always liked him in that--always kinda reminded me of the 'Ross' character from the TV show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friends-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005YU81/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friends: The Complete First Season</a>.  Though, he was NOTHING like either of those characters in this show.

I liked how he and his wife, played by the wonderful Molly Parker--who I remember seeing in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Feet-Under-The-Complete-Series/dp/B002N57KGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Feet Under: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;as the lady Rabi, were like the 'normal' couple moving up from suburbia.

I liked how even though they could've been thought of as slightly 'conservative', they were MORE than open enough to...well, the name of the show IS 'Swingtown', so I'm sure you can put it all together!

But what I liked even more than the 'swinging' aspect of the show, was how the two couples Jack & Susan and Tom & Trina related to each other when it wasn't about the 'swinging'.  It was like Susan was NEVER going to look at Trina sideways for sleeping with her husband.  And Tom was NEVER going to be caught leering at Susan.  It was like (the 'swinging') was something that the four of them did together.  And it held a special place for them, CERTAINLY. Though it wasn't going to get to the point that it was BIGGER than their friendship.  Like their friendship could even be sustained without it. (Which as the show went along, it sorta came to.)

More importantly, what I liked about this show, is that it was about people. And the lives that they were living at a certain time in America that has LONG since been forgotten about--well, maybe not SO forgotten about, but people have a lot of other things on their minds these days!

I liked that this show could be unique and different and didn't have to follow the same old formula of 'crime show' THIS, 'medical drama' THAT, that most current shows seem to me modeled around.

Sure wish that the network wouldn't have cancelled this and sure wish that the production staff of this show could've somehow found another network for this show to be moved to, to keep it going--I mean, that's what cable's for!

I mean, it seemed to work for the show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sliders-The-First-and-Second-Seasons/dp/B00022FWEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sliders - The First and Second Seasons</a>&nbsp;as well as another long time favorite of mine--<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Paper-Chase-Season-One/dp/B001O4KBMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Paper Chase: Season One</a>.

It was actually a show that my husband was willing to watch--that is something since all he watches is Sports 24/7.  We really looked forward to watching it tivo'd.

It was very exciting to see a glimpse inside the swinging lifestyle.  The show related how it was both exciting and problematic.  For many of us that would never actually embrace the ""swinging"" lifestyle, it did give us a little taste of it without the drama that revolves around it.

The plot is groovy, the acting superb and the music and feel of this show literally brings me back to that era. Very well made and should be on a channel such as HBO or FX to get the full effect. It really has very little sex and focuses more on the relationships that develop very well over the 13 episode season.

It manages to be racy and a little bawdy without being smutty. It balances a fine line, but ultimately is character driven and is utterly engrossing.

For the prudes who protested this show because of the swinging.... there are only seconds long clips of the actual swinging in darkly lit rooms. Most of it is implied instead of shown. The characters are richly written and resonate as true. The family dynamics are real to life with the children and times of the excessive 70's. The costumes and settings are so 70's its like watching your own town, driving your old family cars and your own homes. I was surprised that CBS had the balls to bring this for viewers.

3546101,5,B001E6DLK0,"This is an awesome show. It would be a shame if it were not renewed with Bravo. It has a great cast, and the swinger ring leaders, Tom and Trina are a couple everyone would love to be friends with. Trina's character is sexy and understanding. All these characters mesh really well together and the fact that it is set in the 70's, well, that was just a magical time. The music they play in the background has all the faves of the 70's. There has been some criticism about this show. I believe that it was a misinterpretation of the actual ""swingers"" theme. It deals with the complication of swinging as well, and the heartache it can cause in a marriage. The show actually trails the lives of these couples. One couple is the ring leaders (Tom/Trina)of swinging, the other couple (Bruce/Susan) moved in across the street and are experimenting, while the 3rd couple (Roger/Janet) are Bruce and Susan's old neighbors, are the 50's morals couple who are appalled by Bruce and Susan's possible swinging life style. Trina and Janet have some doozies of opinions. There are some cat fights. The set designs are incredible (especially Tom and Trina's). They are the 70's to a t. Great show, great costumes, overall the best. I bought this DVD and have watched it 3x. My husband is getting the idea that I want to swing...not true...it's just a great show!!

Swingers I knew were successful, educated, 'normal' except they had heightened libidos and took good care of themselves and so looked real good.

Swingtown is a wonderful series for so many reasons. First, it's authentic. It addresses both simple and complex human relationship issues. Excellent production values shine from scripts to casting to direction. ST is unbiased, showing the pros and cons of the lifestyle. It's a nostalgic visit to the 70's, a simpler, less cynical time, sort of an American adolescence before the harder, angrier, scarier times in the last decades of the 20th Century. And now, too. For most viewers it will be very, very entertaining, certainly thought-provoking.

Yes, it involves rather sensational sex. But in tasteful, only illusionary ways; actually, in rather romantic, mature, character-defining ways. It could be the most interesting, humanistic and dramatic way to get insights into the sociology, psychology and cultural aspects of adult relationships via TV today.

ST is never vulgar. (You want vulgar, see Californication!) Rather, it delves into complex American belief systems then (and now) and dramatizes our wants versus our needs and the confusions that hit when they don't jive. Of course, it's sexy and stirring too.

ST can be seen as intelligent soap opera. Social pressures, moral questioning, heavy on relationship depictations. As characters aren't all swingers it's interesting to see conventional people's conflicts and often-titillated interest when they get what's going on. Often, pretty funny too.

The net of it: Swingtown is more than sex, it successfully uses the charged swinger's context to address many aspects of human nature; while being great entertainment.

Last note: Estimates say over 50-million swingers are in America today. [...]",1231718400,4,2683,6.1386666666666665

Of course, I never lived the exciting lives of these characters, but the whole atmosphere of the 70's was recreated so vividly in the series.  I told several of my friends about the show and got my daughter hooked after the third episode. She was upset that there were no reruns to bring her up to date. I was thrilled to find it available before Christmas, and pulled off the best surprise gift ever!  We all knew people who resembled the characters on this show, the times they were a changin' and the attitudes and fashions reflected the new ""hip"" generation.

3546108,5,B001E6DLK0,"Summer shows are meant to reflect the time of the year: light, fun, and happy. And... as with most with the changing of the leaves and coolness of autumn air, they quickly disappear from memory. I frankly wasn't expecting much from the show as it seemed to be atypical CBS's preferred line-up. My curiousity to watch the series was both my familarity with Grant Snow (Melrose Place), Jack Davenport (Coupling), and Josh Hopkins (Jack & Jill, Pepper Dennis, & Brothers & Sisters) and my fond memories of 1976. The first episode started out the gate giving a glimspe of a series that was going to produce thought, conversation, and refection besides just skin and nostalgia. Unfortunately, as with CBS's penchant with a quality series, i.e., ""WKRP"" and ""Jericho,"" the network quietly jumped the show in its schedule making it harder to gain an audience, especially moving it to the ""graveyard"" Friday nights.
A very true reflection of culture, morals, mores of 1976 America! Just when I thought the show couldn't get better in quality, character development, or more entertaining, the next week's episode would prove me wrong. It is obvious that Mike Kelly took great pains to reproduce Chicago (or anytown) 1976 to an authenticity not equalled in many period shows. The actors don't play one-dimensional characters, but multi-layered people with a spectrum of feelings, opinions that crossed the morals, mores, economic-class, feelings, opinions (religious and otherwise), and casualness of the time and attitudes of both adults and kids of the '70's. My one apprecation of the show was that the teenagers actually looked like teenagers because they were teenagers and not 20 & 30-somethings playing those parts!
A very much under-rated and under-appreciated series! If you were lucky enough to lived through the '70's, catch this gem on this lucky chance that allows ""Swingtown"" to live again. Kudos, to the actors, producers, etc. that obvious went to great pains and broke the mold with a summer series that gives more than ""light and fluff."" They succeeded in more ways than they know. It is apparent the memories and appreciation of this show from its ardent fans about the summer of 1976 is going to last well beyond the summer of 2008.

Another reviewer compared this program to ""The Ice Storm"" and said that the movie was better.  Duh!  ""The Ice Storm"" was fantastic, based on an amazing book, with an Oscar-winning cast and director.  That is a MUST SEE flick, no doubt about it.  ""Swingtown"" is a different experience, but it is still entertaining and worth your time.

It's just what American television needs right now - a fun, and honest show, that's not feminized nor politically correct! Yes, we used to have open sex (pre-aids), smoked a lot of pot, and even worse - cigarettes! For shame...the horror...

CBS must be given a lot of credit for creating, and airing such a bold and creative show. In a time when we're all being brainwashed by all the garbage, and untruths on TV, this must be hailed as the very best show in many years! And in true fashion, it only lasted one, summer season.

Remotes really are handy, aren't they? They have gone to great lengths to make the songs, the clothes, the items around the house and every detail of the show authentic to 1976. We watch it for the nostalgia and the chemistry Tom and Trina have is amazing. Add to that the open exploration of Susan and Bruce (two adults who married young just like my parents) and the chipping away of the ice queen Janet and her goofy but loveable husband Roger and you have a great cast. Knowing how the history went back then leaves so much open for great storylines going into the 80's if the moral majority would get off their high horse and find something else to complain about.

It's about love, relationships, and the importance of honesty.  The sexual exploration is handled without the expected put-downs and mocking.  It's not perfect, fell back on formulas a couple times during the season, but just when you think it will become another ""problems because nobody says whats really going on"" plot, it resurrects itself with honesty, grace, and love.

What initially drew me to this show was my love of the 70's (I was 13 in '76) and Grant Show.

Well, what I thought? was going to be nothing more than Summer fluff, turned into a much more complex, clever, original series.  As a married woman, I can relate to the angst of these couples....as a 13 year old back then, I can also relate to the storylines of the teenagers.

CBS took a huge risk putting this show on and they had a hard time finding sponsors.  That is a shame because the show had literally no more provocative scenes than you see everyday on your daytime soaps.

By the last episode we were completely gripped by this story and emotionally invested in these characters.  It was soooo well written, acted, directed and spot-on as far as the styles, music and the whole depiction of the time.

I was saddened to see it end....however, I am holding out hope that (my favorite show) will be either picked up by CBS or another channel....so we can continue to see how these characters lives unfold.

This show has great scripts, great acting, great sets, and attention to detail the producers have is amazing, down to the products the characters use that don't even exist anymore. But, if you were alive in the day they jump out as if it was yesterday.
The show really started getting interesting in the last few episodes, and the characters really started facing some difficult situations. I can't wait for the second season to start.

3546123,5,B001E6DLK0,"There have been but a handful of television programs about the Seventies exploring a decade that is still not completely understood by the vast majority to this day even while it has become a permanent part of our collective cultural experience - and with good reason. These would include ""The Wonder Years"", ""That 70's Show"", the NBC miniseries ""The Seventies"", ""Swingtown"", and soon, an American adaptation of the BBC's early Seventies time-traveling detective show, ""Life On Mars"". As for movies, two of the more.....seminal films are ""Dazed And Confused"" and ""Boogie Nights"". While the Sixties are held in a certain, somewhat justifiable reverence, the decade following them still doesn't receive all the respect it equally deserves for being a similar witness to profound changes in how many of us view our lives and roles in Western society. The two decades cannot be viewed separately without a loss of understanding as to why they unfolded in the ways that they did. It may be oversimplifying to say that, if the Sixties were the cause, then the Seventies were largely the effect, but there is some truth to that perception; much of the preoccupation with physical, less deep concerns that overflowed well into the Eighties was as a direct result of Vietnam's increasingly unacceptable level of carnage, underscored by Walter Cronkite, David Brinkley and Harry Reasoner's sonorous deliveries on a nightly basis - despite exponentially larger losses of life in the Civil War, as well as both world wars, the spread of television helped death really get up in our faces - and the fundamentally unsatisfying manner in which that conflict ended.

When searching for a word that describes what fueled the late Sixties and Seventies, one frequently referenced is 'exploration' - all that had transpired, from the riots to the assassinations and dehumanizing effect of police actions in Southeast Asia, provoked much soul-searching and a truly ravenous desire to play, lustily reconnect with life after being thoroughly immersed in death for almost a decade. But paradoxically, such indulgences as wife-swapping were really expressions of adult desires to be innocent again. With this exploration inevitably came insight as to the nature of relationships and the aforementioned changes to them. A lot of the soundtrack to this process illuminates it well, but also lays bare the superficial quality accompanying those times. While so much of the music produced in the late Sixties and Seventies was genuinely innovative and diverse, by the mid-Eighties an undeniable ennui and soullessness had crept into it sonically, art imitating life - the new visual medium pushed the societal envelope far more than the sounds being made and MTV thrived for that reason alone. To the ears of many baby boomers - this reviewer's included - the Eighties simply cannot compare to either decade preceding them.

""Swingtown"", more than any other television show focusing upon the Seventies, reveals the underlying forces that altered some long-accepted perceptions about relationships; as has been noted by others, any hedonistic forays in this show act only as a vessel for the characters' journeys to discover intimacy again, as illustrated by how Tom and Trina Decker, swinging throughout, bond in the first-season finale with the prospect of becoming unintentional parents while the marriages of Susan, Bruce, Roger and Janet all seemingly hang in the balance - the underlying message speaking to the value of honesty, about who the Deckers are as people and what they feel free to enjoy; they have never been anything less than communicative. True, there is a distinct danger of portraying their experiences too broadly and glossing over the emotional consequences in particular of these explorations, but such honesty will be what helps all concerned to navigate the very new terrain awaiting them and a nation still young at 200 years.

The cast of ""Swingtown"" features the unsinkable Molly Parker as Susan Miller, Jack Davenport as her husband Bruce struggling to be an effective father and faithful partner, Miriam Shor as earnest, loyal and forthright Janet Thompson - the eventual breakout character whose career path, much to our surprise, fully exposes a strong element of independence and who could potentially become a retroactive icon for women's liberation should the series be given renewed life. Her slightly chauvinistic husband Roger, whose moral bearings have been lost with his job and blurred familial role, is deftly portrayed by Josh Hopkins as, at first feeling less than useful to his family, he inexorably gravitates toward the somewhat emotionally neglected Susan, although she has not effectively communicated the depth of her frustration to Bruce before their relationship degenerates at the Decker's annual end-of-summer beach party on the shores of Lake Michigan. The teenagers in ""Swingtown"" are also on their own, comparatively modest, journeys of exploration - with the possible exception of Laurie Miller, who is growing up much too fast for Bruce to reconcile, further straining his family's bond with him. That this series takes place around Chicago is not entirely surprising; the social aftershocks in question did take a while longer to reach the heartland.....CBS and producer Mike Kelley have a well-written, thought-provoking show (the latter does need to be more diligent about some anachronisms that have snuck into the dialogue and settings; for example, 'no-brainer' first arose in the Nineties and the men's suit lapels should be wider, but those are minor quibbles) that wholly deserves to be renewed for a full second season; in just 13 episodes, the character development has been outstanding and thousands of viewers have been vociferous in their online support of ""Swingtown"" - one petition has garnered almost 6,000 signatures in less than a month. Here's hoping that the Tiffany Network rewards that support.....",1220832000,30,5955,5.286166842661035
3546124,5,B001E6DLK0,"I didn't know what to expect when ""Swingtown"" premiered, but I knew before the first episode aired that many conservatives would be up in arms about the show, causing it to (most likely) be short-lived. I liked the first episode quite a bit, but as the show progressed through the season, I came to realize this is the best series on television. The characters are so diverse and well-developed that you will grow to care about each one of them very quickly. Sure, there is some swinging going on, but it's not gratuitous, and it's barely even there. The most compelling parts of the show are the interactions between all of the characters--within an immediate family, between best friends, between young friends, etc.

I can relate to this show on so many levels, and I really hope that the show will either be renewed by CBS or picked up by a cable network soon. I was only 7 years old in 1976, but I do recognize that the show gets so many elements just right for the era. The songs, clothes, magazines, props, world events, and cultural references all bring back so many memories. Also, as a 7 years married woman, I can relate to many of the situations the characters find themselves in, and these situations are handled in such a classy way that I find it hard to believe anyone could be offended or put off by the show. I can relate to moving into a new area, a new job, and having to make all new friends, as a couple. I can relate to having my best friend move away because her husband had to move for his job. I can relate to loving my husband with all of my heart, but also finding other men attractive - though I'd never act on that impulse. It's nice to have such a relatable show on TV that features characters you actually can care about; a show that doesn't condescend or preach to the viewers. I also think that the writing and acting on ""Swingtown"" are superb, and if the show is given a chance, I think that it could have several Emmy nominations in the future.",1220659200,18,1980,4.380434782608695

I grew up in the 70's and can really relate to the characters and it really took me back. Watching Swingtown makes me realise how Lucky I was to grow up in that era! This show isn't the raunchfest that many conservative groups made it out to be(would have helped if they actually watched the show). The writers did a really great job of making the characters grow as the series went along. I remember that in the first show, I didn't care for Janet, too prissy and stuck up but as the show moved along her character really began to explore her feelings and aspirations and she began to loosen up and now she is my FAVORITE character on the show. The show to me strikes an emotional chord with alot of people who are approaching middle age and ask ""What's It All About"" and it helps to watch these characters that you grow to love go through it and you are rooting for them to find whatever it is they are looking for. I feel it may have been a mistake for CBS to promote the sex so much when the show first started, yes there are some scenes that are risque(though not nearly as risque as what you see on cable), this show is so much more than that, it is about real people and the real problems that they go through in relationships, work and family! I am THRILLED that the series will be released in DVD because Tonight is the VERY LAST EPISODE!!

It was a much simpler time in our lives and the key word was having FUN not turmoil! I don't know about you other fans, but on Friday nights, I feel like I am spending an hour with characters that I personally know! Keep it going CBS!",1220227200,27,340,4.014705882352941

There was just more optimism and fun and mischief in the mid-70s, says Swingtown creator-exec producer Mike Kelley of his desire to hustle down memory lane. It kind of fell apart in the 80s, but for a moment there everything seemed very bright and possible, so I wanted to capture that.  And so he did and many others and I enjoyed it greatly!",1505260800,,616,4.980582524271845
