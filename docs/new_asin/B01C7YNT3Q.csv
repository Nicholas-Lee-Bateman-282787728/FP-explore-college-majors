7673225,2,B01C7YNT3Q,"This workout is boring, more boxing than kickboxing and very repetitive.",1466812800,2,72,5.636363636363637
7673226,5,B01C7YNT3Q,"This is a really great kickboxing workout! I've been doing kickboxing for almost 10 years so I've tried a lot of DVDs, and I really enjoyed this one! I was definitely sweating, and you burn a lot of calories! I wouldn't say this is a beginner DVD, but it's not extremely hard or anything; he does the moves over and over again so you get a lot of practice. There aren't any modifications though, but you can do your own if needed.

The only thing I didn't like was that there was no countdown clock so I didn't know how much time was left. Not a big deal, but I do like it when I can see the time. The instructor is rather annoying too; Im considering muting him the next time I do the workout. 

I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys kickboxing! It is a TRUE kickboxing workout!!!!",1466380800,8,803,4.235294117647059

7673228,5,B01C7YNT3Q,"I started this dvd as soon as I received it. Cuing is excellent, music is motivating and he is engaging. You won't even know it's 60 minutes, it's that good. I just came off Addiction workout where u do one whole side, then the dreaded same moves on other side so this was a delight. Highly recomended.",1464480000,5,302,4.315789473684211
7673229,5,B01C7YNT3Q,"Such a great workout, it was fun and challenging. By the end I was dripping in sweat and felt empowered.",1463788800,4,104,4.25
7673230,5,B01C7YNT3Q,"Holy smokes what a work out! I'm still working my way up to being able to complete the full hour. Definitely not for beginners but if you stick with it you will build your cardio. And Guillermo is so much fun. Keeps the work out fun and I love the ""Spanglish"" he uses throughout. Oh and in case you miss the ""non-stop"" part in the description... It's NON STOP for an hour... Give it a try!",1463443200,16,389,4.131578947368421
7673231,5,B01C7YNT3Q,"This DVD is amazing.  I've worked out to it three times and each time I have blasted over 500 calories, varying from 508 as much as 557.  My heart rate has also been anywhere from 164BPM to 170 BPM with this video.  When I first pushed play, I thought it was kind of lame.  By the time the DVD was over, I was made a believer.  Sensei Gomez is a great motivator in this video and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.  I imagine if you are a very advanced and athletic that it might be easy for you but for me it is precisely what I need.  I also love that my joints do not hurt afterwards.  I will purchase the rest of his DVDs in the near future.",1462147200,22,657,3.9242424242424243
7673232,5,B01C7YNT3Q,"If anyone has ever taken martial arts or a kickboxing class, they should have no problem with this DVD. I love it and I'm 57 yrs old!",1461628800,14,133,3.962962962962963
7673233,5,B01C7YNT3Q,"This is an awesome non-stop cardio workout.  If you enjoy kickboxing, then you'll enjoy this new video from Guillermo Gomez.  He gets your heart rate up and keeps it up through the entire workout. The workout starts with a great warm up, followed by a series of kickboxing punches such as hooks, jabs, upper cuts. Guillermo incorporates a four part choreographed routine with filler combo exercises.  In between learning the rather non-complex choreographed routine, you'll do filler exercises such as jumping jacks, jogging in place, double jacks, squats. I was able to easily modify exercises, for example, the jumping jacks. The variety of exercises keeps the workout from being boring....which can be a problem with repetitive workouts such as kickboxing. I don't like workouts where you repeat the same moves over and over, especially if you have to learn a complex, choreographed routine.  I've done this workout several times now, and boredom hasn't set in.

I consider myself an intermediate exerciser, but my preference is for low impact cardio workouts that are gentle on the joints, but also give you a good cardio workout.  If you're an advanced exerciser, then this video may not be for you.  But if you're a beginner or intermediate exerciser, then I encourage you to give it a try. I like to do a kickboxing workout at least once a week and I've added this to my exercise rotation along with my TaeBo workouts.",1458777600,33,1425,4.937238493723849

7673239,2,B01C7YNT3Q,"I did not like this workout video as Guillermo spends too much time talking as the viewer jogs in place and when we actually do the kickboxing moves they were too short in sequence.  I felt 80% of the workout time was spent jogging in place listening to Guillermo explaining about our next simple moves and only 20% of the workout was actually kickboxing!  This may be fine if you are an absolute beginner to Kickboxing, but I have several other kickboxing DVD's that I love, but this is not one of them so this is going on my local yard sale site.",1486339200,4,548,4.310679611650485

7673243,5,B01C7YNT3Q,"This was video is so much fun! It's not hard at all, just getting in rythym is the trick but that's a personal problem. Enjoyable little workout to get your mind out of the troubles of the day.",1483747200,,193,4.105263157894737
7673244,1,B01C7YNT3Q,"Loved it. Until it stopped. The one time I saw part of it , anyway. Defective DVD, but since I didn't open it until after return window, guess I'm out of luck. Disappointing.",1482105600,,174,4.303030303030303
7673245,1,B01C7YNT3Q,"Looking at the DVD front cover, I'm thinking ""wow"" I want to be like this girl you know, I'm gonna go intense on this exercise, and then when I played it, I see a guy, who's not even that fit for me, and the lay out of the place where they do the exercises isn't that great. I must say , it was a great marketing idea to use the girl on the cover, however, as a consumer, I DON'T want to be FOOLED!! And the exercise wasn't so intense, I could've went to a boxing club and had a great session on my own.",1481932800,2,503,3.8
7673246,5,B01C7YNT3Q,"I'm not at my first Guillermo Gomez DVD, he's easy to follow, great cardio, while getting entertained also, on good music, without feeling exhausted by the end, rather refreshed and looking forward to his next class!",1480636800,,216,5.027777777777778
7673247,3,B01C7YNT3Q,It just wasn't my style of working out. I enjoy routines that flow with good cues and incorporate HIIT. This video seemed like the routine was put together on the fly.,1480204800,,167,4.419354838709677
7673248,4,B01C7YNT3Q,"Definitely not for the advanced exerciser but it's a pretty decent workout for a beginner or someone that has never done kickboxing before.  When I watched it first (which is what I always do before doing the workout), I was thinking it was pretty lame.  However, I did do the workout this morning and was pleasantly surprised that with 1 lb weighted gloves, along with using more intensity, I worked up a decent sweat.  I normally do Amy Dixon Breathless Body, Michelle Dozois Peak 10 and Insanity type workouts, as well as Tae Bo, so I would say I'm fairly advanced. I enjoyed Guillermo's accent and his motivating attitude and the music was pretty decent as far as DVD workouts go.
Pros:
Decent music
Guillermo knows what hes doing and good instruction
60 min is long enough to work up a sweat and get the heart rate up

Cons:
As other reviewers have pointed out, there is not much kicking in this ""kickboxing"" workout.  I would prefer more combos with kicking
Pretty repetitive, I could see this getting boring if I did it often
One of the girls (Monica) to the right of Guillermo seems to be either disinterested, or just cant keep up .  I know this is nit picky, but if you get a DVD where the group members don't appear to care, it's not motivating.  I focused my attention on the girl on his left (Jessica) who seemed enthusiastic and did the moves with correct form.

Overall, I will put this in the rotation for when I need a lighter workout (especially after doing Amy Dixon Tabata three times a week!) I would recommend this for beginners/intermediate level that have not done kickboxing before. I do like Guillermo and would buy another DVD of his if it were more advanced!",1478217600,10,1686,4.541254125412541
7673249,5,B01C7YNT3Q,Got this today.  Just finished doing it.  It's awesome!  Imagine all the hard stuff of kickboxing cardioburn combined with the hard stuff of kickboxing cardiopower for a hour of nonstop moving.  Along with a couple of new moves.  These videos work! Easy to follow. You will see changes if you keep up with it.,1477612800,4,309,4.648148148148148

7673252,1,B01C7YNT3Q,This video is way too long. It doesn't give you the option to work on specific areas i.e. Arms only legs only. No option for a quick workout when your short on time.,1475020800,,165,4.03030303030303

7673254,5,B01C7YNT3Q,"I LOVE IT!  It is a fun nonstop cardio kickboxing workout! I got it yesterday and did it today. This workout put a smile on my face. Guillermo Gomez is an excellent  instructor. He works you hard but he makes it fun. Oh and for the record there are more that just four kicks at the end. There are squats, kicks and variations of jacks as well. He does TIFTT but it is doable. I'm so glad I got this and I'm looking forward to doing it again real soon",1473984000,4,450,3.988888888888889

7673257,4,B01C7YNT3Q,"This is actually a pretty decent workout.  It's fun and sweaty.  Yes, it's somewhat repetitive, but I'm not bothered by that if the workout is otherwise fun.  Guillermo is a very engaging, fun, and interactive instructor.  I imagine what we see on camera is the way he is in person during a live class.  I also have a number of his workouts and always end up smiling even with sweat pouring off of me.  Can't really ask for more than that.  I would put this as moderate to high depending on your fitness level.  I'm 52 and there were a few spots I had to walk a bit but then about a few reps in I was doing them also (like the jumping jacks).  You can always modify, so for those on the fence, don't let that stop you from buying this if it's a concern.",1473033600,4,753,4.102739726027397
7673258,4,B01C7YNT3Q,decent work out...he does keep you moving for the whole 60min....not a hard core workout but a good for a decent sweat,1471564800,,118,4.409090909090909

7673262,3,B01C7YNT3Q,"I LOVE Guillermo's workouts but I have to say this was not my favorite. I was so looking forward to this new video but was less than thrilled when I worked out to it. There seemed to be lots of filler moves and no consistency with putting combinations together, which for me was a disappointment. I like it best when there is an even flow of movement and intensity variations. My all time favorites of his are Kickboxing CardioPower and Hardcore Kickboxing with Janis Saffel.",1467504000,,475,4.6
7673263,5,B01C7YNT3Q,"I've been doing this video for over a week and really like it. I've only done Beachbody videos in the past so wasn't really sure what to expect with this but i'm very happy with it. I have a martial arts background so was looking for something along these lines. I will say that it's very basic punches and kicks so anyone can do it but if you're looking for more advanced moves, this probably isn't for you. I get a great workout with it...i'm sweating at the end every time. The video quality is very good and haven't had any problems with skipping which is more than I can say for some other videos i've used in the past. My only hope she that I end up looking like the chick on the cover....fingers crossed.",1467244800,6,711,4.235294117647059

8752518,5,B01C7YNT3Q,"I love this workout. Guillermo really keeps you on your toes. Yes it is workout that last the whole 60 minutes as if describes. I like it because there's no equipment and no floor work. If I could give it a 10 star rank I would. So if you're ether to lose weight, and want something fun. This is workout DVD for you.",1533600000,,316,4.031746031746032

It was a great workout and his attitude, dialogue, and cueing was better than any other workout I've done. Looking for more from him for sure!",1530144000,,248,4.297872340425532
8752520,5,B01C7YNT3Q,"This is hands down one of the best at-home workouts Ive ever had! Usually Im super picky with workout DVDs because they aren't hard enough, or easy to follow, or something Id want to do more than a few times. This is not one of those. SO awesome. Guiermo has you WORK. Good for guys and women. I usually wear weighted gloves for the added resistance, and this was my first time doing this DVD, but it was definitely challenging and had me sweating buckets, but its so fun all at the same time. Could be a great workout with it without added weight. Highly recommend, a must buy.",1523836800,4,578,4.3119266055045875

8752523,1,B01C7YNT3Q,"I usually listen to reviews on Amazon religiously, sometimes to fault. I did not listen to the bad reviews on this DVD because i so badly wanted a new kickboxing workout. I wish i had.

To start, it's not hard at all, even for a beginner i can't see this helping anyone. You bounce back and forth for 60% of the workout and there is little to no kicking. And the instructor? He drove me insane. I was expecting some kick butt girl like the one on the DVD cover but I was pretty disappointed to find some guy that talked so fast i couldn't understand him. I even fast forwarded the workout trying to find where it got harder and i'm pretty sure it does not.

So if you're looking for 60 minutes of bouncing back and forth with some punches thrown in here and there, you've found the right DVD.",1504051200,3,792,4.203947368421052

8752525,4,B01C7YNT3Q,"Look, it's not real kickboxing. It's cardio kickboxing light. If you want a challenge go do Cathe's Kick Punch and Crunch. All that said, as someone who has done martial arts my whole life and trains in Krav Maga daily, this somehow keeps my heart rate in the 135-145 range most of the hour. Not sure how, but it accomplishes its goal of being an hour of non stop cardio that gets your heart rate up.  Is it hard? No. Will you know how to throw a punch after? No. But his form is correct and it's mindlessly fun.  The two women in the back are terrible and make it more fun for me. What can I say, I'm mean.",1492992000,4,607,4.05
8752526,3,B01C7YNT3Q,It's not as intense as I thought it would be but it keeps my heart rate up and I burn about 500 calories. I mostly do it when it's rainy or if I don't have time to run so I can do it after dark. The moves are simple but I'm completely uncoordinated is I look like an idiot trying to figure it out. The host is a bit annoying and I find myself rolling my eyes at him or flipping him off.,1492732800,,386,3.6626506024096384
