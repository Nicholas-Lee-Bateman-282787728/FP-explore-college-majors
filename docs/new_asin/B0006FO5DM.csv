8041399,4,B0006FO5DM,Just love what he do.....great choreography and it was easy for me to learn. Im a dance teacher and a instructor so the moves were original and easy to follow.,1364688000,,159,4.333333333333333
8041400,2,B0006FO5DM,"This is an amateurish attempt at best.  The promise of dancing like professional pop stars is just that, a broken promise.  The moves are complicated and the videography looks like my little 12 year old nephew did it with our handycam.  Thoroughly unimpressed.",1262736000,,260,5.0
8041401,4,B0006FO5DM,"The dvd was brand new and priced very well. I received the package quickly, even around the holiday season. Would purchase from seller again.",1231718400,,141,4.916666666666667
8041402,5,B0006FO5DM,"I cant critisize this video for being hard - one look at the cover tells you this isn't going to be a walk in the park - its not. This is not for a beginner dancer. I love to freestyle and can dance alone anywhere with total confidence -- but i am a terrible counter and suck as a technical dancer, all to which was very obvious when I tried this video out.

Brian is a great Q-er (cue, que, er) and teacher and gives good direction and tho I am not able to keep up, I can most definately see better dancers than me loving this dvd. It is satsifying in that he go thru part of the routines to some great songs. He's not hard on the eyes either.

If I could do it twice, I wouldn't spend my money on it because I'm just not of the proper caliber to keep up - but the video does what it says it will. It delivers even if you can't :p",1223424000,,831,3.8255813953488373
8041403,4,B0006FO5DM,"The menus give the choice of Play, Chapter selection (welcome, tryouts, training {learning the moves}, performance {before, 5 min show & after}, setup {2 or 5.1 sound sound, subtitles & commentary}, & special features {celebrity interviews, stretch & workout {8 min stretch 10 min abs, back toning workout}
Unlike most DVDs that teach you the moves in a favorite song, Brian does tell you when to kick, which foot, which hand, to scoop, turn around, etc. He doesn't just count like others *cough* Tina Landon *cough* or many others. He also cues YOUR left/right, not his.
This has almost 70 minutes of teaching you the moves for Ashanti's Rock Wit U, Mya's ""My love is like wo"", Britney's ""overprotected"" & Jamiroquai's ""Canned Heat""
Some of the moves are very hard physically, like Jamiroquai's, but Brian's teaching is one of the best I've seen. I suggest you check out the dancing  to see if you can do it first. Some of those moves I can't.
My only complaint is too much wild camera movement to make it look more cool.

You can see info & clip on collagevideo com or look up his name & Freestyle on youtube for clearer clips",1188345600,4,1128,4.635
8041404,5,B0006FO5DM,"Okay. It's pretty difficult for beginning dancers, more for intermediate, but if you're athletic you should be able to learn the moves. I bought this mainly to see Brian and he's really hot, hot, hot, hot, hot on this. He looks great, moves great and the show at the end is spectacular.",1183248000,,286,4.519230769230769
8041405,2,B0006FO5DM,"this is definitely NOT a DVD that I would recommend for beginners.  If you don't have any hip-hop dance experience and hope to learn to freestyle from this, GOOD LUCK.  I couldn't keep up.  If you are a quick choreography learner, you'll love this DVD....as a beginner I was lost and feeling like I was out of my element after 5 minutes.  But as I mentioned before, it was fun to watch!  He's an incredible dancer and watching the audition process was very cool.",1153440000,4,462,4.4523809523809526
8041406,4,B0006FO5DM,"Not only do you learn choreography to songs like Overprotected by Britney and My Love is Like Wo by Mya, you get to see the whole process of audition and preparation to be a dancer for Brian Friedman. There is also interviews with the celebrities he has worked with and an actual warm-up exercise video included. My only problem with the main feature is the mirror-image used to make it. Unlike a video where if the subject spins right you do, everything goes the other way, so you'll have to actually listen and not just watch to get the choreography right.",1148428800,4,558,4.534653465346534
8041407,4,B0006FO5DM,"I bought this DVD for about 11 dollars, and it was worth the money. There are some complaints: 1) Sometimes the sound cuts out on a line that he says. It never seems to be on something important, and I'm not sure what they're editing out, but it's annoying nonetheless. 2) The menus on the DVD aren't very straight forward. Sub-menus galore!

That about sums it up for complaints, though. It's very step-by-step, and the dances that he teaches look great. I haven't checked through all of the special features yet, but the dance instruction alone is enough for me to say it's a good buy. If you want to learn some hip-hop dance moves, this is the way to go.",1132444800,2,657,4.429752066115703
