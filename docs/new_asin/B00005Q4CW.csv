7949724,3,B00005Q4CW,"Not horrible like a lot are saying. It's a pretty good movie to just sit down and watch. I'm a huge fan of Glenn's Bond films, and I wanted to watch it because it was the only other action-spy thrill John Glenn directed after 80s Bond. You'll feel at home with his straightforward approach to making a film; nothing standout or artsy but with really good pacing. Speaking of the pacing, it's lightening fast here. Plot points get brought up and quickly swept aside for the next plot point. At times this can be an issue, like during scenes where the main characters are all celebrating early in the film.

The action isn't spectacular, but it is fast and well staged, with lots of gore, and I mean LOTS. It feels like Glenn's inner-wanting of violence has broken out after being held back by his first three Bonds. That being said, they aren't cut that well, from someone getting shot transitioning to the effects of their injury. This feels quite late 90s-early 2000s TV movie, but not to the point of ruining the action. Like the pacing and shots, the action feels very John Glenn.

The acting is a mixed bag, with Lambert being hard to understand at many times, as others have pointed out. In his Bond films, Glenn always seemed like he paid most attention to Bond and the villain, as they always turned out excellent, while supporting characters, including the Bond girls, didn't usually give the best performances (Tanya Roberts, anyone?). Here, it feels like Licence to Kill, where the side characters are pushed away terms of direction. I've read that Glenn wasn't known as being an actor's director, and you can see that here. Glenn only cares about his main character, the important supporting case, and his villain. Speaking of the villain, he's one of the ebst things in the film. He;s very memorable, evil, and ruthless about his objective. Main cast is done well One last thing, you may remember Bond girl Myriam d'Abo from The Living Daylights in this film.

The soundtrack itself is pretty good but not really used very well. I'm honestly probably the only one who noticed this, but the film uses tracks from the PlayStation game Delta Force: Urban Warfare (check it out BTW, it's a fantastic FPS game!) and a sound-cue from the first Nintendo 64 Castlevania game (which is REALLY overused towards the end of the film, to the point of being eye-roley... BTW, check out Castlevania for the N64 too, great game as well). In the games, these tracks were used exceptionally well, and made the aciton in the games very pounding. Here, not so much. Great tracks, underutilized.

I really enjoyed the film. From it's straightforward directing, the decent acting, the interesting story, and the good action. The thing I love about Glenn's films is that his main goal is making a super entertaining film, while doing his best with the drama that he's handed in the screenplay (Licence to Kill is his perfect combination of this). It's not a world-changer, but it's better than most make it out to be. It was a small budget (about $6 million), and it does feel like a TV movie. But now, at a dirt cheap price on DVD, I feel like there's a place for The Point Men. A fan of John's Bond films? You'll love the Point Men!",1445212800,,3223,4.63922942206655
7949725,2,B00005Q4CW,"Just another B-action flick starring Christopher Lambert.  I didn't expect much, but some names on the cover interested me; they were co-starring Kerry Fox (""Shallow Grave"" and ""Intimacy""), and the director John Glen, who is behind the camera of James Bond films made in the 1980s (from ""For Your Eyes Only"" to ""Licence to Kill"").  Not that I mean his works are great -- Roger Moore played Bond at that time, and good as he was, the actions were not particulary great.  But Kerry Fox is another matter.
The result is just what I expected, and I don't blame anybody for spending 90 minutes on my life for this ... one.  Lambert is a kind of member of secret team who seem to deal with assassination of terrorists.  But the team, though apparently successful in killing the target, made a botched job afterwards, losing some of the members, and then they are forced to disband themselves.  However, Christopher Lambert's character is not convinced that their target is dead, and the ex-members of his team, now hiding with another identity, get bumped off one after another.
The story is so-so, and the acting is not bad.  Kerry Fox is called even fabulous among them, raising the below-average action flick to a little higher place.  But the cheap action scenes and tedious development of story kill every good thing in the film.  The relation between Lambert and Fox -- they were once lovers, and Fox is pregnant even though she is hired by the secret agency -- is very interesting, but the film throws away any potential thrills coming from the characters so easily that I wondered how the original book deals with those elements.  Perhaps, the original book (which I haven't seen) is better than this film.
Christopher Lambert made a satisfactory films in the past, like ""Knight Moves"" and others, but around the time of ""Highlander 2"" or ""The Hunted"", I began to lose interest in his films, and I'm sorry to say this, but things don't change after watching this awful flick.  This film is far better than ""Fortress 2"", but like Pam Grier in that dreadful film, Kerry Fox is wasted.",1041379200,3,2084,4.7134986225895315
7949726,3,B00005Q4CW,"If you are a Lambert fan (like me), then you'll be surprised by his performance in this movie.  It ranks up with Mortal Kombat in films he actually pulls off well.
However, if you're looking for a good story, stick with Highlander.",1029024000,6,231,4.5
