Jenny plans to be beautiful when she grows up. [What about her character?] Is wanting the richest man a formula for trouble? A rich man talks to Jennys father in the tavern. Is Jenny like her mother?

Does she need a rich husband? Money changes everything she says. She learns how to set a table. Then its church on Sunday. People look at Jenny Hager in church. [Gossip?]

The minister asks for funds to enlarge the church. No volunteers. He warns his parishioners about the bad effects of the grog shops along the waterfront. Jenny pledges $1,000 to the fund, others follow her example. Jenny hates grog shops and what they do to people. Ephraim returns home. What can a fashionable architect do in a rough boom town? Build houses for the rich? Jenny helps a poor sick woman. Later Jenny talks about what could have been done to Ephraim. Jenny spends money. Ephraim plans to go to Boston, but his father wants him to help in his business. Father falls ill, they send for a doctor. The idle season brings lumberjacks and trouble to town. There is a riot in town, they need a police force. [No mention of a militia?]

A barmaid is blamed for missing money, $100 is the mans winters work. Drink drives men mad. [An argument for Prohibition?] Jenny helps that barmaid and offers her old house. Mr. Poster will get well. Those lumberjacks seek adventure in their idle time. There is a funeral for the judge. Jenny helps another family. Isaiah hears about the timber pirates who are stealing his trees. He will go there in person with his son. Ephraim doesnt want to go. Jenny, don't talk like that! She threatens Ephraim. The canoe upsets in the river rapids! Lets go! What happened? He stood up in a canoe. They didn't find the body.

Jenny now rejects Ephraim! Jenny selects a new superintendent to run the lumber camp. Ephraim was seen drunk. There is no competition from steamships as long as water freezes into ice; railroads are a different matter. Jack visits Ephraim, who drinks and talks. Jack takes Jenny to meet Ephraim, but Ephraim won't talk to her. Their horses sun off, they must spend the night in that cabin. Jack found the horses the next morning but the carriage needs mending. Jenny tells Meg what happened. Jack arrives. Jenny wants to be happy but she cant have children. A preacher comes to town to warn people against sin.

Are people unable to recognize sin and its resultant evils? Was this story meant s an argument for Prohibition? [I think Maine first prohibited alcohol in the early 19th century but the law was later changed.] Are some people born bad or does this result from their character, formed by their experiences or environment? Human nature or error is ever with us. Does Posters home seem too refined for this frontier land?",1473638400,,3132,4.636036036036036
8123919,5,B000FKO3CG,I enjoy watching Hedy Lamarr ever since I watched Samson and Delilah. She was a great looking woman and a fine actress. Strange Woman is the better of the 2 movies. Even though the movie is old and is in black and white it was very pleasant to watch.,1207526400,2,250,4.122448979591836
