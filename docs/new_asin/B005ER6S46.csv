4667002,4,B005ER6S46,"The performances are natural and feel organic. They fit well with the meandering pace and tone. I've read a handful of reviews state that the film is almost dream-like. That seems pretty spot on. The style reminds me a lot of Blue Caprice. There is a story there, but the director seems more concerned with setting a mood and watching the characters. It works when that is the case. Really well actually. Not so much when the film feels the need to service the plot involving a stolen gun, which sometimes feels forced, but ultimately the message is there.

Regardless, this is an engaging, beautiful, thoughtful and confident film and I look forward to seeing what else everyone involved works on next.",1395878400,12,703,4.762295081967213

4667005,1,B005ER6S46,"I love horror movies, but this is just slow and dull. I'm only twenty minutes in and I realize they are trying to build a plot of suspense by paying tribute to scream and halloween. The problem with this movie, is that it's trying to merge two ideas and just uhk, can't get the job done. The plot is stupid, the lines are stupid and well, everything about this movie is stupid at this point. If I make it to the end before dying of sheer boredom that will be nothing short of a pure miracle. I don't like this. I get the idea that you are supposed to not really know anything about the victims, but couldn't the idea be developed a little more? I have never seen a movie centered on one night. Actually, I take that back. I watched a movie called 13 and it was about a thirteen year old girl who was left home alone while a serial killer was in her neighborhood. Two men show up at her door and she has to figure out which of them is the killer. That movie was really good and original. That was a psychological thriller with a twisted ending, beautifully done. It has the same premise as a slasher, plenty of blood was spilled but the brilliance of a mind at work. This movie seems like the mind is sitting there catching ideas as the plot goes along. Boring, boring, boring.",1362528000,3,1276,4.2122448979591836
4667006,2,B005ER6S46,"The movie has a typical scary soundtrack, barking dogs, teen girls being spied upon, and ""Scream"" style phone calls, but it doesn't work well. They are put together badly as in ""Scary Movie"" badly but it isn't funny as it doesn't spoof any particular movie. I was asking myself, ""Is this supposed to be funny or scary?"" because it was neither. There are some jerky hand held camera scenes for no apparent reason... and a dog that barks at random.

This is the one year anniversary of a Halloween night murder, whose killer was never caught. The teens are at home under curfew in the town of Chesterfield. Matt O'Neill plays Matt a bad actor and bad boyfriend to the cute  actress Chrissy Anderson. Lisa Younger plays Suze, another cute teen hobbling around on a crutch. She is the main character and handles her lines well. Jarett Del Bene plays Ryan, Suze's boyfriend who has another girl on the side (Kristina Plisko). Scooter (Adrian Gaeta) is the creepy friend who wants Suze, but then what guy doesn't. Jamison Brandi, is the director, writer, producer, and film editor. He is also in the film (Down in front!). Not very well done. You see a person with a knife, another person cowering, then that same person on the floor dead. You never see any killing special effects.

4667008,4,B005ER6S46,"I think that overall the film is shot quite well, and I love how the director made the decision to play out beats longer than your traditional drama. I also love that the producer allowed the director to do so. That all being said this movie is slow and incredibly character driven--it isn't for everyone. You have to be in the mood for such a movie to enjoy it, and I quite enjoyed it. I think that they captured the children very well. They were incredibly nuanced.

4667009,2,B005ER6S46,"I read a review of this film years ago and once I became a Prime member I decided to give it a try. It tells the story of two young brothers and how they cope with the mysterious death of  a younger friend. It plods along, the older brother Eric an his buddies have daily wrestling matches and Eric's friend Tristan is contemplating suicide which angers Eric. Nothing is resolved by film's end and that's what infuriated me. Seeming like the writer director ran out of ideas. The younger brother Tommy never finds out how his friend Ian died it presents itself as a mishmash of ideas and simply ends. Very disappointing.",1467417600,,620,4.535714285714286

My only criticism is that I wish the story was a little more developed, however I think there was a method to the director's madness.

4667018,1,B005ER6S46,"I REALLY hate writing bad reviews, (I suppose a part of me pictures the poor kids who made this attempt going through and reading these reviews) but flicks such as these deserve some sort of warning. As a rule, I generally have these B rated horrer flicks playing in the background as I do housework and laundry, (so I don't feel a complete waste of time, or hours of my life have been robbed of me when I sit through disastrous attempts such as these). The MOST annoying aspect (out of the MANY) was the dog barking reel (that in some scenes actually cut in mid bark, making it sound like a keyboard button being pressed by a bored toddler) only it didn't have a variety of pitches, so either 1. Every person in this movie had the SAME DOG running from house to house to warn of the attacker, 2. Everyone lived on the same street and they all share one dog, or 3. The attacker brought his own dog to all of the houses. In any case, It's REALLY annoying. I LOVE the rare film that makes me put the laundry down and reels me in to the point where I feel lucky to have the free attempts to find diamonds in the rough, but flicks like this just make me wonder how these movies slip through. I'm tempted to have my kids film something to see if they can get it released on here.",1454716800,5,1274,4.161943319838056

It takes some patience to see the beauty of the spare language and the quiet nature of the entire film. Persistence rewards. The characters of the two main protagonists are revealed very slowly over the entire film. The unvarnished truth about death, for several characters, plays out. Suicide, grief, and the value of life is a subtext of the story from the perspective of adolescence. The landscape is lush and adds so much to the film. It's like a character in and of itself. There's no big reveal here, only a slow acceptance of reality as boys take the next step in growing up one raw summer.",1422748800,,695,4.658536585365853

4667062,4,B005ER6S46,"It's pretty basic really: either you're the kind of person who will process this viscerally and will conceptually understand a film such as Hide Your Smiling Faces (filled with such beauty as only very few will grasp) or you will just...not...get it. There are sheer moments of awe with the breathtaking cinematography and thus those backdrops of natures rich pageantry which just ignite your senses, which is spectacular. There are several scenes where the director really pushes the envelope on many issues, which is noble, but does so elegantly. (ones that speak mountains but the filmmaker never goes there) The subtle nuances of boys lives in a summer with gorgeous scenes of water dripping off skin radiantly; is truly exhilirating. (like hundreds of thousands of other boys summers all over the globe)...the scene that is used as the cover art, with the two brothers on the bike, though seemingly rushed and nearly, nearly, over acted, sums up entirely the pace and the voice of the film in the silence of nature, where everything is real, surreal and ignored all really simultaneously.

Though much of the film seems very staged and the acting is sub par in many scenes, its not hard to NOT pick out flaws, because there is hardly any dialog. I am sure many moments of the film would have been more tender (not that they weren't), if the director let the boys ad-lib, or go with the scene their own way. Perhaps they did, but it felt too choreographed, too schooled.

The natural beautiful boys come alive brilliantly with the cinematography with breathtaking shots that linger, and hold your thoughts. A simple score plays well against the simple film. I wish I would have created this as its profound enough in its simplicity, yet clearly powerful with its many, many messages. It is worth multiple views in my opinion, as it touches on so much NOT touched upon, you may in fact miss it the first time around.",1419638400,4,1919,4.794561933534744

Then one of their friends suffers a tragedy and the whole dynamic of the never ending summer shifts on its axis. The synopsis says they challenge 'their relationships, the mystery of nature and their own mortality' - and they do, but this is so subtle that you could just see a random collection of scenes.

I watched this over a week before writing this as I was not sure if it was an art house fail or a subtle and artful piece of film making that deliberately made you think about what was happening behind the faade of the on screen action. I am now inclined to consider it to be the latter.

Some of the scenes are pure art and display a level of intimacy that must have been hard to illicit from such a young cast (and they are not really brothers). There are moments of tension breaking aggression and others of laid back drowsiness. The dialogue is minimal, which means that you do listen when things are said and it is the time given to build up to such outburst that lets you consider the thought process that led to them. Yes it is very subtle, yes it is arty and actually after much reflection, yes it is actually a very good piece of film making.",1416009600,2,1287,4.33609958506224
4667125,3,B005ER6S46,"Ill be honest. I gave this a shot based on all the reviews talking about Malick-style visuals and storytelling. Being a big Malick fan (especially Tree of Life) I decided to give it a go. While its important to make the comparison afterwards and let the film speak on its own (which I did), the Malick-influence does indeed stand out strongly. And even though the long shots and facials aren't used with the perfection in Tree of Life, the style still captures an emotional beauty that isn't seen very often.

Hide Your Smiling Faces is a meandering story about two brothers facing tragedy and growing up in a small neighborhood. Looking at it closely, theres a lot to love: moments of gorgeous cinematography, little character interactions, and some well-built suspense. There are some poor moments too: subpar acting at times, poor editing and some of the sound mixing. Looking at the film as a whole makes the pacing feel random, some of the long shots are out of place, and combined with some of the smaller issues, the film ends up falling a little short.

Nevertheless, there are some good moments for study, and it is an impressive feature-debut from director Daniel Patrick Carbone.",1415577600,,1190,4.828431372549019

4667153,3,B005ER6S46,"Tribeca Film Festival movies tend to be very hit or miss with me. With Hide Your Smiling Faces, I loved the plot, but when the movie dragged, it really dragged. In the end, I kept watching in hopes of learning the truth about the friend's death.

Brothers Tommy (Ryan Jones) and Eric (Nathan Varnson) find their lives changed when Eric and his friend find Tommy's friend's body. This untimely death raises many questions about life, death, and grief in this coming of age film.

There is a bit of a mystery involving the death. The boy's father seems to be abusive, but is he really? Did the boy commit suicide? Was it simply an accident?

Filmed in New Jersey, the movie's setting came off as being very rural Vermont to me. I had to stop and look up the setting because it was so familiar. I loved the sleepy feel of the town, but did question why the parents didn't question the boys comings and goings more often. In one scene, they stay out all night after a family argument. As a parent, I would have been beside myself trying to find where my kids were when they didn't come home. Even in a small town, I'd be tracking my kids down.

In the end, this movie probably raises more questions than it answers. I don't mind a movie that makes you think, and this one does just that, but in this case, I'd really hoped for more of a definitive ending.",1414368000,6,1351,4.349206349206349

4667181,5,B005ER6S46,"The film begins in nature, opening with a shot of a snake devouring a fish whole. It doesnt take more than a minute or two to realize Hide Your Smiling Faces is an atmospheric film more concerned with creating feelings and ideas than a logical narrative. It succeeds tremendously.

Hide Your Smiling Faces has early scenes of kids out in the wild, which reminded me of The Kings of Summer. Theres naturalism to both films, which allows the viewer to feel like they're really in the woods, not in a movie. However The Kings of Summer became more movie-like as it went on, while Hide Your Smiling Faces continues to feel real yet also more spiritual. Its calm and balletic like the films of Matthew Porterfield, Apichatpong Weerasethakul and Terrence Malick.

Hide Your Smiling Faces wanders through transformative moments from childhood, without a particularly discernable narrative. Its literally just shifting from moment to moment. I emphasize the word choice of shifting rather than jumping, as I completely understood where Carbone was taking me and why we moved from scene to scene. I cant explain why intellectually, I just felt it. Carbone has described this approach saying that the film is not about the childhood you're remembered for, like school plays or sports awards, but those strange, specific moments that you remember from childhood.

Some scenes include two brothers in a boat talking about death, roughhousing a little too much, and talking about a local tragedy with their parents. Theres nothing particularly special about the moments they choose to show in a grand sense, they're special to a specific person at a specific time. The success of Hide Your Smiling Faces comes from its masterful command of sound, image and rhythm to convey that specialness to the viewer. This is a debut similar to, but not quite at the level of,  Benh Zeitlins Beasts of the Southern Wild or Sean Durkins Martha Marcy May Marlene.  While the technical elements feel carefully crafted by an experienced and highly skilled filmmaker, the film is limited by so-so acting.

I wouldnt quite call this a gem, like Beasts or Martha, but its damn close. Its one of the most impressive films Ive seen this year and I cant wait to see what Carbone does next.

4667184,2,B005ER6S46,"I tried numerous times to push through to the end but I failed. That should tell you a lot. I rarely do that.

It did that for a long while. I really enjoy nonlinear stories but this was more of a parallel line situation, with little explained in either line, and no investment conjured up within in either line.
