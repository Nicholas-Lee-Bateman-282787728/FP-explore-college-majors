Filled with heart, guts, and other body parts, this zombie flick goes above and beyond any of its counterparts at 10 times its budget. It's smart without being meta, funny without being a parody of itself, and endearing in a way that makes you want to befriend the filmmaker and beg them to make more flicks.",1486339200,,398,4.541666666666667
8293141,1,B001DF687K,"So terrible that I couldn't watch more than ten minutes of it. Too bad Amazon doesn't offer a ten minute back out refund policy.  I think the people who filmed this gave it 5 stars. Total crap, seriously. Terrible acting, terrible lines, terrible camera work.  It was as if the movie was filmed with an old Razor cell phone. Money wasted.",1486080000,,338,4.524590163934426

8293143,5,B001DF687K,"this is definetely one of my favorite independent movies. honestly i found this out of nowhere because of it's amazing soundtrack (including bullet for my valentine, in this moment...). no one seems to know this movie even exist which makes it pretty underrated. the movie's basically about this socially awkward guy crushing on this girl from a totally different social class, but the girl winds up losing her life leading to the guy going beyond extreme measures to bring her back to life. it gets pretty depressing seeing how much he loves the girl when she seems incapable of expressing any emotion due to her new condition. i say atleast give it a chance.",1383955200,,660,4.798245614035087
8293144,5,B001DF687K,"For a movie with an obvious low budget and actors and actresses who are trying to cut themselves a place in show business, it was a really good movie. I enjoyed the storyline, I enjoyed the actors and actresses. I do not believe that any of the other reviews were plants at all. Anyone who understands going into this movie that it is a Z-list movie and was done with a bare bones budget will enjoy it. Definitely for zombie fans who enjoy a good plot.",1264896000,,452,4.267441860465116

8293146,5,B001DF687K,Just got my copies and would recommend it to anyone with a taste for good horror/comedy.  Me my buddies were laughing our butts off on scenes. (i.e. the pharmacy)  This movie doesnt try so hard as to make it lame. Just the right recipe to make it great. It's highly entertaining.  Overall a rad movie.,1223424000,,301,4.4363636363636365
