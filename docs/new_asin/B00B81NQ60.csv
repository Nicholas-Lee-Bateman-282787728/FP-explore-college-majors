5562400,4,B00B81NQ60,"This movie is definitely different than most movies you see, I can promise you that. It goes in a number of different directions but overall I enjoyed it.",1362700800,2,154,4.535714285714286
8563802,1,B00B81NQ60,This is the worst vampire movie ever; definitely not worth the $15 I paid.  The actors pictured on the jacket cover are not even in the movie.  The acting is so bad is not even laughable.  I can't even give this move away.,1444435200,,222,4.116279069767442
8563803,1,B00B81NQ60,"This movie is terrible. The film quality is bad, the storey line is bad, the writing is bad and the acting is bad. Not much else to say about this one.",1401235200,,151,3.903225806451613
8563804,1,B00B81NQ60,"Oh my god, how bad is bad? this bad! Cheap and cheesy ( which can be fun sometimes) but not here. Awful acting, terrible directing, ridiculous sets. the special effects, not very special. These awful actors try for irish accents but sound nowhere near irish. I'm not sure I can do zero stars....that is the honest truth. the ""beautiful"" woman...is old and so very unattractive. Serious casting problems here.",1396137600,,408,4.927536231884058
8563805,2,B00B81NQ60,"Maybe I am missing something, but this is a really low budget whacked film.  I wish I had not bought it.",1383955200,,104,3.9523809523809526
8563806,4,B00B81NQ60,"This is an interesting looking film if you're into arty,trippy creepy looking stuff its similar in some ways to Valerie and her week of wonders. Give it a go its quite good for a low budget film.",1382745600,,195,4.297297297297297
8563807,2,B00B81NQ60,"At best it occassionally rises to mediocracy, but this is quite the ""non-starter"".  I tried watching it several times a few weeks ago and kept falling asleep.  Have just one or two memories of the film of several people standing around a table and talking - if this is what you want to recall from watching it then by all means buy and try it.  Yet I do not believe you will enjoy the experience.  Try some of the older Hammer films instead.",1375315200,,441,4.27710843373494
8563808,5,B00B81NQ60,"An odd combination of folklore not usually seen thrown together in one movie, & it totally works! This is so incredible! Modern classic status for sure. Pick your poison--vampires, fairies, etc. and it's in here somewhere. And somehow it all makes sense.",1374969600,3,254,5.071428571428571
8563809,5,B00B81NQ60,Philomene Long is absolutely mesmerizing.  The film smolders with irresistable pathos and sensual tension.  This is a unigue offering beyond genre.  Excellent film making.  Destined to become a classic.,1369094400,3,202,5.862068965517241
8563810,5,B00B81NQ60,"The best movie since the Lumairre brothers! They saw the magic that can be done with film  and so does Pegarty Long. Her film is magical! This is a film with magic and vampires. A must see film.

8563811,5,B00B81NQ60,"Amazing, spell-binding. Mysterious. Like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, this film brings you inside its strange world of reality and doesn't let you go. It's campy. Original and perfect.  Millicent Borges Accardi",1367798400,3,210,5.5625
