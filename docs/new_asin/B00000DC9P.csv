7905855,5,B00000DC9P,"This videotape offers on of my favorite episodes of ""The Lucy Show"" with ""Lucy and John Wayne"" (#120 November 21, 1966).  Mary Jane is working at a movie studio and invites Lucy to lunch where they run into John Wayne.  Mary Jane then fixes it so Lucy can watch the Duke at work on his latest movie, where she causes a barroom brawl that destroys the set and knocks the Duke out.  This episode is even funnier than Wayne's classic appearance on ""I Love Lucy"" a decade earlier (which is also available on tape).  Then we have ""Lucy the Fight Manager"" (#130 February 20, 1967), a below average episode that has Lucy managing a fighter played by Don Rickles who wants to retire and open a flower shop.  Ball and Rickles just do not click together, which is even more obvious after seeing the perfect relationships Lucy enjoyed the Duke in the previous episode.  Finally, we have ""Lucy and Tennessee Ernie Ford"" (#131 February 27, 1967), which features a visit from the popular country star who had been on three first-rate episodes of ""I Love Lucy"" over a decade earlier.  Ford plays country singer Homer Higgins, who has just become a star and is now the targeted by Lucy and Mr. Mooney as a new customer for the bank (If this sounds a lot like ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" you are not the only one who thinks so). This episode ends with the bank throwing on a big barn dance to make their financial institution seem like home to Homer.  So you end up with two classic episodes of ""The Lucy Show"" and sub-standard effort on this tape.  Milton Berle introduces these episodes and the tape includes the trailer for Lucy and Desi's movie ""The Long Trailer.""",994809600,,1650,4.547297297297297
