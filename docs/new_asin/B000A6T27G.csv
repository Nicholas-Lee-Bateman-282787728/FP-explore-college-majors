2368341,5,B000A6T27G,"The premise was simple: do the same thing as MTV's ""The Real World,"" but instead of using real people, use Pikachu, Superman, Betty Boop, Link (from the Zelda games), a generic Disney princess, and so on, and parody everything from M.C. Escher to drug addiction to Chinese sweatshop labor along the way. Taking the idea behind the Joe Schmo Show (""a reality series that's not real"") one step further, this show broke every rule and turned the television multiverse on its head. How can a show without one original idea possibly be this unique and fresh? Though it occasionally relied on cheap shock tactics instead of real humor, its willingness to go ""too far"" helped to make it both addictive and unfathomably funny. This is the completely untrue story of seven cartoon characters picked to live in a house, not work together, and have their lives scripted, to find out what happens when people stop being real... and start being...

From what I understand, there will only be 7 of the 8 episodes from season 1 in this set, because one episode was not aired. It poked fun at Christopher Reeves, who had recently passed away so was understandably not shown. It will be aired as part of season 2 instead.

2368476,2,B000A6T27G,"The show started off with alot of promise.  It was a novel idea at the time of its inception.  A bunch of archetypal cartoon characters stuck together in a house like those typical trashy MTV reality shows.  I like the fact that all the cartoon characters were basically the ultimate degeneration of their type.  Clara, the typical Disney Princess, who sings, is followed by woodland critters and has an innocent streak is now the extreme version: a racist, white, spoiled, deluded, psycho-b-tch.  The only problem was the show turned into one long homo-erotic fantasy.  Instead of focusing on the interesting cartoon stereotypes, all the characters turned into a one note gay orgy.  FoxyBrown is busy getting down with Princess Clara or with Clara's retarded cousin.  Woodor, Xandir, Spanky and Captain Hero use any excuse on the show to start having gay sex with one another or all together.  Like them spinning the bottle and then having to tongue kiss eachother.  Gross!",1407024000,,974,4.9937888198757765

2368539,3,B000A6T27G,"I really struggled with whether to give Drawn Together Season One three stars or four stars.

On the positive side, the idea is innovative: eight stereotypical cartoon characters are forced to live together and interact with each other. This leads to some genuinely funny situations and personality clashes. Some of my favorite moments include Princess Clara's Disney-style songs and the gay Xandir's ""never-ending quest to save his girlfriend/boyfriend.""

But there are times when the efforts to get a laugh simply go too far. I stopped laughing when '20s Sex Symbol Toot developed problems with self-mutilation, bulimia, and anorexia (all fodder for humor) and when Princess Clara started French-kissing her father. That was just gross.

I'm not sorry that I watched the series, because parts of it were genuinely clever and pushed boundaries in a good way. In the end, however, a few too many episodes left a sour taste in my mouth. I'm not planning to be on board for Season Two.",1395792000,,983,5.055555555555555

2368697,5,B000A6T27G,"Like most people, I was first exposed to the animated comedy Drawn Together because it came on immediately after South Park every Wednesday and Thursday night.  At first I wasn't sure what to expect.  It LOOKED really good, and my first reaction was that it was just filler, and 30 minutes used to fill up space after South Park.

However, time can change opinions.  Approaching this show with open arms and a willingness to accept the crude, disgusting humor, I was pleasantly surprised to find the show is actually really good.  I can see why it's been hanging around for years now.  There's something really appealing about the style of humor and the fun, wild animations.

I'd say the animations are only second to the Simpsons.  In fact, the overall goofiness, bright colors, and clean, polished animation reminded me of the Simpsons immediately.  Drawn Together is a really good show to watch.  I love how unpredicable the storytelling is as well.  You see, you have all sorts of characters, and they each have their own personality.  Of course, you could say ALL comedy shows have characters with their own special personalities, but in this case, it's EXTREMELY true.  Each character is totally different from the other ones.  The characters are exciting overall.

I'm also a really big fan of the way the stories and jokes can veer off in a completely funny/strange direction in a split second.  Each episode is filled with little bits of humor and you can't possibly get bored searching for all of it.

This is NOT a cartoon for children.  Let me state that right now.  The storylines feature WAY too many sexual and disgusting bits for anyone under the age of 12 to watch.  The style of humor seems to be influenced from Family Guy, and I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the writers are big fans of Family Guy as well.  However, the bright colorful animation is closer to the Simpsons.

I love this show and would recommend picking up this DVD set for your viewing pleasure.  It's not for everyone, but anyone who admires unpredictable storytelling with plenty of adult humor should appreciate this.",1195084800,4,2117,4.771349862258953

If you are offended by social taboos (and some things that are nearly mainstream), you will not like this show. Beyond that disclaimer, I won't spoil the episode plots. :-)

Once you get past the taboo, there are quite a few funny moments in the show. Where this DVD falls down miserably is the fact that it is extremely poorly implemented. The episodes are split between two DVDs, where they could fit into one. The audio is only stereo, not Dolby 5.1, which is the norm for any series DVD set made in the past five years.

2368703,4,B000A6T27G,"There are so many animated comedies out there and a lot of them seem to follow the formula laid down so brilliantly in 'The Simpsons'. It was high time somebody came along and shook up the ideas a little bit and presented us with something fresh and alternatively funny.

'Drawn Together' is not the sort of show you would watch with a refined aunt or grandmother. Its humour is crude, offensive, grotesque and incredibly funny.

Eight characters from the cartoon world are living together in a 'Big Brother' style reality show. Some times they get on, sometimes they kill each other and occasionally the producers throw in a twist to stir things up. It's a great parody of the state of reality TV shows today.

This first season boxset (one originally intended first episode is held back for season two due to some rather unfortunate timing with real-life events) is seven episodes of shocking comedy which doesn't fall down at any moment.

The wonderful thing about non-politically correct humour is its sense of irony and post-modernism. Anyone who becomes offended through watching it is obviously missing the point. As mentioned in one of the commentaries, the racism portrayed in the show is mocking stupidity about race.

This is a two disc set of great humour with a smattering of special features including some clips of other Comedy Central shows.

Each episode is complete and uncut and there are karaoke and singalong versions of the songs too.

Despite loving this series, I have only given the set four stars because it falls down in one department; the commentaries are headache inducing!  It doesn't seem that anyone is there as a moderator and everyone shouting at each other at once is awful to listen to.

Apart from that... a wonderful purchase.

His heavy reliance on shock value and toilet ""humor"" has never made me laugh.

The idea behind the show isn't bad.  With decent writers, a parody of reality television could be very witty and original.

  This the first animated reality show ever. Here a list of the cast of characters:

  Wooldoor is a wacky, winsome whatchamacallit that is desperate to entertain and desperate to be liked. He can morph, split in two and basically become any profession he needs to be. The one thing he can't become is anybody's friend because he is really freakin' annoying

  Xandir is a video game warrior on a never-ending quest to save his ""girlfriend(Boyfriend)."" Xandir is adventurous and daring and his special skills have made him a household name on levels Chelsea and West Hollywood.

  Foxxy Love is Promiscuous, melodious, and possibly infectious, Foxxy Love is a sexy, sassy, tambourine-wielding mystery solving musician. Quick to pick up the case and even quicker to drop her drawers, she's every man's fantasy and every criminal's worst nightmare.

  Princess Clara is A naive fairytale princess with a penchant for conveying her emotions through song. Clara has never been permitted to venture beyond the castle walls until now. She sings like an angel but spews racist bile like a Southern Congressman. So with the help of the Drawn Together cast, she's learning a lot about the world... also she's pretty hot.

  Spanky Ham comes straight from the Internet, where he loiters outside porn sites. Nothing is off limits to this foul-mouthed pig that loves doody, boobies, retards and stirring up trouble amongst his roommates. He's insensitive and prone to urinate in and on public places.

  Toot Braunstein is A full-figured, black and white heartthrob from the thirties. Toot is sweet on the surface, but a manipulative b---h underneath. She's jealous of the thinner girls in the house because they get all the attention and they're in color. In her world, she was a much beloved sex-symbol, but now she's just an outdated fat dump.

  Captain Hero is A vain, misogynistic Superhero who is fast to fight the forces of evil and even faster in the sack -- it's a problem he's working on.

2368768,5,B000A6T27G,"There's a lot about this show that's great besides the jokes and situations.  This show is a perfect example of how animation styles have varied over the years and across continents.  Each character is representative of a type of genre/style, and they are not simply ""drawn together"" in the style of the animators or creators.  Instead, each character stays true to his or her ""origin"".  Ling-Ling, for example, always exhibits the slightly jerky movements so common in Anime.  Foxy Brown even has the virtually undetailed eyes that so many cartoons in that genre did.  Spanky also has those great thick outlines and super bright colors you'd expect from an internet flash cartoon.

Aside from the high quality and attention paid to (most likely unnoticed) detail, the jokes are hilarious.  Sometimes they're predictable.  Other times, they come out of left field.  The whole thing is a beautiful satire on the sorry state of television (when in the world will the reality shows just go away?!) and just how addictive these poorly conceptualized shows can be for many people.

If you enjoy a good fart joke or two, then this is the show for you.  If not, then steer clear, because fart jokes are about as tame as it gets with ""Drawn Together"".

We have a Betty Boop type, a super hero, a Disney-style princess, a video game hero (looks like the star of Elf Quest), a Japanese Toy cartoon, an obscene internet download character, a mystery-solving musician (Josie and the Pussycats style), and a crazy wacky something or other.  Together they manage to get on one another's nerves and reveal or discover truths about themselves.

I was a little put off by some of the things done to the Boop character right at the start but the first song had me seeing the real talent behind this parody.  One can only guess how far this series can go.  This is definitely not for children and gives South Park a run for language while the visuals go far beyond into what many would label as obscene.

It's bad taste comedy all the way that certainly isn't for everyone who considers themselves anything near sophisticated, but for what it's worth, Drawn Together is still a surprisingly hilarious and often inspired animated blast that you'll find it hard not to enjoy.",1137715200,2,1138,5.2076502732240435

2368849,5,B000A6T27G,"In a world of terrible reality shows taking over the television with overused plots, it's hard to find a quality show these days. Now, Comedy Central's come up with something brilliant and put a twist on TV's load of garbage. DRAWN TOGETHER is television's first animated reality series. What could happen when eight crazy cartoon characters from all over the tooniverse are put in one house where they must live together? Why, the possibilities are endless! However, as we've learned from such shows as BIG BROTHER, when you make very different people live together, chaos will definitely ensue and the craziness won't stop.

DRAWN TOGETHER stars Captain Hero, Foxxy, Xandir, Ling-Ling, Spanky, Wooldoor, Toot, and Princess Clara. Each of them are parodies of cartoon characters, and you'll be sure to find at least one character from your favorite cartoon being parodied. While only the eight main characters appear in every episode, there are tons of guest-starring characters that you can find around every corner. While a cartoon lover will probably get the most out of everything that's spoofed, a cartoon hater will love it too. Are you someone who hates Pokemon? Well have no fear, because that show and many more are parodied.

Although there are tons of great characters, there are also fantastic plots. In one episode, Princess Clara holds her own version of ""The Bachelorette"" while another episode features Xandir falling in love with Aladdin's Genie. Making fun of reality shows and cartoons is the basic idea of DRAWN TOGETHER, and what could be funnier than that? Buying the first season on DVD has been a huge plus for me--not just because I get to watch the great episodes over and over again. But the special features are also amazing, featuring deleted scenes, a ""Censored or Uncensored?"" game, a karaoke game, and a lot more.

However, if you plan on buying the DVD, be cautious before buying. There's lots of censoring to these episodes when they're on TV, but when they're on DVD, absolutely everything is uncensored. So be prepared to see nudity and hear tons of unbleeped swears. Compared to an uncensored episode of DRAWN TOGETHER, SOUTH PARK will seem like a kiddie show. The swearing and nudity isn't overdone though, so don't worry about it--just don't show it to the kids. SOUTH PARK is my all-time favorite cartoon, and while this show may not be as clever, it comes very close. I'm glad to say that I am now a dedicated fan of DRAWN TOGETHER.",1135036800,7,2474,4.899761336515513

2368851,3,B000A6T27G,"Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the ""Not Another Teen Movie"" of television animation. ""Drawn Together"", which is paired up with the long-running ""South Park"" on Comedy Central Wednesdays nights, is just a piece of work by two guys who are so desperate to make a movie or TV show, that they collect spoofs of other movies and shows and an abundence of vulgar humor, and they pass it off as comedy. Every joke is loud, dumb, violence, gross and obvious. Still, it made me laugh.

I'm not sure why, but one explaination may be how the characters seem to give good animated performances. For example, you got the wonderful Tara Strong (""The Fairly Oddparents"", ""Teen Titans"", ""Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends"") as Princess Clara, who is a WASPy Disney-type, and as Toot, who is a washed-up pop icon who's gained more than a little weight. In both cases, where the characters are real bitches, Strong pulls through stellarly. The same goes for Cree Summer (""Rugrats"", ""Codename: Kids Next Door"") as Foxy Love, who is a sexually provocative spin on the Val character of ""Josie and the Pussycats"", for Adam Corolla as internet download Spanky Hamm (who obviously isn't different from his own type), character actor Jack Plotnik as Xandir, a queer video game warrior, Abby MacBride as an appropriate spin on the Pokemon fad, Ling-Ling, and for pretty much the entire cast.

In it's own way, the parody seems to work at being wildly funny, in the way that it almost gives a moral, but holds itself back as to avoid imitating it's compainion piece, ""South Park"". As a matter of fact, the pairing of the two shows together is more or less genius, and they really work...together.

The DVD for this show has more bonus features than the sets for it's companion piece. I would recommend getting this set with the new sixth season set for ""South Park"" (the season I think is best for that show), as I just mentioned how they seem to go together perfectly.

Of course, I wouldn't recommend this to people who don't like this kind of humor, such as my parents.",1132444800,,2049,4.6991643454039

 The premise is simple: Drawn Together takes wildly exaggerated stereotypical cartoon characters and puts them together in the world's first animated reality TV show. Hilarity ensues. Everyone will have their own favourite form the eight diverse characters, who include Clara, a bigoted fairytale princess, Foxxy Love, a sassy black mystery-solving musician, Captain Hero,an immoral super hero, Xandir, a gay video game adventurer and Toot, a self-harming, overwieght 20's sex symbol. But I suspect most viewers will find that Ling-Ling, a homicidal japanese battle-monster a la Pikachu, steals the show.

 Plots range from Xandir's coming out party to Foxxy opening up Clara's bigoted mind (and mouth) with a musical kiss in the hot tub. Some viewers will be shocked by just how far this program dares to go; one example of many is the scene in which a Vietnamese sweatshop child and his fifty siblings morph into a giant robot. But if, like the program makers, you don't take any of it seriously, you'll find yourself laughing til the tears run down your face.",1132272000,2,1296,5.042056074766355
2368953,4,B000A6T27G,"We've all sit down and watched reality shows go from something small to the seemingly dominating genre of popular television shows over the last few years.  From shows like Survivor, Big Brother, The Apprentice, and The Real World and every one inbetween, we have all had the same thought: WHEN WILL IT STOP?!?!

Well, leave it to Comedy Central of all networks to come up with a show that takes the entire reality genre and gives it a swift and strong kick in the backside.  Last year, Comedy Central took the entire reality world and threw it into a twist by creating an anti-reality reality show with Drawn Together, a reality show that took 8 animated characters based on popular real-life characters and threw them into a reality setting by putting them into a house with over a millions cameras watching their every move.

The characters include a cute but racially blind princess, a seriously annoying creature similar to Spongebob Squarepants, an overweight black and white 1920's screen sex symbol reminiscent of Betty Boop, a video game hero who is showing latent homosexual tendencies, a sexy mystery-solver/musician who apparently sleeps with anything with 2 legs and something between them, a dim-witted superhero, a creature that seems like the anti-Pikachu, and a crass Internet download.

Drawn Together: Season One shows the first 8 episodes of the series and is a lot more raunchier than when the episodes originally aired on Comedy Central due to the fact that each episode contains added scenes that were removed for time or just due to them being too raw for air and were saved exclusively for the DVD release. The gang deals with situations that in some aspects would and wouldn't happen in a regular reality show and takes jabs (or in some cases body blows) at not just the reality shows that it is intended to make fun of but other forms of entertainment as well, including a rather interesting potshot at the film Monster's Ball.

Recently, Comedy Central aired the 8th and final episode of the first season just as it airs on the DVD as part of the network's Saturday late night block Secret Stash, but one scene was omitted and blocked by a black screen due to one of the characters doing something you REALLY could not show on TV.

Additional features on the 2 disc set include commentaries on 6 of the show's episodes, deleted scenes, a Censored/Uncensored game where you have to guess if the line that the pictured character says was or was not edited from the original aired show, and a karaoke sing-along.

Now that season 2 of the show is underway, you might want to grab this to get caught up to see what the buzz is about ans get ""drawn"" into the fun of Drawn Together...",1130630400,6,2706,4.73036093418259

The show drags in parts, which prevents it from a 5 star rating, but when it is firing off all cylinders, it's great!

2368995,4,B000A6T27G,"""Drawn Together"" is a ""post-politically correct"" animated series, in the tradition of ""South Park,"" that is an incredibly well-written assault on that scourge of contemporary popular culture: the reality TV show.  Most intelligent viewers know that reality shows are about as far from ""reality"" as one can get.  So ""Drawn Together"" takes the next logical step ... animation.  It's a brilliant move, though I don't think the least intelligent of viewers would ever confuse this for a legitimate reality show.

""Drawn Together"" has ""The Real World"" as its primary influence, as that show's casting set the standard for the ""types"" of characters and character combinations that could create the most entertaining scenes.  Here, Betty Boop stand-in Toot Braunstein (the ""fat"" girl who is also the mean girl on set) and Little Mermaid stand-in Princess Clara (a prissy, silver-spoon primadonna who happens to be racist) cause most of the conflict.  Foxxy Love, a la Melody Brown from Josie and the Pussycats (voiced by Cree Summer), is ""the token black girl"" with bi-curious tendencies.  Spanky Ham (an online download, voiced by Adam Carolla) is, what his name implies, a pig (literally and metaphorically).  Ling-Ling, the Pokemon/Anime stand-in, is that reality show character who ""nobody understands.""  Xandir, a take off on Link from The Legend of Zelda, is the ""token gay guy"" confused about his sexuality.  Wooldoor, like Ren & Stimpy or Spongebob Squarepants, is the ""annoying eccentric.""  Lastly, there's Captain Hero, the Superman stand-in, who is the ""dumb jock.""  The show satirizes a wide canvas of pop culture: there are references to ""West Side Story,"" ""Star Wars,"" MC Escher drawings, Pac-Man, ""Aliens,"" and a whole slew of others.  The show's main target, though, is reality shows.  The shows most parodied are ""The Real World,"" ""Big Brother,"" ""Joe Millionaire,"" ""The Bachelor,"" ""Survivor"" and ""The Joe Schmo Show.""

What the makers of this show do with these reality show character types is quite hilarious and often shocking (even for a show on Comedy Central).  The humor is such that if a politician was quoted saying almost any line from this show out of context, it would get him or her fired immediately.  Nothing here is off limits: racism (Spanky Ham, jokingly, in the first episode, says, ""I love racism""), sexism, homophobic, eating disorders, the mentally disabled, alcoholism, drug use, deviant sexual activity, violence, celebrity and poverty are all joked about quite freely.  I would describe the show as an equal-oppurtunity offender.  That being said, the show often resorts to bathroom-humor and shock-value with little resonance.  ""Drawn Together,"" like a comedy roast, requires that its audience be open to being offended.  Viewers unable to do this will absolutely detest the show.  Also, the constant barrage of shocking comedic material can be overwhelming at times.  Thus watching more than two episodes back-to-back can prove quite challenging.  But if you're willing to see an animated show with brilliant social satire combined with a healthy dose of potty-humor, then you'll love ""Drawn Together.""",1128643200,5,3138,5.292929292929293

Laf'd my a$$ off! I would rate it at a 5, but it purposely choose not to include  the episode where Captain Hero (superman spoof) spies on the girls in the shower with his x-ray vision. Foxy Love develops a brain tumor from the x-ray radiation, and Captian Hero driven by guilt tries to give up his super powers by falling of a horse and becoming a parapalegic . this episode has never aired and has purposely been left out due to christopher reeves tragic death.",1128470400,,621,4.336206896551724
2368997,5,B000A6T27G,"I thought the series broke new ground, as an adult comedy, that wasn't afraid to step on a few toes, and brake some rules. I was disappointed that all I ever seemed to get was re-runs of them, and I did not get to see the entire series...but, I am buying it so that I can watch it. My favorite episode has to be the very first one, when they all meet....side splitting laughter..",1128470400,2,379,4.135135135135135
2368998,4,B000A6T27G,"I enjoyed seeing these episodes again, but I was looking forward to seeing the episode that was too controversial to air.  I guess it was too controversial to include on this box set.  What a disappointment!",1128384000,4,207,4.722222222222222
2368999,5,B000A6T27G,esta serie es muy buena y chistosa al igual que south park de verdad que vale la pena comprarla y verla no se la pueden perder,1128211200,,126,3.8846153846153846
2369000,4,B000A6T27G,"This was a superb series until the very last episode.  I don't know what caused the writers to derail so badly with the pathetic Apprentice parody, but the running joke of the guy crapping his pants was not funny the first time, and was downright annoying by the end.  Adam Corolla, however, was brilliant in voicing Spanky Ham, and scenes like the characters licking the pokemon character to get high were priceless.

The price point of this release is marginal, and will really only be worth it if episode 6 (which was never aired because it made fun of Christopher Reeve) is included on the set.",1127692800,,598,4.622641509433962
2369001,5,B000A6T27G,"The best new toon out there.  Purely adult but if you want your children brought up right, you'll make em' sit through it anyway.  Something has to prepare them for the road ahead.  They'll learn all the crap in school anyway.  Why make em' wait?  For the best in satire, filthy toilet humor, and just all around tastefully done bad taste, it's gotta be Drawn Together.  Fun the whole family can enjoy.
