8576875,5,B00C2XY130,"Everything Heidi Songs does is awesome! There are catchy jingles and motions for dozens of sight words on this DVD. I love that the songs emphasize spelling the words, not just identifying them. I highly recommend this product, as well as her Sounds Fun DVD, which focus on phonics/digraphs like ch, sh, aw, in addition to her Letter sounds DVD, which has songs and movement for each letter of the alphabet.",1481328000,,407,4.746478873239437
8576876,5,B00C2XY130,The DVD is great.  My little one picked up on it real quick.,1479859200,,60,3.6153846153846154
8576877,5,B00C2XY130,"My students LOVE this phonics dvd! I turn it on for a few minutes each day. They already know all of the phonics sounds that they will learn next semester, all from singing along with Heidi. I reinforce with flashcards during our word work time. I am very impressed and will be picking up the sight word dvds soon for my daughter.",1450915200,3,330,4.338709677419355

8576881,3,B00C2XY130,"This DVD was recommended by my son's First grade teacher, who has shown it to them in order to practice the acquisition of phonetical awareness.  Unfortunately, when purchasing this DVD for home use, one would expect something more than a ten-fifteen minute program.  After two views, my son was absolutely bored with it and we had no further use.  The DVD in itself is not a bad product, but it is simply ok and at the price point, it feels lackluster in scope and limited in goals.  It's simply a few sing-along melodies with a kid on the screen and the letter drawn on one corner.",1420329600,4,583,4.471698113207547
8576882,5,B00C2XY130,"We really enjoy these phonics dvds.
See the videos on her web site and you tube prior to buying
My son loves to be told to go do some phonics dancing
A great addition to our homeschool day
He learns, he moves/exercises and has fun
He really has absorbed these phonics lessons over time
I love that he is hearing, seeing (words on the screen during the song), saying and moving to the music and phonics songs",1396742400,4,407,4.298701298701299
8576883,5,B00C2XY130,My 3 year old girl and 5 year old boy love watching this DVD and signing and dancing along with the songs. They will even sometimes ask to watch this DVD instead of other non-educational movies. Great way to learn phonics rules. I am confident these songs are going to help my preschoolers become strong readers! Thank you Heidi!,1389830400,3,329,4.593220338983051
