1218233,3,B00000GQ96,"What a strange movie. It is a Spanish film with an international cast and a low budget. This was not one of Harvey Keitels' best works. He doesn't strike me as a classical actor so the role was a bit off. Redone today it might have more stability for the story line which is nothing short of alien in King Arthurs court. The mute alien is played by Miguel Bose, who if you aren't an international music fan, is a tremendous latin singer and musician. All in all this remains for me a really weird film. I guess in another time and place it would have been good.",1250985600,,561,4.203703703703703
1218234,2,B00000GQ96,"I bought this DVD after thinking about it for a few weeks and was not expecting much,..  and basically that is what I got out of it. This movie must have been filmed in Spain a number of years ago. It was funny like a Monty Python type of movie. Harvey Kitel must be willing to appear in almost any type of film. The quality was really poor, the Alien and his Dragon spaceship I suppose were different from recent Alien movies I watch, he was a spaceman who resembled David Bowie. It was really a dumb movie. If you are not expecting a blockbuster movie and really like spanish directors, actors, producers and scenery, and please do not compare with any King Authur Knight movies,... check it out, like I say it is like a Monty Python movie.",1204070400,6,742,4.338129496402877
1218235,3,B00000GQ96,"The film is a faiure as normal entertainment for normal people. But I am glad it is now on DVD and will not be forgotten. You may appreciate it if you are a very particular type of person with particular cerebral ways of looking at things.

The premise is really delicious and there are three great actors to watch interacting. So that might interest you. Then there is the question of why it failed. If you like to puzzle artistic/commercial mistakes of differences in cultural artistic receptions then it may interest you.

The premise of the story is great. Do you know the saying, ""When a pickpocket looks at a saint all he sees is the saint's pockets""? This psychological fact of how we see the world through personal filters is taken to a creative extreme in this film. If you are not sensitive to this flaw in human nature, this film may not resonate with you at all.

An alien vehicle crashes in the middle ages. The knight sees it as some sort of dragon that he must fight. The cleric sees it as an evil spirit. The Alchemist/philosopher sees it in his terms.

Then they all try to deal with it additionally in terms of the power struggles between them. And of course the middle ages was characterized by power struggles and alliances between the military class, the church, and men of ""reason"" or primitive ""pre-science.""

If you think of it this way you may find a lot of cute tongue in cheek humor in their interactions. It is three blind men running their hands over an elephant and fighting with each other at the same time. In this sense it is an interesting way to comment on human nature by using an outlandish fictional device.

So how could they fail? For one thing they try to ham it up too much in my opinion as though they had no faith that the audience could find the humor in in on their own. Fair enough. But for me at least the hamming it up did not work. The dialogue and acting are commonly stilted as though that will make it funny, but it comes across as poor quality. Several voices are dubbed and that may be part of the problem. Harvey Keitel makes little if any effort to cover his New York accent. This is supposed to remind us that this is a comedy?

In fairness, I really think that for most people it actually would not have been clear that this was meant to be a sarcastic commentary on human stupidity unless the producers tried to make it into a rather obvious comedy.

I imagine that if Bunuel or Almodovar had done this they would have let the humor speak for itself, but either can get away with that for several reasons.

I bought the VHS for $1 back when out of curiosity and it was indeed a curiosity. The box says that it was directed by Spanish director Fernando Colomo. I don't know his other many films, but I would guess that he is one of those Spanish directors then experimenting with surrealism in film. The Spanish appreciate surrealism in film more than Americans do. These sorts of artistic experiments are interesting to me, even when I don't find them entertaining. I see that he has won some awards and that some of his films have gotten high Amazon ratings. Several are not availabe in zone 1, so probably he is better known in Europe.

It also seems that unless you are an American who is a history buff, the comic aspects of people with different world views fighting and trying awkwardly to work together might not jump out at you with force.

I see in this film a director who was willing to take some chances and I would be curious find out more about how his career developed.

I doubt that many viewers will find this film entertaining. But if you can be forgiving of experimental films with awkward aspects you might just find this film worth watching. I give it an A for concept, a B for effort and a D if I try to imagine watching it from the perspective of the average American viewer, unless he has found some drugs that I can't think of.",1199318400,7,3912,4.388121546961326

1218238,2,B00000GQ96,"A nifty little movie with a flying saucer visiting the world of knights & wizards in old Europe.  Good actors, Okay movie.  Unfortunately there is a flaw, and it is a huge one.  The producer's of this DVD should have spent a little more time on it.  The audio and video don't track together, with the audio being about one second ahead of the visual.  This renders the entire movie into bad comedic farce.  Unfortunately the effect is not entertaining, but rather is a headache.  I would have to recomend that you avoid this film, at least until some other company creates a viewable version.",1085184000,,592,4.580952380952381
1218239,2,B00000GQ96,"Most people with anything to compare Star Knight to would probably give it the lowest rating possible, not only for its B-quality, but also for being so undecided in what it's trying to be. The film is medieval fantasy juxtaposed with science fiction. That's fine. But stuffed into the script are elements of a special-FX flick, a slapstick comedy, a martial arts movie, a fairy tale, and a sci-fi drama, but none of the above being particularly good. This mish-mash is primo material for Mystery Science 3000.
Thinking that Star Knight is just odd enough to have a cult following, I checked online for evidence and found only a few mentions, including two rather glowing reviews. One even praised the special effects, done in 1992, though they looked to me to be the same vintage as Zardoz (1974). But while Star Knight is a totally negligible film on its own terms, it does have some potentially interesting aspects for strange-film buffs.
The story opens on medieval times: peasants in idyllic surroundings pay taxes to the king's taxman, played by Harvey Keitel, if you can believe that. In the king's basement dwells the alchemist, Bothus, played by Klaus Kinski, still more unbelievably. Then there's the king's daughter Alba, played by some actress. She is old enough to desire romance. Then there's the priest, who has a deep distrust for science.
The order of things is quickly thrown into chaos by the appearance of a spaceship. The peasants believe it to be a dragon and demand that the king and Keitel defend them from it before they pay any more taxes. Meanwhile, Alba goes riding in the forest with her governess. In spite of the latter's nagging, she goes skinny dipping in the river, swimming toward mysterious bubbles coming from below. In a montage of underwater nudity and the facile effect of running film backwards, Alba is sucked below the surface and is gone.
She reappears a little later in a trance, and only Bothus, using hypnosis, can cure her. In spite of the alchemist's success, the priest fabricates a connection between the scientist and infernal forces, and then condemns him for these unsubstantiated diabolical ties. With Alba cured, however, the king sends his lisping town crier to find a knight who will defeat the strange river-dwelling monster. Keitel volunteers, saying in his best Brooklynese iambic quadrameter, ""The dragon I shall slay for thee!""
Keitel's rendition of Sir Thomas Malory's Arthurian English is totally comical. Intentionally so? It's hard to tell. Keitel doesn't do much to hide the accent he used in Pulp Fiction, and later in the movie, he does some slapstick pratfalls. Maybe this film is a comedy, but as I've suggested above, I don't think it ever made up its mind one way or the other. Whether intended to make you laugh or not, you may well get a chuckle hearing Keitel say ""Ye, poltroon,"" and ""Thou, varlet.""
As Keitel, the priest, the king, and The Green Knight (a seemingly intentional comic relief character, poorly lifted from Monty Python's Holy Grail) bumble about, Alba finds the ""dragon"" again. She boards the space ship and meets the star of the movie, a mute alien who communicates by theremin. Somehow Alba understands his waahs and woos, and this leads to dialogue like:
""Why won't you take your helmet off and kiss me?""
""Waaaahh. Woooo.""
""It will kill you to remove your helmet? But why?
""Woooo. Waaaahhh.""
""You can't breathe the same air as me? That's ridiculous.""
""Waaa-waaah. Woo-wooo. Tinky-winky.""
""I'm tired of your words.""
""Waah. Woo-waaah.""
""Stop saying 'I can't.'""
""Woooooooo.""
""Don't blaspheme!""
Have you ever seen Evil Dead 2? I got a similar feeling from this film. It's a feeling that the movie is a spoof, not because it was written as such, but because, during the making of the movie, it became obvious to cast and crew that it could be nothing else.
Having a mute, clueless alien move about in a clueless earth culture means that the script has to stretch to incredible lengths to make anything actually happen. One fight scene occurs in which a single martial-arts tumble is executed by Ayex the Aryan alien. The fight ends when Keitel manages to steal Ayex's armor, killing Ayex on the spot. Except that Bothus shows up with an elixir that saves Ayex and enables him to breathe earth air.
Keitel and the evil priest wind up boarding the space ship and shooting into outer space with no way of controlling the ship. Ayex develops the power to have his head glow, which makes the peasants believe he is a saint. The king grants him his daughter's hand, but not speaking any English, the aloof alien can only make his head glow in reply. And everyone lives happily ever after.
What can I say? This is a weird film. It's B-quality all the way, but I was mildly entertained in spite of, or because of that.",1061769600,4,4801,4.806529625151149

MST-3000 missed this film.

The basic story line: Klaus Kinski draws a circle in chalk and prays for an angel to visit him and give him the secret of life. A space ship flies over the community. The villagers think it is a dragon and a tax revolt erupts until the dragon is slain. Meanwhile, the dowdy Princess Alba is bored and decides to sneak out of the castle. She does encounter the Green Knight which gives us some comedic moments as does the town crier, but nothing to fall out of your chair over. Once she gets to a lake, the princess decides to doff all her clothes and go skinny dipping by herself. Why? Because if she didn't they would have never put the word ""nudity"" on the box and we would have never seen the film. The nudity is all underwater and certainly not a reason to get this film. While swimming she is captured by the ""dragon"" and mute man in a space suit. The princess falls in love and returns during her funeral. Now the question becomes, what to do about the ""dragon?""

I don't think there is a scene in the movie which looks like the cover. You won't reveal the surprise ending because chances are you won't make it that far. Move over Italy, Spain is making movies.",1294617600,3,1222,4.327510917030568

7909164,1,B00000GQ96,"""Star Knight"", made in the mid 80's in Spain as ""El Caballero del Dragn"", is predictable, pretentious, and ponderous, while simultaneously being ridiculous and silly. Starring Harvey Keitel and Klaus Kinski among a cast of thousands of other people you've never heard of, the film is about a man in a space suit who comes to earth in a giant UFO and falls in love with a medieval princess, creating an awkward love triangle. This, of course, sets up the film to have the humans of old think the UFO is a dragon, and through much telepathic conversation (and contrived exposition) leads to what may be the most ridiculous duel in screen history. The special effects are laughable (I especially like the ""glowing head"" effect), although the costumes are interesting.

The film has many lessons to teach: don't swim toward a giant whirlpool in a lake, for instance; stuff you would have never known on your own. The dialogue is terrible and very stilted (""Don't you know there's a dragon around here that devours goats, women, and children?"") and the direction is unskilled. The emphasis afforded non-pertinent things is very distracting: why does the movie open with Matilda the flying goat (really)? Why the prolonged hysterical overreaction to a black cat? I know they were alleged to bring bad luck, but this cat gets a reception that is truly over the top.

The film is terribly unfocused, and the pace is plodding. The director decides the film should be a light comedy for brief scenes on several occasions, squandering whatever suspense it was able to muster. The most outlandish comedic gems are courtesy of The Green Knight, a.k.a. the worst knight ever in history: he is gross buffoonery personified. This confusing melding (it's kind of like ""Alien"" meets ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"") of fantasy adventure epic, love story, and farce actually made me consider giving the film two stars for camp value, that is until I saw the end of the film. Not only does the conclusion of the film predictably prove that love overcomes all (even a need for a non-oxygen based atmosphere), but that two idiots and mid-1980's animation do not mix in outer space.

""Star Knight"" has something to make anyone groan, and I can't recommend it, unless you have a very strong stomach for quirky camp films.",1258934400,2,2299,4.844783715012722
