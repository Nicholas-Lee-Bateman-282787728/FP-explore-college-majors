7930431,4,B000053UYZ,This movie had twists and turns up to the very end. It kept me on the edge of my seat and did not disappoint! w,1474156800,,111,3.48
7930432,1,B000053UYZ,"The first rule of storytelling (one that too many films of the 1970s-1990s ignored) is that an interesting or suspenseful plot requires characters with whom one may sympathize.  THE ART OF MURDER fails this test, as it trots out a hoary adultery/ murder set-up and then drags its feet through every convention associated with such melodramas.

I bought THE ART OF MURDER because Michael Moriarity has appeared in so few products after he walked off LAW AND ORDER.  His voice in this more recent effort suggests perhaps a bout of throat surgery.  While it is understandable to want to play against type, his loutish alcoholic tycoon is beyond his (or our) grasp.

And the title of the movie refers to a plot detail too arbitrary to merit attention.",1183334400,5,747,4.8046875
