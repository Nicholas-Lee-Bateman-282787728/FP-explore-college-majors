1754814,5,B00006G9YD,This film is a classic that is long overdue on DVD. Al Pacino makes a stunning debut. This is an intense drama whose gritty and accurate reflection of drug addiction will not easily be forgotten.

It shows how he rose in the ranks of the drug business and that in the end he didn't gain financially, and lost through jail time.

1754911,5,B00006G9YD,"There are so many ways this portrait of heroin addicts could have become formulaic but it manages to sidestep almost all of them.  The performances are all fresh and unpredictable.  Pacino does exactly what he is called to do and rarely anything excessive.  In a clever bit of reverse casting, the girlfriend and young detective seem uncertain of their fates, almost as if they could be on the opposite sides of the law at any moment.  The last scene perfectly sums up the psychological space this couple have reached.  My only gripes are that you have to pay very close attention because a couple of plot twists are implied rather than shown and that the camera lingers excessively on a couple of unpleasant shots.",1414368000,,715,4.733870967741935

It show the downward spiral of risks taken morals/values given up, and the overall destruction of drug abuse.",1409875200,2,432,4.631578947368421
1754925,5,B00006G9YD,"Well get ready to meet a few...

We get a cold slice of the seedier side of 1970s New York right about when Gotham was approaching rock bottom. Heroin was very much embedded in the day-to-day and we're invited to join the Needle Park crew on their downward spiral. Pacino and Winn could easily have won Oscars for their performances but mainstream America wasn't ready to deal with this whole drug issue back in the early 1970's, hell, it's still great taboo almost 50 years later. The movie's starkness, documentary feel really makes it a compelling work. There's no need for a soundtrack, think about it: what dope addict is listening to music? There is no gratuitous overdose death or personal tragedy leading to increased drug dependence. Producer Schatzberg gives the raw, hard facts - stealing an appliance, the ups and downs of trying to score smack, hiding the stash, end-of-the-world freaking out when dope or dough gets stolen, the prep work to shoot up, the cardinal sin of sharing junk, pawning hot goods, tricking, bulls***ting cops and family, hustling, short stints in the can and so on and so on and so on. All the things that, when combined, lead to one or both feet in the grave. And all accurate.

If you want to have some fun, if ""fun"" is the correct word, watch Quentin Tarantino's overdose recovery scene in Pulp Fiction and juxtapose it against the same scene in Needle Park that QT lifted it from. I still giggle (not in a derisive way) at the Pulp Fiction version. Amateur hour in the wannabe gangster life. That said, there was nothing remotely funny about the reactions of the Needle Park crew - someone OD'ing in their personal space could have been a drastic tip of the scale of life. Desperation at its greatest multiple.

The DVD itself is as bare to the bone as the movie. Don't expect any voiceovers, director's commentary, cute outtakes, etc. Just a movie trailer extra which in itself was awesome and a throwback.

Great movie, great topic, great direction, great acting (we don't have to endure Pacino screaming a third of the time - crikey, he's so good why does he feel compelled to shout his lines?). I am not reaching when I write that this is a classic and carries as powerful a punch as anything put to film.",1405728000,6,2250,4.6457286432160805
1754926,4,B00006G9YD,"Like a lot of American early 70s films we get the downside of the 60s high,the documentary fall out from 60s dreams. The title refers to heroin abuse in New York Citys Sherman Square,where addicts ply their trade and share an illusory feeling of community. Helen(Kitty Winn) is shown in a subway car following a clandestine abortion,she seems muted with pain,occluded by distress. Shes lost in the city and falls for Bobby(Pacino,scuzzy charisma),a small-time smack-pusher who introduces her to the world of strung-out junkies,who steal,love,cheat,befriend and betray. No addict is above betrayal when their habit is on the line(as a narc says).Their romance flickers like a candle about to go out. The film seems to be shot on hand-held cameras in decaying,deadbeat interiors or in the streets and has a jaunty feel to it(Schatzberg had been a photographer).Schatzberg seems attuned to his addicts wounded lives. The film focuses on the process of shooting up,from mapping out a usable vein to the rush of a needle hitting home. Pacino gives it his all,this is his 1st star-making role. Kitty Winn is excellent as the once clean girlfriend who falls into the sink of hell. With a good supportive cast of characters,the film is the template for later drug films like Drugstore Cowboy and Requien for a Dream in its chronicle of alienation. This reminds you of all Pacino's later great roles,The Godfather,Scarecrow,Serpico,Carlito's Way.",1403654400,,1437,5.198275862068965
1754927,2,B00006G9YD,You would think Al Pacino would be good....it wasn't.  Sad to say I don't recommend it to anyone!!!!  Love Al but hated the movie.,1391644800,,130,4.375
1754928,5,B00006G9YD,"After watching the film I questioned why it is not talked about more. It is a stark, honest film with great photography of early 70's NYC Upper West Side. ""Needle Park"" is/or was the nickname of Sherman Square and a hangout for addicts, primarily heroin addicts, in the late 60's and 70's.

The film is a great love story. It is story of the love addicts have for their next fix and how this love will always overshadow and win out over any human love.

It stars Al Pacino, in his second role in film, as Bobby and Kitt Winn, as Helen, his seemingly lost and naive girlfriend. Kitt won the BEST ACTRESS award for this role at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival. The film was written by Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne and produced by the famous Dominick Dunne.

Bobby meets Helen at his friend Marco's flat. Marco is played by a young and quite handsome Raul Julia. He is immediately smitten by her even though she is just lying sick on Marco's couch, recovering from a recent abortion. Marco is leaving the city for a while and after Helen ends up in the hospital after complications from the abortion Bobby begins to court her. She is in desperate need of someone to love and protect her and Bobby fits the bill perfectly.

The rest of the film is about their lives together. As with most heroin addicts Bobby spends his days between searching for money for his next fix and getting high. Helen becomes more and more involved in the drug addict lifestyle which at first is exciting to her but ultimately pulls her into its seedy underbelly. I will stop it at that.

I much prefer Pacino's acting in ""Panic"" over his role, the next year, in THE GODFATHER. I felt he really embraced the role and he came across genuine, realistic and not over-the-top as he does in many of his roles. There is a certain humbleness to his acting that we don't often see from him. Kitt Winn is an actress that had few film roles before or after this one. With all the critical acclaim she received for this film I question why she never became more popular. I am guessing it must have been her decision not pursue acting with more vigor but maybe someone here has some insight into why we don't see her in more movies in the 70's and 80's after this stellar portrayal.

NOTE: While reading about this film I found an interesting fact that Jim Morrison of The Door's was the first choice for the role of Bobby.",1387584000,2,2388,4.403628117913832
1754929,5,B00006G9YD,"keep an eye out for other future ""Godfather"" alums: Richard Bright and Paul Sorvino!

I couldn't believe after I read more about why this film is so special, that I did not realize there is absolutely no music in it!  I was around when ""Panic"" debuted in 1971. But I was at a point in my life when movies were way, way on the back burner.  As a matter of fact, during the late 60's I lived on 71st and Broadway.  What made me want to seek out the film in the 21st Century was to see more Jerry Schatzberg's work after seeing ""Reunion.""

Another thing to keep your eye out on is how the face of Pacino and Kitty change from scene to scene.  Sometimes they literally don't even ""look like themselves.""  A few times I swore they were stand-ins they looked so different.  Then, I figured it was a subtle way to show how the drug transformed them into different people, that matched how they changed when they were or were not under the influence.",1378080000,2,942,4.2824858757062145

1754933,5,B00006G9YD,"I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters and happened to think of it today.  I am very happy to see that the DVD is available and I am buying one.
I have not seen this since that first time, and it stands out in my mind like I saw it yesterday.  It is one of the most realistic films I have ever seen.  It could have been a documentary.  I lived in NYC for quite a few years and knew some people who were deep into the world of heroin.  I met a couple who had just ""discovered"" it, and as time passed I couldn't relate to them at all anymore, so we drifted apart.  The lifestyle and actions of the couple in ""Panic"" are so close to the couple I knew it is just amazing.  Then of course add Al Pacino's acting, and you have a movie that grabs your attention and keeps it through the entire film.
One thing I like about the way the story is told is that I felt the same way about the young couple as I did the couple that had been friends of mine.  I knew that what they were doing was wrong, but I felt sorry for them.  The drug completely took over their lives, and as you see in the end, no matter what they have to do to get it, the other one understands and forgives - it is just part of their addiction.
""Panic in Needle Park"" is outstanding, and it surprises me that you don't hear much about it these days like you hear about other classics that Pacino has made.  I am looking forward to seeing it again.",1353888000,,1421,3.937062937062937
1754934,5,B00006G9YD,"This is probably one of my favorite movies. I adore it. I think the way they filmed it was actually pretty good because of the realistic feel of it. It's a story starring al Pacino and kitty Winn as two young adults in new York, who are heroin addicts. It is deeply depressing but at the same time you can understand the characters and why they do what they do. It is not a happy ending type story, it also has actual injections in it, so if you are queasy of needles, pass on this. However, it's a very moving movie.",1334880000,2,517,4.128712871287129

1754936,5,B00006G9YD,"This is such a very powerful and eye opening movie and a real true gem as nothing like it has been made or duplicated since.  To me this movie is one of my personal top 5 Al Pacino movies of all time for many reasons as this was his 2nd major lead role, and it tackled a very strong subject that even to this day still exhist and that's drugs.  Over the last 50 years America has done a better job of tackling this head on but back in the late 60's to 80's it was at its very peak and this movie really shows you the true ugly side of drugs, it's abuse, the consequences for using it and where it may lead you.  If you have a child, friend, realitve, just someone you know that may be thinking about or is taking drugs or you just want to get away from all the special graphics, cue in the soundtrack theme for when this actor walks in the room, get eady for 5-8 sequel type of movies then kick back and enjoy this one!

  Kitty Winn plays Helen who is miles away from home who in my mind doesn't want to go back home.  Why I'm not sure but it gave me strong feelings that she's away from home because it's boring and she just doesn't want to go bac to that lifestyle, she doesn't feel accepted.  Helen was living with a artist who got her pregnant and made her go get an abortion or as he put it lightly "" do me a favor"", and you can just see how hurt she feels and the lack of no compassion, comfort from her artist boyfriend just has her feeling lost and once again not accepted.  To add even more insult to injury he splits for reasons unknown and Helen is without a job, doesn't know anybody and is just lost, down on her luck.  Now enters Al Pacino as Bobby who in this movie really starts putting you on notice with the diversity of his acting in this film.  You truly beleive that his Bobby character is just really in need of an intervention.  Like many of Pacino's movies where he commands the screen naturally this one has you locked on to him and he does such a superb job, right down to the minor details.  You can tell that he really devoted the time to understand the mind of a junkie, hustler, that he really tried living the life.  Something that a lot of actors don't really do nowdays.  Bobby is a hustler and a addict who supplied Helen's boyfriend with drugs from time to time who's hears about what happened to her and offers her a place to live even though he doesn't have a place as we learn later on he lives hotel to hotel.  Helen accepts te gesture and not before long these two fall in love with one another.  Helen's love as we see the movie progress gets the very best of her as she's exposed to Bobby's hustling ways so he can feed himself a $50 a day drug habbit and rather than try to help him get clean she just accepts it and adapts to it and Bobby as well as his drugg addicted friends who mostly hang out in the park scheming, trying to figue out ways to make a quick buck so they can score again.

  Helen to me really comes off as just wanting to be accepted and not judged and lead me to beleive that she liked being exposed to all this because it was new, exciting and no judgement was made on her, she was accepted.  How many of us growing up felt like this character?  Whether it was in school and trying to make new friends, or at a party, or even trying to get picked to play dodgeball or tag and to be rejected?  It rings so true of wanting to be accepted, even in todays society this still rings true but its the dark desperation and demise of Helen that will have you mad and sad at times and even yelling out loud what the hell are you doing?  This is a dark movie about love, acceptance, drugs that was beautifully written by James Mills and directed by Jerry Schatzberg.  For her portrayal of Helen, Kitty Winn won the Best Actress Award at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival.  Also the film and its director, were also nominated for the Palme d'Or award so do yourself a favor and grab a copy to own, stream, or rent.  You'll love and be sure to thank me later.

1754937,5,B00006G9YD,"New York is a kinder and gentler place now than it was in 1971 when this film came out.  At that time, the area known as Sheridan Square was thought of as ""Needle Park"" because so many heroin addicts congregated there.  This is a film about heroin addiction but it is also a film about love and dependency which is as deeply moving as the several shock scenes of shooting up with close-ups of needles going into the skin.

This film launched the career of Al Pacino in his first major role.  He is cast as a charismatic small time drug dealer and thief who wins his way into the heart of a homeless young woman from the Midwest  played by Kitty Winn.  She's lost her innocence already by the time she meets Pacino and he takes care of her in the aftermath a breakup with her artist boyfriend and a traumatic abortion.  Soon, they are a couple, falling in love, doing drugs together and supporting each other emotionally.  Naturally, the drugs take over their common sense and there is one horrific scene in which they buy a puppy in Staten Island but their needs drive them to do drugs in a restroom on the Staten Island Ferry, neglecting the puppy who falls off the ferry and drowns.

The film is sad as the couple spiral even further downward, the young woman turning to first selling her body and then selling out on Pacino,  the love of her life.  How this all turns out is the stuff of pure drama with an ending that was more upbeat than I expected.  This is a fine film that has not lost its impact by the test of time.",1309219200,4,1525,4.293706293706293

1754941,3,B00006G9YD,"Al Pacino stars as Bobby, a grungy heroin addict, who's living a seedy existence in NYC. Kitty Winn plays Bobby's girl, Helen. Helen becomes romantically involved with Bobby, and he initiates her into the sordid world of heroin use.

This film is shot to look like a documentary. As a result, the viewer can better envision the squalor of the characters, and their desperate quest to keep themselves supplied with enough heroin. Overall, the film is engrossing, and yet has a repulsive quality. The characters in this film, are very pitiful. They manage to invoke both sympathy, and contempt at the same time.

You may likely feel glad when the film is over, because you don't have to witness the wretched suffering of the addict characters anymore. Al Pacino is amazingly talented. His performance in this film, is the only reason to see this otherwise depressing movie.",1262044800,,871,4.918367346938775
1754942,4,B00006G9YD,"This movie was originally released in 1971, a year before Al Pacino would soar
to superstardom in the now iconic GODFATHER and it's sequels.
This movie, ""Panic In Needle Park"" was actually based on an off-broadway play
in which Pacino played this character along with his then girlfriend, Kitty Winn,
who also plays in this movie as his love interest as well.
By the time Pacino did this, his first film, he had already did plenty of plays and
recieved a few prestigious theatre accolades, so he was already known as a very special
up & coming talent in New York City film circles.
What you get here is a raw, hungry, lean and unpolished Pacino playing
a small time theif/hustler and heroin junkie who eeks his way out in the
rough & tumble streets of dirty early 70's NYC by any means he can!
He meets and befreind's a woman, played by his then girlfriend, Kitty Winn,
who is kind of green to the ways of the streets, but she is soon seduced by heroin
and Pacino's character's gritty charm, and soon both of them spiral into an abyss
of addiction, street life, sex, some violence, and Pacino's character is so low
that he even pimps out his girlfriend a few times to get money for drugs!
After a bad incident involving a cute puppy, the Staten Island Ferry, and the Hudson River,
she finally wakes up and sees that her boyfreind isn't her knight in shining armour,
but an opportunistic, drug-crazed, desperate sleaze-ball who would sell his grandmother
for a hit of heroin! She agrees with undercover cops who have her on prostitution charges
to have him set up and arrested in exchange for her freedom.
It works, and he is apprehended and serves time.
But in true co-dependent fashion, she still loves him, and shows up on the day
he's released from prison to cling to his side again! (Silly Broad!)
Like I said, this is a cool film to see Al Pacino's evolution as one of the greatest
actors of the last 50 yrs. He gives it to you cold & raw in this with no apologies!",1257811200,11,1970,4.45983379501385
1754943,5,B00006G9YD,"There are few films that are truly able to capture what it feels like to be addicted.  Probably the film that comes the closest and is the most compelling (albeit most disturbing) is `Requiem for a Dream'; at least in my humble opinion.  The little known gem that is `The Panic in Needle Park' comes very close though, for like `Requiem for a Dream', `The Panic in Needle Park' strips everything bare and delivers a very harsh reality to the viewer, exploring the depths that some will stoop to just to find their next fix.

`The Panic in Needle Park' tells the story of Bobby, a young heroine addict who falls in love with Helen, a sweet and innocent young girl who is taken up by Booby's apparent bad boy persona.  He is new and interesting and unlike anyone she's ever really known before.  Sure, she's been around drugs but she's never really been exposed at such an alarming rate until she met Bobby.  Soon she becomes are addicted as he is, getting in and out of trouble with the cops as she peddles for Bobby, buys for Bobby and scores with Bobby.  Bobby's brother Hank isn't much help, for while he isn't as addicted as Bobby, his criminal activities leave him just as bad an influence.  As the film spirals towards its conclusion the lives of these two lovers become more and more disjointed and frantic and the panic sets in and the addiction takes over.

The film is grim (no where near as grim as `Requiem for a Dream' so don't worry too much) and it's gritty delivery makes each and every scene seem as if it is really taking place (the lack of any musical soundtrack helps add a layer of reality to the film).  The performances really elevate the film as well, drawing the audience into the mental states of these star-crossed and ill-fated individuals.  Kitty Winn is marvelous as Helen, a truly devastating depiction of lost dreams and manipulated trust.  As she deteriorates due to Bobby's influence we watch her addictions take over her thinking and propel her in directions she never thought imaginable.  When she talks to Bobby at the prison, her face contorting to that of pain and misery you can see every fiber in her slowly fraying at the edges.  Al Pacino is also flawless as Bobby.  This is the performance that got him the coveted role in `The Godfather' saga; Coppola falling in love with Pacino's acting ability here.  He seeps effortlessly into the mind of an addict, conveying the hunger so readily and convincingly.  He is outstandingly sympathetic at one extreme and then harrowingly vile on the other.  He balances this very well in order to gain out acceptance and loyalty, much like Bobby gained that of Helen.

In the end I must say that I am in awe of this film.  Like I mentioned, there are few films that can capture the heart of addiction with such fiery honesty, even though many films today try.  `The Panic in Needle Park' has such a rare truthfulness in its story and it rings forth with such power that one cannot help but become absorbed in its tale.  It is a hard film to watch because its misery is so real, but it is an important film to see for it sheds some light on the disease that takes so many victims today.",1221782400,12,3164,4.504378283712785

I worked in law enforcement and had an up-front and personal view of the kinds of people this movie was about. The only truer depiction would have to be an on the scene filmed documentary.

This movie is definitely a downer on a very serious subject but you really get into the people and the romance between Pacino and Kitty Witt. It starts out with him charming this very young and naive girl. Pacino is a fast talking, fast walking petty theif who lives from fix to fix trying to scavenge enough money to shoot up. It starts out with her being very naive but falling for him and accepting his 'habit'. ""I'm just chipping,"" he tells her meaning that he isn't a full blown addict but just experimenting. But then she falls into his lifestyle. At first it is admirable because she is experiencing all the sights and sounds of New York and Pacino seems to know everybody. But then she descends into the abyss with Pacino.

1754962,5,B00006G9YD,"I was a little taken aback by the film's ""PG"" rating.  Drug use is treated frankly, there's some strong language and fleeting nudity.  But then I thought why shouldn't young people of a certain age see this film.  They are the most vulnerable in being ensnared into the drug culture and maybe they should heed the film's cautionary message.  I also found the timing of this film's release, 1971, interesting because it comes at a time when the drug culture was in full bloom and we were only a few years removed from ""Easy Rider"".  The selling point is, of course, Al Pacino who is nothing short of amazing as the small-time thief who goes from pecking to full-blown addiction.  I thought this was more Kitty Winn's picture, though.  Her character could be anybody's daughter who for reason's unknown takes up a serious drug habit.  The film is essentially a love story between Pacino and Winn's characters.  I couldn't decide whether the love between the two brought a little light to their dismal straits or that they were enabling each other into a worse addiction.  For obvious reasons the film's message is timeless because, unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world.  Pacino and director Jerry Schatzberg would later collaborate on another seventies gem, ""Scarecrow"", that is well worth checking out.",1182816000,30,1312,4.891402714932127
1754963,3,B00006G9YD,"I can't help but compare this film to Drugstore Cowboy, another drama detailing the life of heroin users.  The comparison does not favor Panic. While Drugstore Cowboy feels like a story written by someone who really knows what it's like to be a junkie (it was), this tale feels like it was written by an intellectual who had never touched smack but thought it would be cool to write a story about strung-out people.  The whole thing feels affected, stale, acted out.  You can't help but love Al Pacino, overacting in an endearing way in the earliest days of his career.  And Kitty Winn, the actress who plays Pacino's partner in crime here, is cute and charming in a Margot Kidder/Karen Allen kind of way. But actors' charms aside, the film is bland and sterile.  Skip this and go watch Drugstore Cowboy, which will make you feel like you are really inside the world of a group of heroin users.",1182729600,5,894,4.5625

Great movie that I am happy is finally making its way to video. The movie had been released in Europe for some time but never in the United States that is until now.

7968473,3,B00006G9YD,"Ive heard people talk about New York City as if it were the greatest place on Earth. Woody Allen has made films that portray the city as the most attractive location there is. And yet my memories of the city from various TV series and films never lends itself to a location Id want to visit or spend time in. It was movies like this one that did little to endear the city to those whove never been there and probably did damage to the tourist trade there.

In his first lead role in a major motion picture Al Pacino stars as Bobby, a low level thief and junkie who lives day by day on the streets of New York. He meets Helen (Kitty Winn) through a mutual friend and artist named Marco (Raul Julia), Helens now ex-boyfriend whos about to leave the country for a while. This leaves Helen homeless with no friends to turn to. Except that Bobby takes a liking to her and invites her to stay with him.

But Bobby is a full on junkie, stealing in order to get a fix, get high and tune out. His is a world of fellow junkies who bond together in one apartment or another until they can no longer pay the rent since the money goes towards feeding their addiction.

Eventually Helen wants to know what its like and shoots up as well. At first upset by the situation Bobby eventually finds that it bonds the two of them closer together. Both promise to kick the habit but those days never come. Instead they live a life that takes them to the lowest of lows. Worse yet is that the city is dry at the moment with drugs shipments cut off after a number of arrests, thus the title of the film, a panic that drugs are nowhere to be found.

The movie follows the pairs lives as they continue to go lower and lower, occasionally trying to claw their way up but then failing miserably. The tragedy of their lives should have made this movie one to show teens who might consider drug use. It is a sad world they live in due to their addictions. And New York City has never looked as filthy or degraded as in this film.

The story itself is only slightly interesting as somber and dark as it is. What most will want to see this film for is to watch the young Pacino elevating what could have been a low budgeted film role into something more. It would be just a year later that he would break out in THE GODFATHER but hints of what was to come can be seen here.

Twilight Time presents the film as always in the best print possible. Extras are plentiful this time around and include an isolated score track featuring unused music composed and conducted by Ned Rorem, a featurette called PANIC IN THE STREETS OF NEW YORK, a featurette called WRITERS IN NEEDLE PARK, Notes on Ned Rorems unused score and the original theatrical trailer.

The movie as a whole isn't something that's going to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. In fact, it will probably do the opposite. It's basically about a bunch of drug addicts in New York who are all panicking because the heroin supply in the city is drying up.
