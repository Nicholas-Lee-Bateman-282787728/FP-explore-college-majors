It is by no means a comprehensive work on WWI so if you are looking to start learning about WWI, start elsewhere. Try """"WWI: The Complete Story - 100th Memorial Edition""",1469059200,,313,4.814814814814815

8655353,2,B00K2OBSZU,"WWI in 60 minutes?  Really?  That alone should tell you everything.

The DVD cover says ""in-depth look into"" the war...that's not true.  It is a very cursory look into the war.

POSITIVES

The war footage (although other WWI DVDs have similar/same footage)

NEGATIVES

It's too short.  Too much information is left out.

The narration doesn't match the images/video.  Most of the time, the narration is independent of the images/video.  So, you really don't know what you are seeing.

Phrases like ""Triple Entente"" are used, but not explained.

Sometimes they use foreign words to describe situations (i.e., poor communication, subpar understanding).

The music is varied and odd.  You'll hear some music from the era (good); other times you'll hear modern rock music.  And then you'll hear some opera.

No maps or diagrams are displayed.

It's disorganized; there doesn't appear to be any order to how they presented the information. By topic? By government? Chronological?

OTHER

This reminds me of a DVD that might be shown to elementary school children.  And that's awful, because it does a very poor job at describing WWI.  Documentaries like this do not spark interest; and they are not good teaching tools.
