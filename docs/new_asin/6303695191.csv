The instructions are very clearly given and timed to make them audible and working with the beat of
the music. A Lot of thought and planning went into this video.  I love it!

7854070,5,6303695191,"I used this tape in the 90's and recently rediscovered it. It's a good--though quick--cardio workout; 20 or so minutes of actual cardio. I usually combine it with the Reebok Sweat Factory Dance Cardio, because neither one nor the other provides me with enough cardio, I feel.

The moves are nice in that they're more seamless and ""flow-y"" than traditional straight athletic cardio moves.

Difficulty-wise I think it's pretty simple; none of the moves are complicated. The music is still good today (although I find Petra's one-piece bodysuit a little weird).",1169424000,,558,5.1208791208791204
7854071,5,6303695191,"Despite amassing a considerable collection of exercise videos in the past 10 years, the Reebok Versa Training series (Hi-Low, Dance Step, Abs, Legs) is undoubtedly my favorite.  Hi-Low and Dance Step have the quality of being filmed, rather than taped. The background is artistic: montage images on a large screen; billowing curtains off to the side, nearly out of sight.  The music is of the ambient-world variety, as in the Buddha Bar or Hotel Etages compilations.  With such high production values, exercising never becomes a monotonous grind. However, the learning curve is not instant. You will have to stop and rewind the tape, but it is worth the effort.  The Abs and Legs tapes  can be learned in one or two viewings. The trade-off is that they're less visually satisfying, but they are well done and provide quality work-outs.",1110499200,5,835,4.9784172661870505
7854072,5,6303695191,"I ran accross this video while visiting my sister in Houston.  I looked at it and said ""Twenty-nine minutes, I laugh at 29 minutes""; ten minutes into the workout I was begging for water.  I love this workout video.  I have a collection of workout videos, but this is my favorite.  Petra Kolber is great.
I highly recommend this video for anyone looking for a quick, good workout.",979689600,4,379,4.529411764705882
7854073,2,6303695191,"I have been doing aerobics for about 10 years and decided to give this workout a try.  There is minimal instruction for a series of steps and arms moves that are very fast and unorganized.  I spent most of my time jumping up and down trying to figure out what Petra was doing instead of getting a real workout.  Furthermore the intensity is pretty minimal, so even if I were to learn the moves I don't think I'd get a great workout.",978480000,,432,4.2439024390243905
7854074,5,6303695191,"I have been using this video for many years, I asolutely love it! It's great for days when you are short on time and need to get in and out quickly! It's challanging to learn but it keeps you interested and never bored.  I probably did the video 10 times before I got the flow of the moves.  It's a great video to throw in your suitcase for a quick 28 minute workout when you are traveling, all you need is a VCR. You can do the moves at your own intensity which makes it great for all fitness levels!  I highly recommend the video.",977529600,3,532,4.0476190476190474
7854075,5,6303695191,"I purchased this video about 2 years ago and loved it! I lent it to a friend so that she could try it out, and I never got it back.  Ever since then anytime I go in a store I look for it, but cannot find it anywhere.  Believe me this video will get you pumped and ready to work out.  Petras  since of humor and peppy-ness really makes you get into the workout. The  moves that she uses in the video are a great combination of old and new  dance steps combined together to give you an all over body workout. She  teaches each move, and breaks it down so that you can learn the move, and  feel confident.  At the end you have learned a dance routine and had fun  all in one workout.  If you get bored working out and don't look forward to  it, this is the video for you.  Thanks Petra and amazon.com for helping me  find the perfect workout video.",952300800,12,845,4.0120481927710845
