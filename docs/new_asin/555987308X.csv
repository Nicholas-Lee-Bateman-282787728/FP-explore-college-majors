206749,5,555987308X,"This was a wonderful film. Four children are presented with a problem to solve. Their mother has died and they are on their way to four separate foster homes. They run away together in search of their uncle. As kids will, they make many wrong choices. However, they are not left without consequences. I really enjoyed the movie with its charming story. It's a good film for discussing with children how the right choice is not always the obvious choice, and that all actions have consequences.",1150243200,17,493,4.744186046511628
206750,5,555987308X,"I have four children ages 4, 5, 7, and 11.  All of them LOVE this movie.  It is the most-watched movie in our home.  The plot is deep enough to be enjoyed by young and old alike.  If you have children, you won't regret your purchase.",1094860800,10,233,4.0

206769,5,555987308X,"This movie is one of my favorites now! It touched me as I was adopted. It really shows the lengths a family will go to so they can hold onto each other! If you have any humaness within you, you too will cry! Even my husband said it touched him. I love the music and the characters are just so vibrant! Great soul and heart movie for us softies that just need a tear jerker to bring out the softy in us!!",1370217600,3,403,3.926829268292683
206770,5,555987308X,"I watched this when I was a little girl over and over. I was trying to find it on DVD, but couldn't (unless it was digitally cut) so I opted for the VHS version. My kids are still very young and don't understand the story so it's boring to them, but this really is a cute story of brothers and sisters trying to stay together and having to live on their own for a while.",1369699200,3,370,3.9466666666666668
206781,5,555987308X,"This was my favorite movie as a child, and some things never change. Don't get me wrong, the acting is terrible and the plot line has holes in it, and the cover art might be the ugliest thing I've ever seen, but I love it. It makes me laugh every time I watch it.
Although, I was slightly disappointed that there's weren't more special features on the disk like behind the scenes and bloopers. That would have made my life complete.",1366588800,2,432,4.345679012345679
206782,3,555987308X,"We loved this movie as kids but re-watching it as an adult (having seen much better movies) it leaves much to be desired. There are some pretty sizeable plot holes and the acting overall is kinda cheesy.

But, it still brings back childhood memories so for that it gets an average rating.",1315008000,3,288,4.538461538461538
206783,1,555987308X,I never finished this movie. My brother and I took it out back and destroyed it with baseball bats after about 5 minutes of watching it. That's how bad it is.,1297814400,4,158,4.129032258064516
206784,5,555987308X,I am really enjoying the purchase of this dvd.

206786,4,555987308X,"I recently purchased the DVD of this movie, and they took out several scenes and replaced them with Peggy's mom narrating.  The original (VHS) is soooo much better.  Even the ending is funnier and more appropriate.  They totally made the ending unbelievable in the DVD.  It's funny to me that the two different versions would have different endings.  If you are to purchase this movie, I totally recommend getting the VHS version.  It's much more enjoyable (and has a much more believable ending).",1256515200,16,497,4.927710843373494

206790,5,555987308X,"In this film, you will discover the joys of teaching children good values and not to give up.  Finding themselves without a mother, the family of children are given many choices to make.  Do they live in a state run home for children or do they look for their uncle Jack?  The journey takes them over several states until they find their uncle Jack who takes the kids as his own.  Thus making it clear that family does come first.  Good clean family fun!!!!",1170460800,7,457,4.392857142857143

7802512,5,555987308X,I absolutely recommend this movie to be seen by every child possible. I let my daughter watch this for the first time when she was only 4 years old and now she is 34 years old and has 2 young sons. I want to surprise her again after 30 years with this movie so she can set down and watch it with both her boys. A 100% must see for children of all ages... 5 Stars wasn't enough stars for the learning experience children will get from this movie.,1436486400,,445,4.01123595505618
