7929381,3,B000051S5Z,"""Whispering Hope"" was filmed at the impressive Whitehall Metropolitan Tabernacle in Belfast, Ireland. The program started and ended strong. However, the program included other songs and arrangements which seemed to stretch the cast, producing strained voices, encouraging showmanship and resulting in exhausted expressions caught on camera during other solo numbers.

There were some definite highlights. My favorites include: Jake Hess singing ""Doesn't get any Better Than This,"" ""Precious Jesus"" featuring Ivan Parker, ""Whispering Hope"" featuring Larry Ford, and ""Then Came the Morning"" featuring Guy Penrod.

The audience was responsive throughout the concert but seemed to especially enjoy Jess Dixon's rendition of ""Master the Tempest is Raging."" Along the same line the song ""The Life Boat"" sang by David Phelps received a good response.

Other featured artists include: Candy Hemphill Christmas, Sue Dodge, Cynthia Clauson, The Hoppers, The Easters, Terry Blackwood, Russ Taft, Vestal Goodman and many others.

I think I understand Bill Gaither's reason for introducing comedy sketches into the concerts but I felt that in this program they often went beyond good taste, especially performing as guests before a foreign audience.

I enjoyed Gloria Gaither's narrations. The famed Whitehall Metropolitan Tabernacle Choir backing up many of the numbers added a unique dimension to what might have been a mediocre presentation.

Somewhat disappointed, but overall a worthwhile time of inspiration and entertainment.",1314057600,,1519,5.81981981981982
7929382,5,B000051S5Z,"This video is yet another in the Gaither Homecoming Series.  It has a companion video entitled ""Irish Homecoming"". Filmed on location in Ireland, ""Whispering Hope"" offers a look at some of the beautiful Irish scenery.  It contains some old songs and some new songs performed by Homecoming artists we are familiar with and, of course, just the right blend of humor and gospel music.  It is particularly poignant in that it is the last one Rex Nelon was in before he passed away (while on this trip).  Whispering Home continues the consistent quality that fans of the Homecoming videos have come to appreciate.",989884800,5,608,4.87378640776699
