8008033,5,B00018WEN2,"Jo Jo is one of my favorite series. For all the testosterone, it's actually got a solid plot and some of the most interesting yet bizarre characters ever. Highly recommend.",1441152000,,172,4.766666666666667
8008034,5,B00018WEN2,Very pleased. How do I get they rest of this season?,1430265600,,52,3.8181818181818183
8008035,3,B00018WEN2,Hey.  It's JoJo.  It's strange.,1418688000,,31,5.0
8008036,5,B00018WEN2,"Great show, voice acting is a little funny, but what do you expect?",1407628800,,67,4.230769230769231
8008037,2,B00018WEN2,"I don't know what to make of JoJo.  This the most over-the-top anime series ever made.  The animation is gorgeous, the fight scenes are cool and the character designs are unique.  The story and dialogue, however, are beyond ridiculous.

""My next attack will most likely horrify you.""  ""Oh my god.  His next attack is horrifying.""  I warned you that my next attack would be horrifying.""  That's the dialogue you can expect.  It's so bad that it's hilarious.  I'm not sure of the creators expect you to take it seriously, or understand that it's the most brain dead narrative out there and packed full of laughs.

All in all, take a chance on JoJo.  The action kicks ass, and the art is awesome.  What will derail you from the entertainment is the story which is the plainest most predicable clone of an 80's anime, and the dialogue which is either a myriad of comedy genius or the worst thing on record.

It's a risky buy.  You'll either pull loads of fun out of this, or throw it out the window, to ashamed to sell it to another member of humanity.",1384992000,3,1048,4.470899470899471
8008038,5,B00018WEN2,Here is a great adaption of the JoJo manga.,1140825600,,43,3.888888888888889
8008039,5,B00018WEN2,"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is based on the long-running comic book of the same title by Araki Hirohiko (Baoh). Despite the renown of both the series and its creator, it sadly remains overlooked.

The OAV series is based on the 3rd generation of the JoJo storyline, where Hirohiko first presented his unique take on psychic powers, personifying them in the form of Stands. Different people, different powers, different Stands - a very innovative way to present an ego battle to say the least. Yet, even with all their impressive abilities, JoJo's heroes and villains don't just rely on brute force - they use their wits as well. They deduce each other's strengths and weaknesses and they make use of their surroundings with just as much finesse.

The English translation follows that of the Capcom videogame, hence Abdul is ""Avdol"". Hirohiko named many of his characters after Western music icons, hence Vanilla Ice will undoubtedly be changed to ""Iced"" (as Capcom did to avoid legal trouble). The English dub stands out (no pun intended) as one of the better dub jobs in recent times. Many of the actors also lent their voices to Soul Calibur (most notably Doug Boyd, the voice of Kakyoin).

The one thing that could throw off American audiences is the superior animation quality of the first 7 episodes. In the orignal Japanese release, the last 6 episodes were produced first - later on, in Star Wars fashion, a 7 episode ""prequel"" was produced. Super Techno Arts is releasing all 13 episodes in chronological order.

JoJo is definitely one of the better titles out there. Super Techno Arts invests a LOT of time goes into preparing each volume, and the result has always been worth the wait. I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone - anime fan or not.",1123632000,13,1754,4.8561872909699
8008040,4,B00018WEN2,"I rarely write reviews, but I must disagree with the other reviewer here.  This series is about a fighting game, so yes, it has people fighting.  Seems silly to not accept that right off, but I have watched the Tekken movie which I hated and the Street Fighter V series which I enjoyed and would give 3 stars to.  This series is by far better than either of those.  At least the first 2 discs anyway, which are all I have been able to find.  The charaters are diverse enough to be individual and interesting and the art is some of the prettiest I have ever seen in an animated or anime series.  Most of all though, I just like the characters and the fight sequences.  If you do not like fighting games or shows based on them don't get this.  However, if you are a Street Fighter fan, especially a fan of the animated Street Fighter then this is a great series to check out, just be aware you may never be able to find the later episodes.",1111795200,3,937,4.195530726256983
