6729014,5,B00O8BC17M,"Clive Owen stars as the cocaine addicted brilliant surgeon Dr. John W. Thackery in a new television series THE KNICK - a study of the professional and personal lives of the staff at New York's Knickerbocker Hospital during 1900. The series focuses on the operating theater at the Knickerbocker Hospital and the views are suggestive of the great paintings - Rembrandt's Dr. Tulp's Anatomy Lesson or Thomas Eakins's The Clinic of Dr Gross.

We are spectators of surgery before Lister - no gloves, no masks, little prep, and no suction pumps except by manual cranking. The first witnessed operation is a Caesarean section for placenta previa that goes wrong and the second surgery - a battle of wits between Clive Owen's Dr. Thackery and the new African American Surgeon Dr. Algernon Edwards (Andr&eacute; Holland) recommended for staff privileges by the wealthy family that keeps the Knick afloat - is a demonstration of a small bowel resection and the first use of spinal anesthesia. The fine cast includes Michael Angarano, Juliet Rylance, Eric Johnson, Cara Seymour, David Fierro and other fine actors.

The series examined  the coarse status of medicine in the early 20th century accompanied by sidebars of police intervention in ambulance deliveries, graft, corruption, abortion, racism, drug addiction, and the slow progress of medicine as it grows out of errors. Not for viewers with queasy stomachs but a very fine series that hopefully will be returning for another season - or two. Grady Harp, November 14",1416268800,62,1513,5.117408906882591
6729015,5,B00O8BC17M,"This series is so gasp-worthy, dark, gory, historically accurate and really out there.  I can't wait for Season 2 ... and to watch Season 1 all over again.  I agree with one of the previous commenters, that the music was a little modern and techno for the period in which the series is set.  I love love love Clive Owen, but his whispery, gravelly voice was a little hard to understand at times.  Maybe it was my sound system, but I had no trouble hearing the other characters.",1415836800,23,477,4.386363636363637
6729016,4,B00O8BC17M,"I am enjoying this series but I find the music in it hard to get around. It`s awful and at times seems to dominate. Sometimes it has a bubbly sound and some of the sentimental scenes have a piano playing a plink, plink sound. I try to overlook that, I don`t want to stop watching a good series. The performers are great, Clive Owen is amazing. The settings for that period are very well done and you really get a feel for those times. A lot of scenes in it are gory and graphic, the topics disturbing. I think that the average person could feel injured seeing how the brilliant young black doctor was spoken to and how minorities were treated. When you see how medical problems were handled back then it makes you appreciate today`s technology. I look forward to watching the rest of it. This kind of music worked in Solaris even though it was a bit heavy handed in some parts. Just didn`t work in The Knick.",1415577600,4,908,4.347058823529411

6729036,5,B00O8BC17M,"By far my favourite hospital drama. An audacious,unique show with great characters (Clive Owen as Dr. Thackery is superb) and a truly fascinating turn-of-the-century setting. Fans of Steven Soderbergh's films (""Contagion"" in particular) will not be disappointed. I respect that they show medicine in a realistic clinical tone,yet a sense of humor and irony,and the drama is tense and exciting. This set comes in a really cool sleeve,unfortunately there are very little extras at all. A definite recommendation.",1480809600,,510,5.551282051282051

6729046,3,B00O8BC17M,"Started out very promising -- the challenges and setbacks of early medicine (specifically, surgery) set realistically in its time frame.  I found it all very believable and engrossing, until about three episodes from the finale, when fatigued from the casualties from a race riot, four of the characters pair off and from then on it becomes sidetracked into the consequences of their relationships and the downward spiral they take.  Not only was this depressing, but completely derailed the story and its interest for me.  It's almost as if the writers decided ""we must show some sex and drug addiction on this show to improve ratings.""  I had preordered season 2 but cancelled.  I haven't even bothered to watch the finale, because it's fairly predictable how things will progress.  I also don't find it realistic that two of the characters, being well-educated and well brought up, would not think out the consequences of what a sexual relationship would entail.  Now I wish there was ANOTHER show that would continue what this series started -- a medical drama of the time without grotesque relationships.  Meanwhile if the writers wanted to show a real medical descent into madness, they could make a show based on the life of Dr. Mudgett aka H.H. Holmes -- mass murderer and creator of the ""murder castle.""  That would be something lurid they could sink their teeth into!",1467158400,,1377,4.952173913043478

6729051,4,B00O8BC17M,"I bought this DVD because I wanted to research life depicted in the turn of the century America. While I found some parts of the drama useful, I found it dark, depressing, and an overall downer at times. This DVD set includes 10 episodes aired on cable television. The series is about a hospital known as the Knick in New York City in 1900. The series follows a wide array of well-developed characters like a drug addicted doctor; an African American doctor and surgeon who faces racism upon his arrival; a determined female hospital administrator; a mysterious nun; and others in the growing field of medicine at the turn of the century.

The series stays true to history in following life including the change from gaslight to electricity as a major source of power in hospitals. The cast does a first rate job in acting and the writing is a bit dark most of the time. Much of the cases are about death, doom, and terminal illnesses. Sadly, this was a fact of life in reality at the turn of the century because of illnesses and plagues.

If you enjoy a good drama, you might enjoy ""the Knick.""",1462233600,,1095,4.525252525252525
6729052,5,B00O8BC17M,"It makes me sad that this wonderful series didn't make it to at least the third season, because it was so well written and acted. I love any show that  takes place in the past, but the subject matter of this show is fascinating. Set in NYC at the turn of the 20th Century, doctors & nurses struggle to aid the sick at the Knickerbocker Hospital (The Knick). I loved how this show was not afraid to tackle subjects that we still wrestle with today...racism, sexism, governmental corruption, abortion, just to name a few. The characters are well rounded and you care for them. With the battle the hospital staff must wage on behalf of their patients with the medicine & equipment of that era, it makes you grateful for modern medical practices.",1462233600,5,742,4.578947368421052

6729062,5,B00O8BC17M,"The Knick is awesome. After years of watching the tepid Don Draper fulfill the role of the modern anti-hero, it is a great pleasure to see Clive Owen consume the screen as Doctor Thackery, a drug-addicted, racist, self-absorbed, and totally brilliant/f-ed-up surgeon. The stories rely a bit too much on dramatic irony and Soderbergh's direction is distractingly ""art on a budget"" (he shoots many scenes without traditional coverage), but Owen and the equally wonderful Andre Holland create a simmering, intense rivalry/friendship that pays off like few other pairings in this so-called ""Golden Age"" of television. Season One is what's being reviewed here, but Season Two - better in some ways, not as good in others - is also well worth seeing. I only wish there was a collector's edition with a signed pair of Thackery's bad-ass white surgical boots and a vial of medical cocaine. If you like good things, watch with confidence.",1454371200,4,929,5.078431372549019

I was offended by the sexism, racism, class system, and general lack of principles on the part of the characters. The main character, Thackery, is a thoroughly reprehensible human being. He's based on Halsted, who was a leading light of surgery in that time period, but was also a cocaine and morphine addict.
As a physician, I am aware that surgery was not well developed during this time, but it still bothers me to see the lack of sterile procedure and spotty anesthesia on display.
I received this Season 1 set as a Christmas gift from a well meaning relative, but I am returning it unopened and unwatched, for the reasons outlined above. I have watched more than half this series, and think I am qualified to express an opinion.",1451001600,5,943,4.552941176470588

6729080,4,B00O8BC17M,Not for the faint of heart or the puritanical sensitive being. Can't fathom where season two will take us. The end of season one reminds one of Houses series where he ends up in an institute due to addiction. Then again not much more matches up between those two series. I am upset a bit and have to check the FACTS about the story line of who developed the blood type information and made it possible for safe transfusions. My memory is a black man did that on his own in the early 20'th century and some years later he was in an accident and was refused service at the WHITE hospitals because he was black and he might have survived if he had been given a transfusion. Or so that story of history has been sold/told to us. Maybe they intend to kill off the black doctor way too soon..but I do not see that happening. It is one of the more interesting tensions both under stated and over stated at times both going on here. Man so glad we live in todays world. I shudder to realize my grandparents would have grown up in these days both having been born prior to 1900's and were married in 1915. Time has a way of going by so fast and this  series points to just how fast our technology in modern years has taken us to understand so much both in diseases and health and medicine and HUMANITY.,1450310400,,1293,4.213709677419355

The acting is superlative from the lead roles to the supporting players, the reproduction of gaslight era/early 1900's New York excellently done (was that Boys H.S. in Brooklyn where I attended many meetings in my teaching career, the same Boys High that at one time was one of the finest public high schools in the nation being used as the ""Knick""?

As well, although the lighting is probably an accurate recreation of the indoor lighting of those times before the invention of electric lights, the dimness is really annoying.

This series is a victim to the ""sex and drugs"" pitfall that's so popular these days; particularly later in the season with drugs.  I find this distracting but if the viewer enjoys this combo, it might be a plus. Despite this it does offer a very entertaining cast of characters that it continually develops at a very entertaining point in time for medicine.  There is a character that deserves special mention, Clive Owen aside, and that is medicine.

6729127,5,B00O8BC17M,"Its probably best not to watch this just before your elective surgery: techniques and knowledge have, of course, improved, vastly, over the last hundred years or so, but the images the series presents are graphic and brilliantly realized.  The setting is The Knickerbocker Hospital (or Knick), a fictional hospital, inspired by a similar institution in New York at the turn of the Nineteenth Century; the middle of the Belle poque in Europe and towards the end of The Gilded Age, in America, during which the great philanthropists, (or Robber Barons depending on your viewpoint), such as Andrew Carnegie, distributed largesse and endowed museums and colleges, etc. and, of course, hospitals.

Clive Owen plays Dr John W. Thackery, a driven man: a man obsessed with being the best; a surgeon at the top of his game displaying his unmatched skill and the arrogance that comes from routine success when the stakes are nothing less than life and death.  But success doesnt come free and its almost Faustian cost is vividly portrayed.

The production values are superb and evoke the spirit of an age when advances in science and technology were making anything seem possible.  This is underscored by a pulsing, seemingly anachronistic, techno soundtrack, which is definitely not evocative of 1900 but which works because, in a kind of every second counts way, it serves as a leitmotif for Thackerays obsessive drive for perfection.

The foundation for all of this is Steven Soderberghs brilliant direction, which draws excellent performances from a uniformly top-notch cast: all of human life is here; the sordid, the glorious, the sacred and the profane.

All in all, its informative, exciting and educative and makes for exhilarating entertainment.",1440806400,,1745,5.1886120996441285

6729129,5,B00O8BC17M,"The Knick is outstanding television.  Do yourself a favor and watch it, but be prepared to face the unsparing and unrelenting portrayal of a world that can be very dark.

The entire first season is directed by Steven Soderbergh, and he acts as a producer as well.  With The Knick, Soderbergh hits one of his classic (Erin Brockovich, Traffic) combinations of entertainment, information, and social message out of the park.

The show follows the events of 1900 at a New York City hospital called The Knickerbocker, located downtown in what was once an upper class neighborhood that is now being abandoned to the poor.  The key character, Dr. John Thackery (Clive Owen,) becomes chief of surgery after his teacher and mentor kills himself in despair after losing his twelfth mother and child in an ongoing futile attempt to save patients giving birth with placenta previa.  Thackery is obviously modeled on the great American surgical pioneer William Halsted, who makes a cameo appearance in one episode.  Like Halsted, he is tirelessly dedicated to advancing medicine, especially surgery, and saving lives not only among his own patients but throughout the world based on his innovations.  Like Halsted, he can be harsh and demanding of those around him.  And like Halsted, he has become addicted to injecting cocaine during the day to boost his energy and confidence and using opium at night to calm himself for sleep.  Unlike Halsted, he appears to have come from a lower class background and advanced in medicine through the apprenticeship program that still existed at the time rather than attending medical school, although we never fully learn his background.

The Knick features an outstanding supporting cast, almost all British and Irish actors.  The support cast brings with them a series of subplots involving the social and economic milieu of New York City in 1900, from the gilded age industrial titans to the immigrants crammed in festering tenements, with the African Americans at the very bottom, excluded not only from holding the positions they are qualified for  a young African American surgeon trained in Europe (Andre Holland) and the group of black women menials he trains to run an impromptu surgical program in the basement  but from health care itself.  Prejudice, class hatred and contempt, callousness and corruption, and criminal behavior march alongside idealism, reform, and scientific and social progress.

The Knick has been criticized as presenting worn clichs of both events and characters, but that stems from the fact that it is true to the history of the time, and the behavior and conditions of the time now seem to us to be clichs.  However, to depart from those facts would be to depart from the truth: turn of the century New York and its citizens really were exactly as portrayed in the show, and to change that would be like portraying the Battle of Gettysburg without the heroism, the mistakes, or the carnage.  In terms of character development and plot, there is no sparing of any of the characters, with all of them flawed, tempted, and failing.

That is the one thing that will bother many viewers.  The Knick in the end is true to the history of the times, and that history is very dark indeed.  Medical care is gruesome, bloody, often fails, and often seems foolish by modern standards, but that is the way things happened.  Throughout turn of the century New York people die, lives are ruined, and venality and corruption triumph more often than not.

The one bright thing is that we, looking back from 115 years later, know how the story ends, and know that in the end, progress will come and the world will improve.  The Knick is the story of how that happened, seen from the trenches.",1440633600,3,3738,4.915605095541402
6729130,2,B00O8BC17M,"The Knick is an interesting show which isn't what Id call enjoyable or rewarding. Focusing on the birth of the modern medical age the Knick is based on the Knickerbocker hospital in the early 1900s as well as the staff that runs it.  The series is intentionally bleak. That bleakness extends to both the cast and production values. The cast is composed of medical personnel at the dawning age of surgery as a legitimate solution to health problems. The show features an ensemble whose characters are fairly one dimensional and feature plotlines that are almost universally stereo typical and completely predictable.  Racism, narcotics being used as painkillers, drug addiction, misogyny and  acute attentional to detail when presenting the barbaric medical techniques in their infant form are all rampant through the series. From a narrative perspective these are the themes that drive the plot forward. Unfortunately, these are all presented in a stereotypical and mundane manner that neither surprises nor engages the viewer. Every major piece of character development can be guessed the moment the characters are introduced.

For example, a wealthy female from a well off family falling for a downtrodden doctor of an opposite race in a forbidden tryst.  Or a brute and a nun, you never predicted theyd become friends did you? Nearly everything presented in The Knick season one has been done before and often times better. The composition of the show itself is also something of a bother. While the production values appear high, set design is both accurate and engaging, the direction of Steven Soderbergh will leave most viewers scratching their heads. His love of hand held cameras, generic camera angles, natural lighting which leaves numerous scenes dark actually detracts from the performances of his cast.  There were many times where I was drawn out of a pivotal scene due to the constant shaking of a camera of a flat out inability to see characters that were speaking. On the plus side is the Clive Owen playing the main lead of Dr. John Thackerry. He plays the substance abusing madman with great tenacity and is far and away the highlight of the cast and show. Still, his entire character arc is wholly predictable and offers no surprises.

Overall, The Knick season one is a considerably mixed bag. An excellent lead performance and production values are marred by a very weak narrative and even weaker supporting cast. I don't recommend it at full price but at a budget buy it may be worth a go. If for nothing else the show gives you an idea of how far the medical field has come over the last century and makes you wonder just how far well go in the next one. Just imho anyhow.",1440633600,10,2697,4.888402625820569
6729131,4,B00O8BC17M,"Any show that falls under the description of period piece has a considerably harder time getting made due to the high expense involved in reproducing a bygone era combined with the seemingly increasing likelihood that the show won't make it past its first season and, ultimately, make its broadcast network a profit. That probably explains why shows fitting that description, like Deadwood, Rome, and now The Knick, tend to pop up more on premium networks where recouping expenses through advertising isn't a concern: they just need to produce compelling drama and see if their audience, whove already paid, will bite. The Knick boasts production values that beautifully recreate early 1900s New York and boasts a cast led by Clive Owen that seizes your attention in the first 10 minutes of the pilot and keeps you entrancedunless you're a bit squeamish at the sight of fake blood and body partsthrough the seasons end.

Sewing together familiar characterizations and dynamics from tried and true shows like Mad Men, House, and more, The Knick creates a number of different worlds within its prestigious but underfunded hospital and ties them together in the operating room, the bloody beating heart of the series. It starts with a literal bang in an act that simultaneously takes away the chief surgeon and mentor to Dr. John W. Thackery (Owen) and works to fill us in on the nature of the work of 1900s-era surgeons: they're fighting a losing war with death and the setbacks in innovation can be severely demoralizing.  Just as Thackery steps into his new position as The Knickerbocker Hospitals chief surgeon, he gets his first taste of politics as the hospital administrator Cornelia (Juliet Rylance) forces him to take on Dr. Algernon Edwards (Andre Holland) as his new second-in-command, which rankles Thackerys original choice Dr. Everett Gallinger (Eric Johnson).

Meanwhile, the hospital struggles to keep the lights on due to an administrator (Herman Barrow) embezzling funds from key projects;  ambulance man Mr. Cleary (Chris Sullivan) and his verbal sparring partner Sister Harriet (Cara Seymour) strike up a controversial private side business; a new nurse (Eve Hewson) takes a keen interest in Dr. Thackery despite the advances of his protg Dr. Bertie Chickering (Michael Angarano).

With so many stories going on simultaneously it would be easy to understand if one or two side characters fell by the wayside and their stories ended abruptly, but instead every story is pursued and most of them to very interesting ends. The overarching story, of course, follows Dr. Thackery who balances a chemical dependency (cocaineand then some) with his drive to conquer death and his invention of new techniques to perform surgeries (like a C-section) that have historically resulted in death due to well-documented but seemingly uncombatable factors. His initial clash with Dr. Edwards ultimately bears some great dramatic and comic fruits as Edwardss off the books enterprises end up playing a pivotal role in the evolution of treatment at the hospital as well as a lynchpin in a race riot.

Plot-wise, The Knick goes to some wild extremes, but the pay-off always comes in the form of more character development that keeps The Knicks slow-burning flame at a steady intensity. At times it feels like certain plot points are pushed along faster than they need to be (like Thackerys drug addiction) and other threads (like Thackerys potential rivalry with Dr. Zinberg) are cheated of further development because they're being used for no other reason than to create a breaking point for other stories. It could just be a case of having too many balls in the air and the writers feeling the need to land them all before the seasons end, but it feels more like The Knicks writers thought theyd have one or two more episodes for their season and thus just had to wrap up threads sooner than expected. Either way, these are minor complaints in a show that got most everything right straight out of the gate.

With Steven Soderberghs guiding every episode as Director, production values are top-notch with some beautiful sets and well done but understandably limited outdoors shots. The most striking thing from a visual perspective, however, are the surgery scenes which don't shy away from gushing blood for the sake of portraying the grim reality of early 1900s surgery. Combine that with an eerie but fun electronic soundtrack which contrasts which the analog world were watching, and the show stands out as a memorable period piece series.

The Blu-ray set also includes an Ultraviolet digital copy.

6729137,5,B00O8BC17M,"This is a fascinating series which sometimes feels like a horror film--say, Stonehearst Asylum, set in New York in 1900.  The date is crucial.  Hospital schools were just beginning to train surgeons.  Fewer people died because of surgery due to the development had become antiseptics.  Modern surgery was in its infancy.  All of the disturbing things that show up in the series--like taking a mental asylum patient's teeth out--ALL of them!--actually happened.  Heroin really was thought to be the cure for cocaine addiction.  Typhoid Mary is thrown in for good measure. Episodes 1 is great. 2-3 are really good. 4, 5, and 6 are middling, sometimes boring, but still containing  some very good scenes, as subplots get developed.  Then the show really, really picks up steam as the plot gets darker and darker in episodes 7,8, 9 and 10.  The reveal in last shot of the finale is just crushing.  Clive Owens is great.  So is the actress who plays Nurse Elkins (she is Bono's daughter, btw).  The cinematography and editing are original and gripping.  Soderbergh has done us all a favor by moving from film not a two-season series.  I read on a UK science museum site that "" It was not until the development of safe blood transfusion and antibiotics such as penicillin in the early 1940s that surgery became relatively safe.""",1439683200,,1322,4.839285714285714

6729142,5,B00O8BC17M,"Terrific, tense, and totally groundbreaking, showcasing some of the bloodiest operation scenes Ive ever seen and probably ever filmed, The Knick is one of the best shows on television or any medium for that matter, period. Series creators Jack Amiel and Michael Begler deserve a round of applause. These two do most of the writing for the show leading to episodes that are fantastically entertaining and hypnotic in a way that you cant take your eyes off the screen. The same could be said for Clive Owen. He is brilliantly haunting as Dr. John W. Thackery in one of the best performances of his career. The direction by Steven Soderbergh is sublime, making every episode worth watching and always wanting to see more. The score contributes to the hypnotic, haunting quality of the Knick with electronic beats that elevate the scene into a mixture of nearly unbearable tension and intrigue. Ive seen seven of the ten episodes so far, and the show has just peaked in it seventh episode Get the Rope. Riddled with near-constant suspense, Get the Rope is the episode that convinced me The Knick is unlike anything youve ever seen and uniquely dark in its portrayal of New York City in 1900. This is a period of time that is very interesting, but that has barely been touched by film, or any medium for that matter, in the thoroughly entertaining way that The Knick is doing now. This beautiful piece of television was made possible by HBO, the owner of Cinemax, which is constantly proving that they are the best network to produce shows and that they really care about the quality of the work that is evident throughout the past decade. Back to the acting, I cant say enough good things about Clive Owen. Ive been a fan since Children of Men, but he really out does himself in this portraying one of his most compelling characters to date. As for the rest of the cast, they're super-charged with a genius that is staggering. Props go to Andre Holland, Eve Hewson, Juliet Rylance, Michael Angarano in juicy, rich roles that will surely change their careers. Soderberghs a true auteur, directing all ten episodes of the first season and making his mark on contemporary television and, in a larger sense, the Golden Age of Television. Each episode leaves you wanting more, Soderbergh creating suspense and live-wire tension this show thrives on and guiding the actors to the max of their ability leaves viewers thirsting for more. I don't think I could like this show anymore than I already do, its completely engrossing and a must-watch.",1434240000,17,2533,4.7853881278538815
6729143,5,B00O8BC17M,"The Knick, starring Clive Owen and Andre Holland, is a medical drama based in the early twentieth century. Owens character, Dr. John Thackery, is the a brilliant surgeon trying to become one of the best surgeons but deals with his own personal addiction problems; yet the show does not fall into stereotypical flatness seen in other shows. Rather, the show grapples with numerous other plot motifs which make for both an interesting drama and further thought.

 For example, the show demonstrates racial tension during the early twentieth century in New York. Dr. Algernon Edwards, a black physician, deals with racial tension and discrepancies in addition to his medical practice. Dr. Thackery refused to hire Dr. Edwards, and after he is hired, the Dr. Thanckery refuses to acknowledge his accomplishments. The show also touches upon issues of healthcare access, which are still issues today. When Dr. Edwards realizes there are no black patients at the hospital, he proceeds to open a health clinic in the basement. While watching the way issues of access were approached in the early twentieth century, I was able to consider modern day access and draw parallels that were thought provoking.

 Furthermore, the show did extensive research on healthcare during the time period and accurately demonstrated health practices. For example, doctors never wear gloves during procedures and they use hand cranks. If you are squeamish, I would not recommend this show. Overall, I really enjoyed season 1 and cant wait for seasons to come!",1426809600,4,1533,5.194331983805668
6729144,4,B00O8BC17M,"The Knick is a medical drama about a New York Hospital in the early 1900s.  While Dr. John Thackery, the hospitals Chief Surgeon, essentially fits the genius with a drug problem (in this case cocaine) persona that is so prevalent in modern day television, the show is ripe with character defining interactions that help build character depth.  For example, while Dr. Thackery is a great surgeon, he stubbornly refuses to hire Dr. Edwards because he is black.  In fact, one of the strengths of the show is in portraying the marginalized groups of the time period.  Not only does Dr. Thackery refuse to hire Dr. Edwards, after he is forced to make the hire, he initially works as hard as possible not to acknowledge Dr. Edwards abilities.  Furthermore, Dr. Edwards quickly discovers that blacks are not treated at the hospital and is forced to starting his a clinic in the hospital basement.  Racial tensions and their violent consequences also come into play later on in the first season. In addition to recognizing the marginalization of blacks, the show also depicts the struggles of women and immigrants during the time period: Cornelia Robertson has difficulties with her position of power at the hospital because she is not respected as a woman and a dying immigrant woman sends her young girl off to work at the factory in the first episode.  Overall, if you are not afraid of gore and want to learn some more about the problems that plagued medicine in the early 1900s (such as corruption, drug abuse, racism, and sexism), it is definitely worth giving this show a shot.  It immerses you into the time period and, occasionally, has you on the edge of your seat.",1426723200,3,1667,4.7839721254355405
6729145,5,B00O8BC17M,"The Knick has become one of my favorite television series, and Season 2 will be must-watch TV for me. Set in the Knickerbocker Hospital of in New York City in the early 1900's, The Knick explores several social and public health issues by examining the interactions in this central location. Dr. John Thackery, played by Clive Owen, battles drug addiction and ego as he strives to become one of the most renowned surgeons of his time. Dr. Algernon Edwards, a black physician portrayed by Andre Holland, also strives for success in medicine but constantly battles prejudice and oppression as a black man in America. Several other interesting characters struggle through everyday life at the Knick.

While the individual characters are very interesting, what I found to be fascinating was the The Knick's portrayal of medical practices at the turn of the 20th Century. Doctors perform surgeries on patients without gloves. Liquid cocaine, along with ether, are chosen as analgesics for patients by doctors. Dramatic irony is rampant throughout Season 1 as the audience cringes at the some of the decisions medical professionals make. However, medical understanding was truly lacking in 1900 when compared to 2015. The Knick made me wonder which of our practices today, such as chemotherapy, will future generations cringe at because of our lack of understanding.

In summation, I would highly recommend the Knick, especially to lovers of good character dramas or to people with interests in medical practices or public health. I watched the entire season in less than a week and cannot wait for the next one.",1426723200,23,1606,5.125954198473282
6729146,4,B00O8BC17M,"The Knick was an interesting and exciting show to watch.  I really enjoyed the intersection of race and medicine that was present through out the series. Although there was only one black doctor in the show, the racism that was prevalent in society at the time was evident.  The show demonstrates that racism extends across all other boundaries- for example, regardless of education or  economics, it prevails.  The white characters in the show were racist against poor blacks and even Dr. Edwards.  Also, this show is not only about black vs white, but it examines the prejudice that immigrants faced as well.
I think the medical aspect of the show was very interesting.  Especially how the doctors in the show justified their experimentation on various subjects as furthering science.  There was a theme through out the show of the importance of science and need to further medicine.  Also, the fact that people avoided going to hospitals because they were likely to die there was interesting.
Also, when the board of the hospital was discussing moving the hospital uptown to where all the white people lived, I thought it was a very evident example of white flight, which is a theme that we continue to see in today's society.  The hospital was more concerned about making a profit, instead of helping those in need.
I found the characters in the show very entertaining- they all had various strengths and weaknesses which made them intriguing.  I found Dr. Thackery's addiction to opiates an interesting sub-plot that was present through out the season.  It is an ironic example of a brilliant doctor who is addicted to medicine, and justifies this addiction by using it side effects to make more progress.
I would recommend the show to others, especially if interested in early medicine (1900) and the connections between race and medicine.",1426723200,7,1845,4.957792207792208

This is such a fascinating show about medicine and medical/surgical innovations around the 1900s that is somewhat historically accurate. The characters and setting of the show are so deep and well-written and portrayed that it is so easy to get sucked right in to the ""The Knick"" world. I have an educational background in medicine so I found it fascinating on its face; the plot and characters locked me into the drama of Dr. John Thackeray and the Knickerbocker Hospital.",1502582400,,536,4.836956521739131
