2924747,3,B000URLG4W,"I've been searching for more ball workouts.  This one was recommended here, but I have to say, I was very disappointed with my first try.  I just did not click with this instructor, and I found her bland and unmotivating.  I didn't even finish this workout, because I was just bored.  I'm intermediate to advanced, and need some enthusiasm from the instructor to keep me motivated.  This one will not be in my rotation.  Very disappointing.",1203984000,2,440,4.723684210526316
2924748,4,B000URLG4W,"This video is wonderful to do in my living room at home. The instructor is pleasant and makes working out an enjoyable experience. The first time I did the workout, I thought...this isn't that bad! However, later in the day and ALL next day I was sore all over. I like how it works you out without feeling like it. I am not watching the clock waiting for the torture to be over... I highly reccommend this video and plan on getting others made by this instructor.
The reason for the 4 stars is the video quality...it is semi-professionally made...some of the transitions are rough...but not bad. The workout is still great!",1202428800,,623,4.571428571428571
2924749,5,B000URLG4W,"I love this workout.  It is difficult, but I am a beginner to this type of exercise and I was able to do most of the moves.  It is a great workout!",1201651200,,147,3.5625
2924750,5,B000URLG4W,"This workout gets every part of my body working! I felt some muscles I didn't know I had! The instructor makes you feel like you are right there with her and is very encouraging!  I like that there are so many different exercises and that all I need is the ball.  I got a ball to stretch my back but didn't know what else to do with it, but now with this dvd I have so many exercises I can do!  This is the most complete dvd I have seen covering every bodypart and how to work it with the ball.  A great workout!",1197676800,,512,3.894230769230769
2924751,5,B000URLG4W,"This is one of the best ""on the ball"" workout DVDs I have ever used, and I have used many. Kira gives very clear instructions throughout the workout and suggests ways to make it more challenging for those who want to step it up to the next level. The exercises are great and target muscles you didn't know you had, and believe me you will feel them the next day. I am impatiently looking forward to ""Just add weights"" edition of the Ball Sculpt DVD. Kira makes her workouts fun and intense at the same time, which actually makes me look forward to using them regularly in my routine.",1191542400,7,583,4.3577981651376145
2924752,5,B000URLG4W,Amazing ball workout! Felt sore in the right places! Finally something fun to do with my ball!,1190764800,4,94,4.588235294117647
2924753,5,B000URLG4W,"This video is one of my favorites...the moves on the ball are great for any fitness level, and they really work the core muscles.  Kira's commentary and instruction throughout the workout really help keep proper form, and there are enough reps and sets of each exercise to really master each before moving on...

This is a great workout video!  Snap this up, and don't forget to buy your ball too!",1188345600,8,397,4.642857142857143
8214531,5,B000URLG4W,I really thought this work out would be a little cruisy/easy but man its a REALLY tough one! really enjoyed it too! my abs were aching for days after haha :),1284249600,,157,4.096774193548387
8214532,4,B000URLG4W,"I consider myself a intermediate exerciser when it comes to the ball. I have done some exercise with it at the gym, but wanted to learn more. I found this video had alot of good exercises and options. You do stuff on the ball, on the floor and simple things like lunges holding the ball and turning, which is not as easy as it looks!  I also like that it is set up like several mini workouts so I can do a quickie when I am short on time.

I don't understand the issues others wrote about the production quality of this video. I can see that it is done outdoors and there are many full body shots, probably so you can see the whole ball.  It's not one of those  ""overly produced"" videos where you see more of the instructor than the exercise demonstration.  I actually like the music used, it's not overpowering or that obnoxious beat we normally hear on videos.  The instructor is not one of those a bubbly, overly excited instructors, but sure gives good reminders of what to squeeze and focus on while doing each exercise.

I almost didn't get this because of the comments on production.  I am glad I ignored them! This is more like having a trainer teach you on the ball than a group exercise instructor try to hype you through a workout.  I am very happy with this purchase!",1213488000,2,1279,4.317991631799163
8214533,1,B000URLG4W,"I am so disapppinted in this video.  It is like a home video and very poorly made.  the exercises are just OK but I expected superb from the description and reviews.  In a word, YUK!",1212537600,,182,4.142857142857143
8214534,5,B000URLG4W,"I liked the Ab sculpt and Yoga workout on the ball from this instructor so I got this one to do more with my ball!  There are so many exercises and the instructor gives variations, even if she doesn't do a lot of them, at least she gives you an idea of what else can be done with the ball and how to change up your workout.  I love using the ball!!

I really like that this dvd is divided into mini workouts: Upper body, Abs and 3 workouts for lower body! ( I needed that!) One standing and one sitting on the ball and one laying on the floor too! I have done all of them and felt all of them too, especially the chest, abs and back of my legs, yeah! :)

I did the voice only mix first, and there was occasionally a squeak, from the mic I guess, but then I used the music mix and it all sounded normal to me.  I really enjoy the music on this one, it doesn't stink like most exercise dvd music does!  I am glad I did not read the low rated reviews b/f getting this, b/c I am VERY happy with this purchase!",1208822400,,1005,3.8780487804878048
8214535,5,B000URLG4W,"This workout is packed with fabulous exercises, I love it! It helps me with strengthening my back, my abs and core (for my golf!) I can do parts of this workout at anytime, since it divided into segments. The ball is so relaxing too, that I find myself doing some of this workout in the morning and when I get home from work.  The outdoor setting adds to the stress release I feel even when my muscles are burning! I also like the option to have music or just listen to the instructor. I would recommend this for beginners and intermediates but advanced can benefit too.",1208217600,,570,4.377358490566038
8214536,5,B000URLG4W,I've done Denise Austin's ball video and then I purchased Kira's.  I found this instructor very instructional...lots of information and a true workout!  She doesn't act like a barbie doll and my muscles are feeling the pain in all the right places.  The sound is what I would expect from an outside workout and I enjoy the scenery in addition to the workout.  I would highly recommend trying this workout!  I love it!,1206576000,,417,4.657534246575342
8214537,2,B000URLG4W,"Number one: HORRIBLE production quality. The sound is awful.
Her instruction is seriously lacking. It's like she's just making it up as she goes along. I won't deny that the lower body segment works your body, but the upper body is pretty lame and the ab segment is just so-so. There's supposed to be a 40 minute total body workout, but my DVD will NOT play it. Pretty pathetic. I have removed it from my rotation and will be donating it to my library. Skip this one.",1206489600,,467,4.379310344827586
8214538,5,B000URLG4W,"I love the variety that a stability ball can add to your workout. Let's face it, they are fun! Kira knows her stuff. She knows how to help get you into shape. If you want to get in shape and have some fun on the ball, check out this workout! Great for beginners but intermediates can use it too by really focusing on the movements!",1205193600,,331,4.107692307692307
8214539,1,B000URLG4W,"I have to say, I wasn't that happy with the production of this DVD.  She's not that good of an instructor and the production was awful.  It was like she just set up a video camera and just went to it.  In some cases she was hard to hear.  Not thrilled with this purchase.",1204761600,,271,3.962962962962963
8214540,1,B000URLG4W,I was so disappointed with this ball workout that I called amazon to see if I could return it.  I've had many better ball workouts at my gym.  This young lady was definitely not a pro and it was filmed in her back yard and living room.  It might be worth $5 but definitely not $17! Look some more for a better option.,1204675200,,317,4.0
