8010232,5,B0001CNRUC,"Jack Nicholson and Roger Corman fans will be extremely proud to get Vintage Home Entertainment's ""Jack Nicholson Cult Classics"" Triple Feature DVD as it features three of his early film classics (two of which were directed by the legendary Roger Corman) such as THE TERROR (1963),LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS (1960),and HELL'S ANGELS ON WHEELS (1967).The print and sound quality of THE TERROR is absolutely outstanding which has been remastered from the original Technicolor print,compared to crummy VHS and DVD releases which are washed-out and faded,as this film never looked so much better than when audiences had seen it in 1963!!! How amazing is that!! Corman's other cult classic,THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS,also has great picture and sound quality,compared to other shoddy VHS and DVD versions which are mostly taken from poorly made 16mm dupes,and in its original,glorious black & white!! 1967's HELL'S ANGELS ON WHEELS however,didn't fair much better,although the print is grainy and worn-out,the sound is great but the dialogue is almost out-of-sync with the picture as the dialogue is about a second off. Nevertheless,this set contains all three films in their entirety AND it gives you two options on the main menu to watch the films separately or all together!!! I strongly recommend this DVD for any fan of these films and that these films have introduced Jack Nicholson to the entire world and has gone on to win three Oscars and become one of the biggest actors in Hollywood history!!! Ten cheers to Vintage for putting out a great DVD set of three great films starring Jack!!!!",1078531200,17,1587,5.107692307692307
