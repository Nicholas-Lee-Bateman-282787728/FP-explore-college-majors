But why did I pay 35-something dollars for this import from Spain or Europe or wherever it was from?  It took weeks to arrive.  It was more expensive than ""It's a Wonderful Life"" DVD's here which I could have bought or rented for a few bucks.  But THIS one said it was DUBBED.  Dubbed in Castillian.  Yes, on the case, the language shows English with Spanish subtitles, but it also says DUBBED.  I may be completely mistaken, but I thought DUBBED mean voice-over .... audio.  After waiting WEEKs for this particular video to arrive and after gathering a small Spanish-speaking family over to my house, making my silly popcorn balls and rice Krispy treats and punch and soda and pizza, we settle down to watch this long-awaited thing and find no settings or clicks, icons or pathways for Spanish audio.  The only different between this DVD and a nearer one is that this one has a different PICTURE on the FRONT with a TITLE that's in Spanish.  Big whoop. I am so angry and disappointed. I wish I hadn't spent this money, I wish I could get my money BACK.  And if I'm wrong about it ""not"" being dubbed, then I'll be embarrassed but STILL give it one star for not making the setting/function obvious.  Bummer.  Bummer, bummer, bummer.",1498262400,,1312,4.485232067510548
