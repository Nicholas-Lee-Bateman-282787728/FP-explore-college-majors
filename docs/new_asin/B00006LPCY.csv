7971471,4,B00006LPCY,"Stark black and white and crisp scenes. Music is good and fits the mood of the film.

This film is different in many ways from Fassbinder's Merchant of 4 Seasons and The Marriage of Maria Braun.

Fassbinder has a way of casting females, and it is worth watching.",1369526400,,262,4.4375
7971472,5,B00006LPCY,Fassbinder's complex blend of American gangsterism and Godard-like comedy coalesces magnificently in this early work. An American Soldier returns to Germany after the Vietnam as a contract killer-but this is not a simple indictment of American violence. The magnificent agglomeration of artistic and political accumulate here-in a way it is Fassbinder's most alive film. It is here that you at last are allowed to witness pure cinematic naturalism with the vitality of the German New Wave. An incomparable masterpiece on many levels.,1279497600,,533,5.512195121951219
7971473,4,B00006LPCY,"One of Fassbinder's early films, ""The American Gangster"" is part parody of cheap, hardboiled detective movies and part existential commentary on human loneliness.  The real genius of the film is that it succeeds in making the viewer chuckle at the deadpan ways in which it spoofs film noir without trivializing the underlying theme of loneliness.

The plot is quickly told.  Ricky, a native German who somehow wound up fighting in Vietnam, returns to Germany as a hitman hired by a trio of bumbling cops unable to stop the crimewave in their town.  Ricky is a hard drinker and hard lover who dresses immaculately, speaks in a rough, low voice, and kills with cold efficiency.  He's exactly the same kind of persona that you get from a Dashiel Hammet or Mickey Spillane--or for that matter, with just a bit more cooth, an Ian Fleming.

But the loneliness of Ricky's life and the lives of those he encounters is palpable.  Ricky encounters a past and lost love; asks a woman to run away with him to Japan, only to wind up killing her on contract; opens the movie by a car spree with a hooker whom he eventually dumps by the side of the road; and is unable to make contact with his mother or brother because of the strange but palpable sexual tension between them.  Margarethe von Trotta, the future German New Wave director, plays a hotel maid equally lonely, who allows herself to be seduced by Ricky and then kills herself when her lover deserts her.  A gay gypsy criminal whom Ricky kills is the personification of loneliness--a gay man in the underworld, scorned by straights as well as ""respectable"" citizens.  And on it goes.  Everyone in the film is bubbled in solitude and doesn't seem to know quite how to break out.  The only strategy that comes to mind is sex, and it seems relatively joyless--witness the final long scene, in which Ricky's brother, silently howling with misery and loneliness, embraces Ricky's dead body with such passion that for all the world it looks like the two brothers are getting it on.

The film noir ambience and the alienation are both underscored by the stark black and white photography Fassbinder uses in the film.  Fassbinder himself plays a minor role.",1215561600,,2195,4.727034120734908
7971474,5,B00006LPCY,"Once more the merciless eye of Raibner Werner Fassbinder focuses in a German American Vietnam veteran hired for Munich police to murder local criminals .

Imagine a lonely man in a room with thousand mirros. The images are placed next to each other reflecting the ambiguities , the blame and revealing the horror and the hell of the war do not finnish in the battlefield.

A potent film and visceral drama. Do not miss this film of the early times of Fassbinder who literally gave a twist of fate to the Film Noir genre with this original work.",1098057600,,544,4.540816326530612
7971475,5,B00006LPCY,"If you are not wild about Fassbinder's early films, you will still love 'the American Soldier'. The look of the film is taken straight from the great film noir tradition - brilliant use of light and shadows. The plot of the movie, as in Godard, is not of the greatest importance - and you can miss something and still pick up where you left off. One of the most significant features of the film is the ending - which clearly illustrates how Fassbinder liked to unite the themes of sex and death (it is perhaps most pronounced in his final film 'Querelle')",1096329600,,555,4.450980392156863
7971476,5,B00006LPCY,"MESSAGE FOR A PRE-REVIEWER: ON THE COVER IS JAN GEORGE, NOT MARIUS AICHER! THIS FILM IS FOR ME BY FASSBINDER SECOND BEST AFTER ""LOVE IS COLDER THAN DEATH"". I LIKE FASSBINDER AS FRANZ WALSH IN HIS EARLY FILMS. AND I VERY LIKE HIS DARK HUMOUR. BUY IT!",1049068800,,249,4.319148936170213
7971477,4,B00006LPCY,"The American Soldier (1970), Fassbinder's revisionist homage to gangster movies and film noir, is alternately playful and deeply disturbing. The DVD, from Wellspring, is of very good quality; although bizarrely the cover shows Marius Aicher, who co-stars as the leader of the corrupt detectives, NOT Karl Scheydt who plays Ricky, the titular ""American Soldier.""
The film tells the story of Ricky, a professional killer, who returns to his German hometown from America, where he fought for the US in Viet Nam. Three detectives covertly hire Ricky to kill the people behind a crime wave which, humiliatingly, the police have been unable to stop. Although it seemed glacially paced on a first viewing, in subsequent days I found myself thinking about its haunting images many times. At times, it feels almost like a ghost story, with phantoms drifting through a literally shadowy world. Fassbinder and his frequent cinematographer Dietrich Lohmann bring an effectively creepy look to the film, shot on a limited budget in stark, high-contrast black and white.
The American Soldier follows Fassbinder's two earlier thrillers, Love is Colder Than Death (1969; his first picture) and Gods of the Plague (1970), but it is foremost an homage to the American gangster movies which always fascinated him. There are traces of his early passion for Jean-Luc Godard (Breathless, Pierrot le Fou), whose ironic style he adopts in staging the murders, with victims crumpling as if they were children playacting at death. But visually and dramatically, it focuses on the classics of film noir. Ricky brings to mind the amoral, unstoppable antiheroes of Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street (1953) and especially Robert Aldrich's stunning Kiss Me Deadly (1955). Perhaps the most intriguing element is Ricky's and his unnamed brother's (Kurt Raab, who specialized in playing Fassbinder's most offbeat characters) relationship with their enigmatic mother (Eva Ingeborg Scholz). Her half-smiles suggest volumes of dark family mysteries, and recall the twisted oedipal streak in Raoul Walsh's White Heat (1949).
But too often The American Soldier seems to beg for ""footnoting"" - putting it in the context of the many extraordinary films which it quotes or revamps - rather than presenting an immediate experience. Of course, Fassbinder often wants to distance the viewer from his films, forcing us - as do Brecht and Godard - to confront the picture's, and hence our own, social and psychological assumptions. But in this film, Fassbinder's sources and his strikingly original vision do not come together as effectively as in his best work.
The film's climax is an unforgettable exception, but I do not want to spoil its considerable shock value. All I will say is that connecting it with the earlier, sometimes even playful, tone gave the film enormous, and deeply disturbing, emotional resonance. This is one of Fassbinder's most intriguing early works, and it points the way to his even greater films in the years ahead.",1041811200,,3003,5.258333333333334
