8426810,4,B004EEOM9S,These are truly an introduction for beginners into yoga and palates. I really enjoyed learning from these videos until I was comfortable enough to join a class at my local gym.,1333324800,,176,4.709677419354839
8426811,4,B004EEOM9S,"I really enjoy the Pilates the most, being able to customize your workout to fit your daily schedule. It may not be amazing HD but these videos get the point across. I wish the Yoga DVDs included a shorter one like the Pilates, but they are still nice. Makes for a nice alternative for people who don't want to go to the gym for various reasons. None of these videos require equipment, besides a yoga mat, but if you are home you should be fine!",1329955200,,445,4.247058823529412
8426812,5,B004EEOM9S,"i love the set, i still use my phone for the yoga part since it seems to be a bit more of a challenge but i love the pilates i am happy that i was able to do the poses and not die to much afterwards its a great collection",1328400000,,221,3.44
8426813,5,B004EEOM9S,"Love this set of videos.  Each video is very easy to watch and do the exercises.  While being easy to use, they are still quite challenging.",1301184000,,140,4.346153846153846
8426814,5,B004EEOM9S,"What a terrific bundle.  I use it for those days I can't make it to the gym. the instructors are so skilled and I feel like I get a lot of good tips from them. My favorite is the AM & Pm Yoga for beginners, it is like an actual class.  I hope they put out an intermediate bundle as an extra challenge is always a plus.",1299024000,,318,3.7313432835820897
8426815,4,B004EEOM9S,"I like the videos and the routines, I just wish the model was a little chubbier and a lot less flexible.  Then I could relate better and assume a more similar poses.",1297468800,,165,4.15625
