445626,5,6302276063,I am a daycare provider. My daycare kids just love this video. I had this one for my daughter when she was a toddler and she loved it then too. The kids love to sign and dance to the number videos and all my kids can count to 20. This video makes learning fun. There is a part where two cats walk through a doll house. My kids laugh so hard at it.,1071446400,8,347,3.767123287671233
445627,5,6302276063,"My son just turned 3. He recently started watching this video and he really likes it. He already knew how to count to 20 but this made it more interesting. In my opinion, this tape has some cute clips with alot of variation. Different from other counting tapes. The host is Big Bird and the Count. Ernie, Grover, Kermit, The Honkers and other classic Sesame Street people are also included. I have three other counting tapes from Babys First Impressions, Watch N Learn and one other Sesame Street counting tape. This Learning About Numbers is by far my sons favorite. I even enjoy listening to the tunes!",1041638400,4,604,4.654205607476635
445628,3,6302276063,"This is standard Sesame Street, pre-Elmo.  Big Bird is the host of a game show that introduces numbers through clips and songs.  My little one doesn't seem to like thistape, she wanders from the TV whenever it's on but for the child of the '70's this is the tape to have from the king in the castle to the martian girl.",1007510400,9,319,4.213114754098361

Kids can't really get into it. My older ones loved it but now it's so outdated I guess kids now adays want more modern shows.,1445904000,,275,3.8421052631578947

445687,5,6302276063,This is such a great Sesame Street classic. My son loves Elmo but he is not anywhere in this (which I sort of like) and he loves this one. The songs and clips are SO old school and this is the classic stuff from the 80s that made kids geniuses. Buy this video and you will see what I mean. A must have for anyone who has kids and loved Sesame as a kid themselves.,1421971200,,363,3.8533333333333335
445688,4,6302276063,My son with autism LOVES this movie.  He can watch it over and over.  It is adoringly annoying to listen to over and over again.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is the only DVD that I have ever purchased TWICE because it cracked when getting it out of the DVD player.,1421539200,,292,3.9152542372881354

445706,4,6302276063,"I purchased this product for my daughter who just adores Sesame Street after she fell in love with the Sesame Street 1, 2, 3 Count With Me DVD. I assumed that this was a sequel to that program but it is in fact and older program in and of itself. It features a lot of classic Sesame Street skits no longer aired on the modern seasons of the show. After putting this on at my mother-in-law's house, she was thrilled to discover that this was the same collection she used to own on VHS many years ago but was never able to find again once VHS became obsolete. I was initially worried that the ""classics"" wouldn't hold as much appeal to my little one as the new skits do. I was pleasantly proven wrong and she adores this one just as much.",1390867200,,736,4.190140845070423

The best thing about Count is that he cackles after he finishes counting. This has helped us to teach our kid to go from learning numbers to count. Earlier, when we would count something, our son will go all the way to 10, no matter how many things were in front of him. Now, we go like the Count, and start cackling when the counting is done. Pretty soon, our son understood that he has to actually count the things and stop when he reached the end",1271548800,6,597,3.9833333333333334

Unfortunately, they lose 4 stars for forcing us to watch a commercial for the Childrens Television Workshop at the start of the video.  There's no way to skip it, fast-foward or go to Menus...  All commands are blocked until the commercial runs its course.  OK, I'm sure it's a worthy cause, but I purchased the rights to this video, so I should not be forced to watch their ad.

445772,2,6302276063,"Sesame Street has great content, but I am frustrated with the navigation issues (they are the same for many of the Sesame Street DVDs -- read reviews). You are forced to sit through commericals for Sesame Street, you can't fast forward or jump to the main menu. My toddler loses interest while I have to wait until the nav shows up to press the play button. Best to start the DVD and then wander back when you want to see it.

""1 2 3 Count With Me"" a much better choice, for us at least, and possibly for all 2 year olds. Could be ""learning about numbers"" is better tolerated by older children. Only weakness to ""1 2 3 count with me"" is that they give short shrift or even skip over certain numbers between 1-20. Some kind of brainless editing decision by somebody who didn't get enought sleep, no doubt. but our child much preferred it to ""learning about numbers"" Also: ""learning about numbers"" subjects you to a hyperactive commercial for some Sesame Street foundation at the beginning and doesn't let you bypass it!",1202860800,,1298,4.623376623376624
445777,5,6302276063,"I purchased this DVD for my young daughter because it included clips from the Sesame Street of my youth, and I was not disappointed.  Several of the clips included in the video were familiar to me -- and all are a sweet, enjoyable way for small children to learn about counting.  Characters that have largely disappeared from the TV screen come alive once again; if you loved Kermit the Frog or got a kick out of the Honkers, this is a good DVD for you to share with your children!  Elmo's fine, but this is a wonderful window into a larger world of eccentric and loveable characters.",1194652800,,584,4.4392523364485985
445778,5,6302276063,"My 19 month old son LOVES this video, and he has begun counting things with great enthusiasm since we started watching it.  A number of short clips, about two for each number from one to ten, are strung together as part of a mock talk show hosted by Big Bird.  Most of the clips are from the Golden Era of Sesame Street--pre 80s, pre-Elmo-crap--some are edgy, some are clever, all are entertaining to people of both generations.  Highly recommended.",1183248000,2,449,4.658227848101266

445780,5,6302276063,"This is a favorite at our house with my 3 and 5 year old.  They've loved watching it for the past 2 years, their favorite of the Sesame Street Videos.  They adore the Dollhouse clip, and it brings back sweet memories from when I was watching that at 6 years old.  It goes through each of the numbers 1 through 10 with a classic cartoon or live-action clip for each of the numbers.  I'm not crazy about the ""johnny carson show"" part that Big Bird is doing to tie it all together, but that is minimal and the clips are more than worth it, teaching number CONCEPT.  Counting to a number and seeing the numeral.  Make sure you get this one.  30 minute video.

I own the combination videotape Learning About Numbers/ Learning to Add and Subtract.  The second one teaches to add and subtract, a good overview and really good teaching in the live action spots with Big Bird and Maria (though Bird is a bit whiney).  The clips aren't as memorable.  Might as well get the combination if you can.  But the Add/Subtract one gets 4 stars rather than 5.  Also 30 minute video.",1174348800,,1063,4.362244897959184

So perhaps this was my mistake. Gets a bit tedious. My 2 year old got bored with it, because he also expected it to cover other numbers.",1170892800,4,308,4.15

That is, if the adult is old enough to have seen the Johnny Carson Show.  I am, so I found it highly entertaining.  Nathan (18 mo) found the skit about the dollhouse amusing, and liked the sitar music in the 1-10 skit, roller coaster and dancing chickens, etc.  I like them, too, and the animation and music are great in every skit.  Sesame Street Workshop produces some very creative work, and we need more like it.",1155945600,,540,4.525773195876289
445803,4,6302276063,"My daughter loves the DVD, although the lower numbers are definitely a bit boring--for both of us! Unlike one of the other Sesame Street DVDs we have, this one forces you to watch a minute-long spiel on how the money used to buy the DVD goes to support children's programming all over the world. I can't get my computer to skip over it. Which brings me to the next point: WHY is there a regional code on this and other Sesame Street DVDs? I'm in Germany, and I have to watch these on my computer instead of TV because some schmo at Sony thought the DVD should only be viewable in North America? How does Sony or anyone else benefit from this? There are millions of Americans living abroad who want their children to see these, and the regional coding just results in fewer people buying the product. Sigh...

We especially like the one where the ball goes through the ""roller coaster"" track, and the skits with the Count. Very funny, simple, and wholesome entertainment.
