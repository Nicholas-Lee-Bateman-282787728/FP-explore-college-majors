3506438,5,B001C71IEM,"I watched the movie, and even the sidebar footage about her process and work ethic, etc. I think the most important learned lesson is to ""edit."" That comes from many years of experience, and being open to criticism.",1233878400,,215,4.684210526315789

3506442,5,B001C71IEM,"As a photographer and fan of Annie Leibovitz I was excited to find this documentary.  It was just as I'd hoped.  It included most of her most popular and famous images, and gave insight into her process and the road she has taken in her career.  It's an interesting companion to her latest book.  I watched the documentary, then received her book and felt almost like in the book she gets a little bit of revenge for the candid discussions given by her colleagues and subjects in this documentary!

It's well edited and a great treat for any Leibovitz fan.",1230249600,20,556,4.52
3506443,5,B001C71IEM,"Annie Leibovitz's sister has created a memorable documentary honoring the life's work of her older sister.  We learn about Ms. Leibovitz's early beginings in photography when she started her career at the ""Rolling Stones"" magazine.  Her evolution from rock and roll photographer to a photographer of portraits and later on fashion (when she moved to ""Vanity Fair"" magazine).  Documentary is also an honest look and her personal life: her relationship with Susan Sontag, her parents and siblings, her three daughters.  For anyone interested in photography as a visual form of art this movie is a real treasure.",1228089600,30,609,5.247422680412371

3506448,4,B001C71IEM,"This engagingly produced documentary concentrates on the various phases of photographer Annie Leibowitz's career, from her beginnings in the San Francisco protest movement in the late 1960s, to her long association with ROLLING STONE magazine, her subsequent move to VANITY FAIR and her work with VOGUE.  We see her at work on photo-shoots in Paris and the United States, with subjects including actress Kirsten Dunst in MARIE ANTOINETTE.  The program - originally produced on HBO - has a strong cast of celebrity interviewees including Whoopi Goldberg, Hillary Roddam Clinton, Tina Brown, and Yoko Ono.  The overall impression, however, is a mixed one: while Leibowitz is an undoubtedly talented artist, with a unique ability to capture images on film, it seems that she has become more concerned with photographing celebrities, rather than recording life around her.  It seems that contemporary cultures are more preoccupied with worlds of surface that obfuscate rather than explore the truth.  This is a shame, as Leibowitz's early career, as well as her subsequent work in the Bosnian civil war of the 1990s, reveal her to be a talented historian as well as a war photographer.",1367280000,,1181,5.227513227513228

As history passes, this doco will remain a comprehensive video monument of epoch recent (application of photography in history-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Civil-War/dp/B000BITUE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Civil War</a>, for instance).",1266537600,,378,8.692307692307692
3506460,5,B001C71IEM,This film is a brief show into the world of Annie Leibovitz.  It is an interesting glimpse into the life that Annie has lived and the career she has established.  I believe Annie is the current greatest American photographer.  And her style is absolutely inspiring to anyone who is even slightly intrigued by photography.  This film would be excellent for any class or personal use.,1243728000,,382,4.8307692307692305
3506461,5,B001C71IEM,"If you think Ansel Adams was or is the only famous photographer, think again.  I honestly had never heard of Annie Leibovitz before buying this DVD.  However, I am taking expensive night classes to become a professional photographer and have become very open minded to learning about photographers I had not known before.  This video of Annie's life opened my mind like nothing had before to what fantastic possibilities photography offers one working in this profession.  I found this DVD to be a first-rate, high-energy production that kept me on the edge of my chair the whole time.  Part of me never wanted it to end.  At the end, however, you are left with a keen awareness of the power photography offers as an art form and communication tool.  I almost never write a review on any DVD or book, though this is different.  If you want to experience a brief taste of what it means to be a photographic master, do not hesitate to pick up and watch this DVD.  In conclusion, after seeing this DVD, my hope is that one day Annie would be inspired to develop training DVDs or to actually teach several week-long seminars on location each year so that photographers aspiring to greatness could have the privilege and opportunity to learn directly from the master.",1243123200,7,1262,4.7
3506462,5,B001C71IEM,"Annie has gone from being a fly on the wallpaper to being a Super Star on the Flying Trapeze in a Three Ring Circus. She's began as a photographer in the manner of Robert Frank and Henri Carier Bresson and then moved into the ""Vanity Fair"" and ""Vogue"" World of NYC photography with the huge in-town studio and country converted water mill home in Conn. She went from the seeming invisible maker of candid photographs to Cecil B. DeMille Hollywood productions. She was soon working with dozens of assistants, set builders, art directors, grips, teamsters, hairdressers, cranes, helicopters, the Nittany Lions Marching Band, etc., etc. She managed to maintain her ability to make good pictures despite this complete change in work style and still enjoys capturing images as a loner as well as the Glitzy Celebrity Portrait Shoots. For a woman who more of less stumbled accidentally into the world of  photography and popular music she has certainly found her secret talent.
 This DVD is a very well done portrait of Annie Leibovitz and her life in photography. It includes pictures and home movies of her early life as one of six children of an Air Force Officer. While their father was fighting in the Vietnam War, the six kids were marching and protesting against that same war. This is the tale of a 1960's war protestor gone mainstream. In many ways, it's the story of the entire baby boom generation. It's wonderful to see a success story that is the result of talent, hard work and totally without inside contacts. Annie went to work for ""Rolling Stone"" as the magazine was being born and then grew up with it.  Annie is one-of-a-kind, but that fact hasn't gone to her head.",1237075200,7,1678,4.759450171821306
3506463,5,B001C71IEM,"As an educator and filmmaker I enjoyed this inspiring, revealing, and beautiful portrayal of photography, and what it means to the world, through the eyes of one of the greatest female photographers of the late twentieth century.
