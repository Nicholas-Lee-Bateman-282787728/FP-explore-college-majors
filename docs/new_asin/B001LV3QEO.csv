I'm only giving this two stars because the overall presentation, production and delivery of the product was poor. This isn't a review about Dr. Weng and his knowledge of Shuai-Chiao.
1. Production: Luckily for me I studied Shuai-Chiao in college and I am already familiar enough with the throws to grasp what is being shown.
That aside, the audio quality if horrible. The sound is low, and it echos badly. You can barely understand what is being said, and I suspect this DVD is a straight copy from a previous VHS offering as there are no real menu or subtitle options available. So, if you're hard of hearing as I am, you're out of luck.
2. Presentation. Here my critique is of the packaging and not the production quality. The packaging is cheap, and because of the cheapness of the cases the spindle in the center of the case broke during shipping, allowing the dvd to slide everywhere. Because of this , the dvd is scratched and pretty badly. Luckily my computer and bluray player can read it. Others may not be so lucky. This segues perfectly into the  next point.
3. Packaging: The packaging was awful. Both cases on both dvd's had cracked cases, broken spindles AND BOTH DVD'S WERE SCRATCHED! I get having a mishap with one, but when both have the same problem, then it comes down to carelessness. Unless you're a collector and you're interested in helping to preserve this little known martial art, then don't buy this. If you're looking for instruction , look to a different dvd.

TLDR: Broken cases, scratched discs and poor audio quality make this dvd series sorely lacking , and the distributor needs to clean up its act if it keeps shipping damaged goods.",1498003200,,1888,5.14657980456026
