8664860,4,B00LAHOR4W,"The mob takes over the night clubs in town, and the hostesses are enslaved in a system they cant escape. The mob boss has those who don't cooperate killed, and others fear talking to authorities. Bette Davis plays dramatic roles so well, and, although its not one of her best roles, shes  captivating. Bogart is solid as the DA. This is an engrossing film throughout and well worth watching.",1498953600,,391,4.666666666666667

This is a story about women of the night who provide companionship and entertainment in a service industry. It was ripped from the headlines after a NY city mob boss was convicted with his gang. Mr. John Vanning opened a nightclub, a cover for gambling and prostitution. It caters to out-of-towners who want a good time (and will pay for it). A clip joint is one description. Their hostesses work on patrons and encourage them to drink and gamble (B-girls). [Are the men getting authentic brands? Is the gambling fixed?] One patron is warned about welshing on a debt. Will he check out? Mary Dwight gave Ralph Crawford her address to repay her loan, it was found on the body. The police detectives question her.

Can the law get these criminals? Not when they can buy politicians and shyster lawyers who take advantage of every technicality in the law and buy or coach perjured testimony from witnesses. But Graham will prosecute the case anyway. Mary is questioned; will she cooperate? Yes! But those defendants were in jail at the time! The verdict is not guilty. Was the fix in? Marys sister, Betty Strauber, gets involved. She falls and is later found in the river. This is followed by an indictment for murder. There is a dramatic trial. Mary Dwight testifies and shows a scar! The jury says guilty on all counts. The judge says 30 to 50 years. Well, thats that.

After John Vanning went to jail he was replaced by others who continues the rackets. Crime is like disease, it continues forever, fluctuating like the tides. There was no mention of the causes. Does poverty cause crime, like an unhealthy environment causes disease? Is there a cure?",1423699200,,1692,4.728813559322034
