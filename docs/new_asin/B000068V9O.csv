1727044,5,B000068V9O,I love the Angelina Ballerina video series.  They are very inspirational to young dancers.,1247529600,,90,5.428571428571429
1727045,5,B000068V9O,"My 4-year-old is just beginning to get interested in ballet and dance and the Angelina Ballerina stories and DVDs provide loads of inspiration whilst serving to entertain at the same time.

There are 4 episodes altogether [12 mins each] - ""Ballerina Rag Doll,"" ""Angelina's Surprise,"" ""Arthur The Butterfly"" and ""Alice's Present."" Also included are two live-action segments: ""Helping Younger Children to Dance"" and ""Dancing in Character.""

The animated stories remain faithful to the source material by Katharine Holabird, and retain the original illustrations by Helen Craig. The quality of the animation is above average, lending an almost real-life quality to the little mice, and the language is clear [British accent is used here]. In between the animated episodes, there are scenes of actual dance lessons, either ballet, folk or others.

I'd highly recommend the Angelina Ballerina series of DVDs to aspiring young dancers, those who love immersing themselves in a world inhabited by adorable little mice and this is probably suited to preschoolers and up.",1240790400,,1062,5.424242424242424
1727046,5,B000068V9O,"Another hit from Angelina Ballerina and her friends (and all-important dance teacher).  My 3 1/2 year old granddaughter loves Angelina Ballerina and watches the movie many, many times.",1223769600,,184,5.571428571428571
1727047,5,B000068V9O,Gave this to my granddaughters for Christmas and they enjoy it while playing with their Angelina Ballerina Dolls. Thanks!,1171929600,,121,5.421052631578948
1727048,5,B000068V9O,"Such great life lessons in this DVD...I bought it for my daughter so she's have some girlie DVDs, and my 4 year old son loves it too!",1127174400,,133,3.962962962962963
1727049,5,B000068V9O,"Four stories from the PBS television series.  In each tale Angelina faces difficult challenges.  The stories are:
Ballerina Rag Doll - Angelina faces maturity as she gives up her baby things to help others.  But Angelina might not be ready to part with them all.  Or is she?
Angelina's Surprise - Angelina is jealous of the attention being given the Twins and their new sibling.  Angelina tells a lie that snowballs out of control until she admits her mistake.
Arthur the Butterfly - Angelina finds a beautiful injured butterfly while on a picnic.  Angelina has a hard time letting it go once it is healed but learns her lesson when she becomes trapped.
Alice's Present - Alice gives Angelina a new gym bag that through a mix-up winds up donated to charity.  Alice thinks Angelina did not like the gift and a friendship might come to an end.
We love the stories, the music and the voice characterizations.  A fun video for young girls, and some boys, with lessons for everyone.",1058313600,18,977,4.6725146198830405
1727050,3,B000068V9O,...lack of a menu.  There is no way to choose specific episodes-you just have to skip through the chapters and even those do not break at obvious places.  My daughter likes to watch DVDs with the captions on (she learned to read at four so I guess that helped) and that option is not available.  Might as well buy the video instead--it's a bit cheaper and at least you can look at the counter to determine where the episodes are.,1046736000,16,429,4.3375
1727051,3,B000068V9O,"While my daughter enjoys watching the episodes, it is frustrating when she wants to see the live action segments at the end.  There is no menu in order to skip over the cartoon episodes and go straight to the live action.
Basically, we have to skip each chapter until we get to the last chapter in an episode (the DVD won't let you skip the last chapter), wait for the episode to end, and then do the same process for each of the remaining episodes until you reach the live action.
It seems like the makers of the DVD just recorded the VHS version onto disc and left it at that.",1043625600,9,578,4.207207207207207
1727102,5,B000068V9O,"Granddaughters watch this movie over and over, they just can't get enough of it. Good storyline and good entertainment. This is one of the fine movies on Prime.",1376006400,,160,4.75
1727103,5,B000068V9O,Daughter loves it.  Got it way sooner than expected.  Really cute stories.  If you have a ballerina lover they will love it.,1375315200,,124,4.545454545454546
1727104,5,B000068V9O,Love the old Angelina. This DVD has real ballerinas practicing in between cartoons with Angelina narrating. Very cute. DVD was in great shape when arrived and I would recommend this product and seller.,1372118400,,201,5.121212121212121
1727105,5,B000068V9O,When my daughter's favorite show was discontinued we both went into withdrawals.  Thanks so much for making these DVD series!  We're happy once again--both of us!,1371254400,,162,5.1923076923076925
1727106,5,B000068V9O,"Personally, I like the original Angelina Ballerina series better than the new. Many are based on the books. Love the fact that Dame Judi Dench is the voice of Miss Lily!",1369526400,,169,4.483870967741935
1727107,4,B000068V9O,Great to show little ones character and the importance of being truthful. Appropriate for young girls now magic but the truth,1359417600,,125,5.0
1727108,2,B000068V9O,As they had experienced problems with the two other dvd's that i had purchased my daughter-in-law decided to return this dvd unopened.,1357776000,,134,5.136363636363637
1727109,5,B000068V9O,"if you have an aspired little ballerina, this is a great movie.
my little preschooler would sit and watch all the episodes and ask to watch them again right afterwards.  she never gets tired of watching them!  I think the stories teach good and wholesome lessons to children, and feel comfortable letting my little one watch it.

Angelina's surprise teaches kids not to lie
Arthur the butterfly teaches kids to treat others as how we want to be treated (one of the moral of the story)
Alice's present teaches kids about friendship and how to be a good friend.

i will be getting more of the Angelina Ballerina videos.  I think it's a great set to have.

Revision, 1/12/13
i found 1 adverse effect of the video.  my little girl started to talk like a mouse in an annoying squeaky voice.  i had to correct her and tell her that angelina talks that way because she is a mouse, and a princess should not talk like a mouse.  :/",1355788800,,922,4.408284023668639
1727110,4,B000068V9O,Great story for little girls. I bought this as a Christmas gift and my cousin loves this book.  I think I'll buy more for her.  Great price.,1333065600,,140,4.148148148148148

7964799,5,B000068V9O,"The stories that children watch in Angelina Ballerina DVDs are not the usual silly, meaningless kind available to them.  My granddaughter, who is almost 5 years old, loves Angelina Ballerina stories.  They're soft and gentle, and the stories that we have watched  have a purpose and a specific theme.  Relationships amongst friends and family members are somewhat realistic and often serve as a lesson to the young viewers. In addition, the children may develop a positive attitude towards ballet and possibly a desire to include the art of dance as a part of their  lives.",1422835200,,573,4.989473684210527
