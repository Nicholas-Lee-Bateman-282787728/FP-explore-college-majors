8659023,1,B00KHLB7WC,"I was very disappointed with this product. I had looked when I ordered, and when it came in to see how many actual episodes were included on the DVD, and nowhere did it tell me. Turns out, there are only 4 (half hour) episodes on the entire disc. This show ran for 17 years, and for $15, they can only include 4? Thought it was a big rip off.",1521158400,,342,3.971014492753623
8659024,5,B00KHLB7WC,"Very nostalgic. ""What's My Line?"" was TV's most famous panel show. Always fun to watch. Full of surprises to hold a viewer's interest. And since human nature is still the same, I'll bet an up-to-date version of this show would be a smash hit.  But hell, I still enjoy watching the original Dick Tracy serials, so my critical judgment is highly suspect.",1517529600,3,352,4.67741935483871

8659026,3,B00KHLB7WC,"It was nice to see some of the faces from my childhood.  I was a huge Kilgallen fan.  She almost always guessed first and it was nice to see a woman in the 50s who didn't have to pretend she was dumb to please insecure men, as the heroines on shows like I Love Lucy and My Little Margie did,  but truthfully the show just doesn't hold up.  The shows on this DVD are heavily sports related, so if you are a fan of 50s and 60s sports stars, it may be more meaningful to you.  All that I found interesting was how old they looked--in their 40s and even pushing 50.  They would all be retired today.  The sexism of the show--from the joking about the female panelists  to  the idea that a woman holding what was seen as a man's job should be impossible to guess made me wince.  There are so many wonderful blasts from the past, from the Twilight Zone to Andy Griffith, that remain as wonderful as they seemed when I was a child, that I won't be buying any further installments of this. I give it three stars because it was nice to see Kilgallen again.",1499040000,,1047,4.138613861386139
8659027,5,B00KHLB7WC,What a classy game show this was - John Daly has to be the most intelligent 'Panel Moderator' in the history of all game shows. This is like a vision into our past - see how life was in the 1950's... simply amazing... love it.,1485734400,4,226,4.044444444444444

8659031,5,B00KHLB7WC,"This is an entertaining collection for anyone who can remember What's My Line. The panel as well as the host, John Daly, come across as witty and fun. The mystery guests come from all walks of life, from baseball players to garbage barge captains.",1411430400,9,247,4.636363636363637
