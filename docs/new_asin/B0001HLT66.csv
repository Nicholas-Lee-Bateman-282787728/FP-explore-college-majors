8012718,1,B0001HLT66,"Unprofessional collage of news images on November 22, 1963; amateurish in production. There is no DVD cover or indication of contents; it's like a copy a friend might have made without authorization. IMHO the only thing to be said in favour of this product is that it represents one news network's coverage of the events as they happened, but I found it a waste of money.",1454198400,,371,4.636363636363637

8012720,3,B0001HLT66,"Regarding "" The Kennedy Assassination PART 1 (November 22, 1963) it may be that the DVD was dubbed from a kinescope. Approximately 20 minutes into the second hour of the DVD, there was a noticeable jump in the video. After that the sound was out of sync with the picture.

8012721,5,B0001HLT66,"This afternoon I watched my home-recorded 6 hour VHS of A&E's 25th anniversary special, JFK ASSASSINATION: AS IT HAPPENED and was curious if there were any official releases of this NBC-TV broadcast. Whether this one's a bootleg, I can't speculate.

Some time around 2 pm EST, the network broke into regular programming with a bulletin that shots had been fired in Dallas. Eleven minutes later, someone started rolling tape. As we see, Bill Ryan, at screen right, acted as unofficial anchor of the afternoon's impromptu coverage. He, Chet Huntley and Frank McGee were possibly set up in a wood panelled conference room. The first hour of coverage was utter chaos. Remotes from Dallas failed, as did the audio system tapped into a phone line. McGee had to repeat the words of an unheard Bob McNeill, who was on-the-spot at Parkland Memorial, while technicians worked on getting an audio patch.

Huntley handed him a primitive listening device at one point. Frank fumbled with it, got it on the earpiece of the phone, but then leaned in too close to a desk mike, which caused a squealing feedback that drowned out McNeill. He went back to repeating the reporter's phrases. Later when phone audio was working, Frank continued to parrot McNeill, changing an occasional word. At this time, Huntley, who sat between McGee and Ryan, departed, and coverage became two-man.

Bill Ryan remained as optimistic as possible in the face of ever more dire reports. Calls for a priest didn't mean death is imminent, he said, and one for a neurosurgeon could simply indicate a spinal cord injury. This positive pretense was dropped with a first unconfirmed report from two priests that JFK was dead. Official word soon followed.

Throughout this initial hour, inaccuracy reigned supreme. One woman said that Kennedy was looking at a dog in the car when he was first struck. Reports that the wounded president arrived at Parkland both conscious and unconscious were aired. The guman was on the second floor, or the fourth floor. A rifle found in a sniper's nest at the Texas School Book Depository was English, then German. And so on.

For conspiracy theorists, some comments are vital to their case. JFK was struck in the back and the right temple, McGee reported. In a later phone conversation with McNeill he tried making sense of this. Perhaps the gunman's first shot was from the front, was Frank's postulation. The grisly Zapruder film (not available that day) bears out the report of a temple hit: before JFK is thrown back and to the left, his brain balloons out the rear of his head and flops around the side.

Most accurate of all, and most disconcerting in hindsight, is the almost immediate setting up of Lee Oswald as a lone killer. By hour two, much was known about this 24-year-old ""radical"" who at that time had only been charged with the murder of a Dallas cop. He worked at the warehouse in question, had tried defecting to Russia, lived there a while, was married to a Russian girl. Clearly this was prelude to the assassination charges against Oswald that came before day's end.

Except for the insanity of hour one, NBC's coverage of this tragedy was thorough and far-reaching. Comments from David Brinkley, Irving R. Levine and other correspondents, a remote from the U.N., witness tapes and films-- all were aired unedited. It was history as it unfolded, in its purest sense.

.
I was in grammar school in Nov. '63 and was spared the first hours of NBC's coverage by a protective mother. But when my dad got home later that afternoon, he tuned in to see the bronze casket's arrival in D.C. I watched from the background, saw Jackie's blood-stained suit. This scene is also part of my SLP tape, but is certainly not on volume one of this two DVD set.",1339804800,6,3754,4.782407407407407
8012722,1,B0001HLT66,"I can't vouch for the quality of the actual DVD, because I received a blank disc.  (I sent it back for a refund.)  However, based on the packaging - or lack of it - I would be inclined to agree with David A. Medzorian's assessment that this is an unauthorized bootleg.  There was no cover insert - just a clear plastic jewel box in which the disc was placed - and the label looked like a ""print-at-home"" job.  If this is a ""print-on-demand"" DVD, that wasn't disclosed in the product description.  For $19.95, I expected a professional package, and (blank DVD notwithstanding) I didn't get one.

If the packaging is this skimpy, it's reasonable for me to believe Mr. Medzorian's comments on the picture quality are accurate.  This is not worth your time - or your money.",1303862400,5,769,4.569343065693431
8012723,2,B0001HLT66,"The NBC coverage offered in these videos is fascinating to watch as it shows a tragic, unfolding event as it was covered live in 1963. NBC's coverage was in black and white, except for brief segments early on from WBAP-TV in Fort Worth. The only problem with the videos is the actual video quality...which is lousy. THIS VIDEO IS NOT AN OFFICIAL NBC RELEASE. THE MATERIAL DID NOT ORIGINATE DIRECTLY FROM THE NBC NEWS ARCHIVES. IT IS A BOOTLEG. NBC only released one such video of its JFK coverage, a capsulized version back in 1988 which contains almost none of the coverage seen in this collection. This material is of marginal quality at best...and looks like it ewas copied about eight times before being released in this version. If you're not concerned about this, then you will find it very interesting to watch.",1253664000,10,818,4.7272727272727275

Kennedy was assassinated in downtown Dallas, Texas, while riding in his open-top limousine through Dealey Plaza.

This footage includes the dramatic and sad moment when President Kennedy is pronounced dead by NBC newsman Frank McGee (as he gets the official word while talking on the phone to fellow correspondent Robert MacNeil, who was riding in the Dallas motorcade when the shooting occurred).

Presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, 45 minutes after killing JFK from his 6th-floor perch in the Book Depository, shot and killed a Dallas city police officer (J.D. Tippit) in the Oak Cliff section of the city, and was captured shortly thereafter while attempting to hide in the darkened Texas Theater, a short distance from the Tippit murder scene. Tippit's murder and Oswald's arrest are also covered on this two-hour DVD.

Johnson's first address to the nation from Andrews Air Force Base.

This type of ""live"" coverage of a major news event is always very interesting to watch years and decades later. The capacity of NBC's facilities (and personnel) was stretched to their limits during the four days of virtually non-stop TV news coverage that occurred between approx. 1:40 PM (Eastern Time) on November 22nd and the conclusion of JFK's funeral on Monday, November 25th.

The JFK assassination is considered by many as a turning point in the world of TV news reporting. A story this huge had never been covered before during the TV era. And when looking back on the original footage by all three major television networks (NBC, CBS, and ABC), there are a number of ""what do we do next?"" moments shown live to everyone in America. But, under the stressful circumstances, I think this was to be expected. In my opinion, the TV networks did an outstanding job of covering the sorrowful events of that November weekend in 1963.

I think it's also very interesting to note (while viewing the many hours of TV footage that exist from those four days in November) that virtually ALL of the information being reported by all the TV networks favored a ""Lone Assassin"" scenario, with very, very little evidence and info to support any type of a ""conspiracy"" whatsoever. This fact, IMO, is quite telling.

Because, in my view, IF a vast conspiracy and subsequent ""cover-up"" had been in place on November 22, 1963, I believe (given the immense amount of TV coverage, with reporters scrutinizing everything coming across their news desks during those initial hours and days after JFK was killed) at least some pieces of the conspiracy would have leaked through to the sweeping television coverage of the event.

To think (as many theorists do) that these conspirators were so smart and quick to immediately eliminate virtually every last scrap of info leading to a ""plot"" of some kind, making sure none of the multi-shooter plan seeped through to the media, is to think (IMO) that any such evil-doers were akin to ""Superman""!

For example -- Virtually all initial reports concerning the exact number of rifle shots heard by witnesses in Dealey Plaza stated ""3 shots"". And while it's true that the very first report of the shooting from UPI's Merriman Smith (which was broadcast over all the TV networks) stated ""Three shots were fired..."", it's also worth noting that Smith's initial bulletin was NOT the only ""three-shots"" account that was reported during those early hours just after the shooting. For instance, Jay Watson of ABC affiliate WFAA-TV in Dallas (who happened to be in Dealey Plaza during the shooting and nervously reported the first bulletins to the unaware Dallas TV audience) is heard multiple times on November 22 saying he heard ""3 shots"" fired. Plus, other members of the media are also on film relaying their own personal beliefs that exactly three shots were fired by the assassin.

Could these ultra-clever conspirators have somehow managed to ""manipulate"" several reporters who were relaying the news live to the world immediately after the event, and have them ALL report on hearing just ""three shots""? Or were the conspiratorial shooters so good that they made 4 or 5 shots sound like only three? Highly doubtful, IMO.

The ""synchronized"" shooting scenario is possible, I suppose. But I just don't buy into those theories claiming various conspiracy scenarios, some theories incorporating a ludicrously-enormous number of rifle shots being fired at the President (up to a dozen shots, per some of the crazier shooting scenarios), which is just utter nonsense, given the known and available evidence.

The bulletins and almost all subsequent reports from November 22 to 24, 1963, supported precisely three shots being fired...all from ONE gun...and all being fired from ONE place (the consensus after a little initial confusion being the Book Depository Building which housed Lee Harvey Oswald and his rifle at 12:30 PM on November 22nd).

And there were certainly no other suspects or co-conspirators connected with Oswald in either murder, including J.D. Tippit's.

I challenge anyone to watch (or listen to) some of the as-it's-happening news coverage from November 1963 and try to reconcile that news coverage with anything closely resembling Oliver Stone's and Jim Garrison's crazily out-of-whack ""6-Shot, 3-Gunmen"" theory that is portrayed on the theater screen in Stone's 1991 film ""JFK"".

You can't do it....because there's NOTHING close to that kind of multi-shooter nonsense to be found within ANY of the networks' news reports concerning the death of President Kennedy.

The history-making date of 11/22/63 will be remembered forever as the tragic day when John F. Kennedy's life was ended so violently. This DVD brings back that day in vivid detail, as told by the NBC newsmen who reported the solemn events to a grieving nation.

8012725,5,B0001HLT66,"In 1993, the A&E network ran the first six hours without interruption of NBC's reference videotape of their November 23rd, 1963 coverage of the assassination of John Kennedy.

Chaos reigns as the first hour or so unfolds. Technical glitches, conflicting reports and the adrenaline of an horrific moment seem to drive newsmen Bill Ryan and Frank Gifford. (BTW-- BILL Ryan is NOT the writer JIM Ryan, as incorrectly identified here.) Chet Huntley was in a separate location, and more calm in appearance.

When the official announcement of the President's death is made, both McGee and Ryan grow pensive but remain in control. Their reportage, considering the circumstances is superlative.

Some unintentional humor occurs when McGee fumbles with a unit designed to pick up the voice of the man he's speaking with on the phone. He abandons the balky gadget and repeats what his unheard associate is saying. Later, McGee does the same thing, even though we can now hear both ends of the call and he actually ""rewrites"" what the other man is saying until a persistent Ryan interrupts to tell him that repeating is no longer necessary.

This two hour excerpt doesn't include footage of Jackie deplaning in D.C. and perhaps that's a good thing-- for her skirt is clearly covered in gore as she dazedly walks down the airplane staircase. It was an ultimate moment of television ""prying"" and an awkward end to the first day of one of the worst events in American history.",1233360000,,1462,4.906882591093117

This VHS videotape begins with NBC's ""Live"" TV coverage at approximately 12:50 PM (Dallas time), or 20 minutes after President Kennedy was shot from the Texas School Book Depository Building on Elm Street. The tape starts at the exact point when NBC began ""rolling tape"". The network had been on the air live for several minutes prior to when this video begins, but technicians hadn't begun recording the footage until quite a few minutes later.
