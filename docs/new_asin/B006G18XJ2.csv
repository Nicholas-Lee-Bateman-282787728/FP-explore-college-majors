8497280,5,B006G18XJ2,Great dvd for indoor training. Definitely more interesting indoor training with the other riders shown in the event.,1520035200,,116,5.5

8497282,5,B006G18XJ2,"One of my favorite videos by Cycling Videos Online. It's a killer workout but don't let it scare you! You can dial it back if you need to. Excellent dashboard helps you to train with vision if you're into measuring heart rate, RPM's etc. Even if you're not, parts of the dashboard will show you how high to set resistance and give you an idea of what's coming up next in the video. I've pushed my fitness level way up with these videos that are filmed as if you are ""Behind the Bars"" of the videographer. Good narrative keeps your mind occupied, but you can also select from 3 different audio tracks in case you get sick of hearing narrative after doing this ride many times. Not for whiners.",1410825600,,692,4.372093023255814
8497283,5,B006G18XJ2,This is my first purchase of a workout video from CyclingVideosOnline.  The quality was just fantastic and all the stats on the screen keeps us tech guys right up to pace with the riders who are out in the Utah.  We had some friends get together on Saturdays when the snow did not allow us to ride outdoors.  It was a great ride and provided a great workout for the off season.,1352764800,,377,4.208333333333333
8497284,5,B006G18XJ2,"Another awesome Paul Gallas virtual cycling video!!!!
Once again beautiful scenary and challenging ride. I don't dare actually attempt to survive the real Moab Utah because hills and I just don't get along. At least with these videos I can enjoy the scenary and work on my relationship with hills. This one is great because I love the red rocks of Utah and, by the time I am done with the ride, I have done my TKO workout (Total Knockout Workout). That is truely the qualities that makes a good video to me. Besides that I also like how Paul suggests a resistant level, heart rate, and shows the elevation among other things.
In my opinion, you can't go wrong with these videos if scenary and challenge is qualities that you also look for!",1351123200,,739,4.522388059701493
8497285,5,B006G18XJ2,"This ride is incredible. First of all, its in Moab, which is picturesque. The scenery is spectacular, but the ride itself has everything. Climbs, rollers, sprints. Another perfect way to spend some time on a stationary bike. Couldn't ask for anything better.",1347408000,,258,5.166666666666667
