7982371,5,B00008EYA0,"Ride the wave of excitement as Billy Ocean performs live at the Hammersmith Odeon in his hometown of London, singing many of his greatest hits from both his double platinum ""Suddenly"" and ""Love Zone.""

This live concert runs about 55 minutes. The VHS has very good audio and video quality. Billy Ocean is in his prime and both his singing and dancing on stage are outstanding. Billy Ocean is one of the top ten male vocalists of the 80's and definitely the king of love songs. He won the Grammy Award 1985 for Best Male R&B performance for ""Caribbean Queen.""
