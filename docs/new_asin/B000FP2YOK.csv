2581679,3,B000FP2YOK,"Because there was nothing written about this movie, I thought is was about Lizzie Border but it's not. Also very gory.

Not what I thought I was buying & not really pleased with it.

It takes place in California. And is stupid.",1157673600,19,227,4.380952380952381

8125334,3,B000FP2YOK,"B-Horror, folks...take it or leave it. Lizzie possesses college girl and stupid friends die because they're stupid and Lizzie has an axe to grind. Nothing new here but I watched both this one and its sequel the same night; quirky ideas, pretty people and little money shot on digital camera gets you a ticket to the B's and I had a good time with both films. Randal Malone's role in the first one is too weak, but don't smoke in the house. Malone's ghost role in the sequel is more nightmarish. The house where both movies were shot appears in at least ten movies featuring Randal Malone. Neither film is great and neither will win an Oscar for best film but then neither did a Star Wars movie.",1349481600,,694,4.4296875
8125335,2,B000FP2YOK,The Lizzie Borden story has always been interesting to me. Been to the Lizzie Borden house. read books about her. And I have to say the best movie about Lizzie Borden was the one played by Elizabeth Montgomery.,1339113600,3,210,4.552631578947368
8125336,2,B000FP2YOK,This was not what I expected.  I apparently ordered the wrong thing.  This movie was a low budget movie.  Good thing I didn't spend a lot of money.,1287187200,5,147,4.178571428571429
8125337,1,B000FP2YOK,"Beware! This is listed under Elizabeth Montgomery movies on Amazon, but it is NOT the made-for-TV movie she starred in!

It is actually quite possibly the WORST movie ever released on DVD. Script, acting, special effects, you name it, it was awful.

PLEASE don't waste your money!

It is not one star -it is negative stars...",1274745600,16,325,4.767857142857143
8125338,1,B000FP2YOK,"I thought I was getting a movie about Lizzie Borden.  The girl on it even looks a bit like Elizabeth Montgomery.

This is some cheesy horror movie that I threw away.  I wish it could be saved as starless.  It doesn't deserve one.",1184198400,30,229,4.255813953488372
8125339,1,B000FP2YOK,"I bought the DVD, understanding it wasn't a documentary, or even a story really related to the actual Lizzie Borden murder mystery, etc. I did expect however, some kind of a decent film, with good acting, a storyline, plot, all those kinds of things that go into a good tale. None of those things will be found in here. The acting is atrocious, the storyline?? ..there isn't one. The special effects are pathetic, and asinine. The whole mess is just a disgrace. I cannot believe I spent money to buy this. Im ashamed. This is one of the worst pieces of drivel, trash I even say, that I have ever been unfortunate enough to watch. Its not even bad enough to call camp, B flick, cheeseball, or any other kind of film that maybe everyone might not like. This is THAT BAD!!!  don't even waste your money renting it. You would be sorry if you did.",1175731200,50,842,4.397435897435898
8125340,1,B000FP2YOK,"Being a Christian, I will try and contol myself here.  No one did their homework on this piece of junk.  Actual documented details of the real case are either left out or contradictory in this 'movie'.  At first I was going to just file the DVD away with the annotation that the DVD was a piece of cheesy junk, but then decided it was not even worth including in my Lizzie Borden 'library'- it is even worse than the Elizabeth Montgomery Lizzie Borden movie.  People who know the documents facts will cringe at this piece of junk.  I ended up throwing the DVD in the trash after painfully watching the first 25 minutes.  Besides the stupid premise of the movie (the Lizze had returned) the worst parts were the murder scenes themselves- Andrew and Abby kept screaming hit after hit after hit- you get the point.  Don't waste your time.  Amazon forces me to give this piece of junk one star.",1170633600,14,890,4.484472049689441
8125341,2,B000FP2YOK,"Yep, nothing to do with Lizzie Borden, not even the facts or depictions of the house or parents are realistic (I know, I recently was at the original Borden house).  Very low budget gore flick, even the axe wackings are not realistic, bad effects.

But.... if you have an imagination, you will love the sausage link (intestines) that come oozing out, and the unexpected head whacking.",1159228800,31,384,4.803030303030303
8125342,4,B000FP2YOK,"The scene where that guy gets axed in the chest and then gets his head chopped off is incredible....for a low or no budget drama horror, I was pleased.  I don't have unrealistic expectations when I buy and rent these independent films.  Lizzie Borden?  There is a small amount of lizzie history in the movie...don't think it's the history channel, just drop your baggage and go with it.",1157846400,2,386,4.647058823529412
