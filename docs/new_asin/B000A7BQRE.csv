2377772,5,B000A7BQRE,"If I ever got a bird for christmas, I'd wonder what was wrong with the person.

This was one of my favorites specials to watch at christmas when I was little and I'm so glad I found it on dvd so that I can rewatch it and share it with my family.

Great movie, though the comedy might be a bit difficult to understand for younger kids, they will still have fun watching it.",1355184000,5,372,4.013513513513513
2377773,4,B000A7BQRE,"...commercials?  Really?  I'm so over commercials I would rather lay out the cash and watch these movies on the DVD player.  Plus, I generally get an urge for Christmas every year around the 4th of July, so it's nice to have these wholesome films on-hand.",1354060800,2,255,4.622222222222222
2377774,1,B000A7BQRE,"There are several nice movies here, many are among my favorites.  However...

Every one of these movies is new enough to have been produced in the current 16x9 widescreen aspect ratio common to today's television sets.  When you watch them on Lifetime or wherever, if you have a current model HDTV they all fill your screen and the picture looks fine.

Not these DVDs, which are ALL cropped at the sides back to the square shape of older TV sets that haven't been made for years.  I don't know what Lifetime was thinking.  This would be a great product if it were being released in 1998.

If you have a square, standard definition set, these discs might look fine, but on my 47"" HDTV, from a Blu Ray player that UPscales SD content - these all look like an old VHS tape that was recorded in the six-hour long-play mode.  So grainy they look like they were projected on a popcorn-stucco ceiling.  That means that on standard DVD players they probably look worse.  There is no excuse for new movies to look this bad in any current video format.

Amazon's product specs were again dead wrong in listing this set as being in widescreen.  (I found a similar problem on another Christmas title here)  When I called Amazon to report this, the operator suggested I click on the ""update product info"" option, but Amazon demands all kinds of proof (other websites, pictures, etc) and apparently the fact that I bought one  was not enough.  Since I am not paid by Amazon to do their product verification, I am not going to do all their vetting and research work for them  just to prove what I saw with my own eyes.

Amazon has since altered this listing to remove the word Widescreen, but it is still not made clear that these movies are changed from their original format, cropped to fit square 4x3 TVs.  And again, there's the low resolution picture quality.  If these were in fact old VHS tapes in EP mode, the picture quality would be understandable, but being produced for DVD from new material, they should at least hold the best quality level of a DVD.  They do not.

As for the movies, they're the same ones that pop up on TV every year, (I LIKE them, and they're well worth watching IF presented properly)... BUT if these DVDs don't look even as good as the movies do on TV, why bother buying them?  I am returning this set as mislabeled and setting the DVR to record them.  I suggest you do as well.  Save your money and get better quality for free.",1353715200,36,2448,4.449438202247191
2377775,5,B000A7BQRE,I have watched every movie in this set and have had hours of enjoyment...I would recommend this set to all my friends.,1353628800,5,118,4.409090909090909

2377777,4,B000A7BQRE,"I have a collection of Christmas animates I have purchased over the years, and this ranks as one of my favorites. While it doesn't have the scope of the old-timer Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer, this gives a very spirited rendition of the 12 Days of Christmas prevelant on cassettes and CDs. It opens with Sir Carol Boomer ordering his squire Holly Berry to purloin the list of presents from Princess Silver Bell, then get all the presents for him so he can win the lady's heart. Unfortunately, the princess is picking up a list of answers to the cross-word puzzle the King is working on, and, don't you know, that is the list Holly Berry purloins. So Sir Carol Boomer sends his squire to fetch all those presents listed. Needless to say, it proved quite a task for him, but he prevails in every case. The princess, though, is not much amused by this bizarre series of presents, until the end. It really is fun to watch but there are certain incidents that happen to Holly Berry that may not be what some parents would like their young children to watch so they may be advised to preview it first. For older children and adults, I highly recommend it.",1260921600,9,1152,4.516746411483253

2377803,5,B000A7BQRE,"I had seen this on TV Y-E-A-R-S ago.  I hardly ever catch the credits (they're too fast).  But this time I just happen to catch
the name of the producer.  At the next class reunion, I had the opportunity to ask him if it were he that produced this one.
""Yes"" he said.  That meant that I had the opportunity to compliment him on the effort.  It was one of the best animations
during December (for Christmas) I had seen in a long time.  That put me on the track of it.  I looked and looked and looked
for it.  Boy did I have difficulty finding it.  It seemed nobody in Greenville, S.C., St. Louis, or Toledo could know anything
about it.  Finally I was out in Tucson. I asked at the Horizon (?) video store in the mall.  FINALLY somebody knew  to what I was referring.  At Last!  But they were going to have to order it.  So, I had to wait until the next October when I was out to see the new grandson. I then ordered it.  My daughter picked it up.  When Christmas came, she and her husband had said that ""Santa"" had brought it.  Oops. Caught.  The older grandson (for whom I ordered it) said, 'But Mom, you picked it up at the mall.'",1365206400,4,1132,4.0867579908675795

2377817,1,B000A7BQRE,"Unfortunately there were no reviews for this set of movies when I ordered them for our family this Christmas.  To be fair, I do not frequently watch Lifetime so I don't know what type of movies they produce, but the content of the majority of movies was terrible.  The plots were far fetched and unrealistic and have nothing to do with the reason we celebrate Christmas.  I assumed, again, my fault, that these movies would be something that the whole family could enjoy but that is definitely not the case.  Please don't buy these movies thinking that your family will enjoy them.  We watched each movie because I payed for them.  My kids cheered when we finally watched the last one because we didn't have to watch them again!  I threw several movies in the trash can because I thought they were completely inappropriate for anyone to watch.  I was hoping to have some good family memories for years to come of when our family would hang out and anticipate Christmas together by watching fun Christmas movies but instead we have the memory of the year mom made us watch those ridiculous Lifetime movies.  Save your money and buy some good quality movies with substance.",1356566400,3,1171,4.673170731707317
2377818,5,B000A7BQRE,"This collection of Lifetime Christmas movies is awesome! Some of my absolute favorites are in this collection. Amazing price for 12 movies also.

Another reviewer mentioned a problem with there being a square box cropping all sides of the picture. I did not have this problem and I do not have an old square TV. I have a 42 inch Sony, so I am assuming that somehow that reviewer's picture settings were off. I had ordered my DVDs right before that person posted their review, and then noticed that review right after my DVDs came and hadn't watched any of them yet. I was really nervous that they were going to look the way that person described. But they are totally fine. Yes, they are definitely not blu-ray quality because they are not blu-rays. I knew to expect this and was not disappointed by it.

So if you are a Lifetime fan and enjoy their Christmas movies, I definitely recommend this set. Great buy!",1356393600,,911,4.548780487804878

8075584,4,B000A7BQRE,"An absolutely delightful Christmas cartoon I saw in the year it was released and delighted to be able to watch it over and over again.

Rather sad to hear the voice of the late Phil Hartman voice the character of Squire Hollyberry, but his timing and acting are great.

I was also surprised to discover that after the cartoon, there is a ten-minute special remembering the late, great Romeo Muller who wrote not only The 12 Days of Christmas, but some of our iconic Christmas specials like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town, The Little Drummer Boy, and Frosty the Snowman.",1493769600,,600,4.704761904761905
