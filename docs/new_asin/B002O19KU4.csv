8375802,4,B002O19KU4,"As part of journalist Bill Curtis' ""American Justice"" series, this installment on Betty Broderick and her murder of her ex-husband and  his wife is another example of balanced reporting.  The Broderick story  became rather a cause celebre in the 1980's for feminists and other  supporters of the middle-aged Broderick who was handily dumped by her  successful husband for a younger woman.  The viewer of this report does  tend to sympathize with Broderick until nuances of her character appear  during pre-trial investigations.  This woman appears to have had one  massive personality disorder.  The best part of the video is the character  study of Betty Broderick.  It prompts one to want to go out and learn more  about the case and the woman.",966384000,21,746,5.0578512396694215
