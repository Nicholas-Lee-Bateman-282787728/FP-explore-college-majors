8589411,5,B002MSC9B6,"The movie's title may make you expect a tale of a fallen woman and while she does figure in the plot, she's not the film's main focus. Much of this silent movie is a handsomely produced adventure tale of hunting for diamonds in South Africa. It's nicely photographed and edited for a fair amount of suspense (and I don't just mean the conflict over the diamonds or the native uprising). Lewis Stone ably fills the shoes of the action hero -- yup!, its Andy Hardy's Dad and MGM's elder statesman of the 1940s before his hair turned white. In the title role, lovely Barbara Bedford delivers a mostly subtle performance but clearly conveys why so many of the men in this movie desire her. Concerning the video itself, Grapevine has delivered a rather good-looking product, apparently taken from a 35mm nitrate print, that consistently offers detailed images, even in the night scenes (and there are many). The orchestral music score not only matches the film's action but enhances it, the way film scores are supposed to function. The five-star rating is for the complete product you're buying. Sure, it's not one of the best silent films ever made -- but it is a very satisfying 75 minutes of dandy entertainment and a great value for the silent film fan.",1484611200,,1253,4.726027397260274
