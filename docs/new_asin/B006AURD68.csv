8495840,4,B006AURD68,"I'm not into pole dancing nor do I have any interest in taking it up, but I am interested in gaining hip flexibility and if possible- to the point of doing the splits.  So I got this dvd since the other videos on Amazon so far that claim to show you how aren't any good.

Unfortunately there are some stretches that you will need a pole for, but most you can do without a pole.  The music is annoying and repeats itself too often, but all in all it has some good stretching techniques.  She recommends doing the stretches 5 times a week to gain flexibility or 3x a week to maintain flexibility.  She is crazy flexible which makes you feel like you're never going to get there if you're not even close to that yet.  It would've been helpful if Alethea had someone that wasn't so flexible do the moves with her so that we could see what the stretches would look like in proper form when done by someone who isn't Gumby incarnate.  All in all however it is a good stretching dvd.",1387065600,,976,4.243243243243243
8495841,5,B006AURD68,"I bought this for a beautiful friend of mine, I have yet to see any of her pole moves but I don't have to to know they're incredibly sexy, because everything else she does is so this won't be any different. Still can't wait to see her moves though",1369785600,,247,4.061224489795919
8495842,4,B006AURD68,"The video is a little amateur and some of the music is really awful but it does present some good stretches and helps you to count out how long to hold them.

She is extremely flexible, so it's a little daunting for someone who isn't flexible.

There are several exercises without a pole and some with it- so it can be done without a pole.

I would have liked more details about proper form and how the stretches should feel. It's certainly not a comprehensive or educational reference.",1363737600,3,486,4.5
8495843,5,B006AURD68,This dvd is great.  I'm seeing progress already and it hasn't even been a month.  She definitely knows her stuff.  The dance at the end is amazing!,1359936000,,147,4.37037037037037
8495844,1,B006AURD68,"I ordered this DVD thinking it would teach me how to do the splits. One of the first sets of words were ""This is for entertainment purposes only. . ."" Then they stated the types of stretching one of which was Ballistic. This type of stretching cause much damage to the muscles and makes it harder to stretch. She also tells you that it is okay to feel sore after stretching this also is not true. You should not feel sore after you stretch, it means you are doing it wrong.

I do not recommend it for people who want to learn the correct techniques for stretching",1330560000,5,563,4.261682242990654
