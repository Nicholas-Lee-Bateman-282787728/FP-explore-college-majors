5621506,3,B00BHLTIT0,"I am deaf and I bought this the other day, being a huge WWII history fan... I was excited. Until I find out that there are no subtitles of any language or closed captioning either. While the documentary itself looks interesting... I cannot understand what the narrator is saying. This is a huge disappointment for me.

-2 stars for no subtitles/closed captioning",1375228800,11,362,4.838709677419355
5621507,4,B00BHLTIT0,Film had lots of coverage of Nazis coverage I'd not seen before.  It gave me some new information to add to my WWII DVDs.,1370476800,,121,4.041666666666667
5621508,4,B00BHLTIT0,"I have only viewed the first episode and will update this review later. The problem is that what they say does not match what I have seen on other documentaries and read in books. Specifically, they white wash the crass incompetence of the leadership of the SOE in their discussion of operation north pole. This video claims that it took some time for them to realize that the agents were captured. What actually happened is that all captured agents, from the first one, inserted prearranged things in their transmissions back to England to indicate that they had been captured. This was told to the colonel in charge of SOE and other leaders and nothing was done about it. Other sources, such as the RAF and a statistician, reported that something was wrong and nothing was done about it.",1366416000,5,789,4.72463768115942

5621520,5,B00BHLTIT0,"One of the best documentaries of Hitler and the 3rd Reich. Every kid in school should have to watch this series since history in schools have been
destroyed by the far left wing crazies that have taken over schools and government! This series has 10 episodes and in each one sticks to one
subject and is very well detailed with just incredible footage which should be seen even though disturbing. I went to school in 70's and 80's and
even though we were taught about WWII we were not given total story. I have read many books and collected many movies and documentaries
on the War and Hitler and the history of the Nazis and how they came to be and it's disturbing to see the same schemes and propaganda being
used now by members of the left wing party and media and even hollyweird to put America and it's values down and destroy freedom. I can say
that all parents should make this a must see for older kids especially 8th grade to college since they are being brainwashed with propaganda.
This is the most accurate and complete story about how Hitler and Nazis came to power and their destruction of millions of lives.",1411862400,2,1122,4.478048780487805

5621524,4,B00BHLTIT0,"HITLERS SECRETS
From his grand deception against Stalin to his spy operations in America, Adolf Hitler shared many secrets with his intelligence masters. An examination of Hitler and the eventual betrayal of his chief spymaster.

SECRET WEAPONS OF THE THIRD REICH
They were weapons systems that were far beyond anything the Allies had or could have imagined in World War II. Deployed properly, they could have changed the outcome of the war. From the worlds first ballistic missile and operational jet plane, to air-to-ground missiles and guided smart bombs, they were secret weapons of the Third Reich

NAZI PROPAGANDA
Behind the Nazi war machine was a well-crafted secret propaganda campaign aimed at Germans and foreigners. From newsreels and newspapers to well choreographed spectacles, Nazi propaganda laid the foundation early on for war and retribution in Europe.

NAZI GOLD
It was a tremendous booty, prized by Hitler as much as territory. The priceless art, personal assets and national treasuries of an entire continent. The organized plunder of these riches would become the most enormous heist in history, amounting to a vast hoard lost in the fog of war The trails of the spoils of war and Nazi gold

ROMMELS ENIGMA
In the critical battle for North Africa, German General Irwin Rommel, the Desert Fox, seemed unstoppable  a warrior with a mystical feel for the battle. But how did he really get his intelligence? The British countered with secrets of their own; phony spies, phantom armies, and battlefield magic. Declassified information shines new light on spy vs. spy operations in North Africa

THE HOLOCAUST SECRET
An examination of one of the burning questions of WWII: How did the Nazis hide their atrocities and what did the Allies know as the final solution was implemented across Europe? Secret documents, messages and cables shed new light on one of the greatest tragedies of the 20th century.

THE ULTRA ENIGMA
In World War Two one of Germanys best-kept secrets was the code machine Enigma. But this covert weapon would also become one of the greatest tools the Allies used against the Third Reich. British code breakers were behind the greatest campaign of deception in military history, changing the outcome of the Second World War

BATTLE OF THE ATLANTIC
The struggle for the Atlantic pitted Germanys lethal U-boat fleet against every weapon the Allies could muster to protect their vital supply routes to Great Britain. The story of naval intelligence, code-breaking and code stealing in the Battle of the Atlantic

'SITZKRIEG', THE PHONY WAR
Hitlers lightning strike in Poland soon gave way to a strange eight month waiting game. Blitzkrieg became Sitzkrieg, a declared but not yet fought battle  allowing spies, diplomats, agents of influence, intelligence officers, opportunists, charlatans and statesmen to make their moves From the rape of Poland to the fall of France, the secrets of Sitzkrieg

HITLERS LAST DAYS
Secret Nazi attempts to turn the tide of war as Berlin crumbled. Joseph Goebbels diaries provide a fresh understanding of life inside Hitlers bunker in the final days of the Reich.",1404259200,7,3128,5.149901380670611
5621525,4,B00BHLTIT0,"We had gotten a catalog in the mail of books & DVDs, this was one that my husband had circled to add to the wish list, when I saw their price I thought I'd look it up through Amazon to see what they offered it for, got a much better deal. This was a gift to my husband who loves war movies and their histories. He enjoyed it the 1st time he watched it as well as the 2nd watching. Was a good choice for him.",1393027200,6,407,3.744186046511628
5621526,5,B00BHLTIT0,"If you are a history buff, concerning specifically WWII, this is a great series to own!
I thoroughly enjoyed most of it.  Some of the audio was poor when Charleton Heston spoke
but all in all it was worthy of my five stars. Fantastic price and a great delivery.",1382140800,2,261,4.326530612244898
5621527,4,B00BHLTIT0,This DVD has very interesting to me in that it dug into fact that are a lot of times glossed over in other documentaries. It was the best WWII purchase I have made in a long time,1377907200,7,178,3.8378378378378377
5621528,5,B00BHLTIT0,"Having watched war docs my entire life from when I was a wee tike watching Victory At Sea and the World at War and then endless watching of the History Channel in the 80's and 90's, I'm kind of jaded and don't get too excited about them anymore because they don't offer anything new, except here. Narrated by Charlton Heston this is good stuff. I wanted anyone looking here to check out the complete box set of 65 episodes, if you buy them through an amazon seller they come out to less then 30 cents an episode (less then 20 dollars). After you watch it gift it to a friend, cheap stuff but very good! I have not actually watched this version and I see it's by Mill creek, I'll update if I get them to let you know if they put their logo on the video.",1376179200,18,752,4.122448979591836
8568607,2,B00BHLTIT0,"The facts are interesting but the narrative, not all given by Charlton Heston, is related in a monotone voice.  What should be a delivery with many inflections is delivered as if these were ordinary events. I am highly disappointed and do understand the reviewers who did not pass on this info. Would have, could have, and should have been delivered by a person of emotion and proclamation.  This is the 4th flick in a row that the reviewers got wrong. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.",1528934400,,511,4.666666666666667
8568608,5,B00BHLTIT0,"Secrets of War - Shadows of The Reich is one of the better documentary series on Nazi Germany. Despite being about 20 years old, it still holds up and was well done. Charlton Heston does a very good job with the narration too. At its current price of about $7, it's a steal. Since I don't see an index of the episodes, here are the 10 episodes:
