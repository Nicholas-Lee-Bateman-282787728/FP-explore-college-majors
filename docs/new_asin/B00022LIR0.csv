It doesn't make sense most of the time and yet you don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand what is going on. You do need to be patient. If you need  music, whiz bang action and special effects to enjoy a movie then this isn't for you. If you are a fan of early movies and are willing to give it a chance it will reward you like eating a chocolate truffle.",1463875200,10,615,3.991869918699187

2056726,1,B00022LIR0,I don`t recommend this movie I am tired of critics stating that all old movie are worth buying. I have purchased so many 4 star movies and hated them I must own one thousand movies.,1390003200,,181,4.2
2056727,5,B00022LIR0,"Here is an exceptional little comedy, one of the few early talkies that works best when sticking to its stage play roots. A showcase for both actor and director Lowell Sherman. Light, breezy satire delivered with perfect  timing. Cheers to Alpha Video for releasing this. From a TV syndication print, thank goodness it surviived!",1208044800,16,329,5.092592592592593
