8531694,4,B008XAT0NC,"I bought this mainly to see Mira Sorvino in ""The Replacement Killers"". The movie was well scripted and had lots of action. Chow Yun-Fat is a reluctant assassin (one with a conscience) and when he refuses to do the last job he ends up teaming up with Mira Sorviono's character as they try & stay one step ahead. The police are after them but in the end realize they are not the ""bad guys"".

Of the other 3 movies, I liked ""The Point Men"" and to a lesser extent ""Love Lies Bleeding"" but it was still a good movie. The one that I watched but did not care all that much for was ""Truth or Consequences, N.M."" It was okay, but I wouldn't have purchased this 4 pack because of it.",1493596800,,673,4.137404580152672

8531698,4,B008XAT0NC,"When I bought this 4-pack I thought at least The Replacement Killers was a good movie and the price was right, but after watching all 4 of the movies I found out that all of them are really good.",1361664000,3,195,4.0256410256410255
