522133,5,6302783968,"One of the best Peter Sellers movies.  I grew up watching this, and about a week ago I watched it again.  And I finally got all of the jokes.  I remember watching this when I was at least 7 years old.  It's not something you'd hide from kids.  There wasn't any corse remarks in it and that's good.  Peter Sellers actually plays three people in this movie and does a good job at it.  I'm sure you'll find this movie intertaining and fun when you watch it, so WATCH IT!",991958400,5,467,4.122222222222222
522134,5,6302783968,"In this hilarious film Peter Sellers plays three roles (one a duchess) and plays them superbly. Perhaps one has to have a taste for understated British humor to fully appreciate this film, but I'm not British and I love it. If you like Peter Sellers -- or just good comedy -- please give this delightful film a try.",970099200,12,315,4.448275862068965

522136,5,6302783968,This movie is excellent. This movie is extremely well written and directed. Peter Sellers displays great acting and comedic skills. It is a  great parody on the cold war.

522159,2,6302783968,"It was probably hilarious in 1959...not so much today. Peter Sellers came quite a long way after this movie - The Pink Panther franchise. In this film, he is not the Peter Sellers of rip roaring comedy. It is rather slow and boring. I bought it primarily to see the whole thing. I had only seen part of it on TV when I was in high school. I wouldn't have bought it if I had seen the whole thing before.",1512518400,,402,4.0375
522160,5,6302783968,"As a long term fan of Micro-nationalism (The hobby of becoming the self-proclaimed leader of a self-made fake little country), this movie is perhaps the Magnum Opus of that novel principle of individual sovereignty.  Some part of all of us wants to be unique, special, and powerful - and the Mouse that Roared appeals broadly to anyone who has ever hoisted a flag from the balcony of a tree house and dreamed of ruling the world.

On another note, I can't help pointing out that while so many of today's newer films seem to be determined to impress with special effects and popular culture, many older movies such as these, by reflecting theatrical values which are simple, elegant, and fun, remain those which stand to make a more enduring impression on viewers with their authenticity.

It's a great movie that captivates and entertains.  Don't miss it!",1509321600,3,855,4.835616438356165

522166,4,6302783968,"From the director Jack Arnold, who directed many great sci-fi movies such as ""It Came from Outer Space (1953)"", we are brought the tale about the Duchy of Grand Fenwick, a small country in Europe. Their major economy is the production and export of wine. After being snubbed by the U.S. wine industry, they declare war on the U. S. The plan is to surrender and then be compensated with the wine concession to the U.S.

Naturally, they get a little enthusiastic and things do not go as planned. Looks like they may have won the war. Peter Sellers plays three different characters (Grand Duchess Gloriana XII/Prime Minister Count Rupert Mountjoy/Tully Bascombe.)

522317,3,6302783968,"The Mouse That Roared, 1959 film

The Grand Duchy of Fenwick is a tiny country in the French Alps (so small it can't be found on a map). It was founded by an Englishman in the 15th century and is the only English speaking country in Europe. The longbow is the national weapon. Their chief export is their wine. The loss of sales due to a cheap competitor in California brought an economic depression. [Do many of the actors look similar?] Their solution is to declare war on the United States, and lose. This will bring an occupation by the US with economic aid and prosperity. [Is there a flaw in this plan?] And so a Field Marshal and twenty men dressed in chain mail leave on foot for the invasion. They board a ship in Marseilles to sail to America. An air raid drill leaves New York depopulated. The Fenwick army is opposed. Germ warfare?

They locate a scientific center where a scientist works on a super-bomb. Dr. Kokintz has a working model. ""Let's hope it will never be used."" The sight of the Fenwick army leads to rumors among the people hiding in the subway system. ""Men from Mars!"" The Pentagon is informed. ""Is this some kind of a joke?"" The Fenwickians capture the Q-bomb! Field Marshal Tully also captures the US Army General in charge of New York. ""We won!"" Is something funny going on? They sail back to Europe. The signs carried in Fenwick tell about these times. Enjoy the music. The Fenwick army returns with their prisoners. ""I showed them"" says the General. This event becomes World News. The BBC announced the NY Yankees beat the Milwaukee Brave ""in the American version of football"".

The Pentagon discusses what to do. European countries want to help Grand Fenwick now. What should they do? The opposition wants to return the bomb and the prisoners to America. Foreign automobiles arrive at Grand Fenwick. Tully looks for Helen. The diplomats play ""Diplomacy"", a board game (like ""Monopoly""). There is a car chase that looks like something from a Mack Sennett comedy. That bomb gets tossed around like a football. Prime Minister Tully signs a peace treaty for its commercial advantage. One item will allow small countries to possess the bomb. Her Highness offers greetings to the President ""and Mrs. Coolidge too"". The last scene jokes about that dangerous bomb. ""Only we know."" And so there is a happy ending.

That Q-bomb was shaped like a Rugby football, a sport popular in Britain and France. Leonard Wibberley wrote this comic novel and other books. It is a satire about life in the 1950s. There were other comedies from Shepperton Studios in the 1950s, some were funnier.",1458259200,,2604,4.703947368421052

Peter Sellers had an uncanny ability to mimick voice and accent, and shows that off well in this film.

It touches on many of the same issues of political nonsense which permeated the Cold War Era of the 1950's as did Dr. Strangelove and even the Madwoman of Challiot to some extent.  But the Mouse is a much lighter touch.  Peter Sellers was an actor who did not get the appreciation he deserved in his lifetime.  But his various roles, since he plays a number of them here, are all hilarious and show the considerable talent this man had for comedy.  Watch this and be entertained.

And yes to certain extent the movie is dated.  The Cold War is long over but the basic theme of the movie is more than that and this is what makes it still worth watching.",1431820800,,746,4.323741007194244

522542,5,6302783968,"This merry, cheerful, clever and hysterically funny movie is one of my all time favorite comedies. Below, more of my impressions with some limited SPOILERS!

The Duchy of Grand Fenwick is situated in the Alps between France and Switzerland. Created in 1370 by an English knight, it is the only English speaking country in continental Europe. With a surface of 39 square kilometres and a population of about 6000 it is also amongst the smallest independent countries in the world (in real world, only Vatican City, Monaco, Nauru and Tuvalu are smaller than this fictitious state). When this film begins, Grand Fenwick faces an unprecented crisis, threatening the very economical survival of the nation - but the Prime Minister presents to the Duchess and the Parliament a daring plan which should solve all the problems...

What follows is a wonderful comedy, full of gags and brilliant dialogs, with a stellar performance by Peter Sellers, who plays three different roles, including that of the Hereditary Field Marshal and High Constable Tully Bascombe, who is in command of all Grand Fenwick armed forces...))) Jean Seberg supports him valiantly in a secondary but important role. I was not familiar with other actors, but it seems that they were all skilled veterans of British cinema and theatre.

I saw this film at least four times in my life and it always cheered me up. This film uses a kind of intelligent, clever and merry humor without vulgarity - which is a rare thing in present day movies. Humor is also less cruel and vicious than in more modern comedies in which villains are sometimes crucified without any mercy - here, even when complete idiots are terribly mocked, it is still made with some humanity and kindness retained. And I always found this a very precious thing.

This film is a wonderful, precious thing - to buy, watch and keep. Enjoy!",1370995200,3,1865,4.8924050632911396

Thus, the incident made me think of the movie, which is why I bought it, and I only just now got around to watching it.

522547,5,6302783968,"My wife and I saw this movie when it was first released.  It was hilarious, but very timely.  The US and Soviet Union were in the heart of the Cold War weapons race, and the movie had a strong satirical undercurrent woven into its hilarious presentation.  The post-war Marshall Plan had revived a devastated Europe at an amazing rate, and it was the obvious focus of the plot.  The Duchy of Grand Fenwick wanted a piece of it.

I never forgot this movie.  Now every time North Korea rattles its sabers, I think of the movie again.  Our perception of threat today is as real as the fear of the ""Q-bomb"" in the movie.  But despite their bluster, North Korea is more like the Duchy of Grand Fenwick than any country I can imagine.  The insertion of modern destructive power into a pre-industrial civilization sounds hauntingly familiar.

""The Mouse That Roared"" (1959)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I first saw ""The Mouse That Roared"" (and its sequel, ""The Mouse On The Moon"") in the early 1970s, it was an effective window back into the politics of the Cold War in its height of the 1950s, and although the machinations of the Western and Eastern blocs are more distant now, the film still holds its own both as a historical time capsule and as a droll, light British comedy of the kind that gave rise to the more chaotic glories of Monty Python, et. al.  Gotta love Peter Sellars, especially in multiple roles! The moon movie is probably a better bet for younger viewers, but this one still holds up. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1349654400,,857,5.856
522581,5,6302783968,"The Mouse that Roared(released Oct/59)is a brilliant British comedy starring Peter Sellers in three different roles in this anti war/cold war film based on the /55 best selling book by Leonard Wibberly. Sellers is backed by a powerhouse of a British cast including such stalwarts as William Hartnell as Sgt. Buckley(to become in a few months ahead,the first Dr Who),Leo McKern as the head of the opposition party(better known as #2 in The Prisoner and still later Rumpole of the Bailey),and well known Canadian actor as the U.S.Secretary of Defense William Austin. Also along as Seller`s love interest is a young Jean Seaburg.
The plot involves the tiny country of Grand Fenwick. Their only export was their wine and their only country of consumption was the U.S.However an American winery started using a name very similar to theirs and their wine exports dropped off the charts. Fenwick,now in bankruptcy,declares war on the U.S.,thinking that post-war reparations will put their country back into solvency. A tiny band of Fenwickian soldiers(dressed in chain male,with bows and arrows as weapons)nvade New York city(dig that New York skyline!).At that very moment the streets of NYC are deserted as a practice drill for a bomb attack is underway. The little group make their way to the exact facility,where a professor(Dave Kossoff)who has developed a Q bomb(the most powerful weapon yet made)and his daughter(Jean Seaburg)are working. The original plan of the group was to surrender themselves,but Tully(Sellers)who is in charge changes things midstream and takes the two prisoner along with a general and four NYC cops. They return to Grand Fenwick,and as expected,the world comes to them with various offers of monetary assistance;each after ownership of the bomb.
In the end Tully and the professors daughter fall in love and he is made the new prime minister. The bomb,it is decided,will stay in Grand Fenwick and a new peace treaty with the U.S. promises to be more than generous with Grand Fenwick.
From the very beginning of the film,you know this is going to be different from any other,as the opening Columbia logo of the girl holding the``flame``,comes to life `when she sees a run in her stockings and leaves the podium. In the end the only reference to a mouse comes out of the ``dud``bomb,which comes to life again,unbeknownst to its new owners. In between this is a comedy of errors and faux pauxs all designed to hit the funny bone,which it does in spades. Peter Sellers is at the top of his game here playing the Grand Duchess,the prime minister and the head of the army. Of course the uncanny likeness of all three to each other is explained because the original founder of Fenwick really was the FOUNDER of Fenwick. This film became a staple of TV back in the 60s and to watch it again,in colour at that,after so many years,it stirs up many memories of that era and the cold war this is based on. The on going paranoia that existed in the background of day to day life in everyone`s minds about a possible attack by enemy forces,the bomb shelters,the air raid drills,etc. Wow,how the world has changed. But what has not is this movie`s message and the grand and hilarious way it portrays its` smart send up of those times.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:85:1. The film could use a good remastering(especially the opening credits),but overall the picture is pretty good. The only extra is the trailer and others from other Sellers films.
Overall an excellent and funny film,highlighting the cold war at its height and its star peter Sellers,playing three different roles,all backed by a great British cast. Highly recommended.",1335052800,,3678,4.94345718901454
522582,3,6302783968,"THE MOUSE THAT ROARED is a color film starring Peter Sellars in three roles. The movie is a comedy, but it is only moderately amusing, and it will not evoke any laughs. The plot is clever, but in the hands of the scriptwriter and director, the movie is slow-moving, obvious, repetitive, and dull. The subject matter was timely and relevant during the 1950s, and it is just as timely and relevant today, when North Korea and Iran repeatedly threaten to blow up other countries with nuclear weapons.

The plot of THE MOUSE THAT ROARED involves the following elements. A tiny country in Europe, the Duchy of Grand Fenwick, has an economy that depends on making Pinot Grand Fenwick wine. At the start of the movie, we learn that an American winery has started making, ""Pinot Grand Enwick."" As a result, Americans switched to buying Grand Enwick wine instead of Grand Fenwick wine. Ordinarily, the best approach would be to file a lawsuit for trademark infringement. However, in this movie, royalty decide to declare war on the United States. In deciding to declare war on the United States, royalty is hoping to lose the war, and is counting on losing, so that they can receive economic assistance from the United States. (It helps if the viewer is aware of the Marshall Plan, used after WWII.) The viewer of the film is treated to scenes where actors, dressed in medieval archery soldier uniforms, take a tugboat across the Atlantic Ocean and invade New York City. The invaders in their medieval archery uniforms captures the Q-bomb, as well as its inventor, Dr. Kokintz and his beautiful daughter.

What makes the movie especially tedious and obvious, is that a segment of the movie, lasting on and off for about 15 minutes, copies from the plot of WAR OF THE WORLDS, performed on radio by Orson Welles. The Orson Welles broadcast was October 30, 1938. Again and again, actors in the movie refer to the invaders from Fenwick as men from Mars. But this is a boring running joke. The actors wear medieval armor that, as any viewer can see, does not in any way resemble an imaginary man from Mars. Again and again, the actors in the movie feign alarm about the ""men from Mars."" But I did not find the actors, dressed in chain mail and helmets, to resemble any ""men from Mars."" Another boring aspect of THE MOUSE THAT ROARED is a running joke where two men in bare feet are trodding on grapes, making wine.

The irony, intended by the scriptwriter, is that royalty in Grand Fenwick picked one of the least capable of the Duchy's citizens, named Tully Bascombe, to lead the attack on the United States, with the hope that his team of archers would lose the invasion, resulting in economic aid from the U.S. But the result, as shown by the acting and the plot, was that the Duchy's invasion succeeded, due to the capture of the Q-bomb by the invading army from the Duchy of Fenwick. To repeat, the irony used in this movie is that a person chosen to perform a task, who was chosen on the basis of his incompetence, actually succeeds in performing the task. This is a clever plot element. But it could have and should have been handled much better by the scriptwrter and actors.

I saw THE MOUSE THAT ROARED when it first came out in 1959. I remembered two parts from the movie, namely the part where the U.S. military man demands that he be fed with tin plates, and the other part where the actors toss the Q-bomb to each other in a football game. Thus, upon this second viewing (in the year 2012), I started to watch THE MOUSE THAT ROARED with optimism. Unfortunately, my initial optimism continually shrivelled during the hour. I was doomed to spend the entire hour in boredom.

The question that arises is as follows. Why did I like this movie when I first saw it at the age of eight? The answer is as follows. Little children are easily impressed and captivated by shows such as TELETUBBIES or THEODORE THE TUGBOAT or THE BIG COMFY COUCH (from the current era) or by CAPTAIN KANGAROO or ROMPER ROOM (from a previous era). Thus, my advice to potential customers is as follows. If you find yourself captivated by TELETUBBIES, or by similar shows for infants and toddlers, then you will likely enjoy THE MOUSE THAT ROARED. But if you are not captivated by TELETUBBIES, then you will likely find THE MOUSE THAT ROARED to be boring, obvious, and slow-moving.

The film that comes closest to the type of comedy that was intended by the writers of THE MOUSE THAT ROARED is TOP SECRET. TOP SECRET is a 1984 comedy film directed by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker. TOP SECRET succeeds marvelously with its many sight-gags. THE MOUSE THAT ROARED also has many clever sight-gags, but they are brought down by the heavy weight of tedium that is provided by all other aspects of THE MOUSE THAT ROARED. Therefore, I suggest the interested customer purchase TOP SECRET instead.",1330732800,3,4871,4.631944444444445

All that said... it has lost a bit of its allure for me when re-viewing it in 2010. Peter Sellers best work would follow this offering (e.g.: Lolita, Being There, etc.) and I have been a hopeless liberal for fifty more years.

522605,4,6302783968,"This is a savvy Cold War ""comedy""--an adaptation of a very sharp little book that probably ranks alongside ""Strangelove"" and ""The Russians are Coming"" as a satiric classic of that era. The premise itself dates well because it's the story of a small country trying to manage in a world of Superpowers. It's also a lesson in how small countries can cynically play Superpowers off one another in order to gain perks--a point that's missed by a lot of reviewers.

I dearly love this old chestnut but it's full of problems, nearly enough to earn it a three-star rating. Right off, the directing is uninspired. Second, rather than play it straight from the book and cast it more appropriately, the producers decided to gimmick the film by having Sellers play three separate roles, one of which--the elderly Duchess--isn't even in the original book (but it's probably there so Sellers can appear in drag). This multi-role idea was a mercifully brief trend in (largely) British comedies of the 50s and early 60s, the best (and best realized) British example probably being Alec Guinness's multiple performances in ""Kind Hearts and Coronets."" Sellers' singular (and late) working of this gimmick is in ""Strangelove"" of course, which is the best-known example of this multi-role acting for modern audiences--British or otherwise. ""Strangelove,"" I'd argue, was such a success that it (along with the Pink Panther films, and a few other well directed efforts like ""The Party"") camouflaged Sellers' otherwise highly variable, often surprisingly disappointing, output. A good example of how lackluster Sellers could be is ""Casino Royale"" where Woody Allen and David Niven provide the solid laughs and Sellers, not atypically, performs as if his mere presence is hilarious, and it isn't.

""The Mouse that Roared""'s sequel--""The Mouse on the Moon""--is revealing too. Sellers is absent (he refused the part) yet the ever-undervalued Ron Moody does a far more memorable job with the role of Prime Minister--in fact his is one of my favorite comedy performances. Margaret Rutherford replaces Sellers as the senile Duchess, bringing a certain high-comedic weight to the dithering and bumbling--Rutherford, unlike Sellers, could often be innately funny onscreen. ""The Mouse that Roared"" is a classic, but ""The Mouse on the Moon"" is the better film (directed by Richard Lester) with a far meatier cast and superior production. It suffers only from a less novel, regrettably second-hand premise, and the presence of Bernard Cribbins who manages to be somewhat less interesting than Sellers in the same role in the first film. Cribbins' puzzle-headed ""ordinary bloke"" character, used here, probably played great in the UK but never traveled well. Terry Thomas also adds a lot to this film.

""The Mouse that Roared"" is a fun film and essential viewing, but as the years slide by it's looking a tad shopworn and awkward. I would have preferred it without Sellers at all or with Sellers only playing the bland Tully Bascombe, and Moody and Rutherford in the other roles.

Of course, it doesn't work out this way. Fenwick invades the U.S.A. with an army of twenty suited out in medieval armor & weapons. Upon entering the States they are supposed to surrender but they stumble upon the professor who has invented the ""Q Bomb"" & has it in his possession.

522638,5,6302783968,"""The Mouse That Roared,"" directed by Jack Arnold, is an entertaining satire about the fictional Duchy of Grand Fenwick, a tiny European monarchy which may remind viewers of such real countries as Liechtenstein or Monaco.  With his country facing bankruptcy, the prime minister of Grand Fenwick announces his clever plan to declare war on the United States of America; his intent is to lose the absurdly uneven contest and reap the benefits of post-war American aid.  But things don't go quite as expected.

""Mouse"" opens with a whimsical animated title sequence that effectively sets the tone for the rest of the picture.  This is followed by a funny faux-documentary sequence about the fictional duchy, and then by the actual story.  The film is a splendid showcase for the great Peter Sellers, who plays three characters, all citizens of Grand Fenwick: the scheming prime minister, the venerable duchess, and the mild-mannered commander of the duchy's pitiable army.  Sellers is absolutely brilliant; he creates three wonderfully distinct characters, and it's especially fun to see the scenes where these characters interact with each other.  His performance(s) alone make the film a classic in my reckoning.

I found ""Mouse"" to be an enchanting and enjoyable film, full of absurd images and amusing lines.  The marvelous sets, costumes, and props are full of wonderful details that make the film a delight for the eye from start to finish.  And despite its comic tone, the film touches on some very serious issues that remain timely.

522651,5,6302783968,"In 1959, a hilarious Cold War-inspired film entitled ""The Mouse that Roared"" was produced about a fictional tiny country named ""The Duchy of Grand Fenwick"".  Grand Fenwick is no ordinary country.  First, it's the smallest country in the world (about 15 square miles).  Second, it's the only English-speaking country in continental Europe (located in the French Alps).  Third, it's primary source of revenue is its wine; which was quite popular in the United States until a Californian winery started to bottle a cheaper wine with a similar name to the Grand Fenwick wine.  Several letters of protest had been sent to the U.S., but no response had ever been received, except from the U.S. Department of Agriculture about growing grapes.  To prevent bankruptcy, Prime Minister Count Rupert Mountjoy (Peter Sellers, 1925-1980) makes an unusual suggestion to the Grand Fenwick Parliament: declare war on the United States, then immediately surrender so that the U.S. will provide bountiful amounts of monetary aid.  Grand Duchess Gloriana XII (also played by Peter Sellers) doesn't initially like the idea of going to war, but she acquiesces and the Prime Minister Mountjoy calls upon the Grand Fendwick military Field Marshal, Tully Bascombe (again, played by Peter Sellers), to lead Grand Fendwick's 20 (or so) man army (wearing chain mail from the Middle Ages) to invade the U.S. in New York City, where they can surrender to U.S. immigration authorities.  Grand Fendwick's Declaration of War is perceived initially as a prank in the U.S., which is more interested in the development of a new super bomb (dubbed the Q-bomb) by the well-known scientist Professor Alfred Kokintz (David Kossoff, 1919-2005), who is also in New York City.  Due to the potential destructiveness of the Q-bomb, New York City is evacuated.  So, when the Grand Fenwick army arrives, there is no one around for them to surrender to.  Instead, they proceed into the emptied city and are misconstrued by some evacuation officials as being extraterrestrials because of their chain mail.  When Tully happens across a newspaper, he realizes that they are not far from where Professor Kokintz is developing the Q-bomb and decides that surrender isn't necessarily the only available option.  What follows is a complete shock to the entire world.

Even after 46 years, ""The Mouse that Roared"" is still a hilarious and very entertaining film, and Peter Sellers did a superb job of portraying three very different characters.  Overall, I rate ""The Mouse that Roared"" with 5 out of 5 stars.  Other memorable characters include Professor Kokintz's daughter Helen (Jean Seberg, 1938-1979), General Snippet (MacDonald Parke, 1891-1960), Will Buckley (William Hartnell, 1908-1975, who is better known for being the very first ""Doctor Who"" on the long-running BBC sci-fi TV series of the same name), Benter (Leo McKern, 1920-2002) and the United States Secretary of Defense (Austin Willis, 1917-2004).",1121299200,71,2958,5.248407643312102

522656,5,6302783968,"A fellow graduate school student and I saw this film in New Haven when it was first released and had no idea what to expect, except that it starred Peter Sellers whose work we both admired very much in earlier films such as The Ladykillers (1955), Tom Thumb (1958), and I'm All Right Jack (1959). So we settled back in our seats and were immediately enchanted by Grand Fenwick and its monarch, Grand Duchess Gloriana (Sellers). The best way to enjoy this film now is to see it as a whimsical fantasy rather than as a serious satire of the Cold War and the widespread concern then about thermonuclear weapons. Its greatest strength remains the same as it was 45 years ago: The talents of Peter Sellers. He plays three quite different characters, the aforementioned Grand Duchess as well as ""Field Marshal"" Tully Bascombe (who leads a 20-soldier invasion of the United States) and Count Mountjoy, the devious prime minister.
The plot (such as it is) consists of a series of humorous incidents prior to, during, and then following the invasion. As directed by Jack Arnold, the film focuses on the implications of a basic conceit: Declare war on the United States (as did Japan and then Germany), lose the war, and then have your economy restored to greater health than ever before (e.g. Japan and Germany). Count Mountjoy's strategy fails for reasons best revealed in the film. One of the several brilliant elements is Arnold's use of Professor Kokintz (David Kossoff) who has invented the ""Q Bomb,"" a weapon whose nuclear power (he claims) is ""approximately"" equal to 100 hydrogen bombs. Better yet, it has the size and shape of an American football and thus can easily be tucked under an arm until activated. Presumably the straight-faced silliness throughout this film made a favorable impression on members of the Monty Python Flying Circus.
Regrettably, the DVD version I have offers no special features other than clearer image and sound. Those who enjoy this film are urged to check out Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949) in which Alec Guinness plays eight different roles.",1063929600,7,2074,4.878186968838527

Saturday Evening Post from December 1954 to January 1955 as The Day New York Was Invaded, is no longer in print--despite the fact that the
tattered copy I'm holding is something like the 30th printing.  And the film does not seem to have been transferred to DVD, though I did find a copy
of the equally funny sequel, The Mouse on the Moon.  Our growing amnesia is unfortunate, both because this is just a funny story, and also because
current events reveal it to still be timely.
The tale concerns the Duchy of Grand Fenwick, a tiny European nation which ""lies in a precipitous fold of the northern Alps.""  It was founded in
1370 by British soldier of fortune Roger Fenwick, under not altogether honorable circumstances.  Practically the only thing that is produced there,
and the only reason anyone has ever heard of it, is a fine wine called Pinot Grand Fenwick.  Other than this one export, the nation remains happily
isolated, a medieval remnant in the modern world, ruled over by Duchess Gloriana XII--""a pretty girl of twenty-two"" in the book, a more matronly
woman in the film, so that Peter Sellers can play her--and her prime minister, the Count of Mountjoy (also played by Peter Sellers).
As the story begins, crisis has descended upon the Grand Duchy in the form of revenue shortfalls.  It is determined that the most effective way of
raising money is to declare war on the United States, the pretext for which is the introduction of a San Rafael, California winery of a wine called
Pinot Grand Enwick, a provocation that can not be allowed to stand.  As Gloriana explains the aims of the war :
  All in all, as I said before, there is no more profitable and sound step for a nation without money or credit to take, than declare war
  on the United States and suffer a total defeat.
It's easy to see why the fortunes of this story changed over the years; written just a few years after the Marshall Plan, it resonated in an America that
had won WWII and rebuilt its enemies.  But in the late 60s and early 70s, the Left determined that America was evil and that there was nothing
honorable nor humorous about the Cold War, Vietnam, or any of the other seemingly benign extensions of American power.  Wibberley's witty
insight must have seemed the stuff of delusions or insidious propaganda to folks who had convinced themselves that we were really an imperialist
nation.  But now that the ""blame America first"" crowd has been routed, you can read that speech above, or watch the movie, and hear the eerie
echoes coming from Afghanistan.  What might Mr. Wibberley have made of the absurd notion that at the same we were bombing the Taliban and Al
Qaeda we were bombing the rest of the Afghanis with food supplies?  And the rest of the war has played out exactly as the Duchess Gloriana would
have predicted--the Taliban had no sooner been routed than we started pouring in money and rebuilding that broken nation.  You could read through
thousands of pages of anti-American screeds by Noam Chomsky, Susan Sontag, Barbara Kingsolver, and their ilk, without increasing your
understanding of the world by one iota.  But in that one speech, Leonard Wibberley basically explains the entire 20th (or American) Century.
At any rate, Tully Bascombe, chief forest ranger of the Duchy (again played by Sellers in the film), and twenty longbowmen charter a boat and
invade Manhattan, intending to surrender as quickly as possible.  But by happy coincidence, the whole city is underground for an air raid test, and
when first Tully and his chain mail clad ""army"" are mistaken for aliens and then they capture a scientist, Dr. Kokintz, and his super-lethal quadium
(or Q) bomb, Grand Fenwick ends up winning the war.  Armed with the Q bomb, Fenwick forms a League of Little Nations and dictates its own
peace terms and blackmails the U.S. and Russia into a general nuclear disarmament.
Tully, hero of Fenwick's great victory, of course gets the girl--Dr. Kokintz's daughter in the film; the Duchess herself in the novel.  This gives Mr.
Wibberley one last opportunity for a very amusing, though thoroughly politically incorrect, observation, as Mountjoy tries to convince the Duchess
that she must take a husband :
  'I hope,' said Gloriana warily, 'that you are not going to suggest that I marry the American minister because I won't do it.
  I've been reading about the Americans in a women's magazine and they're all cruel to their wives,'
  'Cruel to their wives?' echoed the count.
  'Precisely.  They treat them as equals.  They refuse to make any decisions without consulting them.  They load them up with
  worries they should keep to themselves.  And when there isn't enough money, they send them out to work instead of earning
  more by their own efforts.  Some of them even make their wives work so they can go to college.  They are not men at all.
  They are men-women.  And their wives are women-men.  If I am to marry, I want a husband who will be a man and let me
  be a woman.  I'll be able to handle him better that way.'
Of course, the ultimate truth of this sharp observation lies in the final line, Gloriana's certainty that theoretical ""equality"" is unnecessary for her to
actually control a husband.
Both book and movie are a great deal of fun.  They are well worth seeking out.  That their satire is once again applicable to the events of the day
should be reason enough for a revival.

522659,3,6302783968,"When ""The Mouse That Roared"" appeared in U.S. theatres forty years ago it was a kind of cult classic, a bit hip, a bit continental in perspective, definitely offbeat, and even a bit subversive in its good-natured skewering of cold war tensions.  It also showcased the considerable talents of Peter Sellers, who appears in multiple roles.
Whereas some political films, including the classic ""Dr. Strangelove,"" can retain their satirical edge many years after their initial release, this film does not.  There is an overall naivit in the film's portrayal of the alleged generosity and goodness of the United States government.  Certainly world events over the past generation have proven that going to war with the U.S. is anything but a pathway to future prosperity.  Overall, the film accepts the mythologies of American cold war culture and foreign policy more than it penetrates and satirizes them.  Moreover, the patronizing sexism demonstrated in the ""love interest"" angle associated with the character played by Jean Seberg is downright embarrassing from today's standpoint.
