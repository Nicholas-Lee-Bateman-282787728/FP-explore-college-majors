However this movie really is awful, and I mean that in every sense of the way. This movie is a movie within a movie, meaning that when the couple plays a movie, we are now watching another terrible movie.
The story of the movie is a couple go to a video rental store, in the hopes of renting a couple of scary movies for Halloween. They happen to come across a store closing so they can have a Halloween party, however the couple is allowed to shop and pick movies that the store manager doesn't want them to rent because these are way too scary, bloody, and not your typical horror movie. Which would make anyone want it more, seeing as they came in looking for just that... If you didn't want them to take the movie, tell them these suck I would get this. I have to say, the acting in this whole scene should have been enough of a red flag to make me take out the movie and ship it back to Netflix.
I mean the boyfriend walks in and says ""My lady friend and I would like to rent a scary movie."" Who the heck says lady friend, who introduces their girl friend like that? Then the store manager went on a rant about do they want some typical boring Hollywood horror movie (I cut down the description because it's a long sentence on how bad Hollywood horror movies are.)
Clearly, we know what happens if the movie is called Late Fee and the description says they didn't return it on time. Their punishment wasn't a $5 fee.",1467849600,,1583,4.262458471760797

8399165,4,B003L16F9U,I really enjoyed these short stories which you do not see anymore.  Well done and creepy enough.  I enjoyed the first one better than the second.,1374883200,,145,4.538461538461538
8399166,2,B003L16F9U,"A couple takes a chance by renting two scary movies from the local video store, but as the clerk at the counter warns them, these are not your average Horror films, and the store is very strict when it comes to their return policy! The first flick features a buxom blonde who gives her john more than he bargained for during a kinky sex session. Up next is another steamy sexploitation picture with women behind bars in an infernal prison of the damned! While John Carchietta and Carl Morano have made every attempt to recapture the seedy Grindhouse aesthetic in their recent Horror anthology, LATE FEE, they really miss the mark overall. Sure, the segments look like they could have stepped out of the late 70s, but like many films of the era, the slack pace and tedious plotting make for a difficult watch. What's worse is that the wrap-around story, which is the only interesting and entertaining part of the entire movie, ends in one of the most anticlimactic finales ever filmed. Do yourself a favor and avoid the late fee on this flick by leaving it on the shelf.

8399167,1,B003L16F9U,"This sounded interesting, so I paid $2.99 on Amazon to watch it.  HUGE mistake!  I fell asleep twice, it took me two days to get through it, which I only did because I had paid for it, the acting is some of the worst that I've ever seen and the story plot is overdone and quite predictable.",1360368000,,290,4.0701754385964914
8399168,3,B003L16F9U,"cool halloween type of movie, its 2 short stories and a story with in them as well if that makes sense lol. The first one I liked it was creepy,and weird but good, the second one I really didn't care for. To be honest I liked the begining of the movie the middle of the movie and the end of it the best, those are the parts that all take place on halloween night. Some creepy people in the movie for sure ! if you like horror and halloween i think you will enjoy this movie",1307232000,2,473,3.9375
8399169,1,B003L16F9U,"This is THE worst movie I have seen for a long time. The short films inside the movie were shot previously in 2003. The director plugged them in to be part of another movie to make a fast buck. The production value is extremely low and the movie was shot in a real video store in New Jersy using a hand-held camera. It is like a free commercial for the store exchanging for s shoot. In this sense, the director-producer never intended to make a decent movie in the first place. Instead, by re-using two old shorts to be part of new movie can lower production costs and make some fast money out of ignorant audience. Since it is part of new releases among all other DVD & blu-ray titles on that particular day (Tuesday) and there are no film reviews for this direct-to-DVD title, they can easily fool the audience for trying it out just based on the title.

It is very unfortunate for a somewhat serious filmaker who did some decent shorts back in 2003 to hail Mary this kind of money making scheme and damage his own reputation for the future if there is one. I know it is hard to sustain a living being an indie filmmaker. But this kind of deperate shot defeats the purpose of his or her past dream of being a serious filmmaker as I speculate. In fact, the 2003 short is not too bad. I can see it as a decent genre effort. But when one tries to rehash old material into a new project in an obvious low production value, its intention becomes questionable.",1298160000,2,1456,4.313868613138686

8399171,1,B003L16F9U,"This is a good bad movie, I like talking about how bad movies are and this one has plenty to talk about. And it has a cool cover, perfect.

A couple walks into a DVD store and is deciding what movie to rent, they don't want that weak Hollywood horror. They pick up a title called ""Damnation."" I've already seen Damnation so at this point I'm trying to think of any way that I can stop these two from renting the movie. Damnation was bad, like, unwatchable bad. It leaves you confused and angry, you're not confused about a plot twist, you're confused as to why anyone would make this movie.

My pleas go unanswered, they rent the movie along with ""The Pickup"". So basically, all they do is watch these two movies without adding any real commentary. So if you've already seen one, or both of these movies you don't need to watch this movie.",1281312000,,839,4.371794871794871
