2138480,5,B0002XVQNK,YES bring it on in volumes. I'll take Lost In Space anyway I can get my hands on this classic television series. If season 3 is released in Volume 3 and 4 I'll be happy just to get the entire uncut series on DVD. Thats what is important now isn't it?,1093824000,5,250,3.9215686274509802
2138481,5,B0002XVQNK,"I don't agree with you both one bit. I applaude Fox for doing this in two volumes so that we on a limited budget can afford to purchase these sets.

2138530,3,B0002XVQNK,"The worst season of this series by far. Lower budgets, cheaper sets, and overly campy elements arising. That being said, there were about 10 decent episodes amidst the third (and final) season. As a piece of 1960s TV's pop cultural history, it is certainly worth a view, however season 1 and 2 are much better.",1481932800,,310,4.654545454545454

2138660,5,B0002XVQNK,"This was a very fun program which could have gone further if it had not become tangled on a tangent known as ""Dr. Smith.""  Hey is dear to our hearts in a strange way in regards to his character, but we love him just the same. The rest of the cast did their damn best to make this series work.  I was a pre-teen when this show was telecast and I saw great potential which was not realized due to the tacky monsters and stories which almost always revolved around Dr. Smith. I was under 12 years of age and even then I thought this show was wrapped around Dr. Smith's little finger. I felt the show should have been renamed ""The Dr. Smith space special"" which predominantly ended up revolving around Jonathan Harris do I do admire for building this character tremendously although I felt he was a selfish actor in that his associates could not shine since he was blazing with craziness  from episode to episode.  I believe that ""Star Trek"" was a much more serious sci-fi show although it's ratings when telecast were significantly lower than ""lost in space"" Surprisingly enough. Just the same, I purchased all seasons because I still enjoyed the tenderness and caring that seem to come through in many shows as well which was a predominant factor that attracted people unwittingly. We enjoy witnessing good behavior indicating how we feel about many things in our culture i.e. Hard work will be recognized and rewarded (ha ha).  We claim to these values and try to perpetuate them although we witness contradictory situations compare to what we hope for and witnessed in this classic. I love the show regardless of ""The detractor."" Enjoy!",1439856000,,1636,4.666666666666667

2138737,4,B0002XVQNK,"Lost in Space started as a serious Sci-Fi adventure in space and the first season was excellent.  Season 2 began to transform the show into more of a campy show, but the actors believed, and with few exceptions, so did we.  Season 3 has some great episodes, including ""Prisoners of Space"" and ""Trip to the Future"" which was partially used as a storyline in the big screen film of the same name.  By the end of the season; however, even the main stars could hardly deal with the camp and ridiculous episodes.  Fans will enjoy regardless.",1404864000,,536,4.552083333333333
2138738,4,B0002XVQNK,"Lost In Space continues on with the second half of season two in this four disc set,all in separate snap cases. Each ep has a scene selection option. The picture is very good for the dates it was filmed in(1967) and has the usual""defects"" associated with film of that era,but nothing untoward.
In this part of the season we go from the sublime to the silly. There is an ep early on that is so oddly out of place it hits you like a rock. Will is exposed to some alien knowledge and becomes very disillusioned and cynical with the way the adults around him behave. There is a very touching moment where Doctor Smith tells Will(as he walks away) to not grow up too quickly. It is a heart felt moment and one you do not see very often on LIS.On the ridiculous side we have plots that involve a silly knight and a talking dragon,a ghost,a pirate,space vikings and a toymaker. We see the visits of actors Hans Conried, and in the last ep John Carradine. We also see the robot becoming more and more human,with his over acting,cat calls and jabs,usually at the expense of Dr. Smith.
Jonathan Harris by now has become the star of the show. There isn't an ep he isn't in. The audience ate his performances up then and he still is absolutely hilarious with his sneakiness combined with his extreme cowardice. Even though you could hate him,you still couldn't/can't get enough of him. He made it look all too easy,and it shows just what a consummate actor he was.
Included with this set are two audio interviews with cast members Williams and Lockhart together,and one with Harris alone. I especially recommend the latter,as you get a nice glimpse into the mind of Harris the actor. Lastly this is the last season with the same theme song and the ""same time,same station"" credits at the end of each ep. The last ep here gives us a glimpse at""next week's"" upcoming hijinks. Of course,as I previously mentioned in another LIS review, next week refers really to next season. But they re ran selected eps and the last ep of season two was run a week before season three was about to start.
All in all I highly recommend this show,one the whole family can watch together. The show was getting less serious as the season rolled to an end(more tongue in cheek),but it was/is still enjoyable.",1404864000,,2273,4.519417475728155

But what it is (and we can finally see it in perspective all these years later) is the funniest, campiest Sci-Fi Comedy show you'll ever see.
The things that the robot and Dr. Smith say are just LOL hysterical.  I mean c'mon, the people who wrote those lines definitely weren't taking things too seriously.
I haven't watched this show in many years. But when I watched this episode I went from being in a bad mood to laughing so hard that I forgot about what I was so upset about and had a fun time watching several more episodes.
So for that, I give it 4 stars for being a great Sci-Fi Comedy.",1386288000,,756,4.309859154929577
2138778,4,B0002XVQNK,"OK, if you didn't grow up with reruns of Lost in Space, you might not get it. The special effects are dated, the plots are campy, and it might be misunderstood as a stale cheese ball. But look beyond that and there is some real comedy, some first rate music and for those of us who grew up with it LIS is a familiar, fun and comfortable piece of nostalgia. The alliterative insults of Dr Smith are still amusing, the cast are seasoned pros and somehow it is a lot of fun. Sci Fi purists will scoff.. But what should you expect from a show that put a fur hat on a chimp and called it the ""Bloop."" I enjoying it to this day,and at least (with apologies to William Shatner) no one is making out with an alien every week. An imperfect time capsule of the mid-1960s.

2138802,3,B0002XVQNK,"This volume features more campy and cheesy fun with some of the all time greatest episodes such as the most memorable Trip Through the Robot where the Robinsons get to walk inside Robot which is a real hoot. The other gem is Revolt of the Androids, with its quirky android that has an infamous mantra of ""Crush...Kill...Destroy!""

Some of the other episodes are dreadful but Dr Smith makes up for them everytime; Jonathan Harris injecting so much fun into his mischievous persona. I think the show lost its serious nature in the season but it became spacey and psychedelic so is a treasure of the 60s. Watch out for the creatures who look like fancy dress costumes, and look for cameos from some actors who did not know better. I still love the show as a gem from my childhood but it is easy to see that this was all fantasy and little logic and as long as one understands that LIS is a wonderful step back in time.",1373846400,,915,4.414201183431953

2138855,5,B0002XVQNK,"Irwin Allen, who created Lost In Space was quite the prolific producer. He created and/or gave us Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, The Time Tunnel, Land of the Giants, The Swiss Family Robinson and Code Red. Quite an impressive list of credits.

The first few episodes of L.I.S. were quite serious and closer to hard sci-fi movies like Forbidden Planet. Doctor Zachary Smith started out as a seriously sinister evil agent but just like Battlestar Galactica a genius idea was ruined by the TV industry culture and the show was watered down and turned into a campy corn-ball fest. I respect his range as an actor to be a serious threat and then morph into a somewhat whimpy (let's NOT go there) scared-ey cat. Imagine the day they explained how they were changing his character. Lolz.  I still watched it as a kid- really I watched anything with a spaceship, robot, guns, explosions and kung-fu fighting.

In any show there are episodes and writing that transform the show above its medium. (Warning: Memory reaching starting) Remember when your favorite comedy sitcom turned serious and showed real acting and your beloved characters were shown dealing with real heavy situations? Those are always your favorite episodes.

The Anti-Matter Man is that episode for me. We have the darker versions of Mr Robinson and Don plotting to replace their positively-charged counterparts and steal their identities.
So many things to think about. It's good acting by all. The evil father is a delight to see and Don- playing the anger-filled lackey is perfect. The bad version of the robot is a let down, but I love the fight on the bridge (doubles and all) and absolutely love how the action music kicks in right as the real Mr Robinson emerges from the shadow to save his son and get back to the family. I even love how Will helps a bit. The choreography involving the torch, cage, orange alien (another lolz) and chain (both how he uses it and throws it at his evil counterpart) is inspired greatness.

How about how the father manipulates Don, knowing his weaknesses from being close to the positive Don? Think about that. The captive Dad, KNOWS how Don is and pushes the right buttons to make him lose it. I love the line ""I said, that's enough of that""

Okay, okay I even like how the father grabs the pipe and tries to stop the robot at the gate.
All good stuff. Oh just imagining what DAD would have done had he gotten away with his plot. Poor mom (lolz)

Please watch this episode as a small reminder of what happens when better writing is allowed to be used by television producers. If your impression is of... nothing more than a man in a  carrot suit- then this episode is a clue of what could have been.

The 1998 movie Lost In Space was great too- considering it's source material. I find it hilarious when people complain about the plot. I mean, have you seen the original?
If you loved Lost in Space then this an episode worth watching again and again.",1334188800,3,2955,4.602661596958175

2138861,3,B0002XVQNK,"Fans of the original Lost in Space television series will enjoy certain episodes in this collection (maybe most of them), especially ""Trip Through The Robot"" (giant-sized robot explored and rescued from the inside), ""The Phantom Family"" (a cold-hearted alien captures the family and replaces them with duplicates), and ""The Cave of the Wizards"" (where the character Dr. Smith slowly transforms into an alien and loses his sense of identity.) For fans like me, who appreciated the occasionally more serious attempts at drama and sci-fi in the 2nd season of the series, but who also enjoyed, within bounds, the humorous interaction among the characters - only certain episodes will stand out as favorites in this collection. Other episodes will seem clearly over-the-top and silly. Die-hard fans will nevertheless feel a need to have this set in their collection, along with the other seasons.

Brand new viewers to Lost in Space may find the series to be an acquired taste, but it may well be worth their time. The series has become something of a phenomenon in pop culture. Find out what ""Warning, Warning!"" is all about and follow the exchange of clever insults between the characters of Dr. Smith, Major West, and the Robot.

2138884,3,B0002XVQNK,"As a long time Lost In Space fan...it was my favorite show as a child, I had purchased every season and volume except this one.  I know the show inside and out and knew that some of the campiest episodes were on this volume.  The earlier episodes featured some the best writing, acting and directing shown on TV.  Like most LIS fans (especially over 40), I too had wished the show remained true to the science fiction/family drama roots it started with.  But for some reason, the episodes on this volume were the ones that always popped into my head when remembering how I couldn't wait to rush home after school and check out the reruns for the umpteenth time.  ""Trip Through the Robot"", and ""Revolt of the Androids""- ""Crush, Kill, Destroy!"", are the high point of these episodes, but all the rest still have charm.  If you can sit through ""The Qwesting Beast"", you are a true diehard Lost In Space fan.  As was the case with most of season 2, Dr. Smith took center stage and was at his most devious, greedy self.  Surprisingly, Penny gets more screen time on this volume and that's a good thing.  She was always the most under-utilized of the Robinson family.  Will has some good moments and the Robot is always there to bail the family out of Smith's foibles.  The rest of the cast was pretty much in and out.  I bought this, knowing exactly what I was getting and my collection is now complete and ready to show to future generations.  I've even converted my wife who never watched the show when she was growing up.  Not the best of the show, but a must for any true Lost In Space fan.",1267228800,,1589,4.397260273972603

2138889,3,B0002XVQNK,"Though I thought season two of Irwin Allen's classic series was the weakest of the show's three, I finally succumbed and purchased volume two simply because it contains some of my favorites from that year: ""The Astral Traveler,"" ""The Galaxy Gift,"" ""Trip Through the Robot,"" ""The Phantom Family,"" ""The Mechanical Men,"" and ""The Cave of the Wizards.""  Though these exhibit the same fantasy-oriented storytelling that dominated the season, they do have a better structured plot than the rest in the compilation.

Lesser episodes, but tolerable, are ""Revolt of the Androids""(featuring the return of Dee Hartford as Verda the Android and also starring future ""Land of the Giants"" star Don Matheson) and ""The Colonists,"" with a rather sexist view of the roles of men and women, something that, unfortunately, permeated all of Allen's series.

However, a waste of celluloid are ""The Questing Beast,"" ""The Toymaker,"" ""Mutiny in Space,"" ""The Space Vikings, ""Treasure of the Lost Planet"" (with Albert Salmi returning as space pirate Alonzo Tucker), and ""Rocket to Earth.""

Speaking of the actors, the six of the seven regulars tried to play what-had-obviously-turned-into-fantasy/farce as seriously as they could while the guest stars, like Jonathan Harris, decided to go over the top with their performances.  Albert Salmi, Ronald Long, Hans Conried, Walter Burke, Sean McClory, Al Lewis, and the master of ""hamminess,"" John Carradine, stole just about every scene in which they were featured.

If I had actually had to pay full price for the set, I wouldn't have spent my money; I happened to find the compilation at a much reduced price at a national retailer.

Only problem is that it's decades before they ever launched and Earthlings are paranoid about things like flying saucers and robots who shoot lightning out of their claws.  Jonathan Harris is his usual hysterical self in the guise of Dr. Zachary Smith (Oh the pain, the pain!) and Bill Mumy manages to save all of the adults once more as Will Robinson.

This is another show that I'd love to see some network ressurect like Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica...this time treating the story seriously and making the audience keenly aware of the many dangers humans might face if they were truly lost in the vastness of space without any help other than their own wits and the supplies at hand.

2138931,4,B0002XVQNK,"Season 1 of ""Lost in Space"" was presented as a single collection of eight DVDs.  Season 2 was split into two volumes.  Season 2 was originally shown in 1966-67, and though I no longer recall the contrast between ""Star Trek,"" which I watched contemporaneously with ""Lost in Space,"" and this show, the contrast had to be significant.  There are fourteen episodes on the four discs in this set, and none of them attempted any serious subject matter.  The second season disintegrated into pure camp.

In spite of the silliness of these fourteen episodes, there are some moments of fun and ingenuity.  Hans Conried makes an appearance as a night chasing a dragon in ""The Questing Beast.""  This episode is enjoyable from beginning to end, and Will (Billy Mumy) learns a valuable lesson.  ""Treasure of the Lost Planet"" offers Albert Salmi in his second appearance in this series as a pirate.  The pirates are appropriately blood-thirsty and the search for the treasure casts Dr. Smith at his worst.  The ""Trip Through the Robot"" was hokey at best, but was still a lot of fun.  I kept wondering why everything in the robot was right side up though the robot was on its back.  Sean McClory is excellent as a Scottish ghost in ""The Astral Traveller.""  In the final episode of the season, ""The Galaxy Gift,"" we get to see John Carradine, who was an outstanding character actor, as an alien.

You can count the number of science fiction television shows that left a lasting impression on viewers on your fingers.  As campy as ""Lost in Space"" sometimes was, it left an impression that is nearly as strong for many people as the impression that ""Star Trek"" left.  Of course ""Star Trek"" was a much bolder show, and tried to present some of the infinite possibilities that exist in the universe.  ""Lost in Space"" reached only a brief distance into the future and was the first non-animated television show that focused on a family of space pioneers.  There are plot holes galore.  Dr. Smith has to be one of the most obnoxious central characters in a television show ever.  And yet, I retain my fondness for this show.

I think it is easy in this age of sophisticated digital effects and a chain of quality and classic science fiction television that extends back to at least the original ""Outer Limits"" to look down on ""Lost in Space"" as unworthy of appreciation.  However, the series was influential and it was memorable.  Had Irwin Allen been allowed to maintain the serious nature of the show, it is possible that ""Lost in Space"" would have been the landmark television show that ""Star Trek"" became.  I know I watched both, and I know I enjoyed ""Star Trek"" when it came out the year following the debut of ""Lost in Space.""  I considered myself lucky that two such wonderful shows were on at the same time.

I look back on ""Lost in Space"" with fondness, and I enjoyed watching every single episode in this collection as well as those in season 1 and the first part of season 2.  I know I will enjoy the episodes in season 3.  Perhaps my fondness is all nostalgia.  If so, I will revel in my nostalgia and just maybe I will watch all the episodes one more time.

As a side note, after being a little boy and watching ""Lost in Space,"" I admired Will Robinson a lot.  I credit Will being a role model for my later years when I studied electronics and physics in college.  This show may have been campy, but I am glad that I was encouraged by a show like this one.  Perhaps we should all wish for more campy science fiction shows to encourage children to become scientists and engineers.",1151971200,4,3570,4.562893081761007

They are kind of funny, but don't make much of a story. Season three is a little better, less hokey.

If you really like the show, then you should get this volume, but the stories are certainly less complicated. It is pretty funny and can be enjoyed though, so I might recommend it, but for humor alone.",1135814400,,581,4.429906542056075
2138964,3,B0002XVQNK,"Volume 2 of Lost in Space, Season 2 features some of the strangest and worst episodes of the entire series. The series was in full fantasy / adventure mode and most of this volume showcases this. Even with that said, there is a lot to like here.

This volume opens with 4 stinkers yet in their own way, they are charming. From ""The Questing Beat"" through ""The Space Vikings"", we are treated to space fantasy at its most absurd. There is absolutely no real danger in these episodes and though they can be enjoyed for their own merit, you have to wonder how the series made it for a 3rd season.

The rest of this volume is a mixed bag but we do have some highlights. ""Rocket to Earth"" is yet another close call in getting back to Earth with the always fun Al Lewis. ""The Cave of The Wizards"" features some genuine emotion from Smith toward his feelings for the Robinsons and a teaser about a possible lift off from the planet. And two great Robot episodes, ""Trip Through the Robot"" and  ""The Mechanical Men"".

Despite some of the worst episodes of the series, Season 2 did continue to strengthen the bond between Will, Smith and the Robot, one of the best trios next to Kirk, Spock and Bones. With the aforementioned ""Cave of the Wizards"", we see that Smith was really more of a father figure to William at times more then his Dad. As a result, Judy and Maureen took a far back seat to everyone else with Penny being a distant third.

Lost in Space Season 2, Volume 2 is the weakest of the two volume set. And despite the weaker or duller stories, in the right mind, they were still a lot of run to watch. It is a worthy edition and not just for completists.",1122249600,13,1656,4.311897106109325
2138965,4,B0002XVQNK,"LOST IN SPACE began as a serious attempt at an exciting science fiction TV program. It was starting to degenerate into something quite different by the end of the first season and in the second season, the change was full blown. No longer was it a serious show. Indeed it was quite silly. ""Campy"" is the most common description.

The change in format resulted in changed characters. Dr. Smith started out as a sinister but intelligent villain but is nothing like that in the second season. In fact, he has become the star of the show. He is venal, selfish and not very smart but he is lots of fun to laugh at. Will is the other star of the show. He was always depicted as exceedingly intelligent but he seems to have a soft spot for Smith and the Robot, the third of the first tier stars. The rest of the group are little more than background characters. Penny has a few prominent roles but Judy might as well not be there. Sometimes she utters less that a dozen words in the course of an episode.

All of these stories are exceedingly silly and the ""science"" aspect is truly laughable. Pseudo scientific terms abound and are quite meaningless. All science fiction requires the suspension of disbelief but this series requires something more. It requires disbelief to be locked away safely where it has not the slightest possibility of intruding. In spite of this, the series works. It works because it does not take itself seriously. It is all done in fun and no one, even a child, could take any of it seriously. This is true in terms of story, special effects and, especially, aliens. Mostly, it is a vehicle to let Smith be a pain in the backside.

This set includes the following episodes:

The Questing Beast - a spacefaring knight in armor, complete with medieval camp, shows up looking for the questing beast. He takes Smith as a hostage and Will as his page. The basset hound wearing spectacles is a nice touch. The beast looks like a cross between a giant Muppet and Barney the dinosaur. She takes in Penny and gives lessons in elocution, manners and snobbish British etiquette. Will learns to be a cynic for a while and then everyone learns about chivalry, even Smith.

The Toymaker - another intergalactic mail order catalog is found by Will and Smith.  Dr. Smith pushes the wrong buttons and becomes part of the catalog. Naturally, Will has to do the same thing. Meanwhile, a ""fissure"" threatens to crack the planet to pieces. It turns out that Will and Smith have been transported to the realm of a cosmic toymaker who thinks they are toys. When clerks from the store try to sort things out, chaos ensues. It's a normal episode.

Mutiny In Space - Dr. Smith tries an experiment in rain making. In doing so, he destroys the weather station. He is ostracized as a result. As he wanders off in a huff, he finds a damaged spaceship captained by an admiral who acts like a vestige of the Nelsonian navy and dresses like a refugee from Wellington's army, complete with tricorne. Will and Smith get pressed into the service of the admiral who was the victim of a mutiny which saw him cast away in the first place. His treatment of his pressed hands threatens to incite another mutiny. Square rigged space ships? This is pretty screwy even for Lost in Space.

The Space Viking - Dr. Smith is gifted with the gloves and war hammer of the Norse god, Thor. For Smith, these seem like the keys to satisfying his desires of avarice. This is especially true when a Valkyrie shows up to hail him as the most powerful of all. Unfortunately for Smith, and all around him, with power comes responsibilities such as battling frost giants and the like. He also comes between Thor and his wife, Brunhilde and a fight to the death is in order. Smith gets out of this by psychoanalyzing Thor into a babbling idiot. At least that part is realistic.

Rocket to Earth - An itinerant magician happens upon the space family Robinson. The problem is that Dr. Smith is the only one who can see or hear him. This leads everyone, including Smith, to think he is going crazy. It helps that the magician is having fun making Smith go crazy. Eventually, Will and the robot figure out that the alien is real but not a very good magician. He does, however, have a space ship reputedly able to reach earth. That leads Smith to try and get a job as a magician's assistant so that he can get a ride to Earth. The technical term, I think, is ""sorcerer's apprentice"". Smith is not a very good magician either but it is not his magical skills that make him an attractive employee. It is his ""expendability"". He probably would have been expended had it not been that Will winds up on the same ship.

The Cave of the Wizards - Smith gets amnesia and that makes his mind receptive to being taken over by an alien force. Another blow to the head restores his memory but not before he utters a wish to have his own ship in the hearing of the alien machine. The result is an imperfect replica of the Jupiter II. Meanwhile, it looks like the Robinsons finally have the real Jupiter II ready for launch but there is a narrow launch window. That window is threatened when the aliens who are controlling Smith set him up as their ruler. This is another one that pushes even more than usual at credibility.

Treasures of the Lost Planet - Smith stumbles into a cave that seems to hold a pirate's treasure trove but is disappointed to find there is little of value. All he finds is a disembodied mechanical head. Meanwhile, Capt. Tucker, a space pirate from a previous episode shows up and Will has to rescue him from some other space pirates. It turns out that the head is the key to a great treasure. Gaining the treasure requires convincing the head that Smith is actually a craven, backbiting and untrustworthy pirate himself. It works.

Revolt of the Androids - Verta, an android from the celestial department store and a previous episode shows up on the Robinson's planet. She is still striving to become more human but her particular line has been discontinued. As a result, she is ordered to be disassembled. Failing to see the justice in the situation she flees and a destroyer android is sent after her. While Verta is being sheltered by the rest of the family, Smith, Will and the robot hook up with the destroyer who is having mechanical difficulties. They are unaware of Verta's presence and try to fix him up. Smith wants to use the destroyer to gain access to the cave of a monster that hoards rubies. Typical Smith avarice. The plan to save Verta involves convincing the destroyer that she is human. She does this by giving him lessons in being a human. It degenerates into a robotic love fest.

The Colonists - With as many visitors as they have, you would think that the Robinsons' marooned spaceship is located at Grand Central Station instead of some out of the way planet. In this episode, the family is trying to set up a series of communications relays when aliens destroy all of the equipment at once time. The source of the destruction is a princess from a race of women warriors and she does not like men. Furthermore, she has decided to claim the planet for colonists from her planet. The men from the Jupiter II are to provide the slave labor to make things ready. The women are to become members of the new society. Unfortunately, Penny seems to like the new regime. Smith, of course, tries to worm his way into the good wishes of the women.

Trip Through the Robot - Smith manages to push the wrong button damaging the electrical system of the ship. Unfortunately, Smith had neglected to recharge the robot for a few weeks and now recharging him could further damage the ship and put everyone in danger. To prevent danger to the Robinsons, the robot wanders off to die alone. Will and Smith follow after him to try to find a solution but are unprepared for what they find. The robot has wandered into a ""dangerous area"" and collapsed from lack of power. A strange gas causes the prone robot to grow to a huge size and that is how he is found by Will and Smith. They come up with an idea to go into the robot and ""reverse the ions"" to shrink him back to normal size. The interior of the robot turns out to be a dangerous area. I sure don't remember anything like this from engineering school.

The Phantom Family - While Dr. and Mrs. Robinson are off doing ""something else"" the family is attacked by an alien. Will happens to be out of camp at the time as well. When he gets back, he finds not his family but duplicates of his family. The alien wants Will to teach the duplicates how to be ""real people"" in exchange for getting his family back. Teaching the duplicates to be real is difficult except for the case of Dr. Smith. His duplicate is just as defective as the original and causes as much trouble. The duplicates are to be used by the alien to save his race. Since he is depending on Smith, his race is in trouble.

The Mechanical Man - A race of miniature robots that look just like THE robot kidnap Smith and demand that the robot be released from slavery. They want him to serve as their leader. The robot is torn between loyalty to his own kind and loyalty to his ""Family"". As it turns out, Smith has more of the qualities that the little robots want than the big one does so a little bit of transference is in order. Its kind of fun to see Smith sucking up to the robot but this episode is at the extreme end of the silliness spectrum.

The Astral Traveler - While trying to get out of a storm, Will and Smith duck into a cave for shelter. While there, Will finds a portal to a Scottish castle haunted by the friendly ghost of a laird executed for treason. After a brief tour, the portal reappears and will makes it back to his family. No one believes his story except for Smith who will, of course, grasp at any straw to get back to earth. In an attempt to prove the truth of his story, Will heads back to the cave and finds that the ghost has come through and is stuck on this side. He has also lost his status as a ghost and has a physical body again complete with gout. It is decided to send Smith through to arrange for a rescue party but things go wrong, as they usually do with Smith, and Will goes through as well. The ghost takes delight in tormenting Smith once he regains his ghostly properties.

The Galaxy Gift - Another alien shows up and this one is being chased by other aliens with heavy ordnance. He befriends Penny offers him refuge in the Jupiter II. That hacks off the other aliens to no end. In return for her kindness, the first alien gives Penny a special amulet. It turns out to be the item that the second group wants and trouble ensues.

The final disk has the ""Special Features"". It basically consists of a slideshow with audio interviews from Mom and Pop Robinson and Dr. Smith.",1119398400,45,10808,4.438508064516129

Sure, ""Lost in Space"" is considered by many to be ""corny"" but it is supposed to be. I have always loved this series ever since it was on prime time TV during my Junior High School days. There is also another same- era classic series from this ""Master"" that is also considered by many to be ""corny"" but, I love it equally well. ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" with Richard Basehart and David Hedison really rocks. I hope they start releasing this one very soon and do a good job with the DVDs. I know I will order it as soon as it is available. There are two other Irwin Allen series: The short-lived ""Time Tunnel"" and ""Land of the Giants.""

Are the ""sets"" kinda pathetic? Duh, of course

Campy?  To say the least.

But, there is that certain, intangible aspect that is completely gone in ANY of todays shows that can no longer be captured.

Is this for everyone? No, but for the person who can look past the flash, special effects and the ""Too serious"" attitude in today's Sci-Fi, than this IS the stuff for you.

Dr. Smith is a master comedian and alone is worth the price of admission.  I will say though that the robot is more funny than I remember.  I used to look forward to seeing pennys pretty face, but at my age Judy and Mrs Robinson seem a bit more appealing :-)

2139013,2,B0002XVQNK,"When I was ages 6-9, I remember enjoying the ease of understanding this series when presented with the alternative of Mr Spock's logic which I couldn't understand.  I loved this show.  HOWEVER,

Now I decided to revisit the series as a 46 year old with my 7 year old boy and was overcome by the lack of science (ie read ""stupidity"") in this ""science fiction"" series. It was painfuly stupid.

In just the first episode when they are leaving Earth, there were blatant gaffes such as;

1) The television commentator talking about how if the Robinson family expedition was successful, ""millions"" of familiess would follow ""every year"" from Earth;

2) After the ship gets damaged passing through a group of asteroids, the mother and father go outside the ship to try to fix the antenna when the heat from a passing comet causes the door to jam, trapping them ouside where they pass out from the intense heat. Any first grader knows that comets are COLD balls of frozed ice and dirt, and only shine as they are lit from the light of a start.  And even if the door was jammed due to heat, all they had to do was rotate the ship so that the door passed into shadow where the tempature is close to absolute zero to unjam it.

3)When June Lockhard was caught outside the ship and passed out from heat exhaustion from the comet, she collapsed down onto the platform she was standing on instead of floating upward (there is no gravity in space!!!)

I don't mind shows taking some liberties, but there has to be some integrity as well which is largely missing from this show.

Great for kids (or adults) that lack a basic knowledge of science but painful for all others.  Its back to Star Trek for John and I.",1103500800,2,1696,4.474025974025974

Dr Smith's flambouancy was at its peak and the Robot was becoming more 'human'.

My opinion is that if you were a real fan of the series when you were a kid you would not care how the series is released. I will purchase them all just to relive those childhood memories, because you can't put a price on that! That is the bottom line. All of these negative comments are sheer nonsense.

2139019,5,B0002XVQNK,"Many people need to realize that what they regard as the utter stupidity of this show is actually the entire fun of the show. One of the reasons to watch old movies and TV shows is to see the differnt ways that actors of the past used to act. What we would regard today as stupidity was not regarded as such 20 or 30 years ago. About 20 years from NOW, our children and grandchildren will be watching the movies and shows we regard today as serious and think THEY are stupid.

It is the very fact that Dr. Smith the Robot DO look ridiculous to us that is the very reason to watch the show. They are hilarious!

It is not uncommon for a series to have it's most serious episodes on season one and the lighter episodes on seasons two and three. This is a tradition that goes way back. Even orchestra symphanies follow this pattern. The first part of a symphany is very serious business. The second is a little lighter. The third part is called the ""minuette"" which is the lightest part of the symphany. Then the fourth part is the finale.

Star Trek TOS was very, VERY serious its first season. The second and third were far lighter with more comedy. That is the normal pattern of things.

The second and third seasons of Lost in Space are wonderful. I certainly hope FOX decides to release the third season",1098921600,5,1305,4.336065573770492

I'm not talking about the fact that the series is now in color( although, boy, you sure can see those paper boulders now)  I'm talking about the fact that the stories aren't quite as good and the feel is a little bit lighter.

As the year moves forward, we begin to notice less science fiction stories and more fantasy. I do not mean Lord of the Rings quality fantasy,(the understatement of the century) but rather stupid singing Vikings, space cowboys,  well. you get the picture. (Mercifully I will not say much about the rock bottom episode with Penny and the dragon, that looked like a first grade school pageant and comes into a dead tie with the infamous vegetable people episode in Season Three)

The show gets so stupid that many of the fans feel betrayed. Then, somewhere in the second half of the season it looks as if somebody at CBS got the message. The stories get better again(never as good as Season One, those days are gone) but better, with aliens that look like aliens and a usage of characters other than Dr. Smith, Will and the robot.(characters that I liked before they became too overdone and before Dr. Smith went from being an evil but eccentric villain and before the robot turned from a real robot to a creature that sings, laughs cries and make you feel embarrassed for even admitting that you watch the show.

All in all, since it started out fair and ended up with an effort to return to the original magic, I am buying Season Two. Admittedly most of my reasons are nostalgic. I would be hard pressed to call any of this quality.

But all the nostalgia in the world will not get me to buy Season Three. Although they traveled through space again on and off for the whole year and tried again to make the show science fiction, the truth is, it had gotten so stupid that the producers didn't seem to know how to get out of it.

If it is studio greed then they are not doing the best job as the list price of the two season-two sets is equal to the single first season set. They might feel that they can sell more as some people are reluctant to plunk down seventy dollars or so on a single set (aside from the die hards). I find it a bit easier to shell out 30-35 dollars for a half season as well;it helps with the wife acceptance factor. This is quite a bit different from the Star Trek releases which had a substantial price difference between individual releases and the entire set.

Instead of condemning the studio, perhaps we should offer our thanks for the release on DVD of a series that does not have as big a following as some other shows. I can't really explain why I enjoy Lost in Space. It really was a childrens show in prime time which grew increasingly ridiculous each year that it was on--but I still liked it!

8034411,5,B0002XVQNK,"This series [TV-Series 1965-1968] is formulated on the old serial cliff-hangers. The stages are cardboard and Styrofoam. The props look like anything lying around in the ware house. From the dialog you would not realize that the actors can and are acting. As the programs progress the stories get weirder to holds your attention. There are also several notable guests including Robbie the Robot that always outsmarts ""The Robot"" (Bob May) The Robot's voice is Dick Tufeld.

We all know the basic story of a saboteur Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris) is too smart for his own good and his sabotage backfires from the start throwing the spaceship into who knows where with him trapped inside. What is worse is he never learns from episode to episode. Prof. John Robinson (Guy Williams) is the good guy father that is always giving one hope of being found or getting back. Maureen Robinson (June Lockhart) is the stereotypical motherly type and is caught occasionally stopping John from beating Zackary's brains out. We have mischievous kids always wandering off to discover the new trouble. And a watered down love interest between daughter Judy (Marta Kristen) and Major Don West (Mark Goddard).

How will they survive?
What strange creature or disaster will befall them this week?
