110032,1,0790736977,1. It didn't start where Addams Family Values left off. 2. The ONLY original characters were Lurch and Thing.,928454400,4,109,4.7894736842105265
110033,1,0790736977,"This movie is have been best done left unmade. While Tim Curry and Darryl Hannah are two of my favorite actors, they don't come near being the quintissential Addamses that the late Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston  played. The writing is insipid and the plot is even more ubelievable and  moronic than the original Addam's Family movies which, at least, had the  saving grace of being just plain fun. Without Christina Ricci and the  original move Lurch, it's just another movie to try to milk the success of  the originals.  If there were a way to give it no stars, I would. It was a  direct-to-video release, and it's easy to see why, it would have been a  total flop had it been released to the theaters. I was extremely  disappointed and would have returned the movie for refund had I had that  option.",913334400,7,804,4.520833333333333
110034,5,0790736977,"Oh dear... It's a great pity to say it, but ""Addams Family Reunion"" is a major disappointment, and a sad end to what had been a very respected and maintained movie franchise.
It's a great pity, since  there were some promising elements in the mix: some interesting casting, a  passable script, and a decent budget, though I am at a loss to find any  positive signs in the final product.  The actors prove to be simply poor.  Daryl Hannah proves woefully unsuitable for the role of Morticia, looking  for all the world like a lost drag queen on a trick-or-treat jaunt.  Her  full-lips and blue eyes look dreadful with her make-up, and her  over-tweezed eyebrows make her look cross-eyed in long-shot.  She isn't  helped by the abysmal hair-styling, either.  She actually bears a strong  resemblance to the original Charles Addams cartoons, though what's cute in  a pencil sketch certainly isn't in a live action film.  Failing to exhibit  any sense of comic timing or chemistry with her co-star Curry, she seems  particularly ill-at-ease, and frequently resorts to ludicrous face-pulling  and head-jerking to gain attention.  This is the weakest Morticia we've  seen by a long stretch, and her inability to convince in the role deals  ""Addams Family Reunion"" a serious blow.
By comparison, Tim  Curry puts in a hearty performance, though he seems more interested in  chewing the scenery and being loud than portraying Gomez.  He never seems  to 'become' the character, instead appearing to be Tim Curry-playing-Gomez.  He does attempt a Hispanic accent for a couple of scenes but soon gets  bored and reverts to Tim Curry-being-loud.  Either way, though, he is  completely out of sync with the rest of the cast and soon becomes  distracting, with his badly-pitched performance ultimately annoying.  Pat  Thomas plays a manic Fester, clearly patterned after Jackie Coogan's  interpretation.  He tries hard, though is given little to do, and manages  to irritate more than he entertains.  Nicole Fugere proves wooden as  Wednesday, physically bearing a greater resemblance to the possessed Linda  Blair in ""The Exorcist"" than the established image of the Addams  child.  Lacking any semblance of innocence, the incongruity of the  character falls flat, and the same can be said for Jerry Messing's Pugsley.  For a series that has always thrived on strong ensemble casting,  ""Addams Family Reunion"" makes the basic error of presenting a  group of performers who wholly fail to ignite their scenes or mesh as a  convincing group.
The script is adequate, though lacks the bite and  wit of Paul Rudnick's work on the previous two movies.  There is some  unnecessary toilet humour, and a couple of overly predictable sequences.  It lacks the sophistication and depth of the previous films, instead  adopting a more cartoon, stunt-driven mood.  The biggest problem is that  too much of the action is analogous to past efforts.  Practically  everything seen here has been done before... and better.  Morticia and  Gomez's tango sequence, Pugsley's infatuation, Gomez's physical prowess, an  army of Arian outsiders - at best they offer some friendly deja-vu, at  worst they just remind of what a losing battle the producers of this film  are fighting.
Dave Payne's direction is workmanlike, and renders most  of the jokes flat.  The lighting fails to embellish the dull settings with  any life either.  Visually, the film lacks impact, and the sets for the  Addams mansion are particularly disappointing, occupying roughly the same  space as Ken Adam's divine backdrops for ""Addams Family Values"",  though failing to exude any of their style or beauty.  The costume designs  are low-rent copies of the wardrobes of previous movies, and the special  effects are frequently atrocious, ranging from the laughable CGI attack dog  Butcher, to the two-dimensional bolts of electricity.  One redeeming aspect  is Amotz Plessner's exemplary score, which is beautifully orchestrated, and  offers this slip-shod effort undeserved cohesion.
Fundamentally though,  nothing can disguise the fact that this is ""Addams  Family""-by-numbers; uninspired, unimpressive, and most importantly,  uninteresting in the extreme.  Go and check it out, but don't say I didn't  warn you...",912556800,2,4251,5.2391629297458895
110043,1,0790736977,dont buy this movie it sucks. no life between the actors. no way will i buy this movie its the worst i have ever seen,1400112000,,117,3.72
110044,4,0790736977,"I bought this many years ago, and I enjoy it every time I see it.

Yes, the new cast is distracting at first. And it is much sillier than the two theatrical films. Indeed, it has always looked to me like a spin-off from a TV show aimed at a younger audience than the theatrical films were. The theatrical films were much better movies, but this is, in some ways, more entertaining.

But it grows on you. By the time he steps onto the tennis court, Tim Curry /is/ Gomez. And that silliness? It grows on you too.

I, too, wish it would come out on DVD.",1385424000,,550,4.121495327102804
110045,1,0790736977,"As a long time fan of the Addams Family, both the television version and the two movies with Raoul Julia, I had hoped this one would be good.  Sorry to say, it most definitely was NOT!!  This had to be the most pathetic version I have ever had the displeasure to see, and I'm sorry I wasted money on it.  About the only saving grace it had (yes, it did have one!) was Ray Walston as the family patriarch.  Other than that, it was a bigger bomb than the one the U.S. set off at Bikini Atoll.  I am not in the habit of giving bad reviews, but this time around I was given no choice.  This one stank worse than a convention of skunks!  In short, please, don't waste your money on this one!",1329523200,5,686,4.037037037037037
110046,3,0790736977,"I always thought that one day I would buy the movie, the only problem is that I have been waiting for Addams Family Reunion to be released on DVD and so far I have met with disappointment of it steel being unavailable in any other form than VHS. I do keep on holding on to the hope that Addams Family Reunion will someday be released to DVD, then and only then will I buy the movie. I promise you when I do see it in stores on DVD that I'll say ""At long last, it has come to DVD. I getting it before it will become unavailable to be gotten at all."" Giving that to be said, I would hope that someone would seriously consider release Addams Family Reunion to DVD.",1320537600,,661,4.0534351145038165
110047,3,0790736977,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. When I took a look at the cast I expected the worst. But I believe this installment is the best of the three. I'm sure that my statement will provoke outrage. But it's true. The Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia versions were pretentious and dull. Christopher Lloyd was a nightmare as Fester, Thing should have remained in his box, Lurch was ill-defined, Christina Ricci was just dull, Cousin Itt was a whiney disaster, Pugsley was a waste of time and Anjelica Huston struck out. Only Raul Julia pulled through.

However Addams Family Reunion restored much of the hilarity from the original series. Thing was the real thing, Uncle Fester was more like Jackie Coogan and the actor made it his own. The entire cast was excellent with special mention for Kevin McCarthy and the coiffure munching dog. Wednesday was vastly superior to Christina Ricci's portrayal. This movie hit just the right note. Get rid of your prejudices and enjoy.",1287273600,2,971,4.849397590361446
110048,5,0790736977,"product came earlier than expected so i was very pleased about that. The box was in good condition and nothing was wrong with the video itself,",1277510400,,143,4.538461538461538
110049,2,0790736977,"Let me just start out by saying that I was literally raised on the Addams Family. I can recall looking through Charles Addams' Homebodies before any other cartoon book.  The original TV series was a favorite in our house.  The first 2 movies were a delightful surprise of good acting, directing and and one liners from the old Charles Addams New Yorker cartoons.

So when I saw that Tim Curry was playing Gomez in this made-for-VHS version I snapped it up; should have noted it co-starred Darrel Hanna. The same thing hit me every time she was on camera, ""Oh god, that Darrel Hanna in a back wig!"" This is undoubtedly the most unfunny movies I've ever seen.  I don't think there's one single adult laugh.  OK, maybe one.  The reason I'm giving it 2 stars as opposed to one is that it actually has merit as the most painful movie I've ever sat through and for THAT it's memorable.

I recommend it as a white elephant gift, birthday present for you annoying mother-in-law or a sure fire way to get your kids to go to bed.  ""But mom, can't we watch just one more movie!?""  ""It's a school night, but OK just one more. We'll watch Addams Family Reunion.""  ""Yawn, it IS late. Good night mom.""",1262908800,3,1186,4.423963133640553
110050,5,0790736977,"I admit that I was slightly dissapointed when I watched this movie. The fact that there were different actors and actresses took awhile to get used to, but they were better than I expected. Tim Curry was actually a very good Gomez, apart from his attempt to sound Spanish. Daryl Hannah was a wonderful Morticia, accept for the fact that the person who tweezed her eyebrows did a very bad job. Wednesday was not the same, Christina Ricci portrayed her part alot better, but she was an okay Wednesday. As for Pugsley, they over-exaggerated his weight too much. Fester was more like the original from the TV series, having a high-pitched voice, unlike the Fester in the past two movies. Lurch was the same as always, and Mama was pretty good too. Thing was still terrific.

The special effects weren't too great, but the movie was still enjoyable.

One thing I did not understand though, was the fact that the movie didn't pick up where the last one left off. What happened to Pubert?
But aside from that, the movie was very good. It was both entertaining and funny.

I enjoyed this movie, and if you are a true Addams fan and truley love the Addams Family, then you will enjoy this movie too.",1195689600,4,1190,4.5514018691588785
110051,2,0790736977,"This is one of those movies that's really hard for me to rate.  Much of what has been said in earlier reviews is accurate; the slapstick humor, almost nonexistent script, and obvious CGI really detract from the movie.  In fact, this was a pilot for the Fox Family channel's ""New Addams Family"" TV series, and that tells you most of what you need to know about this movie.

What's heartbreaking is that, as appallingly bad as this movie was, the few bright spots are REALLY bright.  Tim Curry as Gomez?  Brilliant!  Daryl Hannah as Morticia?  I had my doubts, but she really made it work.  Ray Walston as the head of the single-D Adams clan?  I like it!

The real tragedy of this movie is that, if it had been made along the same lines as the first two movies, I firmly believe it could have been a worthy successor and we might have seen more to the franchise.",1191628800,2,860,4.352201257861635
110052,4,0790736977,"Luckily, I didn't listen to them because my daughter and I found a film we truly enjoyed enough to watch several times in one week.  If you are not wedded to the previous actors playing the parts, you will find that this cast performs admirably.  I was particularly taken with the performance of Tim Curry as Gomez:  humorous, charming, and romantic--just like Gomez should be.  (I am a big fan of Tim Curry's but have not liked all of his film performances.  This one is very good.)  Addams Family is meant to be silly and enjoyable and this film is.  Loosen up and give it a go.",1118880000,12,580,4.364485981308412
110053,1,0790736977,"I thought I'd seen the worst movie EVER when I suffered through NASTY RABBIT. Ha! ADDAMS FAMILY REUNION is a total embarrassment! Obviously, none of the main characters from the first two films could be coaxed back for this disgrace. Tim Curry as Gomez? Darryl Hannah as Morticia?? C'mon! These two have certainly seen better days, but hey, no one could possibly save this toilet-boat! Dreadfully un-funny, and boring to the point of inducing suicide, AFR is hazardous to all human life! Raoul Julia and John Astin must be spinning in their graves like cyclones over this! I only hope it never sees the light of DVD! Please, if you want to recreate the effect of this movie on the brain, do it the cheap way. Just punch yourself in the temples while slamming your face with a door! You have been warned...  -- Update (2-6-10): John Astin lives! Sorry...",1110931200,4,853,4.6866666666666665
110054,3,0790736977,"It's not very, very, good.
The mistake they made was, Morticia's parents are the only ones alive. Gomez's parents are Dead. It's not a very good plot.
Tim Kully is a good Gomez, but he dosen't really Look like Gomez. Dayrl Hannah is an okay Morticia, and the Wendsday and Pugsly are bad.
Pugsly, like in the first two is fat, but not tooooooooo overweight, like this one. Wednsday, does not look like Christina Ricci as Wedsnday.
I think that they could have made a better movie.",1054339200,,479,4.517241379310345
110055,4,0790736977,"Well, the actors and actresses were different from the first two movies, but that was to be expected, considering how one was dead, and two were too old to look the part, but all in all, not a bad film at all.
I have been watching Addams-related media for quite some time, and although this film isn't much better than the others, it is certainly a far cry from being much WORSE as well.
The toughest part of this film was getting used to the new faces.  After that, the second toughest part was getting used to the poor graphics given to the killer dog, but those are just inconsistensies and budget issues that could hardly be avoided...
Thing was still a blast, Wednesday was still a lovable deadpan, Pugley was still a delinquent, etc, etc...  I found almost nothing wrong with the film except for what I mentioned above.
Now a lot of people say the plot was common.  This is only partially true.  I agree that I wouldn't be surprised to see a plot like this showcased in the classic '60s series, but there would not have been as much adventure if it had been in that series.  Not only that, there is so little FAITHFUL Addams material coming out nowadays, we should feel blessed as long as they don't become the brady bunch.  (I have been rather Addams-starved for a while.)  I don't think I can explain it better than that.
So all in all, a nice little film that doesn't tread on our memories and stays faithful to our well-established characters.  A continuation of what's already been started, and really, isn't that what every sequal ought to be?",1035763200,19,1555,4.48936170212766

110057,2,0790736977,"OK, I saw it. Made it thru pretty much. Yes I was right it did suck pretty bad. Supriseingly Hannah was pretty good. I think she tried to get to the original Morticia. While she is obviously no Angelica Huston she would have  been good if I had not seen AH first. Tim Curry totally sucked. Whats her  name who played Wednesday could not hope to shine Christina Ricchie's  boots. Fester was lame too but who could possibly live up to Christopher  Loyd ?
