3521603,3,B001D1OM6S,"Bill Wyman's final tour w/ the Stones, before they turned into a Vegas-type ""oldies"" act/carcture of themselves.  And because someone hasn't forceably removed C Leavell as the Stones' ""music director""/keyboard player is about 75% of the point of this contention.  But never mind that:  I HAVE this DVD, purchased from another source, andit certainly is not worth the money.  I know, ""your money,"" but ""caveat emptor"" and all that...",1226102400,4,432,5.217391304347826

8290957,3,B001D1OM6S,Picture is not real clear and is fuzzy at times. I could not adjust it at all though my TV picture settings.,1358899200,,108,3.9545454545454546

8290959,5,B001D1OM6S,I bought this because they perform Mixed Emotions and Rock and a Hard place live which are my favorite songs from the Steel Wheels album. I have real good picture and audio. I guess I had a really good seller. I was actually wary to order this before because of the bad reviews but I risked it because I had to see anything from the Steel Wheels tour. My copy is in excellent shape.,1319846400,,382,4.175675675675675

8290961,1,B001D1OM6S,"This product was an inferior copy made from  a video tape. the audio was terrible, the  video oversaturated, and generally a total piece of crap.  Fortunately, my credit card  was credited with a refund. BUT I don't have the product I wanted and I'm not going to take the chance on a reorder.",1255737600,2,292,4.452830188679245
