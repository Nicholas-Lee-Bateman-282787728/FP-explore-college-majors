2678244,4,B000JMKJPK,"This was a very daring movie for 1980s television.  Crenna, a reliable TV actor best known for Rambo and Hot Shots surprised a lot of people with this film about a macho cop who is raped.

The movie had it's good points and bad points. Prior to the rape the character is nothing more than Archie Bunker with a better vocabulary, blaming women for their attacks.  Granted at the time many cops felt that way, but it was too exaggerated to be believable. But kudos to the movie for showing his family and how he became this way. One night without backup he chases two suspects into Seattle's underground city.  Where he is captured and raped.  The scene though not graphic is chilling.

The movie then picks up steam as he deals with his assault and bonds with the counselor (Baxter) that he used to ridicule.

Even now the subject of male rape is taboo, but it is a real and frightening fact of life.  Movies like this though hard to watch and maintain flaws are to be commended for bringing this to light.",1387065600,,1005,4.423913043478261
2678245,4,B000JMKJPK,"Richard Crenna won a well-deserved Emmy for Best Actor for his portrayal as a detective who survives a brutal rape (at the hands of character actor M.G. Gainey, no less).  His best moment involves no dialogue.  He tries to move his injured, violated body, and you can feel his pain and humiliation in every step; he moves as if his entire spine has been fractured.  First-rate work from one of America's finest radio, TV, and film actors.  The film itself is standard-issue 1980s crime drama cheesy, but Crenna elevates it entire project with his performance.  Worth seeing.",1370995200,2,574,4.876288659793815
2678246,5,B000JMKJPK,"After a few years of fruitlessly trying to find this film, I finally won the jackpot when I found it on DVD (with the title ""Deadly Justice"") and at a decent price!!! I had read Video Movie guides and all of the reviews for this movie were very positive and encouraging. I knew that with the late, great Richard Crenna on board (truly deserving the Emmy he won for this performance, and he was the king of TV movies) this was a must-see.

For the time, this film was quite daring (with the exception of such movies as ""Deliverance"") and very realistically acted. Crenna is fantastic as the chauvinistic, inconsiderate, hardened cop who believes that sexual assault victims ""bring it on themselves"". His attitude does not serve him well when he is re-assigned to the Sex Crimes Unit in his precinct. He cracks offensive jokes after trying to remove a nude rape victim from a phone booth who is incoherent with fear. He undergoes a transformation and an attitude adjustment after he is beaten and brutally attacked by two criminal sadists. Thankfully, because this movie was made for TV in the mid-80s, we are not exposed to the graphic details of the rape, nor are any given later on in the statements that Richard Beck makes. But, truthfully, we don't need to be shown. We know what he's gone through, as he experiences everything that rape victims face - and perhaps, because he is both a straight male and a cop - even more. He realizes that people look at him differently, especially his partners and most notably, his father. His dad cannot understand why Beck didn't do more to stop the attack, and Richard realizes, after going through the denial phase, that what happened to him was not his fault, despite what people say. He flashbacks to the assault, alienates his girlfriend, and has to answer embarrassing questions (as all sexual assault victims who report the crime do), like, has he ever had homosexual relations before? His ordeal transforms him into a more aware and sensitive individual who sees that the medieval attitudes toward rape need to change. What I thought was a nice touch was his rescuing a woman from a rapist, his ex-wife and children being the most supportive of him, going over his partner's objections of identifying his attackers, and finally, speaking to the cadets in the Police Academy, spreading awareness, concern and knowledge.

It was also great to see two 80s TV moms in the same film (Meredith Birney of ""Family Ties"" and Joanna Kerns of ""Growing Pains""). Pat Hingle was great as Beck's father, and Frances Lee McCain was compassionate as Beck's ex-wife. But the biggest honors go to Crenna, for his realistic and excellent portrayal. His talent and presence is, and will continue to be greatly missed, but his impact will live on. I highly recommend this film. You may never look at sexual assault the same way again. RIP Richard.",1359504000,11,2875,4.771084337349397
2678247,3,B000JMKJPK,"This is not my favorite Richard Crenna show, but his performance is as great as always. I buy everything he ever did and am never disappointed. He manages to raise a so-so script to a better level.",1358899200,,197,4.351351351351352
2678248,5,B000JMKJPK,actually was looking for movie with Richard Crenna as he played Detective Janek.  Movie arrived in good condition and played well.,1351728000,,130,5.190476190476191
2678249,5,B000JMKJPK,"You MUST own this one. It was orignally titled (in the early 1980s) The Rape of Richard (Something). For some reason, the title was changed and this was a ground breaker for the time. This was another era was the television movie (before 500 cable channels) were very well made, even better than the theatrical films released at 15.00-20.00 today. The acting is flawless and Richard Crenna NEVER disappoints in most anything he is in. If he were alive today, he'd be on fire. Don't allow the cheapness of the title deceive you because it is much better than the cover appears.

He was one of the most hard working and frequently seen actors between the late 1960s (Wait Until Dark) to 1990s (And The Sea Will Tell). He is just unbreakable and a compelling character in this role. He makes a complete transformation of a hard-edge, reckless cop who insults victims of rape until the unthinkable happens to him. It doesn't even matter what I reveal because the experience of the story is worth the purchase. One of his very best and you will NOT (I repeat) You will NOT be disappointed. It was a very strong subject matter to be released on 1980s television. Again, a great addition to the lover of movies , particularly, if you are a Gen Xer. Order it soon and please share your take on this movie. Any Richard Crenna movie is well worth collecting!",1343779200,17,1348,4.570247933884297
2678250,4,B000JMKJPK,"I saw this moving on television when it first came out and the memory of it has stayed with me. It is a very sensitive treatment of a difficult topic. For those men who find rape funny (alas, there are still some left), this movie should prove very sobering. An emotional workout but worth it. Excellent, sensitive performance by Richard Crenna.",1320364800,8,345,4.672131147540983
2678251,2,B000JMKJPK,"The promo material of the Editorial Review puts forth an excellent premice. Jaded, unsympathetic cop is forced to 'see things from a different perspective after a brutal attack"". The basic idea was good enough to make me buy the dvd.  Too bad the movie did not follow through.
  The opening was so stereotypical that my first thought was ""Uh oh -another bad cop show"".  But it was more than that.  It was a bad cop show with a message.  And the viewer was bashed over the head with that message for the entire film.  And just in case the lack of subtlety in the script or the over acting of the traumatized hero does not drive home that message, the scriptwriter summed it all up in two sentences at the end of the film.  Which left this viewer rushing for the off button screaming ""I got it already"".
  The premise was good - the movie was not.",1195257600,5,845,4.32484076433121

I was surprise at the plot of a man being raped.
My opinion this had a good writer and kept my interest throughout the movie.",1449792000,,182,4.083333333333333
8152433,5,B000JMKJPK,"I saw this movie years ago.  I finally purchased it and it was delivered in excellent condition.  This movie is a real eye opener for men and women regarding the issue of rape.  In all of the police officer's arrogance, he never expected to experience rape.  When it happened to him, it changed his life.  He had to deal with the same attitudes that he had displayed toward women who had been raped.  It was a brutal story, but, one worth watching!",1422057600,2,448,4.402439024390244

8152437,4,B000JMKJPK,"Richard Crenna was one of the most talented, and hardest working actors for the better part of four decades in TV and feature films. From acclaimed starring roles in motion pictures such as ""The Sandpebles"", ""Wait Until Dark"", ""Marooned"" and ""The Flamingo Kid"" as well as co starring roles as the abusive husband marked for death in ""Body Heat"" or the tough as nails Army Commander Col Trautman in the first three Rambo films, Crenna could almost always be counted on to deliver a Grade A performance.  He also did his fare share of TV movies, including such early 70's fare as ""Foot Steps"" (playing an alcoholic, womanizing college football coach running out of chances to secure a top job), ""Thief"" (playing a likable but flawed single father who struggles to go straight after a jail term for theft), and his critically acclaimed performance in the classic 70s Mini Series ""Centennial"".

In the 80's and 90s Crenna forcussed more on TV than feature films, and found considerable success with projects such as ""Passions"" (playing a wealthy business man who has two wives), ""A Case Of Deadly Force"" (playing a lawyer who witnesses a case of police brutality and must decide if he will get involved or walk away), and ""The Case of The Hillside Stranglers (playing the lead detective on the real life case pursuing two of LA's most notorious serial killers), not too mention his 7 films portraying NYPD Detective Frank Janek from 1985-94, among many other projects.

While his performance in Flamingo Kid"" earned him high praise and a Golden Globe nomination, his long overdue Emmy Award finally came for ""Deadly Justice"", originally titled ""The Rape Of Richard Beck"". Even by today's standards a movies dealing with man on man rape is controversial, in 1985 it was extremely taboo.  The film however manages to focus not on the sensationalized act of violence itself (although it is portrayed on screen) but on the character development of the victim, in this case a hardened NY City Detective who lacks much sympathy for female rape victims and appears extremely worn and jaded by his job.  Crenna is convincing in the film's early stages as the ""jerk cop"", but hits his stride (and the movie hits its stride) after the assault, especially when Crenna's Beck character has to endure the humiliating investigative and interrogation process that goes with a sexual assault case.

In a lesser actor's hands the realization of what these victims go through and maturation of Beck's character, developing both a sympathy and understanding for these victims that he clearly lacked before, would have been have been lost, or at least muted. Crenna excels here, illuminating Beck's enlightenment while bringing sympathy to his character while he tries to cope with the stigma emotionally of what has happened.

There are some ""Preachy"" moments near the end, as well as the standard revenge scenario (Beck is a Cop after all, it's easier for him to find and extract revenge on his perpetrators than it would be an average citizen), but it's the middle portions of the film as Crenna's character starts to understand the real life horror assault victims face, along with the shame in dealing with his family and co workers, where this film is at it's best.

You don't have to be an 80s movies buff or Richard Crenna fan to enjoy this film, it stands on its own.  This is however a ""Must Own"" if you're a fan of Crenna's work, his Emmy Award was hard earned and much deserved.",1392336000,4,3466,4.851099830795262
