3949575,5,B002LYD2K8,"I have not yet seen the Super Hero Squad so I can't compare it to that, but this series is easily the best Marvel cartoon series that I have seen.  It is vastly superior to the first X-Men series and incalculably better than the X-MEN EVOLUTION series of a decade ago.  What I most love about the X-Men is how they have continuously managed to recreate themselves over the years, while almost always working with many of the same story arcs.  Not everything in this series was perfect -- I wasn't particularly fond of the way they resolved the Phoenix story.  But there was a certain family resemblance between the stories here and the comics.  Emma Frost playing a double game and repenting (her shifting loyalties has always been something I've loved -- though lately in the comics her loyalties haven't been shifting) while harboring feelings for Scott.  This is a constant in the series.  Logan's origins always vary a bit from one telling to another, even while the general outlines remain the same.  This series did move the storyline a bit further along than previous series, though not quite up to the current stories.  This is a pre-House of M universe, though most of the world's mutants have relocated to Genosha.  But at least we aren't back to the point where the X-Men are primarily struggling against Magneto.  And Jean is missing from most of the stories, reflecting more recent story arcs.

Over the past twenty years I've generally felt that the DC cartoon series tremendously surpassed the Marvel cartoon series, though the Marvel feature films were vastly superior to the DC feature films (mainly due to the quantity of good films -- apart from the Chris Nolan Batman films DC has been poorly represented as of late).  This is the first Marvel cartoon that I thought was the equal of the DC series.  Let's hope that this is just the beginning of more good things.

The current feature review gives this one-star and urges people not to buy it since the entire series will be collected later.  I agree that one should not get this and should put off purchasing it for that reason.  But giving this one-star is simply silly.  At the time the set collecting the first three volumes, they were the only ones available.  I am giving the series five stars while recommending that people interested in the series put off buying it until it is available in toto.

Postscript

Since writing this review I saw an episode of SUPER HERO SQUAD, fully expecting that it was going to be in the style of WOLVERINE AND THE X-MEN.  What a shock!  If the Wolverine show appeals to adults as much as children, it is virtually impossible for any adult to care for SHS.  The drawing is infantile and the style is like a parody of Japanese anime at its worse.  I can't conceive of any adult caring for that show.  The person who told me that SHS would be something I would want to see obviously was pulling my leg.  I'll have my revenge :)",1262995200,,2936,4.596153846153846
3949576,5,B002LYD2K8,"I think others have alluded to the fact that one can order the full season 1 region 1 dvds from amazon.ca (canada) at  about $40 with $10 in shipping. I'm pretty sure that you may end up paying more for this and the other single releases if you wanted the entire first season, but you definitely do not have to wait until the summer 2010 when the full season comes out in the US - just order it from Canada. There may be a few added features (audio commentary) for a US release, but this has all the episodes.

3949577,5,B002LYD2K8,This is an outstanding series.  It is much more mature and well done than the early 1990's series.  Highly recommended.,1259884800,,119,4.9
3949578,5,B002LYD2K8,"Wolverine and the X-Men is an awesome animated series. I saw the first half-dozen or so episodes and then moved to a house where I can't get my old cable provider or Dish... so our family has to watch this by DVD (not many episodes available by streaming).

Long and short is do not buy these partial season releases, they are financially a poor choice. I bought the entire first season on DVD through Amazon.ca with shipping for about $54. The DVDs work perfectly in American players.

Canada is getting this series about 6 months ahead of us, so look for season 2 from them as well, unless you like practicing patience.",1259625600,4,621,4.535714285714286
3949579,5,B002LYD2K8,"Look,i can understand why people are upset with the releases. But seriously,you have no right to complain. Just wait for the whole season to be released, but if you want, this is a good deal.",1254096000,4,191,4.485714285714286

8373340,5,B002LYD2K8,"I was pleasantly surprised by this collection.  I had never seen the show until I stumbled on it online.  I liked what I saw, even though they once again changed the Marvel mythos.  This happens all the time now so I just accept it although I long for the days when continuity was king.",1390435200,,286,4.2592592592592595

8373342,5,B002LYD2K8,"some hard core xmen fans may not prefer this series. i on the other hand love it. i like when tv shows deviate in story line from the comic books. if i wanted that, id just read them.

great show, great animation. wish there were more.",1362700800,,235,4.108695652173913
8373343,4,B002LYD2K8,"I bought this dvd for my stepson and as an intro into the world of comic book heroes that I grew up with.  He had already seen a few episodes on tv, but I wanted for him to be able to see them in order and as often as he wanted without having to wait for them to air and be recorded on dvd.  He loved the cartoon and watches them frequently.",1334620800,,341,3.7222222222222223

8373345,5,B002LYD2K8,"I've never been a huge fan of the X-men series throughout the years. I have nothing against it but I'm more of a Batman I can save the world by myself kinda of guy. However as my local Movie Gallery store went out of business last month I was able to buy most of this series for an incredibly cheap price. So I decided to give it a try. What a great purchase. From the excellent storyline to the animation,I would recommend this set to anyone. My favorite aspect of the series is the voice of Wolverine voiced by Steve Blum. For the masses who love Kevin Conroy as Batman anything that Steve Blum does is worth buying. From(Roger Smith-Big O, Mugen-Samurai Champloo,Spike-Cowboy Bebop etc)this guy has done some of the best lead characters in anime history. So cough up the coin and purchase this set. It's worth every dollar.",1282176000,,826,4.513333333333334
8373346,4,B002LYD2K8,"The X-Men comic book series has spawned two TV shows (and one pilot from the 80s which is still the MOST accurate adaptation) and four movies. Setting about making yet ANOTHER TV show and making it accessible for fans of any one of those franchises must have been a daunting task. But they actually managed to pull it off. It acts as a more colorful sequel to X-Men 2, a fractured sequel to X-Men Evolution, and sticks much closer to the character concepts of the comics than any previous incarnation (aside from Forge re-envisioned as a wacky comic-relief). Yeah, the dialog is hoaky, and the characters have a tendency to spell plot points out a little too much, but it's action packed, none-stop fun for any X-Men fan.
It's a constantly rotating cast of X-Men which ensures that everyone's favorite character appears at least once. (still haven't seen Husk yet, but my fingers remain crossed)

Yes, I got suckered into buying the half-season box set, but I'm sure they'll box the next three as well.",1275436800,,1002,4.725714285714286
8373347,5,B002LYD2K8,"I'm practicing the very difficult art of ""patience"" and am awaiting the eventual box set release of Season 1 with all 26 episodes together.

But....if you do decide to go the more expensive route of purchasing the 6 volumes seperatey, take comfort in knowing that the approximate $60.00 it will cost you to purchase them seperately bought you 9 hours and 53 minutes worth of animated X-Men goodness (although volume 6 hasn't been announced yet but when it does it should have the last 3 episodes)!

If that's worth it for you then more power to you, enjoy your purchase because waiting for the complete box set of Season 1 is just as difficult a decision to make as it is to drop that $60.00.

Now, who wants to guess how much the Season 1 complete box set will go for here on Amazon?

I say definately below $60.00!

Know what's funny, regardless that it's animation, I would rather have over 9 hours of this show than 2 hours of that silly Wolverine movie even if I do end up dropping that $60 (fingers crossed I can resist)!

Fox movies could learn a thing or two from this animated series on how to properly handle their Marvel license and not just with the X-Men!

Thanks for reading, hope this helps you make your decision.

Now c'mon Lionsgate, i'm not getting any younger.....please hurry with the Season 1 Box Set!

Oh, and did I mention that a Cap, Thor and Avengers movie are being made, i've died and went to heaven.

Edit: Screw this, i'm also going the Amazon Canadian route, I don't need no stinking commentaries....thanks for the heads up everyone.",1267315200,2,1564,4.5338078291814945
