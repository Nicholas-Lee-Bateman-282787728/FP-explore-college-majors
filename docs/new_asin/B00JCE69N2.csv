8649757,5,B00JCE69N2,"I'm getting this from the local German library, Paul Bowles was such a great writer.  Most of those interviewed seemed drunk or in a daze at the time.  Some of them are just a bit much when they claim that Paul Bowles saved Moroccan music, and Moroccan literature, or put Morocco on map, etc.  Yeah right.  Still, he was a fine writer.",1413504000,,335,4.354838709677419
8649758,5,B00JCE69N2,"""You never know when a book will change your life"".  In 1997, a young film director, Daniel Young, read Paul Bowles' novel, ""The Sheltering Sky"" and determined to meet and make a documentary about Bowles. At the point, Bowles was gravely ill in Tangier, where he had lived for over fifty years. He agreed to filmed interviews with Young; and these interviews, near the end of Bowles' life, form the heart of this 2013 documentary film ""Paul Bowles: the Cage Door is Always Open.""

Paul Bowles (1910 -- 1999) was the extreme American outsider.  Born to an upper-middle class American family, Bowles travelled to Paris as a young man and began a promising career as a composer and music critic. In 1949, Bowles left the United States and settled in Tangiers, Morocco, a wide-open city for artists and others with highly unconventional lifestyles. Bowles wrote his famous novel ""The Sheltering Sky"" upon moving to Tangiers. He remained an expatriate for the rest of his life.

Young's film offers a detailed, thoughtful, and troubling portrait of a complex person and writer. The interviews with the bedridden Bowles show the author's understanding of himself during his final years. They capture a mind still sharp and articulate. The film also includes interviews with 20 individuals who knew Bowles and his wife Jane (1917 -- 1973) well. The interviewees include famous people such as Gore Vidal, Bernardo Betolucci, William Burroughs, the poet Ruth Fainlight, John Waters, as well as less well-known people who knew the Bowles' intimately in Tangiers. The interviews are fascinating, to the point, and insightful about their subject. The documentary also includes appropriate and unusual footage of scenes important to Bowles' life, including his childhood, his years in New York, the arts that influenced him, the Sahara Desert and much more. The film score is drawn from Bowles' music, which deserves to be heard. Director Daniel Young narrates the film.

One of the scenes in the film involves a snake charmer and a black snake about to strike.  This scene could be kitsch but it its context it succeeds admirably. Bowles himself, and the commentators, have much to say about his life, work, and relationship to Jane. Bowles and Jane both were gifted.  Both were homosexuals and had strong tendencies towards violent, destructive relationships, as shown in the movie.

At one point, Young asks Bowles about the relationship between an author and his work.  ""He is not his book, and his books are not he"", Bowles replied. As to the possibly autobiographical character of his own writings, Bowles observed that with a writer, ""his work comes from inside him"" as opposed to a simplistic view of living one's work.  Bowles became a cult figure during his life, with other American authors, especially the Beats, coming to Tangiers to visit. Bowles tolerated the visits but Jane was especially put off by the Beats. Director Bernardo Bertolucci describes Bowles' ""The Sheltering Sky"" as a book ""full of poison on every page"" (his film substantially softened the book) while other interviewees describe the atmosphere of the book as ""alien but also spiritual"" and the actions of its characters as ""shocking"" and ""self-destructive"".  Photographer Roland Beaufre aptly separates Bowles from a sentimental teaching of ""peace and love"", noting the harsh, violent, lost character of his life and work.  One of the interviews quotes Jack Kerouac's description of Bowles as ""a man completely devoid of [b.s.]"".  The picture that emerges is of a harsh difficult man who had given up his American identity and found little to replace it.  Bowles tried to rely on himself, to soften ego, and to find a degree of freedom in the life he had chosen. In a scene near the end of the film, Bowles advises the viewers to learn to laugh and enjoy life and to avoid the tendency to take everything overly hard and seriously. This probably would have been good advice for Bowles himself in his younger years.

This is a hard, unsentimental film.  The director admires Bowles while trying to portray him as he was. The movie offers much to ponder, for both those familiar with Bowles' work and for those with no prior background in it.  The film will be of interest to those interested in American outsiders, including figures such as Kerouac, Charles Bukowski, Burroughs, and David Goodis.  The distributor of the film, First Run Features, kindly provided me with a review copy.
