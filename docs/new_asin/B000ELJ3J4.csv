8649126,5,B000ELJ3J4,"As an archeologist I took a keen interest in the documentary's coverage of the Bible drama, regarding Jehovah's decision to destroy the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah because of their wickedness, four of their inhabitants were to be saved: Lot, his wife, and their two daughters. The drama showed that Lot's wife did not follow instructions, and looked back, and was therefore turned into a pillar of salt.

The documentary did not touch on what happened afterwards with Lot and his two daughters, the Bible reveals that they fled to a cave overlooking the salt pans at the south end of the Dead Sea. And it was here, according to the Hebrew Scriptures  (Genesis 18) that the two daughters, overly concerned that they were not able to venture out and find husbands, decided instead to get their father drunk and seduce him, thereby producing the ancestors of the Moabites and the Ammonites. In the 6th century AD, Lot's cave was evidently rediscovered, and a monastery was built around it. The excavations were directed by Dino Politis, with support from the British Museum, the Jordanian and Greek governments, and private sources.

Overall I enjoyed the documentary as an excellent resource tool if anything, I would however probably go to a Jehovah's Witness convention for the experience, whether the Witnesses could influence me to join their group remains to be seen.",1144800000,3,1371,4.978165938864628
8649127,4,B000ELJ3J4,"This documentary opened my eyes to the vision of Jehovah's Witnesses. Here they tell their own story as to who they are and why they go door to door with their Bible message. You get the feeling that they are very sincere and motivated in their ministry. This documentary makes their huge assemblies of tens of thousands look purposeful. I particularly like the comments from the missionaries, those who dedicate their lives to serve in distant lands. During that segment where the Jehovah's Witness missionaries were sharing their favorite scriptures with the moderator, one missionary said that ""Jesus died so we could live for others"" I thought that was touching. Although I have never attended a Watchtower Convention, I might consider attending if I was invited by a friend or relative. Again, I would recommend this documentary to anyone that would like to see Jehovah's Witnesses in their own light.",1143158400,4,906,5.046666666666667
8649128,4,B000ELJ3J4,"Although I am not a follower, this documentary (filmed at Dodgers Stadium during a summer convention) allows this religious group (made up of millions globally) to speak out calmly about their purpose and mission as worldwide evangelizers. The crowds, the plays, the mass baptisms the missionaries, as well as the spokespersons Charles Sinutko and Danny Bowles testify to a time tested and sound faith. This documentary appears to be pro Jehovah's Witness, you can at least see why they believe the way that they do. These people are very articulate. My understanding is that video was re released in 2003, and not on DVD.",1140048000,2,622,4.990384615384615
