7689040,5,B01CRIWR4O,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

This review will discuss one of the wildest and weirdest films Ive ever seen:  BUNNY THE KILLER THING.  The title alone is enough to entice curious viewers, and it certainly caught my eye.  But the actual movie itself is beyond description, a mesmerizing, stomach-churning, and gut-busting foray into hilarity and horror.  And I loved every minute of it.  If you are easily offended, stop reading right now, and move on to something else.  But if you can stand gratuitous rabbit/human nudity, then you're in for a real show.  BUNNY THE KILLER THING is a riotous venture into the absurd.

I don't even know where to begin with this oneand thats a good thing!  The film is crazy beyond measure, and its chocked full of humor and terrifying imagery.

BUNNY THE KILLER THING is shot well and looks great onscreen.  It is a Finnish film, therefore some of the language is a bit difficult to make out (they speak English most of the time), but the dialogue is crisp and understandable for the most part.

The special effects are very good.  Granted, some of them are tongue-in-cheek, specifically Bunnys facial features (which sorta shows the lower half of a humans face), but I believe they are meant to elicit that response.  Theres quite a bit of gore in the film, which looks excellent all the way around.  But most prominent is Bunnys, er, member.  It looks horrifically real, but hilarious at the same time.  I cringed and laughed most of the way through the second half of the film.

The plot of BUNNY THE KILLER THING is your basic monster-experiment-gets-loose-and-terrorizes-everybody concept.  But have no fear; Bunny isn't your typical monster, therefore the mayhem he causes is not typical either.  The resulting chaos is both intense and entertaining.

BUNNY THE KILLER THING is a big win for me, and I recommend it to anyone looking for zaniness with their horror.  But be warned once again:  if you have delicate sensibilities, I would definitely steer clear of this one.  Otherwise, grab a group of friends and buckle up for a bizarre trip.  The film is available now.",1467331200,,2152,4.779891304347826

7689044,5,B01CRIWR4O,"Like the other reviewer says it's a good, although I would say great Dark Humor/Horror flick.
The fact that it is in Finnish, shouldn't stop any self respecting horror fan from purchasing this film as it does
contain English subtitles. One of the most original films in years, the Bunny Man alone, is worth the price!",1460246400,,317,4.678571428571429
7689045,1,B01CRIWR4O,"I have zero problem with a movie with subtitles but the simple fact is half of the movies dialogue is in Finnish and the only subtitles available are English for the deaf and hearing impaired. I can't stress that enough. For example: if you buy an action movie and the Russians are the bad guys and they are speaking Russian  you will see subtitles when they are talking but when the English speaking actors are talking you will not see any subtitles and that's how a film released in our region should be.
This movie is good but the descriptive subtitles [door slams] [dramatic music starts to play] get very annoying because these are the only subtitles you have access too. When the actors are speaking in English there are subtitles, when they are speaking in Finnish they are subtitles, when someone farts or a toilet flushes it will say [toiley flushes in next room].
One of my favorite films of all time is Let the Right one in and yes that has subtitles but they are just normal English subtitles. They are not ""for deaf and hearing impaired"".
This blu ray release is not how you want to watch the movie. Trust me. I hope the release on VOD corrects this issue.",1460246400,5,1169,4.488262910798122
7689046,1,B01CRIWR4O,"The plot was absurd, the comedy not funny. Penis gags appeal to the low-brow. Why did some of the Finns speak in alternating languages with each other? The dark humor here did not work. The characters were all unlikeable. The closing credits death metal should provide a clue as to the intended audience. I believe the writer/director made the film for himself. The only thing this film had going for it was some nice cinematography. 1/2* is more accurate.",1487721600,,456,4.784810126582278

7689056,1,B01CRIWR4O,"bad bad bad, too much rape and no social commentary; fails at being a dark comedy because it is utterly absurb and not in a good way.  an offense to the senses",1478304000,,159,3.96875
7689057,3,B01CRIWR4O,"A scientist experiments on a captured human and turns him into a man with a bad rabbit costume with a long fake appendage that needs constant satisfying as he runs around yelling something that sounds guttural like Russy. There is a group of people in a cabin, most of which we don't know that well and can die. The production does set up the final girl in what can be described as a campy gore-fest with a cult following.

Clearly this film isn't for everyone. The humor is overly adolescent if not stupid, but that is by design as it makes fun of horror slashers which are adolescent if not stupid. If you can laugh at a man in a rabbit costume sticking his appendage into a bloody eye socket while yelling ""Russy!"" this is your kind of film...sorry for that plot spoiler.

The film is about 75% English and the rest in Finnish.

If you are the type that enjoys Evil Dead, Troll, Dead Snow, Leprechaun, Bad Taste, or Reanimator, this movie is right up your alley.

Be warned, this movie is like one long dick joke, with tons of gore, dark humor, nudity, and frankly it's downright perverse. Probably not the best to watch with little Johnny or Grandma.",1475539200,2,550,4.65979381443299

8753981,1,B01CRIWR4O,"I like odd movies. I like cult movies. I like movies with unusual monsters. I like foreign films. I don't mind subtitles. You'd think I'd be the ideal viewer for ""Bunny The Killer Thing"", a Finnish film from director Joonas Makkonen. I sure thought I would be.

I have never been so wrong about a movie in my life.

I will start out with two pieces of praise: some of the cinematography is very nice (though the effects are awful), and the concept of the bunny creature is very original. I really was looking forward to seeing it, but about ten minutes in I realized it was going to be drudgery at best. In essence, two disparate groups of people end up in a cabin in the middle of nowhere in a Finnish winter. An annoyance is the constant swapping of dialogue from Finnish to heavily accented English with inadequate subtitles. (Not that subtitles would have made me like it any more.) Before we can figure out what the criminal element in the group is up to the attacks start. It quickly develops that the rabbit monster has rather adult needs and also enjoys frequent, gruesome, and very fake violence. The gore is not scary, but it is annoying. Why? Because it's a one trick pony. Once you've seen the first attack, you can basically fast forward to the last five minutes, because the mayhem is extremely repetitive and quickly becomes boring, which is the one trait a horror movie should never, ever have.

I obviously had no idea what I was getting into with this one, but the ""humor"" is extremely juvenile at best and is far from the clever film I expected from such an outrageous premise. Ultimately after a kidnapped girl is rescued from a car trunk, she finds a way to stop the evil Lepus and definitely has a cure for rabbit overpopulation. The rabbit man's death scene is one of the most...unusual...I have ever seen, but because the filmmakers want to get a little more gross out footage in front of you (watch for the scene that brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ""an eye for an eye""), the three survivors are taken to the mad scientist's rabbit transmogrification hut, where unspeakable nastiness erupts and the film grinds to a close. The one thing I liked from the conclusion was that they saved the actual lab rabbit and protected him from harm.

This film is pointlessly crude and extremely repetitive. At least the girls are cute, but the storyline is challenging to follow given the odd language choices made, and not interesting enough to care. There are a couple of minor extras on the DVD, but I found them tedious as well. To say I didn't like this movie is a huge understatement, and that's too bad because I really wanted to.",1510617600,4,2658,4.542797494780793
8753982,5,B01CRIWR4O,"Bunny is like a hybrid lovechild of the legendary Troma (Toxic Avenger and Poultrigiest) films and the early career of Peter Jackson (we're talking Bad Taste and Dead Alive here folks). Obviously intending to be way over the freaking top it starts off with some mysterious assailents capturing a man and injecting him with a serum that turns him into a hulking rabbit mutant with an enormous wang and an insatiable hunger for pussy (which he constantly bellows). From that point we are introduced to the cast of characters to be menaced. I found the majority of them while thinly written to be rather likable and even relatable at times.

The movie moves at a pretty brisk pace and I found it to be humurous with plenty of gore to satisfy the needs of the horror enthusiast. There are also a couple of rather suprisingly dark subplots going on in an otherwise dumbly fun comedy horror. This won't be for everyone Im sure so I'd recommend watching the trailer on Youtube first to see if its for you. Trust me, if the trailer doesnt scare you away with its penis cam then you'll be fine watching this movie.",1507852800,2,1105,4.58080808080808
8753983,5,B01CRIWR4O,"Outrageous, over the top, crazy, stupid, and funny as all get out.  If you enjoy over the top flicks, this is a great Halloween movie night film.  If you laughed through Dead Alive back in 1981, then this will not let you down.",1507420800,,227,4.255813953488372
