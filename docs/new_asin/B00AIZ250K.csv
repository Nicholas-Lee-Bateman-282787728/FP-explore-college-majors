5438928,5,B00AIZ250K,"I also have ""Muscle Definition"" which I really like, but I even  like this DVD more. It is perfect for my level of being new to ST, although any level could use it by using heavier weights. The DVD also has a cardio workout which is very good. I especially like Kelly Coffey Meyer's presentation. She has a friendly directness that makes me want to work hard, but she doesn't chatter a lot. The DVD includes many variations and combinations so you can choose your workout.",1366156800,6,472,4.488372093023256
8552335,5,B00AIZ250K,I'm afraid of being a professional beginner. I don't know how many times I've started exercise just to lose momentum. I really think Kelly Coffey-Meyer is going to be a key ingredient to my success this time. I'm so glad I found this.,1502668800,2,234,4.465116279069767
8552336,4,B00AIZ250K,Great exercise video.  I like Kelly's delivery.  Not too chatty. That drives me crazy.  And who can't fit 1/2 hr. of exercise into the day. Great way to get up and move.,1501459200,,169,4.21875
8552337,3,B00AIZ250K,Not exactly what I expected.  A little too easy,1472083200,2,47,4.222222222222222
8552338,5,B00AIZ250K,"I was looking for a workout that would help me climb back into fitness again after being sidelined for 3 months after an ankle injury. This workout was perfect...challenging  but doable, and as I get stronger It's easy to make it more intense. Kelly's style is engaging and motivational, and she really pays attention to technique. You get 2 different workouts, cardiovascular and sculpting, and then the premixes so you don't get bored. I'm hooked!",1465344000,4,449,4.986666666666666
8552339,5,B00AIZ250K,"what can I say  Love KElly's dvds ..... and even this one.....  I thought it  would still  be too easy but after cancer treatment and 6 months of sedentary lifestyle it was perfect, I had been very active and pretty fit prior to the cancer diagnosis.",1454976000,5,250,4.369565217391305
8552340,4,B00AIZ250K,"Good instruction. Cadio portion will make you sweat!
The second work out is strength, you can add more weight to make it more difficult. I didn't care for some of the abdominal exercises but overall great workout.",1445299200,,213,4.783783783783784
8552341,5,B00AIZ250K,"This review is for all those people who are obese and who are looking for a strength workout that they can actually do.  I have not tried any of the premixes on this or the cardio workout, but every one of the moves with the exception of the Superwoman at the very end can be done as is or modified to allow for a gradual building of strength.  For about 25 minutes, the upper body exercises are alternated with lower body ones for a really great program.  I'm probably a beginner level, and this was a seriously good workout with a couple of alterations.",1409270400,7,555,4.3173076923076925
8552342,5,B00AIZ250K,"Great blend of moves.  More challenging than you might think.  I exercise every day and was looking for something low-key to counter-balance my more intense workouts (including a few others of Kelly's.)  This is actually a very thorough, mid-level cardio and strength workout that you can intensify according to your preferences and abilities.  Plus, I really like Kelly's delivery.  No screeching or giggling here, thankfully.  Just minimal, straightforward instruction delivered in a friendly, encouraging manner.",1396310400,6,515,5.8
8552343,5,B00AIZ250K,My desire to exercise has really diminished since turning 50. This workout is perfect for me. The moves are gentle and easy to follow but my muscles are mildly sore the next day so I know it's effective. Love it!,1374105600,6,212,4.325
8552344,5,B00AIZ250K,"I've seen clips of her workouts before and although I liked what I saw, I knew my 53 year old body would be screaming afterwards. This is a great alternative to her higher impact workouts.",1368316800,5,188,4.4
