8632506,4,B00HFQJRYM,"I gave this review one less star because there's a small portion of the film where the footage was lost and they've substituted a score for those small areas. Otherwise, the sound and clarity are as good as you'll get them, especially considering this was filmed in 1972. I'd recommend it.",1401148800,,289,4.686274509803922
