8564127,3,B00B8H1SU0,"This film was absolutely necessary.  However, this National Geographic film left out a lot of information.  Better is the film by Charles Guggenheim for PBS years earlier.  It was made shortly before Mr. Guggenheim died.  He was a member of the company that was sent from Bad Orb, just outside of Frankfurt, Germany (their main POW camp), and although he wasn't with them, as he explains in the film.  The name of his film is ""Berga am Elster"" (Berga on the Elster River).  He was able to interview many of the survivors in the 1990s.  Only a couple of these men were still alive when the National Geographic film was made.
There are also several books available about the event, and by some survivors.  Their accounts are terrifying.  It is hard to believe that our American G I s were subjected to such treatment.  And to be totally abandoned by the US Government until most of them were gone is something that we should be revolting against.",1518912000,,944,4.598802395209581

8564132,5,B00B8H1SU0,This one brought me to tears.  And to further discover that they were forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement is mind-blowing.  I am so glad that Tony came forth and this piece of history is told to honor our troops who were tortured there.  I had no idea.  There really are no words for this documentary.  It is very intense and painful to watch.,1407542400,2,349,4.390625
8564133,4,B00B8H1SU0,"Acevedo's story is one that was never supposed to be told. ""We had to sign an affidavit ... [saying] we never went through what we went through. We weren't supposed to say a word,"" he says.

The U.S. Army Center of Military History provided CNN a copy of the document signed by soldiers at the camp before they were sent back home. ""You must be particularly on your guard with persons representing the press,"" it says. ""You must give no account of your experience in books, newspapers, periodicals, or in broadcasts or in lectures.""

The document ends with: ""I understand that disclosure to anyone else will make me liable to disciplinary action."" Video Watch diary of a POW at slave camp 

The information was kept secret ""to protect escape and evasion techniques and the names of personnel who helped POW escapees,"" said Frank Shirer, the chief archivist at the U.S. Army Center for Military History.

Acevedo sees it differently. For a soldier who survived one of the worst atrocities of mankind, the military's reaction is still painful to accept. ""My stomach turned to acid, and the government didn't care. They didn't give a hullabaloo.""",1385856000,4,1143,4.871134020618556
