5663303,3,B00BP5FHVQ,"A film about fake raids that take place in India in 1987. I recognise two of the actors as I'd watched their earlier films, Anupham Kher, Akshay Kumar. Mohra is a film that I recommend. Camera shots, cinematography, editing style are interesting. Akshay kumar looks good. It's been years since I'd watched a hindi film. There is suspense and humour throughout. Has the musical numbers. Subtitles in english and arabic. Released in 2013. Cert PG.",1403740800,,445,4.946666666666666

5663309,4,B00BP5FHVQ,"More or less based on true events, SPECIAL 26 tells of a rash of fake raids conducted by an audacious band of thieves passing itself off as CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) agents or Income Tax inspectors across the breadth of India back in the mid-1980s. That these con jobs went unreported is indicative of the mastermind's acuity in selecting his victims, most of whom were shady businessmen or politicians whose loss of ill-gotten gains wasn't near as detrimental as the resulting negative publicity would've been should they had brought in the proper authorities. These thieves never resorted to flashing guns. Instead they wielded a tool that was even more intimidating, that of governmental authority.

When asked how many such raids had been executed, one accomplice reluctantly admits to half a century. So, given that sheer number and that, it turns out, thirteen such cases had been detected in the past two years, perhaps it's inevitable that, at some point, the real CBI would catch wind of this. In comes Manoj Bajpayee, an actor of slight build but of supremely coiled intensity. He plays CBI officer Waseem Khan, assigned to catch the elusive crooks. His introductory sequence - in which he gives chase to and nabs a fleeing suspect - immediately conveys to the viewer his fierceness and doggedness. Ajay Vardhan (Akshay Kumar), the quiet mastermind, had once boasted: ""There's no one in this world who can catch me."" I dunno, brother. CBI officer Waseem Khan is an unrelenting pit bull. Cue the taut cat-and-mouse.

Special 26 refers to a key element in Ajay Vardhan's plotting of the crew's last Big Job. As such, he submits an ad in the paper recruiting potential CBI agents, the final tally of which is 26. At this stage, you and I naturally anticipate an ounce of misdirection. But you should know that ""Special 26"" is later revealed to be something else.

It's a smart, very watchable period heist movie, with a narrative that gradually escalates in urgency and a convincing evocation of India a quarter of a century ago. The sets and the art direction lend authenticity to the look of 1987, a time before cell phones and Facebook and when the streets were festooned with old school vehicles like the Contessa and Fiats and Matador Vans. An assumption is that ""Jai Hind"" - a salutation roughly meaning ""Hail India"" or ""Victory to India"" or ""Long live India"" that the characters often used as a greeting - was also a fixture of the time.

The film rides on the cast's very sharp performances. Watching this one, the towering impression (for me, anyway) is that, when stripped of the buffoonery and the comic playboy persona that've colored his recent screen performances, Akshay Kumar still brings it in a dramatic role. This is a gratifying revelation, especially after the horribleness of, say, Tees Maar Khan and Action Replayy (sorry, Aish). Here, Akshay gets to play with a character who is mostly internalized, and he shows marvelous restraint and an appealing worldweariness. There's a stillness about him that suggests that formidable resources are in motion. If you're even a casual viewer of Bollywood cinema you would've seen Anupam Kher by now. There's probably a running contest between him and fellow ubiquitous character actor, Boman Irani, to see who could score the most supporting roles. Anupam Kher is superb as Sharmaji, Ajay's older associate. Kher effortlessly flits from one emotional extreme to another, one moment playing the self-assured con man who doesn't shy from slapping around someone he's bamboozling, the next moment a cowering old man fearful of going to prison. Jimmy Shergill is solid in a bit part as a shamed constable tricked by Ajay's crew and now longing to settle the score.

SPECIAL 26 comes with the option for English sub-titles and has a running time of 137 minutes. One could've edited that down to a lean and more absorbing 100 minutes or so were the filmmakers inclined to discard the romantic sub-plot, which is labored and unnecessary. I guess it's intended to add texture to Akshay's character. But it stalls and disrupts the pace. Still, this is an effective thriller. I love that the driving retro score deliberately channels the soundtrack from heist pictures of the '70s and '80s. There's also an infusion of humor and dialogue that occasionally bites and suspense that rivets and, most crucially, an Akshay Kumar that sidesteps the goofy. I only wish he and Manoj Bajpayee had more scenes together. The little we do get is compelling stuff.
