3046807,5,B00104XYHQ,"Do you entertain guests at your house with your entertainment room?

If you have a big screen, and I mean a big screen like 60+ inches or a projector, this is mandatory. The run time is about an hour. Not a whole lot of dialog. But my gosh, it will blow you & your guests away! The fly-over at such close range to the objects in focus is nothing less than mind blowing with the hi-def 1080 resolution.

This is a excellent choice as an additional bill for an entertaining evening double feature. No matter how old or young your guests. It's not to long, visually mesmerizing, and because the dialog is selective and limited it allows your guests to chat and ""ooh & ahh"" about how spectacular, pristine, and almost dizzying the experience is. When people watch this on a projector system, they won't shut up. Seriously. They will be riveted and add their own dialog to the spectacular experience you're putting your guests through.

Again...this is my #1 feature to play for an evening double-bill movie night with guests. #1! My repeat guests always want to see it again and again.

Buy this. You won't be sorry.",1363219200,,1112,4.57286432160804

  I found myself almost sleeping two or three times (positive, flattered) as the serene video eased your mind!
The camera possibly taken up to film wasn't meant to be for BRD as it filmed many years ago and think they did a wonderful job! the films clarity is GREAT and would be considered HI-DEF as i see its quality.

3046819,1,B00104XYHQ,"I got this in a set of videos, (the 'Over' series) and this is one of the worst pieces of junk I have ever seen.  Let me explain.  I was expecting, not necesarily a wildlife video, but at least some beautiful shots of natural wonders of which this country has many (some may be surprised to know that, especially after seeing this video).  The first 30 to 40 minutes is nothing but city shots, New York, Chicago, etc.  Why anyone would want to see this is beyond me.  America has some of the ugliest cities in the world.  Taken into acount all the beautiful natural wonders they have forgone in order to show us this crap, it is beyond comprehension.  Yes toward the end they show some shots of the Grand Canyon (over done!), but over all it was crap.  I threw it in the trash where it belongs.",1264204800,4,794,4.281879194630872
3046820,3,B00104XYHQ,"If you're looking for something to show off your new HDTV and Blu-Ray player, this MIGHT be of interest.

The footage is ""old"" - at least from before the World Trade Center was attacked in 2001.  The photography is generally beautiful, as is the music track.  Image quality is quite good, especially considering that this is early HD footage.  No matter what I do, the image is slightly dropped down from the top on my Samsung 46"" LCD.

-------
What's wrong with this video?

The narrative is inane and often wrong.
Examples:  Over Philadelphia, the narrator says the rowers (in racing sculls) share THE river with tugboats and barges.  In fact, in Philadelphia is between 2 rivers.  The scullers are only on the smaller Schuylkill River (which the video misspells) and the big industrial river where the tugs, freighters and tankers run is the Delaware River.  There is no ""river sharing"" going on.

Other annoying narration goes way overboard in attempting to be politically correct and historically wrong.

There's a lot of misinformation on this audio track.

If you laugh off the stupid narration and just watch the pretty pictures go by, for $9. it's a nice demo piece for your new HDTV.",1260835200,22,1193,4.817733990147783
3046821,4,B00104XYHQ,"I've seen several of these ""armchair tourism"" Blu-rays now (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Living-Landscapes-HD-Hawaii-Blu-ray/dp/B000PTYK7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Living Landscapes HD Hawaii [Blu-ray</a>]). Most are little more than screensavers, so I had low expectations for Over America. Unlike some of the other reviewers, based on previous experience with such titles, I wasn't expecting a history lesson, comprehensive survey of American geography or cities, or a documentary of important American places. I took the title at face value and simply wanted to enjoy seeing America in a way that I knew I would probably never be able to -- short of spending my life savings. On that point, Over America delivers and is pleasantly good. There are some aerial fantastic shots that I would never be able to otherwise experience.

You can think of it as a glorified 55-minute sampler of American life, narrated by Tom Skerritt. The video moves from east to west, starting in NYC, going to PA, then DC, Chicago, moving across the heartland, out to CA, then ending in Alaska and Hawaii. There are maybe 15-20 cities/regions profiled. The music selection can seem a bit cliche and dated. I heard cool jazz on at least 3 cities (Chicago, LA, and NY, with the requisite ""New York, New York""). I suppose it's appropriate for the region portrayed, as Texas has honky tonk and New Mexico has Spanish guitar. Other parts have more mellow orchestrated music, or simply pianos. The narration isn't particularly exciting or informative though, sounding a bit like a tourist bureau infomercial or a pre-recorded guided tour like you might find in a government visitor information center like the Smithsonian or Ellis Island.

Video quality is inconsistent, with some very good shots of golden canyons and verdant cropfields and some bad hazy shots, especially during low light situations like early morning, and many instances of lens flare and a strange moiring effect from buildings windows, crops, and crowds. New York, for example, has a sort of dreary look to the daytime shots and the autumn foliage of Central Park looks rather dull. Night scenes are most problematic, with severe grain and noise in many shots. On the upside, I really loved the flyovers of the American Heartland and the endless expanses of farmland as well as the canyons.

At the current low price, this is a pretty good bargain if you just want eye candy. All the places shown are subtitled with the name of the location so you can google them later or research further. I think the price is right, and I give it credit for that. This disc is probably best for people who don't have the budget, time, or inclination to travel across this huge country, or to introduce people to the majesty of some of America's places. It's good for footage shot 20 years ago, but not a great example of the Blu-ray format.",1260748800,2,2924,5.1257861635220126

3046823,4,B00104XYHQ,It's beautifully filmed and great music. I guess my only real complaint is its less than 60 mins long. It does not have alot of narrative but the scenery speaks for its self .,1243641600,,175,4.176470588235294
3046824,2,B00104XYHQ,"Why not?  Well, it's beautifully filmed and a great advertisement for blu-ray, but too short for the money and not that engaging throughout despite some magnificent shots.",1240963200,6,171,5.333333333333333
3046825,2,B00104XYHQ,"Several things about this BD annoyed me, starting right with the packaging... there is a cardboard slipcover over the standard Blu-Ray case, yet the case itself has no insert, artwork or info whatsoever - it's just a clear blue case with the disc showing thru.  So, you basically are forced to store the case in its slipcover if you want a presentable product that looks like your other titles.  A minor complaint perhaps, but why do things this way?  (I cut up the cardboard sleeve and made my own case insert.  Ha!)

The videography itself is clear as a bell - no complaints there, as this is probably the best feature of the disc.  However, the places visited (eight of them: New York, Midatlantic, Midwest, Texas, Southwest, California, Alaska and Hawaii) are visited far too  briefly.  It all feels like an empty sandwich: just a taste, but no meat.  For example, they visit Washington, D.C. but don't even show the Capitol OR the White House!  Some of the landmarks shown are labeled, others are not.  The narration by actor Tom Skerritt, who has a fine voice for this, is poorly written.  It isn't very informative, is rather sparsely and inconsistently sprinkled, and doesn't really add anything to the experience.  Add to this the cheesy music, and it's more of a distraction than an enhancement.

My advice:  This is probably best as a rental, with the sound off.  I don't know that I'd want to watch it more than once.",1240617600,5,1429,4.678714859437751
3046826,1,B00104XYHQ,I was expecting a better quality video. Instead I got a video that lacked good quality photography and also not real Blu-ray feeling when I watched it. Its not worth spending money on this.,1240531200,5,189,4.588235294117647
3046827,1,B00104XYHQ,"There was some great shots on the dvd, but the gave very little info about the places they shot and it is by no means a comprehensive guide. I would not recommend.",1238112000,3,163,4.125
3046828,1,B00104XYHQ,"The Over America concept is a great one for HD, but this blu-ray fails to deliver as its cons outweigh its pros.

On the plus side:
- the footage is quite remarkable considering it was shot in 1994/1995.  Not being a videophile or an HD historian, I didn't even know that HD technology was available back then.

On the negative side:
- It is less than 60 mins long (amazon claims 88 mins)
- In the < 60 minutes available, there is only time to pick and choose a few areas of the country to be covered.  Broad swaths of the country are ignored, including New England (except NYC), the South/Southeast, the Great Lakes (except for incidental Chicago shots), the Plains, the Rockies, and the Pacific Northwest
- Scant narration provides little information and when it does happen, it often feels like empty propaganda (is Tom Skerrit the Iraqi Information Minister for Texas?)
- Scant on-screen labels may often leave you wondering what you are looking at
- And, finally, even though relatively much time is dedicated to Chicago, we don't see Wrigley Field!?

Overall, cannot recommend this DVD",1234137600,14,1091,4.751322751322752
3046849,5,B00104XYHQ,"I saw this in Hi-Def and I thought it was absolutely amazing. Nothing like being 10 feet from the Empire State Building (the top of it) to make your stomach drop to your knees. Tom Skerritt did an amazing job narrarating this film abd I would love for this to be done with more of the country included (not much of the southeast included at all really). Highly recommended though, watch it if you can, it will make you want to travel.",1234051200,,434,4.304878048780488

3046851,5,B00104XYHQ,"I can not understand the negative reviews about the quality of this video. It is superb. Very detailed and rich colors. It's better than the HD I get from my cable box but not quite as good as a recent shot in 1080P movie. For those that say its not clear or looks high def I can only think they got a bad copy (highly unlikely) or a bad connection or TV/player. Very much worth the money. The content overall is good. Lacking the southern portion but for the most part they hit most geographic locations. NY is my favorite, seeing the trade center in all their glory. The music is nice and the narration is good as well. In my opinion definately 5 stars.",1232755200,,655,4.248

As far as the content goes, it is less than inspiring and does not do justice to many of the places covered, but then there aren't that many places covered.

3046858,4,B00104XYHQ,"I bought this title for Two reasons. First I wanted an inexpensive disc to
try out the new Blu-Ray disc players with. Second I remember seeing this
program on PBS. I also remember thinking it was a wonderful experiment in
High Definition. As I looked at it in the store, I saw just how good this
disc looks, all right it is not the latest version of HD, but it looks and
sounds pretty darn good! As a first disc I am pleased with it and look forward to collecting many more movies and shows and music on this new
Blu-Ray format. I hope the industry will manage to do a better job supporting it, than they have many other ones. This does not need to end up being a specialized niched product. It is a worthy successor to DVD and CD and Laser Disc. Tom Skerrit's narration is spot on and gives a comfortable feel to the whole thing highly recommended as a good disc to show off your disc player and system to your family and friends.

3046869,1,B00104XYHQ,"Unfortunately, they completely missed the mark. I am from Chicago, and I was eager to see their interpretation of the city. Most people who do not know the city, travel guides and tour shows call us the ""Second City"" and a ""small unimportant version of New York"". This dvd plays right into that. Not only do they only show downtown, except for a clip of a museum, but they show suburbs as part of the city. Then to top it off, they show the John Hancock building and label it the Sears Tower. The tallest office building in the world, formally the tallest building in the world, is not even recognized.

Now I'm not just biased for Chicago, the whole state of California was dwindled down to basically L.A. and a few parting shots of greenery and even New York was only recognized for Manhattan.

This dvd was a terrible representation of America.",1219449600,5,847,4.529411764705882

3046872,5,B00104XYHQ,"This Blu-Ray disc although not 100% 1080p, is an outstanding production. I saw the 1 star rating in here and had to comment. What a waste of web space and also of people's time! Although this title was mostly shot pre 2000's, the 1080i clarity is awesome. I loved it! The scenes shot in the southwest of Las Vegas and Arizona are absolutely phenomenal but there are others that are quite good as well. I felt like I was actually sitting in a helicopter flying over the Grand Canyon and Monument Valley! Swear to it =) After a stressful or tense day, this title along with the soft music can almost transport you to another dimension. I do have to agree with a lot of other reviews in here that this BluRay disc doesn't show all of America but they do show the vast majority of it including New York City (World Trade Centers too!) Gosh how I miss the site of those growing up... Seeing them in high definition was a very touching experience. They also show Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Baltimore, Alaska, most of Texas, California (Great Los Angeles night shots by the way!), Hawaii including Oahu and the north shore, and so much more. For those that can appreciate our countries majestic beauty in all its glory despite technological shortcomings, this is a great title and I highly recommend it.

The shots of NYC and the glaciers in Alaska makes it worth the buy. I wish the show was longer then 60 minutes though.

It really make me madwhen I spend my hard earned money on something that is suppose to in HD and then I found out that they basically lied to me.

Most to all footage is complied from older PBS shows that I remember seeing in the mid-late 80's. While many shots look to be true HD, others are easily seen as not.

Once again, buy for the footage, but don't expect complete HD satisfaction. Had I known, I would have bought the standard DVD so my family could borrow it.",1209340800,15,573,4.447619047619048

The Good:
=================

1. Nostalgia for Disneyland:
Vaguely reminds me of the Circle Vision America video at Disneyland back in the 80s.

2. Good choice of locations.
Overall, good selection of cities and regions to showcase.  Reminded me of how many great cities there are in this country and that I should try to visit them all someday.

The Bad:
=================

1. Poor video/image quality:
It is hard to believe that this could actually be shot with HD cameras, because it really looks like watching a DVD.  Whereas Planet Earth looks gorgeous and breathtaking on my 120"" screen, this video looks pretty shabby.  Soft image shot from helicopters it appears, as the video is almost uniformly shaky.  No smooth pans here.

2. Lack of narration:
There are moments with narration during the different city segments and then long stretches where some narration would be welcome.  Also, more identification of landmarks/buildings would be nice so you could tell what you were actually looking at.

3. Cheap packaging:
Another problem is the atrocious packaging.  This thing is so cheap that it comes in a plastic blu-ray case WITHOUT even a case insert (the paper inside the case that shows the cover on the front and back) shoved inside a lame paper sleeve.  Embarrassing to even put this in my blu-ray collection, so I hide it behind the PS3.

The Bottom Line:
=================

Overall, I would not recommend this title to anyone due to the low video quality and poor camera work, not to mention the embarrassing packaging they wrapped this thing in.  Worth a watch, but not good enough to add to your collection.",1206921600,9,1737,4.8938356164383565

3281304,5,B00104XYHQ,"Do you entertain guests at your house with your entertainment room?

If you have a big screen, and I mean a big screen like 60+ inches or a projector, this is mandatory. The run time is about an hour. Not a whole lot of dialog. But my gosh, it will blow you & your guests away! The fly-over at such close range to the objects in focus is nothing less than mind blowing with the hi-def 1080 resolution.

This is a excellent choice as an additional bill for an entertaining evening double feature. No matter how old or young your guests. It's not to long, visually mesmerizing, and because the dialog is selective and limited it allows your guests to chat and ""ooh & ahh"" about how spectacular, pristine, and almost dizzying the experience is.

I was expecting, not necesarily a wildlife video, but at least some beautiful shots of natural wonders of which this country has many (some may be surprised to know that, especially after seeing this video).  The first 30 to 40 minutes is nothing but city shots, New York, Chicago, etc.  Why anyone would want to see this is beyond me.  America has some of the ugliest cities in the world.  Taken into acount all the beautiful natural wonders they have forgone in order to show us this crap, it is beyond comprehension.  Yes toward the end they show some shots of the Grand Canyon (over done!), but over all it was crap.  I threw it in the trash where it belongs.",1264204800,4,794,4.281879194630872
3281317,3,B00104XYHQ,"If you're looking for something to show off your new HDTV and Blu-Ray player, this MIGHT be of interest.

The footage is ""old"" - at least from before the World Trade Center was attacked in 2001.  The photography is generally beautiful, as is the music track.  Image quality is quite good, especially considering that this is early HD footage.  No matter what I do, the image is slightly dropped down from the top on my Samsung 46"" LCD.

-------
What's wrong with this video?

The narrative is inane and often wrong.
Examples:  Over Philadelphia, the narrator says the rowers (in racing sculls) share THE river with tugboats and barges.  In fact, in Philadelphia is between 2 rivers.  The scullers are only on the smaller Schuylkill River (which the video misspells) and the big industrial river where the tugs, freighters and tankers run is the Delaware River.  There is no ""river sharing"" going on.

Other annoying narration goes way overboard in attempting to be politically correct and historically wrong.

There's a lot of misinformation on this audio track.

If you laugh off the stupid narration and just watch the pretty pictures go by, for $9. it's a nice demo piece for your new HDTV.",1260835200,22,1193,4.817733990147783
3281318,4,B00104XYHQ,"I've seen several of these ""armchair tourism"" Blu-rays now (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Living-Landscapes-HD-Hawaii-Blu-ray/dp/B000PTYK7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Living Landscapes HD Hawaii [Blu-ray</a>]). Most are little more than screensavers, so I had low expectations for Over America. Unlike some of the other reviewers, based on previous experience with such titles, I wasn't expecting a history lesson, comprehensive survey of American geography or cities, or a documentary of important American places. I took the title at face value and simply wanted to enjoy seeing America in a way that I knew I would probably never be able to -- short of spending my life savings. On that point, Over America delivers and is pleasantly good. There are some aerial fantastic shots that I would never be able to otherwise experience.

You can think of it as a glorified 55-minute sampler of American life, narrated by Tom Skerritt. The video moves from east to west, starting in NYC, going to PA, then DC, Chicago, moving across the heartland, out to CA, then ending in Alaska and Hawaii. There are maybe 15-20 cities/regions profiled. The music selection can seem a bit cliche and dated. I heard cool jazz on at least 3 cities (Chicago, LA, and NY, with the requisite ""New York, New York""). I suppose it's appropriate for the region portrayed, as Texas has honky tonk and New Mexico has Spanish guitar. Other parts have more mellow orchestrated music, or simply pianos. The narration isn't particularly exciting or informative though, sounding a bit like a tourist bureau infomercial or a pre-recorded guided tour like you might find in a government visitor information center like the Smithsonian or Ellis Island.

Video quality is inconsistent, with some very good shots of golden canyons and verdant cropfields and some bad hazy shots, especially during low light situations like early morning, and many instances of lens flare and a strange moiring effect from buildings windows, crops, and crowds. New York, for example, has a sort of dreary look to the daytime shots and the autumn foliage of Central Park looks rather dull. Night scenes are most problematic, with severe grain and noise in many shots. On the upside, I really loved the flyovers of the American Heartland and the endless expanses of farmland as well as the canyons.

At the current low price, this is a pretty good bargain if you just want eye candy. All the places shown are subtitled with the name of the location so you can google them later or research further. I think the price is right, and I give it credit for that. This disc is probably best for people who don't have the budget, time, or inclination to travel across this huge country, or to introduce people to the majesty of some of America's places. It's good for footage shot 20 years ago, but not a great example of the Blu-ray format.",1260748800,2,2924,5.1257861635220126

3281322,2,B00104XYHQ,"Several things about this BD annoyed me, starting right with the packaging... there is a cardboard slipcover over the standard Blu-Ray case, yet the case itself has no insert, artwork or info whatsoever - it's just a clear blue case with the disc showing thru.  So, you basically are forced to store the case in its slipcover if you want a presentable product that looks like your other titles.  A minor complaint perhaps, but why do things this way?  (I cut up the cardboard sleeve and made my own case insert.  Ha!)

The videography itself is clear as a bell - no complaints there, as this is probably the best feature of the disc.  However, the places visited (eight of them: New York, Midatlantic, Midwest, Texas, Southwest, California, Alaska and Hawaii) are visited far too  briefly.  It all feels like an empty sandwich: just a taste, but no meat.  For example, they visit Washington, D.C. but don't even show the Capitol OR the White House!  Some of the landmarks shown are labeled, others are not.  The narration by actor Tom Skerritt, who has a fine voice for this, is poorly written.  It isn't very informative, is rather sparsely and inconsistently sprinkled, and doesn't really add anything to the experience.  Add to this the cheesy music, and it's more of a distraction than an enhancement.

My advice:  This is probably best as a rental, with the sound off.  I don't know that I'd want to watch it more than once.",1240617600,5,1429,4.678714859437751

3281325,1,B00104XYHQ,"The Over America concept is a great one for HD, but this blu-ray fails to deliver as its cons outweigh its pros.

On the plus side:
- the footage is quite remarkable considering it was shot in 1994/1995.  Not being a videophile or an HD historian, I didn't even know that HD technology was available back then.

On the negative side:
- It is less than 60 mins long (amazon claims 88 mins)
- In the < 60 minutes available, there is only time to pick and choose a few areas of the country to be covered.  Broad swaths of the country are ignored, including New England (except NYC), the South/Southeast, the Great Lakes (except for incidental Chicago shots), the Plains, the Rockies, and the Pacific Northwest
- Scant narration provides little information and when it does happen, it often feels like empty propaganda (is Tom Skerrit the Iraqi Information Minister for Texas?)
- Scant on-screen labels may often leave you wondering what you are looking at
- And, finally, even though relatively much time is dedicated to Chicago, we don't see Wrigley Field!?

Most people who do not know the city, travel guides and tour shows call us the ""Second City"" and a ""small unimportant version of New York"". This dvd plays right into that. Not only do they only show downtown, except for a clip of a museum, but they show suburbs as part of the city. Then to top it off, they show the John Hancock building and label it the Sears Tower. The tallest office building in the world, formally the tallest building in the world, is not even recognized.

Now I'm not just biased for Chicago, the whole state of California was dwindled down to basically L.A. and a few parting shots of greenery and even New York was only recognized for Manhattan.

The Good:
=================

1. Nostalgia for Disneyland:
Vaguely reminds me of the Circle Vision America video at Disneyland back in the 80s.

2. Good choice of locations.
Overall, good selection of cities and regions to showcase.  Reminded me of how many great cities there are in this country and that I should try to visit them all someday.

The Bad:
=================

1. Poor video/image quality:
It is hard to believe that this could actually be shot with HD cameras, because it really looks like watching a DVD.  Whereas Planet Earth looks gorgeous and breathtaking on my 120"" screen, this video looks pretty shabby.  Soft image shot from helicopters it appears, as the video is almost uniformly shaky.  No smooth pans here.

2. Lack of narration:
There are moments with narration during the different city segments and then long stretches where some narration would be welcome.  Also, more identification of landmarks/buildings would be nice so you could tell what you were actually looking at.

3. Cheap packaging:
Another problem is the atrocious packaging.  This thing is so cheap that it comes in a plastic blu-ray case WITHOUT even a case insert (the paper inside the case that shows the cover on the front and back) shoved inside a lame paper sleeve.  Embarrassing to even put this in my blu-ray collection, so I hide it behind the PS3.

The Bottom Line:
=================

Overall, I would not recommend this title to anyone due to the low video quality and poor camera work, not to mention the embarrassing packaging they wrapped this thing in.  Worth a watch, but not good enough to add to your collection.",1206921600,9,1737,4.8938356164383565
