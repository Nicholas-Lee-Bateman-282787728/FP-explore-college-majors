8214261,5,B000UOQZ1O,"Used this DVD consistently during an 18 week recovery post hip replacement/revision.  These are great exercises, no nonsense and are wonderful for anyone who needs to be seated either permanently or on a temporary basis.  Helps with muscle tension and limited mobility.",1390953600,2,269,5.380952380952381
8214262,5,B000UOQZ1O,"great chair exercises, easy to use, picture is clear, comfortable setting, perfect picture, very relaxing, great for people confined to a wheelchair",1368835200,,148,5.7727272727272725
8214263,5,B000UOQZ1O,"This is my second Zookenisis video.  I like it very much and use many of the exercises when I teach chair yoga to my senior students.  Bob does a really good job of clearly explaining the movements and move along at a good, though moderately quick pace.  I recommend his videos to anyone who is looking for more chair exercises than just the routine ones found on line.",1361404800,,369,4.397058823529412
8214264,5,B000UOQZ1O,"I use this everyday. Excellent for all ages and capabillities.
I highly recommend it. Bob doesn't have a great personality but this will help you to be healthier",1239321600,,161,4.785714285714286
8214265,3,B000UOQZ1O,"This starts out slow paced, but if you do the exercises long enough, it is a challenging work out for most fitness levels.  The repetion becomes somewhat boring.  You will have a good stretching, breathing exercise time using this DVD.",1204329600,3,235,4.85
8214266,5,B000UOQZ1O,"I am exercising with my dad who is 76 years old and recovering from a stroke and prostate cancer surgery.  We have been using and enjoying ""Chair Exercises"" by Bob Klein.  ""More Chair Exercises"" is great.  However, it seems to us to be more advanced than the first tape.  It is good because as my dad masters the first tape it gives him a new challenge.  This tape seems to us to be a faster pace than the first tape.  I would highly recommend this tape to anyone needing to rehabilitate or simply to exercise.",1193702400,6,510,4.315789473684211
