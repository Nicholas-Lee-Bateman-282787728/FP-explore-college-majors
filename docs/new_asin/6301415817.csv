327362,4,6301415817,"One of the best ""fun"" horror movies of the 80's. Perfect atmosphere, great acting, nostalgic for those of us in our 30's. I think most people writing the reviews before me summed up the movie nicely. But I'm here to talk about the DVD itself, since you might buy it and think it's going to be top quality. We all expect top quality when we buy DVDs, so we're always disappointed when we buy a great movie like this and find that it's presented in FULL SCREEN. Also, no features. It's a cheap production, and the movie isn't as sharp and clear as should be. But it's not bad, it's serviceable. I don't think it's worth the price they're asking, but it's a hell of a lot better than the VHS copy I have.",1075593600,5,701,4.2388059701492535
327363,5,6301415817,"I just picked up a copy of this movie and I must say I was not disappointed.  I think it was hilarious and it really did strike me hard as an 80's film, but it seemed to make fun of that too.  I really must give Robert Englund a big shout out for not having anyone in the nude, not even the basic full frontal.  He still got scenes, where other movies would have gone for nudity, across effectively and I know I greatly appreciate it.  Ok, so you did see a little bit of the top of the girl, but over all no excessive t and a, it was done in a tasteful way. I also love hearing Robert as the preacher on the television program that you hear in the background.  I was really blown away near the end by Robert Picardo(from Star Trek Voyager), he did an amazing job as he always does.  Overall a fun movie, but don't expect to be terrified, just expect some fun and some surprises and to have some fun at 80's horror's expense.  keep the faith, dEx",1068076800,2,945,4.048387096774194

327455,4,6301415817,"976-Evil is a horror film about rebellious teenager Spike (Patrick OBryan) who calls a 1-900 number to get his horrorscope. Spikes cousin, Hoax (Stephen Geoffreys, Fright Night), decides to call the phone number himself after learning of its supernatural powers. Hoax spends a lot of his time in his hometown keeping local leather-jacketed thugs at bay, avoiding his overbearing religious fanatic mother (Sandy Dennis), and dreaming of a date with trailer park charmer Suzie (Lezlie Deane). The fateful phone call connects Hoax with a grotesque demonic force that gradually begins to take over his entire life, compelling him to commit dastardly crimes.

Director Robert Englund (the original Freddy Krueger of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise) undermines the narrative with an annoyingly slow pace. The premise isn't bad, and Geoffreys does an effective job of portraying Hoaxs inherent nerdiness as well as his crazed avenger, going after those who have made his life miserable. The plot is a variation on the mythological Pandoras box. Once a phone call is made to that number, its virtually impossible to undo its effects. Hoaxs obsession with the hotline and his repeated calls is perhaps a metaphor for drug addiction. It gets to a point that he cant help himself and he goes down an increasingly dark and sinister path.

Bonus materials on the R-rated widescreen Blu-ray release include all-new commentary with director Robert Englund and Nancy Booth Englund and alternate home video version. A digital HD copy is also included.",1507075200,9,1540,5.230769230769231

327494,1,6301415817,"Easily one of the worst theatrically released horror movies of the 1980's, 976-EVIL suffers from having Freddy Krueger star Robert Englund in the director's chair.  His handling of both actors and action is overly broad and cartoonish.  You would think he learned something from working with Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper (among many others) but that clearly wasn't the case.  There isn't a single mildly suspenseful or creepy scene in the entire film.  The effects are cheesy and whatever charm the film might have is accidental as the dated elements that age 976-EVIL (the 80's haircuts and clothing; 976 numbers; phone booths on the street; cheesy special effects) are pretty much the only things that provide any entertainment value at this point.

The story involves the phone number of the title, which connects you with Satan or a demon or something that grants your darkest wishes but, predictably, at a very great price.  The setup isn't terrible and cowriter Brian Helgeland would later go on to win an Oscar (for L.A. Confidential, which was his career highlight by a very wide margin) but 976-EVIL doesn't do enough to set up its premise.  While the initial call sounds appropriately hokey and safe, the movie should do more to gradually draw it's doomed character in until he realizes that there's no way out.  Instead, he's committing a completely pointless murder by his third call, which puts him past the point of no return way too quickly.

People who like their horror movies silly rather than scary might get a kick out of 976-EVIL but everyone else should probably stay away from this one.  It's a cheesy, badly directed mess that mainly demonstrates how much easier it was to get a horror movie released in theaters in 1988 than it is now.",1477612800,,1758,4.849498327759197

327565,2,6301415817,"I remember seeing this one back in the day, mainly because I was a huge ""Fright Night"" fan, and loved Stephen Geoffreys as ""Evil Ed"" in that film. (I believe this was Geoffreys last foray in mainstream films before turning to gay porn?). I had no idea at the time that I saw this originally that it was directed by Robert ""Freddy Krueger"" Englund, and when I saw his name in the credits, I was excited to see what he could do behind the camera.

As the film opens we see a businessman walking through a city slum and seemingly being taunted by ringing telephones. When he finally picks up a handset, the phonebooth....and he burst into flames. We then meet two high school cousins, one is the resident, motorcycle driving bad boy, named Spike, and one is the sweater-vest wearing nerd who is the main target for a group of bullies and his name is Hoax. (ugh....)
Spike is dating Angela, who Hoax has a crush on. Spike finds an add for a phone service where you can call and get your ""Horrorscope"", after Spike makes his first call, he is given a way to re-pay a gambling debt. With his second call, he is tempted to steal a pair of riding gloves, but puts them back, breaking the spell the phone line has on him. Unfortunately Hoax soon falls under the spell of ""976-EVIL"".

This is a dumb movie, with a couple of interesting visuals, but the characters are all amazingly stupid, the special f/x are kind of weak, with the main character morphing into David Bowie?? To be honest outside of the ""spider"" scene this film is painfully dull. I likes some of the ""Nightmare""-like sequences, and only wish Robert Picardo played a larger role.

I see they've bundled this movie into those mega-movie packs, and if you pick one of those up, and are bored one night...give it a shot, but this is definitely not worth going out of your way to see.",1407715200,,1837,4.445103857566766

There's some brief nudity and lots of bloody gore! The effects are a bit out-dated compared to today's CGI, but it still works.
I love Sandy Dennis as Mom and Aunt Lucy, but it's sad to see this is what she's reduced to playing. Of course Robert Englund knows horror and does it pretty good here as director.

327598,4,6301415817,"976-EVIL, a 1988 film that marked the directorial debut of actor Robert(Freddy Krueger)Englund, is yet another one of the most underrated films of the 1980's. It also blends the elements of horror and comedy and like the urban slang term would suggest, it is a horromedy. It is a satirical homage to the horror genre that works on many levels.

The whole film starts with Hoax Wilmouth(Stephen Geoffreys)being the scapegoat of all the bullies at his high school. He is a gifted student who is very bright and admired by his teachers, but Hoax is unhappy and feels alone as a result of the abuse that he receives from all the so called ""cool kids"" in his high school. He communicates with his cousin Spike(Patrick O'Bryan)via an old fashioned pipe line connection system, though Spike really doesn't like nor favor talking with Hoax. Aside from the bullies, Hoax also puts up with his very overbearing religious fundamentalist Christian fanatic mother(Sandy Dennis, may she rest in peace)constantly and as a result, Hoax resents her. Hoax seems to be your average nerd who is smart and well read and is also the constant target of taunts by all of the so called ""cool kids"" in school, which leaves Hoax very resentful. Despite all of this, Hoax still likes girls and is hoping to make it with an older woman who lives in a trailer park(Leslie Deane). With all of his anger and resentment, Hoax has feelings of one day nailing all of his tormentors someway or somehow.

One day, Hoax discovers a phone number on a slip of paper, which is 976-EVIL, that promises to give him his daily horrorscope. He discovers that his cousin Spike calls this number often to get his horrorscope and Hoax decides to give it a try. Unbeknown to Hoax, it is simply a phone line connected with the spirits of Hell and promises him to give the power to avenge his tormentors, which he does as the film's story starts to really unfold. He gets even with every tormentor, including his own mother. As usual, I am not going to give very much away as I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen this film as of yet.

Robert Englund is very impressive in his feature film directorial debut. He shows that he is not only a great actor, but also, a very good director. The cast all play their roles with a lot of charisma and finesse and all of that does indeed keep the film afloat and the result is a very entertaining romp that not only provides the goods for horror movie lovers everywhere, but also provides some very amusing moments that will make you laugh. Stephen Geoffreys steals the show as Hoax as he is the movie's star. Of course, Sandy Dennis also aids and abets in stealing the show as Hoax's overbearing religious fanatic mother. Kudos also goes to Robert Picard who plays the evil but somewhat likeable Mark Dark, who runs the 976-EVIL phone line that is connected with the evil spirits of Hell. Patrick O'Bryan also delivers a wonderful performance as Hoax's cousin Spike.

The film has some terrific, if not enough, special effects. But the film does indeed hold the viewers attention as it keeps going along until the end. It doesn't bore nor does it waste anyone's time. 976-EVIL will keep you glued to the TV screen until it is all over. Englund does wonders behind the camera for the first time and he delivers a wonderful, fun and entertaining movie that can be enjoyed again and again repeatedly as it isn't boring nor is it unsatisfactory. For horror film lovers, it delivers the goods that you would expect. For comedy lovers, you will have some laughs along the way. If you love both types of films, you will get your fill here in more ways than one.

I bought this on VHS for the heck of it back in the mid 1990's. It was an uncut version of the film that had footage that was edited out before it's theatrical release. I would later buy the DVD, but the DVD was a big disappointment. The DVD had the movie in FullScreen and also, it was the theatrical cut rather than the uncut version that was released on VHS and LaserDisc. The DVD is also bare bones as it had no special features. It only had a theatrical trailer gallery of other films that were available by Sony Home Entertainment. I also don't have any recollection of this film being released back in the day in theaters. I also didn't recollect any TV spots nor anything in my local newspaper concerning this. I bought it mainly because of Stephen Geoffreys(who played ""Evil Ed"" Thompson in Fright Night{another fave of mine} a few years prior to this film and also appeared in the film Fraternity Vacation. Since then, he has appeared in several Gay porn videos according to his IMDB page and his article on Wikipedia)and for the fact that Robert Englund was the director. When I did pop this in my VCR, I enjoyed the film as it really made me laugh and also did scare me a little, but still, it is fun to watch and it is also one of my favorites.

The DVD of this film still leaves a lot to be desired. As stated, it is in FullScreen and also has no special features of any kind. Also, as stated, it has a theatrical trailer gallery, but 976-EVIL's theatrical trailer isn't one of them. There are also no TV spots for the film(if any) on here and there are no featurettes nor any commentaries by the director or even by the cast. As stated, it is also the theatrical release and not the uncut version that was released on VHS and LaserDisc. The sound is possibly Dolby 2.0 audio, but it doesn't sound too bad and it does look pretty good despite the shortcomings.

Despite the disappointments, the movie is on DVD and that is good. My review is strictly for the movie itself anyway, not the DVD.

A few years later, there was a direct to video sequel called 976-EVIL 2: The Astral Factor. Patrick O'Bryan was the only actor from this movie to reprise his role of Spike for the direct to video sequel.

Overall, 976-EVIL is a fun and entertaining romp for both lovers of the horror and comedy genres, including those who love both. Robert Englund shines in his directorial debut and I am going to be on the lookout of more of his directorial efforts in the near and distant future. The film is very well worth renting or owning. It is fun for horror fans with a sense of humor and also for comedy fans who love a little horror now and then, or for those who love both of the genres. No fan of horror, comedy or both or even Robert Englund fans should be without this one.",1326240000,2,6440,4.47404255319149

This is such a wonderfully entertaining and wonderfully 80's flick that I have to watch it every October. Directed by the great Robert Englund and written by Brian Helgeland this has always been a fav of mine. Ever since it has been released it has been a stable on late night showings especially during October. I remember this coming on all the time late at night in the 90's on USA.

The film follows two cousins who are very much different. One [Spike (Patrick O'Bryan) is the cool, loner type bad boy kid and the other Hoax (Stephen Geoffreys) is the kid that gets picked on at school. Hoax obviously wants to be like his cousin and wants to hang out with him all the time. In doing so Hoax comes across a phone number his cousin had that he tries out. Turns out this phone call helps him out a lot as the voice on the other side tells him what to do to make his troubles go away. The more he uses this number the better things get for him at first. He starts to turn into something he is not, a demon of some sorts, and that voice on the other end of the phone, the devil.

Directed by horror icon Robert Englund this movie is everything you loved about 80's horror. It has a crazy but cool concept that if ever true would really be scary, along with a big name horror icon attached [Englund]. Along with all of those you get cheesy acting and lines and just a really fun time. I still even to this day love this flick because it just reminds me of simpler times. Times when a movie was made for fun, and not to have some serious message. Don't get me wrong those films can be good to but sometimes you just want to shut the brain off.

Remembered mostly as Mr. Englund's directorial debut and for good reason since he is a big name I still think there was something even more memorable here. That of course was the crazy performance by Stephen Geoffreys who shines here. He gets to obviously have fun with the role and just let loose as he is wonderfully over the top here. Kinda reminds me of his performance in ""Fright Night"" but even crazier. Now this is not for everybody and I am sure some reading this hate this flick. That is fine you have your own tastes and opinions and that is cool. I love these crazy flicks and the only complaint I have I have is where oh where is a commentary from Robert Englund for this movie? Oh and one more thing, have you seen the sequel?",1318550400,,2392,4.216157205240175

As an actor turned director, Englund obviously cares about his characters first and foremost, and in turn, his film gives them ample time to breathe. Also, the man obviously paid attention during his tenure as Freddy, as his film takes many visual cues from the ""Elm Street"" series and tries its best to rise above its meager budget. There's also an underlying sense of humor (again, a byproduct of being Krueger) that helps make the whole easier to swallow.

A shame, though, that aside from some decent characters and solid cinematography from Paul Elliott which attempts to establish a foreboding mood, the film barely has enough juice to reach its lame conclusion. While the first half sets our characters up nicely, the second more or less tears down any progress made by dispatching of decent characters too quickly and wrapping things up in what feels like a very rushed and hap-hazard sort of way. The film's main weakness is in its script which stretches its premise far too thin and requires its audience to fill in the blanks a few too many times. Also, the gore and make-up effects from the usually consistent Kevin Yagher are surprisingly substandard and, at times, laughable. What should be an undeniably enjoyable 80's cheese-fest is instead a frustrating and uneven dud that could have and should have been much more. Stephen Geoffreys aside, horror fans will recognize Lezlie Deane from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freddy-s-Dead-The-Final-Nightmare/dp/0780630890/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freddy's Dead - The Final Nightmare</a>"" - another actor whose career went absolutely nowhere in the following decade.

First of all, many people seem to think this movie is a continuation of The Evil character from Fright Night, it is not.
It has nothing to do with that character!!
It's basically about this complete reject kid who decides to start calling a hotline for advice, turns all crazy/evil, and finally gets revenge on the people who treated him like crap.
Lots of random parts, many what the F**k moments, and fish falling from the sky at one point.

327644,2,6301415817,"When shifting through the sheer number of cruddy 80's horror flicks, every now and then you'll find a forgotten gem or two.  976-Evil is not one of them to be sure, but it does have one honorable mention that makes it worth seeing on its own.  That honorable mention is that the film is directed by none other than Robert ""Freddy Kruger"" Englund, who does manage to inject a little bit of creativity into this otherwise forgettable horror flick.  Fright Night's Stephen Geoffreys stars as a nerd who calls up a hotline said to give out a ""horrorscope"", and soon enough finds himself taking on a demonic form and striking back at everyone he can, including the high school bullies and his uber-Christian mother.  It's up to his cool biker cousin Spike (Patrick O'Bryan) and a private detective (Jim Metzler) to take him down, which results in some fairly anticlimactic moments of bloody violence.  There are some decent makeup effects to be found, and the script is from future Oscar winning screenwriter Brian Helgeland, but as a whole, 976-Evil fails thanks to some horrible acting and overall cheesy effects.  All in all, 976-Evil is an otherwise forgettable 80's horror flick that is only worth seeing based on the fact that Robert Englund directed it.

327645,5,6301415817,"I love this movie. I remember watching it back in the day when it was shown on Up All Night hosted by Rhonda Shearer (remember that show?) But I haven't seen the movie in ages. The other day I was looking for something to watch on the old b00b tube and found ""976-EVIL"" available on-demand. There was a sequel to the movie that came out a few years after this one (that Patrick O'Bryan was in) and there is talk of an all-new remake, as well.

The movie is directed by everyone's favorite keeper of sweet dreams, none other than Mr. Freddy Krueger himself, Robert Englund. And surprisingly the movie wasn't nearly as gorey as one might think with a talented director like this. Instead there were many sensitive and reflective scenes that are almost never in horror pictures. But truth be told ""976-EVIL"" is hardly a classic horror film. This isn't a movie that's gonna cause you to piss your pants, unless you piss from laughing too hard. But that's OK too because sometimes a good laugh is just as important as a good scare.

The first half of the movie centered around rebel without a cause Spike (portrayed by '80s b-movie actor Patrick O'Bryan). We see Spike loose a hand of poker to his scummy friends. We see Spike threaten his kooky born-again Christian aunt Lucy (played by the late Academy Award winner, Sandy Dennis). We see Spike defend the honor of his nerdy cousin Hoax (you gotta love that name  played by Stephen Geoffreys) when the boys in the bathroom try to flush his head down the commode. And we even get treated to a brief sex-session between Spike and his blonde nymph girlfriend Suzie (Lezlie Deane) who thinks nothing of putting on Spike's tighty wighties. Spike also calls some ludicrous horoscope hotline but since he's not a total geek doesn't have much interest in it.

During the second half of the movie we see a lot more of the progressively less geeky Hoax. When he starts calling the hotline his luck starts to change, he even starts to grow hair on his chest too! I love the part when Hoax took revenge on the guys who effed with him when he was just a lowly nerd. I suppose if they'd known who they were messing with they wouldn't have roughed him up so hard. Then he gets revenge on his crazy mom who spends all her time watching the PTL and stroking her playful pussie.

The movie also includes many great lines, such as when Hoax said to Spike, ""hell finally froze over cousin."" I also like the complete and total b-movie feel of the entire movie. It was like a throwback to the great pictures of the '60s because all of the special effects were so fake-looking. I suppose that had more to do with the budget but it was still funny.

I really like the transformation that both of the cousins went through because it was a total 3-60. It wasn't just Hoax. Spike wasn't the same person because it was almost like their roles were reversed. Although Hoax kinda resembled Marty McFly he was certainly the more brazen of the 2 because he had the balls to make all of his dreams come true (hell really did freeze over). The moral of the movie is not to call too many pay phone lines, unless you're some geeky kid from the '80s who doesn't have anything better to do.",1223942400,4,3199,4.45982905982906

327648,3,6301415817,"Directed by Robert `Freddy Krueger' Englund (A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Phantom of the Opera), 976-EVIL (1989)...interestingly enough I once dated a woman who had the same phone number...stars Stephen Geoffreys (Fright Night, At Close Range) as a nebbish mama's boy who becomes entangled with satanic forces through a 976 phone number after becoming weary of suffering the torments of his nerdly existence.  Also appearing is Patrick O'Bryan (No Holds Barred), Oscar winner Sandy Dennis (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?), Lezlie Deane (Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare), J.J. Cohen (Secret Admirer), Robert Picardo (""Star Trek: Voyager""), and Jim Metzler (River's Edge).

Stephen Geoffreys plays an annoying, smarmy, little doofus (i.e. his standard role) named Hoax Arthur Wilmoth, a high school student who lives with his mother Lucy (Dennis), a holier than thou, pestering, overbearing, unpleasant woman whose home is full of cats, religious icons, and furniture wrapped in plastic.  Living in the apartment above the garage is Spike (O'Bryan), Hoax's cousin and part time student/professional juvenile delinquent, and, subsequently, Hoax's idol.  After losing the pink slip to his motorcycle during a poker game with some other greasy delinquents, Spike comes across a magazine insert featuring a 976 phone number, one that give you your `horrorscope', whatever the heck that is...anyway, Spike calls, and soon his fortunes change, but he has sort of a falling out with his skeevy girlfriend named Suzie (Deane).  After Hoax suffers various embarrassing situations at the hands of Marcus and his goon squad (including, but not withstanding a toilet shampoo in the boys' bathroom at school), he also comes across the flyer and begins calling, but where his cousin Spike got turned off on the experience (after a mysterious near death incident), Hoax becomes hooked calling regularly, so much so he begins to go through various physiological changes, along with attaining some interesting new powers.  This newfound power allows Hoax to do something which he hadn't be able to do before in terms of standing up for himself, and even returning some of the pain and suffering on those who've abused him over the years.  Things get out of hand, though (big surprise), as a demonic force begins to take control of Hoax resulting in a number of deaths.  As Spike finally realizes what's going on, it may be too late as Hoax is no longer Hoax, but a demonic entity intent on bring about the Armageddon...

I remember seeing a film similar to this, one released back in 1981 called Evilspeak, featuring Clint Howard as a military school who invokes satanic forces in order to help him overcome various, abusive elements within the school.  Given the similarities I found Evilspeak to be much more entertaining, mainly because it had a solid story, which really isn't the case with 976-EVIL, but also due to the fact I like Clint Howard a lot more than I like Stephen Geoffreys, the latter whose character elicited no sympathies whatsoever due to his inherent creepy and skeevy nature (and that was before he became possessed).  There was some potential here, but the follow through falters seriously resulting a relatively tepid horror film with demonic overtones.  I actually thought Robert Englund did very well in directing as he obviously knows how to set up shots but real weakness here is in the material.  The plot is terribly anemic, and suffers from a lack of positive, forward flow.  The film feels a lot like just a series of sequences strung together, some not matching up entirely with that which followed.  Can anyone who's seen this film tell me the point of Jim Metzler's character?  He plays a private investigator snooping about, apparently interested in the various goings on, but it's never detailed what exactly he's looking for or who actually hired him.  Seems like his character was tossed into the mix as a means to a bit of expository crud in terms of the guy who operates the Horrorscope number, played by Robert Picardo.  The story skimps on details throughout, and while I've seen this in other films, in terms of the filmmakers giving the audience the credit of having the intelligence to fill in the blanks, that's definitely not the case here given the overall shoddy nature of the story.  If you can get past this aspect there are some fun bits, including Hoax developing a lizard like appearance and his voice dropping a few octaves (he finally became a man, albeit one possessed by a demon).  There was a really odd part for me in the movie, one that features Marcus and his meager gang (four, including Marcus), all of whom hung out in the projection room of a local movie house (apparently one of them had a job in the theater as a projectionist).  At one point, near the end, as evil Hoax arrives to confront them, we see them playing strip poker.  Okay, fine...except there's only one, skaggy girl in the room, and she's fully dressed whereas Marcus' friends are in their boxers.  Would you really want to engage in such a game where the majority of the players are male, and the one female involved is better at cards (as indicated from her fully dressed form) than said males?  Another strange aspect, given Robert `Freddy Krueger' Englund's direction I was half expecting a decent amount of blood, but there's really not that much as the goriest bits took place off screen.  Lezlie Deane provides a nice topless shot, if you're into that kind of thing.  All in all 976-EVIL was mildly entertaining but I'd not something I'd recommend someone to go out of his or her way to see unless it was a really cheap rental or playing on cable.  A sequel, of which I haven't seen, titled 976-EVIL 2: The Astral Factor (1992) was released, with only Patrick O'Bryan returning in the role as Spike.

The picture on this Columbia/Tristar DVD release, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1) pan and scan, looks decent enough, but I don't understand why the studio couldn't have released this in its original aspect ratio.  Sure the film isn't all that great, but I find it annoying not to be able to see the film in its original aspect ratio.  As far as the audio it's presented in Dolby Digital stereo, and comes across well enough.  There aren't any extras included, other than a couple of trailers for the films Hollow Man (2000) and Fright Night (1985), both of which are better than this feature (of the pair I'd recommend Fright Night).  There are subtitles available in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese, and Korean, for what it's worth.

A strange note on Stephen Geoffreys, a few years after this film, specifically after appearing in Roland Emmerich's excremental feature Moon 44 (1990), Geoffreys began appearing in a number of hard core homoerotic features under the pseudonym Sam Ritter, apparently after developing a serious issue with drugs, according to information available on the Internet Movie Database.",1165881600,7,6971,4.965606190885641

This Sony / Columbia Pictures blu-ray release of 976-Evil is adequate to replace both my RCA / Columbia VHS and my Columbia / Tristar DVD of the movie. It's not my fantasy blu-ray release, but it's the best available and the product is satisfactory; I'm happy with it. Being often disappointed with the way these older movies are treated by the Hollywood studios, this one's not bad at all.

For starters, the Theatrical version of the movie is reasonably nice-looking HD, it's the first time I've seen it in 16:9 aspect ratio (Widescreen), which is a very good thing. Also, there's a commentary track by Robert and Nancy Booth Englund. They do share some informative nuggets, but it's nothing particularly amazing.
Then, the extended Home Video version is included as well, in its intended 4:3 aspect ratio and this looks really nice considering that to my knowledge, it's only been released on VHS. It's much higher resolution than a VHS tape, making me think it's taken from the master and possibly digitally enhanced somehow. If you've only seen the Theatrical release of 976-Evil, the extensions seem to replace bits that were probably removed from the movie only to cut its running time. They do flesh out the movie a bit and serve to make it more complete and well rounded.

My only real criticism of the release is there could be more included here. Maybe some trailers and promotional materials, magazine articles, archival features whether it be paper media or on the disc, etc. We get only small historical info through the commentary, but that's ok. It's enough to make this really worth the purchase for someone who loves the movie.

Oh, and then included is the Digital HD with Ultraviolet (tm) code that comes in the package if you really want it. This has no value to me. I get the little slip, tear it up and flush it down the f'n toilet hoping it doesn't cause any issues down there.",1517443200,,2052,5.083086053412463

7811431,3,6301415817,"Late '80s horror flick has underdog nerdy taking to the phone line to get his horoscope in hope of improving his dull and lame existence in life.
Forget about the high school wannabe's that look like members of ""Culture Club"" and the chick that hangs out with his cousin. She could easily end up in a music video of the time. Cute though. lol What I took from this movie was the era it was made in. By the time the late '80s arrived, a slew of horror, if you can call it that, movies were out and coming out. The whole decade is full of them, most forgettable, some very worthy entries.
The movie looks decent on Blu-ray, but don't expect it to look like it was done ""yesterday"" with the technology they had to shoot with in '89.
It does come with an alternate ""home video version"" and a digital copy.
The packaging looks like that of VHS style, and that is pretty cool as far as that goes. If you like horror flicks like this, you may like it, if not, pass.",1509148800,2,958,4.183783783783784
