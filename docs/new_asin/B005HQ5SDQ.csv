4702838,5,B005HQ5SDQ,"Became a New York Yankee fan in 1954 as a 8 years old. I skipped school in Fargo ND. My father worked for the Great Northern Railroad and Roger Maris father worked with my father. Met Roger Maris and had a Coke, Burger, and fries with him. Never thought to Much of it tell 1961 when my father reminded me of it. My grand son name is Caleb and I called him Mic one day. My son in law saw his son was puzzled and said to his son,  ""Grandpa paid you the best of all names ever"" Caleb plays baseball year around summer through winter in a special program for young kids who want to become professional players. You guessed it ""The New York Yankees."" Thank you Mick for a gift to an 8 year old from Fargo ND.",1400025600,,703,4.021428571428571

4702841,5,B005HQ5SDQ,"If you were a Mickey Mantle fan, like I was, this book is for you. He had a good life. Full of ups and downs, like most people,  TOM",1361577600,,132,3.5517241379310347
4702842,5,B005HQ5SDQ,"I bought this dvd for my 74-year old father who has always loved The Mick.  It contains great, vintage game footage from the Fifties and Sixties, as well as lots of commentary from former teammates and friends.  They all speak of Mickey as a great teammate and a great guy. I had no idea that he was so quiet and shy. The film covers everything from a little boy in Oklahoma to a baseball icon.

The film also depicts Mickey's many hardships, such as the death of his dad at a very young age, and his constant physical ailments.  He played in great pain for most of his career, but he had the heart of a champion. I loved watching Mantle talk about winning. He has a twinkle in his eye and a boyish grin. I wish the film had more from Mickey later in life, but the early interviews are priceless. He appears humble and, yes, very shy.

A baseball fan of any kind would enjoy this documentary, but one who is a true Mantle fan will absolutely love it. If you don't already like Mickey Mantle, watch it with someone who does- and you will.",1352505600,4,1037,4.243654822335025

8473453,5,B005HQ5SDQ,"I've been a Mickey Mantle fan since I was old enough to know what a baseball was, which is about the same time he broke into the Majors. I know he was a flawed character in many ways, but he may have been the best baseball player who ever lived. He never realized that potential because of his many flaws. Still he was a humble man and could never get over the public's adoration of him--he never let it go to his head, so for that, and his monumental baseball skills, I must admire him still. All of this comes out in this wonderful video. If you have the slightest interests in Mickey Mantle and the Yankees of the '50s and 60s, this is a must have DVD. I liked it so well that I gave it to a cousin and then reordered another copy for myself. I'll admit I bought it originally because it was so cheap and I had free shipping, but had I known what I was getting I'd have happily paid far more (hope I don't cause a price increase with that statement).",1441497600,,953,4.101604278074866
8473454,1,B005HQ5SDQ,"This is a really terrible film. First off the production and direction is reminiscent of a high school after school special. The music is terrible and the narration for some reason feels the need to summarize what Mickey is about to say. That is when they actually focus on Mickey. My second complaint is that the director seems to have ADD and wanders off into other directions that have nothing to do with The Mick. My last complaint is that for a film with a subtitle: In his own words; they rarely let Mickey actually say anything. They've got a whole slew of former teammates offering their memories (which is nice), but its not called Mickey Mantle a little bit and Roger Maris and the 1964 cardinals: With a few sentences from Mickey Mantle. Don't buy this!",1438041600,,764,4.583941605839416
8473455,5,B005HQ5SDQ,A very well written book about America's hero when we grew up.  He tells it like it was and doesn't make excuses for all the drinking and partying he did in his career.  He would have been the best if he stayed sober.,1429747200,,217,4.023255813953488
