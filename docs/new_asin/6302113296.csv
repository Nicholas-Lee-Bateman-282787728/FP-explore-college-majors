422925,4,6302113296,"He was old enough to be my father, but after I saw him in ""The Bridge on the River Kwi"" I was in love. This film bio of him was very good.  I learned about how good he was as a person.  I knew the ""bad"" things about him through the news media, like drinking, and divorcing is wife of many years to be with a much younger woman--according to the news media.  He may have been divorced a few years before getting involved with the younger woman.  He was a great actor, handsome, and had a heart of gold.  The only minus for this film is that I wanted to  know more about him. It wasn't long enough.",1431820800,,596,3.966386554621849

Interesting for fans of William Holden.  Can't believe he's been gone so long. He was one of the best, and his movies are still great to watch.",1428624000,,152,4.392857142857143
422927,5,6302113296,Golden Age films never cease to captivate me. This film gives an in-depth look into the troubled life of one of Hollywood's favorite actor. I truly loved learning about such an iconic man.,1428278400,,188,4.7272727272727275

422933,5,6302113296,"I enjoyed this video about William Holden but wondered when it was made?.  It says 2011 but not one of the people interviewed about him are alive today.  Most of them have been dead for years - even his son, Scott, who died in 2005.",1405209600,,232,4.133333333333334

422960,5,6302113296,It tells me all I need to know about William Holden.  Doesn't paper over the cracks.  It is such a waste when human beings are overtaken by addiction to alcohol.  What a struggle for him - and millions of others.  It has made me realise how much younger people in their sixties look these days!,1404777600,,294,4.290909090909091
422961,4,6302113296,"Since he was always a favorite of mine, it was interesting to learn so much about him.  He definitely had a great movie career but it is so sad that it ended the way it did.  I really enjoy these biographies you offer for free.  Thanks.",1395705600,,236,4.086956521739131
422962,5,6302113296,William Holden has always been a favorite of mine.  I enjoyed seeing photos so him as a youth and how he grew to become a Movie Star.,1394755200,,133,3.925925925925926
422963,4,6302113296,I only knew William Holden from performances like Bridge on the River Kwai and Network. This documentary provided important background information as well as commentary from other actors and one of his sons. It also included information on a game refuge he quietly established in Africa. It helped me understand the man and his work. This is an older production but it is still very good. Holden may not attract enough attention to warrant a new retrospective so that makes this more valuable.,1389225600,4,493,4.951807228915663
422964,3,6302113296,"While fascinating, particularly the commentary by family and friends, this ""documentary"" is rather sanitized, to say the least. Holden's alcoholism is well-documented, yet this documentary leaves an impression that it was more of a social thing.  However, while in Italy, Holden was involved in a car accident that resulted in the death of another individual. He was convicted and served a suspended sentence. This event did little to change his drinking habit and in fact, according to some, it plunged him further into a depression which he never really recovered from. For such a pivotal life event to not receive any mention in a ""documentary"" is astonishing. Moreover, Holden fathered at least one child while married and some speculate that perhaps there may have been more. His affairs were numerous and some were quite public. Yet this documentary portrays him as the quintessential ""family"" man, your hardworking suburban father next door, doin' what he can to provide. Well, that may have been true, but so were the affairs and his outside of marriage paternity.  I have some notion of the complexities of the human condition. I am not suggesting that Holden be maligned or dethroned in any way. However, a documentary should present individuals in all their complexity, good and bad and let the public opinion chips, fall where they may.",1384819200,22,1348,5.095022624434389
422965,4,6302113296,"William Holden was always a solid presence in all of his 75 films, with a handful remembered and cherished by fans, all given nods in this retrospective look at his life and work. Consider Sunset Boulevard, The Bridge of the River Kwai, Network and The Towering Inferno, which demonstrate the strength of his rsum. But there were lesser films, in which he broke loose from the urbane mold -- war movies, westerns, and the romantic lead as the drifter in Picnic. He can best be appreciated in The World of Suzie Wong, which is also a great look at the Hong Kong of 1960, and a superb example of great art direction in that era -- available on Amazon Prime Instant Video.

422968,4,6302113296,I am a obsessed fan of golden age movies! OMG they rock! So obviously William Holden's name pops up! I knew a little about him throughout my encounters with his movies and interviews. This tribute type piece really gets in depth. I now like him more than I did before I saw this film!!!!!! My mother knew of him more first hand she was in grade school when Sabrina came out and ect...I never saw him alive well that's not true I was a little kid when he died but I hadn't discovered him yet.  E.T was more interesting at that time for me anyways as I swerve off topic.... I loved this video and I am so glad William Holden existed and will always exist! Gorgeous Golden Boy!!!(sorry guys)I am a woman with big eyes! lol Men will like it if they enjoy any of his movies> Also gives glimpses of that awesome era and people in it! Enjoy!,1355788800,5,834,4.2125

7821045,5,6302113296,"Bill Holden got my undivided attention during a dance with Kim Novak in Picnic - he took my breath away. Just remembering that scene gives me goosebumps. I watched this program to learn about who he was as a person, an actor and as a contributing member of society. I learned a lot about him in this brief program and I look forward to revisiting some of his film performances with a more complete understanding of his profession, who the man was and his unique contribution as a person. I also appreciated the fact that his lifelong battle with alcoholism took a welcome ""back seat"" to his numberless attributes, sacrifices in his family-life, his many strong friendships and his overall accomplishments within an insidious industry. I recommend this short film for a variety of reasons.",1471219200,,788,4.844444444444444
7821046,5,6302113296,"Very enjoyable story about the rise of William Holden in his acting career, from a young unknown in """"Golden Boy:"" to Academy Award winner for ""Stalag 17"".  It depicts his acting career along with his interest in preservation of wild life and his work in Africa to maintain the health and well being of  animals.",1469145600,,312,4.654545454545454
7821047,5,6302113296,"I love every movie with William Holden.  This was his first big one.  He is in learning mode.  All of his film show a star quality.  He was someone you could see as the boy next store.  He gave performances that made you feel that he was that person.  We do not have actors of this quality today.  I hope one of them is rising and getting better with each performance, but, I sadly do not see any at this time.
Give us another William Holden!  I am transfixed with each of his movie performances.
I enjoy watching them and hope I can get the made for TV movie, The Blue Knights.  This is the only one I cannot get in its entirety.
Can you make this one available?
You only have the TV series with George Kennedy.
I want the Made for TV movie with William Holden & Lee Remick. .",1469059200,,777,4.059210526315789
