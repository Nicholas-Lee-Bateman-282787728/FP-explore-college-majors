8521098,5,B007QWRII2,A great video demonstration for all you Odissi dancers out there that might live far from your teacher and classes. Great sound and image quality. The steppings are done to music that is slow enough that you can practice along with. A must have for all dancers!,1441152000,,261,4.574468085106383
8521099,5,B007QWRII2,"This video is neatly divided up into DVD Chapters for head movements, neck movements, hand gestures, arm positions, steps, etc.  It is easy to navigate to each section using the DVD Menu.

In each section the dancer demonstrates each step while someone calls out the name of each step. It goes from step 1 to step 2 to step 3 etc continuously, so it can also be used to follow along doing the movements as a practice session (or can be used like an encyclopedia to watch)

The video image quality and audio cues are good quality too.",1360454400,,533,4.418367346938775
