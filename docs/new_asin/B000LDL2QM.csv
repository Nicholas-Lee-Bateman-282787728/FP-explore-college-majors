8161640,1,B000LDL2QM,"I wouldn't let my toddle finish watching this. There was so much negativity and harshness in the interactions between the characters, it was depressing and not a good example I want for my kid. When the dad car told one of his sons to ""shut up"", this went off. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone.",1492473600,,298,4.4363636363636365
8161641,4,B000LDL2QM,"This movie is fun for kids and parents to watch together. The characters are believable and the content reflects real-life father/son relationships. The movie may be simply done, but you can tell that real people made it.",1237507200,,221,5.0
