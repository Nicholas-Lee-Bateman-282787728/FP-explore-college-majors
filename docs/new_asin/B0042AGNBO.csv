4248893,1,B0042AGNBO,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!

First and foremost this is NOT a gay-interest film - no characters are gay and there is one slight scene of forced kissing between two girls, definitely no gay bears. This movie was nothing short of fun aside from what little humor it had. While the camera and lighting was usually up-scale for an independent film, the content was deplorable.

The plot, simply, a bunch of rednecks kidnap rich high school girls and force them to fight in a shoddy-made ring inside a barn. The creepier part - their teacher is the main organizer of these brutal fights where rich businessmen gamble in the audience. The film consists of about 5 minutes of fighting with the rest involving kidnapping and torturing the girls. Nevertheless, be forewarned fight movie fans and don't let the title of this movie lure you into something not cool. And the incest jokes are uncalled for and so overused in the independent circuit.",1292284800,2,936,4.84375

8413396,4,B0042AGNBO,"When young teen girls start disappearing from the community, the police send Maggie (Jessica Sonneborn) undercover at the local high school. Because she has a vehicle, she befriends four trashy teens who need a ride to a Rav. As the title suggests, they don't go to the Rav, but wind up as the main attraction at a teen girl fight club run by the locals.

The film had great characters and a girl's locker scene. The build up was good, but there could have been more fighting for my tastes.

Worth a view for lovers of the genre. Available on a 30 Horror Film Collection.

8413397,1,B0042AGNBO,"This was the worst movie, I have seen in all my 30 some odd years on this planet. This is what I get for being sick and just wanting to watch a low-key movie....netflix's made this sound slightly appealing. I would have rather watched dung beetles mate on a stick for an hour and a half on the discovery channel. I turned it off after 40 minutes and my flu-like symptoms intensifying as a result of chronic bad acting, and the worst dialogue on the planet. Good luck to all who watch this movie.",1357948800,,495,4.276595744680851
8413398,5,B0042AGNBO,"The teen fight club title is off-putting, but the movie is a great old school-feeling thriller.

If the girly banter at the beginning annoys you, don't worry... it will soon gone.  Once the movie sets into the ""thriller"" part (after the first 30 minutes or so), it shifts into a totally different feeling movie.  It's suspenseful, dark and sinister, but not gory.  (Which I personally like).  I read on IMDB that the title was originally Lure, which I like a lot better, but I get that distributors are trying to ""lure"" in viewers with the ""teen fight club"" in the  title.

The cast is all fairly unknown, but I think they all did a great job.  I especially like Robert Baker, as Ronny and Josh Hammond, as Ray Ray.  Both really creepy, strong actors.

I really liked it!",1310601600,,771,4.521739130434782
8413399,5,B0042AGNBO,"This is an incredibly enjoyable movie on one level and subtle on another. Most will get flooded by weirdness and miss the symbol system going on. But look carefully, or watch twice. Augie Duke especially attractive, but you are going to see more of her. Girl can barely contain her energy in this role as ""the bitch"" who is broken at the end. She goes from narcissist to waif effortlessly. See it.",1306454400,3,397,4.527777777777778
8413400,4,B0042AGNBO,"Pretty girls for sure, interesting having the cop go undercover as a student and I just love how we are seeing more female stars in movies as appose o all male stars always being in the spotlight. I enjoyed this film but my only critique is not enough ""Fight Club"" We see only two fights lasting about 5 minutes total and we don't know what happened to the other girls. A cop shows up and we never see them again. What happened to the drunk girl who was left at the party? What happened to brittany? Well, there seems to be a part 2 coming out and I really hope the original cast return, because there are so many unanswered questions involving them that it needs to be answered in the second film. Good film though.",1300147200,3,716,4.272058823529412
8413401,5,B0042AGNBO,"Good movie - definitely recommend checking it out if you're into hot girls, angry girl-girl banter, and an interesting storyline.  Could've used some more fighting, but there was enough to keep it interesting.",1294531200,4,209,5.333333333333333
8413402,4,B0042AGNBO,"A Lure: Teen Fight Club has a lot going for it. This little thriller is far from perfect but it's fast, energetic and very watchable. Scan the credits and you get the sense that some of the cast and crew are new to the game, but while they misfire on some things, they get a lot right. For starters, the storyline is B movie gold: high school girls are disappearing and a female detective is sent undercover to investigate.

Jessica Sonneborn stars as the undercover detective. She is leggy and lithesome and has an expressive, interesting face. But there's more to Ms. Sonneborn than good looks - she wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film. As the lead actress, she does a good job overall, handling her action chick duties with style but also showing a nice touch with some of her quieter scenes. She is definitely one to watch!

As the undercover detective eventually discovers, the missing girls are being forced to fight to the death in an underground fight club. But before we get to the death ring, the first half of A Lure introduces us to the popular girls clique at the high school. To me, the film gets bogged down a bit here, with a few unnecessary scenes and some characters who are a bit too broadly drawn. For example, the rich girl who rules over the clique (sexy Augie Duke) and her blonde sidekick come across as ""types"" more than flesh and blood characters. But the first half has its moments, as the detective strikes up a believable friendship with the clique's quiet member (played with style by Paulie Rojas). And in a clever twist, the film introduces the character who will ultimately be revealed as the fight club's evil mastermind. All is not as it seems in this little town.

Things pick up nicely once the girls go in search of a rave party, only to get ""lured"" into a trap. Once they're captured, the game is on. But if you're hoping for nonstop chick fights, no such luck. Despite the knockout premise, A Lure doesn't spend too much time in the ring, although the first fight is exciting and nicely played. But what the film may lack in fight action, it makes up for in atmosphere. The second half strikes a nice balance of creating a sense of dark foreboding without resorting to sadism or gore like in Hostel or Turistas. Director Bill McAdams Jr., in what may be his first feature, effectively moves the action along and like the story, he hits his stride in the second half. Intercutting between the young women's plight and a male detective trying to find them, he skillfully pulls together the story threads and delivers an exciting finish.

Like many thrillers, the final scene leaves the door open for a sequel. If there will be a sequel, as long as they smooth out some rough edges and up the ante on the fighting, the team behind A Lure might just serve up a classic. Until then, watch A Lure for what it is and enjoy the ride.",1294531200,5,2875,4.512476007677543
