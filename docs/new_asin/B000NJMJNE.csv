2770009,2,B000NJMJNE,"Where do I begin?

1) Acting--pretty bad, a few characters could act, but the majority of the actors were very wooden and unconvincing.

2) The movie views as if someone had a camcorder and filmed it at a nearby forest preserve.

3) Special effects were so-so.

4) A lot of the zombies were ""let's wear a white t-shirt and throw fake blood on it."" Also, the zombies seems to have different ways to be killed. This one is stabbed in the gut, it's dead. This one is clubbed in the head, it's dead. There was no consistency as to how the zombies died.

5) The plot was okay; it's been awhile since i've seen a ""mad doctor"" trying to reanimate the dead.

6) Nudity--boobs and butts were in abundance. None of it really helped the plot along or was really even necessary, but who cares?

7) The best thing about the movie was (i have two answers):
a) when it was over, and b) the artwork on the DVD case.

The movie had a good premise and that's about it. I think the producers simply did not have the necessary funds to make this movie better than it was; mediocre at best. (Maybe they wanted it to be campy, but even campy costs money) I have viewed many a zombie movie in my day and have seen some people make an excellent low budget indie movie with little or no money.

This movie was put out by Brain Damage films and brain damage is what you'll end up with if you watch this movie.

We all know the classic zombie formula: lifeless corpses + strange expriement gone wrong = the rampaging undead. I just wish that the directors would also pay attention to a little something called pacing. I'd much rather see 70 minutes of a tight storyline than 120 minutes of unnecessary scenes and useless dialogue. Also, the acting. How do those performances EVER make it to print??

It's snickers and giggles straight to the end. The real horror doesnt begin until the Special Features. Yes, those taped auditions? Downright cringeworthy. But despite all the doom and gloom of Swamp Zombies, I will say that the fighting sequences were clever and refreshing.",1182988800,8,945,4.9

2770038,2,B000NJMJNE,"The DVD case synopsis wherein I've take parenthesis liberties to paraphrase what could still turn out to be a fairly lengthy review about this movie:

""A chief physician, (with the smallest office in chief physician history), at a large metropolitan hospital, (that apparently only serves twenty-something males with massive, fatal facial injuries), is formulating a serum, (no science to speak of), to resurrect recently deceased, (as in twelve of them died right around the same time - must have been a bus accident), patients. When his facility comes under inspection from the Federal Government, (and the receptionist refers to the inspector as being from, ""The Federal Government""), the good doctor is forced to dispose of the patients, (weakest mafia connection in mafia connection history), as quickly as possible, even though he doesn't know if the serum will be a success. Little does he know, (trite), the serum works and the test subjects begin to rise from the shallow graves of the, (random), swamplands. It will take a select few, (a cast size approaching Braveheart in numbers), to try to stop the wrath of the Swamp Zombies, but can they stay alive while doing it?""

This movie baffles me.  It's a low-budget film, obviously, but the proprietors of the project actually went for big air and pulled in some minor celebrities.  The result just came across as an oddly executed one to me.  I found myself contemplating the reasons why the adult film star, Jasmin St. Claire, handed out the best performance in the movie.  And I'm not being sarcastic.  She was the only person in this film that seemed to hold any weight with her dialogue.  I've never seen her previous work, but I'm assuming, now, that she must have had a few conversations with dishwasher repairmen in front of a camera before stepping on board with this director.  So, for what it's worth, you're now able to gauge whereabouts the glass ceiling for this movie is concerning its acting.  The woman who has sex for a living walked away with the trophy.  Everyone else was horrible.  Lines were walked on left and right, and it seemed to me that the director was making a lot of speeches about how long he'd rented the camera for, and that they were only getting, ""one shot at this, so get it right!"".  Pretty rough gig, this one.

As far as the zombie element goes, it worked out okay.  Like I mentioned before, 99% of the undead were rocking some pretty substantial face-rip.  So, you end up with a hoard of look-a-like zombies with bluish, rotted faces, and the normal hand and arms of your standard run-of-the mill white guy.  Not that you expected much to begin with, but there you go.

The violence was pretty low-key, actually.  There's a review on the cover of my DVD case that boasts a movie with gore.  I didn't see much of that, but the last movie I watched before this one was, ""Redneck Zombies"".  This pales in gore-comparison.  So do the special effects.  The blood is pretty watered down, the flesh wobbly synthetic.  One notable shrug came towards the end of the movie when one of the agents puts down a female zombie with a shot to the head.  One scene she's laying down, the next is a close-up of her forehead.  A weird close-up.  She has a hole in her head with a sort of o-ring cone base and it's shooting what appears to be a weak laser out of it.  I think it was supposed to be squirting CGI, but it failed so hard that she came out looking like a wounded cyborg.

There's also some martial arts, and by, ""some"", I mean everyone in this town knows the same wheel-kick.  But don't laugh.  This particular wheel-kick can kill a zombie.  (I shouldn't make too much fun, though.  The fighting was kind of fun to watch.)

There's nudity scattered throughout this film, even in the end credits.  It's a weird set up, though.  Jasmin St. Claire gets bare in the shower, with alarmingly fake looking breasts, and that's it for the pro.  The rest of the movie is filled with some sloppy chest shots that only the truly starved will appreciate.  And I don't mean to offend the actresses that exposed themselves in the name of, ""art"", but it just came off as tasteless and desperate.  Not a fan.

The music was awful.  Uneventful metal tracks written by the thick and interjected in their entirety so you're forced to listen to them.  It was torture.

I think my least favorite part of this movie, however, was its length.  It's two hours long, which is completely unnecessary.  There are dozens of conversations in this movie that didn't need to take place because they were poorly written and contributed nothing to the cause.  Nothing at all.  Just irrelevant banter between people that you're waiting to see die.  What else is there with a low budget film?  Cut the crap and deliver the blows.  Shorten it to about 70-90 minutes and this may be a good time, but I kind of doubt it.

In the end, it's just another forgettable zombie film with a couple bonus points for real fight-scene efforts.

I'd rent it first.

Runs almost 2 hours. Now 2 hours is a mighty long time for a low-budget zombie film. It's unsustainable for even a good one. For a bad one, it's excruciating. This movie is very much the latter in that scenario. It wouldn't be surprised in the least if this film was 'written' on the fly. The acting's no worse than most backyard epics and the fight scenes are somewhat fun, but for gods sake learn to edit.

8178573,3,B000NJMJNE,"Swamp Zombies begins by showing doctors treating a man with severe head injuries.  The guys parents show up and demand they see their son.  The doctor says he suffered severe trauma from the car accident and can't do anything for him.  A young guy takes medication in a classroom.  A girl says ""We pay for these classes- we might as well put a little effort into it"" even though her fellow classmates aren't interested in attending class.  The teacher mentions taking plant samples to a lab.

The doctors take their dead patient to the room with the other dead patients.  A woman in a pink robe says this hospital is long overdue for an inspection.  The doctor says he can't ship off his dead patients without tests or he'll have no idea what kind of product he has or which subjects are capable of what.  He doesn't like the idea of a product being released without understanding the full capability of it.  The teens take off into the woods.  The one girl says there's a bunch of stuff that shouldn't be here.  The teacher encourages his students to find samples to take back to his lab.  The teacher says some findings will be a bit unusual for this habitat.

A man walks into the hospital and says this building is long overdue for a federal inspection.  The pink robed woman is encouraged by the doctor to distract the inspection man for an hour.  The doctor tells a man who's beating someone up to dispose of several dead bodies.  The doctor suggests incineration or burying them in a lake.  The doctor says these subjects were chosen because they can't have open casket services implying their appearances aren't appropriate.

The man instructed to dispose of the dead bodies is asked to take them to the autopsy room.  However the men take them to the lake and dump them in.  A man complains they won't be able to get the bodies in the water deep enough so his friend puts heavy objects in a bag to hold the bodies down.  The one man wonders if dumping these bodies in the lake is worth the money.  His friend says ""You didn't have to kill anyone so yeah!""  The teens camp out in the woods at night.  One girl gets offended being called a gothic ho and pushes a guy down.  A shy book reader doesn't want to play with the rest of the teens.  At the hospital the pink robed woman defends herself to two strange men when she mentions she was instructed by the doctor to not let these subjects leave this point, go to the warehouse and to be monitored properly.  This is assuming the serum actually works.

A couple campers have sex in a tent when they're interrupted by sounds.  The guy assumes someone is trying to steal his weed.  He says ""I'm already taking a risk trying to grow this stuff and these kids are stealing from me?""  Suddenly a blonde zombie approaches and bites his neck.  Just then two more zombies appear and kill the woman in the tent.  Two other men and women kiss as a really cool song plays with the chorus ""The dead are watching me!""  Nice guitar work here too.  Really reminds me of the psychedelic 60's.

Meanwhile in the autopsy room a doctor is examining bite marks on a man's chest while eating a chocolate chip cookie.  He lays the cookie on the man's chest while working on the body and gets blood all over it. He wipes the cookie on his shirt, lol.  The autopsy doctor notices one of his patients has a burnt face.  The patient then comes alive and grabs the doctor's throat.  The female doctor comes in and can't find the doctor.  She picks up a knife when she sees the burnt faced autopsy man walking around.  He tosses her to the ground as the doctor wakes up and prevents her from leaving through the front door.  The pink robed woman is taking a shower and rubbing her incredibly fine body.  She takes a shower in a weird breast popping way where she insists on rubbing them.

We now see a man naked Jack doing exercise moves on his deck by the lake.  A couple guys drop by and ask if he has any electric.  He says his phones are down.  They want to borrow some walkie talkies.  Meanwhile elsewhere the teacher wants to know if the students are done finding their samples.  One guy forgot to turn the headlights off in the car resulting in a dead battery.  The teens and teacher are now stranded out here.  The teacher can't get a signal on his phone either.

A couple men fishing in a lake get quite the surprise when four zombies jump up and rock their boat, flip it over and drown them.  The doctor walks in and sees his autopsy patient walking around.  The doctor stabs his neck with a needle.  Meanwhile two teenage girls get a suntan at the beach.  The one girl says her plan is bar, beer and boys.  Suddenly the zombies attack the one woman while she's giving her friend a suntan lotion back rub by eating her legs.  The other girl runs away from the zombies but is rescued by a man who takes her hand.

Jack, the guy doing exercises, says to his female cop partner that the two men he gave walkie talkies to haven't called yet.  The federal inspector visits the doctor and says his building passed the test with flying colors.  The teens who are stranded in the woods act silly.  The one guy says he needs his pills and another teen makes fun of the guy by mocking his pill needs.  At the hospital the doctor mentions to the girl with the pink robe that it worked- the revival of subjects, but they don't have any motives.

The female cop accidentally approaches the zombies in the lake when she thinks they're the walkie talkie boys.  She defends herself really well against all 6 or 7 of them by tossing and kicking them all over the grass.  She doesn't look like she's capable of these kinds of moves based on her body build but she is!  She kicks them again with stick slaps and other moves while in the woods.  She calls for back up but honestly she doesn't need it!  She's a one woman wrecking machine!

She tries to call help but Jack can't hear with his saw running.  We now see that one man take the sunbathing girl to his home.  He tells her to try on certain clothes before fixing up the cut on her leg.  She wants to know what's up with the rough looking cannibal monsters.  When asked if he has a family we see him reflecting the good times with his family having a birthday party, playing basketball and more.  He tells the sunbathing girl ""We need to get out of here right now!""

The geeky boy who needed to return to his car for his pills sees a half naked girl approach him.  She then pushes him to the ground and bites his neck.  He loves every second of it!  The other teens meet Jack and need help getting their vehicle started.  The teacher walks alone.  He picks up a half destroyed fishing pole with blood dripping out of it.  He makes the mistake of touching the shoulder of a zombie.  The zombie then runs after the teacher.  When the teacher thinks he's safe the zombie approaches and beats him with a stick before his zombie friends munch on his body.

The teens walk back to the kid who needed his medication.  Jack viciously kicks him in the face and wants to know what kind of games they're playing and what kind of weed they're smoking.  Jack recommends the guys find his female cop friend's truck and bring it back here.  While looking at the kid who needed his medication, Jack gets swarmed by zombies but he's able to sweep and jump kick his way out of danger.  He's also quite the fighter swinging that stick of his.

Jack and the teens run to a car without any keys but the one teen girl is able to successfully hot wire it.  In the woods that man and the sunbathing girl are able to shoot several zombies approaching them.  The sunbathing girl has several kick moves as well!  The man says ""There must be half a dozen of these things!""  The doctor mentions a dead patient who died in a house fire.  He was unable to bring this body back to  life... until now.  He mentions the serum is contagious and transfers to body fluids.  Once the serum enters the body of a live individual, that individual takes on traits of the test subject.  The man having a conversation with the doctor wants to know how to reverse this situation and the doctor says ""You don't!""

The teens in the woods find their dead friend who's now a zombie.  Jack says when he arrived on the scene he saw two men and a female park ranger, and hasn't seen any of them since.  Jack says the teens car battery is shot when the two girls try to start their car.  The sunbathing girl says she wants to go with the teens to find a way out but Jack says her leg is too injured.  Jack tells the teens to stay in the car, roll up the windows and lock the doors.  He says if he's not back in 20 minutes to leave and get help.  Tell the police about the hospital's involvement.

Jack meets the park ranger.  She runs up to him... as a zombie!  She cuts the crap out of Jack and tosses him into the branches.  A couple dance-y sweep kicks and a neck break and she's gone!  When the teens in the car forget to roll up the windows (remember Jack's instructions?  Pay again teens!) they're soon pulled through the windows by zombies.  One teen is bit several times on the neck.  He screams but nobody can help him.  Meanwhile Jack, the sunbathing girl and the man with a shotgun encounter a zombie.  The man gets his neck broken, and another zombie gets shot in the head.  Meanwhile the teens notified the cops and they're awaiting their presence.  Interesting how the cops won't go to the teens and the teens have to come to them.

Jack finds the cops and they all head out together to rescue the teens and kill the zombies.  The one cop says to the other ""Remember to shoot to kill"".  The cops sneaks through the woods looking for zombies.  Suddenly the zombies sneak up on the cops so they take off running until they shoot a zombie in the forehead.  They shoot one female zombie and destroy another zombie with neck breaks and stick smacks.  One zombie gets thrown into a tree and has his kidney's punched before having his head smacked into the tree.  These cops are intense!  The one in particular with a black mustache is doing a ton of fighting and shooting.  I like when the cops shoot a zombie in the chest a bunch of times and the cop with the black mustache says ""Guys guys, in the head!""

In the doctor's office the men discuss what someone wants.  They think he's here for the paperwork.  The mysterious man with glasses says he's taking someone back this time.  He questions if tranquilizers will work.  The cute girl behind the desk says the basement is off limits due to maintenance but another guy says it'll be alright to visit the room since it's his job.  Jack visits the hospital and asks the doctor if anything is out of the ordinary.  He says no, and sites yesterday's inspection.  Jack mentions having strange altercations in the woods today.  The guy who wanted to head into the basement is shot by the two mysterious federal agents.

Here's an explanation what's going on.  An experimental drug was used to activate brain tissue after death.  In theory if the drug was injected quickly after death while the brain was still sending electrical impulses the patent would revive.  Since the brain would still be relatively fresh, the subject would still be able to receive instructions and be able to learn, yet the subject would be clinically dead with no emotion or heartbeat.  These subjects could be trained for war with the dead being sent to do our battles.  These subjects could handle any task without human's losing a life.  I like this explanation!  Great moment of the story.

Jack says he doubts it's that simple.  The doctor says he was never able to establish a time table for the drug to work.  He tried to make it between 24-48 hours and had a dozen experiments in progress but federal agents interrupted him.  Oh no!  The federal agent shoots the cute nurse in her ribs.  A zombie comes to life and attacks a screaming girl.  Jack says ""The government came in and you ditched the bodies in the swamps!""  The doctor asks if the bodies came to shore after the storm.  Jack says he's going to let the authorities sort this out.  As Jack leaves the doctor shoots him in the chest.  The doctor says it's a matter of millions in research.  The doctor says ""Look at this as donating your body to science!""

Just and the man who took in the sunbathing girl try to shoot the doctor but the doctor's stabbed in the chest by the pink robed girl.  She stabs him a bunch of times but he's able to overpower her and slam her back into the wall.  She gets the advantage and holds a knife to his neck.  She says ""The moral of this is that in science you have to make sacrifices"".  Meanwhile the sunbathing girl stabs her in the throat and says ""I always hated science class!""

The federal agent says he got the subject out of the basement and will have a chopper coming so he'll be across the border in an hour.  The sunbathing girl is told to hide in the closet and to not come out no matter what.  The guy who was just stabbed a bunch of times in the chest gets into a fight with a zombie.  He knocks the zombie down in the hallway and slams his head in a door.  He locks the door before a female zombie is able to break in.  A zombie sneaks up from behind and slaps Jack, but he's ready to respond with his kicks.  Jack slams the zombie into the table and stabs his chest and forehead.  A female zombie tries to bite a federal agent but she's shot in time.

Meanwhile Jack's on a rooftop trying to take out a federal agent, but he meets his match with this guy.  They both flash their spin kick moves.  Jack gets the advantage by twisting the guy's arm and tossing him around but the other guy really does a number on Jack by kicking him in the ribs.  Jack grabs his leg during a spin kick and tosses him down.  They strangle each other and then Jack tosses the guy off the roof!  Good thing because it looked like he was losing that match.  Jack looks to the ground and sees he tossed an FBI agent over the side.

The guy who got stabbed in the hospital meets his match as well.  The federal agent kicks him in the ribs and punches his head but he responds by punching the agent's head, dodging a spin kick and slamming him into the wall afterwards before snapping his neck.  The doctor tries to run to the helicopter by sneaking down the back stairway of the hospital.  He calls someone to meet him outside the front entrance at once.

The doctor says to Jack that the situation can still be salvageable.  An FBI agent shoots the doctor in the chest just then.  A police officer won't say what the doctor was trying to accomplish and says it's classified.  An FBI agent says he wouldn't want this nation's enemies to get their hands on the serum.  The FBI agent visits the doctor to talk about his unconscious victim.  After the doctor says he may need another subject to find out if the results of his experiment worked the unconscious man jumps up.  This implies he's a zombie.

Swamp Zombies is too long!  2 hours of kicking and throwing people around, while entertaining, is too long.  The characters are average at best, and the acting is pretty bad.  I wonder if the same writers that wrote this movie also wrote Curse of the Wolf because that's another similar looking movie with tons of kicking and punching in a high octane way.  I have a feeling the writers are the same.  I do like the story though, and the way the story switches from the teens in the woods to the doctor and his evil plan in the hospital.  I thought we'd actually see zombies coming out of the slimy dirty swamps as the biggest portion of the story and I guess we do, but not how I imagined.

However this is a hospital that experiments on reviving the recently dead. The subplot (less complex) involves students going to the swamp on a field trip to collect samples to bring back and study. The plots collide when bodies from the hospital are dumped into the lake and reanimated.

The film was too long at 2 hours and they could cut a random 30 minutes out (Not Jasmin St. Claire shower scene) and I don't think anyone would notice. It included some original ""coffee house"" style zombie songs. The main actors were fine, about college drama good, while the supporting actors were most likely walk-ons. Just because you are an EMT doesn't mean you can play one. The sound quality was uneven, having to choose between decent sound equipment and Jasmin's shower scene. I think they made the right choice, but in an alternate universe, they are getting both.  Zombies were subject to pain when they are karate kicked and hit in the soft parts, yet feel nothing when a knife goes through their hand. Consistency would be nice.
