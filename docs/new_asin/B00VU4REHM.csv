8711259,5,B00VU4REHM,"I have had the pleasure of reading books by Lee Davis and now I have watched him take his literary talents in the horror genre and put them into a movie.
You will be drawn in from the beginning. The story line flows effortlessly and will have you waiting for more. The actors did a fantastic job with limited resources and put together a movie that I say was better than some high budget cheesy horror films.
Great job!
I highly recommend. Also be sure to check out other Lee David greats like Mellisa is Home and At the Heart of Atrocity.",1433116800,,539,4.294117647058823
