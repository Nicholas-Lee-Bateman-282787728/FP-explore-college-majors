7800960,4,1888522127,"Another gem from Tom Davenport, ASHPET is a retelling of the classic Cinderella fable.  Only this time, we're in 1940s Virginia.  Ashpet is the downtrodden daughter dealing with her haughty stepmother and addlepated, boy-crazy stepsisters.  Instead of a fairy godmother, there's an old black conjure woman, Dark Sally, who inspires Ashpet (only her real name is Lily) with enough confidence to clean herself up, put on her late mother's dress, and go to the Victory Dance being held for the local soldiers before they ship off to WWII.  And of course, Prince Charming comes in the form of a handsome soldier...

Just over an hour long, this is a charming fable that kids and adults will enjoy.  There's no magic or scariness; Dark Sally's magic is in giving Lily the confidence to assert herself and to not let anyone make her feel like anything dirty.  And, like other Davenport films, it's never too cute or cloying for adults; it's a simple and heartfelt adaptation of the classic tale.

The performances are solid, if unspectacular, except for Louise Anderson who gives a zesty performance as Dark Sally.  Anderson, a professional storyteller, is the subject of a short documentary, WHEN MY WORK IS OVER, that's included on the DVD, in which she tells some of her stories and also gives a glimpse of the struggle for civil rights in the South.  There's also a behind-the-scenes documentary.  Both of these will be of interest to the adults and older kids.

Like other Davenport films, this is a worthy addition to any family's DVD collection.",1182816000,2,1546,4.881226053639847
7800961,5,1888522127,"""Ashpet"" is a Cinderella story with more wit and charm than most retellings of the tale.  This version is set pre-World War II and the prince is a soldier getting ready to go to war.  The stepmother isn't as vicious as the eldest stepsister, Thelma, who wants a husband and doesn't like housework.  Thelma is determined to use any method within her means including buying a charm from Dark Sally to wear to the Victory Dance.
My favorite element of the film is the subsitution of Dark Sally, a wise conjure-woman, into the traditional fairy godmother role. Dark Sally likes intelligent, hard-working girls, not lazy, silly girls like the stepsisters.  She asks riddles and likes to tell stories with hidden meanings to anyone smart enough to listen. In this case the heroine Ashpet, rightfully known as Lily, is a great listener.  Dark Sally doesn't use magic or charms to prepare Ashpet for the dance.  She advises a bath and an inherited dress to enhance Lily's natural beauty.
This film is wonderful for the classroom and should entertain students with romance and a familiar story, but adults will most enjoy the humor and entertaining characters.  After all, most young students will not understand right away that a trip to Niagara Falls usually meant a honeymoon during this time in history. The honeymoon trip pictures during the credits provide a great ending to a fine film.",986515200,5,1384,4.888888888888889
