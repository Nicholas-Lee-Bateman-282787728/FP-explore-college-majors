2078232,4,B0002DB4YQ,"I, Vitelloni is a early Fellini film that shows his talents as a filmmaker at creating fascinating characters and his unique ability to put those characters into situations that truly express the inner character.  This movie about 5 friends growing up in a small Italian town is a well made and written movie that is as lighthearted and free as the characters populating it, until one character makes a stupid error of judgement and the movie becomes as serious as his situation.  You feel for the characters but at the same time you feel they are too naive and careless, and that despite their age and responsiblities, they really are immature people trying to live life in limbo without worries, until the responsibilities presented to our main character become to much to bear when he ignores them, and the consequences are seen.  The movie questions what 'maturization' is and by the end you have a feeling of the quiet character througout the entire film, unsure of the answer but knowing it isn't there; the movie leaves with a question mark, and despite not living up to Fellini's following and later efforts, it is a well made if slow going movie filled with these 'vitelloni's trying to find their role in life.",1106697600,2,1220,4.7725118483412325
2078233,5,B0002DB4YQ,"This movie is one of my personal favorites of Fellini. This story is so universal even today. We all know guys like this or are/were these guys ourselves. Time Magazine just had an article about men and women in their 20's who resemble this group of friends. They don't want responsibility, don't want to get married, they just want to have fun. But at the end of the day, they want to do something with their lives. This movie shows that.

In this movie too, you start to see scenes that will reappear throughout the rest of Fellini's career. One in particular is the mambo dancing scene, which resembles the same kind of surreal quality as similar scenes in 8 1/2 and Amarcord.

All together this is an incredibly enjoyable movie, and should be a must see for any foreign movie fan. Even though this movie was made in the 1950s, its characters and situations are very relevant 50 odd years later.",1106611200,4,898,4.537037037037037
2078234,5,B0002DB4YQ,"I was a bit mislead on this one - I had read so many reviews saying how this is early Fellini and it is one of the least 'Fellini like' of Fellini's movies. Then I actually watched it - all I saw on the screed was Federico - his personality is so strong it comes out in everything he does - and this is indeed one of my new favorites. Interestingly, this and 'White Shiek' were Orson Welles' favorite Fellini movies! I think the camera work contains something that had not been seen up to that point in neo-realism - there is something in the choice of composition that seperates Fellini here from the stately angles of Visconti, and the more static pictures of Rossellini. Surely, this is a movie to be watched by all Fellini fans - and for some reason I think it contains many elements of his later films. At times I was reminded of 'Nights of Cabiria' perhaps it was the party sequence - but it seemed more in the general style of filming. Anyway, do not be mis-lead - this is classic Fellini and is, in fact, very Fellini like!",1104019200,4,1031,4.292307692307692
2078235,5,B0002DB4YQ,"A group of middle class ""yoots"" hang out together, bonded by common roots and experience, but also by the process of self-discovery as the onset of adulthood face them with the coming of responsibility and the isolation of individuality. The focus of this fracturing process falls on one guy who discovers that his girlfriend is pregnant.  If the plot sounds familiar, well it's because coming of age is a universal experience that crosses generations and cultures, and rarely fails to to produce an intense sense of nostalgia.

What differentiates Fellini's film (beyond the fact that it pre-dates similar fair from the French New Wave, British 60's, Graffiti-Flatbush-Diner, etc. whose original accessibility make them more familiar) is simply the sheer talent of the story-teller.  The man could present characters and situations that still move and enlighten us.  His later, more famous epics of excess were well grounded in this same exquisite sense of humanity.  This is the first excellent film by one of film's most excellent directors.",1103328000,11,1044,5.265060240963855
2078236,4,B0002DB4YQ,"In a seaside Italian village in the 1950's, five aging twentysomething slackers shoot pool, booze it up, yearn for bigger things, chase women and dodge both work and responsibility for as long as they can... which doesn't appear to be for much longer.

This may not have the emotional or philosophical novelistic heft of Fellini's ""8 1/2"" or ""La Dolce Vita"" -- with its episodic structure, this is more like a book of short short stories -- but it has much in common with those later films. It's vivid, beautiful rendered, wry and wise.  It's also one artist's heartfelt look at a pivotal juncture in his life -- whereas his later masterpieces analyzed the entry into middle age, ""Vitelloni"" looks at the loss of the privelages of youth.  It's gorgeous, funny and occasionally quite stinging.

This is an enormously influential film -- it's a mirror image of ""Diner"" and a clear influence on Scorsese, who borrowed subtexts and shots for ""Who's That Knocking,"" ""Mean Streets"" and -- with its gliding camera and voiceover introductions -- ""Goodfellas.""

""I Vitelloni"" hasn't been easily available in the past.  It was  a movie I always heard about and craved but was never able to get.  Criterion presents it beautifully and, while I would've liked a commentary by, say, the directors who would later pay it homage, the accompanying documentary (""Vitellisimo"" which gets surprisingly lucid remembrances from cast members) probably does a better job of setting the scene.",1102896000,5,1469,5.016460905349795
2078237,5,B0002DB4YQ,"I Vitelloni, released in 1953, is Federico Fellini's first commercially successful film and we are fortunate that the Criterion Collection decided to make it available on DVD in August of this year.

Moraldo, who looks to be in his mid-thirties, represents Fellini.  Moraldo and four of his friends hang around a seaside town in northern Italy looking for anything interesting to do to distract them from the boredom of their wasted lives.  The young men are Vitelloni, slang in Italian for loafers.  All of the young men have dreams, but not much ambition.  Only Moraldo will find the courage to break free of the paralysis that traps the young men in surroundings too comfortable to leave but with no sense of accomplishment or satisfaction.

Fellini gives us the story of each of the five men, but more attention is paid to Fausto, a womanizer who impregnates Moraldo's sister and then is forced to marry her.  Marriage is hardly an inconvenience to Fausto, who immediately cheats on his wife every chance he gets.  Moraldo knows that Fausto is unfaithful, but his allegiance to his friend is greater than to his sister.  Like Fellini, Moraldo is a careful observer of his surroundings, but does not criticize or judge what he sees.  He appears to be somewhat detached and thoughtful.  He is a good friend to have if not a protective brother to his sister.

I Vitelloni is a slice of Italian life that resonates deeply with the viewer.  Fellini organizes carefully each scene and then allows his actors the freedom to bring to life the characters they represent.  His confidence in his actors is repaid by superb performances from each member of his cast.  For the first time we see and experience his enormous talent as a director.  His next film, the great La Strada, and then later such superb films such as La Dolce Vita and Amarcord, confirm his importance as a director of the first rank.

With the release of I Vitelloni, the Criterion Collection continues to provide a valuable service for the lovers of great, classic films.  Fans of Federico Fellini are sure to enjoy this first glimpse of the master at work.  Highly recommended.",1100822400,8,2143,4.806010928961749
2078238,5,B0002DB4YQ,"Since I've gotten this DVD I must have watched this film 15 to 20 times. No lie. This is a great film. Even though it is not a flawless film it is in my mind Fellini's second best. First place go's to La Strada. My only complaint is that I wish Criterion made this one a two disc set. This one deserves a double disc.
I love every single character in this film. I love every single scene in this film. I love the brilliant score by Nino Rota.
I give this one 5 stars.",1096761600,5,467,3.9263157894736844
2078239,5,B0002DB4YQ,"Trapped in a timeless sphere without pressure of accomplishment, maternal love nurses five men way past their adolescence in a small tourist town by the Adriatic Sea in post-war Italy.  These five men drift around dreaming of an escape from the town, but a lack of motivation keeps them prisoners at the seaside location.  The mutual motivations for the five men that keeps them adrift are women, wine, and the stories they tell each other.  However, each character has his own motivating factor that drives him forward in daily life.

The group of the five men consists of Fausto (Franco Fabrizi), Alberto (Alberto Sordi), Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste), Riccardo (Riccardo Fellini), and Moraldo.  The group's leader Fausto, a perpetual flirter, has gotten a young beautiful woman pregnant.  Fausto's father insists that he do the right thing and marry the girl before she is disgraced in public.  The lazy Alberto is the groups clown who is dependent on his mother whom he will never leave.  Alberto frequently pleads for money from his sister as he is continuously broke.  Eventually Alberto finds out that his sister has a married lover and it angers him.  Leopold an aspiring writer and the intellectual of the group dreams of fame and success.  The singer Riccardo follows the group on its nightly adventures.  Moraldo is a philosophical moralist that wanders the streets at night deep in thought as he sees faults in the way they all live life.  However, Moraldo has not yet found the courage to leave the small seaside town.

I Vitelloni is the second film that Fellini directed by himself which he also co-wrote with his talented brother, Riccardo Fellini.  Riccardo and Federico based the script on semi-autographical accounts from their home town and a life which they both were very much inclined to depict.  Unlike many of Fellini's later films I Vitelloni displays some of the Italian neo-realistic cinematic qualities that were common in the period when the film was shot.  The realism brings an honest and warm atmosphere to the film which emphasizes the true nature of the characters.  Realism in the script allows the audience is to experience an examination of the different characters in the film.  This character study brings the audience candid emotions and a brilliant cinematic experience that warms the heart as there are hopes and dreams for us all.",1094947200,43,2372,5.005102040816326
2078240,5,B0002DB4YQ,"This is a great movie that Fellini made early in his career. It's about a group of young men living in a small Italian town. Each one of them has a dream of his own but none of them takes action to make the dream come true. I personally found it to be very witty. Oh and Fellini's own brother is acting in this one, which is interesting. It's a must-see for Fellini fans, even if you are not it's an enjoyable movie that's worth seeing.",1094688000,2,436,4.0813953488372094
2078291,5,B0002DB4YQ,"The impressive third film by Federico Fellini, I vitelloni, is one of his most accessible because it has less typical Fellini-esque qualities; even as an adoring Fellini fan, I recognize that not everyone would necessarily enjoy his whimsical, surreal, and fantastical depictions of Italian life. This movie, about five young men in postwar Italy, exhibits more neorealism common to other Italian directors of that time. Its groundedness makes it almost feel not like a Fellini film.

The structure of the film, like later Fellini, is rather fluid and lacks the traditional plot you expect; there is not really a beginning, middle, or end, but rather a series of vignettes showing the relationship among these men. We see their romantic, creative, and professional prospects throughout nearly two hours with them, told with wit and realism. It is a picture into typical Italian life for a very particular subset of the population: late twentysomething / early thirtysomething men.

This may be a result of the release date of the film (in the early 1950s), but the chronology and age of the characters plays an interesting role in our perspective of them. In Italian, vitelloni is slang for slackers, and these men certainly fit that bill, loafing through life rather aimlessly. Given that one of the men turns 30 during the course of the film, we can calculate backwards and figure out that these men would have just been too young (under 18) when World War II hit. Their experience was vastly different than those just older than them, and did not experience the hardships and devastation of war abroad. This theme is evident in their relationships with those older than them, as the men lack the discipline and seriousness of their parents.

In addition to their immaturity by age, we also see the recurring Fellini theme of reckless and insensitive masculinity. The standard tropes of Italian machismo, of being overbearing and aggressive towards women and overall arrogance are shown in all the young men. These negative qualities, however, do backfire and they are forced to deal with the consequences.

While not his most memorable or even one of his best works, Federico Fellini's I vitelloni is still a great piece of art, reflective of its time and culture.",1372809600,,2267,5.0212765957446805
2078292,5,B0002DB4YQ,"Felini's films often carry with them this universally felt weight of humanity, as if you can feel the life lessons spilling from every frame due to the fact that you can ultimately relate to these characters and understand their plights.  This early lesser masterpiece is no different.  I label it a `lesser' masterpiece because it lacks the dynamic nature of films like `8 ' and `La Dolce Vita' but still maintains the earnest honesty that his films are synonymous with.

In `I Vitelloni' we are introduced to five friends with varying degrees of laziness that dwell in an Italian neighborhood where their slacking nature is being driven to an end by the imposing walls of life.  Fausto knocked up Moraldo's sister and attempts to leave town but is forced to marry her and take up a job at a local religious gift shop.  Fausto's philandering ways are a problem though and threaten to derail his marriage and his life henceforth.  Alberto is struggling to keep peace in his home as he battles with his adulterous sister as she pursues a relationship with a married man.  Moraldo is trying to keep his friends in line, but especially reel in his new brother-in-law, and Leopold (and aspiring writer) and Riccardo (a talented singer) try to keep up with their feisty friends.

While at times the film can feel scattered, it all comes together in such an organic way, and these characters are all given so much light (although Alberto and Fausto are certainly the more developed characters).  Alberto Sordi is sensational as the deeply affected Alberto, and Franco Fabrizi anchors this film in such a suavely unlikable way as the complicated Fausto.

The technical aspects are all well placed, with a rapturous score and delightful cinematography, but it is Felini's direction and grasp of the material that makes this film so special.  It is a deeply personal film for Felini (semi-autobiographical) and it shows in the love poured into every frame!",1369699200,,1947,4.887537993920972
2078293,5,B0002DB4YQ,"""I Vitelloni"" is a tragicomic look at the life of five young men in a small provincial town in Italy. Leisurely fun, boredom, listlessness and frustrated ambition define their lives. They want to leave their provincial town and live life to the fullest in a city. But they cannot. There is always some reason, good or bad, to hold them back. Love and an early marriage for Fausto (Franco Fabrizi), duty to stay behind and allay the worries of a mother and sister for Alberto (Alberto Soldi), loyalty to close friend and brother-in-law Fausto and protecting Fausto's marriage to his sister Sandri (Leanora Ruffo) for Moraldo (Franco Interlenghi), writing that significant play that will be a ticket out of this town into the high culture of the cities for Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste) who is at the brink of writing a significant play but is almost always never quite there, and continuous distractions for Ricardo (Ricardo Fellini). Each one believes they will get out but they just cannot undo the meandering and stultifying influence of their provincial town and their loyal gang of friends who cannot be anything more than mere ""loafers"".

Fausto is the leader of this group of idlers. He is thirty and the only skill he can boast is his ability to seduce just any lady in town he sets his heart on. He does his philandering bit without guilt. Early in the film his roving eye gets the better of him - we learn that he has gone too far with the beautiful Sandri. When Sandri is ""expecting"", Fausto is forced to consider delaying his plans of going out into the world and make the most of his life. If he had his way he would take the next train out of town. He even impulsively tries to run away but his disciplinarian father stops him. Fausto is run back to the altar. As Ricardo says, Fausto is a passionate man, and he really does not mean any harm. He may be a ladykiller when he has his way but we see him reduced to a boy more than willing to admit remorse and take his father's invectives with child like remorse. He dutifully marries Sandri. He is even happy that he is marrying her, since the wedding day, its festivities, the momentary spot light it offers is not as bad as he thinks it is. Morover, he does love Sandri in his own way.

Fellini's magic is at full play in ""I Vitelloni"" with his definitive creation of an Italian ""Dmitri Karamazov"". A man who is in love with life. His relentless appetite for women hardly has a trace of furtiveness or malice about it. He is no Don Juan. A seducer set on ruining the lives of his victims. There is an innocent flirtatiousness about the protagonist Fausto. He is the personification of sensuality and he cannot help himself as he moves from submitting to one ""temptation"" to another.

His lack of furtiveness is evident when he does all this unabated in front of his brother-in-law Moraldo. His friends know he is just being himself. He does not intend to harm Sandri. How could he since he is only doing what he has always seemingly done. Why resist what is natural? This is one way to describe Fausto. But after his marriage the sense of furtiveness in his exploits grows. He cannot help but feel guilty about it. Much of Fellini's nuance as a storyteller is fully at display here. He documents this delicate unraveling of a man who is gradually growing up to the realization of ""duty"" and ""love"". It is touching to see the growth of ""Fausto"". He has that all embracing craving to ""know"" women and this ravenous appetite to""know"" in this sense ties him to the legendary Faustian figure. Sandri is his Gretchen. Sandri and now his ""bambino"" offer him a new kind of happiness. He is on the brink of losing it all. The core drama of this film is seeing if he ends up like Faust, damned eternally.

And Sandri played by Leanora Ruffo has that element of beauty that Fellini alone can bring alive. It is not just her wonderful looks; Her's is a sensuous beauty. But there is something much deeper. And this quality is given to her by the character that is spun out by Fellini's incomparable cinematic eye. He has a way of resurrecting beauty that is unlike anything I have seen in cinema. There is the undefinable purity about her that reminds me of Giulietta Masina's Gelsomina character in ""La Strada"". Beauty's innocence takes on a secret rage when it is wronged. Beauty looks sacred here. Sandri's innocence takes on a real power in this sense towards the end of the film. And we respond to that power as much as Fausto and everyone around her does. With a broken heart. This response could only happen in a Fellini film. This mixture of amusement and light heartedness that these characters initially evoke changes to a growing heaviness. I respond to some characters in Dostoevsky and Shakespeare in the same way.

If only Fellini had adapted a Dostoevsky film! He has that marvelous comic sense that changes to deep tragedy. Fellini is in love with the ""fool"", the ""idiot"", that we encounter in Russian novels and Elizabethan plays. If he had tried his hand in directing Shakespeare and Dostoevsky it would have surely resurrected a different philosophy of adaptation preached often by Nietzsche. It takes a great artist to breathe life into the great works of the past. Only great artists can be great interpreters. Seeing ""I Vitelloni"" I can only dream what this great filmmaker could have done to the business of Shakespeare and Dostoevsky criticism. At the very least he would have kept the likes of Visconti and Kurosawa company.",1358812800,,5499,4.624360286591607
2078294,5,B0002DB4YQ,"When you consider what most other films of the time were like it is remarkable (though it must have been influenced by other neo-realists).  As a subject matter, it would have appeared to been aged in the 1960's when everyone left for Germany and Switzerland but we have come full circle and today another generation (of ""big babies"") is home with their parents.",1347667200,,362,4.746031746031746
2078295,3,B0002DB4YQ,"I Vitelloni is not great cinema, but it is an important film in the Fellini canon, biographically, in its ability to be a Rosetta Stone to other key moments and images in later films of his. It is a film that, at first blush, seems like a simple melodrama, but upon rewatch shows colors not seen the first time. It also augurs a theme that Fellini would satirize to grand fruition in La Dolce Vita, his masterpiece: the anomy of modern human existence. There was a time when life was arranged- marriages and apprenticeships. But Fellini was alive at the time that changed, and the modern loner was born. It would take a landsman- Martin Scorsese- in a different country, to realize the end results of that anomy, in his masterpiece, Taxi Driver. But without the vitelloni there is no Mean Streets nor Travis Bickle. You got a problem with that?",1339027200,,844,4.596026490066225
2078296,5,B0002DB4YQ,"This film is a must-have for any fan of Fellini.  His second film under his complete control, it was his first large success and established him as a European cultural force.  Beyond that legacy, it is a great story and has only a mild dreamy quality to it, which would become his trademark later.

The principal characters are a group of childhood friends who are no longer young.  With the exception of the singer, they are all unemployed and still living with their parents, even though they are entering their 30s.  They still love to hang out, never follow through on their dreams to leave their dinky seaside town, and seek one night stands rather than relationships.  They cannot make real choices, are frustrated with the families they cannot leave and are dependent upon, and prefer to build some unrealizable future in their imaginations.

While trying to disappear on a train out of town, the principal character is forced to marry the sister of his best friend, a beautiful girl whom he has gotten pregnant.  However, though married and in a deadend shop job his father in law found for him at his best friend's business, he continues on in the same way, chasing girls even when out with his wife, getting into stupid schemes to make a quick buck, and partying with his friends rather than returning home.  Once his baby is born, he really messes up, staying out all night with one of his lovers and getting caught stealing from his employer (after coming on to his wife, a lovely older woman).  This leads to a crisis, perhaps the first of his life, and he has to decide whether or not to grow up.  (I reveal nothing here as this is on the jacket blurb.)

This kind of immature man may strike AMerican viewers as outlandish, if not unbelievable.  These guys, they say, are still living with their mothers!  Nonetheless, after having lived in Italy for 4 years, I can say that there are plenty of men like that, indeed that it is typical even for married couples to live with their parents or in-laws for decades, in large part because their wages are so low that they can't afford an apartment of their own.  The mother continues to control the life of her son, cleaning and cooking for him to chagrin of many a new wife.  For example, one of our friends who was getting divorced said, ""I just hope I can find a 40-year old man who doesn't still live with his mother.""  She wasn't joking and you can imagine how mature they might be.  Here Fellini has portrayed this mentality, with humor and pathos, better than any other fiction I have ever seen.

Warmly recommended.  This is the work of one of the greatest artists of the 20C, when he was finding his voice.",1292544000,,2674,4.542797494780793
2078297,4,B0002DB4YQ,"I decided to start my Fellini collection with this, his first big release, on a definitive DVD version from Criterion. First of all the Criterion edition may be the best available version of the film but it does have problems that were transferred from the original. Most irritating is at scene/camera angle changes where the frame skips or jumps, just as though the original print had been poorly spliced or damaged at a splice. I don't expect Criterion to fill in gaps from missing frames but I do expect them to take the frames that are available and make sure they are registered properly in the correct location for duplication into digital format, so that the frames don't jump when watching the DVD.

Once into the film these problems can be ignored, as the story and characters are somewhat interesting. Having seen several of his later films and knowing this to be a tale of a group of friends in an Italian town, I expected a quirky and amusing comedy. Instead the film struck me as a precursor to those later, great films. It is like a pencil sketch made by an artist prior to them painting a masterpiece. The sketch relays the basic idea of the masterpiece but lacks color, depth, and appropriate detail.

Rather than being a solidly amusing tale Vitelloni seems to play along the border between drama and comedy, never venturing solidly into humor. The only amusing scene that comes to mind is when a famous but over-the-hill actor asks one of the group, a struggling writer, to sit on the pier with him so that the writer can read his play to the actor. The young writer suddenly senses the actor may be interested in more than just the play, and runs off.

As a drama the characters' lives and stories don't seem well enough developed to hold the entire film together. My overall impression is that the film is interesting, especially to a Fellini fan, but likely leaves the average American viewer unfulfilled and unimpressed.  Because of this I can only give it four stars when I would happily give his later films six.",1236384000,,2036,4.647222222222222
2078298,5,B0002DB4YQ,"A `vitello' is a veal calf, one year of age or less and not yet weaned.  A `vitellone' is an overaged or overgrown unweaned calf -  and also is slang for a young man who remains sheltered and inactive and has yet to create a real life of his own.  This 1953 film is an obvious source for every subsequent movie about young men who stay in the shelter of family and neighborhood, failing to live really autonomous lives despite their pretensions, `Diner' and `Breaking Away' among them.

This film also tells us a lot about how far Italian society has come in just 8 years since Italy served as a major battlefield in World War II.  Earlier Italian films like The Bicycle Thief (1948) Germania Anno Zero (1948) and La Terra Trema (1948) were about the brutal struggle for barest survival.  But this film is very different: it is about the problem of options and choice, problems that do not become paramount until the society has, for many of its members, already solved the survival issue.

In La Strada (1954) Fellini returns to look at those for whom survival remains a brutal struggle.  But by La Dolce Vita (1960) he is looking at the problems of alienation and anomie for a society that now creates a newly wealthy upper middle class, as did Antonioni's l'Avventura of that same year.  The growing prosperity and change in Italian society can be seen in the progression from the films of 1948 to the films of 1960.

Fellini's look at Italians and Italian society is, as always, laceratingly satiric.  But it is also clear that this satirist enjoys and feels a great fondness for that which he is satirizing.  Like Nights of Cabiria (1957), I Vitelloni has worn very well over the years.  Both of those films stand up well beside the more reknowned La Strada and La Dolce Vita.  The first great Fellini film, this is a beautiful, warm and funny classic.",1217289600,5,1857,4.587878787878788
2078299,5,B0002DB4YQ,"Il vitelloni was another evidence of the vital creativity of FEFE: Filmed just eight years after the bloody WW2, it mirrors the way of living of four inseparable friends, whose main leader -Faust-is forced to marry with Sandra, after she is pregnant. He will be forced to get a job to maintain his family, but his obsessive spirit of seduction will lead him at the edge of disaster.  Then, every member of this peculiar group must follow his own bliss. One of them -Leopoldo - is a sensitive intellectual, who intends to write a dramatic play; while Moraldo as the brother of Sandra, remains between the fidelity to his friend and his duty as brother .

Somehow, this winner film in Venice Festival 1953, might be the Italian answer to ""Rebel without cause"" , when a raising generation emerged after the ashes of the War, simply lived out the social conventions, and living freely without restrictions.

But the way Fellini builds this admirable movie, taking into account the little and profound divergences around the familiar circle (as we may realize in the case of the sister of Alberto who has fallen in love with a married man)carves in relief , the devastating consequences of  such dramatic shock that permeated all the layers of the society.

One of the most important films in the first stage of this genial filmmaker. And please, just think in those films such as Vincent, Francois, Paul and the others directed by Claude Sautet 1974; We loved each other, 1985 directed by Ettore Scola, or Monicelli `s film (My friends  and realize the deep influence of this gem of 1953 over these movies.",1194134400,2,1602,4.765342960288809

Drawing on his own beginnings, Fellini creates one of the crowning coming-of-age stories, a meditation on the bonds of loyalty, friendship, and home that features early glimpses of the maestro's fascination with all things carnivalesque, and a memorably bittersweet farewell. This, Fellinin's breakthrough film, is one of the director's more human and accessible works.",1182816000,2,629,6.241379310344827
2078325,4,B0002DB4YQ,"I Vitelloni signalled Fellini's move away from neo-realism, with all the trademarks (dwarves, older women, outrageous costumes, anecdotes replacing narrative) that would later become so exaggerated making brief and more naturalistic appearances in his apparently aimless tale of a bunch of time-wasting friends in a small coastal town where the biggest events are growing a moustache or sideburns. That it somehow becomes more than the sum of its parts is quietly magical in its own way, and the amiably dry narration linking the events and non-events underlines the ebb and flow of the film nicely. Oddly enough, I was struck by the similarities to Tony Hancock's later 'The Punch and Judy Man,' which seems to touch on several aspects of small-town inertia without ever hitting the same heights.

Criterion's DVD offers a superb transfer with a good retrospective documentary Vitellonismo which reveals a surprising degree of studio opposition to casting Alberto Sordi (then thought to be box-office poison after the disastrous commercial failure of Fellini's The White Sheik with the actor  but whose career would virtually be made by the film) as well as the original theatrical trailer, stills gallery and booklet.",1181779200,4,1219,5.34375
2078326,5,B0002DB4YQ,"Barry Levinson's ""Diner"" must have been inspired by this ground-breaking work of genius from 1953 written by Federico Fellini. Both ""I Vitelloni"" and ""Diner"" are about five males who linger somewhere between childhood and manhood, sensing the greater world beyond their small domain, but who are incapable of breaking out of the protective comfort of what they know so well. Both directors are known to have given their actors little in the way of direction. Both accepted their actors on their own terms, as the people they were, and let them embody the characters they played as naturally as water embraces the shape of the objects it fills. For me, ""I Vitelloni"" is by far the greater work. It's the template from which every other work about aimless youth has been pressed. Much of what takes place in this movie is autobiographical, and some of it is coaxed from Fellini's dreams and passions. As a great artist, Fellini changed the way we see ourselves, and the word ""vitelloni"" itself became a new expression for soft, well-fed young people with no direction. Only his second film, the first being the box-office flop ""The White Sheik,"" starring Alberto Sordi, Fellini took his sweet time putting this together. He shot it over a period of four months in various locations, none of which was Rimini, the city of his youth. He was just 30 years old, full of wit, spontaneity, humor, and joy, all of which would slowly fade away with the oncoming years. Alberto Sordi again appears here, even though he was obviously not liked by the viewing public, but he is triumphant as Alberto. In fact, there isn't a weak performance anywhere to be found in this fantastic cast. Entertaining from the opening moment to the closing poignant scene, this masterpiece is all about a specific group of young Italian men, almost a leisure class supported by their families, who must come to terms with women, their dreams, their families, and themselves. And it is about a much larger theme: what makes up a meaningful life? For one character who eventually leaves this small town, Moraldo, the search itself for meaning draws him away. Moraldo is, in fact, a stand-in for Fellini, as he left Rimini at the age of 17 to seek his fortunes in Rome. What meaning he found was in his cinematic art, his writing, and his directing. We are privileged to bear witness to that genius by viewing the treasures that sprang from his mind.
And in particular, this version of the movie on ""The Criterion Collection,"" put out in 2004, provides us with wonderful insights into this work as well as informative interviews from original cast members and the assistant director. I personally couldn't ask for more.
If you want to see a true cinematic masterpiece, get this movie. If you don't like it, check to see if you're still breathing.",1169942400,6,2811,4.797938144329897
2078327,5,B0002DB4YQ,"I Vitelloni, Frederico Fellini's earlier movie and a winner at the Venice Film Festival, portrays five grown men who live in a coastal city who don't want to face growing up. They are adults but they don't act like adults. They spend idle time hanging out and coming home in the later night. The cad Fausto gets Miss Mermaid Sandra pregnant and he has to marry her. However this doesn't stop him from being a cad. He continues his little exploits until it gets him in trouble with the boss when he finds out that he has hit on his wife. Alberto was the comical juvenile of the group. He entertained the crowd with his antics. He was also compassionate towards his mother and his sister. When his sister leaves with her lover, both he and his mother are devastated. Looking at this part, the sister was the sole income earner and it was time for her to get a life of her own. Alberto couldn't forever rely on her for money and getting away was the best thing for her to do; even it meant running off with a married lover.

Riccardo, played by the director's brother, just sang and enjoyed the company of the men. There wasn't much centered around his character and it was for the best because the movie would've taken longer and it would have strayed from what the movie itself is about. Leopoldi, the intellectual of the group, had opportunities to leave and begin his playwriting career. But sometimes letting go can be hard to do. Your friends are your source of support. But friends can sometimes let you down. And there's Moraldo. He is the youngest one of the group. But he is the observant of the gentlemen and their actions. He has to be the one to keep them in line. Even this can be a burden on him. Especially when he sees his close friend Fausto cheat on his sister. Moraldo was more grown up than the rest of the fellows. He knew that it was his time to leave Rimini and live his own life.

This isn't my first time seeing a Fellini movie. He is an ingenuine talented director who isn't rigid. He uses imagery to express reality as he did in ""Juliet of the Spirits"". Don't just watch the movie itself. Watch the documentary as well. It gives you insight as to how this movie came to fruition.",1162684800,4,2204,4.373170731707317
2078328,5,B0002DB4YQ,"This is a tale of provincial Europe. It's Italy according to Fellini but it could be Spain according to Berlanga, same years. The general impression is the same: a melancholic, tender-hearted remembrance of bygone times.

I Vitelloni (the guys) is a bunch of provincial young men who don't want to grow up. They linger in an idyllic town living their joyful and careless lives. But the world does not stop even if they have. Life brings many changes and responsibilities which they don't want to face, not yet. But they all will have to, inevitably.

This is such a good movie because it's story is the story of every human being who wakes up one day and realizes that he is the master of his own life; and here's the kick, a life that calls for making choices and bearing their consequences.

Its a very humorous and, at the same time, sad story. Young men who don't want to grow up, who don't want to work, simply because there's no urgent need to do it (work as last resource). This is also a good portrait of family life and social conditions in Western Europe after the Marshall Plan had been implemented.

I love Fellini's movies (most of them) specially because of this harmless and innocent way of critizicing -if not just simply depicting- his world. I Vitelloni is greatly appreciated by Martin Scorsese in his documentary about Italian cinema, which is what made me interested in this movie in the first place.

2078329,4,B0002DB4YQ,"Somewhere on his way from neo- to sur-, young Federico Fellini had made a ""I Vitelloni"" (1953), lighthearted, unconventional, bold, and above all entertaining film that tells the story of hopes and miseries of four friends, four young men, ""I Vitelloni"" in a small seashore province town. ""Vitellone"" means ""idle young person of the provinces, often an eternal student"". The title matches its characters very well. They live in the town where nothing much happens; they don't have jobs and spend the money given by their loving families. They have the most ardent hopes and they face the cruel disappointments. They are different - cynical skirt chaser Fausto who is forced to marry a girl pregnant with his baby; the intellectual and ambitious Leopoldo who dreams of becoming a famous writer; the irresponsible ""big child"" Alberto (Alberto Sordy, the famous comic, absolutely wonderful in his early role), and Moraldo, the only one of the group who in the final scene will leave the town of his childhood to start a new life.

I loved I Vitelloni. Nino Rota's music is above any words (as always) as well as the young director's camera work, the character study and acting. I think of ""I Vitelloni"" as more realistic and sober ""Amarcord"" in B/W. One of scenes was absolutely stunning -the carnival - the music, the dancing, the camera's rapid but fluid movements - simply breathtaking.

It is without doubt that Fellini influenced a lot of directors, and there are similarities between ""I Vitelloni"" and George Lucas' ""American Graffiti"" and Barry Levinson's ""Diner"". Stanley Kubrick and Marin Scorsese both named ""I Vitelloni"" as one of their favorite films.

Highly recommended: 9/10 (or 4.5/5)",1151539200,4,1697,5.053571428571429
2078330,5,B0002DB4YQ,"Federico Fellini's first film to gain recognition, and he hasn't quite reached his stride yet. It's about five shiftless men in a provincial Italian town who never grow up and accept responsibility. The movie centers around Fausto, a womanizer, who even after marriage (it's a shotgun wedding) roves after other women. Most of the other men aren't much to write home about, either: one (Leopoldo) is a playwright churning out awful plays and dreaming they'll be performed someday (not on this planet), and another (Alberto) still lives with his mom and sister.  Only one of them has the courage to leave this wasteland at the movie's end, and his poignant farewell scene is the highlight of the movie. I found it difficult to be drawn into the plight of these men; perhaps it's because their empty lives and wasted dreams are just so hopeless and depressing. The musical score is excellent (tip-of-the-hat to the last reviewer): the main theme is very beautiful and haunting.",1137628800,2,975,4.945121951219512

The score adds emotional depth to many of the poignant scenes, underscores the humor in others, and never becomes an unwanted distraction as with most modern film scores.  I especially liked the way the ""Sioux Mambo"" is used as a prelude to each of Fausto's ""turning points.""

It's easy to see why this film has spawned so many imitations and inspired many directors, especially Martin Scorsese - a director who knows how to weave music into the fabric of his films as if it were an additional character.

One last point on Scorsese, when the Vitelloni are introduced in the beginning it was impossible for me not to think of the same introduction technique used in Goodfellas.

Great use of locations, a very good cast, brilliant cinematography, but most of all a great evocative score make I, Vitelloni well worth the price of admission and worthy of repeated viewings.",1124668800,4,954,4.757575757575758
2078332,4,B0002DB4YQ,"Five lonely guys . . .  what you see is what you get,  In 1956, America was just about ready for I VITELLONI and its release in New York heralded a new breakthrough in what was still being called :neo realismo,"" and Fellini's name was starting to be bandied about as one of the best young neo-realist directors.  The success of this film, sometimes played as ""The Bachelors"" provokes the release of his previous film (the first) in a badly dubbed and cut up copy which gave no hints of the richness of his compositions or even his plot line.  Today we are blessed with the sense of what came after, and sometimes people come to this film expecting to see the later Fellini of HULIET OF THE SPIRITS or 8  and oh, are they in for a shock.  Here it is a tamer Fellini, without the wild flights of fancy and without, I expect, the huge budgets either.  Some say that Riccardo, Federico's brother and the originator of the screenplay, kept the realist flame burning longer than Federico, whose soul was more poetic and surrealist.  Here, the guys are pretty dreary.  Sure, one or two of them have that Italian charm and appeal that (in later films) Fellini brought out of Mastroianni, but as a group they are pretty lackluster.

Their different problems are handled oh so simply.  One is a ladies man who can't keep it in his pants even after he gets married.  Another is the brother of the betrayed wife, but he too is so charmed by Fausto that he never even complains.  All of these guys seemed like mama's boys to US audiences of the mid-1950s, when most men were looking for their own place to live as soon as they turned 18, not hanging on at home till one's parents died, but such was the socio-economic climate in postwar Italy, when housing construction was at an all-time low after the Fascist building boom of 1928-1940.  There simply wasn't any place for young people to live.  And also, in a Church dominated country, there was no place to make love or even have a moment's privacy.  One's social life was held in bars, restaurants, on the streets, or in musical settings.  There was a colorful street life, but in this movie at least, not much fun.  Everyone works and lives for the weekend.  It makes the drudgery of MYSTIC PIZZA look like ROMAN HOLIDAY.

I saw this film in a cinema club made up of five guys whose lives were all pretty much like the men in this movie, except we were all 14 and they look like they're pushing 40.  Tom Piazza has a terrific essay in this edition, that will explain better than I can where the picture fits into Fellini's career and what it means to European cinema as a whole.",1117497600,,2620,4.427974947807933

You think, ""How can these men be so silly, so irresponsible, so wanton, so self-deceived? What is the point of this?"" And, of course, you become involved in their lives while vaguely disapproving, until, you find yourself hoping that things turn out allright, because, after all, you end up loving them.
Atmospheric scenes of great delicacy and understanding, combined with the Fellini circus of sights and sounds creates a film that might be compared to the much later ""Amarcord"". They share a similar setting, and some similar characters. Both films are an imagined Rimini. Fellini said that the Rimini he created in these two films is more real than the actual Rimini he grew up in as a child.

I usually love Fellini's imagery, even though many of his films lack an identifiable narrative, but I Vitelloni was without much to look at and the characters were almost all losers.  I found it difficult to sustain interest in watching this film and wish I had chosen one of Fellini's other early films instead.",1429574400,,359,4.790322580645161
8026529,5,B0002DB4YQ,"Many critics have asserted that though I VITELLONI is an early masterpiece, it is the least Fellini-esque film. Be that as it may be, there are many of Fellini's fully developed touches to be had in this utterly charming work: sympathy for the working class, a jaundiced view of the middle class, a less than reverent regard for religion and, an hilarious obsession with people eating. Yes, these are not unique to Fellini, but he uses them with characteristic panache and an obvious sympathy for even the victims of his satire.

I Vitelloni (the young calves) live an indolent life in what is taken to be the town of Rimini on the Italian Adriatic coast. They consist of a philosopher, a singer, a (bad) playwright, a rou&eacute;, and the narrator, a man of no obvious direction but the only one of them who questions the direction of his life (thought to be an avatar of Fellini himself whose home town was Rimini). But these are superannuated adolescents (the rou&eacute; Fausto -- played by Franco Fabrizi -- states to another character that he is thirty years old). They need to grow up and stop living off their relatives, they fear work, but they seem to think they are above it all (an old theme, of course).

Rather than tell the story here (as others have done) my aim is to encourage people unfamiliar with this film to give it a try. One senses the fear of what would happen if I Vitelloni ever fully engaged in life and become adults. There is plenty of drama, but under all of it is a sense of humor that is sometimes mocking, sometimes sympathetic, and sometimes just plain funny. This is illustrated by particular incidents (no spoilers here) concerning, among others, Fausto's serial womanizing, the playwright's somewhat ghastly but ultimately funny encounter with an itinerant ham actor who purports to be interested in the young man's play, a purloined religious statue that gives rise to some great sight gags, and so on. Oddly enough Moraldo (Franco Interlenghi) the narrator should be the noble, dispassionate one, and to a certain extent he is, but he is as directionless as the rest and he participates in some shady activities as well as being a moral coward when it comes to his own sister -- Fausto's wife. He seems to own the end of the movie, but even then he is upstaged by the teenage train station worker who is much older in wisdom than any of 'the young calves'.

The Criterion edition is beautifully restored as Criterion is won't to do. The cinematography, especially of the deserted streets of the night, is outstanding. The interior shots are well done and the exterior ones are usually okay but could have used a UV filter. But every scene makes the view feel the physical ambiance: the heat of the interiors, the humidity of the night, the alternating dampness and aridity of the streets. Not every cinematographer is capable of this virtuosity but Otello Martelli, Luciano Trasatti and Carlo Carlini do well.

The Criterion print was, according to the liner notes, created on a C-Reality from a 35mm composite fine-grain print. Many accumulated artifacts were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System and the soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from a 35mm optical track and other audio tools deleted many pops, crackles, clicks and hiss. The liner notes are smugly written -- enough said. The only really glaring omission from the Cast list is that of the legendary Lida Baarova who plays the wife of Fausto's boss. In Italian with English subtitles.

8026531,5,B0002DB4YQ,"I vitelloni (1953) is Federico Fellini's first masterpiece, the film which put his name on the map as a director of significance. It triumphed at the Venice Film Festival and was widely admired abroad. It is the final film in what Fellini expert Peter Bondanella calls his `Trilogy of Character'. The first (Variety Lights [1950]) was co-directed with Alberto Lattuada and the second (The White Sheik [1952]) was a sophisticated comedy. Both are very good, but were box office failures and it was with some relief that I vitelloni at last hit the jackpot so enabling the following La strada (1954) and Le notti di Cabiria (1957) to be made. These two films won Oscars for Fellini and together with the astonishing success of La dolce vita (1959) catapulted him into iconic celebrity status, his name becoming a global phenomenon.

The `Trilogy of Character' focuses on willfully eccentric characters and the clash between the public role (the 'face') they have to maintain to get along in society and their more authentic real selves as expressed (or exposed) through fantasies, ideals, dreams and instincts. To this end Fellini plays `false' sober propriety up against the `true' liberating fantasy of make believe. In Variety Lights it is the fantasy of the variety theater, in The White Sheik the romantic escape of photoromanzi (photo novels of actors playing in exotic Arabian Nights-type adventures). In I vitelloni, Fellini puts before us scenes in a beauty contest, a cinema, a carnival and a variety theater, which expose character flaws in a group of 6 young men stuck in a provincial seaside town. These people are indolent wastrels, refusing to work, leeching off their families and drowning in self-inflicted lassitude. The etymology of `I vitelloni' refers to `large gut' (nonproductive person prone to stuffing himself), or a cross of beef and veal meaning `immature lazy young person without a clear identity or any notion what to do with his life'. The vitelloni all put on airs of respectability, but encounters with fantasy worlds makes it clear they are merely ridiculous. The film constitutes a great jump in maturity on the previous two films. The White Sheik is dazzlingly made, but the montage Fellini deploys there relegates the characters to unbelievable two-dimensional caricatures that can only exist on screen. Cinema technique masks reality rather than showing it accurately. In I vitelloni technique is always at the service of theme and never obscures it. The film focuses on a group of very real fully-rounded young men emoting real feelings that audiences even today can identify with. For this reason the film has had an enduring influence down the years on directors such as Barry Levinson in Diner, George Lucas in American Graffiti and perhaps most notably Martin Scorsese. His Italian-American films inhabit the same milieu of I vitelloni albeit transposed to New York. This is evidenced in films such as Who's that Knocking at my Door (1967), Mean Streets (1973), Raging Bull (1980) and Good Fellas (1990). Mean Streets is a virtual remake which even features some of the same camera shots, while Good Fellas lift's Fellini's voiceover introduction of the vitelloni at the beginning for a scene where gangsters are introduced in a bar.

Although there are 6 vitelloni, we only really get to know three of them well. The `spiritual leader' of the group is Fausto (Franco Fabrizi), a provincial Casanova who imagines himself to be sexy and sophisticated, but is actually selfish and base. He dominates the narrative and in each of the set piece make-believe scenes we see him unmasked as the immature spoilt brat that he really is. The film's opening beauty contest introduces Fausto's girlfriend Sandra (Eleonora Ruffo) as the beauty queen while he eyes up another girl. Turns out Sandra is pregnant with Fausto's child and his father forces him into a shotgun marriage when his real desire is to simply run away. Back from his honeymoon and in a cinema with Sandra, he brazenly flirts with the woman sitting on his other side. He promptly deserts his wife hoping to get his end in. Failing, he returns back to the cinema, his wife having been left alone to wait for him. Later he is given a job working in a shop selling religious artifacts. He doesn't notice the wife of the shop-owner until the carnival reveals her beauty to him and he later gets fired for coming on to her. Then later backstage of a variety show performance he meets a dancer, who this time he succeeds in bedding, only returning to his wife and family in the early hours. Fausto plays the family man, the honest shop worker, the good father, but each social occasion sabotages this 'face', revealing him as a ridiculous flake. Fabrizi is superb in this role, carrying our amused sympathy (and the film with it) even when he does the most despicable things.

The second vitellone is the most ridiculous of them all. Alberto (Alberto Sordi who was The White Sheik) lives off the earnings of his sister Olga who also supports their mother, the father having deserted them. He pretends to be the master of the house, but is simply a pompous dead weight. He upbraids Olga for damaging the family name by carrying on with a married man while he drags the family name in the mud by refusing to work and leeching off the family's sole bread-winner so he can go gambling. His big come-uppance comes at the carnival where he gets drunk. Dressed up as the big fat woman he actually is, he dances with a giant plaster head and (only because he's drunk) utters the only true words he says throughout the film: ""Who are you?...You're nobody. You're all nobody!...All of you. All."" He addresses the words to himself just as much as his friends and when he finally lurches back home he finds his sister on the way out with her boyfriend. From now he has to look after his mother on his own. His woman's dress contrasts with the manly attire of his sister who up until this point has been the rock of the family. The implication is doom for the mother and himself, unable (unwilling) as he is to get up and find a job. Sordi is brilliant here, especially when he flips the bird at a bunch of construction workers as he drives past in a car. The car breaks down not far down the road and hilariously he has to run for his life as the men take pursuit. Sordi would have made an excellent Zampan in La strada, but was to be disappointed when Fellini chose Anthony Quinn over him.

Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste who we saw play Ivan in The White Sheik) is the quiet and introspective poet of the group. A writer, he imagines himself a Hemingway big game hunting in Africa. Unfortunately he is a purveyor of pap and his aspirations are merely pipe dreams. He faces his moment of reality at the variety theater when he meets the `famous' actor Sergio Natali who agrees to hear a reading of one of the great poet's dreary plays. Natali pretends to listen, but proves to be a homosexual who only wants to engineer a quicky with Leopoldo under the pier on the beach. Trieste plays Leopoldo with a quiet dignity which contrasts with the brash show of social propriety in The White Sheik, but he is shown as no less foolish than his friends, and no less in need of changing his life and grasping some responsibility.

Two of the vitelloni are virtually ignored in the film probably because they are surrogates for Fellini and his brother. Riccardo Fellini plays a character actually called 'Riccardo' and we must assume that the film's narrator (the first time for Fellini to deploy voice-over narration) is Federico himself. The director grew up in Rimini, a seaside resort not dissimilar to the town in this film and we must assume the film amounts to a poetic account of his childhood days, though obviously he didn't want to get too personally revealing (such modesty is lacking in later films which freely parade his dirty dreams for everyone to look at!) and kept both his brother and himself in the shadows. In his excellent book on Fellini (The Cinema of Federico Fellini [Princeton University Press, 1992]) Bondanella says there are only five vitelloni and moots the last member of the group Moraldo (Franco Interlenghi) as the possible narrator, but look closely at the scene on the beach when they are walking and we count five without Fausto who is on honeymoon.

Moraldo watches over the three key characters (and we presume the two hidden ones) and functions as the film's conscience. He may be no less indolent than his friends, but their inadequacies are writ large in his comparative innocence as he functions as a cipher for the audience. He is Fausto's brother-in-law and is compromised by covering for his infidelities and lying to his sister. He is also dragged into theft as Fausto exacts revenge on his former employer. In addition Moraldo is the one who escorts Alberto home from the carnival and witnesses his final embarrassment, and of course he is present as Leopoldo embarrasses himself in front of Natali. Moraldo is given two scenes with a young boy who reflects his innocence in perhaps a gesture towards neo-realist convention where adult cruelty is pointedly contrasted with the reactions of children. These conversations seem insignificant, but are the only moments of genuine feeling in the film completely absent of either `face' or make believe. They lead into the film's natural conclusion which is that Moraldo is the only one who gets up the courage to leave the town and start life afresh.

In the film's conclusion we first meet the ambiguity that will become a Fellini trademark. In the following trilogy of redemption or grace (La strada, Il Bidone, Le notti di Cabiria) all the characters find a certain redemption wherein they seem to find God, but actually this is never made explicit. The sacred and secular are interchangeable and we are not sure if the characters actually improve or not. The same applies with I Vitelloni. One reading would be that Moraldo sees the pathetic waste inherent in his group's lifestyle and seeks to break away. This suggests a certain character drive and a belief that he can change things for the better. The problem is we see no sign of this drive anywhere else in the film. He gets on the train not knowing where he's going or what he's going to do. He deserts his family and friends without telling anyone and a second reading of his departure could be that he is simply running away from his responsibilities rather than staying and dealing with them. The flight could be seen as a symptom of the prevailing social illness that grips the group rather than a cure. Interestingly, the first draft of the script comes firmly down on the side of the second view with Fellini damning his characters completely for their idleness. He made the change however, perhaps realizing that audiences would respond better to an ending that was less finite and which reflects real life more accurately. It would become his mantra throughout his career as he became infamous for narratives which refuse pat explanations. Arguably, this got out of hand in his later extravaganzas which verge on incoherence and self-indulgence, but all his films prior to La dolce vita have disciplined narratives deeply bedded within the characters involved and are all the better for it.

The film making technique deployed in I vitelloni seems to be much less flashy than the complicated montage of The White Sheik. However, look closely and we notice the camera barely stands still. Slow complicated tracking shots dominate the film with the show piece social occasions (especially the wonderfully-shot carnival) coming beautifully alive. The camera seems to be at one in sketching out these characters and making them so believable. Of course the performances here are fabulous and help Fellini, but the subtle treatment of the camera (take a bow Otello Martelli), the deployment of voice-over, the odd use of subjective shots which startle because they jar with the fixed point of the narrator's perspective, and the deeply affectionate, but also deeply critical depiction of a particular social milieu with older characters featured as a barometer against which the actions of the vitelloni can be measured, are all deeply impressive and make for a profoundly moving experience. The famous shot at the end as Moraldo rides away on the train as the camera subjectively portrays his farewell to his friends by gliding over their beds as they sleep is the icing on the cake. All in all, I vitelloni stands as one of Fellini's very best and is mandatory viewing.

This is a review of the Nouveaux Pictures DVD. There are no extras except the usual trailer and picture gallery, but the picture is pristine (aspect ratio 4:3) and extremely beautiful with the sound properly restored.",1424649600,,12816,4.845732542218165

8026533,5,B0002DB4YQ,"This film is an excellent portrayal of adolescents' right of passage into adulthood. The protagonists in the film are stuck in limbo between adulthood and adolescence. They drink, party, and have casual sexual encounters with various women. Only the aptly named Moraldo realizes this limbo and decides to do something about it.

The story is excellent and the sometimes mundane atmosphere drives the theme further home. The characters just wait until something exciting happens while they drag themselves through their lives otherwise. The acting is brilliant and the shots of the sea and the urban buildings represent the characters' realization that a world of opportunity is out there while at the same time confining their mentality to the city, respectively.

This was my first foray into Fellini after hearing all the hype and I was not disappointed. I Vitelloni is a great start into the mind of one of Italy's greatest cinematic sons.",1386979200,3,942,5.150326797385621
8026534,5,B0002DB4YQ,"This film delivered far more than I was expecting.  This is the neo-realism side of Fellini prior to his transition into the more surrealistic fare that came later.  The film is a premonition of things to come in later films such as ""8 1/2"" and ""Amarcord""--some of the scenes are very similar to later Fellini films.  The story is a sort of coming of age story (though we wonder how much the characters really learn) of 5 friends in a small Italian seaside town where not much happens on the surface of things.  But in the story it's the little things that matter and as he does so well in his films, Fellini pays close attention to detail.  After all in a little insignificant seeming town it's the detail that is mostly all people have.

The story is mundane over all, but touching in small ways.  Nothing grandiose.  This is life as most of us probably know it to one extent or another.  ""I Vitelloni"" could easily be our own story if filled with the people, places, and events in our own lives.  It's a tale that made me smile and feel just a bit wistful.

The Criterion DVD is a much better transfer than I expected.  The image is sharp and the sound comes across clearly.  The film is over 60 years old, yet the picture quality was like it had recently been made.

I'm a Fellini nut so I'm definitely biased about his movies.  If you're turned off by his weirder stuff, this is one you might enjoy since it's more grounded in reality.",1386115200,,1440,4.360902255639098
8026535,5,B0002DB4YQ,"I watched I VITELLONI a few days before the beginning of the BBC Radio 4 celebration of British neo-realistic novels and plays such as THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER and THIS SPORTING LIFE. After having watched the film, I realized that Fellini's film adumbrates many of the themes discussed in the British works: a study of young men living in small-town Italy, I VITELLONI captures the futility of their existences as they play pool in seedy halls, loaf aimlessly about the litter-strewn streets and try to enjoy themselves. Fausto (Franco Fabrizi) gets Sandra (Eleonora Ruffo) pregnant and has to marry her; but his wandering eye prevents him from sustaining a stable relationship. Although the two are reconciled at the end, we have no guarantee that they will stay together. Eventually Fausto's friend Moraldo (Franco Interlenghi) leaves the small town life for good; he does not know where he is going, but he feels he has to escape (in an ending that foreshadows Schlesinger's BILLY LIAR). Brilliantly photographed in atmospheric black-and-white, I VITELLONI portrays a fundamentally indifferent world where passers-by walk past without even glancing at one another; and life revolves around clutter-strewn shops and seedy bars. The deep-focus shooting is brilliant; the backgrounds to each shot capture the repetitiveness of life in this small town, where people do the same things each day, and young men like Fausto and Moraldo have little or no prospects.",1377561600,2,1478,5.2405063291139244
