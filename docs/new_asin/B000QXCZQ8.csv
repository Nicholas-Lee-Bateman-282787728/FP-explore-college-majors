""Si Me Han de Matar Maana,"" 1946

The 2 stars in this film, Pedro Infante and Sofia Alvarez, serve up a terrific selection of songs, including 2 knock-out duets, that make ""Si Me Han de Matar Manana"" a tasty treat for anyone who likes mariachi music. Sofia Alvarez (1913-1985), who was born in Colombia, gets top billing in this film, and though her fame wasn't a lasting one like Infante's, she is marvelous, with rare beauty, good singing voice, and stylish grace. The plot is stretched a bit thin, revolving around Lupita (Alvarez), who was kidnapped as a child, and is found by her father General Reyes (Miguel Arenas)...right before an assassination attempt on his life...singing in a cantina, owned by bad guy Genovevo (Rene Cardona), who wants to marry her. Enter Ramiro (Infante), who has blonde Fanny (Nelly Montiel) trying to ""catch"" him. El Chicote is Ramiro's funny sidekick, and the story goes round and round, as many lovely songs are sung.

Favorite musical numbers are the ""Bajo el sol de Jalisco"" duet sung at a palenque (the squeamish should be warned there is a cock fight before it), the gorgeous solo by Infante with a trio at Fanny's party, and the ""dueling verses"" duet that follows it at the cantina. Director Miguel Zacarias also wrote the script, music is by Miguel Esperon, and the acting by all is fine in this delightful comedic romantic romp. The b&w film quality is quite clear and sharp, but the audio unfortunately shows its age a bit, and is at times quite fuzzy, though the songs still shine despite the sound deterioration. Both stars look wonderful, and Infante fans will love this film.

""Soy Charro del Rancho Grande,"" 1947

Directed by Joaquin Pardave, ""Soy Charro de Rancho Grande"" stretches its very thin plot around some lovely songs and an attractive cast, particularly its two exceptional stars, the beautiful Colombian actress Sofia Alvarez (1913-1985), who gets top billing and is sensational in her big ""Guadalajarena"" number, and Pedro Infante (1917-1957), Mexico's most loved singer/actor, who 50 years after his untimely passing when he crashed his plane in the Yucatan, still reigns supreme. The plot starts with Antonio (Infante), leaving the Rancho Grande for the big city, to take part in the ""Gran Concurso National de Charro."" He becomes a big star, and seemingly goes somewhat astray, especially in his love for Cristina (Alvarez). Their Padrino Don Felipe (Rene Cardona) and blonde Kitty (Joan Page), are part of the web that circles him, and little does he know that he's being tested, to prove the loyalty, frankness, and nobility of his affections. You'll have to suspend your logical thinking while all this is going on, but never mind, you'll have lots of fun doing it!

""Pablo y Carolina,"" 1955

The plot in this silly but highly entertaining romantic comedy begins with Carolina, who goes to the Instituto de Cien Primaveras because she wants to be a ""perfect wife."" Carolina has three men pursuing her, but is not totally in love with any of them. She writes a letter to ""the man of her dreams,"" and not only does it accidentally get mailed, but the name she addressed it to actually exists, and it is Pablo! In order to avoid him when he shows up, she pretends to be her own brother by dressing as a navy cadet. There are many amusing scenes as Pablo is at first confused, and then suspects the truth of her disguise, and of course, there are five wonderful songs as well, by Manuel Esperon and Cuco Sanchez, sung beautifully as only Pedro Infante can.

The cast glitters and shines, particularly Pedro Infante as Pablo, Irasema Dilian as Carolina, Alejandro Ciangherotti as Enrique, Pablo's snoozing brother, and the ever funny Eduardo Alcaraz, as Guillermo the butler. Director Mauricio de la Serna also co-wrote the script, and the film is in color, and in good condition despite its age, though sometimes is a little heavy in the green and orange shades. Infante fans will love this film, which was one of his last, even though it is not the type of Comedia Ranchera we usually associate with him, and has a more ""Hollywood/Doris Day"" feel to it. ""Pablo y Carolina"" has a sweet innocence, and would make a perfect ""date movie.""

""Escuela de Musica,"" 1955

""Escuela de Musica"" was the 2nd film Infante made with Argentine icon Libertad Lamarque (the 1st was the brilliant and dramatic ""Ansiedad""), and it's a comedic musical romp with Lamarque running a music school, and Infante helping her finance it. Written and directed by Miguel Zacarias, it also has in the cast an actor who played a vital part in so many of Infante's films, Lalo Gonzalez ""El Piporro.""",1216080000,4,5126,4.97316219369895
