5414308,4,B00AER0XUG,"I am unable to understand why this movie received so much flak (critics would probably say that is why I enjoyed this movie, but what do they know?).

Aiyyaa is a refreshing movie about one woman's sensitivity to smell and her lust/attraction for one tall, dark and hot as heck Surya (Prithviraj). Frankly, it was quite refreshing to watch a movie where the heroine was lusting for the hero. R

ani's character Meenakshi is a middle class, Maharastrian girl, continually harrassed by her mother to get married (what else?). But Meenakshi lives in a world of her own (if you grew up in the late 80s and 90s, you will recognize some classic songs from those decades) and quite happily visits that dreamworld without any kind of ""help"" (drugs).

As Meenakshi and her parents ""look for suitable boys"", enter Surya- an artist who is rumored to be a drunkard and drug addict and a wastrel in every way possible. Who is Surya? What is the mysterious fragrance which drives Meenakshi crazy? Will Meenakshi marry the safe, Brahmin boy who loves to grow roses on his parents' terrace garden or will she get the dark and dangerous hottie?Watch to find out more. A recommendation: watch with your girlfriends and just enjoy the gorgeous ""scenery"" on display along with Rani Mukerji's madcap antics.",1363651200,3,1286,4.8099547511312215
5414309,4,B00AER0XUG,"Amazon should stream more Bollywood movies to rent or buy  on Amazon Instant Video. Like Aiyyaa. It's not always easy to watch Bollywood films and it would be much easier if Amazon would stream them. Aiyyaa is a good movie. Not everyone will like it.  Many compare it to The Dirty Picture but they are like night and day. Aiyyaa is a Comedy/ Romance. Even silly at times. I enjoyed Rani and Prithviraj in this movie, but I wish there would have been more dialogue between the two in the film. Prithviraj's character only speaks during the last part of the movie. I liked it though. I really wish Amazon would put it on Amazon Instant Video.",1362182400,5,640,4.461538461538462
8550636,5,B00AER0XUG,"Rani is amazing! Her facial expressions are so expressive. Her girlish dreams are such fun, and the hero is tanned and gorgeous. Lastly, her dancing, wow. I had to rewind just to see her move. A fun, light-hearted, happy film. i really enjoyed it.",1495324800,,247,4.636363636363637

8550638,4,B00AER0XUG,"Just cos I love Rani Mukerjee and this is one of her earliest, I guess. The rest of the movie was ordinary, even not so easy to watch often, but other times the quirkiness made it unique. Rani shone so brightly and carried the movie entirely; Prithviraj Sukumaran was sizzling. The quiet chemistry and way it developed. Those took me past the rest, which I would have called a not good enough to watch movie probably, took me past the sort of 'dated' feeling; and just made it so satisfying by the end, at least for me. Romantic but in a different sort of way ..., thanks a lot for the stream. Had been wanting to see this a long time and could never find it. Actually had to watch it a couple of days later again while my 7 days of streaming was paid for. Overall the contrast to 'the rest of the movie' and the radiance and great acting of those two was stunning and almost made them stand out more. Have never seen a movie with Rani Mukerjee that didn't stay with me forever.",1464393600,,978,4.235294117647059

8550642,3,B00AER0XUG,"Aiyyaa is a cheeky story of woman's lust for her dream man. Meenakshi the protagonist is a girl who believes in the Bollywood definition of love and romance- melodramatic, and over the top. She falls head over heels with a brooding artist, but is unable to express her feelings to him directly, and what she finds out about him only pushes her deeper into distraught. Rani mukherji is fantastic as the main lead of the movie and is ably supported by a talented cast, and entertaining music and choreography ( except for the lijjat papad song). Some of the characters are over the top. While the film treads on the line between entertaining and ludicrous, it is rani who saves the day with her acting prowess and surprising dancing skills that haven't been harnessed this successfully in her past roles. Unfortunately the story telling lacks focus and is the ultimate killer to what could have easily been a gem of a movie. Watch it for rani and her two love stories in the movie, the brother's romantic track could have been easily edited much more.",1451779200,,1049,4.675675675675675
8550643,4,B00AER0XUG,"starts out a little slow and we were almost about to switch it off, but decided to give it 15 mins as we paid for it. but then stuck to it till the end. nicely made. combines the ""filmy"" dunia and simple life very well.",1448064000,,219,3.888888888888889
8550644,2,B00AER0XUG,"I am a Rani fan, but I did not like this movie. It was silly but it also was porn, and I am not accustomed to seeing her cast in such unflattering light.",1444953600,,153,3.6666666666666665
8550645,5,B00AER0XUG,"A really enjoyable film. Reminds you  of Marathi theatre, French romantic movies (like Audrey tatou's movies) and farookh sheikhs old movies. Some scenes are very creative. Gets a little slow sometimes but surely worth a watch.",1396828800,2,227,5.305555555555555
