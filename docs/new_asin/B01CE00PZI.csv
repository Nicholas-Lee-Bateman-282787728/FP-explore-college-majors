7681364,5,B01CE00PZI,I purchased this story in Uncanny X-Men #141-142 comic books when they were first released. Was my favorite Claremont and Byrne X-Men issues. A lot of story has been changed and/or adjusted. Both stories are AWESOME!,1466553600,,216,5.027777777777778

8752791,5,B01CE00PZI,"One of the all time best X-Men Comic Stories retold in a way that keeps true to the character development choices of this movie series. I would say probably the best X-Men Movie (not counting Deadpool or Logan) to date. Great take on Quicksilver, definitely steals the show.",1516406400,,274,4.729166666666667

8752794,5,B01CE00PZI,"the movie starts in china, with the professor (charles) has a idea,
what if we go back to the past and change what happened?
but with everything that has happened how can we do that?
charles, we can do this, i  have hope, but to do this, we need someone that's able
 to go back in the past  and be able to live , to come back!
Logan tells charles he can do it because he his able to  make quick recoveries
to do this, someone needs to be able to get logan to look back in his mind back in the 1980's and beyond
so he lays on the table in the professors lab, and one of the mutants hold her hands to his head  while he remembers the past
now , she needs to stablise him if he  starts jumping around or he awakens if this happens , all is lost
Logan needs to go back when Charles had no powers and  talk him into helping change the past,
he also has to get eric to help as well, as you remember, Eric has always been the enemy, so this will not be easy for Logan to do
everything goes well and the main idea is to find mystic and change the idea of the government getting her DNA
her not dying,  all of this is slowly working , till  Eric decides he wants to change the past to his needs and wants as he always does
you have to see  what all happens and see if and what actually changes and how the past has or could be now,
this is the perfect part for Jennifer Lawrence and her character plays it well!
the ending is nail biting and almost comical, but, its very serious at the same time, confused? you will be!
lots of action and the president back then is very well done!!",1507939200,,1574,3.9213836477987423
