Andrews Blu-ray Review: The film CAF SOCIETY is set in the 1930s, and is Woody Allens bittersweet romance that follows Bronx-born Bobby Dorfman [Jesse Eisenberg] to Hollywood, where he falls in love, and then back to New York, where he is swept up in the vibrant world of high society nightclub life. It centres on events in the lives of Bobby Dorfmans colourful Bronx family; the film is a glittering valentine to the movie stars, socialites, playboys, debutantes, politicians, and gangsters who epitomized the excitement and glamour of the age. Layered with a rich soundtrack of romantic tunes from the period, this is a familiar tale of love yearned for, gained, lost and savoured after the fact. In other words, its a format Woody Allen has relied upon many times before, but even past the age of 80.

CAF SOCIETY is trademark of director Woody Allen; celebrating the classic age of Hollywood in all its glory, backed by that all-familiar jazz score and complemented by a wonderfully romantic tale among the understated glitz and glamour. The film itself is simplistic, telling the story of unassuming Bobby Dorfman, the son of a jeweller in the Bronx who craves for the high life where his uncle Phil Stern is a big-hitting producer in Hollywood.

Bobby Dorfmans family features his relentlessly bickering parents Rose Dorfman [Jeannie Berlin] and Marty Dorfman [Ken Stott], his casually amoral gangster brother Ben Dorfman [Corey Stoll]; his good-hearted teacher sister Evelyn Dorfman [Sari Lennick], and her egghead husband Leonard Dorfman [Stephen Kunken]. For the hooligan Ben, there are no questions that cant be answered with brute force, but the others are more likely to ponder deeper matters, like right and wrong, life and death, and the commercial viability of religion.

Seeking more out of life, Bobby Dorfman flees his fathers jewellery store for Hollywood and Tinseltown, where he works for his high- powered agent Uncle Phil Stern. Bobby Dorfman soon falls for Phil Sterns charming assistant Veronica ""Vonnie"" Sybil, and Bobby Dorfman is swiftly whipped up into a frenzy of love for her. But as shes involved with another man, he settles for friendship. They share a bond in being essentially fish out of water in terms of the glitz and glamour, but soon a blossoming love becomes much more complicated with a relationship revelation. Bobby Dorfman also befriends Rad [Parker Posey], a model agency owner, and her husband Steve [Paul Schneider], a wealthy producer.

Heartbroken, Bobby Dorfman returns to New York, where he begins working for Ben, who has muscled his way into owning a nightclub. Bobby Dorfman displays natural talents as an impresario and swiftly promotes the club into the hottest in town, renaming it Les Tropiques. Rad introduces him to the beautiful socialite Veronica Hayes [Blake Lively] and Bobby Dorfman courts her assiduously.  Although Bobby Dorfman is still carrying a torch for Veronica ""Vonnie"" Sybil, when Veronica Hayes reveals that she is pregnant, they marry and begin a genuinely happy life together. Everything seems to have fallen into place for Bobby Dorfman until the night Veronica ""Vonnie"" Sybil walks into Les Tropiques, gives the nightclub scenes alone something that really that energises the film CAF SOCIETY. Yet CAF SOCIETY is also one of the richest and most poignant of Woody Allens later films; that fans will relish it and enjoy the many echoes of the directors earlier films.

Woody Allen is an auteur and CAF SOCIETY certainly shows plenty of glimpses at why such a director is heralded as one of the greatest of the generation. Woody Allen beautifully presents a world of beauty, magic and love, drenched in art deco and a stunning orange tinge that lights up the screen with each and every moment within Hollywood. Its a sight to behold, along with the undeniable pairing of Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart.

While Jesse Eisenberg is essentially the lead, playing his part as Bobby Dorfman with simplistic ease, it is certainly Kristen Stewart who steals the show as she does Bobby Dorfmans heart within the film. For years, Kristen Stewart has been unfairly underrated, having struck us with her prowess as films such as Camp X-Ray and Clouds of Sils Maria, and once again here she wows with her natural ability to captivate and charm. The pair have been seen previously working together in comedy American Ultra, but this is a completely different beast and one that is much more relatable and charming.

Poignant, and often hilarious, CAF SOCIETY, is a film with a novel sweep, takes us on a journey from pastel-clad dealmakers in plush Hollywood mansions, to the quarrels and tribulations of a humble Bronx family, to the rough-and-tumble violence of New York gangsters, to the sparkling surfaces and secret scandals of Manhattan high life. With director Woody Allen conjures up a 1930s world that has passed to tell a deeply romantic tale of dreams that never die.

Where CAF SOCIETY slightly falters is when it removes itself from the Hollywood humdrum and attempts to build up Bobby Dorfmans family roots in the Bronx. Admittedly, it provides plenty of opportunities for Woody Allens comedy to inch its way in, but it essentially it feels like a bit of a distraction from a love story that were actually drawn in by and the key component of this story.

Overall, CAF SOCIETY is everything you have come to expect from a Woody Allen picture; its charming, gorgeous to look at, and features superb central performances from the main characters in the film and it is a joyful treat for this festive period and one that will leave you with a warm feeling. It is perhaps fitting, then, that nearly every scene of the film is washed, via its brilliant cinematographer, the great Vittorio Storaro, makes Woody Allens 1930s Los Angeles look magical and especially in the lovely side-light of the golden hour and it is a choice, at once subtle and pervasive, that gives the films proceedings, whatever the time of day, whether characters are outside or in, the effect of a perpetual beautiful sunset. CAF SOCIETY is Woody Allens first digital film that is the only way the film fulfils its true potential and heres looking to the future.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Home Video brings us this Blu-ray disc of CAF SOCIETY with an equally impressive and glorious 1080p Technicolor encode image, but also presented in a very unusual framed film in the 2.00:1 aspect ratio. While most of the time director Woody Allen has preferred a classical style for the look of his films, and has slowly evolved as evidenced by the look of this very stylish film of his. And for the first time Woody Allen has shot this film in the digital format and looks absolutely fantastic and is the word for this transfer as the sharpness is totally exceptional with so much sharp clarity and colours are totally luscious and especially often totally breath-taking. Skin tones take on a beautiful burnished aura in some of the lower lit Hollywood scenes, but overall the flesh tones are totally believable and very appealing, and colour values overall are rather scrumptious. Black levels are really excellent, and the contrast has been applied with great panache in making for a most consistent picture quality image and the bright vibrant colours of California come through wonderfully stunning, with a vibrant use of colour, flare, and pizzazz. This was cinematically at its best and showed off the 1930s period of a wonderful spectacular ambience, with a great use of costume and set to create the mood. Visually, CAF SOCIETY was everything you could ask for, and the Blu-ray supported all that hard work paying off handsomely.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Home Video brings us this Blu-ray disc of CAF SOCIETY with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix and only uses the rear channels for slight ambiance effects. A visit to Malibu places echoes of the waves in the rears, and some of the orchestral strains of Rodgers and Hart also find their way to the rears though the front channels are by far the stronger and more frequently used. This is a very chatty and dialogue oriented style of this film, with the emphasis of the ambient noises of the oceans, city life and especially the party scenes that rely much more heavily on crowds and sounds from all over and has been masterfully recorded and has been placed in the centre channel, giving the audio a high quality ambient sound that gets a great use of voice, music, and narration, especially from Woody Allen himself no less. The song selection was pretty spot on, with a good jazzy feel to it overall and very evocative of its time.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: On the Red Carpet [2016] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:12] Here we are at the CAF SOCIETY event and the glamorous red carpet footage at the New York Film Premiere, and this promotional video includes comments from actors like Blake Lively [Veronica], Kristen Stewart [Vonnie] and Parker Posey [Rad], praising their directors smart and funny dialogue and especially directing the film in talking to the press and extol the creative virtues of director Woody Allen and fellow actor Jesse Eisenberg. The only negative aspect I did not like, is that the sound recording was atrocious and you could hardly hear what they were trying to say.

Special Feature: Photo Gallery [2016] [1080p] [1.78:1] Here we get to view 34 stunning colour images from the CAF SOCIETY set and from the film itself. What you also view is the photos are in a yellow frame and centred in the centre of the screen. You have to click the right hand arrow on your remote control to advance the images.

Finally, the film CAF SOCIETY looks totally ravishing, with shots of New York which recall images in Woody Allens greatest work, the film Manhattan, that has wonderfully composed images of the skyline. But with the film CAF SOCIETY director Woody Allen gives his homage to the golden age of Tinseltown, like his other homages to Paris and Rome. Woody Allen brings it all together in his closing moments which conjure something unexpectedly melancholy and shrewdly judged. It has entertainment and lots of wonderful charm. It is full of glamorous movie stars and studio executives in white suits and tuxedos, having poolside parties in Technicolor like twilight, at their sleek modernist and stucco homes. The sun shines incessantly as they gossip, backstab and drink their highballs. By contrast, New York is dark and dingy. The film is beautifully crafted and very well performed and I did not want it to end, that is how engrossing the film is. It also ends on a surprisingly moving note as the characters, and their director, ponder the roads not taken and speculate about what might have been. Highly Recommended!

8764627,1,B01H47IIIM,"Call me crazy but Cafe Society is a collection of anti-semitic 'dreck  -  cliches masking as self effacing jewish humor.  I finally  understand why my Italian American friends refused to to watch the The Sopranos or The Godfather because of its many cliches about the mafia.

Full disclosure I was a big Woody Allen fan during the 1960s and 1970s. My favorites films were Play it  again Sam,  Sleeper and Annie Hall.

But lately ( for the past 10 years)  I lost interest in Woody Allen's films. I skipped his films at  the Great Neck Squire even at senior citizen half/priced rates

Problem # 1 : Woodys characters are almost always rich and  gentile (They always seem to be drinking wine; when they have some free time they cheat on their wives or maybe think about cheating.

Problem # 2.  The ever present creepy scenes with an Allen and his muse -  typically  a young pretty (sometimes underage)  gentile with shiksa appeal.

And then my troubles really began when Cafe Society arrived  with a loud thud - free of charge  because of my  AMAZON Prime subscription.  Free is free so I watched Cafe Society a few weeks ago.

I checked the NY newspaper and magazine for reviews of Cafe Society - wondering if the denizens of the press had  picked up on the films not so subtle anti-Semitic drivel.

Surprise - Not a single one of the male critics criticized Allens anti-semitic wise-cracks.  In fact most of the NY critics like the film or were too polite to pan it. Wait . I  mean  of the male clinics liked the film but the female critics hated it

 A.O Scott of the NY Times wrote:

 Review: Caf Society Isnt Woody Allens Worst Movie

The  other  NYC guy reviewers such as Brady and Lane of the NewYorker were very  positive about the film .
Not that  surprising because  Allen has written many,  many come essays and stories for  the NewYorker.

David Edelstein of NewYork  magazine  liked the film!

But Allen did not escape the pointed comments from female critics!

Julia Felsenthal of Vogue panned the film in uncertain terms. Her main criticism was Woodys glaring blind spot : an unabashed predilection for young woman. In the film Kristan Stewart is Allens latest muse  plays a Lolita like  temptress. She writes

Why One Writer Is Fed Up With Woody Allen

 yet another reference to the directors bizarre blind spot the inclusion of a I know we should all aspire to separate the art from the artist, but Allen, I have to say, makes it pretty freaking difficult.""

We adore Errol Flynn, Vonnie crows at one point, then relates a story whose punch line concerns the actors fondness for very young girls. Is Allen being deliberately provocative, or does he not get that hes being provocative? Does Caf Society represent some misguided but good-faith attempt to examine his life and reputation, or is it just interested in poking fun at those who would demand he do so?

Zoe Strimpel from the UK ( on the other side of the pond) wrote in the Telegraph

From this point of view, however, Allens latest film Caf Society, out this past weekend, is both disappointing and cringe-making. Trite and reheated on any number of levels, it also, unforgivably, gets the Jewish thing all wrong. Instead of that brand of historically inflected unease captured so amusingly in Annie Hall, Caf Society just takes a pick 'n mix of Jewish clichs  some saccharine, some just offensive  and throwsthem back at us. As this cruderoll-call of clichs unfurled beforemy eyes, I could only bury my head ever-deeper in a large box of sweet'n salty popcorn.

Jews have always been subject to virulent stereotyping, with charges ranging from effeteness to a taste for childrens blood to a hysterical greed for money. We don't need more movies reinforcing half of those. Its particularly depressing that any caricatures should be peddled by Allen, once the master dissector not just of the Jewish condition, but ofthe human condition.

Strimpels goes on:

Perhaps in his dotage he now finds it easier and more comfortable to draw on worn old clichs than examine, as he once did in such masterly fashion, the real world around him. Either way, he seems to have lost sight of the fact that Jews deserve representation that reflects the reality that, like any group on earth, we are unique but diverse. In diet, beliefs, and yes, in nose shape.

Wow. Thank god for these muses!
