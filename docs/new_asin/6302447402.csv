462246,5,6302447402,"""The Assassination Of JFK"" is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen related to the JFK assassination. It's full of great footage and dialogue that gives it's impact with it's words. This is a documentary  to listen to closely. I've seen it more than once, there's just so much  information in here! It makes it's case clear and presents facts and an  overwhelming amount of evidence indicating that Kennedy was killed by a  conspiracy. I would rank this by Oliver Stone's masterpiece,  ""JFK."" This is a great documentary that everyone should watch to  be informed on the workings of power.",939686400,16,598,4.813725490196078
462247,4,6302447402,"Overall, this is a good video. However, this 90 minute video contains a lot of talking and not a whole lot of actual footage of the assassination. You'll get to hear a lot about some of the suspects such as Clay Shaw. This  video goes into great detail about how Clay Shaw and others conspired  against President Kennedy. I recommend this video to anyone at all  interested in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.",922579200,4,424,4.626666666666667

462364,4,6302447402,"My only complaint with this one is that it does not get to Garrison's investigation until the last half-hour. When I bought this one I thought the entire video was going to focus on just the Garrison case which I have read 5 or 6 books about. The first hour is a tidy wrap-up of some covert CIA history and there is a rundown of the events in Dallas with Garrison occasionally speaking of events, but I want to see a thorough documentary on just the Garrison case emphasizing background on some of the bizarre principles involved such as David Ferrie, Guy Bannister, Perry Russo, Dean Andrews, and others surrounding those bizarre events in New Orleans in the late 1960s. I will admit what I saw of the Garrison case in this video was compelling. The most interesting was Perry Russo's interview as he drove his taxi. He said that Ferrie, Shaw and Oswald were all at Ferrie's apartment during a party there yet police polygraph examiner Edward Odonell said that during the lie detector test, Russo told him that he did not know if Clay Shaw was ever at Ferrie's apartment. Odonell asked Russo, ""Perry, Clay Shaw is a very distinguished looking tall gray haired man, if he was at Dave Ferrie's place you would have remembered him"". At that point Russo told Odonnell:""Well, sir if I have to give you an answer the answer is NO Clay Shaw was not there"". Who is telling the truth for God's sake!!!",1132617600,4,1393,4.553784860557769
462365,5,6302447402,"As I write this, the fortieth anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination is one week away, and there are far more questions about his death now than there ever have been.  I have been intensely interested and disturbed by the assassination of JFK for many years now; as I personally do not hold JFK in high regard, I can barely fathom the emotional trauma his still-unexplained death brings to those who loved and supported him at the time and who honor him today.  Whatever you think of the man, there is no question that his assassination in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963, changed America, destroying not only the idyllic dreams of Camelot but invoking what has now become a permanent mistrust of government at the highest level in the hearts and minds of the American people.  Many, many men and women have devoted their lives to studying the tragedy that took place in Dealey Plaza on that terrible November day, and I am hoping that the event's thirtieth anniversary will reawaken an American public to a travesty of justice that has been somewhat forgotten during the turbulent past two years in American history.  This video, The Assassination of JFK, makes for an excellent introduction to the truly incredible story of this tragedy, although it certainly cannot begin to cover all of the questions and inconsistencies of the ""official"" Warren Commission report on Kennedy's death.
The first half hour of this video is devoted to Kennedy's life, the pivotal events of his shortened presidency, and the possible implications his decisions and intentions played in his death.  Basically, the viewer will see a lot of background material explaining the different motives of a number of groups hostile to JFK.  I think the video makes a mistake in actually blaming certain groups, though, as it basically accuses all of the usual suspects without explaining exactly how they came together to change history: the Mafia, right-wing extremists, anti-Castro zealots incensed at JFK's Cuba policies and his betrayal of the freedom fighters who died in the Bay of Pigs fiasco, a hostile faction of the CIA, J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI, and the wealthy oil barons of Texas.  The possible motives of each of these groups are summarized rather well, but the video really doesn't get any farther than the pointing of fingers in a number of directions at once.
It is not until the mid-point of the presentation that one actually examines the assassination itself, and the material included here only grazes the surface of what we know.  One sees several replays of the Zapruder film which shows the kill shot in strikingly gory detail as well as a number of other shots of the motorcade and Dealey Plaza.  No witnesses are ever interviewed, but a number of prominent assassination theorists state their opinions on various aspects of the case.  Special attention is given to the official ""magic bullet"" theory espoused by the Warren Commission.  I think anyone who takes even the most superficial look at the evidence regarding this most remarkable of bullets will agree that the official version of the assassination is ludicrously absurd.  Noted pathologist Cyril Wecht gives a very convincing explanation of just how impossible the official scenario is.
Lee Harvey Oswald is naturally discussed, but not to a very significant degree; of course, Oswald may be the most mysterious man in American history, and all of the Oswald sightings and stories of the days leading up to November 22, 1963, make the man a total conundrum.  This video does not declare Oswald completely innocent, but it comes close, explicitly arguing that the government decided Oswald was the lone gunman as soon as they took him into custody.  Casting aside all of the questions about the unusual (and illegal, as Texas law forbade the deceased's body being removed from the state before an autopsy could be performed there) and questionable autopsy findings (and the evidence of forgery of several autopsy photos), this video clearly insinuates that Hoover and the powers that be turned justice on its head; they ""knew"" the murderer was Oswald, and all of the shenanigans surrounding the autopsy and the Warren Commission investigation were engineered on the premise of convincing the American people that Oswald acted alone.
This is a more than worthwhile video for any American who wants to know more about the JFK assassination, but let me assure those unfamiliar with assassination research and study that nothing you see or hear here can even compare to the extraordinarily disturbing stories that many diligent private researchers have put forth about the murder and its aftermath.  Americans of all ages, whether we be Democrats or Republicans, men or women, black or white, should continue to demand and seek the truth about this pivotal event that changed America forever in a matter of six seconds.  For those who want to know more, this video is a great starting place.",1068854400,20,4958,5.006075334143378

462368,5,6302447402,"This video proves without a shadow of doubt that Garrison's theory on a conspiracy to the kill the president was right. Over the years, Garrison was torn apart by the media and thought to be an arrogant, liar. However, as years pass, we are finding out that Garrison was RIGHT. This video is packed with facts and information and finally sheds light on what happened in Dallas that fateful November day back in 1963. Jim Marrs, author of the book ""Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy"", and Mark Lane, author of ""Plausible Denial"" also offer insight and facts. This is the perfect companion to Jim Garrison's book ""On The Trail Of The Assasins"". This is a MUST SEE, as it is the video that proves Jim Garrison was in the right by pursuing an investigation into the murder of JFK. Of course as the facts continue to come out, we all know he WASN'T the liar that many wanted to belive he was. God Bless Jim Garrison!",1029196800,13,917,4.497005988023952
462369,5,6302447402,"This movie will blow you away.  If you enjoyed the Oliver Stone movie - JFK, there is no doubt that you'll be glad you saw this movie.  With expert testimony, from all sides of the spectrum, including the CIA, eyewitnessess, JFK authors, and more; you won't be dissappointed.
  The truth is the most important thing.  And this film honestly seeks to find it.  Displaying some haunting revelations from that fateful day, including how the mob and CIA work so closely together, it just boggles the mind that no one ever knew that JFK was at odds with so many in the gov't, CIA, and mafia.
  If you seek the truth, this film will put you on the right track, with the best evidence out there.  Beleive me, something did go wrong on 11/22/63.  Its time to find out.
Enjoy this excellent movie.",1004659200,10,788,4.485915492957746

462371,4,6302447402,"While I'll admit to a pro-conspricacy viewpoint. The Assassination  Of JFK should be viewed only as an entertainment for conspricacy buffs. The vast majority of the commentary comes from authors of pro-assassination books (no underlying motivation there eh!) with no ground breaking interviews or facts presented. It's simply a rehash of an interesting period in American history, but it's that period with its myriad of secret dealings and unknown characters that make The Assassination  Of JFK fun, looking at a picture of the real Dave Ferry alone makes the tape worth a look.",994636800,4,579,5.21505376344086
462372,3,6302447402,"This video provides an excellent account of JFK's assassination, founded on the assumption that Kennedy was murdered via a conspiracy, and that the subsequent investigation by the Warren Commission was incompetent, and  guilty of lying to the American people because they were afraid to tell us  the truth.
It is now well accepted that there was a conspiracy involved  in JFK's murder, and indeed this is the official position of the United  States Government, per the congressional investigation which occurred in  the late 1970's.
So, the conclusion that there was probably a conspiracy  to the murder is not news by any means.
This video outlines several  candidates as having possible motives for the assassination, but reaches no  specific conclusions about was most likely to have been behind the  assassination.  They do an excellent job of suggesting potential forces who  might have been involved, and for this alone the video is interesting and  informative enough to watch and own.
However, this video lacks the  perspective of time, which is essentially in recording any historical  event.
Like most other videos and books, this video sets out to prove  that this great American president was cut down via a conspiracy.
They do  not take into account the historical perspective of the assassination, such  as our being at the height of the Cold War, nor the personal lifestyle of  JFK, which made him vulnerable to blackmail at worst, pressure at the  least.  JFK was not a great president, and he was enlarged in death far  beyond what he achieved in life. He was a cold warrior, very unlikely to  have pulled our troups out of Vietnam (regardless of what his biographers  now say).  He had to be pushed into getting involved in our civil rights  struggle, he did not lead anything, and in fact, initially, he criticized  Black Americans for their protests and complaints, saying that they were  embarrassing him overseas.  There is much to learn about this man, JFK, and  how he lead his life had much to do with how he died.
This video does  not address any of these factors, and like most other documentaries, it  sets out to prove that the Warren Commission was wrong, and willfully  mislead the American People.
It never addresses the true political  climate in which the Warren Commission was formed, nor what forces and  pressures were in play that might have accounted for the Commission's  behavior, and their findings.
In truth, the Warren Commission was a  political decision, made by Lyndon Johnson, designed to avoid a military  encounter with the Soviets Union.
It was also designed to quiet the  many other parties, such as the Congress, the Senate, and the local  authorities in Texas, who wanted to hold their own investigations.  This  would have meant the possibility of different conclusions, which would be  dangerous at this point in our history.
Without taking this historical  perspective into account, and without the understanding that the Warren  Commission had a purpose other than to ""find out what happened""  in Dallas.
Although wrong factually, rather than being incompentent or  evil, the Warren Commission served a valuable role in defusing what could  have led to a third world war - there were many things going on in our  intelligence gathering operations that would have had to have been  compromised and revealed if the Warren Commission purpose was to uncover  the facts behind the assassination.
This was not their purpose, and  historically speaking, it should not have been their top priority.
So,  here we have an excellent video on the JFK Assassination, which is well  worth owning.
However, I believe that history will reveal a perspective  on this assassination and investigation that will yield substantially  different answers and conclusions about what happened on November 22, 1963,  and how our government officials chose to handle it.",962150400,11,3900,5.064668769716088

7825672,4,6302447402,"John Barbour put together a pretty strong documentary in the aftermath of Oliver Stone's film. Seeing this soon after viewing Stone's film was pretty amazing. I'm glad I still have my VHS version. Though it is available for viewing on YouTube, it should be reissued on DVD. There is a great deal of vintage film footage and interviews from Dallas and New Orleans: Jim Garrison, Fletcher Prouty, Nicholas Katzenbach, Roger Craig, Dr. Robert McClelland, Ed Hoffman, Jim Leavelle, Jim Marrs, Harold Weisberg, Robert Groden, Mark Lane, Orville Nix's daughter, Lou Ivon, Perry Russo, Bill Alford, Jim Garrison's kids.

It's not perfect; there are some errors. The man photographed in Dealey Plaza who looked like Jack Ruby was not Ruby. Other photos show him to be a younger man who resembles Ruby. The diagram of the single bullet theory is not from the Warren Report, as it claims on the screen. Garrison makes various assertions (he claims Ruby was involved in JFK's assassination, something I'm an agnostic about given the compartmentalization in this plot). There is a misleading segment about the dictabelt recording that adds audible gunshots over the Zapruder film. The photo showing Ferrie and Shaw together at a party does not depict Oswald as claimed; it is clearly not him.",1386979200,,1280,5.0663507109004735

It is suggested this came from a Playboy interview in October 1967. Such insight for that period. This is an excellent tape of the interview and parts of the coup.
