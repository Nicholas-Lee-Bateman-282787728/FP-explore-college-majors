8410199,4,B003ZEA9CW,"Three separate episodes, each similar, yet unique.  The goal of these explorations is a spiritual search for enlightenment, without bias or prejudice.  The program gets superior marks for the way in which this quest is pursued, although I have mixed feelings about how much time is devoted to the many interviews that are conducted, and the differences in the treatment of each episode.  The program on Sedona is spot on brilliant in a variety of ways: the photography, the sound production, the clarity of purpose, and the restrained way in which the interviews with native folks were handled.  For me the second best episode was Costa Rica.  The lead-off piece on Ireland was more of a disappointment, but when I watched it again, I gained a greater appreciation for it in the context of the other two episodes.",1300060800,,813,4.86231884057971
