8243596,3,B00122FD2K,I had to give it a 3 only because John Gavin is in the movie.  He was so gorgeous ---- very elegant classy man.  He was like an incredibly good looking Rock Hudson. (and Rock Hudson was gorgeous in his own right) Hollywood Royalty. I just don't get why his voice was dubbed over. He had a very handsome voice that was replaced by --- stupid .

8243597,5,B00122FD2K,"House Of Shadows is a thriller starring Yvonne De Carlo that was released in 1976. Co-starring John Gavin, this is actually very good. If you were a Dark Shadows fan, you can really enjoy this. Fans of Yvonne De Carlo, John Gavin, and lovers of mystery, thrillers will like this the most.",1433376000,,288,4.5576923076923075
8243598,1,B00122FD2K,"La Casa de las Sombres (The House of Shadows) (Ricardo Wullicher, 1976)

Odd Argentine/US hybrid mystery that attempted to do giallo without any of the operatic cinematography or over-the-top gore scenes, with the expected result. Take away those things that make giallo what it is and you're left with the parts that fans routinely overlook, namely the thin characters and anemic plot, with only a bit of faux-psychedelic camera trickery to give the same away (e.g., when Audrey witnesses the murder).  If you're a really big fan of seventies mystery/thrillers, this might be worth your time, but otherwise you're better off forgetting you even know this exists. *",1410134400,,665,5.148148148148148
