2678358,5,B000JMKAJK,"I'm a big fan of Christmas Movies...I've watched Three Days on TV for several years now, and have searched for the DVD each year with no luck.  I finally found this listed but am saddened to see it is no longer available -- and, doesn't appear it was available in the Region 1 format (US/Canada) anyway.  Too bad.  This movie always gives me that gentle reminder to not take even one day for granted with the people we love as you never know when it could be your last...so, sad it is not available on DVD.",1259020800,38,506,4.25
2678359,5,B000JMKAJK,This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I love it!  It has a lot of content that has very deep meaning.  I think the guy who wrote the 1 critical review didn't get these meanings.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  You will LOVE it!,1230768000,10,248,3.979591836734694
2678360,5,B000JMKAJK,"i watched this movie on tv a few years ago, and completely fell in love with it. the ending is predictable, but i still cry everytime. this love story is one that will make even the strongest cry. its one of my favorite movies ever. its deff a must see!",1197849600,20,253,4.08
2678361,2,B000JMKAJK,"I watched this movie on TV because I like the actors.  And once I'd seen it, I had to wonder why each one of them agreed to be in it.  It's awful.  Reed Diamond is wasted in the role of the grieving, desperate husband.  Heck, they're all wasted in this piece of treacle.

A young husband is shocked when his wife is killed, and he makes a deal with an angel to get three more days with her so she'll know how much he loves her.  What follows is a series of desperate attempts to prove his love.  When he finally does in the end, the angel is satisfied--but the viewer isn't--because the ""gift"" he gives his wife is sacrificial but too easy.

But, if you'd like to see some fairly attractive people being happy and trying to prove their love for each other for two hours, go for it.  I'll be taking a nap.",1196985600,4,804,4.135483870967742

2678369,5,B000JMKAJK,"It's a shame this movie isn't avialable unless you catch it on TV or find someone who posted this online as this really is an excellent movie. The premise and plot is simple but like Bicentinal Man and Powder this is a movie that has a simple yet deep, emotional message that'll be felt by many.

I really loved how relatable the character interactions were, having personally experienced a few of them. While there are moments I just can't stand, usually that means I am deeply interested in the movie. An important message in this movie is enjoy what is happening around you and as someone who is just beginning to appreciate that very concept it hits home.

I experienced many emotions watching this and find it a big bummer that isn't avialable to seen unless you're lucky.",1369008000,10,777,4.6231884057971016

2678372,5,B000JMKAJK,I also love this movie and have been looking for the DVD for quite a few years now with the hope it will become available.  Such a heartwarming movie!!!,1343347200,3,152,4.241379310344827
2678373,5,B000JMKAJK,"This movie was on ABC Family (ABCF) on December 16, 2011 at 8am and I wish I had read some of the reviews written before that date so I could have posted the time for this movie to be shown.  This is probably my favorite Christmas movie and I enjoy it so much everytime I see it.  I recorded it on my TiVo many years ago and now I have it recorded on my HD TiVo and saved it so I can watch it whenever I want.  My advice is to maybe contact ABC Family Network and ask them about future showings.  It probably won't be until next Christmas but you never know.  They might show it randomly during the year.  It's certainly worth a try.  AND, I'm like the rest of you.....why in the world would they not make this on DVD and for this region.  That doesn't make sense!",1325808000,2,764,4.013245033112582
2678374,5,B000JMKAJK,"One of the most inspiring Christmas Movies ever! It became my favorite the first year it came out. For some reason they just don't show it anymore.. If it's been on I missed it. And you can't buy it?  I really don't get ""WHY"" but it seems like they pulled this movie completely?",1324857600,,278,4.245283018867925

2678379,5,B000JMKAJK,"The story of a man who does not realize how profound the presence of his wife was until she is taken from him in a tragic accident. By God's grace, and the generosity of an angel, he is given a second chance, three days, to show her how much he truly loves her and how much he is willing to lose to keep her. A touching story that teaches each of us not to take one moment for granted, to show and not just tell the ones we love HOW MUCH we love them and a gentle reminder that the season is in celebration of the birth of the one man who gave the ULTIMATE gift for each of us....his life!",1293667200,7,589,3.87603305785124

2678381,5,B000JMKAJK,"This is one of the best Christmas movies Ive seen. I look foward to seeing this movie every year. It is a tear jerker, so make sure you have your tissues near by. The love he shows for his wife and the gift he gives her at the end is heart felt. Even though some of it was from guilt of almost cheating. He does make up for it. If you like good love stories and a good cry I would recommend this movie to everyone....",1261008000,,417,3.86046511627907

It hasn't been airing on TV for a few years now, but it finally did this year & it's just as good as I remember. It's a shame it's not available on DVD/Blu-ray. It's def. one of those Christmas movies that you want in your collection. Thankfully abc family, (soon to be Freeform, which I absolutely hate & they never shut up about it, which makes me despise it even more) has been showing it :)",1450656000,8,463,4.0989010989010985
