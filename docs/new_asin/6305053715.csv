7881568,5,6305053715,"I liked Catherine's Grove and was disappointed that it didn't get a greater release.  For it being a lower budget, indie, I thought it much better than some of the other material out there.  Should be rereleased in DVD.  Let the audience decide.",1252800000,4,245,4.651162790697675
