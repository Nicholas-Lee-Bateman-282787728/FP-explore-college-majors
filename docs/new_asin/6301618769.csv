8162135,5,6301618769,"Superb film from Republic and in '52, quite timely, as the tale involves organized crime hearings by the Senate during the time of the Kefauver hearings.  Luther Adler, who's played a Mafioso many times had his first gangland experience here, and is very clearly modeled on then famous/infamous gangsters, Frank Costello and Vito Genovese.  Claire Trevor plays his all knowing girl modeled on Virginia Hill and Brian Donlevy is the Kefauver figure and both are wonderful.  The action never takes a large backseat and the Senate stuff is kept to look like it did on TV.  For those of us who are gangster movie enthusiasts or for history buffs who don't mind a bit of fiction thrown in so as to not be too dry, this is a much fun film that was all but forgotten until Olive's beautiful release.  I have several Olive Films and have never been displeased with their product, but if only they had trailers and/or commentaries... oh well, ya can't have everything... Enjoy!!!!",1478908800,2,971,4.755952380952381

8162137,3,6301618769,Good movie but lacked the true gangster grit from say Cagney or Bogart. Nicely priced and 1 for the collection.,1407715200,,111,4.6
8162138,5,6301618769,I hope they continue to restore the older classics to blu-ray.  The quality of the picture makes me enjoy it even more then I did watching it on TV when I was a kid.,1392681600,4,165,3.8529411764705883
8162139,4,6301618769,The image quality on Hoodlum Empire is crisp and I'm happy to report the movie is pretty good too. Since Olive apparently has access to the Republic Library I wish they'd release the old Stories of the Century TV series. And what about some of those 40s horror flicks like Vampire's Ghost. That would be fun too.,1377820800,4,312,4.491228070175438
8162140,4,6301618769,"HOODLUM EMPIRE IS A WEAK FILM NOIR USING THE SEMI DOCUMENTARY STYLE OF SHOWING HOW A WAR HERO BECAUSE OF HIS FAMILY RELATIONS IS TIED TO THE MOB.  THIS FILM WOULD PROBABLY A 4 STAR IF THE FILM WASNT A CLONE FOR ""NEW YORK CONFIDENTIAL"" AND MANY OTHER FILM NOIRS CREATED IN THE EARLY FIFTIES.  THE BEST PART OF THE FILM THAT MAKES IT WORTH SEEING IS THE ACTING OF LUTHER ADLER WHO ALWAYS SEEMS TO GIVE A FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE IN WHAT EVER FILM HE IS IN. ADLER'S PERFORMANCE AS ""GODFATHER"" BRINGS A CREEDENCE TO THE FILM AND MAKES IT WORTHWHILE.  KUDOS TO CLAIRE TREVOR WHO IS ALSO GIVE A FINE PERFORMANCE AS A GANGLAND MOLL.  AGAIN I GIVE THIS 4 STARS INSTEAD OF THREE FOR THESE TWO ACTORS PERFORMANCES.",1368489600,6,701,4.369230769230769
8162141,3,6301618769,"HOODLUM EMPIRE is a late-era film noir with a solid cast headed by Brian Donlevy. The story was clearly influenced by the many then-ongoing government investigations into mob and Communist activities.

SYNOPSIS--
Gang kingpin Nick Mancani's nephew (Joe) is being investigated by a Congressional committee on organized crime. The older man's violent associate (Charley) wants to make sure Joe won't be alive for his court date, but Nick refuses to allow a ""hit."" While Charley appears in front of the committee, part of Joe's story is told in flashback.

Upon returning stateside, WWII vet Joe tells his uncle he has no interest in inheriting the family ""business"" and wants to go straight. Flash to the present: After Charley's cleverly-crafted testimony implicates Joe in gang activities, he kidnaps the young man in order to kill him, but again Nick intercedes. Joe's uncle tells him that he's been set up for a fall, which Nick believes is preferable to being murdered.

At the next hearing, Joe's ex-girlfriend Connie refuses to implicate him (as ordered by Nick and Charley). Now it's Nick's turn on the stand. Will he further indict his nephew or instead offer exculpatory testimony?

As of 1/09, ""Hoodlum Empire"" was not available on DVD.

In 1955, Brian Donlevy co-starred with Cornel Wilde and and Richard Conte in the highly regarded noir, THE BIG COMBO.
