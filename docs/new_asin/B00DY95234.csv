The message comes up and says, I need to update the program  that allows me to watch the dvd. on my laptop , I forget what the program was called now.  It cost to buy the update to watch the dvd, and uptill I buy it, I have not been able to watch the dvd anymore. I am not sure if the program will damage my laptop, because I don't understand how I was able to watch it 5 times, and now I can't
watch it all.  I am very disappointed about this, and if anyone knows what I am talking about, please comment on what I need to do.  The dvd
is useless to me at this point.",1515715200,,744,3.767741935483871
