8473502,5,B0013D359Q,"I have been taking Hi-impact step classes and doing different work out dvds for about 3 years and this will KICK YOUR BUTT!!! I thought at first that this dvd is SOOOOO 80's but I gave it a try....It was SOOOO tought. I also took it to the gym w/ me (our instructor wasn't able to do class one day) and the other girls and I did the dvd for our class. It was 55mins of pain!! (good pain) This dvd is for the lower body (thighs is were I feel it). The other girls wanted to buy it for themselves after doing the video.
 This video has simple easy to follow instruction with hi impact. Alot of exercises work an area but also pinches another. This dvd works the area w/ no pinching of other places. It's easy on the back and joints. The stretching is out of this world. This is one of my fav dvds!! There are tips thrown into the workout which isn't likeable but he gives good tips and told me things I didn't know.
 If you don't have it U GOTTA BUY!!!!!! It goes by fast, even the other gilrs were like ""I's been 55 mins already?""  ""Thank GOD!!"" And REALLY works you!! Don't forget to squeeze your mucles while your doing these exercises.
  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS DVD!!!!!",1267142400,,1172,4.168141592920354
