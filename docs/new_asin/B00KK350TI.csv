8659580,2,B00KK350TI,"Beautiful scenery, grainy video, lacks clarity. Unfortunate. Lived in Japan a few years, was really looking forward to a nice video.",1461715200,,132,5.333333333333333
8659581,3,B00KK350TI,"Virtual Walks are fun and add some spice to working out on stationary equipment, but this video could be better. I took away one star because of disquieting jump-cuts that completely shatter the illusion that you're 'there' instead of in your bedroom / living room / garage. I took away another star because for something billed as ""filmed in HD"", it doesn't look that great. Whatever camera/lens combo they were using might have technically qualified as ""HD"", but played back on a 1080p upscaling DVD Player and HDTV the results are not as crisp as I'd expect. Still, for the current price of under ten dollars I prefer Virtual Walks to television or a blank wall.",1429056000,,665,4.741379310344827
8659582,5,B00KK350TI,"I own several Virtual Walks DVDs and I really love this DVD. Exercising on the treadmill is so much more fun with this DVD. You pass cherry blossom trees, a river or you cross the park of Osaka Castle. What I really like about this DVD is that it was also raining, this just makes this video much more authentic. You can see many people with umbrellas without getting wet yourself. A video is also filmed in the darkness, so you can see the beautifully lit trees of the park. The third video makes you feel like you're in a different world. You walk through the city, you pass a river and can see houses with futuristic lightning. You really feel like you're walking through Osaka yourself, as the sounds match the videos perfectly.",1428364800,,732,4.470149253731344
8659583,3,B00KK350TI,"I would have given this four stars if they had charged $7-10 instead of almost twenty American dollars for it. Here's why:

Walk 1 is a scenic daytime walk past the cherry blossoms. Peaceful and enjoyable.

Walk 3 is an engaging nighttime walk through Osaka. There's a lot to look at... also a lot of cuts and jumps, making you feel like you suddenly learned to teleport to a point 300 feet away. I get how, the way these walks are created, they can't be perfect... someone's going to run into the camera guy, or he'll get stuck behind a slow person, etc. But when you see a building in the near distance and it cuts out and suddenly you're someplace else entirely along the route... that's not a ""treadmill walk."" That's a YouTube clip video.

Now, let's talk about Walk 2.

Walk 2 is supposed to be a ""fairytale"" (their word) evening walk to a castle in/near Osaka. It's the most amateurish video I have ever paid money for. First, it begins on a bridge, where there's a guy with a bike standing at the far end, not moving as you approach him. As a female watching this video and pretending to be ""on a walk,"" my brain repeatedly red-flagged this, warning me to get off the bridge since I was walking alone and that creepy guy seemed to be waiting for me.

Finally we get past the creepy guy and onto land. For some reason, they chose a rainy day. I have no idea why. You can see rain steadily dripping off the camera person's umbrella as the video runs. Does this add authenticity? Not really, because of all the jump cuts that make it stop and then reappear in the same spot a few minutes later. There is also a very distracting red or orange dot that appears on the sides at frequent points in the video, much like a laser pointer. It appears to be related to the camera somehow, though it doesn't show up in the nighttime video-- maybe it's a reflection caused by the rain? Whatever the reason, it grabs your attention every time it pops up.

While watching this video on the treadmill, between the guy lying in wait on the bridge, the drippy umbrella, the indicator light (or whatever), plus the constant cuts to different scenery, I was thinking, ""you've got to be kidding me."" It was like no effort went into this at all. Then the walk took me along some dark, wet pathways in which the scenic cherry tree blossoms are not really visible. If this were an ACTUAL walk, I'd be thinking, ""this route sucks, why did I choose to walk through someplace this dark, and all this mud, and man, it's cold."" With all the jump cuts, they couldn't have stuck me someplace nicer? Finally we walk through the gates to the castle, see it all lit up at the top of a hill-- ta daaa!! Three seconds later, and still a long way from the castle, the camera person has turned around and started walking back, and that's the last you'll see of the castle.

I'm not going to be watching Walk 2 again. Walks 1 and 3, I will, but 2 is like getting trolled by the Virtual Walks people. It would be a good route to use in a depressing Green Day video.

Given how freely they use the aforementioned jump cuts, you might seriously want to consider looking up videos of walks through Japan on YouTube and using those on a tablet instead. I got this video (and others) because I thought they would be more or less continuous walks. The first one is okay for that, but the second two aren't, and $19.95 is a lot to ask for something YouTubers offer for free.",1425168000,3,3434,4.3463338533541345
8659584,5,B00KK350TI,"Great dvd! I love how you go through a beautiful walk with the cherry blossoms in full bloom and the sound of the birds. Then an evening walk with the lights in the background that  lead up to the beautifully stunning Osaka Castle. And last the bright, city lights and the hustle & bustle of the city. Another great one!
