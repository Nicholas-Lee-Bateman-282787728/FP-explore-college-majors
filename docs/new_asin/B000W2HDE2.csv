2961345,3,B000W2HDE2,I work in a Faith-based substance abuse treatment modality.  This dvd collection has been both controversial and educational.  There are areas of the film where it is a bit overzealous and reaching to align data with the beliefs of the pastor / presenters but overall it is quite useful for reflection and discussion.,1252627200,17,317,4.962264150943396
2961346,2,B000W2HDE2,"I was very disappointed with this movie. I purchased it because I LOVED the movie ""Sorcerers of the New Age"" that Joe Schimmel did. In that film, he backed up all of his claims meticulously with video footage from interviews, concerts, and quotations from books.

In this film, Joe Schimmel talks in a stupid, overly excited voice the entire time. He takes quotes out of context, and I even noticed that one picture he showed had been doctored. The movie was corny and just plain STUPID. If I hadn't seen other documentaries on the topic of secular musicians being possessed, I would laugh this movie off and go listen to some led zeppelin.

If you want to see a good movie on the satanic nature of rock and roll, watch ""Sorcerers of the New Age"".",1221868800,12,747,4.525925925925926
2961347,1,B000W2HDE2,I watched this just to see what it was about and wow...a big load of nonsense.  This film is the WORST kind of unfactual Christian propaganda I've ever seen.  It basically says all non-christian musicians are possessed by demons all in order to brainwash society and do Satan's bidding and it goes on and on for an hour and a half.  They even say George Harrison was trying to brainwash people into joining the occult because he sang *GASP* Hare Krishna and Hallelujah in the same song.  Don't waste your time.  This movie is STUPID.,1220572800,12,533,4.568421052631579
2961348,5,B000W2HDE2,"I watched a slightly different version of this video (the one I saw was DVD and 10 hours long). You can check them out at good fight dot org to see what's new.
Anyways, this video uses quotes of contemporary musicians being involved in the occult. They say they're possessed by other 'entities' and sometimes even write songs by means of automatic writing.
Producers of this video claim that some musicians gaining popularity, fame, and become more talented because 'they sold their soul' for rock-n-roll.
Whether you find it to be possible or not, I'd recommend you to watch entire video first, before making any conclusions.
Many well-know artists included: madonna, brintey, u2, kiss, beatles, insane clown posse, marlin manson, nine inch nails... and many-many more.

I'm sure many will think this review came from middle ages, but wait until you see the video and listen to the ACTUAL quotes artists say...",1209513600,12,911,4.993421052631579

HOWEVER, IT DOESN'T TAKE A DOCTORATE DEGREE TO SEE THAT, 1-MANY REFERENCES HAVE BEEN MADE IN MUSIC IN THE LAST DECADES TO SATAN AND THE OCCULT, 2-OUR SOCIETY IS STEADILY GOING DOWNHILL, MORALLY.

THE PRESENTATION MAY OR MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY ACCURATE, AND ITS' ASSERTION THAT ""SATAN HAS TAKEN CONTROL OF THE 'UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE' (MUSIC), AND IS USING IT TO LEAD THE WORLD TO HELL."" MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE.

BUT, THE DVD DID ""FLESH OUT"" & CLARIFY TRENDS THAT I HAVE ONLY SEEN FAINTLY, OVER THE YEARS. IT HELPED ME BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ROOTS OF EVIL INFLUENCES AND THE DEPTH OF EVIL IN THE MUSIC. I'M GLAD I BOUGHT IT.",1200528000,9,644,4.394957983193278
2961351,5,B000W2HDE2,"A must for all who understand that we battle not against flesh and blood!  How the enemy has gained ground with so many christians and the world.  Very revealing, awesome research by  Pastor Schimler!  Now one can understand what the cultural revolution was all about!!!",1369353600,6,270,4.933333333333334
2961352,5,B000W2HDE2,"I watched this whole film and was blown away by the connection between music and the devil. Up until I watched this, I had no idea that the devil was even able of using music as a weapon to the extent that he does ! This is not for the faint of heart or new beginners. I recommend you are solid in your walk with the Lord prior to watching something as extensive as this. My husband and I really enjoyed it and it was a great eye opener ! We have cleared out all of our old ""junk"" music and totally restocked on more positive music. Something that we do now that we have not done prior is actually take the time out to listen to the words of a song to understand just what message they are trying to get across. Overall, very informative, useful, smart, and accurate ! Solid in my book !!",1359331200,15,788,4.0576923076923075
2961353,5,B000W2HDE2,"Better than Hells Bells 2 documentary and that one was great.  This one touched on more subjects.

Common sense is what tells you this video is a no holds barred look on what goes on in the music industry.  If this was a video about eating foods that were bad for you no one would scoff or object and most people would wholeheartedly agree.  Yet when it comes to being careful about what we digest with our eyes and ears people seem to to think there are no consequences to our choices.",1351123200,8,486,4.25
2961354,5,B000W2HDE2,"I remember seeing this for the first time when the whole 10hr version was available on youtube. The content was so compelling that I probably watched the whole thing in a matter of days. This not only exposes the true intensions of pop music, but also of our media and deconstruction of our religious values.  They do so much more than exposing Rock n Roll. I recently purchased it here on Amazon. While it's a little dated pertaining to the times when I was I was a teen (late 90s early 00s) the message still rings true. I'd even say that it's worse now then it was, because at least it was in your face about the content. Now unfortunately number one hit songs like ""Blow my whistle"" are mainstream for all ages and are seen as no big deal. I highly recommend this.",1350086400,14,768,4.333333333333333
2961355,3,B000W2HDE2,"I have the 10 hr set of they sold their soul for rock n roll and I recently bought this 3 hr version so I could have more dvd disc to share with people.  I liked the 10 hr set better because it had the major 60's and 70's band on one disc that I could let friends and coworkers borrow.  The 3 hr dvd seemed very preachy and I wish it had more facts about the bands and kept the preachy stuff for the end of the dvd.  It would be nice if the dvd had a menu option by bands.  It just seems that if your trying to convince someone that music is bad, then you would want to present the music band facts first while the person is interested in watching and then present the scripture info and extra side stuff.  With this 3 hr dvd I'm afraid too many people will turn it off while waiting through the scripture info, discussions and extra stuff that's not band based facts.  I wish the 3 hr dvd discussed the Eagles and their Hotel California song like the 10 hr set.",1333584000,5,962,3.984375
2961356,4,B000W2HDE2,"This DVD is not for children! Yet the amazing thing is most parents do allow there children to sit and soak this stuff in day after day. my wife could not watch it after the first 2 episodes. It's too shocking.

If you are riding the fence on this issue, you need to see this. I gave it to a guy at our church who doesn't profess to be a serious Christian. He couldn't watch it after a few episodes but he got rid of his entire music collection afterwards. He said he didn't want this filth infiltrating his home and corrupting his children (and that's from a non-Christian). Buy it, watch it, pass it around. Get more copies for friends.",1331856000,10,638,4.2727272727272725
2961357,5,B000W2HDE2,"First let me say I have the full 10 hour 4 DVD set, There are also a 3 hour version and 4 hour version which will do just as good a job showing you much of this important information. Every Christian should watch this and really every parent should watch this. And also make a decision about showing it to there children; and at what age, there is some very very disturbing stuff on hear, including abortions and dead babies. The argument is made hear that abortions have increased because of the moral decline brought about in our nation partly by rock music. Other effects, STDs, Violence, and Rebellion. Its depressing to me because I love much of this music; Of course I avoid overtly satanic stuff, but this DVD set makes me think I must avoid a whole lot more.

I have know for a long time, back in the late 70s about Rock N Roll Artists being involved in the Occult, Cults, etc., And as I said I avoid those, But Did I understand the scope and span of it, No not by a long shot. For example I knew someone like Elvis had problems with infidelity, and substance abuse, not the signs of a Christian, but I though he might be a Christian (he did gospel music), I did not realize he preached a different Jesus, a new age Jesus and was a disciple of Madam Bovanski, a satanists, who influenced Adolph Hitler, a well. Elvis uses Jesus as a cover for his depravity, what a shame. Unlike most of these types of sermons this one is not just an attack piece on Hard Rock, but takes on all forms of pop music, from Boy bands to Heavy Metal from Pop to Rap to hip Hop to Blues, Country, no genre is left out, and not about trivial maters. This 10 hour versions comprehensively covers music from the 1950s right up to today.

Its amazing to me how many music artists claim they have sold there soul's to satan, (even Katy Parry said so just recently). Also how many artists say they are being taken over or possessed in stage or in learning to play an instrument, write songs and or on stage is staggering and how many believe in spirit and muses who help them write there songs. Many admit they are pushing an agenda though there music. By there own words they are condemned. Its amazing how open it all is, how they admit what they are doing. You will get a good feel hear for satanism as well, and how it set out to use music to reach the masses. You will find out about Robert Johnson and his Crossroads and you will find out the importance of that.

Disk (DVD) 2 is especially good, we get a great History of how we get to this point today. There is a change of command sort of speak among the satanists and it is detailed hear. From Alester Crowley and his very sick beliefs and writings and lifestyle to his main disciples such as Timothy Leary (Mr LSD), Harry Hey (pro Gay Activists), Dr Kinsley (Of the kinsley report which was inaccurate), Anton LaVey (founder of the church of satan), Carlos Castranada (occultists), Jack Parsons (who JPL was named after they don't use JETS at NASA), Adolph Hitler, the OSO, L.Ron Hubbard (of scientology fame) and how these all had there disciples as well. We see how so many Rock (Music) starts are hooked up to A. Crowley either directly or indirectly. On Disk 2 we get great (and terrible) coverage of the Doors, The Beatles, The Rollings Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and the Beach Boys. Many others are covered as well. We see how there music, lyrics and there lives are effected we hear from the artists themselves from interviews, writings and lyrics. We see how the teachings and beliefs of A. Crowley are represented in such much of the music. One startling fact the avarage age of an American is around 76, the Average age of a rock star is 36. This disk is a must view for everyone and makes getting the ten hour version worthwhile.

In closing I want to say this is a must have, everyone should get informed about what is really going on.",1323648000,6,3911,4.368131868131868
2961358,1,B000W2HDE2,"I was greatly anticipating this purchase.  I bought the 10 hr version for $40 expecting this to be chalk full of accurate and conspiracy ridden compelling information.  Wow, what I got was far from that.  The first dvd (one of four) sends a message that homosexuality and contraceptives are very sinful - and that's all.  It has nothing to due with music.  I thought I was going to see how bands and pop culture icons were using demonic powers to influence and steer their success.  Instead I basically got a 10 hr dvd set preaching against abortion, homosexuals, school shootings, and serial killers.  It even goes as far as not distinguishing between child molesters and homosexuals which I found on a personal level completely unacceptable.  All this type of attitude does is create hatred.  I've been a born again believer for over twenty years and this video as appalling.  I know a lot about pop culture and was completely appalled at how the guy who made the video connected satanic behavior with certain artists.  It was far reaching and completely sensationalized to say the least.  At 8 1/2 hours in, I was forced to turn the video off.  By the third cd, the guy who made the video starts talking about Hollywood and actors instead of musicians.  Then the fourth cd is about serial killers and gives interviews with Jeffrey Dalmer, Manson, etc.  It was so disturbing and the images depicted of hell became so graphic that I had to immediately get up and turn it off.  I didn't want to fill my mind with that poison.  Basically the cd set uses inaccurate information to preach out against any type of rock and roll.  He made a good point with the bands like Led Zeppelin and the Doors - but there was overall too less of this and too much bogus info with other artists.  The stuff on Aliester Crowely, Jim Morrison, Robert Plant, Robert Johnson, and Jimmy Page was super interesting but I wanted more.  That stuff might be legit but the rest of the 9 hrs was complete and utter trash.  You'd have to be pretty naive and gullible to believe the information presented here.  It just bothers me so much when people who are Christians twist the truth - That's the kind of behaviors that give Christians a bad name and why people think we are nuts.  This documentary completely fed into that.  The material presented was totally bias, and was done in a bad way.  It didn't depict different views.  It was narrow-minded and lacked evidence for many of the conclusions reached.  The dvds were extremely ""preachy"" and it seemed like the intend was to save your soul at the end of the film instead of providing solid information about musicians and the music industry.

Now I've been researching the occult and government conspiracies for a while and this video was just not a plethora of information.  You'd be much better off educating yourself through a book by Jim Marrs or such.  This was 9hrs of bunk bull and about 1 hr. of good stuff.  Maybe the 3 hr. version is better.  Hopefully it cuts out a lot of the crap.  Overall a big disappointment.  :(",1269907200,25,3055,4.5962962962962965
2961359,5,B000W2HDE2,"Wow! You won't believe your eyes! This is an extraordinary expose documentary about the truly dark intention behind Rock/Metal/R&B and Pop music. At first I was skeptical being the daughter of a rock musician and music lover. But when they presented case after case of indisputable evidence, much of which came directly from the artists themselves own admissions. It was impossible to deny. Music I thought was seemingly innocent is actually meant to subtly deceive and mislead the listeners. It's a hard pill to swallow but the truth will set you free. I would strongly recommend this documentary to anyone who loves music and thinks that it doesn't influence them negatively. This documentary has made a huge difference in my life.",1266364800,31,733,5.066115702479339

3195855,1,B000W2HDE2,"I was greatly anticipating this purchase.  I bought the 10 hr version for $40 expecting this to be chalk full of accurate and conspiracy ridden compelling information.  Wow, what I got was far from that.  The first dvd (one of four) sends a message that homosexuality and contraceptives are very sinful - and that's all.  It has nothing to due with music.  I thought I was going to see how bands and pop culture icons were using demonic powers to influence and steer their success.  Instead I basically got a 10 hr dvd set preaching against abortion, homosexuals, school shootings, and serial killers.  It even goes as far as not distinguishing between child molesters and homosexuals which I found on a personal level completely unacceptable.  All this type of attitude does is create hatred.  I've been a born again believer for over twenty years and this video as appalling.  I know a lot about pop culture and was completely appalled at how the guy who made the video connected satanic behavior with certain artists.  It was far reaching and completely sensationalized to say the least.  At 8 1/2 hours in, I was forced to turn the video off.  By the third cd, the guy who made the video starts talking about Hollywood and actors instead of musicians.  Then the fourth cd is about serial killers and gives interviews with Jeffrey Dalmer, Manson, etc.  It was so disturbing and the images depicted of hell became so graphic that I had to immediately get up and turn it off.  I didn't want to fill my mind with that poison.  Basically the cd set uses inaccurate information to preach out against any type of rock and roll.  He made a good point with the bands like Led Zeppelin and the Doors - but there was overall too less of this and too much bogus info with other artists.  The stuff on Aliester Crowely, Jim Morrison, Robert Plant, Robert Johnson, and Jimmy Page was super interesting but I wanted more.  That stuff might be legit but the rest of the 9 hrs was complete and utter trash.  You'd have to be pretty naive and gullible to believe the information presented here.  It just bothers me so much when people who are Christians twist the truth - That's the kind of behaviors that give Christians a bad name and why people think we are nuts.  This documentary completely fed into that.  The material presented was totally bias, and was done in a bad way.  It didn't depict different views.  It was narrow-minded and lacked evidence for many of the conclusions reached.  The dvds were extremely ""preachy"" and it seemed like the intend was to save your soul at the end of the film instead of providing solid information about musicians and the music industry.

Now I've been researching the occult and government conspiracies for a while and this video was just not a plethora of information.  You'd be much better off educating yourself through a book by Jim Marrs or such.  This was 9hrs of bunk bull and about 1 hr. of good stuff.  Maybe the 3 hr. version is better.  Hopefully it cuts out a lot of the crap.  Overall a big disappointment.  :(",1269907200,25,3055,4.5962962962962965
3195856,5,B000W2HDE2,"Wow! You won't believe your eyes! This is an extraordinary expose documentary about the truly dark intention behind Rock/Metal/R&B and Pop music. At first I was skeptical being the daughter of a rock musician and music lover. But when they presented case after case of indisputable evidence, much of which came directly from the artists themselves own admissions. It was impossible to deny. Music I thought was seemingly innocent is actually meant to subtly deceive and mislead the listeners. It's a hard pill to swallow but the truth will set you free. I would strongly recommend this documentary to anyone who loves music and thinks that it doesn't influence them negatively. This documentary has made a huge difference in my life.",1266364800,31,733,5.066115702479339

This is the type of narrow minded, zealous, garbage, that hate groups like the Westboro Baptist Church would use to support their own morally misaligned causes.  Schimmel needs to be silenced.  Not because he's the ""messenger of truth"" he'd have you believe he is, but because he advocates his own personal brand of brainwashing that is far to akin to the type he demonized (pun intended) in this so called documentary.  He is a charlatan and a better businessman than a pastor , using the guise of the church and Christianity as a means to take in profit off of his D-list exposition",1432857600,2,655,4.7105263157894735

Fantastic movie and a must-have if you are a parent or simply concerned about young people and anyone at any age still influenced by modern music to their great detriment and possible destruction.

8221071,5,B000W2HDE2,"I agree with a previous review that there are areas of the film where it is a bit overzealous. That being said, most of it is very well done and a good source for anyone willing to learn things that might go against your personal preferences. Some of the evidence he brings forth is so blatantly obvious, you wonder how you didn't catch that yourself! The fact that he is overzealous on a couple things may lead someone to label all of it as over the top if it's a reality they don't want to face. As someone else said, this is NOT FOR KIDS; but with what parents are letting their kids watch these days, who knows.",1394755200,2,615,4.220338983050848
8221072,1,B000W2HDE2,"This movie has been making the rounds at my church. I watched it to see what it would uncover. I am not sorry to say that this type of one-sided dialogue and abuse of scripture and context is the reason why so many young people have turned away from the church; they dismiss it as an organization that simply hates all forms of culture and imposes rigid laws and lifestyle. I have no doubt that Joe Schimmel loves God, and wishes to serve Jesus Christ as best he can, but the implications of accepting his arguments are thus: Christians cannot: listen to non-Christian music, read non-Christian books, watch non-Christian movies or plays, eat non-Christian food, wear non-Christian clothes, say non-Christian words, have non-Christian friends, etc. His abuse and unbalanced approach to scripture does no justice to the inspired word of God. He is at best ethnocentric, at worst downright racist, towards anything from ""the east"", and frequently denounces artists as ""eastern"". The type of faith that Schimmel advances is close-minded, fear-based, has a narrow interpretation of scripture, and does not espouse the true love and beauty of God. No doubt there are messed up people and messed up rock stars who open themselves up to evil, but if all you are looking for is evil in the world (as pastor Schimmel does), then of course you are going to find it.",1390262400,15,1355,4.87012987012987
8221073,1,B000W2HDE2,"I was subjected to this series twice in my life as a child in private Christian school. As I look back on it, I see how Cross TV engineered a brilliant and terrifying look at the secular world which was used to scare children in fearing that rock-and-roll stars would be attempting to recruit their eternal souls to Satan. As an adult now, with the ability to research things and have a more mature understanding about, art, imagery, metaphor and the entertainment business in general aren't battling for souls, they're simply providing the same entertainment that's been around since the Greek Tragedy, escape from reality.

Aleister Crowley is referenced heavily in this series, and he is treated like the devil, as some sort of mystical occult meeting-point. His number one crime in this video is that he was a homosexual (Crowley was Bisexual) but Crowley was NOT a Satanist. The Blues are also heavily blamed, as this paved the way for people to start selling their souls to the Devil for fame and fortune. Basically, this entire video barrage is bunch of bigotry and anti-intellectual propaganda, that can only use the Bible as a source for a moral-code.

The end of the tape is a bunch of old, white men, who claimed to have been to Hell or left their bodies and experienced the Supernatural. They then beg the viewers to turn to Jesus, and away from rock music.

Music is also blamed for drug use, sexual experimentation, satanic invocation, riots and violence like rape and murder. There is no scientific evidence, psychological evidence, only Judeo-Christian values guiding what young people should be interpreting as art, thought and self-expression. Which is understood, when the institution pushing these videos is run by bigoted, racist, misogynist anti-intellectuals who must defend their hold on the country by convincing them that listening to Elvis will send you straight to HELL.",1389657600,12,1898,5.0
