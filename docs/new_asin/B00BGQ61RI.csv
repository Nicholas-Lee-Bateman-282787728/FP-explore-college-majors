8568283,5,B00BGQ61RI,"For the serious taijiquan student, in addition to the solo and 4-hands pushing hands forms, the mastery of the da lu two-person form is a must.  And yet it is rarely taught in most taijiquan academies, the teachers preferring to instruct the flashier weapons forms or to purely focus on the solo form.  My own teacher, almost thirty years ago, briefly taught it to me and my classmates, but either out of boredom or his averred love for the solo sword form, abruptly abandoned it and left us to our own resources to keep our study of da lu fresh and viable. And so, after more than two decades of lack of practice, I forgot it.

Now thanks to Sam Masich and his martial arts production company, this important martial art form is again accessible to me, and soon to my advanced students when I introduce the form to them.  This DVD is excellent in every way--professionally-shot and narrated, it is clear in both concept and execution.  Unlike many martial arts DVD's, it repeats the component moves over and over again, and illustrates them from different angles--side, overhead, front, and rear.  Unlike so many martial arts instructional videos, it explains the why of the various moves, not just the what. This instructional approach makes it so easy for the dedicated student to see and analyze every move in the form, and with time and perseverance, eventually master it.

Truly, this DVD is a treasure.  If you would like to learn (or re-learn) da lu, this DVD is the perfect tool, and I strongly recommend it for the serious student or teacher of taijiquan.",1372377600,,1565,4.706959706959707
