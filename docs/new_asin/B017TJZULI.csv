8740651,5,B017TJZULI,"Two excellent Chaney pictures from his freelance years.  Both in reasonably good, clear condition with tinting, though ""Wicked Darling"" has some mildew damage.  My only complaint is that there is no disc menu, no chapters, and one movie just comes after the other.  But you can navigate to the beginning of the second using ""move to time"" in your controls, so not too big a deal.  A real treat to have these two movies finally available for a reasonable price.",1455753600,3,460,4.7125
