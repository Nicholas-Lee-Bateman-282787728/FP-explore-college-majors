8312522,5,B001JAHQ9S,Love Ken Curtis as Festus.  I was tired of Chester.  Think Season 10 was worth waiting for and glad it was in black and white.  Hope Season 11 is also in black and white and hope Festus will get his badge.,1410393600,,205,3.951219512195122
8312523,5,B001JAHQ9S,"Season 10 of Gunsmoke aired during the 1964-1965 season. This season is interesting because it features the second  opening gunfight with Matt Dillon right outside the ""Dodge Stage Depot"" . With Chester written off the show, Festus takes his place. Another black and white season here with some great episodes! The show turns color in season 12 so it's getting there! Volume 1 and 2 are to be released on August 12, 2014.",1401062400,2,421,4.767123287671233
8312524,5,B001JAHQ9S,"I, too, have Sseasons 1 thru 9 and do not understand what is taking so long for Season 10 to be offered!  as another customer stated, the generation that will purchase Gunsmoke DVDs is fast disappearing!  I gave 10 stars because I am sure that is what it will be.",1395792000,4,263,4.24
8312525,5,B001JAHQ9S,I have enjoyed the first nine episodes of Gunsmoke and am sure I would enjoy Season 10 if and when it is ever released.  What in the world is taking so long?  Will I still be living to enjoy it when it arrives?  My children surely won't miss it.  The generation that will always buy new releases of Gunsmoke is fading fast.  Either get it out there where we can buy it or get stuck with it after we are gone. Guess you can tell I'm frustrated.  Let's have a little service here.,1393545600,6,478,4.086021505376344
