4049208,2,B0031KQNUM,"This 3 hour TV movie from Germany is dubbed and dumb.  The back stories occupy 2/3 of the movie and are as exciting as a root canal.
The effects are below average and by the time the tornadoes reach Berlin, who cares?
The dubbing is so bad it's hard to judge the performances.  Every cliche in the book is found in this dud.  A 3 hour waste of time.",1271980800,,349,4.028985507246377
4049209,1,B0031KQNUM,"The film was in German, with one or two people doing the dubbing. Thiis was like those 1950s flics, when you had no idea who was speaking: they all sounded alike. Also, it took 45 minutes before I had any idea who the main characters were. There was no story line, just random events with differing characters. Finally, we got some characters, but very uninteresting ones. The menage a trois was the big story!

A waste. Oh, it was listed as ""120 minutes"" on the case. Must be metric minutes: the film ran 3 hours.",1271635200,3,514,4.410526315789474
4049210,4,B0031KQNUM,"Not a bad film.  I really enjoyed the family storyline that made you feel for the characters when they came face to face with huge tornados. If you like disaster action type films you will definitely like this one. Check out the synopsis- A heat wave, a devastating tennis ball size hail storm, and a dead farmer all leave the local police mystified; but for experienced Meteorologist's, January Berger, these are warning signs to a bigger natural disaster. A relentless storm is about to hit the center of town and with no advanced warning system in place residents are left to fend for themselves! As the massive twisters rip a path of destruction though the city, will anyone make it out alive?

8387037,1,B0031KQNUM,It is obvious the movie was made in German and dubbed in English. You could see that by watching the  actor's lips.  The conflict between father and son was not the best written. That I think comes from the dubbing and the writting of the movie. Had I know it was like this I would not have purchased it.,1278288000,3,304,4.135593220338983
