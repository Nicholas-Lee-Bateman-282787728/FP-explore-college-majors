3686071,3,B001LM6VTU,"""Appaloosa"" is an awkward, lumbering western, telling a half-hearted story about painfully underdeveloped characters. Having not read Robert B. Parker's original novel, I can't say how faithful this adaptation is. For Parker's sake, let's hope the film is a drastic departure. The dialogue is clunky, it's often unbearably slow, and for a plot that was meant to be a character study, it's remarkably vague. Ed Harris functions as the star, the co-writer, and the director, which isn't to imply that one role has any influence over the others; he is now and always has been a wonderful actor, but his storytelling skills leave a lot to be desired. Maybe he wasn't meant to be a director. Or maybe he wasn't meant to direct this particular film. Whatever the case, ""Appaloosa"" plunges into a story so stagnant and lifeless that it barely rises to the level of mediocrity. I expected so much more, not only because it's a genre film, but also because it employed a number of notable talents, not the least of which are Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Jeremy Irons, and Rene Zellweger.

Taking place in 1882 in the town of Appaloosa, New Mexico, the film begins when a rancher named Randall Bragg (Irons) guns down the local sheriff and his deputy. Apparently, they had come to arrest a few of Bragg's men for murdering a mine inspector and the mine inspector's wife. Bragg believes he's above the law, claiming to have ties with the President of the United States. Desperate to bring law and order back to Appaloosa, the town leaders, led by Phil Olson (Timothy Spall), recruit two straight shooters named Virgil Cole (Harris) and Everett Hitch (Mortensen). It's hard to know how to feel about these characters; they're engaging as mysterious figures, yet there's a mellowness that makes them seem far less interesting. Cole usually drones in western clichs while Hitch usually chimes in as his Yes Man. He also helps Cole by occasionally feeding him sophisticated words. You can't really call them friends, although they often share their feelings with one another. It would be more accurate to say that they've grown accustomed to each other's faces, which is to be expected after being partners for who knows how long.

Without warning, a woman named Allison French (Zellweger) enters the picture. Initially, no one has any idea who she is or why she came to Appaloosa. All anyone knows is that she likes Cole. A lot. But why, especially since she only just met him? It takes far too long for the film to reveal her true nature: She just wants the security of a man, specifically a man who's in charge. If it appears that Cole is no longer a powerful man of the law, she will willingly advance on someone else (Hitch learns this the hard way). What I don't understand is why she would travel to such a small Southwestern desert town to find Mr. Right. Why not go to a city with investors, bankers, and politicians, like Chicago or New York? I find it unlikely that someone so desperate for affection would settle for Appaloosa. I also find it unlikely that Cole would even consider falling in love. He's really nothing more than a hired killer for a lawless town, not at all the type to settle down into domestic life. When Allison announces that she and Cole will be moving into a little house that's under construction, I was completely taken aback; Cole would never let his happen so quickly.

The real problem here is that there's absolutely no chemistry between Harris and Zellweger. They played their parts as best they could, but something just wasn't clicking--there was no sense of romance or even raw sexual tension. The only plausible relationship in ""Appaloosa"" is the one between Harris and Mortensen, and even then, something isn't quite right. Their characters are men of so few words that they're hopelessly dull. When they do speak, the amateurish dialogue undermines them, making them far less appealing than they should be. Cole and Hitch had the potential to be very interesting characters, especially if the filmmakers had bothered to expand on their personal histories. We simply don't know who these men are, and that's bad because it makes what little we do know seem unimportant.

As for Jeremy Irons, there's no denying he's a master at playing villains. Indeed, Bragg is cold, arrogant, and remorseless, able to charm his way out of just about anything. His arrest and subsequent murder trail pave the way for an unavoidable shootout scene, which is resolved so quickly it's just shy of anticlimactic. What's worse is that everything building up to the shootout is agonizingly slow-paced; we see scene after scene of someone walking away before turning around, glancing solemnly at someone else, turning back, and continuing to walk away. I won't reveal which characters are involved in such scenes, although it's hardly relevant given how predictable the ending is. How much unease and regret does a western need, especially when it all comes so late in the story? And why are these emotions wasted on characters we know virtually nothing about? I'm sure some will argue that ""Appaloosa"" was meant to be obscure, considering the mysterious nature of the main characters. But the way I see it, there's a big difference between obscurity and something that just wasn't fully developed. This movie is clumsy, inexplicable, and boring, something I never would have expected from the likes of Ed Harris.",1223164800,5,5419,4.8805646036916395

In ""Appaloosa,"" which is set in the New Mexican territory of 1882, Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen are a pair of frontier lawmen hired by the citizens of Appaloosa to wrest control of the town from a gang of ruffians (led by Jeremy Irons) after they shoot down the marshal and his deputies in cold blood.  Renee Zellweger also shows up as a promiscuous widow who captures the eye and eventually the heart of the newly appointed sheriff (Harris).

Co-written by Harris and Robert Knott (from a novel by Robert B. Parker) and directed (rather ploddingly) by Harris, ""Appaloosa"" pays homage to the time-honored traditions of the Western genre, as the forces of Good, represented by Harris and Mortensen, square off against the forces of Evil, embodied by Irons and his cohorts.

There's not much that is truly new here, except perhaps for a refreshingly novel moral slackness in the lead female character.  Yet, while the characterizations are rich, the relationships complex and the performances authentic, the movie itself suffers from a bad case of inertia, loping along at an enervating pace when it should be racing ahead at a full-on gallop.

There's substance of a sort to ""Appaloosa;"" it's just a question of whether you'll be able to stay awake long enough to fully absorb and appreciate it.",1223164800,14,1302,4.8954545454545455
3686073,4,B001LM6VTU,"Just had to title this with one of my favorite NYTimes crossword answers.  Depending on the degree of puzzle difficulty, the clue is usually something like ""'High Noon', e.g.""  Appaloosa is no classic High Noon, but it is an homage and a slight satiric wink to the classic Western genre.  Ed Harris and Viggo Mortenson are the good guys and Jeremy Irons, a long way from Brideshead, is the very, very bad guy.  There is the no-nonsense but kindly prostitute, and then there is Renee Zellweger, a puzzle and a pleasure to good and bad alike, and -- to me -- even confounding after the movie is ended.  The dialogue is largely laconic, the violence rapid, at both expected and unexpected moments.  Mostly, though, Appaloosa is a well-acted, well-scripted and entertaining yarn.  If you stick around through the credits, you even get to hear Ed Harris sing country.",1223164800,3,862,4.783783783783784
3686074,5,B001LM6VTU,"Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen star as two talented town tamers in APPALOOSA.  The movie hit the big screen this weekend and I took one of my sons to the first showing early this afternoon.  We both had a good time, and my trust and confidence in the stars was well deserved.

The movie is based on the novel written by bestselling author, Robert B. Parker.  Parker has been writing the adventures of Spenser, a private eye born in Laramie, Wyoming, for years, and Spenser is as rough and tumble as any gunfighter in the Old West.  Lately, the author has successfully dipped his quill into the Western arena.

I read the book when it came out a few years ago and had a good time with it.  I enjoyed the camaraderie of the two heroes in the novel, and was pleased to see it reflected in the movie.  Ed Harris plays Virgil Cole, one of the most feared and respected lawmen in the Old West.  Viggo Mortensen stars as Everett Hitch, Cole's dedicated and deadly right hand man.

The book creates a tight plot line with a lot of twists and turns.  When I read it, I saw how easily it could become a screenplay.  Parker writes lean, muscular prose.  Obviously Ed Harris saw the same thing because he negotiated the rights to star and direct in the film.

APPALOOSA starts off with a bang.  Three of them, in fact.  Bragg, a powerful man in the small but growing town of Appaloosa, faces the town marshal and defends two of his men that raped and killed a man and his wife.  When the marshal doesn't take no for an answer, Bragg kills the marshal and his two deputies.

Virgil and Everett arrive and Harris takes advantage of those couple moments to establish sweeping shots of the desolate countryside.  Harris stays primarily with the characters and the action, but there are a lot of opportunities to shoot the sweeping landscape.  The action takes place in Appaloosa, outside of town, in the hills and mountains, and in another small town with Mexican architecture.

I loved the detailed Old West setting.  The bar and buildings look and feels well-researched.  The house Virgil is buying on the outside of town is incredibly small by today's standards, but Allie (Renee Zellweger) acts excited about having it built.

Of all the characters in the movie, Zellweger - in my opinion - has the hardest time pulling off her role.  The character is complicated because she bounces between a sympathetic and nave woman to a cold and calculating one.  This type of female character often shows up in Parker's work, so long-time fans won't be surprised to watch her in action.  However, Zellweger's performance actually softens the character from the book.

Parker likes showing the dichotomy between the strong, silent male and one that can be twisted around a conniving woman's little finger.  Many of his characters have suffered through that in his novels.  That paradigm is understated and succinct in the movie, but it still works well.

The author has also penned a sequel that came out this year, RESOLUTION.  He has one more planned that will tie up Virgil and Everett's saga.

The film's action is compelling.  The movie and the actors keep a lot of balls in play.  The sound effects on the gunshots are especially well done.  Many viewers might not be able to tell it, but the gunshots sound like heavy thumps, from coarse black powder rather than the cleaner-burning cordite all of today's rounds are made with.

There is a moment of brief nudity and the language is rough in a couple places, but not in any way that will be overly offensive.  I think APPALOOSA is a modern tribute to yesterday's Western movies in a lot of ways.  The heroes are brave and noble, but they're also flawed.  Harris and Mortensen play those iconic lawmen to the hilt with a hint of swagger and elegance by the bushelful.  If you're a Western fan, this is a movie you'll enjoy.  And if you haven't seen a Western in a while, this is one you don't want to miss.",1223078400,6,3938,4.583094555873926
3686075,4,B001LM6VTU,"""Appaloosa"" combines the best of traditional and modern Westerns. Ed Harris, who directs as well as stars in the film, has created a great combination of the two perpectives in this adaptation of the Robert B. Parker (Spenser For Hire) novel.

Harris plays Virgil Cole, who with his partner Everett Hitch (played by Viggo Mortensen), roams the West as hired guns who come in and tame towns where lawlessness reigns. Such is the case in Appaloosa, which is run by rancher Randall Bragg, who killed the town marshal (an old friend of Cole's) and his two deputies. Cole and Hitch begin the cleanup process straightaway, but everything becomes complicated with the appearance in town of Allison French (played by Renee Zellweger), a young widow who captures the heart of crusty Cole and soon, the hardened lawman moves in her. But later, she comes on Hitch, setting the stage for issues of life, future, and loyalty to be explored while the lawmen deal with the woman and the wily Bragg, who has a few tricks up his sleeve.

The look, feel, and the tone feels very traditional, but the screenplay and action are more modern in their staging, which means the language is saltier, and the action faster, just as it would be in real life. Harris and Mortensen seem like they have been acting in Westerns their entire career. Zellweger hits the right notes as a woman  who does what she has to do to survive.

This is a great film, and one that most Western fans should readily enjoy.",1223078400,3,1476,4.665384615384616
3686076,5,B001LM6VTU,"While coming slow, westerns seem to be coming back. This one is not the best I have seen but I could easily put it in the top 20 of the westerns I have seen. I am 58 and have seen every western ever made. Well every one worth watching.
You don't need to know the plot. (It's not about a horse). Appaloosa is the name of the town. It's the usual evil against good. If you like westerns it's a must see.
The acting is top notch. Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen do exceptional work. Better than average. All characters were good in the film. Many unknown to me.
The cinematography was outstanding. About as good as the recent 3:10 to Yuma film. It gave a very authenticity to the time. The camera angles and lighting to create good contrast were well done. Time of day created good mood such as dusk and early morning scenes. Windy and dusty was the flavor of the town at times. Dirty and dusty clothes create realism. Part of the film is done on a train. Excellent sound from the steam engine. There are some wonderful camera angles during this part. The train is authentic. Not some european high pitched whistle train. From the train scene they lose their prisoner and must track him on horseback. Excellent scenery and mighty fine horses.
There is some humor in this film which adds to the enjoyment. Of course there is a woman or two to add to the plot. A little bit of everything.
Some nice weapons thrown in for the enjoyment.
I enjoyed it very much. It was a good one to see in the theatre.",1223078400,2,1493,4.316725978647687
3686077,4,B001LM6VTU,"If you don't mind a slow burn western, Appaloosa has much to admire. The acting by both Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen is outstanding and the dialogue is believable for the most part. There is even some good humor thrown in, especially in the first half of the movie. While not as dark and gritty as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, Ed Harris has created a western that never seems to be in a hurry. It has a nice relaxing feel to it, though the last half could have been trimmed up a bit. There isn't much action at all, and when there is, it is over in no time. Which is realistic (The real gunfight at the O.K. Corral was over in 30 seconds), but might not please the average person who paid $10.00 to see 3:10 to Yuma (2007 version) all over again.

When all else fails theres a lot of great scenery to get your attention and the ending is well worth the wait.

3686097,5,B001LM6VTU,"As a student of the west this story is more authentic than any film I've yet seen.  All the elements are there.  A single psychopathic killer who bullies not only the public but law enforcement and potential witnesses such that law doesn't apply to him.  In marginal areas near to Mexico this was often the case because the prospects of thievery of Mexican cattle drew such characters to those regions.  In fact the Bragg character could have been based on King Fisher of south Texas.  After Fisher's friend, a savage gunsman named Ben Thompson, murdered one of San Antonio's most popular citizens Thompson beat the rap in court, but was later assassinated by a group of San Antonio vigilantes just as Bragg is killed in this film.  At the time that Thompson committed this murder he was the City Marshall of Austin, which shows how a vicious gunsman can bully a town into making him their law enforcement officer.  Fisher was also a Deputy in nearby Uvalde.  Cities hired gunsmen out of fear or desperation, and both are depicted here, and such men were unpredictabily violent to citizens.  The events in this film all have their basis in actual facts.  Even the Zellweger character is true to form as a desperate opportunist, and so is Harris' need for her despite her lack of any love for him.  That kind of real yet dysfunctional relationship is all too common and almost never depicted in film.  It is a great story.",1506211200,3,1421,4.662650602409639

Ed Harris plays Virgil Cole perfectly, he won't shake hands..  ""I never saw much good comin' from letting another man get ahold of you"".  He's always trying to expand his vocabulary so he reads a lot.  Hitch has to help him find the word he's looking for sometimes, ""Virgill has a vocabulary so big he hasn't figured out how to use it yet"" says Hitch.

Harris explains how they came up with the ""eight gauge"" side-by-side shotgun for the movie, almost a character in the story itself.  In this book series, Hitch is a very large man but Mortinson does such an excellent job of bringing the character to life he seems like a better fit that the book image.

3686167,5,B001LM6VTU,"I grew up watching Westerns; some were good, some were bad, and a very few were truly excellent examples of film making.
""The Searchers"" and ""High Noon,"" are as good, for instance, as any movie ever made both for the quality of the writing and for the nuanced performances of the actors. Those two films, and a handful of others, are more than cowboy movies featuring iron-jawed heroes who are quick on the draw. Instead, they are psychological profiles of the men, and women, who settled the West at a time when ""the law"" was often non-existent in any real sense. They are films that transcend any specific genre.
""Appaloosa"" isn't quite in that same category but it is an excellent movie; one that deals realistically with the tenor of the times. It features great writing, wonderful performances - especially by Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen - and beautiful cinematography.
The premise is straightforward. A small New Mexico town is under the thumb of a greedy rancher who runs roughshod over the people and businesses of Appaloosa. The rancher - nicely played by Jeremy Irons - is, among other things, a killer who has murdered the town marshal and his two deputies. In response to their murders, the town's leaders contract with Virgil Cole (Harris) and Everett Hitch (Mortensen) to bring him to justice and end his reign of terror.
Cole and Hitch are itinerant ""lawmen"" who have worked together for a dozen years. They are not idealists and they hold no illusions about who they are and what they do. Killing is not something they enjoy, nor is it something they are conflicted about; it is simply what they do when it needs to be done. They are not especially nice people but they are good at their jobs.
And they are friends.
True friends.
Harris and Mortensen, who are longtime friends in real life, bring that sense of brotherly comradeship to the screen in subtle ways. Their characters have been together long enough, have seen and done enough, that they understand one another completely. They have been partners for so long - and been in enough life-and-death situations together - that they have no need for long conversations; a nod here, a facial expression there, and a small gesture are all they really need to communicate.
But change, in the form of a shapely widow played by Renee Zellweger, is in the wind. She arrives in town with a dollar in her purse and no prospects. Almost without thinking, Cole helps her get a job as a piano player at the town's only hotel after a conversation in which she embarrasses him when he asks if she is a whore.
Cole is fascinated by her for reasons that he can't quite explain. She is unlike any woman he has ever met in the past and it's not long before he - quite uncharacteristically - begins courting her. In the end that leads to trouble but to reveal any more of the plot would spoil the movie and it's not my intention to do that. I will simply say that Zellweger's character - Allie French - is a very complicated woman.
""Appaloosa"" is what I would call a ""quiet"" movie. The dialogue is not verbose; the humor is understated, and the gunfights are over in a flash. The closing scene is as dramatic as any I've seen in the past 20 years and illustrates perfectly the relationship that Hitch and Cole have developed over their many years together.
In short, this is a 5-star film and a movie I highly recommend.",1475971200,12,3375,4.607973421926911

This story of two good men who dare to enforce the law where no one will for fear of reprisal and death.  Both firmly believe in their ethos to serve honorably and by the law but both lawmen are keenly aware that the law only goes so far before it is bent and manipulated by those in power.  Renee Zellweger is, despite her less that usually pleasant appearance apparent following facial surgery, excellent in this story as she becomes the pivot of the story and Vigo Mortensen absolutely nails his character of true love and sacrifice for his myopic brother-at-arms Ed Harris.  Ed Harris' acting and direction of this cast and cinematographic crew was nothing less than exceptional and for this reason this Western is among the Best Ever, meriting A MUST SEE rating by all cowboys-at-heart.

But then my wife and I heard the second song (after ""Scare Easy"" by Mudcrutch) that played during the credits, ""You'll Never Leave My Heart,"" which I discovered was written and sung by the Director and star, Ed Harris.  Although this song is extremely vulgar, it made me and my wife laugh hysterically, and actually served as an excellent recap of the film, about a fool who falls for a tramp who breaks his heart.  We consider this film a keeper, if only for this song!  I'm not particularly fond of country/western music, but this song is my all-time favorite of that genre.

Rene Zellwiger is dreadful, but besides that it was a damned good movie.  I lose patience with the casting of a Brit as the bad guy in the western but Jeremy Irons is so easy to hate it was alright.

They are far better than the film. The language and dialogue are better, and the books have a sense of humor lacking in the film. I recommend all of Parker's books. Nevertheless, the film is very good.
There are essentially three plots: (1) the relationship between Cole and his deputy, (2) Cole's strange relationship with a woman who sleeps with anyone in power, (3) Cole and his deputy's attempts to arrest and put to trial a man who killed a sheriff.",1453852800,,628,4.517543859649122

When they arrive in 'Appaloosa' they find the town has it's problems, the officials are so worried and scared by this they are willing to agree and sign the demands and rules the two gunmen lay down in return for their services.
Of coarse to have a problem there has to be a Villain in this case it's 'Randall Bragg' ( Jeremy Irons ) who has several gun-handy employee's in tow.
As tradition demands there has to be a damsel to complicate the plot, this is provided by 'Renee Zellweger' ( have seen her in better roles )

3686501,4,B001LM6VTU,"I enjoyed this slow moving western with a few outbursts of action in telling the tale.  But then I also enjoyed Robert B. Parkers novels of Spenser and the TV show Spenser For Hire.  Parker is good at buddy stories like Spenser and Hawk.  In this case it was Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) as a traveling marshal and sidekick.  I had read both Appaloosa and one of the sequels Resolution.  A lot of people don't realize that many sheriffs and marshals of the time were both lawman and villains as the situation fit at the time.  Some gunmen found that becoming lawmen kept them from being labeled killers.  That was what Cole and Hitch were.  Also this love affair romance between Cole and Allison French (Renee Zellweger) was strictly one sided.  Allison was one step from being a prostitute, which she became in later books after having run off with another man leaving Cole again.  This was not brought out in the movie so some people couldn't understand her behavior in the movie.  --The puffy face Renee was playing a untrustworthy woman.  The storyline is pretty basic two hired guns brought in to fight a evil rancher who has just killed the last sheriff and his deputies.  Light in action, with slow development it is not a bad flick.  Worth a watch.  Mortensen is entertaining.",1421020800,,1315,4.656521739130435

Ed Harris has given us a full-on representation of the characters and action that is thrilling from the beginning to the end. Perfectly cast with Harris as Virgil and Viggo Mortensen as Hitch with Rene Zellwegger as the power-attracted Allie. Robert B.

It's a thoughtful, sometimes funny, sometimes touching story of friendship, respect, and love played out within the genre of a typical Western plot: bad guy Randall Bragg (Irons) terrorizes a town, and the town hires two gunslingers, Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch (Harris and Mortensen), to be their marshals and put the bad guy in his place.  That place is the gallows, since Bragg has killed the previous marshal in cold blood, but people are in general terrified to testify against him, for he's a rich landowner with a very mean group of gunmen at his disposal.  We learn early on that Cole and Hitch have developed a reputation for being honest and very effective gunmen.  They are aware of that and take professional pride in the fact that they have worked out a way of doing what they are good at -- i. e. shooting people -- lawfully.

I'll avoid plot details in the interest of avoiding spoilers and concentrate more on what's unusual about the movie (although, to be fair, some of the plot elements are surprising too).  Cole and Hitch have been working together as lawmen-for-hire for a dozen years, and the largely unspoken trust and respect between them are unusual in a movie.  A good lot of humor is found in Cole's inarticulateness; many times he can't think of the appropriate word, and Hitch supplies it, without any comment or indication of discomfort with Cole's inarticulacy.  It's just one thing that Hitch does for Cole, just like watching out for him in gunfights and in relationships.  The relationship isn't like that of Butch and Sundance, nor are there the homo-erotic notes of ""Brokeback Mountain"": it just has a unique texture of its own and it has nothing to do with what Cole can or can't verbalize.  Likewise Cole's feelings for  Allie French (Zellweger) is something that he accepts without rationalizing and that he holds to even when Allie's insecurities seem to tempt her to take up with men who seem stronger or more powerful than Cole.  The most Cole will say about her is, ""I never met anyone like her.""  Hitch is protective of Cole in the relationship, but he doesn't try to destroy it, and he is nothing but considerate and even courtly to Allie.  The  texture of their interactions gives the movie much of its unique (especially for a Western) tone, and that texture is abetted by the quality of the writing, which is unusually fresh and free from the standard cliches of the genre.  The brief jailhouse discussion of Emerson is just one example of the peculiar tone of the movie.

Bragg isn't a conventional villain either, for all that he has some ugly followers at his disposal.  He can be ruthless, but he seems to develop an aspiration to be accepted as a pillar of society by the town he has terrorized, and there's the strong implication that his observations of and interactions with Cole and Hitch have had something to do with that aspiration -- which seems sincere.  In the meantime, the plot plays out with a kidnapping and shootouts, and there's a fair amount of suspense generated at times, but at the end it's the characters and their relationship and the unspoken bonds that one remembers from this unusual and engaging film.",1420070400,,3656,4.768253968253968

The only downside, which is minor, is the actual gunfire in the movie actually sounds like caps pistols. Apparently there was no overdubbing in the sound, and only this effect, or lack thereof  takes away from the realism of what otherwise would have been a perfect western . It's a minor thing, but, if your going to make a western with a lot of gunfire ,a Colt. 45 needs to sound like a .45,and not like a .22 blank. Same happens all the way through the movie with a Winchester rifle sounding like a .22 blank going off . Thankfully, the acting overshadows this apparent glitch,which is purely a director & sound engineer problem. Nothing wrong with the DVD.

3686559,5,B001LM6VTU,"In 2008's ""Appaloosa"" two itinerate lawmen -- Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) -- are hired to protect the New Mexican town of Appaloosa from Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), a newly-arrived rancher with money and a gang of thugs who arrogantly murdered three local lawmen. Virgil and Everett are seasoned professionals and have no fear. Meanwhile, a cute and seemingly refined widow comes to town, Allison French (Rene Zellweger), and Virgil falls hard for her, but is she worthy of his (or any man's) devotion?

Harris and Mortensen were born to play Westerners and Zellweger is exquisite as the insecure babe who always needs to be desired. Moreover, Irons makes for a first-rate Western villain.

""Appaloosa"" is a really good modern Western featuring the typical Western staples, but with great actors, mature themes and a totally realistic tone. When the action comes it's swift and brutal, but there's a lot of slow (albeit interesting) drama, so stay away if you have ADHD and require an explosion every five minutes to maintain your limited attention span.

The film runs 115 minutes and was shot in New Mexico.

3686772,3,B001LM6VTU,"I found this western watchable, but absolutely nothing more and couple of hours after seeing it I already couldn't remember some details... Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

In 1882 the town of Appaloosa, New Mexico, is ruled by a local cattle-baron named Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), who doesn't hesitate to kill those who oppose him. The people of the town hire then a wandering lawman (a ""town-tamer"") named Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his deputy, Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen), to end Bragg's reign of terror... It will not be easy, as Bragg has many cards to play, including but not limited to evil henchmen like Ring Shelton (Lance Henriksen). At one moment also a ""femme fatale"" (Rene Zellweger) will appear and try to drive a wedge between Cole and Hitch.

This is not a bad film, but it is somehow... banal. The scenario is not very good and dialogs are really lame, with a grand total of ONE good one-liner in a 115 minutes movie... Also shootouts are not very good - don't expect any brilliant action scenes. Soundtrack could as well be absent - nothing here that can be measured against some old western music...

The only reason why this film is even watchable is the cast which is indeed stellar: Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Jeremy Irons (who clearly had the time of his life playing a bad guy in a western!) and Lance Henriksen are always a pleasure to watch, in anything. As for Rene Zellweger, well, I didn't like her much in this film, mostly because I never was a fan of her, in fact quite the contrary - and also here her character is also unpleasant and annoying...

Some people suggested that this film is a kind of very distant remake of 1959 ""Warlock"" with Henry Fonda and Anthony Quinn, but I strongly disagree with that. Not even mentioning many other differences, the crucial point is that in ""Warlock"" it was clear that one of ""town-tamers"" (played by Anthony Quinn) was a closeted homosexual totally in love with his boss (played by Henry Fonda). No such thing is perceptible here.

Bottom line, this is a film slightly disappointing and rather banal, but still watchable, mostly for the performance of the four main male actors. It is just a pity that dialogs and action scenes are so LAME - with just a little more effort it could have been a really solid, good western. Recommended for renting rather than buying.",1400630400,,2374,4.683453237410072

If you are wondering what that has to do with this movie, it is because it is a tough guy detective novel and movie set in the old west.

3686804,5,B001LM6VTU,"I chose the five star rating for Appaloosa because the film appears flawless in almost every respect. Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen exemplify the strong, silent type of western heroes who live their code of life on a deep level. Their feelings run deep, and they do not use words to deceive but to express what they are willing to live and die for. They trust each other when tempted by a situation that would destroy most other friendships with jealousy. The film's violence is never gratuitous, but unavoidable when their code leaves them no other alternative. Bragg represents a threat to Everett's friend Cole, Everett risks his own life to mete out justice to the cold-blooded killer of their old friend. Bragg also threatens to destroy Cole's relationship with the woman he loves, besides corrupting the whole town of Appaloosa. Friendship prevails over ""taking the easy way out"" or shallow rationalization. This film glorifies strength of character, the bond of friendship, the conviction supported by ideals deeper than mere intellectualization. As I said, the film deserves to be a classic. We need men like this today. They are always in short supply and rarely appreciated.",1393545600,2,1184,5.045918367346939

All of the characters are multi-dimensional and complicated. It is essentially a western ""buddy film' in which dialogue often takes background to the actor's ability to convey complex emotions non-verbally. Western stoicism as visceral art.

Much the same occurs as Cole takes the lead in the gun work, with Hitch providing able backing for his lawman partner.  It is a classic depiction of lead and sidekick, with an odd romantic relationship between the awkward Cole and the conniving Allison French.

The cast is superb (with the exception of Renee Zellwegger; she's not terrible but I too feel she was miscast).  The direction by Harris is very solid.  The film transfer is very good and the sound is great.  I'd give this a solid four out of five for the technical aspects (ie sound and image) and five out of five for the actual film.

3686935,5,B001LM6VTU,"""Appaloosa"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: When two gunmen, Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch, arrive in Appaloosa they find a small, dusty and lawless town suffering at the hands of renegade rancher Randall Bragg. Bragg has not only taken supplies, horses, and women for his own, but also has left the city marshal and a deputy for dead. In Bragg they find an unusually wily adversary who raises the stakes by playing with emotions. It is now up to Cole and Hitch to stand against the actions of the renegade rancher, which have already taken their toll on the town.

The cast led by Oscar nominee Ed Harris (as Virgil Cole and who also directed, co-produced and co-wrote the screenplay), Oscar nominee Viggo Mortensen (as Everett Hitch), Oscar winner Renee Zellweger (as Allison French), & Oscar winner Jeremy Irons (as Randall Bragg) is excellent! The directing by Harris (who also produced and directed and starred in ""Pollock"" (2000) is excellent! The screenplay (based on Robert B. Parker's novel) by Harris & Robert Knott (who also co-produced and did second unit directing) is excellent!

The music by Jeff Beal (who also did the music to ""Pollock"", and certain television shows like ""Monk"", ""Rome"", ""Ugly Betty"", & ""Carnivale"") is excellent! The cinematography by Dean Semler (who also did the cinematography to ""Get Smart"" (2008) & won the Oscar for his cinematography work on ""Dances With Wolves"" (1990) is excellent! The film editing by Kathryn Himoff (who also did the film editing to ""Pollock"") is excellent! The casting by Nicole Abellera & Jeanne McCarthy (who also did the casting to ""Synecdoche, New York"" (2008), ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (2008), & ""Be Kind Rewind"" (2008) is excellent! The production design by Waldemar Kalinowski (who also did the production design to ""The Fast And The Furious"" (2001) is excellent! The art direction by Steve Arnold (who was an supervising art director on ""Spider-Man"" (2002) is excellent! The set decoration by Linda Lee Sutton (who also did the casting to ""Crash"" (2005) & the upcoming ""Crossing Over"" (2008 or 2009) is excellent! The costume design by David C. Robinson (who also did the costume design to ""Pollock"" & the upcoming ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" (2009) is excellent!

My main gripe: P*R*E*D*I*C*T*A*B*L*E!  From the first two minuted I knew what was going to happen before it happened.  I knew how the movie would end ten minutes in!  The script... arrgh, the script... I can't even call it a script.  It was a roll of toilet paper.  The acting... was on vacation.  I think Viggo and Ed can act; the jury has never returned on Zellweger.  Jeremy Irons must have been offered a trainload of gold bullion to climb aboard this carcass.  The leftover change was spent on the set and photography - those looked excellent.  But pretty pictures and realistic locations and the unrealized promise of good acting can't save this film.  I'm not hating on Westerns as a genre - it's just that this is really really bad, and I want anyone who has a single doubt to save their money for something that will actually deliver enjoyment.

Appaloosa is an excellent film on several levels though, and unlike most westerns, it ends well.  I hope that doesn't qualify as a spoiler, and I apologize if it does.  It's just that I'm usually afraid westerns (and other dramas) will end tragically, and I avoid them.  (I realize tragedies are carthartic, but can I help it if I want to feel uplifted at the end of a movie?)

I highly recommend Appaloosa.  It had a realistic, ""modern"" quality not found in most westerns.  A very cool movie I thoroughly enjoyed.

I would have given it five stars if not for the following:  I would have cast someone different than Renee Zellweger as Allie.  I've never understood the appeal of this actress.  She's annoying and unattractive.  I don't get it.

I would have also re-produced the audio.  I had to turn on subtitles so I could hear and understand most of the dialogue.

The lovely Renee Zellweger role as femme fatelle and Jeremy Iron's as wealthy badman along with some other supporting cast make this one of my top ten westerns which is a hard list to get into.  Mortensen and Harris are the hired companions whose trusted relationship with each other is palpable on screen.  Even if your genre favorite is more gangster like that of 'The Sopranos', 'The Godfather'...you won't go wrong with this western-style version but with Mortensen/Harris as your companion heroes thrown into it.  An extra dimension thrown into it too, with the love-struck Harris character trying to balance that with his harden part within himself.  Film distinctly narrated by Viggo Mortensen's character.  From beginning to end, a noir ballad.  I don't think it did that well at the box office as it was though recognized well by film critics.",1356652800,,951,5.025477707006369

I live in cattle country and yes, cowboys can actually speak normal English and have a brain. I kept looking for the Appaloosa, couldn't stay with the movie long enough to see one horse. When I saw Rene Zellweger was in it, that really killed it for me. Don't know how she even became an actress, always looks as if she has a mouth full of marbles and her face is always shiny like it's smeared with grease. Now she's going to show up in Brigette Jones 3-Looking for Love At The Rest Home?

He directs Appaloosa and also plays Virgil Cole, a good guy gunman who hires out with his partner, Everett (Viggo Mortensen) to clean the bad guys out of Western towns.  Jeremy Irons plays the bad guy in the town of Appaloosa.  The woman in the story is Renee Zellweger.  Harris makes good use of this fine cast to tell a story with subtlety and insight into the characters.  Virgil and Everett's friendship is marked by its honesty and trust and their ability to expertly handle the complications that arise in gunfights, negotiating with townspeople and Indians, releasing hostages, and such.  Their biggest challenge is dealing with the widow that Virgil falls for.  Zellweger's Allison French reveals the vulnerable situation of women in such a society.  What looks like superficial promiscuity on her part is actually a strong instinct for survival.  The gunfights are interesting and well done, but the best part is the slow-paced dialogue and meaningful glances.  A fine film.",1348704000,4,1081,4.955555555555556

Virgil and Everett are these two wild west versions of soldiers of fortune who seek out bad guys and enforce the law in out of control places, one of these being the town of Appaloosa.  There is this rancher named Bragg, played very convincingly by Jeremy Irons, who is an unlawful unabiding citizen, terrorizing everyone, refusing to pay for drinks and goods, and destroying anyone who stands in his way including the sheriff, deputies, even though one of his hired hands has committed a murder.  There is no stopping this guy until Virgil(Harris) and Everett(Mortenson) arrive in town and then the body count goes up as these two prove to the bad guys that they mean what they say:  We'll kill you if you don't obey the law!  A diversion also shows up in the name of Allison(Zellweger), a widowed woman with a questionable past, who becomes the main love interest of Virgil.  She is also a survivor and will do almost anything to stay alive which causes some consternation for Virgil.

like a real western and not some hollyweird gloss over studio

have and never will have. He uses just enough action and
violence needed but not over done with blood and gore but
very realistic. The surrounding cast is excellent and Zellweger

3687042,4,B001LM6VTU,"First of all, let me declare that this is a GREAT movie. It is a classic Western buddy film that harkens back to the gritty Westerns of the 70's where films were shot on location, actors were not afraid to look unflattering on camera, and authenticity ruled. Which is why I have one big problem with this movie. Why does every time a gun is fired in this film it sounds like when I used to play with cap guns as a kid? For a film made with such attention to period detail, this is the most unrealistic sounding gunplay I have ever seen on screen. No matter what the characters are shooting- whether it is Virgil's Colt revolver or Everett's 8 gauge shotgun- they all sound the exact same- like toy guns. How can this be overlooked in a Western, for pete's sake? Which brings me to the other point. Different guns have a very unique sound to them, and the difference between a shotgun blast and a revolver is tremendous. But not here. Which makes it confusing in a gunfight, too, because you cannot tell who is firing based on the sound of the gunshot. All the shots sound the same. This is so annoying in a movie that is so excellent. MY hope is that some day someone will take the time to go back and remaster the souund of this film and make the shooting sound as authentic and real as the movie itself.",1328227200,,1305,4.266129032258065

3687044,1,B001LM6VTU,"A 55-year-old gun-toting tough-guy Ed Harris? A plastic-surgery-faced 45-year old Renee Zellweger? Aging Hollywood actors ambling through a lame script? Aging bad guys too? Don't middle-aged men get wise (or get shot) and give up roaming from town to town as hired killers?

So what happened with this film? I suppose we get what we pay for. And seeing how I borrowed this DVD free from the public library, maybe I should not be so choosy? Perhaps a general problem is that with illegal downloads, $1 DVD rentals, and free films from libraries, that there is not sufficient capital to make quality movies. So, what happens is that aging film stars -- who have the money to make a film project -- spend their savings to keep themselves busy before a camera. They cast the film; they write the screenplay; they hire the cinematographers. And what's missing is somebody with authority to tell them ""no"" -- it does not make sense to have 55+ year old gunslingers. Consider that one screenwriting choice was to have a character consistently forget the second-through fourth vowels of rather sophisticated SAT-level words (and then have the sidekick complete the word!) When did these gunslingers get so literate? If they had gone to college, then why have they chosen to go out west? Luckily the audience was spared love scenes between Harris and Zellweger. Still, in the haste, the ""set"" looks Hollywood-ized, with phony store names, with one small stub tree growing, but with everything else so dry, how did that one tree get water? My guess: the tree was plastic.

Ed Harris remains a considerable talent but might find better use behind the camera, and cast youngins so the next film will not be loosa crappa.

3687062,3,B001LM6VTU,"The horrible miscasting of Renee Zellweger. Wholly unbelievable in her role as 'Yoko' to the two-man gun-toting horse-riding Beatles.

Otherwise, this was an excellent movie. The indomitable energy that Ed Harris carries, both as performer and director, was only bolstered by the granite that is Viggo Mortensen.

Kudos to both steely jawed actors - they were absolutely perfect in their respective roles. And notice how deep Mortensen got into his role: Check out the forehead tan line from wearing a hat. That's pure Method on display, and I'm very appreciative of it. Hardcore acting there brother.

An old school cowboy narrative - and for me, it's never gone out of style. Harris does a sturdy job of creating the nascent explosive undercurrent that I've only seen Eastwood do better in a modern western.

And props to Harris for hiring Lance Henriksen. It's not an understatement to say that he's been underutilized for years - forced to take paycheck jobs instead of performing for an audience who can appreciate his talents. I do wonder if Harris made friends with him during the shooting of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Right-Stuff/dp/B000092T6N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Right Stuff</a>'. Not all ensemble casts end up lifelong friends, but I like to think so.

This would've been an easy four-stars for me, but Zellweger's maddeningly oafish overacting is not something you can ignore. Her character is critical to the plot, and her plastic ingratiating performance detracts from the entire production. One has to wonder how Harris was conned into having her in the film, I suspect some serious arm-twisting. No way an actor's actor like him could've been that fooled by her ridiculously inflated resum&eacute;. The question is who put the pressure on for her hiring?",1305331200,9,1829,5.4035087719298245

3687065,4,B001LM6VTU,"There have already been enough synopsis' given concerning the movies plot, so I will focus more on the casting and authenticity from a historical perspective.

First and foremost, both Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen make an excellent pair and play off of one another very convincingly, Viggo is himself an excellent horseman, and from my eyes, really the main character in this film, although he is playing a supporting role. I see more of the movie from his eyes and dialogue than any other. Renee Zellweger was horribly cast in my opinion. It is not the character that I despise, but more her treatment of it. I think that there could have been a MUCH better choice to play the role of Allie French, as I believe Renee hurts the movie. Jeremy Irons is great in his first western role, and it a character that, while despicible, has a couple of funny moments.

Historically, (although I am not a professional historian) the film is pretty much spot on in everything from weapons, to dress, to decoration and the like for the time period. Not all westerns have paid as much attention to the most minute things that ""Appaloosa"" has. I dare say that MOST westerns have not. To the discerning eye, it is important. If one can believe the setting, the story tends to be more credible.

""Appaloosa"" is a winner for the most part. It is a sorry shame that Hollywood doesn't take more notice of the western genre these days, and if they looked at recent western movies (Open Range, 3:10 to Yuma, Unforgiven, etc.) they would note how well they tend to do at the box office, and gives a public bored with the simple rehashing of old classic movies remade a breath of fresh air.",1300752000,7,1668,4.5719063545150505
3687066,5,B001LM6VTU,"The story opens with the sheriff and two of his deputies from Appaloosa riding out to Randall Bragg's ranch to arrest one of Bragg's men.  The sheriff tells Bragg what he is there for and Bragg tells the sheriff he cannot afford to be short any of his men.  Bragg pulls up his rifle and shoots the sheriff and both deputies.  Bragg really has employer loyalty.

The town council now wants Appaloosa cleaned up so they call on two lawmen for hire: Virgil Cole, hot tempered Civil War vet who kills with ease, and Everett Hitch, West Point trained, smooth, educated, leader, always carrying an 8-gauge double-barreled shotgun.  Hitch knows how to use it and kills often, but legally. These men complement each other and keep each other alive.

Randall Bragg wants to take over the region's copper mines. His men terrorize the small town's residents, making their own rules and disrupting business, often with a lethal effect.  It's 1882 when Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch ride into Appaloosa to the near-empty streets. The deal they make with the town council is that they make the laws and enforce them their way.  So, Cole and Hitch are hired, and are given power to impose order, by whatever means necessary and they do.

The one problem is Allison French, a lady of questionable virtue that turns Virgil's head.  She also makes a play for Everett, but because of his friendship for Virgil he refutes her. The story plays out with Virgil's obsession to catch Bragg, a kidnapping, ransom, tracking, Indians, betrayal, a great gun fight and a killing for a friend.

This is a very realistic western; it has the feel of an old west town, not over dressed, not too many people.  Appaloosa is great in Blue-ray.",1300233600,,1707,4.71043771043771

The story trudged along like a marathon runner who was back in the pack and had little reason for celebration.

I have always respected Ed Harris' work, but I do not think that he allowed himself to be more than a one dimensional character.  Renee Zelweiger was miscast as the cheating valueless, woman who really gave no reason for Cole or anyone else to be so infatuated. She, also, has shown herself to be capable of much more. Viggo Mortenson did turn in a fine performance, but I do not think that it was good enough to rescue this the movie.

A one-note intonation.  And eerily enough, Ed Harris also seemed to have channeled his ""A History of Violence"" cardboard character as well.  Renee was pretty good.  She at least seemed animated and kept you from falling off your chair while you fell into a coma just trying to stay wake watching this western.  And for the life of me, I don't understand why they used that flat-chested woman who looked  like a boy as the saloon prostitute.  In the real old west, the prostitutes were very well endowed and much, much heavier.  Jeremy Irons as the villian was okay.

3687080,4,B001LM6VTU,"The premise seems simple, and one might think it stays that way, like a stilted sunset, throughout Appaloosa: a Marshall (Harris) and his Deputy (Mortensen) ride into town upon threats from a gang run by a crook who also happens to run the local hotel, Bragg (Irons), and it looks as though not only will Harris have a potential mess on his hands (capture, trial, plotted-escape, pardon thanks to President Chester A. Arthur), but may get the new girl in town (Zellwegger) who comes in as the local piano player. The only big complications in this set-up, aside from some fairly obvious twists and turns involving side-plots and searching and a minute with some local Indians, is that the Deputy may possibly have a crush on Zellwegger, or maybe it's just an honor thing. Either way, it becomes a subtly uncomfortable three-some.

Both Harris and Mortensen strike distinctive figures as part of a western landscape, and Harris knows this as director first. Without these two in the roles it could have been just some straight-to-TNT stuff, decent but nothing much to write home about unless a hardcore genre fan. Then again, mostly hardcore genre fans will really dig it, not so much those who think a Western is just 3:10 to Yuma and maybe, if they want to sound 'arty, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. But Harris, unlike even those two examples (and for the latter just as that's more ambitious if flawed), can't seem to strike a chord with the story to make it very much interesting past some quirks in the characters (i.e. Sheriff's running-gag in not knowing certain words) and a sorrowful last ten minutes. It is, more or less... dry. It should work better than it does, but a lot of it just rolls along, with its actors caught up in the 'simplicity' of it all.",1297814400,,1794,4.695238095238095

Deadwood, as well as The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, remain my personal favorites in this particular genre. I don't consider Appaloosa to be one of my favorites, but that doesn't automatically mean that the movie is a failure. It has some flaws, but it also has some very wonderful things about it. First off, I will say that Jeremy Irons seems a bit miscast as the main villain. He's a good actor, but he tries very hard to talk with a western accent. Instead, he ultimately sounds like an actor who's trying very hard to hide his British accent. Renee Zellweger is a bit more appropriate for her respective role, but she still looks a bit out of place in the movie.

But with that said, this is a very good traditional western. The sets, the music, the cinematography, all of it is very conservative when compared to Deadwood. The dialogue is a bit more modern, though there's hardly any profanity in the entire film. Several cliches are present, but they're well-executed with the strong dialogue (credit goes to Ed Harris and Robert Knott). Finally, both Harris and Mortensen give very nice performances as two lawmen who take complete control of the small town of Appaloosa. It's a very well-made Western, but if you're looking nonstop action instead of character development and interesting dialogue, then I think you should try 3:10 to Yuma instead of Appaloosa.

Grade: 7.9/10",1297296000,,1607,4.84
3687082,4,B001LM6VTU,"Opinions about Appaloosa are very mixed.  I watched it on DVD and enjoyed it.  Not the best Western ever but not bad and certainly better than a number of the comic books done over the past 20 years.  I would rate it as good to very good. It is clichd but that is part of being true to this genre. Best Westerns ever:  The Unforgiven, The Wild Bunch, Ride the High Country, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, and the 2010 version of True Grit.  The Shootist, Monte Walsh, Will Penny, The Cowboys, and Bad Company are also good.  The Long Riders and The Assassination of the Outlaw Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford are also worthwhile.
I cite the above to give the reader an idea of my taste in films.  I like Eastwood's spaghetti westerns but don't consider them great movies.  I think Once Upon a Time in the West should be seen by anyone interested in western movies.  Tombstone is wild but tiring. I purchased but don't particularly care for Open Range. Lonesome Dove is a masterpiece of film even if it was made for the small box.  Perhaps the best western movie of all time is Lonely are the Brave (also known as the Brave Cowboy) but it is a modern western like Hud.  Hombre is one of the best adaptations of an Elmore Leonard story and almost any of the movies based on Leonard's stories or novels is worth watching.
So in my opinion, Appaloosa is good but not great.",1293667200,,1368,4.346456692913386

3687086,5,B001LM6VTU,"Ed Harris does excellent work behind and in front of the camera in ""Appaloosa"", a film that is comfortably old-fashioned, but also deliberately not like most of the Westerns of the past.  As a viewer I was much obliged that Mr. Harris also does not make the film anything like most of the movies of today.

The story is decidedly nothing new: a pair of mercenary lawmen have been summoned to the frontier town of Appaloosa.  Harris plays Virgil Cole, who even villains know is both deadly with a gun and a man of his word.  Viggo Mortensen plays Virgil's partner of a dozen years, Everette Fitch, not as famous as Cole, but never without his 8-gauge shotgun.

Virgil and Everette are not men of words, and one of the strengths of this film is the ability of the actors to show you what these powerful men are feeling without resorting to vocabulary that neither possesses.  (One of the running jokes of the film is that Virgil WANTS to use ""big words"", but in almost every scene he comes to a sentence where he wants to use a word that he can't quite find.)

Appaloosa is being menaced by Rancher Randall Bragg, played by Jeremy Irons.  Mr. Bragg is the kind of man who employs a gang of roughnecks to threaten the town and enforce his will.  Bragg's men harass women, kill men, steal and plunder, then celebrate with too much whiskey down at the saloon.

Enter Virgil and Everette.

Complicating things are the mysterious Mrs. French, a fetching widow played by Renee Zellweger.  Mrs. French has a thing for alpha males, and when he's around, Virgil Cole is always top dog.

The movie has a few tricks and surprises up its sleeve, but it also stays squarely in the lines of the most classic of westerns.  I believe the Duke would have approved.",1278374400,11,1745,4.515923566878981

3687098,4,B001LM6VTU,"For years the movie going public has been fed one of its long term staples, the western, as a story of good versus evil, purity versus villainy, the stalwart angelic hero versus the dirty nasty bad guy. From Roy Rogers and Gene Autrey to James Stewart and Henry Fonda, the good guys remained pure for the most part. But that sort of short changed history.

Good guys were there to uphold the law but at the same times on occasion made the laws to suit their needs. And if they were to break the law, who was there to stop them? And so it goes that while this breed of hero was portrayed as pure in film, the reality was that they weren't quite as nice a good guy as we were led to believe.

That being said, they were good guys. They did protect people. They did uphold the laws brought about by people in towns across the West. And of course, they did kill people. So where does that leave the movies when it comes to depicting the old west and its heroes?

We've either been given the glossed over examples seen most recently in TOMBSTONE (great movie by the way) or we've been given the good guys who are really bad in films like THE WILD BUNCH. But now and then we get a gem of a film that portrays these men of the West for who they actually were, a combination of the two. APPALOOSA is such a film.

Produced by, directed by, screenplay by and starring Ed Harris, the film is a more realistic look at the old West than most have offered. The film opens with a Marshall going out to the ranch of Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) to arrest two of his men for a murder in town. Bragg refuses to release these men and as the Sheriff and his deputies attempt to arrest them, he shoots and kills them all.

With no where to turn, the folks of Appaloosa turn to Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his friend Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) to help them. Gunslingers, ex-soldiers and previous lawmen, Cole and Hitch do what they do better than anyone. They take on the responsibilities of the town by inflicting their own rules, all of which are of benefit to the townsfolk and not greeted warmly by lawbreakers. Cross the line and you take the chance of being taken down by them both.

As the town's new Marshall and deputy, they decide that the best way to take Bragg in for the killing of the Marshall (and Cole's old friend) is to take him by surprise, which they do. Of course Bragg's men attempt to stop him but back down when faced with no choice. Now it's up to a judge to convict Bragg.

While all of this is going on Allison French (Renee Zellwegger), a young widow, moves into town. Catching the eye of Cole, the pair becomes inseparable. At the same time, Miss French seems to have a roving eye for Hitch as well. But, being the friend he is, Hitch rebukes her advances and holds his tongue for the sake of his friend.

The judge arrives and a guilty sentence is passed. On the train ride to take Bragg to prison for execution, it's jumped by gunslingers Bragg has hired, both old acquaintances of Cole. With Allison as a hostage, they escape but not for long as Cole and Hitch track them down, only to find a surprise waiting for them (nope, no spoiler here for some of you).

The President of the United States, an old friend of Bragg, commutes his sentence and things in Appaloosa change. Loyalties alter, the desires of the town's city fathers changes and Cole and Hitch find themselves still enforcing the law but with a bit of a jaundiced eye. It's only a matter of time before a final showdown, a final confrontation and a fitting end to the twisted tales that revolve around one another come to a conclusion. And it's not what you might expect.

The movie plays well, offering a realistic glimpse of the old West. It doesn't sugar coat it but at the same time offers tribute to what it was as well. One need not go for the creased jeans of Roy Rogers but at the same time sink into the whiskey addled minds of the Wild Bunch. Instead we have a combination of the two and a more telling tale of those who dared to enforce the law by any means necessary.

Harris does a fantastic job, especially for wearing so many ten gallon hats while making this film. His character is a violent man who longs for more peaceful times. But this doesn't mean his anger won't flare on occasion. Mortensen has become a force to be reckoned with in his own right as an actor over the years. His portrayals of heroes from the Rings trilogy to this film offer more complex heroes than we've been offered in the past. And everything increases in value because of this. Irons does bad guys like no one else. You seriously want to be the one to take him down. The weakest of the leads here is Zellweger who for me just doesn't feel believable to me.

The film feels like a combination of the old and the new, the story of a good guy who might not be so good on the outside but whose heart helps in a lawless land. It tells the tale of a dedicated friendship that plays between the main characters. And it offers that glimpse of the West in action and location that makes you wish you had the chance to explore the hills and towns seen. Its perhaps one of the best westerns I've seen in ages and ranks among the best ever. For fans of the genre, this is one not to miss.",1271376000,2,5251,4.276938569989929

3687101,5,B001LM6VTU,"You probably know what Western films are like- cowboys get shot up like crazy, they fall off their horse (or off the bar stool) and die, you never actually see anyone come by and pick up the dead bodies, or bury them, and you never see any kind of emotion or concern for the people who got shot to death in dramatic fashion either (for the most part anyway).

Appaloosa includes ALL those things, in additon to that, it does a tremendous job keeping the storyline interesting.  It's about two cowboys who take over a small, dusty town (of course) and whether they were supposed to be playing the good or bad guys... I haven't a clue.  Everyone seems to be a bad guy in a Western anyway because of complete lack of emotion for human life.

Renee Zellweger shows us once again that she can portray *anyone* in a convincing way and make it believable.  Ed Harris steals the show with his character though- truly not someone you'd wanna mess with.

The only problem is that the ending tried to sum up the story, but it was a bit on the boring side if you ask me.  The shooting segments that appear throughout the film however, are quite good.  The scene in particular involving a train and Renee's character was probably the one that stood out the most to me.

Another Western perhaps, but this one might win you over.  I'm no expert when it comes to Westerns, so it's hard for me to tell which ones work for people, and which ones don't.",1265673600,2,1434,4.377358490566038
3687102,5,B001LM6VTU,"This 2008 Western has all the classic elements - good guys vs. bad guys, lots of gunfights, action, suspense and a beautiful woman.  But under the fine direction of Ed Harris, who also worked on the screenplay and stars in the film, it is not just formulaic.

The plot seems simple. Harris and Viggo Mortensen are two gunfighters who are hired by the town merchants to clean up the town and go after the bad guy played by Jeremy Irons.  Harris and Mortensen are more than just partners though;  they are true friends who have been together a long time.  And even though Harris is supposed to be the leader, it is obvious that he depends on Mortenson, especially when he gropes for words to express his thoughts and lets his friend finish his sentences for him.

All goes well.  Some bad guys are justly murdered.  But Jeremy Irons has still not been brought down.  We all know he's a cold blooded murderer because we've seen that in the first scene.  He's even in jail awaiting trial.  But we also know it's too early in the film for justice to be done yet.  Enter another character - Renee Zellweger.  She's a widow who has come to town looking for a man.  Harris is immediately smitten.  But there are certain aspects of Zellweger's character that show that all is not what it seems.

How it all plays out is full of surprises.  And there is more to the characterization of the main characters than meets the eye. The story moves quickly and kept my attention throughout as the plot twists and turns and sometimes made me just laugh out loud because of its outrageousness.

I really enjoyed this film.  And give it a high recommendation.",1265155200,3,1639,4.51360544217687
3687103,2,B001LM6VTU,"I expected a different film.  The story was drawn out.

Unfortunately, I could not get over the fact that the music reminded me of the television series, The Virginian.  Now, that was a western.

Appaloosa did have some good plot elements.

Anyway, the setting in the New Mexico Territory of 1882 was a nice touch.  In fact the whole concept of the story was good, except the concept was left on the floor as the screenplay flew out the window to the director's hands.

The cast was good, but they did not have much to work with here.  My question was where did the bad guys bury the bodies of the marshal and his deputies? What happened to their horses?  There was an eye witness-he had no clue what his fellow desperados did with the bodies and horses? Really!

And the girl who just happened to show up and take an interest in the main character-wasn't that too obvious except to the two lawmen?  These guys had been around the old corral with desperados and women.  They couldn't tell a ruse when it was in their faces, even though, it was a very lovely one?

The only believable part was the ending.  It was a great ending.  Wish the film had been great as well.

3687114,5,B001LM6VTU,"This fine western is more like the classics such as 'Shane' from the 40's and 50's, when the genre reached its artistic peak, than the ultra-violent post-Wild Bunch school. This is a refreshing and welcome change of pace. The progressive increase in violence, misogyny and sadism since the 1960's, although yielding some admitted classics such as 'Unforgiven,' is an ultimately an artistic dead end.

'Appaloosa' is a western that contains interesting and plausible characters, some of whom you will identify with, struggling with the human condition in various aspects, as the plot unfolds in an interesting manner. There are some good gun fights, there is horseback riding, there is wonderful scenery, excellent photography, and fine acting.

This movie is paced more like the classic westerns than today's action movies, where someone gets tortured, killed, or blowed up about every 2 minutes because the director thinks all the 14 year old ADHD boys in the theater will go to sleep if he does otherwise. In my opinion, this is a great improvement over the recent '3:10 to Yuma,' which was too oppressively hyperactive and stupid for someone over 30 to enjoy.

My wife, who is not nearly as keen on westerns as am I, enjoyed this movie almost as much as I did. As a fan of westerns, I give this movie an extra star because there are so few good westerns made anymore. A person not interested in westerns would probably give this a 4.

However, Westrn was part of my young-adulthood reading. Although I enjoyed several spaghetti westerns, this western clicked somewhere deep within. Throughout the movie Viggo Mortensen managed to be on the sideline, in terms of action and such. The finishing cleans up the confusion a bit. The vindication of camaraderie could be a theme. However, I doubt it's that straight-forward. It was ultimately a good story, that can make any romantic very nostalgic. A part of my psyche cherishes that rugged life of wild-west, the chivalry, comradeship and such. It also connects me with the past memory of my feelings, [memory of feelings? go figure]--about my imagination of America, even before I was planning to come here. Within me, I always believed and carried a wild west. The way the man and his packhorse rode to the west, merging with the setting sun--lonely, but free, only companion are the horse and the dust of his trail, well, my soul yearns for it. The movie brough a part of that back.
Ed Harris and Vigo Mortensen--both acted well, so did Rene Zellweger. By the way, Rene Zellweger acted in a smilirly vulnerable role in another movie where her Jewish husband's brother bed her --result of her sexual frustration and loneliness. The movie does not have too much talking--and dialogues were meaningful, instead of being ""filler-talks"", cinematography is commendable, and I liked the soundtrack--the beats and instrumentation go well with the modern time. I think Ed Harris's greatest credit in this movie is to be able to use sound and dialogue to create a universal theme of friedship, romance, agression. greed, politics and sacrifice--in one nice amalgum. It seems the set was a small one. The make-up and costume seem great--especially the toguh, hardened look on both mai characters' faces.

Widow Renne Zellweger is the recently arrived widow who takes to Harris who reluctantly accepts her flirting and infidelity. I'm not really a fan of Zellweger who tends to play somewhat odd character roles, but she does a worthy job here opposite Harris as a lonely, vulnerable woman desperate for a permanent relationship in the vicious, hard, cruel west. Appaloosa does not have as much gun action as 3:10 to Yuma, but it does have enough character study without the silliness that exists in many westerns, and that is one of it's strengths.

Viggo did well in his role, but I think both actors were hampered by the story which was a poorly recycled version of High Plains Drifter. Renee Zelweeger was also very annoying.

This movie is not 3:10 to Yuma (the remake w/ Bale and Crowe).  There's definitely less action.  However, the film plays like you're reading a dime novel.  Gritty characters.  You can almost taste the dust and feel the biting wind.  I'm not a big fan of Renee Zellweger.  But, personal bias aside she really puts on a good performance - as does Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, AND Jeremy Irons (how can you not love that combination?)

It may be slow to some, but like I said, it plays like you're reading a dime novel.

3687165,4,B001LM6VTU,"Generally well done adaptation of the Robert B. Parker western novel about roving lawmen-for-hire Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch.  The movie preserves one of the book's main themes: balancing the attempt to be lawful and legal in a setting that often demands that savage violence be met with more of the same to put down chaos.  Some may find the movie a little slow and methodical, but if you enjoy good dialogue and well-drawn characterizations, you should enjoy the film well enough.  And if you do indeed like it, you can read more about Cole and Hitch not only in the original novel ""Appaloosa"", but in its sequels ""Resolution"" and ""Brimstone"".

""Appaloosa"" looks and sounds very good on standard DVD and features a handful of interesting extra features, most of the ""behind the scenes of the film"" variety.  I was disappointed, however, that- aside from the producers saying that the movie came from a book- there is no specific mention of author Robert B. Parker, let alone an interview with him, in the various featurettes.

Much of the dialogue between Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen (playing two lawmen who specialise in taming rowdy towns) is rambling, nonsensical, almost incoherent.  The movie lacks pacing, and often goes into deep, yawn-inducing lulls.  There is absolutely no redeeming quality to Renee Zellweger's character at all; she's one of the most annoying presences in this film.  And Jeremy Irons is mysteriously empty playing the villain.  When I first saw APPALOOSA in the cinema, a handful of patrons got up and walked out, and that's never a good sign.

Yet there were several things I heartily enjoyed.  I liked the chemistry between Harris and Mortensen; they were very believable as longtime partners, and often their interaction sauntered over to subtle comedy (in a good way, mind you).  The film had the rugged and authentic look and feel of the Old West, and the action, while brutal, was never pretentious.  And much of cinematography, in a word, was spectacular.

So there's the rub.  APPALOOSA is at times very bad, and at other times very good.  And it's demonstrably disappointing it couldn't have been better.

3687197,4,B001LM6VTU,"I'm a big fan of Westerns and I had already read the book, so this was a no-brainer for me. I was further intrigued when I read that Ed Harris had fallen in love with the book while on vacation and had immediately purchased the rights. In my estimation, Ed Harris is one of the most underrated actors out there and I had high hopes for the movie when I learned of his involvement. I wasn't disappointed.

The story is familiar to most fans of the genre. Rancher Randall Bragg, played with cold charm by Jeremy Irons, believes he and his men are above the law. They take food and supplies from the town of Appaloosa and create a general atmosphere of terror. Enter Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch, travelling lawmen hired by the town to deal with Bragg and his henchman who have disposed of the town's previous sheriff. Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen are excellent in the roles of Cole and Hitch, capturing perfectly the complex friendship and loyalty between the two men. They institute a new set of laws and proceed to enforce them, much to the chagrin of Bragg, his men, and the town fathers alike.

Complicating matters is the arrival of a piano playing widow, Alison French, played by Renee Zellweger. She takes a fancy to Cole and the feeling is mutual. Alison has issues of her own, however, chiefly the need to be with whatever man she perceives to be the alpha male. This leads to problems later in the film.

The film deftly moves between Cole and Hitch's efforts to bring Bragg to justice and Cole's burgeoning relationship with Ally. The two plots come together in an unexpected fashion and lead directly to the resolution of the film.

The movie is dialog driven and moves slow in places, but it never seems ponderous. The relationship between Cole and Hitch drives the film. Their loyalty and deep bond for one another is something that Robert Parker has always been adept at creating and Harris wisely showcases these elements in his screenplay and direction. Harris's director's eye is impeccable, making use of classic western imagery. The attention to detail is impressive, as weapons, clothing, and setting appear authentic to the times. The violence in the movie comes in quick brutal spurts, very realistically portrayed.

I enjoyed the hell out of this movie, just as I had the novel. The characters act and talk the way you wish you could in real life. The casting was great and even Renee Zellweger held her own. (I was especially pleased to find that Lance Henriksen was cast as a hired gun employed by Bragg.) Ed Harris does a remarkable job as Cole, a cold man with few social graces, struggling with his feelings for Ally, driven to defeat Bragg and enforce his law. When he's violent it is without remorse. Mortensen is equally as good as Hitch, a more emotional man, who sees the darkness in Cole, but doesn't have it himself. As I said before, their dynamic makes the film work.

3687201,4,B001LM6VTU,"THE FILM: Good on Ed Harris. Not many people make westerns these days, they're just not seen as a commercially viable genre in Hollywood. But Ed Harris is a stubborn man it seems, much like his character in Appaloosa - a slow-burning western with some very fine performances that flesh out some pretty interesting characters. This has the look of a classic western, but it's also very mucha a charactcer piece. And while it won't satisfy the gun-toting western lovers who prefer a little more action and violence in their westerns, this is about the threat of violence from two men and what they're capable of, and that's enough.

THE DVD: Not the greatest transfer, which is unfortunate for a modern film - the reds are particulary violent and saturated.

SPECIAL FEATURES: The commentary track by Ed Harris and the Producer is very forgettable, with a lot of ""this is so and so, they did a great job etc"" which is unfortunate. Ed is obviously a shy, reclusive type who doesn't feel the need to explain everything for the audience. Unfortunately for us, that's the entire purpose of a director's commentary. Perhaps an interviewer to prompt Ed on different aspects of the film would have encouraged him to be more forthcoming about the production. Thankfully, there are some great featurettes (normally the fluff in a dvd but here they provide the meat for the behind-the-scenes effort), featuring sections on the cast, cinematography, authenticity and costume. great stuff.

Overall, the dvd is worth getting if your a fan of the western and are in the mood for a 'real' western, one where a man's reputation is often enough to stay the gun hand of any challenger.

3687240,4,B001LM6VTU,"Freelance law enforcers Virgil Cole, (Ed Harris), and Everett Hitch, (Viggio Mortensen), ride into the New Mexican town of Appaloosa one afternoon in 1882. Close-up shots reveal that neither man moves so much as a muscle on his face as each surveys the near-empty streets. And such stern faces they have!! Obviously, these two are not men to be messed with. Cole, a hardened Civil War vet, with a hair-trigger temper, has been hired by Appaloosa's local leaders to act as marshal until the area is rid of Randall Bragg, (Jeremy Irons), a wealthy rancher. New to the territory, Bragg wants to take over the region's copper mines. He and his sidekicks are a grungy band of murderous thugs. They terrorize the small town's residents, making their own rules and disrupting business as usual, often with a lethal effect. When Apaloosa's former sheriff and two deputies rode out to pay Bragg a ""visit,"" the villain shot and killed all three men. So, Cole and Hitch are hired, and are given power to impose order, by whatever means necessary.

Everett Hitch is the deputy with a capital ""D,"" and the film's narrator. A West Point-trained ex-cavalry officer, he has been working with Cole, traveling and cleaning up the frontier, for many years. I was really drawn to this character of many contrasts. Highly educated, articulate, introspective, and clearly a leader of men, he gave up soldiering because he was tired of fighting in the Indian Wars. Yet, Hitch makes his living through violence - shooting and killing within the limits of the law, except for once. Virgil Cole, on the other hand, is explosive, a self-taught man, who is almost the exact opposite of his partner. The two, however, share a great rapport and are completely at ease with one another. This relationship is what pulls the movie together and makes it work. Cole and Hitch are men of honor who have a deep and abiding respect for each other - friends as well as partners - sort of like Butch Cassidy and Sundance without the sense of humor! Actually, there are wryly comic moments, mostly banter, in between bursts of gunfire, and though not laugh-out-loud funny, these amusing moments do provide a break from the tension.

At this point, a lady enters the picture. Don't they always? Renee Zellweger plays Allison, (Allie), French, whose arrival coincides with the lawmen's by a day or so. Both are attracted to the lovely, refined widow, with only a dollar to her name, but Virgil wins the gal, ""supposedly."" He even gets her a job, playing piano at the local hotel. Allie is quite different from the ""whores and squaws"" both men usually associate with. There are few ""ladies"" in this part of the world. While Everett is tempted, he doesn't even make a play for Allie, seeing that his partner is smitten. Everett seems to place his partner's welfare before his own, without appearing overly altruistic. Allie's personality is disturbing and complex, but I will remain mum on the subject from here on - no spoilers.

The tension builds between Bragg and Cole, with Bragg trying to reach an accommodation while Cole remains implacable in his goal to bring the outlaw to justice. When a witness to the killings of the sheriff and deputies comes forward and agrees to testify, Bragg is finally arrested and brought to trial. The story and major conflicts really begin to pick-up pace at this point. Each character reveals more of his/her personality as the action gets rougher and tougher. I found the ending to be surprising and somewhat bittersweet.

The cinematography is outstanding!!!! Kudos to Australian photographer Dean Semler, who worked on ""Dances With Wolves"" and the TV mini-series ""Lonesome Dove."" There are some shots which are amazingly beautiful and worth the price of admission, or the cost of a rental, on their merit alone.

Ed Harris acts, directs, and produces ""Apploosa"" which is based on Robert B Parker's western novel of the same name. Harris also co-wrote the screenplay.

3687242,4,B001LM6VTU,"The version I saw gave you a choice between wide or full screen on the menu.

In a way, there were similarities that may have been borrowed from the Lonesome Dove pair, Gus and Captain Call.  Two taciturn men, of basic good character (mostly), teaming up to become lawmen after discovering a lot about each other to the point they knew they could count on it when chips were down; the uncontrollable rage that Virgil flew into when angered, being stopped by the other.

But is was a good story in its own right.  Virgil Cole, played by Ed Harris and Everett Hitch, portrayed by Viggo Mortensen, bounced well off of each others development of their characters.  The two ride into the town southwest town of Appaloosa on invitation to clean it up by the city fathers.  The contracts are brought out and hastily put asunder by the committee, as the two already have their own drawn up and very simple:  they do things their own way or they don't do them at all.  That includes no laws for the lawmen to follow as they sort out the details of the population,  and the balance of the laws for the public to follow are simple enough for even the toughest renegade to understand:  do it wrong and you're dead.  After they are there awhile, they discover that a varmint by the name of Randall Bragg, played slickly by Jeremy Irons, has killed another lawman they had known - and the plot thickens, stirred seductively by Renee Zellweger as she tries, but fails miserably in the attempt to set up a love triangle and drive a wedge between the two.  The resulting conversation that settles THAT situation once and for all is also good for a laugh.

All in all, the story was interesting and entertaining and I enjoyed the trip with them.  The stilted cautious conversation that sprung up between Virgil and the newcomer girl (Renee Zellweger) who kept making sure they understood she wasn't a whore started off the unusual meeting between the three of them in the hotel dining room, and exacerbated from there.

The scenery and photography amounts to one of the best parts of any movie for me, especially in a Western, and this film has a lot going for it in that department; splendid vistas.

There were some good lines, hinting that maybe the book was far better.

3687247,3,B001LM6VTU,"Actually, it is really 3 and one-half stars for a rating. . .

I was not aware of the movie until I picked up a recent copy of ""Guns of the Old West,"" a periodical put out by Harris Publications.  In it was an article about the guns used in ""Appaloosa.""  That got my interest going.

Comparing the movie to the book is a little difficult for me, even though most of the book was transferred into the movie.  I understand, as the director, co-producer, co-writer Ed Harris easily choose who he wanted for what parts and while I'm not complaining about most parts, I just didn't think Rene Zellwegger was right for the part, as it was written anyway.  The character needed to be fleshed out more (literally and figuratively) to better fit the Book to movie transformation.  Yes, I understand it was shot with a limited budget, but it was a weak point.  Some have stated why they couldn't understand her even being a part of it; well it's simple.  She throws the monkey wrench into the ""keep focused on the job at hand"" that Virgil and Everett had been doing for years.  Love can be like that!

The relationship between the lead male characters is a bit similar to Gus and Woodrow in Lonesome Dove, most notable when Everett is grabbing Virgil off the Teamster.

I bought the movie, in all honesty, because of the article in the gun magazine, and the interest in the 8-gauge.  Sometimes, it's better to have a movie in your ""personal library"" than to go off to the rental store, or library, and get it.",1238198400,,1499,4.446886446886447

I ended up turning it off about 30 minutes in. But after reading many positive reviews, and taking the advice of friends, I gave it another shot - and I'm glad I did. Whatever issues I had the first time around weren't even apparent on my second viewing. I'm still not the biggest fan of Renee Zellweger, but Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen more than make up for that. Essentially this is the story of a friendship, and the ""western"" is just the backdrop - it could just as easily be translated to medieval knights or modern cop movie. But with it's nicely understated acting, beautiful cinematography, and minimalist dialogue, it works really well. While this might not be quite up to par with some recent classic westerns ('3:10 to Yuma', 'Open Range', 'Proposition'), it's still quite enjoyable with some memorable moments.",1238198400,,956,4.696428571428571
3687259,5,B001LM6VTU,"The Robert P. Parker novel of the same name is a story of late 19th Century friendship. If you've read Kipling or any of several 19th Century novelists, you'll recognize the kind of relationship. It is far more intimate on one level than anything most men would feel comfortable with today and, at the same time, more distant and respectful of boundaries.

  Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch have been lawmen roving the west for a dozen years. If a town needs a sheriff or town marshall, they're for hire. Cole, in particular, is quick to resolve things with violence. Neither man is hesitant to be judge., jury and executioner when they think what they believe is the law has been violated.

  They come to the town of Appaloosa where Town Marshall Jack Bell has recently gone missing. The audience knows he has been murdered by local evil doer Randall Bragg. Aside from the obviousness of his evil, not much is ever know about Bragg except that he has 20 or more men working for him who apparently are willing to kill on command. Or or the fun of it.

  Obviously Cole and Everett, the newly minted Town Marshall and Deputy, will have to tke control of this situation - and through a mixture of very tough diplomacy and some shooting they do. One of Bragg's men offers to become a witness and Bragg is seized.

  Perking along in the background is the mysterious Mrs. Allison French who gets off alone from the train one day, pronounces herself a widow and immediately makes a move on Cole. Everett is disconcerted by this and even more so when Allison (Allie) makes a move on him.

  The tension between Cole, Everett and Allie doesn't come across as effectively in the movie as in the novel, but it is there.

  While Bragg awaits trial, two gunfighters come to town. Cole says they are perhaps as good as he is.

  At this point, anything else I say would be a spoiler.

  Suffice it to say, that the rest of the movie is a well done 19th Century ""buddy"" film, not at all like ""Butch Cassidy"", but more like the 1930s ""Beau Geste"" and others.

  Ed Harris, Viggo Mortenson and Jeremy Irons turn in fine performances. Renee Zellwegger is never quit believable. The story is slow, as is befitting, the setting. The relatively few action scenes are well done.

  Above all, this is a film about friendship - and it is well done. Those expecting endless gunplay and violence will be disappointed.

3687260,3,B001LM6VTU,"Ed Harris, Viggo Mortenson, and Jeremy Irons ... all struck me as ideal types to play Western characters, and each does a good job here.  The story is classic Western: Bragg, a ruthless and lawless gang leader terrorizes the town of Appaloosa, making it impossible for the locals to mine the local copper.  After Bragg brazenly kills the local sherrif, the town leaders decide to hire a couple of gunslingers and put them in charge of the law.  The only problem was a fickle woman, who threatened to come between them, but more importantly weakened the resolve of the more experienced of the two by giving him something to care about.

The elements are all there ... I just didn't feel this Western went anywhere further than telling a fairly engaging story.  The voiceover by Viggo Mortenson felt unnecessary to me, and merely established that his was the point of view from which the story would be told, but I never felt a strong sense of what made him tick, other than a sense of loyalty to his partner.  The story looks good, but it felt to me too much like a Hollywood film, the town too much like a set, the children too much like modern kids dressed up to look like kids from the olden days, Zellwegger's character felt too much like Rene Zellwegger playing a fickle lady from the past, whose tendency to happilly cling to whatever man happened to be in charge struck me as overly pronounced, and Harris's tendency to stumble on big words and ask his younger partner for clarification felt like it was just one of those ticks written into a character to give him ""salt"" rather than something that felt real and as if it flowed organically from his character.  In short, this is a passable Western, and like a lot of old Westerns it creates an imperfect illusion of frontier life that is good enough for a couple of hours but doesn't have a timeless feel and doesn't feel like something that needed to be made.

I understand that this is supposed to be a ""spaghetti western"". Even so, the weak plot lines associated with those series of westerns fail to justify the complete lack of a cohesive story in this movie. This may be the fault of the novel this film was adapted from, and if so, why couldn't they modify the screenplay like they do all the time? A majority of the blame I would direct towards Ed Harris, who both starred in and directed. Even the characters contradicted the persona's the film painstakingly develops. There was a general lack of suspense and even the action scenes were not exciting.

You see, in Appaloosa Ed Harris is doing his best Gus McCrae (Robert Duvall) and Viggo Mortensen is doing his best Woodrow Call (Tommy Lee Jones). While the chemistry is certainly there, the imitation is almost blatant. Not a bad thing I guess, but it took away a lot of the originality that Appaloosa had the potential for. Harris and Mortensen could have created a unique, memorable pair seen in ""buddy movies"" like the aforementioned Lonesome Dove or Lethal Weapon (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover); but instead the Harris Directed Appaloosa chose to imitate rather than create, and will result in my mind as a forgettable duo.

The story isn't anything new either. Basically (very basically) there are some bad guys in town and the townspeople can't deal with them themselves. So they bring in hired guns Harris and Mortensen to uphold the law. The bad guys take offense, and Harris and Mortensen go to work.

There's some fun action in Appaloosa, but the film is more of a buddy movie with buddy interactions than it is a rompin' stompin' Western.

3687289,5,B001LM6VTU,"""Appaloosa"" is a curious Western where the primary plot has to do with the value and significance of the friendship as posthumous homage to a sincere and incorruptible life of a straightforward man - Virgil Cole (Ed Harris), disposed to make the justice prevails no matter how many miles he must to walk to get it.

But through the achievement of his last goal he falls in love with an alluring widow and so after a set of unexpected events the villain of the story becomes a very respectable citizen. But his friend Everett (Viggo Mortensen), has never forgotten the main goal and he will be the executor arm of the natural justice.

The dramatic premise has to do with the thin line between the duty, the moral codes and the ethic. That's why Cole reads Emerson and even discusses with Bragg (Jeremy Irons) ethic issues in a very brief but relevant sequence. Both men are well aware about the holes and fissures of a legal system (including a Presidential blessing who liberates this double moral citizen named Bragg) and every one of them will try to make his mission in the stage of life.

Everett is -if you may- the outlaw personage (no family; no hopes for the recent future) who scrutinizes, watches and nourishes day after day his hidden admiration by Cole. That's why Cole tells him. ""The feelings may destroy you and distort your whole perception about the life's role. That's why Everett is not at the same level than Cole.""

Ed Harris(after his debut as director with ""Pollock"")demonstrates outstanding merits at the role of director. A very zealous camera handle with wonderful nocturnal illumination and arresting angles (like the gun duel, the dramatic sequence of the train).

Once more, we are conscious about the Western transcendence simply denies to die because neither more nor less, this is the mythic genre per excellence that wrought the untamed spirit of a nation after the horror of the Civil War.

It was so good, I went ahead and bought it and it's sequel, RESOLUTION.  Then the movie came out starring two of my favorite actors, Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen. Couldn't wait to see it, even though I knew the book would color my perception of the film's characters.

I didn't care at all for Harris' portrayal of Virgil Cole, who became almost giddy upon meeting Mrs. French (played impecably by Renee Zellweger). For all his rules and regulations, Virgil is a stone killer and judging from reading the two books, Cole simply doesn't ever get freakin' giddy.  His slavish devotion to a woman who proves repeatedly to be unfaithful is odd, but that at least is consistant with the book. Harris' reactions at certain times were off the mark if one goes strictly by the character created by Mr. Parker.

Mortensen did an understated side-kick role, but did so ably. Zellweger completely surprised me with her total immersion into the Ali French character and did so beautifully. She was perfect in the role. I don't believe anyone could have done it better.

I've enjoyed Mr. Parker's books for years and probably will continue to do so years. His Jesse Stones series were successfully transferred to film starring Tom Selleck and seems to be doing well. For some reason, though, the dialogue in APPALOOSA did not transfer quite so well to the big screen.  The characters, with the exception of Mrs. French, never really developed beyond two dimensional. Even the inclusion of veteran actor Lance Hendriksen as gunman Ring Sheldon did nothing to help.

McCabe & Mrs. Miller, High Noon, Unforgiven and Once Upon a Time in the West are a few which come to mind just now. 'Interesting' as in many-faceted, multi-leveled, complex, conflicting and challenging.

Most westerns go for all-out action, supported with maybe some character development. Dandy; that's what most audiences want. In APPALOOSA, character is key; the people, their motivations, natures, complexities and cut-to-the-bone human nature drive all the action. The fast, realistic action makes the points in this fine motion picture so memorable, so impressive.

APPALOOSA's not a psychological thriller, nuanced and sophisticated. It's about simple people living in a time of absolutes and place without precedents. Do or die, black/white, live or die. No spin, no hype, no equivocation. No how-to manual. As such, it comes across as a pretty-sophisticated motion picture.

I collect movies. In the western genre, this fine film is a stand-out, a stand-alone. It is, thankfully, very well done. Understatement everywhere, awkwardness, figgering thangs out and doing what needs be done, direct and fast or else. I look forward to seeing it again. It sure proves Mies van der Rohe's famous line (referring to architecture) ""Less is More.""

By nature, a western-themed movie is supposed to be slow.  The late 1800s were riddled with difficulties which made one's movements and actions deliberate, calculated.  It's up to Cole and Hitch, a former soldier, to ensure this purposefully structured way of life remains in tact.  As such, they live the nomadic life similar to Wyatt Earp, riding from one dusty town to another, ridding the townsfolk of lawless vermin who smell like goat taint.  In Appaloosa - a virtual Tombstone and OK Corral - the two lawmen face their most difficult reformation task in renegade rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons).

Shortly after their arrival into Appaloosa, they establish blunt order.  Disobey?  Go to jail, do not pass Go.  Resist?  Get a new ear hole in the middle of your face.  Previously, Bragg ruled the town like Brad Wesley from Road House (but without the naked pool parties).  His control so supreme, he barely hesitated before killing the previous marshal and his deputies.  With the new law in town, however, Bragg's men - especially a guy whose front teeth meet the butt end of Cole's pistol - are forced to abide by the law.  In walks Ally (Renee Zellwegger) to muddy the waters.

Ally's arrival is the classic western folly.  Cole immediately falls for her prostitutorial ways because she is flirty yet cultured, and because she bathes often and chews her food nicely.  This, of course, leads to one of the following possibilities: A) She is used by bad guys against Cole's sensitivities, B) She turns out to be an actual whore, and wrecks Cole's psyche, or C) All of the above.  As directed by Ed Harris, it ends up being option C, with an extra caveat: D) Ally ends up being a turd in the punchbowl, whoring around town, and undoubtedly contracting the first STD of the Wild West.

Simply put, Zellwegger's presence ruined this movie.  With Harris, Mortenson, and Irons, alongside Lance Henriksen, the strength of this cast is its grimy realism.  Each character looks like they've been in the sun too long with borderline unhygienic tendencies.  They look like they can drink throat-burning whiskey while firing a six-shooter through a needle's eye.  Zellwegger, however, looked as confused as a dog in a bathtub.  The fact that her character is a completely, unredeemable slut doesn't help either.  It's funny that early in the movie Cole says he's only been with squaws and hookers, and Ally's different.  Oops!  Guess her appa is a bit loosa afterall.

Appaloosa is a well-acted, compelling Western tale.  The final battle is well done in the genre's motif; there may have even been a tumbleweed or two.  It's just that I hated Zellwegger and her character is all.",1234310400,3,2791,4.861995753715499

The story is very simple and nothing about it is unique or very interesting. I am not a fan of Renee Zellweger and her performance in this movie reminded me why. The movie switches back and forth between action and romance. The action isn't bad but the characters often do things that make no sense at all. And the romance is very unbelievable and just seems like an excuse to move the plot along. I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't find any reason to.,1233619200,10,643,4.322314049586777

3687362,3,B001LM6VTU,"Although as a Western, Appaloosa has its fair share of the usual barren landscapes, quick-on-the-draw shootings and loners traveling about the countryside exacting their own brand of harsh justice, this directorial offering by Ed Harris is really a slyly funny sex comedy with all the trappings of saucy French burlesque.

 . . . French, that is as in Mrs. Allie French, the Rene Zellweger character who wreaks havoc on the minds of two meandering lawmen--friends Virgil Cole, played by Ed Harris with a somber albeit tongue-in-cheek roguishness and the loyal Everett Hitch, dramatized by Viggo Mortensen with a quiet perfection that endows his character with as much patience for his partner than one could ever wish for in a long-term spouse.

Hired by the Appaloosa locals to contend with the alarmingly bullying Jeremy Irons, Cole and Hitch speedily incorporate their tried and true penal code that wins the West for them until Allie comes along as the attractively guileless fly in the ointment.

Comedic moments abound as the hardened and murderous Cole befuddled by French's attentions turns humorously domesticated--escorting his lady love on a buggy ride that drops the jaws of his colleagues and choosing curtain material for a house he builds for her at the end of the Main Street in town.

Unfortunately, this paragon of womanly virtue is about as unseemly as the rest of the stereotypical ladies typically seen populating the saloon in most Westerns.  Harris's Allie can't figure out which man she wants.  When she tries her hand at the unassuming Everett, she creates an interesting triangle of companions that although seems to reach a comfortable level of comradeship, sizzles with the same undercurrent of wry amusement shared by the two gunslingers and their increasingly enlightened audience.

Harris and Mortensen dance through their roles with the perfect timing of two pros that enjoy what they are doing and obviously liked what their chemistry together did for the film.  Although possessed by intermittent volatility, Harris plays Cole in an almost offhanded way--he wields a mean gun with the accuracy of a heat-seeking missile yet flounders when he fails to call to mind the correct word to finish his often hesitant sentences.  Mortensen, on the other hand, provides the perfect foil.  With his good looks hidden for the most part by a huge hat and hideous facial hair, he says little, but witnesses much as registered by the twist of his lips and the twinkle in his eyes. He's a leather-booted guardian angel that the other members of the cast perhaps can outshoot but can never fool.

Bottom line?  Appaloosa as directed by Ed Harris cattle prods the usual Western into a slick little sex comedy that Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen and Rene Zellweger clearly enjoyed making.  The story at times is a little slow, but the chemistry between the actors, especially Mortensen and Harris, make the viewing well worth the price of admission.  While the typical Western always features a 19th or early 20th century knight errant wandering the countryside in search of either freedom from civilization or some quest (noble or otherwise), Appaloosa informs its audience that the motivation for its women wasn't all that much different.  Recommended.

*Video/sound quality are quite good.  The picture is a little subdued, but still very clear, colorful, and detailed.
*Includes a commentary, additional scenes, and four featurettes.  And it includes a digital copy.
*There are a few gunfights, but they are very brief.  For the most part, this is an intriguing drama.
*Production design is excellent.  Exterior locations are interesting.  Interior locations are detailed and colorful.  Costumes and props are good.  I think much of it is also fairly realistic; the sets look authentic, and there are some parts where people appear to be doing tradescraft in a realistic manner.
*Photography is good.
*Despite the length of the film, it maintains pacing very well.  All of the scenes are not too long and to-the-point.
*Characters are good; they are well-developed and compassionate without being to extreme.  Acting and writing are excellent.
*There isn't much expository dialogue to describe the story's actions (the dialogue seems more character-driven), but if you pay attention, the storyline is good.
*Music is good.

The Bad Things
*Despite the pacing and occasional violence, the movie is still mostly a long drama.  It requires some tolerance; if you're looking for pure action or violence, this may bore you.
*Not for kids; rated R for violence and quite a bit of swearing (and one scene where some unruly characters were urinating on the floor).

It took me a couple of viewings to truly appreciate Ed Harris' directorial debut.  But now I can say that I got it, and it is a very interesting story with some very interesting characters.

3687364,4,B001LM6VTU,"Appaloosa as directed by Ed Harris, is a western that will appeal to most fans of the genre regardless of one's preference for the traditional vein in the mode of John Wayne or the modern interpretations like 3:10 to Yuma.

Virgil Cole (Harris) and his long-time associate Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) are essentially `cleaners' of a bygone era. Appaloosa is just another dusty town in need of their particular brand of expertise, establishment of a codified rule of law - as defined by the no nonsense Cole - and eradication of the human blight that has plagued the area for the last few years, Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) and his despicable crew of trail vermin. While it does not take long to ascertain there will be confrontations on the horizon, the arrival in town of a young attractive widow, Allison French (played by Rene Zellweger) immediately foreshadows complications that may irretrievably alter the dynamic between the complementary partners, Cole and Hitch.

There's plenty enough action and violence for the bloodthirsty viewer and well as refined cynicism for those who appreciate the contemplative portrayal of the new age intellectual cowboy (Mortensen's understated performance is a gem, somewhat reminiscent of Val Kilmer as  Doc Holliday in Tombstone, absent the addictiveness) but to the credit of Harris' direction and the screenplay adaptation of Robert B. Parker's novel, the film never seems to meander into the fantastical, where quite often the protagonists are seemingly invincible and infallible.",1233360000,4,1531,5.292181069958848

Harris' direction is superb; the period details are spot-on and the script is lean and Parkeresque.  It is a story of friendship, of friendship between men.  As such, more is left unsaid than is said.  The fact that things need not be said is the whole point.  Everyone will think of Spenser and Hawk and that is fair, but I think as well of the laconic Jesse Stone, another Parker creation which has resulted in excellent film adaptations.  Remember always that Parker is an English Ph. D., one who understands genre at the deepest level.  Thus, this is a western in the purest sense.  The story is relatively familiar (as western stories always are) and the experience of watching it is one that borders on ritual and sacrament.  We know that we are entering a certain ethos and we know what will happen there.  We pray that we won't be disappointed.  Here, we are not disappointed.  It is not as operatic as the Sergio Leone films can be, but it is respectful, almost worshipful, of the world which the genre celebrates.  This is first-rate work, an exquisite film.",1233273600,10,1158,4.536231884057971

The way he walks carrying the big rifle, the high boots, the hat, even his pointing beard, all of that resembles the XVII century Spanish ""Arcabucero"" - arquebusier, sort of musketeer - character he develops in that movie.

3687396,3,B001LM6VTU,"Appaloosa is a 'modern era' Western, careful to avoid the pitfalls of cliche by offering well developed characters and avoiding predictable plot lines and devices. It mostly succeeds in the originality department, but sadly is derailed by a wandering plot line and unnecessary length.

The strongest part of the film (and the reason to rent or buy it) is the interplay between the two protagonists Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen). In an interesting twist on the gun-hand for hire genre of westerns, they are instead lawmen for hire, taken on by the town of Appaloosa to avenge the killing of their town marshal. Ed Harris is very believable as Cole, an iron-hard gunman who reads Emerson, struggles with his vocabulary, and values his friendship with his longtime partner Everett above all else. In a refreshingly welcome divergence from the 'girl breaks up the friendship' storyline, Cole accepts his friends word on an important matter with calm sincerity. Mortensen provides a generally excellent performance, but his voice overs at the beginning and end of the film feel flat.

The gunfights in the film are short, violent, and historically accurate. Particularly the cross-draw stance of Hitch, who turns his body to the side to give the smallest target possible. There is a believability to them that rivals OPEN RANGE's gun battles.

The real problem with the film is its dramatic pacing. Overlong and even plodding, the story builds to several mini climaxes all of which have conclusions that lack pop. There is no real ultimate climax, and the ending of the film is perplexing in its intended message. The film would have benefited from losing 20-30 minutes of length and several of the unnecessary middle scenes that didn't add much to the story.

Art direction in the film is fairly good, and includes welcome details like the lighter skin tone of the portion of Morensen's forehead protected by his hat, the length and weight of the impressive 8-gauge shotgun he carries, and his period accurate haircuts. Less well detailed are the western landscapes which include the obligatory horses crossing rivers, steam train, and sun sets, none of which really feel exceptional, and in the DVD release, simply don't look good from a film quality standpoint. The colors are muted, and the western landscape is never given much scale, except in a handful of shots.

The DVD release is disappointing. The Dolby Digital soundtrack is also very poor with the voices from the center channel sounding muffled. Either they didn't use ADR (Automatic Dialogue Replacement) technology or the the sound was recorded at a low quality bit rate, leaving everything sounding flat on higher quality speakers. Only in a few scenes is 5.1 sound really used to dramatic effect. Also, the transfer looks muted and does not upscale well at all to 1080p. Colors are very bland and drab looking, and the darker scenes show a significant amount of lost detail. I would really like to get the Blue Ray for comparison to see if the picture quality problem was with the DVD transfer or the original film stock.

Overall Appaloosa is not an excellent film, but the characters and acting make it very watchable. Not as well made as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Range/dp/B0000TANUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Range</a>&nbsp;nor an eye-candy extravaganza like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-10-to-Yuma/dp/B000XR9L50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3:10 to Yuma</a>, it is still well worth watching, and worth buying if you're a particular fan of westerns.

Look for Open Range or 3:10 to Yuma if you want a great recent western to watch, this one is stern and bleak and harsh.  They paid great attention to period detail, almost to the detriment of the story.  period detail should be pervasive and unobtrusive.  It is very self conscious about being a western.  Very sparse story, and not extremely interesting, what little does happen.  I liked Appaloosa, but I didn't love it. It would be kind of like you could have set up a security camera for two hours in a town in the Old West for two hours and watched that.  Fascinating, but ultimately pointless. Great character study, not the greatest story.  Probably reads better (the book is by Robert Parker) There is almost no reason for Jeremy Irons to be in this.

3687418,4,B001LM6VTU,"Ed Harris directed ""Appaloosa"" and stars as hired gun, Virgil Cole.  Virgil and his partner, Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen), are hired by the small southwestern town of Appaloosa to replace the prior Sheriff.  The town has been terrorized by Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), a nearby successful rancher.  Two of Bragg's ranch hands shot a man, and the sheriff tried to arrest them but was shot by Bragg.  Virgil and Everett try to bring Bragg to justice while also dealing with an attractive young widow (Renee Zellweger), who begins a relationship with the taciturn Virgil.

The basic premise of ""Appaloosa"" (a hired gun defends a helpless town) is time-worn in the Western genre, and it's certainly been done better.  However, the success of ""Appaloosa"" relies little on the plot and much more on its main strength - the characterizations.  In particular, the relationship between Virgil and Everett is fascinating.  The two men joke back and forth but clearly trust each other implicitly, given that they have to rely on each other for their lives in their line of work.  Renee Zellweger's dependent character is also finely detailed.  Ed Harris co-wrote the solid script with Robert Knott, based on the 2005 novel by Robert B. Parker.  Finally, the cinematography, art direction, and music are excellent, adding up to a believable western.

Enter a small town called, Appaloosa.  Rancher, Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) has just offed the Marshall and his two Deputies.  His rowdy band of cowhands pretty much run things, much to the chagrin of the local town folk---a fairly common western theme, to be sure.

Predictably, new law comes to town, with Marshall Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his Deputy, Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen). They are quick on the draw and ready to bring peace to Appaloosa, as well as a campaign to rid the town of the lawless Bragg. We begin the, 'don't bring your guns to town,' dialogue.

Of course, we have to have a femme fatale, so we are introduced to Rene Zellweger's character Ali, who must exude plenty of pheromones, because all appear to be attracted to her flighty, self serving character.  Too much of the story begins to revolve around her. Since she is so integral to the plot, it would have helped to have a little more back-story on her. One was left to wonder why she ever wound up in a small town like Appaloosa, in the first place, when she was clearly a gal on a mission.

Mortensen has the best performance, as the Deputy. There was good chemistry between he and Harris and their loyal friendship came to life.  However, there was scanty dialogue between them, with long pauses of, I suppose deep introspection. And, since the DVD transfer of this movie was so poor (audio and visual), it was hard to even hear those few words, since we had the addition of the old, cowboy mumbles. Even the gunshots sounded like cap pistols, with Zellweger's heels making almost as much noise walking the hardwood floors---and we had our surround system full-throttle.

This western just wasn't gritty enough, or realistic enough for me and character development was lacking, resulting in a disconnect regarding their fates (except for Viggo...I always worry about him :-). Then with the DVD quality so poor, I couldn't even enjoy the best it had to offer.  Perhaps there will be an improvement with the Blu Ray version? Don't know, but I think I'd wait for it.

3687448,3,B001LM6VTU,"Being a fan of Harris, Mortensen and Irons, I looked forward to this film.  I found all of them up to their usual high standards but the movie overall to be rather underdeveloped and downright odd in the part concerning Allie, the somewhat upscale lady of loose morals who appears in town, strikes up a coy conversation with the two lawmen (Virgil and Everett) and ends up the next morning announcing that she and Virgil are buying a house together at the end of the street.  At this point I began to wonder about Virgil--his persona up to then as a no-nonsense, slow-talking gunman did not seem in tune with his almost instantaneous befuddlement with Zellweger's character, particularly since they contrived to make her look downright unattractive with a squinty, rather red face and a crimped-up head of red hair.  Moreover, while I suppose the role played an essential part in testing the 12-year old relationship of the two leads, I found the way it was introduced and thereafter constantly intruded to be very irritating and distracting.  Lonesome Dove managed to convey a friendship between two hard men without letting their various feminine associations send it off the rails.  However, the friendship here is still the heart of the story and the two actors are good enough to keep it from going under.  The basic story of the small New Mexico town terrorized (or at least seriously irked) by the wicked rancher and his gang is standard western fare but it is given a more modern and shorthand treatment which is interesting if somewhat superficial.  Overall,an enjoyable movie for the most part but certainly not a great one.",1232323200,,1634,4.856115107913669
3687449,4,B001LM6VTU,"I have to say, I have always been a fan of westerns. Honestly, the past few years have been mostly a hit or a miss; some are good, while others always come way short of instant western classics such as ""Unforgiven"" and ""Tombstone"". With the recent releases such as ""3:10 To Yuma"" and ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" in the U.S., even Asian filmmakers have gotten into the western bandwagon with ""Sukiyaki Western Django"" from Japan and "" The Good, the Bad and the Weird"" from Korea--seems like westerns are making a comeback. ""APPALOOSA"" is the most recent western entry based on a novel by Robert B. Parker and directed by Ed Harris who also plays the lead role along with a very stellar cast. Such a film demands attention, and ""Appaloosa"" doesn't disappoint.

1882 in the U.S. Mexican territory, two hard cases named Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) have been summoned to Appaloosa because they get the job done and they are the best at what they do--they keep the peace even if it meant creating laws to do it. After the supposed disappearance of the previous town marshal and his two deputies, Cole and Hitch have been hired by desperate town leaders who sign over the town in a matter of minutes. The culprit is a wealthy rancher named Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), who has his band of enforcers and who has been stirring up trouble in the small town. Cole and Hitch are set on a collision course with Bragg's band of hired guns, and to make things much more complicated for Cole, the arrival of Allison French (Renee Zellweger) and this enigmatic woman may be destined to change their lives forever.

The film does have the usual elements of gunplay, friendship and camaraderie, but it also gives a quick look at sacrifice and the means to survive during these dangerous times. Thankfully, this is no sappy love triangle with Hitch, Cole and Allison, otherwise, I wouldn't waste my time. The film does serve up an effective study of the film's situation and harsh times. While much of it is expressed around Cole and Allison's relationship (or lack there of), the relationship between Hitch and Cole is also explored. The time of their partnership is unspecified, but it is a very long time, their partnership had become friendship. Randall Bragg may represent the ultimate opportunist and represents the unfairness of politics while the brothers Ring and Mackie Shelton (Lance Henriksen and Adam Nelson respectively) is the exact opposite of Hitch and Cole. All in all, these folks are doing what they can to survive.

The film's pace is a little slow-moving and for a film with a 115 minute run time, it does feel longer. The direction does have a curiously episodic feel and seemed divided into 3 acts. But this is not a negative comment, since Harris' direction does manage to keep the screenplay interesting and the proceedings did flow nicely. The cinematography is quite impressive as the viewer is given quite a view of its western backdrop (shot mostly in New Mexico) and the costumes look pretty nifty and accurate. ""Appaloosa"" does feel like a contemporary western, that reveres its genre.

While the film does carry the usual cowboy trappings, the characters are quite compelling. I think the lack of a solid background for its lead characters proved to be an advantage since it maintains some hints of an enigma and the viewer gets to know each one as the film goes along. Harris does manage to flesh them out in a methodical way to favor certain habits, peculiar to each character, that strengthens their actions and reactions, which promotes emotion and serves up characters that breath and their body language says a lot about them. There are also some nicely placed touches of humor with Cole's interactions, whenever he finds himself grasping for the right word.

While the film does have its share of gunfights, which are shot realistically, there aren`t a lot of them. But to its credit, they are nicely executed and kept me guessing as to who would survive that encounter. The film also manages to be a little unpredictable and the closing act does reinforce all the characteristics we've been privy to. It's a good credible pay off and it kept me on my toes, despite its somewhat slow-moving pace.

The performances of its cast is real good and matches Harris` great direction. There is strong chemistry between Mortensen and Harris and they seem to be in familiar territory, they did have some practice working together in the film ""A History of Violence"" and the two has all the dynamics needed to pull it off. Renee Zellweger is an excellent actress although I have to admit this is not her best role to display her talents, but she does make the most out of what she's got on her plate. Irons is the bad guy and well...he's very bad. Our ""heroes"" wouldn't be much if weren't for a good villain. The actors are indeed the right people for the right job.

The film's greatest strength is its simplicity and its respect for the western tradition is refreshingly cool. If you're expecting a ""shoot-them-up"" western then you're more than likely may become disappointed. However, it's slow-moving, but never dull screenplay does pay off and I think ""Appaloosa"" is a fine addition to the list of western films which stayed true to its traditions and style. Its simplicity is embodied in a tone that is very familiar to fans, realistic doses of violence with a warm, thought-provoking statement.

Highly Recommended! [4 Stars]

The Dvd does sport a great picture and sound quality. The picture is clean although there are some noise in some scenes especially in the dark scenes. The colors are a little muted but they look natural. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is fitting for this type of film.",1232236800,,5748,4.780463242698892
3687450,1,B001LM6VTU,Appaloosa is by far the worst western movie I have ever seen. The movie made absolutely no sense at all!! Wait for the price to get down to about 4-5 dollars before buying this one!,1232150400,5,181,4.2
3687451,4,B001LM6VTU,"Once, which seems like ages ago now the Western was the most popular genre in film; it seemed like every major release was a Western and like most genres there might come a time to where the genre film might have weak sales, but than bounce back. The Western though has never really made a comeback. The Western seems like something of the ghost of Hollywood past. Every so often a Western will be made and some have been decent sized hits it seems most break even or flop. There just isn't a market for these movies anymore and nowadays it's the modern day Western being made; the modern day Western takes the elements of a Western, but obviously set in modern day.

Every couple of years the Western returns and mostly they break even or are moderate hits; Appaloosa was a movie that I really wanted to see, but it only got a limited release and while it was playing in my City it was rather far out from where I live so I didn't get a chance to see it, which was probably a good thing. Based on the previews one would think Appaloosa is a shoot `em up since the trailer shows mostly action, but that's hardly what Appaloosa is. The action scenes are very brief and would probably only add up to maybe a minute of the running time. Had I seen the movie upon its release I probably wouldn't have liked it since I'd be expecting something totally different. I'm not really sure why Appaloosa got an R-rating. I've seen plenty of PG-13 movies made the last couple of years that feature far more violence than Appaloosa.

Appaloosa is very much a character driven movie and doesn't rely on action to advance the movie and thankfully the characters in Appaloosa are excellent as are the performances by the cast. I've never read the novel the movie is based upon so I cannot compare the two or how true the movie stays to the book.

The screenplay was written by Robert Knott & Ed Harris and the script was very solid and is quite simple and that's why it works so well; there's nothing really spectacular about the characters, but they all work well for the most part and the main characters Virgil Cole played by Ed Harris and Everett Hitch played by Viggo Mortensen are two great characters and they work so well because they are simple characters and very likeable and noble. What makes Virgil and Everett work so well is they aren't the typical heroes. I think it was a great change of pace than the norm. Knott & Harris really do a solid job with the screenplay and the fact it's a simple straight forward story makes it even better.

Besides co-writing and starring Ed Harris also directed Appaloosa and this is his 2nd feature film and I really hope Ed Harris does some more directing. He's a terrific and underrated actor, but he's also an excellent director. The pacing of the movie is slow, but never boring and the story is always moving forward I do think a few minutes could have been edited to help the pacing a little more, but again it's never boring. The action scenes are very brief, but they work well. Don't expect a long and drawn out action scenes; they're brief, but work well, but I do feel the final showdown was slightly anti-climatic, while it worked, but this was the one action scene that could have been slightly longer. Ed Harris clearly has an eye for Westerns and he makes one of the better ones over the last few years.

Like I said earlier don't go in expecting a shoot `em up; this isn't anything like the remake of 3:10 to Yuma. Appaloosa is more of a character study and the plot set up seems like the typical Western with Everett and Virgil brought into Appaloosa to clean it up of the outlaws, but despite the plot again Appaloosa features little action and more focus on the characters. Ed Harris is great as Virgil Cole, Harris gives a terrific offbeat performance and Viggo Mortensen is quickly moving up the ranks as one of my favorite actors. This role is a lot more laid back compared to his recent roles, Everett is a man of few words, but Viggo once again delivers a knockout of a performance as does Ed Harris and the two actors work amazing together.

Jeremy Irons as Randall Bragg makes for an excellent if not underused villain. Irons plays a good part in the movie, but I would have liked to have seen a bigger part in the movie. Like I said Jeremy Irons makes for a good villain, but the part wasn't big enough for the viewer to really dislike him. Renee Zellweger does well in the role of Allison French, but I did feel her character didn't really add much. Had her scenes could have been mostly edited out it wouldn't hurt the movie one bit. Not that her scenes hurt the movie or anything, but her character was the least interesting of the lot.

Sadly Appaloosa only got a limited release and in the age of big special F/X this movie will probably get lost in the shuffle and be forgotten about. And the fact it features very little action your average moviegoer will probably be bored. But with that said Appaloosa is an excellent Western that's driven by the characters rather than the action. If you want a big shoot `em up check out the excellent 3:10 to Yuma, but if you want more of a crime/drama with some suspense and comedy thrown into the mix Appaloosa is worth a viewing. In my opinion Appaloosa was one of the top films of 08 and hopefully finds its audience.

The Blu-ray looks beautiful; the transfer is top notch and the sound quality is amazing. I haven't seen the DVD so I don't know how it looks, but the extra features are the same",1232150400,,5505,4.416748768472907

3687453,5,B001LM6VTU,If you're looking for the 3:10 to Yuma then catch another train.  Appaloosa is a slower and character driven movie.  When the shooting starts it's done in an authentic manner with no hollywood fast-draws out of modern day low slung holsters.  The attention to historic detail is fantastic.  As a resident of New Mexico I was happy to see many familar areas used in the filming.  Also I was pleased that much of the dialog between Cole and Hitch was straight from the pages of the book.  This movie might not be for everyone but if you are looking for an authentic western and well told story this one works just fine.,1232150400,2,617,4.464285714285714
3687454,3,B001LM6VTU,"""Appaloosa"" is less a classic Western than a character drama set in the New Mexico Territory of 1882. Actor Ed Harris directs, stars in the film, co-produces, and co-wrote the script with Robert Knott,  based on the novel by Robert B. Parker. Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) are lawmen for hire whose no-nonsense manner and quick guns have served their dozen-year partnership well. The town of Appaloosa turns to Cole and Hitch after the scoundrel Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) murders their Marshall and his deputies rather than allow two of his henchmen to be arrested. As the duo attempt to rid the town of Bragg's menace and secure evidence against him, a flirtatious widow, Allie French (Renee Zellweger) arrives in town and catches Virgil's eye.

Unlike classic Westerns, ""Appaloosa"" is not allegory, or, if it was, that was lost in translation to the screen. It's a chapter in the relationship between Virgil and Everett, both laconic, introverted men who seem most comfortable with solitude -or with each other. Virgil is the less educated and less smart of the two, but he knows his stuff and recognizes that Everett's one weakness is that he has feelings. It would be an intriguing relationship if there were more of it, but ""Appaloosa"" only scratches the surface. The villain, Randall Bragg, is poorly drawn. Why is he at odds with the townspeople? Why would he take such risks to protect a couple of irredeemably criminal ranch hands? These questions are answered in a prologue that was cut from the film. While I agree that the prologue is awkward, the information needs to be incorporated somewhere in order for the story to make sense.

Jeremy Irons is underutilized and doesn't have enough screen time to make Bragg interesting or menacing. Virgil and Everett's friendship is interesting. Allie, a sort of bourgeois whore, is interesting. It's interesting when the protagonists must join their enemies in a common cause. But everyone is adrift in a script that doesn't focus on any one thing. Some sequences are quite good, but an underwritten, apparently unmotivated villain who is scarcely seen is insufficient to arouse the audience's interest in the basic conflict. A voiceover narration at the beginning and end is unnecessary. There were moments when I really liked ""Appaloosa"" but too many when I wondered what I was supposed to make of it all.

The DVD (Warner Brothers 2009): There are 4 featurettes, 6 deleted scenes with optional commentary, and a feature commentary. I don't' usually recommend watching deleted scenes, but the deleted prologue does explain Bragg's motives. ""Bringing the Characters of Appaloosa to Life"" (7 1/2 min) interviews Ed Harris, Robert Knott, DP Dean Semler, and the cast about the relationships and characters. ""Historic Accuracy of Appaloosa"" (10 min) interviews director, cast, costume designer, property master and others about the props. In ""The Town of Appaloosa"" (5 min), production designer Waldemar Kalinowski talks about how the town developed. ""Dean Semler's Return to the Western"" (5 min) interviews the DP about shooting on film in anamorphic format. The feature commentary by Ed Harris, with Robert Knott, is a little sporadic and discusses technical details, filming, sets, camera work.

3687455,5,B001LM6VTU,"This is a more realistic western with a good story and attention to detail.  The actors really pull off a great movie in this one.  Jeremy Irons is a excellent villian who seems to escape justice. Has he reformed or is he as bad as ever?  That's for the viewer to decide and one thing we don't have to decide on is that Ed Harris needs to direct more movies like this one. Whatever time period he decides to set his next movie in.
The lead actress also takes a person that is too easy to judge and makes her seem very sympathetic to a degree. After all in the old west, women without a alpha male protector were in extreme danger. Especially of finding themselve; due to poverty of being confined to absolute prostitution.  At least until the rule of law and civilizing of all the boom towns took place. This usually was a 2 to at most 4 year period for most towns.

3687456,4,B001LM6VTU,"Last year I saw a trailer for Appaloosa, the cinematic adaptation of Robert B. Parker's western novel, directed by Ed Harris, starring Harris and Viggo Mortensen. This trailer got me very excited, as I've been a huge fan of Parker's for a very long time, I love westerns, and Ed Harris is not only a damn fine actor but a superior director as well (proven in 2000's Pollock). And Viggo's no slouch either, nor is Jeremy Irons, who's also in the film.

But Appaloosa had actually sat unread on my shelf for a couple of years because Parker's previous foray into the old West, Gunman's Rhapsody (a novel about Wyatt Earp, one of my favorite historical figures), had been a disappointment. I'd intended to get to it (thus the fact it was on the shelf at all), but hadn't yet. Since I generally prefer to read a book before seeing the movie it inspires, I immediately rescued Appaloosa from its lonely spot and dove in.

Short review: the book's awesome. These old West peacekeepers walk the same metaphorical mean streets as Parker's other tough guys, like Spenser, Hawk, and Jesse Stone, dusty as the streets in the town of Appaloosa may be. The familiar Parker themes are all here, the honor and friendship between men, the unflagging devotion to a woman loved (even when it's probably not deserved), the violent life lived according to a code...and all that stuff works perfectly in this milieu. Additionally, as Parker himself has aged, his treatment of these themes has deepened; there is more of a sense of human fallibility in his characters these days, and the codes they live by don't always serve them well.

Finishing the book, I was even more jazzed about the movie. But for various reasons, I didn't manage to get out to see it in the theater, so my excitement shifted to the day it was due on DVD (and, more importantly to me with my PS3, Blu-Ray), which was this past Tuesday.

I watched it, and really enjoyed it, though it doesn't ascend to the level of some other westerns in recent years, like 2007's dynamite remake of 3:10 to Yuma. It's full of great performances, very true to the novel, gorgeously shot, and every detail onscreen is researched and thought out, from the stamped tin stars worn by the lawmen to the varying architectural styles of a frontier town built piecemeal over time by people of differing cultural backgrounds. It's not an action film, maintaining the low-key and straightforward tone and pace of Parker's novel, and ultimately works best as a character drama rather than an adventure story. To some, it may actually be too realistic for a good western. To others, it may rise above other films in the genre for that very reason.

Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen have incredible chemistry, both laconic but Harris very stolid and forthright while Mortensen's more playful and ironic. Jeremy Irons is, go figure, a great villain, but beyond that, he is such a perfect western bad guy it's amazing he's never been in one before. The cast beyond them is full of great character actors like Lance Henriksen, Timothy Spall, and James Gammon, who all bring their characters vividly to life. The only role I'd have cast differently was Allie: Renee Zellweger doesn't really bring much to the character.

The book was more satisfying overall, though I have little doubt I'd have enjoyed the film more had I not read the book first. Still, I did really like the movie, and it put me back in the mood to read Parker's follow-up books, Resolution and Brimstone.

One odd note, especially considering the incredible effort Harris and his team put into making a film so authentic to its period, was that as the credits roll, a Tom Petty (Mudcrutch) song starts to play. It's a fine enough tune, but I hate when Hollywood does this. It just doesn't fit. Then, as is my wont, I let the credits play, and after the Petty tune, another more appropriate song started up, and I instantly recognized the voice of the singer: Ed Harris. I watched the credits to see if I was right, and sure enough, the song ""You'll Never Leave My Heart"" was not only sung by Harris, it was co-written by him. And while Harris's rough performance doesn't reach Johnny Cash levels, he does hover in Robert ""Thunder Road"" Mitchum territory, and fares far better than Lee ""Born Under A Wanderin' Star"" Marvin. Not only was the song absolutely appropriate for the film, unlike the Petty, it was good enough I now have it on my iPod.",1232064000,,4430,4.679075738125802

The film is told in a no-nonsense way, avoiding star moments which often slow the proceedings.

All are first rate cowboy movies with action and a great story. I consider 3:10 the lessor of the three because of the ending. I'd rate this up there with Open Range. Both Appaloosa and Open Range are top notch buddy flicks. Both tell stories of cowboy buddies that have known each other for years and are in a hard place and only have each other and themselves to get out alive. Both tell stories of cowboys with ethics, that do what is right. And both have a love story. And both stories show that buddies, no matter how long you have known them, there is still something you don't know about them.

The two main things that people find wrong with Appaloosa are the casting of Renee Zellweger (which to some extent I agree with but can't think of anyone who might fit better) and the film drags at times. I don't think it drags at times, though some may. I think the casting of Jeremy Irons was a little off, not because of how he played his role, but because most know he is English and associate him as English, not as a western rancher. But he handles the role well.

Overall, it is a GREAT western. I grew up on the spaghetti westerns of the 60s and 70s and think it is a great homage to those movies. When you watch the extras you find that there was total attention to detail even on a tight budget. They pulled off a masterpiece for a relatively small amount of money because Ed Harris got people he knew involved. The film really is a statement of what some great people in the motion picture industry think of Ed Harris.

Harris' take on the western is a tried and true portrait that delivers the goods that viewers would hope to find with the film, and it delivers them quite good to boot.  Harris and Mortensen in particular are perfect in their respective roles, while Zellweger and Irons deliver solid turns as well.

In 2009 it's refreshing ,beleive it or not,to be once again taken out West,to a beautiful land by way of a genre once thought to be done for..and if that's not enough,there's no computer animation,ttrying to show real folks who aren't,or synthetic music,or cartoon animation,or all that fake blood that makes you feel like the filmmaker must think you are just dumn enough to beleive a gunshot is followed by a quart of red stuff spraying all ove the place opposite,or backwards from the trajectory of the bullet. Thanks Ed,you've made a bold film,maybe one of my favorites.
11)because Jeremy Irons,a great British actor,Plays the role of Bragg with such relish that he is almost evil lookingHe's one of those  bad
badguys who drowns kittens on one of his more compassionate days..

Jeremy Irons tempers himself as Bragg, a murderous power broker who dabbles in ranching, mining, hotels and other ventures.

Naturally, the movie draws comparisons to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lonesome-Dove/dp/B0018PH3L0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lonesome Dove</a>&nbsp;but that reflects the ease and comfort of the Harris-Mortensen partnership.

Clocking in at 115 minutes, Appaloosa could benefit by restoring several deleted scenes (Harris has said he intends this if a director's cut is released) without the risk of exceeding the run time of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Assassination-of-Jesse-James-by-the-Coward-Robert-Ford/dp/B0010DR4BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</a>&nbsp;(160 minutes). Both westerns are essentially character studies peppered with flashes of action but the latter film benefitted from Roger Deakins' luscious cinematography. To be fair, Appaloosa cinematographer Dean Semler, working on a tighter budget and film, creates a dusty, gritty landscape that matches the story's throwback style.

To its advantage, Appaloosa has moments of humor that sets it apart from other contemporary Westerns. The story is based on Robert B. Parker's novel of the same name. Parker is best known for his Spenser books that later became the TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spenser-For-Hire/dp/B0009NSDW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spenser: For Hire</a>. The witty banter between Harris and Mortensen is toned down compared with Spenser but you get the sense Robert Urich and Avery Brooks shared similar dialogue.

Another plus is the depth of quality character actors - James Gammon, Timothy Spall, Lance Henriksen and Tom Bower to name a few. Although, there's one casting flaw that nearly derails the entire film: Renee Zellweger as Allison French. I might dwell on Zellweger's lack of chemistry with Harris or her come-and-go southern accent but neither flaw distracts as much as her face.

I don't know what happened to Zellweger, voted by People magazine as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world in 2001. She appears here with angry eyebrows rising at 45 angles from the bridge of her nose, her eyes are squinty and dull, squeezed together by blotchy cheeks and a cr&egrave;me-filled forehead that rivals Nicole Kidman's Botox brow. About 10 minutes into the movie I realized where I'd seen that face before --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeff-Dunham-s-puppet-Walter/dp/B000E5LEXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeff Dunham's puppet, Walter</a>.

The story is interesting, the acting superb, and the dialog really top-notch, especially between the two leading actors: Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen. There really is nothing bad I can say about this film, and it's a pleasure to watch on Blu-Ray.

With a story centered more on dialog and suspense (you're never quite sure what these edgy characters are going to do next), this movie reminded me of ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" in that it showed you don't need much violence to make a good western.  Kudos for Harris, too, for his directing efforts.  This is a wonderful movie.",1231804800,,818,4.807142857142857
3687508,4,B001LM6VTU,"Appaloosa is a great, crowd-pleaser of a western that contains most of what makes modern-day westers so good in the first place.  Ed Harris directs, co-scripts, and stars as Virgil Cole, who along with his longtime partner Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) come to the town of Appaloosa to be new lawmen, and to take down a slippery, murderous rancher (Jeremy Irons).  Things get complicated by a shady widower (Renee Zellweger) who catches the eye and heart of Cole, and every other element combines to lead up to an inevitable showdown.  While it never reaches the level of greatness that James Mangold's remake of 3:10 to Yuma did, Appaloosa doesn't try to either.  Harris' take on the western is a tried and true portrait that delivers the goods that viewers would hope to find with the film, and it delivers them quite good to boot.  Harris and Mortensen in particular are perfect in their respective roles, while Zellweger and Irons deliver solid turns as well.  With gorgeous cinematography and supporting work from Lance Henriksen and Timothy Spall, Appaloosa is a treat of a western that every fan of the genre will find something to admire about it.",1231804800,,1157,4.877551020408164
3687509,4,B001LM6VTU,"Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch are gunmen who take it upon themselves to keep the law in a small town.  They find themselves up against land-owner Randall Bragg, a thoroughly dangerous man who has the deviousness and the clout to get himself out of almost any situation.  What he didn't expect, however, was Hitch and Cole.  And what Hitch and Cole didn't expect was a mysterious young woman...

Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen were born to act together; you saw it in ""A History of Violence,"" and you see it here, too.  The two men have such chemistry, you fully believe that they have been riding together for years.  It should also be mentioned that Harris is, perhaps, the consumate Western actor: he has the grit and the stature to play a rough-and-tumble outlaw.

It's nice to see Jeremy Irons snarling his way across the screen again.  Lance Henriksen leads the stellar supporting cast.  Renee Zellweger is, perhaps, a bit mis-cast; she doesn't exactly have the chops to hold her own with her co-stars, though she does certainly try.  Harris's directing is top-notch; the man has a feel for Westerns, the way they should be framed and felt.  ""Appaloosa"" comes off feeling like it was made decades ago, back when Westerns weren't just popular, they were an art form.  It may not be as great as some of the classics, but it's a wonderful homage, and a worthy entry into the Western film cannon.",1231632000,,1396,4.676229508196721
3687510,5,B001LM6VTU,"Truly one of those great westerns that appears to only come along every few years. I gave this a 5 star rating because Ed managed to put together a believable western onto a solid BD (from film stock) - all while showing how to do things at a low cost.

Everyone shines through in their performances, even when nuanced to such a minimalist theme, that nothing detracts from the story. The locale was set prefect for what they were trying to accomplish, and choosing to use film instead of digital (especially with Semler at the helm) captured the needed feel in just the right way (colors, hues, etc.).

The BD offers both TrueHD and 5.1 for sound, but admittedly the bass and outer channels only get heavily used when that beautiful 8-gauge goes off (especially indoors). The picture clarity was perfect and even in the night shots around fires or indoors, the color palettes still appeared adequately.

The 4 BD docus total 30 minutes and provide plenty of great production background and historical information. The train and gun buffs will get the most out of it, as will some of the fashion interests. Dean Semler's (very prominent cinematographer) comment on knowing he is getting back to the old ways by stepping in horseh*t on the set instead of gum sums it up best. The deleted scenes should have been left in the film and would have added greatly to the urgency of what our main characters were doing, but you can't have it all (total about 10 minutes).

A re-watchable film from beginning to end, and it has been captivating people of all ages that pass through the store with the scenery and popular cast.",1231372800,16,1617,4.663157894736842
3687511,4,B001LM6VTU,"Apaloosa, a story of two law men for hire who saunter into a small town looking for the murderer of the previous marshall, is simply one of the best.

3687512,4,B001LM6VTU,"On the immediate surface ""Apaloosa"" occurs as an old school Western grounded in the battle of good against evil. For the most part first time director/ writer Ed Harris's ""Apaloosa"" is the traditional tale of gunslingers hired to protect the town against the malevolent rancher, who terrorizes the town of Apaloosa. This slithery and wily Rancher is Randall Bragg, well played by Academy Award Winner Jeremy Irons. Irons is amazing. In the opening Bragg (Irons) kills the town Marshall and his deputies in cold blood. So there is no question surrounding Bragg's character. Harris and Viggo Mortensen play Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch, who are lawmen for hire. The town of Apaloosa signs a contract with Virgil and Everett paying them to protect the town from Bragg. As part of the deal Apaloosa surrenders legal jurisdiction and autonomy to Cole and Hitch. This is pretty straight forward until femme fatale widow Allison French (Renee Zellwegger) arrives in town. Virgil takes a quick fancy to Allison, but her motives are vague and questionable at best. Will she threaten Virgil's partnership with Everett?

First off, I ultimately liked ""Apaloosa"", because Viggo Mortensen is awesome as Everett. Despite the movie's quirky idiosyncrasies, Mortensen commands the heroic presence as the sensible man of honor. Mortensen is the Western hero in the tradition of Clint Eastwood. As Everett, we always know where Mortensen stands, and he is both charismatic and cool. In a great scene a rival asks Everett about Virgil's gun prowess. Everett says plainly, ""I haven't seen anyone as good as Virgil."" Mortensen's Virgil salvages the movie's sense of honor.

As mentioned previously, ""Apaloosa"" is not really all that traditional just below the surface. And this is not necessarily a good thing. This is not the anti-hero masterpiece of Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"". In one sense, I think Harris would like it to be. For one thing although Harris's Virgil is brave and noble, he is an apparent partial nut job. He goes nonlinear on some hoods in a saloon, among other weird out bursts. Harris's Virgil is not an educated man, and clumsily forces his diction and stumbles through Emerson. Instead of coming off as charmingly eccentric, his Virgil occurs as a little weird. Renee Zellwegger is an amazing actress, but here she struggles to carry off pretty. Her character Allison also has the propensity to have sex with virtually any man with a pulse. Straight and narrow Virgil in love with psycho whore Allison is not the most conventional love story, nor is it the story's most endearing plot line. Again, this may be more artifact of the screenplay by Harris and Robert Knot based on Robert B. Parker's best selling novel.

In spite of its quirkiness and kind of nutty characters, Harris manages to reign in the movie as it concludes-- opting for the more heroic. There is a great scene before one the climatic showdowns where Allison asks Virgil and Everett, ""Aren't either of you at all afraid?"" Virgil says, ""...I guess I don't think about that so much."" Also in ""Apaloosa"" the action is not leveraged for the utmost drama. Director Harris's action sequences lack crispness--the gun fight blocking is mostly single shot, without any interesting angles. Aside from the last gun fight, most of the action is diluted of high drama. The action is well done, just not spectacular.

""Apaloosa"" is an amalgamation of the traditional Western with the idiosyncratic melodrama of the new. The overall effect is compelling, and also makes you scratch your head. Viggo Mortensen's strong and charismatic performance as Everett Hitch eventually wins out, and makes ""Apaloosa"" worth watching.",1231027200,,3680,5.0776859504132235
3687513,4,B001LM6VTU,"I saw Appaloosa in the theaters, and enjoyed it a lot. Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen and Renee Zellweger were all great as usual, and the unconvential triangle that forms among them is interesting and compelling.

Unfortunately, I felt that Jeremy Irons didn't come across as a bad enough villian, which is odd, because he has played really great evil villians in the past. I felt a stronger villian would have strengthened the film.

The main issue I have with this movie is that it was begging for a grand musical score, as one has grown to expect from the Western genre. I realize that they had a budget to work with, but I would rather have heard a lone harmonica playing old traditional western melodies (in public domain), accompanied occasionally by a synthesizer, than the score that they ended up using, which sounded like an afterthought.

I felt that with a bit more work, this film could have been coaxed into the realm of greatness. Instead, it is a good movie, entertaining and very watchable, but not at the head of the pack.",1230940800,2,1037,4.655737704918033
3687514,4,B001LM6VTU,"The story of Appaloosa is very similar to that of the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warlock/dp/B0007PALQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warlock</a>. Two mercenary ""lawmen"" are summoned to a town being terrorized by a local band of cowboys (led by a powerful and particularly ruthless rancher -- in Appaloosa's case, Randall Bragg played by Jeremy Irons). These lawmen are close friends and have worked together for many years, moving from town to town killing bad guys for money. They are called upon when the town's previous sheriff is murdered. They agree to clean up the town, but only if the town agrees to grant them any power they wish to do so.

Here the stories of Warlock and Appaloosa diverge. Warlock makes great use of the idea that fighting outlaws with mercenaries is a morally questionable solution, while Appaloosa features only one scene that ponders the question, even though the setup seems tailor-made for further conflict. Harris' character, Virgil, has been made uncomfortable and embarrassed by a conversation with his romantic interest (played by Renee Zellwegger), so he takes it out on some workers having a drink at the bar. Though drunk, they are doing no harm, and Harris' explosive temper and sense of impunity are first exhibited as he viciously pummels one of them before being restrained by Viggo's character (Everett). One of the town's officials questions this behavior, but beyond that it is never addressed again.

Other story similarities include a confrontation at the jailhouse (though the specifics of the scene were more reminiscent of one in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rio-Bravo/dp/B000P6XU5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rio Bravo</a>), a love interest that may lead to the retirement of one of the characters and the dissolution of their partnership, a final shoot-out that ends the partnership and that the title of each movie is simply the name of the town in which the action takes place.

Beyond those the story plays out in a very different fashion. There is no character equivalent in Appaloosa to Richard Widmark's outlaw-turned-lawman, Everett doesn't have any of the shadiness that Anthony Quinn's ""Doc Holiday"" had, and there is no betrayal among the old friends. The romantic interest also plays out very differently in Appaloosa.

Overall, the story is good, but there did seem to be a few too many Acts. I didn't mind that much, because I enjoyed all the possibly extraneous scenes, but it did feel a little long, a little less tight, even though the movie ran just under two hours. And there was one bone-headed decision that you see coming from a mile away. If you're a smart guy who has been cleaning out towns of bad guys for years now, what's the dumbest thing you can do? Very publicly fall in love with a girl who now lives in the town. I said out loud ""liability and leverage"" as soon as I saw Virgil go after her.

Other good points: Harris demonstrates a talent for writing (and delivering) comfortable, funny, and natural sounding dialogue. (A friend of mine said the dialogue at the beginning was bad, but I don't remember.) The relationship between Everett and Virgil is great. They effectively demonstrate respect, loyalty and love in subtle believable ways. Renee Zellwegger's character surprises you several times and turns out to be as interesting as the two leads. Irons' character doesn't have much substance to him other than ""I'm a jerk,"" but he does have some good moments of interaction with the Virgil and Everett.

Harris, along with his DP, has a good eye for the scenery. Everything is shot on location, and it looks great. He also shoots within these locales well; I always knew where the characters were in relation to one another (which sounds simplistic, but I'm thinking of the scene on the river with the Indians where Everett rides up to meet them). I appreciated the unique camera work in the scene on the train where Allison is brought out from underneath the bridge.

Of course, I have to comment on the action and perpetrators there-of. This isn't&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-10-to-Yuma-2007/dp/B000XRO3MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3:10 to Yuma (2007)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tombstone/dp/B00005RHGL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tombstone</a>, so the gunplay is pretty sparse. But when it happens, it's well-staged, and often unique in consequence. Virgil and Everett rescuing the kidnappers from the Indians, for example, plays out differently than you might expect. Allison has been kidnapped in order to secure Bragg's release, and Virgil and Everett have tracked them to a canyon. Before they can act, they notice a party of Indians about to raid them. They allow this until the Indians start to take Allison. Rather than shooting the Indians, Virgil and Everett shoot the pack-horse that Allison is on, and fire up into the air to scatter the raiding party. Later, Everett offers the group Bragg's horse to make up for the one they shot. Another unique scene is the shoot-out in the Mexican town. It's close-quarters and over in seconds. It also leads to one of the funniest lines in the movie.

Virgil and Everett lie on the ground, wounded but alive.

Everett: That was quick.
Virgil: Yeah, everybody could shoot.

The sound design is excellent, right up there with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Range/dp/B0000TANUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Range</a>&nbsp;in terms of power and realism.

And the guns! Well, The Gun, anyway.

As you may have read, Everett carries a very unique item: an 8-gauge double-barreled shotgun. Until Appaloosa, I didn't even know 8 was a possible gauge. I'd heard of 10-gauges, and only seen one or two at all the gun auctions I've been to. For those unfamiliar with the gauge system, the smaller the number, the larger the bore. 12-gauge is the most popular. My double-barrel is 12. So the 8-gauge that Everett wields is HUGE, and is mentioned specifically about five times in the beginning of the movie. There are only one or two scenes where Everett is without it, too. He lugs that honkin' thing around everywhere he goes. And you only get to see him use it twice! The other guns are all pretty standard, though I noticed Everett's sidearm is a Colt open-top conversion, which is also unique.

I recommend Appaloosa to Western fans and fans of Viggo & Ed.

The Blu-ray edition of this film sports a nice transfer, great sound, and a few decent supplements.",1230768000,77,6655,5.3865384615384615
3687515,3,B001LM6VTU,"If not for the always brilliant Viggo Mortensen and the equally talented Ed Harris, Appaloosa would be quite the borefest. I have never liked Westerns. This is not an exception either. I found the film to be very slow moving and the plot completely dull. Ren&eacute;e Zellwegger's awful performance didn't help matters and I will not be mentioning her again here.

However, the subtle relationship between the two main characters is really the key to this film. They don't talk much but they communicate with greater clarity in one scene than most actors do in an entire film. It really is amazing to watch, and slightly humorous. Mortensen and Harris are like an old married couple. They really get each other and have such a great rapport throughout the film. If not for them, this movie would be a waste of time.

Jeremy Irons is the other standout here. Of course, he's good with any material and you get a sense that he almost doesn't belong in the bleak boring western, but forget all about  that as soon as you hear that familiar rasp. While his character is clich&eacute; and not all that interesting, it still doesn't matter because the actor is just so damn good at what he does. He plays bad very well.

There is supposedly a twist that really isn't and like I said, the plot leaves much to be desired and the ending feels quite rushed and unsatisfying-but if you happen to like westerns, then Appaloosa might be worth at least one look. *** for the performances. ** for the actual film.",1229990400,5,1498,4.620300751879699

The acting by both Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen is outstanding and the dialogue is believable for the most part. There is even some good humor thrown in, especially in the first half of the movie. While not as dark and gritty as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, Ed Harris has created a western that never seems to be in a hurry. It has a nice relaxing feel to it, though the last half could have been trimmed up a bit. There isn't much action at all, and when there is, it is over in no time. Which is realistic (The real gunfight at the O.K. Corral was over in 30 seconds), but might not please the average person who paid $10.00 to see 3:10 to Yuma (2007 version) all over again.

3687531,4,B001LM6VTU,"""Appaloosa"" combines the best of traditional and modern Westerns. Ed Harris, who directs as well as stars in the film, has created a great combination of the two perpectives in this adaptation of the Robert B. Parker (Spenser For Hire) novel.

Harris plays Virgil Cole, who with his partner Everett Hitch (played by Viggo Mortensen), roams the West as hired guns who come in and tame towns where lawlessness reigns. Such is the case in Appaloosa, which is run by rancher Randall Bragg, who killed the town marshal (an old friend of Cole's) and his two deputies. Cole and Hitch begin the cleanup process straightaway, but everything becomes complicated with the appearance in town of Allison French (played by Renee Zellweger), a young widow who captures the heart of crusty Cole and soon, the hardened lawman moves in on her. But later, she comes on Hitch, setting the stage for issues of life, future, and loyalty to be explored while the lawmen deal with the woman and the wily Bragg, who has a few tricks up his sleeve.

The look, feel, and the tone feels very traditional, but the screenplay and action are more modern in their staging, which means the language is saltier, and the action faster, just as it would be in real life. Harris and Mortensen seem like they have been acting in Westerns their entire career. Zellweger hits the right notes as a woman  who does what she has to do to survive.

3687533,4,B001LM6VTU,"I grew up in a generation of people who watched Westerns all the time. I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. This plodding, laconic entry falls somewhere between the good and the bad, but because of the quality of the people involved - and the overall good acting - it's closer to good.

Virgil Cole (Ed Harris, here doing double duty as director) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) roll into the town of Appaloosa to deal justice to its local bad boy, Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), who reportedly has shot the former sheriff and two of his men. Nobody uses more language than is necessary; Virgil and Everett have been friends a long, long time, and know each other so well that little talk is needed. They're here to do a job, and they go about it pragmatically.

Ah, but the flow of duty never does run smooth. Enter into the mix Allie (Renee Zellweger), who has come to town apparently on a manhunt of her own. She is so painfully transparent that only the unschooled-in-women's-wiles Virgil can't see through her. She's after the main man, whose identity can change from frame to frame.

I found Allie's brazen discussions with Virgil and Everett a bit hard to take; even a hussy in those days, I think, would not be quite as direct as Allie when she has her heading and knows where she's going. Everett seems to have her pegged from the outset, and it's no surprise that she changes sides like underwear - and Virgil, whose concentration is mostly on the subject of Bragg, is only distracted, not enlightened, by her talk.

In the course of time, Bragg is being transported to another locality by Virgil and Everett to answer for his crimes. Here things got a little improbable for me; I need a heavy dose of 'willing suspension of disbelief' and from the train ride on that got sorely tested. Rival bounty hunters get involved, anxious to take on the burden of Bragg, and they use Virgil's vulnerability where Allie is concerned to that effect. Allie, however, seemed a little too composed for me; the dullest observer could see that she wasn't in the least concerned to be caught up in this trouble, and in fact seemed to enjoy being the center of attention. Everett knows better, but poor Virgil lets his feelings take over, and instead of doing his duty with Bragg, he opts to rescue Allie.

Nothing is said or done here that hasn't been before. This is, overall, a pretty standard Western, a little slower-moving than most, but I have to give it points because of the personnel involved. Jeremy Irons proves again that he can do a good bad guy, unprincipalled, evil, dastardly; and Viggo and Ed work together well. With others, the slow, measured speech might not work as well, but it fits these two like a glove. And Renee plays a good tart, who for some odd reason has decided that the Wild West is a great place for a man smorgasbord where she can pick and choose.

I will watch any Western, and this one wasn't an all-out snore, but it was lacking in fast pacing. Very stylized, though, with excellent settings, shot in black and white to align it with the Westerns of the past. I always wonder how the West ever evolved into civilization after seeing the sort of people that area of the country attracted; those who didn't shoot each other are usually portrayed as ineffectual nobodys who can't manage their own little town. ""Appaloosa"" reserves its best scene for the last few minutes of the movie, and it was worth it for that. I needed a Western fix, and ""Appaloosa"" answered that.",1225584000,,3506,4.583732057416268
3687534,4,B001LM6VTU,"Back in April '06, I reviewed the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Appaloosa/dp/0425204324/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Appaloosa</a>&nbsp;by Robert Parker and thought it nothing extraordinary. As a matter of fact, I called it a ""full-length novel wannabee"" and gave it but three stars.

The visual presentation of the story elevates the entertainment value of it considerably, especially when you have such fine actors as Ed Harris (Virgil Cole), Viggo Mortensen (Everett Hitch), and Jeremy Irons (Randall Bragg) populating the script.

There's no point rehashing the plot of the film since it faithfully follows that of the text version and is tidily summarized in my review of the latter. Suffice it to say that the substantive essence of the storyline is the friendship between Virgil and Everett, a friendship which causes the latter to take an action so drastic at the conclusion - brought on by a fickle woman, of course - that it emphasized the relationship's value to both men. Indeed, Hitch becomes the real hero of the story in a poignant sort of way, and one only hopes that, in the alternative universe occupied by these fictional characters, Cole appreciates Everett's gesture.

Renee Zellweger plays the role of Allie French, the ""fickle woman"" of the piece. As I understand it, Diane Lane was originally targeted for the role but she dropped out. As much as I adore Lane, Zellweger was perhaps better suited since, in my estimation, she portrays pathetic and needy characters better than just about anyone.

As I inferred from the credits, much of APPALOOSA was filmed in beautiful northern New Mexico around Chama, the western terminus of the Cumbres and Toltec Steam Railroad, in itself a recreation activity worth mentioning. It's nice to see an American western shot in the U.S.A. instead of Canada for a change.

On a superficial level, APPALOOSA reminds me of the 2003 Big Screen release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Range/dp/B0000TANUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Range</a>&nbsp;starring Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner, and Annette Bening in that in both we have two rugged trail pardners going up against an evil rancher. I think OPEN RANGE the better of the two, though both depict the chaotic nature of close range pistol battles with, I believe, admirable accuracy. Here, there's no pinpoint sharp-shooting at fifty paces as popularized by Eastwood's Man-with-No-Name.

The Big Screen Western is a moribund genre. For one such as me that grew up in the 50s and 60s, the reappearance of one is a rare treat to be savored.",1224979200,,2645,5.534653465346534

As marshal, Cole demands some leeway to take care of things his way, and that is granted by the town.  Soon, Cole and Hitch are able to stage a midnight arrest of Bragg at his hideout, but getting justice is not that easy.  Bragg's men are out to get him back.

Not many westerns make it to theaters these days, but ""Appaloosa"", Ed Harris' second directorial effort does not disappoint.  The leads all produce real characters that are not perfect people.  There is an understated humor that keeps things from getting to heavy, and everything in the film looks authentic.  ""Appaloosa"" is an entertaining film that will satisfy any thirst for a fresh western.  I recommend it.",1224806400,,966,4.668639053254438
3687536,2,B001LM6VTU,"Ed Harris wanted to make a western, a traditional western, the type of western your grand dad watched and appreciated when he went to the movies. ""Appaloosa"", co-written, produced and directed by Harris, who also stars, is unapologetically old-fashioned. I can almost hear him during some of the pre-production meetings ""We aren't going to deal with any moral dilemmas, any ecological issues, any issues about how the West was. We are going to tell a story about two men who ride into town, try to clean it up because an evil rancher is running roughshod over everyone."" More power to him. But ""Appaloosa"" suffers from weak characters and as a result is one of the dullest movie going experiences I have had in a long, long time.

The Marshall of a small town in the west rides up to Randall Bragg's (Jeremy Irons) expansive ranch. Bragg's ragtag crew of rough men flanks him as they confront the Marshall and his two sidekicks. Soon, the Marshall is dead and Bragg's men continue to take over the town with little regard for anyone's safety, health or welfare. The town elders (Timothy Spall, Tom Bower and James Gammon) urgently meet with Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen), two guns for hire who provide Marshall services to towns in need. For a price. The town elders initially balk at the terms, but then agree, allowing Cole and Hitch to set up shop. They soon make their presence known to some of Bragg's men and the rancher comes into town to deal with the situation himself. Bragg realizes they are a force to reckon with and backs off. Temporarily. Allison French (Renee Zellweger), a widow, arrives on one of the infrequent trains and quickly makes the acquaintance of Cole and Hitch. Cole is immediately smitten and offers to get her a job playing piano in the hotel and assures her there is a room available. He has the connections to make that happen. Soon, they start courting and making plans for the future. Cole and Hitch quickly determine Bragg is in fact guilty of murder and set about bringing him in. But Bragg's men are almost as persistent as their boss and Bragg proves to be a little more slippery than Cole and Hitch initially planned.

""Appaloosa"" is an authentic looking Western. Harris and his team obviously spent a lot of time trying to make everything look right. But the film is a pretty straightforward telling of a basic horse opera. In recent years, Clint Eastwood, James Mangold and Kevin Costner have all made westerns that, along with HBO's ""Deadwood"",  incorporate the tell tale hallmarks of this genre into stories that actually deal with some of the relevant issues so often ignored in films of this genre. Racism, sexism, greed and environmental issues have all made appearances in these stories, giving them a greater relevance, more interest in our modern era and they have made more of an impression.

So Harris wants to make an old-fashioned western? To make this work, that same western has to be an edge of your seat type of experience. The action has to be nail biting, leaving you always guessing, leaving you exhausted. There have to be some intense gunfights, leaving a lot of dead bodies. There has to be some carnage.

""Appaloosa"" has some interesting, well-plotted action. But it lasts all of about fifteen minutes. Total. And when the film runs almost two hours, this leaves a lot of time for talking, character development and plot.

Generally, I am all for this. The more plot, character development and dialogue the better. If it's done well. But in ""Appaloosa"", the results are wildly uneven.

The relationship between Cole and Hitch is unique and interesting. They have worked together for a long time and have reached the point where Hitch even completes Cole's sentences and helps him out when his buddy is searching for the meaning of a word. They are basically so comfortable together, they could be married. In fact, at times, it almost seems like Hitch is more jealous of Cole's relationship with Ms. French. Is it jealousy or a feeling he has about her?

The relationship between Cole and Hitch is the one saving grace of the film. In fact, if Harris were to make a sequel chronicling the relationship of these two characters, I would buy a ticket even though I pretty much hated this film. In ""Appaloosa"", there are too many distractions from this more interesting relationship. All of these distractions are just wrong or flat out bad and the film suffers as a result.

The biggest and most problematic aspect of this film? Renee Zellweger. This is easily, by far, topping the list, the worst performance of her career. As soon as she arrives in town, stepping off the train, I expected her to be Harris' long-time girlfriend, arrived to provide him with some companionship. This would naturally be revealed after a few minutes of playful flirting in which they pretended to be strangers. The very fact that I expected this obvious clich&eacute; from this film should tell you how much hope I held after watching just a few minutes of the story. When it turns out she is a stranger to Cole, I was surprised but went along for the ride. But their relationship moves too fast. Way too fast. For the Old West. It seems like they are talking about the house they just bought together after only a day or two. Would this have ever happened in the Old West? No, probably not. But Cole is clearly in love with her, and she is clearly in love with him. Or is she? After Cole tells Hitch about their plans to finish building a house on the edge of town they have just bought from someone who ran off, Cole asks him to go down and visit Allison at the building site. She wants his opinion on her decorating plans. No, I'm not kidding. When he arrives, she immediately locks her lips on his and he breaks the embrace to leave. When this happened, people in the audience actually laughed. This isn't a good sign either. People shouldn't laugh during what is supposed to be a dramatic moment. If they do, they clearly aren't feeling the moment. And this shows the actor and the director isn't doing their job right.

Throughout the film, Zellweger's character ping-pongs back and forth between different men, causing them to discuss her feelings, motivations, her psychology. Again, laughable. God forbid anyone should actually talk to Allison about these things, but Cole and Hitch spend a lot of time discussing her, as though they are getting ready to give some notes to Freud.

Jeremy Irons' initially starts off as a promising villain. When the Marshall confronts Bragg, Bragg quickly kills the lawman, unwilling and unable to tolerate his nuisance. But his character also makes some unbelievable changes throughout the story, completely robbing him of any power, any menace. At one point, Cole and Hitch take Bragg captive after he leaves the outhouse on his property. This seems like a particularly cowardly way to take the villain in, giving Hitch and Cole and easy way out and also makes Bragg seem particularly cowardly. Later, as the lawmen chase Bragg, his character changes until he becomes laughable.

The action scenes in ""Appaloosa"" are good, but brief. And you have to wade through many minutes of poorly written exposition, keeping us away from the most interesting aspect of the film; the relationship between Cole and Hitch.",1224460800,3,7328,4.770504731861199

The relationships between this excellent cast serves as the basis for the momentum in this film.  The pace is languid, sometimes even slow, but never boring.  It has been described as a Western similar to Unforgiven.  I would have to agree with that.  It is certainly not similar to Tombstone.  This movie does not feature action packed shoot outs.  It does; however, feature excellent acting and a story in which the characters spend more time in areas that are gray than black or white.  With lesser actors, this movie would have been in the three star range for me.  With the great actors and acting, I believe this is a four star movie worth watching.

3687538,4,B001LM6VTU,"Ed Harris' ""Appaloosa"" is based on a Western by Robert P. Parker, who is best known for his Spenser detective novels. You could argue that Westerns, nearly all of which have outlaws as important characters, have always had an aspect of flim noir. But ""Appaloosa"" makes the connection plainer than usual, especially in its ending.

Itinerant lawmen Virgil Cole (Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) arrive in the town of Appaloosa, N.M., hired by the city fathers to end the reign of terror instigated by the suavely murderous rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons). Cole and Hitch, so tough they make boot leather look like marshmallow cream, manage to capture Bragg, but they get sidetracked by the arrival in town of winsome widow Allison French (Renee Zellweger). Cole and Allie are soon an item, but Allie--shall we say--doesn't want to make that exclusive. As Hitch says to Cole, ""She wants to ride with the head stallion."" ""There's only one of those,"" Cole replies. ""Yeah--at a time,"" Hitch says.

Harris tells the story a bit too leisurely at times, but he keeps our interest with some neat plot twists, opulent photography by Dean Semler, and an ending that is a fascinating variation on the principle of ""Greater Love Hath No Man."" The performances of Harris and Mortensen can reasonably be described as perfect, and Zellweger does a reasonable job of creating sympathy for a Wild West variation on the femme fatale. Irons, unfortunately, never projects quite the right kind of menace as Bragg--he exudes malevolence, but never seems quite tough enough to be a match for Cole and Hitch. Among the supporting performers, I particularly liked Timothy Spall as the lily-livered mayor of Appaloosa; Ariadna Gil as a level-headed hooker who is Hitch's confidante; and Gabriel Marantz as a stalwart young cowboy who testifies against Bragg.",1224374400,,1848,5.0756578947368425
3687539,4,B001LM6VTU,"Once upon a time, 2008's ""Appaloosa"" would have been just another entertaining western drama.  Horse operas are now scarce, and good ones scarcer still.  ""Appaloosa"" pays homage to all the best old westerns, and if it doesn't say anything terribly original, it does say it well.

The small town of Appaloosa, New Mexico, is terrorized by a lawless gang led by the ruthless Randall Bragg (a weathered Jeremy Irons).  In the opening sequence, Bragg murders the city marshal and two deputies just after finishing his morning coffee.  In despair, the town fathers of Appaloosa hire two itinerant lawman, Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch (Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen in a classic, laconic partnership) to clean up the town.  Cole and Hitch quickly assert their authority, gunning down three of Bragg's thugs, then winning a bloodless faceoff with Bragg and his gang.

Enter Ally French (Renee Zellweger), widow, piano player, and charming opportunist, who quickly comes between Cole and Hitch.  When the two lawmen arrest Bragg in a daring raid on his ranch, Ally is the means by which two hired gunmen spring him from custody.  Cole and Hitch take off in pursuit of Bragg, forcing a way through Indian country to a violent confrontation in another small town.  However, that gunfight is not the end of the story. There is one final confrontation back in Appaloosa to settle all the scores.

""Appaloosa"" is a slow-rolling movie, meditating over its austere landscapes, terse dialogue, and quick violence.  The story and the ending plot twist are dictated by the Code of the West.  This movie is highly recommended as good entertainment to fans of the classic old westerns.",1223942400,,1666,4.992753623188406
3687540,5,B001LM6VTU,"I really loved this film. It was a pleasure to see it on the big screen. Ed Harris has such a great scope when it comes to his films, directing with an expansive feeling... Like any great work of art, you can't leave his films without being touched.

I loved Appaloosa. From the simple, honest relationship of the two ""hired guns"" (played with such comfortable ease by Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen) to the complex love interest of Renee Zellweger's Ms. French... I just wanted to figure this puzzle out. How could Ed's character Cole really stand by such a coyote as Ms. French, even after she tries to seduce his best friend? And yet... love is love. There's a great scene where the camera focuses on Ms. Zellweger at the piano, and you can see her conflict, a wild creature in a corset who can't help herself, who can't help but betray those closest to her heart. There's fear and desperation and longing. It's a remarkable moment. And Ed and Viggo are just as delicious in their roles, fitting each other like a pair of comfortable shoes.

The supporting characters are just as wonderful, from the ""society gentlemen,"" eager to rid the town of evil when it suits them, to Jeremy Irons' opportunistic villain, to the other hired guns who were once friends of our heroes but have a face-off nonetheless. It's definitely a comment on that notion of a ""dog eat dog world."" And yet, the real and true love story of friendship against all odds and men who don't see the point of lying, was a lovely theme as well.

This film was so epic and beautiful... it made me want to read the book!",1223942400,,1585,4.496527777777778
3687541,4,B001LM6VTU,"Appaloosa is a cinematographically beautiful Western examining male friendship, and specifically the type of bonding in which one man calls the shots but depends for his strength on a fiercely loyal sidekick. Ed Harris is great in the role of Virgil Cole, the top dog. But it is Viggo Mortensen, in the role of faithful underling Everett Hitch, whose brilliant acting really makes the movie. (His past starring roles have been as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and David Shaw in A Pefect Murder; he was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in Eastern Promises.) This role highlights Mortensen's intelligence; he is a rather eclectic fellow in real life, being a poet, musician, photographer, and painter, in addition to an outspoken opponent of the war in Iraq. His off-screen friendship with director Harris also undoubtedly helped their on-screen energy.

Robert B. Parker, who is better known for his prolific crime writing, wrote the novel. Although emotional rather than sexual, the deep bond between the two gunfighters has homosexual undertones; when Virgil's girlfriend comes on to Everett, Everett tells her, ""No, we're both with him."" Parker's sympathetic portrayal of this issue is a theme running through his novels; both of his sons are openly gay.

The supporting cast is also excellent: Renee Zellweger as Allison French (the woman who tests their friendship) and Jeremy Irons as the intellectual and well-connected bad guy, rancher Randall Bragg.

You don't have to be a fan of Westerns to enjoy this movie; the themes are universal. Watch for the mountain lion in the train scene; it's a breathtaking shot.",1223769600,3,1640,5.089219330855019
3687542,5,B001LM6VTU,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It introduced three themes and developed each one well: a long-standing friendship that abides in crises, the battle between good and evil, and betrayal.

Ed Harris co-writes, directs and stars. He is Virgil Cole. Viggo Mortensen portrays Everett Hitch. Cole and Hitch hire themselves out to restore order in lawless communities. They are something like (a slow motion) Batman and Robin in western garb. Hitch would be Robin armed with a bazooka-like shotgun and always coming up with the erudite vocabulary that Cole can't quite recall. The Cole-Hitch relationship is the friendship theme, done brilliantly.

A reptilian rancher, Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) resides outside of town. He murders three lawmen in the film's opening scenes and leads a gang of cowboy thugs who terrorize Appaloosa, a thirty-horse town in New Mexico Territory--1882. Cole and Hitch are determined to bring Bragg to justice for the murders. This is the good versus evil part.

The betrayal part features Renee Zellweger as Allison French. French gets off the train at Appaloosa armed with a lot of charm and a single dollar. She quickly captures Cole's heart. She, however, likes to share her affections with the multitude. But, as Cole puts it, she bathes every evening and can play the piano. Enough said.

The cinematography is spectacular. This is big sky country, New Mexico style. The sets have a most authentic feel. Every actor performs with great skill. Even a mountain lion manages to capture a sense of wonder.

I feel that any criticism (yes, the pace is sometimes slow) is nitpicking. This is a great movie.",1223769600,,1631,5.07089552238806
3687543,4,B001LM6VTU,"First, the guys look great.  Harris and Mortensen look the part and convey the confident lethality of the for-hire lawmen/gunmen they portray.  These actors can convey the authority that allows you to believe these tough and grizzled characters.  Second, the look of the film--wind-blown, dusty, quaintly authentic in its hard-scrabble town and ranch--is terrific.  Third, the violence when it comes is quick and explosive and underplayed in a more naturalistic, non-exploitive, fashion...giving it a semi-realistic consequence.  Lastly, the by-play between the two leads is relaxed and convincing.

The story thread is fairly simple, the outsider lawmen going against the powerful rancher.  Complications are introduced with the Renee Zellweger character upsetting the bond of the two partners, and some nice twists of plot are provided along the way.

A nifty Western with some decided differences, this is not an action movie, but a rather subtle examination of male friendship changed by the desire and need for the female, the need for and price of law and order, and the upholding and exploitation of community.  Ed Harris has done a nice job in delivering a Western that might be a bit too laid-back and laconic for some, but has very good acting and terse and salty dialogue and a terrific look to recommend it.",1223683200,2,1319,5.183962264150943
3687544,5,B001LM6VTU,"Virgil Cole (Harris) and Everett Hitch (Mortensen) are a pair of traveling lawmen for hire.  When they arrive at the town of Appaloosa, the town fathers are more than willing to pay the price and accept that Cole IS the law.  They're under the thumb of rich rancher, Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) who shot their former sheriff in cold blood.

They get a break in the case when a young former hand of Bragg's agrees to testify.  That happens about the time when the widow, Allie French (Renee Zellweger) comes in on the train.

Allie complicates matters a lot.  As Hitch so eloquently puts it, ""she wants to be with the herd stallion and there can only be one of those at a time."" Cole, who claims to not have feelings, actually does care for French.  She's not like any woman he's ever been with, she's clean, she's got good manners, etc.

""Appaloosa"" has all the elements of a great Western, a little romance, some realistic gun play, excellent characterization, great scenery (principal film site Austin, Texas) and the typical western sense of humor.  For example, when a gun battle gets both men injured, Hitch says, ""That was quick.""  Cole's response, ""Yeah, everybody could shoot.""

Clearly, Harris and Mortensen had a lot of fun making this film.  These two are friends in real life and this project was a labor of love for Harris who said in an interview that he's a fan of the author of ""Appaloosa,"" Robert Parker.  He usually reads the detective novels, but picked up the Western because he liked the cover and that's how the movie came to be.

If you enjoyed ""Pale Rider"" and ""Unforgiven,"" this is a film you'll probably want to see.  The ""R"" rating is for a little language, small nudity, and violence, but both my husband and I have seen a lot worse on broadcast television.

Don't get me wrong: on a whole I loved the movie but I would feel amiss if I didn't bring up the following points. As I was sitting through the film I noticed several awkward moments. Some of these came through weak acting (mostly speaking roles by the thugs that worked for Jeremy Irons), a few over lit or underexposed scenes (one in particular with Ed Harris standing in the swinging doors of the Hotel... and the an earlier one of the main street in town), Timothy Spall's over the top character seemed to be trying too hard: (I love Timothy Spaul; his greatest role in my mind was in Poliakoff's ""Shooting the Past""; he is a brilliant actor and his talents are wasted in these bit parts in American films), Jeremy Irons wrestling with his american accent"", one white haired gentleman in a black suit and top hat seemed to be walking up the boardwalk in the town in every second scene, and finally... some pregnant pauses in the dialogue leaving the audience hanging. Again; don't get me wrong; I liked the movie but constructive criticism is good. I liken this directing effort by Ed Harris to that of Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" which also had several scenes not lit as well as they could have been. Sure I've been picky here but that is what reviews are for.

3687547,4,B001LM6VTU,"Lately, the westerns that have come out have all been far more burdened with an undercurrent of sadness then westerns of the past.  They also delve more into the psychology of their characters.  Long gone are the days when good guys could just be good because they were good people.  Now good guys have to carry a burden of sadness or a dark secret or a hidden ""bad side.""  The bad guys also must have some baggage.  As movie-goers, we no longer accept (particularly in our dramas) simple tales of black & white.

I'm thinking of recent efforts staring with UNFORGIVEN, and following through with works like OPEN RANGE, 3:10 TO YUMA, even the Australian THE PROPOSITION.  Now comes APPALOOSA, starring, directed by and co-written by Ed Harris.  It , too, is ""fraught"" with undercurrents.

You're probably now thinking that I don't like this trend.  You couldn't be more wrong.  What westerns can do, more than any other genre right now, is show us how nothing is quite black & white anymore.  In UNFORGIVEN, for example, our ""heroes"" are men weary as heck from always relying on their guns.  They've tried to turn to more placid lives, only to find that the world of violence and killing is all they are suited for.  And the ""bad"" sheriff, played by Gene Hackman, is actually capable at delivering some sense of order to his town.  It's a ""complex"" story told in a genre that relies more on archetypes and formula than anything other than perhaps the sports-underdog genre.

APPALOOSA tells the story of another Western town, where the business leaders are under a reign of terror from local rancher and all-around bad guy Jeremy Irons.  Irons has killed the local marshal, so the town-leaders employ famous ""marshal for hire"" Ed Harris, who shows up along with his long-time deputy, Viggo Mortensen.  Harris is made the new marshal, and given pretty much unlimited power to do what it takes to clean up.

This part of the plot is not actually terribly interesting.  It is done well, but there are no glorious shoot-out scenes.  The violence (and there's enough) is fast, brutal and blunt.  But most of the time, Mortensen & Harris spend a lot of time sitting around with their guns, just watching for the bad guys.  This builds tension, and allows for some nice camera-work and some fun dialogue between Harris and Mortensen.  But if there were nothing else to the film, it would be a failure.

However, as with any good western, you've got to have a lady.  In this case, that lady is played by Renee Zellweger, a woman of limited means who comes to town and immediately captures the fancy of Harris.  While this portion of the movie goes down some very original, surprising and even complex places...I will tell you no more, because I'm not sure how I could without spoiling the fun.  Zellweger's character simply shakes up what all these characters think they know...and also defies our expectations of how her relationship with Harris, Mortensen & Irons will play out.

And as you might expect in a movie directed by a laconic, easy-going actor like Ed Harris, the actors are given plenty of room to ""act.""  It's all very low-key, (almost minimalist for Harris and Mortensen), it also very well done.

Irons has the most clich&eacute;d character.  He lives up the billing of the ""bad guy""...but as you might expect, he brings his usual oily smoothness to the part.  What he also brings is a touch of indignation.  He honestly seems to think that he's not such a bad guy...he's just a rancher determined to run his business.  We'd almost buy it, if we hadn't seen some of the other stuff he's capable of.  Irons also looks great in the part...western garb seems to suit him.

Zellweger gets a character full of surprising complexity to try on for size, and she mostly acquits herself well.  She's becoming so gaunt now that her eyes have nearly disappeared, and she can't quite get by on simply looking cute and spunky anymore.  But the film requires more of her, and she delivers.  She's not afraid to be unlikable when called for, and that is not something we've seen much from her before.  It was a good choice for her because she gets to stretch just a bit, but not completely out of her comfort zone.

Harris does a very nice job as well.  As a lawman/gun-for-hire, his character is extremely self-assured, competent, and merciless.  But when his heart is captured by a lady for the first time in his life, we see his internal struggle to adjust himself to the idea of trying to make another person happy.  This is all done with small gestures and a minimal of talking...but Harris lets us see everything clearly.  Director Harris has also made actor Harris as handsome and well-dressed as he possibly could be!  Is there any other actor working today who feels more ""American?""

Most interesting of all may be Viggo Mortensen.  He's the guy who is the ""faithful companion"" to the more charismatic Harris.  He carries the big gun, he does what he is told and he knows when to speak and when to keep quiet.  His needs appear to be simple, and his love for his boss is quite evident (just to be clear, this is the ""love"" between friends).  Yet we can also tell that he sees the dynamics of things more clearly than Harris.  He understands much sooner and much more deeply just what Zellweger wants and needs.  And ultimately, he's willing to risk death to help things work out.  His performance also twinkles ever so slightly with good humor, and he and Harris have an easy chemistry that makes us believe these two men have been riding and killing together for a long time.  They are beyond thinking if they trust each other...they are, when it comes to shooting and law-making, at least, almost operating as one.  (One down note:  Mortensen has to deliver some voice-over narration at the very beginning and end of the film.  This device feels cheap and unneeded.)  Oh, and since I dwelled on everyone else's appearance (something I seldom do), Mortensen looks great as well, except he's given a beard the looks dreadful when filmed from the side.

APPALOOSA doesn't really break any new ground in the genre.  But it is still very entertaining, full of surprises and tells a good story.  It has humble aspirations, and fills them nicely.  You could certainly do far, far worse for two hours of entertainment.",1223424000,,6316,4.679382379654859
