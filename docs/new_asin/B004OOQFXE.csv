8437250,5,B004OOQFXE,"The episodes are long (about 40-45 min each) and there is a lot of talking, but the story is great and there's a lot of action for talking too :)

I wouldn't let children under 10 or 12 watch this - depending on if they are used to violence and a bit of joke intended perversion. It's your call.
But I would advise you experience this once.

If you like this work I would advise checking out the other Monogatari series (Bakemonogatari, Nekomonogatari etc.)",1475280000,,457,4.428571428571429
8437251,4,B004OOQFXE,"This is a bawdy screwball comedy that ALMOST goes by the numbers, but there is enough going on here that I think it is worth your time.  After seeing it, I believe you will agree.",1425168000,2,179,4.114285714285714
8437252,4,B004OOQFXE,"Wonderfully rendered, this title tells an eccentric story of a military stratagist who searches for one of the great warriors of past war. She comes to an island were the warrior had been exiled, only to find has grown children.
The son is extremely naive having spent his entire life in seclusion with his somewhat cryptic sister. The son is easily talked into accompanying the strategist,(so she can gain favour with the Shogun. The series follows thier voyages and the odd turns that it takes.  Well worth a watch.",1403222400,,517,4.808988764044944

8437254,5,B004OOQFXE,I was surprised on how hooked I became on this anime every time I watch it I have to watch the whole series. This  anime  makes making bread to be really exciting and funny. The reactions are hilarious. I just wish I could download it for my kindle HD then I would be all set.,1365724800,,276,4.0
8437255,5,B004OOQFXE,"An interesting story combined with a unique art style and often stunning animation, Katanagatari is one of the few series that is a jack of all trades, master of many and above average at the rest.  While it certainly isn't for children, I wouldn't list that as a fault.",1310515200,7,270,4.510204081632653
8437256,5,B004OOQFXE,"Katanagatari is the result of talented people defying convention to the fullest. As an anime, it's smarter, sharper, and more beautiful than most other animes out there. As a story, it's unparalleled. Expectations are frequently built up using common anime tropes, only to have things play out in delightfully clever (and sometimes brutal) ways that keep the viewer astounded, guessing, and entranced.

Don't watch this series if you're just looking for another Naruto. Katanagatari is above that. Way above. It's a work of art that deserves to be appreciated like a fine painting that just may leave you completely speechless. It is a modern classic.",1305504000,11,651,5.2
8437257,1,B004OOQFXE,"SPOILERS. Be VERY careful with this series. The heroine, Togame, is gunned down and killed in episode 11, and dies in a pool of blood. If your perversions run to watching the sadistic murder of very pretty girls, you'll LOVE ""Katanagatari"" but otherwise -- well, not likely.

""Katanagatari"" is emphatically NOT -- repeat, NOT, NOT, NOT -- for children. Up to the end, ""Katanagatari"" appears -- but only appears! -- to be a romantic action comedy, with a joking romantic relationship between Togame and the warrior Shichika as they search for semi-magical swords made by a mysterious swordsmith (the title ""Katanagatari"" means ""sword story"") and have sometimes funny, sometimes bloody adventures with assassins, ninjas, scheming villains, and a pretty but quite unfriendly Princess. Slowly an underlying theme of sadistic murder comes to the forefront of the story -- Shichika has killed his sister in cold blood in an earlier episode -- until finally Togame herself is killed by one of the servants of the Princess. Shichika himself does not die, and in the last episode the Princess throws herself romantically at him. He isn't interested and walks off, with the series ending with the Princess, alive and well, chasing after Shichika.

None of this is foreshadowed in the animation or narrative. In fact, the animation is first-rate -- elegant and stylish. The increasingly close and loving relationship between Togame and Shichika is central to the first 10 episodes, with romantic interludes and growing love as Togame and Shichika plan their future together. In retrospect, these scenes are designed to make us believe that the story will have a happy ending. Everything soothes our suspicions and we have no reason at all to suspect that the end will be graphically depicted sadistic murder. Children will be particularly vulnerable to the story because it is very pretty and quite amusing, with a lot of slapstick, sometimes silly comedy.

But at root ""Katanagatari"" is a genuinely nasty piece of work. The nastiness is not redeemed by even a suggestion that Togame deserves to die; she does not.

So, be warned. This show has some genuinely perverted surprises. And -- once again! -- it is NOT, NOT, NOT for children.

(Note added later. I fixed a misspelling brought to my attention by a commentator, whom I thank.)",1304294400,2,2324,5.057441253263708
