8173110,1,B000MVU6JW,Although this was a great series/movie the subtitles were HORRIBLE. There was really no sense in putting subtitles on this if it didn't even match what the person was saying. My mother is from japan and she said the subtitles were horrible as well. Unless they fix that problem I would suggest finding someone who is selling a dvd that has better English subtitles on it.,1463184000,,371,4.636363636363637

8173112,4,B000MVU6JW,"This Dorama is great, apart from being inspired in a real story, (that just makes it more emotive and great), doesn't leave you feeling down. It teaches you to appreciate more the things that really matter and don't be so unnaware of the people that sorrounds you . It just teaches you to never lose hope, no matter what.",1345075200,,321,4.4576271186440675
8173113,3,B000MVU6JW,"Ichi Litre No Namida is an awesome series!
I was happy to recieve it promptly.

Having said that I was suprised to find only 2 discs seeing that it said it is a 3 DVD Digipak.  Also the discs are slightly oversized and unlike anyother DVD I've played in my player,  make noises while spinning.

Plays fine however",1320105600,,313,4.344827586206897
8173114,5,B000MVU6JW,"Received this purchase very quickly and it is as described. I haven't had a chance to watch the DVD yet as I am waiting to share it with friends. It is the saddest, by most inspiring movies that I have ever seen. I cried more than a liter of tears.",1315440000,,248,3.98
8173115,1,B000MVU6JW,"When I bought this 3 DVD set, I was under the impression that ENGLISH SUBTITLES were included. And they were, but they were horrible!  The subtitles first look horrible and cheap in some odd COLOR on the screen!  Then, they are incorrect and even hard to understand!  When you read it, you still can't understand what it going on.

Because, I had already seen the show, I was able to tell what was being said most of the time, but in the end, I ended up throwing it out in disgust....

So, if you are not fluent in Japanese, don't bother buying this DVD set. Save your money for something else.",1315353600,,594,4.315315315315315
8173116,5,B000MVU6JW,"This is a very moving drama based on a true story of a girls diary. The girl is diagnosed with Spinal muscular atrophy at the age of 15, a disease that today still does not have a cure. Be prepared to cry your eyes out in each episode. This series comprises of 11 total episodes and is WELL worth your time. This series shows how precious life really is.",1283385600,4,354,4.144927536231884
