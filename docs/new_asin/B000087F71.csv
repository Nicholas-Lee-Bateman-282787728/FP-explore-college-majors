7979662,5,B000087F71,"Mudhoney is my all-time favorite exploitation film. It's like an explosion of trash but in a good way. Pretty women, raging hillbillies, religion-fueled hysteria, this flick's got it all. I like Faster Pussycat a lot but this is Russ Meyers' best.",1422057600,,247,5.048780487804878
7979663,5,B000087F71,"Another of the four great RUSS MEYER films. The others being ""FASTER PUSSYCAT KILL.....KILL,""MOTOR PSYCHO"" & BENEATH THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS"",which the late ROGER EBERT co-wrote. GREAT soundtrack. Although ""LORNA""isn't too bad. Sadly,the rest are mostly just big breast films with horrible,if not almost nonexistant plots,sorry RUSS.",1405900800,,333,5.958333333333333

7979665,4,B000087F71,"1964 and 1965 were busy years for Russ Meyer. This was the heart of his gothic period and he made four films in the two year period. Mudhoney along with Faster, Pussycat Kill! Kill! were the best examples of this period. For Mudhoney he essentially reunited the stars of Lorna for an intense gothic piece about a dysfunctional family living in Spooner, Missouri.

In this Depression-era tale, Calif McKinney (John Furlong) is traveling from Michigan to California and stops in Spooner, Missouri, where Lute Wade (Stuart Lancaster) hires McKinney for odd jobs. McKinney gets involved with Wade's niece, Hannah Brenshaw (Antoinette Christiani). She is married to Sidney (Hal Hopper), a wife-beating drunk who hopes to inherit his uncle-in-law's money. Sidney and an eccentric preacher named Brother Hanson (Frank Bolger) plot against McKinney, who finds it difficult to conceal his mysterious past and his growing affection for Sidney's wife. The film culminates in one of Meyer's most intense evocations of mob justice.

This is an important film in the Meyer canon and is equally as good as some of his more well known films of the period. Shot in a moody black and white Meyer helps the audience feel the dusty desperation of the times. There are notable performances by Hal Hopper and Stuart Lancaster who would become staples in later Meyer films.

This is probably the best example of Meyer's gothic period and is well worth seeking out.",1337904000,,1441,5.046218487394958
7979666,3,B000087F71,"Lordy, what a lark!  Thar's a toothless, cacklin' crone of an ex-whore who's pimpin' her busty, bleach-blonde gals, a smarmy, low-down lout who's tryin' to pork ever' purty thang in sight, a hellfire 'n' brimstone spoutin' preacherman, upright womenfolk 'n' a farm in peril, 'n' a strangerman strivin' to straighten it all out!  The actin' aint the bestest, 'n' the directin's kindly overwrought, but, lawsy, it's a hoot!  ('N' the hootERS is sometimes bare 'n' bouncin'!)  All in all, it's a middlin' good tale!",1253318400,6,512,5.059523809523809
7979667,5,B000087F71,"Never before has a film been so alive,so emotional,so perfect. One of Meyer's best,filled with great acting,creative characters and personal style. To me,his film is Faulkner in the cinematic form.",947030400,9,197,5.6
7979668,4,B000087F71,"The second installment in Russ Meyer's series in Rural Dramas is one of his best: a well-shot, entertaining explitation piece which seems to get better with each viewing. An ex-prisoner find work (and sex) at a farm  owned by Stewart Lancaster (who we all remember from FASTER, PUSSYCAT!  KILL! KILL!) and his niece played by Antoinette Cristiani who is married to  alchaholic sleazebag, Hal Hopper (LORNA). Even Russ Meyer himself has a  very small part as someone in the crowd during Hal Hopper's execution at  the end. Keep a lookout for this underated Russ Meyer flick because it's  quite rare. Anyone reading this review from Australia can find this video  at FASTER, PUSSYCAT! in NSW or at POLYESTER in VIC.",945648000,12,713,4.891666666666667
