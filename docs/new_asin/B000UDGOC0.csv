2920246,4,B000UDGOC0,"Don't come to this movie expecting a horror movie, or even a straight forward vampire movie. What we've got here is a Vampire Noir. We've got a reporter who was converted to a vampire against her will and a hard drinking detective on her trail. The plot unfolds slowly over two hours with lots of the noir elements in place: flashbacks, violence, and revenge.
If that sounds like your cup of tea, this is definitely recommended. If you are looking for more straight forward vampire thrills, it might be a good idea to avoid this little gem.",1192233600,7,540,4.577319587628866

2920267,4,B000UDGOC0,"How many great movies have we seen,  that had this beautiful actress in it? At least a half-dozen, right? Miss Liu always brings something special to any movie she plays in. What would Kill Bill have been like without her? Or Charlie's Angels?

  Liu is a fantastic co star, playing with some of the reqlly great actresses and actors, Mel Gibson, James Kahn, Jackie Chan, and Owen Wilson. I'm a big fan of hers, and always have been, so I went on and gave her four stars for this low budget film in which she plays the lead. Okay it wasn't a blockbuster, but I think she did her part very well.
  In this tale of revenge, Liu plays as a reanimated woman that brings righteous retribution down on the people that murdered her. Waking up in a morgue three days after her demise, she BLASTS her way out of a refrigerated tomb. The sweet and innocent person that she was before her murder is now, long gone. If you've never seen this classic before, I would highly recommend that you do so, I've watched it at least three or four times since it came out in the mid nineties. so, the next time your searching for something decent to stream, give this one a try. I would suggest getting SD, because HD was not perfected yet at the time; it was very expensive to own a device that could play HD, and the budget RISE had to work with did not have the super digital powers that ...well...almost EVERYTHING is shot in now.
  So, in a nutshell, Miss Lucy takes a limited situation and does a decent job. Bravo Miss Lucy!! Oh, and if you ever decide that you don't want to be in the Hollywood Hills anymore, I would be most happy, and honored to enlighten you about life in the peace and beauty of the hills of Mammoth Cave Kentucky!",1463184000,2,1721,4.306501547987616

While the writer of this movie clearly has never seen, read, nor heard about any other vampire movies... I liked the new idea that a vampire needed a special ring thing to kill people. It's dumb... but, original!

The story was very ""uninvolved"" with the actual movie. There was a great story about a ""father and daughter"" that gets lost in the sauce as other ""very random"" stories are both quickly introduced and forgotten.

There might have been a ""rape"" scene in the movie. That is unclear due to unintentional ambiguity as the editing is very sloppy!

2920280,5,B000UDGOC0,"First the review of the streaming version. One of my favorite vampire movies. Certainly a different take than most vampire movies. Lucy Liu is great in this role. As is Michael Chiklis. One thing I will reveal is that in this film the vampires have no extended canine teeth but do have a lust for human blood and the power of mesmerism. Now a review of the extended version on disc that I just received. The extended/unrated version is completely different from the 97 minute theatrical version, there are some scenes that are in one version and not the other. The unrated version has longer conversations, and the timeline is not as linear as in the theatrical version, and it is sometimes difficult to tell when there is a flashback. these differences make for a much different movie experience.",1434153600,,797,4.741007194244604

2920291,2,B000UDGOC0,"This so-so vamp flick from the producers of The Grudge offers a not-so-original plotline with none of the supernatural perks of underworld thugs.

Sadie Blake (Lucy Liu) is a reporter on the rise. She gets her first cover story by interviewing goth wannabes who drink blood shakes and talk about the life-everlasting as a vamp.

Thing is, they are real. And after her story hits the stands, vampire king Bishop wants her head. He murders Sadies photographer friend, then kills her. He and his partner in crime, played by the always lovely Carla Gugino, eat her flesh, drink her blood and rape her while she dies.

Sadie wakes up in the morgue and discovers she has no reflection. Shes become one of them. Armed with a crossbow, she sets out to murder Bishop for making her what she so despises, and gets some help from unlikely allies along the way  including a cop grieving his murdered daughter.

The vamps in Rise weren't extraordinary. They don't have night vision. They don't have super strength. They aren't even that interesting, just sick. Sex and violence is their game   without any of the cool blood-sucking lore we see in vampire novels by Laurel K. Hamilton or in flicks like Underworld. They just drink blood, eat flesh, have sex and live long. Not really that interesting, if you ask me. Add in some superpowers, and Im totally there. Maybe I just expect too much because Ive read and seen so many vampire novels and movies. I don't know. I thought it was interesting that they were killed with just a plain ol bow and arrow  anywhere on the body. What, no silver-pointed tip? No Holy Water or garlic bombs?

Sadie is an interesting character, even if her plotline is overdone. She was an incredibly active young woman, full of life B.U.  Before Undead. But when we first meet her, she is emotionless, speaks in a near whisper, and doesnt hesitate to use any means necessary to kill those on the way to finding Bishop. One thing that really got me was Sadies character dressing her wounds. Hello, you regenerate. Why bother? I think writers used that a segue to get grieving cop on Sadies tail. Interesting thing about that, though, is that they said she was caught on tape purchasing the items at a store, and they also got a partial license plate from surveillance cameras. She doesnt have a reflection. I assume these were digital cameras, the use of which has become a mainstay in mainstream vamp novels and TV shows like Moonlight where characters want to be on film once again for whatever reason. (This was cool at first, but now it seems like an easy out to get a story where writers want it to go  which is fine some of the time, but not all of the time.)

There is a really bad scene of Lucy Liu crying when she sees her beheaded photographer friend. I mean, this was really bad. It would have been better to have a stand in for it.

The scenes with grieving cop, played by Michael Chiklis, are kind of stupid. I liked the scenes with just him, where hes dreaming about his dead daughter. But once he tracks down Sadie thinking she may be his daughters killer  it gets just too dumb. The acting is good, the scenes are just blah. There is no build up to the cop believing in vampires. He tries to kill Sadie, she doesnt die, and, after seeing that she doesnt have a reflection, he believes. It just doesnt work. We get that hes a man on the edge after finding his daughters body in a dumpster, but he should have already been researching vamps and other deaths like his daughters. He is onto something when hes trying to find Robin Hood  the police nickname for Sadie as she kills off the vamps that led to her undeadedness  but hes not armed with the folklore I expected. Maybe he suspects, maybe not. Thats not clear and more development was needed there.

This film mimics the popular trilogy Blade  but without the moves and plot twists. Lius character as a sort of female Blade, sans cool toys and brains. (But shes got the Death Stare down.) Shes not a planner. Shes more of an Anita Blake, charging in for the kill, but without the planning skills of the Wesley Snipes character. And, as I figured, directors have left this open to be a series  though they don't really explain how it is that Sadie cant die while the other vamps do.

The DVD includes behind the scenes features (pretty cool), a storyboard to screen feature, and about a half hour of never-before-seen footage.",1423267200,,4409,4.5359394703657

2920312,2,B000UDGOC0,"I get the distinct feeling that ""Rise: Blood Hunter"" was trying to be a different kind of vampire movie. The vampires don't have fangs (they use little knives to cut throats), they don't have superhuman strength, and the ""V"" word is never used.

So why, why, WHY did they choose to embrace the most cliched of vampire plots, namely ""I Hate You, Vampire Dad""?

In its desperate rush to be different, ""Rise: Blood Hunter"" ends up being oddly familiar -- the story of a vampire-hunting vampire who wants to kill other vampires, especially the ones who made her a vampire. Think ""Blade,"" but without the kinetic action scenes or the vampires who are actually scary. Lucy Liu and Michael Chiklis are the only bright spots here, giving performances too good for the movie they're in.

Sadie Blake (Liu) is an up-and-coming journalist who has been investigating an underground Goth party scene. But when one of her sources is found dead, she investigates a mysterious address that her tech nerd friend unearthed for her -- and finds a vampire cult who very much do not want her to expose them. Big shock: they rape and murder her, and several hours later, she reawakens in a morgue drawer as a vampire.

At first, Sadie is unable to control her lust for human blood, but is disgusted by herself. After wandering into a homeless shelter and killing an old man, she tries to kill herself. Instead, she is trained by a vampiric mentor in how to hunt other vampires with a teeny tiny crossbow.

So she goes on a little road trip, tracking down the members of the vampire cult, with their leader Bishop (James D'Arcy) as her main goal. But she runs into the grieving Detective Rawlins (Michael Chiklis), whose daughter was murdered by the cult. He mistakenly believes that Sadie had something to do with her death -- but once he learns the truth, he becomes an important ally.

""Rise: Blood Hunter"" tries really, REALLY hard to avoid the cliched trappings of other vampire stories... but unfortunately it doesn't dodge the PLOT cliches. The brooding tortured vampire, the use of medieval weapons, ""I Hate You Vampire Dad"" and a secret vampire cult -- all of these are things we've seen before, but usually done better. And most strikingly, it has a post-""Blade"" vampire-hunting vampire who fights her lust for blood while also slaying the undead.

Admittedly, none of this makes the movie BAD, just tiresomely predictable. What makes it bad is the sluggish pace, with Sadie meandering around and killing people in gory, mildly-depressing ways. The movie is actually at its best before we encounter the vampires -- but once we know what they are, it's just Sadie killing this person or that person, angsting and moving on.

The only kill that is particularly memorable is when she chitchats with Bishop's lover before shooting her. Even then, it's mostly the woman nattering about what a wonderful unique snowflake Sadie is, while Sadie sits there looking intensely bored. And if it's meant to evoke some kind of pity for this ageless vampire who no longer cares if she dies... it's difficult to care when you consider that the woman is a rapist, murderer and necrophiliac.

It also has a very disjointed beginning -- it's a scene from later in Sadie's quest, where she picks up a prostitute to bribe some information from another vampire. It doesn't fit neatly anywhere in the movie, and seems to exist just to show breasts as soon as possible.

Most of the actors are giving performances that are much too good for the movie they're in -- Liu most plays Sadie as emotionally numb and suicidal, with moments of raw vulnerability, while Chiklis is pretty heartbreaking as a man desperate to avenge his daughter. James D'Arcy is given little to work with -- Bishop is just a mustache-twirling villain -- but he wrings what unblinking creepiness he can from the role.

It tries to be unique, but the sluggish ""Rise: Blood Hunter"" falls into the post-""Blade"" cliches of vampire-action movies. The only redeeming part is the main trio of actors.",1401062400,2,4028,4.797979797979798

I am happy to report that this Blu Ray is region free and plays on my Sony region A player here in the United States.  Also,  the description lists the language as French, but upon loading the disc you able to select English or French menus and the audio tracks are offered in English 2.0 and 5.1.

The video, as mentioned, does play on USA Blu-Ray players and is formatted to fit a 16x9 screen edge to edge.  This is a crop from the original 240:1 in theaters, which can be had on the Unrated DVD, but hey it makes for a great viewing experience.  I have seen both and the Blu Ray has much better video quality than up-converting the Unrated DVD, if you can live with the 16x9 crop, which I can but some cannot.

Quality is great, image is great, audio is great, story boards are great, cast is great and the movie is great.  AAA+++ if you are a Vampire, Lucy Liu or Michael Chiklis fan.

Rise: Blood Hunter on Blu Ray that you can watch on your American region A player.  Woo hoo!",1383264000,5,1157,4.768844221105527

More movies could use more edge, imo.  I'd go so far as to say, it's better (stronger story, good characters, good acting, interesting directing, good set design, etc.) than a lot of movies with bigger budgets (say the Twilight series or Transformers series).
The story follows a reporter who ends up looking too deeply into the wrong story, and gets found out by some vampires.  Well, she wants to hunt down the vampires, and seek some justice, not only for herself but other people they have harmed.
It was a good story, solid plot and characters that had me interested in watching.  After all, who doesn't like a warrior chick seeking revenge? And good directing too, which is always nice to see for a change.  Nice set design, adding to the weight of the dark scenes.
A good movie to watch on a cold night, snuggled up in bed with some hot chocolate or tea. ;)
I'd watch this movie again, and buy it for my collection.",1381622400,2,1098,4.348039215686274

2920321,4,B000UDGOC0,"This was the second movie that I watched in less than 24hrs. that surprised me with its genre make over. The first was Ginger Snaps with its girl powered werewolf (highly recommend) and now this new twist to the vampire genre.

Blood Hunter for me rises way above the B movie status that its been given for very obvious reasons that separate the two catagories ( budget, writing, acting, direction, cast, locations, props and so on) and in every one of those catagories this movie excels.  The acting is very good from Liu (Sadie Blake) to the bit parts played by the lesser known cast members. The directors use of locations, lighting and color schemes combined with his working with his cast to extract good performances is visible in each and every scene in the movie. The dimly luminated scenes add a nice dose of the heebie jeebies and in a few scenes add a bit of eroticism without the scenes being to dark to view.

Lucy Liu's character is not your everyday garden variety of vampire and neither are the vampires that she is after for raping and killing her. They are a different sub species of vampires that don't seem to be able to fly or possess super strengh nor do the have fangs. They are able to survive out of doors in the daylight without dying, but it is uncomfortable and they need to wear sunglasses for eye protection.

After Sadie escapes from a cadaver vault in the LA county morgue she wanders around unsure of what happened to her and what her body is telling her. She is obducted by Auturo (Julio Mechoso) an alchemist who informs her of who and what she has become. This part of the movie reminds me of two movies/tv shows the Karate Kid and Kung Fu where Larusso (Macchio) is instructed by Miyogi (Morita) and in Kung Fu Caine (Carradine) is instructed by Master Po (Luke). Anyway, back to Sadie. I think you get the picture of how Auturo instructs and guides her on her quest for revenge.

Very good movie thats well worth the time. 4 stars

So, my view reflects  only one who is not customarily a horror, vampire, etc. movie buff. With that  preliminary, count or discount from your perspective when I say, I found this film quite entertaining, well worth the two hours spent on it, without being overly disgusting in achieving its effects (as I note is a characteristic of some of the better as well as some of the worst in the genre). A number of roles were well played and the lead cast the kind of spell which is part acting, part ""IT"" as it used to be called. Since I am not at all sure what the internal logic of such films generally is, I can't make a comparative judgment. While I found logical plot flaws, frankly, I didn't care.

2920340,2,B000UDGOC0,"Lucy Liu makes a very attractive looking corpse. Unfortunately, her dainty, kick-ass hotness isn't enough to save Rise: Blood Hunter from its needlessly convoluted plot and holes in logic big enough to drive a bus through. The film is dark and gritty, everything washed in shadows and blues to remind us that we are now in no man's land where vampires are sadistic but not quite equipped to deal with their cravings, fangless as they are. The vampires make an appropriately bloody mess of their meals, leaving body parts strewn across crime scenes, aided by various accoutrement to make up for what nature failed to give them.

Rise: Blood Hunter remains faithful to vampire lore only moderately, which really isn't such a problem, but the fact that the movie is bloody boring to boot makes it par for the course in the reinvention of the genre that seems underway. Everyone wants to shake things up, but go too far or not far enough.

Sadie Blake as our inquisitive girl reporter, happy-go-lucky and clueless about the darkest part of the city's underbelly goes from flowered skirts and denim jackets to a post-transformation ensemble of skin tight jeans and a cheeky haircut that shouts, I am a New Woman, Beware! Trained by a semi-mystic guru in the arts of killing vampires, Sadie dispatches her enemies (in this case the pack of fiends who turned her, so it's your standard revenge plot) with laughable ease. Michael Chiklis, our brave and emotionally wounded detective, gums up the works for her just a bit, but is almost a non-entity, popping up randomly and not doing much except pissing the other cops off.

There's a lot of unresolved plot elements, including the true motives of Sadie's benefactor, and fellow vampire, Arturo. But I suppose they're leaving all of that for a direct-to-DVD sequel seeing as how Sadie,begging to die and stabbed through the heart (we assume) with a silver crossbow bolt by Detective Rawlins busts out of the morgue for the second time just before the credits roll.

Michael Chiklis (Fantastic 4, The Shield, & The Commish) was great as an alcholic, revenge seeking detective who's daughter get's turned by the same group.

  ""Rise: Blood Hunter"" is an erotically charged, action packed horror film in the tradition of ""Blade.""  It is well paced with plenty of death scenes and gory bloodletting.  Fortunately, the gore does not overwhelm the plot.  It is fascinating to watch Lucy Liu's acting skills as she transforms from law abiding citizen to bloodthirsty huntress.  We sympathize with her plight as she struggles with the morality issue of having to kill innocents in order to remain well fed and strong for the hunt.

  Sony Pictures has done an excellent job with the DVD package.  Most interesting are the ""behind the scenes"" featurettes.  They are short, interesting and very enjoyable; they didn't drag on and on until they became boring.  The featurettes contained on-location interviews with the cast and crew who were openly discussing the stunts, makeup and sensuality of the film.  The DVD is also loaded with theatrical trailers for other horror films such as ""Resident Evil: Extinction,"" ""Boogey Man 2,"" ""Pumpkinhead 4: Blood Feud,"" ""Hostel Part II,"" and ""Kaw.""

All I can say is, that's two hours of my life that I'll never get back. (Or maybe it just felt like two hours; Amazon's listing puts the run time at 94 minutes, oy.)

Take note of the above synopsis, since it takes over an hour of this two hour movie for the above to become fully apparent. In theory, ""Rise"" sounds like a good idea for a movie - a vampire revenge story. However, the execution of this film is so muddled and barely coherent that I am not surprised that this movie ended up going straight to DVD in Australia.

""Rise"" makes use of a non-linear story line, supposedly to make the story more ""interesting"", but often it is so hard to tell what the sequence of events is and the end result is highly confusing. To add to this, none of the characters seem to have any personality at all. Even Liu, who is usually very effective at playing women with bad attitudes (as she did in ""Ally McBeal"" and ""Kill Bill""), seems to be sleep-walking through this movie and the supposed ""relationship"" between Liu's character and a police detective (played by Michael Chiklis) is laughable. At one point Liu makes some comment to the detective to the effect that she know that he is interested in her. This took me completely by surprise, since whenever Chiklis and Liu were together in the same room, they both looked thoroughly bored. Finally, the film is just plain trashy. Within the first five minutes of the film, we encounter a naked woman hanging upside down in a cage (maybe that's your thing, but it's not mine), and the film doesn't improve much from there. The final shot leaves this film open to a sequel, which is obviously wishful thinking on the part of the film-makers, since I seriously doubt that anyone would want to see any more of this.",1230681600,,1703,4.562091503267974

BLOOD HUNTER

This was the second vampire film from Sam Raimi's and Rob Tapert's Ghost House Pictures, the first of course being ""30 Days of Night"". This one right here stars Lucy Liu and sadly even with her upside down and naked this does not come close to being as good as ""30 Days of Night"". Not to say that this film is a bad film or doesn't have its moments, because it is worth a watch if you rent it or something. I think the main problem with this film is that it is hard to follow and tries too hard to be such. I know that sounds weird but I think they went for that feeling and just didn't get it to come off as well as they planed. The first half of this film falls into that path and suffers because of it, but to its credit the last half really picks up. The film is still somewhat predictable though and that brings the tension of the film down.

Sadie Blake [Liu] is a reporter that wakes up dead and in a morgue, and she wakes up here a lot through out the film which leads me to believe she can't get a thing accomplished. It turns out she is now a member of the undead under belly of the city and is on a mission to kill off those who are like her. If you are thinking this sounds like a female Blade movie you are not to far off, she even enlists the help of a weapons maker to craft some specialty items for her. Liu is great in the role that she is given and brings the character to life [time after time LOL {trust me you will get it after viewing}], not really surprised by that. James D'Arcy is just as good in his role as Bishop; he is actually one of the most interesting characters in the film. Michael Chiklis who seems a little over the top at times creates some of the best scenes in the film and that over the top feeling you get adds to the film in a positive way.

Writer/director Sebastian Gutierrez does a pretty good job with this film; I think he got a little over ambitious. Not exactly sure if his script was the problem or his direction but if I had to guess I would say the script was too ambitious. I think if the screenplay would have been worked on a little more the film may have been better. The main problem I had with this movie was it seemed like it wanted to take the vampire genre into a whole new direction but at the same time seemed like it wanted to be a Quentin Tarantino film. When you see it you will know what I mean, and no I am not just talking about the cuts between times in this. Another problem with this flick is at times you may loose interest on what is going on in the film, not exactly boring just predictable.

There are things to like about this film though as much as the review so far has been in the negative. There are some pretty tense moments every once in a while, and if you get past the first half of this movie you will like the last half. Performances are up to par and Lucy Liu even gets naked in this film, which should have some of you excited. Also the movie is about vampires, who doesn't like that. But I guess over all this is not the best release from Producer Rob Tapert's production company with partner Sam Raimi, but it will do if you have nothing better to watch.",1223078400,,3165,4.043062200956938

If you can swallow this premise, you might just possibly enjoy this ludicrous, frequently laughable, two-hour-long foray into sadism, cannibalism, vampirism, necrophilia and supremely bad acting.  Sadie is at least a ghoul with a bit of a conscience - she feels really really bad when she has to eat someone - so we'll give her points for that, but the movie dedicated to telling her story rates a big fat zero on every other conceivable count.",1218931200,,710,5.165217391304348
2920353,2,B000UDGOC0,"Rise (Sebastian Gutierrez, 2007)

Perhaps the most telling sign that the demise of my favorite currently-running TV show, The Shield, is coming quickly: Michael Chiklis' presence in a movie that played, in its widest release, on sixty-three screens. Gutierrez, who was responsible for the execrable She-Creature in 2001 (despite the presence of Rufus Sewell, it's one of the handful of movies I've seen over the course of my life that I simply couldn't get through), cranks out another formulaic, unscary horror flick, this one about vampires instead of mermaids.

The plot: Sadie Blake (Lucy Liu) is a reporter who finds herself involved in a story that seems to involve vampires. She initially blows the story off, but when one of her co-workers disappears, she starts investigating. I'll fast-forward through the spoilery bits and get to Michael Chiklis, who here plays (surprise!) a police detective who's also on the case; jumping to conclusions, he pegs Sadie as the ruthless killer who's stalking the streets, and goes after her. Cue buddy-cop movie. The only problem is that by the time we get to the buddy-cop movie, there's about half an hour of screen time left.

I find it hard to characterize this as in ""indie film"" given its cast (aside from Liu and Chiklis, the cast includes Mako, Carla Gugino, James D'Arcy, Marilyn Manson, Elden Henson, and Nick Lachey-- yes, that Nick Lachey-- among others you will instantly recognize) and its Ghost House connections (they were the ones responsible for the remakes of Shimizu's Grudge films); hell, it's got Sam Goldwyn's name right up front! If that's not big-studio Hollywood, nothing is. And yet I can't believe some stuffed shirt in a penthouse office would have let this script through the way it is; it's jerky, unfocused, contains a slew of plot holes that make the notoriously holey Tara Reid vehicle Incubus look like a masterpiece of scriptwriting. And yet, Samuel Goldwyn. You understand my confusion, I hope. The acting is, in most cases, barely competent, but there are a few surprises (Chiklis is exempt, since he's playing Vic Mackey)-- Lachey lends at least a breath of believability to his character, and Liu proves she is, in fact, capable of emoting at least once in a movie.

Thing is, with another script rewrite and in that hands of someone who hadn't directed a monstrosity like She-Creature, I think Rise might have actually been worth watching. As it is, though, it's a mess. **",1216339200,,2459,4.975669099756691

If not for my girlfriend and a Stinger or two, the basic 20 minute rule would have kicked in and despite some lush camera work and one or two well done scenes, the predictable dialogue and slow pace would have would have sent me to bed. 2 stars is a reasonable rating - unless you're a blood drinking fan.",1212710400,2,359,4.142857142857143
2920355,4,B000UDGOC0,"Hence, the four stars. A quick summary goes as follows: a female reporter (Blake) researches into secret parties that have teenagers going missing.  She gets a little too close to the story when she discovers a vampire cult and ends up missing herself.  Sort of.  Blake does manage to find one of the missing teenagers, a cop's daughter.  The cop (Michael Chiklis) also tracks down Blake and decides to do whatever is necessary to get his daughter back.

All of acting was great, even the minor characters, and there were entertaining cameos throughout this movie.  Robert Forster was there and gone in a flash.  Marilyn Manson played a bartender without all the make-up (it took a while to recognize him) and Nick Lahey plays a small time crook who doesn't think about the whole picture (working for a vampire cult is never a good idea). But the two main characters are the ones that kept me glued to the screen.  Sadie Blake (Lucy Lui), a supposed unwilling victim and The Bishop (James D'Arcy), an Englishman who charms his way past a woman's barriers. These two are the ones to watch and scenes containing them sizzle. The cinematography is amazing with it's color washes of reds and blues upon black. It's nicely filmed by a master.

There were nice twists here with the innocent turned against her will into vampirism.... or was she? We learn from Eve that her will to survive was so strong that not even The Bishop's feeding could kill her. That her survival instincts took over and that's what made her a vampire, not another vampire. She was lead in that direction but Blake choose her path. I found this to be an interesting character development. As the Alchemist points out, no one is really innocent. He also points out that she is different from them, that she possess a gift. Apparently, this gift is the thirst for life and not the blood she needs to sustain it (life being a relative term here).

This movie definitely left on a possible sequel note and although I would not mind seeing another installment, the straight to dvdness of this movie leaves little option for another. There were a few plot holes but that's what makes it a ""B"" grade movie so I let it go.

I recommend this movie for supernatural film fans that like a different kind of vampire movie. This is not a great film and doesn't really qualify as true horror (lack of scary parts - plenty of gore but not much genuine fear), but entertaining all the same. Maybe it's just me though because I hated Dracula 2000 and most reviewers loved it.",1211846400,8,2527,4.605790645879733
2920356,4,B000UDGOC0,"I thought this was actually a good movie. Lucy Liu does a good job of carrying the story, and Carla Gugino (smoking hot), as the vampire who sires her, and James D'Arcy as the lead villain are quite good. The title of the review is their opinion of the important things in their world. Michael Chiklis has kind of a thankless role, but his scenes with Lucy are good. The story jumps back and forth, unnecessarily, but as several other reviews have mentioned, the scenes where Lucy's character comes back to life and her feedings are well done. The photography was striking, especially the scene where she is hanging upside down with the other bodies. Oh, and viewers will learn that Marilyn Manson looks better with his makeup!",1210982400,5,727,4.6875
2920357,2,B000UDGOC0,"Wasted money for those who bought it. Wasted time for Lucy Liu. Slow, extremely cliched, very boring.

2920358,2,B000UDGOC0,"As I get older and older and get more and more wrinkly, I start to vindictively resent awful films. After all, I only have so much time left on this earth. So what did I ever do to Lucy Lui that she'd blatantly steal away two hours of my life? Lucy Lui's movie career continues its downspiraling with this would-be horrorfest, RISE: BLOOD HUNTER. Except that the horror elements are tame as hell, and the film about as erotic as plucking your grandma's nose hairs (hopefully, that's not a turn-on for many). And, yes, there is plenty of tittilation here, some of it provided by Lucy Lui herself, who flaunts it in the buff in a few scenes. So, that's something. Alas, Carla Gugino, who is even more delectable, doesn't bestow a damn peep. You might be able to sense the quality of this film from the fact that I'm focusing so much on the nudity instead of, say, the plot or the acting.

Well, here's the plot. Reporter Sadie Blake (Lui) awakens in a morgue to find a toetag on her toe and herself become one of the bloodsucking undead. So, naturally, she wants some payback. In essence, that's the movie.

Now, the acting. Robert Forster has a cameo at the beginning, and then it struck him that sniffs at the Oscar Award don't come with cinematic skunks like this, and accordingly jetted. Michael Chiklis, usually a dependable thespian, ventures into sullen Michael Madsen territory as a boozy cop whose daughter had become vampire fodder, so he's all drinky and angry. Michael Chiklis, in case I was being too subtle, has been better. One saving grace in this movie is the ever-so-hot Carla Gugino, who doesn't get a lot of screen time yet manages to salvage some depth in her character. James D'Arcy plays the lead villain, and should be hissed at for not playing a good enough lead villain. Lucy Lui tries her darndest but, really, you can't make a cake out of crap, or if you try, you end up with cake that tastes like crap (and where's the fun in that?). Lucy, in desperate, desperate need of a good script and decent budgeting, ends up languishing in acting hell. Still, I give her props for trying, but then I wrest away the props because, in the first place, she should've known better than to sign her John Hancock to this movie contract. Lucy, remember the good old days, when you were making&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballistic-Ecks-vs-Sever/dp/B00007CVTH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballistic - Ecks vs. Sever</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Code-Name-The-Cleaner/dp/B000NA21SG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Code Name - The Cleaner</a>? Thank the bejesus television is good to her.

RISE thought it'd score on the hip factor by boasting a novelty casting of Nick Lachey (who plays a stooge, which is just about right) and Marilyn Manson (he's the bartender). But think again. On a truly sad note, this was Mako's final live action picture appearance. Rest easy, Mako.

Disjointed mess, disjointed mess. The film tries to do a PULP FICTION by jumping back and forth between the present and the past, but it does so without narrative cohesion or flow. It attempts to achieve the melancholy flavor of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow-Miramax-Dimension-Collector-s-Series/dp/B000059XUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow (Miramax/Dimension Collector's Series)</a>, but miserably fails. It's advertised as a supernatural revenge thriller, but whiffs on two of those three descriptives, because the supernatural content is dismal and the film isn't at all thrilling. On the other hand, Lucy does get her revenge on.

Again, I'm sure the meager budgeting forced the writers to forego the more sensational vampire effects. But not having the showy stuff should've given these writers all the more incentive to come up with a better story. Didn't happen. Plenty of dead spots in an already lackluster and lengthy film equals a hellacious dissing at the box office. Man, this movie dragged excruciatingly! Also, I expected Lucy Lui to be in there, kicking serious nosferatu tail. And while she succeeds in offing her targets, the manner in which she does it is simply frustrating. She pretty much just strolls up to them and shoots her crossbow, or has a drink with them and shoots her crossbow. Wesley Snipes and Kate Beckinsale must be laughing themselves silly.

It's a different breed of vampires, too, and not so satisfying. This type doesn't come equipped with fangs, and are forced to employ a cutting tool to slash their victim's throat. No changing to mist or bats, no children of the night. They're stronger than humans, but you don't see Lucy's character, Sadie, lifting dudes off their feet with one hand. Sadie seems to be immune to sunlight and crosses. And, apparently, in this reality, vampires are easy to knock out. That, or Sadie Blake is the sorriest vampire ever turned, getting knocked out and captured a busload of times. On the other hand, she makes out with a hot girl. So, again, that's something.

By the way, the bonus dvd stuff includes four 2-minute behind-the-scenes featurettes (""Blood,"" ""Sex & Murder,"" ""Location, Location,"" and ""Stunts); a Storyboard to Screen Comparison; and the theatrical trailer. In its paltriness, the extra features seem to be hinting, ""Why bother?""

Holy smokes, what a crap dvd.",1205107200,,5393,5.233796296296297
2920359,4,B000UDGOC0,"Hence, the four stars.  I'm going out on a limb here and I know I'll get booed but I liked this movie and thought it very good for it's genre.  I realize people don't like it when you go against the popular vote but I wanted to provide another voice. I'll skip summarizations as that has been already been provided but give my thoughts (for the two cents they're worth) instead.

I gather the Amazon Review person didn't watch the same movie because there are a lot of errors in that summary. I'm also confused over the starring roles listing.  Robert Forster was on screen for maybe two minutes - a nice cameo by him and a few others.  Marilyn Manson played a bartender without all the make-up (it took a while to recognize him) and Nick Lahey plays a small time crook who doesn't think about the whole picture (working for a vampire cult is never a good idea).

2920366,4,B000UDGOC0,"The credit for rounding up on ""Rise: Blood Hunter"" goes to the cinematography of John Toll.  I mean, come on: we are talking about a director of photography who won back-to-back Oscars for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legends-of-the-Fall/dp/B000BBOUD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legends of the Fall</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Braveheart/dp/B000W8OM5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Braveheart</a>,"" and was nominated again for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thin-Red-Line/dp/B00005PJ8T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thin Red Line</a>.""  So do not ask me how somebody like Toll ended up shooting a movie that was shot back in 2005 and released for two weeks this year to gross $106,398 dollars.  Writer-director Sebastian Gutierrez is known more as a writer (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gothika/dp/B0001FR3IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gothika</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snakes-on-a-Plane/dp/B000JBXHQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snakes on a Plane</a>"") than as a director (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Judas-Kiss/dp/0767832566/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Judas Kiss</a>,"" ""The Mermaid Chronicles Part 1: Sea Creature""), so that might be why Toll got involved.  I know that Carla Gugino is in this movie because she is Gutierrez's significant other, but I have to think Lucy Liu and Michael Chiklis had one eye on Gutierrez's screenwriting credits and the other on the script.  As for Marilyn Manson, why would he turn down the chance to play a bartender in a vampire movie?  Also, this was Mako's last movie, so you can see the cast is halfway decent for a flick like this one.

Liu is playing Sadie Blake, an up and coming investigative reporter who is brutally raped and murdered by a pair of vampires, Bishop (James D'Arcy) and Eve (Carla Gugino).  Three days later she wakes up in a morgue and quickly figures out she is a vampire.  That takes care of the ""Rise"" part of the title.  The ""Blood Hunter"" half has to do with her mission of revenge to wipe out the vampire cult, aided and abetted eventually by Clyde Rawlins (Chiklis), a cop who has just lost his daughter to the vamps.  It takes a while for Sadie and Rawlins to agree to work together, at which point she makes him a rather interesting offer as to what happens when all of the vamps are not just merely dead but really most sincerely dead.

There is an interesting selectivity to what part of standard vampire lore makes it into ""Rise.""  They keep the no reflection in the mirror bit, which makes for a simple way to convince somebody that they are talking to a vampire and an interesting way of not getting to see a naked body in a nude scene.  The stake through the heart is still the primary way for dispatching vampires, although in this case the ""stake"" is a bolt fired from a mini-crossbow.  The extended canine teeth are gone as that being the way vampires make their victims bleed; their alternative approach is interesting because it actually produces more blood than your standard vampire movie.  Unfortunately, what might have been the most interesting twist on vampire lore is never really explained: Sadie is told at one point that it takes three days to turn a human into a vampire and that whatever happens the last two days she did on her own.  That caught my attention, but beyond the psychological implication that she wanted to become one of the undead, there is no explanation for what all is involved in the process.

As the titular Blood Hunter, Liu has her moments, but I found it hard to reconcile the emotional Sadie from the stone cold killer one.  I suppose death changes you (that is usually the hope), but the emotional range of the character seemed stretched to me.  Liu was scarier in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill-Volume-1/dp/B00005JMEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill, Volume 1</a>,"" and I have the suspicion that the actress was trying not to just do more of the same, even thought that might have better benefited her performance in this role.  In contrast, Chiklis could be doing Vic Mackey's cousin the way his character acts.  There are some philosophical dimensions to the tale as well, with Bishop choosing to experience everything the world has to offer at the cost of a few meaningless lives, while Sadie would rather be dead than undead.  But in the end ""Rise: Blood Hunter"" is primarily a thriller more than anything else and whatever you mind might think of the story, your eyes will be impressed by Toll's cinematography.  Take him out of the equation and this movie would lose at least a star.",1193097600,10,4834,5.663434903047092

Rise - Blood Hunter (aka just ""Rise"") is one of those films that starts with a teaser-glimpse of the end, then the movie unnecessarily jumps all over from past to present throughout the flick. This made for a more discombobulated story flow than it did for an interesting way to tell a story. The plot (after much back-story) surrounds the plights of a rogue vampire (Liu) that crosses paths with a cop looking for the cult (or person...or thing) that killed his daughter.

Rise has its tense moments, but they are few and far between, and the film is a tad bit predictable. It's also sexy at times...kinky even. But even Lucy Liu hanging upside-down naked couldn't get a big enough...er...um...""Rise"" out of audiences to keep this movie out of the straight to DVD crossbow sight.
