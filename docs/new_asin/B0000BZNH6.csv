8502661,1,B0000BZNH6,"This is another of the unlimited supply of anti-Arab racism that is prevalent in American media, of all types.  A bad movie on all counts.  Racist conception and goal, bad and disturbing story, and a bad production.  I do not recommend it to anyone, unless he or she enjoyes putting down other people, and has no brains to figure how he or she is being used in anti-Arab propaganda.",1080691200,6,382,4.507246376811594
8502662,1,B0000BZNH6,"Very racist and anti-arab movie. Following the usual disturbed image we have about Arabs being untolerant and evil. I thought it is so cliche to use the Arab-Israeli conflict as a theme of the movie and to show Arabs as the bad guys again. Aren't our news channels enough? I would strongly advise you not to see it...but if you do, beware of the poisonous ideas it advocates.",1068336000,12,375,4.529411764705882
