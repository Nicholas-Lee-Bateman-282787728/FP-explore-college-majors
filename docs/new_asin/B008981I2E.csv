I can honestly say I only once in my life learned so much so affordably before, with these step by step videos I was not only able to make and create professional podcasts, I was also lead through a personal one on one line experience of building a community with a rock solid website.

If you wish produce podcast (audio or video) I know of no better one stop solution then these videos, once completed it was obvious to me that Steve not only pours his heart into this product but he truly does a brain dump and exposes all secrets to a successful podcast.

I am happy to say my podcasts have only gotten better in quality, number of listeners and community interaction when I implement things from ""How To Podcast"", I often go back and rewatch segments and learn a little bit more each time

I say don't waste time searching through youtube or Google only to find half answers from untrusted sources, get the straight talk from someone who did it from the ground up and save yourself the heartache and time",1339027200,,1020,4.438502673796791
