7963635,1,B0000682VE,"I bought this video, expecting it to be of the beautiful Chatsworth House and gardens, when it turned out to be gardens only. Both my mom in law and i were very let down by this, it wasn't a cheap video, and not what was expected. I am from the UK and so wanted my American Mom to see the magnificent Chatsworth. Not happy.
