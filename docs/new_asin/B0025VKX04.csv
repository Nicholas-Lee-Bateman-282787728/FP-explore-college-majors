3849540,5,B0025VKX04,I hve always benn a fan of the Night Court TV show. I watched it from the begining when it was on TV and I enjoy watching it over and over.,1357689600,,139,3.5161290322580645
3849541,5,B0025VKX04,"Great show.  Can't wait for seasons 8 & 9 to be released!  The sooner the last two seasons can be released, the better.",1357430400,,119,4.130434782608695
3849542,5,B0025VKX04,One of the best shows ever.  I have the other five seasons and season seven.  The ones with Markie Post and Marsha Warfield and the best.  Always good for a laugh.,1355961600,,163,4.193548387096774
3849543,5,B0025VKX04,this was one of the really good comedies on tv. the cast fit together and played off each other extremely well. too bad it isn't still around,1350691200,,141,4.2592592592592595
3849544,5,B0025VKX04,"I always liked the program on tv, because it is so funny. The only problem I have with it is two of the cases I received with my order were broken on the inside. Other than that I realy enjoyed watching the DVD'S. The show was always realy funny. The only thing is that I noticed some of the episodes were missing like when Cristine got married. Those weren't in the set. Those episoded are the only ones that I noticed were missing so far.",1350691200,,440,4.188235294117647
3849545,5,B0025VKX04,"Unlike most other shows, Night Court didn't lose much of a beat after 6 seasons, and its irreverent (and sometimes politically incorrect) humor is as enjoyable today as it was 20-plus years ago. Our favorite episodes are ""The Clip Show"" featuring Richard Sanders (from WKRP) as a city auditor threatening to throw the book at Harry, and ""From Snoop To Nuts"" in which Christine thinks she saw Harry accept a bribe from a mobster. I would much rather see this show than 90% of the sitcoms that are airing today.",1349740800,7,509,4.666666666666667
3849546,5,B0025VKX04,"Night court remains one of the funniest series I have ever seen.  The characters are unusual, and they show how the law was changing in the 1980s.  Judge Harry Stone is interesting because he has an interest in justice, not just the letter of the law.  Dan Fielding is hilarious, and he really does make a person wonder if there is a real Dan Fielding out there somewhere.

This is a funny, funny, heart-warming show.",1344988800,4,417,4.52
3849547,5,B0025VKX04,"I loved this show and was happy to find out my friend did as well, I have bought the first 3 seasons so far. I will purchase them all. good seller.",1344902400,,147,3.774193548387097
3849548,4,B0025VKX04,"I'm SO GLAD they FINALLY came out with season 6. Night Court is a GREAT show, VERY funny.  The show itself is definitely worth 5 stars (or more). However, I rated this particular DVD 4 stars as there are NO subtitles (shame on Warner Bros.), and the clarity of a couple of the episodes is rather dark.",1341705600,6,301,4.280701754385965
3849549,4,B0025VKX04,"By Season 6, the innovative, funny Night Court started to show signs of aging. After hitting the ratings peak of # 7 in seasons 3 and 4, the show slipped in Season 5 to # 21, and then season 6 finished a disappointing # 29. It was still one of the better sitcoms on TV at the time, but some of the routines were getting a little long in the tooth.

Season 6 begins where Season 5 leaves off. Dan has left to fulfill his obligation to the US Army Reserves when the gang gets word that his plane crashed in Alaska and Dan is presumed dead. Season 6, Episode 1 shows that Dan survived and is forced to operate on an Eskimo woman after he accidentally breaks the doctors' hands. By Episode 2 he is on his way back home and arrives in time for his own funeral.

In later episodes, Dan runs for State Assembly, Harry dates a porn star, Bull is smitten (again?), Mac is chased by an old girlfriend, Roz is jailed after delivering toys to kids at Christmas that belonged to a Scrooge-like character, and Christine volunteers to take care of a friend's baby with hilarious results.

Night Court was one of my favorite shows from the 1980s along with Remington Steele and Cheers (whatever became of NBC?), and the entire series thus far on DVD has been good. But be aware that at this point, their best seasons were behind them.",1340841600,9,1318,4.327935222672065

3849590,5,B0025VKX04,"LOVE this series! Once they found the right group of actors, everything just clicked. I highly recommend this classic TV sitcom series to anyone who truly wants a good belly laugh. Today's TV comedies don't even come close to the laughs that this show gives out. You'll see character traits of some, or even all, of the cast in the people you know in your own life. I know I see a little bit of Dan Fielding and Christine Sullivan in my co-workers and when I make references to this show they get a dumbfounded look because they have never heard of this show and that's when I tell them that they are missing out on some great comedy and that they should check it out A.S.A.P.!

3849629,5,B0025VKX04,"Night Court season 6 picks up with Dan Fielding thought to be dead but is alive and well on a remote island saved by Native Americans. When Dan accidently shoots down a plane with a doctor and one of the Native Americans has an a ruptured appendix it's up to an extremely reluctant Dan to and try and save her life. Dan is actual late for his own funeral. Other highlights include Bull learning he's a genius, Harry jailing Roz for contempt of court when she refuses to hand over a truck load of toys to a real Scrooge like character. Mac goes back to College and his study buddy is more interested in him than studding him than history and wait till Quon Lee finds out. Then Harry and company are threaten with jail because of the expensive damages to the court in the 2 part ""The Clip Show"" Dan meets a madwoman whose has dangerous obession with movies. Dan runs for the NY State Senate and falls in love his rival in ""Strange Bedfellows"". Harry learns that Buddy is his biological father in the 2 part ""From Snoop to Nuts"" and the season ends with ""Yet Another Day In The Life"" instead of a cliffhanger.

Season 6 is pretty fun but it shows that the writers were running out of ideas for the show and that some new directions were needed. But still there is a lot good humor and a lot of touching moments.",1423094400,,1308,4.295546558704453

3849644,4,B0025VKX04,"As Night Court begins its 1988-89 Season, Assistant District Attorney Dan Fielding (John Larroquette) is listed as missing and presumed dead when his plane crashes in the Arctic Ocean.

Judge Harry Stone (Harry Anderson) cautions the others against expecting Dan to still be alive after 2 weeks of futile search-and-rescue efforts, but Legal Aid Attorney Christine Sullivan (Markie Post) refuses to give up hope and prays for Dan's safe return. Dan, meanwhile, is alive on a remote island, saved by a seal. And that's just the start of the season.

Subsequent side-splitting episodes see Bull Shannon(Richard Moll) glue his fingers to the side of his head, Mac Robinson(Charles Robinson) deal with a classmate who has more on her mind than studying, and Harry jailing Roz (Marsha Warfield) when she won't divulge the location of a truckload of toys mistakenly given to needy kids.

Justice prevails in this 3-Disc, 22-Episode Collection.

This 1988-1989 Season takes me back to memory lane to when I was 16 years old in my Sophomore year in high school when I used to watch it every Thursday night after THE COSBY SHOW and when NBC's motto was ""Come Home to The Best"".",1392940800,,1168,4.9438775510204085
3849645,4,B0025VKX04,I waited with baited breath every morning at 2am(insomnia) to watch and crack up off of Dan(he is underrated..so talented). This show pulled me out of the depresive slup I have been in lately due to the weather and such. I plan to purchase all the seasons available. GREAT SERIES!!!,1392422400,,282,4.66

3849649,2,B0025VKX04,Series is OK--no closed captioning makes it really really hard to watch. Both my wife and I are hearing impaired and miss about 10-20% of the dialog.  It needs a better warning.,1377907200,,177,4.53125

3849655,4,B0025VKX04,"Night Court was completely wacky and one of the funniest shows of all time. The show parodied how dysfunctional Night Courts can be. Harry is hilariously unorthodox and yet an efficent judge. I didn't retain alot of the great quotes. Dan's plane went down in the Arctic and he was unconscious and rescued by a seal and the natives on a remotes island and the dynamic between the primitive natives and the Seal was very funny. A tramp got Harry and Dan undrressed and hid from the person coming in his chambers by going out on the ledge and ending up stranded. Bull was found to be esceptionally talented intellectually in an area of assignemnts and ends up in a lab. Dan Fielding gets on a game show and words from an obscene proposition he heard retract his memory to win. I didn't like the offensive male stereotyping and manhater like remarks, but there was only a handful or less. Bull is always the most funny character on the show and did some very amusing things and Dan showed more of his decentness, thought he was meant to be annoying boorish, self centered et cetra. Christine goes on a date with Art, the maintenance man and Mac, the one straight man delivers lots of dry and biting remarks and his professional stability gets threatened by a young woman. I would laugh plenty if I didn't watch it alone, it's a darn good show with the main character a very decent man.",1367712000,3,1381,4.50597609561753

3849661,3,B0025VKX04,"I had bought seasons 4 and 5 on this MOD title and was... less than impressed.

The price was higher than previous seasons, and a burn on a consumer-grade off-the-shelf disc* was a turnoff.  For the price commanded, a low-grade disc is a ripoff.

Especially as season 4's release had a mastering error with the audio losing sync in one episode, which is not attributable to the master videotapes shot circa 1985 or whenever...

Night Court's final solid season would be its seventh, and season 6 was a letdown from season 5.  After season 7 the show would never really recover.

One thing that is great about these as opposed to seeing them on tv (even though they aren't rerunning this show right now), is that you get the entire show.  Some of the scenes are deleted for commercial purposes when they air.  Waiting for the final 2 seasons to complete my collection.",1359417600,,455,4.65

This season was worth the price in spite of the, sometimes, heavy subject matter. Maybe the writers were running out of the sharp punchlines of the past years.

8351215,5,B0025VKX04,"I suppose there are a few people out there who have never heard of the comedy series, Night Court, which ran from 1984 to 1992. But for those unfortunate few, they truly do not know what they are missing.

Night Court broke the usual comic mold. Most comedies are centered around a normal central character witnessing the madness around him or her. With Night Court, everyone is nuts, including Harry Anderson, who plays a judge, a figure society assumes is as solid as a rock.

What made this show so darn funny was clever, well-written scripts, the right combination of identifiable personalities (I mean, who does not know a person like Dan Fielding or Christine Sullivan?), and the choice of actors perfectly suited to match their characters, giving performances of the roles of their careers.

There was also an incredible range in its humor. While most comedy series usually find one level of banality and stay there, the comedy in Night Court covered a greater spectrum. Thus, the humor was sometimes poignant, sometimes philosophical, sometimes slapstick, farcical, or even downright dumb, many times in the same episode. The humor, though, was never boring. The humor was intelligent, smart, ... and just darn funny.

The show never really jumped the shark, even when it easily could. In the eighth season a new character, a ditzy Court Reporter, was introduced. So now there are two comic relief characters in the Courtroom, the Court Reporter and one of the Bailiffs, Bull Shannon (Richard Moll.) While introducing a new character to an established routine is usually fatal to the over-all chemistry of the cast, this new character, through deft comic script-writing, fits right in, adding, not hindering, the comic effect.

Recurring actors include John Astin, of Addams Family fame, Yakov Smirnoff, and Mel Torme, who shows incredible acting flair as Harrys idol.

For all those who have not seen this series, check it out.",1498003200,,1936,5.034375
