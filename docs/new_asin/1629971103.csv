7800701,5,1629971103,"This is a college level course on mathematical decision making. There are 24 lessons, 6 on each of 4 DVDs. The instructor is excellent! He explains things well enough that my high school-age son was able to follow along and understand most of it. I am very pleased with all of the Great Courses series than I have encountered so far. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.",1467590400,,413,4.52
7800702,5,1629971103,"My son is very advanced and has a genius level IQ for only being 14. He skipped a grade in elementary school due to this. I always try to keep him engaged and push him to learn more. I saw this course and I knew this would be right down his alley. He is very gifted in math and his Algebra team took second place in Math League competition this year.

He really enjoyed this course and the professor on the DVD. He was able to easily follow the instruction and learn the concepts he was teaching. He has only gone through a few of the lessons so far but he is looking forward to finishing this course over the summer. This will help with the summer loss that many kids experience when they first get back to school. I am excited to look at other courses that are offered to see how I can challenge him next summer.

I was provided this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. This review is based on my actual experiences with this product.",1467244800,,957,4.195652173913044
7800703,5,1629971103,"The professor was engaging, easy to understand, animated (meaniing in an expressive and multi-tonal way, not a cartoon lol!), and in my opinion, was very well informed on the subject matter he was presenting. The course material itself was presented in a way that was logical, relevant and yes, even interesting.

There is a lot of material to go through on this course, and I have only just begun it, but overall I thought it was well worth my time and I would definitely recommend this college level course to anyone who is looking to expand their knowledge of mathematical decision making processes.

7800704,5,1629971103,"This is a great course, and it is so challenging. My son, who has high-functioning autism, is really enjoying going through it. It is very high level, but so is he. This is great for anybody who is interested in learning more about this. This DVD has an interesting instructor and a great textbook to go with it. People who go through this should expect to already have a good understanding of math or spend more time on the concepts.

I received a discount to try this out and write a review based on using it.",1466899200,,511,4.322916666666667
7800705,5,1629971103,"This is another really surprising item to find on Amazon. I've gotten a couple of these so far, and am impressed so much that I just went and bought 2 more at full price. This is not for just a math refresher. This is an in depth college level course specifically for problem solving and mathematical decision making. The how to's and the why's. It is something that is going to take some time to completely finish. You get 4 DVD's and each has 6 lessons, so you get a total of 24 complete lessons. You also get a 261 page textbook to go along with it. Not only are you seeing what to do on your TV, but you are also using your book to go along with the lesson. I figure between these courses that I have gotten from Amazon, and the ones that I have ordered, I should at least be somewhat closer to being ready to go back to school. I will be used to setting aside the time to work on 1 ""class"" at a time, and actually focusing on that. That is why I ordered these when I was given the chance to begin with. I did get this at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1466294400,,1088,4.018433179723503
7800706,5,1629971103,"I have always liked math and I have always liked how math made complex things easier to understand.  This mathematical book and DVD shows you how you can take many different decisions and use math to help you make them.  This mathematical book and DVD shows you how to take very complex decisions and mathematical decisions and break them down to understand and make better choices.  It shows you how to look at things in different mathematical ways from different mathematical points of views.  I am taking the mathematical book and DVD very slowly because it takes me several times to hear, process and understand the concepts.  Someone who is really good at math can just fly through these however for me I need to take it slow to get the information in my head and apply it.  I like the mathematical book and DVD it is hard for me in places however still very interesting to me.  I received a discount on this product in a special promotion. My review, my opinion and experience is honest and 100% genuine.",1466208000,,1010,4.5777777777777775
7800707,5,1629971103,"I will try this again. First time doing my review my computer thought it was a great time to do a restart. I love to learn new things. To bad I wasn't that way in school. I have always been thought that great courses was a neat idea. This is a four set disk and book, that teaches you how to use math as a decision making advice. I am a manager of a store and I also own my own business with my sister. I could see where the information learned here could be used in day to day workings of the businesses. Will definitely get some more of the learning courses. Disclaimer I received this product at a discount price for my honest review.",1465862400,,637,4.063492063492063
