3630262,5,B001HCQW0C,"Part three of ""Code Geass"" yanks out anime fans' heartstrings with a genocidal tragedy and the near destruction of Japan.

It opens with LeLouch (a.k.a. the Black Knight, Zero) plotting his next moves against his enemy, Suzaku, who is now Princess Euphemia's knight. However, his plans don't turn out as expected, leaving Zero to use his Geass to control Suzaku.

The next few episodes 19-21 transform the series into an amusing harem romance, with characters falling in love. LeLouch meets up with Euphemia, who share a touching romance together. Suzaku also arrests Kallen in an embarassing fan service nude scene.

There's plenty of romance in these episodes, and LeLouch's relationship reaches a charming lovey-dovey point in episode 22. However, all hope ends up shattering in LeLouch's face, leading to a violent overthrow of Brittania.

To say the least, the last episodes of ""Code Geass"" are breathtakingly destructive. The series reaches its blood-splattering peak in episode 22, with loads of bullets and robot destruction. The fall of the Black Knights is stunning to watch.

Unfortunately, the adrenaline-packed final episode is cut short with a bullet-time scene and a teaser for season two. However, the first season is so visually satisfying that fans will definitely want to hunt for the second season, R2, immediately.",1252800000,,1335,5.278301886792453
3630263,5,B001HCQW0C,"Many have compared this series to Death Note, but it is far beyond that...

Lelouch is one of the greatest heroes ever in anime, and though it may appear differently to others, here and in the show, there is nothing more noble than a man risking EVERYTHING to save his sister.

If the show was all about Lelouch then we would get another Death Note clone, which chronicles the life of ONLY Light!!!

Code Geass paints a picture, using politics, war, strategy, fantasy, emotion, betrayal, trust, and most importantly love.

The last 8 episodes of Code Geass ends with MANY plot twists, and it all comes down to an incomplete showdown...

While there is R2, I believe that, by itself, Code Geass told a very good story by itself.",1245888000,,727,4.604651162790698
3630264,5,B001HCQW0C,"Code Geass is the best anime I've seen to date.  It has a bit of everything:  mecha, strategy, romance, politics, comedy.  The characters are interesting and engaging, and the English dubbing is pretty good.  Curve balls come out of left field at any moment making you desperate to see the next episode.  My jaw hit the floor more often in this series than all the other anime I've seen combined.  Can't recommend this series strongly enough.  WARNING: don't search for info on the show online as you'll probably find HUGE SPOILERS!!",1244505600,,533,4.791208791208791
3630265,5,B001HCQW0C,"""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" has been a gripping and thrilling series since the start of episode 1.

An anime series that has a good amount of drama and action and the pace never slows down, things continue to escalate with each episode and manages to captivate you by its well-written storyline and beautiful animation.

With the release of this ""Part III"" box set containing volumes 5 and 6, this is the final box set for the first season.

The series revolves around Lelouch Lamperouge, one of the children of the Britannian Emperor.  As a child, Lelouch has harbored resentment towards his Britannian roots since the death and murder of his mother, Marianne vi Britannia.  When he was younger, he spoke out against his father and by doing so, he and his sister Nunally (who was blinded and crippled during the murder of her mother) have lived with the Ashford family, hiding their Britannian ancestry.  But for Lelouch, he has always wanted to take revenge against his father, even if it means destroying Britannia, including his siblings.

Japan has harbored a hatred towards Britannia, ever since the country took over Japan, made the major cities into slums and have called the Japanese not by their country name but they are known as ""Elevens"".  In the first volume of ""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"", we see how Lelouch has received the power of the Geass.  A power given to him by an immortal being known as C.C. (the girl with green hair) but for a price, which is a contract between the two which is unknown.  The Geass allows Lelouch to use it once on a person by looking into their eyes and have them do whatever he wants.  With this power, he has assumed the identity of the terrorist ZERO, who has managed to amass a great number of Elevens and name them the ""Black Masks"", a group that counters the Britannians and eventually taking their technology and grow in force.

Opposing Zero is actually Lelouche's childhood friend Suzaku Kururgi, the pilot of Britannia's awesome mecha known as the ""Lancelot"".  He is the son of Japan's last Prime Minister and also the primary Japanese taken in by the Britannia and a warrior who opposes all that Zero stands for.  He and Princess Euphemia (Lelouche's half sister and third princess of Britannia) are quite smitten with each other.

With the first two volumes featuring the battle of the Black Masks vs. the Britannians, we see how Zero gets used to his new power and how he is able to grow his group and amass new technology and even get Britannians to side with him.  But also having to make tough decisions by using his Geass on the people that are close to him.

Now, with part III which contains the final two volumes released, things ramp up even more as the battle between the Black Masks and Britannia becomes personal.

""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion Part III"" comes with both volume 5 (episodes 18-21) and volume 6 (episodes 22-25) of the popular anime television series.  Here is a quick spoiler-free rundown of each episode for volumes 5 and 6:

  1. Stage 18 - I Order You. Suzaku Kururugi - Princess Euphemia makes Suzaku her knight.  The Black Masks debate if they should assassinate Suzaku.
  2. Stage 19 - Island of the Gods - After a battle between Zero and Suzaku (in his Lancelot), both Euphemia and Zero and Kalen and Suzaku are transported to another island and identies are revealed.
  3. Stage 20 - Battle for Kyushu - The Britannian Army fights against the Kyush invaders.
  4. Stage 21 - The school Festival Declaration - With Princess Euphemia (Euphy) knowing Zero's real identity, she decides to side with him and making a public announcement that will shock Britannia and Japan.

For Volume 6, we get the following episodes:

  1. Stage 22 - Bloodstained Euphy -  Zero's price of using the Geass comes to create great tragedy by an accident which has Princess Euphemia doing the unthinkable.
  2. Stage 23 - At Least with Sorrow -  After what has transpired in episode 22, Zero has no choice but to make a decision that will cause major repercussions between Britannia and the Black Masks.
  3. Stage 24 - The Collapsing Stage - The war between the Black Masks and Britannia begins in full force.  Suzaku filled with rage wants only one thing, the death of Zero.
  4. Stage 25 - Zero  - With Nunally being taken by V.V., Zero has no choice but to go after her and leave the Black Mask army to defend themselves.  The shocking finale of Season 1.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""CODE OF GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" is featured 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  The animation and video quality is colorful and digitally modern since it is a newer anime television release.  What I love about the video quality is the sheer amount of people involved.  Everyone with detail, buildings, mecha and the destruction has detail.  The character designs based from CLAMP's character design concepts are just fresh and cool to look at.  One of the coolest looking character designs in an anime mecha series without being a full-on mecha series.  Very cool!

As expected from a recent anime series, video quality was just great.  From the character animation to the backgrounds, everything was colorful and vibrant.  And because this series features so many scenes throughout Japan, this series really featured so much background art and characters.  Everything looked awesome!  Again, I'm very impressed with how much went in creating a single episode.

As for the audio, the audio is English and Japanese in Dolby Digital (English and Japanese stereo).  On my 7.2 system, the sound comes quite clear on your fronts and rear surrounds but good audio usage when it comes to the action and music scenes.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and overall, for a TV series broadcasted in Japan, audio was quite satisfactory.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

You can find really cool special features on both volumes.  Let's start with the volume 5 DVD:

  1. Picture Drama Episode Episode  (Stage 9.33) - (4:11) A festival at Ashford Academy and the girls talk about cosplaying for the event.  Lelouche, Suzaku and Arthur sporting sexy female outfits while the girls sport male outfits.  Lelouche has a hard time with it.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" is a fantastic series.  Despite the fact that there are many characters in this series, the story is well-written and well-animated that you know each of these character's major role within the Black Mask or the Britannia Army.

But what amazes me the most is the amount of character development put into each episode and you feel a connection with not just the main characters but also the many supporting characters in the series.

In this final volume, it's shocking to see how far Lelouche will go to carrying out his plans but also the tragic episodes that happen when his Geass goes out of control.  I was shocked by the tragedy and overall, impressed of how the story was presented.  Even more impressed with the cliffhanger for the final season.  Well done!

There are very few animated series that keep a strong pacing with its storyline and not use filler episodes just for the sake of character development or breaks from the storyline.  ""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" is a series where things continue to escalate with each episode.  So, in a positive, you never miss a heartbeat, each episodes gets better and better.  The negative is if you came into the series late during the airing in Japan and never watched previous episodes, then one can easily get confused.

Overall, Bandai Entertainment has done a great job presenting each volume with a good amount of special features.  These last two volumes feature a good number of drama episodes, commentary and even interviews with the English dub voice actors.  Animation quality is just beautiful to look at and the audio is clear and understandable.  The musical score is terrific!

If you have invested your time into the previous volumes, you definitely want to own these final two.  The storyline just ramps up to an incredible season finale but also a tragedy that just sets the wheels in motion between Lelouche and Suzaku.  Fantastic episodes that make you crave even more!

""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" is magnificent and for those who want quality anime, definitely invest your time in this animated TV series.  It's well worth it!",1243468800,14,11366,4.891042430591933
3630266,5,B001HCQW0C,Product Arrived Fast and in excellent condition. i definitely will buy more products from this user. 5 out of 5.,1239667200,,112,4.65
3630267,5,B001HCQW0C,"When I bought the first two volumes of Code Geass: Lelouch Of The Rebellion, it was entirely on a whim. I had heard such great things about the series, and I thought I would give it a try. The risk, as it turned out, was aboslutely worth the cost, as I became eneveloped in an incredible world that combined science fiction, fantasy, and political drama in ways I had never seen before.

Now here I am at the last volume, and I still want so more.

Frst, in regards to the show itself, the last two discs do not disappoint. The show is always driven by its characters, whether they are in the thick of battle or attending school. This is important, as too many works these days - be they anime or film, from any nation - tend to forget how important the characters are, and instead forcus on plots twists and cool visuals. Code Geass delivers these as well, but never loses sight of the people.

People who have not watched to the end yet should know that the series ends with one of the biggest cliffhangars in the history of visual media. Normally, this would be considered a cardinal sin, but there is a second season, so remember that as the credits roll.

Now for the box set. I normally don't splurge on anime DVDs like this, but with Code Geass, it is worth the extra cash. The discs themselves would be worth the cost alone. Bandai has packed them with special features the likes of which are rare for anime.
-First are the Picture Dramas, short segments intended to fill in gaps within the series, and occasionally provide some much needed levity. They are available in both languages.
-Next are the Episode Commentaries from the original Japanese cast and crew. Admittedly, the commentators have a tendency to ramble about things that have nothing to do with the series, but they are having so much fun you tend not to care.
-We are also treated tointerviews with the four lead dub actors, which is also quite interesting. For the record, the dub of the series is exceptionally well done, so these interviews are a nice touch.
-Beyond that, we get the standard trailers and clean opening/closing animation.

With the discs, however, come extra little treats. First is the third volume of the Sound Episodes, which are like the picture dramas without the visual. They are performed by the dub cast, who, as mentioned earlier, do an exceptional job.
Next is the second volume of the series' soundtrack [the first volume of which is included with Part 1 of the series]. As far as soundtracks go, I definitely recommend these CDs, as the music is also a driving force in the series.
Then, there is the first volume of the manga Code Geass: Suzaku Of The Counterattack, a reinterpretation that shifts the focus to Suzaku, and puts a superhero spin on the story [Lancelot is an Iron Man-style suit rather than a mecha]. This is the followup to the last two boxes containing the official Code Geass manga adaptation. While I despise the other Geass manga, SOTC is a different story, and therefor certainly worth a look.

Overall, this series is one of the best out there. Now, if only Bandai would hurry up and release R2 so I can find out what happened next...",1239580800,5,3164,4.571428571428571
3630268,5,B001HCQW0C,"Code Geass is one of the best Amine series of all time. Part 3 provides an awesome end to the 1st Season, and gets you exited for the second.

3630269,5,B001HCQW0C,"This is the epic cliffhanger conclusion to season 1 of Code Geass.
If you are a fan of the series, you will not be dissappointed in the final volume of season 1.

This special edition collection comes with all the extras of the previous special editions, but the manga book that comes with it is actually a different one. It comes with Code Geass Suzaku of the Counterattack instead of Lelouch of the Rebellion manga. Still good but I was slightly dissappointed. The music episodes are also really nice to hear in addition to watching the episodes.",1238716800,,548,4.649484536082475
3630270,5,B001HCQW0C,"If your looking for a show that plays out by the book then Code Geass isn't for you. What I found in Code Geass is a very mature and interesting show about what is right, what is wrong, and who gets to decide.

  This box comes with volumes 5 and 6 which are individually cased and  include the last 8 episodes of the first season. You also get the first volume of the Code Geass: Suzaku of the Counterattack manga, the third sound episode CD, 3 booklets containing interviews with the staff of the show, a booklet of character sketches by CLAMP, the CLAMP bonus mini comic vol. 2, and the second O.S.T CD which features the T.V. size version of Code Geass's award wining first opening ""Colors"". The box its self is only meant to house the items that came with it. It is made from thin cardboard and is not meant to house the rest of the volumes in the series.

  I haven't enjoyed a show this much in quit a while. So if your interested in suspense, drama, action, romance, and even a little bit of comedy then I highly recommend joining the rebellion and checking out this series.",1238112000,,1082,4.326732673267327
