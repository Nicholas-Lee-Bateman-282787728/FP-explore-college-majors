2653152,5,B0000EYV7Y,"Had the DVD of this to help teach my son to read. That was about 10 years ago. Cannot find the DVD anywhere (nor do I have anything to play it on). So I was very glad to find this download available for my daughter now. She is able to watch it on TV and iPad and is on here way to being a great reader like her big brother.

Once the child can recognize letters and know the sounds of each letter, this is the perfect next step toward reading.

It was a success 10 years ago and it is a success now.",1483660800,4,499,3.7884615384615383

My third child is also using this video to learn how to read and associate letters with sounds. Kinda cheesy, but we can't argue with the results!",1518393600,,309,4.7407407407407405

8143942,5,B0000EYV7Y,"This is a video I let my budding readers watch on a daily basis. The concepts provided give kids a solid foundation in phonics and make the process fun. I consider this video series the first part of my children's reading curriculum. I love that its on a video so my kids can get the constant repetition they need without testing my patience.

When I started formal phonics programs with my two oldest children they were able to skip the first part of the curriculum because they already knew their letter sounds.
