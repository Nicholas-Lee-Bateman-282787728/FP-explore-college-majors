8091445,1,B000BQYX4M,another film that makes you wonder what you could have accomplished if you had done anything else besides watching this.,1229731200,,120,5.05
8091446,1,B000BQYX4M,"My hopes were heightened when I typed in the word
partners and saw that it was finally out on dvd.
I was crushed to see that it was not the 1982
version with John Hurt and Ryan O Neal.
This is just a bothersome piece of fluff with
acting that would make John Hurt cringe.
Don't waste your money or your time on this one.",1200787200,,320,3.9384615384615387
8091447,4,B000BQYX4M,"At last, a clever adult comedy about adult situations.

I found myslef laughing out loud as the different characters went though self discovery and self-disclosure.  It was refreshing to see the characters honestly and humorously re-evaluating themselves.

This is worth seeing.",1141344000,4,278,5.7317073170731705
8091448,3,B000BQYX4M,"The movie has a very promising start, with good acting and high production values. The only problem is that about half way through we know exactly what is going to happen at the end. If you don't mind this kind of predictability in movies - you will enjoy PARTNER(S)!

The movie is not earmarked for a gay audience - it is a story with gay elements intended for a straight audience. And therefore it falls between two chairs.

If Jonathan had to do more ""gay"" things to prove he was in fact gay - the movie would have had more credibility, but I suppose the producers were afraid that might have repelled their prospective straight audiences.

An original feature to the story was the two assistants at the law firm debating straight and gay traits. Very funny.

This DVD is not bad at all - just predictable. NO extra features (just trailers)",1138665600,7,843,4.526315789473684
8091449,4,B000BQYX4M,"'Partner(s)' turns out to be a far better little film than expected. Not that there is anything original about this oft told variation of posing to be something you're not in order to take advantage of career development only to have that posing backfire.  But Dave Diamond's script and direction and the presence of an attractive, bubbly and capable cast make this little piece of fluff float.

Tables are turned in a competitive law firm where an important case is to be assigned, a case involving sex discrimination over a gay employee.  Dave (Jay Harrington) and Katherine (Julie Bowen), lovers in the past, vie for the assignment that will most assuredly result in being granted full partner ship in the firm. The company involved happens to include a cute young lass Lucy (Brooke Langton) who lives in the same apartment with  Dave (Dave happens to room with a gay guy Christopher - Michael Ian Black - but Dave is straight).  Lucy eyes Dave but mistakenly thinks Dave is gay, a fact that she feels will help her father's company in the lawsuit if they are represented by a gay lawyer (politics, you know...).  Dave goes along with the charade, tells his company he is gay, wins the assignment leaving Katherine jealous, knowing that Dave is NOT gay.  The remainder of the story revolves around the cat and mouse game between Dave and Katherine and Dave and Lucy's mutual attraction that interferes with his job.  There are many funny side characters who constantly comment on what the gay mind is like.  But the story ends well, with the film being a vaguely funny if very superficial view of what being gay is all about.

Not a great film but certainly an entertaining one.  Sort of an extended au courant soap opera, it works fairly well on the big screen, largely due to the sustained light touch with which it is delivered.  Grady Harp, December 05",1134777600,4,1859,4.703703703703703
8091450,4,B000BQYX4M,"Very entertaining and funny romantic comedy, plays a bit like a 90 minute version of Friends or Will & Grace but well-shot and many cinematic moments.  Acting was unusually strong, and the writing and pacing of the film were just right for the genre.",1134691200,5,250,4.681818181818182
8091451,3,B000BQYX4M,"I was not expecting much from this film, but was pleasantly surprised to find a ""cute"" romantic comedy with ""cute"" guys and some ""cute"" lines and situations. There are a couple of tender scenes, and I'm a sucker for tender scenes. No, it's NOT award material, but given the dearth of ""gay-themed"" flicks out there, it's worth a spin.  Decent date flick.",1134604800,6,353,4.693548387096774
