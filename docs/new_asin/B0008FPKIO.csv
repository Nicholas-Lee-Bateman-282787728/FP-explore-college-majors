2259449,5,B0008FPKIO,These DVDs ought to be required viewing in every classroom and every household in America.  They are extremely well done and absolutely riveting in exposing dangers inherent in the machinations that are driving our country.,1172016000,8,223,5.371428571428571
2259450,5,B0008FPKIO,"I originally purchased this collection because it was the only place that I could find ""Outfoxed,"" which I had wanted to use in my Introduction to Mass Media course.  However, I found that its contents covered more than just the Murdoch documentary.  ""Uncovered"" works well when the class is dealing with the chapter on Public Relations, in that it offers an in-depth look at spin control as well as crisis management.  ""Unconstitutional"" works increadly well with the chapter on Legal Ethics and legalities involved in mass media.  I haven't watched the bonus disc yet, but I highly recommend this collection to anyone teaching any type of journalism course.",1167868800,7,659,5.074074074074074
2259451,5,B0008FPKIO,"At the risk of sounding like an old salesman... You can't afford not knowing this information Period. The Documentaries here are of good quality and well put together, from start to finish. They are a great place to start /or good for adding on to your civic library.

They Discuss some weighty topics and glimse into things are being done around us/you with/without your consent. We spend a great deal of our time feeding into the madness by not voiceing our opinion by not voting etc.. But at what price? By and large a great deal of people have become complacent to the crap going on around them, and the watered down news they are spoon-feed.

Among other things it's full of the underlying message that ""things are just the way they are"". ""Don't bother"" there's no use trying to change things, don't rock the boat. But what purpose and who does this message serve? Selling has gone hi-tech from being in your face on the street to being beemed into your house packaged slick, all contrived by guys with Phds after their name. The big Corps. know how to get their message ""inside your head"".

Information is a product, and the best defense to be had by the best sales team that money can buy. Information begets Power.  Ultimate Power Leads to Corruption, and so on... (Also Check out the Movie ""The Corporation"") I think you know whos winning so far. It can be scary stuff to comtemplate for sure. And with threats that exist today on account of liberty we need to be cautious that our intentions are not misconstrued when we question authority figures.

But Look what just hapened with ENRON becuase of a very long Chain of people refused to question and demand proof of the spin that the CEO & Rank and file was putting out for years. This Chain included Many Bankers and Many Attorneys. For many years Enron execs. got away with it, until a young journalist stood up and said hey wait a minute! I understand very well how large corps. operate and what your telling me just dosen't add up! This young woman wrote an article for a magazine that got the whole ball to start unraveling! And in terms of the Business world she was a nobody! besure to see that movie (ENRON)too. It explains a lot of things as well.

Well, we really live in exciting times in more ways than one. Ha. Scary, maybe, Futile, no I don't believe so.

But, what you don't know about CAN hurt you and worse! Thats a fact! These Videos are a of a growing movement of people in all walks of life, that are trying to get out and share what they know. A veritable grass-roots movement, you'll never see these or anything like them on television. If you can't afford the money or the time to read all the books being written on these subjects,there are so many these days. Than videos like this are a great alternative. Many of the Facts and topics discussed can be verified and check to a great degree. A lot of Videos like this one use footage taken right from the news and reports that didn't get aired twice before they were yanked. A lot of people are connecting the dots. And lets face it videos are way more entertaining to watch!

This set includes 3 DVDS plus a Bonus One with Lots of Extra footage. There are well worth the modest price.",1140220800,19,3220,4.455008488964347
8056278,5,B0008FPKIO,"These documentaries NEED to be seen.  Yes, they provide a view that may well be slanted or omit mitigating circumstance, but that doesn't mean that they should be disregarded.  The point of view is worth considering and then looking further for either confirmation or honest, factual rebuttal.  So far I haven't found any.",1440288000,,322,5.037735849056604

At some point, we must see and accept the truth.
Then, we must make choices.",1355875200,,109,4.5
8056280,5,B0008FPKIO,"I have had this collection for several years. The revelations of phone hacking by News of the World reporters in UK prompted me to watch ""Outfoxed"" again. Greenwald's expose of the Murdoch Fox News organization was just as relevant in 2011. You will want to share this collection with friends after watching. ""Outfoxed"" exposes the Murdoch media empire as an extreme right opinion molding network instead of the ""fair and balanced"" news network it claims to be. Greenwald demonstrates how Murdoch likes to do things on the cheap in his efforts to shape public opinion with talk shows without having reporters in the field. You will want to see other reviews for assessments of the other videos in this set.",1322697600,,706,4.891666666666667
8056281,5,B0008FPKIO,This is totally excellent!  I highly recommend it for anyone.  This was much better than I expected it to be.,1293667200,,109,4.4
8056282,5,B0008FPKIO,"You won't get this on the news for the most part.  Corporations don't profit when you're informed and that's why they control the news with heavy financing.  If you're a mindless sheep, this is not for you, continue believing in Santa Clause and seeing the world as flat.",1232323200,,271,4.625
8056283,5,B0008FPKIO,"This is a collection of what I'm calling Anti-Bush documentaries produced or directed by Robert Greenwald.  Unconstitutional actually directed by Renny de la Pena, is the outstanding documentary.  It blows one away!  It documents the loss of civil liberties after 9.11 by the Bush Administration.  I watched it with a tense feeling in my throat.  The law and the rights of Americans placed in the Constitution is very valuable to me.  This movie shows how much we have lost and it threatens our democracy.  The second best documentary is OUTFOXED about the bias in Fox News.  I agree with the assessment that Fox News is very biased but lately I would argue that the bias has spread to MSNBC, CNN and many news shows as they vie for ratings and popularity.  There is constant movement, noise, shouting and arguing in all news networks, yet real analysis and information is missing.  There are topics that are dismissed or not even addressed.  The loss of newspapers where most good reporting has gone on has contributed to the decline.  The third documentary was not very good in my opinion.  Uncovered is a frenetic and busy documentary about how Americans were lied to by their politicians before deciding to invade Iraq.  The extended interviews in the extra features section are far more insightful and interesting than anything in the movie which is confusing and one is very happy when it ends.  The forth DVD is a collection of extras for the collection.  They are not necessarily helpful or insightful.  Still for OUTFOXED and especially Unconstitutional are good documentaries to watch.",1225756800,,1595,4.93609022556391
8056284,5,B0008FPKIO,"Highly recommended to everyone in the US and outside, essential viewing for every American, especially those in generation Z (ages 21-28).  With education comes action... :)",1212796800,,173,5.653846153846154
8056285,4,B0008FPKIO,"Anyone who truly believes in Democracy, and not mindless nationalism or flag-waving, this is for you.  Outfoxed gathers together all the hypocrisy and right-wing bias of this so-called ""fair and balanced"" ""news"" organization in one DVD that even Bill O'Reilly couldn't argue with.  Unconstitutional is a heart wrenching account of the innocent people whose rights have been affected by the Patriot Act, and Uncovered tells the tale that every American needs to hear, the lies told by so many that led us into the Iraq War.",1209254400,3,522,5.058139534883721
8056286,5,B0008FPKIO,"His movies tell the truth, and he makes sure it is a fact, after he finds it. Get any movie he makes, it will be 5 star everytime.",1178409600,2,130,3.6785714285714284
8056287,5,B0008FPKIO,"All of Greenwald's films should be shown free at theaters and available at public libraries. In addition, movie stars should pony up their funds and pay for these films to be shown on network TV, or at least cable. Stick one of these in place of American Idol one night. Half the people would change the channel for their usual mindless fluff. But maybe half would watch and that would be millions of potential Americans who might learn, and hopefully engage in the political system.",1172102400,4,483,4.694117647058824
