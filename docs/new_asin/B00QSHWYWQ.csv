Andrews Blu-ray Review: In Total Recall [Mind-Bending Edition] Arnold Schwarzenegger finds himself facing an existential quandary. It is the 21st century, and the technology of the day makes it possible for fully formed memories to be inserted into the minds of unsuspecting victims. So is Arnold Schwarzenegger actually a happily married construction worker named Doug Quaid?

Arnold Schwarzenegger finds himself facing an existential quandary. It is the 21st century, and the technology of the day makes it possible for fully formed memories to be inserted into the minds of unsuspecting victims. So is Arnold Schwarzenegger actually a happily married construction worker named Doug Quaid? Or is Doug Quaid's whole identity a convenient fiction? Does he live on earth, as he appears to, or does he have another existence on Mars? Is he a person, or is he a dream?

$50 million dollars worth of exploding glass, blazing bullets, ear-splitting noises and sometimes clever, sometimes gut-wrenching special effects say that Arnold Schwarzenegger is no figment of anyone's imagination except, possibly, his own. Total Recall is a thunderous tribute to its star's determination to create, out of the unlikeliest raw materials, a patently synthetic yet surprisingly affable leading man. Melding the ever-more-workable Arnold Schwarzenegger mystique with a better-than-average science-fiction premise, the director Paul Verhoeven has come up with a vigorous, super violent interplanetary thriller that packs in wallops with metronomic regularity. Paul Verhoeven is much better at drumming up this sort of artificial excitement than he is at knowing when to stop.

Doug Quaid's troubles begin when he visits Rekall Inc., a space-age travel agency specialising in no-fuss, no-muss vacations. But when Doug, who is haunted by mysterious dreams of a red-hued life on Mars, agrees to buy two weeks worth of Martian travel imagery that is ''first-class'' and ''complete in every detail,'' something goes haywire. An apparently real set of memories is activated, throwing Doug Quaid's earthly existence into turmoil and eventually sending him to Mars to resolve his problems. Mars, he discovers, is a seamy, mutant-filled colony that is racked with rebellion and ruled by a tyrant Vilos Cohaagen [Ronny Cox] who charges exorbitant prices for air.

The first half of Total Recall (screenplay by Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon and Gary Goldman from a story by Phillip K. Dick) is the film's introductory phase, which toys ingeniously with gimmicks like household holograms and robot-driven taxis as it outlines the interesting confusion inside Doug Quaid's mind. This culminates in a riveting scene, the film's best, in which a doctor Dr. Edgemar [Roy Brocksmith] visits Doug Quaid in his Martian hotel room and tells him that he is still dreaming, and still in fact at the Rekall Inc. offices. When Doug Quaid fails to believe this, the doctor scathingly accuses him of being someone who imagines himself ''the victim of an interplanetary conspiracy to make him think he's a lowly construction worker on earth.'' At this point, the film provides some helpful guidelines for differentiating flesh-and-blood doctors from imaginary ones.

The visual style of Total Recall, which in its latter stages is loaded with gargantuan, greyish machine-shop imagery and filled with ever-more-sickening cosmetic touches, is wearing in its own way. Continually upping the special-effects ante, Paul Verhoeven saves the eye-popping and hand-severing for last, not to mention a mutant character who appears as a slimy infant troll attached to another character's stomach. Showing a foot stepping on a bleeding, quivering corpse is more characteristic of the film's violence. This sort of thing happens early, and often.

Opposite Schwarzenegger, Rachel Ticotin provides a tough, albeit somewhat bland, resistance fighter heroine, but her thunder is stolen by Sharon Stone as the wife who is tired of tolerating the stranger in her husband's mind. No doubt also tired of dull love interest roles in second rate melodramas, Stone throws herself into the part with real vigour and gives it a physical edge that at times makes her seem genuinely threatening even to the famous muscleman. Ronny Cox and genre stalwart Michael Ironside round out the villainous roles, whilst Marshall Bell and Mel Johnson Jr provide memorable turns as quirks characters Quaid meets along the way, and Robert Picardo is sadly the unforgettable voice of the Johnny cab.

With inventive stunt work and great set pieces, Total Recall is a triumph of visual effects design. It's funny, energetic and packed with genuine thrills. Yes, there's a large helping of cheese, but it only adds to the flavour. The games it plays with identity and reality sit intriguingly alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger's work in True Lies and Last Action Hero, and highly quotable lines help to secure its place in the blockbuster science. As a science fiction action adventure, Total Recall delivers as exactly that. Its filled with fantastic futuristic imagery, trademark Paul Verhoeven satire, and memorable Schwarzenegger antics and one liner.

Blu-ray Video Quality  LIONSGATE trots out this 2015 re-release Total Recall as often as they do Terminator 2, but the Total Recall remake has put them in a position to treat this Paul Veerhoven as a real tour-de-force. With this new scan, better encode 1080p image, and refreshed colour timing, this is the Blu-ray we should have seen with the dawn of the format. The transfer has been framed at the theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1. Where the Blu-ray disc comes alive is definition. Resolution feels greatly enhanced and focused with the close-ups meticulously consistent. The number of shots where Total Recall feels photographed yesterday is enormous. Its to the benefit of everything, from the wicked cool make-up effects to those astonishing miniature shots that show off the Martian landscape. Its all fine detail, all the time. As with previous inferior video editions of this film, with this upgraded image is truly an amazing experience. Sharpness, contrast, and colour saturation levels are good throughout with some of it looking good reference. The reds of Mars are handled quite beautifully with no blooming, banding or false contouring found in earlier inferior releases. Flesh tones have a natural appearance in tone. Black levels are good and well defined in depth.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio has also been reworked into a fuller, richer. Astonishing is the awesome Jerry Goldsmith score, which from the opening credits, lands those high peaks without so much as a flutter or strain. There are no signs of diminished returns in regards to age. Even when mixed in with the other elements or heavy gunfire seated above the music, its still perky, focused, and clean. The subway shoot-out places a few seconds of shattering glass in the rears but its so subtle that it barely registers. Much of the activity spreads across the front soundstage, enough to space out the effects and add directionality, especially with the rumbles with superiority, generous in its application to make ships rock the room, and explosions feel full. Even if its an after effect and not part of the original mix, the application is sound and natural. It doesnt elevate or feel out place. Pieced together with the score, it takes on another layer of effectiveness. This is the super deluxe final edition of Total Recall we have been waiting for.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Paul Verhoeven: This is the same audio commentary from previous releases. It's fun and often very informative, though there's a certain ""ick"" factor when Arnold Schwarzenegger talks about ""waking up"" next to Sharon Stone with few clothes on, considering the bad press he's had over the past couple of years. Both director Paul Verhoeven and star Arnold Schwarzenegger love to talk and often talk over one another getting out their words. Both pretty much narrate the film and also providing upcoming spoilers to later events in the film, but only rarely reveal some interesting anecdotes about making the picture.

Special Feature: Interview with Director Paul Verhoeven [2012] [1080p] [1.85:1] [34:46] In this all-new interview with director Paul Verhoeven and touches on quite a few aspects of the filmmaking process. He discusses the problems he had with the third act of the script, how much he enjoyed working with the Mexican crew, the storyboards used for the film, and with Rob Bottins expert help, especially with his insistence on Arnold Schwarzenegger for the film. Paul Verhoeven talks about walking the tightrope between dream and reality in the film, but he's also honest about third act problems in the film, even after 42 drafts of the script.

Special Feature Documentary: Making-of Total Recall [1990] [480i] [4:3] [8:23] This is a vintage feature, which has snippets of the film playing out in between cast and crew interviews. The brief interviews we have Paul Verhoeven, make-up effects supervisor Rob Bottin, and co-stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ronny Cox, and Michael Ironside.

Special Feature Documentary: Models and Skeletons: The Special Effects of Total Recall [2010] [1080p] [1.85:1] [23:14] This is a really interesting look at the then state of the art special effects of the film. Several members of the SFX crew are featured in this fascinating piece. We get introductions to miniatures supervisor Mark Stetson and CGI supervisor Tim McGovern who discuss their two departments in the making of the film. McGovern was one of four men on the special effects team who went home with Oscars for their work on the film.

Special Feature Documentary: Imagining Total Recall [2001] [480i] [31:28] This is another older piece documentary featuring interviews with the director, production designer William Sandell, screenwriters Ronald Shusett and Dan OBannon, editor Frank Urioste, stars Rachel Ticotin, Sharon Stone, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, effects supervisor Eric Brevig, and composer Jerry Goldsmith, all describing their years of work to bring the story to the screen.

Special Feature: Restoration Comparison [2012] [1080p] [1.85:1] [5:13] Here get a selection clips presented as a slide show, where you get to see the old 1990 inferior images, and you a get a white line slide across the image to reveal the 1080p pristine director-approved HD transfer.

Special Feature: Photo Gallery [1080p] [1.85:1] [1:03] Here you get to see loads of publicity images throughout the slide show, but a big bonus, you get the glorious Jerry Goldsmith Total Recall music in the background.

Theatrical Trailer [1990] [408i] [16:9] [2:07] This is the Original Trailer for Total Recall.

Sneak Peaks: Haywire [Blu-ray + DVD] [1080p] [2.55:1] [1:26]; The Expendables [Blu-ray + DVD] [1080p] [2.55:1] [1:12]; Terminator 2: Judgement Day [Blu-ray] [1080p] [2.55:1] [1:22]; Stargate  15th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray] [1080p] [2.55:1] [1:34] and EPIX  We Get Big Movies Promotion [1080p] [1.85:1] [1:18]. Unfortunately, this starts showing when the Blu-ray loads up and you cannot go straight to the menu.

Finally, with inventive stunt work and great set pieces, Total Recall [Mind-Bending Edition] is a triumph of visual effects design. It's funny, energetic and packed with genuine thrills. The games it plays with identity and reality sit intriguingly alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger's work on True Lies and Last Action Hero and highly quotable lines help to secure its place in the blockbuster science. Total Recall remains one of the best Arnold Schwarzenegger films, one that is smart but visceral. It may stretch the bounds of credulity as it kind of stumbles through a still awkward third act, but overall this is still an incredibly effective and impressive piece that blends an intelligent screenplay with some great looking special effects. While some may have some niggling complaints about not all of the previously released supplements having been ported over to this new release, otherwise this is a completely stellar effort that offers superior video and audio. I now feel this is THE ultimate edition to the Total Recall franchise. Highly Recommended!

6878123,5,B00QSHWYWQ,it was a great film when it came out even better now,1425600000,,52,3.4166666666666665
6878124,5,B00QSHWYWQ,"It's like a nightmare out of Kafka: everything you can remember is false, and everything you think you know about your life is a lie. Such is the dilemma at the heart of ""Total Recall,"" which also has the honor of being one of the best movies Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever made. A lot of this comes from the plot, which is full of memorable twists and clever plotting -- not to mention the glorious depiction of a futuristic Mars.

Every night, Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger) is haunted by a dream of Mars and a strange woman (Rachel Ticotin). He even wants to visit Mars, but his wife Lori (Sharon Stone) is reluctant. After all, Mars is going through a nasty rebellion at the moment. On impulse, Quaid decides to go to Rekall, a company that implants false memories for entertainment, and selects a ""secret agent"" fantasy on Mars.

But things instantly go very wrong when he has a convulsive reaction, and ends up dumped in a taxi. As he tries to get home, his coworkers all try to kill him -- and at home, Lori also tries to murder him, revealing that their entire marriage is a false memory.

Quaid goes on the run, with only a cryptic message from his former self to guide him. But even if he can get to Mars and avoid being captured by Lori and the cops, he has to find the mysterious Melina (who turns out to be the lady from his dream). And as he seeks out the mysterious leader of the Resistance, Quaid finds that there may be things in his past he doesn't want to remember...

""Total Recall"" doesn't stick very closely to Philip K. Dick's original story, but it doesn't shame it either. The story is delightfully unpredictable from beginning to end -- while you might be able to figure out quickly that Quaid is remembering lost memories of Mars, most of the plot twists after that are genuinely shocking. And underlying everything is the haunting question: Is any of this real?

This is Paul Verhoeven back when he was good, and ""Total Recall"" displays him at his best -- lots of action-packed fight scenes, gruesomeness (the removal of the tracker up Arnold's nose is especially gross), and an underlying current of humor that keeps things from ever getting too grim ("" If things have gone wrong, I'm talking to myself and you don't have a wet towel around your head"").

And lest anyone forget it's a sci-fi movie, most of the action takes place on a delightfully sleazy Mars colony where mutants walk amongst the normal humans. Example: Quaid speaks to a three-breasted hooker at a bar. And there's a subplot about a mysterious set of alien machines that only comes to fruition late in the story.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of those actors that is normally pretty mediocre, but is amazing when he's got a good script and direction. He overflows with humor and charisma in this role (""Consider that a divorce!"") and he has excellent chemistry with Ticotin. This is a hero you can actually root for, but we're also constantly reminded that we don't know the real man.

""Total Recall"" is a like taking a rollercoaster ride, with lots of wild action and thrills -- as well as one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best performances ever. Definitely worth watching.",1419206400,2,3170,4.618117229129663
6878125,5,B00QSHWYWQ,"This is the best print of the film yet; even the DVD render looks washed out and grainy by comparison. The audio track is strangely quiet though. Great dynamics in the mix- gunfire is punchy and loud while Mars dust underfoot is soft- but the title theme sounds unusually quiet. The menus have a nice snap to them and are laid out efficiently. Featurettes include a brand new Paul Verhoeven interview with a couple nifty documentaries thrown in AND a commentary track with Arnie and Verhoeven. As far as the film is considered, it has only improved with age, with Ronnie Cox portraying a money hungry corporate overlord I'm sure many of us could imagine sitting in Washington or Silicon Valley today. It's also great to see Arnie kicking ass while in his prime. Another thing I think really makes Total Recall hold up is that it's not a film which would ever be made today, and is all the more refreshing to watch for that reason.",1503100800,2,930,4.574850299401198

6878133,5,B00QSHWYWQ,"This is one of Arnold's best. Take a great lineup of actors. Throw in a good story by Philip K. Dick (screen play by Ronald Shussett, Dan O'Bannon, and Gary Goldman). Add a well designed set that make you feel you are there. And you have the makings for a pretty good movie. With a few exceptions it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad and with several plot twists it is hard to know if you should root for the good guy or the bad. A hint stick with Arnold and you can not go wrong (Maybe.)

Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) a mild mannered construction worker, who is happily married to Lori (Sharon Stone), and seems extraordinarily attracted of life on Mars. Now Mars is settled and basically ran by a mining consortium. And the least Douglas can do is take a vacation there. Discouraged by his wife he decided to take a virtual trip there.

Oh no, something has gone wrong. It turns out that unknown to him he is not Douglas Quaid. He finds out that his whole history is a lie. Now people are out to kill him and he must find out who he is and why. If he escapes, the journey will take him to Mars to fulfill his or someone's destiny.

There's an appreciable weirdness that somewhat honors the spirit of Philip K. Dick's writing, though the movie leaves a lot to be desired overall, and falls apart in the third act (this is something the director has actually publicly stated).

So, overall, decent. I would have probably had a better time rewatching RoboCop though (the original), which I think is a more compelling Verhoeven movie overall.",1471219200,,649,5.29126213592233

6878174,5,B00QSHWYWQ,"This original version of Total Recall (based loosely on the Philip K. Dick short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"") is far superior to the more recent remake starring Colin Farrell. This is Ah-nold at his finest, and surrounded by several other worthy co-stars such as Michael Ironside and Rachel Ticotin, and including the first breakout role for Sharon Stone. This version centers on Douglas Quaid (Schwarzeneggar), an average construction worker, who dreams big and wants to do more with his life, and is married to Lori (Stone), who tries desperately to convince him that he has everything he needs and is already all she needs.

But as time goes by, Quaid gets restless, and decides after viewing an ad to go visit a place called Rekall, where they use a machine to upload trips and entire memories into your mind, so that it feels like you actually went to these places and did the things. He has an obsession with Mars, and so asks for a Mars trip, with the added intrigue of being a secret agent. But during the implant, something goes wrong, and another personality manifests itself, and the crew of Rekall desperately render him unconscious and erase any memory he has of them.

From this point on, events in Doug's life start to mirror that of the adventure he chose, and he is caught in between believing absolutely that what is happening to him is real and not knowing if it's all a dream. The action is non-stop, takes place on both Earth and Mars, and involves a lot of twists, betrayals, characters changing sides at the drop of a hat, and Quaid having to decide whether he wants to be the hero he wants to be as Douglas Quaid...or the ruthless agent Hauser, who the ""bad guys"" claim is who he really is.

If you've not seen the original version of this--and have only seen the 2012 version--then you're missing out. The 2012 version never leaves Earth, and is much darker than this one, and Colin Farrell is no Schwarzeneggar. If you want Arnie at his best, then this is one of the movies that belongs in your collection.",1440288000,12,2049,4.592896174863388

8692623,4,B00QSHWYWQ,"Good enough restoration but if the Gov's people read such things, the commentary on this should be redone. Arnold hardly gets a word in because director Paul Verhoeven seemed to think he was supposed to narrate the film plot rather than talk about the making of the film. Schwarzenegger tries to steer him but the commentary essentially fails. That said, if you just want an inexpensive Blu-ray version for your home library this is a good buy.",1509667200,2,444,4.779220779220779
