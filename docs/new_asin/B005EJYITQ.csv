8468396,5,B005EJYITQ,"This is not a review of this DVD, but a plea to release this DVD in a format that will play in the USA.
As the info. states, this DVD will only play in certain worldwide DVD formats, excluding the USA.
One of the 2 movies contained on this is on my list of ""Most wanted DVD's.""  It is the Baron Munchhausen fantasy film variously titled ""Original Fabulous Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" or  ""The Fabulous  Baron Munchausen.""
Whatever the title, if it directed by Karel Zeman, it is a masterpiece of fantasy combining animation and live action to tell the tales of the Baron.  By animation, I do not mean cartoon.  I mean various techniques, including drawings similar to Gustove Dore illustrations, etc.  This movie is a one of a kind movie, unlike anything you have seen.  It is magical.
See my review of the VHS tape version, where I again plead for the release of this movie on DVD.  Is anyone listening?",1334620800,5,908,4.52760736196319
