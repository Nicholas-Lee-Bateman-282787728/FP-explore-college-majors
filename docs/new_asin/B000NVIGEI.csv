The quality is good and the price is right, a real bargin.",1303344000,,259,4.0588235294117645
8181731,4,B000NVIGEI,"If you own Mill Creek's ""50 Movie Pack: War Classics,""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-Classics-50-Movie-Pack-Collection/dp/B0001HAGWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection</a>&nbsp;then you already have these discs. And if you don't, you'd be better off buying the larger collection, which includes eight additional DVDs.

These four discs are quite good, and so is the quality. They provide a comprehensive overview of the war in both theaters.",1228089600,5,520,7.387096774193548
8181732,2,B000NVIGEI,"This 4-DVD set contains two Documentaries, but for some unknown reason, Millcreek Entertainment has changed the titles of them, superimposing new digital titles on the screen.  The two documentaries should be called ""Crusade in the Pacific"" and ""Crusade in Europe,"" but inexplicably they're retitled ""War in the Pacific"" and ""War in Europe.""

Also, Millcreek has placed their logo at periodic spots throughout each episode.  Since these are public domain documentaries, there's plenty of other, intact editions available.",1218240000,4,521,5.740259740259741
8181733,3,B000NVIGEI,"If your idea of good television is World War II documentaries on the History Channel, then you'll like this item. A lot of the films included are US propaganda films from the war years but that gives a different (if skewed) angle. The quality is decent. You might want to go for one of the lower-priced ""new and used"" ones.",1202428800,6,323,4.4
8181734,1,B000NVIGEI,"If you are real World War 2 Fan , you will not appreciate it. I think it is taken from some propaganda films done for the troops. I am very disappointed.",1187827200,9,153,3.967741935483871
8181735,5,B000NVIGEI,"The quality of the product is great. I just finished the first disc and am very impressed with the content, video and audio. It has been an eye opening history lesson for me.",1179532800,5,174,4.303030303030303
