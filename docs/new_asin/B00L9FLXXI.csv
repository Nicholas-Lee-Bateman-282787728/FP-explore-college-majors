Episode List;
Disc One: SPECIAL FEATURES; Deleted Scenes
1 ""One-Two-Three Go...""
The company that is the life's work of Walter Gillis is ripe for hostile takeover. Mike's plan to save it is derided as insufficiently ruthless by both Harvey and Jonathan Sidwell (whose investment firm is now a client of Harvey's and for whom Mike now works). After Harvey uses Rachel as a pawn to send this message to Mike, Mike responds by reviewing his representation by Pearson Specter and when Harvey's client Logan Sanders, a young man taking over his father's company, announces his plan for a hostile takeover of Gillis Industries, Harvey is forced to resolve a conflict of interest. He chooses to honor his obligation to Logan and drops Sidwell's firm as a client. Meanwhile, feared SEC prosecutor Jeff Malone visits the firm's offices unannounced and tells Jessica and Harvey that US Attorney Eric Woodall is resigning to become a senior administrator at the SEC and will use his power to pursue his vendetta against the firm by having Malone investigate their clients. Louis has already learned of this from Katrina and expects to be asked to save the firm due to his extensive litigation and financial expertise; what he does not know is that Malone is offering to leave the SEC and lead Pearson Specter's defense against Woodall in exchange for a senior partnership. Jessica hesitates, since Malone has ambushed her and is banking on their secret romantic relationship to coerce her. She initially plans to put Louis in charge of handling this, but after consulting Harvey, who is impressed by Malone's brash approach, she agrees to Malone's offer on the condition that their relationship become strictly professional. Meanwhile, Harvey is seeing someone, and Rachel is shocked to see Logan Sanders and tells Mike that he is the married man she had an affair with.
2 ""Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner""
On Harvey's advice, Logan stops quietly buying shares of Gillis Industries and rushes a tender offer on the company's stock. Harvey knows that Gillis is fully aware of the company's vulnerability to hostile takeover and has retained the services of an investment firm (i.e., Mike) to organize a defense strategy. Mike files a motion to request a TRO to block Logan's tender offer on the grounds that Harvey broke attorney-client privilege. Confronted about this in front of the judge, Harvey relents and tells her to give Mike the TRO. Having implicitly admitted to the validity of Mike's claim, the judge responds by not only granting Mike's request for a TRO, but by also placing a moratorium on Logan's company, disallowing any further purchasing of Gillis Industries stock, the latter as an additional punishment for initially trying to stall while in her chambers with Mike. This forces Harvey and Sanders to try to settle rather than continue to fight Mike in court and they offer a deal: $30 million for Mike to walk away and allow Sanders to acquire and dismember Gillis' company. Mike refuses and storms out of the settlement conference. Harvey reassesses the situation and decides to circumvent the negotiations and go to the head of the company's union with an offer of $500 million to the union's pension fund in exchange for his support of the takeover. Mike convinces Gillis that the only option to keep the takeover at bay is to match the offer, thus crippling his expansion plans. Rachel later suggests to Mike that he refused the deal due to macho posturing over her in front of Logan, but Mike insists he is motivated by principle. Meanwhile, Louis and Malone jointly interrogate a broker who claims that his windfall was due to an accident rather than insider information. Louis originally plans to leave the broker to be prosecuted, while Malone wants to save him if he is innocent. Donna accuses Louis of abandoning the broker just to spite Malone, and convinces him to change his mind. Donna then suggests to Jessica that Louis be given the coveted corner office instead of Malone. Unwilling to be seen giving her former lover undeserved special treatment, Jessica agrees.
3 ""Two in the Knees""
Sanders, frustrated that Harvey has not yet defeated Mike, proposes to hire a team of private investigators to dig up dirt on Mike and his past. Knowing it is likely they will discover Mike's secret, Harvey forestalls by telling Walter Gillis (whose son's death was apparently drug-related) about Mike's past with drugs, and Gillis cuts off relations with Mike. Still determined to save the company, Mike increases his own investment. Harvey plans to ask Mike to back down to keep his secret from being discovered, but Donna convinces him to make this request through Rachel. Rachel goes to Logan, demanding a favor in return for a lie she told to help him in his divorce proceedings, and gets him to forswear personal attacks on Mike. Meanwhile, Jeff's efforts to resume his relationship with Jessica lead to both she and Louis being repeatedly pulled on and off the broker's case. Louis is briefly convinced that Jeff is gay and writes off Jeff's kindness toward him as manipulation. Jessica finds a key piece of evidence for Jeff, but declines his personal advances. Jeff learns that Woodall is beginning his attack on the firm by issuing SEC subpoenas to seven of their clients.
4 ""Leveraged""
Sidwell confronts Mike, congratulating him for the bold move of buying 100,000 shares of Gillis Industries on his own like a real investment-banker, but giving him a one-week timeline to deleverage the firm, with failure to do so costing him his job. Harvey goes to see the now fired Eric Woodall regarding the subpoenas his clients are facing and learns that Sean Cahill directed the whole thing. Mike goes to Tony Gianopolous for money, but Louis intervenes as revenge for Mike's deception about Sheila and Mike is turned down. This turns out to be a double-edged sword: Louis' deliberately seeking a confrontation with Mike after Gianopolous turns him away comes back to haunt him. Mike turns to Charles Forstman, who has a rocky past with Harvey, for the funding. Forstman agrees with one major inclusion to the contract: when the deal closes, Sidwell be cut out completely. Both Harvey and Amy oppose this, the former as he has a grudge against Forstman and the latter as she is offended by Mike going behind Sidwell's back. Mike signs the deal anyway, as otherwise he would be fired by Sidwell as well. Jessica and Malone confront Cahill and convince him to drop the seven cases in exchange for Pearson Specter dropping their malicious prosecution charge against him. While they are celebrating their victory over the SEC, Harvey informs Jessica and Malone of Cahill's true intention, which is to force their clients to cough up dirt against Harvey. Malone is intimidated, blaming himself for not having seen this coming, and leaves Jessica's office. Rachel helps Logan Sanders with a major business decision, as his lawyer, and the two show some inkling towards rekindling their past. Jessica goes back to Malone's place again.
Disc Two: SPECIAL FEATURES; Deleted Scenes
5 ""Pound of Flesh""
Mike has second thoughts about betraying Sidwell, and attempts to use the threat of Forstman's money to get Harvey to back down, but Harvey sees through this immediately. Another firm needs to sell some Gillis Industries shares; Mike offers to buy them with Forstman's money and Harvey with Pearson Specter money. (The latter is from a $20M retainer paid by Sanders, part of Malone's ""questionable"" plan to circumvent the prohibition against Sanders buying stock in the company.) The owner sets up an auction between the two, but before it happens both Mike and Harvey rush to the hospital bed of Rachel, who has collapsed at school from overwork. Waiting for her to wake up, they share dinner and partially reconcile, but Cahill confronts them after the dinner and accuses them of illegal collusion. Meanwhile, Jessica has bought the shares, violating Harvey's promise to Mike. Mike meets with Forstman to decline his loan, only to find that Forstman forwarded the loan to Sidwell for the same deal. Donna gets help from Louis (who has memorized all the plays of Shakespeare) to learn her lines for a production of The Merchant of Venice and reveals her middle name is really Roberta. She contrives a situation forcing Louis to step in and play Shylock for one performance, overcoming a lifetime of stage fright. For closing night, Donna is joined by the ever-charming Harvey after Louis soulfully declares that he has decided to retire from the stage after his one performance.
6 ""Litt the Hell Up""
Louis tries to patch things up with Harvey, which, despite Donna's intervention, fails miserably. Logan gets cuffed by the SEC and when Harvey goes in, Pearson Specter's purchase of the Wexler block comes to the fore. Harvey can't come clean about it to Logan, as that would be labelled 'parking'. Meanwhile, Sidwell gets a whiff of the ""collusion claim"" and calls in Mike for further clarification. Mike conveniently bypasses any mention of his initial deal with Forstman. Things get even more complicated for Rachel with Logan when they kiss, but having confessed to Donna, she decides to keep it quiet. Jessica approaches Malone with instructions to go over the Wexler deal so as to immunize it from rigorous SEC scrutiny. When he declines, she turns to Louis, who masterfully finds a technicality to invalidate the sale, so that the shares will go back on the market with no connection to Pearson Specter. Mike proposes to buy Logan out with a generous offer, but on Rachel's suggestion adds the condition that as soon as the deal closes, Harvey goes back to being his lawyer and Logan must look for new representation. Logan and Harvey at first refuse, but then when given the choice of who to keep, Harvey chooses Mike. Logan is enraged and rejects the entire deal. Harvey goes over Mike's head to cut a deal with Forstman but fails to do so, as Forstman has already bought the Wexler shares. Again Harvey feels betrayed by Louis, who unwound the sale before consulting him, against Jessica's instructions. Finally, Louis steps in to save the day for Harvey by convincing Forstman to sell those shares to Logan Sanders, leaving Harvey hugely impressed. Mike is shattered to hear this and spits on Forstman's job offer. Louis later tells Katrina that in order to help Forstman avoid taxes, he illegally made the sale himself through foreign banks without reporting it, violating his principles in order to retain Harvey's approval. Forstman tells Sidwell of Mike's initial plan to cut him out and an infuriated Sidwell fires Mike. Rachel makes up her mind to confront Mike about Logan and herself, against Donna's advice.
7 ""We're Done""
Mike is still reeling from the loss of his job, the takeover battle and the fact that he went behind Sidwell's back. On Harvey's advice he goes to see Stan (John Billingsley, recurring a Season 1 role), someone he knows to have been a fraud like him. Stan tells Mike that he found out the important thing in life is not how much money you make but who you spend it with. Mike then decides to start all over again with Rachel by his side, but when she confesses that she kissed Logan, he is devastated and goes to Logan's where they fight. A distraught Rachel turns to Donna while Mike stays at Harvey's. The next day, Mike waits for Rachel in the lobby of Pearson Specter. When Rachel hesitates after a question about her feelings for Logan, Mike tells her that their relationship is over. Later, Rachel vows to Logan that she is done with him for good, echoing Mike's ""we're done"", and declining to be his lawyer from now on. Although initially dismissive of Forstman's job offer, (even with a $1M signing bonus), Mike later goes to Forstman intending to accept it. Before he can do that, however, he runs into Louis, who has just signed a fee-receipt ensuring that Louis is implicated in Forstman's tax evasion if it is ever reported. To prevent Mike taking the job with Forstman, Louis hires him back at Pearson Specter, using a reward granted to him by Jessica for his work with Forstman. (After Jessica refused his first request of a named partnership, he had asked for extra vacation time and other flexibilities that might allow him to win back Sheila.) Harvey is happy and Jessica has to bend, since to refuse might revive Louis' suspicions about Mike's secret. Harvey dumps Logan as his client. Mike and Rachel meet at home, where he is packing his things. Mike tells Rachel that he needs some breathing space if their relationship is to have any chance, and that he will be also back to work the next day.
8 ""Exposure""
Rachel is staying with Donna, who admits she slept with Harvey and wanted a relationship, but he wasn't ready. Mike comes back as a junior associate and is shown his new office (Harvey's old one). Louis buries the fee receipt deep in the firm's stored records, but is visibly shocked to hear from Mike that Sean Cahill is trying to get all their files on the Gillis takeover. Mike and Harvey defeat Cahill's first attempt, and Mike refuses an immunity deal, but Sanders accepts a similar deal and waives privilege to allow Cahill to get just the files involving Sanders' dealings with the firm. This is fine with Louis, but Mike later proposes to release all the files voluntarily (as he thinks they have nothing to hide), which will bolster Pearson Specter's malicious prosecution case against Cahill. Louis is desperate: Forstman will undo their deal only if he frames Harvey for a similar offense, and Katrina's offer to forge the fee receipt could send her to jail instead. Mike determines roughly what is going on from Louis' behavior and tells Harvey, who wants to talk to Louis, but cant find him because Louis is on the way to him. Louis then goes to Jessica to tell her. Meanwhile, Rachel disregards Donna's advice and tries to talk to Mike at work. After a confrontation, she urges him to either come home with her or break it off permanently; they leave work together.
Disc Three: SPECIAL FEATURES; Deleted Scenes
9 ""Gone""
Louis tells Jessica and Harvey what he did. Jessica tries to stay calm but tells Harvey she will fire Louis when its over. Harvey is furious with Louis and won't listen to Donnas advice when she suggests forgiveness. Harvey meets with Forstman to try to undo the deal. Forstman wont, and when Harvey brings up an incident from twelve years ago it becomes clear that Forstman is able to also implicate Harvey in that deal. Cahill begins a round of depositions for the SEC investigation, endangering the employees. Mike comes up with the idea of starting to depose Cahill himself for the malicious prosecution charges. Jessica implores Malone to find some dirt on Cahill or Woodall, which he does. At the malicious prosecution deposition, Harvey reads a series of e-mails that suggests a pattern of Woodall targeting a person first and coming up with charges later. Harvey sees Rachel is first on Cahill's deposition list. Mike preps her, revealing lingering tensions between them. In court, Cahill reveals Jessicas relationship with Malone. Louis goes to the SEC to confess his deal with Forstman, with the purpose of protecting Pearson Specter by saying he acted alone. When he surprisingly returns to the office, he tells Harvey and Mike that he went to tell Cahill, but Woodall was in Cahill's office. He confessed to Woodall instead, who let him go. The reason, they deduce, is that Woodall has also taken money from Forstman. They cannot get at Woodall's bank records, but Louis realizes that Cahill can and will, if he is the overzealous but honest prosecutor he seems to be. With the threat from Woodall gone, Harvey, Mike, and Donna all plead for Louis to be spared, but Jessica still plans to fire him for his long series of insubordinate actions. Harvey asks to be the one to do it, but when he and Donna reach Louis' office they find his resignation letter.
10 ""This Is Rome""
Louis cannot get a job with another major NYC firm because his partnership agreement prevents him from taking any of his Pearson Specter clients. Mike's new task is to help the firm keep the business of drug company Versalife, which it must drop for anti-trust reasons. Harvey gets Louis a job with Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati, which he rejects, and then one in Boston, which he rejects after Sheila shuns his proffered love. Mike goes to Robert Zane and urges him to hire Louis; he agrees on the condition that Louis somehow bring along one Pearson Specter client. Louis learns about Versalife from Katrina and gets their account, which is legal because they are Harvey's client and only Louis' clients have been officially notified of his leaving the firm. Mike then gets Gillis to buy a portion of Versalife, which will bring the total value of the Versalife account below the anti-trust threshold, and in turn giving Gillis a chance to develop a promising anti-addiction drug. Harvey tells Zane that he will ""owe him one"" if he hires Louis anyway. Jessica, who had originally blamed Mike for the Versalife leak, now deduces that Katrina leaked the information and fires her. Katrina is fine with the news, knowing that Louis will hire her when he begins working for Zane, until Jessica tells her that Pearson Specter won back Versalife. Mike brings the contents of Louis' office to his apartment, including a mysterious key that Mike asks to know more about, but Louis rebuffs Mike's offer of support. Louis then realizes that Mike would have recognized the key were he really a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School. He confronts Jessica, getting her to admit she is a liar and a hypocrite, then threatens to expose Mike's secret unless he is made a named partner of ""Pearson Specter Litt"".
11 ""Enough Is Enough""
Jessica promises Louis that he will become a named partner. Louis meets Mike at his home with the news, and says he will make it his mission to force Mike into leaving the firm. He first buries Mike in paralegal work. Mike insists he won't give up, but he later needs Rachel's help to meet Louis' deadline. Louis acts like a king, offending everybody. He confronts Rachel, knowing she helped Mike, and says she is nothing more than a paralegal and she can't keep him from breaking Mike. Rachel insists that despite Louis' threats, she will become a lawyer, to which Louis agrees -- she'll become a lawyer in the same mold as Harvey, Jessica and her father. Robert Zane meets with Harvey and suspects Louis has something on Pearson Specter. He tries to use his ""favor"" with Harvey to find out what it is, but Harvey says there is no favor in play because Zane ultimately never hired Louis. Jeff Malone knows that Louis has something on Pearson Specter, because he had firsthand knowledge of Louis' crime regarding Charles Forstman. Jessica tells Jeff a story about covering up Daniel Hardman's embezzlement, and says Louis used this to come back to the firm as named partner. Jessica later calls Louis into her office and says he must sign a statement saying that he knows about Mike being a fraud. Louis objects, but realizes Jessica is right. He not only continued to work at the firm while knowing Mike's secret, he became named partner while having that knowledge, and he reluctantly signs. Rachel gets Katrina Bennett a job at her fathers law firm.
12 ""Respect""
Jessica tells Harvey about the lie she had to tell Jeff Malone, and the two try to figure out a way to get Louis to go along with it. Professor Gerard, the Harvard Legal Ethics teacher who humiliated Harvey by insinuating he is a dirty lawyer who will do anything to win, now needs Harvey's help with a case. Harvey won't take the case because he hates Gerard, but Mike convinces him there is a lot to gain if Gerard owes the firm a favor. The case involves Gerard being caught with $25,000 in cash by the TSA, which is not a crime but has caused Gerard to now be blackmailed. Mike finds that the blackmailer was told the cash came from a backroom poker game, which Gerard cannot testify to in court or he would be fired by Harvard. Jessica fills in Louis on what she told Malone. He says he'll play along, but only if she gives him one of Harvey's clients as a show of respect and a sign that all the names on the wall are equal. Louis wants Gerard, but Harvey says no because Gerard specifically asked for him. They argue and Harvey insists he won't give up any of his clients. Donna gets Harvey to relent, and she brings Louis the folder for cosmetics magnate Joan Walsh. She tells Louis it is a significant gesture by Harvey, because Walsh was his first client after he made named partner. Mike digs more in the Gerard case, and gets Gerard to admit he took the cash from a student as a bribe for fixing a grade. Mike meets with the student under a cover story that he is a recruiter, and forces the student to sign an affidavit stating the $25,000 was merely a loan to Gerard. Gerard meets with Harvey and tells him he knows there is no record of Mike attending Harvard. Harvey says that, thanks to Mike, there is no record of Gerard taking money to change a grade, so they're even. Louis makes a mistake handling Joan Walsh's current case, and Jessica confronts him because Walsh called the office and was furious. Louis throws his weight around with Rachel again, making her stay all night to help him fix the mess. Rachel says she'll do it, not because she owes Louis anything, but because she (unlike him) can put personal issues aside and get her job done. Rachel's work ultimately helps Louis solve Walsh's case. Walsh then tells Louis that she must be a difficult client, because Jessica passed her on to Harvey immediately after he made named partner, and now Harvey has passed her on to Louis. Louis confronts Donna because it's now obvious that her story about ""Harvey's first client"" was not genuine, and they argue about Donna's lies regarding Mike. Donna says she did it because they are all part of a team, and good teammates do what they can to protect other team members. Taking this to heart, Louis meets with Malone and, convincingly, puts on a show about using his knowledge of Hardman's embezzlement and Jessica's coverup to get his name on the wall.

13 ""Fork in the Road""
Jessica tells Harvey to make peace between Mike and Louis. Harvey takes Louis and Mike on a road trip to see his first client, McKernan Motors, saying he wants to give Louis 50 percent of this client's business to make up for giving him a client he didn't want. During the drive, Mike and Louis continually argue the whole way. Harvey tries to make them talk but they want nothing to do with each other. At a stop to fill up gas, Louis attacks Mike personally and they start fighting. It escalates to Louis choking Mike before Harvey intervenes to break up the fight. Louis and Mike work out their differences, apologize and seemingly reconcile when Louis tells Mike, ""You're not a fraud, you just don't have a law degree."" In flashbacks to when the firm was run by Daniel Hardman and Jessica, Louis and Harvey appear to be friends. Louis comes to Harvey with an idea that will convince Hardman to make them both junior partners, as they are the top fifth-year associates at the firm. Hardman refutes the original offer, but says he will promote one of them if he can land McKernan Motors. Louis refuses, saying they are a team, but Harvey quickly accepts the challenge. Harvey manages to charm Avery McKernan, but Avery has court the next day. He tells Harvey if he does well in court, he'll become Harvey's client. It turns out the offer from Hardman was a ploy to land rival Fletcher Motors, which is a three times bigger client, causing Harvey to go to Jessica as he had given Avery McKernan his word that he would be loyal. Harvey accuses Hardman of giving away his courtroom strategy to the other side. He then learns that it was Louis who did so, as Hardman promised Louis junior partner if he would ""get in line"" with the firm's plans. Louis and Harvey end their friendship, both claiming that the other betrayed him. In another flashback, Trevor invites Mike to move in with him, saying that he'll even pay Mike's rent for a year as payback for Trevor getting him kicked out of college, but the idea doesn't sit well with Mike's grandmother. Mike meets an NYU law student and legal intern, Claire and manages to get a date. He lies to her and says that he is in law school at Columbia. He helps her with a case, but Claire's boss catches Mike's lie and tells Claire, who breaks up with him. Back in the present day, Harvey tells Louis that he is giving the other 50 percent of McKernan Motors to Mike. A united Louis and Mike walk in to McKernan Motors together for a meeting.
14 ""Derailed""
Mike meets with Professor Gerard who, after telling Mike he knows he never went to Harvard (in contrast to what Harvey had told Mike), urges him to take on a humanitarian case helping the families of victims from a deadly train derailment. Mike meets with factory worker Joe Henderson, who has left the rail company, and Henderson tells him the derailment was caused by inferior heat sensors that the company brass knew were faulty. Harvey tells Mike to drop the case, as their corporate clients don't like to work with firms that also handle whistleblower cases. Mike insists this is personal and he has to pursue it, and Harvey reluctantly lets him continue. Mike meets Evan Smith, Liberty Rail's legal counsel, who laughs off his claims and tells Mike to check the background of his witness. Mike indeed finds out that Henderson had been a whistleblower at three other jobs and confronts him again, but Henderson tells Mike this one is legit. Donna tells Mike if he truly believes the claims, he should get his hands on the company testing data, and she even offers to help him do so. Armed with the data and accompanied by Harvey, Mike meets with Evan again, who is shocked and surprised that they were able to obtain the company report. Harvey gives Evan 24 hours to come up with a settlement amount, which must also include an admission of wrongdoing. At the firm, Malone asks Jessica to accompany him on a trip to Paris, and says ""I love you"" to her for the first time. Meanwhile, Louis is upset that the company receptionist is still answering the phone ""Pearson Specter"", only to find out that Malone was the one who instructed her to not include ""Litt"". Jessica meets with Malone, and says she really needs him to get past Louis' blackmail, both for her and for the good of the firm. Malone meets with Louis to mend their differences, and agrees to meet him for drinks after work. Jessica tells Harvey she wants to tell Malone about Mike, for the same reason Harvey told Scottie (which she had already deduced). But when she goes to see Malone, he has figured out the Hardman story is a lie because Louis ""can't handle his liquor"", and he is furious, saying he's done with her. At the end of the episode, Harvey is visited by Evan. She reveals photographs that show Donna illegally obtaining evidence on the faulty sensors. She says that not only does this make the evidence inadmissible, but that Liberty Rail plans to prosecute both Donna and Pearson Specter Litt for the illegal action.
15 ""Intent""
Evan Smith's recording not only ruins Mike's case, but also puts Donna in the sights of the District Attorney Wolf (Chi McBride). Mike has to reluctantly tell Henderson they cannot get him his check and day in court, because they got their evidence the wrong way. Mike then helps Harvey realize that Smith would have to prove Liberty Rail was damaged by Donna's actions, forcing Smith to testify in court about the information on the heat sensors. This makes the case for felony fraud thin. Harvey gloats to Smith, in front of Wolf, that they can only make a case for ""criminal intent"" against Donna, which the DA's office never does. But to Harvey's shock and dismay, Wolf does decide to pursue a criminal intent charge against Donna, mainly because of his disdain for Harvey. Mike tries to approach Henderson to get him to testify, but Henderson has been bought off by Smith and Liberty Rail. Their options running out, Mike and Rachel visit the driver of the train that derailed. Although the company terminated his employment, they still gave him his severance and retirement money. But the man is distraught, thinking it was his fault that several passengers were killed. Mike and Rachel assure him it was not his fault, but they need his help to prove it. This ultimately gets Smith and Wolf to drop the charges against Donna. Meanwhile, Jessica consults her sister Leah for help in handling her breakup with Jeff Malone. With Leah's urging, Jessica approaches Malone to mend their working and personal relationships, saying she truly does love him. Malone later visits Jessica in her office and hands in his resignation, saying that Jessica was right, and if they can't be together on a personal level, they can't work together either. The episode ends with Harvey in Donna's apartment, where he confesses to her, ""Anyone else ever loses faith in me, it doesn't matter. But with you, it's different."" He pauses, then decides to leave. Donna asks him why and he answers with, ""You know I love you, Donna.""",1461196800,,29528,4.765866041788713

6476814,3,B00L9FLXXI,"This originally excellent series began degenerating into soap opera near the end of season 3.  There remain some interesting legal situations. Still, as the seasons progress, the interpersonal, soap opera situations overwhelm the base story.  It seems as if the original writers ran out of ideas or were replaced by writers of daytime TV.  For people who are supposed to be intelligent, they do not comport themselves well.  We watch stuff to find excellence in human beings, usually.  The excellence in the characters has diminished.

6476861,5,B00L9FLXXI,"Season 3 wasn't quite as good as the previous ones, but Season 4 was easily the best.  Season 4 is brilliant! Mike Ross has started in his new career as an investment banker (and how awesome is his younger version of Donna secretary).  He brings an investment idea to Harvey and wants him to be their legal rep in the deal but Harvey tells him it's a stupid idea.  Then a millionaire who Rachel used to be a mistress with brings the same deal to Harvey and even though he immediately tells him he has a conflict, the client's money and importance to the Pearson Specter, means Harvey doesn't have choice. So we've then got Harvey going toe to toe with Mike for the first disc episodes, while Mike has to deal with his rival competitor wanting to destroy him because he's now with his ex and the pressure that puts on things with Rachel. Then we've got Neal McDonough playing Sean Cahill the same kind of ruthless character he is famous for doing this time trying to prosecute Pearson Specter, and ending up involving Mike as well.  After that Louis will shake up things like never before.  And then a mistake by Donna ends the season with some brilliant last episodes.

As always the webisodes in the extras are brilliant and funny.  Louis' puppet versions of himself, Donna and Harvey is the highlight!  There's bloopers and deleted scenes as well.",1441584000,2,1349,4.568464730290456

I have spent more than 40 years in the television industry on the network side (10 years with Program Practices at CBS and 30+ years in Broadcast Standards at ABC) and this is the ONE television series which I will not miss. Everything works - the actors are perfectly cast and excellent in their roles, the characters are well differentiated, the stories are interesting and fast paced and often take surprising turns - all of which keeps the series fresh. All in all, it is obvious that everyone involved in the production (both in front of and behind the camera) is giving 110% to make this an enjoyable and satisfying entertainment experience.

I'm incredibly disappointed with the distributors of this series.
But 1000 stars for the series itself!!!",1430179200,2,416,4.635135135135135

6477027,5,B00L9FLXXI,"This season picks up with Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) starting his new job away from Pearson Spector.  Hes now working in the world of high finance as a takeover artists for businesses helping with mergers and acquisitions, some of them friendly, some of them not.  One of his first clients is desperately trying to hold on to the business hes spent this entire life building against people who want to take it over.

And the lawyers working for the other side?  You guessed it, its Mikes old friends and co-workers from Pearson Spector as lead by his mentor Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht).  That just complicates life for everyone as they already know each others moves.  Caught in the middle is Mikes girlfriend Rachel (Meghan Markle), who also happens to be an associate working under Harvey.  Harveys secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) is still attempting to keep all the friendships from going nuclear.  Also this season, Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) gets a love interest who wants to work for the firm and Louis (Rick Hoffman) makes a decision that might destroy his life.

They actually played out the Mike as corporate raider story longer than I thought they would.  But that didn't dampen the season at all.  This show is always high stakes high drama, and that was the case again.  And since we saw both sides, it was hard to really come down on one side or the other, which was nice for a change.  Well, until the back half of the season, which picks up a new story arc from the back of the first half.

I actually did have an issue with a character in the back half.  Yes, I could see where they were coming from, but their actions were so self-destructive it was hard to watch.  Likewise, Im really over Mikes secret and hope they give that a rest for a little while.  Yes, I know that is the premise of the show, but Id like it to play a backseat to some other story line again for a while.

Having said that, yes, I did still love this season.  I cant turn away when this show is on the air, and the twists and surprises just keep coming.  I never know where a story is going to lead, and I love that.

And the actors are still in top form.  They know these characters inside and out and hit every note demanded by the scripts.  Thats not an easy task, and Im sure the actors are exhausted at the end of a day or work.  The results for us are completely worth it.  Plus they make their characters likable.  It would be easy to hate these characters at times because of what they do, but we always see the humanity behind their choices, especially as they deal with the consequences.

As usual, the season consisted of sixteen episodes, and they are presented here in their native wide screen and full surround.  Extras are light with just deleted scenes, a gag reel, and an extra called Suits Recruits: The Paper Trail.

Once again, the season ended with a surprise, so I am anxious to see where things go from here.  But in the meantime, I will continue to enjoy season four of Suits.  Its compelling drama done so well.",1430092800,7,3036,4.435804701627487
