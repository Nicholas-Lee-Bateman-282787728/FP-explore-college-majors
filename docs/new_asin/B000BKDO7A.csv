2421105,5,B000BKDO7A,"We used to watch Julia Child on PBS when we were kids, and my brother, sister and I all learned to cook along with Mom from this quirky lady with the warbly voice and indomitable sense of humor.

The great thing is now I can review some of her classics on DVD. For example, the Buche de Noel is very wonderful; a chocolate cake decorated with piped meringue mushrooms and something that really dresses up the Christmas table. Likewise, you can review the best method to make crepes, which we always find very versatile. For example, they can be filled with a chicken mixture and baked in a cream-cheese sauce or filled with seafood. They even make a decent manicotti with ricotta filling and tomato sauce.

I still use the Mastering the Art of French cooking books all the time, but these episodes of Julia are a real joy.",1261612800,4,822,4.510067114093959
2421106,5,B000BKDO7A,"These are so enjoyable to watch!  Even though some of the recipes I have tried, I wasn't crazy about, she is the Master!",1260835200,,120,4.217391304347826
2421107,5,B000BKDO7A,"This is a humble collection of America's chef of all times, Julia Child. It contains 3 dvds with a random (there must have been a key but for a fresh viewer, it looks like random) selection of 18 episodes of her TV cooking show presented on TV in the 60s and 70s.

Though the espisodes were recorded and televized over 40 years ago, and most of them are just black-and-white, you would certainly not have a feeling that they are outdated. Well, the art of cooking is universal and timeless and if we speak of French cuisine, of which we should in this context, it is a classic view that Julia presents.

Julia Child shows you how to prepare vegetables, a roast goose, French savory crepes and even how to bake a piglet. You will see the very classic approach to cuisine, maybe with a little bit too much butter and too little olive oil, but maybe it is just the north-France approach where they cook with butter not olive oil :) Anyway, it is a new face of American cuisine inspired the French way by Julia Child.

A must-have for a fan of good cooking.",1258848000,6,1053,4.362244897959184
2421108,5,B000BKDO7A,"In an era when ""inspired"" American cooks were using unthickened Campbell's mushroom soup as a sauce, Julia Child was teaching viewers how to make the crayfish butter to bind the sauce for crevisses  la Nantua.

This wonderful series, only slightly dated by the occasional reference to the difficulty of finding certain ingredients, like shallots, which have now become commonplace, still provides an excellent demonstration of techniques and recipes.  And Julia's casual style and enthusiasm are irresistible.

My only complaint with this and the companion volume is that some fool decided to arrange the episodes by type of dish rather than chronologically.  Hence, one misses the nostalgia of seeing the development and gradual improvement of all aspects of the show.  In spite of that flaw, this a set to treasure.",1254182400,15,817,5.294573643410852
2421109,5,B000BKDO7A,"I have been waiting for years for these DVDs to appear. Julia Child was an amazing woman who inspired me as a young bride to cook. She was, in addition to being a superb chef, a wonderful teacher. Her techniques and the recipes stand the test of time. My daughter, an excellent cook in her own right, has heard me talk about Julia Child and now she has her own copies of both DVDs. My daughter had watched Julia Child as a guest on television shows but now that she has actually seen the ""Master Chef"" in action she appreciates why I have been in love with Julia Child for so long. Julia Child goes back to the basics of cooking, showing the techniques that you have to master to become a really good cook.",1200873600,32,706,4.237037037037037
2421110,5,B000BKDO7A,"This is a culinary time capsule.  I was one year old when The French Chef debuted on TV, and yet tonight I made the creamed spinach featured in the series, and not only was it simple, economical, and DELICIOUS (truly, like something I might have had in a restaurant), but it also used just a tiny bit of butter and a tiny amount of cream, and the rest was stuff you'd have on hand (plus the spinach).

This is an EXCELLENT way to be cooking (perfectly Atkins even).  I topped it off with two poached eggs, just as Julia suggested, and that was dinner.

So many recipes today require lots of ingredients and you end up using only a portion of what you have to buy (usually only to find the recipe wasn't well written, could have been improved, and wasn't all that worthwhile).  This is truly real-world and economical cooking, and even better than that, what you learn cooking one thing (in which you've learned a simple little technique and dish to add to your repertoire) transfers to cooking other things, and before you know it you're a good cook and INSPIRED cook, not having to stick slavishly to someone else's recipe, but just cooking based on experience.

There's excellent kitchen wisdom in this series to go along with the nostalgia, and I'm looking forward to trying more -- tomorrow for lunch, in fact.

It was also fun to hear Julia say things like that you could pick up a French omelette pan for $2.50 or so when the particular episode was made, and to correct herself to say ""brown"" a dish after saying ""gratinee"" and thinking (at the time) no Americans would know what she was talking about -- same thing with common cooking terms we know today like ""bouquet garni"" that Julia's audience was being introduced to for the first time but that today most any cook is going to know.  Additionally, Julia makes suggested wine pairings that I'm certain still hold up today.

This series was particularly good for the episodes on vegetables and eggs, as, again, you will have a small repertoire of things to try that are easy, excellent, and use ingredients you're likely to have on hand or can easily and economically pick up.

Enjoy.

2421111,5,B000BKDO7A,"Like the first, this too is yet another great opportunity to experience Julia at her best!  Bombard WGBH and tell them to release #3, #4, #5, etc.!!!  Also ask them to release episodes of the ""Julia Child"" of plants--Thalassa Cruso, star of ""Making Things Grow"" filmed on the same set as Julia!",1141776000,16,294,4.634615384615385
2421112,5,B000BKDO7A,"OK...........so my French vocabulary isn't that good, but this DVD sure is something to behold!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this visual Julia library!

I dream of the title of ""chef"" and there is no greater role model than Ms. Child. She is THE hero upon which all other chefs have made their fame in culinary history. Her style, her incredible deadpan humor, and her encouragement to learn one of the greatest cuisines, make for a thoroughly enjoyable DVD.

The series began in 1962 and initially the public did not know what to make of this rather tall and quirky woman who dared to teach us the culinary world of French cooking. To many, France was the only place that had the ability to cook as such. But Ms. Child removed the mysteries and overwhelming sense of details that one felt was needed to produce French masterpieces.

You feel that you are in her kitchen and that she is speaking just to you. She has no airs about her, no pretensions, just a very earnest interest in showing you the incredibe world of flavor courtesy of our French neighbors.

You also need to take into account that this was the first real TV cooking series and that it was the start of the 60's; so much history was just beginning during that decade. So what was she going to teach us in the midst of this turbulence? Well, an awful lot.

There are 3 dics within this particular DVD. The first section is named ""Starters and Side Dishes""; it covers:
  1. Vegetable: The French Way
  2. Vegetable Adventures
  3. Elegance with Eggs
  4. More About Potatoes
  5. Terrines and Pates
  6. The Hollandaise Family

The second section is ""Main Courses"":
  1. French Crepes I
  2. Cooking Your Goose
  3. Roast Suckling Pig
  4. Fish in Monk's Clothing
  5. Cheese Souffle
  6. Sole Banana Femme

The third section is ""Baking, Desserts, and Other Classics"":
  1. French Crepes II
  2. Buche de Noel
  3. Croissants
  4. Gateau in a Cage  (WOW!!)
  5. French Bread
  6. VIP Cake

Disc number 3 was the best, in my opinion. If you would like to impress friends with desserts, go with this one. The ""Gateau in a Cage"" looks so beautiful, that her fun and friendly teaching style makes you realize that it is not out of your reach to make this stunning dessert!!

Another enjoyable aspect contained within this DVD is in part her self-effacing, deadpan humor. She doesn't worry about that she has spilled anything or that something is not releasing itself from the pan just right. Mistakes and problems happen and she lets you know that it happens to everyone, including herself. That's the beauty and comfort that is her secret. Just to give an example, who would think of using a sword to talk about cutting poultry? Why would ANYONE use a sword to talk about cutting poultry? Julia did.

Also contained on the jacket are photos of how the show had to be taped in that people had to be positioned just so on the set so that they could help her with certain segments but remain out of sight of the cameras lens.

I truly hope that they continue to make all the episodes from all her shows available as that would make quite a cherished DVD collection for anyone who loves to cook and/or bake.

To borrow from my queen: ""Bon appetit!"".

Addendum: A very, very grateful THANK YOU to a reader who asked whether there were printable recipes included and YES (!) there are; at the end of each disc are the recipes which can be downloaded; my deepest apologies for forgetting such an important section. These are the recipes that are included in the discs: (disc 1) eggs baked in ramekins/ molded eggs/ shirred eggs/ sliced potatoes baked in butter (disc 2) rolled crepes w/ shellfish stuffing/ shellfish crepes gratineed in a wine and cheese sauce/ braised goose (disc 3) Buche de Noel and croissants.",1135728000,178,3758,4.569069069069069
2421123,5,B000BKDO7A,"This is a memorable volume, and certainly worth considering.  She has already done many traditional French dishes in previous editions, but does spend plenty of time here, perfecting bread.",1457481600,,189,5.517241379310345

2421127,5,B000BKDO7A,"I just love this DVD.  It was so interesting and funny to see the very early episodes and how they pulled them off. Julia absolutely set the standard for todays cooking shows. I definitely recommend them. If you are a Julia Child fan, I also  recommend reading her Memoir,  'My Life in France' by Julia Child with Alex Prud' homme her nephew; and 'Dearie, The Remarkable Life of Julia Child' by Bob Spitz. You will really see that Julia's life's purpose was truly to teach us how to cook and develop a love affair with food,  as well as the wonderful loving relationship she and Paul Child shared.  My own Mother was an excellent cook, and my Father was a chef long before it became fashionable. So my love for cooking comes natural. My fascination with Julia all started while watching the episodes on PBS; and it really took off after I purchased ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking a couple of years ago. I have learned so many new techniques from watching this series regardless of the age of them. It just goes to show you that great French cooking techniques that produce amazing food, never ever grows old.  Addi E",1429142400,,1122,4.52970297029703

They episodes are teaching you to cook and it is a no nonsense style (if I had nickel for everyone who's mind was blown because I can make hollandaise... I agree with Julia, just do it on the stove and learn how to make an emulsion, practice makes perfect) but her inimitable style makes it fun and interesting. Skip some of the trash on Food network about diners and shows with poor grammar in the titles and by these. You'll love them!",1416009600,,606,4.269565217391304

She was intrigued, so I got her a copy. She taught a lesson on the Buche de Noel using this DVD, and then had them decorate their own cakes in class.  HUGE hit!

2421151,5,B000BKDO7A,These original Julia Child cooking programs are a HOOT!  They are laugh out loud funny. I can't remember having a more fun time learning to cook than when I watched these videos.

She was really funny and its great to see so much ad lib without all the smooth production. She was just a real person teaching how to cook like the French. We work on a boat and have to cook for guests all the time, so when we get a call for something special we look it up on her DVD selection, watch the half hour show, and get to cooking.

Picking favorite episodes is definitely tough because she gives you so much to think about and learn, but I'd say the ones I liked from this set were the Buche Du Noel and Sole Bonne Femme.

She had an amazing life and her cooking is timeless.  Her voice still annoys me but I like watching how she simplifies the French style of cooking for Americans.  As my dearest friend said, ""Julia taught the American wives how to really cook.""",1354320000,,412,4.527027027027027

2421172,5,B000BKDO7A,"I have both this DVD set and the first one.  Both sets are collections of selected episodes of The French Chef.  While wildly entertaining (Julia Child is a born performer!), the episodes offer a tremendous amount of knowledge and information directed at the home cook.  What I love about watching these is how Julia Child recognizes that cooking doesn't always go as planned, so just carry on.  She can't find her flour, she's fiddling with her reading glasses, etc., but always teaching the viewer with her characteristic passion.  I watched some of her shows (Baking with Julia, Julia and Jacques), but very few of The French Chef (perhaps a handful of the ones in color filmed in the 70s).  So, for me, watching this is a delight.  And even though I'm a reasonably good cook who is very comfortable in the kitchen, I have learned new tips on these.  Indeed, I celebrated her 100th birthday both by cooking and by watching these episodes.  Definitely a must-have for the Julia fan!",1345161600,,984,4.741176470588235
2421183,5,B000BKDO7A,"These `The French Chef' DVDs give us 18 episodes of this landmark Julia Child PBS series organized by course rather than by chronology.  These confirm what we have read in Julia Child's biography that the early shows were Herculean feats of improvisation in front of a live TV camera in an improvised Boston (WGBH) studio, where there was no opportunity to edit out mistakes.

These episodes show how Child really set the standard for the TV cooking show and invented almost all the conventions we see nowadays from the likes of Paula Deen, Giada DeLaurentiis, and Emeril Lagasse (in his no-audience `Essence of Emeril' shows). It also shows where show creators such as Alton Brown and Rachael Ray have created great shows primarily by breaking out of Julia Child's prototype.

While the contemporary TV culinarians still follow Julia's lead, it is amazing to see how so many of Julia's shows still do a better job with their subject. For starters, you get the full 30 minutes of material per episode. You don't get 22 minutes of material with three interruptions for commercials and promotions. You also get complete shows on a single dish, albeit relatively complicated dishes like the classic `Salade Nicoise'. After four years of watching the Food Network virtually on a daily basis, I recall no show, even from the more classicly oriented hosts such as Martha Stewart or Ina Garten, dealing with a complete composed salad.

In contrast, the modern 22 minute culinary shows are often used to demonstrate three or even four different dishes, which leaves very little room for expounding on less common techniques. If nothing else, the art of the swapout has been mastered to the point where one may be surprised to see any real cookng at all. This is one reason why I respect Rachael Ray's demonstrations, as she is clearly always working in real time.

One possible negative aspect of this show is seen on some episodes where Miss Julia gives us the traditional French method which has really been discarded by almost all modern chefs. One example which comes to mind is on her demonstration of trussing a roasting chicken. Every modern American writer I have seen, including even James Beard from 30 years ago, does not bother trussing a chicken in any way. They simply tuck the wing tips under the body and may suggest tenting the breast with aluminum foil or draping it with bacon so it does not become too well done while the slower cooking dark meat finishes.

Even this show, however, has its virtues, as when Julia shows us how to detect when a bird has gone past its prime by checking the bone on the tip of the breast. If it is fully bony, the bird is probably well over a year old. If it is still soft, the bird is still between 9 and 12 months old.

Julia Child had no inhibitions against doing messy kitchen tasks.

2421185,5,B000BKDO7A,"It's so wonderful to have  video archive of Julia's first shows.  She really inspired me to start cooking, like the  rest of the country.  I will treasure these recordings.  Unlike today's pale imitations, Julia really taught you HOW to cook.  To her cooking wasn't drudgery but a joy.  I heartily recommend all her videos to people who are not into ""fast food"" but real food prepared with a loving heart and joie de vivre.",1313539200,,423,4.635135135135135
2421186,5,B000BKDO7A,"I would recommend this Dvd if you are an aspiring Cook or an experienced one. There is a lot of valuable information on Julia's French Chef TV Series. A small portion of it may seem a little outdated, as most folks are not cooking Tripe these days, especially a WHOLE one, but still, it is amazing to see her knowledge and fearlessness in handling all such foods and methods. She truly did Master the Art of French Cooking and through this ground-breaking PBS series, bright it home to the American kitchen. She is so friendly and real- without pretension that she truly instills the confidence that ""if she can do it- YOU Can do it too"". There is a mixture of 18 Black & White and early Color episodes going back more than 40 years. The basics of good cooking techniques never change, except perhaps for the handling of a few vegetables.
This is part 2 of a Video Record of how she won her way into the hearts of millions of fans and followers, for nearly 50 yrs now. Thank you dear Julia- we still and always will love you!

2421188,4,B000BKDO7A,"--cooking instruction on television, that is. It is interesting to compare the episodes of _The French Chef_ with the present-day productions of the cable television networks. My, things have changed: some things for the better and others not so much so. One thing that really stands out is that these episodes are preserved as their original, live presentations. There are no retakes, even when the recipe does not turn out as intended, or Julia loses her train of thought or makes mistakes. You don't see that kind of real life cooking today, but I think that adds to her charm. For me, it makes her seem more authentic; that you are seeing her as she really is (or was).

I own both this DVD set and the first. It seems that not all of the episodes are present; perhaps some have been lost. I would very much like to see that one that Julia mentions where she demonstrates how to make pate-a-choux.",1295654400,,901,4.561728395061729
2421189,5,B000BKDO7A,"I'm sorry, but I cannot see the appeal of current Julia wannabes like Giada, Nigella, Rachel, etc.  Julia was the best at her craft - she knew how to do it and do it right and in a way that appealed to the average wife/mother/womnan-on-the-go.  Certainly Julia was the catalyst for the current crop of celebrity chefs; however, there was an openess with Julia that radiates through her shows; unlike someone like Ina Garten, who just leaves me feeling cold and distant.  So, foodies, enjoy your uppity celebs who happen to cook - I'll keep my Julia, simply because she was the best!",1272499200,6,582,4.631067961165049

The chefs of today really evolved from what Julia started. Rachel Ray, Martha salt over the shoulder, Julia, unsalted butter Julia, techniques shown us now on TV from Julia.  Food Network really came from her.  Enjoy the shows and order them today.",1269388800,,510,4.489130434782608

It was so inspirational watching her make croissants from scratch and souffls.  All of her recipes are rendered with such charm, making this disc irresistible.  She really does make people want to learn not only how to cook but how to cook better.  I recall my Mom watching her back in the 70's and feverishly writing down her recipes so she could try them out on us.  They were always so delicious.  No wonder I thought my Mom was the greatest cook; she was imitating Julia Child week after week.

Thanks, Julia.  You've made the culinary world more understandable for the average person and much more enjoyable.",1264896000,2,715,4.53125
