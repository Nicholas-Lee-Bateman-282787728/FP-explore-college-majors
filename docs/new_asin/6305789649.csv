1072146,3,6305789649,"Evil Dead Trap is a dark, gothic, and gruesome cult classic. If you are a horror fan, you will notice alot of familer scenes and styles that the director adapted for the great look of this film. The film starts out fast and slows down halfway through. The first 45 minutes we are witnessing multiple gruesome murders at breakneck speed then the film slows down and follows the lead character Nami. At this point, the film uses fear and style to keep the movie rolling. Some scenes will almost seem like rip-offs such as fast moving perspective shots (a la Evil Dead) and a scene with maggots falling from a ceiling (Suspiria) but I think these scenes are done out of tribute and respect before plagerism. I did enjoy this movie and I do recommend it to serious horror fans but I did dislike the ending. Others may like the ending and it sort of reminds me of Dario Argento's style of twisting the story out of control at the last minute but here it is just a gooey way of bringing a final shock. Some of the violence in this movie is a little over the top for me too but that is a personal preference. I usually have a high tolerance towards gore but I had a hard time watching the first murder on the videotape sent to Nami. I also wasn't fond of the scene where Rya gets raped and then drug over the top of the car and dropped on her neck/head. Besides these small things, there was still alot to enjoy here and it had the potential to be a classic but only falls a few millimeters short so I still recommend it.",1008374400,3,1514,4.260416666666667
1072147,3,6305789649,"I turned off the lights and settled into my recliner in great anticipation, finally being able to see this legendary Japanes horror film.  The first few minutes were shocking and graphic (oh boy) but somehow without any real feeling of dread or fear.  But good effects.  What followed was a somewhat hollow exercise in Dario Argento worship.  The soundtrack music even sounded like an Argento soundtrack.  The movie looks good and the lead actress is a startling Sigourney Weaver look-alike, but Evil Dead Trap failed to grip me.  Although the set piece murders were accomplished, they failed to scare me.  Phooey.  It has all the (seeming) Argento style, without any of the substance.  Listening to the director's commentary, which is almost unintelligable due to his very thick accent (subtitled would have been better), only confirmed my worst fears.  All the style is just that.....style.  At one point he said he used yellow lights and gells and then switched to blue because when watching heavily yellow scenes, the eyes wants to see blue!  Argento's color coding is grounded in a thematic structure....Evil Dead Trap's color coding is just pretty colors.  At the end of the film there is a hail of mica.  The reason, according to the director?  ""It looks pretty.""  Hum.  One thing a horror film must have is a logic.  It has to make sense.  It can be loony, but it must make sense in it's loony cinematic world.  The ending, with the ""other"" murderous being, seemed tacked on and frankly I never could understand it.  What the heck was that?  And how did it morph into the heroine?  While not a total failure, the movie is sort of fun, but don't expect anything memorable.  This is definate drive-in stuff, and it succeeds on that level.  But (minor) masterpiece?  Not even close.",995932800,8,1787,4.815181518151816

Fulci, Argento, Evil Dead fans - and horror fans in general will dig this, even if it takes a few viewings to really feel it. Check out the 'crossbow scene', and tell me if that isn't great.

1072231,5,6305789649,"""Evil Dead Trap"" (Shiryo no Wana) proves that sometimes you've just gotta give a bad flick a second chance.

I wasn't in a receptive mood when I first watched this infernal juggernaut of grue and carnage, or maybe I was too doused in firewater to appreciate it. Whatever, I thought the film was godawful: slow, dull, meandering, not shocking at all. An hour in I hit STOP, and nearly returned it.

What a mistake that would have been. I gave it a second chance, and I'd like to warn you: you may find yourself grinding your teeth at tedium or stupidity, and decide ""Evil Dead Trap"" isn't your mug of blood. If you find yourself thinking that, turn the flick off, wait a week, and try it again.

""Evil Dead Trap"" is like diving through a dumpster in search of a bottle with a few ounces of the old rotgut, and coming up with an unopened bottle of Chianti. Or spotting a dog turd on your driveway, only when you return with the scooper it's actually a gold nugget the length of your forearm.

Or you've blown the dinner budget on firewater again, and as you peel back the lid of that tin of catfood, you realize it's full of Sevruga caviar.

Don't misinterpret my 5-star rating: Evil Dead Trap is not a masterpiece. In some ways---the dialogue, the pacing, the thin characterization---it's not even a very good movie.

But part of what I'm looking for is a flick capable of pushing the envelope and embracing the extreme; the sick, the soul-searing, the sordid, macabre and terrifying. I want a horror movie to break my jaw, sink its yellow choppers into my jugular, and rewire my neurons while it's slicing and dicing.

In Evil Dead Trap, I found it.

The plot is sleek and simple: Nami receives an anonymous videotape for her late-night reality TV show. Initially just a first-person account of a ride out of Tokyo: grainy, the tape is obviously shot by handheld videocam, depicting the travel route through the car's windshield, noting with meticulous care highway turn-offs and landmarks, finally arriving at what appears to be a derelict, abandoned military base. There is no commentary, and the identity of the filmmaker---and any accomplices---is not revealed.

The video cuts to the interior of one of the ruined buildings, zooms in on a young woman, hands suspended, chained, above her head: we witness the knife move down towards her eye, the blade arcing in to slice open the cornea, the lense. We watch her die,and at the last minute, Nami's face is superimposed on the victim's own.

Nami is intrigued. She and her crew decided on a little road trip, follow the directions in the video, enter the military base, split up, and prowl around. You can probably figure out what happens next.

Or can you? I'm willing to bet you can't---and by the way, the warped, completely insane little turn at the end warrants the 5-star rating. It's like happening upon a Demon wearing a zombie-mask: by the time you realize the old bullet in the head technique doesn't work it's too late. It's all about fear, my lovelies. It's like that troll beneath the bridge waiting for the Bill Goats Gruff: it festers, it simmers, it giggles down there in the dark beneath the stairway. It wants to hide, play, and kill.

It helps that Ikeda is a genius at pacing and wields a mean camera: the cinematography is alternately garish, gorgeous, vivid and lush, and unflinchingly clinical. The camera doesn't shake or reel away from the violence: it fixates on it, draws us deeper, forces us to look.

The location doesn't hurt things, either: virtually the entire flick takes place in the brooding confines of the abandoned military base, which quickly becomes a character in its own right. It is a sprawling, rambling labyrinth of corridors and hallways, control rooms and laboratories, chutes and shafts and tunnels, bleak, forsaken, rippling with rot and decay and maggots. Oh, and providing the Killer with plenty of places to hide, rig traps, brutalize victims undisturbed, and set up ambushes.

Ikeda devises some ghoulishly evocative setpieces that contrast nicely: the sere, shadowy, forlorn bleakness of much of the base, contrasted with the wan exterior shots, ruined outbuildings and guard-posts festooned and overrun with jungle or shrouded in thick fog---or even the baroque sickroom of the Killer's inner sanctum (festooned with dummy cadavers and mellowly lit by candle, it looks like something out of Brueghel's Hell).

If anything, ""Evil Dead Trap"" works because of its subtlety and sleight-of-hand. Director Ikeda has conjured up a true Devil's Playground, and caught his killing fields on film: we are at liberty to wander the grounds of this Kingdom of Darkness, at our own peril, and as the Hunted, naturally.

And then the questions: why does Nami's mysterious rescuer (Noboru Mitani)know his way around the base so well? Why does he talk about being confined in a small cell early in his life? Why does the Killer haunt a military base, and what sort of purpose did the base serve, with its storerooms and laboratories? What, exactly, went on here?

Oh, and one other question: while you've been reading this review, who has been turning the doorknob to your front door? And whose footsteps do you hear coming down the hall?

Welcome to the Devil's Playground.

1072234,4,6305789649,"Toshiharu Ikeda's ""Evil Dead Trap,"" a.k.a. ""Shiryo no Wana,"" quickly became one of Japan's highest grossing horror films. The film was so successful, if essentially unoriginal, that it spawned at least two sequels. I have seen a few Asian horror films in my time, perhaps not as many as other fans of the genre, but enough to enter into the whole thing with a few immutable conceptions about the genre. ""Evil Dead Trap"" nicely fulfills all of them. First, you just know the gore will achieve nausea inducing levels, and this movie definitely accomplishes that quite nicely. Second, you know that there is usually some ""message"" buried under the heaps of blood and guts, and there definitely is such a lesson in this movie. Third, something weird and unsuspected will almost certainly occur in the course of the film, and the conclusion of ""Evil Dead Trap"" definitely falls within the parameters of weirdness. So I expressed little surprise over the contents of Ikeda's film as the final credits rolled. The only thing that took me back was the 1980's type clothing worn by the main characters, especially the women. It's sort of funny in a way, but it makes the film look dated.
Made in the 1980s on an obviously shoestring budget, ""Evil Dead Trap"" tells the story of Nami, a television personality whose show airs videotapes sent in by its viewers. The voyeuristically inclined show, like all media, looks for tapes with that certain something that will boost ratings by thrilling the audience. When a strange tape showing a particularly brutal murder taking place in an abandoned military installation arrives at the station, Nami's curiosity gets the better of her. Assembling an investigative team, the ""journalist"" and her compatriots retrace the route shown on the videotape in the hope of getting to the bottom of the mystery. They do indeed find the location shown on the tape, a creepy, desolate series of buildings that could hide any number of gruesome horrors. Predictably, and in the fine American tradition of horror films, the crewmembers split up to investigate their surroundings. Within a matter of minutes, we learn some guy roams the grounds of the base gussied up in leather boots and a rain slicker. You just know our fearless team of journalists is in for a ripping good time, a fact proven by the increasingly gory killings that take place in the first half of the film. Through a series of ingenious traps and slash and stalk murders, the crew falls prey to punctured eyeballs, machetes slicing through heads, and a nifty pin cushion effect that would probably work really nicely as a new ride at a theme park.
Nami, predictably, survives while those around her fall to pieces. The poor girl is in a world gone horribly wrong as she wanders through the byzantine network of tunnels and hallways of the military base. Matters take a turn for the worse--or perhaps the better--when Nami meets a seemingly normal stranger from time to time also roaming through the sprawling complex. The guy appears to fear for Nami's safety, constantly telling her to get out of the area because his brother is a dangerous person who poses a threat to her safety. Nami learns exactly what her predicament is when she meets the ""brother"" of this man in a conclusion sure to confuse. Amidst mysterious explosions of sparks and light (where did those come from, anyway?) and lots of gluey gore, Nami uncovers the mystery she and her companions so desperately sought. We also learn why the brothers chose to send the videotape to Nami and why they wanted her to come see them. What started out as an effective slasher flick turned into, by the conclusion, an enigmatic supernatural film that made little sense. Oh well, I have seen better films take much worse turns than this one did.
I think the value of ""Evil Dead Trap"" comes not from its by the numbers slasher elements or the strange conclusion, but from director Ikeda's camera techniques and the use of very convincing gore. The killings all look realistic and nasty in their implications. It seems, although I have little proof, that Ikeda borrowed elements from such masters of the grotesque like Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento to construct his own brand of onscreen violence. And why not? If you want to make a gore film, you should consult those farmers who have plowed the field before you. Even more interesting than the gore is the director's intriguing camera work. I had to recheck the date of ""Evil Dead Trap"" because many of the techniques seen here are standard fare today: the use of quick cutting, hyperzooming, and negative photography all look as though Ikeda lifted his style from the late 1990s or early 2000s. This may be the earliest use of such cinematography I have seen. If it is not the first, it is one of the earliest. This aspect of ""Evil Dead Trap"" makes for a captivating viewing experience even as the plot disappoints.
Synapse Films brought us the DVD version of ""Evil Dead Trap,"" which is not surprising considering the offbeat movies this company releases. This release has a commentary from the director, some trailers, and a widescreen presentation. The picture quality is a bit of a mixed bag, as I thought some of the scenes looked slightly soft and a tad grainy. On the other hand, scenes shot in semi-darkness looked good. You can clearly see all of the gore scenes, which is the most important thing for this type of film. If you enjoy ghastly Asian cinema, add this one to your list.",1074297600,4,5484,4.791974656810982
1072235,4,6305789649,"I'm getting tired of the constant negative reviews of this movie. The whole point is to serve as a tribute to Argento,Fulci, and Rami, not rip them off as so many reviews have stated on here.

Anyone offended by the film's mysoginistc angle obviously haven't seen Argento's ""tenebre""! When you come down to it, the movie delivers what you're promised: Gore, a sadistic killer, and atmosphere o plenty.

That being so, this review may be helpful from the viewpoint of a casual viewer, and is hopefully taken as such.
I watched ""Evil Dead Trap"" on a whim, hoping to see a Japanese horror flick around Halloween time.  I must confess, I wasn't prepared for the sheer brutality of some of the scenes, including the aforementioned injury to the eye motif.  Not quite a slasher film and not quite a psychological horror film, there are elements of both.  Something along the lines of ""Silence of the Lambs"" combined with the gore and violence of a ""Friday the 13th"" movie.
The opening half is definitely superior for to the second, with the brutal videotapes captivating my attention, as well as that of Nami.  However, the more the movie tries to explore the connection between the killer and Nami, the more obscure the plot gets, and the more difficult it is to stay interested.
All in all, it is not a bad film, but not a very good one either.  The high level of explicit gore might be a barrier to casual horror film watchers, and the dense plot might be a barrier to those hoping for a good slashing.

It WAS well directed, comparable to Dario Argento in particular in style and storyline.  Nothing wrong with homages, but Argento, for all his own misogyny, is more even handed with the violence in his movies, showing men having graphic and terrible deaths.  EDT seems to focus more on violence against its women, with only one on-screen male death that is extremely quick.  I got caught up on EDT's surreal horror, but afterwords, when thinking about it, realized it didn't answer an essential question posed in the film: why does the killer kill, and why does the killer enjoy it? Because of this, the film becomes an empty misogynistic exercise.  But it sure do look pretty.",1065657600,2,818,4.685314685314685

There is not one single moment of horror OR suspense. This was undoubtedly one of the dumbest & most dissapointing movies I've ever seen. Every scene is stolen from other horror movies. And it's all so predictable. Do they actually think people are scared when a light falls down from the ceiling, or when one of the characters jumps out of the closet in attempt to scare another character? Give me a break. And how BAD is that 80's synth pop tune which literally plays every single time something ""creepy"" happens?! It is apparent this director knows nothing about creating tension or atmosphere. There was stronger tension in the rolling credits of the French movie ""Irreversible"". Not to mention that there are spoof-horror movies from mid-90's Hong Kong which are immensibly more clever and gory than this. The worst part about this film is that it takes itself so seriously that it can't possibly be amusing. Compare it to Evil Dead II. EDII is a film so drastically better in every single way, yet it still had the wit to parody itself a little bit and make us laugh till our stomachs hurt.

1072239,1,6305789649,"What can you say about the cultural awareness of the horror genre in Japan when you consider the most successful horror film made in that country to date is ""Shiryo No Wana,"" otherwise known as ""Evil Dead Trap,"" a low-budget attempt at scares that rips off the most respected works of modern horror on an international scale?  I would say it's about time to expose oriental audiences to the very films this amateurish tripe is derived from and see how long that title holds.
""Evil Dead Trap"" is probably the most derivative work of cinema ever produced in ANY country.  Even the theme music is so closely derived from the works of Goblin that I can't believe they haven't tried to sue.  It mimics the music from Dario Argento's ""Deep Red"" and ""Suspiria"" so close as to make the comparison laughably obvious.  It even has maggots dripping onto a girl's hair (as in Argento's ""Suspiria"") and a scene where several long blades bust through a wall and skewer one victim, an idea that could have easily been culled from any of Argento's scripts.
Given the title of this nonsense, I sense some are wondering if it rips off Sam Raimi as well.  Yes it does!  Raimi's shakycam style and off-kilter camera angles are prevalent throughout, as is his ""sitting ducks"" idea (confining the victims to a limited area.)  Ripping off the title of Raimi's most notorious work may have been a good marketing decision, but it can't obscure the fact that one viewing will convince anyone that any further comparisons would yield ludicrous results.
And as for the plot, you have to wonder why a camera team and a news reporter would venture to a location where people are mysteriously murdered on tape and do so little to escape once they find the trouble they were looking for.  Eddie Murphy once criticized white people for not having the sense to leave a haunted house.  Apparently, some Japanese have the same problem.
I could name a slew of other horror works this celluloid bowel movement rips off (such as ""The Johnsons"" and the ""Guinea Pig"" series,) but the point is that ""Evil Dead Trap"" has lousy acting, gratuitous sex, is cheap and poorly scripted, and has too many false scares.  The violence is obligatory enough to bore any gore hound to the point where they're ready to settle for reruns of the Brady Bunch.

It's all about a tv journalist, Nami, who gets a snuff film in the mail. Hoping to improve her show's image, proving it's not just a ""fluff"" show for a cute girl reporter, Nami decides to go to the factory where the video was made and investigate. She brings along four of her staff.

The first part seems like it could just be some earthly sociopath doing all the work.

The film serves as a precursor to the so-called torture-porn Horror films like SAW that glorify sickly tortures in full view. While some of the deaths are entirely implausible, each of them are brutal, bloody, and imaginative. The dilapidated building serves as a labyrinthine location filled with traps and natural disasters awaiting the crew, while providing the killer with ample places to jump out and surprise the audience. In one particularly frightening sequence, the killer stalks one victim in a strobe effect created by a flashing camera, while in another a dark form quickly approaches the crew on rollers until it comes close enough for them to realize that it is their friend strung from a meat hook, gutted. Unfortunately, most of the characters are killed very early on, which dramatically reduces the pace and suspense of the remaining screen time, but the horror doesn't end with the murders.. EVIL DEAD TRAP is a refreshing change from the typical ghost films Japan has recently become known for, and includes several gore scenes that are sure to shake even the hardest genre fan!

Man, this movie wears its Argento influence on its sleeve in a huge way. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing; a handful of directors have been able to take the Argento influence and really run with it (the most notable being Michele Soavi). Evil Dead Trap, however, uses the visual brilliance he's inherited from Argento to mask a shallow script with a predictable plot.

Nami (Miyuki Ono, who would show up the year after in Ridley Scott's Black Rain) is the hostess of a late-night TV show with an all-female production team. One day, she comes in to find a package on her desk. When she views the videotape inside, she finds what looks like a snuff movie, and in the spirit of investigative journalism, she and a camera crew head out to the abandoned military base where the movie was filmed to see if she kind find the body, or perhaps the killer. When the crew get there, they find a mysterious man who warns them away. Soon after, as you would expect, the crew begin dying.

Predictable, right? Like you wouldn't believe. Every plot twist you expect is coming, and if you haven't figured out the Big Reveal halfway through the movie, you haven't seen enough slasher films. I grant you, there's a pretty bizarre twist to this particular Big Reveal, but it's still a variation on a theme. You've seen this before many, many times. Still, it's all quite pretty, and if you're a gorehound there's more than enough here to keep you satisfied. Just don't expect a great script. ** ",1228521600,,1525,4.6162361623616235
7894777,5,6305789649,"Evil Dead Trap is a Japanese horror film from the 80's that drew a lot of inspiration from Italian and American horror film's from that era, particularly Argento, Cronenburg and Fulci movie's. It's got all the color's, technique's, and beautifully staged murder sequences of Argento's best work, with the supernatural and bizarre element's of a Cronenburg movie, and the gore of a Fulci movie all blended into a strange, yet incredible horror film (even has a soundtrack that could be mistaken as lost Goblin music).
A newswoman get's a strange videotape of a girl being sliced up in an abandoned factory (including an eyeball slicing scene reminiscent of Fulci's New York Ripper) and she and her collegues decide to investigate the murder. It then turn's into a enjoyably confusing nightmare of gore and the supernatural. One after another they get murdered in very brutal and creative way's, and then top's it all off with a Cronenburg-like, sci-fi ending. This is one of the best Japanese (or anywhere for that matter) horror flick's ever to have been made, and I can't recommend this one enough.",1197936000,,1099,4.978260869565218
7894778,5,6305789649,"Before Ringu made Japanese horror films mainstream in the west, there was Evil Dead Trap...probably the most well known Asian horror film of its time.  A late night news program recieves an apparent snuff film from an obsessed viewer.  Hoping this will be the big story she has been looking for, anchorette Nami and her crew decice to investigate.  Once the bodies start to drop though, it becomes clear to Nami that there may be more to this story than meets the eye.

This is a great Japanese horror film from the 80's with an ending reminescent of early Cronenberg.  Any fan of the genre should be more than pleased.",1160352000,4,619,4.590909090909091
7894779,3,6305789649,"A reporter looking for her big break finds it when a maniac mails her a snuff film and directions to an abandoned factory.  Without telling anybody she and four co-workers go to investigate (great idea!) and are shocked to find out there really is a killer on the loose and he's after them (imagine that!).

One by one the killer knocks off the victims in violent ways (cleaver to the head, decapitation, massive spearing) all leading up to his main prize: the girl he mailed the tape to.  With such an exciting start you'd think that this film would just get creepier and creepier, but instead when it gets down to the Final Girl it actually slows way down then drags on to some confusing nightmarish ending that caused me to make a face like I was eating a lemon while reading an advanced physics math book.",1151884800,,809,4.489795918367347
7894780,4,6305789649,"This is a very bizzare and I won't hesitate to say - one of the best Japanise horror flicks I've seen. First if your opinion on Japanise horror tradition is based on such titles as ""The Ring"", ""Grudge"" and ""Dark Water"", you may forget about them - that is to say the latest Japanise wave. In 1980-s it was by far different. ""Evil Dead Trap"" has some supernatural elements as well, but it's made in a totally different style. I'd call it Japanise-Italian style no mater how funny that may sound. This movie reminds of giallo films in general and of some particular works by Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci. Everything is done here in Italian manner - cinematography, music, camera angles, ghastly murder scenes. I'm far from thinking it was the director's intention but sometimes I got the feeling I was watching some tribute to Italian masters of horror. I'm sure there were scenes imitating the ones from ""Suspiria"" and ""Phenomena"" for example, and eyeball-slitting scene was a flat-out homage to Fulci's ""The New York Ripper"". And music - if I heard it while my eyes were blindfolded and was asked what it is - I'd say it's Goblin's soundtrack to some new Argento movie.
""Evil Dead Trap"" (apart from having a stupid title) is at times absurd, surreal and strange but without a doubt very stylish, original and fresh although as I said is reminiscent of many Italian horrors. That's a very pleasant fact considering it was made in 1988. I'm not sure you'll like it if you have just a shadowy idea about Japanise horror, but if you are an aficionado - I bet this movie would be interesting for you.",1131667200,2,1596,4.623239436619718
7894781,3,6305789649,"Until its final (disappointing) reels, ""Evil Dead Trap"" is basically a slasher film with an intriguing premise: The hostess of a late-night TV show for Insomniacs solicits home videos from her viewers. She receives a tape that follow a van as it makes its way outside the city to an abandoned military complex. Inside, the faceless videographer appears to torture and then murder a woman. The TV show host gets a crew together to investigate - WRONG move. Someone or some thing lies in the shadows, ready to torture and murder Nami's crew one by one. What could he want with Nami?

The first thing you should know about ""Evil Dead Trap"" is that its violence is far more intense than your average US slasher. Fans of Dario Argento or Lucio Fulci (whose work ""EDT"" mines extensively) probably won't be shocked by the level of violence, but your casual viewer might be turned off by the sheer brutality of the carnage. Unlike say Jason or Freddy, the faceless killer of ""Evil Dead Trap"" isn't content to just murder his victims. Nope, this baddy wants to actually torture them in a series of highly sadistic and elaborate set pieces. The body count isn't especially high, but it does include intense, graphic scenes of eye-gouging, a cleaver to the head, a garote/neck-snapping, etc. Gorehounds will love it; casual horror fans might be seriously put off.

Aside from the brutality, what sets ""Evil Dead Trap"" apart for me is the stylish camera work and chilly atmosphere of the film. Corridors of the labyrinthian military base are lit with bold Technicolors. There's a gorgeous scene set in the fog-drenched woods outside. The soundtrack is unintrusive but effectively creepy. I'd never realized how much Japanese horror was incluenced by Italian gaillo and gore films, but fans of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci will recognize little stylistic flourishes throughout ""Evil Dead Trap.""

There are some plot gaps. For one thing, if I'd received a snuff film in the mail, my first response would be to contact the police - NOT to investigate the source on my own! Even assuming the film was fake, the kind of person who'd stage a mock snuff that features a woman getting her eye pierced by a large, sharp poker (in graphic, disgusting detail) is not the kind of person I want to meet. The first few minutes of the movie require some serious suspension of disbelief ...

And the ending is a letdown. ""Evil Dead Trap"" is so stylish that for the first hour or so I started to enjoy the fairly by-the-numbers predictability of it all. The last half an hour veers into some highly ridiculous Freudian psychobabble terrain that didn't seem to fit. I give the screenwriter/director credit for trying to do something different, but the ending is a serious departure from the rest of the film. The last half an hour or so seems to lag, and things get uninteresting once ""Evil Dead Trap"" tries to explain itself.

Anyway, all that said - ANY fan of Japanese or Eurohorror will enjoy the movie, and US horror fans who have a stomach for graphic violence should be entertained. ""Evil Dead Trap"" is uneven and flawed, but it kept me rivetted for most of the film.",1111795200,2,3145,4.742230347349177
