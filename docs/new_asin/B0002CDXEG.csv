The first show, PACIFICALLY SPEAKING, is about 50% new animation made for this 1967 show with live action footage filling out the educational end (probably lifted from the True Life Adventures).  This show instructs us on the stories & lifestyles of the people on Pacific Islands.

The second show is the real reason to get this.  MAN ON WHEELS features the three most sought after cartoons by Disney fans.  All three are double length cartoons presented here complete & un-interrupted except for the lack of individual title cards:

DONALD AND THE WHEEL (1961) tells of the trials & tribulations caveman Donald experiences while inventing the wheel. (about 15 minutes in length)

FREEWAYPHOBIA (1965) Goofy demonstrates how NOT to merge on the freeway, drive with distractions, and basically cause every thinkable accident.  (about 15 minutes in length)

GOOFY'S FREEWAY TROUBLE  (1965) This sequal to Freewayphobia shows Goofy neglecting the care of his car & tires and the problems it will cause when his deathtrap goes on the freeway. (about 15 minutes in length)

Walt Disney, himself, hosts this show and fills out the remaining 5 minutes with a clip from ""Motor Mania"" (which is also seen in another Wonderful World of Disney tape as well as the Disney Treasures Complete Goofy DVD tin).  It is fun to see these rare cartoons presented by their creator, Walt Disney, who generically credits his animators for coming up with the ideas.",1171238400,3,1532,4.964705882352941
8026006,4,B0002CDXEG,"This is a compilation from the The Wonderful World of Disney television anthology show. I remember as a kid growing up, you could always count on Disney entertainment every Sunday night. As a kid growing up in the 60's and 70's we didn't have cable, satellite, vcr's or other home viewing, just what the 4 broadcast channels put out- and kids programming was pretty slim. But Sunday night I would get my TV tray on the only night my mom would let me watch tv in front of the tube, Disney night! Uncle Walt would always have some great new adventure for uskids. This episode originally aired in October of 1968, using a new character called Moby Duck as narrator, (yet another relative of Donald's), and main character. The show is themed as a story book, and each chapter moves onto another topic. The book is basically a study of nature, plants, fish, and animals in some Pacific Ocean islands. Very fun and nostalgic, my 9 year old enjoys my copy. I just wish they still showed these on the Disney channel.

I highly recommend this video and others in the series. Disney released many other titles from the TV episodes, just search on Amazon under ""Wonderful World of Disney"".",1111363200,3,1178,4.609523809523809
