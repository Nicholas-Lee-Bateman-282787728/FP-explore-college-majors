8218858,5,B000VIPXRG,Mindy is a great instructor.  I know she didn't create this workout but she delivers it in a fun way.  I was sweaty early on.  I use a 12 lb body bar for all of it and it works great.  She mentions that she is using a 9 lb body bar.  You don't actually use the bar as much as I would have thought but that is okay.  It is a great workout.,1358121600,,338,3.5616438356164384
8218859,5,B000VIPXRG,"Mindy really shows her fun & chatty personality in this hour long workout. She talks up a storm!! Mindy and her team of 3 will show you all fitness level options and modifications on varied weight bars and lengths.  You can even choose to do less jumping and not as intense in speed and power as Mindy. It is a circuit workout and the cardio is fast and powerful.  Lots of coordination and agility moves when the bar is placed on the ground.  You'll hop over it with one leg and both legs.  The strength portion consists high reps and you'll use multi-joints: military press on one leg with a calf lift/tap, tri dips with toe lifts to work shins.  Overall the moves are athletic-based, functional strength, coordination exercises.  Mindy was very creative in choreography, cues & instructs well.",1274572800,3,795,4.683453237410072
