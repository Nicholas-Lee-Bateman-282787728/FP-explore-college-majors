8012914,5,B0001I54KM,"Richie Gajate-Garcia details the very basic hand techniques needed to achieve the correct sounds for playing conga, which are the ground work of this instrument. Next he gives you simple and clear exercises that are the beginnings of the patterns used in Latin music. The best way to use this material is to take what he has taught, slow yourself down with a metronome to about 40 or 50 beats per minute, and ingrain these methods at ridiculously slow tempos so you can make sure you are getting each sound correct. After this, you will be able to eventually increase these tempos and use them at any speed to play along with music tracks and bands. While this is not a play-a-long DVD, nor is it necessary to create a several hour DVD for that purpose, it absolutely gives you the basics necessary to achieve a solid fundamental in conga playing, and gives you a glimpse at where you will be able to take your playing when Richie speeds the exercises up to real song tempos. As well, on the instruction booklet that one writer described as useless without music knowledge, this is actually not true. Music reading is very helpful in learning music, and what Richie has laid out as examples are very easy to understand one and two measure sentences with only 4 beats per measure. If you have no knowledge of music at all, Richie even counts the 4 note beat, as well as the rhythm slowly so you can grasp how to understand the concept of how he has written them. I have had personal lessons with Richie, and when I saw the other low ratings I re-watched this DVD  because I wanted to  write a review from a knowledgeable viewpoint. When Richie teaches in person, he has an extreme amount of patience and creativity in helping a student, and he teaches completely at your level. I feel this DVD is a great representation of his teaching skills, and within an hour's time gives you the tools to easily begin learning conga on your own, as well as a quick look at where you can expand to. It is always best to supplement something like this with private instruction, but what is given here is an excellent place to start and see physically each sound or stroke is performed. If you end up enjoying congas, he also has book and CD with many more exercises and patterns in several different music styles to keep you going. Richie is an incredible player and teacher, and you will do yourself a favor by learning from this DVD.",1324857600,,2420,4.510250569476082
8012915,3,B0001I54KM,"As another reviewer stated, I am also self taught with the congas. I've never had any formal training but my enjoyment and interest in the conga prompted me to purchase this video. Prior to buying this video I also played by ear or by feel. One reviewer stated that he wanted ""continous"" play-along on a given pattern lasting more than 10 seconds. This type of ""instruction"" would be wasteful, boring, and repetative. The video would have to be 3 hours long for that type of instruction. What Richie attempts to do on this video is present the viewer a number of basic hand movements and actual conga patterns for the VIEWER to practive over and over on his own. Richie presents the foundation from which the VIEWER can build and expand his own creativity. I found the video to be very informative for beginners. I've played for years not realizing the mistakes I was making when striking the drum to attain a certain note. One thing I should mention is that it would be EXTREMELY helpful for the viewer to be able to read basic musical notation. The literature that comes with the video will do NOTHING for you if you cannot read it. You can still benefit from the video if you try to memorize the timing and hand strokes from video. All in all...my opinion is that this video is NOT the best......but certainly NOT the worst that I have seen. I found it very helpful. I do not recommend it for intermediate or advance musicians. But as an visual aid for a beginner it is perfect!!",1244332800,4,1482,4.5130111524163565
8012916,2,B0001I54KM,"I am a conga player who doesnt have any training in percussion instruments.  I have a good sense of rhythym and can play well with other musicians and do so on a weekly basis.  Everything I play is by feel so I thought I would like to learn some basic patterns.

Richie Gajate-Garcia surely doesn't lack skill, but it is my impression that it is painful for him to try to teach at a beginner level.  He states that you shouldn't try to play too fast, but then procedes to play every pattern in hypersonic speed.  Its impressive to watch, but impossible to participate in.  He does start off slowly, but just when I'm getting the hang of it he speeds up and I have to stop playing, grab the remote and rewind to the beginning again.  I don't know if this is typical for instructional videos but it is very annoying.

What would really help me get better is a ""playing partner"" on dvd - someone to follow along on a drumming pattern that lasts for more than 10 seconds.  I would have been stoked to have 60 minutes of that rather than the artist biography, photo gallery and bonus video clip.",1129852800,17,1090,4.330049261083744
