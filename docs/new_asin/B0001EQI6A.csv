8011351,2,B0001EQI6A,"The only reason for seeing Liar's Poker, is seeing Amelie Heinle, ""Victoria"" from ""Young and the Restless"", she is the femme fatale in the movie. She is an under-appreciate actress, who should get better roles. The whole movie is about four friends, who are trying to out-con each other for the dough and survival. If you viewer are looking for eye candy, Amelie Heinle is the prize. Her sensual beauty and beautiful darting eye is a revelation, you won't be disappointed. With better roles, she could be the next Karen Allen, the actress from Animal House and Raider of the Lost Ark.",1302480000,,584,4.735294117647059
8011352,1,B0001EQI6A,"This movie was mis-represented and falsely advertised. Many people have read the book ""Liar's Poker"" and it is likely that those same people have seen the Movie ""Wall Street""...When i went to check out as i was purchasing Wall Street, Amazon suggested i might like the ""Liars Poker"" movie as well, basically attempting to play on the likelihood that i read the Liars Poker book. However, when i watched Liarts Poker movie, it was terrible and had ZERO relation to the book. For the first time, i am COMPLETELY unsatisfied with Amazon, more specifically,  the marketing team which i've come to rely on.

8011353,4,B0001EQI6A,"This is an interesting crime film by freshman director Jeff Santo. The narrative is of less importance than the technique, which involves pace-related risktaking. Expressionism is nicely developed here, with the manner in which time is handled being consistent with the script. The slowness of the scenes might be offputting to some, but a directorial point of view is established and well-met. The acting, particularly by Heinle, Hunter and Blondell, maintains the author's focus on style. There are some red herrings, but not enough to mar this little-known attempt at creative cinema.",1128470400,7,587,5.391304347826087
