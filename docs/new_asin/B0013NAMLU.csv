3118668,4,B0013NAMLU,"Season 1 moves a bit more slowly than Season 2. It takes a while to figure out who's who and what's really going on. There's interesting office politics with each guy trying to move up the ladder and discredit others vying for the same promotion. Basically, the story keeps moving along slowly building up to the more exciting action in Season 2. It's an intelligently created drama and makes for a unique viewing experience, perhaps because it's from a Canadian angle (Canadian locations, Canadian politics, Canadian law enforcement, Canada vs. U.S. spying and each country having it's own agendas, etc.).",1446422400,,606,5.07

3118674,2,B0013NAMLU,"Some reviewers were obviously very taken with this show. I don't fault the acting, but the characters were so unlikable, I couldn't empathize with them or care about their fate. The whole drama seemed grim and depressing. No one seemed to have the slightest sense of humor, and the only human warmth displayed was between a drug dealer and his young daughter (who obviously had no clue what her father did for a living). I tried to stick with the show long enough to at least figure out the characters and how they were connected, since some of the organizations are confusing if you don't know the Canadian system. Even so, I couldn't make it to the end of the pilot. There are so many better law enforcement shows to choose from, I can't see why anyone would waste their time on this one.",1422403200,,790,4.493055555555555

3118683,5,B0013NAMLU,"The 2 seasons of Intelligence is one of the best mini-series ever created for TV.  Great characters.  Great story lines.  Very realistic, I'm sure that's why there wasn't a season 3, the story showed the DEA and CIA carrying out their illegal activities in Canada/North America/Mexico and I'm certain that didn't go over well in Washington DC.  Infiltrating the Canadian government, manipulating the drug trade on both sides of the border, murdering Canadians and Americans as they wished in order to get the results they wanted.  Not a whole lot of fiction in this one folks.

I really am hoping they pick it back up with a Season 3 with Jimmy Reardon recovering in the hospital, preparing to turn over all the dirty details on the CIA (Black Briar Group), DEA (doing illegal drug deals on both sides of the border) and other illegal spying going on inside CSIS and Ottawa.

3118684,5,B0013NAMLU,"Leave it to the Canadians to cast a black woman in the lead role in an excellent crime story. Klea Scott is super cool and determined as she battles crime and white male supremacy in Vancouver. Sensitive writers have fashioned a script which allows her to come across as shrewd, ambitious, intelligent, and sexy ....and the savvy Panamanian actress knows how to pull it off and make it real.  My only regret is the last scene that abruptly ends the series which should go on and on.

I suppose there must have been a bidding war for the rights to this show as it was removed from their directory two years ago. I have been craving the series after found it here at The Big A. It must be doing VERY well, since as a Prime Member I am unable to view without additional purchase on a 2005 show I watched on Netflix three years ago. Final words ... A great show. Funny, it was canceled after the second season. I actually grew suspicious as the story line of the second season, I believe, hit on some very real themes. So I researched the issue in great detail... All I can say is Wow!! No wonder it was canceled by the Canadian govt and not picked up by any studios here in the US.

3118690,5,B0013NAMLU,"One of the best TV shows I have ever seen.  I don't usually like ""cop"" shows, but the reviews of this one were so good I decided to bite.

So many American TV shows just tend to have a very unreal, or comic book quality to them, even when they claim to be trying to be realistic.  This Canadian show gives me the feel of portraying the subject matter (see the other reviews) in a simply realistic way (that keeps you on the edge of your seat at the same time).

3118699,5,B0013NAMLU,"Careful. This show is profoundly addictive. You've been warned.

Beautifully written, brilliantly directed, great acting... this is the ""crime show"" against which all others should be measured. It gets under your skin. It drives you crazy. The intensity just nails you up against the wall. Your house could catch fire while watching it and you might not notice.

One special facet of this jewel is that it doesn't fall to all the usual cliches about marijuana dealers or strip club operators. Every scene rings absolutely true.

If I were HBO or Showtime I'd re-air the first two seasons while reassembling the cast for another 12 episodes.

I'll tell you... in all seriousness... I'd pay five hundred bucks to be able to see a third season.

If there's a more riveting, stress inducing series... I don't want to see it. I'm not sure I could handle it.

As to my comment title... just google around a bit and you'll see that it's quite obviously true. And I'm sure that Washington had a desire to see the series ended...",1387929600,4,1020,4.734463276836158

3118705,5,B0013NAMLU,"""Intelligence"" is one of my favorite shows. The main characters, Mary Spalding (Klea Scott), head of the Vancouver Organized Crime Unit, and Jimmy Reardon (Ian Tracey), leader of a local smuggling and marijuana empire, gather and trade intelligence (as in information) to survive and get ahead. Spalding is parleying her network of informants at the Organized Crime Unit into a foreign intelligence service. Reardon aims to hang onto his empire and stay out of jail until he can get out of the smuggling and marijuana business. The writing is great, the characters are strong, and the performances are excellent. The chess games that unfold between the players are complex, compelling and suspenseful--I've never seen another show like it. Some compare it to ""The Wire"", but the central theme is different. ""Intelligence"" really is about intelligence--the characters struggle to get and use information and it's the motor that drives the show.",1356912000,,943,5.293333333333333

It reminds me of The Wire, though I don't think the acting and writing is quite of that caliber.  Even so, I have no qualms about giving it 5 stars.  I'm two episodes away from finishing season 2 and I have very mixed emotions about it.  On the one hand, it will soon be over, but on the other I have two more episodes to watch!

3118712,4,B0013NAMLU,"This is kind of like a Canadian version of the Wire where everyone is pretty mellow and the bad guys are about as dangerous as girl scouts. I like the show and it is worth watching, but things must be very different in Canada.
The Bad Guys:
Riordon and company run a strip club, a shipping company, and a wholesale pot distribution company. They are pretty nice guys, straight forward and honest as can be for criminals. Even when attacked, they like to sit down and talk things out instead of resorting to violence if they can. ""The Disciples"" are supposedly a dangerous biker gang, but you never see anyone but their leader. He doesn't have a bike, runs a local business, and looks like your grandfather.
The ""Good Guys"": Apparently the Canadian versions of the local cops, state cops, FBI, and CIA all work out of the same building and can move around between organizations. Mary (Klea Scott) is part of what would be the FBI or maybe State Police looking to move to the CIA (CSIS in Canada). The Canadian cops spend about 60% of their time scheming and spying on each other, 36% of their time spying on the crooks and trying to recruit them as informants, and *maybe* 4% of their time actually trying to catch or stop criminals.
You essentially get the somewhat surreal situation where the cops come up with schemes to bust the criminals and then the higher up cops make sure they get away. The DEA/FBI also show up now and again and appear to be violent cowboys and MUCH more dangerous than ANY of the Canadians including the biker gang.",1332201600,,1542,4.530465949820789
3118713,5,B0013NAMLU,"This is TV at it's best.  Sopranos meets The Wire and hangs with DaVinci's Inquest.  Bearing similarities to each of the aforementioned shows, Intelligence stands on it's own and depicts both the criminal underworld and the intelligence world trying to get a handle on things and usually a half-step behind events.
Very, very unfortunate that this only went two seasons.  Produced in 2005-2007, it still feels very fresh and compelling today-everyone has flip phones and there's not a smart-phone to be seen...there's your only clue that it's not 2012.  Great edgy soundtrack/music by Schaun Tozer runs throughout the series.

Check it out, well worth it.  Smart, fast-moving, well-written with compelling characters and good acting and directing...all without over-the-top graphic sex or violence.  The best.  Also streaming on Netflix.

If you have not seen DaVinci's Inquest, and you like this, by all means check out that show.  Also on Canadian Broadcasting and set in Vancouver, it's a great low-key detective drama with Ian Tracey (aka Jimmy Reardon in Intelligence) in a supporting detective role.  Another GREAT show cancelled after several seasons.",1326412800,,1158,5.377777777777778
3118714,5,B0013NAMLU,"I absolutely loved this series.  I started watching over the summer when there was not a lot of television.  I did not know much about it other than the fact that it was highly rated by viewers on Netflix, and decided to give it a try.  GLAD I DID!  The series began regular broadcasting on October 10, 2006 in Canada on CBC starring Ian Tracey and Klea Scott.  The show follows Jimmy Reardon (Tracey), one of Vancouver's top organized crime bosses, head of a third generation west coast crime syndicate (think Tony Soprano but Canadian), and Mary Spalding (Scott), the director of the Vancouver Organized Crime Unit (OCU) (or our US feds).  Mary Spalding (a complex character who may be good and may not be, highly ambitious and willing to step on anyone who gets in her way) offers Reardon immunity from prosecution in exchange for his role as a police informant. Crime boss Reardon is working to avoid issues with his rival, the Disciples Motorcycle club, who is trying to control Vancouver's marijuana trade and money laundering industry.  This series is dark and gritty, exceptionally well acted, and well worth your time.",1323993600,2,1127,4.808290155440415
3118715,5,B0013NAMLU,"I watched both seasons on Netflix DVD before buying both seasons from Amazon so I could easily watch them again and share with my kids when they visit.

I must say that when it comes to crime drama the Canadians seem to do it so much better than most American series.  Examples the Canadian series Rookie Blue and Flashpoint, but Intelligence is even better.  No gratuitous sex or graphic violence, which is great.  And which means the focus is on the unfolding twists and turns.  Intelligence is sort of a mix of The Killing and MI-5, both of which I love.  In short, unlike most crime dramas, this series has depth.  And it gets deeper from one episode to the next.  Some of the characters don't have quite the depth I would have liked, but the main mobster, played by Ian Tracey, and his ex-wife, played by Camille Sullivan, are compelling.  All of the characters and all of the plots seem quite real, nothing drippy, nothing silly, nothing hokey, in fact, the absolute opposite of drippy-silly-hokey CSI Miami.  Of course some of the characters don't last long, but the ones that matter get more and more entangled.  It's great.

Besides Tracey and Sullivan, there is Klea Scott as Mary Spalding, not pretty but consistent as the driven head of the ""good guys"" ... I say ""good"" but in fact the government folks are just as corrupt and self-serving as the so-called criminals.  Her deputy Matt Frewer as Ted Altman is complex and nasty.  And Bernie Coulson as Michael Reardon is obnoxious but adds value nonetheless.  In fact, all of the main characters contribute actual value to the show.  None of them are played superficially.  Surprisingly, the nicest character is the mob boss, reluctant to resort to violence, a good father to his teenage daughter.  How the various organizations interact is almost as entertaining as how the characters interact.  You have four mob organizations, Jimmy Reardon's, the Vietnamese, the bikers, and the disciples.  And you have several Canadian government units, intelligence, police, etc., and several US units, CIA, DEA, FBI, plus Chinese intelligence.  All interacting badly. I love it.

I started out watching one episode a night and before long I was staying up watching all the episodes on each DVD and I couldn't get them fast enough.  I anticipate a marathon when all of my kids are here for Christmas.",1318982400,,2351,4.8225

3118717,4,B0013NAMLU,"Thoughtful ensemble-cast crime/spy mix Just North of the Border.  Many of the places and people will be familiar to viewers of Dante's Inquest, except the junior cop evolved into a criminal mastermind of sorts. (Not quite Professor Moriarty, since he is losing his grip as Season 1 progresses.) If one accepts the major premise that US spies spend vast resources penetrating a friendly nation's crime and spy-fighting units,  and worse, that Canadian politicians up to the highest level approve and want to  protect at all costs the  treasonous double agents; then the multiple roles and many threats from inside and outside the 2 leads' worlds make fascinating viewing. ""Intelligence"" denotes their preoccupation with snooping, deception, gossip, any kind of illicit or public fact-gathering, etc. believed necessary to survival; the leads have some kind of code of honor that prevents them from acting on anything less than ""proof,"" unlike real players in these vicious worlds.

3118718,5,B0013NAMLU,"I found ""Intelligence"" on NETFLIX VOD and was captivated within the first ten minutes of the pilot. This is one of the most intelligent, best written, best performed cop dramas anywhere on television. The interwoven story lines offer even more dramatic scope and complexity than did ""Da Vinci"", and both the natural grandeur and the sordid city-scapes of Vancouver once again provide context, and color to the story.

After watching several NETFLIX episodes, I knew I had to own this show, came to Amazon to buy a DVD, and... wow! What have these reviewers been watching that they judged to be so inferior to the tawdry, simplistic kill fests shown on American networks and cable. How could they have missed the point.

Well, there is one explanation. ""Intelligence"" is just too much hard work American TV viewers! I admit that the show would never have made it on US prime time. It simply demands too much concentration, and too long an attention span for the typical viewer. If they'd put it on PBS, then the current ""great"" British thespian would have needed an extra 20 minutes of intro time per episode to bring the dumb colonials up to speed.

However, if you like a show that keeps you constantly puzzling -- sometimes out-guessing, and sometimes being blind-sided by the story line -- this is it. If you like movies in which, whenever there's a wide shot, you're wondering: ""Is that just setting a scene, or is there somebody, or something in the background that will become important later"", then ""Intelligence"" is the one for you.",1315699200,2,1540,4.80377358490566

3118720,3,B0013NAMLU,"I'm surprised by all the positive feedback here. I gave 3.5 stars. The plot is very much convoluted to the point where there is no real plot and it seems the direction of the show is to get everyone in Vancouver wired and on the inside of something. I've never worked for Law Enforcement in Vancouver but I am somewhat familiar with the drug (marijuana) trade around the Alberta/BC region so I found it very hard to swallow that the marijuana market was pulling in millions per week for Jim and that the law would need to wire and bug everything in the city to catch marijuana dealers. I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s New York City scene and I am familiar with all sorts of ""real world"" drug issues so it may be my regional bias that prohibits me from thinking that Vancouver is a crime syndicate capitol of the galaxy. I also didn't quite understand the USA's involvement in any of that nor what it has to do with Chinese triads and Mid-East terrorism or diamonds/guns in the Congo.
Also incredible to swallow was understanding why getting promoted in the ranks is so important to characters (Ted and Deacons) when they clearly showed a contempt for working there and would not gain much more power or salary in promotion. Only once in the first 8 episodes someone mentions salary as a reason for promotion or working elsehwere outside the agency. That said there is some confusion in what the motivation is for the characters. The criminals naturally want to make more money and gain territory for selling pot or ATM machines. Jim to be seen as a villian by the time we meet him is odd because he already seems to already be rich enough to exit this world scotch free with this daughter. He even claims he wants out several times but we know why he stays - the same reason DeNiro went back at the end of Heat. Also as a character I just didn't get that he was ambitious at any point in his past to be at the top of the pot trade. As for the agency, these good guys seem to only be out to impress themselves by acruing informants and wiring everything and not really wanting to catch anyone. After 8 shows you are left thinking they don't even want to catch bad guys anymore just spend government money setting up taps, paying off informants, putting guys on the inside. It is really pointless from a viewer's perspective because we are told that the main criminal carrot is somewhere overseas in Hong Kong or the Mid East so spending billions on informants and taps in the small drug and arms trade in Vancouver seems laughable. This is even expressed between Mary and her lover in one of the early episodes where he says his department spend billions to tap out a criminal that was worth way less.
If anything the main conflict lies more so between law enforcement employees themselves and between the criminals themselves but there is no tension at all between law and crime.
That said, what drives excitement is the communication or lack thereof between the characters that should be talking. Much like the LOST TV show, Intellegence relies of key players not communicating at key times to ramp up the drama. This drags the story out and after LOST I will never dedicate another 6 years to a singular TV show waiting for something spectacular to happen. I suspect this is why this show was axed after 2 seasons.",1306022400,2,3317,4.502487562189055

The show isn't bad, it's reasonably well acted and written, it's just that the characters all seem very pale. Any comparisons to The Wire are WAY off and unfair. I agree with another reviewer who was surprised by how easy wire taps are to get in Canada. There are a lot of very odd details like  that in this show that kept me from ever fully embracing it. Intelligence is more on par with network television, something akin to Law & Order. It's watchable and mildly enjoyable but in no way, shape or form is it anywhere near The Wire.

Although I'd love to see the show continue on cable or American TV, I can't imagine any other actors in the show.  Ian Tracey and Klea Scott are perfect. And in this show, it's all about the acting (NOT the special effects!).  Lots of close-ups, street scenes and get-to-the-heart-of-the-matter dialogue.

They aren't muscle heads in Jersey who no nothing but a life of crime. They do strive to be those things though. I definitely mean no offense by this statement but, these are a bunch a white guys who deal pot in Canada. Not to say that this isn't dangerous or worth having a show about. The show is handled brilliantly. You always get the sense though, that a lot of this is just a facade. They're barely getting by with walking the walk.

Every actor is the perfect match for the character he or she plays on the show, all the way from the major roles down to the bit parts.  Ian Tracey plays a man with integrity who just happens to find himself running the family marijuana business.  Matt Brewer is the ultimate creep as an ambitious, double-crossing and back-stabbing intelligence officer.  But there are admirable people in the Canadian intelligence service as well, with Klea Scott taking the strong lead there.

Intelligence manages to be intensely gripping without glorifying violence or the criminal lifestyle.  Much of the time, Jimmy Reardon (Ian Tracey) seems to be looking for a way out of the competitive drug trade, in favor of a normal life for his daughter.

3118734,5,B0013NAMLU,"Intelligence has been compared to The Wire and other HBO series.  It certainly meets their standards and often surpasses them in plot and character development.  The series (so far -- through the first season and into the first couple of weeks of the second) doesn't throw the kinds of plot surprises at the viewer which indicate that the writers were having a hard time figuring out what to do next. Instead, you become a believer and a fully-engaged partner in the action. Character drives action.  As other reviewers have suggested, it really gets under your skin.

Here's the thing:  The writers of this and other notable Canadian TV series show respect for the viewer.  They don't belabor each point; they don't hammer home each plot twist.  They don't nudge-nudge and they don't overdo.  Of course, the pleasure of watching this series demands a little more imagination and focus than many American series (frequent exception:  The Wire) which seem to play to an attention span of about three minutes.  Result:  the viewer feels respected and drawn in, rather than patronized.

Klea Scott is endlessly compelling; Matt Frewer becomes a wonderfully detestable and (we hope) doomed sleazeball; Bernie Coulson's Mike has you on tenterhooks, waiting for his next screw-up.  Ian Tracey, as the complicated and attractive drug lord, is competent and deft. Throughout each 45 minute episode, a crew of directors has you hooked on the interplay between Vancouver's drug underground and ambitious (not to mention vicious and corrupt) American and Canadian officials.

I envy you if you haven't yet seen this series -- you have a treat in store!",1241222400,2,1641,5.074626865671642
3118735,4,B0013NAMLU,"I watched the entire first season in 2 viewings over the New Years holiday.  I also could not disagree more with the Amazon review.  Point in fact that if I could give 4 1/2-stars I would, as the series is just a notch under perfect.  First and foremost, for a crime drama there is a surprising lack of gratuitous violence.  Could this be a result of the copious amounts of alcohol consumed?  The aforementioned may put many people off that are accustomed to American TV a la ""24"" and the ""CSI Trilogy.""  Violence does lurk beneath the surface, though even when deemed necessary we rarely get to see it on screen.
Perhaps my reason for not giving the series 5-stars is that a good portion of the show is filmed in a strip club with nary a bare breast seen (not sure if this is  a result of CBC sensors or simply a decision made by the producers).  Seriously, it may actually be the lack of gratuitous sex & violence that make this series work, as the focus is more on interior & exterior power struggles and the resulting sub plots, yea? (Apparently, in Vancouver it is common to finish a sentence with ""yea"").  The other interesting aspect to show, which was frequently a topic of discussions among my friends and I, was how such relatively ""soft"" organization could manage a criminal enterprise that generated 9-figures annually?  Again, perhaps this goes to how criminal enterprises are managed in Canada?

I would recommend this series to anyone that is a fan of well written crime dramas sans the sex & violence.  If you pinned me down I would have to say the real reason why this would not rate 5-stars is that the characters are not multi layered, which while may be enough to not generate a fifth star, still place this series in the top tier of anything that is currently in the USA/UK.

End of Intelligence?
I've previously blogged about my fondness for the TV show Intelligence and after the great season finale in December, I now have a free block of time on Monday nights.

Apparently I was not the only one complaining about CBC's lack of advertising and promotion of the show on its network especially prior to the season premiere. The creator of Intelligence, Chris Haddock also points to the lack of promotion as a part of the reason for relatively poor ratings for Intelligence and goes on to accuse CBC of trying to bury the show.

Indeed, it appears that the CBC is unwilling to commit to renewing the series for another season. Judging from message boards and posts, viewers of the show REALLY like it and are passionate about it but I guess if the ratings aren't high enough, the CBC doesn't care.

Is there any hope that the CBC will come to its senses and bring back Intelligence for a third season???",1223424000,3,1171,4.730392156862745

I got Season 1 from Blockbuster.com and after watching about 12 hours, I'd say I heard only about a third of the dialogue.

What we have here is a HBO quality show along the lines of ""The Wire"", a fictional drama about what the intelligence community in Canada trying to do to investigate crimes in their domain. The line between who is good and who is bad, tends to be more blurred than black and white. The politics of the situation seems at time more evil than the criminal elements themselves.

If it were, it would quickly eclipse the usually predictable and increasingly gory American crime series that Amazon's reviewer seems to prefer.

Unlike many of its American competitors, ""Intelligence"" is not a show that aims at the lowest common denominator.  Instead, it requires a bit of intelligence on the part of the viewer to sort through the convoluted plots and the complex characters, but the effort is worth it. The second season, which just started playing overseas when I returned to the States, is even better, which makes it all the more shameful that the Canadian Broadcasting Company is apparently not going to pick it up for a third season.

I have heard that there is some talk of reviving the series on cable and changing its locale to an American city.  Continuing ""Intelligence"" is a great idea, but changing locales is not.  A series like ""Intelligence"" is tailor-made for American cable, and would fit in very nicely on HBO or Showtime, but it gets most of its unique appeal from its Vancouver location and its incredibly strong Canadian cast.

""Intelligence"" does have a large cast, and you will recognize many of them from the DaVinci series if you have been fortunate enough to see those.  (Acorn - please put that entire series out on DVD!)

I like this show for exactly the reasons that Sam Graham finds fault with it.  There is not gross visualization of violence and gore - because it is written with more development of character than the standard shoot 'em up you will find in U.S. programming.  (How many times can we watch CSI and all those carved up bodies!)
Ian Tracey is great as the low key bad guy you can't help but like and they give the strongest role opposite Tracey's to a woman. Klea Scott as Mary is compelling because she holds her own with the big boys, never using her sexuality to get what she wants.  She uses her brain and intuition  to get the ""Intelligence"" she sees as the way to fight crime in her city.

It is apparent Mr. Graham is not a Canadian and seems to think crime is
neat and tidy in Canada....too whitewashed to be interesting.  Has he not heard of the pig farmer lately?
I live in Seattle and drugs crossing our borders from Canada are a constant worry here.  Amazon is based about a mile from my house, but Graham's lack of understanding of the drug problems in the Northwest make me wonder where he lives!
Readers, pay no mind to Amazon's review of this series.  Take a chance on ""Intelligence"".  I think you will be as fascinated as I have been.

One special facet of this jewel is that it doesn't fall to all the usual cliches about marijuana dealers or strip club operators. Every scene rings absolutely true.

If I were HBO or Showtime I'd re-air the first two seasons while reassembling the cast for another 12 episodes.

Reardon aims to hang onto his empire and stay out of jail until he can get out of the smuggling and marijuana business.

The chess games that unfold between the players are complex, compelling and suspenseful--I've never seen another show like it. Some compare it to ""The Wire"", but the central theme is different.

3353209,4,B0013NAMLU,"This is kind of like a Canadian version of the Wire where everyone is pretty mellow and the bad guys are about as dangerous as girl scouts. I like the show and it is worth watching, but things must be very different in Canada.
The Bad Guys:
Riordon and company run a strip club, a shipping company, and a wholesale pot distribution company. They are pretty nice guys, straight forward and honest as can be for criminals. Even when attacked, they like to sit down and talk things out instead of resorting to violence if they can. ""The Disciples"" are supposedly a dangerous biker gang, but you never see anyone but their leader. He doesn't have a bike, runs a local business, and looks like your grandfather.
The ""Good Guys"": Apparently the Canadian versions of the local cops, state cops, FBI, and CIA all work out of the same building and can move around between organizations. Mary (Klea Scott) is part of what would be the FBI or maybe State Police looking to move to the CIA (CSIS in Canada). The Canadian cops spend about 60% of their time scheming and spying on each other, 36% of their time spying on the crooks and trying to recruit them as informants, and *maybe* 4% of their time actually trying to catch or stop criminals.
You essentially get the somewhat surreal situation where the cops come up with schemes to bust the criminals and then the higher up cops make sure they get away. The DEA/FBI also show up now and again and appear to be violent cowboys and MUCH more dangerous than ANY of the Canadians including the biker gang.",1332201600,,1542,4.530465949820789
3353210,5,B0013NAMLU,"This is TV at it's best.  Sopranos meets The Wire and hangs with DaVinci's Inquest.  Bearing similarities to each of the aforementioned shows, Intelligence stands on it's own and depicts both the criminal underworld and the intelligence world trying to get a handle on things and usually a half-step behind events.
Very, very unfortunate that this only went two seasons.  Produced in 2005-2007, it still feels very fresh and compelling today-everyone has flip phones and there's not a smart-phone to be seen...there's your only clue that it's not 2012.  Great edgy soundtrack/music by Schaun Tozer runs throughout the series.

Check it out, well worth it.  Smart, fast-moving, well-written with compelling characters and good acting and directing...all without over-the-top graphic sex or violence.  The best.  Also streaming on Netflix.

If you have not seen DaVinci's Inquest, and you like this, by all means check out that show.  Also on Canadian Broadcasting and set in Vancouver, it's a great low-key detective drama with Ian Tracey (aka Jimmy Reardon in Intelligence) in a supporting detective role.

3353211,5,B0013NAMLU,"I absolutely loved this series.  I started watching over the summer when there was not a lot of television.  I did not know much about it other than the fact that it was highly rated by viewers on Netflix, and decided to give it a try.  GLAD I DID!  The series began regular broadcasting on October 10, 2006 in Canada on CBC starring Ian Tracey and Klea Scott.  The show follows Jimmy Reardon (Tracey), one of Vancouver's top organized crime bosses, head of a third generation west coast crime syndicate (think Tony Soprano but Canadian), and Mary Spalding (Scott), the director of the Vancouver Organized Crime Unit (OCU) (or our US feds).  Mary Spalding (a complex character who may be good and may not be, highly ambitious and willing to step on anyone who gets in her way) offers Reardon immunity from prosecution in exchange for his role as a police informant. Crime boss Reardon is working to avoid issues with his rival, the Disciples Motorcycle club, who is trying to control Vancouver's marijuana trade and money laundering industry.  This series is dark and gritty, exceptionally well acted, and well worth your time.",1323993600,2,1127,4.808290155440415
3353212,5,B0013NAMLU,"I watched both seasons on Netflix DVD before buying both seasons from Amazon so I could easily watch them again and share with my kids when they visit.

I must say that when it comes to crime drama the Canadians seem to do it so much better than most American series.  Examples the Canadian series Rookie Blue and Flashpoint, but Intelligence is even better.  No gratuitous sex or graphic violence, which is great.  And which means the focus is on the unfolding twists and turns.  Intelligence is sort of a mix of The Killing and MI-5, both of which I love.  In short, unlike most crime dramas, this series has depth.  And it gets deeper from one episode to the next.  Some of the characters don't have quite the depth I would have liked, but the main mobster, played by Ian Tracey, and his ex-wife, played by Camille Sullivan, are compelling.  All of the characters and all of the plots seem quite real, nothing drippy, nothing silly, nothing hokey, in fact, the absolute opposite of drippy-silly-hokey CSI Miami.  Of course some of the characters don't last long, but the ones that matter get more and more entangled.  It's great.

Besides Tracey and Sullivan, there is Klea Scott as Mary Spalding, not pretty but consistent as the driven head of the ""good guys"" ... I say ""good"" but in fact the government folks are just as corrupt and self-serving as the so-called criminals.  Her deputy Matt Frewer as Ted Altman is complex and nasty.  And Bernie Coulson as Michael Reardon is obnoxious but adds value nonetheless.  In fact, all of the main characters contribute actual value to the show.  None of them are played superficially.  Surprisingly, the nicest character is the mob boss, reluctant to resort to violence, a good father to his teenage daughter.  How the various organizations interact is almost as entertaining as how the characters interact.  You have four mob organizations, Jimmy Reardon's, the Vietnamese, the bikers, and the disciples.  And you have several Canadian government units, intelligence, police, etc., and several US units, CIA, DEA, FBI, plus Chinese intelligence.  All interacting badly. I love it.

I started out watching one episode a night and before long I was staying up watching all the episodes on each DVD and I couldn't get them fast enough.  I anticipate a marathon when all of my kids are here for Christmas.",1318982400,,2351,4.8225

Many of the places and people will be familiar to viewers of Dante's Inquest, except the junior cop evolved into a criminal mastermind of sorts.

If one accepts the major premise that US spies spend vast resources penetrating a friendly nation's crime and spy-fighting units,  and worse, that Canadian politicians up to the highest level approve and want to  protect at all costs the  treasonous double agents; then the multiple roles and many threats from inside and outside the 2 leads' worlds make fascinating viewing. ""Intelligence"" denotes their preoccupation with snooping, deception, gossip, any kind of illicit or public fact-gathering, etc. believed necessary to survival; the leads have some kind of code of honor that prevents them from acting on anything less than ""proof,"" unlike real players in these vicious worlds.

3353215,5,B0013NAMLU,"I found ""Intelligence"" on NETFLIX VOD and was captivated within the first ten minutes of the pilot. This is one of the most intelligent, best written, best performed cop dramas anywhere on television. The interwoven story lines offer even more dramatic scope and complexity than did ""Da Vinci"", and both the natural grandeur and the sordid city-scapes of Vancouver once again provide context, and color to the story.

After watching several NETFLIX episodes, I knew I had to own this show, came to Amazon to buy a DVD, and... wow! What have these reviewers been watching that they judged to be so inferior to the tawdry, simplistic kill fests shown on American networks and cable. How could they have missed the point.

Well, there is one explanation. ""Intelligence"" is just too much hard work American TV viewers! I admit that the show would never have made it on US prime time. It simply demands too much concentration, and too long an attention span for the typical viewer. If they'd put it on PBS, then the current ""great"" British thespian would have needed an extra 20 minutes of intro time per episode to bring the dumb colonials up to speed.

However, if you like a show that keeps you constantly puzzling -- sometimes out-guessing, and sometimes being blind-sided by the story line -- this is it. If you like movies in which, whenever there's a wide shot, you're wondering: ""Is that just setting a scene, or is there somebody, or something in the background that will become important later"", then ""Intelligence"" is the one for you.",1315699200,2,1540,4.80377358490566

3353217,3,B0013NAMLU,"I'm surprised by all the positive feedback here. I gave 3.5 stars. The plot is very much convoluted to the point where there is no real plot and it seems the direction of the show is to get everyone in Vancouver wired and on the inside of something. I've never worked for Law Enforcement in Vancouver but I am somewhat familiar with the drug (marijuana) trade around the Alberta/BC region so I found it very hard to swallow that the marijuana market was pulling in millions per week for Jim and that the law would need to wire and bug everything in the city to catch marijuana dealers. I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s New York City scene and I am familiar with all sorts of ""real world"" drug issues so it may be my regional bias that prohibits me from thinking that Vancouver is a crime syndicate capitol of the galaxy. I also didn't quite understand the USA's involvement in any of that nor what it has to do with Chinese triads and Mid-East terrorism or diamonds/guns in the Congo.
Also incredible to swallow was understanding why getting promoted in the ranks is so important to characters (Ted and Deacons) when they clearly showed a contempt for working there and would not gain much more power or salary in promotion. Only once in the first 8 episodes someone mentions salary as a reason for promotion or working elsehwere outside the agency. That said there is some confusion in what the motivation is for the characters. The criminals naturally want to make more money and gain territory for selling pot or ATM machines. Jim to be seen as a villian by the time we meet him is odd because he already seems to already be rich enough to exit this world scotch free with this daughter. He even claims he wants out several times but we know why he stays - the same reason DeNiro went back at the end of Heat. Also as a character I just didn't get that he was ambitious at any point in his past to be at the top of the pot trade. As for the agency, these good guys seem to only be out to impress themselves by acruing informants and wiring everything and not really wanting to catch anyone. After 8 shows you are left thinking they don't even want to catch bad guys anymore just spend government money setting up taps, paying off informants, putting guys on the inside. It is really pointless from a viewer's perspective because we are told that the main criminal carrot is somewhere overseas in Hong Kong or the Mid East so spending billions on informants and taps in the small drug and arms trade in Vancouver seems laughable. This is even expressed between Mary and her lover in one of the early episodes where he says his department spend billions to tap out a criminal that was worth way less.
If anything the main conflict lies more so between law enforcement employees themselves and between the criminals themselves but there is no tension at all between law and crime.
That said, what drives excitement is the communication or lack thereof between the characters that should be talking. Much like the LOST TV show, Intellegence relies of key players not communicating at key times to ramp up the drama. This drags the story out and after LOST I will never dedicate another 6 years to a singular TV show waiting for something spectacular to happen. I suspect this is why this show was axed after 2 seasons.",1306022400,2,3317,4.502487562189055

I agree with another reviewer who was surprised by how easy wire taps are to get in Canada. There are a lot of very odd details like  that in this show that kept me from ever fully embracing it. Intelligence is more on par with network television, something akin to Law & Order. It's watchable and mildly enjoyable but in no way, shape or form is it anywhere near The Wire.

The characters in Intelligence are, in a way, ordinary people. Especially if compared to those shows. They aren't kids on the streets of baltimore slinging crack. They aren't muscle heads in Jersey who no nothing but a life of crime. They do strive to be those things though. I definitely mean no offense by this statement but, these are a bunch a white guys who deal pot in Canada. Not to say that this isn't dangerous or worth having a show about. The show is handled brilliantly. You always get the sense though, that a lot of this is just a facade. They're barely getting by with walking the walk. I found that one of the most intriguing things about it. Also, it's just a very well put together show, with believable characters and an overall great story arc.

Quite a jump by Haddock from the even better Da Vinci Inquest which is slow but has brilliant acting.

After all, Jimmy was still breathing at the end - and that tells me that maybe, just maybe, Chris Haddock, et al., are busy negotiating a green light to bring the series back to life.  I hope so.

3353229,5,B0013NAMLU,"Intelligence is the best television crime drama I have seen yet.  In fact, it might be the best dramatic series, period.  First of all, the casting is excellent.  Every actor is the perfect match for the character he or she plays on the show, all the way from the major roles down to the bit parts.  Ian Tracey plays a man with integrity who just happens to find himself running the family marijuana business.  Matt Brewer is the ultimate creep as an ambitious, double-crossing and back-stabbing intelligence officer.  But there are admirable people in the Canadian intelligence service as well, with Klea Scott taking the strong lead there.

Intelligence manages to be intensely gripping without glorifying violence or the criminal lifestyle.  Much of the time, Jimmy Reardon (Ian Tracey) seems to be looking for a way out of the competitive drug trade, in favor of a normal life for his daughter.  This series is different from any crime drama you will see on American TV, and that is a good thing.",1254441600,4,1000,4.8011695906432745

3353231,5,B0013NAMLU,"Intelligence has been compared to The Wire and other HBO series.  It certainly meets their standards and often surpasses them in plot and character development.  The series (so far -- through the first season and into the first couple of weeks of the second) doesn't throw the kinds of plot surprises at the viewer which indicate that the writers were having a hard time figuring out what to do next. Instead, you become a believer and a fully-engaged partner in the action. Character drives action.  As other reviewers have suggested, it really gets under your skin.

Here's the thing:  The writers of this and other notable Canadian TV series show respect for the viewer.  They don't belabor each point; they don't hammer home each plot twist.  They don't nudge-nudge and they don't overdo.  Of course, the pleasure of watching this series demands a little more imagination and focus than many American series (frequent exception:  The Wire) which seem to play to an attention span of about three minutes.  Result:  the viewer feels respected and drawn in, rather than patronized.

Klea Scott is endlessly compelling; Matt Frewer becomes a wonderfully detestable and (we hope) doomed sleazeball; Bernie Coulson's Mike has you on tenterhooks, waiting for his next screw-up.  Ian Tracey, as the complicated and attractive drug lord, is competent and deft. Throughout each 45 minute episode, a crew of directors has you hooked on the interplay between Vancouver's drug underground and ambitious (not to mention vicious and corrupt) American and Canadian officials.

I envy you if you haven't yet seen this series -- you have a treat in store!",1241222400,2,1641,5.074626865671642
3353232,4,B0013NAMLU,"I watched the entire first season in 2 viewings over the New Years holiday.  I also could not disagree more with the Amazon review.  Point in fact that if I could give 4 1/2-stars I would, as the series is just a notch under perfect.  First and foremost, for a crime drama there is a surprising lack of gratuitous violence.  Could this be a result of the copious amounts of alcohol consumed?  The aforementioned may put many people off that are accustomed to American TV a la ""24"" and the ""CSI Trilogy.""  Violence does lurk beneath the surface, though even when deemed necessary we rarely get to see it on screen.
Perhaps my reason for not giving the series 5-stars is that a good portion of the show is filmed in a strip club with nary a bare breast seen (not sure if this is  a result of CBC sensors or simply a decision made by the producers).  Seriously, it may actually be the lack of gratuitous sex & violence that make this series work, as the focus is more on interior & exterior power struggles and the resulting sub plots, yea? (Apparently, in Vancouver it is common to finish a sentence with ""yea"").  The other interesting aspect to show, which was frequently a topic of discussions among my friends and I, was how such relatively ""soft"" organization could manage a criminal enterprise that generated 9-figures annually?  Again, perhaps this goes to how criminal enterprises are managed in Canada?

I would recommend this series to anyone that is a fan of well written crime dramas sans the sex & violence.  If you pinned me down I would have to say the real reason why this would not rate 5-stars is that the characters are not multi layered, which while may be enough to not generate a fifth star, still place this series in the top tier of anything that is currently in the USA/UK.

End of Intelligence?
I've previously blogged about my fondness for the TV show Intelligence and after the great season finale in December, I now have a free block of time on Monday nights.

Apparently I was not the only one complaining about CBC's lack of advertising and promotion of the show on its network especially prior to the season premiere. The creator of Intelligence, Chris Haddock also points to the lack of promotion as a part of the reason for relatively poor ratings for Intelligence and goes on to accuse CBC of trying to bury the show.

Indeed, it appears that the CBC is unwilling to commit to renewing the series for another season. Judging from message boards and posts, viewers of the show REALLY like it and are passionate about it but I guess if the ratings aren't high enough, the CBC doesn't care.

Is there any hope that the CBC will come to its senses and bring back Intelligence for a third season???",1223424000,3,1171,4.730392156862745

A Canadian friend sent me the pilot copied off TV, and there were captions, which I sorely needed (am slightly hard of hearing, but always use captions for fast-paced series with lots of dialogue).

I got Season 1 from Blockbuster.com and after watching about 12 hours, I'd say I heard only about a third of the dialogue.  I was forced to look up episode guides online and read them before watching each episode, to try to figure out what was happening.

The scripts are - oh yes - intelligent. And the thrill of this series goes deep under the skin. If you have any chance to watch it, do so.

John's comments made it seem interesting - so I gave it a chance and ordered it sight unseen.

Wow!!! What an amazing show. My prejudging of Canuck shows was sorely wrong this time. What we have here is a HBO quality show along the lines of ""The Wire"", a fictional drama about what the intelligence community in Canada trying to do to investigate crimes in their domain. The line between who is good and who is bad, tends to be more blurred than black and white. The politics of the situation seems at time more evil than the criminal elements themselves.

3353243,5,B0013NAMLU,"I first started watching this show on the Hallmark Channel in Eastern Europe -- unfortunately, it is not being broadcast in the United States.  If it were, it would quickly eclipse the usually predictable and increasingly gory American crime series that Amazon's reviewer seems to prefer.

Unlike many of its American competitors, ""Intelligence"" is not a show that aims at the lowest common denominator.  Instead, it requires a bit of intelligence on the part of the viewer to sort through the convoluted plots and the complex characters, but the effort is worth it. The second season, which just started playing overseas when I returned to the States, is even better, which makes it all the more shameful that the Canadian Broadcasting Company is apparently not going to pick it up for a third season.

I have heard that there is some talk of reviving the series on cable and changing its locale to an American city.  Continuing ""Intelligence"" is a great idea, but changing locales is not.  A series like ""Intelligence"" is tailor-made for American cable, and would fit in very nicely on HBO or Showtime, but it gets most of its unique appeal from its Vancouver location and its incredibly strong Canadian cast. If it is to be revived, it should stay in Vancouver.",1209945600,49,1264,4.855813953488372
3353244,5,B0013NAMLU,"I could not disagree more with Sam Graham's analysis of this program (see Amazon's review).  First, he unfortunately compares what he considers failings of this show with U.S. programming.  Who ever said programming in the States is something writers should try to emulate!
""Intelligence"" does have a large cast, and you will recognize many of them from the DaVinci series if you have been fortunate enough to see those.  (Acorn - please put that entire series out on DVD!)

I like this show for exactly the reasons that Sam Graham finds fault with it.  There is not gross visualization of violence and gore - because it is written with more development of character than the standard shoot 'em up you will find in U.S. programming.  (How many times can we watch CSI and all those carved up bodies!)
Ian Tracey is great as the low key bad guy you can't help but like and they give the strongest role opposite Tracey's to a woman. Klea Scott as Mary is compelling because she holds her own with the big boys, never using her sexuality to get what she wants.  She uses her brain and intuition  to get the ""Intelligence"" she sees as the way to fight crime in her city.

It is apparent Mr. Graham is not a Canadian and seems to think crime is
neat and tidy in Canada....too whitewashed to be interesting.  Has he not heard of the pig farmer lately?
I live in Seattle and drugs crossing our borders from Canada are a constant worry here.  Amazon is based about a mile from my house, but Graham's lack of understanding of the drug problems in the Northwest make me wonder where he lives!
Readers, pay no mind to Amazon's review of this series.  Take a chance on ""Intelligence"".  I think you will be as fascinated as I have been.  Chris Haddock continues to produce writing for our times - realistic writing with well developed characters and doesn't depend on shock value to hold an audience.

8252440,5,B0013NAMLU,"This is a terrific Canadian series by Chris Haddock (who occasionally does a cameo). He also created DaVinci's Inquest and DaVinci's City Hall. (Please don't confuse it with the American TV series by the same name; and sadly no where as good.) Here, the Gemini Award winning Intelligence is about collecting information in exchange for immunity. It's unbelievable how much can be exchanged in a quick conversation through a car window, but Haddock knows how. He's proved that over and over.

Ian Tracey does a star turn in Intelligence as Jimmy Reardon, the head of an organized crime business in Vancouver, BC. It's one of the few stories of this type where you cheer for the bad guys. But the bad guys are smart and have their code. Supporting cast is more than competent and includes Klea Scott, John Cassini, Camille Sullivan, Matt Frewer and Eugene Lipinski (all alumni of DaVinic's Inquest). Yes, even Klea Scott had a nonspeaking role in an episode of DaVinci's City Hall. (She sat in on a meeting.)

Although American viewers seem to know no bounds when it comes to violence, the violence in this series is subdued by American standards and infrequent. Still, Intelligence may offend some viewers who don't care for profanity and nudity (Jimmy runs his many illegal businesses from his strip club).

Filmed in Vancouver (as in DaVinci's Inquest), this is quality TV. And you'll find yourself rooting for the bad guys!
