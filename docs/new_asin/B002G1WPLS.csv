3924583,4,B002G1WPLS,"Consider taking the entire 2nd season of Deth Note and craming it into an hour....and you have this movie. That being said, it was actually entertaining even to a fan of the series. I would recommend it to someone who has already seen the series but not to someone who hasn't.",1366416000,2,276,4.431372549019608
3924584,4,B002G1WPLS,If you have the series don't bother. The movies are just the series in a compact version. Although if you want to save some money and see the series this is a good option.,1364169600,2,171,4.0588235294117645
3924585,3,B002G1WPLS,You see the movie was a bit disappointing. The omitted my favorite character scenes from the real show. For example Mello is barely in it at all... although L is in the beginning..that was funny. Unfortunately like with the first movie if you didn't watch the show it doesn't make sense even though it was made for people that haven't seen the show. Seeing as how I dislike Near's character I wasn't fond of this movie but what can you do...oh yeah watch the show! the movie delivery however was the antithesis of disappointing! I got the two DVDs I ordered 2 days earlier than I expected!,1316390400,3,589,4.514018691588785
3924586,4,B002G1WPLS,"Pretty well done for a summation of the second season. There's at least 20 minutes of new animation made to compress certain events at the beginning. Though I would have liked to see an an extended ending more akin to the manga as this is labeled a director's cut.

This is a fair buy for a hardcore Death Note fan, or someone who has seen the original series but doesn't want to buy the whole thing.",1276473600,2,400,4.2631578947368425
3924587,5,B002G1WPLS,This RE light unlike the first feels less like a recap in the first RE Light most of it was a recap with some scenes I don't remember but this RE Light is a must buy I don't want to ruin it for you but is you love the series buy it.,1270944000,,232,3.480769230769231
3924588,1,B002G1WPLS,"As you can probably tell from my choice of review title, I did not like this special very much. It's basically like the first special in that it is a clip show but it also adds more things. Of course, that's not a good thing as it's all for the worst. It changes certain things so they don't fit with other events in the series or even certain characters' motivations. I know that this was made for people who haven't seen Death Note but if you're going to watch this then you should really just watch the original series as it's exponentially better than this.

So in conclusion, this is basically a milking of the series that subtracts everything that's really good about the actual anime. Don't watch it unless you're a hardcore Death Note fan and even then I really wouldn't recommend it. I've gotta admit that one star is pretty harsh but it really screwed stuff up and was made purely to gain a profit off of a series that's already been done. And done well.",1267574400,8,964,4.415730337078652
3924589,3,B002G1WPLS,"That's basically all it is. I read the manga so I knew what I was watching, but I bet to people who have no idea what it's about, it would not make sence. The reason I like it is because of the special features on it! HOORAY!!!!",1261958400,,228,3.872340425531915
3924590,2,B002G1WPLS,"Due to this being a review of the second of two specials which condensed the entire 37 episode TV series into roughly four hours, I'm going to skip describing the story and covering what all semi-decent reviews of the TV series should by default, such as art/animation and sound. If I covered those aspects, I might as well be typing a review for the TV series instead. As I type this, I'm assuming the readers will already by familiar with Death Note, though I will hold back in order to avoid revealing all to those not in the know.

-----------

First of all, don't assume I hate Death Note because of my 5/10 score. The reverse is true - I love Death Note, it being one of very few titles to receive top marks from yours truly. Madhouse did a wonderful job of fitting 50+ chapters into 11.5 episodes with the last half of the story. The sappy 'original ending' marathon aside, it's the best manga adaptation I've seen to date, it actually improving on the manga by removing the content that slowed down the second half of the story needlessly. However, when they tried to fit the entire second half into 90 minutes - INCLUDING an introduction and two minutes of credits - the writing was already on the wall.

Right from the start, I had a feeling it wasn't going to be very good.. or, to be more precise, I had a feeling I'd be here, trying to express why I hated it. It started with L making a 'surprise' return, summarizing the first half, with new... animation. But there were only two shots of L - one with him standing at a distance and one from the side of his face - and only his lips moved. At that moment, I couldn't help but think of how little effort went into this special. And this turned out to true in the case of nearly all of the 'new' footage created in a failed attempt to connect a butchered version of the story, with a lot of awkward looking facial art and limited animation.

...Oh, yes, I mentioned 'sappy' above. If you happen to approve of the Madhouse ending and are in desperate need of something else to complain about, Madhouse delivered with one of the few truly new scenes added - one not added to simplify the story. (NOTE: My comments about this scene are NOT accurate for the official English translation release.) The scene in question involves L, via a TV screen, explaining to the kids at Wammy's House how he's an idiot and, because he's an idiot, how he's afraid of being lied to. He rambles for awhile, pointing out how he loves the human race for their idiocy (the kids all pay attention because of this dramatic speech), and then it was over. I'm unsure if the Japanese > French > Engrish translation improved this scene or not, but it added nothing of value.

Anyway, moving away from sappy goings on and onto inconsistencies. Because of the huge amount of content that was cut (removal > rewrite), there are numerous inconsistencies present. The most bothersome inconsistency occurred towards the end, when Aizawa entered THE warehouse. In the full story, he goes in to confirm the identity of those inside, him having seen them all already beforehand... but the scene where he saw those people prior to that wasn't included in this special. How in the name of God could he have known if they were the real deal or not when he'd never seen them before? Was he upgraded to a psychic in order to further shorten the length? HOW!?

Maybe even worse yet, Near knew right from the start the identity of Kira. Death Note fans should be aware that Near, though suspicious, only became certain of the identity of Kira after interacting with him for awhile and nearly getting burned as a consequence. But in this woeful attempt at shortening the story, he just knew.

There are many other points I could mention, such as Light acquiring the services of Mikami and Takada before Near came into the picture - the special not even showing why Mikami or Takada were selected - but I won't to avoid going on forever. Just believe me when I say it's as much of a mess as you'd expect an attempt at condensing an already condensed last half of a story to be.

Fear not, though, as we aren't done yet. Not even close. I've saved the best for last.

Remember Light's dad? You know, that guy you never remember the name of and instead just refer as Light's dad? Yeah, him. Did you like the drama involving him in the TV series, where the climax of his story resulted in Light showing his true colours, and later played a key part in Matsuda's anger towards the end? Well, too bad - he isn't even mentioned in this... you know what; I'm tired of calling this a friggin' special. He isn't even a part of this S***. No shot of him, no explanation, no nothing. Madhouse remembered to get re-voiced Light dialogue to work around Matsuda's rage, but they couldn't be bothered to explain why Light's dad vanished into thin air. If it was me, and I wanted to butcher one my favourite things in existence, I'd at least have the decency to pull a sudden retirement out of my arse.

Linking into this wonderful omission is Mello, also known by the name of a certain Al Pacino movie in certain circles. But, clearly, Madhouse are not fond of his other name because, like with the poor old father of Light, they forgot to mention how he got his scar. He enters the picture without a scar, the ENTIRE mafia story is removed and then he re-emerges with a surprisingly more attractive face. Why even bother explaining such things? It isn't as if a Death Note newbie is going to be unlucky enough to watch only the... not-so-special-specials and wonder why such an illogical story is so loved. No siree bob!

...You know what, enough of this. All you really need to know is that this is garbage, with a high average rating only because of fanboyism beyond even my Death Note loving understanding. Even the music placement is off, Light's marathon being made worse as a result. If you like Death Note, stay the hell away or you'll more than likely end up imitating me, maybe with a slightly lower paragraph count. If you hate Death Note, by all means watch it - you'll find a lot to moan about and fulfillment. But, whatever you do, don't make the mistake of judging the manga and/or TV series based on this or its slightly less disappointing but by no means special prequel.
