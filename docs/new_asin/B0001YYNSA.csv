2043342,5,B0001YYNSA,"If the Disney wartime cartoons were perhaps the most obscure and hard-to-find, then the black and white Mickey Mouse shorts presented in this volume are without a doubt next in line. With never-before-released and rarely seen (since their original debut more than 70 years ago!) shorts, this collection of 40 Mickey Mouse cartoons, is a definite must-have for any serious Disney collector. Only a few shorts, such as ""Shanghaied,"" ""The Haunted House,"" and ""Mickey's Good Deed,"" had been released previously as part of the cartoon compilations that came out on video during the 80's. The rest are here for the first time on DVD and only the few devoted and lucky people who watched and enjoyed when Disney Channel actually played these shorts, may even know or recognize them. Some, such as ""Mickey's Mellerdremmer,"" which shows Mickey and the Gang portraying the characters from Uncle Tom's Cabin, and ""Mickey's Man Friday"" featuring cannibals, are presented here, as with every other single short, UNCUT and UNEDITED, regardless of their definitely un-PC content. There is actually a section of the second disc dedicated to ten shorts that showcase what modern audiences may consider as unacceptable stereotypes and behaviors, especially coming from a Mickey Mouse cartoon. A virtual comic strip, an interview, a featurette and a gallery round up this DVD release that will undoubtedly be a favorite for anyone who loves and collects Disney animated shorts.",1102464000,18,1458,5.235042735042735
2043343,5,B0001YYNSA,"If you are a fan of vintage cartoons as I am, you have probably already purchased this set or it is on its way. This set makes up the B&W Mickey shorts that were passed over in the first volume, when Disney was unsure of the current popularity of these cartoons. The most important thing about this set is that most of these cartoons have not been shown on television for decades, if at all. The most historically important thing is that most were directed by Ub Iwerks, originator of the Mickey Mouse style and some would say the inspiration for Japan's Manga style for the past half century. These films are rare gems that should be in any collection, and are extremely effective as entertainment for any child. The often overlooked character, Horace Horsecollar is also featured in most of these shorts.",1102291200,29,806,4.643356643356643
2043344,4,B0001YYNSA,"This series is a dream come true since the first day of DVD, because you can choose any cartoon you like and have them all together. But this year the back cover is not printed on the tin but only a piece of paper poorly sticked to the box so it immediately falls apart! Also the ""bond"" around the tin was not included anymore. Beginning last year they stopped hammering the number into the metal, only a card saying 164,572 / 175,000. Cheap treatment for a prestige article. Content is great but there are so few truly special packaged editions that this is a sad development.",1102291200,6,577,4.452830188679245
2043345,5,B0001YYNSA,"The second volume in the Mickey in Black & white from the Disney Treasures collection picks up where volume one left off and gives us all 40 of the remaining mickey mouse shorts.

I'm guessing most of these shorts have not been seen in ages.  I personally have always preferred the old style, black-eye only look of mickey to the more modern look of today.

And of course, nothing beats the classic animation from the 30's and 40's before studios started doing things on the cheap.

Among my favorites in this collection are:

""Mickey's Mechanical Man"" - Mickey's built a robot named Champ who's going to win Mickey a prize by fighting Beppo the Gorilla, the Kongo Killer, in a boxing ring.

""The Haunted House""

""Mickey's Pal, Pluto""

""traffic Troubles"" - Mickey is a taxi driver. He takes Percy Pig to an appointment, but loses him on the way. His next fare doesn't fare much better; Minnie must go to her music lesson, but a detour through a barnyard and an encounter with a snake-oil salesman ruin that plan, too.

Well...there's lots more.  This is just fantastic stuff.  It's animation the way it isn't done anymore.

Add to that a whole host of extras:  Leonard Maltin introductions, ""Mickey's Mania: Collecting Mickey Merchandise"", ""Mickey's Portrait Artist: John Hench"", ""Mickey's Sunday Funnies: A Virtual Comic Strip"", Still Frame Galleries, etc.

Great stuff and highly recommended.",1097452800,33,1394,4.927038626609442

Most of the cartoons are very entertaining and are among my favorite cartoons of all time. Many of the cartoons have never been released on video or shown on the Disney Channel. Some were shown on the Disney Channel, but were censored when shown. Some of the most entertaining cartoons and some of my favorites, such as The Moose Hunt, Mickey In Arabia, Trader Mickey, Mickey's Good Deed, Mickey's Mellerdrammer, and Mickey's Man Friday have not been shown (or shown censored) due to gun violence or racial/ethnic stereotypes. Although such scenes would still be objectionable to some, the cartoons are very special and need to be seen complete and uncensored. Cartoons that are considered to have objectionable scenes will be shown in a special section of Disc 2 called From The Vault. Leonard Maltin will do a special introduction for this section.

I have seen all these cartoons uncensored and look forward to a DVD set with nicer quality picture and sound.

Among the uncensored cartoons, one of my favorites is Mickey's Good Deed - a great Christmas cartoon, which shows the close friendship between Mickey and Pluto.",1091577600,143,2651,4.888641425389755

2043356,5,B0001YYNSA,"While this set is one of the least likely to get played over and over, it is still a very important collection for a fans of animation and Disney. The 21 shorts presented here on disc one are very monotonous with very similar themes for the most part. I had a hard time watching these all back to back, but I did enjoy them for what they are. The shorts all look very good considering their age, but I did notice one short that looked like it wanted to flip, like the olds days when the vertical hold on your TV set wouldn't hold.(if you don't remember TV's with a vertical and horizontal dials, don't bother worrying about it. It's just one small glitch in an otherwise great looking collection, it doesn't go on for long and it doesn't flip, it just jiggles a little.

2043367,4,B0001YYNSA,"For eight years, Mickey reigned supreme in the world of cinema in black and white.  So many shorts were produced during that time that the Disney Company released them in two different sets.  This is the second 2 disc set, and it contains 40 more shorts.

As with volume one of these shorts, they cover the entire eight year range.  ""The Barn Dance"" was originally released in 1928 and ""Mickey's Kangaroo"" from 1935 closes out the collection.  Along the way, we get to see Mickey and the art of animation grow up.  Those first shorts are rather crude and simple with an over reliance on gags and music.  But when we get to disc two and such shorts as ""Mickey's Mechanical Man"" or ""Mickey's Good Deed,"" we see the beginnings of the great storytelling that Disney would become well known for.

That's not to say there aren't some fun shorts here.  ""Traffic Troubles"" and ""Mickey's Choo Choo"" have some good laughs.

Noticeably absent here are Donald and Goofy except in ""Mickey's Mellerdrammer.""  Instead, Mickey is joined by Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horse as well as Minnie and Pluto.

I was thrilled to see here that all the cartoons with potentially objectionable content were lumped together on disc two.  That means we only get host Leonard Maltin's warning about the content once instead of on each cartoon.  You still can't skip it, which is a pain, but at least you don't have to sit through it 10 times.

The disc includes some cool features.  There's an interview with John Hench about his work creating Mickey's official portraits.  We also get a tour of a Mickey collector's collection.  Disc two provides us with a story from the Sunday comic strips of the day as well as the standard galleries of artwork related to these cartoons.

Because of their age and lack of polish, these cartoons might not appeal to today's kids.  But Disney fanatics and nostalgia fans will love getting their hands on this collection.",1213315200,2,1925,4.723723723723723

These are cartoons that supposedly contain elements that may be offensive to today's audience (usually racial stereotypes), although in some of them I didn't notice anything that would be considered offensive.

2043380,5,B0001YYNSA,"I have to say if you're a fan of vintage black-and-white cartoons you have to get this.  This disc set starts with 1928's ""The Barn Dance,"" which was the fourth Mickey Mouse short (and the second one Disney produced in sound).  Already the Disney staff was improving upon what they had set the course with the previous ""Steamboat Willie.""  And as you go along with the shorts according to chronological order, you can see how the animation improves as time goes along, as well as how the Disney staff learnd to use a more structured way of storytelling.  (Certainly using storyboards had a postive effect on the series, which really was not done before Mickey.  Some of these storyboard drawings you can check out on Disc Two.)  Some of the early sound Mickey shorts might not have been big on plot but they had a lot of music and gags.  Some of the best cartoons from this collection are ""Barnyard Broadcast"" (in which a cat and four kittens interrupt Mickey's radio broadcast), ""The Barn Dance,"" ""Delivery Boy,"" and ""Playful Pluto.""  ""The Barnyard Concert,"" done in 1930, is a prototype for the color ""The Band Concert"" (which would come five years later), in where Mickey conducts an orchestra in a barnyard despite continuing mishaps.

As noted in previous reviews, the cartoons that conatain racial or ethnic stereotypes are put in the separate ""From The Vault"" section on Disc Two.  The intro to that section has Leonard Maltin explaining the context to the Al Jolson ""Mammy"" jokes as well as the play/novel ""Uncle Tom's Cabin.""  Another cartoon that gets placed in that section, ""The Moose Hunt,"" has a scatological joke that one does not expect from Disney.  (BTW I understand why that intro was made, I just wish I could skip or skim through it.  Having to go through that again and again just I could see the cartoons themselves gets quite redundant.)

Overall this is a great collection.  It makes me want to check out ""Mickey Mouse In Black and White Volume 1.""",1105833600,11,1973,4.728070175438597

I mean, there was never much trouble back when I was a kid seeing the old Warner bros. cartoons, the early Fleschier-popeye cartoons(which to me were the best cartoons of all!) The one Cartoon that has become as rarely seen as these early Mickeys is the Fleschiers classic, full length ""Hoppity goes to town"".

  But it seems with thye release of these 1st Mickey cartoons we have the answer to why we never see them, & the answer is provided by Leonard Maltin. The Disney studios was afraid that Mickey Mouse, the character that CREATED THEM, was offensive! They seem to believe that, instead of laughing out loud (as the kids who watched them at our house on x-mas did) children will cry & go hide under their beds.

  By the way, can anyone tell me why ""Mickeys good deed"" a cartoon I had never seen before but now think might be the finest Christmas cartoon ever made, was included in the ""from the vault"" section?? What could have been offinsive about it? The fact that it is an X-mas story & Jews, Muslims, etc don't celebrate x-mas???

As has been said elsewhere, the main beefs about volume one have been met...the EBIL NON PC cartoons with the WICKED RACIAL JOKES (it's odd that no-one ever seems to single out the ethnic Jewish gags that feature in pre-war Disney shorts either in colour or black and white, but skin colour...WWWWOOOOAAAAHHHH!) have all been segregated so they get one warning from Leonard Maltin and then you can ""Play All"", which couldn't be done with Vol One, probably due to fears of offending those who might inadvertently use these cartoons as electronic babysitting wallpaper.

One I loved was ""The Haunted House"" with animation reused from ""The Skeleton Dance"" ... if the PC part can be skimmed over this would be great at Hallowe'en even now. The Iwerks animation of the earlier shorts is fantastic, with a vitality that seems to fade as the artwork becomes more, well, artistic with movement being rendered more realistically. I don't regret getting this one.

Gripe? Disney will probably never issue this as Region 2...they've only put out the first ""MM in living colour"" disc as far as I know, and this stuff while being a MUST HAVE for a cartoon lover isn't kiddie fodder or mass market material.

I'm just glad that they didn't whack on a collectors price for such collectable material.",1104624000,2,1426,4.788617886178862
2043383,4,B0001YYNSA,"""Mickey Mouse in Black and White, Volume Two"" (1928-35) represents another valuable treasure trove of early Disney animation. The remaining 40 cartoons in this collection range from Ub Iwerks gems such as ""The Barn Dance"" (1928) and ""When the Cat's Away"" (1929) to politically incorrect obscurities along the lines of ""Mickey in Arabia"" (1932) and ""Mickey's Man Friday"" (1935). Upon viewing these shorts in chronological order, one notices the increased skill of the Disney animators and, sadly, the gradual diminution of Mickey's character - from naughty cartoon star to squeaky-clean nonentity. Though Volume One showcased many of the finest black-and-white shorts, the second volume has its share of classics, including ""Traffic Troubles"" (1931), ""Mickey's Mechanical Man"" (1933) and ""Mickey's Steam Roller"" (1934). With more than five hours of material, this DVD set is a must-have for animation buffs.",1104624000,3,906,5.572463768115942
2043384,3,B0001YYNSA,"As a hardcore Disney fan, the Treasures series is a dream come true -- and I certainly won't rest until I have every single cartoon from the Disney vault.  I originally owned Mickey in B&W Vol 1 when it was on Laserdisc fifteen years ago; and knowing then that there were a few missing, I am thrilled to have this second volume.

But unfortunately, the people at Disney seem very much ashamed of their cartoons.  On most of the Disney Treasure series, any appearance of a gun, an obscure racial stereotype or the use of the word ""Mammy"" is preceeded by a gushing apology from Leonard Maltin, explaining how back in the Dark Ages of the 1930's, people weren't as enlightened as they are today, and that we shouldn't judge too harshly.

But what the Disney people don't realize is that most people today don't know who Al Jolson was and won't know what ""Mammy"" is referring to.  By pointing out these often hard-to-spot gags (one is a face-shaped balloon floating in the background), it just makes us notice them and even look for them.

But this particular collection goes beyond the previous collections, which is why I can't give this one 5 stars.  They have taken all the cartoons that could be remotely offensive, including most of the best in this collection(including a classic Christmas cartoon), and placed them in a separate section.  To access this section, you have to sit through a three-minute apology from Leonard Maltin, which cannot be skipped or scanned -- you have to sit through it every single time you watch these cartoons.  They call this section ""From the Vault"", which I took to mean that they hadn't been seen in many years.  Actually, they mean that these cartoons should only be watched alone, by adults, in the dark of night -- each time making me feel like a prurient pervert.

Still, I do applaud Disney for releasing these, especially their WWII collection, without censoring them for our delicate modern minds.  But I do wish they would stop treating their own classics as though they might turn us all into gun-wielding Nazi racists.",1104105600,82,2065,4.721448467966574
2043385,4,B0001YYNSA,"The best of the black and white Mickeys, and the best known all went on the first set.  Leaving, obviously, the lesser cartoons for this follow-up collection.  But second rate Mickey is still first class entertainment, and most of these cartoons are entertaining indeed.

As with the previous set, the worst aspect of the collection is Leonard Maltin.  WHY can't he trust his viewers to have a little intelligence?

In vol. I, any cartoon that contained humor that was less than PC by contemporary standards was burdened with a brief introduction warning us about what we were about to see. In this volume, all those 'offensive' cartoons are clustered together in a separate section of the second disk, labeled ""From the Vault."" Apparently these cartoons are so offensive that they have to be locked away in a vault, and only viewed after Maltin has given us a detailed apology about how people were so unenlightened in the 1930's and '40's that they put such horrific content in their cartoons. And that, while SOME people might want to lock these films away for all eternity, HE believes that it's ok to watch them, if only to help us understand how much times have changed. Sigh...

 To make it worse, every time you want to view ANY cartoon from 'the vault' you have to first sit through the commentary. The disk won't allow you to fast forward through it. And, to be honest, I couldn't even figure out what was supposed to be so 'offensive' about several of the shorts in 'the vault.'

Still, if you can put up with Maltin, this is a wonderful set, and well worth owning for any fan of Disney or early animation. (BTW, if there are any easter eggs on the disks, I haven't been able to find them.)",1103587200,19,1701,4.590759075907591
2043386,5,B0001YYNSA,"Mickey Mouse in Black and White Volume 2 brings all of the shorts left out of the first volume, uncut and uncensored. Disney enthusiasts/collectors should all own this long-awaited set, and just the casual viewer may enjoy them as well. Included are the final 40 shorts, completing the collection of Mickey Mouse cartoons. From the first short on the set to the latest ""Mickey's Kangaroo"" there can be seen clear artistic progress in not only the quality of the animation but also the telling of the stories within each cartoon.

The picture quality of the set is as good as it could be. For cartoons 70+ years old, some dust and grain should be expected. But most of them are great quality. Each short has been restored from the original negatives and they really do look great. The picture is sharp and crisp and I applaude Disney for their work in restoring these pictures. The sound quality is not great by today's standards, but I am sure that it is even better here than it ever was during the original releases. There were a few shorts that tell you that the original opening music cue has not survived, maybe about 5 of them in all. So while things aren't 100% perfect remember that these are very old cartoons.

The content of this Treasures series is very good. Few of these shorts have been seen by the general public in a long time and some maybe have not been released at all due to ethnic/racial stereotypes and uncharacteristic behavior (violence, tobacco use). One such short is ""Mickey's Mellerdrama"" where Mickey and the gang put on a play about Uncle Tom's Cabin. But unlike previous waves where Maltin would have to put each short into its historical perspective, the potentially offensive shorts are all in a section on disk 2 titled From the Vaults. This was a great move on Disney's part. You can now hear Leonard Maltin explain that the shorts back then were not meant to be offensive during their original inception but that parents should cautiously allow their children to watch them and take the time to put it into context so children will not interpret them the wrong way. This handling of the non-PC shorts should please everyone displeased in the past with the Maltin introductions. Also, there is a Play All feature which is great to just kick back and enjoy the whole set at your own leisure. The extras are worth a look also, and they include the following:

* Mickey Mania: Collecting Mickey Merchandise

* Mickey's Portrait Artist: John Hench

* 'Pioneer Days' And 'The Castaway' In Several Versions

* Art Galleries: Mickey Mouse, Fully Covered; Mickey's Poster Archive; Background Paintings; Animation Drawings

The final verdict is that MMIBW V 2is a great addition to he treasures line and is in my opinion near the top of the sets released so far. It is great to now own all of the Mickey Mouse shorts, most obscure and locked in the Disney Vault until now. Yeah, the quality of the collectible tin has decreased with each wave(the certificate of authenticity instead of the stamped tin, there is no longer the blue banner to hold the tin together, and the details of the set that used to be printed on the back are now on paper glued to the back of the tin), but it is what is inside that counts here, a wealth of animation and Disney history to be enjoyed by the young and old alike.",1103587200,4,3327,4.619289340101523
2043387,5,B0001YYNSA,"While Volume One of Mickey Mouse In Black and White covered more conventional, well-known shorts, Volume Two (this one) covers the rest.

Who's ever seen WILD WAVES or JUNGLE RHYTHM? THE SHINDIG? THE CASTAWAY? After watching the Disney Channel's various morning shows that showcased 1930s/40s Disney shorts, I never recalled seeing these.

Some go from the hillarious ( THE BARNYARD BATTLE and THE PLOWBOY) to the simply bizzare (WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY).

You will note many cultural, stereotypcial, and racial satiric concepts, but please understand them historical as a sign of the times.

2043388,5,B0001YYNSA,"This ""volume 2"" of Mickey Mouse in Black and White is superb.  Perhaps in response to complaints about volume 1, volume 2 includes a ""Play All"" option, and we get fewer of Leonard Maltin's banal cautions that ""This cartoon may be hazardous to your child's political correctness.""  Certain cartoons with racial stereotypes are grouped in a separate section of disc 2 (""From the Vault"") that is not linked to ""Play All.""  This is not a bad way to handle the issue.",1102723200,5,462,4.679012345679013

The sound is good, the stories just aren't funny! The stories, 1928-30+, are subtitled and closed captionedthe modern extras have neither (a mistake in my opinion).
