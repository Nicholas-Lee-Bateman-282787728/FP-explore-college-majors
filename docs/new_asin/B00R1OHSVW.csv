6897985,4,B00R1OHSVW,Good movie. Anyone who doesn't rate it as such only likes marvel flicks and big productions. I always saw scott adkins as an athlete but over time his acting is improving and he is getting better and better.,1427328000,4,207,4.473684210526316
6897986,1,B00R1OHSVW,"This movie is amazing if you love wearing TapOut shirts and seeing muscly guys pound on each other for 90 minutes. I don't know why anyone else would want to watch this. There's no resemblance to football firms, period. Firms don't fight in the streets or at matches anymore, they go to underground fight clubs?  Come ON.

The first film was great. This is a piece of garbage.",1426464000,,376,4.514705882352941

8693733,5,B00R1OHSVW,"Scott was amazing as usual, though this was an unusual role for him. Very gritty and realistic and much more acting from him than we get to see in most films. This is where most people say how surprised they are he can act.",1473033600,,223,4.090909090909091

8693737,2,B00R1OHSVW,Really quite terrible. The first one was much better this seemed so forced.,1443225600,,75,4.846153846153846

8693739,2,B00R1OHSVW,"Scott Adkins is good in almost anything, and I like films that give him a chance to really act. But it took me days to force myself to finish this movie. The idea sounds great: Going undercover to find out who killed your brother on the street fighting circuit. But there's just not enough action in the first half, and the fights in the second half are not choreographed with the skill and spark we've come to expect from a Scott Adkins movie.",1441238400,3,444,4.36144578313253
