614418,5,6303262368,"This movie had an incredible influence on people's prejudices and misconceptions about AIDS at the very start of the epidemic. Although it was done in a somewhat campy format, its message about the goverment and pharmaceutical companies was loud and clear - ""Blinded by Greed."" For those who are interested in the history of AIDS or wasn't there at the start and want to know more, this movie is a required viewing. The only warning is this movie isn't for the young or homophobic.",1193443200,3,481,4.738095238095238

614420,5,6303262368,"When I saw that the only reviewer of this fine film had given it one star and raked it over the coals, I felt compelled to write a review that gave a fair critique of the film.

The film is amazing on many levels.  As a musical, it works.  If not for the subject matter, I bet Broadway would have scooped it up.  The song ""Six of Seven Things"" is beautiful as are ""Just Like Scherazade"" and ""Zero Patience."" More importantly, the politics of the piece are important.  While we no longer point fingers as one individual ""Patient Zero"" of AIDS, our culture still engaged in the rhetoric of blame when it comes to the disease in our demarcation of the ""innocents"" infected via blood transfusion and those who practice unsafe sex or engage in drug use.  Zero's proclamation, ""Tell the story, clear my name.  We don't need someone to blame"" echoes today in a culture that indicts those that engage in high risk activities as somehow deserving of the virus.

The film's creative vision is ingenious.  The incorporation of the Victorian sexologist Sir Richard Burton as Zero's lover is brilliant!  The theme of detecting the truth about the disease shows that things have not changed all that much in a hundred years.  The motif of Burton's ""A Thousand Nights and One Night"" into Zero telling his own story in his own words is indicative of the powerful meshing of creative genius with radical polemic.

The film was one of the first to really give an honest voice to a gay man with AIDS.  I defy anyone to say that films like ""An Early Frost"" or ""Grief"" or ""Parting Glances"" or ""Longtime Companion"" are as powerful and important as this one.  AIDS does not serve as watered down melodrama here.  It is the vehicle to indict a diseased society for its intolerance.  This is one of the most underrated films of all time. Sure, it has singing anuses, but the ruse is used to question a cultural obsession with embracing Freud's death drive.  You're not going to see that kind of intelligent engagement in the myriad other films about AIDS that use it invoke pathos, not profundity.

Buy this film.  It is a truly beautiful piece of art!",1125964800,11,2127,4.579365079365079
614421,5,6303262368,"I had the good fortune to see this film not once, or twice, but three times at the theatre.  I saw it first at the Atlanta GLBT Film Festival.
From the director of URINAL, style and visual magic to spare.  Plus, the longest sustained note ever held by a human on a soundtrack -- move over Ms. Streisand!
The music is angry, saddening, funny, sexual, and WAY danceable.  This is a classic movie musical with a wide variety of musical styles.  Think RENT without the whiney artists.  Instead you get the unlikely pair of Richard Burton (the man who discovered the source of the Nile, not Mr. Liz Taylor) and Patient Zero (the man purported to be the initial source of HIV in the US).
Beautiful arrangements.  Sly lyrics.  And there are the singing (...) puppets!  How can you miss?
If you love movie musicals, and want to see something every bit as good as Hedwig -- buy the movie AND the CD of Zero Patience.  You won't be sorry.",1007078400,3,928,4.411764705882353
614422,5,6303262368,"For a film that was made in 1993, it is still is valid today.  The double meanings in ""Zero Patience"" are the intolerance and discrimination that people living with HIV/AIDS must face and the zero patience that Gatan has as a ghost and scapegoat in being blamed for literally spreading the disease throughout North America.  Greyson has camped it up in this film mocking the physique bodies from the 40s and 50s mail order mags, the musical, the documentary, and the interview.  And they say Canadians can't make movies.  Be sure to check out Lilies, Urinal, and Uncut.  Also check out Greyson's 22 compliation Video Against AIDS, his contribution of the best videos produced from 1986-1988 available from most universities and community AIDS organizations.
For reviewers:  when posting reviews please be accurate with your information.  John Greyson is a Canadian director from Toronto, not the USA.  Normand Fauteaux plays Zero/Gatan, not Michel Callen who plays the superb role of Miss HIV.",1005004800,3,993,5.124223602484472
614423,5,6303262368,"I don't like the public much so I rarely go to the movies, and until recently the cinemas in my town were smelly and uncomfortable.  Yet I went to this film and forgot where I was.  It made me laugh like Peter Jackson's  ""Braindead"".  And it made me think about anthropology, and the  complicity of us all in the reproduction of social exclusion.
As  reviewers have noted, ""Zero Patience"" responds to Randy Shilt's  ""And the Band Played On"" (there is also a film of the same  title).  While these works reveal the deafening silence of the Regan  administration in responding to the growing epidemic, ""Zero  Patience"" marks more explicitly the racialization of the global  politics of HIV/AIDS.
Greyson plays together a range of genres, using  the pleasure of spectacle to tell a story of the politics of  misinformation. The story of the exclusions and silences around HIV?AIDS  still require telling: this is a world where the myth of external agents of  contagion can no longer be sustained.  (I have a question here:  what is  the correlation between hiv rates of transmission and catholocism in  colonial contexts? i am not trying to start trouble it is just a question).  Where can people who are allergic to latex get condoms?
 Zero Patience  has particular resonance when we locate hiv/aids within a contemporary  global politics which remains racialised; both within western nations, and  across the so-called ""developed"" and ""underdeveloped""  worlds.  At ""home"" in America the ""right"" can imagine a  threat ""out of Africa"" (or as ""Zero Patience"" plays  out, via the French Canadian ""patient zero"") but this isn't going  to keep the kids safe.  Talk about it.
""Zero Patience""  combines the pleasures of ""Can't Stop the  Music"" with the  politics of Haraway, and the humour of the fatboy slim ""Praise""  video.  Very cool.

614424,5,6303262368,"This movie, though shot on a budget, provides the viewer with an alternative take on the history of the AIDS epidemic in North America, with a frank and revisionist view of the insane determination of science and the  media to seek out and label a 'villain' upon whom to place the  responsibility for the intrusion of AIDS into 'Western civilization'. The  traditional scapegoating of Gaetan Dugas as 'PATIENT ZERO' is turned on its  head as the ghost of Dugas and a manic museum exhibition curator and  designer lock horns over how to structure an upcoming exhibit on the  'History of AIDS'.
Intertwined with their story is that of a Canadian  schoolteacher and member of the Canadian equivalent of ACT UP caught in a  dilemma of loyalty to the activist dogma of greedy pharmaceutical companies  and uncaring government officials and a deeper fear that the entire charade  of VILLAIN/HERO and VICTIM/VICTIMIZER may be standing in the way of any  rational and helpful response to his condition. His story accentuates the  Dugas Ghost/Curator story of gradual change and coming to terms with a  radically new point of view.
The songs are, for the most part, excellent  - with a touch of 30's musical and 50's flambouyance comingled with some  biting social commentary. A particular standout is the medley that takes  place in the museum as the exhibition animals transform into humans and  belt out a ballad of anger and disdain for the projection of human  frailities and failures on them.
This film will definitely make you  re-think the entire history and historiography of AIDS - as well as  challenge your perception of Gaetan Dugas. For as Gaetan himself said when  he was alive, ""If its sexually transmitted, then someone gave it to  me.""",950227200,6,1744,4.920962199312715
614425,5,6303262368,"A very ambitious film telling a touching story with stunning cinematography and songs that are clever, catchy, and sometimes corny.  The title sequence features a man dancing with a mirror ball, and a co-ed water  ballet.  Michael Callen appears to sing one of several reprises of the  wonderful ""Tell a Story (Scheherazade)"".  Not merely a divine  singer, Callen literally wrote the book on safer sex.
The film is in part  a response to Randy Shilts' AIDS journalism and his book ""And the Band  Played On"".  The protagonist is none other than Shilts' so-called  ""Patient Zero"", the French-Canadian flight attendant who turned  up at the center of the early ""contact study"" trying to trace the  contagion of what was not yet known as AIDS.  The story and the songs are  about a yearning for love, PWAs' struggle for empowerment, philosophy of  history, the need for us all to tell our own stories, the strengths and  failings of science, and the politics of AIDS.
This film is not for  children, nor for those offended by frank but not graphic depiction of love  and sex between men.  Some of it may seem a bit dated -- it's several years  since I've seen it, and the world has changed a bit.  The soundtrack still  has some rollicking good songs.",943228800,9,1247,4.702325581395349

7842346,5,6303262368,"I first owned this musical as a PAL VHS in the early 90s. I mistook the lead actor, John Robinson with the other theatrical actor, John Rubenstein. They both have curly hair and the same physique. Both actors have a sensuous quality that is hard to imagine in musical theater. The love story that develops between Sir Richard Burton and the musical's protagonist, Gatean Dugas is quite enrolling and ultimately convincing. I have always found the story of Gatean Dugas, the so-called ""man who brought AIDS to the states"", fascinating. However, in retrospect the sensualites of the saunas of the 70s would eventually turn into cesspools that harbored the deadly virus. Innocent victims, finally discovering some sense of sexual freedom, who soon be plagued with this deadly strain. My own personal beliefs are that some high level political figure decided to put the brakes on gay legislative powers by spiking the virus into a medium that would affect a large portion of the gay community. With the advent of the saunas and bathhouses in the 70s, they would have a near ideal vehicle to infect thousands of gay men at a relative quick pace.
It was a near brilliant nefarious luck that an international flight attendant who lead the campaign to make that happen. It was not unusual for gay men to frequent saunas and bathhouses around the world during their travels. It was the perfect alignment of evil to have a figure like Gatean Dugas to spearhead the spread of the virus during his travels around the world.
What is particularly striking is the inclusion of clever songs to compliment the dialogue. The songs are meaningful and most have good hooks that are memorable.
To get this DVD at this price is truly a bargain.
I am not sure it is the kind of musical I will want to watch over and over again because of the seriousness and sadness of the subject matter. But the performances are strong and the songs tell the story like nothing possibly could do with such entertaining spark.",1341187200,,1987,4.76231884057971
7842347,4,6303262368,"Easily one of the most deeply political AIDS movies made in the '90s. Don't expect great film making by Hollywood standards; you'll just be disappointed. But imagine (or remember) what it was like for people living with AIDS in the mid '90s (just as the toxic AZT was being transitioned into the very first hints of antiretrovirals). Believe it or not, this movie encapsulates the hope, anger, and craving to have fun again that pervaded this period. It was mind blowing that anyone would do a musical about AIDS (Rent hadn't even opened off-broadway yet) much less one as wacky, unconventional, and in your face as Zero Patience.",1311724800,3,630,4.842592592592593
7842348,5,6303262368,"Another dated classic. I love the raw innocence of this film. I find myself crying, laughing, being sexually aroused and singing this music days after viewing it.
Sometimes I think ""Broadway Musical"" or high-tech modern film - but because the AIDS epidemic is something different today it probably wouldn't work. I love the actors!
I love this film! I remember the person I saw it with, close friend, died in 2004 of AIDS. He had the viris almost 20 years.",1252281600,3,456,4.7125
7842349,4,6303262368,"Film Critic DELIVERED with stinging irony, that lyric is meant as a blanket indictment of empiricism, and of our abiding need to ""classify and label,"" to ""banish every doubt."" Why? Because a label is a tool that can double as a weapon - what identifies and separates can also isolate and stigmatize. How, then, to describe Zero Patience without falling into the empiricist's, and the critic's, taxonomical traps? A ""movie musical about AIDS"" is a popular answer - one that's odd enough to be enticing, vague enough to be innocuous. But it doesn't begin to sound the depths of a work that is intriguing, provoking, amusing, offending, demanding, inordinately intelligent, and defiantly resistant of the very thing I'm paid to do.

So let's approach the picture from another angle, from the perspective of writer/director John Greyson. Now Greyson, unlike some artists who happen to be gay, would probably agree that there is indeed a definable ""gay culture,"" an esthetic that goes heavy on irony and camp and outrageous humour and unapologetic theatricality. Clearly, all these ingredients are abundantly evident here. Just as clearly, Greyson (whose background lies in - get ready for a label - experimental video) has positioned his film at a 180-degree remove from a piece like Philadelphia. That movie, a drama about AIDS with a gay protagonist, was the product of mainstream Hollywood culture (unironic, non-outrageous, linear in plot and design), and took enormous pains not to offend a mainstream audience. This one is the product of a gay culture and doesn't give a damn who it offends. This one is smarter and more subtle, but lacks the emotional punch of the other (linear directness has its rewards), and the attendant complexities are hard to grasp at a single sitting.

Perhaps this will help a little: Greyson has reincarnated the Victorian explorer Richard Burton (John Robinson), using him to symbolize the dangers inherent in the empirical approach still taken by the scientific community toward all issues, including the AIDS plague. Burton, who toils in a Natural History Museum, is intent on mounting an exhibit called The Hall of Contagion, with AIDS as the sexy centrepiece. Just as his explorer colleagues once tracked the source of the Nile, he hopes to trace the ""cause"" of this disease. Causation, of course, is a first principle among empiricists. Rationally, if you find the cause, you may find the solution. Ethically, alas, it's a different matter; there, if you find the cause, you can point the finger - you can affix blame, you can isolate and stigmatize.

Enter another reincarnated soul, a gay ghost known as Patient Zero (Normand Fauteux) - the flight attendant who, in books like Randy Shilts' And The Band Played On, is ""blamed"" for first bringing AIDS to North America. Much of the film unfolds as an ongoing dialectic between the attitudes embodied in Burton and Zero, between serving a false cause and serving as a false villain. However, the dialectic takes the form of a literal song and dance - zippy production numbers where Glenn Schellenberg's toe-tapping melodies are laid over Greyson's thought- provoking lyrics. Consequently, the decorative fun on the surface (watch, if you dare, for an eye-popping ditty entitled The Butthole Duet) simultaneously competes with and complements the seriousness beneath - it's like tossing a colourful AIDS quilt over a dying AIDS patient. Greyson has refined and desentimentalized that most difficult of genres, the musical tragedy, and with every succeeding tune, he exponentially advances his thesis - other potentially false causes, like the ""African Green Monkey"" theory, like the HIV virus itself, come under his fire, as does everything from greedy drug companies to grousing AIDS activists. The film spares no one because, well, the disease spares no one.

Philadelphia is American in origin, Zero Patience is Canadian. Each is splendid in its own way, and each reflects the best of the culture (and the industry) that gave rise to it. The former is conventional, straightforward, and all about certainty, including the certainty of death. The latter is quirky, complicated, and all about uncertainty, especially the uncertainty of life. Greyson, and the film he's made, are brave enough to question incessantly, and smart enough to know that ""HIV- positive"" is a lot more than a medical label - it's a cruel oxymoron. He has zero patience for the blustering apostles of science and even art, and (the ironies abound) has more in common with another eminent Victorian than he might care to admit. Mister Greyson, meet Mister Tennyson: ""There lives more faith in honest doubt,/ Believe me, than in half the creeds."" Conrad Alton, Filmbay Editor.",1216684800,,4735,5.129533678756476
