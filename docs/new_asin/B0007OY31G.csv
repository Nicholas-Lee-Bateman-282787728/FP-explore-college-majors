2224567,5,B0007OY31G,"Appleseed recieved a ton of hype prior to its DVD release, and for good reason. Using a new technique called 3D live action CG, the original story has been given an amazing upgrade. The story involves Deunan Knute, a beautiful but deadly soldier, who after World War III is taken to the city of Olympus (which is supposed to be a Utopia). In this city, humans coexist with the Bioroids, an advanced human clone form whose purpose is to make human existence more peaceful. When the balance of this relationship is threatened, Deunan and Briareos are the only hope to save the city of Olympus (from what I won't say). I can say that this movie is action-packed throughout, and there was never a slow moment to me. Another reviewer said that this was not a deep philosophical anime like Akira or Ghost in the Shell, and that is true. But who needs that when you have something that is so visually impressive? One complaint is that the story is too rushed. I thought it was excellent, and it has been said that a sequel is in the works. But anyway, the bottom line is that this is the most impressive CG feature I have ever seen. The characters are very easy to relate to, the action will surely please any fan that wants action in an anime, and the soundtrack in the movie is awesome.

So I bought the two-disc version in the LE tin. If you have more money the Briareos figure is a very cool thing to have. As far as the tin goes, it is high quality featuring great artwork from the movie. It is not metal like some others I have bought, and it is hard to explain. Very nice though and a must for anime fans and collectors.

There are some great extras in this loaded set compared to other anime movie releases (most come with little or no insight into the making of the film). On disk 1 is the feature film in English or Japanese. There are also previews for other Geneon releases (Samurai Champloo, Paranoia Agent, Fafner and a couple of others). Disk 2 has some pretty great extras as well. There is a behind the scenes featurette with several of the people behind the movie to start out, and it gives their opinions on Appleseed and the pros of this new animated style. It is interesting if you like that sort of thing on DVDs. There is also a concept art gallery as well as image gallery with most of the characters from the movie. Next there are 2 Japanese trailers from the thearical release of Appleseed as well as 1 U.S. trailer. ""Appleseed Info"" fills you in on some of the names throughout the movie and what they are, such as ""Gaia"", as well as character bios. Add to this a commentary track from both the director and producer, and it makes for one excellent anime DVD.

Overall this is now my favorite anime feature film (and I have seen several). The story was great and easy to understand. The action sequences with Deunan and Briareos are awesome. The songs from the movie are perfectly suited to the scene which adds to its greatness. I believe a lot of people may share my opinion upon first viewing this, but it may not appeal to everybody. Best anime movie ever? That is for you to decide. At least give it a shot, and if you become a fan then this 2 disc version is the one to own.",1115856000,18,3200,4.3478260869565215
2224568,5,B0007OY31G,"I just had the privilege of watching an advance promo copy of this new version of Appleseed, and I am deeply impressed.

Simply put, it is beautiful. Hands down, the animation in Appleseed is some of the best I've ever seen; a stunning combination of computer rendering and cell animation, with mind-blowing results. It puts pretty much every other animated movie I've seen recently -- from ""Final Fantasy"" to ""The Incredibles"" -- to absolute shame. Those movies wish they looked this good.

The soundtrack, featuring Paul Oakenfold and Ryuichi Sakamoto among others, is also excellent. The music provides counterpoint to key scenes, but is never over the top.

The story is a solid one, peopled by believable characters and a steadily-moving plotline.  Action sequences are paced nicely, and the dialogue is simple but works.  My one complaint (a minor one) is that I wish that they had gotten better voice actors for some of the parts. The actress for Deunan was fine, but better actors for Briareos and Hitomi I think would have carried it a little better.  Nevertheless, this was but a minor distraction in an otherwise outstanding film.

If you're a fan of Japanese animation, or animated films in general, then you must see this movie. This could well be the first in the next generation of animated movies -- which would be quite fitting.",1114646400,12,1345,4.898678414096916
2224569,5,B0007OY31G,"The CG animation for Appleseed must be seen to be believed....the story is not confusing or downright depressing like Akira or Ghost in the Shell 2, andit's a great sci-fi action thriller/adventure.

I actually read the marketing tagline for this DVD quoting director John Woo ""A stunning achievement - it's a new milestone for CG animation""...and I wholeheartedly agree.

According to news, John Woo is producing the sequel to this film and Masamune Shirow, the original creator of Ghost in the Shell and Appleseed, is so taken with this film that he's designing characters for the sequel and new TV series....AND get this you loyal Shirow fans - he might do a new manga for it!!!  Shirow has stopped working for more than 10 years!

I think this film really has that kind of impact on people...some anime fans might complain that this is not a traditional cel anime, but I believe that this is a major step forward for the anime industry as a whole.  The world has gone CG, and I think this might be the answer for anime. CG animation is shaded to look like a cool 2D anime - but it no longer is limited animation.  I love Ghost in the Shell 2 and other important works of anime, but I belive there is room for a new form of expression and I think this is it.  Fans will have richer experience all the more.  As for me...I can't wait for the sequel to come out.",1114387200,,1363,4.424
2224570,4,B0007OY31G,"Finally we are moving away from the video game genre and back to what anime is... ANIME.  Not using the same software to create movies and oh yea a great video game to go with it.  I really got tired of the CG animation craze that is hitting anime.  I truly miss those 2D cartoons and cell animations of the past.

This is a great example of CG used to mimick cell animation.  I was walking into a Japantown store when I noticed that they were showing this movie.  Well for those wondering, they have everything there since the DVDs are direct imports from Japan in region 2.  But anyway, I decided to watch it a bit.  I loved how they dipict the robots to be larger than even Godzilla.  Boy I was convinced with the director's magic.

Also although you can tell by the movements of the characters, that this is somewhat like a dressed down Final Fantasy Spirits Within.  Instead of adding more texture and trying to re-invent live action movies, they have decided to mimick cell animation.  The art in this movie is revolutionary.  Outside Star Wars Clone Wars, and maybe Titan AE, I haven't seen CG used quite this well.",1113091200,2,1122,4.4411764705882355
2224571,3,B0007OY31G,"This review is not based on the DVD. I saw this movie in an advance screening in NYC. The animation is top notch. It's the best eye candy I have seen since Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust, Last Exile and Blood the last vampire to name a few. The animation in this film has set the new standard for any future anime to follow hands down. However, the story was a bit weak and at times a bit cheezy. It was intresting enough but not truly captivating. It's main point was the CGI. Truly art in motion. I give it three stars for it's story which could have used some brushing up but 10 stars for for the CGI!! Totaly sweet!!!

A side note, I would like too see the Art team for Appleseed 2004 and the creative team for Last Exile to team up. I think they would create an anime for all time.",1109808000,3,782,4.077922077922078
2224572,5,B0007OY31G,"Just bought this DVD at Megacon, and was blown away within 2 seconds of this beautifully made film.

Appleseed is a 3-D, fully animated CGI film that is awesome in all aspects, from design and storyline, to awesome battle sequences, this one is top-of-the-line. If only they made them all this all around good!

A classic in many areas.",1109462400,11,336,4.677966101694915
2224573,5,B0007OY31G,"I recently acquired an import of this movie and all I can say is WOW!  The animation is unreal, superior even to the beauty of Ghost in the Shell: Innocence.  The storyline centers around unrest of bioroid involvement in Olympus, a modern Eden created following World War III.  Having done some research I discovered that the animation was actually done in part with motion capture filming as well, and it shows.  Despite some bad reviews online, this is a must see for any anime fan or even fans of the truly beautiful.",1108598400,10,520,4.619565217391305

2224577,4,B0007OY31G,"Reproduction is the key to survival in a futuristic dystopian struggle among humans, clones, and super-charged killing machines.

I don't see many anime and I don't read any manga.  I get the impression that Im a little more forgiving toward this production than fans are, since I know nothing of the source material from which this film apparently diverges pretty significantly.  I was enthralled by the animation and I found the story interesting, albeit rather exposition-heavy.  I wasn't put off by the melodrama as much as some reviewers were because I expected that going in.  Its my impression that anime in general is pretty melodramatic., but maybe someone out there can tell me if Im mistaken.",1469491200,,703,5.025862068965517

2224580,3,B0007OY31G,"Perhaps it is too early for me to write this review, but the CGI is killing me. I can appreciate CGI in anime movies and series, but Appleseed is like watching a video game. The CGI is overwhelming for my taste.
I will give Appleseed a chance. It is a good movie. It's a target for anyone who enjoys ""Ghost in the Shell"". In fact, I think this series is trying too hard to be a carbon copy of Ghost in the Shell.

As an anime fan, this movie is worth the watch. Reguardless, the CGI could make anyone who loves hand drawn animation cringe. If you can enjoy watching your friends playing video games, Appleseed will be no problem to watch.

I don't want to suggest to anyone NOT purchase the movie. Buy it, it's good. Just a warning.....the 100% CGI is the thing that turns me off. Any person who admires "" old school"" animation will understand my frustration of the overworked CGI.",1465257600,,881,4.333333333333333

CGI and Shade Shell animation mixed very well and the syfy storyline about the future of human kind and bioroids (sorta like clones constructed by genetic structuring science) living in a Utopian society until a stray military faction wants to destroy the bioroids  because they can't trust them. Lots of action Robot killer, Mecha suits, and a real twist near the end that could spell the future of humans and bioroids.
I saw it when it came out in selected theatres, bought it on DVD in collectable tinbox, then bought it in Blu-ray to include it to my collectable DVD tinbox set.

The survivors of the Global War share their not so idyllic existence with half-human half-clone genetically-engineered pseudo-beings called Bioroids.  Some humans have a problem with them, some don't.  Olympus is governed with an iron fist by Prime Minister Athena Areios, General Edward Uranus III of the Olympus Army, and a Council of freakish looking Elders who float around on bubble thingies.  Naturally, there is an artificial intelligence guiding everything that goes on in Olympus (or does it), it's called Gaia.  There's also an E-S.W.A.T. organization, a plot to destroy Gaia, the search for something called Appleseed, and a sad tale of woe involving two star-crossed lovers Deunan Knute and this guy who's a cyborg sporting a bunny suit.  Yadda-yadda-yadda, things happen, things explode, everyone acts suspicious, humanity is at stake, the Bioroids are threatened, the army becomes the all-purpose villains, and there's a long drawn out battle to cap things off.

Many people dislike or dismiss Japanese anime as ""cheap"", ""childish"" or ""commercial"". This movie may definitively change their mind.

Appleseed is not only about action. It is also addressing complex and deep emotional and society issues. The heroin loves a man whose body has been destroyed and replaced by cold cybernetics. She defends a world that is stabilized by human-like machines, humans having proven to be impossible to be trusted to be left alone.

2224691,5,B0007OY31G,"Hands down this was one of the most beautiful cell-shaded films ever made (and for the most part it looks even better on Blu-Ray, with the exception of the introductory scene which can come off looking a bit blurry), but it's probably best not to look at Appleseed as the pinnacle of the now-unutilized animation technology it once represented, but instead a step on the road to the still-spectacular Japanese CG features such as Vexille and Appleseed Ex Machina.

The plot is concerned with the earth sometime after a global war essentially turned much of the planet into a wasteland. Even though the war is officially over, with the lines of communication cut, the soldiers continue to fight over absolutely nothing. Humanity has retreated to an island called Olympus to re-build civilization, and a stabilizing element of artifical humans lacking emotion known as Bioroids are inserted to dilute the chance of conflicts. Even in this utopia, however, there are still problems, and therefore the most elite soldiers from the wastelands are extracted to become a part of E.S.W.A.T, an elite counter-terrorism group under the command of the Prime Minister, a bioroid herself. Within the military there is still distrust of the bioroid's control over many aspects of government. Can humanity come to terms with their creations, or will Olympus be destroyed in a torrent of racial hatred?

While it is filled with symbolism, the characters seem a bit undistinguished. The action ranges from mediocre to very good. The plot is quite chilling, and very intriguing. However, some of the emotional moments come out as feeling a bit (ahem) robotic. Also, a bit too much time is spent explaining how everything in the film works, with a lot of made-up names and pointless technobabble. It's a good film, but a few flaws keep it from reaching greatness. The film can be a bit confusing the first time you watch it, especially if this is your first Japanese animated feature.

The disc comes with three language tracks, the original Japanese language track, the Geneon english dub that can be found on the DVDs, and a brand-new dub using the same voice actors as the sequel, Appleseed Ex Machina. All of the actors are at the very least decent in their respective roles, and though many anime purists would immediately point you to the Japanese track as the best one, I myself prefer the Geneon dub. It also includes commentary, which isn't all that interesting for fans of the manga series, but it might be interesting for those curious about how they animated the picture.

I'd give the film about a 7 out of ten, but the disc quality is fantastic, and definately worth a watch if you like the ideas behind it.",1327881600,,2702,4.8673913043478265

Not only does she reunites with her former lover Briareos, who's now more machine than man, but she arrives just as a human coup-d'etat against Olympus' government begins.  But that's just a backdrop to a bigger conspiracy that could mean the extinction of our species.

I admit that I wasn't too impressed with Appleseed at first, even with its visual overload.  But I've really come to appreciate the movie's merits this time around.

'Vexille' is the best Movie (of the only three made)that group ever did in regards to a complete story but 'Appleseed' was a great Manga and the telling of it here was a decent bit of entertainment.

Only rent the sequel to see the Massive flipping FUBAR that it turned into when the creators got it into their heads that Anime character designs where too wrong and ""realer"" designs would bring in more audiences. Look no further then the PS2 'Xenosaga prt 2' where they did just that to incredible profit vacuums in Japan and America for it. Killing the expected SEVEN PART ""SAGA"" and wimpering out with a sympathy bye-bye third and LAST game. Also; deciding that the original stories that followed the Manga was too ""immature"" so they made a completely divorced carbon copy of the characters in it.

Good flick.  The human elements, even the personalities of the bioroids, are the centerpiece of a story in a sci-fi setting.  The story itself is complex enough to stay compelling throughout the movie.  The animation is of good quality, but I'm only lukewarm on the style.

And humans share half the population of the city with Bioroids (almost too human Androids). While most want to live peacefully in this serenity, there are others who fear the robots. And where there is fear, there is usually a crap load of fighting. Deunan is a female warrior who is brought into Olympus to help save the city from the people who want to destroy it and kill every Bioroid in it. But within Deunan lies a secret that not even she remembers. With the help of her lost boyfriend Briareos (who is now mostly machine), she begins her search for the whereabouts of the Appleseed. The one thing that will help save not only the Bioroids, but also humanity itself.

After many attempts of trying to watch this movie all the way through, I finally got the time and the energy to get through it all in one sitting. The reason I say this is, even though it's a decent story, it can be pretty long winded sometimes. Way to explanatory. I fell asleep once during the scene where Hitomi is driving Deunan to the elders and she begins to just talk and talk. And then I once fell asleep during what I believe is pivotal moment where the elders are telling Deunan some things. Mainly because of just too much talking and explaining.

The animation itself is done really well movement wise. I for one am not a fan of cell shading though. So the `coloring' of the drawings themselves just look, well, kind of stupid to me. Not all the time though. Sometimes I see something and am really wowed by how it looks. Then a minute later something looks totally bland, because of the cell shading. The mix with cg and drawings and cell shading, even though done pretty well, just wasn't for me. I'll take the drawings of Akira or the cg animation of FF7: Advent Children over this type of art any day.

The story was good but sometimes to clichd. The twists were nothing we hadn't seen before. And even though it was sometimes to drawn out, it was still a lot of fun to watch, once the good parts were going at least.

In the end, I seem to be about 50/50 on this movie after I keep reading my own lines. So with that being said, I would say give it a rent one day if you are into sci-fi or end of the world type of movies. Unless of course you're a big anime fan, then I'm sure you will love this.

2224717,4,B0007OY31G,"Appleseed / B0007OY31G

*Spoilers*

I would really like to give Appleseed a five star review, I really would. The animation is superb, the story is intriguing, and the voice work is flawless. Unfortunately, the movie needs just that little bit of polish on the edges to be truly perfect, or at least truly perfect for beginners who come to this story brand-new, as I did.

I'm unsure how much of the story in this movie will be familiar to existing fans of this anime franchise. The story revolves around a new utopia in the midst of a ruined world, populated in part by genetically modified humans who are incapable of strong human emotion, most notably the hatred, prejudice, and anger that led humanity to destroy the world in the first place. Set in the midst of this is the apparently missing-in-action-for-some-time famed female warrior Deunan Knute.

Deunan Knute is many things. She's one of the best warriors on earth, descended from an equally brilliant warrior and (it will be revealed) a rather important scientist. She's the love interest for the now-mechanized Briarius who was presumed dead and is now more machine than human, and a protector of the new utopia. She is a fantastic protagonist, and a wonderfully strong and sensitive woman, managing to eschew the stereotypes that abound in some other types of anime.

This is where we run into our rough edges that mar the movie. To wit, Deunan is never really allowed to reach her potential. A humorous scene where her ""training"" ends in the complete and surprising defeat of her numerous laser-tag opponents and a cute quip from her in the end is marred by Briarius' scolding that she shouldn't tease men who may save her life someday. This could work if the scene was meant to show that Briarius is conflicted about Deunan's arrival into his untroubled utopia, but the scene is played straight and Deunan silently vows to be more serious, to my own disappointment. Another drawback here is that the filmmakers do not seem to trust their underlying premise that Deunan is capable and tough - Briarius repeatedly saves her life throughout the film, often over her ridiculously protesting objections, and I cannot think of a single instance where she handles actual trouble without the protection of her imposing metal lover. This is a disappointment, for a character that is supposed to be strong, self-reliant, practical, and battle-hardened.

The film also suffers from exposition issues. There are long stretches of exposition that, should have been arranged differently in order to allow the user to process the convoluted storyline. Exposition is hampered by skipping major plot points and returning to them in retrospect later, if at all - the wire fighting warriors that slice Hitomi's car in half are never explained with regards to who sent them. There are also simply too many coincidences and ""gee, that's convenient"" plot points, for instance when the multiple automated fighters are converging on the dome and we find that (a) they don't need to stop ALL the fighters, because there's a shut-down port on ONE of them that will shut them all down (convenient!) and (b) they are given the shut-down passcode by a previously comatose Hitomi who announces that her name is the passcode the elders chose to use. It's not really understand WHY she would know this - I can buy that the elders might use her name as the super-secret passcode because they are fond of her, but then they also TELL her the super-secret passcode? Very odd, and again a little too convenient.

Having given all this criticism, I still highly recommend Appleseed as a solid four star movie. The story may be unpolished, but it is still far superior to most movies, anime or live-action alike. The character development and relationship exploration between Deunan and Briarius could have used a great deal of work, but I recognize that this went into the sequel and was handled very well, all things considered. And the movie also contains the most touching ""I remember now!"" amnesia scene that I have ever witnessed, with a climax that brought tears to my eyes.

One more major gripe: This movie provides closed caption for the hearing impaired. But, and this is a big but, the captions *never* match the actual words being said by the voice actors. Literally, it was not at all uncommon for a caption and the voice text to share only the words ""a"", ""an"", and ""the"". I have to assume that the caption writers and the voice actors were working with different translations which yielded the same intent, but with vastly different words. If you are hard of hearing and you use the captions to follow along and pick up the words that you missed, the discontinuity between what you HEAR and what you SEE is incredibly jarring and annoying. If you are completely deaf, well, you won't be watching the same movie as your companions. There is really no excuse for such shoddy work, but I did not include this in my star rating as it will not apply to all viewers.

2224718,5,B0007OY31G,"I saw this in the theater and was very pleased after having seen the original animation on a rented VHS years ago when I was younger.  The original animation was confusing for me in terms of plot, but I do remember it being cool visually. This movie really blew me away in the theater, as it was the first time I had seen an anime truly realized in 3D graphics/animation.  Also, the characters and the plot where much more refined in this movie than the original animation, and it was much more interesting and captivating for me.  The ending is pretty epic as well, with a huge scale scene of destruction taking place.

I felt the creators of this movie had done something really revolutionary for the anime industry by making this decision to make the movie in 3D.  Own a piece of anime history with this movie, because its one of the first ever full 3D anime to be made.

The metal case is sweet, but the action figure that came with this special edition is the only thing that bugged me about this product because it is not made very well.

2224733,5,B0007OY31G,"I recently discovered the Appleseed movies a month ago. I had seen the film VEXILLE which was made by the same person who did the 2nd and 3rd Appleseed films. After I was blown away by the mix of hand drawn animation and CGI, I knew I had to check out his other film work. I was even more blown away by APPLESEED and APPLESEED EX MACHINA.

It is 2131, there is one city left remaining on Earth called Olympus. Humans and bioroids (artificial clones) appears to co-exist peacefully. All is not well underneath the idyllic surface. The existence of bioroids have angered some humans thus leading to the destruction of a government building that contained third generation bioroids. The destruction of the building also means doom for bioroids who needs a life extension like Deunan's friend Hitomi.

Deunan Knute, a tough as nails female soldier and her ex-boyfriend Briareos, who is 75% machine and the other members of the ESWAT team needs to retrieve the lost Appleseed technology to help Hitomi and the rest of Olympus, and put a kibosh on the growing threat of the military.

I personally loved this film. The action was non-stop. The animation was awesome. I love the combination of hand drawn animation and CGI. The techno soundtrack fits perfectly into the setting of the film. I personally enjoyed the storyline.",1216425600,2,1319,4.8017621145374445

The case is the finest I have ever seen.

The content on the bonus disk is fantastic too...

This entire work says, very simply: ""Someone Cared Enough to pay attention to everything and get it right.""

The few criticisms that one might have over it not being exactly like the original Appleseed VHS back in the day, can be addressed by saying simply that it is 2008 not 1988.

The fact that the story, character design, and over all impact of the original work was retained is good enough for me.

The new take on this material is fresh from every perspective, without destroying what was truly the core of the original Anime.

I have watched this 3 times since purchasing it and it is beautiful and exciting.

2224738,5,B0007OY31G,"Though it has nothing to do with apples, Appleseed is a shiny, crisply animated film that tastefully combines traditional cell-shaded animation with juicy 3-dimensional computer graphics. As the story begins, we find the legendary camouflage-clad warrior babe, Deunan Knute, armed only with a handgun and fighting for her life against a gang of crimson-eyed fiends and an unstoppable Gatling Tank amid the dusty, blue-tinged rubble of some post-apocalyptic wasteland.  After a few very impressive slow-motion backflips and karate kicks choreographed to the rhythmic beats of Paul Oakenfold's `Burns Attack,' our fern-haired heroine is surrounded and ultimately captured by members of ES.W.A.T. and whisked away in the Tilt Rotor--an aircraft that's a cross between a plane and a helicopter.  When the tranquilizer rounds finally wear off, Deunan opens her big green eyes to find herself in a sparkling utopia called Olympus.  Here she meets the lovely ES.W.A.T. recruiter, Hitomi, and a hulking steel-headed cyborg dude with five red eyes where his face should be and a pair of metal rabbit ears atop his chrome-plated cranium.  Deunan soon discovers, much to her initial horror, that this faceless giant is not merely the Easter Bunny's worst nightmare; he is none other than her old boyfriend, Briareos Hecatonchires!  It seems that a year or so ago, the once-handsome Briareos required some cybernetic replacement parts after his body was badly damaged in a battle on the North African front...but inside he's still the same good-hearted guy he's always been (plus, he undoubtedly gets excellent TV reception).

The next morning, Hitomi takes Deunan for a spin around the futuristic city in her glistening raspberry-pink hover-car.  As they observe Olympus's crystal-clear skies, picturesque parks, mirrored streets and deliriously happy residents, the raven-haired tour guide endeavors to explain the complicated facts of life in this supposed utopia.

The two gigantic, highly-reflective, dome-shaped structures that dominate the cityscape are called Tartaros and Daidalos.  Inside these unusual buildings is the enormous I.N. (Intelligent Network) brain, commonly known as Gaia.  Gaia is a self-expanding network that monitors interactions between humankind and the Bioroids that make up half of the city's population.  Bioroids are an advanced species of clones, manufactured with the highest quality components.  Unlike ordinary human beings, whose unstable emotions often lead to war, Bioroids do not feel anger, jealousy or hatred.  Whether or not they can feel love is open to debate.  Hitomi says they can't, but Yoshi the blue-haired Landmate mechanic later says they can.  One thing's certain though, Bioroids cannot have children, as their reproductive systems are inactive.  Therefore, they must undergo a periodic life extension process or they will age rapidly and die.

The governing body of Olympus, called the Administration, is exclusively Bioroid.  It is overseen by the slightly wrinkled Prime Minister Athena, redheaded commander-in-chief of the ES.W.A.T. force.  Athena and the Bioroids are the facilitators of balance and peace in Olympian society.  Peaceful coexistence between Man and Bioroid is believed to be the last remaining hope for the survival of the human species.  However, this peace is threatened by the Bioroid-hating extremist, General Uranus (he must've been teased relentlessly as a child), commander of the so-called Regular Army--an army comprised entirely of human beings.

The ultimate authority in this shimmering dream world of alleged perfection is, of course, the Legislature, which is run by the Seven Elders (a group of crusty old gentlemen who apparently never leave their floating chairs), along with the aforementioned Gaia.  The rule of Olympus is decided by debate between these seven seniors and the big blue bubble-like computer, Gaia--a stable, unwavering, emotionless machine with no capacity for sentiment.  The Elders' aged human minds give Gaia's thinking a much-needed measure of flexibility (and probably an appreciation for Big Band music as well).

Looming over all of Olympus, at the top of Tartaros, is the ominous D-Tank.  It is widely believed that this tank holds a dreadful virus that, if ever released, would wipe out all Bioroid existence.  Thankfully, the manufactured Olympian citizens can rest easy knowing that the D-Tank is guarded by the ultimate system in high-tech security.  ...Does all of this sound like a recipe for disaster to you?

Complex plot aside, Appleseed is a spectacularly beautiful CG extravaganza with enough eye candy to give your corneas cavities.  The movie contains a number of thrilling action sequences featuring lightning-fast suits of gleaming robotic armor; silvery whip-swinging androids; lumbering spider-like Mobile Fortresses; blazing machineguns; and earth-rattling explosions.  And the visual mayhem is all set to pounding electronic anthems by groups like Boom Boom Satellites and Basement Jaxx.

The Collector's Edition comes in a nifty metal case and includes a bonus disc, loaded with extras like design archives; image galleries; character and mecha info; and a fascinating English-subtitled featurette on the `Birth of 3D Live Anime.'  Appleseed contains a few violent death scenes, but there's no sex and very little in the way of bad language (unlike the old&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2-D-version/dp/B00005AX6N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2-D version</a>).

~ Story :

Well , First of all i personally found that the plot was unnecessarily complex . Keeping track of all the events and information presented through the different events taking part in the anime is something rather difficult . I am sure others may disagree but most fans of the show agree on this . However to try and give you the best idea about the story without ruining the movie for you I summed it up in the following :

After a series of events Deunan wakes up in a Utopian city called ""Olympus"" , Its population is half human and half clone, a genetically-engineered species called Bioroids made from the best technical components. Olympus is governed by three factions: Prime Minister Athena, who Deunan seems to know; General Edward Uranus III, head of the Olympus Regular Army; and the Council of Elders -- seven old men hooked up to life support and anti-gravity chairs. Yet everything in the city is observed by an artificial intelligence named Gaia, which resides in a building called Tartarus. Here, Deunan integrates into the prestigious ESWAT organization to serve as the city's guardian and becomes friends with a Biorod named Hitomi. Bioroids are created from the DNA Deunan's father, Carl, making the Bioroids her brothers and sisters, genetically speaking. Unfortunately, they have a lifespan much shorter than those of humans due to the suppression of their reproductive capabilities. When the facilities that were used in the Bioroid's life extension processes are destroyed by a secret faction of Olympus army , Appleseed is revealed as a data created by Deunan's scientist mom Professor Gia . However some believe that Bioroids are a threat to the future advancement of mankind, whilst others believe that humans themselves are the threat. The ultimate question is over everyone's right to life, and whether or not one group deserves life more than the other. At the center of this battle is Appleseed, the data that is able to extend Bioroid life.

--------------
~ Art and Animation:

This is CGI at it's best , Looking at the fact that this movie was created back then in 2004 . The character movement may seem awkward and unnatural at times but nothing that would ruin the overall quality of this movie . The action sequences are Mind blowing , The Robot design are more than out-standing and as a person who enjoys Mecha/Robots and Sci-fi i found Appleseed's execution to be more than full-filling . However i struggled to get through this movie at first , Heck I've had the DVD for over a year but only got to finish it today . I've tried to watch it many times in the past but found my-self getting bored fast .. BUT when you get to a certain part in the movie and past the first 30 minutes it all starts making sense and you truly get to experience the beauty of the work behind this movie.

--------------
~ Music & Soundtrack :

Well , the soundtrack was one of the reasons that got me to watch this movie 'till the end. It's Awesome .. The soundtrack and music to the series features an electronic, techno and trance theme, And it's all in english. No J-pop / J-rock or metal .. It's techno  Trance ,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Appleseed/dp/B0006U3U3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Appleseed</a>&nbsp;is truly worth purchasing if you enjoyed the show .

But it's rather an action fast-paced sci-fi movie that well surely entertain you . I only gave this movie 4 stars because i wanted to see more emotions and a better conclusion but as i haven't seen the squeal yet . I'd settle down with 4 stars.

2224781,3,B0007OY31G,"Appleseed is an enjoyable, if ultimately cliche and hollow, anime film.

The story centers around Deunan Knute, a soldier who is whisked away by a Bioroid (genetically engineered humanoid) named Hitomi to the utopian city of Olympus as part of a rather stereotypical anime political controversy.  Awaiting her in the city is Briareos, her former comrade and lover who, after nearly getting killed himself, is a cyborg, much more machine than man.

While I won't spoil any of the major plot points in this review, I will state that this film had the potential to be more than just an action flick.  There were many questions raised in the film (the ethics of genetic engineering, where the line between humanity and machine blurs, the humanitarian price of keeping such a utopia whole, etc), but, unfortunately, none were answered.  Instead of fleshing out the philosophical quandries that were an essential aspect of the film's background, the plot focused on action.  While the action scenes were enjoyable to watch (more on this in a moment), most didn't really feel integral to the film's story.

The film is entirely rendered in CG.  While I enjoyed the look and feel of the film, it is largely a matter of taste, so your mileage may vary.  Let me say, though, that, to this date, I haven't seen an anime film that has felt so alive.  Between the realism of the background sets (especially the water effects), and the motion captured actors, the film, by and large, feels almost lifelike.  The mechs do look a bit squat, but that gives them a certain weight.  Perhaps the most glaring flaw is that of the characters' faces, but even that's a slight quibble compared to what the film does right visually.

The action scenes themselves were pretty cliche.  There were Matrix-esque slow motion bits, and even a ""do something at a control panel before time runs out"" bit.  The opening scene felt like an homage to the ending of Ghost in the Shell, especially when the tanks showed up.  Given this film's background, that sort of tipping of the cap was a welcome addition.

Emotionally, the film is a bit flat.  There's a bit of psychobabble (repressed memories and the like) which serves as the catalyst for our heroine's emotional revival, and there's a 'death' scene that serves no apparent purpose.  The rest is all paint-by-numbers.  By the end of the film, my feelings towards the characters were neutral at best.

The majority of the music was done by the Boom Boom Satellites.  Think Matrix/Blade techno and you'll be on the right track.

In the end, Appleseed is the equivalent of a good popcorn flick.  There's the potential for something much greater lying just underneath the surface, but none of that potential is ever reached.  Instead, we're left with a stylish, flashy, action-packed film.  There's nothing wrong with that, but I can't help but feel that the story of Appleseed would be better served in a series where the characters and plot could be fleshed out over several episodes.  110 minutes (give or take) just isn't enough time to deliver on the film's premise.",1176768000,4,3086,4.817490494296578
2224782,5,B0007OY31G,"Appleseed does have some flaws and I think that one of those is that the film could have been a little longer - the film makers could have explored the characters a little more. However, Appleseed is beautiful to behold and the animation is state-of-the-art. The story is good, although not great, and it is a clear tribute to the Beauty & the Beast classic.

The outdoor scenes are nothing short of breathtaking and some are almost indistinguishable from reality. Yet the film makers have continued to use a more tradition Anim style with the human and bioroid protagonists. The women look faintly doll-like. This is just a manifestation of the Anim style and I didn't mind it at all.

I've watched Appleseed a few times now and I return to it from time to time. I find it entertaining and thought provoking. I hope the film makers revisit this world some time.",1168646400,2,862,4.627450980392157

The film is set in the future, after a significant global war. Deunan Knute was one of the best soldiers in this war, and she has been fighting for quite some time. Little does she know the war ended, and the soldiers and robots she's been fighting have come from the city of Olympus, who wish to capture and recruit Deunan as part of their defense force. They eventually do, and Deunan is taken to a city very different from the rust and ruin the rest of the world has falled into. Olympus is green with parkland and trees, shining with metaliic skyscrapers, a bustling utopia of flying cars and happy families. Such a place exists thanks to the creation of a race of people known as Bioroids, a type of human clone that have had their life span reduced, their emotions supressed and their reproductive systems neutralized. Though they are kind and generous beings, they apparently feel no true love, thanks to the genetic repressions. They also feel no hate, so they never start wars or fight one another. They live together with humans, and in theory are supposed to keep each other in check.  Still, not everyone in Olympus is happy with the system. General Uranus, and his accomplice Hades despise the Bioroids, and want them wiped out. Acts of terror soon befall the city, and Deunan is caught up in a web of intrigue, memories, politics and science, all leading to the hunt for something the powers-that-be refer to as ""Appleseed"". But what is Appleseed? Will it put things right? Were things ever right to begin with?

I've seen this CGI style of anime around the place, and I'm not exactly the biggest fan of it. It's a little too crisp, a little too clear and calculated, and it cheapens things just a little. Still, ""Appelseed"" is probably my favorite film in this medium so far. There's a lot to think about, and a lot of references to Greek mythology in and around the city of Olympus (the powerful figures are named after Greek gods, etc). Even though it doesn't hint too strongly at it I kind of got the feeling that in the world of Appleseed, time and events are circular, the creation of a new race of beings, squabbles among the creative race, etc. In the film, Deunan has a hope, that their children will be able to sort things out, that they can forge a new destiny, but I can't help doubting that a fair bit, considering how their natures are structured.

However, I was disappointed with the storyline's departures from the original foundation, the graphic novels. The original story was so rich and very well thought out that I was let down by the changes in this encapsulated version. Letting go of this emotional baggage, I understand that you cannot realistically condense so much material, 12 issues if I recall correctly, into an hour and forty-five minutes; it does stand well as its own work.",1162598400,2,654,5.0

The story is actually pretty straightforward with minimal twists. Actually, I have to admit that this was kind of nice. I could just sit back and enjoy the action without worrying about missing some important detail. The animation is nice too, especially the action sequences. I found the combination of near photo-real backgrounds with cel-shaded characters a bit odd, but it is still a visually stunning show. I find that watching all the various Appleseed movies and reading the comics is the best way to get a feel for this complex universe.

The story is about Deonan, a young female urban warrior who is taken to a city called Utopia.  Half the population of Utopia is human, half is a race called Bioroids.  Bioroids are there to keep the human population in emotional balance and to prevent fights, crime, and war.  Deonan becomes friends with a kind and gentle Bioroid named Hitomi.

Deonan meets her former comrade at arms/lover who is now a machine, but his mind, memories, and feelings are intact.  Soon it becomes clear that there is something sinister about Utopia.  Can Deonan make the right decision by trusting the last words of her dying mother?  Or is she making a terrible mistake and thereby condemning humanity to extinction?

Being one of the first full-length films to feature 100 percent computer animation (cel-shaded, though) Appleseed is certainly an eye candy.  Everything is nicely detailed from the characters to the background and even the small technological knick-knacks.

Unfortunately, the awe ends early as Appleseed lacks in what the other Shirow masterpiece, Ghost in the Shell, delivers in strides: depth.  Appleseed lacks the a thought-provoking story line for those who're into a philosophical phase.  Likewise, if you're into action, the choreography and camera angles aren't no where great.

This limited ""tin"" edition contains a 2nd disc with bonus material.  However, given the lackluster story line (and English track dubbing), I'd recommend that you get the single disc version instead.",1147219200,2,891,5.654135338345864
2224796,3,B0007OY31G,"Appleseed simultaneously suffers from the worst Anime has to offer and benefits from the best animation and production a modern production can have. If you are a hardcore Manga fan (or just occasionally fond of it like me) you'll be aware of the most typical clich?s, most of which make up the bulk of the Appleseed story.

So...we have a world set after WWIII, in which a Utopian Society has finally found peace. But there are still some people who cannot help but let their anger and bigotry take hold. Android/Clones with suppressed emotions help balance out Utopia and some even want to be fully-fledged humans. There are humans who hate these Androids and wish them to all die out. And there are some Android who hate humans and wish them to all die out. And finally, there is a big computer who runs everything.

Nothing there you haven't seen before huh? It also takes a while to build up momentum. Though when it does, the plot twists and turns and action scenes are truly exhilarating. The animation quality is breath-taking with seamless blending of hand-drawn, motion capture, CGI and 3D images. Style and plot-wise it is very, very similar to Sky Blue/Wonderful Days. But since they were in production at the same time one cannot accuse the other of plagiarism.

The sheer amount of technology and hardware in the movie will make you drool. There are loads of cool devices, futuristic inventions and awesome weaponry. There is also loads of atmosphere with gorgeous, gorgeous sunsets, storm-lashed oil rigs and wonderfully blue-sky-ed cityscapes with an environmentally friendly amount of trees everywhere.

The Matrix 'inspired' action can be a bit annoying sometimes. We've seen people diving through the air in slow motion will taking out supposedly highly-trained soldiers? And the music is kinda uninspiring. With contributions from Basement Jaxx and Paul Oakenfold one expected it to be a lot better.

When you take the good with the bad, Appleseed still comes out as worthwhile and enjoyable. If your new to Anime then you can forgive the clich?s, if your a big fan then you'll be awe-struck by the impressive production values.

The DVD boasts a stunning 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer and a brilliant DTS 5.1 sound design. A good amount of extras too.",1144800000,4,2268,4.939632545931759

  I have an extensive collection of anime. Everything from the really silly stuff, filled with fan service, to the very serious classics that so many fans rave about. I'm not really into the mecha thing, though I do have a lot of it. It's the animation first that drives my interest, then its the story and the character development are close seconds.

  Appleseed has all that I'm looking for in an anime, and in Spades. Great characters, a well crafted plot, and some of the best animation I have ever see. To say, as some reviewers have, that the movement in this version are unnatural,is more than unfair, it's just not true. All action is extremely lifelike, and the action scenes are the best I've ever seen. I actually found myself reversing the disc to rewatch some action repeatedly, something I never do.

  I've owned this version of Appleseed a few weeks now, and I have watched it at least five times, and am looking forward to another veiwing soon.

  I have relied on Amazon  reveiws to decide whether or not to buy anime in the past, so I hope that this reveiw is helpful. There is a lot of good anime worth investing in, and this one is near the top of my list.",1144713600,76,1338,4.412244897959184

Main character Deunan Knute is a soldier who fought in the war and is brought to a utopia where all is perfect.  Actual humans blend in with Boiroids, artificial humans who feel no emotion and are an indirect way of keeping humans in line.

The movie has a great plot with several unique twists and, in my opinion, a very poweful mesage.  The movie is brilliantly done, with amazing animation that sets itself apart from the upcoming FFVII movie.  I definately recommend this not only for fans of anime, but for any moviegoer.",1144627200,3,606,4.574074074074074

Characters move mechanically--the arms and hands all move together as one piece--no fluid motions.

Even the physics of the movie are poorly worked out--most of the guns have no recoil at all yet send bad guys flying across the screen at point blank range.

I will note that in the scenes without humans--the animation is amazing--very nice.  However, this amounts to nothing when the human characters are so poorly done.

In summary, once you begin watching this version, you will likely become annoyed and start nitpicking it apart.

First off, I love the music and it does a great job capturing the future because of the electronic beats.  The graphics are stunning, but I feel as if I'm watching a CGI clip from a videogame.  The characters move in an unnatural sort of way even though their motions are fluid.  The plot is okay and I think they could have expanded further on the conflict between bioroids and humans instead of focusing on the heroine.  The action was excellent and the sound balancing of the explosions/music/speech was out of whack.  The sound effects are usually too quiet while the music and chatter is a bit loud.  Appleseed does have some cheesy dialogue scenes, but if they would have polished this film even more it could have been another successful film like Ghost in the Shell.  I sensed that once they cranked out the gorgeous graphics they were too exhausted to flesh out the final details that separate a superb and rare film from that of an okay one.",1143504000,,1063,4.443298969072165

I commend them on a job of trying to break the barriers of animation to forge new grounds.

2224807,4,B0007OY31G,"It isn't every day that an anime manages to capture so many touchy elements of life while looking and feeling so unique. ""Appleseed"" does that and does it pretty well.

 Deunan Knute is a well-trained, battle-hardened soldier captured and taken to an urban utopia known as Olympus. Upon her awakening, she finds that her old lover, Briareos, has been turned into a cyborg. The majority of Olympus's inhabitants are Bioroids, genetically altered and enhanced humans. Of course, ""real"" humans still live in Olympus, and one of the main struggles after Deunan's awakening is the conflict between Olympus's Bioroid legislature and the ""real"" Human Army. While the legislature works to establish peace between the two races, a terrorist attack rocks the peaceful utopia, and it's up to Deunan to decide who's really right-the humans or the Bioroids.

 While it contains some anime clich's, such as a central and powerful character with a less-than-stellar past, ""Appleseed"" has a unique look that is difficult to adapt to at first. It's adapted from Masamune Shirow's manga of the same name, but it doesn't have the normal 2D anime-style look to it. It's 3D animation with a lot of blues, dark colors, and shiny reflections. Effects like sweat and blood are captured so realistically that it's almost difficult to tell the difference between anime and real-life, and had it not been for the oversized eyes and clumpy hair, one would have a difficult time distinguishing between real and fake. Initially I felt like I was watching a CG animation in a videogame, just one that lasts a really long time.

 ""Appleseed"" isn't perfect, as it doesn't really connect the viewer to the characters until the end of the film. They're a little hollow and wooden. Why should one care about the Bioroids, beside the fact that they're treated so badly by ""racist"" humans? Why should one care about the relationship between Deunan and Braireos, as it's only influence seems to result in bad decisions for the two during the film? While every story piece manages to meet its end, and loose ties don't need to be tied, there is a certain feeling of ""Why?"" that I got watching ""Appleseed"" until the last third of it.

 In conclusion, ""Appleseed"" is a great movie that, with a little patience, can be enjoyed by anime fans or even those who don't normally watch anime. Even if you don't care much about the characters, some of the themes represented are pretty interesting. It's got some western styles that mix well with anime styles, and because of that, it's a novel film. Check it out, even if it's just because of the graphic presentation.",1138060800,,2619,4.882882882882883

2224812,5,B0007OY31G,"It may be wrong to judge a book by its cover, but a movie can be judged by the quality of its soundtrack which is usually done last, long after the director and all the actors have packed up and gone home: if the director cared enough to get the soundtrack right, you are guaranteed that the rest of the movie will be good too. Applying this test to ""Appleseed"", from the moment the title track starts to play, you just know that you are in for a hell of a ride. I read several reviews before buying this movie, some of them quite critical, but I'm very glad I went ahead and bought it anyway. Having seen the movie four times now I can assure you that the criticisms do not amount to much. Some reviewers were troubled by the ""complexity"" of the plot. I think ""realism"" would be a better word. You start out thinking there are two factions, then three, but by the end of the movie you realize that almost every character was pursuing their own agenda. One thing that makes the character of the heroine so attractive is that she is the only major player without one: when danger threatens she goes ahead and does the ""right thing"" while other characters hesitate. One reviewer even went so far as to suggest that, when dubbing into English, they should have taken the opportunity to simplify the plot and develop the characters more (!!) I thought the dubbed English was uniformly excellent, but it is well worth persevering with the original Japanese dialogue and English subtitles, as there are several plot nuances which come across more clearly, especially the conservations between the council of elders and the bioroid prime minister. Although the movie is by no means a comedy, one of the more amusing moments is when the heroine sets off in pursuit of some bad guys in a huge suit of powered armor in which she was just about to have her learner driver's check ride, much to the dismay of the technician who wonders if he will ever see his machine back again in one piece. Far from being the homicidal uber-female which her anime origins suggest, the heroine is in fact quite restrained, going out of her way to capture rather than kill. Aside from some ghouls of doubtful humanity which she dispatches in the opening sequence, her total body count by the end of the movie is just one, a bad guy whom she executes in revenge for the killing of her father, and who is so unpleasant that even his fellow bad guys feel they are better off without him. Another point that attracted some reviewer criticism was the character movement and use of motion capture. Except for some occasional lapses (watch out for the E-SWAT buddies drinking in the bar) I thought the characters moved in a totally realistic way, much better even than in ""Final Fantasy: The Sprits Within"". Clearly ""Appleseed"" is trying to be closer to its anime roots, hence the slightly two-dimensional character graphics, which are quite intentional, whereas ""Spirits"" is trying to be more of a straight sci-fi movie, with exceptional scenery graphics. But as films worth watching go, I place both of these movies near the top of my personal list.",1136678400,,3116,4.616216216216216
2224813,4,B0007OY31G,"On a future Earth devastated by world wars, there is one shining city that moves all human events, unknown to most. Its name is Utopia, a city guarded by gigantic moving gun fortresses that allow none in except a chosen elite. Its population is made up not only of humans but also genetically engineered clones known as ""Bioroids"", which with the help of a super-computer, control Utopia. Helping to keep the order and fight against enemies from the wastelands are cyborg soldiers called ES.W.A.T. But its enemies are not just outside. Some humans in the city are starting to chaff under what they see as Bioroid dominance. So a silent military revolution has begun, which threatens not only the city, but all humankind. Deunan Knute, an outsider, is rescued from certain death by robotic assassins and brought to Utopia for unknown reasons. Some believe that she has the power to save Utopia. Others think she is better off dead. And things are more complicated. She finds out that her missing ex-lover Briareos, lost his body long ago in battle and is now a cyborg in the employ of ESWAT.

The plot of Appleseed is pretty much stuff you've already seen if you're a fan of anime. A devastated apocalyptic Earth, a computer controlled city revolting against its non-human rulers, even if it might lead to their annihilation, and cyborgs are a standard feature.  Appleseed is CG animated and at times the creators try a little too hard to make the animation seem ""realistic"".  It seems like they spent years making the character's hair move back and forth when they turn their heads. The problem is that this attention to realism actually makes the movement look ""fake"". The same with the blinking of the eyes. If a great white shark could blink, that is an action I would compare it to. The problem with CG has ALWAYS been faces and the cel-shading of Appleseed, while distracting from this weakness, does not solve it. Besides these complaints, I found this movie very entertaining once you got used to the animation style. Some scenes are pretty emotional and work very well. The action especially has a kinetic energy missing from some films, even if some of the slow-mo shots are homages to The Matrix. The artwork is beautiful but digital animation still has miles to go.",1135814400,,2276,4.786259541984733
2224814,4,B0007OY31G,"Based on my first viewing, I would've given this movie only three stars.  The animation is good--though as has been pointed out, not as good as FF: the Spirit Within, but what is?  The soundtrack supports the story, enhances the mood, and helps move the story along, which is basically what it should do.  (I was also pleasantly surprised to find many of the songs in English--and well-done.  If you're an anime fan, you know what I'm talking about.)

There was precious little ""unique"" about the plot:  basic anime dystopia, techno-utopia, political machinations, with the resulting xenophobia, etc.  But it was *fun*.  (Hitomi got a little annoying, but no cast of characters pleases everyone.)  And I say this as (gasp!) someone who really didn't like the original manga.

The reason this gets an extra star is due to the director/producer commentary.  The commentary itself is extremely technical--and rather boring.  However, during the commentary, I learned that ""Appleseed"" wasn't *meant* to be a rival for the animation quality of FF:the Spirit Within, or somehow project every fan's image/dream of the manga onto the big screen.  (FYI:  the creator of the original manga approved of the film and is said to be pleased with it.)

They were trying for something new, to find that line between strict anime style storytelling, live-action, and/or just resting on the glory of their 3D cel animating success.  They were trying to make something *new*, which is always risky, and they did it with a series with a known cult following.  That takes guts.  That deserves some recognition.

And frankly, this is hardly the worst way to spend 90 minutes.  It's entertaining, there's an understated but strong love story, and plenty of sci-fi style action.  It doesn't have the strongest plot, and it doesn't break any new ground in sheer *storytelling*.  It's not going to change your world-view, your college major, or make you love thy neighbor if you don't already.  But it's fun, with enough tension to keep it from being pure fluff. Can't movies still be *fun*?",1133740800,,2065,4.973684210526316
2224815,4,B0007OY31G,"Appleseed will never be hailed as the greatest beacon of anime or manga ever.  It not only has to compete with too many other series, it has to compete with it's own creator's more-famous Ghost in the Shell.

That being said, the older version of Appleseed--unfavorably compared to it's contemporary Akira, an animation I still have yet to see--remains one of my favorites, the OVA to which I attribute responsibility for my own anime fan status; and I was skeptical that a new version could equal it.

Let me say that I was quite pleasantly surprised, as the new version not only equals the original OVA, it even surpasses it.  It's entirely computer-generated, using cel-shading for characters and a combination of cel- and true-shading for everything else.

The character designs are attractive while remaining faithful.  The facial proportions are brought a bit closer to reality from the original, and in many ways, I felt that it would be possible to see someone who looked like several of the characters--Yoshi, Hades, Uranus, Athena, just to name the more prominent ones--on the street.  And while I mention her, this Athena actually looks careworn, instead of simply plain, something the older version didn't get quite right.

The mecha and technology are considered not just for their attractiveness, but for their practical functioning as well, and there's significant thought given to several aspects that haven't been explored much in previous works: the one that sticks out in my mind is during the second fight scene, when a trio of female cyborgs use now-classic monofilament cable ""whips,"" with the effects of such a weapon unflinchingly put on display.

One of my concerns was the favor in OVAs of such affectations as unnecessary nudity; I am pleased again to state that I could count the number of incidents of ""fan service"" on one hand, and in none of them was there flaunted nudity.  In fact, true nudity exists in the OVA only once, and it's heavily downplayed.

The production treats the plot of the manga with more faith than the original OVA; but unfortunately, several of the interpersonal relationships were altered to accommodate the plot.  The setting itself has received subtle alteration as well: in the manga, small nation-states are scattered across the globe, with Olympus the most prosperous and powerful; in this OVA, Olympus is the last bastion of civilization remaining.

Yes, the plot is predictable.

Appleseed also touches on the larger issues Shirow addresses in the manga, such as freedom, duty, war, and the nature of humanity.  Unfortunately, these are merely touched on, as the OVA doesn't have the length needed to retain the plot and properly address these issues.  But they are still present; the questions are still being asked, even if less overarchingly than in the original source material.

Yes, the animation can look slightly artificial.  Yes, the new Appleseed is a gorgeous piece of work well-deserving of being watched by any true fan of either anime or cyberpunk.",1133222400,2,3024,5.050301810865191
2224816,3,B0007OY31G,"Close to the beginnings of my anime reviewing here I saw the 2001 Final Fantasy release.  This set a standard for CGI that may very well never be equaled without a significant technology breakthrough.  Another notable film of the period was the original Ghost in the Shell, had outstanding animation.  Appleseed has much in common with both films.  It shares the heavy use of CGI, and some interesting bits of underlying philosophy with Final Fantasy.  And, like Ghost, it was created from a manga series from Masamune Shirow.  If you're familiar with Ghost in the Shell you may very well see the world of Appleseed as that post-apocalyptic version of Ghost's, which was already unraveling.

Here the world is mostly ruined, other than a small colony composed of humans and bioroids - androids whose primary function seems to be to balance humanity's tendency to self-destruct.  They are indistinguishable from humans other than that they lack the ability to breed, and cannot feel anger.  Yet all this is apparently to no avail.  With no outer war to distract them mankind has opted for inner violence, and Olympus is torn by human fear of the bioroids.

Into this comes Deunan Knute, a deadly woman warrior who is the daughter of a woman who helped create the first bioroids, and, in the company of Briarius, and old lover who has become more machine than human, Deunan is Olympus's hope for the future.  Buried within her mind is the key that will complete the bioroids, and give them the capability to love and have children.  The events trigger an Armageddon like confrontation.

The story is almost successful, despite it's somewhat simplistic characterization.  Director Shinji Arimaki fails to provide some needed continuity, though.  The result is that important things happen off-stage and there are too many unexplained switches in the plot.  Arimaki has seized the primary theme of human anger, suspicion and xenophobia, thrown in a lost of admittedly spectacular scenery and fight scenes.  But he only pays lip service to the deeper questions of human nature that Shirow often addresses.  The result is an vary entertaining film that just misses the mark.

That being said, it's still worth watching.  There is an earlier animation film of this story that enjoys a significant cult following.  I would like to see that, and look at the manga as well.  There is something to this that does capture the imagination, and there's more to be found than what this film focuses on.",1131753600,27,2487,4.9397590361445785
2224817,4,B0007OY31G,"Good anime, stunning visuals, surely much better than the original Appleseed. The plot is decent enough and should keep you entertained - the music is absolutely amazing, but everything else about the film is just decent.

Check it out for a cool, fun film... but don't expect a prize winner or a film to remember. I'm giving this 4 stars based on what it is... for a fun action anime it's 4 stars, everything else it would probably score a 3 (this includes drama within the story and creativity).

Again don't expect too much! I didn't go into it expecting anything (in fact I didn't even know what it was about when I first watched it) and ended up really enjoying it.",1131667200,,670,4.483606557377049
2224818,3,B0007OY31G,"Hi there, I bought this DVD and I'm happy with it, however the storyline is fairly well composed and the scenes are great, the characters lack. Most of the anime is based on character shading. This means the characters have been modified to look *3-d* but they are not (computer graphic artists insert shades to create and illusion for your eyes to make them look *3-d* or CGi [Computer Generated Imaging]), this was very disappointing. I have been a Anime Fan for more over 5 years. I have seen almost every great anime out there. I bought this anime because I have never seen it, I loved the story line, it's simple to understand, the action was fairly well composed as well. This is the second anime I've seen done with character shading and I dis-like the art. However for the creativity and excellent action I gave it 3 out of 5 stars. I suggest if you have not seen Ghost In The Shell yet buy this DVD watch it, then go watch GiTS (Ghost In The Shell), The story line somewhat resembles GiTS because of the Bio-roids (half human half robot or cyborgs theme), all though GiTs is not CGi or Character shading just plain anime it has a great storyline, very well animated, great action, over all wonderful anime. But if you have seen GiTS in the past I suggest you pass on buying this anime unless you find wasting your moneya good thing. D/L it.

The only thing that kept me watching this movie was the awesome graphic.  It was like watching 3D animated cells rendering.  Ghost in the Shell's best is second to the technical visual of this film.  Sadly, the plot and storyline was not as innovation or spectacular at all.  It felt like watching an average Hollywood's film that regurgitated other themes, plots and ideas from other movies and reused it.  Like another reviewer noted, the character and facial expression felt like ""Reboot,"" which was first generation computer animation in the US.

Don't get me wrong. I am an Animation fan and can appreciate just about everything that Anime artists have to offer. Appleseed however is unfortunately a let down.

After a while you get tired of watching the same old clichs that seem to occur in most action oriented Japanese Animation....Female characters with unnaturally large breasts who carry guns and go from tough, soldier women to pathetic, weepy, overly sensitive girls (just what Japanese men dream about)......characters who seem to be evil or good at the beginning and then suddenly switch sides for unclear reasons and have you scratching your head long after the film is over and last but not least.....the unending, unanswerable ""meaning of human existence"" question that seems to be a repetitive theme in a lot of Anime. Please Anime writers, no one wants to hear cartoon characters argue for 20 minutes on the esscence of humanity.

Yes, the visuals and the actual Animation is stunning. Truly incredible. The story line....well....lets put it this way, this film did NOT do well in Japan.....watch it and find out why...",1127606400,10,1256,4.976190476190476

2224830,3,B0007OY31G,"Appleseed, based upon a manga by legendary mangaka Shirow Masamune, is the latest of feature-length Japanese anime movies to be released in movie theaters across the U.S. Those of us here in North America must generally find our needs in regards to the anime market satiated through DVDs or less-than-legal downloads off of the internet, and thus it is a cause for celebration when news hits that such a movie is to hit mainstream movie theaters. Suffice it to say, if our hopes are to be excited in such a way, the movie itself must deliver. Unfortunately, Appleseed manages to disappoint in nearly all facets it attempts to conquer. A strained story tries to be deep yet ends up swimming in the kiddie pool, promising 3D visuals end up comparing more to Reboot, an aged show that used to play on Cartoon Network, than Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence.

In fact, from a visual standpoint, Appleseed has absolutely no excuse to fall flat. We've seen far better from previous films from Japan, some a few years old, yet it trips up on so many of its tangled wires. Some jagged, unpolished visuals would find themselves more at home as a PS2 cutscene than as a bigscreen feature film. Ironically, a recent PS2 game, Armored Core Nexus, has an intro sequence that features mechs that actually looks eons better than anything this movie presents. This is by no means an exaggeration. There are several sequences in the movie with grainy edges when there is no seemingly no excusable reason to have crisp, fine-tuned edges. In fact, during a dramatic scene in the movie, one can't help but notice slight texture slip-ups on regions of an outheld gun. And this is just the surface: the character models are clearly anime-inspired, and while they look plenty appealing when stationary, they begin to rip apart at the seams with movement. When talking, their mouths articulate about as well as a G.I.Joe being manipulated by a little kid. This clearly takes away from practically every dramatic shot in the entire movie, as your attention is focused away from the bland lines the characters are spouting and more towards their rubbery movements.

The story supplementing these poor visuals follows suit. It's typical anime science-fiction drivel that can't compare to the greats. Its a story of a feud between humans and a new, peaceful race known as the Bio-roids contained within a new utopic city known as Olympus. While it certainly struggles with some deeper symbolism, particularly centered around Greek mythology, there's a surprising lack of substance to be had. You can't sympatheize with any of the characters, especially when they move about as gracefully as a Barbie, and in the end the plot is just a bit too distant to lend any sort of meaning to today's society.

Stilted plot, bland characters, and mediocre visuals should be manageable so long as the action is entertaining. In that regard, Appleseed succeeds to a slight degree. There are a couple of action sequences that are simply bursting with energy, mostly the ones involving Mechs. Yet these sequences are really nothing special, especially when your lust for action is better fulfilled in several other mediums. The action isn't always a high-point, however, especially when it combines with the films other flaws. The climax of the movie is immensely dissapointing, with a premise so utterly overdone that you may find yourself in disbelief that the movie is actually presenting it and seriously at that. Oh, but it is.

Suffice it to say, Appleseed should not be at the top of any moviegoers list. Particularly not that of anime fans, who have probably seen this exact premise thousands of times over. It may be suitable as a rental for the scant action sequences, but you'd be better off foregoing this in light of something more stellar, such as Ghost in the Shell 2 or Metropolis.",1125273600,5,3852,4.876335877862595

I thought the animation was amazing. It was done in CGI, laid over with regular animation for the characters. The amount of detail in the animation is just astounding. One particular scene comes to mind when Deunan and Briareos are talking in a locker room; you can actually see dust floating in the sunbeam coming through the window. One thing that got on my nerves, however, was the way the characters hair was drawn. It was very clumpy and didn't move at all.

The story was very entertaining as well. Basically the last city, Olympus, is half populated by humans and half populated by Bioroids (artificial clones). There are extremist human groups who want to get rid of the Bioroids completely, thusly returning full control and power to the humans. The fait of both the Bioroids and humans ends up resting on the shoulders of Deunan and her retrieving the Appleseed technology that her mother helped produce.

My only complaints are that there was a tremendous amount of dialog and explaining. Also, the English dubbing was poor. There was little emotion in the voices of the voice actors. Aside from that, I thought it was a great movie.",1123718400,5,1300,4.672489082969432

I'm a huge fan of Ninja Scroll and some other Anime movies. When seeing an ad on internet site for this movie. I had to see what it was all about!

2224841,3,B0007OY31G,"Based on the comic book series by Masamune Shirow, APPLESEED takes place on a future Earth following a massive world war.  A small zone of peace and civilization exists in Olympus, a city overseen by the supercomputer Gaia.  Balance is kept via the coexistence of humans and bioroids, artificial beings with suppressed emotions (who are thus less likely to lead to dissent and more war.)  But as it is human nature to fear other races, many fear a time when bioroids will control humans.  It is up to skilled warrior Deunan Knute to unlock the secret from her past that will prevent a new conflict from breaking out.

This version of APPLESEED is entirely computer generated, to varying degrees of success.  The outdoor night scenes look spectacular, while day and indoor scenes look rather artificial.  At first I thought the human characters were hand drawn, but they too are rendered, though not as fully as those in 2001's FINAL FANTASY movie.  They appear flat and doll-like next to the scenery and mechanical constructs, with their hair curiously molded.  It might have been better if they had been done the old-fashioned way after all.

The film is presented on DVD in three 5.1 soundtracks: English Dolby Digital, Japanese Dolby Digital, and Japanese DTS.  I'm not set up for DTS yet so I watched it with the second option, and it sounded fantastic.  This is a movie you'll want to show off your surround sound system with.

Extras on the standard DVD edition include a director and producer commentary, previews for other Geneon releases, and staff biographies.  You can also jump directly to the musical sequences within the film; featured artists (with biographies) include Boom Boom Satellites, Paul Oakenfold, Ryuichi Sakamoto and others.  There is also an advert for the CD soundtrack, and DVD credits, but it's reaching a bit to call these extras.

This film has been rated R by the MPAA which I think is harsh.  Except for a little bloody violence in the opening sequence, there's nothing in APPLESEED that wouldn't be appropriate for younger viewers, although the story may fly over their heads.  If you're going to watch it around kids, you might want to just jump past the first chapter.  Or not.

Despite the ambitious nature of the production, I found it left me a bit cold overall.  This may be stating the obvious, since most of the characters we meet are artificial, but there is very little emotion or humanity in the story.  I didn't care much about any of them.  The story isn't very involving, and Deunan's ties with Olympus' origins felt contrived.

2224847,4,B0007OY31G,"The story in this is not the best, but it is better than most of the trash the Hollywood puts out now-a-days.  There were parts that I felt a little bit lost (and that is pretty rare) but everything cleared up by the end.  There really is nothing ground breaking in either the story telling or science fiction technology.  However, in the end, I did find this quite entertaining and action-packed.

However, what blew my mind away was the computer graphics!!  There were three things that really did fantastically well... pretty much ground-breaking.  Though none of them were perfect, they are some of the best I've seen in animation.

1)  The buildings and the cities.  They looked really, really close to being real.  They weren't perfect as I was still easily reminded that I was watching a cartoon, but I haven't seen anything this close before.  The randomness of what was happening on the streets (a good variety of cars fills the streets) and the shapes of the buildings is what you would expect to find if you were looking at any large city from above.  It was really done well.

2)  The people, especially their movement.  The biggest problem I had with them was their heads.  Their eyes are too big and colorful.  They are either too blue, too green, or even too ??red??.  And the hair was very clumpy as if everybody on earth only had about fifty strands of really, really thick hair.  It was too easy to remember that this was an animation I was watching whenever humanoids were on the screen.

Three years ago a movie called Final Fantasy: The Spirit Within was released that nailed what I would consider perfection when it comes to facial looks and hair.  Especially the hair.

So what did I like?  The motion of their bodies!  They were very, very fluid and looked very life-like.  They ran like humans, they walked like humans... they all looked very, very lifelike.  Except their heads, of course.  There is even a scene were Duenan (the story's protagonist) is hanging from something and swings her body up to get on top.  Very, very lifelike.  The motion of the bodies is fantastic and I've never seen it done this well before.

Now if they would only work with the producers of Final Fantasy to perfect the heads.  Okay, enough on that.

3)  The water.  Water was done well once again.  There was one time, when looking at a stormy sea of water, where I had to rewind it.  It didn't look like an animation; it looked like it was actually filmed.  I had to look very close to catch the small little imperfection and lack of randomness in order to convince myself that it wasn't filmed.  The only time water was off was when they came from the eyes of somebody crying (mostly Duenan) or tearing up.  That didn't come across convincingly whether it was swelling up in her eyes, dripping down her face, or splashing on the floor.  I haven't seen so many tears since Alice in Wonderland.

If you like action, even if you don't like cartoons, pick this up.  It has plenty of it.  If you like Sci-fi then I can't think of any reason to skip this movie.  If you like Anime then this is one I doubt you'll want to miss.

If you don't fit in any categories then forget it, I can't think of anybody else who would want to see it.  I must say, this isn't for the weak of heart (i.e. small children), there really is a lot of action and violence.",1118880000,2,3354,4.46039603960396

Very awesome film.",1118016000,2,429,4.666666666666667
2224851,5,B0007OY31G,"Why would they make an action figure come along with this movie it will make kids think the the movie is for them but really it's rated ""R"". I like the movie it's one of those anime's that place in the future the orginal ""Appleseed"" was made back in 1988 but it had nothing on ""Akira"" now this new version has 3D meats 2D at the same time how amazing.",1117929600,,351,4.0285714285714285
2224852,5,B0007OY31G,"Graphically speaking, this is the best anime movie of all time. And they had a limited budget. The story is magnificent, and the dialogue is ok. The city driving in a hover car was the best and most colorful part of the movie. Plus the beginning of the movie with the gruesome head crushing and blood mist in the air-WOW. This anime is better than great, Its Magnificent.",1117152000,3,371,4.470588235294118
2224853,4,B0007OY31G,"This animation is based on a comic by Masamune Shirow, a master of depicting distopian futures in which humanity must struggle with technology for its survival.  In this case, much of the world has been destroyed by war, but one oasis of humanity exists, Olympus.  Thanks to its balance of human and android inhabitants, it has been able to maintain a peaceful existance.  However, there are those with prejudices who want to disrupt this balance.  Can Olympus surivive?

An attempt was made to maka a fully 3D animated feature like Pixar.  However, there was a conscious effort to stick closely to the style common in anime.  It's interesting to see the 2D world of anime come to life in full 3D.  However, it was not an entirely successful transition.  The characters are oddly weightless, so at times, it looks like dolls moving around on screen rather than flesh and blood (or steel!) characters on screen.  In fact, this looks mostly like the intro to a game stretched out over 2 hours.  For this, a take away one star, but it's still worth checking out.  A good effort was made, and I hope we get more along this line, with better animation of course.",1117152000,4,1157,4.645320197044335
2224854,5,B0007OY31G,"A great movie all around. Great animation, lots of action, a thought provoking plot and a great adaption of Shirow's orriginal Appleseed manga.
The Limited Edition Collector's Tin is well worth it too. An extremely nice case, very impresive.",1117065600,,241,5.205128205128205

I'm no anime fan but if they look this good and have this kind of amazing action I'm soon to be a huge one. I can't get over the fantastic action sequences and the way a cartoon movie had such a realistic look and feel to it. Also, the characters were very interesting. So much so, it made me want to care about them. The CGI is nothing short of incredible and when these huge vehicles come crashing towards the screen...well it's nothing short of amazing, too. I just can't say enough good things about this movie.

I was reeled in the entire time and I can't remember the last time I could say that about any movie. I tried to get into anime once before by watching the COWBOY BEBOOP movie but I just didn't get a feel for it. Now, after watching APPLESEED, I can't help but feel I may really be missing out on something.

FAN or NO FAN of Anime, if you like ACTION and tons of EYE-CANDY then don't hesitate to own ""AppleSeed"". I can't imagine anyone not loving this movie. It's nothing short of amazing. I only wish I'd purchased the 2-disc version first, so I could have saved a few bucks, because I must see the extras for this movie.

TWO THUMBS UP and a huge MUST SEE!!!",1116979200,4,1196,4.232456140350878
2224856,5,B0007OY31G,"This is, hands down, some of the best CGI anime ever made.  Movement is smooth as silk, and realistically rendered; character interaction with background and surroundings is perfect.  The storyline is well-written and the characters are rounded and believable. Even the dialogue, a perennial weak point for anime, is excellent.

The only thing that lags here is the voice-over work, another area in which anime suffers as a whole.  Perhaps this is because all the development money on these project is typically spent on artists and rendering equipment. The work of anime voice-over actors (especially English ones) is of generally poor quality and Appleseed is no exception.

Appleseed instantly became a top-5 item for me, equalling and in some respects, surpassing the Ghost in the Shell saga.",1116892800,,796,5.2362204724409445
2224857,5,B0007OY31G,"Now this is not so much a review of the film mind you, but the manner in which it was released.  I hope all you people over at Dreamworks/Universal are paying attention since that debacle that was your Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence DVD release, because this is how it's done...

1. Basics to begin with, this DVD has GOOD cover art, using original works by the 3D artists who made the film in a very manga-esque way.  The art on GITS 2 was bunk.  Hand drawn, and badly at that, it gives no impression of the mastery of the CG work in the actual film.

2. Seperate releases.  Always nice to have the regular DVD and an extra special one with lots and lots of bonus content for those who want it.

3. English.. Granted the majority of anime fans want the subtitled versions because in Japanese you can't tell if the voice acting is bad or not, so it sounds good by comparison to most english dubs.  But, some people just don't want to read their movies andfor a big release like GITS 2 i think a dubbed version isn't too much to ask.. Good job appleseed, that's 3 points in a row for you.

Let's all just hope that next time anime is left in the hands of professionals like Manga, ADV, and Geneon, and the major American studios can just keeps their hands off.",1116720000,3,1260,4.2384937238493725
2224858,5,B0007OY31G,"Everyone who sees this will ultimately compare ""Appleseed"" to PIXAR 3-D animated films.  I must say this is a truly unfair comparison for many reasons.  For one, if you're going to compare PIXAR films with this rare gem, you better take into consideration the budget restraints and limitations ""Appleseed"" had.  Made on a trifle $10 million, ""Appleseed"" blows the audience away with its beautiful detail and amazing animation.  Sure, it's not on par with the $150 million dollar films PIXAR pumps out, but to compare the two would be like comparing a small independent garage film to a mega dollar studio backed Hollywood blockbuster.  They're both movies, perhaps even similar genres, but they can't be compared solely for the purpose of showing contrast.

What you get in Appleseed is the best 3-D animation I've seen.  I for one preferred its realism and rich tones over the soft cloth texture pastels of many PIXAR films.  I would bet that if it had the budget of a PIXAR film it would have looked 100 times better than all of PIXAR's films combined.  If you need proof, just look at how close the Japanese came this time around.

Other people claim that the cell shading makes it look hokey.  I actually thing this style suits the film.  The backgrounds are realistic, and ""Appleseed"" has a style  and flair that reeks of too cool.  Considering that they cell shaded a 3-D film to look more like traditional 2-D animation almost sounds like an oxymoron, but it gives a flavor entirely unique to this movie, giving it a much needed aesthetic originality from other films within the same genre of 3-D animation.  For once we can enjoy an adult story with real emotions and characters and not have to fall to the kiddy gimmicks of a film like ""The Incredibles.""  Although ""The Incredibles"" raised the bar for action in a children's film, it is a far cry from anything resembling adult storytelling and entertainment.  Appleseed satisfies the older generation of animation lovers and lets us delight on the rarity of this high caliber story telling aimed for well rounded and mature audiences.  ""Appleseed"" is definitely worth adding to your personal DVD collection.",1116460800,,2167,4.858310626702997
2224859,5,B0007OY31G,"After seeing the original movie released by Manga a while back, this is a major jump of greatness. At first, it takes a while to get used to the animation, it's as if watching a video game at some moments, while at times it becomes like a painting. This is worth it, especially if you were disappointed with Final Fantasy's action. The plot is predictable, with a few twists in the way. But as with most Masamune Shirow modern reworks, the designs are obviously revamped to more realism, the big eyes are still there.

The weapons are something to look at, as always in anime, research has always been done to blend a balanced present and futuristic/fantasy weapon. ESWAT Landmates being dropped by VTOL vehicles that resemble Osprey's, the Olympus regular Army using rifles that resemble M-4's, but are actually Bull-pups.

All-in-all a great movie for your surround sound system.",1116288000,,881,4.866666666666666

the visuals are pretty sweet, as a whole though, it almost feels too much like a capcom game or something, i think everybody would probly agree with that.

but i feel its an important anime, i enjoyed it inspite of all my criticism, i just had high hopes thats all, anyway, buy it.",1116115200,2,434,4.216867469879518
2224861,5,B0007OY31G,"Although this movie has a decent plot, where it rules is the jaw dropping presentation in 3DCG and DD/DTS 5.1. It literally rocks after seconds into the movie.
