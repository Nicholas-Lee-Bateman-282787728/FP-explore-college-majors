8060886,5,B0009HBPAS,This dvd is great. I accomplished my goal---getting the Red Skelton Christmas special with Vincent Price on dvd and got some extra stuff in the process. I would recommend this to any Red Skelton fan!!!,1389139200,,201,4.771428571428571
8060887,5,B0009HBPAS,"I bought this as a gift and he loves it.  If you like classic comedies, you will like this one.",1355529600,,95,3.75
8060888,4,B0009HBPAS,"The dvd is very good and I didn't have any of the episodes, however, the ad is misleading. The reviews say it is ""Excuse My Dust"" about an inventor who makes a car. That is the movie I have been searcing for, but when it arrived it was a collection of Red's shows. When I emailed to say I received the wrong dvd, I was told one dvd was sent by mistake and if I ordered it again I would receive the right one so I ordered it again and received the wrong one again, so I won't be ordering again.",1269820800,,493,3.891089108910891
8060889,3,B0009HBPAS,"I agree that this is a great DVD to own in the fact that you are getting the entire Christmas Program.  The other programs have indeed been cut in their original run times and are missing some very amusing moments.  The only reason I purchased this DVD was to own ""Freddy the Freeloader's Christmas Dinner"" on DVD as my VHS is now wearing out.  Unless this is your reason to purchase, save your money...",1259107200,4,403,4.418918918918919
8060890,5,B0009HBPAS,THIS HAS ALL THE PROGRAMS LISTED AND THE QUALITY WAS GREAT. MY WIFE LOVED THE CHRISTMAS SPECIAL THE MOST.,1243296000,,105,4.578947368421052
8060891,5,B0009HBPAS,"EXCUSE MY DUST, (1951) The funniest car race ever is long over due for release on DVD. It features Red Skelton at his very best, Sally Forrest, Macdonald Carey and William Demarest in brilliant Technicolor and 81 minutes of extreme comedy. I owned a copy on 16mm Eastman Color SP, but sadly it faded by 1990. So Mr. MGM, how about a pristine print of EXCUSE MY DUST on DVD? Any other takers?",1226188800,8,391,4.36986301369863
8060892,5,B0009HBPAS,It is excellent. I am sharing it  with friends and relatives. Good comedies sitcome are hard to find.,1179360000,2,101,4.611111111111111
8060893,2,B0009HBPAS,"I had been looking forward to a DVD version of the Red Skelton TV specials, yet I'm disappointed that these are the shortened (edited for commercial & announcement time) versions which have several sections of each program removed, making them about 15 mins. shorter than the full (live performance) VHS tape releases. The quality of the video is acceptable, however, and is well worth getting if you don't already own the VHS tapes of the TV specials ... (just can't understand why the publisher didn't put the full versions in the collection ... probably cheaper this way ...)",1122854400,56,578,4.908163265306122
