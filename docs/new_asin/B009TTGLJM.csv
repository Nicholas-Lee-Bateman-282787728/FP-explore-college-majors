5368224,4,B009TTGLJM,"This DVD contains 3 versions of SEVEN KEYS TO BALDPATE and all are surprisingly good.  Old-fashioned fun...if you are looking for blood and gore, look elsewhere because these movies are from an era when those things didn't appear in movies.  Quality is excellent in all versions.  Crisp black and white.  If you like a mystery that takes place during a snowstorm in an old mansion, this is the one for you.  Recommended for those of you who love classic b&w mysteries.",1366156800,18,468,4.728395061728395
5368225,5,B009TTGLJM,"This story, written originally by Earl Derr Biggers, the originator of the Charlie Chan character, was filmed at least five times.  It is good to have three of the filmed versions all in one set, and I find it hard to pick a favorite.  The tellings change with the time of production, so this is an interesting study in the development of film and fashions, as well as dramatic taste.

The story belongs in the humorous subdivision of mysteries.  There is no horror, but droll characters and a good (and complex) puzzle.",1363046400,2,520,4.619565217391305

All I wish to say is that I liked the 1947 version the best, then the 1929 version and last the 1935.  It is fantastic getting all three versions in the one case.

5368244,3,B009TTGLJM,"Forgotten author Earl Derr Biggers, he created Charlie Chan. But another claim to fame is that he also penned the 1913 mystery novel Seven Keys to Baldpate, which legendary theatrical impresario George M. Cohan then tweaked for Broadway later that year. It's been an extended series of cinematic adaptations. Cohan himself starred in the 1917 silent flick. There are reportedly a 1916 Australian version and a lost 1925 version. And then we've got these three in a pack: the iterations 1929 (with Richard Dix), 1935 (with Gene Raymond), and 1947 (with Phillip Terry). Pardon me as I indulge with the 1935 picture (it's the one I just saw).

Mr. MaGee (Raymond), a novelist seeking privacy, should ask for his money back. On a dark, stormy night he's arrived at the abandoned Baldpate Inn to win a sizable wager by writing a book in 24 hours. Before amscraying, the old caretaker woman hands over a key and solemnly confides: ""It's the only key to Baldpate Inn - the only one."" Caretaker woman should've glanced at the film title.

MaGee's solitude lasts all of mere minutes before being obliterated by a constant parade of suspicious intruders, and I guess none of them heard about the inn's shutting down for the winter. Soon, our hero is drawling out lines such as ""I gather from your remark that you're a gangster,"" and ""Now, look, you won't turn out to be a detective from the district attorney's office, will you? Promise me.""

It's evident from jump that we're in for a lighthearted caper. A farcical touch punches up the story. But let's do an inventory. Much of what's on camera is cast in ominous shadows. It's a peculiar cast of characters. Storm raging outside. Scurrying black cats triggering fake scares. Secret panels. Hidden loot. Talk of ghosts and haunting. Really, the only thing missing is the creepy butler. In all else, Seven Keys to Baldpate resembles the Old Dark House thriller. In fact, I wouldn't blink twice if this film is what launched the Old Dark House sub-genre.

I normally don't care one way or another for Gene Raymond. He's a passable leading man, but many of his contemporaries were more watchable. And yet he handles this role with laid back panache, and I quite liked him this time out, liked him whether he's cheekily bracing gunsels and scoundrels and thieving, misogynistic hermits or romancing the perhaps duplicitous dame, Mary Norton (Margaret Callahan). Mary claims to be an actress come to Baldpate so as to mysteriously disappear as a front page publicity stunt. Except that here's MaGee giving her that ""Uh-huh, yeah"" look. Note that Magee never does finish his book. He never even starts it.

If nothing else, this movie drives home why one should never ever hide $200,000 in the stove.",1401667200,,2736,4.837606837606837
5368245,5,B009TTGLJM,"Originally I was only looking for the Gene Raymond film, which I had seen many times on Turner Classics.  I was delightfully surprised to find THREE versions (the first a silent with Richard Dix).  This film is a real classic (written by Earl Derr Biggers, better known for Charlie Chan).  It's a wonderful ""old, dark house"" mystery that should not be missed.",1392336000,,359,4.758064516129032
5368246,2,B009TTGLJM,I am disappointed in all aspects of these three mystery movies. Can say the 1935 version was better than the rest if there was such. Not worth the price I paid $27 for them.,1380412800,,173,4.117647058823529
5368247,5,B009TTGLJM,"The three versions in this collection are more based on the play than the book. However I suggest you also read the book by Earl Derr Biggers (of Charlie Chan fame) to get more insight on what was changed.

All three versions are ""A Radio Picture"" RKO in monochrome.

1929 version
We start out in a hotel lobby club where Mr. McGee (Richard Dix) who rites love stories in books with purple covers, accepts a challenge writing 10,000 word novel in 24 hours. It gets complicated when the writer falls in love a first site with Mary Norton (Miriam Seegar). And where does a writer get his stories and inspiration? Looks like this time the guy may not get the girl in the end.

Richard Dix acts like he is just getting used to talkies.

1935 version
A light weight writer, Mr. McGee (Gene Raymond), decides that it is time for him to write a classic novel. He is challenged to a bet that he cannot writ it in 24 hours; in an effort to write this novel he needed to find a place for perfect solitude. That place turns out to be an inn high up on Baldpate Mountain that was closed for the winter. Little did he know that there were seven Keys to Baldpate Inn.  With each key can a person or persons with unique characteristics and a good reason for being there. If you can believe who they are and their reasons. Mr. McGee suspects them all of being some part of a convoluted plot which nobody will let him in on.

We go along for the ride. There is no use speculating. And Mr. McKee's chivalry may be his undoing.

They punched up the dialog since the 1929 version.

1947 version
Already starts out with darker sounding music. Then we have a train scene. Everyone knows about train mysteries. This time Kenneth Magee (Phillip Terry) is getting a jump on the novel while in the train to Baldpate Inn. The lights go out. Luckily no one dies at this point. Surprise for those that watched the 1935 version it is the same stage set-up and buildings. We get to see that this Magee writs murder mysteries such as ""The case of the Shuttering Stiff"" With not enough shoot'n.

This version has plenty of shooting and people being dispatched all over the place. But with all the commotion will Kenneth finish his novel in time. Some mysterious goings on tell me that it will be a tossup.

A small change of characters from previous versions and the novel.",1379116800,7,2340,4.395833333333333
5368248,4,B009TTGLJM,"Although based on a book by Earl Derr Biggers, creator of the Chinese detective Charlie Chan, this is not a whodunit.

Dime novelist Kenneth Magee specializes in crime stories, murder mysteries, and stories of hero's and heroine's who fall in love at first sight.  He takes a bet that he can write a novel in 24 hours while sequestered in a lonely, rundown inn, but he will not be lonely for long, when stereotypical characters - right out of his books - begin showing up.  It's hard to write with all that commotion:  gunshots, women's screams, criminals sulking about, a hermit's comings and goings, and the beautiful women, one with whom he falls in love with at first sight ... just when ... is he going to find time to write?

1929 version - Picture: variable, generally 3, occasionally a blurry 2.5.  Sound: coarse.
1935 version - Picture: 3.
1947 version - Picture: 3.5 to 4.

8544320,4,B009TTGLJM,"You never know what guys will bet on, even guys who don't look like they need dough, serious dough anyway. That is the hook behind the film adaptations of crime novelist Earl Derr Biggers Seven Keys To Baldpate (Bigger better known for his classic Charlie Chan series). (I will use the 1947 as an example) The bet: that left to his own devices, left alone crime writer Kenneth McGee, played by Phillip Terry, can finish a crime novel in a short specific period of time. The prize: five thousand in cash (yeah I know nothing but walking around today as one of my fellow film critics mentioned when commenting on the money stolen in some 1950s bank robbery in a film he was reviewing). The chase is on.

Part of the idea behind the bet was for McGee to head for the quiet of a shutdown for the season New England inn in order to pursue his work in peace. McGee is given the only key to the inn and heads up smacking his lips that this bet would be like money found on the ground. But as the title of film tips us to he is not the only one with a key to access that well-worn front door. The place turned into Grand Central Station as people with very mixed motived keep popping up in this isolated snow drifted place. Toward the end I thought maybe I had a key and got mad that I didn't have one.

The cast of rogues who show up include, lets count them, since we know McGee has one, an unexpected caretaker who greets him at the door, a hermit, a femme, a professor, a gunman, and the fetching secretary of the guy who McGee made the bet with, Mary played by Jacqueline White to add a little off-hand romance while McGee figures out the motives of his co-residents. Thats seven in my book.  Here where you have to look twice at some guys, some guys you bet with, since Marys motives are straight up. She had been sent by the guy McGee bet to make sure that he didn't finish the novel on time. Not fair, not fair at all.

As for the others, except the hermit who is just there for effect, they are in this Podunk out of the way place to divvy up the spoils from a big jewel heist. Among themselves they manage to shoot up the place as they double-cross each other leaving two dead in the end when the coppers come to put paid the whole enterprise. Just your average crime story. Hey a story McGee could write in a jiffy and still collect the dough. Except that fetching secretary with the long legs showing to good effect got him all brain-addled when she flopped herself on his lap and dared him to ignore her. McGee should have known the fix was in.",1490400000,,2549,4.217213114754099
8544321,4,B009TTGLJM,"A wonderful 3-fer of George M. Cohan's stage comedy in which a mystery writer is given the 'only' key to a closed-for-the-season hotel in order to write a mystery in 24 hours in order to win a bet.  He quickly discovers that there are more keys to Baldpate than Florida Keys.  There is sufficient variation between the three screenplays to keep you interested until you've viewed them all.  My personal favorite is the iteration starring Gene Raymond, which has the best collection of supporting actors that enhance the quirky characters' behaviors. Henry Travers is especially funny as the Hermit.  The 1947 version has its moments as well, although I found Eduardo Ciannelli a bit too heavy for the 'heavy',  Jimmy Conlin is a creditable Hermit.  Great 'old dark house' fun.",1462752000,3,776,4.930769230769231

8544324,5,B009TTGLJM,"Great trio of the same mystery-comedy story.  A writer, on a bet that he can or can't write a story in one night, goes to stay at a closed-for-the-season inn for isolation and privacy.  He gets more than he bargained for when a conglomeration of characters, all with dubious or nefarious intentions, arrive at the inn at separate times with ""THE ONLY KEY IN EXISTENCE"".  The 1929 and the 1947 versions aren't bad and are entertaining, but it is the 1935 version that is the gem of the three.  The Warner Archive DVD-R is excellent quality with all three films in pristine condition and crisp, clear black and white photography.  Highly recommended.",1439078400,6,648,4.75
