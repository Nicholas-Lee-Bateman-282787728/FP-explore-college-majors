4951670,4,B0064NLRG8,"THE DOUBLE HOUR (LA DOPPIA ORA) is a maze of a film, one of those films that seem to have a straightforward storyline until suddenly what has been happening in front of our eyes is not at all the real story. The script by Alessandro Fabbri, Ludovica Rampoldi and Stefano Sardo is smart, clever in a Hitchcockian way,and succeeds in keeping us on the periphery of a fascinating tale. This is Giuseppe Capotondi's first film as a director and it gives notice of a new talent on the horizon.

The setting is Turin. Sonia (gifted and stunningly beautiful Russian actress Kseniya Rappoport) works as a chambermaid in an elegant hotel and in the opening scene she witnesses the suicide of the woman whose room she is cleaning. Apparently distraught by the incident she seeks refuge in a speed dating club run by the mysterious Marisa (Lucia Poli) who watches carefully as Sonia encounters the club's most frequent attendee, former cop Guido (Filippo Timi). Both Sonia and Guido are cautious about involvement but eventually they leave Turin for a country weekend getaway. Guido is serving as a security guard for a wealthy Italian, but the house is empty and Guido turns off the security system. While the two are having an amorous tryst the house is invaded by thieves who steal everything and shoot Guido, grazing Sonia with a bullet. Events occur that are not as they seem and Sonia's strange past is relived before our eyes - or is what we are seeing the effects of Sonia being in a coma after the shooting? To say more would be to deprive the viewer of the very strange twists and turns this story takes until the final few minutes of the film when the audience realizes they have been part of the charade.

Kseniya Rappoport won the Best Actress award in the 2009 Venice Film Festival for the complex and multifaceted performance she offers in this film. The supporting cast is excellent with Filippo Timi being particularly talented in holding together an impossible to believe character study. The musical score by Pasquale Catalano and the cinematography by Tat Radcliffe add immeasurably to the film. For those who appreciate challenging plots and superb writing this film will surely satisfy. Grady Harp, January 12",1325376000,,2220,4.824146981627297

4951672,4,B0064NLRG8,"Fans of Alfred Hitchcock and followers of the more recent ""Girl with a Dragon Tattoo"" series, would likely be pleased with this nail-biting psychological thriller from Italy, which delivers many unexpected twists during its 96 minutes of running time.

If suspense isn't your cup of tea but you enjoy art films with non-linear and unpredictable plots, you'll probably end up drinking the whole pot of this satisfying brainteaser from newcomer director Giuseppe Capotondi.

""The Double Hour"" is actually a love story between a lonely immigrant, Sonia (a chambermaid at a high-end hotel in Turin) and the also lonesome Guido, an ex-cop working as a security guard at an art dealer's estate. The two meet at a speed-dating event and just as they are beginning to fall in love, a crime happens, and their relationship is cut short.

But before that, during their first date, Guido looks at his watch, which marks 23:23, and he tells Sonia that it's a double hour and that she should make a wish. This detail early on, serves as a metaphor for the double life of the characters and the double storyline of the film you are about to embark on. And it's details such as this one that you need to pay attention to, because every one of them is important to decipher this riveting puzzler that won't let you get too comfortable in your seat.

Acted to perfection by Ksenia Rappoport and Filippo Timi ""The Double Hour"" is making its way quietly now through art-house theaters in the United States.  Don't miss it!",1307318400,12,1503,4.765384615384615

Any further discussion of the film would be a spoiler, so I'll just say that this move will fool you. The viewer doesn't know the reality until the conclusion, and it is a very well done ""film noir"". The performances are strong, and overall this is really good work.",1307318400,4,422,4.3544303797468356
4951674,5,B0064NLRG8,"Excellent in every conceivable way. What more can I say. Immensely satisfied with product. This film will undoubtedly be considered for an American remake. Too good a property not to be snatched up by the U.S. film industry, even though I can't imagine this original version  being bested in any way.",1285804800,6,300,4.882352941176471
4951677,5,B0064NLRG8,"this film swept the Venice film festival, won major awards, and is largely a buried treasure in the USA. i watched it on netflix streaming.

this film will keep you guessing until the end. it seems to cross every genre there is.  at first i thought it was a romance, then a crime drama, then a horror film.  it had me bouncing all over the place till close to the very end.  this is unusual for me.  so is is suspenseful? absolutely.

it starts off simply enough with Timi (a former cop and security guard) and Rappoport (a hotel maid and Slovenian immigrant). They meet at of all things a speed-dating event in Turin (i thought we were the country so romantically barbaric to do this grotesque new dating scheme so i was gratified to see this time we weren't alone in wearing the elvis suit, so to speak).  they start seeing one another until suddenly they are held up at gunpoint. the mood and pace change drastically after that and the fun is just beginning.

i'm not going to say anymore as it would ruin the fun.  this is a terrific film and i'm so glad i took a chance on it.

4951680,4,B0064NLRG8,"Now I know why many reviewers can't find enough words to praise a favorite author or actor.  After seeing her star in a movie for a second time, ""The Unknown Woman,"" Ksenia Rappoport has captured my attention as a very convincing and watchable actress.  In ""The Double Hour"" Ksenia does what she does best; leaves the audience guessing who she is, what she's up to, why she does what she does and how it'll all end up.

This movie seems more complicated than it actually is.  As with other movies starring Ksenia, you don't wanna miss one scene or you might find yourself searching at the end for that missing piece in order to make sense of it all. If ever there was an actor/actress who could stir audience emotion with just her eyes and body language, Ksenia is it. She tells the story more through her actions and expressions than with her voice. Alfred Hitchcock would've loved her.

Ksenia was not the only actor who put on a convincing performance.  The movie has a great supporting cast, including co-star Filippo Timi, who is as mysterious as they come.  For a movie that some might find slow and complicated with very little action, I simply could not pull myself away from it.  I took away one star for the times when the pace could've picked up just a bit, but overall I thought it a very entertaining film. Bravo!",1350432000,,1326,4.518828451882845
4951681,4,B0064NLRG8,"I watch movies for the same reason I read books because I like stories. And what I like most when watching/reading a story is to be surprised. That is why I don't like movies that are predictable. The ones you think you have already seen after watching the trailer. Or even worse after reading the title. Snakes on a Plane anybody?

The Double Hour is certainly not predictable. A mystery, a psychological thriller, a love story, all of the above?

The story starts with a shocking suicide and ends pretty. Or maybe not. It's that kind of movie.

The protagonist is Sonia (Ludovica Rampoldi) an Slovenian emigrant who works as a maid in a posh hotel in Turin and Guido (Alessandro Fabbri), an ex-cop she meets in a speed-dating event. They go out together a couple of times, then he takes her to his workplace, an impressive mansion where he works as a security guard. That is when things go wrong. There is a robbery, a gun is shot and the camera goes blank.

From then on the story goes psychologically strange as unexplainable things happen, and the story twists and turns keeping the viewer guessing.

The plot is complex but not confusing if you pay attention, and all fits neatly at the end, even if the last frame is not the picture you expected. Most probably not what Sonia herself wanted. But it makes sense within the movie.

As for the title, The Double Hour, it refers to those times that, like 23:23, the time the protagonists say good-bye the night they first meet, have a double number when read in digital.

Someone dear to Guido believed these double hours were lucky, he tells Sonia ""and you are supposed to make a wish, like you would when you see a shooting star.""

""Does it work?"" Sonia asks.

""No,"" says the pragmatic Guido.

But then, he goes ahead and makes his wish.

And we get our movie.",1345507200,2,1815,4.519877675840979
4951682,4,B0064NLRG8,"For my dollar, the ""rubber reality"" school of film making is one of the most significant genres happening today. Right up there with ""found footage"" films, there is still much to explore. While they tend to have a big punchline at the end, ""The Double Hour"" delivers said punchline fairly early in the third act then winds down quietly.

Here's the scoop. Sonia meets a guy, a good guy, at a speed dating session. He's a one time cop now working as security for a wealthy estate. He's with her at the estate one day when a heist team shows up and loots the place. She ends up with a bullet to the head and he's killed (sort of). She survives but begins having peculiar visions.

This is a well crafted movie. The writing, acting, directing and all other aspects of production are very tasty. Sonia has an arresting face. Her beau, Guido, might be more interesting looking than handsome but he looks good on screen. The two make a fine pair. The creep dial gets pushed up pretty far as she recovers from her head wound and starts to see and hear things that might not be there. Certain repeating motifs and other things that expand on earlier hints really kept me guessing. I guess the biggest surprise is that a particular angle of the story explored early on plays out just as it was alluded to. So now the audience needs to try and figure what could be left to tell. The truth is...not much. This will no doubt frustrate or tick off some viewers. But the ending is good. Not spectacular. Just good. No Hollywood sensibility here.

I can't say I liked this as much as ""The Jacket"" or ""The Machinist"" but it's a cool entry into the genre none the less.",1344470400,,1652,4.409836065573771
4951683,4,B0064NLRG8,"Having loved Rappoport in Tornatore's thriller ""La Sconosciuta"", I looked up and found this other thriller set in Turin by Capotondi. The director did an amazing job at keeping you confused and nevertheless intrigued with unexpected twists while you try to figure out Rappoport's character and intentions in this film about deception.

I am looking forward to watching more of Rappoport and Capotondi's films.",1341532800,,409,5.390625

4951685,5,B0064NLRG8,Excellent well constructed and electrifying thriller. You will not be able to guess what is going on for most of the film. There is a lot of film noir elements too.,1335571200,,164,4.32258064516129
4951686,3,B0064NLRG8,It's not a bad film; I just had a lot of distractions while watching it.  It is the kind of story that requires your complete attention the whole time. Things are not at all what they seem and neither are the people.,1332633600,2,216,4.142857142857143

8492699,3,B0064NLRG8,"Italian language film with English subtitles, revolving around a woman who works in housekeeping in a large hotel who attends a speed dating night and goes home with a guy who regularly attends but also like her doesn't seem to think the concept is that great.  They do the deed, he leads her to the door, she leaves and asks if she can call him which he agrees to, then bangs on the shut door telling him she didn't get his number.  He throws a tantrum, throws a bottle at the door, clearly he just was telling her what she wanted to hear to get laid.  Then suddenly they're together again and not long she's visiting him at work where he's a security guard (albeit not a great one). He turns off the alarms so they can go into the gardens which some guys with guns take advantage of to rob the mansion. He decides to be a hero and they both get shot with the same bullet.  She awakens in a hospital where the guy's cop friend starts hassling her and implying she was in on the job.  She is also seeing her lover on security cameras and in her house. She just wants him to leave her alone. Is he haunting her?  She isn't doing her housekeeping job well and can't really remember a lot of what went on.

Although the movie is supposed to have deliberate blindsides occurring for the viewer, thing like that I don't have your number scene just made no sense.  It's an okay film but not the great masterpiece type film some people are implying it is.",1473033600,,1448,4.259124087591241

8492702,4,B0064NLRG8,"The Double Hour is a clever film, one that draws you in through excellent acting and a labyrithinan plot. Sonia, a housekeeper at a hotel meets Guido at a speed dating session. The two enjoy a quick romance before he takes her out to see his job as a security specialist for a wealthy house. Then things go to pieces as the place is robbed, someone gets shot, and all bets are off. But who is telling the truth? What is dream and what is reality? We never know until we do and it's done very well. While some things are more obvious than others, it's a great film to watch as the emotional intensity is sustained throughout with character who leave us wondering whether or not they got what they wanted or if they wanted something else entirely. The ending was the only one that could have been, however, it could have used just a touch more drama. Still, a great film to enjoy.",1415750400,2,878,4.327272727272727
8492703,4,B0064NLRG8,"This twisty Italian thriller will keep you taut with anxiety.  It features a doozy of a twist about 2/3rds of the way through that will make you reconsider everything you thought you knew. It's pretty much impossible to discuss it without giving away the thrill of seeing it unfold, so I won't do that here.  [And hope that others won't as well.]

Leads Filippo Timi and Ksenia Rappoport are superb here. Rappoport talent is eye-opening...as are her arresting eyes.  It's an impressive performance considering she's Russian and only learned Italian for her 2006 appearance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Unknown-Woman/dp/B0026IQTQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Unknown Woman</a>.  Here, three years on, her Italian is fluent enough where her character only need be described as hailing from Ljubljana, where it's plausible she knows Italian albeit with an accent distinctive enough to raise a question about its provenance.

The performance to watch out for: Michele Di Mauro as Guido's (Timi's character) erstwhile colleague.  As Di Mauro states in the 'Making Of' featurette, he functions as Sonia's (Rappoport) conscience...but in a unique way that only a full viewing ought to reveal.",1407110400,,1241,5.823204419889502
8492704,4,B0064NLRG8,"Sad.  I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.  Is it riveting? No, so if you are expecting that type of movie, don't rent it. As a BBC type of mystery, it is excellent viewing.",1388102400,2,179,4.085714285714285
8492705,3,B0064NLRG8,Don't want to give anything away but the ending wasn't satisfactory.  I'll give it major points for keeping me on the edge of my seat though.,1375142400,,141,4.423076923076923
