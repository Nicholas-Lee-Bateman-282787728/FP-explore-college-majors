But it's so boring, it has no thrills, no scares, no entertainment, just shadows and faces of the boogieman that has too many stupid dream sequences... just avoid this garbage, there is nothing to enjoy for horror or thriller fans, it's main audience is just going to be those morons who flood message boards saying crap like, ""OMG, HE/SHES SO HOT, ID PRAISE THEM EVEN IF THEY WHERE VOTED THE WORST ACTOR OF ALL TIME, WHERE CAN I GET PICTURES OF THEM""",1248307200,5,609,4.342105263157895
3665128,5,B001KEHAE4,"I wasn't expecting a whole lot from Boogeyman 3, seeing as how I thought the first two were just average. However, Boogeyman 3 isn't average. It was way better than the first two in the series. It really reminded of a cross between A Nightmare on Elm Street and Urban Legend, but that doesn't mean it's a complete copycat. There is some originality and some decent scares, as well as inventive kills. Oh yeah, this movie doesn't really start off that way, but by the end it's a friggin' bloodbath. There's also some t&a, which I'm finding is making a comeback in horror movies, since My Bloody Valentine 3-D and Friday the 2009 also had the t and the a. Overall, I'd say check out Boogeyman 3. It's a real scream!",1246147200,5,713,4.450381679389313
3665129,1,B001KEHAE4,"If you've seen obviously red dyed water pouring down walls or out of some fixtures and a black cape from any Halloween costume display store then you've seen this movie many times before. Unless, I figure the following:
(1.) If you gave it 5 stars then this is the first horror movie you've ever seen (or you work for the studio).
(2.) If you gave it 4 stars then you once saw a horror movie in the 70s.
(3.) If you gave it 3 stars the you're Pollyanna's offspring and you are kind even to spiders and slugs.
Finally, since I watched Vacancy 2 the same day I conclude that I must not have a life.",1244073600,,596,4.146551724137931
3665130,3,B001KEHAE4,"There's really ""nothing to write home about"".  The story in this film is not all that.  There is nothing original here for sure, no surprises, nothing new from beginning to end.  I saw just what I was expecting from the opening credits to the close credits.  That all said, what I do like is the fact that they finally created a boogeyman character for us to see, with more than just a glimpse of him, and In my opinion he is a pretty cool looking creation.  The acting, sfx, cinematography, setting and atmosphere are really decent.  If you have a sort of obsession with this type of film as I do (I also liked the first and second of these), then you'll probably like this one.  Overall, I thought it was fairly good; Again, just don't look for anything original here.",1236816000,5,770,4.418439716312057

3665144,2,B001KEHAE4,"While the acting wasn't all bad in this, the simplistic storyline of a supernatural creature killing people from the beginning to the end and hanging it out there for another sequel at the end is really getting tiring.  Everyone wants a continuing series of movies and this means all you do is find new ways or unique ways to kill people and someway to end it so the killer can come back.  No originality, no real plots, just victims.  This is only worth looking at if you are hooked into the series concept, otherwise skip it.  You won't have missed anything.  Not even a good escapism piece.",1428710400,,593,4.5046728971962615

3665163,4,B001KEHAE4,"Released to video in 2008, Boogeyman 3 takes place at a university in Northern California, (although it was shot in Sofia in Western Bulgaria). Audrey (Nikki Sanderson), the daughter of Dr. Allen (Tobin Bell) from the previous film, is harassed by an unseen entity in her dorm, which she believes is the boogeyman, a malevolent spirit intent on killing as many as possible. Her best friend, Sarah (Erin Cahill), is a psych major who tries to help Audrey whereupon she catches a frightening glimpse of the boogeyman and people start mysteriously dying. Sarah tries to warn everyone in the dorm to GET OUT.

Like Boogeyman 2, this third installment in the low-budget series is limited by its one-dimensional setting -- about half the movie was shot at a dull dorm lobby and the rest in rooms nearby, plus a couple outside scenes. As such, the characters and their story HAVE to work or the movie will bomb. The results are not great, but its marginally better than the previous film, largely due to a decent assortment of females and the great look of the boogeyman himself (itself?) -- it appears as a tall thin man with long scraggly hair, a black gown and a hideous face.

As far as the female cast goes, Cahill is solid as the protagonist and Sanderson is effective as Dr. Allens daughter. There are a couple of other quality females on hand, including cameos.

Being a horror-on-campus film, its reminiscent of the two Decoys movies and Urban Legends: Final cut, so if you like those types of films you might like Boogeyman 3, but  to me  its the least of these. Like I said, the setting is too one-dimensional, but there are other flaws. For instance, most of the male characters are weak, with the exception of Sarahs psych professor from the radio show, and the blood that flows down walls and fills the floors looks more like cherry Icee fluid than actual blood.

Still, Boogeyman 3 delivered just enough for me to give it a weak thumbs up. Aside from the women and the look of the boogeyman, I like the angle that the monster feeds on peoples belief to manifest in the physical realm, as well as the Christ figure at the end.

The film  runs 94 minutes.

3665167,5,B001KEHAE4,"Boogeyman 3 opens with Dr. Mitchell Allen's (Tobin Bell) daughter, Audrey (Nikki Sanderson). Audrey proceeds to take a shower and while doing so sees a hand with a black glove. Scared, Audrey gets out and goes to her room to sleep. Her dog, however is up and wants to play ball. To get him away she throw the ball in the closet, After a while, she gets worried her dog hasn't come back yet. She walks to the closet and finds blood lining the closet. She backs away and, with a scream, gets pulled, under her bed.

Sarah Morris (Erin Cahill) is a student who is doing a radio show for her college radio station where she tries to help people with their problems, such as a guy just breaking up with his girlfriend. Soon after she is introduced, Audrey arrives in Sarah's room at night, raving that ""He`s everywhere"". Sarah lets her stay the night. During Sarah's radio show the next day, Audrey calls to tell Sarah and Dr. Kane about the Boogeyman. They don't believe her, but Sarah leaves, thinking she is suicidal while Dr. Kane remains with her on the phone. The Boogeyman then begins to strangle Audrey when Sarah arrives. When others arrive to see it, Audrey appears to have hanged herself.

Soon after, Sarah discovers the diary amongst Audrey's things. She begins to believe the Boogeyman is real and tries to warn her friends and boyfriend, David (Chuck Hittinger). They refuse to believe her thinking she is dealing with the trauma of her friend dying soon after her mother`s death. Her friends in the dorm begin to disappear, Sarah having visions of their deaths through being pulled into the alternate world of the Boogeyman. People refuse to believe her claims but campus talk of the Boogeyman from hearing her radio show continues to swirl. Sarah begins to believe the Boogeyman gains his power from the legend continuing by people believing he might be real. Dr. Kane begins to worry about her mental stability.

Sarah takes over the radio station to emergency warn the students away, prompting her arrest by campus security. While held in custody, Dr. Kane negotiates her release until the body of Sarah's friend Lindsey is found in a washer. Sarah realizes Dr. Kane actually is beginning to believe when they both witness a light manifestation of the Boogeyman. Dr. Kane, trying to prove she is wrong, enters the room where the light is, and is subsequently beaten to death by the Boogeyman. Sarah then realizes the Boogeyman has been using her fear to warn everyone in order to get everyone to believe in him.

Sarah rushes back to her room to save David who now believes her story and has been reading the diary. She finds him staring off into a black closet, but is unable to prevent the Boogeyman from pulling him in. David is soon-after flung out into the room, disemboweled, covering her in blood. The police and students arrive to find the scene. To prevent the Boogeyman's growth in power, Sarah claims she committed all the murders herself and that the Boogeyman is not real. One of the officers in the elevator reveals he doesn't believe she could have done that by herself. She insists that she did, but the elevator stops and she is pulled up into the elevator shaft by the Boogeyman with the two police officers staring in disbelief as Sarah's cries for help fade away.

One year later, two Freshmen are staying in Sarah's room. One interrupts the other's studies to tell her the story of the ""crazy girl"" who thought the Boogeyman was real that lived in the room a year ago. It is revealed the college changed the dorm name to keep people from being afraid to move in. The studying girl leaves to go to the library for some peace, noticing that the other seems actually scared to be alone and taunting her as she leaves. Left alone, the other girl is soon attacked and dragged beneath her bed to an unknown fate.

I can't belive that Shara is killed by the boogeyman ! SHe is like the one how protects the other students & she is the one who dies !",1326931200,,3977,4.594366197183098
3665168,5,B001KEHAE4,"The price for this dvd is fantastic, for the amount you get for it.  I've seen this in stores for like $20.  How can you go wrong?",1309651200,,130,3.7777777777777777
3665169,2,B001KEHAE4,"The first Boogeyman film had some great ideas in it, but to get to them you had to sit through seemingly endless, dull scenes.  The second film was like a throwback to 70s and 80s psycho killer films where you are kept guessing the killer's identity to the end.  It threw out the supernatural elements of the first film, and involved a series of creative murders, each tailored to a mental asylum's inmate's (strangely enough, all teens) particular phobias, and while it wasn't great at least I didn't feel cheated sitting through it.  This third film takes the supernatural creature of the first film, combines that with the serial killings of the second, and throws out anything that was interesting about those two films in the process.  As per hundreds of post-Scream horror films that featured dumb teens, no nudity and minimal violence, Boogeyman 3 inexplicably takes all the cliches covered in that film, presents them seriously, and manages to make them even duller than when they were pre-Scream cliches, all apparently packaged for 12-14 year olds.  You get the usual gaggle of dull, insipid characters getting killed off in boring, repetitious manners (this time in the oft-used setting of a university dorm) one after the other while making dumb choices.  There are no surprises, no suspense, no thrills, nothing, not even any tasteless exploitation.  If I had something better to do during the particular night I watched this I would have felt even more ripped off and probably given this one star.",1296000000,,1511,4.948616600790514

3665171,4,B001KEHAE4,This is the third boogeyman movie and it's still fresh. I like this one and the second way more than the first movie.

3665172,5,B001KEHAE4,If you liked Boogeman 1 or 2 you will like this movie too. I would suggest this movie to any horror fan. The story is pretty good. It also has pretty good acting and special effects. I own all 3 movies. And enjoy watching them evertime!,1268524800,,236,4.1521739130434785
8314798,3,B001KEHAE4,"This sequel begins by revising the previous films outcome and then changing the attitude of the dead doctor Mitchell (Tobin Bell).  Trying to have it both ways, they blame the previous murders on a deranged killer, and then they have the resolute doctor leave behind a convenient diary that indicates that he did believe in the boogeyman and that his clinic was filled with a presence that all the staff and patients felt.  This is to set up the new premise, making the boogeyman a semi-corporeal spirit who can appear anywhere at any time and sometimes in several places at the same time.  He has substance and then he doesnt.  It all depends on the lazy writer who didn't want to abide by any rules governing fantasy figures.  Holding a grudge, the REAL boogeyman goes after the dead doctors daughter.  She is college bound and not long for this world.  The boogeyman goes coed and attacks a dorm.  He targets an impressionable student named Sarah (Erin Cahill) with a past of mental instability.  She spends most of the movie trying to convince people that the boogeyman is real and out to get her.  In essence, she acts as his press agent promoting his presence on campus.  Supposedly, this emboldens the flickering menace to go on a rampage, killing students in a messy cumbersome fashion.

Most of the horror is on the basic level of jump-scares.  There is nothing original, nothing new in the filmmakers approach to the subject matter.  But it is entertaining enough to satisfy most fans.",1498348800,,1495,4.744186046511628
