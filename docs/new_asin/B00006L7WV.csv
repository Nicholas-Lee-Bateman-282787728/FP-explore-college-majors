1783521,4,B00006L7WV,"This is the Silent Screen Horror Classics Double Feature of perhaps two of the best horror classics of the silent cinema:""Nosferatu"" (1922) and ""Phantom Of The Opera"" which is released by Diamond Entertainment. This double-feature disc contains not only the two films,but also has great bonus features such as the Facts & Trivia about ""Phantom"" star Lon Chaney Sr. and ""Nosferatu"" director,the late F.W. Murnau. The Photo stills gallery is mostly composed of still screen shots of the two movies and the great part is that both films have been digitally remastered from the best availible film sources! So-so classical musical score is used for ""Phantom Of The Opera"" while ""Nosferatu"" contains a good organ score (w/the opening titles set to Bach's ""Tacotta Fugue"".).But be warned,the back of the box for this DVD says that ""Phantom Of The Opera"" is in both B&W and Color,but when watch that film,the ENTIRE film is in black & white including the two-color masque ball sequence. Nevertheless,it's a great DVD and recommended for any DVD collection! Cheers to Diamond Entertainment for making this DVD worth watchable!",1054339200,2,1118,5.148351648351649

7970963,1,B00006L7WV,The music used in Nosferatu was repetitious and destroyed the whole atmosphere of the film.,1431302400,,91,5.133333333333334

7970966,1,B00006L7WV,"Diamond Entertainment should be ashamed. I recently found a copy of this DVD for a cheap price, so I bought it. Little did I know I'd be getting a cheap DVD. The print of Phantom of the Opera is an unusually grainy one, even for this film. In some scenes, particularly the scene where Christine awakens in the Phantom's lair, the print is so dark it is difficult to see.
  Another important item missing from this print is the two-strip technicolor Bal Masque scene, which, coming from a 1927 film, is powerful stuff.
  In addition, the company has tried to make the DVD more interesting by inserting some random facts from the film's history. This would be fine, except that many of them are incorrect, for instance, Lon Chaney died in 1930, making only one film with sound. The DVD insists that Lon Chaney was an actor who was able to transition to the sound format!
  The worst part, however, is the fact that the original organ music, so crucial to the original film, has been replaced with an entirely inappropriate orchestral score. The new score was not written for the film, so the dramatic tension of the original is completely lost.
  Don't buy this copy. The double feature may lure you, but the movies themselves are poorly presented, anc superior versions can be purchased.",1073260800,19,1286,4.684444444444445
7970967,3,B00006L7WV,Ahem!  The cover of the box is The Phantom of Hammer's 1962 version.  This is not Lon Chaney.  This IS Herbert Lom.,1062201600,7,115,4.136363636363637
7970968,4,B00006L7WV,"This is the Ultimate Silent Screen Horror Double Feature DVD release from Diamond Entertainment featuring two of the silent era's classic horror films ""Nosferatu"" (1922) and ""The Phantom Of The Opera"" (1925).Both films have been digitally remastered from the best availible film sources and have been correctly timed at its right projection speed! ""The Phantom Of The Opera""s
musical score consists of a great classical music theme while ""Nosferatu""s musical accompainement has a terrific organ score (the opening titles are set to the theme of Bach's 'Tocotta Fugue').While both films have excellent scores,there is one minor catch. The back of the box reads that ""Phantom Of The Opera"" is both in Color and Black & White,but the entire movie is in Black & White including the Color Masque-Ball sequence! There is also cool extras such as the Facts and Trivia in which it has biographies on ""Phantom"" star,the legendary Lon Chaney Sr. and ""Nosferatu"" director F.W. Murnau. The Photo Gallery consists of freeze-framed images from the two films. Although this ain't the greatest double-feature DVD of all time,this set is a definite must-see and is also worth the cheap money! Cheers to Diamond Entertainment for putting out this excellent DVD release!!",1054771200,3,1252,5.233830845771144
