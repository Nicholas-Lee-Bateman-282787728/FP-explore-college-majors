2416136,1,B000BGQUEI,"Equal number of 1 star ratings to 5 stars makes it even more obvious than it usually is that the 5 stars are FAKED by film producers and/or friends of the cast.
Amazon should do away with ratings and require all films to offer a Preview to let viewers spot the ""Stinkers"" themselves.",1402704000,3,283,4.3584905660377355
2416137,1,B000BGQUEI,"Beartooth, was not at all to my liking. The script and acting was very poor. The photo of the cover of the movie was not related at all. It was terrible. I would not even rate it a 1 star. It was awful.",1391731200,5,202,3.7209302325581395
2416138,5,B000BGQUEI,I have seen this before and knew what to expect.  I know Buck Taylor and he is such a Gentleman that I am trying to get everything with him in.,1370390400,,143,3.7666666666666666
2416139,3,B000BGQUEI,The video quality is poor. Not a great movie but I purchased it because of a personal connection to the filming.,1366329600,,112,4.380952380952381
2416140,5,B000BGQUEI,"Anyone who knows/loves Westerns, know the the names ""Dub Taylor & Buck Taylor""! These two men are highly regarded in the Western Movie Industry, and have acted with the best of the best, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Sam Elliot, etc., etc.. Hardly a Western out there that doesn't have one or both of these guys in it! If you're expecting a fancy movie, with special effects, and ""all that"" here, you're not going to see it.
What you will see is an honest, down to Earth good movie, lots of Mountain scenery, animals, and just the everyday life of living in the Mountains out West! Reminds me of the area I live in here in Wyoming, and going to the Saloon in town! It's an older movie for sure, and maybe not all that well put together, but I find it extremely interesting. Just give it a chance, and you'll see what I mean. Dub Taylor is just ""himself"" in this movie, that's the way he is in the movies, even if John Wayne were there next to him. He is, was, and always will be a character........",1365033600,2,996,4.303191489361702
2416141,1,B000BGQUEI,"I don't know what to say but the movie doesn't look like a movie being released in 2009, maybe Amazon uploaded the wrong movie or something. It looks like a old movie from 80s and tell the story about an old man who lives alone in the moutain with bears and many other wild animals, there isn't any survival story. Feeling like be tricked and lost 1.99 bucks for nothing.",1329868800,3,371,4.314285714285714
2416142,4,B000BGQUEI,"Interesting character study of a man who's faced with the one thing he has wanted to get away from. Living alone in the mountains during a brutal, possibly deadly, blizzard is dangerous but when a stranger stranded outside in the horrible storm knocks on your door what do you do? Let an unwelcome stranger into your home or succumb to the brutal wilderness?",1291939200,,358,4.698412698412699
2416143,1,B000BGQUEI,"I saw this ""movie"" in the base theater on the Navy base on Guam back in 1979. It cost a quarter to get into the show and I wanted my money back even then. Ever since then, I have used this as the pinnacle a crappy movies. Whenever I see a bad movie I say ""Wow, that sucked but it wasn't as bad as 'Beartooth'. There doesn't seen to be a plot. The camera just follows a mountain man around as he does his chores. The acting is so wooden that Pinocchio would cringe to see it and the director must have use Directing for Dummies by Uwe Bolle but left out all the explosions. The cinematography isn't that bad considering it was apparently shot on Super 8. All in all, save your money and your sanity and give this one a pass.",1206230400,17,723,4.062937062937063

2416164,1,B000BGQUEI,"First of all, it states in Amazon that it's a 2009 film, when in reality it's mid 70's, the very low budget kind. It might have been released to video on 2009, but this is misinforation. The transfer is terrible, but it doesn't matter because the film is terrible, with long, long sequences of nothing happening to the soundtrack of the most cheesy western music ever. EVER! The acting is bad, and so is the direction, and of course the incessant banjo, harmonica, hillbilly music will drive you crazy. The box cover is misleading also, in a big way! It's not the money for renting this movie that I regret, it's the time I wasted. I will do more research on IMBD before renting again. This film is appropriate for misbehaving students as a punishment...",1428796800,4,754,4.592592592592593

8086471,4,B000BGQUEI,"Beartooth is a movie that you have to like the synopsis of, before you watch it, to actually enjoy it.  It doesn't have a great story line, but I like Dub Taylor and the outdoor scenes of such movies, make them worth the time, to connect with.  If you don't like it, I can understand, but if you give it a look, you might get hooked on it.  The plot does have a nice ending.",1453852800,,374,3.96
