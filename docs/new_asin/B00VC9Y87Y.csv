7087570,5,B00VC9Y87Y,"You will love this movie.  It can stand alone, but I highly recommend making a batch of potcorn and binge-watch the trilogy!  :)  Be prepared to laugh out loud, shake your head, pick your jaw up off the floor, and then laugh some more while you meet the characters who hike the Appalachian Trail.",1430092800,,296,4.444444444444445
7087571,5,B00VC9Y87Y,"For those of you about to set out on the AT...this is a must see! It's a fantastic cross section of the crazy awesome ridiculous adventure that you will be so lucky to call life!
For those of us that have thru-hiked the AT...Squatch's documentaries will take you right back to that year you hiked the AT (the year you will never forget) and allow you to re-live the adventure. Pretty sure I had a permanent smile while watching this entire film :)
Fantastic to have met you Squatch...feeling very lucky to have a spot in your film, and thank you so much for doing what you do :)!!

7087572,5,B00VC9Y87Y,"Scott Herriot's 3rd amazing movie about his and others hike on the Appalachian Trail! His humor, trials and interactions with the other hikers are the best!  The high definition filming really makes you feel you are there hiking along with them. We have all three of his AT movies and watch them over and over. These movies really give you an experience of the trail. I highly recommend anyone who has hiked the AT, are thinking about hiking it or who are getting ready to hike it watch these movies.  We had the pleasure of meeting Scott at Trail Days in Damascus last year and believe me he is just as awesome, personable and funny in person!  Thank you Scott (Squatch) and congratulations for finally completing the trail!

7087573,5,B00VC9Y87Y,Scott Herriott is my favorite documentary maker!  Fun and inspiring!  Hope he keeps hiking...maybe on the CDT.,1429488000,2,110,5.411764705882353
7087574,5,B00VC9Y87Y,"A triumphant success story about completing the Appalachian Trail in the most flip flopped manner possible.  Squatch's filming of his own (mis)adventures are d@mn funny on their own, but he also highlights many other amazingly funny hikers who are also real people on a real adventure of a lifetime.  While dying of laughter from the hilarious antics and discoveries of hikers that have maybe been in the woods for too long, I was also deeply moved by the story of the family hiking together, the health related obstacles that some hikers, including Squatch, overcame, and the rugged beauty of the AT.  Also, it was cool to be in the movie for a few seconds and to have met a handful of other hikers in the film!  Squatch did an excellent job of capturing the essence of the journey in a way that is rewarding for thru hikers, day hikers, prospective hikers, and non-hikers alike.

7087575,5,B00VC9Y87Y,Another success!  I love Scott Herriott's movies. Flip Flop Flipped takes you on an adventure of a true hikers experience of the Appalachian Trail. Whimsical and beautiful. You'll want to pack your backpack after this one.,1428105600,3,222,5.166666666666667
7087576,4,B00VC9Y87Y,Scott is a good writer and a funny guy. His stories will take you out there to the AT where you want to be. I bought the book because I needed to go there in my head. Thanks Scott.,1466208000,,180,3.641025641025641

7087580,5,B00VC9Y87Y,"Since I am pretty sure I would never get the urge to actually hike this whole thing, this could be the next best thing to it.  I was a lot of fun to watch. Many interesting people, beautiful scenery, even some wild life. (Of the animal species type as well as humans;)).  Do recommend if you want something to just kind of help you mellow out.",1453507200,,343,4.181818181818182

7087582,5,B00VC9Y87Y,"When my son was in the Boy Scouts, I hiked with the troop 60 miles on the AT in North Carolina. While we didn't encounter the eclectic hikers Scott Herriot did in the short time we were on the trail, we did meet some real characters including some FBI agents ""disguised"" as hikers (some of their equipment still had tags) who were looking for the Unabomber.

This is a humorous, fun look at the thru hikers of the AT near Katahdin.  My favorite was ""Cartwheel"" a young girl thru hiking with her parents and older brother.  Her enthusiasm was infectious.",1449100800,,553,4.51
7087583,5,B00VC9Y87Y,"Good flick, with great insight to life on the trail!",1448841600,,52,4.3
7087584,5,B00VC9Y87Y,"Good hike flick.  I like this one and the 1st one, not so much the 2nd one.  Good hearted display of trail characters.  If you're looking for Hollywood cinematography, then look elsewhere.  If you like real humans living and sharing a real adventure together, then give it a whirl.  The 5 stars is based off the type of film it is...a small budget trail life expose'.",1447804800,,367,4.5

I watched because a friend said to.  If you are into very odd off-the-grid people and enjoyed Wild, you'll like this.",1443139200,,154,4.5
7087587,5,B00VC9Y87Y,"The best AT documentary out there.  From the people, the places, and especially the sounds (oh my the sounds!,) this is a wonderfully sentimental and authentic capture of the Appalachian Trail.

I'm grateful this work was completed.",1442016000,,232,5.243243243243243
7087588,5,B00VC9Y87Y,"I had the pleasure of spending an evening on the trail with Scott in Killington,VT during the filming of Flip Flop Flipped and recently watched the film (as well as the other films in Scott's Flip Flop series). Highly enjoyable and would recommend to anyone with an interest hiking/backpacking. Definitely made me want to hit the trail again after watching it! Looking forward to Scott's future works!",1439251200,,401,5.0

7087590,5,B00VC9Y87Y,"I love all of Scott's hiking documentaries, both the Appalachian trail ones and the Pacific Crest trail ones.  I've wanted to do this for years but wondered now that my daughter is old enough how to get her on board with this.  After watching this with me she's ready as well and we are making plans for 2017 spring.",1436745600,,316,4.338983050847458
7087591,2,B00VC9Y87Y,"I like the idea here, but the film totally made me motion sick (on a small TV). Way too much shaky camera, especially at the end when Herriott wore the camera on his head and turned quickly amongst person to person in the group he was talking to.",1434758400,,246,4.145833333333333

8709804,5,B00VC9Y87Y,"Very well done, an insiders look into a thru hike on the AT. Not scripted, it brings you along as a companion on this adventure, sometimes a misadventure, but that is what is to be expected on a thru hike. Unable to hike, or even walk much anymore, I enjoyed being able to tag along on this hike, it brought me peace and enjoyment. For me it is one of those documenteries that I have watched several times already, bringing me to a place I long to be. Thanks for letting me tag along.",1522022400,,484,4.159574468085107
