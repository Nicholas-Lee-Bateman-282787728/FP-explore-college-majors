8442677,4,B004V2FUQ2,I am a great fan of Raj Kumar. And this movie is as good as other movies of him. Also if you get bonus of Jeetendera (another favorite of mine) and the evergreen Mala Sinha. All the three main actors perform their role in an immaculate manner and I could not find any discrepancy in their performances. The music is also good from Shanker-Jai Kishan. Eastman Colors look very cool. And another different end to a love triangle never seen in any other Hindi movie. Vinod Kumar has done a good job in directing such a wonderful movie. Acting from other crew was also good. Story is about two men falling in love to a woman and one of them managing to marry her and then losing her due to his own deeds. And then the other man managing to get her respect even though he was not able to win her heart in the first place. Recommended from my side to everyone.,1305849600,,854,4.245398773006135
