So if you're hoping for a movie about chess, look elsewhere.

The movie itself seems quite good, interesting and entertaining, if often melodramatic. Two friends, one Japanese and one Chinese, play a game of Go.  The Japanese master convinces the Chinese master to send his talented son to Japan with him, to study at what was then the center of Go playing.

Nearly as soon as the son is gone, the Japanese invade China, and the two lose all contact with one another. The film then follows the fortunes of both families as the war progresses.

The film was a Chinese/Japanese collaborative project, and this version comes from China, which I suspect as the root of the problems with the release. The English subtitles are not very good, but they are at least understandable. I've seen MUCH worse. The fact that Go is referred to as 'chess' and the go stones as 'chessmen' is an annoyance to Go players everywhere, I should think. It bugged me, anyway.

But the really big problem with the release is this: since it is partly in Chinese and partly in Japanese, there is a constant VOICEOVER in Chinese through the entire film! Not sure, but I believe there are only two narrators, one male and one female, voicing over the actors, with little expression in their voices.  It would be understandable if this was done only during the Japanese parts, but the voiceover carries on through the Chinese parts, so that in effect the narrator is simply repeating everything the actors say, but in a much flatter voice. It pretty much ruins the performances of the actual actors.

A friend asked me why I hadn't simply turned the sound off entirely, since there were subtitles, and I frankly wish I had thought of it. So here's my advice to you: you may want to consider watching this with the sound turned off. Of course, you won't get the score or the benefit of the real actors' performances (muted under the voiceover track) but you will save yourself annoyance.

Still, this seems to be the only release of The Go Masters currently (or possibly ever) available in the USA, so if you really want to see it, go for it.",1342828800,7,2222,4.628498727735369
