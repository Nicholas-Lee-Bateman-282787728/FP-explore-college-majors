2656684,2,B000IHYXS0,"I own all of Elvis' DVD's and I welcomed another to my collection.  I read the reviews on amazon, and bought this DVD.  What a disapointment.  You are better off buying the original DVD performances.  I felt the whole DVD was just showing the band, not Elvis.  The shots keep going to the singers, and the musican's and Elvis third.  If you were there for the live performance of this concert event in Memphis, then I am sure it was more enjoyable b/c you could keep your eyes just on the Elvis screen.  They also were shown photos and clips on the side screen, which we could not see.  If we were able to see photos and clips of Elvis then it would have been better.

No disrespect to the band members or the singers, they did a great job, but I came to see Elvis not the band.",1178236800,6,778,4.167785234899329
2656685,3,B000IHYXS0,"In the first few minutes of this DVD, I thought this was going to rank right up there with ""That's The Way It Is: Special Edition"" or ""ELVIS: '68 Comeback Special-Deluxe Edition"" but disappointment soon set in.

You see, there's a nice bonus feature (38 minutes) where Ronnie Tutt, Joe Guercio, and Joe Moscheo tell some great stories about their experiences with Elvis, as well as the making of this show. Gordon Stoker from the Jordanaires is there, too, but seems more interested in keeping the spotlight on himself. Anyway, it's a cool bonus feature...but...

They have also spliced portions of this reminiscing segment into the actual concert! And not just between songs (as was done with the original ""That's The Way It Is"") but DURING songs! It's horribly distracting and for me nearly ruins what could have been such a wonderful DVD.

The 1973 Aloha footage blends so nicely with the 2002 concert footage that the illusion can take you in very easily. It seems like Elvis is there with them!

Unfortunately, they used some really low-quality video footage for the ""That's The Way It Is"" segments. Much better video quality exists for the ""That's The Way It Is"" performances, such as on the Special Edition version, so I'm not sure why a somewhat blurry source is used here. This takes away from the illusion a bit, but not nearly as bad as people interrupting to talk in the middle of a song.

A few of the Elvis performances on this DVD are not officially available elsewhere on DVD. They are 1970's ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" (cut from ""That's The Way It Is: Special Edition"" DVD)--somewhat ruined by an interruption as described above, 1970's ""Walk A Mile In My Shoes"" (available only on ""Elvis: The Lost Performances"" VHS), and 1972's ""How Great Thou Art"" (also available only on ""Elvis: The Lost Performances"" VHS)--interrupted for Stoker to tell a myth.

Here's the full track listing of the concert portion:

Aloha 1973

1.) Also Sprach Zarathustra (2001)

2.) See See Rider

3.) Burning Love

4.) Welcome To My World

5.) I Can't Stop Loving You

6.) Steamroller Blues

7.) Johnny B. Goode (has a cool bit of extended ""live"" solos but they of course interrupt it to explain this)

8.) You Gave Me A Mountain

Vegas 1970

9.) That's All Right

10.) You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'

11.) Mystery Train/Tiger Man

12.) Just Pretend

13.) Are You Lonesome Tonight? (including ""...do you gaze at your bald head and wish you had hair..."")

14.) Walk A Mile In My Shoes

15.) In The Ghetto

16.) Polk Salad Annie

17.) Bridge Over Troubled Water

18.) The Wonder Of You

19.) Suspicious Minds

Aloha 1973

20.) I'll Remember You

21.) A Big Hunk O' Love

22.) My Way

23.) How Great Thou Art - Hampton, VA 1972

24.) If I Can Dream - The Comeback 1968

Aloha 1973

25.) An American Trilogy

26.) Can't Help Falling In Love

This is a great show and must be something to see live (especially since the songs won't be interrupted). All of the performances here, from Elvis to the band to the background vocalists, are top-notch. The sound is usually wonderful.

I could have lived with interruptions between songs, but not during them. Instead of being a DVD I'd play several times a year, I'll probably play this once every couple years as a novelty. A real shame, as this kind of release is not likely to get a redo.",1176508800,106,3325,4.639794168096055
2656686,3,B000IHYXS0,"It's great to see all the original performers in real time, but there is no comparison to the original 'Aloha' concert",1176422400,8,118,4.666666666666667
2656687,5,B000IHYXS0,"If you ever cared for Elvis music, this is a must have. You will be amazed at what technololgy has provided us with this DVD.",1176163200,,125,4.04
2656688,4,B000IHYXS0,"This is a reunion of Elvis Presley's 1970's band playing live in concert with The King on the big screen singing the vocals.  On this night the old group, orchestra and back-up singers including the 1950's Jordanaires deliver a powerful performance.  The featured musician is guitarist James Burton who is ON.  Collectively they keep right in time which is not an easy task when the singer is not really present.  The 5.1 channel surround sound brings Elvis Presley to the 2000's.  The high point is the moving ballad ""American Trilogy"".  The film clips are taken from his Hawaii concert, Las Vegas shows, ""1968 Comeback Special"" (""If I Can Dream"") and ""On Tour"".  The live audience in Memphis is up for the occasion.  However this DVD is not for everyone.  The camera shots hold on his band only 1 to 3 seconds average time showing them also in the 1970's and this 1997 concert.  Elvis the star gets mixed in between on the big screen at the show and in full format.  The presentation comes off like an MTV video concert.  Being a fan of Elvis since the 1950's, I own numerous Presley live DVD/Videos.  I would rank ""Elvis Lives"" fifth behind in order: ""1968 Comeback Special Deluxe"", ""That's The Way It Is"", ""Aloha Deluxe"" and ""Elvis 56"".  It makes for a good addition for established Presley fans who can handle the quick shot format and younger fans who embrace these type presentations.  ""Elvis Lives"" is a spirited tribute to his last decade not his whole career.  Rockabilly purists would best begin with Presley's 1950's live CD's/DVD's before purchasing this show because the only driving ""Sun"" rocker on this set is the medley ""Mystery Train/Tiger Man"".",1175990400,28,1663,4.782456140350877

2656691,5,B000IHYXS0,"This DVD is Awesome: The production is fantastic:

It crosses from shots of Elvis & his entourage from previous performances all those years ago to them performing live on stage in 1997 with Elvis up on the Big Screen makes it so very real as if he is actually there live on stage:

The Camera work, musical blending leaves you feeling as if you are in the very front Row and Elvis is singing to only you!

Its  a must have for any Elvis Fans collection:  I was actually present at that concert in the Pyramid Coliseum in 1997 it was mind blowing then and this Dvd is just as mind blowing for any devoted Elvis Fan",1159315200,41,614,4.213675213675214

2656744,1,B000IHYXS0,"While the audience for Elvis continues to expand world-wide, this particular product was tested in a variety of consumer DVD reproductor/players, and independently verified & validated to contain only one subtitling track (English), with four closed caption tracks (one being English), after deep-inspection by computer workstation.  It quite simply does NOT support the six non-English languages indicated on product packaging, and is a genuine disappointment for the estate & legacy of Elvis Presley.

It must have taken months and months to find everyone, then arrange to have them get all together to do the rehearsing, and then the actual recording.  We bought 2 copies because we will ALWAYS be able to enjoy it, and the 2nd copy we can ""share"" with family and friends who also are big Elvis fans!

I like the method they used to make the concert and am happy with the sound quality of it.  There are a few items that I am a little negative about, that being the commentary during songs and the cutaways showing the artists/musicians then and now were too quick and short to register.  One complaing I have about the songs is that my favorite Elvis song is ""I can't help falling in Love With You""  The version on this disk is too short.

In my mind he will always be the KING..... bar none!!",1348704000,,378,3.986842105263158

2656842,1,B000IHYXS0,"My #1 distraction is view/listen concerts. Have in my home almost 200 hundreds of them. And I get so frustrated when someone interrupts a song just to say how wonderful the recording was, and how marvelous the engineering got, or to explain the technique used in a specific moment.  People, you can say those things in the special features, not in the middle of the song. Or allow the spectators to see the concert without those verbal's notes.
It is true that they did a very good job remastering the sound and Elvis never sing so good, but when you express all those things interrupting the show, it's really annoying.
Not recommended for a real concert fan.",1315526400,5,660,4.641025641025641
2656843,5,B000IHYXS0,This is a must have for any Elvis fan.  I especially like the fact it has all of the original band and back up singers.  Very nicely done.  Also very nostalgic.,1290297600,,160,4.096774193548387

Wanted the whole concert on DVD, but I received the wrong 'Region' DVD.  I am told it will be replaced, but nothing yet after a month.  Still hoping  for the best.  If you order any DVD, in the States we are Region 1.",1284249600,,366,4.217391304347826
2656845,5,B000IHYXS0,This is a great DVD that shows the Elvis Lives Concert in all its glory. The original band that played with Elvis are back to play one last show with Elvis through his previously recorded concerts. It's amazing how these musicians have been able to play as Elvis sings as if he's singing live. This is a great DVD for any Elvis fan.,1262995200,,332,4.285714285714286

I purchased this DVD for my husbands 64th birthday. We were so pleased. If you love Elvis you will definitely enjoy this DVD. The music and backround are great and the interviews with the original player who were with Elvis during these different songs and concerts made it really come to life.

2656861,5,B000IHYXS0,"I,like many others, did not have the pleasure of seeing Elvis live on stage.  The biggest let down of my life!!!  I highly reccomend ""Elvis Lives"" because it is the closest you will ever come to seeing what it was like to see Elvis, live on stage.  Everyone on stage does a great job bringing him back to life.  If you are not a fan, you will be after watching this and if you are a fan, watching this will bring you to ""TEARS"" !!!!  I have been a fan of Elvis since 1956.",1199145600,3,472,3.978723404255319

2656863,1,B000IHYXS0,"Unfortunately I was never able to view this DVD. I received it and it would not play on any of our 3 DVD players. It was a PAL version and was not regionally coded to play in the US. I live in California and have never had any problem with any DVD ordered from Amazon. So I returned it after speaking with a Customer Service rep and hoped that this was an isolated problem. Not so. I ordered a replacement and received the same product-PAL written on the reverse and when placed in the DVD, it said ""this DVD will not play on this machine"".So I returned that one too and will just have to wait for PBS to play the show again.
Has anyone else had this problem, and if so, did you get it resolved? If so, I would appreciate your help.

I know this is one of those that will get played and played and played. Some of the tracks were so thrilling it was like discovering Elvis all over again. GO for this one if your a fan of the King.
