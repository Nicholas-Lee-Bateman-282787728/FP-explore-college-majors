8320674,5,B001M6SH4C,"We were introduced to Noddy and Friends on the Sprout channel, which no longer airs the British show. Our then 2-yr old daughter fell in love the first time she saw it. Even our 8-month old triples (2 boys and a girl) took notice of the show when it was on the TV. Our children are 3- and 4-yrs old now and still love Noddy. The stories are ~ 11 mins long each, and all are educationally based on social situations like sharing, good vs naughty behavior, cooperation, telling the truth, and even counting. The DVDs also have a 2-minute segment in between each story called Say It With Noddy, during which the children are introduced to foreign languages and sounds not normally spoken in the English language. This helps with learning other languages later in life. Each DVD holds 5 stories and 5 foreign language learning opportunities. The animation and colors are outstanding. The characters are engaging and easy for the young to identify with. We highly recommend these fun DVDs - even the adults enjoy watching with the kids.",1356739200,,1031,4.701657458563536
