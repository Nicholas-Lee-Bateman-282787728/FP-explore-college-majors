8620450,5,B00G3LP7XK,"What an amazing DVD! I bought her first one and I loved it! 'Um Ser Amor' feels like a continuation from the first one and let me tell you. You will never find another artist that sings with such emotion as her... the energy of the crowd feels amazing, it seems like you right there jumping, singing and shouting all those beautiful songs. The DVD comes with a little booklet that shows pictures of the show and the different names of the songs. The only thing that I would've love was for the DVD to come with Spanish subtitles (not the speaking part) but the songs too. I speak Spanish so it's easier to understand what she sings but I just wish to see the songs with Spanish subtitles so other people could understand. Buy it! You will not regret it! Amei o DVD! Lindo demais! =)",1383955200,3,782,4.326530612244898

Enjoy it",1363305600,,194,4.388888888888889
