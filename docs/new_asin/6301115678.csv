319281,4,6301115678,"A Young Man (Matthew Broderick) goes to the Deep South:World War 2, Boot Camp to be Supervised by a Sly Drill Sergent (Great Performance by Oscar-Winner:Christopher Walken) and he also amused with a War-Time Prostitude (Penelope Ann Miller).
Directed by Mike Nichols (The Birdcage, Regarding Herny, Wolf) brings a Well Made Film, thanks from the Screenplay by Neil Simon (The Odd Couple), Based on his Expeirences, this is the Second of Simon`s loosely autobiographical Trilogy (After Brighton Beach Memoirs). This film True High-Light is the Witty Comic Performance by Broderick. It was also an Box Office Hit in the Spring of 1988. This is a Charming Fine Coming of Age, Entertaining Dramatic Comedy. Super 35. Grade:A-.",1018828800,,722,5.232758620689655
319282,4,6301115678,"Neil Simon's 'Eugene Morris Jerome' plays never fail to make me laugh no matter how many times I see/read them.  He's got his finger on the pulse of true comedy, and it's treatment in this film is quite worthy.
Although the whole cast is great, Matthew Broderick does a fine job portraying Eugene; just the right amount of incredulousness and irreverence to do the character justice.  But he also carries the few bits of drama without many problems, so for any actor to handle comedy and drama with such flair is commendable.
Christopher Walken as the sadistic Sgt. Toomey steals the show, however, proving he's not just a bad guy in films... he's also a very FUNNY bad guy, with unerring comedic timing, that unfortunately doesn't get shown often enough.",991872000,5,755,4.8
319283,5,6301115678,"I found this movie to be simple and cute. I watched it once,and then i wanted to watch it again because i enjoyed it so much. The whole story revolves mainly around Eugene Jerome (Matthew Broderick) and how much  trouble he has at the army with a sergeant,the people he mainly talks  to,and the life he is having there. His fantasy was to lose his virginity  and fall in love,both of which he did,in the same day!  Eventually he made  amends with his friends,after all the things they went through. I really  enjoyed this movie,i was surprised about that too. All together the movie  was good. This is one i would want to buy and add to my collection.",961545600,7,651,4.420168067226891
319284,5,6301115678,"I saw this movie when it first came out and fell in love with it.  The music and the dialog recall a less jaded time, and the story line wrestles with real issues in a human way.  That part, at least, is probably not true  to the period. I couldn't help liking the characters.  I wish it was  available in DVD.",951091200,,310,4.016393442622951

319363,3,6301115678,"This is an autobiographical account by Neil Simon that I found humorless and mostly offensive (especially the first half).

319370,5,6301115678,"Great script, great actors & many great scenes & lines that stand out. I love Matthew Broderick & definitely Christopher Walken with his unique & very distinctive way of talking & walking and his awesome acting skills, and I loved both of these actors together in this movie. I had never seen Corey Parker who played the character Arnold Epstein before, he was fantastic as the confident geek who didn't take any crap & stood up for himself. In the beginning of the movie when Eugene played by Matthew Broderick said, ""it was only his 5th day in the army and so far he hated everyone,"" I burst out laughing and I was ""All In.""  I love dry, sarcastic humor and there is plenty of it in this movie from beginning to end, especially from these 3 characters. The scene where Eugene is having sex for the 1st time with a prostitute & losing his virginity, the lines he is saying are absolutely hilarious! This movie is very entertaining from beginning to end and I am so glad that I was not disappointed.",1478044800,,999,4.459016393442623

319407,5,6301115678,"Biloxi Blues is a gas.  WWII, Biloxi, Mississippi.  Yup.  Right at the bottom of the southern end of the cotton belt.  First of all, if you've never lived in the Deep South or along the Gulf of Mexico, you cannot imagine the stinking humidity.  Secondly, if you've ever had any military time with bootcamp involved, you'll understand this.  I've had the ""luxury"" of both.

Matthew Broderick plays Eugene Morris Jerome in this coming of age movie set at the end of World War II in 1945.  Coming out of New York the culture shock alone would have been enough to have thrown you for a loop.  (Trust me, it does.  Only I came from the West.)  Then there's the coming to grips with the reality of the military.  This was played wonderfully by Christopher Walken.  Sgt. Toomey (Walken) has a screw loose.. and it shows.

This movie is filled with memories that are and are not mine.  Neil Simon and I both seem to remember a lot of the same things.",1470700800,,942,4.426900584795321

319518,5,6301115678,"Biloxi Blues presents the unique story of life in the United States Army basic training, and the experiences of young men preparing for service in World War II. The bond that develops between these socially and culturally opposite men forms the nucleus of the humorous narrative, and the opportunity for easy good times and unexpected love allows protagonist Eugene Jerome (Matthew Broderick) to mature unexpectedly and realise the immense value of his time in the army.

319573,4,6301115678,"This film covers the World War II epoch but only in the training of some regular soldiers.  There are no actual battle scenes, for instance.
The plot is Matthew Broderick and other recruits arrive in Biloxi(Mississippi) and go thru the hell that is basic training.  What is different here is that we see different types of people(New Yorkers, for instance) intermingling and fighting with more stoic midwesterners and southerners.  The kettle is stirred as much by the DI(drill instructor) as anyone.  The DI is brilliantly played by Christopher Walken.  I won't spoil it for you but Walken(and the great director Mike Nichols') take on the DI is so nuanced and different, you will be stunned and amused.  Whether any such person ever existed in our army is debatable, but there it is.  It was perhaps unsurprising that this strange but amusing and fascinating look at army life was made by Nichols, whose other great military venture was Catch-22.
Once again, this is an 'Army' film but there is no battle, no heroics or casualties, and the only action is basic training and the traditional hazards of that.  Of the vets that I've known, all of them could see things in this film that ring true as well as some that were pure Hollywood.  Still and all, the result was an interesting and unsual comedy.",1420502400,,1302,4.776785714285714

There are very few Neil Simon play/movies that I don't like.  The man is dead on in every one of his charcters in plays and movies.

This one and ""Brighton Beach Memroir"" is my all time favorites.  Simon accomplishes what Woody Allen tried to do.

It was an enjoyable memory trip without all the horrors of usual war movies.

319776,5,6301115678,"Matthew Broderick plays a down-to-earth guy who turns out to be a ""Harriet the Spy""-like character--he records everything he sees and witnesses, and gives his impression on what his fellow soldiers are like while searching out his dream to become a writer, and to lose his virginity.

Christopher Walken plays a Sgt. 1st Class who has seen his share of combat, losing 73 percent of his comrades in North Africa alone, and having a metal plate installed in his head in the result. Now he's a fanatical drill sergeant who is challenged with a whole new platoon of recruits that he must train for war in just ten short weeks.

And in this movie, when you put these two characters together, you get a lot of havoc and military-like comedy, especially with the other soldiers of the platoon, like Pvt. Wykowski, who is an outspoken guy, but seems to know the wants and needs of his other friends, and Pvt. Epstein, a Jewish recruit who clearly states in this movie, ""The army has it's logic and I have mine.""

Daisy Hanigan plays the Catholic girl who attends school in nearby Gulfport that has a run-in with Matthew Broderick. She's in not too many of the scenes, even though the movie cover puts out the info that makes her seem like a huge deal in the movie. That's the only thing I hated about this movie---the lack of more scenes with them together! But it's not liable to lower the star rating, since the movie is still as funny as hell with the awkward, talkative, pre-sex scene and the drill sergeant getting drunk and confronting Broderick with a loaded pistol before he takes up his permanent residence with the Army Veteran's Hospital.

319817,5,6301115678,"Biloxi Blues is one of Neil Simon's most moving comedies.  The famous Simon one-liners are built into the play in the person of Eugene Jerome  (played by Matthew Broderick as a thinly disguised Simon himself), whose voice-over narration is that of a comic writer looking back on the often excruciating experience of boot camp just before the end of World War II.

Eugene quips, speaking in retrospect and in the character of the young recruit, but more often he expresses frustration, anger, anxiety, or regret, as he learns to cope with Americans from all over the United States, some of whom do not share his outlook or sense of values.

There are formidable, sharply etched characters, besides that of Eugene Jerome.  Arnold Epstein, Eugene's highly principled friend, is loathe to compromise his values, even if it means isolation, humiliating punishments, and confrontation with the sergeant in charge.  Then there is Sgt. Toomey, brilliantly played by Christopher Walken.  He is one of Neil Simon's most astounding creations, based no doubt on an actual person or at least a combination of real-life encounters.  Toomey is by turns brutal, funny, just, solicitous, and troubled, a complex authority figure who almost runs away with the film.  The audience can easily share the sentiments of the group as expressed by Eugene, that when he leaves they sorely miss him.

The two women, Rowena the hooker (played by Parker Overall) and Daisy the Catholic school girl (played by Penelope Ann Miller) would seem at first glance to be the classic ""virgin and whore"" dichotomy as an influence in the hero's life.  However, it is difficult, despite her profession, to categorize Rowena, whose patience, compassion, and understanding incline her more towards the ""heart of gold"" cliche, but who is a unique non-stereotypical character in many ways.  Through Rowena, Simon shares with us the tenderness as well as the hilarity sometimes connected with a boy's first time.

Every minute of Biloxi Blues is well-crafted and well-acted.  I found myself laughing until the tears came one minute and choking back tears of joy, relief, and compassion the next.  Biloxi Blues is quite simply one of my all-time favorite comedies.",1208736000,6,2217,5.1194444444444445
319818,5,6301115678,"""Biloxi Blues"" is the second in the trilogy of autobiographical plays Neil Simon wrote about Eugene Jerome (the first being ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"" and the third being ""Broadway Bound"", both of which have also been made into movies). This installment sees Jerome (Matthew Broderick) drafted into the army and forced to endure basic training with a group of men he has absolutely nothing in common with and an ""eccentric"" drill sergeant, Sgt. Toomey (Christopher Walken). Rather than taking the easy option and making all of these characters two-dimensional stereotypes, as a lesser writer would do, however, Simon gives each of his characters depth and makes his audience genuinely love and respect them, even Sgt. Toomey, especially Sgt. Toomey - and Christopher Walken is really great in this part. My biggest problem with ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"" was that I found Eugene Jerome to be too passive. Simon actually addresses this issue directly in this play/film (one character actually tells Jerome that he is too passive), and the play/film is all the better for it.

One of the biggest problems with many films that are based on stage plays is that they have a static, stagey feel to them. ""Biloxi Blues"", however, does not have this problem. The screen adaptation (the screenplay is also written by Neil Simon) is so good that I spent the whole film trying to work out how this could possibly have been performed on stage.

Ever since I was a child, I have always enjoyed the films and plays of Neil Simon (""Murder By Death"" was my favourite film from the ages of 5 to 12), but rewatching ""Biloxi Blues"" the other night, I reached the conclusion that this is my favourite Neil Simon play/film and furthermore, is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life.

Tooney (Christopher Walken) tries to foster discipline and trust among his new recruits; between each other and between them and himself.  Among them is Pte. Epstein, (Corey Parker) who prefers the use of his own intelligence beyond the role with which he is entrusted and rouses the anger of Sgt. Tooney, who does not find Pte. Eugene's humor amusing either. Instead Tooney has some of his own!  Eugene dreams of loosing his viginity and of romance and gets a chance at both.  By the end of the movie, these new recruits, these sole individuals, become a team of individuals, who would stick out their necks for one another. But will they for their Sgt. Tooney? Does he succeed in his mission?  This movie has its hillarious moments, its insights and its truths.

319823,5,6301115678,"Matthew Broderick created the role of Eugene Jerome at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles (then Broadway where he won the Best Actor in a Featured Role of a Play Tony Award) in Brighton Beach Memiors.  When the film was made he lost out to an inferior Jonathan Silverman.

A few years later he recreated Eugene Jerome at the Ahmanson and Broadway in the follow up Biloxi Blues.  This time they were wise when they made the film, they kept Broderick.

Biloxi Blues is semi autobiographical look at Neil Simon's experiences during boot camp during WWII.  Eugene has never out of Brooklyn, New York.  He is now going to the heart of the bible Biloxi, Missouri.  He has gone from on strict environment run by his Jewish mother to a toll different strict environment run by his tough drill sergeant.  These changes in situation is the basis of this movie.

Matthew Broderick has Eugene Jerome down pat.  His perfectly timed quips define Eugene.  Broderick has moved on to bigger and better things but Eugene Jerome will be his defining character.

Christopher Walken personifies the over the top drill instructor.  Walken doesn't take the easy road with this role.  He let's you see his frustration with being safe at home when he really wants to be on the front lines.  This is one of his finest performances.

Park Overall from Empty Nest makes a cameo as the hooker with a sort of heart of gold.  Park has an acerbic wit that combines with her natural southern style.

This is the best of the Neil Simon Eugene Jerome trilogy.

I watched this film a lot in preparation for my own going off to basic training in 1991, and I must say that it worked.  I learned a lot about the ""tricks"" and mindgames that the drill sargeant tries to play on fresh recruits, creating animosities and divisions among the men until they learn to bond together against the common enemy (the drill instructor himself).

Though set in WWII, its still highly relevant today, with an interesting mix of characters and attitudes, who haven't changed much even today.  I love the wit and Matthew Broderick is perfect for this role (I didn't like the first installment, ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"").  One of my favorite scenes is when the guys are comparing their fantasies to see who has the best one.  It later turns out that one of the guys' fantasies does come true, to give the drill instructor a taste of his own cruelty.

Some of the funniest bits of dialogue I've ever seen occur at the brothel, when Rowhena (sp?) gives Matthew's character a lesson in love that he's sure to take with him where ever he goes.  His nervousness is real and amusing to watch, as he uses his wit to feel more comfortable about what he's doing.  The film goes along pretty interesting for the most part, but kind of slopes near the end, where it gets too serious for its own good.  Despite that flaw, I still haven't seen any other film specifically about basic training that comes even close to accurate and relevancy as this one.  So, anyone going off to boot camp, make sure you watch this one before you go and learn from it.

Matthew Broderick plays the main character while Corey Parker appears as his Jew friend. Christopher Walken plays the eccentric drill sergeant.

This is a fairly entertaining talky drama with light comedic touches. The boot camp seems kind of laid back compared to real life, particularly the trainees relationship with the drill sergeant. (I was in Marine boot camp forty years later and it was totally strict with no leave on the weekends until a single weekend near the end of the three months; and, even then, it was limited to the base). As usual, Broderick makes for a likable protagonist while Walken is entertaining in an off-kilter kind of way.

Park Overall plays a prostitute in an awkward (but realistic) sequence while Penelope Ann Miller appears as a potential girlfriend for our hero. Its cool seeing the latter when she was so young and fetching.
