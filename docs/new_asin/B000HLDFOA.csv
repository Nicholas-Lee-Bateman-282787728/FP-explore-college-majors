2639133,5,B000HLDFOA,My daughter loved all the Baby Genius videos.  She would watch them from about 1 year old until about 3 years old.  She would get up and dance with the videos.  They also come with a CD of the music.  Great for car rides.  At 5 years old she will still listen to the CDs.,1297641600,,271,3.8545454545454545
2639134,1,B000HLDFOA,"This is a collection of hastily written songs that are nonsensical at best and downright annoying most of the time.  My 20-month old daughter will sit and watch this because of the video, which changes frames every second or so, and they do flash numbers up frequently.  But there are certainly no educational benefits to this video, and the lyrics are enough to drive an adult insane.  Baby Genius does much better when they stick to classical music or nursery rhymes, rather than attempting to compose their own songs.  Save your money for something more worthwhile for your child.",1233100800,,583,4.858585858585859
2639135,2,B000HLDFOA,"We got this for our two and a half year old to help her learn her numbers and start to learn to count things from 1 -10.  After about a month of watching the movie she can recognize most of her numbers but still does not really understand conceptually what they mean.  In the video there is a song for each number 1-10..for example, number 2 is a song about two dogs playing and shows pairs of dogs running around.  But then several of the songs don't even show the right number of objects.  Like number 7 song is supposed to be about 7 llamas, but in the video it only shows like 3-5 llamas.  The songs are mind-numbing to me, but do keep our daughter and our 1-year old son entertained with the songs, even if they're not really learning counting.  Also, the movie is a super low-budget production, which normally would not bother me, but there are a few clips that are recycled through the video and hokey animated characters walking across the screen all the time.  I would not recommend this to a friend as a good product for teaching counting and there are definitely better entertainment videos and more effective educational videos out there for little people.",1208736000,6,1168,4.507109004739337
2639136,1,B000HLDFOA,"This is a new low for Baby Genius.  We tolerated the Nursery Rhymes and Childrens' Songs DVDs, but this one is just so cheaply made.  The male singer on the songs is not even studio musician quality and certainly not as decent as the one on Nursery Rhymes.  The songs are not wonderful either.  I don't like the Marching Off To War song on a child's video.  My son does not like this DVD at all.

Don't waste your money.",1182470400,4,420,4.1875
2639137,5,B000HLDFOA,"He's only one, but he loves this video and he loves the Nursery Rhymes one also.  He can't get enough of it!",1178755200,2,108,3.909090909090909
2639138,4,B000HLDFOA,"They seem to like this although the attention seems to be lost a little by the time it get's to the middle. I think the short ones are much more fun and interactive for them, the Childrens favorite songs, and Childrens favorite Nursery Rymes are the best ever.",1172361600,5,260,4.4375

2639151,1,B000HLDFOA,"This is not favorite counting songs the DVD this is childrens songs the DVD and there is a CD that is included with counting songs. Discription is a lie, lie, lie. I wanted my toddler to see and hear the numbers with songs. That is not what I got with this dvd and cd combo",1363564800,,273,3.981818181818182

2639154,5,B000HLDFOA,My baby is only 4 months old and he loves this DVD to Death- it's the only one he'll watch over and over and over again. If you guys know of any others like this let me know. He doesn't like any of the other baby genius DVD's but I think he adores this one because the scenes change so frequently.,1342051200,,297,3.8852459016393444
2639155,4,B000HLDFOA,received it on time and the product is just like new with very good packing would buy the product again,1340928000,,103,4.2
2639156,5,B000HLDFOA,I purchased this DVD for my daughter when she turned one years old. She learned how to count in order and out of order watching this DVD. I initially saw this On Demand and decided I needed to purchase this. It was definitely worth the money.,1334188800,,242,4.282608695652174
2639157,5,B000HLDFOA,"My 3 yr old already knows his numbers but for some reason he really likes this video the best out of all the Baby Genius videos.  At least once a day he will say ""number 1 is fun - 1, 1, 1!""  I disagree with another reviewer in that I think the video teaches number recognition as well as the concept - e.g. for the number ""2"" there are 2 dogs running on the beach. So you see the number 2, see two dogs running on the beach and the song starts with ""two happy dogs, run run run...."" I like it because it offers an opportunity to discuss what's happening -- actions, prepositions, etc. -- in each segment with real kids/people and not animated ones.",1325289600,,649,4.142857142857143
2639158,4,B000HLDFOA,"We received this as part of a package of DVDs as a gift; and so were not seeking an educational tool as some of the reviewers suggest they were doing when buying this DVD.

That said, my 20-month old LOVES this DVD.  We haven't exposed him to much in the way of DVDs yet, but have also played ""Baby Animals"" and it does not interest him as much.  I think it's because the tunes aren't as catchy.

This DVD has been great for us because (1) he is learning words, and there are many opportunities in this video to practice them... bird, baby, dog, balloon, horse, boat, robot, etc.  (2) the videos themselves may not be high-production, but they have an interesting variety of content and I can certainly see why they are entertaining for my 1-year old to watch, in a good way (3) each little song/video is introduced with a chime that cues his continued interest -

The reviews were few and tepid, so I have felt compelled to offer that this is a fun, positive DVD in our house that currently gets played daily --",1305763200,3,1012,4.3563829787234045
8140443,2,B000HLDFOA,"When I ordered this for my grandson based on the label, I thought it would be all animated. It is not, the people in the video represent 90% caucasian. Not much diversity I was offended by the video and will not buy any other products from Baby Genius because of this covert act of racism.",1524096000,,289,4.2727272727272725
