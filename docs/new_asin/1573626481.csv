6/12: Suspicious Minds is an enjoyable low-key film noir. I think the whole thing was well done, heightened by the fine performance of Patrick Bergin who is familiar to the audience as the evil guy in Sleeping with the Enemy. In this film Suspicious Minds, he is the good guy, and the mustache of his is what makes it film noir. I like the mystery aspect of it, and the plot is done with intelligence. It's sensible, it works, and it passes for a good thriller. I know that you see Gary Busey on the cover, but really...he is nominal in this one. It's better if he is left off of the cast; his presence serves no purpose. It's strictly a Patrick Bergin vehicle.

192738,3,1573626481,"A slightly different kind of predictable ""B"" movie (not to say that first class movies are never predictable; they are, but the writing, directing and acting overcome the predictablility so that it is a minor aspect). This is not one of those movies but can be watched for the plot twists which are sufficiently adequate to mask the real culprits until the end. A true student of plots may watch it twice to make sure he or she has got the right perpetrator matched to the right crime. The ""B"" quality predictability lies only in the writing/staging/ production efforts to make it a DRAMA/suspense, complete with not totally revealing sex. The efforts were fairly successful in two things -- the choice of music backdrop and the dramatization of the friendship between the cop and the private eye. Patrick Bergin's performance saves the cast from being a total ""B"" type one and he pits his intensity acting against all the factors which keep the film from being an ""A"" one. He's not quite up to his superb performance in ""Sleeping With the Enemy"" but he is a definite plus in this one. Too bad his partner in illicit love just doesn't come across as a femme fatale.",993168000,2,1165,4.660194174757281
