8739478,2,B017JDF6GS,"Acting was terrible. A few minutes into the movie my wife and I looked at each other and thought. Really? The reviews on Amazon video made it seem like a decent movie. The longest hour and something ever, but I thought for the $3.99 rental we would stick it out. Should have shut it off and cut my losses.",1482105600,,305,4.186440677966102

8739482,4,B017JDF6GS,"This is a wild, over the top, comic book style cult film that brings the imagination to every moment watched. A super hero style entertainment. This has all the elements of late night, Drive-In, Ghoul Hosted piece of cinema, spread to the masses, that wish for nothing more than simple, silly entertainment. This is a modern cult film in all its perfection. A fun, wild, interesting piece of pure popcorn entertainment that shines in comic book style. Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. An instant Cult Film.

Now do not confuse this with the 2005 Movie Mosquitoman a.k.a. Mansquito created by the Syfy Channel. This is totally a different movie. I guess this was originally titled Sucker. It seems it has taken a very long time to get this movie created, finished and out to the masses. I gather it started back in 2013 and finally showcased in 2016 and now finally getting a release on DVD. This film is a pure treat of comic book style, science fiction entertainment. Its a pure blast of fun super hero reality.

Directed, co-written and even stars as the main character, so in reality an all-around guru of this film, Michael Manasseri. Some of your die-hard film lovers, or TV lovers, should recognize that name, or cause you to scratch your head and say I think I know that name. Well, Michael has been in quite a few cult style pieces of entertainment. He played Charles in the 1988 classic, License to Drive. Stared in many pieces of television entertainment. From, Raising Miranda, A Peaceable Kingdom, WINGS, Charlie Hoover, and what I personally remember him from, (and most will) the TV series based on the great cult film Weird Science. He played Wyatt from 1994 to 1998. The series was a wild, fantastic piece of pure comical entertainment, and Michael was a pure blast. Now he takes over the role of super hero Mosquito-man, and once again, its a pure blast of laugh out, great action, often silly perfection, that I had a total orgy of entertainment throughout this whole film. A great throwback to classic Drive-in entertainment. It has all the elements of a b-movie, and a creature feature mentality.

Your main character Jim Crawley happens to be having one of those horrible days, kind of like a Monday. First he gets fired from his job, which is working at a nuclear power plant. Next his car is impounded. Then he finds out his wife is banging another. Soon, thats not the worst because next he is kidnapped by a deranged mad scientist that wants to experiment, and test out his vaccine created to fight against a deadly virus thats running rampant. As you would guess it, spread by MOSQUITOs. What the mad scientist doesnt know is that Jim has been exposed to many years of radiation due to his job. The vaccine mixed with the radiation ends up altering and changing Jim into a half man, half mosquito. Mixing alongside Jims desire for ultimate revenge.

Now what is so great about this is it comes in a 2 Disc Special Edition. It has a wonderful array of extras. The whole movie has to be seen to be appreciated and understood. Its a must see for comic fans, super hero fans, science fiction fans, or just pure lovers of original entertainment.

Also what has to be mentioned is the wonderful cast of performers in this film. As mentioned the thoroughly entertaining Michael Manasseri. Also the wonderful Kimberly Kates, Monty Bane, Ricky Wayne, Jordan Trovillion and Danny Mooney which all give great perofrmances. This also has the one of a kind, solid guru of low budget, cult entertainment. The man, the God, the One and only Lloyd Kaufman. The amazing man behind one of the greatest studios ever TROMA Entertainment. It was awesome seeing him in this.

Overall:

I was in total Cult, Drive-In heaven with this film. It has all the trademarks of classic black and white Science Fiction films. It bleeds a Film Noir style. It has Comic Book flare. A solid comical and thoroughly entertaining piece of film that should be seen. Its a total blast of pure one of a kind originality. A great 2-disc DVD filled with extras, and also two versions of the film. Highly Recommended.
