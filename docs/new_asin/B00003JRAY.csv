8471522,5,B00003JRAY,The first and original cat &mouse chase was done by none other than Tom &Jerry. They're funny and very enjoyable. It's something that would please people of all ages (it's not just a kid's cartoon series). They're up to their usual tricks and chases. Either Tom plans traps to get Jerry while Jerry soon seeks revenge or it's Jerry annoying Tom who tries to get back at Jerry. They're safe and timeless. It's a cartoon series that'll never lose it's flavour. It's the original series that later was the inspiration for many cartoons today. They are lovable characters unique and original and the pranks are as creative as they can get. They're obviously no ordinary cat &mouse. They're special and every episode is different from the previous (unlike most cartoons today). It's a must-buy video collection! Kids as well as grown ups will love this. You can just call it a Disney thing (enjoyable to people of all ages). I highly recommend this collection!,1027123200,6,955,4.829268292682927

Too bad Hanna/Barbera went into the Flinstones and the rest. This tape has some masterpieces on it.",983145600,15,334,4.775862068965517
8471524,4,B00003JRAY,"Tom & Jerry are my most favorite cartoon characters. I watched them growing up as a little girl.  Now I'm older and have three little children  of my own.  My oldest daughter has made this her most favorite show.  It's  a classic cat chase mouse, mouse gets away and comes back for more teasing.",965260800,6,295,4.388888888888889
