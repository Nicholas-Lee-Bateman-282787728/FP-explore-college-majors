8722468,5,B010GJM7KK,"Epitomizes George Balanchine's legacy of The New York City Ballet 1965 staging of ""The Nutcracker Ballet"" for posterity with a filmed production of the Tchaikovsky musical journey.  Ballanchine serves a sumptuous ballet feast in his disciplined creative technical dance choreography featuring the finest dance cast of The NYC Ballet company's production team of performance art.  The Production's creative delightfull original 1965 scenery by Broadway Production Designer - Rouben Ter-Arutunian.  Beautiful costumes designed by the NYC Ballet courturier Barbara Karinska: noteworthy, since Karinska's ballerina skirts display every waist skirt style - the tutu, the English pancake, the 3/4 French gathered full sheer small net style.  Visually, the film captures a recording of an actual ""live ballet performance of The Nutcracker.""",1514160000,,833,5.974789915966387
