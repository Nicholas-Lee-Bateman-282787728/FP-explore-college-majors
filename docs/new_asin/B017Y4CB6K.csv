8741014,5,B017Y4CB6K,It's great to have a DVD of this master.  Too bad his comments and funny banter were edited out.  His performances show he deserved to win America's Got Talent!,1482883200,,160,4.482758620689655

8741016,5,B017Y4CB6K,I bought this product thinking I was buying a CD and when it arrived I discovered the error.  I wish this had been a CD as I would listen to it a lot.  Landau is a talented musician and I believe he is on the path to an incredible career.  He recently played at the Sparks Nugget in Nevada to a sold out crowd.  I waited too long to get a ticket and unfortunately was unable to get one - weeks prior to his scheduled performance.  I still am waiting for the long promised CD.  I hope I won't have to wait much longer.  I already own his other 2 CDs.,1455753600,4,549,3.891891891891892
8741017,5,B017Y4CB6K,"I was at the concert in Washington DC when this show was filmed, and Landau and his Big Band were in top form that night!  If you're a fan of artists like Frank Sinatra, Michael Buble', Harry Connick and Nat King Cole, you'll love this guy's take on those timeless songs. I just heard ""Ain't That A Kick In The Head"" in a TV commercial and remember Landau starting his show with it...his version is better than the one on the commercial!  One of the things I like most about this DVD is that it's obviously not been altered or overdubbed in any way; what you're hearing is Landau's actual voice and the band actually playing every note. Landau's come a long way since winning America's Got Talent...check him out.",1447891200,11,713,4.476923076923077
