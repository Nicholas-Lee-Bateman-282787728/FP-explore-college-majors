5675771,5,B00BUGZY5E,"Nice piece of art, great team. Beautiful landscaps, places, and for every photo a story behind. In few words, nice videos.

5675772,4,B00BUGZY5E,"So far, I've watched one show.  I wondered how I could get so many shows for such a low price (relative to his other DVDs).  The first show was just fine.  I anticipate the rest will be too.  And, the price is very good for that much video of places around the world....  Plus, the photograpic tips he casually inserts through his video were super.  (I am an amateur photographer... in my mind).  I still don't understand the low price....",1376784000,,439,4.4125
5675783,5,B00BUGZY5E,Excellent set of DVDs.  I find them to be very inspirational and each time I watch them I learn something new.,1420156800,,110,4.238095238095238
5675784,5,B00BUGZY5E,"I never get tired of seeing this series, as an armchair traveller and a nature photographer.  Art takes us to remote, stunning locations and shares his approach to photographing the landscape, wildlife and flora.  So much to see and learn here!",1419897600,,244,4.926829268292683

5675787,4,B00BUGZY5E,"Always an enjoyable watch, though some tend to confuse this show with what it's not. It is not a traditional travel show filled with tips and advice, nor is it a how-to photography show, though if you pay attention you will learn some valuable lessons. Instead, the viewer is given the privilege of following along with Art as he travels the world looking for cultures and striking images to capture with his camera.",1418428800,2,416,4.712328767123288
5675788,5,B00BUGZY5E,Very Good,1417910400,,9,4.0
5675789,5,B00BUGZY5E,"An outstanding series that spans the globe.  Art has an artist's eye for landscapes and an uncanny ability to capture the moment with wildlife.  The videography is masterful as well.  If you're interested in photography, you'll get Art's insights and thoughts as he selects scenes, backgrounds, angles, and lighting.  He will inspire you to strive for extraordinary results. I know I'll be watching the series over and over.",1417219200,,424,5.1911764705882355
5675790,5,B00BUGZY5E,i love art and love that he talks about his creative process,1416960000,,60,4.083333333333333
5675791,5,B00BUGZY5E,"This is a great DVD set.  Unfortunately the public television station in my area never carried this series, so I had to order it to see it. I have to admit that I was a little disappointed to find that the show is more of a nature and destination show then it is about photography.  As Art Wolfe is one of my favorite photographers and is the author of several books that I own about photography, I expected the show to be more about the photography than it is. Still, the show was outstanding and Art Wolfe's passion for travel is infectious and makes me want to go visit the places that he has been. I get so excited watching his travels that I have found that I can't watch the show right before I go to bed or I won't be able to go to sleep.",1414281600,5,745,4.061224489795919
5675792,5,B00BUGZY5E,Excellent!!!!!!! Highly recommended!!!!!!,1413849600,,41,13.0
5675793,4,B00BUGZY5E,If you like Art Wolfe's photography you will love this series. The only downside is that the DVDs are not separated; but for the price well worth it.,1405814400,,149,4.357142857142857
5675794,5,B00BUGZY5E,This is a great series by great Photographer . Excellent video work. nice work well done okay wow it rocks bla bla bla,1396051200,,118,4.173913043478261
5675795,5,B00BUGZY5E,"I have enjoyed these DVDs very much. Art Wolfe is very entertaining and informative.  You can learn a lot about places you will probably not be able to visit.  The scenery is always fantastic. I would recommend these DVDs to people like me who love nature,geography and history.",1395792000,4,278,4.770833333333333
5675796,3,B00BUGZY5E,"I bought this with the expectation that it would have some significant value to me in learning to be a better landscape/wildlife photographer, which is my hobby.  It is virtually useless in that regard.  It is a series about photgenic places and the locations are awesome.  Unfortunately, Art is a better photographer than host/narrator, so a travel series isn't his forte.
Furthermore, since the series was aired several years ago (even though the DVD series is very new), all of the web links mentioned to go to for photographic tips and techniques no longer exist.
Bottom line - don't get this series if you are looking for photographic tips and techniques by a pro.",1395100800,7,669,4.850877192982456
5675797,5,B00BUGZY5E,I could not stop watching the dvds once they came in the mail. I watch all the dvds in one weekend!,1394323200,,99,3.761904761904762
5675798,5,B00BUGZY5E,"A true bargain for these outstanding adventures in places not often seen in other travelogues, and never better photographed.
 This is the Christmas gift I gave my best friends and brother this year making a cheerful holiday for all!",1390089600,,233,4.9743589743589745
5675799,5,B00BUGZY5E,"Always enjoyed watching this show, but it's hard to watch since when it is on it's shown in the very early morning.  Now I can watch whenever or wherever.  If your into photography or nature you can learn somethings from watching this series.",1386979200,,242,4.604651162790698
5675800,5,B00BUGZY5E,"I always enjoy watching Art's program in PBS. With this collection, I can watch all these episodes anytime. It offers good sound and excellent video quality (using blue-ray player). From the program, you get more than the photo technique and location. You learn about the place and get to see and appreciate Art's efforts as professional photographer. This set is good for both travel and photography enthusiasts.

The prices is lot cheaper than the ""Art Wolfe Travels to the Edge - Season 1 & 2, All Volumes"" ($89.95) in his website. However, you do get 8 individual disc/volumes there. For this package, 4 discs are stacked up on one pin. It is hard to take and put back disc. Nonetheless, I am very happy with the purchase.",1386720000,6,726,4.716535433070866
5675801,5,B00BUGZY5E,"For nature lovers this is a fabulous series. For serious, experienced photographers, the photos are wonderful, but the information you can glean is only sometimes useful.",1385424000,4,170,5.576923076923077
5675802,5,B00BUGZY5E,This is a great gift for my daughter who loves photography! I hope her husband and two young sons will sit with her and enjoy this educational tool!,1381276800,,148,4.321428571428571

8574084,2,B00BUGZY5E,"Good photography. I just wish he didn't come across as such a self centered, self serving, pompous person.",1512086400,,106,4.944444444444445
8574085,5,B00BUGZY5E,"wonderful series by Mr Wolf. I highly recommend for general viewing pleasure and for photographers specifically. Most often, it's a world-wide view of nature and humanity with emphasis upon regional cultures and animals....masking as a program about photography. Occasionally, there are good tips for beginners but, overall, it is a masterpiece of cultural history and nature documentation.",1489708800,,390,5.859649122807017
8574086,4,B00BUGZY5E,"Art travels to a lot of off-the-path places.  Of course, not everyone may be quite as
interested in the in-depth coverage of the flora and fauna of these exotic places.",1476921600,,168,4.6

Subject matter meshes perfectly with Kleiner's Perspectives in Non-Western cultures.",1456790400,,244,5.942857142857143
8574089,5,B00BUGZY5E,This is a great show with tons of information and beautiful places. Art Wolfe is a master photographer and traveler and you can learn a ton from just watching his show. It's not a how to on photography but the information is there to be had if you want it. The places he goes to are amazing and so are the images he creates. Love this show and I'm so glad I bought these dvd's!!!,1454716800,,379,4.066666666666666
8574090,4,B00BUGZY5E,"While I own and enjoy this series and his books, the series has 2 problems.

1) No subtitles for the deaf community.
2) Standard instead of high definition video. Heck, nobody has even made a standard definition TV in years.

Bring it out in HD with subtitles and I'll buy 2 copies, one each for myself and my best friend and his wife who are deaf.",1454630400,,348,4.257575757575758
8574091,5,B00BUGZY5E,"Art Wolfe is one of the top photographers in the world today. Even though this was filmed several years ago it is still relevant today. He takes us along on his travels and shows us his techniques. Whether you travel a lot or not the travels are enjoyable and informative. If you want to see a master photographer at work, get these DVD's.",1443398400,,339,4.396825396825397
