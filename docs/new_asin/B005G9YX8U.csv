There exist many prints and releases of the Mutual shorts, some of marginally better image quality, but none can compare with the rowdy Dixieland music and sfx which are so much in keeping with the spirit of these century-old treasures. I believe Chaplin would cherish them.",1516665600,,469,5.184210526315789
8471428,5,B005G9YX8U,"If you appreciate the 1932 Van Bueren scores, you will love this collection. The Mutual period was Chaplin at the mountaintop. Also, Blackhawk Films has recently restored these films (with a new score) and the quality is astounding. It makes one shudder to remember that they were created a century ago.
