I have always loved the sound of the classical guitar so I bought some books on some solos.  I enjoyed them but they didn't have the latin flavor I really enjoy.  One night, I went to see Tomatito and Michel Camilo play as a duet and I was in awe of Tomatito's technique.  I was about 10 feet away from him and I couldn't figure out how he was getting all those beautiful sounds.  So, I decided to see if I could learn flamenco, at least the basics.  Not having a teacher in my immediate area (NYC), I decided to buy a book on flamenco technique.  The right hand techniques were VERY VERY difficult for me to get from the book so I decided to try to find a video that would be a little clearer as to the right hand technique, specifically the rasgueado.  That's when I found this video.

  I love this video.  It truly is a GREAT starting point for anyone that wants to begin learning flamenco guitar.  When I saw Oscar do the rasgueado, I finally got it and, after much practice, I'm getting better.  The video gives you several techniques that, with practice, will get you to sound like a flamenco guitarist... ALMOST! :-)

  As a guitar student that has learned many techniques from videos before, I give this video the highest rating possible for its clarity, its simplicity, and its ability to take your playing to places you've only dreamed of!",1100822400,2,1487,4.384615384615385
