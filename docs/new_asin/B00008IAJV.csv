1847795,5,B00008IAJV,"I sat down to watch this thinking it would be a stereotypical Bollywood flic. I was way off in this assumption, to my pleasant surprise. I was once told that Indians hate movies with sad endings. The ending here could be considered happy or sad, it is debatable. I was sickened at one point, but the movie was also very beautiful, contained terrific music and dancing, an interesting story line, and it touched on some socio-political-historical issues.

It was musically, theatrically, and emotionally stunning. In my opinion this is a must see movie for a mature audience. You have to have patience for a movie this long, worthwhile for the introspective.",1168560000,6,657,4.918918918918919
1847796,1,B00008IAJV,"Ok, so keeping the fact that the songs in this movie kick butt, which standalone take only about 30-60 minutes to listen too, the movie (other than the not so surprise, ""surprise ending) is an absolute dud.

First of all, the movie comes with an in your face, this is what we think the facts should be about the history of the disputed area of Jammu and Kashmir and don't really care what the truth might be. As offensive as that might be to people whose lives have actually been affected by the stubbornness of india over the dispute, we will let it go and move on.

Secondly, it seems that the writers, director, producer all lack the balls to actually say that this is the matter of Kashmir. Until the mention of ""Cargill"" comes you can't be sure where this is happening in india. I mean, let's face it... with 26 states and 21 insurgencies the greatest ""democracy"" in the world can't really boast a country with peace and harmony and hence it really becomes a wild guess game for some time in the movie to figure out who actually are the ""Terrorists/Freedom Fighters"". Even in the movie at points this paranoia of the people shows where the officer of intelligence asks ""Who do you work for"" and then names 4 insurgencies with fluency ;).

Third, and kinda tying into the first, the fact of the matter is that up till ~1960 the government of india (Including Nehru) claim that Kashmir is a disputed area and a referendum in accordance with the UN resolution should be held. The Movie decides to forget this fact in the beginning by shahrukh saying ""They are my countryman, they are just a little mad"". My dear all, truth of the matter is that Kashmir is no more a part of india than Bangladesh is a part of Pakistan. So the Kashmiris are not indian and they are not ""Just Mad"". They are beyond pissed and want their right to choose delivered.

Lastly, there seems to be confusion throughout the movie about the religion of the girl. She does some pooja paat like movements in the mundir like place, but also is on her way to becoming a shaheed. Now one true indication of a true Muslim, he/she will never bow to anyone but God Almighty.

Of course, this review would be incomplete if I don't mention shahrukhs acting which in its sameness from one movie to another is as unique as Motorola razor these days. Not to mention the blatant disregard by the director in establishing any character at all. One minute the girl is covering all her body, the next she is showing her belly. In the beginning shahrukh is getting his butt beet by the same guys who he suddenly and with some excellent moves beets up at the end.

All in all I must say that the waste of time that I felt after watching this movie was so great that I promised myself that if I can save anyone else from such a severe feeling of loss, I will attempt it. So here it is, I hope it helps y'all.",1157500800,6,2862,4.380414312617702
1847797,4,B00008IAJV,"While not much of a fan of Bollywood movies, I got this DVD after hearing the music in the opening credits of the Hollywood movie ""Inside Man"".  The music is catchy, so I looked it up on the web and found that it was from this movie.

The song, ""Chaiyya Chaiyya"", has an excellent rhythm and wonderful sounding lyrics (although I don't understand the language).  But the dance scene on the train is nothing short of incredible.  The energy of Shahrukh Khan and his obvious enthusiasm along with an excellent job of filming and superb editing make the entire scene a joy to watch.  While the video quality falls short of Hollywood standards, the the music sound quality is excellent (especially if you have a Dolby digital sound with a subwoofer).

As for the rest if the DVD, I found the story to be absorbing enough to maintain my interest through out the entire 2 hours and  40 minutes.  There are four other songs besides ""Chaiyya Chaiyya"" which also add to the experience.  I will probably investigate other Bollywood movies after seeing this.  They have something to offer to even the most selective movie fan.",1157500800,14,1115,4.671794871794872
1847798,5,B00008IAJV,"Dil Se was conceived as the finale in Ratnam's trilogy of films on the subject of Terrorism, following Roja and Bombay.  But while the former films were constructed as social docu-dramas emphasizing liberal humanism and a multicultural utopia, Dil Se culminates this theme in an entirely separate genre.  Ratnam's screenplay deftly sets up our expectations and then quickly proceeds to obliterate them.  The film is, at first glance, simply a social drama.  Many critics have tried to categorize Dil Se as a social film or as a film on Terrorism--some have even gone so far as to call it ""separatist propaganda.""  To imply such an idea is to deny the central theme of the film: Love.  Dil Se is essentially a film about the phenomenon of Love, executed in fiercely unconventional and unsentimental fashion.

If Lamhe ushered in a new genre of anti-social love stories, Dil Se substantiated the genre by epitomizing what had never been seen in a Hindi film: the anti-romantic Love Story.  Lamhe was anti-social and anti-establishment in that it rejected outright the traditional sexual and moral status quo by merely inferring that it could ever be conceivable for a woman to love a man who was in love with her mother.  Despite its rejection of traditional morality, Lamhe remains a deeply romantic movie.  Dil Se is anything but.  It is constructed not to convey the triumphant bliss of Love, but its devastating helplessness.  It is a Love Story in its truest sense, where the traditional context and protagonists are equally subdued, told against the backdrop of terrorism wherein the central female figure is herself a humanized terrorist.  Sadly, this many viewers have failed to recognize.

Long before Shah Rukh Khan reduced his career to a sad shadow if its former self, he was consistent at proving in film after film that he was willing to take artistic risks and broaden the definition of the Filmi Hero.  Dil Se was and remains the great experiment of his career.  Here he is a young lover, but one who must contend with Love, instead of reveling in it.  His fondness for his fiance, Preity, is buried under his passion for Meghna, his obsession.  Clearly, he finds her both beautiful and enigmatic, and without much hesitation, he follows her throughout the war torn land of Ladakh.  Smart move?  Probably not.  But never do we second guess his decision because we believe that he is so utterly bewildered by the shadowy creature that is Meghna.

Preity Zinta, in her debut role, is both refreshing and natural, giving a spontaneous performance that oddly never seems out of place in a morbid and pensive film.  Her delivery is always natural, and never does she make the mistake of trying to 'act with emotion.'  True, she has the most conventional role of the three leads, but she lends balance to the story which could have ended up being more esoteric and surreal than it already is. Irrespective of Khan and Zinta's effective performances, both the superstar and the debutante are given characters far less substantial than that of Meghna, played by Manisha Koirala.

In a role of almost no dialogue, Koirala conveys literally volumes.  Through her stifled body language, her forbidding expressions disclosing an unnamed identity, and an unknowable language of sadness spoken through her eyes, she conjures a darkly beautiful portrait of the ghostly survival of suffocated humanity.  She is the greatest example of human (and humane) artistry in a film burgeoning with the message of humanity.  You will notice as you peruse through the various customer reviews of this film that Shah Rukh Khan gets mentioned quite a lot, Manisha less so.  One cannot help but wonder why.  Shah Rukh Khan may be the box-office draw that helped get the film made, but Dil Se is Manisha Koirala's film.  Make no mistake about it.

Koirala's performance goes far beyond merely propping up the tender terrorist as a victim of circumstance: the actress digs into the character and pulls out the skeleton, bloodied and broken, and harangues the audience with a brilliantly lucid portrayal of a dark and disturbed avenger. Regardless of whether the claim that it was too vague or esoteric is indeed true, Dil Se remains an artistic benchmark for the triumph of Koirala's portrayal of Meghna in what can only be called a transcendent performance.  Every element of Meghna's broken  humanity is summoned by Koirala to conjure a portrayal that is breathtakingly skinless: the emptiness of the eyes, the somber visage swallowed in pain, the almost whispered dialogue, and a body language bespeaking a lifetime of defeat.  There is no greater praise for an actor than to be told by a viewer that they had forgotten that the actor was acting.  When a performance becomes so convincing, so emotionally naked, and so singularly manifest, the actor disappears--literally--and one forgets that they are watching a performer and not a character.  This is the miracle of Koirala's Meghna.  There is no Manisha Koirala on the screen.  None whatsoever.  What we see is the character, and only the character, so perfect is this performance.  This is one of the greatest--if not the greatest--pieces of method acting ever accomplished in Hindi cinema. This is the kind of performance which, if Hindi Cinema were more cerebral and more conscious of artistic aims, dance queens like Madhuri Dixit and Aishwariya Rai would never pass muster as actresses.  Alas.  Part of the greatness of Koirala's performance is that she plays Meghna as a shadow, an almost ghost-like figure whose movements are untraceable and whose thoughts are impenetrable.  She is a human being who rejects her humanity and has forgotten how simply  'to be', an existential quandary which Hindi Cinema almost boastfully ignores.

The beauty of the film lies not so much in the actual love story, but in the director's ability to put a human face on terrorism. The mood is somber, the cinematography astonishing, and the perfect performance of Koirala makes Dil Se a startling piece of cinematic poetry.  The film stands in a class of its own as a modern masterpiece, and can be considered fodder for only those that are willing to incorporate sadness and starkness into their movie-going experience.  Others will find it too harsh.",1153526400,24,6279,4.980806142034549
1847799,2,B00008IAJV,How is it possible that there are no Lyric Subtitles in this dvd? That's absurd!,1119744000,4,80,4.4
1847800,5,B00008IAJV,"First Off, Dil Se has nothing to do with the title. It's not your standard love film or nothing like you'd think or expect. The songs to this movie are just awesome and add to the flow of the movie. I'd probably say they're better than the movie itself.

Anyhow, the film is a huge respect earner. Shahrukh Khan adds to this movie a fruitful flow of his own. His character is that of an average man just like you and me but one who actually believes in knowing everything he wants to. His reasoning in the movie is second to none , he does everything he can to get his love and more. Anyhow, I might make the movie sound small by making it sound like a love story but then yes it is a love story.

Dil Se is about a journalist/radio jockey falling in love with a women with a mission. There was a time when Manisha Koirala could act and Dil Se certifies that. I don't think any of our other beloved heroines could have played her role in the film as potently. The second half of the movie has some scenes of Shahrukh being chased by some legal authorities. The kind of 5-10 impact of terror that is displayed during those scenes is enough to certify the agony one must feel. The song AIYE AJNABI is one of the few songs that make this movie a winner.

SRK is shown as a radio jockey describing his brief meeting with a stranger he never spoke to,he only wish(es) he did. I'm not gonna spoil this for people who haven't seen it. Some say the end of the film was nonsensical but I think it's not for the weak hearts. I must admit I was a bit taken aback by the thunderous conclusion but then it fits a realist's edge of reasoning.

A great film.

Those who enjoyed this film must watch ""Bombay"" or for the younger audience ""Yuva""

Mani Ratnam is genius.",1114819200,7,1751,4.196428571428571
1847801,5,B00008IAJV,"Dil se was an absolutley awesome movie. the colors, the drama, the music, the dancing...there's no way to beat it! You have to see it!",1084406400,2,134,4.4
1847802,5,B00008IAJV,"Dil Se is a movie that captures you on so many levels. The actors are wonderful and it's a pity that Shahrukh Khan is not better known here in the USA, because he is pure magic. Maybe if you think of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro combined with someone with great moves, who can really dance, you just might come close to describing Shahrukh.

As one of India's huge Bollywood stars, Shahrukh has one of those marvelous subtle faces that can simultaneously express multiple layers of feeling. In one moment he is handsome, seductive, and in the next he is vulnerable, awkward, and compellingly ordinary. His enigmatic, little boy, rascal smile will steal your heart.

There are two famous actresses in Dil Se, but Manisha Koirala plays the heroine, a lovely mountain peasant girl. At age 12, she saw her family gunned down by soldiers who then raped her. She walks in a world warped from pain and frozen emotion most of us could never comprehend and, along with her fellow terrorists, has become a suicide bomber.

Shahrukh meets her by accident and mistakes her aloof cold manner for siren mystery. As she shuns his advances at every turn, he - a rather spoiled radio journalist - is driven deeper into his desire for her. That desire becomes obsession - Dil Se. She cannot become whole again to return his love, and he cannot endure life without her. He begs her to take him with her, and so she does.

What draws me to this film is not just profound spontaneous depth of the actors and their willingness to show a wide range of feelings, but Dil Se made it apparent to me how stiff and mechanical my own culture has become. Even the Bollywood musical numbers are somehow fun, fresh and captivating. The sheer beauty of the photography is stunning and Manisha has the power to be a rough desert girl, a sophisticated beauty, or the most classic odalisque of the French painter Ingres.

On the back of the DVD it says: Ancient Arabic literature classifies love into seven different shades...HUB...their eyes meet, it is like a touch...a spark...Attraction. UNS...the touch of the eyes was as if, it was infatuation. ISHQ...the flame of the body is felt, his breath starts igniting...Love. AQIDAT...Reverence...she touches him like a whisper, as if silence is mixed in here eyes...he prays, knelt down on the floor, a little consciously & a little unconsciously...IBADAAT...he is entangled on her path...entangled in her arms...Love turns to worship. JUNOON...his living is an Obsession...his dying is an obsession...apart from this there is no peace...MAUT...let him rest in the lap of Death...let his drown his body in her soul... DIL SE...a journey through these seven shades.

Perhaps it's only poetic illusion and sweet madness, but if so - play on! I love this movie, Dil Se.

[Later I wrote a long review on this classic!]

DIL SE: A Metaphor for the Soul's Surrender to the God-within

Destined to be a classic, DIL SE is a truly brilliant beautiful film by Mani Ratnam, a creative genius and one of the greatest living film directors - and not just in India. Ratnam is right up there with the all time best: Michelangelo Antonioni's The Red Desert, Bernado Bertolucci's The Conformist, and Francois Truffaut's The Four Hundred Blows.

Most viewers think of DIL SE as a love story, but I saw it as the perfect metaphor for the Soul's surrender to God.

The hero falls in love with a girl he sees by chance one night in a lonely rural railway station. He has no idea that she is a terrorist and loses himself in love to her completely. It is my feeling that his relationship with this girl is purely metaphorical for the soul's ultimate surrender to God.

The idea that the soul must give up everything - including it's own illusory existence - to God is an idea found in both Sufism, Hinduism's Bhakti Yoga, and Christian mysticism. At the end of DIL SE, the Soul has become ONE with the Beloved. Their Sacred Union is immutable.

AR Rahman wrote the music in this film and the songs were enormously popular all around the world. People - like me - sang them even when they couldn't understand the Hindi lyrics. Rahman, also a genius, is acknowledged by musicians everywhere as one of the truly great composers of music in our times. Like so many millions, I love Rahman's music!

Rahman has a real genius for melody. He is said to be a Sufi. The words to the Rahman song CHAIYYA CHAIYYA and others are very Sufi:

He whose head is in the shadow of love
will have heaven beneath his feet.
Whose head is in the shadow of love...
Walk in the shadow.
Feet jingling (i.e., with anklets), walk in the shadow.
There's a friend who is like a sweet fragrance,
whose words are like poetry,
who is my evening, my night, my resurrection.
That friend is my beloved!

I don't believe this film is about terrorism. This extreme aberrant of the human experience is used as a dramatic environment to allow Mani Ratnam a creative `tour de force' to reveal one of life's great mysteries: Our eternal sense of separation and longing.

The unforgettable night scene up in the mountains set to haunting music and bathed in transcendental blue light is a cinematic classic. Alone at last with his beloved, for one sweet moment our love-struck hero melts her icy defenses. Intense close-ups fill the screen and invite us to journey into their eyes, their tender smiles, and subtle expressions.

He tells her that he likes `very much' that he can read nothing in her eyes, that there is so much hidden in her. Isn't this the relationship that we all have with the eternally silent, sphinx-like Cosmos? He says: `I like this distance between us the best. Without this distance, I would have no excuse to get close.'

Here Mani Ratnam expresses something deeper, something eternal about the human condition itself - the essence of what drives us all, the space that allows us the adventure into the unknown.

The pursuit of his elusive beloved - to the death - is not about some lovesick fool, but rather reflects the underlying universal reality of all our lives and what it means to be human, to long for something that seems to be always somehow beyond us.

***

In comparison to the empty, soulless, 'special effects' rubbish cranked out of bottom-line-Hollywood year after year, I loved DIL SE, yes, with all my heart.

The acting in the last scene of DIL SE is something I will never forget. Shahrukh Khan's volcanic presence often seems to bring out the best in the other actors. Manisha Koirala was awesome - perfect as the no-make-up mountain village girl. It takes a lot of confidence for a beautiful woman to allow herself to be photographed with so much pain written in her face.

At the end of the film our hero, beaten and bloody, approaches his beloved who has explosives hidden under her clothing. She has accepted her martyrdom and is headed for death.

He says: ""I once said I'd never leave you. I have come.""
Knowing she is a walking timebomb and concerned for his safety, she warns him to stay away. Determined to fulfill her suicide mission, she tries to get by him and he lunges, grabbing her arm.

He says: ""This is truth.""

He pulls her to him, holding her from behind, he can feel the explosives - but he doesn't care. He stopped caring about that long ago. He has made his decision.

He whispers to her, ""Don't come with me, if you don't want to.""

This is a male, with a high testosterone aggressive job, who has just been beaten up, escaped the terrorists and the Indian CIA, and beaten up another terrorist to find her - and he says passively, gently, ""Don't come with me, if you don't want to.""

Her eyes are wild with fear - she's freaking out now.

He whispers, holding her close, ""Take me with you.""

Once again, he is passive. He will not be the one to `take' her.
He is surrendering to her Will.

Again he says, ""Take me along.""

Here is a passive expression, again of surrender from a normally willful man.

He holds onto her, ever tighter. Her face is twisted by her anguish and pain, tears streaming down her cheeks. He turns her around to face him - tears in his eyes and blood on his face.

Again, ""Take me along.""

Once more begging her, his bloodstained bandaged hand reaches for hers and desperate to feel her touch, he places her hand on his face.

Once more, he begs her, ""Take me too along.""
Almost a mantra, `Take me along' is his expression of surrender to her...

And then he says, ""You love me. Just once, say that you love me.""

Again, ""Just once, say that you love me. Just once, say that you love me. Just once, say that you love me.""

Again a mantra of surrender...

Then, eye-to-eye, their faces very close now - he says, ""Say it just once!""

Their eyes are locked in a silence that for them must reflect the slowing of time, as they both know they have only a few seconds left of life.

She looks deeply into him and with the least possible motion, nods lovingly, teary eyed - a new tenderness comes into her face, her eyes shinning with love for such a brief moment. She moves her head gently to almost nestle into him - a subtle demonstration of her final surrender to him and his love for her, which has at last overpowered her.

They embrace - after enduring the pain of so long a separation. They are now completely ONE. And in what may be his greatest moment of acting genius, to my knowledge, Shahrukh makes a series of the most amazingly subtle and intelligent expressions I have ever seen.

In what can only be a few seconds, he makes a timeless expression of a profound and deeply felt acceptance of this their tragic moment - and in defiance of their fate and impinging death, he simultaneously holds onto her as if to protect her within the strength of his tender embrace and undying love, as they move together into Death.

His lips purse slightly, expressing a stubborn determination, a slight nod of the head, like shrugging your shoulders, in relinquishment of all control, giving in and giving up, while his eyes say - 'It was all worth it.'

His lips are barely touching her forehead, as she is hiding in his protective embrace, waiting, steeled against the next moment. He takes a small breath, his last, letting go of everything, of life itself. He closes his eyes on this his tear and blood stained face, for the final time - and the bomb goes off in a white explosion! The ultimate total surrender...

A.R. Rahman's music haunts you with these words:

Let me sleep in the lap of death!
Let me drown my body in your soul,
You of the many colors, of the many-colored soul.

Those of you who understand the idea of spiritual surrender in Bhakti Yoga and Sufism will love this film.

Santosh Sivan's camera work is, as the Planet Bollywood reviewer says is simply stunning. For those of us who will probably never visit Ladakh, Sivan's images will remain etched in our hearts, inspirational.

SRK's acting in this film was superb - at once a mix of his endearing, boyish vulnerability, tenderness, and wild explosive impulsiveness that characterize the intelligence of this immensely popular actor.

The critics often say this is A.R. Rahman's best film score.

Farah Khan's choreography is at its original imaginative heights. Who can forget the dance in SATRANGI RE, the stunning images of passionate anguish, `love is an uncontrollable fire'.

Love is an uncontrollable fire...
It cannot be started on a whim,
and cannot be extinguished if you try
Love is an uncontrollable fire...
Her eyes touched me like so - lightly, lightly,
and I was infatuated; it filled my heart.
You, only you, you are all the sweetness of living!
You are my longing, my longing itself
The flame of your body fires my breath; desire urges me onward.
My pain begins to understand its purpose:
You, only you... You are all the sweetness of living.
You, only you... You are my longing, longing itself!
You touch me like a whisper, your eyes softened by silence.
On the floor I make my prayers, some conscious, some unconscious.

Or SRK's contagious energy, igniting rhythms on top of that train dancing to CHAIYYA CHAIYYA. WAH! What a scene! Or tenderly protecting Manisha in the get-up-and-dance song, `the heart, it's a sweet hardship' DIL SE RE?

But I never felt like the lead heroine really wanted the hero. However, many people seem to have gotten DIL SE. If you are a SRK fan, and have never seen this movie, once is worth it.

If you have Amazon Prime, you can watch Dil Se streamed with English subtitles throughout.

When was the last time you danced on top of a moving train?

Dil Se (from the heart) is a love story but it is not typical classic Bollywood fare. Dil Se is an iconic, multi-layered mystery-thriller couched in Bollywood maxims and sets up conflicts and expectations that rarely surface in a traditional happy ending Bollywood tear jerker. I love many of the Bollywood classics and yet Dil Se has won me over through its powerfully unfolding story-line, its intricately riveting music and the longevity of the internal message of a firmly rooted people, resilient and expectant beyond the screen images that have been captured as timeless.

Independent India is the star! Major support comes from the colors of love experienced by the lead actors. Dil Se.

There is an ever present rawness that might be unexpected for those who have only seen Shah Rukh Khan in his signature romantic comedy/dramas. Rest assured, he does not disappoint in Dil Se. He is still as sexy as ever, amazingly romantic, and funny in moments that help during nail-biting flashpoints for the people in his life and the viewer. He powerfully delivers throughout Dil Ses breath-taking dramatic scenes.

Exciting to see Shah Rukh Khan (as Amar) at the center of a very different love triangle. This time his beloved India, marking 50 years of independence, shares space with the beautiful, secretive Meghna (masterfully portrayed by Manisha Koirala)a stranger Amar meets at a train station, and bubbly Preeti (introducing Preity Zinta), the safe, traditional exemplar of what could await Amar long term.

Amar is an executive/reporter with All India Radio. He is a man genuinely interested in how all Indian people feel about how things have evolved since India gained independence in 1947. Amars self-appointed presence is reminiscent of embedded journalists in war-torn countries during military campaigns. Amar willingly, deliberately seeks out events and locales that provide the viewer with visions beyond typical Bollywood romantic fare where at least one character lives in a palatial home, the product of wealth. Amar is not from old money. He does not have rich friends. He invites danger. He gets dirty. He rejects being rejected. He is believable in his role as a reporter for All India Radio. We do not see him interact with friends. However, he is from a close knit family and he has a strong work ethic.

Amars All India Radio gig literally takes him out of the office in search of national diverse voices regarding what Indian independence means to the people of India; Amars people. His relentless pursuit of love deftly matches his pursuit of diverse voices in this story of Indias independence. Dil Se. Villagers, soldiers, terrorists, co-workers, school children, family members, the men and women on the street  Amar can relate to them all in a way that is honest and heartfelt. Dil Se. That is because in his very public job, Amar becomes the backdrop to the story of Indias independence. He is the conduit documenting the narrative of a cross section of people, most of whom do not speak Hindi.

Amars charm, sense of humor, work ethic, persistence and keen intelligence are with him on every curve and tunnel presented to him. He seeks to expand his knowledge and his viewpoint on independence, always asking questions with the clear expectation of straightforward answers, ultimately realizing he is in constant danger on the professional front. The interweaving of his personal life and his professional life seems inevitable from the moment he goes in search of a match to light his cigarette near the beginning of Dil Se.

Enter Meghna. Like the fierce cold wind that ripped the long heavy shawl from her fetal-positioned body on a bench outside the train station, Amars immediate lock-step attraction to the mystery and beauty uncovered in that moment reveals an unexpected awakening he must reckon with; but how?  His quest begins. His admitted lust/love for Meghna sets him on an unforgiving, uncharted course. Who is she, really? Journey with Amar to find out. Be there when he declares his love for her, Dil Se. How does Meghna respond? Why?

Meanwhile, exactly where does Preeti fit into this love triangle? Preeti represents stability and comfort in her innocence. Her family and Amars family hope the two of them will get married. Preeti is practical and fully understands what she could bring to such a commitment while acknowledging her shortcomings. There is a freedom and simplicity running fluidly from Preeti to Amar, providing a calmness much like the bodies of water that are prominent in Jiya Jale.

Let the earthy grittiness, panoramic beauty, sensory serenity of the cinematography allow you to experience some of the essence that independence entails: expectations, disappointments, stoic commitment, life and death decision-making, beliefs revered, dreams realized, hearts broken, ongoing storied missions, and the endless review of progress as lived by the people of India.

Is Dil Se, indeed, a short love story as Amar wonders in his rain soaked trance at the train station or a deeper, longer narrative on loves place in the dialogue on Indian Independence?

From the pulsating love/rock anthem Chaiyya Chaiyya to the exotically seductive Satarangi Re the picturized musical numbers are visually stunning. Expect to be mesmerized, thrown off balance and rendered out of breath as if you were singing and dancing in a parallel universe alongside the actors and dancers in Dil Se.

If you are ready for an edgy, exotic, poetic picture of love, let the director, actors, composer, lyricist, musicians, dancers, choreographer, playback singers and cinematographer of Dil Se take you on a train ride within the framework of Indias independence at the 50-year mark you will long remember.

Once you have experienced and processed the end of Dil Se, watch Chaiyya Chaiyya again. Get back on top of that moving train.

SPECIAL NOTE for A. R. Rahman fans (and future fans): Head over to YouTube for the 2014 celebration of Rahmans work and treat yourself to the Berklee Indian Ensemble from Berklee College of Music and their exciting, inspiring cover of his Jiya Jale from Dil Se.

1847859,5,B00008IAJV,"Recently, I've been on a Bollywood movie binge, revisiting many old favorites, and some recent hits (e.g. Fanaa, Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, etc.). I watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dilwale-Dulhania-Le-Jayenge/dp/B00006AW5T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</a>&nbsp;and Dil Se yesterday and it reminded me why I love these Bollywood musicals/dramas so much - they are pure poetry and magic!

""Dil Se"" was not a hit when it was first released in India in 1998, though it gained a credible measure of success overseas. It is not just a romance (and a tragic one at that) but also a politically-themed movie, focusing on the troubled North-Eastern region of India, including Assam. Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) plays Amar, an All-India Radio journalist who visits the North-Eastern region in India to interview a terrorist leader about his motivations and aims. At a train station, he encounters a lovely yet troubled young woman, Meghna (Manisha Koirala) - this sets in motion a dangerous love affair, one which profoundly affects Amar and Meghna who is hiding a very dark secret that makes it impossible for her to get too close to anyone.

The themes of tragic love, loyalty to a cause, and terrorism are deftly dealt with in the movie, though admittedly the mix of politics and romance at times gets a bit too much. The main stars are credible in their performances, especially Ms. Koirala's portrayal of the deeply conflicted Meghna. Manisha Koirala may have faded into obscurity but she was once one of the leading ladies in Bollywood and some of her most memorable movies are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1942-A-Love-Story/dp/B000IZJQR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1942 A Love Story</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bombay/dp/B00008UALP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bombay</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akele-Hum-Akele-Tum/dp/B000CGX874/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akele Hum Akele Tum</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agni-Sakshi/dp/B000FLXUPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agni Sakshi</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Khamoshi-The-Musical/dp/B000MCH08G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Khamoshi - The Musical</a>.

1847861,4,B00008IAJV,"I am a recent lover of Bollywood and SRK. When I got this movie I read about the different depths of love on the back cover and the reviews about 'magic' etc.
I was unprepared for how powerful this movie is - and that includes quite a bit of violence and a lot of emphasis on terrorism and martyrdom.
The love depicted is of the tragic, almost unrequited kind. It is more about infatuation and obsession and a confusion of pain and love. It isn't one of the light Bollywoods and it doesnt have a happy ending (sorry for the spoiler).
The acting was generally excellent and Shahrukh Khan superlative in all the aspects of character he played; the dancing, sensuality and acting. The photography was often breathtaking. The well-known song Chaiyya Chaiyya is not only incredibly catchy but the dance is one of the most memorable Bollywood numbers so far I've seen.
The film quality at the beginning is a bit dodgy but it does improve and change throughout the movie.
I guess it deserved 5 as it is so well done. I am dropping it a star as it wasn't what I was lead to expect given the back cover and general description. It was a bit harrowing rather than uplifting as I was hoping. But then if this is your style this may not bother you.
I am Australian and not Indian but a Sri Lankan lady told me recently that she likes Bollywood movies as 'they don't burden the mind'. Well I found my mind a bit burdened after this one.",1223164800,,1423,4.373584905660377
1847862,5,B00008IAJV,"For people not brought up on Indian films, this might be a bit of a stretch - but set aside your expectations and you might be blown away by this one. The story: The portrayal of the inner world of terrorists is very convincing and consistent with recent research (the peer group pressure being the strongest influence on suicide bombers). More than that, it's a powerful liebestod, a love-death story of life in the midst of war. The music by AR Rahman: amazing. The dancing: this is what first caught my attention; it's simply astonishing. The choreographer Farah Khan seamlessly melds classical Indian and European styles, Sufi, and Western modern dance from Duncan to Tharp. She can do anything, and so can these performers. And throughout the film there is fabulous cinematography in service to the music, dance, plots and subplots - and doing justice to the beautiful scenery of Ladakh. Acting: Superb by all. Now to the negatives... if you're not used to Indian films you must relax and let go of your expectations. The integration of different moods (from silliness to tragedy) isn't something we're used to anymore (though you find plenty of that in, say, Shakespeare) - but this juxtaposition is unavoidable and constant in real life, as Indians know. Then there's the length: reset your inner time clock. Scenes go on longer and sometimes the acting seems over the top. Like most Hindi movies it's long (remember the fuss about that when the movie Gandhi came out?) but this length (as with that other great movie) allows an experience that goes deeper that we're used to, too. Altogether, this struck me (as a longtime film buff) as an extraordinarily original film: a masterpiece on all fronts.",1204502400,4,1707,4.889655172413793

1847864,4,B00008IAJV,"Before watching ""Dil Se.."" (""From the Heart"") the closest I had come to seeing a Bollywood movie was ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bride-and-Prejudice/dp/B00094AS9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bride and Prejudice</a>,"" which had the virtue of being in English.  However, if you are not reading the subtitles because the characters are speaking (and singing) in Hindi, then it does not really count.  I picked ""Dil Se.."" for my first true Bollywood experience for the simple reason that it has the song ""Chaiyya Chaiyya"" in it.  I first heard the song in the opening sequence of Spike Lee's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-Man/dp/B000GFLKF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside Man</a>,"" and finally downloaded it.  Discovering that it was originally in this 1998 film I decided to find out what the catchy song is all about.  The joke ended up being on me because watching the movie only gave me a vague inkling on that score and I had to head to the Internet to satisfy my curiosity.

I remember hearing that the great thing about Bollywood movies was that when you went to the theater and wanted to see a musical or a romance or an action film or any other genre, that is exactly what you were going to see regardless of which theater you walked into.  Now I know what they meant.  Amarkanth Varma (Shahrukh Khan) runs into Meghna (Manisha Koirala), and is immediately smitten by her.  But they go their separate ways and he bemoans the shortest love story of all time before the film launches into the big ""Chaiyya Chaiyya"" production number:

He whose head is in the shadow of love
Will have heaven beneath his feet
Whose head is in the shadow of love
Walk in the shadow.
Walk in heaven, walk in the shadow.

There's a friend who is like a sweet fragrance,
Whose words are like poetry
Who is my evening, my night, my existence.
That friend is my beloved!

Amar works for All India Radio and has been sent from New Delhi to the northern provinces where he starts finding out about a separatist group engaging in acts of terrorism to secure a free and independent state.  When it comes to politics Amar knows nothing, and he gets quite an education in that regard in this movie.  I have only a general understanding of the disputed areas of Kashmir and Jammu, and it seems to be that the film is using the politics as a dramatic backdrop rather than actually taking a stand on the issues (the plague on both their houses would be another way in which ""Dil Se.."" is reminiscent of ""Romeo & Juliet"").  Meanwhile, Amar's obsession for Meghna is failing to make much of an impression on the mysterious woman, who hints at a tragic past that forestalls the possibility of love.  The assumption that the political and romantic elements of the film are intertwined is correct, but like Amar we have to wait for things to be spelled out for us before it is clear how everything comes together.  There is also your standard love triangle complication when Amar becomes engaged to Preity (Preity Zinta), who seems to be everything that Meghna is not, in ways both good and bad.

That is the basic set up of the film, which leads to fist fights and explosions, shouting and weeping, singing and dancing, and the proverbial much much more.  There are only five songs in ""Dil Se..,"" but each is a major production and since they are not translated how they add to or comment upon the action is completely lost on me (even now that I have sought out translations of the songs on the Internet).  They almost function more like commercials, providing breaks in the narrative, and there is a sense in which the story would be more riveting without the musical digressions.  It would also be a lot less fun, which is of some consequence in a film that runs 2 hours and 43 minutes.  I do not know how representative of Bollywood director Mani Ratnam's film might be, and I am only now become aware of the requisite stages from ""hub"" (attraction) to ""maut"" (death) are key to the formula, which only tells me that the happy ever after ending of ""Bride & Prejudice"" may well be another aberration from the Bollywood model.  Just do not ask me what American movie most reminds me of this entertaining conglomerate of cinematic elements because I seriously do not have a clue.",1179446400,13,4338,4.840324763193505
1847865,3,B00008IAJV,"The delay in the subtitles is maddening - by the end of the film you've learned the timing and can sort out who says what relatively well.  I agree with the other reviewer that was dismayed with the lack of subtitles for the musical numbers - a great loss for those of us who aren't fluent in the spoken dialects.

Sadly, this is the worst transfer to video/dvd of a modern film I've ever seen - there were points where the sound cut out, and there were spots and lines on the film as though it had been reeled a thousand times. (This isn't a criticism typical of Indian/Bollywood films, as I've seen many others...)

Most of the dvd menus don't work (the main one does though, thankfully), but I was able to get around by using the return and menu buttons on my remote.

7984319,5,B00008IAJV,"This is not a love story. This is a story about emotions which are much darker and stronger than love.

The main character, Amar, is a radio journalist, who becomes obsessed with a beautiful woman he sees at a train station, Meghna. Amar stalks her. (This process is illustrated with a stunning soundtrack and gorgeously choreographed dance scenes). Amar ignores Meghna's rejections. He follows her home. He follows her to Ladakh. He physically grabs her and says that her rejections make him so mad that he'd like to ""wring her neck and kill her"". Amar does scary things and calls them ""love"". Meghna disappears without a trace.

When Meghna returns to Amar, is it because she loves him? Or is it because she is now more obsessed and more desperate than he is?

Meghna and Amar damage everyone they touch. Meghna cracks the romantic dreams of Amar's potential bride and brings police to his family home. Amar's pursuit of Meghna leads to the death of at least one of her compatriots, and injures an elderly schoolteacher. Meghna has been surrounded by violence and fear since childhood, and that she intends to bring death and fear to all of India. Amar's toxic obsession pulls him deeper and deeper into the violent events that surround her.

This is not a story about love. It's a story about obsession, desperation, and fear.",1477526400,2,1329,4.790393013100437

He's great!  Dil Se is not a light hearted movie. The ending is so sad.",1474848000,3,243,3.7450980392156863
7984325,5,B00008IAJV,"DIL SE is a fantastic movie.
  * BE AWARE though of the differences in the company who is offering their brand of the movie; the movie brand, NOT the individual seller.  I ordered a copy of DIL SE which happened to be offered by another company and the particular DVD was somewhat defective.  I ordered another copy which happened to be offered MOSERBAER and the particular DVD was not defective, however MOSERBAERs offering is so bad that I will never buy another MOSERBAER DVD.  Again these are not the individual sellers as both were great sellers.  MOSERBAER s DVD had their name on screen throughout the entire movie!  Sometimes it was very light but still there.  Seeing their name very noticeably on screen the ENTIRE time is very distracting.  That distracted especially during the number, Chaiyya Chaiyya (hit song and also featured in Spike Lees Inside Man (2006), among others).  MOSERBAERs picture quality was noticeably poor, with a flickering vertical line on the right side appearing more often than not throughout the movie.  Also, while I do not know Hindi, MOSERBAERs translation subtitles seemed to be inferior to those of the other company, even to the point of confusing.  Lesson is do NOT buy a movie where the offering company is MOSERBAER; very much a waste.
  Again, DIL SE is fantastic.  It is a 1998 romantic war-thriller film in Northeast India, co-written and directed by Mani Ratnam, and produced by Mani Ratnam, Ram Gopal Varma, and Shekhar Kapur. The film stars Shahrukh Khan and Manisha Koirala in lead roles while Preity Zinta (in her film debut and also a great performance!) appears in a supporting role.
  DIL SE is a journey through the seven phases of love that are defined in Arabic literature. The shades are: attraction, infatuation, love, reverence, worship, obsession, and death. Shahrukh Khan passes through each phase during the film.",1474675200,3,1880,4.955271565495208

If this movie was made in Hollywood, it would have won a dozen Oscars and be on every list of the 20th century's greatest films.",1474588800,,297,4.137931034482759
