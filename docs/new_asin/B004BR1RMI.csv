4319970,1,B004BR1RMI,In B&W and shot in the late forties.  Very sexist with much too cute narration.  Very degrading to the native people.,1370217600,,117,4.523809523809524
4319971,5,B004BR1RMI,"I enjoyed watching ""Under the Red Sea"" very much, however I prefer ""Under the Caribbean"" (German title ""Unternehmen Xarifa"") even more. It received an Academy award in 1959 for extraordinary underwater photography (the movie was already produced in 1954).

For everybody who is interested in ""Under the Caribbean"", just order it from amazon.de. It's on a double DVD edition called ""Hans Hass Klassik-Edition"" and has English subtitles. There are 3 more movies included, ""Under the Red Sea"" being one of them and two black & white movies about Hass' early diving experiences in 1942 (Pirsch unter Wasser) and 1947 (Menschen unter Haien).

Hans Hass was one of the diving pioneers who were not even afraid of confronting sharks or whales.

Very recommendable for all fans of early underwater photography!",1332979200,5,802,5.2015503875969
4319972,5,B004BR1RMI,"I first saw this film in a theater in the small town of Hollis, Oklahoma in 1951. For some reason my parents decided to drive in from our farm some 20 miles away to take in the film and I still remember (I was 6 years old at the time) being absolutely mesmerized by the sights and sounds of this black and white movie about diving in the Red Sea. This movie had a tremendous impact on my life and served as the impetuous for an interest in diving which led to a job as a commercial diver and eventually to cave diving and a lifelong career in speleology.  While dated I was very pleased to finally get to see this film again after so many years and to marvel at Dr. Hass' use of oxygen re-breathers at depths far beyond their recommended use. For those who think that self contained diving and underwater documentary films was born with Cousteau (a true diving pioneer)this DVD is a must see. A diving classic.",1321228800,3,910,4.290697674418604

8422185,3,B004BR1RMI,"The documentary has some historical value but little to teach us today about the sea. They go about destroying the coral reef they're swimming in and spearing harmless animals like manta rays, which they view as some menacing monsters. Basically they look at sea animals as being out to get them so they have to jump in with spearguns ready. It's interesting to see the change in attitude towards the sea and marine life and I'm glad we're beyond that now.",1452988800,,456,4.6419753086419755

8422189,3,B004BR1RMI,"Got to love the absolute sexist comments like "" Could she handle a camera,  a mere woman? ""
Very dated and on the edge of racists half the time. Poorly shot and cheesy monologue.  Worth watching for a laugh.",1418083200,,207,4.282051282051282
