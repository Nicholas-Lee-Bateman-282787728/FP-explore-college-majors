6760844,5,B00OU27WIC,"This is an insider's view of the rock 'n roll scene of the late 60s, of course, focusing on the legendary Jimi Hendrix. Andre Benjamin absolutely captures the voice and spirit of Jimi Hendrix and most of the guitar-playing shots prove that he did his research and study on Hendrix's performing, as well. It was a nice surprise to see that the film ended before Jimi's very early death, so no one will go away remembering the ending of this film as a downer.

One problem: there was WAY, WAY too much tobacco drug use in the film. Sure, these people were tobacco addicts, but they weren't constantly satisfying their addiction, as was depicted in the film. For those who say, ""Well, they smoked back then,"" well, they also used the restroom, too, but I don't remember seeing a single depiction of THAT!",1418774400,2,801,4.601398601398602
6760845,3,B00OU27WIC,"It is hard to review this movie because it exists in a difficult category of films. Because Jimi Hendrix was such an extraordinary person any film that tries to depict him is starting off with an almost impossible task to begin with. This film proves that point.

  Somehow the film's main proponent, John Ridley, got in his mind that London model and Hendrix discoverer Linda Keith somehow needed historical justice and made her the center of the film. The first year of Hendrix's discovery in New York and fame in England is then re-oriented to make Linda Keith the muse and central godmother of Jimi and his career. This comes at the expense of not only historical accuracy, but also Jimi's main girlfriend for the period Kathy Etchingham, who was more justly the real woman who occupied that role. On her website Kathy points out the errors and inaccuracies committed by Ridley who never even bothered to consult her. Her website is worth looking at to see an insider's view of what is wrong with this movie. I can't imagine how it must feel to see your main claim to fame and personal self so recklessly portrayed on the big screen. Meanwhile Ms Etchingham says Linda Keith was gone after the first day and banned by Chas Chandler for attacking Kathy and Jimi with his guitar. Though I personally admire Linda and her role in discovering Jimi, accuracy is accuracy. Also, Ridley commits another historical reduction by having Jimi scar Kathy's face in a brutal beating with a telephone.

  Part of the problem is this film was viewed through the screen of Jimi's image as it was created over the years. So it conveys a book-read image of Jimi and the overall idea of Hendrix as it came to be known through the years. Because of this Ridley inserts an imaginary person named Ida into the script who never existed. Ida is supposed to be representative of Devon Wilson, Jimi's New York African American girlfriend and assistant. Ridley is also black so I imagine he wanted to represent Jimi's black side into a time and place that was mostly surrounded by British people. He revised Kathy and Jimi's meeting with British black power personality Michael X into one with Ida and Jimi where they had a philosophical discussion on race relations. Kathy said the true description of the event was Michael X was an aggressive demagogue who chided Jimi for having a white girlfriend after he realized his sales pitch for donations wasn't working.

  I don't want to be too hard on this movie because I kind of liked the subdued, spare aspect to its style. It was sort of a melancholy window into the R&B genre that acheived a kind of artistic dream-like peek into Jimi's breakthrough years. However this time-formed overview comes at the cost of the real and flowery actual goings on of the period Ridley covers. The worst offense committed by this movie is how this melancholy time-gotten perspective replaces the actual flowery and enthusiastic burgeoning of Hendrix in England that was a mad explosion of music, rock experience, and color. Because the Hendrix company disallowed Ridley use of Jimi's music this frenzied touring and awe-striking emergence of a paradigm-changing musical genius wasn't covered as adequately as it should have been. Where the movie should have launched into musical catharsis it ended up descending into passable noodlings by an inadequately cast studio guitarist. Instead the film concentrates on a more confined personal side of Jimi, which is deep and worth coverage, but doesn't quite do justice to all Jimi was about at the time. And that is the main problem of the movie. Still though, for real Hendrix fans, because Jimi was so deep, that aspect and dimension is worthy of coverage and does have its own tale. Because of that limitation, whether intentional or not, Ridley's hindsight filters Jimi's blues tragedy and how Jimi's internalization of his fated destiny and mission is played out in his interactions and doings - even if Ridley's style comes at the expense of accuracy. This is the true source of Ridley's dire, melancholy portrayal whether he's aware of it or not.

  There's some fundamental problems with this movie. Ridley decided to pigeon hole Jimi by transferring him into a present day film form. Because Jimi was such a unique and powerful person he automatically defies being constrained that way. Ridley is aware of that so he tries to limit his approach to the subtle whispering Jimi. An ephemeral, essential, philosophical, and esoteric aspect which he almost pulls off. But really, in the end, Jimi was so powerful a figure that what is omitted is strong enough to make its lack of presence known as well as its conspicuous cost to the production. It just leaves us demanding that a high quality production be made that goes and seeks to cover this missing aspect in respectful and dedicated style. That's the Jimi factor and it won't be shorted or denied. God help any director who underestimates the task of making a true Hendrix film. At least the movie's quick cameo of Michael Jeffery covers him correctly and gives hints of his dark side.

  My personal gripe with this movie is that it was not only the first major Hendrix bio-picture but was also the first film to come out following the major revelations about Jimi's death circulating in the media. The period this film covers is about as far from the political matters involved with Jimi's death as you could possibly get. Jimi was in England on his best behavior and concentrating on trying to make it in the music industry. This movie is the opposite, apolitical pole from the most important parts of Jimi and his life, and, more importantly, the things listed in his FBI file. The movie that is begging to be made is one that covers the epic tragedy of the true definition of Jimi and his life. His spiritual, religious, messianic journey and ultimate crucifixion by Michael Jeffery and the powers that be. This movie is an artsy, petty soap opera, typical of our day, being offered at a time when the epic tale of Jimi and his tragic fate is being called for. Give us the thunder.",1418256000,8,6106,4.785375118708452
6760846,2,B00OU27WIC,"I guess this is part 1. The film starts out with Hendrix playing as ""Jimmy James and the Blue Flames"" to empty nightclubs in New York. Hendrix (Andr&eacute; Benjamin) is shy, unsure, and inarticulate. Linda Keith (Imogen Poots), model and Keith Richard's girlfriend, is the only one who recognizes Hendrix's guitar magic. After she introduces Jimi to acid, she convinces him to ""do his own thing"" at which time he gets discovered and goes to London to mixed reviews.

Hendrix is shown as a stoner who beats up his girlfriend while talking about peace. The film ends before Monterey, leaving us never hearing the songs we associate with Hendrix. At times the film felt like it was more about Linda Keith than Hendrix. Some of the events in Hendrix's life are in dispute. This gives us one version and not the one on Wikipedia.

I was slightly disappointed.

6760847,4,B00OU27WIC,"""Jimi: All Is By My Side"" (2013 release from the UK; 118 min.) brings the story of Jimi Hendrix's year before he rockets to mega-stardom. The movie opens with a quick scene from London's Saville Theatre, June 4, 1967, where Jim is about to play a gig. We then go back a year, as we see Jimi toiling away in the Cheetah Club in NY as a rhythm guitarist in an anonymous band. By sheer coincidence, in the audience is Linda (Keith Richards' then-girlfriend) and she takes an interest in Jimi. It's not long before Jimi is tempted to come to London, with the promise of headlining gigs and making records. Jimi lands in London on September 22, and that same day still meets Kathy, a beautiful redhead. At this point we're maybe 15-20 min. into the movie. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, this movie is written and directed by John Ridley, best known for his Oscar-winning script for ""12 Years A Slave"". Second, much has been made about the fact that the Hendrix estate did not allow for any Hendrix-written songs to be featured in the movie. In fact, this may have been a blessing in disguise, as now the movie focuses on Jimi ""Almost Famous"", and we get a much better insight in the man and the making of the Experience, while still getting some great musical nuggets too (more on that later). Why is it that Hendrix moved to London? How did the Experience form exactly? You'll find it all here in this movie. Third, the performance of Andre Benjamin (better known as Andre 3000 of OutKast) will absolutely floor you. You see him and you absolutely believe it is Jimi. He brings the role with a relaxed but confident flair. At one point, when asked about how he feels, Hendrix responds ""We're broke but we're cool"", ha! Hayley Atwell (best know for her role as Peggy Carter in the Marvel franchise of movies), is equally up to the task as Kathy (the real-life Kathy, incidentally, has decried the movie as 'pure fiction'). Fourth, so we do not get Hendrix-penned songs, but there is still PLENTY of musical performances in the movie such as his cover of ""Wild Thing"" (which plays in the middle of the movie and again over the end titles). There's another famous cover that plays in the June, '67 Saville show (I won't spoil...), and of course lots of jamming. Last but not least, if you are a fan of music history, you owe it to yourself to check this out. Sure, a lot if not most is fictionalized, but I couldn't stop marveling at the overall feel of the movie, including of course the 'Swinging Sixties"" that was London then. The attention to details is exquisite (at one point, Jimi and Kathy are listening to the radio. BBC? Of course not! Radio Caroline! ah, the memories).

""Jimi: All By My Side"" opened without any pre-release fanfare or warning last month at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. I couldn't believe my luck and went to see it right away (as it turned out, it only played for a week). The matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great, which is a shame. There is a LOT to like about this movie, and I'd suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, or on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Jimi: All By My Side"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1415145600,7,3275,4.484087102177554

6760881,2,B00OU27WIC,"Previous biopics of Jimi Hendrix have been comic at best and they never seem to capture him. This one staring Andre Benjamin and made by the acclaimed African-American Director John Ridley of 12 Years a Slave Fame was at least an original take on the life of Jimi Hendrix but it's more like something the BBC would have made in the 1950's.  Perhaps Ridley felt some vendetta that Hendrix sold out.  It shows Hendrix's discovery in New York's Greenwich Village his time in England, leading to his acclaimed performance in the US at the Monterey Pop Festival where he became a worldwide star.  None of the music of Jimi Hendrix is featured as it isn't authorised by the Hendrix Estate. But session giant Waddy Watchel ( Stevie Nicks, Warren Zevon, Jackson Brown, Iggy Pop) does an admirable job of providing some atmospheric Hendrix flourishes. It is very well filmed and edited, and Andre Benjamin is very impressive and convincing as Jimi Hendrix. However this is wasted, as most of the actors struggle with a poor script and most of the story is fiction refuted by people who knew him. His time in Greenwich village is rather one dimensional, when he already had is own band The Blue Flames and knew a number of musicians, and influential people, including John Hammond Jnr. He tries to depict Hendrix being involved with Michael X and the Black house in Holloway London, which is fictional, he was seen maybe in The Mangrove when it opened in ""68.  In fact John Ridley should know about this era in London at the time considering he produced the recent drama Guerilla for Sky Atlantic. The best bio pic is the 1973 Joe Boyd film featuring great Hendrix performances and interviews with friends, family and associates. And for a take on the Greenwich village era, black politics, and what it was like to live in the late 1960's, I'd recommend the biography by Greenwich Village author David Henderson who did meet Hendrix while he was alive. The biopic of the future is still yet to made and considering his enormous talent and influence, I wish someone would do him some justice.",1492041600,,2081,4.7245179063360885

6760902,2,B00OU27WIC,"On the positive side, Andre Benjamin (Andre 3000) is great as Jimi Hendrix. He has the mannerisms and the dialect down perfect.  Sometimes when he speaks you think its actually Jimi. Andre even fakes a good left hand guitar technique. Kudos to Andre 3000, and even more kudos to whoever cast him!

On the less than positive side, the movie is a challenge to watch. In many places the pacing is painfully slow and could benefit from some editing.  Several pregnant pauses could be shorter.  The majority of the acting is subdued and laidback; so laidback its behind itself! There are also many scenes utilizing a hand held camera which results in a lot of movement and shaking of the frame  very distracting. Even the color of the film is muted. I don't know if is the type of film stock used, but the film seems overcast. Maybe thats just London. The one splash of color and illumination comes near the end when Jimi makes his triumphal appearance at the Saville and he takes the stage under bright lights wearing a yellow jacket. It feels like cataracts have been removed from your eyes and you can see again.

There is a particular scene that musicians should appreciate. Starting around 12:30 Jimi is on stage playing with his band, and the drummer drops a stick. The musicians may have actually been playing and their performances used in the film. The drop and reaction seem genuine. That was the one scene I could relate to!

There are no extras related to Jimi. The one bit included in the special features is an interview with Waddy Wachtel, the guy who supplied the music, and he ends up talking more about his signature guitar. It would have been appreciated to have some kind of information about this time period in Jimis life.

This film will have a hard time finding its audience. True fans have ripped it, the casual fan will learn little, and the main stream soccer moms/dads won't have time to endure it.  To me, this project does more for Andre Benjamins legacy. Perhaps a more definitive biopic will be available someday.",1466035200,,2040,4.644444444444445

6760917,4,B00OU27WIC,"Jimi: All Is By My Side XLRator Media 2013 Rated R DVD version
I don't know why it took so long to make a documentary about Jimi Hendrix.  It ostensibly covers just about one year in his life, 1966-67, from his discovery by Keith Richardss girlfriend, being brought to London, signed up with a manager, given a decent backup band, until just before his return to the United States to play at the Monterey Pop music festival, However through the use of some archival photographs and flashbacks we see brief glimpses of his earlier life.  So although the film is mostly linear in narrative, it makes use of flashbacks, voiceovers and complex transitions to give a slightly psychedelic feel, suitable to the era.  If you're hoping to see a lot of Hendrix performing on stage, this is not really the movie for you.  The multi-disc documentary of the Monterey pop festival is a good place to start for that.  This is a more personal look at his life, which as with many of our cultural icons isn't always pretty.  There are brief snatches of Hendrix-like music throughout, but the longest continual piece of music comes at the end, which is a good portion of Wild Thing.
Although there are a number of important figures in his life in this London year, the central dyad of the film has to be Hendrix and Linda (Imogen Poots) and perhaps the dramatic peak of the film is an argument between the two of them in which she says something like, You know you cant just rely on your genius
Boy, most of the reviewers hated this movie.  I didn't think it was bad.  Lets consider some of the criticisms: 1. It does not depict the truth.  Yes, its a docu-drama, so you cant necessarily tell from watching it where truth leaves off and fiction intrudes.  But the overall takeoff of his career seems accurate.  2.  That half or more of the dialog is mumbled and what you can make out makes him sound like a moronic mystic.  Well I am a big fan of sub-titling and unfortunately there IS NO SUB TITLING in this film, but even so I caught enough of the dialog for it to stay interesting.  I think the snippets of conversation you cant make out, you probably weren't MEANT to make outjust like in real life when multiple conversations are taking place simultaneously, especially if its against a background of loud music.  3.  That it mis-portrays his character.  Not having known Hendrix personally Im not an adequate judge of that but will take the word of people who did know him that the film does not capture the nuances of his personality faithfully.  4.  That making a movie about Hendrix without including his actual music is like making a movie about Bruce Lee with no martial arts scenes.  Nice point and I alluded to that above in referring the reader elsewhere to hear his music.  Nobody else can play guitar quite the way he did, but other reviewers seem to agree that Benjamin does a good job capturing the look and mannerisms of Hendrix.  Further observations:  I don't know what the budget for this was but it was hardly comparable to Transformers: Age of Ultron.  When you don't even have subtitles, you know it has to be a low budget.  Some of the shortcomings may come down to the budget.  2.  If you like to own a disc you may as well pick up a DVD copy and not waste dollars on the Blu-Ray version, as this is not a visually spectacular film where youd find yourself wishing you could see it in high definition.  3.  Some people seem destined for certain things.  It certainly seems like Hendrix was born to play guitar.  This film is trying to capture a very brief slice of his life: the initial exponential rise in his career, from obscure backup player to a rising star in London, just before he became a worldwide sensation.  If you don't know the story and keep in mind that not all the details in the film are accurate, I think its worth watching.",1447113600,5,3853,4.491379310344827

I read that they never told the girlfriend portrayed in this film that they were making this movie. She heard about certain scenes and said they were lies.

6760959,2,B00OU27WIC,"To call Jimi: All Is by My Side a bio-pic might be misleading. The film only covers about one year of Jimi Hendrixs life, from 1966 to 67. You are not going to see his live at Monterey. You are not going to hear Purple Haze, either. In fact, all the guitar performances are done by someone else. But the films biggest problem is not about these things.

Writer / director John Ridley, who won Oscar for his screenplay for 12 Years a Slave, successfully re-creates the atmosphere of the mid-1960s London, with effective photography and credible performance from Andr Benjamin as Jimi Hendrix, but with the disjoined narrative, the film itself offers little insight into Jimi as a person or artist.

I know the real-life Kathy Etchingham (played by Hayley Atwell in the film) strongly objects to the films content. Well, I don't know to what extent this film is historically accurate, and I really don't care much. But I do care whether the film is interesting or not as a drama, and there I am disappointed.

After all, the film doesnt know what story to tell about the legendary musician. The live sequences (like the Sgt. Pepper scene) are effectively done, but do we really need them when we have the real Jimi Hendrix live performances?",1436400000,,1239,4.674311926605505
6760960,3,B00OU27WIC,"Oscar winner John Ridley (""12 Years a Slave""), adds the director title in addition to screenwriter on this over-long film that focuses on a brief period of Jimi Hendrix's life.  Primarily a session guitarist, he had the opportunity to go to London in 1966, where he was able to break away and form his own band (The Jimi Hendrix Experience).  Guided initially by Linda Keith (Imogen Poots) who was best known at the time being The Rolling Stones' Keith Richard's girlfriend.  While they never get intimate, it's clear they have an attraction to each other.  But she wants to get past the rock star girlfriend phase.  She does hook Hendrix up with Chas Chandler, who was the ""Animals"" drummer and is now looking to manage a group.

Things seemed to be heading in the right direction until Jimi (excellent performance by Andre Benjamin) begins a romantic relationship with Kathy Etchingham (Hayley Atwell).  Drugs and partying begin to play a roll.  Still Hendrix is an obvious star.  Ridley even has a scene where Chandler, friendly with Eric Clapton (Danny McColgan), arranges for Jimi to sit in with his avowed hero.  At this point Clapton is part of Cream with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.  After Hendrix plays a few licks, Clapton cowers offstage and later says, ""Is he really that good?""  OMG, how stupid a scene.

And if that isn't bad enough, later Benjamin who has played Hendrix properly as a shy but confident performer, must attack and beat Kathy senseless with a telephone.  I don't believe either of these incidents happened as they seem so out of character, even within the film itself.  The other annoying fact that becomes evident in the film is that Hendrix never performs any original material, only doing covers.  I understand that the Hendrix estate refused the rights to Hendrix songs.  Too bad.

The film is tolerable only due to Andre Benjamin's fine performance.  The film ends as Hendrix is about to leave London for the Monterrey music festival in 1967.  The rest is history, brief though it was.",1436227200,,2021,4.819767441860465

6760962,3,B00OU27WIC,"Andre Benjamin is outstanding in this film. He's underrated as an actor, so it was great to see him carry this entire film so successfully. Sadly, the Hendrix estate is so badly managed that access to his music was not possible, a real absence in this film - and a massive disservice to Jimi Hemdrix's musical legacy.

6760963,3,B00OU27WIC,"This movie is, at best, only ok. I'd heard that Jimi had jammed with Eric Clapton, but I couldn't remember if it was Jimi that had asked to jam with Eric or Eric who had asked to jam with Jimi. In any case, I'd imagined it was just a group of musicians playing together without an audience. So I definitely learned something in seeing Jimi asking to play with Eric's band during a concert.
I suppose it is only to be expected to see how Jimi used women and disposed of them -- which I'm given to believe is typical of rock stars. But, on the other hand, I've never had women throw themselves at me. I would like to think I'd act differently, but I'll never know.",1435881600,,662,4.1796875

Most of the complaints have to do with historical accuracy, and this is where Etchingham has the biggest gripe, and rightly so given the personal depiction. However, most of it actually does check out (save for a couple graphic incidents) even if it falls short of something resembling actual footage. If you want more of the real thing there are a couple real good documentaries and a bunch of live performances available -- check out the ""Jimi Hendrix"" doc and ""Hear My Train A Comin'.""

The complete lack of either real or recreated Hendrix music was crazy, and the actor that played Jimi was one of the worst I have ever seen at miming the playing of a guitar, sliding up on the neck when the actual guitar that someone else was playing moved down and vice versa.  None of Hendrix's trademark humor and wit came through, or his incessant, basically non stop 24/7 playing of the guitar since he was a child that accounted in part for his amazing virtuosity on that instrument. A uniquely awful film with nothing to recommend it.  Instead, watch (and hear) the real Jimi's music and persona in the documentary, JIMI HENDRIX: HEAR MY TRAIN A' COMIN'.  That is a 5 star gem of a biographical film with tons of (short unfortunately) clips of many of his iconic live recordings that you know note for note from listening to them thousands of times on vinyl and CD if you are a fan.

I could be wrong, but I believe the Monterey show in '67 is where he lights his guitar on fire.  How can you possibly do a movie about the rise and fall of Hendrix without some of his signature shows?  Or the lack of the making of several of his studio albums and his tenacity for perfection.

I have read a lot of the available books about him and I thankfully saw him in concert when I was a young man. The only fact is that he left a fantastic amount of music for us to study and ponder but he was a mess as an individual and this movie did portray that at least. I know that liberties were taken in the script and the whole truth will never be displayed in a movie about him. The acting in this one was good but again not a perfect depiction of a great artist. I am afraid that even when the ""family"" finally agres to make a movie about him they will white wash everything and that won't be accurate either. I enjoyed watching this film but I take it all with a grain of salt.

6760990,1,B00OU27WIC,"that is the disclaimer at the beginning of this movie. well, they should have tried harder.
first of all, my personal opinion is that if they couldn't get the rights to any of jimi's music, they should have just killed the project. it's like making a biographical movie about bruce lee, and not including any martial arts in the film. what's the point?
the point seems to be that the film-makers were annoyed with not getting the rights, so that as a means of revenge, they proceeded to paint jimi in the worst possible light. and they don't even do a good job of that.
even if i had no idea who hendrix was, and i watched this movie strictly as a story in it's-self, i would have thought that it was boring, disconnected, confusing, and a waste of time.
but i DO know who hendrix was, and it's a shame that such a great opportunity (especially as andre 3000 really does do a great job of adopting his appearance and mannerisms) was wasted. none of the great moments in his career are depicted. what about his iconic burning of his guitar at montery? what about his creation of and touring for his incredible albums (even if they couldn't play the actual songs, they could have shown his success with them, touring with them, and how he became famous through them). what about his magical rendition of the star spangled banner at woodstock? how about having the guts to tackle the hard topic of his death?
none of this is in the story. instead, they basically took a year or two of his life, the period from when he decided to stop playing for other bands and go solo, up until just before he hit it big, and tried to make a 2 hour movie out of it. the movie turned out to be more about his girlfriends, and him acting like a fool with and around them, then about what a great songwriter and creative genius (as well as a spiritual, humble, and humorous man) he was. instead, they want to exaggerate disputed accounts of events that probably never happened (hello, phone beating scene.) worst of all, they couldn't even find a great guitarist to at least fill the sound track with playing that was at least somewhere NEAR the universe of how incredible his guitar work was. the guitar playing in the movie is mediocre at best... doing absolutely no justice to his stellar abilities. What a shame. What a waste. The people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves.

If you make a movie about one of the most innovative musicians of the modern era, perhaps its a good idea to include more of his music. And although some skeletons about Hendrix were exposed, including his occasional outbursts of temper, I walked away feeling like I learned very little about the man. They introduced conflict with his father via a telephone conversation and then never explored it. Other areas of possible conflict were also left languishing. And its a shame because actor Andr Benjamin did a bang up job capturing Jimis vocal cadence and is no slouch as an actor. However, in the final analysis there was too much about Jimis relationships with Linda Keith and Kathy Etchingham and not enough of the mans music.

6761045,2,B00OU27WIC,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

John Ridley's ""Jimi: All Is by My Side,"" reminds me of the film, ""Backbeat,"" the one about the Beatles' early days in Hamburg, Germany. In both cases, the screenwriters were unable to obtain the rights to the original artists' music. Instead, cover songs that Hendrix and the Beatles played in their early days were used instead. Without the original music, why bother even attempting a biopic, as was done here?

In the case of Hendrix, I would argue that his biography is hardly the kind of story worth telling. It's simply not that very dramatic. His charisma is linked solely to his greatest hits, songs such as ""Purple Haze"" or ""Manic Depression""--cut those out of your soundtrack and ""Jimi"" is reduced to a story about a rather petulant fellow (as Ridley depicts him here), who had a turbulent, and sometimes unpleasant relationship with his girlfriend.

Andr Benjamin sure looks the part and does a decent enough impression of Hendrix, but it still doesn't feel like he's captured the pop artist's essence. Another problem is that he's too old for the part (Hendrix was 27 when he died; Benjamin was 40, when he took on the role).

For those into rock history, ""Jimi"" chronicles the year between May 1966 and 1967, right before Hendrix makes it big. For those unfamiliar with the basics, Hendrix was ""discovered"" by Linda Keith (wife of Rolling Stone Keith Richards) , while he was playing in small clubs in NYC. She brought him to London where ex-Animal Chase Chandler became his manager and hooked him up with his two band mates, bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell. The bulk of Ridley's narrative concerns Hendrix's relationship with Kathy Etchingham, whom in real life denied that he ever got physical with her.

Jesse Hassenger, writing in the ""A.V. Club,"" argues that Hendrix remains an underdeveloped character in Ridley's screenplay: ""As Linda recedes from the movie and Kathy becomes more prominent, the point of view shifts around, but it rarely settles on the movie's purported main character. Benjamin, speaking in an airy hippie tone, does his best to lace laid-back charisma with ambition and flashes of anger. But if he tries to disappear into the role, the role disappears into the movie more easily. While All Is By My Side shows Hendrix indulging a violent streak, for example, it doesn't do or say much else about the issue (beyond the implied hypocrisy of his general hippie philosophy).""

Ty Burr (""Boston Globe"") is troubled by the film's lack of verisimilitude: ""Etchingham has told the British press that Hendrix never once touched her in anger; that the story comes from a 1974 biography by one of Hendrix's old band leaders, Curtis Knight, that was almost immediately discredited in court; that she offered her fact-checking services to the filmmakers and was repeatedly rebuffed."" Burr cogently concludes that, ""All biopics lie, obviously, and the standard defense is that they do so in order to tell more dramatic stories and maybe to access greater truths. ""All Is By My Side"" fashions a bewitching mosaic, but through omissions and inventions, intended and unintended, it crosses the line that separates speculation from untrustworthiness. What it offers in return -- the touchdown of a brilliant naf -- isn't enough.""

Stephanie Zacharek (""Village Voice"") sees the film's power in Hendrix's embrace of the feminine: "" It's there in his joyous, polychrome outfits, in the soft politeness of his speaking voice, in the swirling fluidity of his guitar lines, which could be as graceful as art nouveau nudes. Benjamin captures it here, too: Ridley shows him spinning out fanciful dream speeches about human beings just being, you know, cool together. Benjamin's Hendrix glows like a supernova, but circa 1967 he's just a baby supernova, his explosiveness in its infancy. He's still shy, still nervous about his acne-ridden skin and his singing voice. In so many ways, he's more fragile than the women in his life are.""

Richard Roeper of the ""Chicago Sun-Times"" couldn't have said it better when he wraps up his review with these words: ""But a film about the year before Jimi Hendrix became a star is a little like a movie that ends with Jackie Robinson on the top step of the dugout, or Elvis walking into Sun Records.""

I wanted to like Mr. Ridley's ""Jimi"" a lot more. But it all comes back to Hendrix's music; and unfortunately all those memorable tunes are nowhere to be found!",1425427200,,4469,4.948

My issues are that based on the books, videos and interviews and even the music I've sampled of this great musician what was on display of this semi-documentary movie was almost nonsensical. The movie focused entirely on aspects of his life that could have been glossed over, so that we could dive into much more important matters.

Hell, Woodstock never even happens here and what his music is ""about"" and how it affected millions is confusing at best. Still, the movie has charm and Benjamin carries the movies on his shoulders. It's worth seeing the movie just so you can see him.

6761088,1,B00OU27WIC,"The theatregoer hoping to get some insight into Jimi Hendrix and London in 1966/67 will leave the theatre disappointed or duped by the film makers.
Before seeing the film I was apprehensive, as I had been told that my character was portrayed in a derogatory and potentially defamatory manner. I had been told that Jimi had beaten me with a telephone in the film and after I had protested that this was not true the film makers had replied that it was true because they had thoroughly researched me.
In other words they were saying that they were telling the truth and I was not.
During the opening scenes I found it difficult to comprehend the way the story was unfolding, or what it was depicting. The editing was disjointed and dialogue was layered on top of alternate dialogue, seemingly from a parallel conversation.
The film progressed in a confusing and dull manner but there was one scene that gave me a momentary lift of anticipation. The scene depicts Jimi playing with Cream at the London Polytechnic Students Union and should have set out to depict an absolutely epic event that I had witnessed. (I had been carrying Jimis guitar).
I hoped that they would do Jimi justice in their interpretation of what happened.
Unfortunately, once the music started, my heart sank. What a disappointment. Not only was it insulting to Jimis legacy, but I would say it was fairly insulting to Eric Clapton as well because the real Eric Clapton would never have been in awe of the unremarkable performance presented to viewers in this film.
The storyline progressed in an awkward and illogical way and was hard to comprehend.
The basis seemed to be that the dimwitted Jimi could not make up his mind between the good rock chick (Linda Keith) and the bad rock chick (Kathy Etchingham) who later goes bonkers and takes an overdose. (If I was the actress having to play this lousy part wearing those ugly clothes I may have taken an overdose too.)
The strange fact that jars with this fictional narrative is that the unfortunate Linda Keith ended up in rehab at around this time because Keith Richards, of all people, initiated an intervention that probably saved her life. She was hardly in a position to be advising Jimi on how to play the guitar and do his hair.
Fictional characters were introduced that furthered the deluded political, racial and sexist agenda that John Ridley seemed to be pursuing. In particular Michael X was presented as a saintly black political guru whereas in truth he was a violent criminal con man who was executed for a gruesome murder. An Ida character is introduced who never existed in real life.
The biggest disappointment of this film was that after expecting at least some kind of depiction of Jimis humour and creativity and the amusing and creative times that were happening in London, instead we were shown a gloomy and depressing dark tale that pictured Jimi as some sort of moronic mumbling mystic.
Instead of showing Jimi touring the UK and Europe, writing and performing the most innovative music of the century we are shown scenes of banal meanderings, fictitious gratuitous violence and fictitious mental breakdowns and overdoses.
My initial anxiety turned to scorn for the thoroughly bad screenplay and direction.
I became bored and impatient for the end of the film.
The nature of the film left me feeling that the events I was watching were more akin to a made for DVD fictional movie than a biopic. I felt that I wasn't watching an interpretation of the real events from the time, but rather a stiff and poorly depicted mashup of events described in my book, sprinkled over Ridleys racially driven fictional theme. Even the imaginary and defamatory domestic violence and drug use that my character was involved in did not evoke the emotional response I expected, and I found myself feeling just as I have when watching other bad movies, impatient for it to just finish and spare me the indignity of having to watch another tiresome scene with wooden dialogue and disjointed editing.

 A short-sighted and somewhat offensive portrayal of Jimi and those around him at the time.

 Final verdict:

Fictional Movie  2/10

Biopic purporting to be based in fact  1/10 (for spelling all the names right)

The viewer should note that Ridley never interviewed me or obtained a release. Also none of Jimis London friends have been interviewed by him or any of his staff.",1423267200,127,4401,4.810846560846561

I never thought i would watch a hendrix movie and be so pissed off.  There was not one actual hendrix song in the movie, it had some hendrix style jams here and there that were kinda groovy but not one song he actually wrote.  The only positive thing i can say about this movie was andre 3000 whatever, was a good actor, he looked like jimi, and he had his same mannerisms and vocal annunciations down to  T.  i would probably not recommend this movie to pretty much anyone because of how it portrays jimi so falsely, and the woman beating scene just really ruined it the most of all. they could have at least put in one real song, since this is a movie about the greatest guitar player of all time.",1422748800,2,940,4.293785310734464
6761091,3,B00OU27WIC,"The acting was absolutely fantastic in this movie.  As a life long Jimi fan I thought Andre captured the essence of Jimi spot on.  Also the actor portraying Chas Candler was so close it was almost like they actually had him play himself.  However the movie left me wanting more.  They sort put up a short slice of time when Jimi just went to England to make it big and they left so much out.  They really didn't get into him as a player but focused more on his personality.  In fairness to the film they had met with resistance by the now Infamous Hendrix estate and Janie Hendrix who seems to have sabotaged what could have been a great film by denying them rights to use any of his music.  Still, it was well done and for real Hendrix fans worth a watch.

However, I feel like there has been yet to be a good movie made about Jimi which is really amazing considering what he accomplished.  He was truly an American original.  He came from poverty, rose to fame by becoming one of the most creative and revered guitarists in history only have his life snuffed out short due to reckless abandon and misfortune that sometimes come form the price of fame.  All while simultaneously breaking though race barriers of the 60s.  He was both the great American success story as well as the great American tragedy all in one.  And no one (in my opinion) has really been able to tell his story accurately through film.  However as character study this one comes close in terms of the actor being believable as Jimi Hendrix.",1422662400,4,1514,4.418772563176895
6761092,4,B00OU27WIC,"I bought the Hendrix movie.  It never came out in the theater.  It was absolutely fascinating.  It could have been better, though.

Andre Benjamin absolutely became Jimi.  With your eyes closed, it would be difficult to tell if it's the real deal or an actor (by the voice alone).  I've never seen anyone look that much like Jimi.

The Controversy: There is, however, a scene where Jimi beats his girlfriend so bad that he sends her to the hospital.  I, of course, had to verify to see if that actually happened.  The girlfriend vehemently denies that whole scene happened.  The movie jumped around a lot between periods of time. It got old after a while.

To me there were two major issues:

1. They never used ANY of his trademark songs.  Due to legalities, they had someone ""fill-in"" those parts with Jimi-esque guitar riffs.  HUGE LETDOWN.

2.  As good as Andre Benjamin was at playing the part, they could have done a better job making him at least look like he's really playing the guitar.

3.  The movie did a great job in the area of drama, but a horrible time expressing how powerful Jimi's playing was.  Vibratos were weak,  The tone was weak, and all the music kinda lacked cojones.  During all the music scenes, I couldn't help but think, ""Come on!  I could play better than that! This is a story about Jimi-Doggone-Hendrix!  Play that guitar!""

Overall, it is still worth watching.  There was a lot of new, interesting stuff - even though you need to sort out the BS from reality.  It's far better than the HBO movie that came out about 6 or so years ago.",1422403200,4,1568,4.510714285714286

6761094,2,B00OU27WIC,"Producing a Hendrix biopic is a daunting task. How much of his life will be covered? Who can act the part? How will the guitar-playing scenes be covered credibility? How accurate will the portrayal be?

""All Is by My Side"" fails on all but one of these fronts. Andre captures the dreamy, intelligent, wistful, playful Hendrix aura remarkably well, including this speech patterns and body language. However, it strangely covers only a year or two before Hendrix came back to America at the Monterrey Pop Festival in 1967. None of that apocalypse is on display. Most of what Hendrix is famous for is, thus, missing. Andre plays guitar credibility, but, of course, fails to capture the Hendrix fire. Overdubs might have been a better idea. From my reading of Hendrix life, the film is roughly accurate, but choppy. He did not throw down the old military uniform he bought in London when harassed by police. Yes, he was an angry drunk and hit women, but probably not in the way the film depicts it.

Much of the cinematography is awkward or off-putting. Why do we hear voice-overs when seeing Hendrix and a girlfriend talk in real time? It is odd, and for no reason.

Hendrix was an inventive musician, a mystic, and a totally irresponsible human being. The only thing he could ""keep together"" was his guitar playing. He died of a thoughtless combination of pills and booze. He left no will. He left children around the world--human beings he helped bring into the world as a byproduct of his voracious lusts. We still play his music all these years later. Here is yet another example, large and loud, of a man as a ""deposed king,"" as Blaise Pascal put it.",1422230400,2,1652,4.670103092783505

6761106,2,B00OU27WIC,"Andre Benjamin was amazing. It is a shame it was for this pathetic story of imagination and fantasy. I was bored through most of it, due to a poor script. I was offended with the license taken to portray Jimi Hendrix as a woman beater. I have read too many books on his history, all written by different people and they could not have all missed the woman beating story. Even if that is forgiven though, the story was too slow and not very exciting.",1421193600,6,449,4.294117647058823
6761107,1,B00OU27WIC,"When I first heard this movie was in production I was really psyched.  As I long time fan of Jimi Hendrix fan I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  Tragic waste of time and money, this movie was pathetic.  The music Jimi recorded and played all his short life was not even in the movie, not one note.

There is nothing here to see or hear, no story at all.  Maybe one day us fans will get a real movie about the master who lived such a short fast life.  I still listen to his music today and love it as much as I did when I first hear it as a kid.  Don't waste your money on this dismal movie, it is awful.",1421193600,7,613,3.856
