Great television",1252627200,3,239,4.195652173913044

3790568,4,B001TH8ZH8,"There are much more than 2 good reasons (as referenced by the title) to watch this.  I saw the show in real time while this was Starz Networks entree to a show with a serial format.  I came to this being offered as a DVD when checking Amazon to see if there are other works available by Ms. Atias and was somewhat surprised by the fact that this fine show had only a handful of reviews.

Amazon does an excellent job by way of an overview of the show.  Like the movie of the same name, Crash offers multiple story lines that at some point intersect (the style made popular by Pulp Fiction)

My personal favorite story line, of course, involves Ms. Atias, as the much younger wife of a Gypsy leader (yes there are gypsies in the USA) and the cop played by Ross McCall.  One of my favorite lines was when Ross McCall was asked how he could get involved with a married gypsy woman and he replied ""I thought she was a Latina!""

Kudos to the writers that produced a script that allowed Moran Atias to be both controversial and in a near perpetual state of undress.  If she is not on your ""bucket list"", she should be!",1326240000,7,1112,4.23696682464455
3790569,3,B001TH8ZH8,"This is a difficult series to review. I would say that it is less than the sum of its parts.

There are several storylines that are extremely entertaining:

(1) the has-been rock and roll producer who wants to find one final ""star act"" before his career (and life) goes down in flames;

(2) the woman who suspects that her estranged father was always right about her husband's career prospects;

(3) another woman who suspects that her lover may be a mob enforcer/ contract killer;

(4) an illegal alien who is attempting to make it in America -- crossing the border with only the bloody shirt on his back.

However, I thought that each of these stories would have been better told as four distinctive full length movies than as they are presented here as a (very loosely) interwoven story.

The acting in the series is strong as is the writing in the majority of the episodes. But, in the 2nd Season, I would like a rationale as to why I should view this series as one complete narrative as opposed to a collection of fascinating short stories.",1265068800,6,1045,4.55614973262032
3790570,3,B001TH8ZH8,"I love the concept of this series. Multiple vignettes, each interesting, with one exception. The part with Dennis Hopper is silly, and ridiculous. It highlights his real life I suppose. If it were eliminated this series would shine as a 5 star.",1264982400,,244,4.833333333333333
3790571,5,B001TH8ZH8,"Crash is an outstanding show, the actors are all strong and the stories are very interesting.  While watching you wonder what happend to so and so.  I can't wait for season two, great writing and I compare it to the suspense of ""The Shield""",1259020800,,240,4.431818181818182
3790572,3,B001TH8ZH8,"Too much happening, you get used to one story then it moves on to another story, sometimes the stories are a tad boring and take up the whole 45 mins.
Great acting interesting but a bit slow.

8341403,5,B001TH8ZH8,"First off, I do not own the DVD, I saw the series as it aired on STARZ. The series was based on the eye opening and quite shockingly true film by  Paul Haggis. You need not see the film (though I recommend it!) to enjoy this series! The series shows how lives from all different walks at some ponit join together. It it meticulously written and directed in this sadly over-looked series! This also being the last acting that the great Dennis Hopper did before his death. The series is a set of story-lines that run there course and all are extremely engaging! At a point, 2 lives will intertwine in the most intriguing way! Not only does it start some great actors like Hopper, Peggy Lipton, Eric Roberts, Tom Sizemore, Keith Carradine and so many new faces that make this series so unlike any other!
  Now, the sad part, As you can see, you can purchase the first season  here on Amazon. The series only lasted 3 seasons due to Dennis Hopper's death, but the 2nd season ends with a great finale so you are not left hanging. The problem is owning the 2nd season. It seems Amazon owns the series and you can only buy the 2nd season through Amazon at a very expensive price and they mass record them on DVD-R discs!
I guess that's legal if they own it! DVD-R discs are inferior and do not last like prerecorded DVD's. Especially when they are high speed dubbed. I wish a company would buy this series and release them proper! They deserve a HD presentation on Blu Ray. I noticed that the first season has gotten the BR treatment but only in Australia! This is a shame because this is a big thing for Dennis Hopper fans like myself! I would love both seasons carefully given a HD Upgrade (they are only 7 years old) and both seasons priced reasonably for fans of the show. The only other way you can view these is through Amazon Prime Streaming. Since Amazon owns them, I see little chance in them being on Netflix either.
  Come on Amazon! Do right by this great little series and Dennis Hopper fans worldwide!",1459036800,,2008,4.4135135135135135
8341404,5,B001TH8ZH8,"Dennis Hopper always a surprise, may he rest in peace. Versatile actor with many roles to his credit. As usual he does great job in this movie, there are similarities and shadows of Paris Trout. They need show this mini series on Showtime.",1452384000,,239,4.5813953488372094
