8695725,5,B00RPOMLGU,"This has been very helpful.  It is easy to follow, and well presented.  I would recommend it to anyone new to the camera or wanting a refresher course.",1527033600,,151,4.357142857142857
8695726,5,B00RPOMLGU,Nice course for my introduction to my new camera.,1488412800,,49,4.555555555555555
8695727,5,B00RPOMLGU,"I consider this a very good training video. Some comments in other reviews say it is to basic. I think most people buying a D7 mkII are not seasoned pros but rather advanced hobby users and can benefit from the many good tips here. I also have a D70 and this DVD has helped with learning the
D7 and general tips for both cameras. Much better than trying to learn from the many somewhat scattered UTUBE videos.",1486857600,,409,4.324675324675325
8695728,5,B00RPOMLGU,This is an absolute must for anyone at any learning level who owns the Canon 7D MarkII. Micheal explains the basics of understanding the camera as well as basic knowledge of digital photography. If I could give him TEN stars I would!,1479686400,,233,4.571428571428571
8695729,4,B00RPOMLGU,You can a wealth of info from this course and I have worked in the Photographic field as a pro and semi pro for over 30 years. And that does not count my cub scout merit badges for photography. So I came from film to digital.,1467072000,,225,3.9130434782608696
8695730,4,B00RPOMLGU,This is a fantastic video.. MY ONLY PROBLEM is that it did NOT work on my PC.. Everytime I watched the video it would shut down my computer..  I bought a portable DVD player for $100 (my choice..there are less expensive ones) and now I can view my DVD .. so far.. without problem.. Will get thru the rest of the DVD and hope it keeps working,1460160000,,341,4.08955223880597
8695731,4,B00RPOMLGU,"Michael Andrew does very good DVDs. I would give it a 5, if it weren't for the repetive content (which is great) in the beginning lessons, but should just be it's own DVD. The section on the 7D mark II is good.  I also have his GH4, Lighting and Photo Tips DVD. I wish they were on-line vs. DVD (I rarely use DVDs anymore).

Michael's teaching style is good and he's very clear. I've been a videographer, editor and photographer for over 20 years. I buy them to learn new cameras or to give to junior staff at work.",1447718400,,515,4.191919191919192

8695733,5,B00RPOMLGU,"Super useful and very informative! Watching the video, I was able to understand everything the instructor was saying and learned much from it. The video was very clean and smooth. The audio was very good and clear. I would most definitely recommend this to a friend.",1423699200,4,266,4.804347826086956
