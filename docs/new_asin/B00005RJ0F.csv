8533629,5,B00005RJ0F,"I first saw this movie about 10 years ago, and it has become a family tradition in my home. We watch it every Christmas season. It is the story about a young boy named Angelo who has a great singing voice. His Pastor, Father Walsh (Played by Donald O'Connor) notices this great gift that God has given him and knows that the boy has a great singing future. The boy's father, on the other hand, thinks that his son should work in a factory like he does and is dead set against the boy singing. This creates a family dilema and threatens to crush the childs dreams of being the next Mario Lanza. That is, until a great Christmas miracle. A must see for all.",1005436800,8,655,4.248
