4459868,5,B004R9Q2GG,"I love this show! I used to watch it all the time when I was younger. Sure it's like a teen version of a soap opera, but it hits on major points and I love the stories and how they interwine with Degrassi Jr High and Degrassi High. I would totally let my kids watch this (but of course it won't be ""cool"" by the time they're old enough).  Plus to buy all of these seasons was a steal of a deal at this price. It's much more cost effective than buying them individually. However, I wish it came with the next 2 seasons. But overall, I'm completely satisfied.",1425254400,7,557,4.110091743119266

4459872,5,B004R9Q2GG,"Serious guilty pleasure. From 2004-2006 I'd have people over for Degrassi Fridays - drink, draw, watch Craig go ballistic. I loved the 80's series, too, although I admit I didn't watch it until the early 2000's - and own those too. Can't find a better price than this, either!",1416787200,6,276,4.653061224489796
4459873,5,B004R9Q2GG,I'm Degrassi 's oldest & biggest fan since DJH was on tv. I'm addicted to this sequel series. I'm extremely happy to have found this set so I can watch seasons I missed when I didn't have cable & keep myself entertained while waiting for the next season of new episodes to start in the fall. Packaged well & shipped fast,1407801600,5,320,4.262295081967213
4459874,5,B004R9Q2GG,"I grew up watching this show and have always loved it. Re-watching these episodes so far have been super fun and I've always loved the lessons learned. I'm the sort of dork that loves After School Specials type shows and Degrassi is by far the best one, I've ever come across. It touches on so many issues that kids go through, even in todays day and age. Not to mention how fun it is to watch these kids grow up and some even continue on to further seasons as adults. I highly recommend it for your kids, it teaches some great values and they might just learn from them. I know, I did. It's fun for parents too. It is a show you can definitely watch with your kids.",1404691200,2,666,4.170542635658915

8438785,5,B004R9Q2GG,"This show came on when I was starting high school. Being the same age as the principal cast members really helped this show feel right at home to me since it was directly showing the type of things that I saw/went through back at that age. Can't wait to watch it all over again. (Just burned through Next Class when I saw it available on Netflix and it kicked in the nostalgia bug, especially the episode where the kids from TNG guest starred)",1501372800,,443,4.349397590361446
