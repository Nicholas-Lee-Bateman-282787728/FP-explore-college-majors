191002,5,1573300861,"Great music and an interesting look at this artist.  Liebert fans will appreciate this DVD with its exceptional sound and a visual view of one of his concerts.  I personnally have not had the pleasure to see him perform  live in concert, so I enjoy this DVD as a nice compromise. Anyone who has  not seen or heard his music, I recommend that they take a gamble and get  this DVD to listen to his music and see his style. He's an accomplished  musician, and his music is original and very enjoyable.",944870400,11,498,4.358695652173913
191003,4,1573300861,"For those who like to take a break from the noise once in awhile, this is a pleasant DVD.  Sound and vision are great.  Rather soothing!",944870400,6,136,4.1923076923076925

7797972,5,1573300861,"This video is wonderful.  Ottmar Liebert is one of the most original and creative artists around.  We have enjoyed it so much, that I have purchased two more for my sons.",1227657600,,170,4.451612903225806
7797973,3,1573300861,Ottmar is one of the best guitarrists in the nouveau flamenco. He plays alive with his band acoustic music with percussions. Nothing to say about the quality of compositions but all the tracks are so similar (the style is this...) so all the concert is not boring but it's better if you are a good fan. Among the songs there are some interviews with Ottmar in which he tells something about him and his life. A good dvd for a romantic night and for whom loves this music.,1123632000,5,471,4.363636363636363
7797974,5,1573300861,"As somebody who has a large range of Ottmar Liebert's music and consider his work to be of extremely high quality, and also the fact of living in Australia and not being able to see him personally in concert, I was more than impressed with the casualness of Ottmar and his band and how they combine together. It is of course unusual to see a player with a setting of many candles and barefoot playing on stage like that.

I just love Ottmar Liebert and his band Luna Negra and the way they present their music.  Thank you.",1123459200,4,522,4.316326530612245
7797975,5,1573300861,I have never written a review before but I felt it necessary to add my opinion about this video since the previous ones were so terrible. Ottmar Liebert is an incredible composer and musician and he and his band are unbelievably tight. This video is mesmerizing and deserves an excellent rating. It is professionally done and the music is overwhelming.,1105920000,3,352,4.883333333333334
7797976,3,1573300861,"In the DVD, O.Liebert says: ""that he doesn't say much when he's performing.""  Well, he does not practice what he preaches in this DVD.  He interrupts the Snakecharmer song at the most inopportune time with extraneous chatter.  He then later makes an comparison about Michael Jordan and his group being in the ""ZONE"".  That's a little bit more than what I want to hear.  Other than that... it's o.k. listening.",1072742400,2,409,4.785714285714286
7797977,2,1573300861,"I'm a big fan of Liebert's music, so I bought this dvd expecting to listen to it peacefully at home trying to relax myself, only to be INTERRUPTED by a comentary in the middle of my favorite song ""snake charmer""  what a shame... With this dvd you just have to skip and skip in order to  find the music...Also, I find it just too short, just about six  songs...very dissapointed.",950486400,23,378,4.371428571428571
7797978,3,1573300861,I agree with everyone about the quality of the recording and performance. The problem that is all too common with music on video is the talk that interrupts the flow of the music. Even worse is when a tune is cut short so  we can hear talk. DVD has the capability of alternative tracks so one can  hear the interesting talk when desired. I doubt anyone will desire to hear  this great music interrupted by talk on each playing. This seriously  compromises the enjoyment that would have been so much greater with this  beautiful performance.,947721600,12,540,4.6421052631578945
