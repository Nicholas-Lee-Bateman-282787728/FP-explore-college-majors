7010449,1,B00TIHI45E,"I hate the fact that this final season - Season 7 - is being held hostage for those of us faithful fans who bought into this collection with the preconceived idea that one day we would own the entire Alfred Hitchcock Presents collection.  Who is the culprit behind this evil idea? You have time to redeem yourselves, but for some of us customers, it may be too late. Please act on this - it may be a reason why sales into collections are waning - no one wants to get short-changed.",1465171200,26,481,4.285714285714286

7010451,5,B00TIHI45E,"Universal, I'll buy Alfred Hitchcock Presents season 7 ... PLEASE RELEASE IT!
Nov 2013 was the last release on season 6.
We have waited so long.
I want so much to have the complete series of this great series.",1455062400,23,209,4.384615384615385
7010452,5,B00TIHI45E,"If it comes out, its Alfie and would be 5 stars for content, to Universal, I understand your a business and need to make a profit on what you sell, if AFP season six made a profit, than theirs no reason, not to bring out season 7, even if the sales of season 6 where below expedition, if you still made a profit, than you got money you would not have gotten, and you can give season 7 a shot...",1454284800,19,394,3.9375
7010453,1,B00TIHI45E,Come on and release this!  It's been over a year since the last season was released. This was such a classic series!,1453334400,24,116,4.2727272727272725
7010454,2,B00TIHI45E,"It's been over 3 years since Season 6 and still no Season 7 DVD set released from Universal. Pressed DVDs still offer better longevity, but isn't it time that Amazon step's up and issues Season 7 and the rest of the series on DVD-R? And it's not like there's no demand for it-the numerous customer reviews of DVD sets for Seasons 1 thru 6 prove that.",1497139200,4,350,4.318181818181818

7010456,1,B00TIHI45E,I purchased this film a couple months ago and eventually it does not want play in the U.S.A. So is there any chance I can get a refund back? I will return the disks back. Thank you.,1495065600,,181,3.918918918918919
7010457,5,B00TIHI45E,"Probably the best season of the seven seasons of AHP.  Why the publishers did not release this one season in USA is puzzling.  However, since I possess a zone-free player, no big deal.  The picture and sound quality were masterful.  Delivery time was much shorter than promised by them or expected by me.  In all ways a good purchase.",1494288000,2,334,4.593220338983051

Seasons 1 to 5 had them. Season 6 was without any subtitles. So why ..oh...why...???
Thanks for considering and answering. J.P.",1467072000,,241,5.05
7010460,5,B00TIHI45E,Love these series.  The movie wasn't in my region and had to purchase an all region player. I wasn't about to let my Alfred Hitchcock collection go to waste. This was a great season. Now I have all the seasons 1-7..thank you.,1466553600,9,225,4.357142857142857

7010462,1,B00TIHI45E,Region 4 PAL!! I have everything Hitchcock; even his silent films from his early days in the UK. I haven't missed a single film. I have them all. I have 6 seasons of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.... and now..... REGION 4 PAL!!  Why do the people who release these things insist on disappointing everyone? It never fails.,1465776000,10,317,4.660714285714286

8701893,5,B00TIHI45E,"As a long time fan of Alfred Hitchcock, viewing this collection has certainly been a treat. The stories have all kinds of twists and turns, and there's often a surprise ending. I don't know if I'm going to be shocked or laughing. This is the final season of his half hour format tv show.
  While I am disappointed that this collection was never released in the North American format, I'm getting around that by viewing it on my pc dvd player. Unlike tv dvd or blue ray players, dvd or blue rays on pcs are not region dependent.",1516838400,2,527,4.36734693877551
8701894,5,B00TIHI45E,"You must have an all regions player--this is a UK import and Region 2 PAL system discs.  But since Universal stubbornly refuses to release this as a region 1 set (after releasing the first 6 seasons), this set is the next best thing.  The prints are very sharp and as usual, the stories are with the usual Hitchcock twist. The set even includes episode 39,  ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"".  This episode, because it was considered ""too gruesome"" for NBC network broadcast in 1962, was banned from broadcast.  However, over the years-whether it be in syndication or available on disc---it's one of the most desired episodes.

Really, it terms of today's expectations, the episode is really pretty mild.  But it does feature gorgeous British bombshell Diana Dors--and that's reason enough to watch.",1513209600,3,793,5.053846153846154
8701895,2,B00TIHI45E,"Having just over the past month , having watched the season seven episodes on TV, I must confess that (with the
exception of perhaps 2-3 episodes) this 7th season was the weakest of all 6 seasons which preceded it.
Don't expect too much when you have mediocre actors like Robert Webber staring in an episode, the second
to last no less.
Most of the better episodes relied on a last minute surprise ending.",1511568000,,405,4.561643835616438
