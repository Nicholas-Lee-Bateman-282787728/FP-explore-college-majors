2409287,1,B000B91N3S,"I wonder if when Oprah Winfrey is familiar with the concept of ""clinical narcissism.""  I mean, what is it with this woman?  Wasn't it Galileo who proved that the earth *doesn't* revolve around Oprah Winfrey?  What, she didn't get the word?

Please let me know what this woman's talent is?  Is it that people ""want-to-be"" Oprah Winfrey simply because she has lots of dough?  But that's begging the question, isn't it?  Even when she only had a few million in the bank, hordes of nimcompoops went wild over ""Oprah.""  But why?  Porque, mon ami?

What cord, what nerve, what vein in the American culture has this fat-then-skinny-then-fat-again-then-skinny-again person struck that she should be so popular?

Try getting a dozen to show up for a PTA meeting or a peace rally -- then announce that Oprah Winfrey is around the corner at a diner farting pork 'n beans and, believe me, you'd have a regular stampede on your hands.

Better yet, imagine what would happen if Oprah was taken off the air for a week.  There'd be rioting in the streets!  People would be throwing babies out of windows!  Anarchy, chaos!

Lose your home, lose your job, pay 14 billion dollars a month for three wars in the Middle East -- that you're ok with, America -- but no Oprah?  No Oprah!  Can't be.  How will we as a civilization go on?

2409295,4,B000B91N3S,"Let me make something clear. I think that Oprah is a prime example of the American Dream. She was born a poor black girl in the South and survived the odds including rape/sexual abuse, poverty, and a miscarriage when she was a teen. She is perhaps one of the richest black women in the world. Here's the bad part. I think that her ego has blown out of proportion in the last couple years. She acts like she's an expert on everything and she's not as gracious as she used to be. Luckily, old and new O can be found on this 6 disc, 20 year retrospective dvd set. Yep, it's a mouthful. Present day Oprah guides us through the clips, sharing her thoughts during the interviews and even her regrets. This is a good and not so good thing. I was very interested to hear what she thought about particular shows, but not all of them. Her commentary is sometimes lengthier than the actual set of clips and there's only so much of ""expert"" O I can take.

Her 40th and 50th birthdays are also here and are complete opposites of each other. Oprah seems genuinely surprised when she discovers that Patti Labelle, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight, and the audience are throwing her a party. She's even affectionate with Stedman and is nicer to Gayle. Her 50th is another story. Over the top doesn't even describe it. The most annoying part is when tapes from celebs pals extolling O's greatness are played and Oprah isn't even paying attention. Tina Turner, Stevie Wonder, and Josh Groban stop by to perform, but it all seems so forced. Thanks, but no thanks.

Oprah seemed alot more humble and likeable circa 1986 to the mid 1990s. She seemed genuinely invested in what her guests had to say and she actually let them finish their sentences. She was funny and didn't mind letting herself be silly. Just more real. The most real moment is her 1990 interview with Truddi Chase, a woman who experienced a childhood of horrific physical and sexual abuse and dealt with her pain by splitting into a number of distinct personalities. While reading the teleprompter, Oprah breaks down and faces her own painful childhood. No wonder people really liked her back then. Anyway, all of O's most memorable moments are here, from her 1988 fat in the wagon show to her 2004 ""you get a car!"" surprise. There are no extras here since this entire set is a huge extra in itself. Pick it up.",1228089600,,2356,4.541176470588235

Aside from being one third the price it is here in Perth, it is put together so well, clearly and concisely and a wonderful stroll down memory lane of the best selections of Oprah. We have not had the show in Australia for the whole time, so many of the interviews and early segments I have never seen.

2409302,5,B000B91N3S,"The fascinating story of Oprah's rise to power in the talk show world is brought to life on six DVDs. On the first DVD there are three sections. In the ""Beginning"" segment Oprah reads from her journal, explains footage from her first show and talks about former jobs. The story begins with an interview in her office and then Oprah remembers guests she interviewed that she will never forget. ""Heartprints"" brings a new understanding of the human condition as Oprah brings attention to anorexia, breast cancer and sexual abuse. ""The Stars, Act 1"" follows with interviews with Julia Roberts, Goldie Hawn, Mel Gibson, Nicole Kidman, Tom Hanks and Jerry Sienfeld.

While I was intrigued with the first DVD, the second has an extremely emotional start. Once you start watching be prepared to be swept away into a rollercoaster of emotions. Oprah explains the beginning of reality TV, uncovers shocking and horrifying crimes and unveils so much pain in our society. She faces subjects that are difficult to talk about and Dr. Phil gives relationship advice. The surprise section is especially fun with weddings and proposals. After a private tour of Oprah's home Kirsty Alley's kitchen is completely renovated. Oprah interviews the cast of Friends, gives Madonna time to explain the kiss and flirts with Will Smith as he shares advice about long term relationships.

The third DVD begins with horrifying memories of the holocaust and then delves into Nelson Mandela's battle for dignity. While the start is a revealing look at human suffering, the mood lightens with a captivating interview with Lisa Marie Presley. Oprah then faces a number of challenges. She goes onstage with Tina Turner, runs a marathon and interviews Lance Armstrong while biking. I loved Oprah's music video and the hilarious moments while she is working at McDonalds. Just when you think you've seen it all, Oprah goes back in time while keeping her sense of humor. This DVD has Brad Pitt's first interview and a radiant Gwyneth Paltrow talks about the birth of her daughter.

DVD four is as shocking as it is revealing. Oprah seeks to understand prejudice and brings a new awareness to AIDS and racism. Then she takes on the topic of murder. Quite frankly she shows extreme bravery and tries to maintain her composure. During her stay in Texas she looks rather cute in a cowboy hat as she takes on Free Speech. She then delves into heart-gripping stories of personal pain as 9/11 unfolds and as Nate survives the Tsunami in 2005. The second part is easier to watch as Oprah analyzes her fashion sense and there are some pretty amazing makeovers. The last segment is either frightening or comical and you never know which will come next. Brooke Sheilds talks about Postpartum Depression while Bono talks about America as an idea. Hugh Grant is especially honest and Jim Carrey takes over the stage. Robin Williams has Oprah in hysterics and the audience can hardly contain themselves.

The fifth DVD is much less of a rollercoaster ride and focuses mainly on three areas of interest. In the first segment Oprah talks about her struggle with weight loss. The incredible body makeovers are truly inspiring. Then Oprah talks about her Book Club and why she loves to read and discuss books. If you have ever wondered how the Angel Network was started, this DVD has the answers. As Oprah encourages viewers to make the world a better place, money pours in as people donate their change. In the Stars segment Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere and Paul McCartney make their appearance.

Tragedy and extravagance are themes on the sixth DVD. The first segment is a birthday bash hosted by John Travolta and Gayle King. Friends, relatives and celebrities celebrate Oprah's 50th birthday. The second segment is about Oprah's trip to South Africa where she gives children a Christmas party complete with presents for everyone. You can really see how Oprah uses her power for good in the world. In the third segment a day in the life of Oprah unfolds in all its complexity. With all the responsibilities to keep a show going, Oprah still has time to play practical jokes.

While watching all of the DVDs the thing that stood out the most is Oprah's heart for the world. She is truly a beautiful soul who uses her power for good. While watching the DVDs over a week's time I found myself looking forward to each new experience. To me watching the 20th Anniversary Collection was truly an inspirational journey.

2409305,5,B000B91N3S,"A demotion from the 6:00 news to a talk show, to one of the most successful and well-known women in the world, Oprah is here!

Heartprints
From author Alice Walker, ""when someone makes an impression on your soul, it is a heartprint"".  It is stories of human connection and those who truly inspire.

Inspirational people
Oprah's 4th grade teacher, Mrs. Duncan, created a spark for learning.  Rudine, a human skeleton living on God's will;  At 98, George Dawson learns how to read.

The most emotional story comes from Jacqui, burned alive in a horrific car accident. Oprah said she defines survival and is a living example of inner beauty.  Others include a woman who encountered Oprah as a child and said Oprah was ""pretty as a speckled pup""; and Mattie Staponek, 11, poet and peacemaker.

Aha moments - ""getting it, changing moments"" -
Oprah's desire for the role in The Color Purple; devastating seduction of children; teenage girls in violent relationships;  relationship experts speak, like Gary Zukav; Dr. Robin; and a show inside a prison with women who have killed their children.

Surprises
An invite to her 40th birthday party, generous trips for the audience, surprising other people;  Stevie Wonder surprises a star search contestant; one of Oprah's inspirations, Mary Tyler Moore.

Many of Oprah's surprise stories involve her generosity toward the common people, like the extraordinary Fanny and the show about teachers who become the recipients of Favorite Things. Along with a tour of her beautiful home, designer Nate does his magic in home makeovers;

Honorables and some favorite celebrities
Joining Oprah honorables such as Elie Wiesel, Nelson Mandela, and more memorable people. You will see the clips & interviews with the very popular celebrities.

Headlines
Very interesting is a look back into the headlines of the nation; 911; Tsunami; Simpson Verdict; Betty Broderick, Susan Smith;, etc. etc.  Oprah has certainly been there.

Makeover changes
Specific makeovers were selected because they were huge changes in one's life, and Oprah critiques her style from early days.  I can recall way back in the 90s when that she was dressing bad and it wasn't just the 80s or 90s, it was HER style, It was bad at that, but she admits it!

Also included is the weight issue, the many books reviewed, the Angel Network,  Oprah's 50th Birthday Bash, Fun, Day in the Life, and behind the scenes.

Nate the designer shares his survival story of the Tsunami and the gripping story how he lost his partner in the Tsunami.

2409307,5,B000B91N3S,"First of all, Oprah has been my hero for so long now and I just recently bought this dvd collection. I am working hard right now to build a career for myself as an actress, and I have been working very hard. Never giving up, love it more than anything else in the world... and this woman, with all her power and her grace, and her true heroic qualities represents to me, the AMERICAN DREAM. She really and truly does...

 My dream, my wildest wildest dream is to be able to sit face to face with her one day, on her show, ideally... She is like no other. Oprah, I know you read these because you've mentioned how you read the comments on amazong about other things like books... so my thought would be, how you could you resist not to read the ones about your OWN dvd collection? But I hope that you do...

 I've read about her and followed her life and her amazing journey, and I have the most heartfelt, immense respect for her that it really brings me to tears sometimes just thinking about her and the affect she's had on my life. And what's amazing is she doesn't even know me.

 I just balled sitting there watching her in this dvd collection especially in moments like the surpises and the people who touched her life the most and her BIRTHDAAAAY... that was so touching and what a way to go for John Travolta to put it in the best words possible, she is, without a doubt, an American Hero...

 I just cried and I rewatched parts soon after with my own famiy because it touched me so deeply. I can't express in words even how powerful and how extraordinary she is and how much I truly truly love this woman. I loved the interview with Jim Carey as well because he mentioned how he would visualize himsel getting 10,000,000 dollars and then it happened and I believe in that. I belive in visualizing yourself, but like he said, you can't just si around drinking coffee! I work every day to further myself and believe you must, and I SO believe in the idea that preparation meets opportunity! I've always thought that and the first time I heard Oprah say it, it's like she confirmed it for me.

 I sat and just cried myself out after seeing her talk about the story where she said she sang ""I surrender myself"" to God because she wanted to be in The Color Purple so badly, then Steven Speilberg is on the phone for her THE INSTANT she did that. I'm about to cry right now... really. I could go on ... and on. But Oprah, if you read this, which I feel in my heart, I really feel you will... I feel we will meet one day. I really do.

If you watch the DVDs again 10 years from now, you will probably learn even more good things. Study Oprah's social abilities and patterns. She draws out uncommonly sharp, kind, and transformational forces that exist in people around her. Sometimes the beauty of a person is revealed by how the people around them become more beautiful and become their best selves in that person's company.

Oprah makes people around her better. Her friends. Her guests. Her nation. She is a thoughtful individual who elicits better responses from those interacting with her. I've seen some of Oprah's guests on other shows and read some of their books. Oprah's guests often reveal the better parts of themselves in her presence more than they do away from her and on their own. I have had the good fortune to have been close to several people who have had a similar effect on the people around them. Sometimes we never let go of those people, even after they have passed away, because their company clearly continues to make us better. When faced with a ethical question, I'm interested in the answer to the question of: What would Oprah do? I care about what she has done. She makes us better by her example.

These are slices of real life in the best sense:  Oprah is not afraid to show the audience that she learns from other people's stories along the way.  In doing so, in inviting us on her journey of learning, she teaches us profound lessons in humanity.  Oprah is often fun to watch, but she's not just entertaining.

2409326,5,B000B91N3S,"In an unprecedented DVD release, The Oprah Winfrey Show Collection compiles all the highlights of the show's twenty year run in a 6 disc DVD set. Even though the amount of materials in the collection was vast and considerably comprehensive, personally I still wish they put more stuffs. I can remember a lot of episodes that are ""best of"" material that weren't included in here. But anyway it's still a good collection of funny, amusing, and moving collection of themed clips.

Three of my favorite segments are ""Heartprints"", ""Headlines"", and ""Surpise"". Heartprints are clips interweaved with Oprah's commentary on her guests that left a lasting significance on her. Hence she calls those moments ""heartprints"". These are for the most part very moving especially the woman who bought Oprah's shoes in an auction and every time she feels depressed, she stands on those shoes to make her feel better. Other favorites include Jacqui Saburido, a victim of a drunk driving accident, who embodies the meaning of compassion and forgiveness. The meeting of Jacqui and the mother of the man who caused the accident was so moving in its raw emotion. Rudine, the woman who suffers from anorexia nervosa exemplifies a person who wants to be better but doesn't seem to know HOW. It's heartbreaking with its truthfulness. Erin Kramp is another favorite who after learning that she had a terminal disease, recorded hours and hours of herself talking about lots of things so that her daughter can see them in the future and not totally miss the spirit of her mother.

The ""Headlines"" portion is also one of my favorites as Oprah tackled some of the most notorious and important events in the past two decades. Oprah tackled racism in Forsyth County, and it's very chilling when some of the residents keep on using the ""N"" word referring to African-Americans in Oprah's face. But Oprah explained that it really didn't bother her that much because she knows those statements were rooted on ignorance. She also tackled AIDS during the late 80's when people weren't fully aware of what the disease was. The Texas lawsuit was also included in the collection. When the verdict was revealed you just can't help but celebrate with Oprah's victory. Other headlines include the O.J. Simpson trial, Oklahoma City bombing, Columbine, September 9/11, and most recently the tsunami last year.

My last favorite section is the ""Surprises"". One of the best clips on the DVD collection is Mary Tyler Moore paying a surprise visit on the show. Oprah expressed in her previous shows that she really loved Mary Tyler Moore, she even did a spoof of the opening credits of Mary Tyler Moore Show, which was quite funny. When Mary Tyler more came out of for the surprise, Oprah was visibly shocked and couldn't hold her tears. It was really a sweet moment. Another great surprise is when the winner of the Star Search Jake, expressed how much he loves Stevie Wonder, performed on the show not knowing that midway in the song Stevie Wonder was behind him playing the harmonica. The reaction of Jake when he found out Stevie Wonder was behind him was priceless. Another great one is when Oprah brought all her guests to Philadelphia and basically for the whole trip joyously celebrated the spirit of the city.

I really enjoyed watching the collection and I know this review didn't do much justice. There were other great moments in the show that I didn't mention.

2409328,5,B000B91N3S,"This review is written by someone who has seldom had the time or interest to watch an Oprah Show, but was at least aware that her show had become quite BIG.

The other day I was channel surfing and something about her show caught my attention.  It was not only the subject, but also her ability to capture and hold the person she was interviewing.  She did this with her eyes, her body language, her warmth, and her sincere desire to understand what it was like to be inside that person.

It meant asking hard questions, the answer to which we all wanted to hear--including me.  So I ""gave it up"" for a minute to check it out.  The minute became the show including the promo for her 20th Anniversary Collection.

Her compassion and honesty prompted me to order the DVD's for my daughter-in-law who I thought might enjoy them.  Then, wouldn't you know, I decided I'd order myself a set to see what it was that she was going to see.

Well, hang on to your seat!!!  Bring your box of tissues; be prepared to WANT to watch the whole six DVD's uninterrupted. Not only will you cry, but you will weep and sob.  Not only will you chuckle, but you will laugh out loud and even find yourself belly laughing.  It will pull out of you some of your own deepest memories and feelings.  It will tweak you and prod you and most of all give you hope and make you smile.

This one person who you watch grow from a little nobody with a dream into one of the most interesting and interested persons in this planet today will captivate you with her charm, her ""realness"", and her ability to communicate the ""humaness"" and feelings of real down-to-earth people who live on this planet.

Her belief in her mission from God to make others happy and improve their lives with the fame and wealth with which she has been entrusted is more than noble.  She is an Ambassador with a Mission--move over and let her through!

Am I glad I bought the set?  Yes, I guess that would be an understatement.  Do I think you will benefit from watching this set?  Yes, I guess that would be an understatement too.  Enjoy and be blessed.",1143331200,,2096,4.364341085271318

She is incredibly intelligent and Oprah is truly using the media to the advantage of us all!  She is such a powerful voice and she appreciates that and uses that power for the greater good.  She brings topics to the surface that others try to bury.  She is not obsessed with her fame. She is so balanced, and you can tell this just from listening to her... watching her... what Oprah does comes from her heart.  The moment she was able to do more, she did more!  I'm completely impressed with her and I am so thankful that she has been entrusted, by God, with all that she has... because she is truly putting every blessing to good use.  I'm proud of her as a black woman.  Yes, a black woman, because she rose to the ocassion and continues to rise.  True, she is a Woman, but more than that she is a Black, African-American woman and she and I (and all other black women) know what that means when its tied to this capacity of success.  Oprah has broken thru barriers that we didn't even know existed.  This DVD collection is beyond Awesome.  I admit I was not a routine Oprah watcher, but I try... however, this DVD is just great.  I watch it everyday (which like other users stated, is not difficult with the hours and hours and hours of footage!)  My partner and I started our gratitude journals together recently and we are loving it... I can't wait for more time to pass so that I can enjoy looking deeper for things to be grateful for!  My favorite part of the Discs is the ""AHA!"" section... especially with Dr. Maya Angelou.  I can't wait to get through all of the disks, I am just beginning.  God Bless Miss Winfrey.  And Thank You.

I did miss the ""when I was hungry you gave me an apple"" episode (do you remember the 2 old people who were together in Auschwitz?), but I presume one would need at least 20 discs to gather all the highlights of 20 years of broadcasting.

I just can't get enough of her.  She's been most inpirational to me ... always reminding me to live my best life and offer everything I can.  If Oprah could have given something to her fans (not to mention the benefit to the Angel Network) it would be this ultimate commentary of her thoughts and feelings and hours of footage of her dynamic unprecedented 20-years of life-impacting programming.

I laughed, I cried, I got connected as a human being.

I can honestly say she is a divine role model. So much good in her heart. The shows, the lesson, the compassion....all made me a better person. I thank her for making my life richer and more humbled. I couldn't wait to share the DVD's will all my best friends after finishing it. Harpo really made a fine collection. They captured all the highlights of the past 20 years with full show coverage on momountous events such as her 40 & 50th birthday, car give away, Christmas Kindness, etc. Bring out your tissue box because you will cry cry cry, laugh laugh laugh, smile, smile, smile.

2409361,5,B000B91N3S,"Born on January 29, 1954, Oprah Gail Winfrey faced a mountain of challenges as a newborn baby .. born to teenage parents, she was black, she was female, she was poor.. not just poor...po!

Oprah's mother, Vernita Lee an 18 year old maid. Her father, Vernon Winfrey, a 20 year old serving in the armed forces.  According to Oprah, her conception resulted from a single encounter - one time!

Her first break, being raised on a Mississippi farm by her grandmother. Oprah credits living with her grandmother probably saved her life. She taught her to read,  introducing her to her first public speaking role, reading at the local church at age 3..

At age 6, Vernita, wanted her young daughter, so Oprah got packed off to Milwaukee remaining there till age 13.  She was forced to sleep outside by her mother's employer who disliked her yet favored her young sister.  She was raped by a cousin when she was nine years old and later molested by a male friend of Vernita's, and by an uncle.  Like many people, she repressed her anger and pain, never told anyone, and rebelled, running away repeatedly, and by her own admission was promiscuous.

Her mother, unable to cope, tried to put her to a detention home. Oprah gets a break when the home refuses her admission as there were no openings. She gets her third break going to live with her father Vernon in Nashville. She became pregnant, and gave birth to a stillborn baby boy at 14. The death of her baby devastated her and she vowed to turn her life around.  Vernon's discipline and high standards helped.

Five years later Oprah Winfrey's career starts in Nashville in 1973, as WTVF's youngest and first ever African American news anchor, moving in 1976 to Baltimore. Here, she changes roles taking over People Are Talking in 1978.  In 1983, at 29, Oprah moves to Chicago to host AM Chicago, which would evolve into The Oprah Winfrey Show, top the ratings, and become syndicated, changing the landscape of talk tv forever.

Her abilty to talk up a storm, together with the extraordinary ability to connect with and lead her audience emotionally would create a new breed of talk show host, which would spawn others, such as Dr Phil, and Dr Oz. Her abilty to freely discuss her own issues, would inspire others to open up. She would inspire not only women with a better dream for their lives but also men. The power of the Oprah book club endorsement, would instantly boost many authors book sales by millions.

On learning from life-- ""And what I found is that every time you have to repeat the lesson, it gets worse. I call it God trying to get your attention. The universe trying to get your attention. ""Sooo we didn't get your attention the first time. We are going to have to hit you a little harder this time."" So I'm still doing it. I'm still learning.

And it seems worse because it gets worse. I say, the universe is always trying to get your attention. Sometimes it starts out.. any major problem you encounter.. as a whisper. By the time it gets to be a storm, you've had a pebble knock you upside the head; you've had a brick; you've had a brick wall; you've had a house fall down. And before you know it, you are in the eye of the storm.

But long before you are in the eye of the storm, you've had many warnings, like little clues. So now my goal in life is not to have to hit the eye of the storm, but to catch it in the whisper. To get it the first time. I think the thing, the one thing that has allowed me to certainly achieve both material success and spiritual success, is the ability to listen to my instinct. I call it my inner voice. It doesn't matter what you call it..nature, instinct, higher power. It's the ability to understand the difference between what your heart is saying and what your head is saying. I now always go with the heart. Even when my head is saying, 'Oh, but this is the rational thing; this is really what you should do.' I always go with that little... feeling. The feeling. I am where I am today because I have allowed myself to listen to my feelings.""

The six-disc collection includes ""The Beginning,"" featuring the early days of her show; ""Heartprints,"" offering her most emotionally affecting interviews; ""Aha!,"" focusing on moments that provided lessons; and the ""Stars,"" interviews with celebrities. All of it a highlight.

As you can imagine, with nearly 18 hours of content spanning 20 years, by the time you finish watching you will no doubt reexperience many personal favorite moments, and you will probably be as gripped and moved as you were watching the show originally. If you're like me, you will discover many new moments, and fresh ahas, whether gripping, humorous, intense, or fascinating which you may have missed the first time around.

My personal big moment came after a Dr Phil segment. JoAnn Compton planned to commit suicide after the show because she could not process her daughter's violent death 10 years before. Dr Phil turned it around by changing her focus from the day of her death, to considering her daughters entire life. When Oprah said afterwards: ""I could see that shift in her perceptions"" that gave me a huge aha moment.

Neing stuck, I realised that all I needed to do, at any time, in any situation, is shift my perceptions, and I learned how to ask the right questions.  Observe, question, change.  Learning hypnosis, state changing questions and NLP offered  further insights into Dr Phil's exact strategy in the situation, and how to do it for myself and others.

I loved the interview with Nelson Mandela with his tremendous charisma and presence.
Other highlights for me: her trip to South Africa, and its impressive military like precise organisation, how she got the part in The Color Purple,  insights by Cameron Diaz about money, and Nicole Kidman about giving, and  so much more. Yes, it has Tom Cruise, Travolta, Hanks,  Julia Roberts and many others, not only the famous but also the regular people whose stories moved you the most.

Harpo Productions, donates  its full share of the net profits from this DVD's sales to Oprah's Angel Network.

2011 update: Oprah repeated the whisper in the storm segment quoted here on her final show. I hope she will do a follow up dvd of the last five years, and include bonus segments from the previous 20 such as the full Nelson Mandela interview.

If you have enjoyed Oprah, I think you will enjoy this, and I hope you found this helpful.",1136332800,,6428,4.612280701754386

She's proven she can withstand the test of time, who else in  T.V. history can say the't show has been on for twenty years and counting? Not bad for an African American woman.

Now with this collection I can see all the shows greatest moments and highlights (Check out Oprah recreating the opening scene of the Mary Tyler Moore show and the surprise that follows!)

DVD set shows the incredible evolution Oprah Winfrey has gone through. It's packed with hours of footage, including some that never made it to air, of the past 20-years of Oprah's nationally syndicated show.

Some highlights include: Oprah talking about her role in ""The Color Purple,"" non-celebrity guests who have left a deep impact on her life, her audition reel when she tried out for the Chicago news station, and the original theme song that played at the start of the show (an instrumental song composed of flutes or pipes--somehow I can't seem to get that song out of my head!).

Of course there's so much more on the set including celebrity interviews,  behind the scenes footage, etc.

The one thing that I really liked about the dvds was Oprah setting up many of the clips--that viewers are about to watch-- which she explains what was going on in her mind during that time, how and why she reacted the way she did, how the audience reacted, why she chose to do that partcular story,  and whether she learned anything from that segment.

I wish she did that with all of the segments, like on certain celebrities so we would learn what she thought of each one, but that would probably take way too long. For the most part, she does provide very poignant and honest commmentaries on the stories that seem to have impacted the American people.

I agree with another reviewer who wrote that one should be prepared to cry. Because there are many highlights on this box set that will move you to tears.

More than just a collection of pop culture-voyeuristic shows, ""The Oprah Winfrey Show-20th Anniversary DVD Collection"" is a reflection not just of the hostess herself, but also on  American life. It exemplifies how far we have come from 1986, and in 2005, how much further we must still go.

UPDATE: 09/14/2010
The theme song with the flutes that I was referring to was from the 1989 season, LOL. I guess that's when I started watching so I thought that was the original show opening. Hahaha!",1134950400,,2110,4.663072776280323
2409368,5,B000B91N3S,"At 28 years of age, I like many others have grown up with Oprah having seemingly always been there. All I knew was, she's THE Talk Show Queen. If you asked me why she is the Talk Show Queen, my answer would have been - she has been on TV forever.

But over the last few years, I have become more familiar with the show. And as this DVD demonstrates, Oprah Winfrey is more than just a Talk Show Queen.

It is so touching and FUN to see the stupdenous joy she so easily spreads. It is amazing to watch the out-of-my-skin excitement of the teachers all receiving a car and of the teachers in the audience of one of Oprah's Favourite Things shows. Not only is Oprah generous but she bestows her generosity on everyday heroes: teachers, hardworking mothers and more recently (and not on the DVD) volunteers of the Hurricane Katrina rescue effort.

Of course there is going to be Oprah bashing. You can't make everyone love you, some people are not capable of loving others and giving recognition.

But the truth of the matter is: Oprah is a wonderful, inspiring and truly magnificent human being. There is no one else like her and there never will be.

Oh, and the DVD pack is a great collection of snapshots from the show for those who missed out on the early years. :-)",1134864000,,1266,4.3931623931623935
2409369,5,B000B91N3S,"I have never enjoyed a DVD set as much as ""The Oprah Winfrey Show - 20th Anniversary."" Throughout the six DVD's -I laughed, I cried, I learned, I reflected - and through it all I came away with more respect for Oprah Winfrey than anyone else on this planet. I am inspired to truly want to be the best person that I can be.

In this DVD collection, you will see that Oprah is as real as they come. She doesn't prepare all her interview questions, but rather, she is successful because she allows her viewers to see her, as she is...flaws and all. Tom Cruise sees this firsthand when Oprah talks to a future guest via satellite.... sans make-up with her wet hair and wrapped in her bathrobe after a shower. (As Oprah later confesses, ""Sometimes you can just be TOO natural!"")

We have all made mistakes or social blunders, but Oprah admits them all. (Although, personally I thought her elephant ride entrance was great and looked like so much fun!!) She has the unique ability to laugh at herself; forgive herself; and then pick herself up and become better than she was before. And because she displays this with such transparency, you realize that you too can learn from your mistakes and become a better human being.

You will rarely encounter a woman with such a spirit of generosity, which is so evidently displayed in this collection. She is giddy with anticipation as she prepares various surprise gifts such as the almost 300 cars that she gives an audience who are in need of new transportation. There is also a great clip of Oprah surprising her best friend, Gail, with a performance by Josh Groban. You suddenly realize that there is nothing in this world that this woman enjoys more than the ability to be generous with those around her who are in need.

Oprah has given us 20 years of wisdom, insight, and generosity. She has proven to be such a role model with her book club, with her acts of kindness, with her love for humanity and her desire to give back to the world. Her presence has done more to help close the race gap than almost anything else I can visualize.

I sometimes question whether the next stage of Oprah's life can possibly be more meaningful than what she is achieving through her show. On an almost daily basis, she demonstrates and is the epitome of what true growth in your life is all about. She makes us ALL want to be better human beings...to be kinder to others and to ourselves. She may have an impact in Africa or help in other areas of the world, but I hope that she will seriously reconsider before she ever decides to halt production of her show. I hope that Oprah will continue to pursue these noble projects during the summer hiatus. Because frankly, there are too many people who NEED to hear the message that she is sending: Be kind to others; be kind to yourself; learn from your mistakes and continue daily to educate yourself and grow.... and truly your life will be meaningful and rich.",1134345600,,2938,4.515037593984962

I'm thrilled with my purchase and as far as I'm concerned this is the bargain of the century. The DVD is very very well made, excellent navigation and lots of interesting topics. I only received this a few days ago so I haven't seen all the DVD's in the set but have watched a few and have really enjoyed them - there's some things that have never been on the show and some good information about Oprah herself, things I've definitely never heard before. I would highly recommend this set!",1134086400,,606,4.371681415929204
2409371,5,B000B91N3S,"Oprah's DVD collection is a tribute to human nature, kindness and love. What I really enjoyed about this DVD is Oprah's segue in between stories. She speaks to the viewer and reveals her thoughts and feelings about a particular show and what it taught her.  Normally we are not privy to this ""insider"" information.  For instance, Oprah summed up the experience of what she took from the show that featured John F. Kennedy, Jr.  In two words she said when she thinks of him she thinks of Humility and Grace.

The DVD collection repeatedly drives home the idea that anything is possible and it's never to late to dream.

Oprah's DVD is a wonderful gift to myself.  I can pop in a DVD anytime I feel like my life is insurmountable and find hope in the stories.

Thank you Oprah!",1133740800,,775,4.492857142857143
2409372,5,B000B91N3S,"This is DVD collection is wonderful! It contains the very best of the Oprah Winfey Show.

Oprah, being rich, beautiful, successful and famous fulfilled her every dream and yet she is willing to spend her time, energy and money to help people. And it is not only about giving material things, but showing support and saying things to make people feel good about themselves.

She reminds us how important it is to be grateful for what we have, accepting others without judging them, love and appreciate our family and friends and love ourselves, constantly trying to improve in every way.

In the DVDs Oprah shares words of wisdom and some useful information, such as safety tips and easy way to lose weight and stay in shape.

Some stories will make you cry and ask yourself: ""Why?"" and ""What can I do to help?"", others will encourage you to live and achieve your goals. It is also nice to see some of the celebrities that Oprah met on her show and hear what she thinks about them. Also, there are funny things that occured during the show and behind the scienes that will make you laugh.

Besides, 100% of profits from the sale of The Oprah Winfrey Show - 20th Anniversary Collection goes to charity. What a great and easy way to do something good!",1133308800,,1248,4.553571428571429

I want to thank Oprah for being such a inspiration and a blessing to others.

2409375,5,B000B91N3S,"is one thing: Empathy. She has real heart and it comes out in every single one of her shows; people RELATE to her and she to them and this is why she has achieved such mind boggling success. My personal favorite aspect of this amazing icon is the fact that she had so litle materially and attained a level of success unparalleled all on her own, by virtue of her own immense talent.

Oprah set the bar far higher than any other previous talk show hosts by refusing to give in to the popular trend of denigrating and humiliating guests in order to pull in ratings; people were literally put in a televised freak show because of their pains and were exploited shamelessly.

Oprah never did that; she always treats her guests with respect and deference no matter what their background; she was even civil and cordial to Betty Broderick.

Also her agendas are fascinating; everyday experiences most of us can relate to and are therefore mesmerized by how other people are affected by what deeply affects us.

Oprah retains dignity at all times, even during the Tom Cruise meltdown on her show when, leaping around the stage and furniture in an excessive display of excitement over his newest love acquistion, Katie Holmes, he lost total credibility, IMO. I was embarrassed just watching it, but Oprah never batted an eye.

Oprah is generous to all in need and has given away incredible things to people who come on and sit in her audience; one memorable show had a man who wanted a Porsche all his life, and I forget what he did or his background but Oprah had a new Porsche brought on stage and said he could sit in it and have his photo taken; well, after he did, she said ""It's yours."" I get goosebumps just remembering his face.

Another show took place in South Africa, where Oprah was visting an AIDS ""hospital""; so poor and no adequate medicines...she was talkng to a woman who was dying and Oprah asked her about her medicines and the woman said she couldn't afford any. Oprah sat there and cried and I know she did everything she could to help the poor soul.

So, the bottom line of Oprah is, this is a woman who had an ambition and went for it and set a new template for dignity and class in the talk show format, which had none before she showed up. She is living proof that talk shows can be good, educational and worthwhile. Bravo, Oprah!",1132617600,,2347,4.482435597189696
2409376,3,B000B91N3S,"In June of this year Oprah Winfrey, while vacationing in Paris, decided to do a little early evening shopping and happened upon the ultra-exclusive retailer Hermes. The retailer had closed 15 minutes prior to her arrival and Ms. Winfrey was turned away at the door. Ms. Winfrey, no doubt not used to being rejected, stormed away, came back to America and promptly announced on her widely viewed talk-show that she was unceremoniously kept out of the glitzy clothier ( conveniently using the race card as one of the reasons she was denied access ) and that all Americans everywhere should, from here on out, abandon the designer until they apologized for the temerity of not serving one of Americas best-loved figures. The story also made front-page news in many cities and was widely circulated. Less then one week later Hermes did apologize, blaming the incident on an over-zealous clerk. Oprah, to her favor, accepted the apology and announced to her minions that they were free once again to shop till they drop at Hermes.

No doubt Oprahs legions of fans are well aware of this story but I preface this review with this tale simply because in many ways this is a microcosm of the power of Oprah and the extent to which her popularity travels. Ms. Winfrey is, if nothing else, a master of self-promotion. Its nothing short of remarkable that her audience is so loyal that they actually feel a certain kinship to a woman who throws a temper-tantrum simply due to being denied entry to an exclusive clothier that 90% of her loyal fan-base could never afford to frequent. Yet she manages to use this incident to portray herself as a martyr and victim! Say what you will about Ms. Winfrey she is truly astounding. This woman has the business sense of a Donald Trump and has strangely branded her very own name to dizzying heights of success. I certainly cannot bedrudge her that but there is without question an odor of rampant egotism, montrous vanity and even a sense of under-handedness that clings to this woman. Oprah, under the guise of doing 'good deeds' rarely does anything, or attachs her name to any event, that doesn't in some way benefit Oprah. She has made a lucrative career of selling her very own life as one might sell toothpaste or automobiles and manages to get women ( her core believers ) to not only accept her unique brand of endless self-promotion but ultimately even beg for more! Women are Oprahs main audience and she shamelessly uses every emotional trick in the book to keep them coming back for more. Obviously this dvd set is just the ticket for those out here who simply cannot get enough of Oprahs 'warm and fuzzy' sentiments and overly-indulgent sense of self. Whether interviewing A-List celebrities ( which she generally softballs her way thru. Celebrities are assured that Oprah will always defer their wishes ), talking about her early struggles ( which she does ad neaseum! ) or even during one of her gimmicky self-promotions ( the car give-away! ) Oprah, I deeply suspect, does nothing that won't ultimately benefit our talk-show hostess gone wild. Its all so terribly transparent to be almost laughable the extent that her army of fans will support anything she cares to associate her name to.

Granted most of this is hardly cause for concern and I'm certainly not here to damn Oprah with faint praise. But there is something that I find uncomfortable and it is mentioned earlier in this critique. That being how Ms. Winfrey seems far too eager to portray herself, and most women, as victims/martyrs. While Ms. W. is certainly no dummy her show is generally 'dumbed down' for mass consumption and is usually filled with overly-emotional moments of crying, hugging and an embarrassing amount of 'up close and personal' moments that seem little more then contrived and calculated. Any and all intellectual pursuits are carefully abandoned in favor of each episode turning into an amotional hugfest. Granted having a measure control over your audiences emotions is paramount in talk-shows and its almost Pavlovian in nature the response that this woman is able to pull from her overly-eager audience. With an almost religious zeal they eagerly bow to the alter of Oprah and seem almost besides themselves when she bestows upon them yet another jewel of time-honored cliches and homespun wisdom. Her book-club being a case in point. One mere mention from the lips of Oprah and any work of fiction immediately rises to the top of Amazon.coms best-seller list! Again, say what you will, this woman is focused like a laser beam on how to garner more and attention on her self and how to pull money out of her loyal underlings pockets.

Overall heres my take. Personally while I respect Oprah and her success ( eat your heart out Martha Stewart ) I ultimately find Oprah Winfrey narcissitic, fraudulent and little more then a woman who seems completely out of touch with her core believers. Without question Ms. Winfrey believes her very own hype! Trust me, Oprah makes P.T. Barnum a rank amatuer when it comes to seeling her product! Nevertheless, since there is such a huge audience for this type of plabum I guess we must assume this is what 'some' women truly want. Someone to tell them how special they are and to validate their feelings. Oprah does that in spades and shes to be commended for working that vein for all its worth.",1132617600,,5370,4.8032432432432435
2409377,5,B000B91N3S,"At first it felt like Oprah overload with explanations, then snippets of actual segments. I think I was expecting something more along the line of the Johnny Carson compilations of past shows. But once getting into the groove of this pacing, it became addicting, providing cohesive, compelling, and insightful completeness when viewing the twenty year journey through Ms. Winfrey's eyes. It works! Such things as seeing her reaction to her 4th grade teacher Mrs. Duncan and becoming that 4th grader again is a personal favorite. The Mary Tyler Moore surprise visit was so priceless, I actually found myself replaying it three times! The beauty of the DVD format is you can pick and choose the segment you want to see and go right to it.

This DVD is not just a collection of clips, it is well structured and helps you understand the evolution of the show and what guests impacted Oprah so much that she changed the show because of them.  The story of Rudine is a great example of this.  This woman caused Oprah to realize that she didn't want her show to just report on a woman who was dying (like regular news does)...she wanted her show to help her..and help others.  I just can't get that look on Rudine's face out of my mind when someone is telling her that she has to eat and be happy.  She just can't understand how to do it..it is like her brain and body won't let her...it is just haunting.  Take it from me..whether you love Oprah or not....this is a must have DVD set.

Well, to clear things up, I am still and will always be a fan of Oprah, but the rest is a different story (wink, wink).  I don't mean to be sacrilegious, but I have oft compared Oprah to a modern Christ figure.  Follow my logic if you will: She comes from the long-time downtrodden and politically ostracized population of America, the black community, much like how Jesus was a Jew in Roman-controlled lands.  And like the true historical Jesus, She espouses peace and on Earth and goodwill towards men (and women).  Her pure, sinless flesh was also gruesomely whipped and flayed by the stormtroopers of the regime, in a manner so appallingly sadistic yet profoundly spiritual that Mel Gibson decided to make this DVD set about Her, just like he did Jesus.  I predict that within a few decades Oprahism will be the primary religion of the land.  So as long as you don't mind giving Mel Gibson a few extra gold talents, I suggest you buy the DVD or you could suffer the wrath of Oprah.  May She rest Her soul.",1132012800,,1156,4.524038461538462
