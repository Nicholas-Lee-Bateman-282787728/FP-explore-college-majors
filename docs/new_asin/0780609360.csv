7789611,5,0780609360,"""The March of Time"" series has quite a few sets, and the ones I've watched were from the 1930s, but they are also available for later periods.  Its too bad these  haven't been released on dvd, but if you have a VCR, by all means give them a look.

A really fascinating peak into newsreels from the period before WWII. These were shown in movie theaters, and changed monthly.  Talk about propaganda !  We may have been the good guys, but these newsreels were loaded with highly slanted accounts of events, some of it about as heavy-handed as you can get (which  adds to their value actually)... And with the most stentorian narration I've ever heard - how could this guy not be telling the absolute truth ?.

One piece I found rather interesting (and unsettling) was a health care debate from 70-odd years ago..some things never seem to change, do they ?

I wish they'd show these on PBS sometime...I think they're that valuable.",1250726400,4,928,4.581818181818182
