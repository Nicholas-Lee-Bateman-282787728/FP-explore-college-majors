7905745,5,B00000A490,"My young grandaughter just had to watch it daily. We allowed it because it brought fourth a good message to little ones. She also enjoyed it because she could sing the ""Family song"" with 'Barney' as well as her cousins and me. She learned to memorize words and act out things so well that her heart was just broken when her Video broke! So I am getting her one for this Christmas. I think it was one of the better videos of Barneys. This 'Waiting For Santa' has also been her most favorite.",1005955200,3,490,4.279569892473118

It has the original kid's cast in it and plenty of music and dancing.. The children travel with barney to the North Pole and visit Mrs. Claus and pretend to be elves, They see santa's list on his computer and the map that Mrs. Santa tracks him on.. A must have Barney video for your child's collection..",977875200,,452,4.206896551724138
