3558772,5,B001F0K4EQ,"This film is mindblowing, fantastic! If you want the facts about the origination of this horrible epidemic this film will blow your mind with facts and a journey back in time were this all began.  All of my friends and family have watched this film and they'll love it for it's educational value as well for it's findings and facts.
It's sad that our goverment turns a blind eye to the many Americans and people around the world living with this horrible virus. We must not give up hope and force doctors, scientists and drug company's to do the right thing and find and release a cure, now! Some people's lives depend on it!",1349222400,6,625,4.482456140350878
8300129,5,B001F0K4EQ,See and hear in this documentary what you won't learn in peer-reviewed science journals on the subject of how the AIDS epidemic might well have begun. Your own common sense is confronted with undeniable evidence that up to now you have not been properly informed of the possibilities of how it began if you only get your information from mass media and science journals. How can you say you've been well informed if you've been told half-truths?,1494028800,,445,4.792207792207792
8300130,5,B001F0K4EQ,"A fierce, relentless documentary which refuses to accept science's account of the origins of HIV and digs much deeper than the scientists expect.

The stars of the show are Ed Hooper, a genial overweight man who presents compelling evidence that the use of chimpanzee kidneys to prepare polio vaccine in the Congo in the 50s, led to the initial outbreaks of HIV.

Koprowski stoutly denies this, and the Royal Society's meeting in London has the deck stacked against Hooper, claiming that the AIDS virus goes back to the 1930s.

But the  determined filmmakers journey to Africa to interview the technicians who killed the chimpanzees and gave the doctors the kidneys to make the vaccine with.

The white research technicians  say that Koprowski did not use chimpanzee kidneys to make the polio vaccine. That they never saw a chimpanzee killed or autopsied.

The black technicians, on the other hand, are categorical in saying Koprowski made vaccine from chimpanzee kidneys, and that Paul Osterreith (who denies everything) was in charge of the operation.

A comic note is added by Philippe Elebe, one of the Black technicians, who smiles and says ""On tait coloniss, mon cher. Quand deux blancs parlaient de leurs secrets, ce n'tait pas  nous de les couter.""

A wonderfully controversial presentation of a problem that scientists have been trying to sweep under the rug for decades.",1475539200,,1380,5.066371681415929
8300131,5,B001F0K4EQ,"This theory on the origins of AIDS and the OVERWHELMING amount of evidence, which still stands strong after more recent investigations, can only lead you to one conclusion: this is the most logical theory on the origins of AIDS.",1469577600,,228,4.871794871794871
8300132,5,B001F0K4EQ,"I have seen this documentary before and wanted after my first viewing. I show it to friends and family and urge them to become more aware of the politics around us.

This deadly disease was created out of greed and lack of caring by a doctor and pharmaceutical company that should have been held accountable for the deaths and suffering they caused.",1465776000,,349,4.629032258064516
8300133,5,B001F0K4EQ,"This is a must-see! It's based largely on the information uncovered by Edward Hooper in his wonderful book ""The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS"", with new information about first-hand witnesses who provide damning evidence which can be found at Hooper's website [...]. This documentary is very well done, easy to follow.",1461110400,,335,5.0
8300134,5,B001F0K4EQ,"One of the greatest documentaries ever done. Filled with so much truth. Controversially, but it plays out like something so believable, and it makes you question just what is the real truth.",1438560000,,190,4.96875
8300135,5,B001F0K4EQ,"This is ONE OF THE GREATEST DOCUMENTARIES OF ALL TIME.
It caused me to do a great deal of research into the work behind it, and it's all solid: THE MOST PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR AIDS I'VE EVER SEEN OR HEARD, SO NATURALLY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY IS TRYING TO GET IT BANNED! I saw it ONCE on American TV, and then never again: the work of heavy pressure, no doubt.
It's too complicated to explain here, but if you want what the Canadian producers and this buyer believe to be the real story behind AIDS, BUY THIS MOVIE -- AND AMAZON, GET MORE COPIES, ORDERING IT FOR FORTY OR FIFTY BUCKS FROM CANADA WON'T WORK!!!",1427587200,5,610,4.359649122807017

8300137,1,B001F0K4EQ,"Dangerous pseudo-science bulls*** that has been thoroughly debunked for over twenty years.  HIV-1 was present in human populations 50 years before Polio OPV work.  And the genetics don't match up.  But facts have never really been a hindrance to the anti-vaxxer community.

8300138,5,B001F0K4EQ,"An almost 10 years old documentary which presents a hypothesis that is said to have been disproved, may seem outdated - but the recordings of the interviews have a permanent, historical value. The film presents declarations of some of the people involved that it invalidates immediately afterwards. Surprisingly, even some recent counter arguments are debunked in the film (such as that the polio vaccination hypothesis can't be correct because the earliest known infected person was an adult). I'm aware of some new information that requires modification on some points, but these are minor. As a result, the film remains a convincing document about how AIDS may have started.",1416960000,4,677,5.277777777777778
