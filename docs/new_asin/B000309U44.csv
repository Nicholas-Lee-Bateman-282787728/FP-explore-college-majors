8035567,1,B000309U44,"This would-be epic series is a big flop. In the tape version  I watched- fast forwarding  to avoid all the long  boring bits of action less dialogue- the only  enjoyable bit was towards the end (after nearly three hours)  with the action involved in the siege of Jerusalem. The only recognizable  actor was Germany's Armin Mueller-Stahl (the star of Lola) who plays the part of Alessio  a metalworker  in the early part of the movie. The rest of the cast is dismal, made more so by the poorly executed dubbing by English and American actors who sound like unsuccessful candidates for  drama school. The great mistake of the  movie is to modernize the thoughts  and actions of the principal characters. They are far too humane by the standards of the early middle ages during which the first crusade took place. The only role that captures the true marauding spirit of the crusader is the Viking  who trains the young warriors. It is hardly likely -contrary  to what the film suggests- that the crusaders would have had any more concern for massacring Jews as opposed to Moslems. In the actual  taking of Jerusalem the  crusaders reportedly slaughtered all they encountered regardless of age, religion, or sex. The movie has the crusaders apologizing to the  Jews after  wrecking a temple and  killing  off the  priests with the excuse that they didn't realize they were Jews but thought they were Moslems. The main character is flawed as the unbelievable son of a slain Moslem warrior and  a Christian mother brought up by Alessio who  chooses to  join the crusade. The  whole thing was a complete waste of time and the  vast sums of money obviously spent on the production.",1108339200,2,1674,4.769230769230769
