8483255,4,B005QDJ8VS,"Well done documentary highlighting the urge to claim ""15 minutes of fame"" just for the sake of the notoriety as a result of owning an ugly dog against the more noble desire to at least accomplish something positive in an otherwise dreary down-trodden existence because you happen to own an ugly dog that you love regardless of how it looks. This makes an excellent juxtaposition to a viewing of ""Best In Show"".",1386633600,,410,4.708333333333333
