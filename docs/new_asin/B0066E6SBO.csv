4962505,5,B0066E6SBO,"Ive been waitng for many years for someone to release some of Elizabeth Montgomerys made for TV films. She made so many great movies this one is a great film Ive enjoyed seeing it again and highly recommend it. Lets hope the release some more like Lizzie Borden,The Victum and Case Of Rape.",1355356800,,290,4.490566037735849
4962506,5,B0066E6SBO,This is yet another fine movie supremely executed by Elizabeth Montgomery.  This movie is a must-see for all Montgomery fans,1353974400,,124,5.2
4962507,4,B0066E6SBO,"After her eight year run on the classic TV Sitcom, ""Bewitched"", Elizabeth Montgomery appeared in several compelling TV Movies that showcased her amazing dramatic range and versatility. The subject matter was often grim (""A Case Of Rape"", ""The Legend Of Lizzie Borden"", ""With Murder In Mind""), but Elizabeth also played strong women who survived terrible situations with a great deal of courage and determination. ""Between The Darkness And The Dawn""  (1985)  falls into this category.
  17 year old Abby suddenly falls into a coma. She remains in a zombie-like state, similar to the patients in the movie ""Awakenings"", for 20 years. Her devoted mother Beryl (Dorothy McQuire) believes that Abby is still alive and vital, somewhere deep down inside, and trying to wake up and return to the world. She decides to try a new experimental drug called ""El Dopa."" Then, one evening, Abby wakes up again; just as suddenly as she fell into her coma. Everyone is in for major shocks and adjustments. Abby must come to terms with the heartbreaking realization that she is not 17; that she has, in fact, lost 20 years of her life. ""Where was I, Mama, -- when I grew old?"", she cries. On top of this, her resentful, jealous sister Ellen (Karen Grassle) married her high school sweetheart David. But Abby, with a sense of child-like wonder, does discover the world again. Elizabeth Montgomery is delightful in these scenes; especially when she bursts into uncontrollable laughter upon learning that Ronald Regan is President of The United States!
  James Naughton is nicely paired with Montgomery as Jack, a teacher (and love interest) who helps Abby reach for new goals and make the most of her life.  While on a date with Jack, Abby gets a ""beauty make-over"" at the Mall. Elizabeth Montgomery, of course, is breathtakingly beautiful in these scenes. But her outstanding performance is the reason to watch. Elizabeth Montgomery's fans will definitely want to add ""Between The Darkness And The Dawn"" to their DVD Collection.",1328227200,31,2009,4.997005988023952
4962508,4,B0066E6SBO,"While nowhere near as good as her early output such as ""A Case of Rape"" and ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"", ""Between the Darkness and the Dawn"" is perhaps Elizabeth Montgomery's best TV-Movie of the 1980s.

Here she plays a teenager named Abigal who slips into a coma and remains there for 20 years, cared for by her mother (Dorothy Mcguire). When some risky but miraculous new drugs snap her out of it, she needs to pick up her life as a woman in her late thirties who never graduated high school, held a job, or married and started a family.

Complicating things is that her sister (Karen Grassle) has married Abby's high school sweetheart David and they now have a teenaged son Matthew, who's a dead ringer for his father at that age. Old teenage rivalries and resentments resurface between the sisters. It's fun to see ""Ma Ingalls"" all decked out in '80s pastels and shoulder pads, though Grassle seems a little stiff in her early scenes.

The best parts of the movie occur in the first two-thirds as we witness Liz's character slowly comprehend what's happened to her and demands McGuire tell her ""how long have I been asleep?""; her walk through town discovering how much things have changed as she watches an aerobics class in progress and walks into a video arcade. There are some humorous moments like the dinner table scene when an incredulous Liz says ""Ronald Reagan is PRESIDENT??"". In the last third, the script becomes very predictable and the movie loses steam.

James Naughton plays the high-school coach who helps Liz earn her diploma and the two fall in love. Marcia Rodd appears as an old school chum who's own life gives Abby/Liz some new perspective.

Warner Archive has done it again and the film looks terrific: bright, crisp and clear. **NOTE** See the Images section of this product for the screen captures I posted. Also, check their site for a better price because I got mine for much less than Amazon is charging.

Four stars.",1326067200,14,1952,4.692982456140351
4962519,3,B0066E6SBO,This was not one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best movies.  It was kinda predicable.,1406332800,,81,5.230769230769231

4962522,4,B0066E6SBO,"I always liked this success story with Elizabeth Montgomery. Granted, it is a soaper, but all the actors do their best to make it work. It is pricey though for a TV movie.",1394409600,,171,4.212121212121212
4962523,3,B0066E6SBO,Pretty sad intrigue. Did not like the conclusion not very credible but very good actors in it especially Elizabeth montgomery,1392681600,,125,5.3
4962524,5,B0066E6SBO,one of Elizabeth's more disoriented characters. coming out of an lengthy coma she is desperate to come to her own realization of how to fit in with a world she's unfamiliar with. she deals with lots of inner conflict and determinedly and admirably emerges from the trauma with an almost contented resilience as she proves her fortitude and self reliance.,1386288000,,354,4.916666666666667
4962525,5,B0066E6SBO,Excellent Elizabeth Montgomery film if you're a fan of hers.  It also features the actress who played Caroline Ingalls on Little House.  Elizabeth does a great job portraying someone who overcomes her struggles after her health condition causes her to lose about twenty years of her life and then having to start over.  You just want to cheer for her character at the end.,1385078400,,372,4.78125
4962526,5,B0066E6SBO,"It is much more. I remember that I saw this when it was first aired. After all this time, it has held up well. The cast is really wonderful....Montgomery gives excellent work here that could have easily become trite melodrama but never does. Her preformance is nuanced, and touching, without self pity. Even though she is past 50 (the character is 38), there is no problem believing that she is the age portrayed. I recommend without reservation.",1381536000,5,446,4.805194805194805
4962527,2,B0066E6SBO,"This seems to be a made for t.v. movie and seems to lack credablility in its theme. I could not identify with any of the actors, as they seemed to all be unlikable characters. I was thoroughly bored by the theme and pace of this movie.",1379462400,,235,4.130434782608695
4962528,5,B0066E6SBO,I enjoyed watching this movie.  A funny part that I enjoyed was when she watched a woman withdraw money at the ATM and asked her how she did that.,1367193600,,146,4.0344827586206895
8494064,4,B0066E6SBO,"Another made for tv movie, I believe. I think Liz did a lot of these after a certain sitcom got cancelled trying to break away from whatever mold Samantha Stephens might have left her in. At any rate, a very good movie. First the young actress playing Liz's character as a teen before she lapsed into a coma, then Elizabeth appears, in a vegetative state, but still beautiful.

Apparently, Ms. Montgomery was in her 50s, but still playing a woman in her 30s--not much of stretch. Anyway, it's an adjustment to her new surroundings, waking up all those years later. Touching movie at times, with a bit of humor and maybe some nice visuals. I might be thinking about some of the young college students in the film, but nevermind.

If you like Elizabeth Montgomery, then this is good stuff (obviously)....",1525737600,,802,4.680851063829787
8494065,5,B0066E6SBO,"Movie from the 80s. I loved it! It's about a teenager who goes into a 20-year coma. She missed all her youth, but finds love in the end. Touching story. Highly recommend.",1487980800,,170,4.34375

Her acting in this movie is quite good and the storyline holds your attention. Elizabeth played very strong women in her movies, and her role in this movie is no different.
