5495335,4,B00ARZY8D8,"Your main character is Jennifer. The story starts with a peaceful setting that quickly alters itself as Jennifer pushes herself from a van, escaping an unknown man by stabbing him. Jennifer quickly melds into the forest. Soon she arrives in Chestnut Hill. A quiet, peaceful place. Soon Jennifer is smack dab in a lovers triangle. Lies and a dark past play out in full force. Jennifer has many secrets and her past is filled with a violent reality. The point is can Jennifer stop being a Stray and face the reality of who she is, or is everyone around her ready to face the truth of who she is.

Directed by new comer to directing feature films, Nena Eskridge. She captures her characters in a tight, structured clarity that the viewer cant help become a part of the setting of the film. Written, directed and produced by Nena. I personally think, that for it being a first feature film, the conclusion worked. The characters where fleshed out. The story that unfolded on screen becomes in away a natural setting of real reality. You the viewer end up becoming a part of the story.

Starring the very beautiful and talented Gabrielle Stone as your main character Jennifer. Stone becomes the part and is able to express a believability. I have to mention Stone is the daughter of one of my favorite actresses, Dee Wallace. Stone has been acting since 2006 and I feel she has a bright future. Her character of Jennifer expresses that flawless potential to be remembered. The character Jennifer is written and executed in a way that you know the character. You can relate to the character no matter how dark or hidden the character is.

This is a film with a micro-budget. For that reality yes there are moments that could have been better, but the story, acting and ultimate direction over shadows those few flaws. I feel for a micro-budget film it created a memorable reality. The ultimate character study of Jennifer and this small town, plus the darkness hidden in her past all come full force into a setting that makes one believe, understand, and appreciate just how this micro-budget film came together.

Also starring a new comer to the acting world Dan McGlaughlin. Dan captures a wonderful character also. He brings to life the character of Greg Wells. He captures also that believable reality to the character. I think he also executed a great character on screen. I think all the characters work because of the acting. Andrew Sensenig who plays the character of Marvin Brightman also works through a great performance. Sensenig is almost like a veteran, already in close to a 100 Films and TV projects. I most recently saw him in the horror film Sorrow (2015) and We Are Still Here (2015). Also Samantha Fairfield Walsh captures the character of Sarah Bosworth excellent also. The whole cast works, each one has their character spot on.

The movie was an Official Selection of the LA Femme International Film Festival of 2015. Also an Official Selection of TBUFF Tampa Bay Underground Film Festival 2015.

Overall:

I was thoroughly entertained. I enjoyed this movie for it's complex interesting characters. I thought it was directed good, the acting was good, the rich, deep story-line displayed itself in a believable reality. I felt the movie was a solid film to recommend.",1473897600,4,3284,4.801769911504425

5495339,5,B00ARZY8D8,"It is difficult to tell the nuances of this kind of story, but the director handled it expertly. The flashbacks are shown exactly as an incest victim's post-traumatic stress disorder is in reality. Very sensitive and insightful.",1489968000,,228,5.1891891891891895
5495340,3,B00ARZY8D8,"Direction for this film is strong. It was shot well, too. What made me give it three stars is the acting and story. This film would have been better with a stronger cast and a more flushed out story. With that being said, I'm looking forward to Nena's next film!",1489363200,,262,4.26
5495341,5,B00ARZY8D8,"An interesting tale about being a woman alone and searching for safety, comfort, friendship and love. The vulnerability of a wondering woman is like no other. The strength that you see in this film from the main character who hurdles herself into difficult situations just to survive, really speaks to the realities faced by independent women of low income. This is for those cast aside by society. Excellent acting, intriguing story and important consequences.",1488758400,,461,5.243243243243243
5495342,4,B00ARZY8D8,Darker than I expected but very good.  Can't believe that this was the first movie for this director - it is so well done.  The visuals make me want to find this little town and explore.  The acting is great all around.,1485388800,,219,4.166666666666667

5495346,4,B00ARZY8D8,"Having lived where the movie was filmed, I was looking forward to seeing all the familiar places, but in the end, it was the characters that really held my interest.  Believable, odd and more than a little creepy at times, you will want to see how their story ends. Beautifully filmed and skillfully handled throughout, you will not want to miss this small budget film.  Very well done!!",1481414400,,387,4.676470588235294
5495347,1,B00ARZY8D8,"Men me thinks not. Totally unrealistic. Much conversation is quiet and you have to strain to listen, and it mass no sense . many unrealistic scenes and scenarios.

I never got to be a parent. For reasons too long to write here, but it hurts every day. When I see miserable parents it hurts 10x as much.  When I see abused kids, 20x.

Some people get the Privilege of being a parent, and they treat their kid like a doormat.  It sickens me.

To all you good parents, God Blessed you and God BLESS you!!

This movie will stay with me for a long time.",1480636800,,542,3.9357798165137616

5495352,5,B00ARZY8D8,"Stray is a well crafted, suspenseful contemporary drama with compelling performances.  The main character, Jennifer, is a survivor making her way through the world with the tools and immature sensibilities of broken child.  The film touches on contemporary themes and mores. You won't be disappointed.",1477958400,2,301,5.666666666666667
5495353,3,B00ARZY8D8,"It's a bit melodramatic at times. There's potential here with the main character and the circumstances built in the narrative, but some of the story points seem too convenient.

5495355,3,B00ARZY8D8,"Really solid effort with a production that far exceeds its budget. Good performances on both sides of the camera provide us with a dark, taut, thriller. Why only 3 stars?

It's a nice reminder that we can run from our pasts all we want, but they'll always be right behind us. Might as well deal with them.",1476576000,,332,4.045454545454546
5495358,4,B00ARZY8D8,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had character and depth. i enjoy indie film I am tired of the same old tired cookie cutter films.

5495361,4,B00ARZY8D8,This film is why we love leaving the Hollywood strip. A beautifully shot and tightly written portrait of a deadly young woman. Jennifer has a knife and she's quick to use it.

The ramifications are poetic, and sad.  The story line is aptly supplemented by the wonderful location shots, a enviable and inviting community that masks the desolation within, and serves as a contrast between what we seem and what we are.  This insightful story leaves one with a sad melancholy, that ""there for the grace of God"" many of us would be relegated to.",1475798400,4,529,4.78021978021978

I was amazed when I read online about the incredibly low budget allocated for this production. The writing was spot on, depicting a woman struggling to come to terms with her abusive childhood. How difficult it is to break patterns, yet easy to fall back to the familiar.
Dont let the fact that the movie is a micro budget film keep you from giving it a chance. There truly is not much you can fault this movie for. Of course you can not and should not compare this film to the exorbitant movie budgets we have become accustomed to as the norm. This IS a micro budget filmdone very well.
All the actors did a great job, however, the older mother was refreshing from the moment she walked on screen. Very very sad to hear this was her last film. She did a beautiful job and every minute she was on screen, I was captivated. I really enjoyed this movie and I hope others will as well.",1474502400,4,898,4.319526627218935

5495386,5,B00ARZY8D8,"Stray""

Nena Eskridge's riveting story of an abused woman's desperate odyssey to find normality in a chaotic world is yet another echo of the dark side of past film noir classics. It is through Nena Eskridge's bold direction that this film defines itself as a ""dark film"" a.k.a. ""film noir"" through the films use of light and shadow and it's criminally inclined malevolent characters. While the film was obviously produced on a small budget, it reminds one of past classics like ""Psycho"" and ""Identity"". Nena Eskridge artistic rendering is painted with a broad brush filled with a Hitchcock cinematic type of magic that causes the viewer to wonder ""What is going to happen next?"" Actresses Gabrielle Stone provides a stellar performance as a confused and tormented young woman who is running from a dark past and is willing to do anything and everything to find a new life. This film is a timely reminder that ""what we want, is not always what we want"" and ""what we get, is not always what we get"". Arita Trahan turns in an amazing performance as an older woman that provides a much needed comparison as well as contrast to Gabrielle Stone's character. The cinematography provided by David Landau was excellent, and while the film was shot in color it still fulfills the necessary ingredients to be ""film noir"". Kudos to Nena Eskridge for the creation of her wonderful story of a woman with a mirror cracked personality who struggles to find a new life while trying to run away from a dark and disturbing past. This time around with Nena Eskridge's capable direction, the old adage ""You Can't Go Home Again"" takes on a whole new meaning.",1473984000,2,1637,4.764084507042254

8557296,5,B00ARZY8D8,"With ""Stray"" Nena Eskridge has created a powerful portrait of a woman struggling against the relentless demons of her past in the only way she knows.  In uniquely understated and haunting fashion, Eskridge, from whose original script the film was drawn, slowly pulls the viewer into the dark recesses of Jennifer's troubled psyche and Gabrielle Stone is the perfect vehicle for that.  She's terrific.  I like to imagine what this small gem of a film could have been had it not been produced on such a very short shoestring.  As it is, it's a fine tribute to Eskridge's talents as a writer and director and an exceptional first film.  Hence the five stars.

Gabrielle Stone plays Jennifer perfectly - her mom, Dee Wallace, should be proud (you know Dee from 80's films like ""The Howling,"" ""E.T."" and ""Cujo"").  ""Stray"" is not a conventional thriller (although it is suspenseful) and resists easy categorization - I think it's best appreciated by patient viewers who prefer story over action.
