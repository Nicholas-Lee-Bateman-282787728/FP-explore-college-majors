8646620,5,B00IYXNOOE,"Excellent followup to the extremely entertaining Justin Powers film, Pot Zombies. Yes, the plot is very similar to PZ but this movie is so skillfully put together that I guarantee you won't mind a bit. The special effects are intentionally cheesy, yes, but that adds to the uniqueness of PZ2. Hard to explain but the low budget enhanced the film in the same manner of Night of the Living Dead. The music is pretty darn good, too. I found myself tapping my feet during many of the songs---they are that good, my friends. The characters in Pot Zombies were interesting and intriguing, as you know. But in Pot Zombies 2 they are even richer and more developed. You will feel nothing but compassion for them as they meet their untimely fate. I don't want to spoil the experience for you, but I wouldn't wish what happens to some of them on my worst enemy. Now, we all know how rarely a sequel equals an original (Scorsese's Goodfellas/Casino comes to mind). But I believe Justin Powers has pulled a miracle off and surpassed his original masterpiece with this gem of a film. If you liked Pot Zombies, buy this. Trust me, you won't regret.",1486166400,,1134,4.5911330049261085
8646621,1,B00IYXNOOE,"The sequel opens without any flashbacks. Unless you have seen the first feature, you have no idea that radiation caused the zombie outbreak. The DVD cover claims ""less plot"" which means you have a ""Groove Tube"" type of arrangement with every episode being basically the same...smoke pot, get green eyes, eat someone.

The special effects were low budget and campy by design. Some of the dialogue would have been funny if I was still a teen; there is a certain immaturity in it.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, male/female nudity (Brittany Leonard, Alexis Pryor) Good film for BBW lovers.",1418860800,,576,4.927835051546392
