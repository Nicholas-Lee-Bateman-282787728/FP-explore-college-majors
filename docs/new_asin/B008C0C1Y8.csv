5147273,3,B008C0C1Y8,"I remember going to see JUDGE DREDD at the midnight show opening night (yes, this film had a midnight opening for some strange reason). It wasn't so much that I was desperate to see this film, but more that I was really in the mood to go see something at the theaters, and this happened to be the most appealing thing at the time. Being a comic fan, I was peripherally aware of the Judge Dredd comic, but had never read it, and had no real idea what it was about other than the powers that the Judges had, since this comic had received much more attention in the UK than in The States. Later in life, I realized what all the fans were crying foul about with this film, and I understand it.

But for some reason, I just can't find it in me to dislike this film as much as I should.

It's a terrible, awful film. Stallone is, well, Stallone. From a physical standpoint, he's a good choice for Dredd; muscular, imposing, square-jawed. But this entire film is either a grievous misjudgment of talent, or a waste of it. Director Danny Cannon, who has been working on TV shows like NIKITA and 24, is a competent director, but this film is far too out of his league. Essentially, this film uses a similar visual style (or lack thereof) that Joel Schumacher employed in his BATMAN films: dark mile-high spires of faux-majestic cityscapes filled with fire and violence blended with some very clumsy visual effects sequences. Then there are the actors like Max Von Sydow, Diane Lane, Jurgen Prochnow, Scott Wilson and Joan Chen, all of whom should really have fired their agents after getting involved in this film. From Von Sydow as the Chief Justice to whom Dredd owes his allegiance to Prochnow as the morally corrupt pragmatist who looks to start a massive crime wave in order to mass-produce genetic clones of Judges to Lane as the lone sexy and sassy female Judge who is there merely as a horrifically inorganic love interest to Wilson as the mad redneck evangelical father to a family of redneck mutant cannibals to Chen as the sassy and sexy female baddie that exists so that Lane will have someone to beat up. Then there's the eternally-annoying Rob Schnieder, just starting to ride the high of his SNL work of the 90's as the comic relief/deus ex machina who basically, like Stallone, is playing himself.

But when you get right down to the meat of the film, the best moments of the film belong to Armand Assante as Rico. He plays his villainy with such relish and such force and such a lack of shame that it's really hard to not respect this performance. He got the role, got some really terrible dialogue (""Who says politics is boring?""), got the basic motivation of his character and just RAN with it. His wild-eyed anarchic performance is sadly underlooked in the pantheon of Comic Book Film Villains, mostly because of the quality of the film. I also love the fact that the film tries to sell us on the idea that somehow Armand Assante, while certainly a masculine man, is somehow a physical threat to Stallone.

To me, JUDGE DREDD is one of those examples of how NOT to make a film, but it's an example that everything bad about it somehow becomes fun. Believe me, there are some severly skippable moments in the film (particularly when it tries to get heavy, which is only more painful), but when you're at the good stuff, you know it.",1345593600,4,3342,4.5281456953642385
5147274,1,B008C0C1Y8,"The other reviews would lead you to believe that this film should not be mistaken for poop. The other reviews are wrong. This movie should not only be mistaken for, but is in fact poop.",1344556800,7,185,4.314285714285714
5147275,5,B008C0C1Y8,"I love this film, i understand most didn't like it but for what it was it was really well made. my only gripe with the blu-ray is it's still the theatrical cut! being a cinephile i do lots of research on movies i love and have read in several magazines, the fangoria that features the film mentions a harder director's cut and even has great pictures from the film that are not in the final print. with the new film Dredd coming soon it looks like this would have been a great time to to the director's cut and add back all the extra violence to the film and give us some extras. i've seen pictures where dredd's brother rico is in the lab and those cool skinless clones bust free from the chambers and attack dredd, i really would love to see those scenes, the clones were very cool and creepy looking and bet it makes a great fight/ attack scene. maybe one day fingers crossed the studios will listen to the fans and give us what we want and not just upgrade the picture and sound and give us the deleted footage, documentaries and even commentary. the film is not as bad as everyone say, at least in my opinon, you may disagree and if you do god bless you, it's your given right to disagree and everyone likes what they like.",1342828800,23,1228,4.252136752136752

5147282,3,B008C0C1Y8,"The 2012 Dredd film is better in every way possible. However, this film is very watchable

The acting is pretty good for the main cast. Stallone was a pretty good choice for Judge Dredd, besides the infamous ""EH EHM DEH LUH""

I found the costume and set design to be pretty incredible. The Judge uniforms look great and are adapted to our dimension very well. Judge Hershey is one fine fox in a uniform. The environment also looms really good. Its exactly whaf Mega City One should look like from a direct comic inspiration.

The story is pretty weak. It has the foundation right, but Rico and the Dark Judges were poorly executed from their comic counterparts. It also fails to follow the typical Judge Dredd tropes that the comics started, most notably Dredd having his helmet off for a good 90% of the film.

All in all, this is a very watchable movie. Its nowhere near as good as Dredd 3D but its a fun watch for Dredd fans on bad movie nights. You can even see Rob Schnieder before Adam Sandler ruined his career!",1457913600,,1018,4.456989247311828

Cheesy, corny and fun entertaining is sometimes the best thing going we film buffs don't always want super heavy and serious stuff.  That takes from the enjoyment of going to the show because we want surreal and make-believe scenarios that take us away for a while.

Directed by Danny cannon

a new High Definition blu-ray transfer has been given to this 90's action classic
and the picture quality does look amazing for sure, very sharp & clear picture quality in 2:35:1 widescreen not much Grain at all, hardly none
better than the old DVD release
a new 5.1 Master audio mix has been added aswell, so the sound quality does sound incredible
again better than the old DVD release
plus this new blu-ray version is ALL REGIONS

tragically no new special features at all, no new retrospective featurette
with Director Danny cannon, Sylvester stallone or Diane Lane
the only extra is the 20min behind the scenes TV broadcast promo featurette hosted by Sylvester stallone
which was broadcast on TV when the film was in Theaters
i think it's the same extra from the old DVD release anyway
i also know the old DVD release had an Audio commentary track with Director Danny cannon
well the Audio commentary has been removed it's not on this new blu-ray

but if you love Judge Dredd, time for an upgrade for sure get this new blu-ray version which is ALL REGIONS
better than the old DVD release for sure
the film itself deserves about 4-5stars
this blu-ray release is 3 stars only, based on lack of new extras

This blu-ray has very solid video and audio, head and shoulders above the DVD, obviously.
However, I do have a complaint.  I wish this blu-ray had some decent extras.  It does have a short 20 something minute making of documentary but more extras should have been on this release.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Plagued by production delays and reported feuds between its star and director, `Judge Dredd' fizzled at the US box office in the summer of 1995, though it did much better overseas, where Sylvester Stallone was still selling tickets. In his own backyard, Sylvester Stallone's performance was mocked by critics, who also attacked the film's futuristic design as derivative (not without reason) and its effects as cheesy, which some of them were, due to time constraints. Sylvester Stallone was nominated for a Razzie as the worst actor of that year.

Time has been kind to `Judge Dredd,' vindicating those who enjoyed it sitting and watching it in the cinema and of course fans who have discovered it since it was released for home video viewing. By today's CGI standards, all of its effects look cheesy and slightly dated, which is to say, they're largely practical or based on miniatures. After sitting through one cutting-edge computer-generated environment after another, filled with actors who seem increasingly detached from their surroundings, these kinds of productions have acquired new appeal. As for the film's derivative elements, who among us can keep count of the dystopian futurist tales to which we've been exposed in the last two decades? At some point, they all begin to look the same and anything with a coherent story and a memorable character stands apart from the pack. `Judge Dredd' has both, and a lot more.

The character originated in a 1977 comic series first published in the British anthology 2000AD. Director Danny Cannon, who was in his early twenties and had only made one previous film when he was tapped to direct, grew up reading the Dredd comics and had definite ideas about how the character should appear on film. Unfortunately, Sylvester Stallone was the star, and he too had ideas, which included showing his face, unlike the graphic character, who never did. Entire books were written about the production battles, but that's too big a subject for this review.

The unmistakable and uncredited, voice of James Earl Jones provides our introduction to the bleak future world of Judge Dredd. Humanity is crowded into a few habitable areas called ""Mega-cities"" that are walled off from the rest of the parched land known as the Cursed Earth. The overcrowded Mega-cities became anarchic and ungovernable until a new order was instituted, based upon the Law and enforced by Judges, each of whom combines the function of judge, jury and executioner. The greatest, most respected and fearsome is Judge Joseph Dredd [Sylvester Stallone]. As our introduction to how the system works, Dredd subdues a vicious ""block war"" in a vertiginous residential neighbourhood, ""judging"" and mowing down dozens of combatants, including one of the warlord ringleaders [James Remar]. His only assistance is a junior ""street"" judge named Hershey [Diane Lane] and a rookie who doesn't survive the operation.

Caught up in the melee is Herman 'Fergee' Ferguson [Rob Schneider], freshly paroled from Aspen Penitentiary. Truly an innocent bystander, he is nevertheless judged by Dredd as a repeat offender and returned to prison for a five-year term. It's the film's first hint that the Law may be overly severe.

The Judges answer to a Council of Justices, of which the leader is Dredd's mentor, Chief Justice Fargo [Max von Sydow]. After the severity of Dredd's handling of the block war, the Chief Justice orders his star pupil to spend two days a week at the Judges' Academy teaching, of all things, ethics to young cadets, including a rising star, Cadet Nathan Olmeyer [Balthazar Getty]. Hershey reproaches Dredd for being too severe in his portrayal of a Judge's lonely existence, but this is life as Dredd understands it. He has no friends and resists all emotion. He had a friend once, but he had to judge him. Dredd's ""friend"" was actually his brother, Rico [Armand Assante], also a Judge. Contrary to what Dredd and the rest of the world believe, Rico isn't dead but in isolation under maximum security in Aspen Penitentiary. In a scene that recalls Demolition Man, Rico is brought a message from a secret ""benefactor"" by Warden Miller [Maurice Roves], which provides an opportunity for a dramatic and bloody escape.

One more detail: Rico kills Vartis Hammond [Mitch Ryan] and his wife, on camera while successfully impersonating Dredd. Dredd, who can't dispute the Law, is tried, convicted and sentenced to death, but his surrogate father, Chief Justice Fargo, is able to spare his life by resigning and invoking an old custom that the last wish of a resigning Justice be granted. Fargo's successor, Justice Griffin [J&uuml;rgen Prochnow], who suggested the strategy, I wonder why? But commutes Judge Dredd's sentence to life imprisonment.

Just like previous films of this calibre, Dredd's prison shuttle is shot down en route, and Dredd has to fight his way through numerous obstacles back to Mega-city, accompanied by Herman 'Fergee' Ferguson [Rob Schneider], who just happened to be seated next to him for the aborted trip to prison. Meanwhile, Rico is pursuing a crazy plan involving world domination, assisted by a mad scientist, Dr. Hayden [Joan Chen] and Dredd is learning dark secrets about himself and the Council that force him to reconsider the truths by which he's lived his life. Really, though, the latter half of the film is all about fireballs, bullets, brawn, explosions, flying motorcycles, killer robots and comic relief from Herman 'Fergee' Ferguson (who does a wickedly funny Dredd impression). All that stuff about ""the Law"" pretty much goes out the window, or, to be more precise, over the side of the Statue of Liberty, which, in its newly transplanted location, is where Rico and Dredd have their final battle.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Judge Dredd' was shot by the late Adrian Biddle, whose last film before his untimely death of a heart attack at age 52 was V for Vendetta.' Even at the time, in the pre-digital intermediate era, the film was striking for the clarity of its imagery and the intensity of its blues. Disney's 1080p encoded Blu-ray ranks in the upper tier of their recent round of catalogue releases, reproducing Biddle's shimmering images with a touch less ""pop"", but with an appropriately saturated palette that fully differentiates between the steely blue and grey world of the Judges and the more colourful cacophony of the rest of Mega-city and not to mention the sickly yellow of the Cursed Earth. Detail is sufficiently well rendered that you can easily tell, as you could with a good film print in 1995, which effects shots were rushed at the last minute. Black levels and shadow detail are good, and there is no evidence of detail filtering or artificial sharpening. The film's grain structure is visible, but it's extremely fine. Nothing in the way of compression artefacts presented itself.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  There's nothing subtle or restrained about Judge Dredd's 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track. It's loud, aggressive and in-your-face, like the title character. None of the weapons sound like ordinary gunfire; they're all ramped-up superguns. The crash of the prison transport in the Cursed Earth is especially impressive, if you like your effects noisy, as is the grand finale in Dr. Hayden's lab. A chase sequence involving airborne police scooters offers some nice panning effects, and Rico's robot is good for a few bass notes. In general, those who enjoy bombastic action tracks can expect a good time. One doesn't watch Judge Dredd for the dialogue, but it's clear and intelligible, even with Sylvester Stallone and Armand Assante trying to outdo each other. Alan Silvestri's score is frequently drowned out by the effects, but when you hear it, it strikes the appropriately martial tone. (The balance in favour of the effects isn't a fault of the Blu-ray; it's always been mixed like that.)

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Stallone's Law: The Making of Judge Dredd [1995] [20:02] What's this, a new feature on a Disney Blu-ray? Not exactly new, but this made-for-TV promotional piece from 1995 was not included on Disney's 1998 DVD of Judge Dredd.' Hosted by Sylvester Stallone, and it features on-set interviews with the entire principal cast, as well as director Danny Cannon and many of the department heads and effects people. It's slickly produced and more informative than many contemporary documentaries.'

Theatrical Trailer [1995] [480i] [4:3] [2:11] Among other notable features, it opens with a short narration by James Earl Jones.

Sneak Peaks: At the start-up the Blu-ray disc plays trailers for Frankenweenie' and ABC TV on Blu-ray, plus an anti-smoking. The main menu has an option for ""Sneak Peeks"" that plays these trailers, plus trailers for Who Framed Roger Rabbit,' The Avengers,' and Castle: Season 4' on ABC TV on DVD.

Finally, of course, the reason for Disney to release Judge Dredd' on Blu-ray at this moment is the release of `Dredd' 3D which of course as you will read by my Review shows you the new film character is an entirely different take on the character and a welcome re-boot. For one thing, Karl Urban's `Dredd' 3D never removes his helmet, which is a good sign, especially a total homage to the fans of the brilliant comic book 2000 AD. Stallone's version will always be a unique creation. Disney has done a capable job with the Blu-ray, especially for the fans; but if you're new to the Judge Dredd experience, you might want to rent this first, before actually purchasing this particular Blu-ray. I know this film has had its critics, but I love it and have always enjoyed it when I had it on an inferior NTSC DVD, but now owning it on this stunning and far superior Blu-ray format, I feel even more proud to add it to my extensive Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

5147320,3,B008C0C1Y8,"Judge Dredd is the first official attempt to bring the oddball British comic digest 2000 AD to the big screen, with Sylvester Stallone starring as the magazine's most visible character, Judge Dredd. This film is based heavily on the earlier Judge Dredd comics of the 70s and early 80s, and marries ultraviolent action to deadpan humor and oddball camp. Judge Dredd's evil twin brother Rico escapes from prison and plots to replace the council of judges (who de-facto run Megacity 1 by enforcing its laws) with his own patsies. Rico organizes Dredd's exile from the city, and Dredd must sneak back in against the efforts of his fellow judges and Rico's fearsome ABC warbot to bring his perp brother to justice. So far so good.

Judge Dredd also nails the universe of the comics pretty much spot on. The film's setting Megacity 1 is a ridiculous hodgepodge metropolis that seems to straddle apocolyptic squalor with bands of oblivious luxury. It is jammed with buildings and dwellings and is generally quite silly but nobody who has read the comic will miss what it is meant to be. The judges look pretty great too- the post-fascist metal eagles, chains, and other crazy motifs that bedeck their uniforms and bikes are faithfully reproduced here (the judge uniforms were custom made by Versace and supposedly account for a nontrivial part of the film's huge budget). The hellish wastes of the Cursed Earth are also represented and they are appropriately desert-ey and cannibal-filled.

At this point you may be wondering what everyone's problem with this film is, and the answer is Judge Dredd himself. Not to put too fine a point on it, but Stallone is nothing like Dredd. He spends most of the film helmetless, romances a pretty lady cop, and has Rob Schneider as a comedy sidekick- in other words, he's just doing Demolition Man again, without the benefit of the equally bananas Wesly Snipes. And that's just no good- Judge Dredd is a heartless, stoney, unflinching justice machine who is so far from human emotion that he once gave up his orphaned neice because he worried her love for him would make him less ruthless. And he NEVER takes off his helmet.

The end result is that while Judge Dredd is a competent film, and maybe even a decent Judge Dredd film, it is an AWFUL movie ABOUT Judge Dredd, if that distinction makes any sense.

PROS
-Lavish effects and solid action sequences.
-Excellent depiction of Megacity 1.
-Captures the atmosphere of early Dredd comics.

CONS
-Depiction of Dredd himself is pretty lacking.",1376006400,,2525,4.849187935034803
5147321,2,B008C0C1Y8,"What happens when they take a classic comic book character and give it to someone who doesn't care about him?

Well, this is what happens.

Having come out just after Demolition Man, I had some hope for this Stallone portrayal but this is a Stallone movie, not a Dredd movie. Even the slipcover has Stallone's name in bigger print than the character's and shows Stallone's face. In nearly 40 years of stories, Dredd has never shown his face. This is a middle-of-the-road Stallone showcase.

Not worth buying, hardly worth watching when it's run on TV.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie and check out the Karl Urban version instead.",1373500800,3,639,4.72972972972973
5147322,4,B008C0C1Y8,"For a high production value, it nails a lot of aspects of the series: Blade Runner-style mega-city, impractical uniforms, gritty urban violence and decay, the wasteland of the Cursed Earth and the weapons and vehicles (including flying cars).

But even for all that, there are problems: one character who absolutely should be played by Stallone is not, an obvious clue in a major event taking place is ignored when everyone should know about it, and a few other things.

Since this is an adaptation of the Judge Dredd comics made by 2000 AD, I'll list some of this film's huge cardinal sins:

1) Dredd's face is shown --- In the comics, he is never revealed. Since 1977, his face has been masked or in shadow, and while we can approximate what he looks like, the exact image is a mystery
2) Romance ---- Judges like Dredd are absolutely forbidden to have relationships, with anyone, or they hand in their badge, but this film brings it in anyway
3) The uniforms --- While mostly gotten right, the film has a harness instead of the gold chain connected to a large badge for the standard uniform, for no clear reason
4) Rico --- As noted above, he should look like Dredd, since they're clones, but while Armand Assante does a great job at acting, the crew dropped the ball on having Stallone double himself
5) Fergee --- In the comics a big bruiser with a slight learning curve, but here via Rob Schneider a comic relief hacker
6) Professor Dredd --- Dredd is a street Judge, and while he was offered the Chief Judgeship, he refused, so why this film has him teaching cadets at the Academy is baffling (and they put him in uniform, and show his face)
7) Dredd the Comedian --- In the comics, he's pretty much always stone-faced, but here he has a full range of emotions

The film is fun enough and watchable (plot's certainly not lacking, and the violence is good), but for Dredd fans, it can be a hard pill to swallow with all its errors.",1371168000,4,1937,4.50997150997151
5147323,5,B008C0C1Y8,Stallone is Judge Dredd the future world was awesome and on blu-ray it is even better. The action is non-stop. It's a must own if your a Stallone fan.,1370217600,,150,4.206896551724138

5147326,5,B008C0C1Y8,"despite the evolution of special effects, for some reason the remake failed to capture the heart of the movie. Judge Dredd is about the law, Stallone gets that point across. Behind that icy stare lies a heart of Gold and Stallone shows that as well. The special effects may seem a bit cheesy at some points but overall they stand up to the test of time. A few critics said that Stallone's performance was a bit over the top, to which I can only say that this is a comic book based movie. there is no real way to bring this character to the big screen without being over the top. though I must say that I think his performance when taken in context is quite memorable and stands out. Just like in Rocky, his body language says as much about the character as by what he says. This is a fun movie. lots of action and sci-fi touches. I guess you can call it a sleeper-classic as most people I know remember this movie quite fondly. It's a great looking movie, and looks even better on blu ray.",1366588800,2,989,4.238095238095238

Dredd gets trapped in a building by bad guys, then he proceeds to blow them away for the rest of the movie with hardly any dialogue or purpose given other than ""they're bad, I'm good.""

Stallone""s Judge Dredd is far from great, but there's a story for God's sake! This is the movie to buy if you want a Dredd movie.",1363305600,3,552,4.3076923076923075
5147330,2,B008C0C1Y8,"With the  release of the startling excellent new film Dredd starring Karl Urban, I decided to revisit the 1995 adaptation of Judge Dredd, which is  purely coincidental being released on Blu-ray the same week . You may remember this as Sylvester Stallone's forerunner to Arnold Schwarzenegger's comic book turn in Batman & Robin, if your fortunate you don't. It would be a misnomer to say that time has been unkind to Judge Dredd as 1995 wasn't too kind to it either.
 Making his Demolition Man look like intellectual high art in comparison, Stallone stars as Judge ""Joseph"" Dredd, I place the name in quotes because no where in the Dredd mythology I have seen on line tells me that he has a first name let alone such a generic one, I would have gone with Zowie or Starbuck if I had been the writer. Anyway, in this grim, but colorful future, society has run amok with most people living inside closed off mega cities, those not so lucky live in the post-apocalyptic world outside called ""the cursed Earth"". The Judges are a band of elite cops, who also act as jury and executioner, there are no defenses, pardons or what not, still everyone pleads innocent.
 Dredd (Sly) is the most fearsome, toughest, silliest looking of all the judges, his name is spoken in such a way to tell us so. This time however he finds himself on the wrong side of the law (""I am the law""), framed for a murder and forced to go the Richard Kimble route to prove his innocence, taking along with him a petty criminal (Rob Schneider) who has the misfortune to be handcuffed or shackled or something to Dredd.
 The bad guy is a rogue Nazi judge (Jurgen Prochnow) who has his sights set on an even more cluttered future world with cloned judges doing the jobs of totally capable currently living officers. So he in lists the help of Ricco (Armand Assante) who also happens to be Dredd's brother and whom he judged and sent to prison. Yada yada yada.
 I wish I could say that the movie has never looked more dreadful, but truth is that it looks pretty darn good in this new Blu-ray edition. We can see and appreciate the hard work that went into the corny, but stylish production design. The visual effects are quite good, even by today's standards, not as much silly looking CGI as I had expected, this future world looks sort of like the world of the Fifth Element, maybe at night. It's such a vivid creation it's a shame it's in the service of such a routine action picture.
 Stallone is severely miscast as Dredd, he looks and sounds silly, also I have never seen him hammier than this. The performance is so broad, you have to wonder is Sly thought this was a comedy. However, an interesting review by Roger Ebert from the time of the movie's release has him disagreeing with me and writing that Stallone is ""ideal for a role this, because he is smart enough and funny enough to pull it off."" I like Stallone too, I gleefully overpraised his recent the Expendables 2, but I'm not sure what Roger was thinking, Sly isn't funny and I won't touch upon the subject of his smarts.
 Also very bad is Schneider, in a role written for Joe Pesci, he seems badly out of place. He has terrible one liners, slows down the action, and is completely unnecessary. This movie is already too campy, we don't require additional comic relief.
 Yet, it is this film's strong supporting cast that stands out. Assante and Prochnow are excellent as the villains. Diane Lane is gorgeous and tough in equal measures as Dredd's partner and love interest. There are good bits from James Remar and Scott Wilson. Max Von Sydow delivers a surprisingly vivid and moving performance that doesn't belong here, but is very welcome none the less. Joan Chen, unfortunately appears just so that Lane has someone to fight with at the end.
 I always felt that this movie either needed to be a lot tougher or a lot more comical, the recent film tells me it's the former, not the later. Still, I have got to admit, it wasn't as bad as I remember it being. The flying motorcycle chase recalls the final to Star Wars, and the closing theme song by the Cure is a little beauty all it's own. Despite it's R-rating, this is much more tame than many PG-13 films today, and will be best appreciated by those not old enough for the new movie and too young to recall the first released.

5147334,5,B008C0C1Y8,So many people who don't get what this picture was and is all about.  It's an adaptation of a British Comic book at a time when the comic adaptation was looked upon as a step down for a star of Stallone's stature (go figure - now they're a career maker!).  Stallone paid the price with the critics for his choice but the audiences loved it.  It's got it all and as for those who say it steals from everybody else well they might wanna check their chronology again because it did a lot things first!  It's great action entertainment and tho Stallone's stoicism was tailor made for this role he gives it his all as always.  The sets and special effects hold up magnificently and the action flows like fine wine.  Looking for a slam bang evening?  Then look no further.  Just remember what I said...if this were made today...it would star Slater or Gordon-Levitt and would get much more respect than it's even getting here in misguided reviews.  Think fun.  Think action.  Think enjoyment.  Because that's what this movie has got to offer up in spades.,1361059200,2,1049,4.550802139037433

You get a very good and entertaining movie that has good special effects, action scenes, plot, and awsome sound.  Stallone of course is Judge Dredd and man can he get things done because he respects the law and operates by it.  He feels that the law does not make mistakes, until he is convicted for a murder he did not commit.  He gets teamed up with Rob Schnieder, who he judged strictly to find out why he was framed for the murder.  Rob Schnieder adds a comedic part to the movie, so the movie is not all action.

5147343,4,B008C0C1Y8,"While critics and fanboys alike roasted the Sylvester Stallone version of Judge Dredd I found that the movie was very entertaining.

First, the city looks MEGA.  This looks like a futuristic city where tens of millions of people live.  The look of the movie is great.  Second, the plot is solid.  The story itself is actually quite good.  Third, the cast is excellent.  Stallone is ideal as a big screen Dredd, while Armand Assante, Diane Lane, and Max Von Sydow give fantastic performances.

What's the drawback?  Rob Schneider.  His performance is a little too comic, and he goes just a little too far over the top.  Plus, his character has about 10 minutes too much screen time.  Thus, like Jar Jar Binks, he (for many people) ruins the movie.  Then again, his character goes a long way towards humanizing Dredd and reminding him that justice sometimes means following the spirit of the law, not just the letter of the law.  What is right and just isn't always what is specifically written in the law.  By the end of the movie Dredd learns this thanks to Fergie.

But even though Dredd IS humanized he is still an engine of destruction taking out the lawless.  Even at the end, where Dredd has been humanized, he is still a nearly unstoppable force out to bring justice to Mega City One.

Yes, this version of Judge Dredd borders on camp. BORDERS on camp.  It doesn't cross that line the way, say, Demolition Man did.  It may have a few campy moments, but there is still a serious movie in here among the bits of humor and campy over the top characters.

Judge Dredd may not be a great movie, but it is good, and it is VERY entertaining.  And the blu ray looks a lot better than the original DVD did.  A lot better.",1348272000,3,1718,4.470967741935484
