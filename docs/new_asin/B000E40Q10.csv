8105620,5,B000E40Q10,My grandson seems to enjoy this DVD.,1508630400,,36,4.285714285714286
8105621,4,B000E40Q10,"We don't watch a lot of TV and I wasn't sure who or what Noodlebug was but I bought this for my almost 2 year old daughter that likes music and to dance around. She was pretty mesmerized by this and likes several of the songs enough to say ""play it again"". The first day we got this we watched it 2x in a row. Overall for dance/move videos it is easy to watch and while I sometimes find it strange to see random live kids in videos children love it and this is no exception. If you are looking for a light, easy to watch and listen to movie for your youngsters than this is for you. I may check out the other videos in this series as well.",1469491200,,639,3.923076923076923

8105624,5,B000E40Q10,"We ran across this series at our local library and my 2.5 year old twins ADORE it! It's perfect songs with the animations + real kids makes Noodlebug a true winner for little kids.  And it's 5 minute or less stories/transitions keep kiddos interested.  Everyday my girls wake up to the Noodlebug CD on their alarm and practically cry when it turns off.  While the tunes are catchy, they aren't annoying like some kid songs ;)",1331424000,,425,4.565789473684211
8105625,3,B000E40Q10,"I have bought this item 3, yes, THREE times, and each time the DVD skips. The other Noodlebug DVD we have is fine, but there is something wrong with this one. Don't buy it, although if you do, Amazon has great customer service and easy returns. Too bad, because my daughter LOVES this video and even watches it when it skips, but it's to annoying for me!",1247702400,,354,4.298507462686567
8105626,5,B000E40Q10,"My granddaughter is 9 months old and is absolutely enthralled when I play this video.  She loves watching the children and all of the bright colors.  She ""dances"" to many of the songs.  I think this is one that she will enjoy for many years to come!",1174608000,,249,4.25531914893617
8105627,2,B000E40Q10,"The DVD I received was very poor quality-constantly displayed pixals and skipped.  Also, this DVD is just a compilation of songs from the other Noodlebug videos.",1138320000,6,161,5.1923076923076925
