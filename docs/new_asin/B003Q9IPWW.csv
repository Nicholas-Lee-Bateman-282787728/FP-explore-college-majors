8402240,5,B003Q9IPWW,This documentary is by far one of the most beautiful and artistically made films I have seen. It takes the inner struggles of a family that is far from perfect and portrays the exasperating complexity of what it means to be human and the unrecognized circle people find themselves going into as they enter adulthood and blindly follow in the tragic footprints of their parents. This documentary is honest and breathtakingly filmed. I enjoyed this very much.,1371686400,2,457,4.9480519480519485

  ""October Country"" is the story of family, and how after one generation loses its way, it becomes difficult for the future ones to return. The subjects of the documentary are the Moshers, a working class family living in the Mohawk Valley of central New York. The family is headed by Don, a retired Policeman and veteran, and his wife Dottie. In the film, they reflect on the choices made by their children and grandchildren, which have spun the family into a depressing repetition of failed marriages, abusive relationships, teen pregnancy, poverty, and substance abuse.
  Don, who is deeply scarred by his time in Vietnam and the gulf war, is emotionally distant and mentally defeated. His wife, Dottie, does her best to hold her family together, while trying to come to terms with the choices they've made. The town itself reflects the crumbling relationships of the family, with only one plant employing most of the population, and Walmart being the only place to shop. It's an area as depressing as the Mosher's story.
  ""October Country"" addresses the question, When you are hurt or disappointed by those you love, what is left? Can a cycle of bad choices be broken? And when should you stop trying to fix other people? There is no real resolution to these questions in the film. It seems that all you are really left with is the fact that despite pain, people continue whether they want to or not. Ghosts of the past follow you, and sometimes the future doesn't look so bright either. While watching a year with the Mosher family, one can't help but think there are thousands of other American families experiencing the same thing. There is a light in the tunnel however, in the form of Desiree, the Mosher's spunky granddaughter, who seems to recognize the mistakes of her mother and sister, as well as the hopelessness of the area.
  This is a difficult film to describe, because its beauty lies in it simplicity. There is a story there, but the story is somehow less significant than the result. Change is what is important. I don't know how this wonderfully filmed documentary has fallen under the radar. I found it completely engrossing and honest. I really love documentaries and I think this one of the best I've seen in years. It's as if someone just turned the camera on and caught a portrait American lives that some people would rather just forget. A lot of families have problems that last through generations, and there is a root to every problem. However, it's not always on the surface and easy to dissect. This movie is an honest attempt to examine a family in decline from all angles. You just have to see it.",1360540800,2,2679,4.707264957264957
8402242,5,B003Q9IPWW,"At the beginning of the film Dottie (matriarch of the featured family) tells us that without family you have nothing. And although the Mosher clan is potentially the definition of dysfunctional, her words ring true throughout. There is a clear sense during October Country that without each other none of them would survive.

The Mohawk Valley is a depressed town in New York with little to offer. The Mosher family (a lower-middle-class people) is followed for a year during the fall months only. This documentary focuses on the day-to-day hardships of seven members of the Mosher family.

Dottie: Matriarch and optimist. Dottie tries to find the good in everything and everyone, only to be disappointed in the end.

Don: Plagued by the past, Vietnam veteran Don is perhaps the most realistic and rational of the group. He is a very cold and distant man who is troubled by one question: is this the real me, or have I been created as this man?

Denise: Estranged sister to Don, she is a lonely woman who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis. As a practicing Wiccan and ghost hunter she spends most of her time at the local cemetery where she speaks to the dead. Denise is not seen with another member of the Mosher family until the finale.

Donna: Donna is the only daughter of Don and Dottie. She is a sad sort of person who has made all of the wrong decisions in life (and lived to see the consequences of her choices).

Danielle: In every possible way Danielle is a clone of her mother (Donna). A sadly pretty young woman Danielle is following in her mother's footsteps by making negative choices for herself and her child.

Desi: In all this dysfunction there is the teenager Desi (sister to Danielle). Desi is the most ""normal"" of the group, yet she is odd and lives in a fantasy world alone (not unlike her Aunt Denise).

Chris: Technically not a Mosher, Chris is the adoptive son of Don and Debra. Chris' life is on a downward spiral of criminal activity and lawlessness.

The family fights for some sort of stability in life, and although they all seem aware of their problems there is no effort to change.

October Country is a beautifully awkward look at a family in perpetual struggle. Some could see it as depressing; others though will see it as an inspiration. Any family can survive their ghosts if they stick together",1325548800,2,2331,4.663414634146341
