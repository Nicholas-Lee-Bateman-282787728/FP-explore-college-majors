7071279,5,B00UUERGJ4,"Sara! From one mama to another, THANK YOU! I don't know how you think of these moves, but they are so fun & effective. I love feeling completely ""worked out"" & ""stretched out"" at the same time. I LOVE Expecting More & those workouts carried me through my last two (of four) pregnancies. I have always hoped you'd do a post-natal program. As I've been recovering from delivering a very large 4th baby I'm beginning to understand I put too much focus on ""getting my body back"" as opposed to ""healing my body""...how cool that both can be achieved with this program.",1436227200,7,562,4.519607843137255
7071280,5,B00UUERGJ4,This really works! I used Expecting More when pregant and this DVD at 6 weeks post partem. The workouts are easy to fit into the day and I can actually see abs now - seriously... and this is my second child! I did not even have abs when I was 21 and doing yoga daily. I can't recommend this enough.,1483920000,,298,3.9833333333333334
7071281,5,B00UUERGJ4,"This workout is super helpful as you begin working out again post baby. I bought this after my second baby was born, via my second c-section. I am very active pre-pregnancy and was active during my pregnancy and loved these workouts in the first several weeks/months starting back. I really like the core exercises that are modified for both diastasis recti and c-sections (I had both of those). It's nice that Sara is a mother herself! Highly recommend this program!",1483833600,3,467,4.85
7071282,5,B00UUERGJ4,"I would recommend this workout set to any new mother.  I loved that the workouts offer modifications that were gentle enough for me to begin when my baby was little (I started at 8 weeks), yet also with options challenging enough that 9 months later I am STILL using this video regularly.  The workouts are super efficient - in just about 20 minutes I can easily get in enough cardio, strength, and stretch, with enough variety that I keep coming back.",1476403200,2,452,4.567901234567901
7071283,4,B00UUERGJ4,"I love the core parts of this DVD.  It is really useful when coming back from having a baby.  It helped me regain my core strength without hurting myself or pushing myself too hard in the beginning. I slowly worked up to the more difficult  levels that she provides. However, the only thing I did not like was the cardio portion.  The cardio portion has kind of rhythmic-dancing moves that are hard for me to do when I'm also watching my toddler in the room... It's probably just because I lack some rhythm, but if you are a dancer or like to dance, I could see you really liking the cardio portion.",1475712000,3,599,4.321428571428571
7071284,5,B00UUERGJ4,"Great workout for new moms to get back in shape.
I was looking for some workout DVD that would address the diastasis separation of the abdominal muscles.
This workout takes care of that, as well as it full body and cardio, is gentle and very effective.
Worth the time and money.",1475452800,2,278,4.470588235294118
7071285,5,B00UUERGJ4,Love this workout! It's perfect for slowly getting back into shape after baby!,1471737600,,78,5.076923076923077
7071286,5,B00UUERGJ4,"I love it! I had my first baby almost a year ago, I wasn't feel good with my body, especially with my belly, I bought this one, and after just 6 days of workout I feel my TVA works!!",1466121600,2,182,3.6923076923076925
7071287,5,B00UUERGJ4,I can finally feel my abs engaging and am starting to see my stomach flatten. I'm very happy with this workout dvd!,1465516800,3,115,4.2727272727272725
7071288,5,B00UUERGJ4,I don't usually leave reviews but I liked this product so much I just had to. I started the program 7 weeks postpartum. My daughter is 13 weeks now and I'm already back to pre pregnancy weight. Sara is awesome. The routines start out really slow at first easing you back into working out. The program has you do 2 of each week in a row before moving on to a new week. I didn't do this I went from week 1 to week 3 to week 5 and so on. This is because I felt ready to do this if it's not for you take it slow and you will see results! Each routine is geared to postpartum women and Sara shows 3 different levels for each workout so u can pick you're poison. So one day you might be feeling great and follow the level 3 exercising and the next day (after a night of cluster feedings) you may not have then energy so you follow level 1. Love this routine for bringing your body back to shape.  I feel confident that when I finish this video I will be in great shape and ready to move on to some intense work outs and hopefully have the best body of my life. 2 months to bikini season in New England!! Thanks to this video I won't need to buy a whole new larger wardrobe!!,1457568000,4,1168,3.9491525423728815
7071289,5,B00UUERGJ4,Great workouts! She explains everything really well and always reminds viewer to check in with their TVA. I hope she releases another video soon. Love her positivity!!,1457395200,,167,5.222222222222222
8708319,5,B00UUERGJ4,"I just finished 12 weeks of this program!  I was 1 year post birth of my 3rd baby when I started. I was looking for a great program with modifications and am so glad I found this one. I had a considerable diastasis recti after my last 2 babes were transverse breech and needed a work out that would help me regain my core strength without making my diastasis worse. I can honestly say I loved this program. The gradual increase in intensity and duration of work outs really help to build stamina, strength, and endurance. And just when you feel like quitting, Sara says just the right thing to keep you going!  I would recommend this program to all Mama's!",1529280000,,656,4.413223140495868
8708320,5,B00UUERGJ4,Another disc collecting dust. Fun to watch.,1513728000,,43,5.285714285714286
8708321,5,B00UUERGJ4,"Search no further for the PERFECT post-partum workout systemyou have arrived!

Saras workouts are the perfect transition to a fit, strong, and healthy post-partum body. Each workout has three different levels of intensity and modifications for women with diastasis recti/abdominal separations. Theyre customizable enough to reach every mom.

If you follow the included calendar (super handy!), the workouts gradually increase in difficulty starting with core strength, and then add in new goals like strengthening and toningand eventually cardio. Plus Sara is completely adorable and so very encouraging. All her encouragements keep me motivated at just the right time when I feel like I want to quit.

Whether you were fit before pregnancy or this is your first real go at exercising, this video set will give you confidence and strength, plus having the abs youve always wanted doesnt hurt, too. Expect resultsif you put in the time you will definitely get them. I am seeing fantastic results and, best of all, I feel so good!

I am six months post-partum with my fourth child and am soooo wishing I had these workouts after my other kids were born. Whenever I finish using these videos (although its hard to imagine a time when I won't use them), I definitely plan on picking up her Sweat Unlimited workout videos. Being able to get a decent workout in at home is beyond convenient.",1512691200,2,1385,5.008695652173913
8708322,5,B00UUERGJ4,"I didn't care for the Expecting More prenatal workouts, but on a whim I ordered these. I really like them, and I think the calendar thats included is great for easing back in to exercise and strengthening your core after baby. I wish I would have got it sooner postpartum, but Ill have it handy for next time.",1511395200,,309,4.344827586206897
8708323,4,B00UUERGJ4,Great for easing back into fitness,1510185600,,34,4.833333333333333
8708324,5,B00UUERGJ4,So supportive and real! Found Sara on Instagram had to try her workout!,1509580800,,71,4.538461538461538
8708325,5,B00UUERGJ4,"So in love with Sara! I was worried about working out after having my son because I didn't want to do it wrong. I have been doing these work outs for about a month, and I am convinced that she is a genius. I will be buying more of her products. I am feeling stronger and more confident every week!!",1505952000,,298,3.9833333333333334
8708326,5,B00UUERGJ4,Thanks,1499126400,,6,6.0
8708327,5,B00UUERGJ4,"I am really enjoying the postnatal workouts with these DVDs. I started after 6 weeks of delivery after doctor's approval, and followed the exercises as per the suggested schedule. It really helped me ease back into fitness and get my strength back, the exercises do get more challenging as you progress, and it is a great way to recover after delivery. Really liked Sara's style, she is bubbly and cute. Very happy with the purchase!",1493337600,2,433,4.786666666666667
8708328,5,B00UUERGJ4,Love Sara Haley's level system so you can do what you feel like and challenge yourself if you want to. Her exercises were definitely helping my separated stomach muscles after giving birth.,1487721600,2,189,4.9375
