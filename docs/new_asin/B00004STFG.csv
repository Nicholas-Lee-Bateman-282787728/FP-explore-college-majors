Each animal is assigned a musical instrument. It's easily viewed in segments, which is a good way to view it with this age. Our babies were delighted with this, they laughed, cooed and clapped their hands, smiled and touched the screen. Kids liked guessing which animal was coming next, calling out the shapes and dancing and playing along.",1000166400,2,509,5.071428571428571
7921964,5,B00004STFG,"The Baby Music School - Classical video is a great hit with our baby, who has been watching it since he was 6 months old. After watching the video only twice, he started looking to the television when we played a cassette tape of classical music. The simple but very intersting and colorful graphics in the video capture young babies attention, and the movement keeps older babies wathcing. Our baby plays ""peek-a-boo"" along with the elephant character as the elephant peeks it's eyes out between waves of water.  Our son is now almost 9 months old and still loves it. He has worked it into his bedtime routine and watches it other times when it seems like he could use a little help winding down. We highly recommend this video.",984873600,,729,4.607692307692307
