755864,3,6303934668,"As the French comedy ""Battement de Coeur,"" this must have been oh so charmant. Mais. En Anglais, and directed by the torpid Sam Wood, it's the epitome of an old movie on the late, late show. Ginger Rogers tries  hard but this is her umteenth version of ""Cinderella"" and the  strain is starting to show... Basil Rathbone jumps at the chance to play  something besides Sherlock Holmes, but as so often, his comedy style  consists of raised eyebrows and scampering around the set. Not the finest  hour of either of these two great stars. Quelle drag, n'est ce pas?",958780800,5,561,4.626262626262626

756003,4,6303934668,"Charming little fluff piece of a film.  Great chemistry between the delightful Ginger Rogers and the handsome French actor Jean Pierre Aumont.  Forgot he was such a handsome man ;)  Definitely a stretch to believe that Ginger ( who first emerged as Fred Astaire's dancing partner 13 years previously in films) as a fresh faced school girl. But hey it's a movie.  They were charming together.

A bit disappointed that the School of Pick Pockets run by Basil Rathbone was a small part of the movie. Being such a major star, surprised that Basil had such a small role in the film.  Classic cinema fans will enjoy some of the stellar character actors of the era- Adolph Menjou as the elegant official with the unfaithful wife and Reginald Gardiner as the friend of Aumont's/",1468627200,4,770,4.708955223880597

-Great cast
-Lovable characters
-Good writing
-Overall good execution

Cons:
-Premise is common for the time and not very real-life (of course maybe that is a reason to watch too)
-(Early on in the movie) Do you really expect to find love with someone who is in an adulterous relationship? (again another common theme in this time-period, but has been reinvented now so maybe it is not so dated)

756239,2,6303934668,"I think this is the first movie of Ginger Rogers I've ever watched, she's an attractive woman, entering middle age in this film; however, her artistic abilities would've been more appreciated in a different film where the content of the story was closer to the real concerns and tribulations of the human race; the audience, I feel, remains expectant of some advice to better their lives and to upgrade their personal philosophy of existence.

This does not happen, the story is hollow and never materializes into anything valuable.

I could not remember what the film was about, I had to go back to the reviews to get a memory call to write this opinion. Evidently, is not a film that stays to you or sticks to your mind as a well done movie.

I was surprised to learn this movie was not early Ginger because it seemed like she was still learning how to be wonderful. This movie was made in 1946 some 16 years after her first movie and yet many of her earlier movies were much better.

It was fun to see Basil Rathbone who played Sherlock Homes. He was well cast in Heartbeat.

Not that this movie is bad, Ginger lacked her wit and intelligence and was too much the silly blonde. That is not the Ginger I have come to love so I was a little disappointed.

The film is so dated that others might not even be interested in watching it all the way through. Rathbone mugs vaudeville melodrama and Rogers mugs tough talking blond hooligan leads of this period.

However, there are several class hurdles to overcome and misunderstanding to overcome in the process as well.  Ginger Rogers, although not her youngest in this film, nonetheless pulls off the role admirably.  And the movie is quite simply an excellent one.

756504,4,6303934668,"In this 1946 comedic role, 18-year-old Arlette Lafon (35-year old Ginger Rogers) has a Doris-Day-mixed-with-Nancy-Drew screen presence. She is lively, funny, and virtuous. Her morality makes her an obvious misfit for what will take place. Leaving reform school, Arlette joins a French pickpocket class headed by a very animated Professor Aristide (Basil Rathbone of Sherlock Holmes fame) to have room and board. With natural acting ability, she becomes a star pupil despite her desire to be honest. Unhappy with the thought of stealing, she contemplates returning to reform school. A befriended pickpocket classmate convinces her that entering a ""white marriage"" of convenience would prevent her from that unpleasant destiny. All she needs is money to pay for the arrangement. With such a noble goal in mind, she sets out for the French public with her newly learned craft.

The temporary success of her first heist leads to a guilty conscious and indebted service to an ambassador at a fancy ball where she meets young French diplomat Pierre La Roche (Jean Pierre Aumont) under false pretenses. After confessing her sins and goals to him, she expects him to marry her. Arlette and Pierre are obviously attracted to each other. However, he decides to sponsor a deadbeat to fill the husbandly role so as not to sully his diplomatic reputation. As she plays along with his stubbornness, Pierre's feelings grow even stronger. She even belts out a love song in a swimsuit to allure Pierre's affection. Whoever gets Arlette in the end is truly the winner.

The funny HEARTBEAT story and invigorated acting compensate for the poor B+W image quality of the DVD and the unconvincing 18-year-old claim. There are no extras but for the low price (especially when purchased used), it's an entertaining way to spend 100 minutes multiple times.

756506,3,6303934668,"HEARTBEAT is a delightful film from RKO, which stars Ginger Rogers.  She plays an escaped reform-school girl called Arlette Lafon, who becomes a pupil in Professor Aristide's (Basil Rathbone) school for petty crime.  Arlette is a reluctant pupil but soon shows much promise in the art of pocket-picking.  One day whilst trying to steal the tie-pin of an ambassador (Adolphe Menjou), she is thrown into a scheme to unmask a debonair young politician called Pierre la Roche (Jean-Pierre Aumont).  Complications arise when Arlette and Pierre begin to fall in love, but what will happen when he discovers her criminal associations?

Ginger Rogers is the angel on top of the Christmas-tree in this delightful screwball comedy. True, perhaps the film might have been enhanced by having a European actress playing Arlette (Danielle Darrieux and Simone Simon come to mind), but Rogers is so lovely here it's hard to imagine the film being better without her.  Jean-Pierre Aumont is a capable partner; Menjou and Rathbone are wonderful as the metaphorical puppeteers manipulating Rogers.

Good cast and good performances, romantic, silly, fun story line, Ginger Rogers has done her best as always!",1507939200,,296,5.061224489795919
7858723,3,6303934668,"It wasn't what I was expecting, but it wasn't half bad. I was surprised that Ginger Rogers didn't dance other than what was in the typical ballroom scenes. Nothing spectacular, a predictable ending, cute characters, and an occasional laugh out loud moment.",1498089600,,256,5.119047619047619
7858724,4,6303934668,"Storybook theme of the era comes off nicely because of the omnipresence of Ginger Rogers and her many acting skills.  The plot, of course, demands a flexible attitude toward implausibility (Rogers escapes from a reform school and ends up in a school for thieves which looks very much like a standard public school classroom, etc.).  Good help from veteran actors like Adolphe Menjou and Basil Rathbone.",1489795200,,402,5.075757575757576
7858725,3,6303934668,"Amusing but too long.  It lacks a certain unity; the beginning seems like a screwball comedy, but it develops into a more straightforward romance.  Frankly, it would have better if it had kept the comedic elements.",1486252800,,214,4.916666666666667
7858726,3,6303934668,"Ginger Rogers has always been a favorite, most of the time with Fred.  There were several movies where she was the star and did not dance.  She does sing one song in this one, but this it not a musical.  But, if you remember the era when this film was made, and not compare it to movies of today, then it is a good movie to watch.  The cover of this movie show casing Ginger's legs is misleading as her legs are shown only briefly.
Only three stars as the quality of the film was not that good, has not been remastered.
Remember, it's an old movie.  Try to think of yourself in an small movie theater in 1946, i was five at that time, and when i started going to the Saturday movies.  When movies like this seemed so real.  For twenty five cents, I could go the the movie theater and fifteen cents to get in and ten cents for candy.  There would be two full movies, several cartoons, a weekly serial.  You did not have to leave the theater after one film, you could stall all day. When I was eight, I remember staying into the evening and watching the movies a second time.",1485561600,5,1073,4.144927536231884
7858727,5,6303934668,This was a very entertaining movie. Ginger Rogers was a beautiful woman and very talented. The manner in which her character transformed during the movie was quite a sight to see. I recommend this movie from Prime and think you will enjoy it too.,1481241600,,246,4.613636363636363
