8182391,5,B000NY1EA8,These films vary in quality but it's the content not the quality that matters with this one. Clark Gable takes us on a bombing raid over the Aleutian's from take-off to landing and it's in colour as well. All the films are worth seeing and their propaganda content reflects a by-gone world. Well worth the money if you have an interest in WW11.,1363046400,,344,4.476190476190476
8182392,3,B000NY1EA8,"I can recommend this set only as a starter for someone who has just become interested in WWII. The selection of content is good. Unfortunately, the good content is poorly served by the below average technical quality of the video.

I understand well that sources for this set are films that are about 2/3 of a century old. However, what is presented is likely not the from the best sources. A lot of the videos look like they came from well-worn, high generation 16 mm prints. It appears that little to no effort was made to restore the film via video processing (scratch removal, film weave reduction, brightness and contrast adjustment). To add insult to injury, some of videos have been overly compressed in order to save room on the disc for more content. One particularly bad example of this is ""Attack! The Battle for New Britain."" In the video transfer of this film, one can often see the darker backgrounds of the images locked in place while the brighter parts of the image wander randomly over the background due to film weave. The effect is both tiring to the eyes and mildly nauseating. The source for ""This Is the Army"" also looks to be a high generation 16 mm print, but with the additional problem of color fading towards red. It reminds me of some of my oldest VHS tape recordings (25 years old) of movies off of the local TV stations. The tapes play back what they recorded back then -- beat up 16 mm prints run on the TV station's own film equipment.

The main saving grace is that this multiple disc set is priced well below the cost of most single discs.

If you want to see a well done transfer of WWII film, I would suggest ""Victory at Sea"" from A&E.",1224288000,8,1672,4.457516339869281
