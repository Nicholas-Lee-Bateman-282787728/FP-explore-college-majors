There are celebrities (and today that means absolutely nothing as regards any achievements), stars (dignitaries who have had a reasonable or greater deal of success) plus icons (those who need no introduction because their name alone conjures up a long list of images, memories and/or stories). In 2016 there are far too many celebrities, a number of stars and even less icons. However, in the latter category one name shoots to the top of the charts because Mick Jagger has sat in this category across six decades!!! The Rolling Stones tours go on and Jagger is still newsworthy and an extremely sellable commodity.

It has been widely agreed that between 1963 and 1972 a youthful Jagger was in his prime as a performer and also as a composer with his band colleague Keith Richards. Mick made his way to the top of the tree and set the stone rolling for what has been a long and lustrous career. The notion that rock n roll is a young man's game is still championed by the media but Mick has gone on to disprove that theory with his energetic stage stamina stretching in to his seventies.

However, as the Rolling Stones CV is analysed the initial surge certainly threw up calibre and controversy and Mick was central to taking the pop idol on to the front pages of the press (something that is now taken for granted). Meanwhile, the debauchery may have been newsworthy but the majority of the music that was appearing at the same time was without doubt both breath-taking and brilliant.

Jagger and his ambivalent relationship with his song-writing partner Richards has been well documented but the sixties certainly led to the dynamic duo producing a series of singles and albums that ensures their respect for infinity. The Roaring 20's: Mick Jagger: Glory Years is a 106 minute DVD where acclaimed journalists, band insiders and peers assess the magnitude of a foremost frontman. A thoroughly riveting account unfolds and with archive footage plus pertinent research cemented together-a relevant document for fans is documented. Take the Mick! You are advised to heed this command!",1472947200,,2116,4.863888888888889

Some of the commentators seem to be searching for critical things to say. At least two of these people single out Wild Horses as a low point in Jagger's vocal style. Are you kidding? The song is perhaps the most widely covered Stones song and still no one has come close to the nuance Jagger brings to it. It is certainly one of the many HIGH points of Jagger's styling. They also remark on Jagger's lack of input on Exiles on Main Street. All I can do is shrug. Maybe they have it confused with some other record. One guy actually says Happy is the only song on it he likes. Really? Tumbling Dice doesn't do it for you? Ventilator Blues? Sweet Virginia? It's a two-album set often cited as the Stone's pinnacle. I suppose there are two ways of not liking the Stone: not liking them at all or preferring Keith Richards. I wouldn't say Exiles is the last great Stones album. That honor goes to Tattoo You. But Exiles is a giant achievement in their cannon and a versatile example of Jagger's vocalizing.

The other thing that got to me was their speculating that without the Stone Jagger could not have achieved success. While it's true that none of Jagger's solo efforts have been successful or deserved to be successful, it does not therefore follow that he could not make a successful solo CD. Jagger is too close to these solo works and he may not have as clear an understanding of what his fans love about him. I don't think he's taken his solo career as seriously as Keith, for example, has taken his own... But with little greater success. All that said, Jagger is probably the second most widely imitated pop vocalist after Bob Dylan. He can certainly have a successful solo career if he thinks such a thing is worth going after.

One element of Jagger the world has seldom seen is the accounting genius that Keith and other people who know him remark on in their writing. There's an interview clip here that clearly shows Jagger's acute understanding of figures and how they break down to finance a performance. There is a lot in this video to like if you don't take the commentators seriously. Perhaps they don't want to seem like they're praising him to the sky. No matter how you twist it, Mick Jagger invented modern rock & roll.",1453161600,3,2419,4.533180778032037
