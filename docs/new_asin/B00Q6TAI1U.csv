6859146,5,B00Q6TAI1U,thought it was a great time! story was decent and original which is hard to do in a zombie film. Felissa Rose really shines as the religious freak trying to convert the terrified people trapped inside the gates. really spectacular!,1423699200,,231,4.8
6859147,2,B00Q6TAI1U,"The big bright spot in this film is Billy Zane.  He did a great role and that is why I didn't give this a one star.  Dee Wallace and Mischa Barton also put in a decent performance.  The director and writers put in all the standard characters - a kill crazy right hand man, a good intentioned doctor who is nuts, a pregnant woman, a religious zealot whose parishioners are cult members, etc. etc.  Incidentally why is everybody who believes in God always some kind of nut case in these movies?  Oh -- and now it is fracking that caused the zombies.  It released the microorganisms that killed the dinosaurs and then started this disease.  You also have zombie hordes which are now becoming pretty standard.  The story spreads itself too thin and then flounders at the end.  Billy Zane plays a sergeant who trains the young men to kill the zombies and their group is called ""Zombie Killers"".  The elephant graveyard part has something to do with them returning to the fracking spot for some reason.",1423612800,,996,4.576271186440678

In the hobbled together town of Elwood lives a small community of survivors doing the best they can. Their de facto leader, ultimately known as Doc thanks to his profession, does his best to lead, but not everyone sees eye-to-eye. The weak, infected or otherwise threatening tenants of Elwood are faced with eviction  taken to the fence protecting the town and either thrown to the outside, or choosing to be shot point blank to save themselves the agony.

When militia member Kennedy goes AWOL and a supply mission goes wrong, the explanation of what caused the infection is proposed that perhaps it didn't start with the assumed biological contagion, but an environmental consequence of the human race.

What is the most intriguing about this film is the use of fracking, a very current and real problem, with the idea of a zombie infestation. An as of yet untapped concept, Zombie Killers: Elephants Graveyard follows in the rich tradition of our most successful reanimated corpse movies in that it uses the vehicle to make a commentary on not only environmental but social issues we are faced at this moment. The passive attitude of the citizens of Elwood is Smiths take of the mediocrity that is seeping into our own society. Not that this movie is lofty. Part of the fun of Zombie Killers is that it is aware of itself. A perfect peppering of an odd laugh here and there breaks the tension as well, bringing you back down from your horror high to get ready for another build.

Most promising about the film is that the cast is as strong of an ensemble as you can get. Not a weak link in the bunch, the people that make up the town of Elwood are both fully realized and unique from one another, something that often cant be said about horror movies. Add in the weight of such acting heavyweights as Billy Zane and Dee Wallace, and it is hard not to enjoy it.

Standouts include Brian Gallagher as Rory, the rebel resident of Elwood set on protecting his family, and the strong core group that makes up the Zombie Killers crew (Michael Kean, Joe Raffa, Angel Anthony Marrero and Kyle Patrick Brennan.) The scariest of all the movie elements is not the oncoming zombie storm, but actually Felissa Rose as the religious zealot Lia.

No low-budget horror movie comes without its problems. Zombie Killers: Elephants Graveyard has its major stumble in effects. The CGI, although it is used sparingly, is so rudimentary that what could be a successful cineplex release becomes a SyFy original movie. As much as I appreciate the movie wanting to incorporate the idea that animals would also be infected, they would have benefited the movie by conveying that with practical props. Herds of CGI deer, fish and packs of wolves that all seem to go on forever yank you from the otherwise strong movie into a world where a wolf is clearly a 2-dimensional gray blob. A zombie deer carcass here or zombie fish there would have sufficed.

Digital effects aside, I am looking forward to what Zombie Killers: Elephants Graveyard has to offer in the future and what the world responds to. With so many zombie movies and shows getting cranked out with not much thought to storytelling and performance, Zombie Killers is a solid addition to the horror fare available. It seems that this movie has a lot of bigger plans ahead of it as well, a positive that invites not only a more sweeping story than most living dead films get but also room for improvement. A must-see for hardcore horror enthusiasts and zombie fanatics alike.",1423094400,,3554,4.739482200647249
6859150,2,B00Q6TAI1U,"This movie takes place six years after the zombie apocalypse has forever changed human life, and the residents of a community must now face a mass exodus of the undead heading in their direction. I probably would have dismissed this movie and never got around to watching it if it wasn't for some of the cast members. So I gave it a shot, and yeah, its not a good movie, but it wasn't a total waste. I like the idea of an unstoppable wall of the undead heading toward a safe zone, but thats really the only idea it had. The rest is just derivative of The Walking Dead. Some good actors involved, the rest vary from bad to decent. The pace wasn't too bad. I don't know, there just isn't much going for this movie. Its watchable I guess, but its easy to find better.",1423008000,2,764,4.239726027397261
6859151,4,B00Q6TAI1U,"** I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I wasn't sure what to expect with ZOMBIE KILLERS: ELEPHANTS GRAVEYARD because the title is a bit, um, different than what you would expect from a zombie flick.  To be honest, I was downright confused.  What do elephants or even an elephants graveyard have to do with the walking dead?  I hoped the film would explain, and thankfully, it does.  As it turns out, the title is a nifty description for an aspect of the zombie apocalypse in this film.  And while ZOMBIE KILLERS: ELEPHANTS GRAVEYARD is not an excellent entry into the genre, it is still a fun film that fans of the living dead will want to check out.

Ok, now its confession time:  I like Billy Zane as an actor.  Ive liked him for a long time, stretching as far back as 1995, when I first saw him in TALES FROM THE CRYPT: DEMON KNIGHT.  So when I heard he was in this film, I knew I had to give it a look.  Im happy to report he gives a good performance in this film.

ZOMBIE KILLERS: ELEPHANTS GRAVEYARD is shot well and looks decent onscreen.  The production value appears somewhat low, but that is understandable, given the low-budget nature of the film.  My sole complaint about the production is that everything in the film looks too clean; I would assume in a zombie apocalypse that clean clothing and nice houses with well-kept yards would be things of the past.  Not so here.

The acting is pretty good overall, although it does come with the expected mishmash of talent which is common for indie films.  Dee Wallace is always excellent onscreen, and Mischa Barton does a great job with her rolebut a few of the younger zombie killers are lifeless with their line deliveries, making them almost nonexistent to me in the film.  This doesnt actually detract too much from the film, however, as it can be easily overlooked.

The special effects in ZOMBIE KILLERS: ELEPHANTS GRAVEYARD are also a mixed bag.  The zombie effects are nice and theres even some great gore.  However the CG in the film almost looks laughable at times.  Of particular note is when the infected fish are jumping out of the water at one of the zombie killers.  This looked so cheesy, I think I would have preferred rubber fish being thrown at the actress instead.

The storyline is good, however it is not fully fleshed out.  I like the concept behind the zombie outbreak, and I see where the director is trying to gobut the plot never fully reaches its potential.  As a result, there are some confusing loose ends left.  I would wager, just by the ending, that a sequel is in the works (I hope soI would like to see where this goes), but I cannot confirm that.

Still, despite its shortcomings, ZOMBIE KILLERS: ELEPHANTS GRAVEYARD is a zombie flick with bite and a lot of heart.  You can tell this film is made by a true zombie fan who is striving to get things right.  And while its not perfect, its definitely a step in the right direction.  I recommend ZOMBIE KILLERS: ELEPHANTS GRAVEYARD to anyone looking for a decent indie zombie flick.  It is available today in a variety of formats.",1422921600,4,3107,4.492857142857143
6859152,3,B00Q6TAI1U,"A zombie movie and Billy Zane... that's probably all that need be said to figure out that this is an Indie production with the potential for entertainment, but no major draw. I like Billy Zane from his early days - The Phantom was a campy romp - but his more recent career work has not impressed, even though I'm hoping he finds his way to a comeback. I've also watched what seems like a zillion zombie movies. I appreciate the genre, the question of how people face the apocalypse, how far human survival will drive us in the face of hopelessness, the depiction of zombie gore, etc.

Back to this movie... I've seen far worse for the zombie offerings. The cinematography was decent and the make-up/effects were also acceptable. There was a twist on what caused the Zombie epidemic which was interesting, but underplayed. However, that didn't really save the film from weak writing and mixed acting talent. Perhaps, that is to be expected though for this Indie level of production, and there were a few bright moments. A good portion of the actors had talent, but the cheese factor of the lines/story took its toll. I thought Billy was ok in his usual carefree style, and the mother dying of cancer (Dee Wallace), several of the young Zombie Killer teens (Michael Kean), Nikki (Gabrielle Stone), Kennedy (Ashley Sumner) and surprisingly, the old guy Rory (Brian Gallagher) were all fairly entertaining to watch. Mischa Barton as Toni was a bit disappointing because her character just wasn't given much to work with... her acting was fine, just stuck in a one-dimensional role.

Overall, the film was probably limited by the rural setting - the town of Elwood. That small town locale allowed for characters that could have risen to a Stephen King level of appeal - religious fanatics, pet psychopaths, etc.- but the attempts at these personalities didn't quite succeed. I think they pulled the others down... not horribly, but enough to have the film's authenticity drop a notch. The ending was more constructed than some zombie flicks I've watched, although certainly was not very grand in its vision. That seemed fitting with the restrained Elwood depiction. The writers left room for a sequel, but I wouldn't bet on that happening.

On my Indie zombie scale (not Hollywood!!) - this one manages 3 out of 5 stars. For comparison, I gave an underappreciated country zombie flick using the Civil War era - Exit Humanity: A Zombie Saga - 4 out of 5 stars. So, while Zombie Killers: Elephant's Graveyard is okay for those of you who like low budget zombie movies, you're still going to have to go into it with reduced expectations. If you have the option, I'd wait for the Amazon rental vs. owning this film.",1422489600,8,2706,4.790149892933619

The movie did have a neat concept in having the entire movie be about a town surrounded by a fence to keep zombies out, while the townsfolks went on living. There was enough zombie violence that it will keep the zombie action interesting.

6859157,1,B00Q6TAI1U,"Movie fans need to face facts. After so many movies come out with the same tired theme used over and over again those genres of film begin to show signs of being worse for the wear. One or two movies become a hit and suddenly everyone and his brother is making movies based on the same concept be it sparkly vampires or misunderstood werewolves. The most current victim of this trend is the zombie movie. While George Romero had no one else making zombie films in the late 60s the same cant be said of todays films. The success of THE WALKING DEAD (which actually deals more with the interaction of people as opposed to zombies) zombies are now everywhere.

Into the mix comes this film with perhaps the most stupendous and ridiculous theory behind the living dead Ive ever heard. Seriously, when they were explaining it I had to pause the DVD until I stopped laughing. The movie takes place in a small town where folks have gathered together to attempt and live during the zombie apocalypse. Surrounding their town with a fence they also make sure that anyone who is infected or even seems to be infected is tossed out. The town is run by a doctor who tries to do all he can for the people and policed by a group of zombie killers (hey good name for a movie!) that handle the job of killing the zombies and traveling outside of the fence when they need supplies.

But being cooped up inside of the fence is nearly as damaging as being outside. One group of zealots is led by the overly religious Lia (SLEEP AWAY CAMPs Felissa Rose) who blames the whole thing on sinful ways. She leads the group in condemning a young woman who is now pregnant by a man who had to kill his wife when she changed. The zombie killers have problems of their own, most being young, arrogant and reckless. The result is some getting killed and others fighting among themselves.

Then there is the man who thinks he knows how all of this began. On a trip outside of the compound in search of supplies he has them head to the local mining sight. There they discover paperwork that explains how the reason people began to turn into zombies was what was in their water from the fracking that was going on there. Yes, the zombie apocalypse was caused by fracking folks.

On top of everything else a horde of zombies is fast approaching the compound and people are arguing about what to do. Love is in the air for a couple who live in this compound, one of them being a zombie killer. Andoh well come on do you really need more than fracking induced zombies and love struck late teens trying to make a life for themselves in this troubled world? Yeah I kind of do and hope you do as well.

While the movie is competently shot it leaves a ton to be desired in the way of a script and acting. Some notable actors who appear in this film like Billy Zane and Dee Wallace handle their parts well but the rest feel like first timers making their on screen debut. Its not high school play level but you can tell this is their first or nearly first film.

I love horror movies and have completely enjoyed many of the zombie flicks that have come up over the past few years, including all of Romeros films as well as THE WALKING DEAD. But movies like these are what give the genre a bad name. It feels like a movie found on SyFy and my guess is was made for that channel. If you watch that network at all youll know exactly what Im talking about.

Needless to say I cant recommend this movie to anyone, not even fans of the genre. For me it felt like just another quick flick made to cash in on a successful genre that may soon fade away as the next one takes its place.",1428537600,3,3633,4.302631578947368

6859159,1,B00Q6TAI1U,"I picked this up at a local store...should have left it there. While there are some good actors in this thing, for the most part it is substandard. The dialogue isn't interesting, smart or entertaining, except for a comment here and there. Characters are flat and I couldn't find even one to empathize with, not even the kids (and I love kids). Basically, a group of survivors are holed up in a compound which is dominated by an ex-Army doctor and a religious fanatic. The doctor spends his time testing the survivors for whatever it is...he doesn't know what it is but he seems to find it. His thugs make the infected leave the compound with the promise that they can go, but then gun them down once outside the gate. They tell people that they left (apparently, the people are tone deaf to gunfire). One guy thinks he knows the source of the plague and leads a group off to check out his theory. It was the fracking well. There is no explanation as to how the contamination  spread around the world so quickly. etc. Anyway, the zombie make-up wasn't so great. The choreography was bad. Billy Zane's heroic death was a farce. Their compound is eventually overrun. A handful of survivors join up with another group at the end who have found the central pit (which isn't near the fracking well from what I could tell). They are on a mission to go down into the pit to take on whatever it is (if ""it"" is the black goop that takes over people, I'm not sure what the guns are for). That is pretty much where the movie ends. I can only hope that when they jump into the pit they take Zombie Killers 2 with them.",1426896000,,1606,4.37123745819398

8690579,3,B00Q6TAI1U,"One of the first things you notice about Zombie Killers as it opens is, ""It looks like a real movie."" Though in most cases this would be a ""Duh..."" question, in the world of zombie movies it's a real question. Zombie movies are often made by first-time directors with people who can't act and cinematographers who've never shot a film and who are using cheap consumer equipment. The budgets for these attempts are often under one or two thousand dollars.hopes up.  So to see a clear wide-screen picture and reasonable opening credits is an amazing thing in itself.  You then see a fairly sizable cast instead of the usual low-budget pair of survivors and you really begin to get your hopes up. The fact that it's shot in the country (Pennsylvania's Pocanos area) is acceptable since urban zombie films are for multi-million dollar budgets or else are shot in one building with exterior shots looking curiously deserted. So this much is established: they had some kind of a budget and some competent people to make it.

Writer-director Harrison Smith even got actors you've actually heard of like Billy Zane, Mischa Barton and Dee Wallace and the rest of the cast is acceptable for the most part. ""Doc"" (Brian Anthony Wilson"" heads a small town of survivors who have managed to survive a zombie apocalypse by fencing the town in. It's protected by a young group of ""Zombie Killers"" led by ex-military guy Seiler (Billy Zane). A rougher group of guys led by Dero (Dan McGlaghlin) act as Doc's police force within the town and of course there is friction between the two groups. There is also a love triangle, a crazy lady leading a religious cult, a mother dying of cancer and an attempt to make the film seem environmentally relevant.

Zombie Killers gets totally trashed online, as if it's a total piece of garbage, and it's not all that bad. The film has many things wrong with it, i admit, but at least they tried. That means something to me and if the film hadn't messed itself up in so many ways I would have given it four stars. I don't know what it is about zombie fans, but they are the most savage and exacting critics in a genre that only rarely produces anything that's even slightly good. This film is totally watchable as long as you don't expect too much, and who would expect much of a zombie movie?

Still, there are problems galore. Many of them are in the script foundations - not the dialogue, but the story assumptions. It's been long-established that you don't have to try to explain how the zombies happened, but this film does and it totally undermines its credibility. This is supposed to be the usual worldwide Z.A. and the survivors in ""Elwood"" don't know if there is anyone left on Earth. Yet the cause is a man-made localized type of phenomenon that couldn't have created many zombies and even then, only in a small area. The zombies are few and far between until the very end and are easily dealt with and so in the background they almost don't exist. This means that most of the film focuses on conflicts and soap-opera between the characters and no one here is up to any level of acting or writing to sustain interest.

MILD SPOILERS HERE: The film rambles on and on until a fairly big climax that is really too little too late. The special effects are atrocious, especially when the film enters Resident Evil territory by including flesh-eating zombie animals. See for yourself. And then there's the big zombie scene. Though the film lists 200-300 zombie extras, you only see a dozen or so until the horde descends, but then you find he used them as a group to process through special effects to look like endless thousands (Think some of the forces of Mordor in LOTR). For a second it looks pretty impressive but is so distant that it comes off as detached and looking animated.

Still, it's watchable by most standards as long as you ignore its absurd ""Elephant's Graveyard"" thesis and don't mind the personal-drama focused plot.",1478908800,,3962,4.651428571428571
