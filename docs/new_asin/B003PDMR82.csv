4164514,2,B003PDMR82,"This is an absolutely terrible movie, but well worth having in the collection if only to see Jack Nicholson slim and with hair and young. Made in 5 days, yes only 5 days, on the sets used for The Raven, this is one of the best bad films ever made, and as such is hugely enjoyable. Consider it as part of Corman's Edgar Allen Poe series and you will know what you are getting. It's quite short too.....",1275955200,3,401,4.153846153846154

4164516,1,B003PDMR82,Could not make it through this film. This is not one that Karloff could have been proud of; filled with bad acting and a poor script with very little of Mr. Karloff.,1442448000,,165,4.1875
4164517,5,B003PDMR82,"Older horror movie set in the 1800's with Boris Karloff and a very young, handsome, and talented Jack Nicholson. Watch it for the actors, if nothing else. I didn't take my eyes from the screen till movie's end. Suspense, backed up with great acting and frightful events make for a great horror flick. Don't pass this one by.",1439769600,3,324,4.603448275862069

4164522,5,B003PDMR82,"Beautifully restored versions of two classics 'The Terror' starring Jack Nicholson, and 'The Veil', starring Boris Karloff. Superb sound and video quality.

'The Terror' is a bit of a difficult plot to follow, but sooooo nice to look at a young, svelte Jack Nicholson that you are more captivated by his looks than by the film's story line. No offense, Jack - you're acting is still the best.

'The Terror', set in 1806, tells the story of a lost French soldier named Andre Duvalier (Jack Nicholson) saved by a strange young woman named Helene (Sandra Knight). She looks like Ilsa, the baron's (Boris Karloff) wife, who died 20 years before.

During the climactic scenes, Andre (Jack Nicholson), as well as the Baron's butler Stefan (Dick Miller), eventually force the witch Katrina into compliance. Here it is revealed that the witch Katrina is in fact the mother of Eric, who was allegedly killed by the Baron twenty years before, and that is why she has tried to make him commit suicide, and damn his soul to hell in the process. In a stunning revelation, Stefan reveals that Eric never died, that it was the Baron who was killed. Eric then took the Baron's place, living his life until he deluded himself into thinking he was the Baron.

In the climax of the film, Ilsa's ghost attempts to kill Eric while the crypt floods, and Stefan joins the struggle. However, by the time Andre gains access to the crypt, it is already flooding and crumbling, and he is only able to carry Helene's body away. The two share a touching moment together outside, only to have Helene begin to rapidly decompose and melt. Katrina's familiar hawk flies away as Helene dissolves into a melting corpse after Nicholson kisses her. I should think any woman would turn into a princess if they were kissed by Nicholson, but not in this story. It's an interesting watch if you are a true Nicholson fan, and enjoy his very early movie roles.

'The Veil' is an American horror/suspense anthology television series produced in 1958.

The series was hosted by Boris Karloff, who also acted in every episode but one, and was allegedly based upon real-life reports of supernatural happenings and the unexplained. Ten of the twelve episodes began and ended with Karloff standing in front of a roaring fireplace and inviting viewers to find out what lies ""behind the veil.""

The episode which is presented here is titled, 'The Crystal Ball', and is a beautifully restored black and white version. In this episode a young man's girlfriend tells him she is engaged to another man. As a parting gift, the girlfriend gives her ex-boyfriend a crystal ball. And, well, you'll have to watch the program to see what happens next and how the show ends. Suffice it to say, that insanity reigns supreme in both of these programs, 'The Terror', (remember Nicholson in 'The Shining', and the poor ex-boyfriend in 'The Crystal Ball', pretty much loses his marbles (no pun intended).

Two classics you really must see to appreciate. Good programs to watch on a cold, October night just around Halloween. Happy ghost hunting......",1380585600,,3083,4.825757575757576

I can't remember the other movie, not sure I watched it. Would recommend The Terror if you like oldies and Jack Nicholson. Boris Karloff is always great.",1372982400,,276,4.226415094339623

8401973,4,B003PDMR82,"I own a copy that I bought elsewhere, and I've seen it online.

Apparently Corman had a script that was mostly dialogue, without a lot else, and filmed it. There are a number of plot holes, and one scene in which Stefan's failure to ask an obvious question makes the conclusion inevitable. You'll know the scene when you see it.

This movie was made LONG before we decided that irony, detachment, and snark were acceptable qualities for movie-making and storytelling. Whether that helps or hinders is a matter of opinion. My opinion is that it helps.

As usual, Karloff does the best job he can with the material, BECOMING the guilt-wracked old man who deserves our sympathy, and Nicholson makes the role of the young, disoriented, possibly combat-weary, officer someone you want to help in his search for answers (even though you could argue that most of this is none of his business).",1479600000,,886,4.777777777777778
