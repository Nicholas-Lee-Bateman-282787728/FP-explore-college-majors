2545920,5,B000EXDS48,daughter just loved the first like mike that she was beyond excited to receive the continuation of the story on a different level and loved just as much.  thank you.,1365811200,,165,4.5
2545921,5,B000EXDS48,seen this movie before and had to add it to my movie collection the kids will enjoy it as well,1363564800,,94,3.75
2545922,2,B000EXDS48,If you must see this wait until it is a freebie. The first Like Mike was an enjoyable movie. My 11 year old nephew rents movies when visiting and he lost interest in the movie halfway through it.,1361836800,,195,4.157894736842105
2545923,4,B000EXDS48,"I was very interested in purchasing part 2 because I had part 1 already. I thought maybe it would be a continuation from the first one with Bow Wow, but this one was totally different. Overall it's a good movie for kids.",1361750400,,220,4.261904761904762
2545924,5,B000EXDS48,Wonderful product!! Worked great!! Bought it and was able to watch it instantly. No glitches in the whole process. I would do it again.,1336262400,,135,4.666666666666667
2545925,3,B000EXDS48,"While I enjoyed the original Like Mike, I figured Like Mike 2 would be just as good, but surprisingly was let down. Although it is still cute, with many similarities to the original, it clearly wasn't as good. If you're thinking of buying this movie because the original Like Mike was so good, save your money, because you'll be disappointed.",1284681600,2,342,4.716666666666667
2545926,1,B000EXDS48,"This is nothing like the first Like Mike.  It's like a TV copy.  Lame.
Lil Bow-wow made the first one much better.",1214179200,4,114,4.136363636363637
2545927,3,B000EXDS48,"My boys, ages 4 and 6, really enjoyed the movie.  They're really into basketball right now and liked all of the ""moves"" the main character was able to achieve wearing his ""special shoes"".",1209427200,,187,4.666666666666667

I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed this one.  I like how it didn't try to copy line by line the original, or repeat the scenarios or scenes.  It was a nice twist to add the ""street ball"" nitch too.  The young actors were enjoyable to wach, and the acting was not bad.

All in all, very nice film.

1 star lower than 4, since it went straight to DVD.  Poor marketing for this one.

Recommded.

2545948,1,B000EXDS48,"I assumed the ""sequel"" to Like Mike would pick up where the original movie left off. Wrong !! It is a completely low-budget, poorly acted, badly scripted, rip off of the wonderfully moving original movie. The only reason a gave it one star is because zero stars is not an option",1373068800,2,278,4.470588235294118
