I have another advanced DVD by Amy Bento and it took 3 or 4 viewings before I got the moves down (extremely frustrating).  I love how Gay Gasper breaks it down- and she keeps the count the same so that if you've seen the video a billion times you can go ahead and skip the breakdown and do the advanced version of the combo.  She's also great a queueing (sp?).  She keeps the mindless chatter to a minimum (which is fine for one viewing, but if you do the video 3-4 times a week can kill it).

The ab section is just okay.  I also don't like her dancey cool-down without the step.  When I'm done with step I just want a few step touches and be done with it.

GREAT step DVD though- it goes by very quickly.",1203033600,,832,3.993939393939394
8155367,3,B000KB48ES,"I had a little trouble keeping up with this DVD.  It moves VERY fast and you need a lot of room around your step.  If you are very advanced and have a large room, you will probably like this work out.  If not, you may want to make another choice.",1171584000,7,246,3.88
