8292727,5,B001DD0DBY,"Acute Observer's review is astute but misses the point. As French film director, Jean-Luc Godard famously wrote: ""Art is not the representation of reality but the reality of a representation."" In the movie Dial M for Murder when the detective asks the husband who hires the would-be murderer of his wife, why he placed the call to his boss that set the murder in motion, he replies that his boss was going on a  trip and that he wanted to tell him something. Wouldn't an astute detective corroborate that with this boss? Apparently not as far as fiction that goes just far enough to pique the sensibilities of the viewer. What person in a master painting really looks like oil paint? We need to suspend some logic to probe the mechanics of the psyche and romantic love. I don't think Vertigo was voted the greatest film of all time by Sight and Sound critics because its members ignored incongruities. I think antipathies of critics who dwell on them may be likened to those who refuse to accept operatic masterpieces because no one in real life sings his/her travails; i.e., Mimi the consumptives in Puccini's La Boehme  who can sing for long periods of time before she dies, or for that matter can sing at all. Vertigo is certainly an interesting examination of romantic love and its subversive hijacking of logic and reason. The book's ending is revealed midway through the movie so that Hitchcock could better probe romantic longing.  Vertigo is surely a difficult, trying, but great cinematic exploration of those dynamics.",1484179200,,1528,4.824427480916031

The film begins with a womans face - her eyes look bloodshot. Then the credits roll. There is a chase on the rooftops. One man slips and falls to his death. The other survives with a foot injury. [Does he look out his Rear Window?] Acrophobic? Can a cantilevered brassiere be revolutionary? John Ferguson is available, like other Frisco bachelors. Is his problem curable? [Is there subtle humor here?] San Francisco is changing since the war. [Shipping was moving across the bay.] John is hired to follow another mans wife; there is fear from the dead. Reluctantly, Scotty accepts for an old friend. Scottys Dodge follows the Jaguar. [The cars date the picture.] Isnt he following too closely?

The Mission Dolores is an old historical church. Carlotta Valdes 1831-1857. Next the Museum. Whose picture is on the wall? Then the McKittrick Hotel. It does seem silly. Did she drop her tail? Scotty will consult a local expert at a book shop, and learns Frisco history. Poor thing. Madeleine has jewelry owned by Carlotta Valdes, her great-grandmother. [Would a suicide be buried in a church cemetery?] Next to the Presidio, beneath the Golden Gate Bridge. Will Madeleine jump into the cold water? What next? Will Goldilocks sleep in Papa Bears bed? What happened? [Note the coffee percolator.] Madeleine leaves, Scotty follows. [Does this film move slowly?] They go for a ride in the country and look at an old redwood tree. There is talk about not knowing the recent past. How do you know? Doe the conversations make sense?

Scottys old girlfriend Midge is skilled at painting. But Johnny is not impressed. [What does that tell you?] Next they travel to a historic mission church. Theres an answer for everything. [But is it the correct answer?] They climb the stairs to the bell tower. Something falls past the window. There is a coroners inquest: suicide from an unsound mind. [But now I got a hint to the ending.] You and I both know who killed Madeleine. Scotty has dreams or nightmares. Does Mozarts music have healing qualities? Is Johnny sedated? After his release he revisits their former places. Does he recognize a woman on the street? Johnny follows her to a hotel. Judy Barton tells her story. Shes not in Kansas anymore and has a drivers license to prove it. There is a flashback to what happened at that bell tower? Judy writes a letter and tells the truth. But she decides to stay and dine with Scotty. They visit the Exposition during the day. Scotty is controlling, he wants Judy to dress like Madeleine. Why is he doing this? [Does he have a clue?] Then he notices Judy is wearing that same necklace? Will Scotty break free of the past? What will Judy say or do? [Is there a pattern of deaths in the presence of Scotty?]

This story runs on too long, its story is too sleight and implausible. Why would Judy from Kansas agree to a murder plot with a stranger? In the early 20th century French criminologists used the method of recreating the crime to test eyewitness testimony. Could a man and a woman hide on top of that bell tower without being seen by the police and others? This explanation of the murder is false.

The Foreign Censorship Ending is much better than the short ending since it wraps up the loose ends. Any investigation into Madeleines recent past would have revealed the plot. The spouse or boyfriend is always the prime suspect in an unusual death; a person who profits from the death doubly so. Once youve seen this you will understand the rationale for the 1984 film Body Double, a better film which echoes the ideas from this film. Contrast this plodding film to North by Northwest.",1413936000,,3642,4.720125786163522
