2526070,5,B000EOTU0I,"I first watched the first three episodes online on youtube. I thought it was extremly funny, and set out to buy it. When I got it and watched it, I was amazed at how fun this anime was. It is a rank of 2 in my top ten anime list and should probably be in your anime collection if you like Yaoi(boy/boy love)!

I also made my brother watch it, whom is NOT a Yaoi fan, and he liked it aswell. So if you are looking for a good laugh, and a series that is entertaining, Sukisho should be your pic!",1168214400,11,493,3.881188118811881
2526071,5,B000EOTU0I,I have watched many diffrent animes and this is one of my favorites! It has a great plot line and has both drama and humor. It is a fun anime to watch. I loved it and so did all my friends.,1155859200,5,189,3.6341463414634148

thank you.",1153872000,3,128,3.5357142857142856
2526073,5,B000EOTU0I,"I bought Sukisho recently cause it looked interesting and completely fell in love. This Anime has an excellent blend of over the top humor and serious drama, and unlike some of the Anime I purcshed recently *CoughLovelessCough* a satisfying ending that I had yet to expereience with any anime series I've watched. All confusion and intrigue is resolved and the ending left room for growth in the future. Oh and the bonus episode while entirly goofy and way over the top was hilarous, and an excellent epilouge to the series. Be warned there is definate Boy/Boy love and while there's nothing to explicte(Everythings stay's above the waist when they're without clothes) there are a number of scenes that are clearly sexual in nature. The whole series has kind of a Gravitatio/Fruits basket feel to it There are a number of times Sora's energy and loyalty comes off a lot like Shuichi's even though there roles are reversed (Sora is clearly Seme)and Minato's cool attitude and over protectiveness of those close to him is very reminisant of Hatori of Fruits Basket. If you're into Shounen Ai and enjoy a high school Drama riddle with secret pasts,The occasional Cos play and betrayl then Sukisho just might be for you!!",1149379200,54,1217,4.884057971014493
8112404,4,B000EOTU0I,"This product came really quickly, though the cost for delivery was a wee bit exhorbitant.  I enjoyed watching it.  It's a very cute story at first, with misunderstandings all around, and then you get to see the seriousness of the back story and what happened to the boys before they were separated.  A very nice, all around complete story.",1347494400,,339,4.711864406779661
8112405,2,B000EOTU0I,"Don't get me wrong. I like anime. Some of it is very good, some of it is very funny. This had the potential to go either way but did neither. By the end of it I was just thankful it was over and didn't care. I'm not sure why everyone else likes it so much. Maybe I'm missing something that everyone else sees, but I hate that I wasted time and money on it when there were others I would have rather watched.",1290211200,,407,3.9156626506024095
8112406,4,B000EOTU0I,"This DVD had it all---romance, drama, slapstick moments that had me holding me stomach from the laughter, and a good dose of mystery.
Sunao and Sora were adorable, as was their relationship, and I found myself cheering them on despite the obstacles in their path (namely Sora's obliviousness and Sunao's many secrets), and celebrating when in the end love triumphed and saved the day.
I recommend it to all who like a good laugh with their anime (but who can also appreciate the appropriate dark moments as well).",1232409600,,513,4.840909090909091
8112407,5,B000EOTU0I,"I really loved this series. It's rather short compared to many other anime films i've viewed, but the depth of the storyline that is contained in only 3 disks is amazing. There is a lot of guy x guy, but not so much for it to be completely inappropriate for teens wanting a bit of yaoi. It's not 'fluff' , but it's not too hardcore. I love it!",1232236800,,343,4.0588235294117645
8112408,5,B000EOTU0I,"Sukisho is a short anime about two boys with split personalities.  To explain without spoilers... Sora wakes up one night to a boy being... let's just say aggressive... toward him, demanding to see someone named Yoru.  Didn't go so well.  When he wakes up in the morning, he finds a the same boy named Sunao, who has no idea what Sora is referring to when the confused boy confronts him about that night.  Turns out that Sora and Sunao were frineds, but an accident earlier that involved Sora falling from a building has erased his memories.  As the story progresses, you find that their past, and their relationships (theirs and their alternate egoes) are more complex and involved than they could ever have imagined.

It's a cute series with a lot of laughs and decent voice acting (japanese).  Plus, there's a plot that has a little bit of substance to it, and what's not to love about that.  I just wonder where all the women are in that world....  Mysteries...",1227225600,,965,4.629411764705883
8112409,4,B000EOTU0I,"Warning for fan girls/boys right now, this is super soft core yaoi.  There is a kiss every now and then, and thats about it.

If you weren't looking for intense boy love, this anime is super cute and good for a laugh.  (Or in my case a lot of laughs.)  It takes a while for the plot to really get going and become even the least bit understandable.  Keep with it and just enjoy all the little side plots and humor.

The only downside (besides lack of hard yaoi) was all the names starting with 'S'.  Poor me got a little confused.

Very cute, if you want a good laugh, go forth and buy it!",1223078400,4,589,4.060869565217391
8112410,5,B000EOTU0I,"I LOVE the premise, characters, artwork, voices, etc. It is so much fun to watch. Funny, with really engaging main characters, interesting episodes, intrigue, etc. Don't read too many reviews - the surprises are the best part! If you enjoy yaoi at all, THIS IS A MUST-SEE! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by a picky viewer! Definitely WORTH THE MONEY! There are a lot of episodes and even a fun OVA.",1208131200,,386,4.6911764705882355
8112411,4,B000EOTU0I,"The premise of Sukisho is a dramatic one.  Two boys, Sora and Sunao, are used as lab rats when they are children.  The terrible trauma causes both to develop multiple personality disorder, and eventually they're separated.  They meet again in high school but why so suddenly?  What's happened to them in between their time at the lab and their return to school, and can they gain control of their darker, other selves?  More importantly, can they ever escape the lab and its scientists for good?

For such a serious storyline, I was pleasantly surprised at how funny the first two thirds of the show was.  Sora is a wacky, high strung and very lovable loon while Sunao balances him out with his droll insults.  Adding in their best friend Matsuri who loves to play practical jokes; their underclassman Ichikawa who finds noodle-making very exciting; the school nurse Nanami who seems to have a fetish for S&M and costume play; and their alternate personalities who keep sticking poor Sora and Sunao into hilariously awkward situations made Sukisho's plot one string of bizarre misadventures.  The over-the-top character designs and great dialogue only added to the humor, and I found myself laughing out loud at least several times an episode (and it's difficult to make me laugh out loud).

In the last few episodes the plot abruptly turns serious, as the issues of Sora and Sunao's alternate personalities and their shared past as test subjects are finally resolved.  Personally I thought the sudden change was a bit jarring.  Also, the last episode felt a bit rushed; an extra episode might have helped to clear things up more effectively.

That being said, I know many fans who found the ending both touching and exciting.  Even if you're not one of them, Sukisho is worth buying for its incomparable humor and the adorable romance that blooms between Sora and Sunao.  Highly recommended.",1195516800,4,1892,4.924290220820189
8112412,5,B000EOTU0I,"The first I watched this series, I was blowned away by the direction it took at the end. Very surprising. Totally unexpected. The boys are cute and the adults have dark mysterious secrets, a great recipe for an unusual series. The boy love is hilarious and touching. I loved it!",1192838400,,278,4.58
8112413,5,B000EOTU0I,It's not heavy yaoi but still is AMAZING! You will squel in delight as you watch the story unfold. Plus there is a plot! What's not to love about a yaoi story with plot?!,1176163200,11,170,4.029411764705882
