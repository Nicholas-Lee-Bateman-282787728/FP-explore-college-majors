8344728,2,B001URA5Z2,The film has its moments but is plagued by way too many flashbacks and flash forwards. The main actor Sergio D'amato is corny as the hitman hero. The main problem is that this movie's story could easily be told in half an hour and it is stretched to a grueling 76 minutes. The shootouts lack impact but there is some great cinematography. The film is okay but shouldn't be feature length.,1513382400,,388,4.47887323943662
