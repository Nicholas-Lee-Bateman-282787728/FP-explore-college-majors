7209248,4,B00YAWJ4OW,"A document of a band transitioning into a heavier, raw, less hippie, more amplified blues direction, paving the way for future bands to follow across several genres. Here we see the Stones enter into the ""golden era"", along with their fellow 60s cohorts The WHO, taking their music into a heavier ""not quite metal"" direction. Its loud, out of tune sometimes, brash, unrefined and exactly what live rock and roll is all about. Lots of loud Gibson guitars here,with Mick becoming a full fledged iconic front man. ...like I said, warts and all.",1437696000,,541,4.827956989247312
7209249,2,B00YAWJ4OW,"I only bought this because I thought ""No Expectations, Mercy Mercy, Stray Cat Blues"" would be included. However, they were not and it's the  exact same show as ""Stones in the Park"".",1437696000,34,181,4.65625
7209250,1,B00YAWJ4OW,"This is just a train wreck. Same old 'footage' you've always seen on bootlegs, and no better quality either. They owe us on this one.",1437696000,8,133,4.36
7209251,3,B00YAWJ4OW,"Along with Altamont, this is the most historic concert the Stones ever played. Both shows were free of charge and both have gone down in notoriety for their unintended tragic circumstances. The initial idea for Hyde Park was to introduce newly acquired guitarist Mick Taylor to the world. Of course, with the strange turn of events it became a tribute to the man that Taylor replaced, Brian Jones. On camera, Taylor remains mostly stationary, but it's not to say he's unflappable. It's that he's dead nervous for there were high stakes for the band. Then again, who wouldn't be in joining the Stones?

Most of the numbers, that they would whip into perfect shape by their fall 1969 U.S. tour, are tentative and ragged here. They had a good enough PA sound system. But it's only Charlie Watts who comes close to being at his best on the show. Keith sounds truly fatigued. But it's just good to know that they were coming out of hibernation after more than two years and getting ready to transition themselves live.

Though relatively few, there are bright spots on this set. There's a new kind of relationship between the band and the audience. It's a pre-Woodstock audience and the screaming is left far in the past. The entire band comes together on the Johny Winter blues ""I'm Yours and She's Mine"" and on ""Love in Vain"". Taylor actually gets in some decent slide riffs on ""Midnight Rambler"" and the percussionists on ""Sympathy for the Devil"" are exciting to watch. Jagger's reading of Shelly's ""Adonais"" is thoughtfully read. And those white butterflies that are set free, symbolizing Brian's soul, is particularly inspiring.

A major offense is how ""No Expectations"" has been excluded. It would have made for the greatest bonus feature. I've seen this performance of it online several times and it comes off better than almost everything they did at the Park. The emotional tone of Taylor's slide guitar, Charlie's subtle groove and Jagger's voice gets to the song's resigned melancholia. It was a proper goodbye of what was really Brian's song.

It's great that the Stones continue opening the vaults, but this DVD is really for Stones fanatics only. From the bootleg of ""The Stones in the Park"" I've owned for many years, the picture quality of this DVD has definitely come from improved sources.",1437696000,16,2302,4.849872773536895
7209252,3,B00YAWJ4OW,"The Stones were great in the studio and during the Ya-Ya's recording back in this time period, but this DVD is a bit of a disappointment and for me, it's the weakest ""From the Vault"" entry yet. It's not horrible, it's just the out-of-tune guitars of Keith Richards and Mick Taylor and the camera's constant love affair with all things Mick Jagger really mar the proceedings. (I sure hope future From the Vault DVDs feature more shots of the other musicians; it's puzzling why post-1988 DVDs feature so many shots of the auxiliary musicians but so many pre-Steel Wheels-era concert films come so close to ignoring Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman.

With the new Hyde Park 1969 document, it's true that Brian Jones (RIP) died two days before this concert, which definitely contributes to the somber mood and sound of the band here. I had wished that they had assembled this as an entire concert, rather than just re-releasing the ""Stones in the Park"" documentary TV special from 1969, which this new DVD pretty much is. Again, it's not awful. ""Love in Vain"" is absolutely spectacular and seems to be the only song of the eight tracks to escape the out-of-tune plague. Drum-holding guest musicians join the Stones for ""Sympathy for the Devil,"" which is interesting, too. This is a decent document of Mick Taylor's entry into the Stones, but the short running time (55 minutes), an almost dull performance from the otherwise charismatic Keith Richards (a real shock for this fan) and the aforementioned negatives make this a less-thrilling affair than Hampton Colisuem 1981, LA Forum 1975, Marquee Club 1971, Some Girls Live 1978 and Ladies and Gentlemen .... ""Hyde Park Live 1969"" is the Stones, sure, but it shows the band slightly stumbling. Later, the Stones would become a better live band, as seen/heard on Ladies and Gentlemen and Some Girls Live 1978.

P.S. I'm a big fan of the Taylor era. Sticky Fingers is my favorite Stones LP.",1437004800,43,1931,4.830815709969788

Seems like people had a good time and nothing got out of hand like it did at altamont. Also, u.s hells angels were definitely way dickier than th English chapter of hells angels, who seem to be pretty cool actually and are just doing their job versus beating people up for no reason like those fools that were the u.s.

7209264,4,B00YAWJ4OW,"....TV concert was originally intended to be televised ONCE and done. The concert itself was originally intended as an introduction to the so-called New & Improved Rolling Stones.....but was made into a memorial to its founding member Brian Jones who was murdered just two days before the concert. During the concert scenes, look closely and you'll notice a giant blow up of the gate fold sleeve for their current album Beggars Banquet.
The band itself sounds fine in this DVD but the video transfer leaves a bit to be desired. I've seen bootlegged copies that are as good as this officially released DVD. I sure wished the Stones had put a bit more time and effort into this one as it deserves better treatment. Is it worth spending the $10 or so to get it? That depends on how much you like the Stones. I'm glad I have it but I just wished the band had put more and better content in it. I would have paid double for a well put together version of this DVD.",1442361600,4,959,4.423728813559322

7209270,3,B00YAWJ4OW,"This is far from the Stones' best performance.  The band is frequently out of tune and the sound system is inadequate, to put it politely.  Chopped up for a TV documentary, there are no complete songs --- every performance is interrupted by interview footage or some other digression.  Songs like ""I'm Free"" and ""No Expectations"" don't seem suited to live performance and fall flat.

However, for Stones completists, it's essential, if only because it features the introduction of Mick Taylor as the replacement for Brian Jones, who died a few days before the concert (he had been fired from the Stones earlier that year).

This U.S. Blu-Ray release offers nothing new, although the sound and audio are somewhat better than DVD releases.  If you already have this on DVD, you won't miss much by skipping this one.",1439942400,7,813,4.897810218978102

7209280,5,B00YAWJ4OW,"this has been around unofficially for years, but finally the official release.  i figured an old video like this would be grainy on today's large tvs, so i just bought the dvd.  yes, the pic is grainy, but not bad & very watchable.  the sound is great, rich & full.

the Stones here are filmed well, good lighting & camera angles.  & the Stones are at their loose, raw and blusey before they honed themselves into polished pros.  i like this period of the Stones best.  the added documentary shots of the crowd & Mick & Marianne add to the fun.  this is indeed a time capsule of them in 1969.  this was a tribute show to the newly deceased Brian Jones & the entry of Mick Taylor, the start of the second golden age of the Stones.

some complain that this is short, about 1 hour, but the hour is packed.  highlights include raw versions of ""Jumping Jack Flash"", ""Honky Tonk Women"" & ""Love in Vain"".

7209282,1,B00YAWJ4OW,"Not keeping at all in the spirit of the previous high standard of The Rolling Stones ""From The Vault"" series,  this is merely the short TV special ""The Stones In The Park"". The special was something you could get cheaply for about $5 on little budget labels going all the way to the VHS days. It has also been released officially in Europe and Japan with three bonus songs and with the same visual quality. The stereo mix found here is better, but it is simply a straight reissue of a bonus disk from the deluxe version of a recent live collection ""Sweet Summer Sun"".<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweet-Summer-Sun-Hyde-Park-Live-2DVD-Blu-ray-2-CD-Combo/dp/B00F0JG7E4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweet Summer Sun - Hyde Park Live [2DVD/Blu-ray/2 CD Combo</a>]

Bluntly this is a crap release. Where do I start?. OK like I mentioned we just get the original TV special with none of the three bonus songs that have gone on the official European or Asian releases. No commentary, no bonus footage of additional songs that may still be in the archive, no contemporary footage of them on TV in 1969 to fill up the very short disk, zip, zilch, nada. This was fine as a bonus disc on another release, not so fine as a new release on it's own. This goes against the very concept of ""From The Vaults"" which has always given the buyer a little something extra for their money.

This is beyond a bare bones release. At very least they could have put the entire concert on the blu ray as a audio only feature. I mean a blu ray has so much capacity and they put a paltry hour of footage. It shouldn't cost more than the $5 VHS I got in 1990 they way they did this.

The notes are also pretty insulting to Brian, which shouldn't be surprising being that this is a Mick and Keith special. He's referred to only as their former guitarist, and there isn't one photo of him. No mention of his multi instrumental abilities, no mention of his founding the band, no mention of his early leadership. Keith takes credit for the Johnny Winter song getting played because he bought the album the month before. This is bull, every former account of this show mentions the song was played because it was one of Brian's current favorites.

Of course there is no separate LP/CD of the concert coming out this time either. I guess they don't want to release what was their first, and ultimately their worst, show with Mick Taylor. However that doesn't make sense in light of them putting out the film. Perhaps people would enjoy the show more if heard in it's full context, but I guess we will never know.

As it stands this blu-ray should be recalled and have the 3 songs added. I won't pre order anything Stones I am unsure of content wise ever again. I'm very tempted to send it back. For those who have not bit yet, DON'T BUY THIS VERSION. Get yourself a foreign copy with the bonus songs. Most DVD players will play overseas DVD's if you know what buttons to press.
UPDATE 9-18-2015 Just learned the few who find my review too harsh on the basis of the ""new"" stereo remix are in for a harsh surprise. This ""new"" stereo version has been out for two years as a bonus on the ""Sweet Summer Sun"" 5 disc deluxe version I have the vinyl with DVD for that and did not realize this is simply that repackaged to unknowing fans.
