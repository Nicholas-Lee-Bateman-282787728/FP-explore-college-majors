970250,3,6305133425,"This is an offbeat little film that showcases the ever adorable Goldie Hawn, who plays a cocktail waitress thrust into the spotlight when she singlehandedly thwarts an assassination attempt on a visiting Emir from a strategically placed, Middle Eastern country. Having taken a bullet in the butt during her heroic fight with the gunman, she becomes a media darling overnight, as she is a breath of fresh air. The media and the public gobble her up, while the White House staff, aware of her effect on the public, hire her to work in the protocul office. Unbeknownst to her, she is being used politically, and has been underestimated by the staff with whom she works. When she becomes aware of what is going on, she turns Washington on its head, and, in the process, completely changes her life. Good things do happen to good people. A cute movie, with a good cast, though not that many laughs.",996969600,10,893,4.694267515923567
970251,2,6305133425,"A delusive waitress who suddenly becomes a heroine by saving the Emir of a  Middle East country from death. That's the story of Sunny Davis in this  mediocre comedy. Despite the talents of Goldie Hawn as the title character  and Chris Sarandon as Michael Ransome, her secret and shy admirer, the film  goes so superficially on a very delicated subject: a political scandal  involving the White House. After turning out to be a national celebrity,  Sunny is sent to Ohtar, a strategic country in the Middle East, in order to  marry the Emir as part of a secret agreement between the United States and  Ohtar. Certainly the screenwriters of this movie could not imagine, sixteen  years ago, that an actual scandal involving the White House - the Monica  Lewinski affair - would be much better and more effective than this one. In  fact, Protocol scandal doesn't work very well. First, because the heroine  doesn't even know she was part of a secret plan. This is such so ingenous  that everyone can notice how bad is the screenplay. Second, because  Goldie's character is not quite funny - her spontaneity tends to be vulgar  sometimes - more a prostitute than a patriot (that's what a cover magazine  says about his meteoric rise to fame). In other words, this film deserves  only two stars. That's enough.",965865600,,1305,4.780269058295964

971014,5,6305133425,Protocol is a light and airy comedy that I always found hysterical and fun. Goldie Hawn was at her best when she played these sort of characters. Her facial expressions and mousy voice added to the humor. You just cant help but love the woman for her comedic genius. Here she plays sunny Davis and average woman living in Washington working as a waitress. One night while heading home she witnesses an attempted assassination and without hesitation she brings down the culprits but ends up shot in the butt. She becomes a huge American sensation and ends up with a job within the government. Soon she realizes she was pimped out to the King for some military contract and it all comes to the surface with such humor. If you are a comedy lover and don't need foul mouths or sex talk to laugh then this comedy will surely please.,1394668800,,827,4.52

971116,5,6305133425,"These two films are comedies that are timeless and that I wanted to include in my collection of movies.  I am not one to purchase many comedies as I feel many of the storylines do not holdup overtime and keep me entertained with laughter.  The performances of Goldie Hawn and the supporting cast members are what makes me see this movie at least once per year.  The common link between these two films are the perspective of a young, less than worldly, single female trying to find herself in the military and to succeed in a position of responsibility without the tools that most of the people around her try to use to their advantage for advancement and recognition.  Goldie does a good job of having the viewer see her project the funny side of how to handle a difficult situation and than in the end coming out on top.

But the feisty Judy Benjamin character is so poignant for me.  She was spoiled and a bit dense in the beginning of the movie but turned into a fierce fighter by the end.  That's growth and that's what I like in my female characters.  Also in Protocol, Goldie played a similar character in that she was a bit naive at the outset but learned to play the game and not be played by the end of the story.  Private Benjamin and Protocol: Goldie Hawn in her heyday.  You can't go wrong with either movie.",1332460800,,651,4.278688524590164
971215,2,6305133425,"Or so says Judy Benjamin's father, played viciously by Sam Wanamaker.  After watching Private Benjamin for the second time in several decades, I'm not certain he's wrong.  Abysmal at making choices, Judy Benjamin (played by Goldie Hawn), is not the brightest character ever written.  From start to finish, we watch her struggle with one bad decision after another.  That she occasionally succeeded seemed more fluke than any level of maturity on her part.  That this was dubbed a comedy is even more mystifying.  I found this movie incredibly sad.  Judy Benjamin stubbles and bumbles her way through life, a creature of bad habits, then, at the eleventh hour, has an epiphany and makes another bad decision (why walk when you can ride?).  I don't see anything triumphant in her finally averting disaster.  I also have absolutely no confidence that the rest of her life would be any better.  This was not a happy movie and I did not enjoy watching it.  And by the way, widescreen would not have helped.

As for Protocol, there's a movie that managed to insult just about everyone.
Once again, Goldie and giggle affects another nave nincompoop.  Here she plays a simpleton among snakes, poor Sunny without a clue who stumbles into the role of a heroine.  She's so cartoonish it's impossible to find a shred of humanity in her portrayal.  Her circumstance is so outrageous it defies even base humor.  The rest of the cardboard cast doesn't help.  The four conspiring villains are all of one note, like a Greek Chorus, shrill at the same time; it was incredibly annoying, not funny.  That Sunny is finally given away like a gift basket of fruit was, for me, that last I could take; I truly didn't believe it could get any worse than that.  I was wrong.  The rest of the movie drowns in so much sanctimonious drivel I thought my head would explode.  Exactly who or what was the target of this....satire (I'm being kind; I wanted to call it something else)?

Just before watching this DVD, I idly wondered whatever happened to Goldie Hawn?  I believe her last film role was in 2002.",1309219200,2,2076,4.705555555555556

In ""Private Benjamin"" she goes from a pampered, inept & vain ""Jewish Princess"" to a confident, accomplished woman.  In ""Protocol"", she is a naive, country-bumpkin who masters the art of diplomacy; easily out-shining the seasoned professionals. These movies have many laugh-out-loud moments.  More importantly, society's underestimation of women's capabilities and the empowerment of women are subtle under-lying threads in these films.

971342,4,6305133425,"In her classic somewhat dizzy but always likeable role, Goldie Hawn plays Sunny Davis, an unassuming, average gal who happens to stumble into some unbelievable circumstances.  Sunny is a cocktail waitress in Washington, DC, who while standing outside watching a crowd scene, happens to be standing next to a guy who pulls a gun.  In an act of heroics, she grabs the gun and thwarts his attempt on an Arab royal.  She becomes a media darling afterward, appearing on many covers of magazines and being praised for her act.  A government department, in an effort to cash in on this gal's 15 minutes, invites her to become a representative of the Washington Protocol department, preforming acts of international diplomacy.  She bungles through much of it, but approaches things with a sense of humor and brings a lightheartedness to the otherwise stuffy parties and duties.  In an odd twist, Sunny was unknowningly promised to the Emir whose life she saved as a wife.  She is then traded to him in exchange for military supplies and loyalty.  A rather quirky movie that had always been in my favorite list.

While the humor is obvious (fish out of water, culture and class conflict, etc.), there are some lessons to be learned.  Sunny is and all American gal who doesn't know much about the world she lives in.  Indeed, when she is brought before a committee to investigate the goings on of her trade to the Emir, she spells it out by saying that she is responsible for all the problems.  She bought all the fame and fortune and glam without knowing what she was getting.  She never read the paper, never read the Declaration of Independence before taking some visiting dignitaries to see it, and never watched the news.  She wasn't concerned with those things.  But once she was thrust into the middle of it, she suddenly was.  How many of us will end up in this situation?  Very few.  But we do owe it to ourselves to be more informed and see the forest from the trees.  Perhaps her example will serve for some change.",1184112000,,2016,4.660056657223796

971346,3,6305133425,"The 1984 movie Protocol comes from the school of political films such as Guarding Tess and Dave. These films all strip Washington politics to the bare bones and allow gentle satire and wit to rub elbows with the American political machine.
As a comedy, Protocol does have its moments, though Dave garners the most laughs. As a demonstration of pure acting ability, stick with Guarding Tess. Why then should someone plunk hard-earned bucks down on a movie such as Protocol?
Goldie Hawn is a cultural icon and gives any movie she appears in some basic worth. Buck Henry, who is known for early Saturday Night Live appearances, directing Heaven Can Wait, and the screenplay for the Owl and the Pussycat, wrote the screenplay for Protocol. Herbert Ross, who directed The Goodbye Girl, sits in the director's chair. Most importantly, those who fondly remember any of the above mentioned names will appreciate the blast from the past that Protocol represents.
Without giving away too much of the film's surprises, Goldie plays a ditzy character who finds herself doing the right thing at the wrong time. In this particular case, she inadvertently saves the life of a visiting Arab political figure. Apparent gratitude from the U.S. government eventually lands Hawn's character a position on the White House's protocol team. There, Goldie finds herself to be basically a pawn. In her own abnormal fashion, Goldie proves that pawns can, in fact, win the game.
One special historical note is brought forth through viewing Protocol in a post-Sept. 11th world. Hollywood's portrayal of Arabs has uniquely changed during the years since Protocol originally played in theaters across America.",1029024000,3,1679,5.131386861313868

The first third whereby Sunny Davis becomes an American hero and media darling is fantastic.  One liners abound and a good time is had by all.  The parade in Sunny's hometown, brought to you by Schmitter's Hardware, is so dead on.  The film looses a bit of steam in it's mid-section (See the Safari Party) and get's a bit preachy and All-American in the end but the set-up and Hawn are terrific.  Buck Henry's script is funny.

7883462,4,6305133425,"Well shot, well acted, factually incorrect here and there, this film is fairly decent from when I remember seeing it all those years ago.  Seeing a hidef transfer via a stream from Amazon really helps accentuate the solid visuals used in this film.

Hawn, the ""girl with short blonde hair"" plays the object of romantic interest for a Calif of some non-descript Middle Easter (Arabic) nation, like a Yeman or Oman, and sets his heart on someone who seems right for him.

The film is somewhat clich, and by that I mean some of the visual montages used to sell the idea that Hawn's character is a national sensation, to me, don't really ring as being true.  But then again, that's kind of what movies are for, but even so a little more plot explanation, I think, was needed to help bolster her character's success to better explain the troubles that result from that success.

Either way it's a fun little film, even if implausible (even for a romcom).  It has a lot of funny parts, and it might have been more than what it already is.  See it once.",1519603200,,1046,4.473684210526316
