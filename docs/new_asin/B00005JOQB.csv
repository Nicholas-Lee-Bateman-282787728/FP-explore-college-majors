1551770,4,B00005JOQB,"Hostel (Eli Roth, 2006)

[note: 250 words cut from review to meet Amazon length requirements.]

Six or seven years ago, I saw Guinea Pig 2: Flower of Flesh and Blood for the first time. Now, for those of you unfamiliar with the Guinea Pig series, they pretty much defined Japanese Extreme Horror in the eighties, and Flower... is the most extreme of the lot. It has no plot; it's just a guy in white face paint and a samurai suit dismembering someone for sixty minutes and change. My copy was a grainy, badly-tracked bootleg, and I was still utterly fascinated at the same time I was repulsed. The main thing that went through my mind is ""who would make a movie like this?"" When it was over, in some way I have never been able to define, I was changed.

I tell you all this at the beginning of this review because, while Hostel falls far short of the high(?) points of Japanese Extreme Horror, as far as American movies go, the films that came before this leave a lot to be desired in the way of bare-bones filmmaking; America's contributions to Extreme Horror have always been somewhat cheesy.

Eli Roth, on the other hand, knows how to make a movie; Cabin Fever was one of the best shaggy-dog jokes in years, and the director's cut had gore to rival Takashi Miike's Ichi the Killer. Roth obtained the backing of Quentin Tarantino, who was similarly impressed with his first outing, and the two of them set about convincing the MPAA, I presume, that the reason Americans are utterly incapable of meeting Japanese New Horror on its own turf is because we never went through the painful childbirth of Japanese Extreme Horror. So, then, the question becomes-- what happens when you put a better filmmaker in charge of what is, essentially, a spiritually-bonded remake of the extreme revenge films of the seventies?

The biggest criticism I can level against Hostel is not a fair one; simply put, it's not Japanese. Americans have a different set of taboos, and Roth wanted to go whole hog, so he's taking potshots at a whole batch of things that Japanese wouldn't even consider. Because of that, the first half of the film tends to drag. Once it gets going, though, you'll be hard-pressed to tell the difference between this and any Charles Bronson film that comes to mind, except you've got marginally better actors here.

Two American grad students, Paxton (Ladder 49's Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Dumb and Dumberer's Derek Richardson) are taking some time off from school and backpacking through Europe. While in Paris, they hook up with Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson in his feature film debut), an Icelander with raging hormones. The three of them are traipsing through Europe in a sex- and drug-fueled haze when they bump into Alexei (fellow newcomer Lubomir Silhavecky), who promises them that there's a hostel in a small town in Slovakia that will cater to all their wildest desires. They set out for it, and find it to be nothing short of paradise.

Now, the big problem is, you're already halfway through the movie, and the only scene that begins to do justice to the trailers is the opening credits. Those looking for a Guinea Pig-esque experience will no doubt be grandly disappointed by all this. But hang on, folks, things will start looking like the trailers eventually.

The best thing about Hostel, by a mile, is the incredible cinematography. Milan Chadima, who normally acts as a second- or third-unit assistant director on his films, is equally at home filming gorgeous Slovakian panoramas, dark corridors, and the acres of nude female flesh that inhabit the first half of the film. Sometimes, with a movie this beautifully shot, it's possible to ignore a wooden script or bad pacing, but you don't need to here; while, as I said, the first half does tend to drag, once we get into the action, the pacing is pitch-perfect, and the main characters usually turn in good, if not exceptional, performances.

But you couldn't care less about that. you want to know about the gore.

The gore effects are, shall we say, impressive. It's not necessarily that there are a whole lot of them, it's the pervasiveness of the gore-drenched atmosphere in the second half of the film that really makes it all seem worthwhile. It's mostly just atmospheric, which is where the film falls so short of Japan's entries into the extreme horror world, but Roth does get personal with a minor character, Ikana (Puritan beauty Jennifer Lim). It's Ikana who, if this film has the effect on you that Guinea Pig 2 did on me, will leave you fundamentally changed.

When you put all the pieces together, Hostel is flawed, but Eli Roth has traversed far more distance than any other filmmaker in dragging America, and its painfully Victorian MPAA, kicking and screaming into the 1980s. The amount of stuff Roth got away with, even in the theatrical cut, is cause for unreserved celebration. I can't wait for the director's cut, to see how much more he had to leave out.

The short version of all this is: if you're looking for a nonstop extreme horror ride, Guinea Pig 2 is no longer the obscure, hard-to-find title it was when I was reduced to buying a crappy bootleg on ebay; you can get a gorgeous remastered DVD now. You can even buy it from Amazon. And you'd probably be better off doing do. But if you want a film that's going to attack American values all the way around, where you just happen to get some good gore in the process, and you want something made in America, you will not, as of this writing, find a film that got major distribution anywhere in American history that fulfills the requirements nearly as well as does Hostel. ****",1136592000,7,5624,4.692697768762677
1551771,4,B00005JOQB,"When Cabin Fever came out a few years back many people I know loved the film because of it's camp style, but still feverish gore. Peter Jackson praised the film, so many horror fans flocked to go see it. Many people thought that the film was too light hearted, and not dark enough. Director Eli Roth promised that his next film, Hostel, would be much darker without as much light hearted moments. Now released on January 6th, 2006 we can finally see what he is talking about.

The film as just that, not a horror film, is a pretty well organized one not suffering from shotty editing, rushed action sequences, score issues, acting, or dialogue. From the opening shots of the film, we get a very dark look to the torture area that is the topic of the film. The score throughout makes the intro very suspensful, and that hasn't even covered the other parts of the film yet.

Then we get into the introducitons of the main characters. The 3 men, 2 of whom are from California, the other they met in France while Backpakcing are in Amsterdam enjoying what there is to enjoy. Checking out the red light district, enjoying some herbal substances. While out past curfew they meet Alex who informs them that in Brataslava there is a Hostel with many beautiful wemon who ""love"" American men. The 3 decide to head there the next day, and thus the rest of the film unfolds.

Is this film really as gory, twisted, macabre, and scary as they advertise it? Well for me it was 3 out of the 4 I listed above. Eli Roth writes with a lot of dark humor, so for someone like me who loves to laugh at brutal situations this film was defenitly twisted. There were limbs cut off, fingers sliced, autopsies performed, and a nice little scene with an torch. The only thing is I did not find the film scary. Suspensful? No question, but for scares the film really didn't make me cover my eyes in fear. I loved every blood soaked second of the torture scenes as Eli carefully shot each scene and used the special effects to the upmost advantage.

Eli Roth has defenitly done a better job with this film than he did with Cabin Fever. He matured as a writer and took elements of his dark comedy, but also went the extra step and took the brutality the whole extra mile. For horror fans this is what alot of us have been waiting for, and for non horror fans? Certain scenes may have you wanting to leave the theater, and or turn your eyes away but after all, it's only a movie right?",1136505600,5,2453,4.384615384615385
1551772,2,B00005JOQB,"Poor Bratislava and Slovakia, talk about a place getting bad treatment from the movie industry. First it gets ""armpit of the world treatment"" in ""Eurotrip"", then it gets portrayed as the center of private enterprise torture in ""Hostel"". I saw ""Hostel"" on impulse (seeing Tarentino's name after the film title on the theater's list of show-times) without realizing it was the actually the brainchild of Eli Roth, who apparently intended it as a homage to Takashi Miike's ""Audition"". It is a slight improvement on Roth's boring first movie, ""Cabin Fever"". Although neither movie (Roth's stuff does not rise to the level of an actual film) is even remotely scary, at least with ""Hostel"" Roth keeps his tendency toward ""Evil Dead"" silliness in check until the last few minutes.

Anyway the first half of the film is pretty much a replay of ""Eurotrip's"" Amsterdam and train travel scenes, including the funny pervert in the train compartment. I found myself wishing very early in the movie that the three guys were traveling with Michelle Trachtenberg. This wish intensified during the sauna scene in the hostel where the only exploitation elements were a skanky Russian blonde and her fat slug-like friend. The movie would certainly have benefited visually from Trachtenberg's presence.

Anyway the three guys arrive in Bratislava and Roth slowly reveals that it is the home ground of a club that provides its members with people to torture and kill (watch 2002's ""My Little Eye"" if you think Roth might actually be doing something original). At this point the thing starts to look a lot more like ""Toolbox Murders"" than ""Audition"" and I began to yearn for an appearance by Angela Bettis. But instead Roth gives us a confused Asian girl who can't speak English very well.

Fortunately or unfortunately you never actually identify with those being tortured. But there is at least a point to all the torture as it gives the hero a reason to inflict ultra-violence once the tables are turned and the audience an excuse to mildly cheer from that point until the movie itself thankfully expires. There was no audience applause at the end as everyone was in a hurry to get out and have some BBQ down the street.

To make matters worse for the Slovakia Ministry of Tourism, the one thing Roth manages to do very well is to convey the isolation felt by a tourist in a strange place and the target on the back of Americans in foreign countries these days. Given our image in the eyes of the world these days if such a torture business did exist it is likely that American victims would be in great demand and would command a healthy price premium. There are not just corrupt police but a gang of street urchins who extort gum and candy from visitors.

""Hostel's"" wide theatrical release and $18 Million marketing campaign (verses just $4 Million production cost) pay homage to P.T. Barnum's comment: ""No one every went broke 'underestimating' the intelligence of the American people"". There is little danger that Roth will ever be mistaken for David Cronenberg. Save your money for the ""Saw II"" DVD.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1136505600,2,3133,4.8249534450651765
1551773,3,B00005JOQB,"I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since hearing about its nasty little premise.  The idea of paying money to torture and kill with impunity is creepy beyond all human comprehension.  Sadly the film doesn't deliver enough shocks or squirms to pay off my high expectations.  Like Saw, Hostel tries to ride far too long on the messed up factor and lacks the cohesion required to, well, keep it together.

Whether this is a reflection on society at large or my own jaded mentality toward onscreen horror, Hostel fails to provide that much needed jolt to the genre.  By all accounts this movie should have been great.  It's about one hundred fifty times better than Cabin Fever, which so many people seemed to love, so there's a plus.  Eli Roth seems to be getting the hang of the directing thing.  However, there are too many scenes where torture is happening and the imagery is left to the imagination.  This is a movie, we're supposed to see what's happening.

So what exactly is my gripe here?  Hostel just isn't vicious enough.  That's right, for some reason Roth and Co. seemed to have held back on what was promised to the audience.  Not once do you forget that the people on the screen are just acting, which is necessary for the suspension of disbelief.  Finally, the truly disappointing bit, the gore is presented more as background than as the proper effusion of bodily fluids. Not that there isn't gore to be found, it's just not anything to tell the kids about.

I imagine there will be an unrated director's cut with some tag line like ""Too Gruesome for Theaters"" or ""Here's the Real Movie Folks"" and if that happens I'll give Hostel another whirl.  Honestly, if Quentin Tarantino sees promise in the work of Eli Roth that's reason enough for me to follow the guy's career.  If there's a geometric progression to his growth as a director the man could bring the Horror genre something great. In the future.  Not entitled Hostel.

Still, this is a solid attempt at brutal Horror, and for that it deserves one handed applause.  Recent amputees don't have the state of mind or the hardware for full fledged applause. Blame the blood loss.",1136505600,8,2161,4.666666666666667
1551774,1,B00005JOQB,"Sadism, as the release of *Hostel* suggests, is the order of the day.

We need not, however, even examine, really, how or to what extent this film will offend middle-class sensibility; the individual as moral agent is a subject that had some time ago receded from serious consideration, dispatched thither by that many-tentacled monster our culture has become, in which, astonishingly, torture receives sententious treatment in popular media as a viable means of interrogation.  In this era of absent absolutes, all human activity becomes equally meritorious because precisely none is--at least, that is, from the point of view of any reliable moral calculus.  To judge one (negatively) is to oppress him usurpatiously, without license, because no one enjoys that God's-eye view where all contigent situational skirmishes resolve into a more comprehensively scrutable context.

No, I will not natter on about bourgeois morality and the assault from all quarters that it constantly suffers; to point this out is to say nothing new.

The arrival of *Hostel,* which I'm sure will, like the blood-laced pabulum it is, be lapped up with glee  by the same Adderall-addled first-person-shooter-shooters whom it has been my tremendous misfortune to (attempt to) teach, is infelicitous for another reason: it contributes, at a time in which it has never been more dangerous to do so, to the inevitable desensitizing to sadistic brutality which occurs with every film and video game of this genre, where violence, if not represented in a humorous vein (See: just about every Quentin Tarantino film.  Incidentally, Tarantino, like some infernal latter-day P. T. Barnum, grants his imprimatur to *Hostel*), is represented simply for its own sake--some clinical curiosity, epiphenomenal with drawing air in a human form, and nothing more.

Indeed, I have seen an earlier version of this film.  It then bore the title, *The Abu Ghraib Prison Scandal.*

The parallels of the story of *Hostel,* in which some American dunderheads embark on an ill-fated tour of hedonism in a former Soviet satellite state, to contemporary events are uncanny enough to make one wax conspiratorial.  I need only cite ""extraordinary rendition"": diffuse weaselese for the surreptitous flouting of the protections of the Geneva Convention.  To be extraordinarily rendered is, as I understand it, to be whisked away to some former Soviet satellite state in order to be interrogated clandestinely in a place where the Geneva Convention has about as much real moral traction as *Poor Richard's Almanac* has for the typical American today.

Makes you think, don't it?

While I am certainly open to arguments to the contrary, it is my conviction that, in foisting this squalid little piece of snuff on a (let's admit it) rather ignorant, impressionable, sycophantic mass audience, Quentin Tarantino and *Hostel* writer-director Eli Roth stand guilty of acting with a degree of social and political irresponsibility that, given the current climate of dirty war for dubious aims, can only be considered destructively un-American.  They have cynically cashed in on what I do not doubt will be perceived in the future as a sad epoch of American cultural history in order be the on the vangard of a sordid recrudescence of grand-guignol.  They have seen to it that, when torture becomes art, art becomes torture.

...And decadent art, which *Hostel,* Artaudian in its pretensions but lacking the requisite intelligence, most certainly is, has historically been a sure symptom of an empire in collapse.

So enjoy your blood and circuses, unlettered plebes.  Ignore the heat, and ignore that sound in the distance; it's only Nero tuning his violin.",1136505600,8,3698,5.26916524701874
1551775,5,B00005JOQB,"I think modern horror films are trying to isolate me.  After seeing Wolf Creek I don't want to go touristing in the outbacks of Australia.  Now I can check off Bratislava as a place to spend time partying in hostels.

Before I even saw this movie I was worried.  Not that the movie would terrible.  But that the movie would be almost too successful.  The idea is that, for the last half of this 95 minute movie, you are watching guys getting tortured, maimed and disfigured.  Take away the makeup and the fact that this movie involves actors and you are basically watching a snuff film.

Now I have been watching horror films for as long as I can remember and probably before I should have.  But I have a firm grasp on reality and am a (mostly, haha) well-adapted 25 year old without a violent bone in my body.  I understand horror films and their cathartic feeling at the end.  Its all about tension and release, providing thrills and an adrenaline rush in the same way I imagine a person gets driving fast cars, jumping out of airplanes, etc.  The only difference is that in sitting in the movie theatre, I don't have to worry about crashing into anything.

What I am getting at is that there is a difference between reality and ""reelity.""  I could easily sit back and decry this as being pornography of violence or no different than a snuff film (with the exception of the loss of life, granted).  Or I could look at it as the perfect exercise in terror.  For those interested in getting their thrills/adrenaline rush in the relative safety of a movie theatre, this film is the perfect way to do it.

It begins, ironically enough, as a buddy movie, back-packing in Europe ala Eurotrip.  There are three guys basically looking for pot and getting laid.  It has been the beginning to many a teen comedy and you can see what Eurotrip would have been had Cooper not gone to Wondersexxx but instead found this.  Ultimately ending up in Bratislava (just like in Eurotrip) at a Hostel, they realize they aren't getting what they expected.  What follows is a grisly tour of nightmarish proportions of torture and human trafficking for money.

When Eli Roth debuted with Cabin Fever, I saw a spark that this guy knew what he was doing.  I didn't particularly care for most of Cabin Fever (mostly because it was terribly miss-advertised) but I could tell he had a grasp on this horror thing.  And he had a handle on grim or dark comedy.  Hostel is disgusting, it will get beneath your skin much in the same way certain Asian horror films like Audition will.

What helps ground Hostel is the fact that the setup is quite  possible.  I'm never one to fully listen to the ""Based on true events"" hoopla a lot of horror films have been tossing around recently, but this is one film that you can see happening.  In a world that does have snuff films, hostels and people who have an amazing propensity for evil, things that happen in this film could happen.

I was afraid I wouldn't like this film.  I thought that maybe it would go too far past the line.  I won't lie and say its not a gross film because it is.  Its depictions of violence are horrific and there were a couple scenes in which I found myself looking away or cringing.  But Eli Roth does something interesting.  What a good horror film does is show us not only the horror in other people's psyche but also in our own.  Its not the monster under your bed you should be worried about, its some of the people out there.  Hostel shows this but also shows some of that in its protagonists.  There was a scene toward the end that has the whole theatre clapping and cheering.  It was a great scene but also illustrates my point.

Without adding to the considerable hype (Quentin Tarantino presenting it?  Check.  Both he and Robert Rodriguez claiming its the ""scariest American horror film in a decade?"" Check...) it can be considered a masterpiece of terror.  Wolf Creek was brutal but I enjoyed it.  Saw I and II showed more on screen than I thought I would ever see in a theatre, but they were fun.  Hostel?  Hostel was an entirely different, more brutal beast.  I love horror films.  I have never had a nightmare after seeing them.  I'm not sure if this is an endorsement of the film, but, tonight, as silly as it might sound, I'm putting off going to sleep.",1136505600,7,4307,4.467265725288832

Cheap, unrealistic effects. Minimal story. Horrible direction, acting, what passes as a ""script"". All applicable to almost any of his films. Two exceptions, cabin fever as i said. Which im convinced he had so little hands on and was surrounded by great talent, is what made it good. Second, and worst, knock knock. Which will be the biggest mistake keanu reeves ever does and that says alot. Knock knock was a bigger disgrace than the green inferno and that had touches of necrophilia and diarrhea porn.

1552396,5,B00005JOQB,"How does this film have a 3 star average?! I'm a big horror guy and have been since I was a kid. Unfortunately, the majority of contemporary horror films are garbage. There's been this huge surge in paranormal horror over the last few years and before that it was the watered down teenage-targeted 90s stuff. I can confidently say that Hostel is the best horror film of the 21st century. The complaints people state in Amazon reviews are ridiculous. First, yeah there's a lot of nudity. Nutidy has been a tradition in horror films since the 70s and for good reason. The juxtaposition between nudity and gore creates a stronger sense of realism when done correctly. The amount of nudity in Hostel is certainly matched with the amount of gore, and I think that was a calculated move by Eli Roth. It creates a sense of vulnerability and compliments the graphic scenes that occur later on in the film. Secondly, this film has been dubbed ""torture porn"" by the critics. In actuality it was a subversive indictment on torture. This was in the midst of the Bush-Cheney regime, where we were illegally torturing people on the other side of the world. Horror films have a rooted history in political subtext. Last House on The Left was a statement about Vietnam and so were a lot of horror films from that era. Hostel is an important social statement because torture is nightmarish. That's the whole point of this film. Vulnerable people in an unfamiliar place, enduring the worst things imaginable. Truly terrifying and a modern masterpiece.",1435968000,,1533,4.788679245283019

1552463,3,B00005JOQB,"Paxton and Josh are college students backpacking through Europe looking for drugs, women, and good times. Oli, an goofy Icelandic drifter, joins their crew along the way. They pause in Amsterdam for prostitutes and pot, but are locked out of their hostel after curfew. Alexi gives them a place to stay and directs them to a hostel in Slovakia filled with desperate women. Slovakia seems a bit weird, but the promise of beautiful women turns out to be true. Everyone has fun until the next day Oli and few other hostel residents are unexpectedly gone. Paxton and Josh try to still have a good time because Oli was really a stranger. Then Josh disappears as well, leaving Paxton to run around frantically trying to find them. Then he ends up just like his friends: in the clutches of Elite Hunting, an organization where the rich kill people for ungodly sums of money.

Hostel has an interesting concept: a secret Elite Hunting organization has members who pay large sums of money to kill tourists in the manner of their choosing in Eastern Europe. I enjoy the second half of the film where Paxton has to find his way out of the murder facility. The mood is very tense and suspenseful, which is pretty rare in the torture porn genre. The torture scenes are well done where not everything is in your face. The blood and gore flow freely, but Eli Roth knows when to use extreme closeups and when to leave it to the imagination. Too many other films just show everything, but it frankly gets boring after a while. Hostel is also the first film to be dubbed torture porn and one of the first in the resurgence of ultra gory films in the 2000s. These are really the only positives about Hostel.

While the audience is supposed to sympathize with the American tourists, Paxton and Josh are the two of the most obnoxious and insufferable douchebags ever to grace the screen. They go through Europe chasing drugs and sex without regard to anything else. They complain about people not speaking English and mock each other for acting like anything other than the most masculine of men. The audience is supposed to identify with and root for them, but I have trouble even remotely liking them. When he is disguised and trying to escape the Elite Hunting facility, Paxton gets a glimpse of what he and Josh could have been in about 15 or 20 years. He meets a brash, ubermasculine American client who has done all the whoring and drugs there are until it's just boring to him. Elite Hunting is a way for him to feel alive and virile again. Paxton is on the road to turn into this man if he can afford Elite Hunting's rates. Why should the audience sympathize with someone who would eventually be on the other side? By the time the carnage starts, they have barely enough humanizing characteristics that I don't really want to see them die. Their portrayal may be based on the assumption that the viewers would be more like them: male, 18-25, and hypermasculine bros. It could be argued that it's a commentary on the typically American tourist attitude, but the ending of the film and the two dimensional portrayals of the foreign characters seem to be supporting that xenophobic mentality rather than dispelling it.

Hostel is a misogynistic film, but not for the reasons you might think. The first half of the film is a blur of breasts and sex that frankly drags on for too long. Breasts and sex on their own are not misogynistic in and of themselves, but the fact that no female characters have any sort of dimension does. All women in the film fall into these categories: sexual objects, evil temptresses, and damsels in distress. These characters are flatly good, evil, or just sexy. None of them really have their own opinions or will, but are just a cog in the machine of the sex industry or the murder for pay industry. The prostitutes at the beginning of the film are only there because of their ability to titillate the audience and the male leads. They barely even speak. There's one line comparing the sex industry with paying to torture and kill people, but it's another message only paid lip service with no real support. Natalya and Svetlana are the exotic and beautiful women who turn out to be the evil temptresses who lure and drug Paxton and Josh to their deaths. They are simply and flatly evil and want to earn money, like evil prostitutes who use their bodies and looks to lure hapless tourists. Of course they aren't evil enough to have any real authority in Elite Hunting, which is exclusively used and run by men. The last woman is Kana, a Japanese woman who is midtorture when Paxton saves her. She ends up throwing herself in front of a train after seeing her ruined eye in her reflection. It seems the character only exists for Paxton to look like less of a douchebag before dying and providing a distraction for Paxton to evade the Elite Hunting people. It's also pretty offensive that she seems to kill herself over her ruined looks.

No one in the film really fares well in either the way they are portrayed or their fate in the film. While I like parts of it and I think it's a very influential film in the horror genre, Hostel simply isn't constructed well and wants you to think that it's against xenophobia and misogyny when it ends up affirming these ideas throughout the course of the film.",1423699200,2,5312,4.594309799789252

This movie is a thriller once it gets going and I found myself rooting for the ""good guy"" as he paid back some of these twisted F**KS! I also enjoyed the street rats (A.K.A.

With all the really bad horror movies that come out, I can see why some would like this movie a lot. It is much better than most of the garbage they call horror these days. I am glad I watched it, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, but I don't think it's something I need see again.

3 backpackers are in Amsterdam where they get locked out of their youth hostel. They are invited into a man's house where he tells them of a hostel somewhere in eastern Europe where the women are all incredibly hot and have a taste for American men. When they get there, everything is too good to be true - the hostel is ""to die for"".

Review - 5/5
I am amazed and appalled that this only rated 3/5 on Amazon. I guess to many people heard by word of mouth that 'It's so gory & crazy', then felt disappointed when it wasn't all cracked up to be that. First, this has more comedy and breast than gore honestly. The women are hot and the guys are just trying to get laid. It's like American Pie meets gore/horror. And I absolutely dig it! It's a crazy ride that is alotta fun. The last 30 minutes or so are filled with some gory stuff, but it remains serious and not overdone at the end. It was fun and kept my attention the whole time. Of course I'm a guy, dunno if women would honestly find it that appealing.

Hostels are all over the world used by backpackers as well as people trying to save a buck or two.  They cater to the young, and with that said, hormones are wild.

This movie is targeting that young crowd.  Yes it has a lot of nudity, but the characters of the young men are ""true"".  That is where the movie hits it well.  One can't help but to like them, and as an older male, identify with them,

The villains are clearly villains, and to make matter worst, believable.

The sex scenes in this movie were meant to be both a selling point to attract the young crowd, but also to make it easy to understand the mindset of our helpless friends.

1552673,1,B00005JOQB,"Hostel is a vapid, pornographic, shallow, and detestable movie. The characters are unlikeable, the scares are non existent, and the porn is so flagrant that it's demeaning to women.

Let's start with the motive for our main characters right?

-Hey dude, we need to get you laid. Let's go to this cathouse and get you a chick.
-Aw man, we got locked out of the hotel, but wait this nice guy let us into his apartment. ""Hey, do you want to know a place where you can get laid?"" OH MAN, AWESOME! Let's get laid some more.
-Show up at the Hostel. Women take off their clothes. ""Hey you want to get laid?""
- Finally someone is kidnapped, but hey, let's party and get laid before we go find em.

Now obviously you don't go into horror movies to find plot or compelling characters. But you at least want to root for SOMEONE that's about to get axed. Instead you're just given terrible actors with no personalities who annoy you every time they're on screen.

Okay so no likeable characters, fine, but are the scares good?

No! There are no scares! What it is, is disgusting blood and gore. Ankles being cut in half, toes being ripped off, an eyeball being cut free.

Does it make you feel quesy? Absolutely. Is it scary? No, hell no. Maybe if you imagined yourself in their shoes it'd be scary, but no, this movie is just about blood and gore and that's it. Sex, blood, gore. Hey, if that's your thing, by all means, feel free to give it a watch.

Now, there is ONE redeeming quality to this movie that I did enjoy. There is definitely some sweet, sweet vengeance that feels very fitting. The way the movie ended was actually quite awesome and might have even pushed it up a few stars. But the truth is, the entire premise, execution, and overall experience with this movie was just terrible.

High points include slashed achilles tendons (good for the crawling scene) lone head on the table (a favorite here), waving various tools in faces of bound victims and blood spatters everywhere.

Nonetheless, ""Hostel"" is done in such a ""classy"" way -- with a stand-up-and-cheer conclusion that is so euphoric (at least in comparison to what preceded it) -- you just can't keep from singing the film's unstinted praises.

Be prepared, sensitive souls, to suffer the tortures of the damned, without respite, throughout the second half of this nightmarish descent into the macabre.

If you're lucky enough to have them, the bonus features will aid in serving to take the indelible sting out of the film's otherwise enduring terror, by demonstrating its all-too-realistic special effects, and by interviewing the pain-inflicting villains and strapped-down, tortured victims laughing it up and enjoying a sportingly good time with one another.

1553283,5,B00005JOQB,"When it comes to horror films, or any film for that matter, I always look forward to the director's cut. Hostel was advertised as the sickest, most twisted and scariest horror film to be made in the last 10 years. However, I wondered how all this could be packaged into an R-Rated film (you can thank the MPAA for that bit of confusion).

 After its release, people either praised or absolutely hated the film and Eli Roth's filmmaking abilities. Being the curious writer that I am, I wanted to get it straight from the source: Eli Roth and those involved in the making of ""Hostel."" And thanks to DVD, I can.

 ""Hostel: Director's Cut"" is very in depth. The three commentaries alone give so many views on how the film came to be and what it was like during production. What I found in Roth in his solo commentary was his passion for the genre. He gives advice directly to the film student and shares his own success story of how he made it in the business. Also, Roth explains how the idea for ""Hostel"" came about (And you know what? The concept of wanting to know what it would be like to kill somebody and then pay for that experience is a pretty twisted idea).

A nice bonus that was not available in the original ""Hostel"" DVD release is a radio interview with Roth, an Icelandic meal with actor Eythor Gudjonsson and an interview with Takashi Miike (and if you want to see some wicked stuff, Audition and Visitor Q are on Miike's resume).

 On the first disc is a three-part feature (shot by Eli's brother, Gabriel) that takes you through the making of the film, from the last-minute frantic casting to the premier in Iceland. Two separate treats are the multi-angle look at the ""Kill the Car"" scene (once again, a gift to film students) and the mini doc on the makeup masterminds Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger of KNB EFX Group.

 This DVD is generous, and not in just how much there is. This is a DVD for aspiring filmmakers of all genres to have in their collection. You get a great, modern horror flick (yes, I'm one of those who liked the film) and a look at the talented people behind it.",1381536000,,2099,4.417098445595855

Right. Torture people, just like the debasing, humiliating experience of being raped, and then killing them, the same way a person's spirit is killed by being passed from one dirtbag to the next.

1553289,4,B00005JOQB,"This is more-or-less Tarentino's stab at a grindhouse-style movie long before creating the actual movie ""Grindhouse"" (or at least his half of it). The movie is far too sadistic, violent, and gory to be, say, 'enjoyed' to any degree, but that's the point. It just keeps getting worse and worse until a select few can watch it to the end, where your queasiness is rewarded by a grand turnaround finale, where the tortured become the torturers.

1553347,1,B00005JOQB,"Hostel(released Sept/05)stars,among others,Jay Hernandez as Paxton,Derek Richardson as Josh,Eyr Gujnsson as li, and Barbara Nedeljkov as Natalya. I was recently handed this one and didn`t know anything about the film,except Taranino was involved,which piqued my interest. It turned out it was yet another of such plot lines with people getting into places they don't belong and barely escaping with their lives,if at all. But as the film got deeper and deeper into the story,the gore got worse and worse and it became totally gratuitous to the extreme. How many sawed off body parts,drills to the body and blood squirting and spattering everywhere,does one need to see before it is too much. Not alot,but for director/producer/writer Roth,""just one more for the road"",seemed to be his motto.
The story finds three young men,two American and one Icelandic,back packing across Europe. They get a tip from a young man about this hostel in Czechoslovakia,that's not on any maps. The three travel there and manage to hook up with some local action. The next morning Oli,their Icelandic friend,goes missing. We have a cut scene where we see Oli's disembodied head on a table.
That night at a disco Josh feels sick and goes back to the hostel. Later Paxton gets sick and gets lost finding the disco washroom and is locked in a closet instead. The next morning Paxton gets out and finds Josh has gone missing also. Josh,we have seen,was being held prisoner by a man who they had all previously met on the train going to the hostel. He tortured and killed Josh.
Paxton is at loose ends and decides to have a local girl take him to a museum before he finally leaves later. She takes him out to an old factory and he becomes,like his two friends,an unwilling participant in the ""wheel of torture"" game. He loses three fingers but manages to fight and gain his freedom. He inadvertently runs into a fellow American who mistakes him for a client. It seems this whole factory is set up as a large torture chamber for those willing to pay good money for the experience. As Paxton is outside he hears the screams of an Oriental girl he knows and he returns. He extricates her and they both flee to the train station. When she sees her horribly disfigured face she deliberately jumps in front of the in bound train. Paxton gets on and is heading away from this nightmare when he hears the voice of the man that killed Josh. When the train makes a brief stop he gets off and follows the man into the washroom. There he gets his revenge by slicing a part of his hand off and cutting his throat. He gets back on the train and leaves.
This isn't Nightmare on Elm Street,whose violence had an air of tongue in cheek to it. This is not Kill Bill,where we had a lady on a mission whose unreal acrobatics took the violence to a totally different place. No,what we have here is gore just for gore's sake,as the plot plays it all too seriously. We get to see every slice,vein and blood spattering. And believe me,there is blood everywhere in this gigantic torture chamber. In every room there is something twisted and sick going on. It is definitely not for the faint of heart,let me tell you. Long before the end I was totally sickened by what I was seeing.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and was generally clear and crisp,although the film was grainy in some spots. Extras include featurettes,the trailer,commentary and a look at a specific scene with three different angles.
All in all a terribly gory and in my opinion,sick movie. The film plays its plot straight as the three enter a twisted scenario where clients get to pay to torture victims in any way they want. A must to avoid.",1362009600,3,3688,4.6493108728943335

While the situation is a nightmare, the story really isn't that scary. It's bloody and very gory, but it's not going to keep you up at night. It was a good movie, I like blood and guts, but that's not how it was advertised! This was advertised as being one of the scariest movies ever and it just wasn't.

I'll confess that some ""sado-masochistic"" porn movies are stimulating, but that is within the scope of a very limited situation (self-satisfaction) having nothing to do with sheer entertainment, or using the word ART (BLASPHEMY!!) for useless rubbish like this. Those porn movies are ""Snow White"" compared to this......
And you ask WHY our world has descended into the horror in which we live? Or is this Liberal turning right-wing at the age of FIFTY?
The night was dull, surfing channels was my momentary fix, and I stumbled onto this.
Curiously, most serendipitous, since at this very moment a very controversial movie is making the rounds around America with the issue of Osama Bin Laden and our government's torture ""program"" surrounding our two most recent wars (ZERO DARK THIRTY).
The ""revelation"" is that this movie was produced in part by that PHONY, DESPICABLE, MEDIOCRE Sado-masochistic man by the name of TARANTINO. I have always thought him to be a basically populist seller of VICE, cheap entertainment, and (reluctantly, I must say) moments of a certain visionary streak. After all, ""RESERVOIR DOGS"" is a ""good"" film about torture and vengeance about SCUM that proves entirely believable.......
So there you are....
You know that when you watch a PORN film you give blessings to the Gods for the creation of the ""Fast-Forward"" button? Well, tonight I uttered a very special prayer. And don't tell me that I cheated, because I will dismiss you with a wave of my hand.
The ONLY REASON (let us YELL THAT OUT!!!) to watch this GARBAGE is the TORTURE SCENES, and I must confess that an hour after watching these a certain unease is still in my mind. So I guess it worked. But ""The Exorcist"" is a true MASTERPIECE of cinema next to this.
The brutality of the torture scenes is repellent and---well, sickly ""seductive"" because many of us have fantasized about things like this well, less ""artfully"".....
Plot? There is no need for plot. That is why PORN movies with PLOT are RISIBLE.

Three college guys go to Europe and stay at a hostel in Slovakia where they are kidnapped and tortured. That pretty much says enough. And another thing. I don't know what EvilAngel007 mean't that this does happen, but the movie is made up. Eli Roth saw a Thai website that said you could shoot a villager in the head for 10,000 dollars.

I finally gave in last night, though, and figured I could just turn it off if it got to be too much. I ended up watching the whole thing because it was nowhere near as bad as I had it built up in my head to be and was relieved it contains less torture than I was expecting. It's still definitely brutal and cringe worthy to be sure, though. As many other reviewers have noted, the build up is slow, presumably to get you to care about the doomed characters before all the slicing and dicing breaks loose. While that did work for me, I would have preferred a little less of it and a little more focus on the people who were paying big bucks to butcher people in the first place. Other than being obviously soulless, I would have been interested in finding out back stories of more of the sadists and what would compel them to do such horrific acts. But then again, not knowing does make it more disturbing. Although I always feel great glee when those tormented get revenge and it was satisfying to see certain people get their comeuppance here, if Roth had made a complete descent into this nightmare world and not gratified viewers with vengeance, this might have been an unforgettable shocker.",1351209600,2,1304,4.4375

Hostel is not for the weak-hearted! It, along with the Saw movies, created what is known as the ""torture porn"" genre.

I do, however like the first version that came out and, from many customer reviews, think I will like Hostel II.

1553406,2,B00005JOQB,"My expectations going into this film were not particularly high--I knew it had been labeled as ""torture porn"" by some, and that it was't a particularly high-brow movie. But with Quentin Tarantino as producer, I thought maybe this would be slightly a cut above, or at least on par with movies like ""Saw"". Boy was I wrong...

Before we even get to any real action, the viewer must sit through a 45-minute introduction in which Eli Roth tries to insult his audience's intelligence in every possible way. Almost every single character is a cardboard cut-out stereotype--no imagination is used in building them up as characters. Our focus is on two Americans and one Icelandic tourist, who represent in every way an extreme example of ignorant, obnoxious Americanized tourists. Their only goals in Europe seem to be getting laid and pissing off locals for no reason (this behavior is presented as normal, and in fact the one character who is hesitant to sleep with prostitutes in Amsterdam is later presumed gay by another character). In this introductory part of the movie, the audience also has tits thrown at them at a rate far faster than even the American Pie series, leading one to wonder if Roth thought sex appeal would ultimately save this worthless project. But this only seems to make things worse--every single female in the story is shown either in the middle of drunken sex or desperately begging to have some. This representation of women almost makes the first half of the movie read like the script of some frustrated schoolboy's fantasy, and does nothing to advance the characters or the plot.

We then change settings to Slovakia, where the stereotyping of Eastern Europeans is even more appalling than that of Americans and women. Roth paints us a picture of a dark, uncivilized world inhabited by toothless backwater locals, insanely corrupt officials, and children who roam the streets in gangs and are willing to literally kill people over candy. This movie received a big backlash in Slovakia for its portrayal of the Slovak people, and I can see why. A movie shouldn't have to depend on such aggressive stereotyping in order to get its point across.

Anyway, once the real action gets going, the movie improves slightly. The American characters become a bit more human (although one of them is lured away from the town to his doom in a manner that is unbelievably stupid, even by horror flick standards), and some moderate suspense is successfully built up. In these scenes, we finally get to see some gore (which is, after all, what we were looking for all along, right?), and the script starts to rely a bit less on the aforementioned stereotypes.

So did I enjoy certain parts of the movie? Yes, some of the later scenes were more fun, just the type of low-brow thrill that I was expecting. But ultimately it wasn't worth the tedious opening, the horrible portrayals of Americans, women, and Slovaks, and the fact that it was impossible to sympathize with the main characters, due to how pointlessly obnoxious they were. If this is what the first installment was like, I can only imagine how vapid and pointless the sequels were. If you're looking for cheap horror thrills, go watch Saw or even go back to the classic 80s slasher films--don't bother with this one.",1344384000,2,3287,4.843416370106762

1553409,3,B00005JOQB,"Hostel can best be described like this- the first half of it focuses around nothing but sexual acts involving young college boys in Belgium attempting to score with the very attractive near-supermodel quality women that roam the streets over there (and boy are they ever hot!) and the second half is when the actual horror finally gets underway so we witness some gruesome cutting and chopping involving knives, chainsaws, and sharp blades.

Some of the horror is especially disturbing in a mentally screwed up kind of way, especially near the end when the Asian girl gets her eyeball ripped off and yellow mustard drips down her socket.  Later on she realizes while seeing her reflection that she can't go on living in such a way so she then immediately jumps in front of a train and kills herself, shocking all the concerned people around her.

The problem is that the first half is so focused on everything *except* horror that it might not be worth the wait for the actual suspense and horror to develop.  It's supposed to be about a twisted man who captures and butchers young people but... the storyline mainly sticks with the college kids and avoids any kind of compelling storytelling.  I admit it was sort of cool how the captured kids would scream and scream and yet, no compassion on the part of the killer would occur.  Oh, and without spoiling the ending, the gruesome, bloody scenes that take place then happen to be exceptionally low budget.  Not sure if others would agree.

Overall, not a bad horror flick by any means, and I admit that because the women were so attractive I didn't mind the first half of the film at all, but those looking strictly for horror will be disappointed with the lengthy waiting period.",1334275200,2,1731,4.708609271523179

1553455,5,B00005JOQB,"Wow I just want start out by saying what an Incredible Film!!!!!!! Eli Roth Sure knows how to make a Scary Horror movie that Pushes the Envelope in terms of Violence. Hostel Is a must have for any horror buff that loves a scary movie with a great plot incredible acting and a Huge amount of Gore. The plot to this fantastic film is basically as follows these three Backbackers go to a Hostel in a Foreign country. They are really just about meeting women and having a good time with them and by a good time a really good time. So what they are un awar of is the people who own this Hostel are really really evil. They get lured outside of the safe zone one by one they get drugged and kidnapped and then taken too this creepy Hostel place where Really sick Rich men Mostly Business men pay to Torture them and then unfortunatly kill them. All but one  of the Backpackers avoids capture untill he makees a grave mistake and gets brought to the Hostel not drugged but FULLY AWAKE. He sees this sick man with the dead body of his friend Josh. And realizes this Woman who brought him here along with everybody else are out to do him harm. In the end though he has the last Laugh. He manages to escape the Hostel Luckily and rescues this Girl Kona. But she sees herself in a mirror and just cant bear it so she just gives up on life. This movie is great it has a Stunning picture Quality that you normally see with old Horror films.

  This movie has some of the most Realistic Gore effects I have ever seen so coming from a guy like me thats saying a lot cause I see a lot of horror films and I know what looks reall and what looks fake

  and the more beleavable a scene looks the more convincing it is. If you are the type of person that cant stand gore this is not the film for you. Even if you can stand gore it might be still too much cause of all the torture scenes in this movie but if you can handle that along with all the harsh language and nudity you will realize that beneath the dark surface of this movie is quit a Beautiful Motion Picture of a film. Eli roth is iin my opionions one of the best horror Directors out there along with of Course George A Romero. I love films that make you wonder could sometthing like this happen? In this case yes Because Eli Roth said in the Special

  Features of this film that he got the idea for it out of stuff he saw on the internet. Freaky right? So this film has plenty of special features I love the directors cut version of this film its the must buy edition if you are gonna buy this movie. I like that in  this movie unlike in a lot of horror films the Director didn't have all the cast members killed off most are killed off but there is a survivor. This film is one of Eli Roth's best films yet I find it Scarier and Gorier then Cabin fever. It has a better plot then that film to. This film is one that you will want to watch with the lights out so in order to get the true edge of your seat experience that this film delivers

  Because if you watch a horror film during the daytime the effect is less scary I find. I am dissapointed that I had to wait at least 20 minutes on into this film to see the Gory stuff but I guess thats what Suspense is all about. This movie has such a big budget look to it. I like how this film starts out in this happy everythings perfect bright and shinny world but then it winds up

  going to a dark scary dungeon place where its really just Survival of the fitest at this point. I first wondered when i first saw this film who will survive and what will be left of them?I like this movie just as much as SAW. They are in alot of ways very simalar films. This a film that makes you question how far will Directors push the envelope in terms of violence but whats great anbout America I find is Freedom of Speach thats why we the audience gets the uncut version of this film that

  we so Rightfully deserve. My favorite part of this film is when the Backpacker that gets out alive gets revenge on the sick man that killed his friend in the Bathroomm stall That scene is really Gory and very well done. I like how  last but not least this film has two ending two choice from. This is a really dark and scary horror film but if your into that like me and now the differene between fantasy and reality this is a must own movie.",1320883200,,4318,4.080378250591017

Yes there is a good amount of blood and torture but when you break it down it is all justified to the story that was told. Was there nudity?, yes. But isn't that how the most sheltered Americans believe Europe to be and what encourages young college students to venture there. Honestly one of the greatest horror/suspense films I have seen.

1553462,5,B00005JOQB,"Two Americans and their Icelandic traveling partner take a trip through Eastern Europe to party it up in a remote hostel in Slovakia, where they are drugged and kidnapped only to be sold off to an elite hunting organization that specialized in human torture. After a mediocre debut with CABIN FEVER, Eli Roth burst onto the scene in his sophomore effort HOSTEL, a filthy throwback to the Exploitation films of the 1970's that solidified his name in Horror.

HOSTEL, along with other so-called 'torture porn' titles like SAW or THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, has uniformly split Horror audiences based on its use of torture as a main form of entertainment. To say that Roth simply looks to shock and disgust is to grossly misread the entire film in the same way that many critics have dismissed TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE for being too violent. HOSTEL is far more reserved than any of the films that it is most often compared to, and Roth uses implied violence and terror much more often than he does gratuitous gore. Most of the torture sequences are shot off-camera or in cut-aways, leaving the viewer with the victim's twisted facial expressions or screams of anguish. That isn't to say that there isn't gore, because there is, but the gore is only used to accentuate the scenes, and not to define them. True horror always falls secondary to terror in HOSTEL, though this fact is commonly overlooked.

The characters of HOSTEL are another brilliant selling point. These are teens that anyone can relate to, and by working outside of the studio system, Roth is able to write his own fluid and naturalistic dialog without the fear of self-censoring himself for political-correctness. This may lead to some questionable vocabulary, but it lends credibility to his characters. In an interesting twist, Roth has given his male leads distinctly effeminate qualities while he victimizes them in the same ways that most female characters are typically treated in this type of picture. People who appear on the side seem inconspicuous and harmless, which allows the audience to let their guard down along with Paxton, Josh, and Oli as they are lured deeper into the lion's den. Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson are two fun, energetic, and utterly believable characters that draw out a purely empathetic response from viewers that have fully invested in them from early on in the film.

Perhaps its greatest strength lies in the mystery behind the sinister organization, itself. Virtually no information is ever revealed about the group or the men that support it, which makes the entire situation that much more intriguing and terrifying. In a genius move, Roth would go back and fully expose the Elite Hunting Group in the film's sequel, even if the attempt was unable to recapture the success of the original.

On top of everything else, HOSTEL is a huge crowd-pleasure. Roth caters to a very specific audience, one that revels in gorgeous naked girls and bloody set-pieces. He delivers on every intended level, with a script that is both hilarious at times and painfully excruciating at others. The greatest payoff comes during the revenge sequences, where Roth creates genuinely out-of-your-seat excitement as his characters get their payback against the people that betrayed them.

Eli Roth is a Horror fan at heart, and it shows. Though he may have trouble topping this second film, it is obvious that he has a clear control over the genre, and that he has the potential to become one of the next generation Masters of Horror.

1553546,5,B00005JOQB,"Hostel is HANDS DOWN my favorite horror/torture movie of the new millenium.  The scary thing about this movie is, is that this could really happen.  Reality always adds to the fascination and scare factor in horror movies, video games, etc.  The directors got the idea for Hostel when a friend emailed him a site where there was actually a murder-for-profit business in Thailand... which is ""dismembered"" in one of The Director's Cut's featurettes.  So Hostel fans, The Director's Cut is simply a MUST HAVE!!

Also, living in Europe as well as other foreign countries while growing up, I can totally picture this happening to clueless backpackers trekking their way through unknown territory, language barriers, and where people could care less if you're an American or not.  You may think you're entitled (as many Americans feel they are when they travel to a foreign country)--but you're/we're not.

Bottom line:  People are effing sick, and stuff like this happens in real life everyday, all over the world--it's just not shown out in the open for all to see.  Hostel just 'slices and dices', cooks that fact all together, and serves it to you raw in a nice little 'meat' package.

I think in several years people will look back and see that he doesn't have the darkness as a person to make an effective horror film. Like one person had said on a review I was reading earlier, Eli is a cancer to the horror industry!

Now to the movie. I give Eli credit on the idea. It was a good ""Idea"". But after that this became another WAY to overrated Hollywood films. I watched it just from all the people telling me how scary it was. I was really hoping Hollywood had finally made a movie that could compete with the French or Asian horror films. I was wrong. It was another torture porn style film.

If people want to see a movie similar to Hostel's story line then go and get ""Frontier (s) "" a french film. Much more brutal and realistic. Plus disturbing. Hostel is in NO way in the same ball game as what the french and Asians are doing. I'm an American and live in the U.S. but if you're a fan of horror do yourself a favor and think outside what Hollywood wants you to believe is scary. Get netflix and rent some movies before buying them. If you want to see scary go with the French. Here are my recommendations.

1 MARTYRS
2 LET THE RIGHT ONE IN
3 AUDITION
4 FRONTIER (S)
5 INSIDE

First I have to say I don't even KNOW how to classify ""Martyrs"". It's in it's own category. I never get creeped out by a movie but I watched that one 3 weeks ago and I'm still disturbed by it on so many levels! I don't have a clue what will ever top it. ""Let the right one in"" is not as much of a scary movie but more of a perfectly made dark movie that has some very good horror scenes in it. Personally it's my favorite movie of all time.
""Audition"" would of been more disturbing if I hadn't heard all the hype. Still the last 20 minutes are brutal! Well done. This is why I am so impressed with ""Martyrs"" is because there hasn't been much buzz about it yet. Keyword YET!",1271548800,2,1991,4.084398976982097

1553549,5,B00005JOQB,"Hostel: 10 out of 10: Half Eurotrip style sex comedy (with a seventies level of nudity) and half the doctor scene from Bloodsucking Freaks, yeah I might as well stop my review right there it's a 10.

Director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) has scored a bull's eye simply by going back to what makes exploitation films great. Thus he produces a film that could have been lensed in the freewheeling year of 1975 rather than PG-13 stuffy year of 2005.

The film starts with two American college students and an Icelandic hanger on enjoying some debauchery in Amsterdam. They hear about a nirvana for sex and drugs in Slovakia and they pursue it as if they were traversing the Himalayas to find Shangri-La.

What they find is,,, well I won't spoil it for you but they should have stuck with the marijuana brownies and overpriced Dutch hookers.

The movie actually makes torture scenes enjoyable again. (I generally have hated the whole torture motif in modern film for example Rest Stop.) Roth unlike his contemporaries shows the gore without those annoying zooming camera tricks. The leads are unlikable in a fun rather than irritating way (not easy to do) and the film has both a wonderful energy and plentiful surprises.

1553600,1,B00005JOQB,"First off, Hostel unrated has very little to offer. It's a ploy to sell more discs I feel and I'm glad I only borrowed it, otherwise my wallet would have felt pretty darn cheated.

Secondly, it's not that scary. In fact it's boring..... I was asleep faster than Lord of the Rings.

Third, very little gore....WHAT!?! This was supposed to be the goriest flick since Texas Chainsaw Massacre!

The film comes off as a shot at Takashi Miike, who's film ""Audition"" freaked the hell out of people in the infamous last fifteen minutes (hand raised I was scared too). The entire film drags out on a hiking trip to Amsterdam and comes off more like porn than actual horror movie, only a few cheap thrills add to the horror atmosphere. Nearly ninety minutes of boobs and sex later, we finally get to the gore. *MAJOR GROAN OF DISAPPOINTMENT*

I will warn you, SPOILERS AHEAD! But believe me, you'll have to agree at least some if you have watched it.

First off, KNB effects is the best in the business when you want the Rolls Royce of Gore. I mean they are the tops with Greg Nicotero, Protege of Tom Savini, helming the guts department. But sadly, their best work winds up in the garbage can here.

The ill-lit ""torture rooms"" make the gorey stuff impossible to see, especially that tendon slash scene which looked beautiful in the behind-the-scenes video. Here it was blackened out (WTF?) in the final cut. The scariest tendon slash I've seen and still freaks me out even in the daylight was the Gage Creed hide-under-the-bed-and slash-your-heel-with-a-scalpel from PET SEMETARY. That is one sequence I cannot watch. The other was the pencil-right-between-the-tendon-and-ankle bit from EVIL DEAD. That was scary, I covered my eyes.

Slash with a scalpel in an ill lit room with the obvious green light from Saw? No, I laughing. And I died a little inside because how great effects work was killed by shoddy lighting.

Worse was the autopsy sequence, you can clearly see the fake skin under the powerful light as it ""glow's"" because of the materials translucency (probably silicone or gelatine from what I understand).

Another sequence is where the guy's hiding under the bodies and the body parts are obvious jiggling like jello on the bumps, when they shouldn't as they are supposed to simulate something with bone and should flop. Probably halloween props at best, because KNB's stuff is pretty realistic.

And finally, the eyeball sequence. I felt sorry for that Asian chick that gets her face burned off and having to have her eyeball removed with a pair of scissors. Shame on you Eli, she was such a pretty gal too.

After seeing this film, I've would have done the same as she did: Jump in front of a train at how horrible this film was.

But the greatest travesty was how they invited Miike to appear as a Japanese Business man leaving the torture building near the end. A great director in a shoddy homage to himself? What was he thinking?

The only saving grace was the revenge sequences, which filled my wasted time with a few good chuckles at how I want to hit the people who made this with a car, much like the main did to the people who tricked into the hostel. Then I'll jump in front of that train.",1253491200,3,3207,4.644876325088339

Hostel is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a looooooooong time.  What I like about it is aside from an interesting plot, good acting, and all that jazz, it also presents the question: ""what is a life worth?""

YES I could see how the beginning of the film could be boring for some, but that's because you're supposed to pay attention to the symbolism.  The whore house in the beginning where women are being trafficked for sex is a parallel to the Hostel's business of trafficking people to be killed off.

1553603,4,B00005JOQB,"Eli Roth enjoys a good horror flick, he particularly enjoys many forgotten gems that were utterly intrusive to the mind (as pointed out heavily in the documentary included). Roth has established the Hostel series not as a continuation to his figures or previous works, but as a whole new side step in mainstream horror films. His name is now renown enough to be displayed alongside the higher budget theater films. This recognition brings in a whole new group of viewers less equiped for what they are about to see. Unsurprisingly this film is viewed as a bit too rough for the mainstream, and despised by  quite a few horror fans (who feel they've been duped calling it mindless).

Reassuringly stepping foot into the movie this way will lead to a bitter disliking of the film. Yes it is indeed sexual and gore torn. It is this ideal of dynamics between the two that help the movie groove along. Most films use attractive females and immensely muscular males to lure people in on an otherwise flop fest. Hostel makes use of the this by rendering the three main characters as epicurean males pursuing nothing but excess.

This type of lifestyle is supposedly welcomed at the European inns otherwise known as Hostels. All wishes granted for those who enter expecting some promiscuity, everything is perfect, except for what the Hostels secretly stand for (and intend to do with said occupants). Many reviewers have gone on to spoil the story, while I deter from the review I would just like to say I'm not a fan of spoiling films. I will not spoil this one either. I will say a particular Hostel the trio of men arrive at seems a bit dubious when examined with its surrounding and historical buildings.

Expect disturbing imagery if you think the Saw films are bad. Expect turning it off if you think gore festivities like the Halloween or Friday the Thirteenth remakes were roughing it.
No this film isn't a thinking mans horror for say, but the suspense and filming techniques sure do give a lot for a film people bash as 'mindless'. Film wise priorities are set, things happen for a reason not just some odd camera quirk, or guttural thinking.

Here's a quick synopsis of the film:
Three backpackers travel amongst Europe's night life. Seeking nothing but pleasure, while they enjoy it they find themselves quickly being disliked and sought more. When the more is no longer a variable but an establish place on their map they seek it with little questions asked. Aboard the train they go.

Exiting the train they find little of what was promised. The city didn't suggest parties it suggested poverty. They do indeed find their dot on the map, one promised was kept another lavish Hostel.

One of the three men is a bit older, and is quite the ladies man he always splits off. His departure only becomes more mysterious when look at the incentives. The other two are a bit more grounded one being the most cautious and the other a fun seeker who is also a pretty genuine person. This is where the movie shifts gears becoming more the horror it was intended to be (full of torture scenes). How is it torture scenes? Whats the motive? Watch the movie, again I don't wish to spoil.

Okay my quick run through is over and back to the critique now that everyone has a bit more of an insight. The film can definitely make someone squeamish. Usage of nearly anything a sick twisted mind could lay hands on is available as means of torture. Victims are left to whatever the the torturer is feeling like for the day. What sets this film apart is instead of constantly on the move to escape peril scenes are replaced with... Well close ups of torture, ones stuck in the chambers have no hope only mercy. These secretive locations are derelict rusted buildings where no one can hear you cry outside the walls.
Nearing the end we do get an adrenalin pumped escape attempt.

The movie is pretty short, viewing the sequel right after (if you enjoyed this to begin with) does justice to the lengthiness. If the movie applied itself right to you and atmospheric conditions are conditioned right this should haunt your mind for some time. The beginnings moderate pace leading up to the slaughterhouse terrorizing climax is friction heated launched and landing with an impact.",1249516800,4,4259,4.690763052208835
1553604,5,B00005JOQB,"Hostel (2005) by Eli Roth, is a giant curve-ball in that, most will
under-estimate what this DVD holds in store.

It resembles the spookiness of visit to Madame Tusseault's wax
museaum with life-like sculptures that are fascinating yet,
paradoxically, merely life-like reproductions.

The special effects are impeccably done, (albeit more often than
not, gratuitous and  on the low-budget side), the wide-screen very
appealing, the music adequate, the in-loco filming great, showing
the typically narrow European streets of small villages, thereby
relaying the fish-out-of-water element of these tourists from Cali.

From amputations, to chain saws, surgical scissor, to pistols,
blow-torchs and drills to electric saws it has it all,  filmed
skillfully for a total visual impact.

The extent of detail in the torture sequences, is astonishing,
perhaps with the input of trained officers ( a rubber ball in mouth
to keep quiet, leg and arm hand-cuffs, etc.)

The script is well written, in that it very gradually lures the
viewer from the initial euphoria of being on a trip, living out a
utopic hedonistic dream in Europe,  and then being put through
something totally unexpected.

Jay Hernandez plays to perfection the 25-year old college graduate
granting himself a reward  for a series of years studying hard
without a breather, by backpacking across Europe with a couple of
pals.

For the 3 Americans, something seems too good to be true, when all
their wildest fantasies come true at a series of hotels, first in
the red light district of Amsterdam, and then, in Bratislawa,
Slovakia, at the hostel itself  where he meets the lovely Barbara
Nedeljakova and others, then in a sauna, in a night-club, and more.

We later find out they are part of an underground international
business operation catering to those having a fetish for blood
letting, mayham, torture and murder.

Along the way, Rohypnol (""roofie"") or  GHB are intermixed with
candies, drinks to facilitate leading the victims into an abandoned
building in the outskirts of town, where even the locals are in on
it.

At the end, the movie reprises a bit the prison-break theme, as in
Escape from New York (1981), Papillon (1973) or  Midnight Express
(1978) with tension and suspense.

The final shots are especially powerful, as Hernandez's character
spares no effort to set things right.",1248998400,2,2355,5.1688654353562

1553607,5,B00005JOQB,"HOSTEL, like AUDITION, BROKEN, HIGH TENSION, etc., is best seen knowing nothing about it. Eli Roth has made a viciously tricky classic here. Unlike in his earlier CABIN FEVER, the main characters (Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) are likeable guys. They're unaware of the fact that their idea of fun- smoking as much pot, drinking as much alcohol, and nailing as many hot babes as humanly possible- is actually exploitive, and could even be dangerous. They are just young, hormonally explosive college kids, out for the experience of a lifetime. This is also their undoing, as they are oblivious to any hint of impending doom. Even after their buddy Oli disappears, they still return to the nightlfe and the two gals they've hooked up with. Hell has to literally open up in their faces before these guys realize they're in deep, deep trouble. HOSTEL is part horror / cautionary tale, part sadistic blast of jet-black humor, and part geo-political commentary. Roth builds the story slowly (they used to call this character development), revealing the true terror in one big switch, like waking up in a bloody nightmare, while suffering from the world's worst hangover! Yes, HOSTEL can be a gruesome, bleak affair, but it is probably not as gory or twisted as rumor has made it out to be. There is a certain morality buried under the bodies and viscera as well. That's another difference between HOSTEL and CABIN FEVER.

Unfortunately, the bottomless pit of the ""obscene superego"" - that the Hostel's torture chambers represent - is (mis)located in the country of Slovakia, instead of an affluent town of the suburban America. This is because, conveniently, there is an untapped reservoir of Soviet-style and Russian-style spooky *otherness* which could only be produce by locating this sadistic macabre in one of the Slavic country of the east instead of the affluent suburb of Denver or LA. And one can make films on a shoestring budget over there as a bonus. The *obscene superego*, *supreme Being-in-Evil* - something which is placed beyond the symbolic or imaginary order of America - is geographically in the former *eastern block*.

I can't connect to the first half of the film, which is mostly about regular foolish male behaviour while backpacking in central Europe. All of that becomes a long wait to see what awaits in the second half, and it provides very little buildup to what we'll eventually have to endure.

All of the violence in the film is harsh, personal and disturbing. It's not entertaining, but in a broader sense, pretty interesting. It makes you wonder about the world, and what dark places may exist where anything or anyone can be purchased for the right price.

This DVD contains some pretty good featurettes, and overall a really good set of extras, including one featurette which is almost entirely about the inspiration and reaction for the film, and how much of it is based in reality. Eli Roth is certainly an intelligent man, and he's out to tell a message, not only shock, but due to the harsh and stark nature of the film, it's hard to digest, and it's overall too uncomfortable to be really memorable.

Atmosphere is not a problem in the movie, but the gore-for-the-sake-of-gore element that drives the movie renders it unfulfilling as a viewing experience.  The ending is also somewhat silly.

1553683,2,B00005JOQB,"""Does Eli Roth know pain?""

Well, after viewing ""Hostel,"" I can assure you that Roth knows pain, he knows all about it. Somewhere in his vast collection of horror movies in his bedroom-- probably right around the nudie woman pictures,  Guns and Ammo Magazines, and a framed picture of his smiling and assured, self-portrait on the mantel above his bed--  there would be a DVD of his second film, ""Hostel."" Let me tell you-- this film is pain: in all its agonizing and slow, torturous glory, as if hell-bent on stupefying its audience. Yet, I still kinda like it... but it has made me dumber.

Two obnoxious Americans--perfecting the persona of the frat boy clich&eacute;-- must fight to survive torture at the hands of those damn ugly foreigners. That's pretty much all that needs to be said about plot-- the film, which is solely rooted in comedy, torture, and ti*s, is obviously not to heavy on the subtext-- yet, one still may see the film as depicting the current state of foreign views on pro-war America, as in the film, Americans fetch a high price when bought to torture and kill, and I don't think it's because they like us. Still, it would be interesting to see how the film went over in some European countries, as well.

You see, the film is silly, plain and simple: a sort of summery of all that is wrong in modern horror movies. Yet, it may go with the modern flow, and although it's rowing up s*it creek, and it may actually have a paddle, it's still s*it creek, nonetheless. Yet, again, it's still going somewhere. All these gray areas are present when speaking of ""Hostel's"" likeability.

Since, the characters don't develop much out of the roles of lambs to the slaughter-- but are slightly admirable if you like Roth's brand of ""Porky's"" like humor. Yet some may belive that the film fits into that modern term ""torture porn,"" but other than the fact that term is often idiotic-- how come violence in horror only gets a backlash, when other genre's/ directors (Michael Bay, anyone) are just as gratuitous-- the film is only to be taken semi-seriously, even when the horror kicks in. Still agonizing, yes. Yet, such as a scene in which a character decks himself out in armor to evade capture, it's obvious that it can't be all serious, can't it? I hope not!

Moreover, it's a wonder how Roth can make such biting--no matter how much of it may be accidental--social commentaries that tap into modern fears, so timely, but still can be such utter laugh fests. His first film was ""Cabin Fever,"" a film about a virus, that was released shortly after SARS broke out--and although Roth may seem little too cocksure in his films, and his films may never be nothing more than decent drunken midnight movies, there's still something oddly likeable here, even if it is mind numbing, obnoxious, and crass. That my reader, is what may have Roth's name stick out with the camp-satire of the Frank Henenlotter's (Basket Case, Brain Damage) in the horror film industry-- and that's not being shipwrecked in s*it creek, either.

1553732,5,B00005JOQB,this was a great performence a real bloody and gorey tortureing movie hostal part2 was dissapointing but this first one was great.,1209513600,,130,4.954545454545454
1553733,5,B00005JOQB,"As you can see by my title, I ran across quite a lot of complaints about this movie before I watched it. ""It had a bad plot,"" people said. ""It was porn for the first 40 minutes, and its transition into gore was really sudden."" ""The acting was bad,"" ""the directing was terrible"", ""the story sucked"", etc., etc.

When I watched it I was very pleasantly surprised to find that all these complaints were wrong. Sure, some of them were based on truths, but I think people distorted them simply because they didn't like the premise. Yes, the first 20-30 (NOT 40) minutes of the film had quite a lot of nudity in it, but it was by no means porn! And though I'm not a great fan of mindless sex, at least it wasn't pointless. The sex is what lured the main characters into the hostel in the first place. And the transition into the gore was not sudden, but quite easily handled--in fact, I'm surprised at the wonderful job that Eli Roth did at transforming the mood from light and flippant into dark and unfathomably disturbing.

The acting was by no means bad. Jay Hernandez, I believe, did a spectacular job as Paxton. It is fascinating to watch Paxton's character change from a carefree college student obsessed with sex and girls to a troubled man that delights in vengeance against his torturers. The other actors did their job well (though Derek Richardson as Josh, while mostly skillful, needed to work on his whimpering).

Now for the story. As you all should know, it's about three college-age men that backpack across Europe looking for sex, and they're recommended to a hostel, which turns out to be a place that people get tortured (seriously, the plot is better than I made it sound). Eli Roth didn't add many fancy or unexpected twists into his screenplay; you won't see the kind of surprise endings that the Saw franchise is famous for. But everything Eli Roth does have in here he made sense of. He uses very little unnecessary material, and he does a great job at subtle foreshadowing so that, in the end, everything makes sense. Please pay attention to the scene where Paxton tells Josh about a childhood memory of watching a girl die, because it foreshadows what would have otherwise been a really dumb (er, I mean Gryffindorish) moment in the script.

I also loved the fact that Eli Roth and the sound editors didn't splurge on the screams. In fact, when the screams get particularly loud, the editors actually turned them down and instead increased the other noises (such as the chainsaws or, most memorably, the snapping of sharp scissors). You can't know just how pleased I was that they didn't blast me from my seat with 100,000 decibels of pure sound.

I also loved the score, which moved away from the overly-creepy style of horror films and more towards the dramatic form. It suited the film better, because this film was really not scary. However, it was truly disturbing and horrific (hence the term ""horror film""). It is dumbfounding to witness this appalling display of human brutality and its marked effect on the characters (namely Paxton--he has an absolutely haunting terror in his eyes during the last half-hour of the movie). This brutality is made all the more effective by Roth's refusal to use the safer, less inciting ""cut-to-black"" techniques found in cheap horror films. No, he shows us everything. In great, bloody detail. And it is gross.

The trailer said the movie was based off true events. I'm guessing it probably meant the premise as opposed to the actual characters, but either way it's entirely believable. Humans are cruel creatures, and they go to insane lengths to continue in their destructive depravity. It was Roth's effectiveness in conveying this theme that made me give this movie a 5-star instead of a 4.

This movie is a must-see for horror fans, or for MATURE viewers. If you cannot see past the gore, you should probably not watch this movie. If you can, however, you need to watch this at least once (more, if you can stomach it), despite the side effects of a churned stomach and a severe jolting of the emotions and senses.",1208908800,2,4083,4.686192468619247
1553734,2,B00005JOQB,"I applaud this film for actually taking the time to establish the characters, which rarely happens in this type of genre. Usually, we get a brief glimpse of their lives before they are ultimately killed off one by one. However, I really wish it didn't waste 3/4 of the film with a boring plot.
If you love the torture/horror genre, then this will be a dissapointment for you. The true action doesn't beging until about 20 minutes from the end of the movie and by then you are already bored out of your mind. The torture scenes are quite brief actually and while effective, they are nothing truly gut wrenchingly grotesque or even flinching, especially if you are used to watching films like this. Any of the Saw films easily beat Hostel in the blood and gore department and they do it in a wicked and tortureous way. Hostel is not even remotely scary or chilling. There are no jumpy moments. There are no spooky or clever moments. For those who are not used to or dislike this genre, then perhaps this film may affect you. Otherwise, its a forgettable and overrated film.",1207699200,,1071,4.55440414507772
1553735,5,B00005JOQB,"overall, i feel like it has a pretty standard formula. the first half of the film is spent getting to know the characters. many party scenes scattered about with lots of gratuitous nudity. about 45 minutes in, the real ""meat"" of the film kicks in. i don't want to spoil too much in the overall story. there are very sinister things at work here, and you get bits and pieces of that throughout the movie.

basically its the story of three backpackers, and a trip they'll wish they would have never taken, if they can survive till the credits..

to most, this is no more than an exploitation film, but theres a lot more to it than that. its a film about exploitation. you see the main characters not only exploiting women throughout the first half of the film, but an entire nation, if not an entire continent. you see them exploiting the womens' bodies, laws of amsterdam, and the simple fact that they're americans. as time goes on, they become the exploited. they are now the exploited. imagination is the only limit on what can be done to them. for a price. [ironic.. although nothing can justify what happens to them]

the social commentary can probably be noticed by anyone other than a five year old. in our internet ruled, ebay enriched society, nearly anything we want can be obtained for a price. the movie also plays on many americans feelings of foreigners and vice versa.

theres a lot here past all the gore and nudity most people won't be able to realize, and thats fine. first, the camera work. in the opening scenes theres a lot of ambient camera runs with bright colors. as time goes on the color fads and the camera work has a much more frantic feel, perfectly complimenting the events onscreen.

Eli Roth hired an orchestra to perform a lot of the music for the film. there is a simple tri-note riff with a deliciously sinister vibe you hear it throughout the film on different instruments from time to time. a very epic score overall. i especially like the work in the later sequences-intense.

the voilence is extremely graphic, featuring some the most realistic and disturbing torture sequences you'll probably ever see.

for the faint of heart- do not watch this. you've been warned.

opening night-2 ambulances at the site. one woman left early and ended up passing out and falling on the ground. another woman thought she was having a heart attack and called 911. she wasn't really, but still. thats one crazy opening. this isn't for everyone.

this is a horror film in the truest form of the word. its disturbing and horrific. it will stay with you for days-if not weeks-after seeing it. anyone with a strong stomach and even a remote interest in horror should deffinitely check this out.

there's loads of great special features in this 2 disk director's cut. multiple commentaries, deleted scenes, alternate ending, 4 featurettes, interview with Takasha Miike, and more.",1205712000,16,2897,4.718811881188119
1553736,1,B00005JOQB,"I am not one to take moral stances, much less on movies. But in this case I am sorely tempted. Tarantino should have his head examined for supporting something as grotesque as this. That said, it does have some powerful imagery, once the barbarism begins (the first hour was just crap), and obviously it evoked a strong emotional response in me. But how hard is it to get an emotional response from scenes of graphic torture? (I felt the same about Tarantino's ear-slicing scene in Dogs, which was just exploitation cinema done up in new, postmodern rags). The film was disturbing, sure, but at a visceral rather than psychological level. Footage of animal experimentation would also be disturbing. Big deal.

What I admire about movies like Blue Velvet and Casualties of War (also M), and even Texas Chainsaw Massacre, is the way they get to the psychological roots of sadism, (by) creating empathy not just for the victims (easy enough, obviously), but for the perpetrators also. Tarantino seems devoid of empathy as a filmmaker. It's hard to imagine a greater defect (I think Kubrick suffered from it too, however, so I guess there are ways around it!). He delights in depicting scenes of pain and dismemberment with all the sadistic relish of a Goebbels.

They say a society gets the heroes it deserves. Tarantino's success strikes me as (like everything) symptomatic of just how ""depraved"" (removed from basic human qualities like compassion, introspection, kindness) audiences have become, that they would take pleasure in what amount to sadistic orgies of violence with no leavening ""moral"" (i.e. artistic) intent behind them.

1553740,5,B00005JOQB,"A movie with realistic gore. The movie is crticized for sadistic gore, but its unfair to judge the movie as a censor or non approver of the genre. To rate a movie you must first enjoy the genre. You see sick horror is not everyone's cup of tea and for the people who do enjoy it, it is not a reflection of a freak sadistic nature of theirs. Its just that such movies peek our human curiosities. Its just a dare thing. Can we stand through this sick blood fest. It's also to explore the sick depravity of human nature. The stuff that happens in HOSTEL is something that serial killers do. We have heard the sordid tales. I know its gross, such sort of this violence is out there somewhere in the world happening all the time even as you read this review. Such movies just tap into our curious voyeuristic tendencies to see to what extents evil intents can hurt and kill others. In that we are just trying to do a reality check and want to get offended and turn away from the sick gore but then again we turn back and complete the movie and only to test our limits. All the gore elements are present and the gore is very realistically portrayed. The plot of internet based business elite hunting where people with money can get the satisfaction of tortuing and killing other people for 50 grand also raises questions for me  -- ""Is is actually happening in some part of the world"". The movie does not have the fatalistic approach of ""Saw"", there can be some light at the end for atleast one of our characters. Also apart from the gore, you also got suspense till atleast half way through the movie where you are trying to make sense of why all this is happening and why this sick nonsense ...whats the purpose. That is part of the fun.

1553779,4,B00005JOQB,"I originaly saw Hostel in the theatre, and will admit that I am one of those who couldn't make it through to the end.  The level of gore and grossness that Eli Roth brought into this film was shocking, explicit and the most outrageous I had ever seen on screen.  Though there have been many films in the past that have done even worse, Hostel has a more realistic feel to it - and I felt I was actually in the film upon initial watch.  Scary thing.  After awhile, I decided to give it another try.  I am glad I did.  I missed out on a very satisfying ending, and more, realizing there is a film here beneath all the gore and blood.

The other thing that got on my nerve the first time I saw Hostel was the ongoing sex and nudity throughout the first 30 minutes of the film.  But, I realized the characters are college boys, and that's just what they do best.  Now whatever the message Roth was sending out with this film or what some people get out of it, I saw a simple message clear as day - trust no one - especially in a foreign country.  And if something is too good to be true, it usually is.  That's what happens with these young men.  And the fact that they are American makes it even worse - there are people that pay handsomely to see Americans suffer, and that's where the real guts (so to speak) of this movie lies.  Torture scenes are brutal and inventive, and will leave a mark (on the viewer too!).  After a few viewings, it seems mild now but still has a very scary element to it each time I watch.  I would have to say its Roth's use of the camera and lighting, and the dark setting where this takes place that makes it so creepy every time I watch.

This unrated director's cut contains two verison of the film - thank God.  The original, as seen in theatres, is fortunately there too.  The reason I say fortunately is because the alternate ending on the cut version was very dissapointing - and not satisfying at all like the original.  Fortunately, here you get both.  This dvd is still worth the buy to see the difference between the two endings.

I felt dirty and I took a shower - thats how I felt coming home from the theatre that night.  But its ok, its just a movie.  It still has its morals - good defeats evil in the end.  Give it a second try if you haven't yet, all that gore really blocks us from seeing a deeper picture at first.  If you have not seen this yet, watch with caution.

1553782,5,B00005JOQB,"This film (Hostel: Parts I and II) is not a horror film, it is a very thinly veiled political allegory on the essential symbiosis between capitalism and fascism. If it has a flaw, it is that it so pedantically maintains the allegory that some character's motivations strain credibility. Part I leaves the audience with stirrings of revolutionary sympathy. However, it also left the film maker open to claims of mysogyny. Part II is clearly an attempt to correct this impression, as well as neatly drawing the audience into complicity by having it root for the central character's eventual acceptance of ruling-class obligation.

The films might be more honest as documentaries based upon Naomi Klein's ""The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Distaster Capitalism"". The thin facade of fictionalism allows apologists and the dim to retain plausible deniability about its true nature, but this is the necessary price of getting it past the corporate censors and of gaining a wide audience.",1196467200,,979,5.1572327044025155
1553783,5,B00005JOQB,"I abhor the current trend of films that are labled ""horror"" films.  They are sadistic, in your face filming and editing, suspenseless, excessive gore replacing scares and desensitizing a viewer's reaction to violence.  These are the many reasons I avoided viewing HOSTEL.  After all, it seemed to be the film that started the trend.  Critics and the conservative crowd called it ""torture porn"".  I refused to give in to the tastes of the current movie-going crowd that spent their hard earned money on these abominations.  Give me Todd Browning's DRACULA, James Whale's FRANKENSTEIN, Don Siegel's INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, Jack Clayton's THE INNOCENTS, William Castle's HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, Roger Corman's THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM, Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH, Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING, Roman Polanski's ROSEMARY'S BABY, Any HAMMER STUDIOS/AMICUS STUDIOS film, etc........  ""Horror"" films used to mean a menacing atmosphere, shadow and light, an air of tension, characters that you cared about, taking time to slowly let the ""horror"" reveal itself, etc...... They left you feeling unsettled, not nauseous.  Granted, I love William Friedkin's THE EXORCIST, Tobe Hopper's THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, Richard Donner's THE OMEN, Brian DePalma's CARRIE, John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN, Dario Argento's SUSPERIA, Ridley Scott's ALIEN, Wes Craven's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET - All prime examples of how ""horror"" started changing in the 1970's.  The blood quotient had increased and the intensity level had risen several notches, but all the ""classic"" elements were still there.  The violent and gory parts were inherent to the stories and served the plots and characters.  The recent ""horror"" films of the past few years, in my opinion, were worthless and an insult to the intellect of the lovers of ""horror"" movies.

I accidentally came across HOSTEL on cable right when it was just beginning to roll it's opening credits.  I decided to give it a shot.  Especially since I might have remotely misjudged it and it may have a few redeeming qualities.  Right from the beginning, I didn't see any erractic jump cuts and ""attack your senses"" filming.  It took the time to let the viewer get to know the three lead male characters and to have fun with them and laugh with them.  Their sex and drug adventures were real, believable, daring and dangerous.  I thought the commaraderie between the three actors was great and playful.  And when they started to disappear into thin air I started getting scared.  Real scared.  And by the time they arrived at the warehouse of torture you are too involved to look away.

Eli Roth did an excellent job of pacing the film, building the unbearable suspense and cutting away during alot of the torture scenes and not lingering on gore effects.  (Yes, the eyeball scene was the most excessive, but it's always good to have that ""one scene"" that everyone talks about afterwards.)  But when the last student captured manages to escape and tries to flee the facility and decides to go back to rescue the girl - I could barely catch my breath and my nerves were wrecked!  And the final ""revenge"" scene was the perfect plotline to satisfy all of our ""primal survival"" needs.  Eli Roth took all the ""classic"" elements from the 50's and 60's horror films and combined them with the intensity of 70's horror films and mixed in contemporary, modern characters and dialogue.  The result:  A modern-day hommage to the Italian horror movies from the 60's where a group of travelers would happen upon a castle where the scientists/doctor who lived there would trap them and torment/torture them.  (Usually so he can ""borrow"" their eyes, skin, limbs, etc.... to graft to his horribly mangled daughter.  Who may or may not be alive.)

In other words, I horribly misjudged HOSTEL.  And deprived myself of experiencing it in the theatre.  I have since gone out and bought the Director's Cut dvd and I have to say that I liked the unrated version more and definitely the original ending, not the alternate ending supplied on the dvd.  Luckily, the unrated version that I had seen is also available on the Director's Cut edition with the original ending. Picture and sound are top-notch.  Special Features are great and informative.

HOSTEL is a contemporary masterpiece of horror/suspense filming and I loved every minute of it.  It totally satisfied my need for scares!",1194307200,3,4384,5.022160664819944

However, their ideal vacation soon turns into a nightmare of vicious terror as they are taken to a special secret place where criminals torture and kill people for profit, can they escape this living hell?

Exciting and violent horror crime thriller from writer-director Eli Roth (""Cabin Fever"") and producer Quentin Tarantino, the film is quite flawed such as the acting (you can overlook that) and some of the dialog. But there is some sleazy atmosphere and gory torture scenes to make up for those such as an icky eyeball torture sequence done to a Japanese tourist. The film does pay tribute to the torture films such ""Ichi The Killer"", ""Men Behind The Sun"", ""Guiena Pig"", ""Audition"", ""Mark of the Devil"", ""The New York Ripper"" and of course ""Bloodsucking Freaks"".

1553785,4,B00005JOQB,"Hostel is one of those movies that have sparked some huge debates. Some praise it as an instant classic and others deem nothing more than vile trash. Often referred to as torture porn, which is the silliest thing I have ever heard. Hostel is influenced by 70s exploitation movies. Right now Eli Roth is one of the most popular filmmakers. So when anybody gets as popular as Eli Roth has you know the backlash is coming.

Roth has been hailed the next great horror filmmaker and even by some the savior of the genre. Eli Roth is only one person; he cannot save or hurt the horror genre on his own. There are many talented filmmakers who go unnoticed or struggle for work. Eli is one of the talented filmmakers who is having a career that is taking off and is possibly the most popular horror filmmaker out there right now. And due to that it's made him a sitting duck to be ripped a part.

I respect everybody's opinion and I'm sure some people just don't like the work of Eli Roth and that's fine. The most loved of filmmakers will have people who dislike their work and the most hated of filmmakers will have people that like their work. But I do feel Eli Roth sometimes gets a little too much heat from fans and critics.

When it comes to a movie like Hostel it's not gonna be for every horror fan, but what I loved about Hostel is Roth, is going back to the old school style of filmmaking and is one of the guys bringing back the long forgotten Grindhouse type flicks. People seem to forget there were movies like Hostel over the years, these types of movies started in the 60s, but the 70s is where these flicks will be remembered. The difference is, they weren't mainstream. They were popular at the Drive-Ins, but Hostel gained mass appeal. And it's been so long in some ways movies like Hostel are new since these movies haven't been done in so long and a lot of the core auidnce probably never saw the flicks that inspired Hostel.

Over the last couple of years we have been stuck with lame PG-13 horror flicks and PC horror flicks. Eli Roth is a filmmaker that does his thing and doesn't let PC police sway him from getting his vision out. Right now in America the Liberal way of thinking is taking over. Sex and nudity is now a bad thing. Without sex none of us would even be here. Hostel has a lot of nudity and some sex scenes. Well since the 70s a lot of horror films have. Eli isn't the first person to use that in a horror film. Everything in this country has gotten so damn PC and sexually repressed.

The lead characters is Hostel are young, single and on vacation am I supposed to believe that there is nobody out there like these characters? I don't get the big deal with the sex and nudity all of that is a common part of life and again plenty of horror filmmakers and filmmakers of any genre for that matter have used this in their movie, but now suddenly it's a bad thing.

What I find rather funny is how many people bash the people who enjoyed Hostel as being sick and disturbed. I find that funny because many of these people also watch horror movies. What's the difference between what happens in Hostel and your run of the mill slasher movie? It's wrong to watch someone get tortured and killed, but ok to watch a slasher flick where people are hacked up? What's the difference? Murder is murder isn't it? Granted a movie like Hostel might be more extreme, but again murder is murder.

The screenplay by Eli Roth is very solid; his characters aren't faceless and as thin as the paper they were written on. The characters come across as real people. I've known people who are a lot like the lead characters in Hostel. For me, one of the most important things in a horror flick is how I relate to the characters or if I can see myself being friends with them if this were real life. Eli Roth again created real characters. I'm not really like any of the characters in Hostel, but they weren't bad people. They were having their last moments of freedom before the real word kicks in when they head back home.

The first on screen torture scene in Hostel doesn't come until the 40-minutue mark. Prior to that there are 2 deaths. One being off screen and the other as it begins there is a cut and we don't actually see anything, which makes the one we finally see a lot stronger. Unlike the slasher film, Eli Roth actually spends the first half of the movie developing the characters. In other horror movies the makers drop building up the characters and get right into the action and faceless characters.

A lot of the people who bash Hostel are so off base; Roth could have taken the easy way out and jumped right into the action and made a movie with nothing, but gore and violence through out. But again the guy takes the time and develops the characters. And when the action starts we have come to know the characters and feel for them. Hostel isn't violence just for the sake of it. Never once does Eli Roth glorify the torture and murder scenes. I have seen plenty of movies where the filmmakers do that.

As a director Eli Roth is showing a lot of promise. I don't wanna start a Cabin Fever/Hostel debate, but he really grew as a filmmaker in-between films. That's not to say Cabin Fever was bad. It was an enjoyable flick, but you can see how Roth grew as a filmmaker. The first half of Hostel was well done with the set up and the 2nd half has some great suspenseful and tension filled moments. The scene when Paxton is about to be tortured was classic.

The whole 2nd half of Hostel was excellent; the comedy is toned down, which is a good thing. When it comes time to build suspense I hate when filmmakers have to throw in comedic moments. Often it's a tension breaker, but Roth pulls no punches and goes straight for the tension. While there is a scene or two with comedy the way it's done really adds to the movie. When you break it down there is a lot more to Hostel than people realize. The characters are well developed and there is some solid suspense in the 2nd half.

People say Hostel isn't scary so it sucks. Unlike other type of horror films, movies like Hostel don't rely in the traditional way of scaring people. Picture yourself in another country, your friends disappear you are a stranger here, you can't' trust anyone. Or if anything picture yourself in another state. The scares aren't the typical boogeyman hiding in the shadows scare. The chance of something like Hostel actually happening is a good chance compared to the never ending run of slasher movies, which are pure fantasy.

The acting was also quite solid; normally these types of movies feature weak acting, but Hostel had a solid cast and Jay Hernandez does a fantastic job at carrying the movie. His performance was real, he wasn't an actor he was the character of Paxton. The rest of the cast is solid, but Jay was the stand-out. Rick Hoffman though nearly steals the show in his brief scene.

In closing, Hostel is a solid movie that is getting way too much heat. It's only a movie people. Eli Roth showed some great promise here and Hostel is one of the finest horror movies of the decade. I'll admit upon my first viewing I didn't quite like Hostel, but going back and watching it I realized how much more there was to Hostel than I first thought.",1193616000,3,7268,4.394052044609666
1553786,5,B00005JOQB,"The first time you watch ""Hostel"" you leave remembering two things: an insane amount of sex and nudity, and some truly brutal torture sequences.  The media ignoranty dubbed it a new genre, ""torture porn"".  This film is actually rather tame when compared to some of Italy's 70's horror, grindhouse flicks like ""Cannibal Holocaust"", and some of Asia's current horror masters.  Nontheless, horror fans drooled, sqeamish movie-goers and media watchdogs were offended, then everybody moved on.  The truth is this: ""Hostel"" is the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" of our generation.  After taking this so-called ""director's cut"" re-release as an opportunity to revisit a recent horror film I remembered fondly -if mostly for the two reasons stated above- I came to realize why so many people (not the least of which is Quentin Tarantino) believe in Eli Roth as a horror savior.

""Hostel"" is a film layered with subtle humor that builds suspense beautifully and gives the audience exactly what they want to see while making them feel as though they've seen worse things than they actually have; all TCM hallmarks.  The characters, obnoxiously American protagonists and European antagonists alike, are all both likeable, depraved, and almost feel like people you may know or have met somewhere before.  You laugh with them, you scream with them, and you wonder what your own friends and family are truly capable of.  Also reminiscent of TCM is the slaughterhouse feel one gets from the entire process of this torture industry where angry Europeans can take out their frustration with Americans and other tourists for a fee, thus comparing the suffering of the victims to that of animals harvested for slaughter. Be it simply for irony's sake, vegetarian propaganda, or both; it is nicely done.  Had I reviewed this flick after one veiwing, I'd have given it 4 stars, tops, but having spent a little more time with ""Hostel"", I've found that there really is much more than meets the eye here.  It really is a damn near flawless horror film with lots of little jokes I missed the first time around (keychain anybody?) and a final act that is so delightfully insane you can't help but smile as Roth intentionally pushes the limits of implausibility to comical levels while giving the audience bloody satisfaction. I love it.

While these DVD's are packed with extras that the studio apparently wouldn't allow Roth to include in the intitial release, as a director's cut this release fails miserably. The film itself is entirely unchanged except for an alternate ending.  And that ending is awful, nonsensical, confounding, out of character, and pretty much inferior to the original cut in every possible way.  So why the 5 stars?  Because Roth was wise enough to include both versions so that you can choose to watch the original unrated version with the good ending intact.  No harm, no foul.  There are no less than four commentaries, tons of lengthy featurettes, around 20 minutes of deleted scenes, and an interview with the most hardcore director in the business, Japan's twisted and talented Takashi Miike (who has a cameo in the film) among other extras.  Many of these special features were on the first DVD so this release is really only for those who have put off buying this movie. And if you haven't yet, now is the time.",1193529600,70,3314,4.951263537906137
1553787,3,B00005JOQB,"Jay Hernandez (Paxton), Derek Richardson (Josh), and Eythor Gudjonsson (Oli) star as three young college students backpacking across Europe.  But their trip is about to take a turn for the worse.

Paxton and Josh are from the United States.  While on their trip in Europe, they met and befriended Oli, who has now become part of the group.  Their mission: to do as many drugs and have sex with as many women as possible.  They have also met another person, who tells them about a town in Slovakia, where the women will do practically anything with a man who has an American accent.  Eager to find out, the three board a train and head for Slovakia.  While on the train, the three meet an extremely odd gentleman, who we will see more of later in the film.

Once they reach their deatination, Paxton, Josh, and Oli check into a Hostel.  Sure enough, the man was right; the guys end up sharing a room with two gorgeous women, and the sex and drugs begin to flow.

However, strange things begin to happen.  Oli suddenly checks out of the hostel without telling Josh or Paxton.  Then, a few days later, Josh does the same thing, only he finds himself in a torture chamber along with the man from the train.  This deranged man is doing unspeakable things to Josh, including slicing his hamstrings.  Meanwhile, Paxton is beginning to become suspicious of the two girls.  The girls tell him that his two friends have been taken to a local art museum.  Angered, Paxton tells the girls he wants to go there as well.  So, the girls oblige, and Paxton is forced into the same cruel situation as Josh and Oli were.  But, unlike his friends, Paxton manages to survive, despite having several fingers cut off.

Paxton is able to discover that the ""art museum"" is really some kind of sick place where people can pay money to kill another person.  It costs the most money for someone to have the chance to kill an American; hence, the attraction between the girls and Paxton and Josh.  Will Paxton be able to survive to tell his story, or will he be caught in the end?

I've seen a lot of horror movies, but this has to be one of the most bloody and gory I've ever seen.  I've seen all of the ""Saw"" series of films, and I think that this movie is even more bloody than those.  The first part of the movie has very little killing, but the second half more than makes up for it.  There are several gross scenes, including the slicing of the hamstrings, the cutting of eyeballs, and the use of a drill and chainsaw.  This is definitely not a movie for the squeamish.

I thought this was an ok movie, but not a great one.  The large amount of blood and gore were just too much to handle.  True fans of bloody movies will probably enjoy this movie more, but be warned; the amount of blood and gore in this movie is tremendous.  Watch at your own risk.",1193356800,,2830,4.3865384615384615
1553788,5,B00005JOQB,"From its inception, American horror has always had its roots firmly planted in foreign soil.  Silent German expressionistic chillers led the way for Universal Pictures' cinematic monsters of the 1930s, (Frankenstein, Dracula, the Werewolf of London, the Phantom of the Opera, the Hunchback, the gypsy werewolf that bites Larry Talbot, the Mummy) all of which were foreign born and reinforced the xenophobic and isolationist beliefs of Americans at the time.  The 1940s ushered in a wave of true-life European nightmares as American moviegoers viewed grainy newsreel footage of nazi concentration camps.  We collectively wondered, ""How could a civilized society perpetrate such crimes against humanity?""  In the holocaust documentary film SHOAH we get the answer when a Polish villager of Treblinka was asked about the atrocities committed in the camps, he crudely conveys the notion that the victims are not worthy of contemplation because they are not us.  They are Jews.  Strangers.

Eli Roth's HOSTEL successfully exploits this formula and creates a horrorscape of a post-Soviet satellite country that's more terrifying than any cardboard Transylvanian graveyard.  Roth exposes the true nature of fear: to be a helpless stranger in a strange and dangerous land at the mercy of people who will only view you as ""the other.""  This is the true power of this film, a force that will wreck havoc on your subconscious --- not a man tied to a chair.",1192752000,3,1445,5.220779220779221
1553831,5,B00005JOQB,"This film is one of the goriest horror films I've ever seen.  No other film has made me feel as uncomfortable and wince like I have in Hostel.  Maybe I'm inexperienced in watching modern horror films, but I've always thought that I had a thick skin and strong stomach.

The film starts off with three friends traveling Europe for some fun.  They are having the time of their lives with drugs, alcohol, girls and just acting like fools.  When in Holland, they meet a guy who tells them about a place in Slovakia that is brimming with attractive women who go nuts over American men.  They follow this guy's advice and travel to a Hostel in Slovakia only to later make a frightening discovery.  There is an underground organization that pays money to people who can get others to come to an abandoned factory where they are brutally tortured to death.

All of the torture scenes are very unsettling.  Granted that the trio of main characters in the film where acting like jerks in the beginning, we still start to have compassion for them.  Regardless of what they did or how they acted, no one deserves to be tortured like that.  For me, the most unsettling scene was the part where the woman's eye was hanging by its optic nerve and was severed.  The cut achilles tendon scene comes a close second.  Even sitting here writting this review and thinking of those parts gives me an uneasy feeling.

Jay Hernandez gave a brilliant performance.  I'm looking forward to watching Hostel part 2.",1191888000,,1486,4.6183206106870225
1553832,1,B00005JOQB,"Just a warning - bad acting, terrible pacing, dreadful script. This is a train wreck of a movie. The incompetence shown by the entire cast, crew, and producers is the only truly horrifying thing here. And there really should be consequences to contributing such a pile of dung to existence. By the time you understand why everything is happening, there is little chance you care. Yes, there are some gory parts, but it is scary? NO! Something has to be believable to be scary.",1191369600,,476,4.678571428571429
1553833,1,B00005JOQB,"There are controversial movies that live up to the promise of being something unique, something different, something that captivates an audience that while revolting them or surprising them it still becomes a movie that you can recommend to others. This is not one of them.

The film tells the story of two American friends, Paxton and Josh, who are backpacking their way across Europe. Picking up a Scandinavian friend, they move from hostel to hostel (popular youth hotels that are fairly inexpensive) seeing the sights and doing everything in their power to bed as many European beauties as possible.

While out on the town one night seeking women, a local tells them of a hostel in a nearby country that caters to American's seeking action. He leads them to believe that once their accents are known, women will be basically tossing themselves at the two. Off they go in search of naked European women.

Arriving at the hostel they discover they must share a room. It turns out their roommates are two voluptuous women who begin the day by changing while the boys enter the room. Hitting the town, the next morning they find their Scandinavian friend gone, leaving with no message. The next night, both are on the town with the two girls (who each has bedded) when they begin to get dizzy. While Paxton passes out locked up in the local bar's stock room, Josh wakes to find himself chained to a chair in the dingiest of basement cells.

Thus the promise tales of HOSTEL begins to unfold, where we find that it has all been a set up luring young men and women to this country where lawlessness runs rampant. So much so that for the right price, you can actually kill and torture someone. Which is what happens to Josh. Slices, dices, ankles cut to prevent running away, gouges and more are in store for anyone who is taken to this den of depravity.

So much for Josh. Paxton wakes to find his friend now missing. Searching high and low, he too is captured only to escape. But in true heroic fashion, he must attempt to save his friend as well as the young Japanese girl the two met in the hostel.

This movie yearns to churn the strongest of stomachs. The effects are realistic but not to the point of causing any realist to think they actually performed these gory acts. While these scenes are not numerous enough to satiate the most deeply disturbed gore hounds, they are enough to cause a bit of nausea in the normal filmgoer.

What is truly disturbing about this film is less what is seen on the screen as considering those sitting and watching it. While the film attempts to show how depraved a society we have become where we can find amusement and entertainment in the death and destruction of a human being, it in itself does just that, attempting to entertain us with scenes of torture and bloodshed.

Interviews with director Eli Roth (CABIN FEVER) have stated that he found the idea from a web site he heard about on the internet. And he wanted to make people feel disgusted with what they saw, make them realize how terrible people could be, how low they cold sink. He does this in spades. But at the same time, he caters not only to the morbidly curious but the blood loving sadists as well. In showing us the worst he can dream up with people interested in killing someone for entertainment, he does the same by making each viewer a part of the same group.

Subsequent interviews with Roth have heard him talk about how the fault of both HOSTEL films lies not with the director or manufacturer of the film but in audiences who just don't get it. This is always a good argument when someone's movies aren't well received (the 2nd fell flat at the box office). Have I missed the boat when Hollywood hails films like this as artistic? Give me entertainment over artistic any day.

This film may be interesting to some, and certainly if you are one who feels the need to see controversial films to discover what the hubbub is all about (unfortunately I include myself in this group), you will be satisfied. But for most it will be a reviling experience that leaves you feeling the need for a good hot shower.",1191283200,,4121,4.556756756756757
1553834,1,B00005JOQB,"A novel- if far-fethced- idea for a film based on murder tourism is ruined by such a poor execution.  In its 95 minutes, Eli Roth manages to change genre three times: from soft-core skuzz, to gore, then to action, and all are particular unsatsifying.  But most of all, it just wasn't scary.

First off, the main characters are simply too unlikeable for us to care about them.  In the first scene- which takes up 30-35 minutes of the 95 minute run time- our protagonists immediately loose any sympathy they might have with the audience by acting in an incredibly loutish manner in search of booze and women.  This first scene is simply pointless: the soft-core porn contributes nothing to the plot and is there simply to allow people who don't have the guts to buy porn to watch porn.  Although Roth is trying to condemn the vulgar, loutish American- in- Europe stereotype, this opening scene is ultimately appealing to the kind of person Roth seeks to satirize and condemn.

Upon arriving in Slovakia- on a true good to be true account of shagging by the bucket-load- they continue their antics. And by this time I'm hoping that they suffer at the hands to these sadists who will save the world from these douchebags.  Of course, the suspcicious departure of the Icelander and a native wearing his jacket doesn't raise too much suspicion, and our heros keep on partying.  Whatever...

And now to the snuff part of the film.  So overdone and so fake, it just  didn't raise any scares.  A horror film which isn't scary is a unique if ultimately flawed idea.  But this time we are too bored to care what happens as the least likeable character escapes with a victim- typical Asian cliche, the only one about whom we have any sympathy- on their way out of the hell hole.

In all, the first 30 minutes of porn are pointless and it doesn't get any better.",1190678400,,1849,4.594512195121951

Yes there are some horrible moments but after a while you become immune to the blood and guts and really don't care about the characters. Hitchcock showed us more than fifty years ago that if you want to be frightened don't show the viewer whats behind the door. This gets a few marks purely on a gore level but for most of the time its a remarkably souless venture.

The basic premise of the film is that there are rich people in eastern europe who pay for the pleasure of torturing people. The victims are lured by sex and thats it really. You get the inevitable soft-core for the lads and not much else. If you see it once you probably won't ever want to see it again.

1553840,5,B00005JOQB,"When I first saw this film I took for what it was, a horror film nothing more and nothing less. The plot seems original to a certain point. There's an elite group of people who pay into an organized crime syndicate that kidnaps young tourists for torture. The elite members of the group pay to torture these hapless victims to death. The costs of this form of sadistic entertainment depends on the nationality of the victims. Americans cost more as it is probably more difficult to kidnap them without the authorities noticing. That's the plot basically and the rest is basically what amounts to a snuff film. However the premise could make for an interesting tv series, on premium cable of course. I found the film enjoyable not just because of the gore (there's a dandling eyeball gag in here) but because of the idea of an organization like the one protrayed actually existing. It's not that farfetched considering what's going on in the world now. Anyway the film wasn't as gory as say a Fulci or Argento film. Most Italian horror films show the same amount of gore in 10 minutes of the film where Hostel showed in over 124 minutes.

1553922,5,B00005JOQB,"Many people I think watch this movie and expect it to be just a no brainer of a slasher flick.  The true meaning I got out of this film was that it was actually a very good script that surrounded the ideals of International travel and hopeless circumstances.  This is a film that takes its time and does not just douse the viewer with blood and severed body parts for two hours.  There is a great twist in it towards the end...two actually, that really help sell the mystique.  There are a lot of different things going on but they are all told in a manner in which they fit nicely into the plot, and all the loose ends come together for a finality that is a justice of sorts which happens in the bathroom of a train station.  You will follow a survivor of peril as he goes from country traveler to hero and eventually you will find him at the end, on the path of redemption.  I have never been a big fan of Tarantino movies and this one does have some of his style, but in fact I think this script is excellent and I would like to see Tarantino try another hand at this type of film perhaps in the future.  Despite a vague DVD cover, do not think that this film is a couple of hours of people being chopped up for dinner in a dank cell, there is so much here than meets the eye...no pun intended!  The film is about a group of young males who are traveling around other places of the world, backpacking college student types.  They soon are led with some advice, to a Slovakian city that is very isolated but full of beautiful young women and pesky elementary school age children in a gang.  Soon bad things start happening and one of the backpackers realizes that his vacation of fun has turned into a nightmare.  Beyond the walls something is going on that is far more sinister than anything that could be imagined, and with a capitalist structure within that very horror, the lone backpacker soon finds himself fighting for more than just his life.  Directing is a cut above the norm and I give it five stars without hesitation.

1553924,1,B00005JOQB,"I remember hearing that this movie was so scary and disturbing from a friend of mine.  That it is one of the first real creepy movies of the 21st century.  I am here to tell you that this is the one of the dumbest and low grade movies I have seen in a long time.  As a matter of fact I was laughing out loud at how stupid it was. I honestly don't care if Quentin Tarantino's name is attached to this movie ""Hostel"" was awful and dreadful.  Now the R rating has its merit, there is plenty of gore, language and nudity.  Nevertheless, this made the movie even more hysterical than it already was.  Plenty of dummies, fake body parts, dummies, over the top violence for shock value only, dummies and lame dialogue had my friend (different from the one who said this movie was great) and me rewinding parts saying ""Please I have got to see that again, but I need to pay the water bill first""!

Also I love the picture of Europe this movie portrayed: get high all day, all European women are drop dead gorgeous and want to have sex 24/7.  Also when in Europe, it is okay to have problems and/or frustrations, be obnoxious and state things better work in your favor because you are an American.

This movie tried so hard to be scary and creepy.  I suppose there is an element of the ""hidden"" plot that was creepy.  However, a very slow opening forty minutes, lead characters that I could really take or leave (Jay Hernandez was real vexing in this movie) and unbelievable circumstances made this film a real lemon.  This also killed any element of creepiness that might have been a threat. Also the movie tried to wrap everything up in twenty seconds at the end, which was really weak.

One of the features on the DVD is a ""Making of Hostel"" documentary.  I found this really enjoyable how the film makers are so proud of this so called masterpiece they made.  You wondered what went wrong between the documentary and the finished product.  I guess this movie was considered so great because most horror movies made today are rated PG-13.  This movie is rated R, so this allows a great deal of more gore and violence, which of course makes a great horror movie.  However, this movie plays more like a comedy than a horror movie, did I mention the dummies.  I found this movie entertaining, but for all of the wrong reasons.",1184544000,2,2317,4.422169811320755
1553925,3,B00005JOQB,"Hostel is about three young men; Americans Paxton and Josh and their Icelandic friend Oli, who travel to Amsterdam in search of drugs and hookers.  In the long run they take their party to a quasi-Slovakia.  Oli goes missing and so does some Japanese girl.  No big deal right? So Paxton and Josh decide to party with some Russian girls and get a little bit too hammered.  So much so that Paxton ends up passing out in a storage room.  Josh wakes up in a dungeon and some Dutch guy starts to torture him, using a power drill and cutting his Achilles tendons.  By the time Paxton gets back to the hostel, everyone is missing, well almost everyone.  Josh finds those Russian girls again and starts pressing them for answers.  He ends up finding an abandoned warehouse where people pay to torture prisoners and he gets snatched up and tortured himself.  I'll stop there as things unfold in a fairly fun, albeit predictable manner.

If that kind of story interests you and you're the kind of person that likes to watch excruciating torture scenes, then Hostel is the film for you.  But don't worry, it doesn't desensitize because Hostel's director is so amateur in handling his actors you will not see Josh, Paxton, Oli and their international congregation of half-nude nymphs as real people.  They are like dolls and the fake setting is their dollhouse.  You see, the Slovakia we see in Hostel is not real.  That's right Eli Roth has said ""Americans do not even know that this country exists. My film is not a geographical work but aims to show Americans' ignorance of the world around them.""  You've got to be kidding me?  Isn't he just as ignorant as his audience?  And why isn't his audience offended by these comments anyway?  With comments like that it makes me wonder, is Hostel not supposed to be convincing?  I'm not supposed to take this movie seriously?  What is the point then?  Anyway, Roth has yet to show that he can make a movie with real acting and a convincing screenplay.  So far, that places Hostel squarely in the great tradition of crappy slasher movies.  Roth is not John Carpenter.  He is not even Steve Miner.  He is simply a guy who capitalizes on a young blood thirsty audience that wants to test itself.

I feel like I really just ripped into Hostel.  Something about it bothered me deeply.  On the other hand, something about it also impressed me.  I was provoked in two different directions.  The accuracy and compelling elements that I all too often take for granted in films I think are quality, were absent in Hostel, but that doesn't mean that Hostel isn't a unique and terrifying experience.  I cringed more here than in many films.  I thought Takashi Miike's Audition (Miike makes a brief cameo here, kudos to Roth for respecting his influence) was a classic in the horror genre and had Hostel been any bit as compelling as Audition was, it would've gained great praise from this viewer.

There is something hopeless about Roth's films.  Like many good horror filmmakers, Roth will not turn away and will dispatch of a traditional hero-type in a gruesome way without even thinking twice.  No one is safe in a Roth film and his unflinching murders scenes are as intense as any, and they work.  Some people critically call his films ""torture porn"" and I'm not so sure I disagree with that label.  Then again as a deterrent, I'm not so sure that is such disparaging classification in terms of horror films either.  Hostel and Hostel II made $105 million worldwide combined, and together they cost about one tenth that amount. ""Torture porn"" sounds like a market brand more than a criticism.  But that does not make Hostel a great movie.",1184198400,15,3664,4.656786271450858

1554009,3,B00005JOQB,"It's certainly interesting how some movies are advertised and presented.  When I bought this DVD on the front cover of it was written ""the scariest American movie in a decade"", on the back cover there was an introduction to the plot, in which it was claimed that 3 young men are lured into a trap in ""Slovakia"" by beautiful women.  Being an avid thriller fan I quickely opted for this movie.

This one was written and directed by Eli Roth, who also, as I found out did ""Cabin Fever"" (a horror flick), this then only being his 2nd movie.

As far as I was concerned, the first half of the movie was good, typical and promising.  Here you have perhaps a more serious version of something like ""Euro Trip"", meaning 3 horny Americans are traveling through Europe, searching for cheap sex, and drugs.  Actually, its 2 Americans that on their way through Europe meet Oli, who happens to be from Iceland (if I remember it correctly).  Knowning that there is absolutely nothing going on in a place like Iceland, Oli gladly joins our American Duo of horny boys, who plan to get laid as often as possible.

While they continue their nihilistic journey of debauchery, they meet a rather strange middle aged man, with a german accent, on one of their train rides, while talking to them he tells them that there is this Hostel in Slovakia, where they have absolutely beautiful girls that are just crayz and willing to do anything for foreigners, especially if they are American.  Well, needless to say, the horney gang dosen't need any further encouragments, and the next thing you see is them heading for the town where the hostel is.  It is only here that the movie starts to change its mood, it becoming dark and there is a sense of impending danger which is conveyed briefly to the viewers.  It is also here, where the movie started to lose some of its appeal.  The torture scenes were really gory and heavy, at least for someone like me, who dosen't preferr the horror genre.  Sure, someone who is totally into it, can claim that they were mild, ect.  But, for me, they were quite disturbing, yet far more disturbing is the fact that according to the makers of the film, they were supposed to be based on real life events.  Maybe its just me, but I for one, have my doubts about them, if only because I refuse to believe that people could be so cruel and inhuman to others.

Well, in the end, this was alright, if you want to see a horror movie, that starts off during the first half, more like an adventure type of a film, that has a bit of road movie characteristics to it.",1181433600,2,2566,4.462526766595289

All the humor is of the unintentional variety.  One character explains his friend's apparent sudden departure simply by saying: ""We're not in America dude... that's just how they do things here.""  In another scene we see two of the friends silhouettes bumping knuckles in a celebratory fashion while being 'entertained' by a single prostitute.  Such yo-dude frat boy dialog and antics aside, there aren't many moments of this cheesy popcorn flick that qualify as funny and not deplorable.  The fright aspect is non-existent altogether.  The characterizations don't work: neither creating main characters we can (or want to) relate to, nor effectively mocking the stereotype as the director plainly intended... the ignorant Americans making fools of themselves in foreign countries.  The best I can say is that blood and gore are quite plentiful and there is plenty of teenage-fantasy style nudity (mostly topless women) and sex (latently homoerotic?), but there is still nothing novel or unique to any of it.  Director Eli Roth doesn't seem to have the intellectual depth required to succeed at either horror or satire.  How such poorly conceived movie ideas get awarded with huge budgets I'll never know.

1554014,1,B00005JOQB,"This film begins promisingly, with two naive American guys and their Icelandic friend backpacking through Europe, searching for cheap drugs and hot chicks. Then they meet a Slavic sex hound (Alexis) who promises them hot, gorgeous, free women who are sex starved in Slovenia and just waiting for them. Of course, like most horny young guys, they follow this advice and go to the dead end town where they do indeed find absolutely gorgeous (and thankfully, often topless) Slovenian chickies who seem to drop their pants for any man who happens to be foreign. Cut to the chase, Iceland dude disappears and the Yanks start to become suspicious (but not enough to up and leave right away). This, of course, leads to them being kidnapped and sold into a sadistic torture fetish underground warehouse where only one of them comes out alive. I know that this sounds quite exciting (as it did to me when I had read the cover of the film) but the actual film is rather slow moving and leaves too many unanswered questions. The lighting is very dark so you actually see very little (sometimes thankfully) inside the torture chambers. Pretty pathetic horror film, in my opinion.

Join friends Paxton and Josh as they travel through Europe, and join up with fellow traveler Oli, an Icelander with a thirst for action.

Much in the tradition of classic films such as Eurotrip, Hostel shows young people looking for excitement and romance as they tromp through Paris, Belgium, Amsterdam, and beyond.  Their adventures take them to a mysterious hostel in Bratislava, Slovakia - a city known for its friendly people - where they discover a secret, underground club that is members only.

Oli and Josh wind up getting involved with some of this elite club's members and wind up deciding to spend the rest of their lives in Bratislava, but Paxton, turned off by the exclusivity and backstabbing nature of the club's members, decides to take off for more adventure.  He leaves Bratislava with a one-eyed girl that he meets, though they part ways in a touching scene at the train station.",1176940800,5,1062,4.845303867403315

The bloody parts don't show up until the second half of the movie, and even then much, if not most, of the horror is in our heads rather than on screen.  Roth wisely lets us imagine what is happening, rather than showing us, while we get to hear it.  As most good horror directors understand, the stuff we can imagine in our heads is at least as scary as what is on the screen.

In one of the commentaries, Tarantino notes that Hostel is like a 70s film instead of a big modern Hollywood movie, because 10 minutes into it you don't already know what the ending is going to be.  I definitely agree.  This extends even to which of the friends is going to be the hero of this movie.  You actually go from kind of hoping they're all going to die, because they're doofuses and jerks at the beginning, to actually liking them.  If you like commentaries, there are 4 of them, and they'll keep you busy for a while.

Hostel doesn't have a lot of moments of comedy, but there is some comic gold in there, which is what you would expect from the director of ""Cabin Fever.""

I couldn't understand the killers either -- no attempt was made to explain them beyond one or two scenes.

1554085,2,B00005JOQB,"After watching this film I decided to be scientific and use the process of elimination to determine how someone might have been able to appreciate it since I hadn't.  Aesthetics is, after all, a subjective experience, so a little objective rigor brought to bear on enjoyable experiences others might have had watching this movie should theoretically enable me to expand my own repertoire of aesthetic responses.

The first way one could not have found enjoyment watching this film is by being seduced by the exotic locales.  Yes, there was a pan that lasted for about a minute of a pretty Czech village, but otherwise the Newtonian law of cinematics has once again been confirmed, and here's the proof:  In the Bollywood movie, Humtum, a scene that was meant to occur in Paris was filmed on the Museumplein in Amsterdam; so the equal and opposite gaffe was bound to be committed somewhere.  In Hostel, scenes meant to occur in Amsterdam have been filmed (jarringly) in Prague.  And just like they did with the Americans in Borat, I can imagine (in the cynical frame of mind this movie put me in) the filmmakers telling European colleagues and extras, ""Don't worry, it doesn't matter - we'll never show this in your country."" Well, it eventually mattered to the fratboy who wanted to bring slavery back, and it should have mattered to the filmmakers. QED.

After also eliminating direction, script, and acting as potential means for appreciating this movie I started to worry.  Yes, much thought had obviously gone into making this thing; but the Dusk-To-Dawn pleasure/pain structure and obscure references didn't mesh well with the low-budget sinister spin on European Vacation.  Worse, the unfortunate juxtaposition of beautiful naked flesh and extreme torture in this film exerts a pernicious influence on the psyche of the viewer - surely that couldn't have been intended.  And then, like being shot by a diamond bullet right through my forehead, it became clear that I'd completely missed the point.  This is a message film, and I'd been stupid not to pick up on the movie's lofty ambitions.

The next challenge was to decipher the message, and I tell you this is the part that took the most time.  At first I suspected a sort of buried agenda to keep Americans from traveling outside their country.  The lesson seemed so clear that sublimely beautiful European temptresses want our dollars, but they will 1) mock us at every opportunity for not being cool in an effeminate, European way, 2) shield their true intentions by brazenly conspiring against us to our face in their unfamiliar native tongues, 3) have an almost psychic rapport with thuggish male fellow-countrymen who intend to punish us for having both the motive (wanting to have sex with beautiful girls) and opportunity (lots of aforesaid dollars and girls with loose morals) to steal their women, 4) ultimately sell us over to be tortured because they'll do anything for money (those loose morals again), and 5) succeed in their nefarious plan because the rule of law ends at the US border.

But this interpretation sounded paranoid when I played it back, and I suspected the ultra-violence of the movie had once again influenced my state of mind.  What if this do-not-leave-the-US message was really the unintentional result of some other process at work in the filmmakers' master plan?  So I started listening to the commentary track for more insight, but it was really irritating and I couldn't listen to the whole thing.  They've apparently re-coined the expression, `bully', which must be a sort of Teddy Roosevelt macho thing.

Their country's recent actions around the world have made many Americans feel self-conscious and unloved abroad.  It's unrealistic to think all the issues caused by this will be resolved so soon after the trauma.  Americans have a very pronounced sense of national identity, and we should expect some confused, troubled people doing things that might not make immediate sense while they work things out for themselves.

Also; paying women for sex has a long history, and I wouldn't think to question its place in society.  However, like all those things we're taught from childhood are wrong, paying for sex sets off a complex chain reaction of deep, conflicting emotions.  It's not always pretty to see these emotions being worked through, and unintentionally choosing film as the medium to do this was probably a mistake.

Having exhausted all other reasonable avenues, I've come to the scientific conclusion that the only way to appreciate this movie is to share the sensibilities, sensitivities, and neuroses of the filmmakers; and I find these to be distasteful.  This film helps to mark a key boundary of aesthetic territory, and like the man said: ""you never know what's enough until you know what's too much.""",1173744000,4,4820,5.001251564455569
1554086,5,B00005JOQB,"Typically I don't like gory movies. This is a gory movie, but it goes beyond that. It makes horror in a real world setting. It draws you into liking the main characters which makes it more tragic all the bad things that happen to them. The blood and gore wasn't really needed. I'd have preferred more spooky moments, but this movie kept you wondering if even the main star/stars would survive. This is a great popcorn movie. Nudity and sexy women are also a big plus, but it wasn't nudity for it's sake. The storyline of young men vacationing would be an obvious choice for why there was sex and naked women in this movie. Hopefully Hostel 2 is as good as this one or even better. I'd put this movie up there with SAW & SAW II but rate it better than SAW III.

1554087,4,B00005JOQB,"I freely admit that I wanted to hate HOSTEL. I was even looking forward to debunking it here as overhyped, unimaginative, sadistic drivel long before I actually saw it. I don't think I can be blamed for this. the present, rather depressing trend of horror movies - which for some years has been towards ""horror"" (meaning disgust) rather than ""terror"" (meaning the good scare) - has left me itching to pull the trigger on most every new entry in the genre that passes my way, and mostly this urge has been justified.

Don't get me wrong. As a rule I despise horror movies designed largely to gross out or disturb the audience (I'm looking at you, Rob Zombie), and that is why I wanted to damn the film even before I saw it. And indeed, HOSTEL is truly ""horror"" in the disturbing sense, since the actual movie itself is far less scary than its concept of torture and murder as a sort of underground entertainment industry.

Many of HOSTEL's critics contend that the film is one-half softcore porn and one-half snuff film. Others point out its many implausibilities. A few hold out that the ""heroes"" are all jerks and make it impossible for the audience to care about them. Some are just disgusted by the torture, which is as graphic as it is vicious. Most of this is true. The first half of the film IS very slow and replete with naked women; the second half DOES show people being horribly tortured and in some cases killed for the sick pleasure of others (surely the definition of snuff); there are a number of implausible and even ridiculous moments, the ""good"" characters are none of them very good people. But surprisingly, I found that these things did not matter, or at least mattered less than they might have, because of the movie's surprising strengths.

First, the acting. It is not great, but it is uniformly good, much better than in most horror movies. The guy who plays Josh is particularly effective in his torture scenes - almost too believable. And the torturers themselves are frighteningly convincing. Second, the way the film opens, with dark-lit scenes of the torture-chair and tools being washed clean of blood by a whistling, unseen figure, strikes a deep creep into your spine - even before we're introduced to them, we know our cavorting post-collegiates are going to end up in it; the chair acts like a horrible magnet throughout the movie, drawing them slowly but surely into its comfortless seat. Third, the concept is just believable enough to do for backpackers in Europe what JAWS did for swimmers in the Atlantic; the idea that this type of thing, in some form or other, does occasionally go on in this world makes suspension of disbelief less necessary than usual in a horror flick.

It is true that the main protagonist, Paxton, is obnoxious, pushy and much less likeable than either the funnyman Oli, or the sensitive weakling, Josh; but that did not make his ultimate outburst of revenge-crazed heroics less believable. On the contrary, if any of the three of them were going to kick some torturer a*s, he was the likeliest candidate. And he isn't all bad; midway through the flick he expresses remorse over freezing years back when he might have saved a girl from drowning; and at the end, when he hears the Asian girl scream in agony, he risks his life to rescue her from the blowtorch-wielding ""American Businessman."" I have to say in this connection that a lot of the things people read into this movie just aren't there - the mild anti-Americanism is meant as a kind of in-joke for its American audience, not insulting to us, and the nudity and sex at the beginning, far from being a heavy-handed morality message (illicit exploitative sex = horrible but deserved death) were mainly used to distract the censors from the gore at the end (it worked, by the way).

HOSTEL is not a great film by any means. It has many standard horror-movie flaws and one can certainly question the wisdom and morality of further desensitizing our already violence-numbed populace by purveying this type of thing as ""entertainment."" Still, horror is defined as ""a painful emotion of fear, dread or abhorrence"" and on that score, HOSTEL certainly lives up to its billing.",1172880000,,4190,4.734246575342466

1554089,4,B00005JOQB,"This is a true horror movie in every scene of the word for those of us that love the genre. Yes, it has suspense and thrills but it also has something that these PG-13, so called horror movies don't have; graphic and gratuitous violence!

The Movie opens with three travels (two college age guys and their Icelandic travel buddy that they befriended on during their trip) as they trek across Europe to find ""drugs and sex"" and they find an abundance of both.

 What this movie is about is simple in premise but is smart in execution. I'm not going to get into plot details because I do believe the best Horror experience is when you go into a movie cold, as I did with this one. Never knowing where the horror is coming from or knowing all the reasons why.

Unlike most horror flicks, this movie is smart, well written and directed. It has very good acting for a horror movie, and the acting really sells the brutality of some of these scenes.

The scenes are violent and ruthless, there is some very unsettling things to watch but you can't turn away from them. This movie doesn't try to hide behind some deranged serial killer or homicidal maniac or the super natural element to explain these violent acts...better yet. They put a spin on it that makes it quite believable but still disturbing. Very new school horror

The setting was perfect. Your in another country where you don't have friends to call for help, you don't know your surroundings and you can't just pick up a phone and call 911.

The three lead guys are unlikeable, and so are the skanky girls they pick up. Because of the darkness of the film the moments that could have been somewhat humorous are just gritty (like the roaming band of murderous children).

The ""gore"" is left up to the imagination, as the film more alludes to images than lets you see them.

There's nothing wrong with curiosity and empathy and perhaps imagining feeling the pain, but to say that one enjoys it and to praise the actor's performances of getting chopped and sliced is truly one of the most depraved things I've ever read. I would have definitely given this movie 0 stars if I could have. It is pretty much a sick gorefest/killfest, however you want to call it. It teaches a little about human trafficking, but it doesn't present it in a way to enlighten one's mind, and it doesn't implore one to help in any way - the whole thing is for entertainemnt value in the most primitive sense. Point blank, it's just disgusting and pointless. Subjectively, it doesn't even fulfill the goals of a horror movie - it isn't scary or suspenseful in any way.

  Paxton (Jay Hernandez), Josh (Derek Richardson) and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are in Amsterdam for some wild, uninhibited fun with hemp and sex. After curfew they can't get back into their hostel rooms, so they climb up to a stranger's room, Alexei (Lubomir Bukovy) who is cool with it and happens to be the same age as they are.  He tells the young men that their is another hostel in Bratislava where they can meet girls for sex.  Oli is a drifter they hooked up with in Paris. When Oli ends up disappearing, they get the creeps and decide to leave on the train tomorrow.
  What they don't know is that Oli was murdered in a torture chamber. Paxton talks Josh into one more night with the girls. At a party someone slipped them a mickey and they both feel sick. Josh goes back to the hostel, Paxton tries to find a bathroom, but gets locked in a storage room.
  Josh and Paxton are not safe at all.

1554256,3,B00005JOQB,"Eli Roth, director and writer, certainly improved from the awful Cabin Fever, a slash and gash that made zero sense whatsoever. Hostel seems like a paragon compared to Cabin Fever.

The story by now is well known. Three randy young men - two from the U.S. and one from Iceland - are traveling together. Well, actually, *two* randy young men are traveling with a third young man who just lost his girlfriend and, although young men in general want to get it on all the time (so the film would have us believe) he is, at first, less interested in sex and more hurt by his recent loss.

The friends hear of a place in Slovakia where beautiful girls will do anything that men want them to - especially Americans. This, of course, begins a trek from Amsterdam to the city in Slovakia that holds such promise. This isn't remotely believable, unless we assume all three characters to be idiots. Travel hundreds of miles for something they're likely to get (sex) where they are? Let's not forget that they're in Amsterdam, not Mayberry (Andy Griffith Show).

But they do, for what would the movie be without said trip?

They arrive in a very war beaten town (that would have made me leave immediately - it was creepy and devoid of life), and take up lodging in a co-ed hotel. Lucky for them, their roommates are attracted to them, and they end up getting it on together. Unlucky for them, these girls are Sirens.

Oli (the Icelander) is the first to disappear, and the other friends are first confused, and then puzzled when they receive a photo from his cell phone depicting Oli and another girl with largely lifeless looks on their face.

Josh (Harry from Dumb and Dumberer) is the next to disappear, and instead of mystery, we are taken directly to where the action is, so to speak. Josh finds himself securely handcuffed to a chair, and a man with little to no remorse (who wanted to be a surgeon but wasn't allowed to) begins to torture him. Without the blink of an eye, or a hint of hesitation, this man (someone the boys oddly encountered on a train - unbelievable) takes a rather long and large drillbit, and drills a hole in his leg, then his chest, etc. etc.

Flash back to Jay (Friday Night Lights), who survived the ""Siren song"" only because he passed out in a janitor's closet after being drugged instead of the bathroom. His survival leads us into a house of horrors as revolting as anything we've ever seen. To Roth's credit, there are ""rules"" or regulations here. It isn't just a chop shop. It's art that people pay to see, and people pay to see Americans more than any others. That's a nice slap in our face, and perhaps a deserved one, seeing as we are generally disliked the world over at this point in our history.

What happens after Jay enters the chop shop is, again, believable within the parameters of the world Roth has created, and the ending is very satisfying.

There is another Hostel in the making. This film cost 4.5m to make, and grossed 47m in the U.S., also doing well in the international market. To gross 10x what it cost to make the film means it was a success, so Hostel II isn't much of a surprise. It will be interesting to see how well Roth does this time around - if he's learned as much as he did from the making of Cabin Fever, and if Hostel II is that much better than Hostel.",1168300800,2,3314,4.446457990115321
1554257,1,B00005JOQB,"This is advertised as a suspense and horror film. It is neither. The movie is extremely offensive. I have never seen more gratuitous nudity and gore in a single film. There is no suspense in this film. It seems made for people who would like to watch other human being be tortured alive. The biggest problem of all is that you can actually partake in these activities in the 21st century in Thailand. And I am sure in many other countries where mammon rules.

The basic plot of the movie consists of two male students touring Europe for a break before they finish up grade school. They seem to be moving around on their Euro Rail Pass, hunting girls for sexual conquest at ever lay over. Eventually they meet this guy who shows them they will be assured a sure thing in Slovakia. So they head there with girls on their minds. Instead they are the ones who are hunted, caught and then horribly tortured. Where the director makes sure you see every bloody detail.

Two things surprise me about this movie. One is that it was even produced. The second is how any one can give this a decent review. I would recommend that you watch any other movie instead of this one. Do not support torture as a form of entertainment.",1168214400,6,1215,4.443946188340807
1554258,2,B00005JOQB,"Probably you already know the film's plot, so I won't repeat it again. Horror film fans know that there are a set of basic rules in the genre, and you will see `Hostel' is following them faithfully. That means, three backpackers, booze, women and some remote place no one has heard about before. There is nothing new or inventive about the premise, but it is only a starting point for the entire film, so that is alright with me.

The most disappointing thing about `Hostel' for me is, however, that the film is not scary very much. The film seldom builds up the tension or the chills before the terrifying events that happen to each character. Things are set up in by-the-number way, never letting us imagine what is really going on in this quiet village in Slovakia.

Instead, like his previous film `Cabin Fever' director Eli Roth shows lots of gores and tortures that are dreadful to see, and he is surely good at that. But if you ask me if there is something else that is particularly great about the film, I must say I could find none. The political subtext is cursory, and dark humor only falls flat.

The film is ""presented"" by Quentin Tarantino who must have found something great in this film, but frankly I don't know what part of this film he liked so much as to give his name to it. But this is not the first time; anyone remembering the 1996 film `Curdled' (for which Tarantino served as executive producer) knows what I mean.

One interesting thing is that Takashi Miike appears as cameo, an enigmatic businessman warning the protagonist Jay Fernandez to `be careful.' Perhaps this prolific director from Japan could have done a much better job, judging from his works like `Audition.' `Hostel' is after all not a terrible film. It is only passable, having nothing truly scary in it except,  you know, its gruesome torture.",1168128000,4,1838,4.625766871165644

I thought the torture scenes were really well put together. It felt like you were in the room with the torturer, expiriencing it first-hand. I thought that the first torture scene with Derek Richardson was AWESOME, although Derek Richardson's facial expressions right before he was going to be drilled through did not look very real. He looked like he was about to laugh. Hostel had a really dark, mysterious feel to it, which I thought significantly hightened the terror. I thought that the nudity was WAY overdone and that there was just to much of it. The end of the movie is SO satisfying. It felt good even as a viewer, to see Jay Hernandez let Dutch Guy ""have it"" because he was the real villin in this movie and he was probably the only person in the film who actually ""diserved"" to get killed. If you have a weak stomache, than this movie is probably not your thing. But if you think you can handle it, than you should give it a try. A solid 4 stars.",1168041600,,1112,4.3768115942028984
1554260,3,B00005JOQB,"something about hosel just gave me deja vu all over again.  man hunting man has been done so many times in so many capacities, that when the gore finally came around the bend it was neither shocking nor surprising.

the film itself gave so much foreshadowing and obvious oddities surrounding the disappearance of various characters it made the coming scenes easy to anticipate and added to my notion that all the characters were idiots.

that said, it still held my attention and had overall good pacing.  you'll probably see the twist coming from a mile away, but it's a fairly frightening concept none-the-less.

personally, i am sick of horror films that are staged in one or two settings.  hostel tried to reach beyond, but came up short.

a truly unique look at torture can be found in the film ""audition""",1167782400,3,810,4.742857142857143
1554261,1,B00005JOQB,"I saw this film when it originally came out and it had to have been the worst horror film that I had seen in years.

Basically all it is is a soft core porn film with some gore thrown in. The screenplay is so weak that they had to show nudity constantly. No amount of nudity, or gore for that matter, is going to save a horror film if the screenplay is badly written. I think the only people who really like this film are underaged males who want to see naked women.

Besides that the characters are totally unlikeable. Maybe that was the point, but in order for a horror film to work the protaginists have to be somewhat sympathetic. This is a fact of basic story telling. Somebody should have told the people who made this film that, because it doesn't seem like they were paying attention in film school.

It's films like this that are making American horror films really bad. It does good at the box office so movie studios make others like them. The only good horror films coming out these days are from other countries, because they seem to understand that nudity and gore alone don't make a good horror film.

I could stand to watch. If they titled this movie based on the single word that seemed to come

up most frequently in the poorly written dialog, you migh think it was a trashy porno movie.

I could only stand to watch about ten minutes of the movie because I got fed up with the

""F"" word coming up every 30 seconds or so. Who wrote the script? Eddie Murphy...?

And even if the ""F"" word hadn't been used so much, just based on what I saw, I would have

probably turned it off out of bordeom anyway.  I'm sorry, I guess I don't understand using

foul language as an method for building a story. But then, I guess if you can't build suspense,

you disguise it with lame dialog.",1167436800,3,775,4.147651006711409
1554263,2,B00005JOQB,"I didn't like Hostel. The premise is frightening. The idea of being drugged, kidnapped, tortured, and killed by people who are paying to do it, is a great concept for a film. It's just too bad that the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be.

It starts off like ""Euro-trip"" or any number of cheesy teen sex comedies.(YAWN) Lots of fake boobs and characters acting idiotic, in a fake atmosphere. (CAUGH) Scenes in dance clubs that don't look realistic. You know, the types of places where people are dancing to loud music, but somehow can talk to each other in a normal tone of voice and everything is brightly lit so you can see all the movie extras pretending to dance in the background.(BORNING)  Just like all the clubs, I've ever been to, right?(YAWN) Anyway, this goes on and on until the bloodshed starts, giving us absolutely no reason to feel anything for the main characters.

Then it turns into the horror film it should be. The scenes of torture are effective and psychologically scary if you imagine yourself in the situation, but in the context of the rest of this movie it just becomes ineffective.

Then the end of the movie turns into an unrealistic revenge fantasy that's played out, for the most part, for laughs. Kids paid in bubble gum help the good guy get away by smashing the bad guys heads in with rocks as they chew away and blow bubbles. (???) The two girls and guy who set them up are easily killed when they luckily appear in front of the getaway car. The man that killed his friends just happens to be on the train on the way home so he can kill him and somehow not get blood on himself, and then continue on his way. So is the movie supposed to be realistic, scary, or funny? Its falls short of any of these things. Eli Roth needs to pick one and do it.

The music is terrible. Not in the fact that the music itself isn't good, but for the fact that, A: it doesn't fit the movie, and 2: There's way too much of it. There's a scene where the Characters are merely walking across a courtyard, and the music sounds like it should be a fight scene in Harry Potter. Completely out of place and distracting, further telling you this is just a movie no need to feel anything for the characters or get scared.

I gave ""Hostel"" a 2 out of 5 for a frightening concept, and the puke was a nice touch. . . If you're about to get tortured and killed chances are you're going to puke. . . Realism, Eli. More realism please.",1167436800,3,2443,4.3347921225382935
1554264,2,B00005JOQB,"This film is gratuitous in almost every respect--at first, it's all about young American college boys traveling abroad to score at every stop their EuroPass will bring them to.  Drinking, drugs, and naked bodies galore.  One boy can only think with his lower extremities, and the other has hang-ups that would make Jimmy Stewart call him a prude.  The boys are as annoying as college boys can get, and it seems that their demise couldn't come too soon, but when it does, the gory moments don't feel satisfying.  They are quick and brutal, yet somehow left off without satisfaction, for it's too easy to want to see those boys dead, and there is no pleasure taken in learning who is going to do the dirty deeds.  There are some nice circles mapped here of man's horror to man, and how evil actions spawn evil results, even in the hearts of the victims themselves, but if this was a sex-fest and gore-fest, they played together a little too close to a Ted Bundy or John Wayne Gacy line, connecting them a little too directly to see much of the fun in either.",1166918400,5,1056,4.507853403141361
1554378,4,B00005JOQB,"This movie is nothing phenominal but it delivers EXACTLY what it promises. Gratuitous gore, nudity, and B-Movie level acting. This isn't going to breach my top horror lists, but it's definitely one of the better horror flicks of the 21st century and worth at least checking out.

Cons: The gore effects are fairly decent but coulda been better, the characters aren't really all that likeable, and the plot was kinda flawed.

Pros: The idea behind a place where you can pay to kill people gives a disturbing viewpoint of all of society being one's enemy (there's no ONE villian in this movie but several), the women throughout are gorgeous (not really all that relevant but a plus nonetheless) and I although some of the characters are cliched, the order of their deaths and how gruesome the deaths are aren't cliched.

Overall I enjoyed this movie; it's a good B-Level flick. It was entertaining and it gave me an eerie outlook on Hostels which certainly made this movie memorable enough to think of it everytime I go to Europe and stay in a hostel (which I surprisingly do quite often.)

1)the gore/torture scenes aren't THAT graphic, but they do justice for horror's sake. just to imagine the pain is enough to freak you out.

2)the plot is very strong and makes the movie even scarier, just to think, this could actually happen.

these two things teamed up together to make this a new generation horror movie. acting was great. lionsgate outdone themselves with their 2006 release of hostel. i can definently say i was impressed.

the only con about the movie is i wish it was longer. it's only about 90 minutes long. overall, fantastic, thrilling. 4 stars. a must see.",1164412800,,729,4.627906976744186

As you will see in many other reviews, this film is uneaven, obviously that was a decided part of the feature, but for the complaints it was obviously not carried out as well as it could have been and i have to agree with that.

secondly; the film relies so much on showing the characters as complete party guys that i fealt myself unable to really sympathise with the preppy, rich boys, on their wild party through Europe.

third and final; The film looses it's awe when viewed more than two or three times, or if you've just read spoilers or listened to your pals talking about it, then it is pretty much over.  If you know about why it has an R rating (other than the softcore porn int he first half) you know the secret.  it's not particularly well hidden and there isn't anything to be gained by a repeat viewing.

1554385,2,B00005JOQB,"I was expecting to hate this film.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it very much either.  It's nothing really special.  The plot is extremely simple.  3 guys go to Europe to smoke pot, have indiscriminate sex, smoke more pot, drink, and have more sex.  They go to Slovenia, where they get abducted by some locals who runs a business (for lack of a better term) where they entertain wealthy clients by allowing them to torture and kill people.  Do places like this really exist?  Probably, but it's best not to think about those things.  Is this film any good?  Roth builds up a nice sense of dread when you finally get to the torture palace, but that's it.  The film has a great premise, but the execution of it is pedestrian.  The 3 protagonists aren't as boorish as some people have suggested, but you don't really get to know them too well.  They're never developed as real people, just stock movie characters.  This film doesn't have any substance or depth to it at all.  And what's more the film has absolutely no sense of humour.  I like horror films infused with a dark, cynical humour, like the films of Romero, especially Dawn of the Dead and The Crazies.  This could have easily been one of those.  There are too many coincidences, and some very unbelievable scenes (the one where one of the protagonists gives a bunch of vagabond children candy to kill some of the torture guys is so ridiculous).  Roth is trying to emulate Takashi Miike (who has a cameo here), but he doesn't have any of Miike's sense of depth, substance, and sadness (a lot of people miss those things in Miike's films).  Miike is a real artist, as opposed to Roth, who just wants to show a lot of gore and T & A.  I have seen worse gore in other films.  There are other films out there that are far superior to this.

This is an excellent film.  Well directed, great plot, good musical scores.  You all know the plot from the previous writers.  Or you may have seen the film.

Yes there is gore, however the way it is presented is what got ones attention.  Actually the gore is quite tame considering similar movies like Mark of The Devil, or even, the most recently released Elizabeth I on HBO, which depicts executions and mutilations much more brutal than this film.

I cannot even begin to set up this review without dispelling how much this movie made me angry to have wasted 100 minutes or so of my life to watch it.

Cinematically, this was my introduction to Eli Roth. I have read mixed results on his contributions to film thus far. Critics; naturally, consider him another run-of-the-mill schlock artist. Actual horror fans seem to be evenly split between thinking he's overrated and finding his work to be that of genius. After seeing ""Hostel"", I was in my own category of thinking he should just stop.

From the outset, the three college students we are following around equate to being the three most idiotic horror movie victims I can remember in quite a while. Personally, I wanted to see all three of them mangled instantly. The basic idea revolves around their backpacking trip of Europe in search of babes and booze. While headed to a brothel where the most beautiful girls will pleasure any American at the drop of a hat, they run afoul a gentleman who ends up being not as he seems.

From their first encounter with him, it turns into a tale where each one gets sold up the river to a rich man's hunting club where wealthy men with sick and macabre fascinations pay good money to torture and kill helpless victims. However, by the time the mayhem really begins, you've spent too much time yawning and rolling your eyes at the pre-junior high school dialogue to even care.

So, all one really has left to savor is the gore, which in total is nothing you haven't seen in recent years from other directors who choose not to walk the safe path of PG-13 horror. Sure, there are some cringe-worthy moments here and there but again, someone with a penchant for horror films will likely walk away unimpressed. There are a few nods to Fulci and Argento here and there but overall, nothing you could categorize as being as inventive or original. The most annoying part was the set-up for how Jay Hernandez eventually escapes. I won't ruin it for you if you plan to see this movie but I can assure you, it could not possibly get any lamer.

1554494,5,B00005JOQB,"This is absolutely one of the scariest horror films I've ever seen, simply because the premise is SO plausible.  It could happen to anyone on their next trip away from home, and the eerie reality (particularly for any who has been to Europe) will keep you from blinking through the entire film.

Premise:  Young adults backpacking through Europe meet a fellow traveler who says, ""Hey, you gotta try Upper Slobovia!  Best women on the planet and everything's cheap - blah, blah"".  So, parting from their benefactor, off they go.  Tra-la-la!  Think of this as a far darker, ""The Island"" (Leo DiCaprio), only this boasts 100,000 watts of ""shock-you-in-your-seat"" power.  My funmeter was in the red during the entire film.  What else - it's Quinton Tarantino approved.

WARNING:  If you can sincerely appreciate implicit and explicit violence against humans, some of which is unique to this film, go for it.  If you are squeamish or intolerant of actualised madness, pass it.  Definitely not for the faint of heart (or kids either, please).

There is some nudity, admiringly good sex, and lots of gore - particularly novel treatments of old themes that are unique in my film-going experience.  Superb writing.  The originators of the film must be absolute perverts to think up this storyline.  The reality is that there are bad people in the world, just like these characters, who are waiting, waiting for you to show up in their town.  You've been warned.

Having traveled all over the world for business or pleasure, I see now how this could have happened to me anywhere, anytime.  That's the hook - this literally can happen to you.

STORY: 3 teenagers on a European trip get locked outside the hostel they are staying in. They go to their friends as a source of help and are told about a Slovakian hostel with total chicks. They take a trip to Slovakia and stay at the hostel, with total chicks for roomates. But that's not all, one by one each teenager dissapears, and it'a all up to Paxton to find out...then Paxton is next.

I decided that I'd buy it on OnDemand & see for myself.  She was right.  I won't go into any details of the plot, because it's been done before.  Really the only gore that you see that is worth a grimace is the ""eye cutting"" scene.  Later you see her running in front of a train, cause she doesn't want to live like that,(who the hell would?)but you only see the blood flying, no actual body.  That is pretty much the entire movie,(or I should say half of the movie,)only implied gore, & if you are a horror fan, it's nothing you havn't seen millions of times before.  In the ads you see a man with a drill, & then the guy with a gag over his mouth screams.  But that is it.  You see him scream, no blood.  Hell, the guy only tortures him, he survives.  But then he runs in a rampage & shoots many people.  You can see somebody get shot on an episode of CSI for crying out loud.  Oh I forgot, when that friend is being dragged into a room, you see other rooms here peopel ar ebeing tortured, but it happens so fast, you really don't see anything.  There is a scene where another friend is being tortured with the same drill & you do see some of the gore, but then it is quickly moved to just a shot of him screaming.  Later you see the torturer,(if that's a word,)talking to the guy & you see there reflection in a shred of glass.  So, you can guess he's gonna get impaled, but they cut away from it at the last second.  The 1st guy dies, but, as some revierer said, you just see his severed head, not how it happened.  At least in the original Friday the 13th we see a split second of Mrs. Voorhees getting decapitated.  Plus, if you have the DVD collection they show even more in the special features.  Yes, there is a lot of sex,(though I even think that people are implying more than there really is,)but if you have a boyfriend or girlfriend just go have sex with them, rather than paying to see it.

This movie is basically like one of those SAW ripoff movies that promise you blood and gore, but give you a ""gruesome noise"" or a moment where they almost show him clipping off the toe of the girl when the camera quickly cuts to the next scene........ boring.",1158796800,2,734,4.25
1554557,1,B00005JOQB,"I rented the ""unrated"" version of the Hostel and my first impression was, ""What gore?"" I can't imagine anyone enjoying this movie except[...]teenagers who want to see lots of naked women having sex. For the first half of the movie that's all we see. If that was the intention of this movie then Hostel would have fit the bill perfectly (I'm assuming this since I'm a woman and not a male let alone a [...] one).

The second half of the movie is when all the horror and extreme gore are supposed to take place. If you want to see real gore then rent a copy of an actual autopsy. Since the story line has been explained in other reviews then we know that there are three guys backpacking through Europe in search of sex. The first victim in the group to be killed is an Icelandic guy named Oli. At no time do we see any part of his death. All we see is his severed head. Oooo, never seen that before have we? In many of the horror/gore movies made today, decapitation and severed heads are passe. The second victim in this trio shows the results of what the killer is doing but not the action itself. The killer drills holes into various parts of the guy's body. We don't see it happening, we just see the blood dripping from his wounds. The killer goes slicing away at the victims body but since it's all done off camera I couldn't even figure out what was done to the guy - correction: I just rewatched that part and the killer cuts the kid's Achilles tendon (I think we saw that in House of Wax). Considering what can be done with special effects, there's no reason that the drilling and slicing can't be shown outright - after all, this is the ""Unrated"" version. Yes, there's blood splashed around everywhere and there are body parts lying here and there but none of that can't be shown in an R-rated movie. Jeeze, when I was still working as an RN (nurse to those who don't know) in the OR and in the Delivery Room (where babies are born), I can assure you that I've seen a hell of a lot more blood than is seen in this movie. I also had a position where I made frequent trips to the Cook County Morgue in Chicago - now that's more gruesome than what you'll see in this or most other movies (unless it 's changed since I was there in 1997-1998) bodies aren't kept in nice neat drawers, they're stacked on shelves that go from the floor all the way up to the ceiling - and the smell; let's just say that there's nothing like it anywhere else.

Sorry I digressed a bit there. The point that I was trying to make is that this is not a horror/gore movie that deserves all the big to-do that's been made of it and since the ""Unrated"" addition to the title generally implies much more intense violence than could make it in an R-rated movie, this movie is a disappointment. The only reason that I think that this version of Hostel uses the ""Unrated"" stamp is for the amount of sex and nudity.

If you want to see a great horror/gore fest (with a lot of humor added in - sorry, don't remember naked women) watch Peter Jackson's (as in The Lord if the Rings trilogy) Bad Taste. Now that's what I call gore!",1157846400,10,3101,4.261460101867572

The mood in our theater went from silent to CRAZY! People cheering and screaming, it was awesome. So, I did, very much, enjoy this movie, and will DEFINITELY be at opening night of Hostel 2- Can't Wait!!

If you do, though, there's plenty here to disturb and the DVD extras are great fun, too.

Storyline is a group of young male friends go travelling in Europe and after hitting Amsterdam go on a quest to Eastern Europe in search of the loosest women they can find.

The horror codes and conventions are there with misbehaving adventurous teens acting in an obnoxious and irresponsible way while on the path to terror and destruction.

Once in Eastern Europe they party on and then start to go missing, leading to the discovery that they have been lured into an evil trap. Won't go into more detail in case you want to watch it.

Sounds like sterotypical horror fare, but this has more blood, cruelty and gore than most.

I really like this movie not because it created a real atmosphere of tension and suspense and horror - what a horror movie is meant to do.

It also has a flavour of Tarantino in it, too, which is always good.

Watching the DVD extras on the making of the movie were great, too, really funny.

1554560,1,B00005JOQB,"Eli Roth's ""Hostel"" tries hard to be a genius in the horror genre but succeeds only in being a vile, empty excuse to showcase as much gore and nudity as possible.
The basic plotline is pure Horror Moviemaking 101.  Group of young people (in this case, 3 college age guys) outside their normal environment (in this case, backpacking thru Europe)who stumble upon some kind of horror (in this case, a hostel that finds victims for demented persons willing to pay to abuse, mutilate and kill strangers).  It goes wrong from the very beginning.  The college age guys are anything but sympathetic.  They are presented as mindless, stoned horndogs who only want to ingest drugs and get laid.  There is nothing redeeming about them.  The first 30 minutes or so of the movie is nothing more than these same unsympathetic guys in a variety of sex acts.  The nudity and sexuality gets repetitive and old. The movie is indeed full of graphic violence and horror - - even after having seen my share of some pretty scary and even gruesome movies, I could barely watch some scenes in ""Hostel"".
But ""Hostel"" leaves you feeling almost as demented and empty as the killer.  The movie seems so black, so souless that I felt as though I needed a shower after watching it.  It definitely makes people out to be incredibly cruel and cold toward one another.
I would not recommend this movie in general.  I just couldn't find too much that was redeeming about it.",1157414400,7,1440,4.6561264822134385
1554561,5,B00005JOQB,"""hostel"" is a brutal, disturbing examination of human beings most perverse and illicit desires. i loved it. this is the first film i have seen in the theater in 2006, and if every film this year is as good as ""hostel"", we're in for one helluva year.

the film was written and directed by eli roth. roth was a protege of director david lynch who recently decided to strike out on his own. his first film, 'cabin fever"", was an ambitious but ultimately mediocre effort. while it had genuinely great moments in it, the film was all over the place tone-wise and felt like a talented guy's attmepts to get his bearings. still, i had hope that roth could make good movies because he was included in bravo channel's special ""100 scariest movie moments of all time"", and roth was so knowledgeable of horror that he had a comment about almost every film on the list. someone with that much love and know-how with the genre was bound to make a great horror film eventually. now he has. he has found a better way to mix horror and comedy (which is done by alot of filmmakers even though it rarely works; for every film that mixes horror and comedy well, like a ""re-animator"", we have hundreds of films which end up sucking, like ""scream 3"". roth has solved the problem by having ""hostel"" start out as a comedy (the premise of the film is very similar to the film ""eurotrip"", with both films having action take palce ina country called bratislava, which i am not too proud to admit that i have no idea if it actually exists in real life or not) and then descend into drama and horror as it goes on.

the commercials for ""hostel"" make a big deal about quentin tarantino ""presenting"" the film, but really all tarantino did was raise some money for the film and co-executive produce. his involvement was minimal, except as a great marketing tool (and it seemed to work; this weekend ""hostel"" was #1 and grossed $20.1 million, a figure which indicates that the film attracted a wider audience than hard core horror fans like myself and the types of people who saw ""high tension"" in the theaters, lol).

the plot is as follows : two american kids (college-age) and an icelandic man they pick up on the way, are touring europe with the goal of smoking as much pot, taking as many drugs, and sleeping with as many hot women as possible. one night they end up staying with a guy who tells them that a poor country in the former soviet bloc has the hottest and easiest girls in europe, and our three protagonists travel there in the hopes of getting laid by really hot girls. little do they know that this is all a trap for a business in the poor country called 'elite hunting"", a service that kidnaps young people and, for a price, allows you to lock a person they have kidnapped up in a room and let you do whatever you want with them, supplying them with various weapons and surgical instruments. our protagonists start to disappear one by one, which is all the more scary because these characters are trapped in a foreign land where they know no one, and are truly alone to try and survive.

i can't go further without mentioning the nudity. this film has more nudity than soft core cinemax erotica. in a day and age where films are gradually becoming more puritanical under the neoconservative cultural movement afoot, it's nice to see a film push the limits of R-rated nudity like the films in the 1970s did. the beginning and middle of this film, before the real horror sets in, is a veritable boob-o-rama, a feast for the eyes for a perv like, well, like me, lol.

as for the violence and gore, well, let me just say that the film is not as groy or as depraved as you might imagine from the previews. the film IS very violent and has plenty of gore to satisfy the horror fans, but the violence is safely within the boundaries of the r-rating. basically, the violence is more graphic than the recent 'wolf creek"", but not as violent as ""high tension"". what makes ""hostel"" so effective isn't just the gore, but the fact that most of the torture scenes take place in dark, wet, dripping, moldy, concrete rooms lit with a green tint as if we are watching a nine inch nails video gone horribly wrong.

when we do get gore, it is not the usually enjoyable gore which looks obviously like a make-up effect. no matter how many horror filsm i see, the violnce rarely effects me. but you know what does effect me? surgery on tv. seeing surgery performed on TV makes me queasy (though i always end up watching it anyway). the biggest compliment i can pay the violence of ""hostel"" is that the gore feels less like a horror movie's and more like surgery.

what made this film great rather than just 'good"" or ""scary"" are the deeper messages of the film. as the film starts off in amsterdam we get our characters going to a prostitute in amsterdam, where one character comments on how ""paying to go into a room with a woman and do anything you want with her is wrong"" (that's actually a paraphrase and not a direct quote...i wasn't taking notes during the film to know the exact line of dialogue). this is the film drawing attention to the fact that sex and violence are both illicit desires harbored by humans, each individual harboring them to varying degrees. what the film is doing by showing the protagonists paying for sex and the villains paying to kill is that sex, violence, and all of human's most immoral desires are fast becoming commodities in our heavily capitialist world (the fact that the movie largely takes place in a former soviet country, one which is still fairly new in being capitalist after the pseudo-communist rule of the soviets, is no accident). we have put a price tag on our most illicit fantasies, desires which probably shouldn't be acted out, because when you have two people, and one is allowed to do whatever they want to the second person, that's not fair to that second person, even if you pay them. in part i disagree with this message (i support the legalization of heavily regulated and taxed prostitution), but i see the point, and the film is offering a nightmare version of the slippery slope we are going down. if we continue to insist that our basest desires be fulfilled, at any cost, we are not too far from ""elite hunting"". we have to keep oursleves in check, think morally and not just our hedonistic nature to feel good, or else the human race is doomed.

too deep for a horror film? i don't think so. i think ti is this depth that separates the great horror films, like this and the first two ""saw"" films, from the crappy PG-13 horror films, or even the good-yet-unspectacular horror films like the recent 'wolf creek"". even though we are only in january, i have a feeling that come this time next year this film will make it on my 10 best list (not the least of which ebcause horror movies hold a special place in my heart, and thus i am more partial to them than real film critics are).

needless to say, i am recommending the film. if you don't like horror movies, or blood makes you queasy, or you don't want to walk out of the movie theaters disturbed and needing to discuss the film in conversation with your pals, this isn't the movie for you. you know who you are, people. ""hostel"" is a horror film for people who like horror films. if you are only a casual fan of horror, stick with mre mainstream, pedestrain fair. this is a haunting, deep, provacative, and intelligent horror film that still does it's job in titillating and scaring you...and it's one helluva way to kick off 2006.

1554631,5,B00005JOQB,"(Note: This review is specifically for the unrated version of Hostel.)

First of all, let me say that Lion's Gate, responsible for the film's distribution, has come a long way from the days when it was almost exclusively synonymous with bad B-movies. It has become one of the major distributors of good horror movies that push the envelope, such as the Saw franchise and High Tension, and it could now be said that it's a patron of the genre.

Hostel develops an interesting premise and is better seen in ignorance of any plot summaries/background information on the movie. In the style of Asian horror, there is plenty of over-the-top gore, and in the style of campy American horror, there's plenty of nudity, but this doesn't detract from the ability of the director, Eli Roth, to take us to new and ever darker places as the plot thickens, building suspense right up to the gratifying finale.

Unlike many horror movies nowadays, it has an ending that provides some closure and does not leave you thinking that a sequel sometime in the near future is inevitable, although IMO this concept could be taken further and the movie ended too soon for me. Then again I'm somewhat jaded when it comes to horror fiction in general, so maybe it's just the right length to not overwhelm non-targeted audiences.

Because of the level of entertainment, I have to give this movie a 10 within the genre. It has everything the modern horror fan could want, like good direction, great makeup and special effects, an atmosphere all its own. and a main character that is believable because he's not making the clich&eacute;, inane mistakes that most horror leads are scripted to make with the inexplicable notion that this somehow adds to the scare factor.

If you are not easily grossed out or offended, I recommend renting or, better yet, buying Hostel. Who knows? You may want to revisit it...",1156982400,3,1880,4.790123456790123
1554632,5,B00005JOQB,"Perhaps an alternate title for this movie could have been ""Hostile"" because Hostel was quite gory and gruesome, just as I'd hoped. If you couldn't get enough of either Saw or Saw II (and are as excited about the upcoming theatrical release of Saw III) then Hostel is right up your alley. What's most shocking are all the reviews here commenting about the nudity at the beginning of the film. You have to keep in mind that the setting is in Amsterdam and people over there are less hung up about nudity. That being said, I think it fits perfectly into the movie. The story follows 3 guy friends around Amsterdam, who head to another town for the women and the prospect of what these women will do...the locals say the women will do ANYTHING and just love American men. The guys go, and sure enough, sexy women abound, taking them out for a night of fun. Everything seems great until the next morning when one of the friends is discovered to have left. The 2 remaining guys try to find their friend but he never returns or calls them back. Even more disturbing, he's sent them a picture from his camera phone saying he's gone home. But things soon get even stranger in this strangeland and to say more would ruin it for anyone else who's been wanting to see this. If gory and gruesome are things you enjoy in a movie, you should not miss Hostel. I was riveted from beginning to end, and I must say I very much liked the ending too. Be prepared though...this is not for the squeamish. You've been warned. A must-see for fans of this genre.",1156896000,2,1536,4.411971830985915
1554633,4,B00005JOQB,"Something is going on out there. Films like Hostel, Saws 1 & 2 Wolf Creek etc represent something new in Horror.

I found Hostel to be much more interesting than, say, Saw 2. Why?

 I can certainly see hating the film. That probably is the best response. But as I watched the film I suspected that a lot more was going on than met the eye. Obviously the film is supposed to be repulsive. And not all of the gore is supposed to be anatomically correct. But what's fascinating to me is how the film actually goes after the audience. Maybe some of the reaction against it is a feeling that you, the audience, are being attacked.

What's the basic plot outline?

A couple of typical American teen type guys go to Amsterdam to experience the legal illicit pleasures of open grass smoking and prostitution. Then they hear of something weirder so they follow the trail and mythology to Slovakia, where the girls are all just dying to give themselves to American guys. Then they have greedy dreamy sex and suddenly they find themselves in hell in some pay for torture dungeon (that was actually based on something real in Thailand). There on the film is about unbelievable torture and escape. Stupidity and naivete are crushed in the end.

The teen guys in the beginning are so much a representation of exactly the audience at home that it is clear that the message of the film has to do with undermining the audience, which frankly really needs to be undermined. We Americans are so proud, dopey and naive that we may need films like this to make us shrink back into our seats a bit.

Notice the film does not have any stock Goth images.

The actual imagery is almost all World War 2, Communist, totalitarian and Holocaust which Americans don't have any natural defenses for, unlike Vampire and devil movies. Also because the movie was about paying to watch torture just as you have also paid to watch this torture yourself. The film also often goes for the eyes, which is an attack upon the film viewer. Eli Roth who is a very intelligent Jew certainly knows what the implications are, especially the Holocaust connections. In interviews (look for them online) he is quite articulate that the film questions the American frat boy attitude which sees Europe as a Disneyland of pot and hookers.

The film also works because it gets close to the nerve of so much of the brutality in contemporary youth culture, then says you want torture? Fine. Here it is. But This does raise a lot of implications that should really be questioned. Saw 2 looks like a commercial work in comparison. Its pretty predictable. But then I had a pretty vivid recollection of Saw 1 when I watched it. I think the needle scene on Saw 2 is what really sticks (ooops pun alert) with everyone in that film. Hostel though is a central document of this epoch.

(Plus Barbara Nedeljakova is a real find.)

The real question involving many newer films circles around this: Why has torture become a dominant motif today? Wolf Creek is also here in this category and may be the toughest to watch of all of them.

Here is a suggestion of other films in this new category of

Seventies Retro and Torture films excluding the recent crop of zombie films. They are all not on the same level to be sure. But as a unified message they nail something in the present.

1554634,4,B00005JOQB,"When I first saw Hostel in the theatre, I was a bit taken back that it seemed more like soft core porn than a horror movie.  The entire 1st half is basically filled with nude women, and sex.

However, after watching the movie a few times, it really makes sense the way it was put together.

Definately not for folks who can't handle blood, guts, and oozing open wounds!  Great effects, and great story line.  It's hard to believe places like this really exist in the world.

I love the twist at the end - sweet justice is always a perfect ending.",1156723200,,546,4.303921568627451
1554635,4,B00005JOQB,"Three college students (played by Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson and Eythor Gudjonsson) decide to backpack across Europe. They have no idea what lies in wait. When they meet an older man on the train, they're told about a village where women will do anything to satisfy a man--especially Americans. Checking into a hostel in Slovakia, the three men discover that their room comes with a few perks. Three gorgeous women. And this of course leads to one thing.

Most of the first half of the film is filled with the gratuitous sexual encounters so prevalent in today's horror movies; however, since it's actually a key part of the story line, I guess they had to do it. (No pun intended.) The women are bait. And once the men are lured in, they're drugged and find themselves in a terrifying predicament.

As a longtime fan of horror movies, I felt there was extreme shock value in the gross chopping, drilling and slicing of human flesh. It made me cringe and turn away at times, and I have a strong stomach. It isn't a psychological thriller or ghostly horror, so much as a movie that tests your limits on what you can visually handle seeing.

The final explanation of what's actually going on is perhaps what sets this film apart from other random slasher films. In fact, it's the `hunt club' aspect that makes the story line more believable and even, dare I say, feasible. Yet instead of hunting down victims, wealthy men can torture, maim or murder in order to satisfy their sadistic needs. And as a subtle humorous dig, it's the Americans who are most prized. For what better way to get back at the US than to torture and kill future generations? The shocking violence of the group of children that appears occasionally also sends a strong message. If you travel to a foreign country, it's a good thing to carry gum and candy!

At least the acting in Hostel was a far cry from the poor readings of the actors in the movie Saw--a movie that made me groan and sigh, wishing I could have written their dialogue and had my neighbors act it out.

Unlike many of today's horror films, Hostel does leave you with a vaguely fulfilling ending. Of course, you'll just have to see it now to find out what that is. This is the perfect dieter's movie too, by the way. You won't be too hungry or thirsty while you're watching it. This movie is definitely for 18+!!!

If you enjoy a movie that makes you gasp, cringe or has your stomach churning, this is it. If you can't handle blood, excessive gore and brutality, I'd recommend you watch a comedy instead. Now...where did I put my saw? :)

1554636,2,B00005JOQB,"""Hostel"" leads you to believe that this is going to be a very scary movie with lots of violence that haven't been seen before, and all it gives in the end is porn and things done to death in horror movies. The story is so basic; you don't even have to hear what they are saying to get this movie. There are times when I was watching the movie and said something to someone and still understood what was going on, even though I didn't hear a few lines. There is nothing shocking in this movie and it is very predictable.

The gore is almost absent and is nothing extreme; I have seen more gore in the Friday the 13th series. About the first thirty to forty minutes of the film is sex and more sex. This is not a film for the kiddies, that's for sure. Overall, if you want a movie that is like this but actually has a good story, watch the Dentist and the Dentist 2. This film has nothing special at all. The movie is not scary and not gory. It misses all the points that made the Saw series great, which it tries to live up to in this film. This movie isn't horrible by any means, it just not all the hype leads you to believe. It is a soft core porn movie with a little blood thrown in.",1156291200,2,1186,4.02542372881356
1554637,4,B00005JOQB,"If gore is not your thing this film is not for you.  Eli Roth's second offering is a study in human torture.  After the introductions have been made and we see the three main characters the ""drilling begins.""  Body parts are cut off, eyes gouged out and there is no shortage of maniacs on the streets.  The alluring women provide for the seduction aspect and I'm sure most men would envy the backpackers who have fun fun fun with these babes.  There is a side bar of sorts as one of the protagonists, ""Josh"" may be questioning his sexuality but the sex featured is pretty much for the all American red blooded straight male.  I personally was hoping for a little gay diversion but you can't have it all.

The torture scenes are grotesque to say the least and one can't help but flinch away at times.  Although the two Americans aren't that likeable in the beginning they sure don't deserve their fate.  The guy from Iceland was funny although I felt a bit shortchanged when we didn't get to witness his torture session before the facts.  The film does pull you in if gruesome horror is your thing and it does make you feel for the victims; a feat few horror films manage to accomplish.  Eli Roth is one lucky dude to have such success with only two films and it remains to be seen what he comes up with next.

The extras are another story.  Glimpsing behind the scenes ones sees a bunch of weirdoes engaged in more or less juvenile behavior.  They all seem to be laughing at something like they just pulled off the biggest prank in history and got away with it.  The childish antics take away from any serious expose about the film and I personally ended up disliking everyone involved with this project.  The language used in the footage was just crass and none of the actors or crew seemed to have any redeeming qualities about them.  I was more then glad when the feature was over and even skipped some of the parts.  I haven't delved into the audio commentaries yet due to the fact the featurette was so annoying so I can't comment on that.  Overall it was entertaining and accomplished what it set out to do but in my opinion Eli Roth's success has gone to his head.

1554638,5,B00005JOQB,"There are two types of horror flick. In the first, the protagonist battles a monster that all of us knows doesn't exist - can't exist. We watch Creature of the Black Lagoon and appreciate it as camp, never believing for a second that there reall was a lizard-man that  was swimming below the beautiful girl. We can watch this and relax. Then there is the second type, the kind that makes us squirm. We watch Jaws, and secretly fear that there really is a horrible predatory shark just below the surface, swimming under the beautiful girl.  We see this and getting in the water is never quite the same. Hostel falls squarely in this second class, and does it with gritty intensity I haven't seen in a long time. Well, maybe Saw did it too - there really might be a sicko out there wanting me to make the choice between my foot and escape. The story of Hostel is pretty clear, and is identifiable to a lot of us (especially guys) who went to Europe with just a backpack and dreams of adventure. Some guy we meet along the way tells us, ""Hey, go there. You'll find all the girls you can handle."" Well the guys in this movie take his advice, and really do get more than they can handle - way, way more. The, ""Holy Cow, I can't believe it!"" ending makes it worth sitting around to the credits. Sure it is juvenile, but so is going abroad to find sex. I work a lot of nights, and we often sit arund talking about movies we've recently seen. The consensus is that Hostel, along with Saw and Derailed is among the creepiest movies released for a long time. I have to confess that I gave a lot more thought about where I stayed when I went to Italy this summer than I usually do. Any movie that has the Jaws Effect - the ability to make you change your day-to-day behavior easily deserves five stars in my book.",1155945600,3,1802,4.281524926686217
1554639,4,B00005JOQB,"You'll rarely find a mainstream horror film that's gorier or more intense than Eli Roth's Hostel.  When Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and his two pot smoking pals go in search of sex and drugs, they get much, much more than they bargained for, as one by one they get captured and unbelievably and brutally tortured.  That's about as far as the story goes, but there's no need for Hostel to go any farther because Roth more than makes his point.  The film is more of a throwback to the exploitation films of the 70's, focusing less on story and character development and more on sickening gore effects and shocks.  And Roth is not afraid to let his camera linger and not cut away (the eye extraction scene will make you squirm like you won't believe).  Quentin Tarantino executive produced, and his hand can be felt in the final, revenge driven sequences.  Those who grew up with the aforementioned films will find plenty to admire with Hostel, but for those who have been weaned on teeniebopper, Scream-horror or PG-13 Japanese remakes, this should be avoided.  The DVD has a surprising amount of extras, particularly commentaries by Roth and Tarantino, which in itself is a real treat.",1155859200,,1179,4.75
1554640,2,B00005JOQB,"I picked this movie up while on an extreme gore binge with a friend of mine. When we saw this, we figured ""Awesome, that's supposed to be disgusting!"" Although this is marketed as ""The scariest movie of the decade"", it is nothing of the sort. It is NEVER scary. Ever. Disgusting? Yeah, in a few parts I guess. But if the entire movie is riding on gore and violence, and there are only a few minutes of the saids content, then the movie has failed. Yeah, the achilles tendon scene was a definite flincher, but nothing else really got me. The eye was wicked fake looking. It was obviously a cheap prosthetic slapped over her eye.

Another serious issue was the VERY slow buildup. At least an hour was spent showing as many breasts as they could fit on the reel. It was meant to lull the viewer into a false sense of security, but it was so long that the viewer was CONSTANTLY dragged into thinking about what the trailer promised. A 30 minute buildup, reasonable. 60? That's just bad editing. Sorry.

Another thing that really got me is that sometimes the main character wouldn't take the action the viewer really wanted him to. It would have been great if he went on a murderous rampage, killing his captors. He did take out four or five guards, but that was not enough.

Overall, this movie was not even halfway as good as the trailer made it seem, and the fact that it was marketed as a horror movie is just pathetic.",1155686400,7,1418,4.404580152671755

This is just a b-movie horror flick. It's the usual scenario of T&A followed by copious blood and ooze. I'm sorry I wasted my time on it.,1155254400,,301,4.298245614035087
1554740,4,B00005JOQB,"First off - there's quite a bit of Hollywood B.S. used to promote this film, but it's still pretty good in my opinion. Contrary to the promotional copy, there is no ""shortage"" of men in Slovakia.  World War II was a LONG time ago. So if there is an ample supply of willing women, that's probably due more to a shortage of hard currency than anything else. Also, there is corruption in all of the former Eastern Bloc countries, but the roving bands of ten-year-old outlaws featured in the film is pure fantasy. I've been to Slovakia. It's a poor country, but the people there are quite civil, I assure you.

This film isn't nearly as ""pointless"" or lacking in a plot as many of the other reviewers claim. I think it's one hell of a great plot idea, actually. Sad to say, I suspect there are people in this world who would run a torture-murder for profit business if they thought they could get away with it. In fact, we've seen that with ""Murder Incorporated"" during the Mafia's golden years.

This film is frightening because human beings who torture and murder others for kicks are REAL, as opposed to space aliens, werewolves, and vampires. I found the storyline, acting, special effects and editing quite good. And most importantly, the film succeeded in scaring me, which is the point of all horror films, after all.

Yes, it is filled with gratuitous violence and gore. This film is definitely not for the squeamish. It's a film about a TORTURE CHAMBER, folks!!! Blood and gore goes with the territory. ""Hostel"" pushes the envelope of gore, so don't watch it if you have a weak stomach. I'm a life-long horror fan, but even I found it hard to watch at times. Most definitely NOT for the kiddies.

The only fault I would find with this film is with a few scenes that were too gratuitous, even for a splatter film. The ""eyeball popping out of the head"" scene, for instance, is the stuff of cheap grade C movies, as is a following scene involving a decapitation by train.

But horror films were never intended to be high art. And those few horror films that attempt to be so ""intellectual"" usually fail miserably to scare anyone. ""Interview With A Vampire"" comes to mind. Slept all the way through that one. You won't sleep through this film, I guarantee you.

The movie started out really great.  Oli had a lot of strength as a character but the movie had a rough transition from three European backpackers into a slaughter fest.  It didn't transition smoothly in my opinion nor was there any particular climax to the movie.  It plateaued with minimal suspense and just stayed at that level before cresting down.  I think if the movie had some sort of CONTEXT and REASON for the events then it would have been more enjoyable.

It was, however, a film about depravity in all sorts of graphic ways.  The detailed, intimate portrayl of human torture had an element of realism to it that made it uncomfortable to watch at times, unlike movies like Saw I & II.

No? Well, it's called the Slippery Slope Theory of Adventure: let's say you're bored, rich, jaded, in search of something funky. You start out with porn: first you're letting the wild rumpus begin to beach pix of Lindsay Lohan, then you're scouting for videos in the wee hours of the morning in stores with their windows taped up, and finally you're arranging private audiences with German acrobats in cellar rooms full of vaseline and studded with plenty of hydraulics.

You follow me? No? My point is: that's the Slippery Slope. The first time, you're wheezing, sweating, panting with excitement. The second time you break a sweat. The third time you're going through the motions, maybe noticing the pattern of the wallpaper.

Still don't follow me? Fine, let's talk about these three idiots---two American, one Icelandic---who get bored of whoring around in Amsterdam and take the advice of a Balkan Svengali to move their tail-chasing to points East: points considerably *far* East, to wit, Slovakia, where War and Horror have left few men, and many hungry women. And if you're American, man, they'll do anything, anything...

OK, let's put away the toothbrush, the chainsaw, and the lighter fluid for a sec, alright?

Once it winds up it's like some kind of mechanized Destroying Angel, but props to Roth for taking his time to wind up this litle outrigger of grimness and grue.

So this is ""Hostel"": the tale of a bunch of drunkenly feral little meat-eaters, happy cannibals, who unwittingly clamber into the cooking pot and get served to even hungrier diners. Or, rather, a madcap escapade of three Strangers in a very Strange Land, Paxon (Jay Hernandez), Josh (the winsome Derek Richardson), & Oli (the egregious Ethor Gundjonsson), who venture East huning fresh meat and find themselves the main course.

All the rest is art, anchored by some damned fine performances and cinematographic witchery: the shriek of the damned in the death-room; the goatish insistence on language barrier as truncheon; the bite of stainless steel through unwitting flesh and bone; the waspish buzz of the chainsaw howling off tile and blood-smeared concrete.

But the real question in Hostel, itself a witches' brew of ""Lonely Planet"" & ""The Most Dangerous Game"", is this: given enough money, and ample privacy, and total security and secrecy---well, would you?

1554914,4,B00005JOQB,"Ok. First a little about where I'm coming from. Wolf Creek, bar none, was the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. So I had strong reservations about getting Hostel. My reservations turned out to be unfounded. If you saw Wolf Creek and were disturbed, Hostel is NOT Wolf Creek. It's much tamer on three important levels.

First. The characters in Hostel are basically shallow and there's no sense of identifying with them which left me with much less emotional investment and reaction than with Wolf Creek.

Second. The torture scenes are not that bad. They are effective but not to the point that you finally say ""enough already!"" There's a good balance. Just when you think it may get TOO dicey, they cut to another scene. Yes they do show a few close ups but they are very quick, like a few seconds. Many scenes are not shown at all. They are assumed by the screaming. There is one eye sequence that I recommend a fast forward. It wasn't emotional for me, just disgusting. Sort of like watching someone eat a worm.

The third thing that separates this movie from Wolf Creek. In Wolf Creek, the murder scenes lasted very long; up to 10 minutes straight sometimes. And the screaming was so realistic, I wanted to jump in the TV and kill the killer. LITERALLY!

With Hostel, it's nothing like that. Roth takes you to another scene within a minute or so. Less in some cases. Couple that with shallow characters and you have a watchable movie.

The GREATEST thing for me was the last 20 minutes of Hostel. In Wolf Creek, the ending generated anger and wanting revenge. No spoiler here. Trust me, you'll like the ending of Hostel.

The scenery is very cool and not overdone. It's E. Europe (xxVakia) yes,  but it's not 'vampirish', nor too dark.' No fog. It is your average former communist state. Gray and drab in many places but with newer colorful scenery too. There are a few street scenes where it's like any other European tourist spot.

Two characters in the movie made me laugh. The cab driver and the janitor. You'll see what I mean.

I'm a DVD collection nut and treat them like any other hobby. You know 'don't touch.' The whole anal thing. Wolf Creek is the first and ONLY movie I have ever thrown in the trash, case and all. I would normally have put it on eBay or filed it away, alphabetically. But I wanted it out of my house and out of my life. With Hostel, I may watch it again.

1554916,5,B00005JOQB,"Amsterdam, one of the funnest places in the world.  Where better to begin our trip?  Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) are two horny young men vacationing through Europe with new friend, Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson).  Staying in a hostel in Amsterdam and accidentally locked out after curfew, they are invited in through the window of a neighboring house by an oddball named Alex (Lubomir Bukovy).

Alex tells the young men of a hostel in Slovakia where the girls will do anything for Americans, so instead of traveling to Barcelona they leave for Bratislava.  When they arrive, they discover they are sharing living quarters with Natalya (Barbara Nedeljakova) and Svetlana (Jana Kaderabkova) who show the boys a good time.  The next morning, Oli is missing.  Paxton and Josh wind out partying again with Natalya and Svetlana while searching for Oli, and they too are separated after becoming extremely drunk ... or drugged.

It is here that this movie takes off, and dips us into the horrors of what the girls call an ""Art Show"" but turns out to be a horrifying nightmare for those whose admittance is free.  It is here in this exclusive ""resort"" that the very wealthy pay enormous sums of money to commit torture and murder on real humans.  (5K RUS, 10K EUR, 25K AMR -- I found it a bit ironic that killing an American cost the most, probably because most of the world hates Americans)

I really loved the way the film corresponded the sleazier sites of Amsterdam (peep-rooms and streets of prostitutes) and utilized it for the titillating grotesqueries inside the warehouse.  Drill bits, hammers, scissors, metal claws, shackles, chainsaws, guns, and hooks.  Chains with hooks are cool.  It doesn't matter if its fishhooks ala Hellraiser or heavy-duty cargo hooks like Ghost Ship; chains and hooks are a meaty favorite of the true horror fan.

Our antiseptic society also craves some nice filth to go with our gore.  There is plenty sludge and muck in 'Hostel'; dirty walls and backed up drains and grimy, stinky goo.  There are rubber gloves, rubber aprons, rubber boots, filthy tools, and cart full of bloody bodies.

Some additional niceties worth mentioning are the street urchins, a bit of automotive revenge, a toilet swirly, the chainsaw finger removal (finger chopping with a chainsaw is much tastier than with a knife) and a very satisfactory ending for the revenge bug in all of us.

I also got a kick out of the janitorial service.  How would you like to clean up that place ... daily?  Of course, methinks the janitors were slackers, it was still messy when they were finished.

For those who like their horror slippery with blood and touched with insanity, 'Hostel' is a must have.  Definitely worth a purchase.  Enjoy!",1151798400,7,2747,4.883369330453564
1554917,4,B00005JOQB,"Welcome to Hostel, where cute, nave American backpackers are gruesomely tortured and killed...at least the girls are gorgeous.

When released, Hostel was characterised by the press - at least in Australia - as little more than a cheap gore-fest. It isn't. Much like another recent release which I have reviewed, Wolf Creek, Hostel is a deeply disturbing and hyper-realistic horror film. Such films, even among the dross which has dominated the genre in recent years, have convinced this horror fan that the form is experiencing a renaissance in quality.

The story sees a pair of endearingly boorish young yanks, with that uniquely adolescent mixture of bravado, awkwardness and limitless sexual appetite, let loose in Amsterdam with their recently-acquired Icelandic companion. While he and the hotter of our two Americans, played by an impeccably cast Jay Hernandez, enjoy what is on offer, the more sympathetic lead has reservations, his horniness tempered by yearnings for his ex and, just maybe, the slightest of moral objections.

But even he cannot resist the promise of carnal delights lying farther to the east, in a ridiculously opulent hostel in small-town Slovakia, no less. There, the boys bed some beautiful women, who are admirably unrestrained in their exhibitionism, the Icelander disappears, and Hostel swings itself - and its chainsaw, scalpel and other implements of torture - into gear. And it doesn't slow down.

Whilst the set-up is a variant of the ""kids wandering into places they shouldn't"" horror clich, it is a certainly a sophisticated one, full of thematic possibilities. Director Eli Roth (who previously directed the iffy Cabin Fever) sensibly leaves these themes to their own devices, concentrating on the chilling narrative and visuals which are almost universally incredible.

The only real gripe I have about the film is the somewhat over-the-top decrepitude, darkness and dirt which characterises the sets used in the torture ""money scenes"". This is becoming a trend, films such as Saw suffer the same evocative extravagance. Less can be more, the backdrops should support the impact of the terrible deeds done within them, not overwhelm it.

This review actually doesn't need to be any longer. If you like his style you should enjoy his 2nd film. Short and Sweet. A must for horror fans!",1151452800,,299,4.454545454545454
1554919,3,B00005JOQB,"The best horror films have a very simple formula and that is have a sustained build up to the shocks, so that they can work effectively. Hostel starts off promisingly enough and shows the sexual adventures of a group of young lads, amidst the clubs of Europe. Hearing of a town in Eastern Europe where apparently anything goes, they head off there in the hope of even more gratifying sexual experiences. Characterisation of these guys is fairly good and when they get to the town, they indeed find the adventure that they are looking for. Unfortunately for them, the town people are also into kidnapping tourists, hikers etc and selling them to an operation being run in a deserted factory where wealthy psychopaths pay for the pleasure of being to able to torture and kill these captives.

The initial shock of going from Rites Of Passage film to an out and out Horror flick is a strong one. The drill torture sequence in particular is horrible to watch..... Unfortunately Roth then throws too much gore into the pot from this point. In fact this gore overload goes beyond being gratuitous to actually being boring at times. The audience has no time to catch their breath but instead is bombarded relentlessly by intensely gruesome imagery, all the way until the end of the film.
Any shock value has become meaningless because of this gore overkill. It is a shame that Quentin Tarantino who oversaw this film, did not edit the end result.

Basically to sum up, a good build up in the first half but then spoilt by a completely OTT and non stop gore fest in the second. At the end of this you have just stopped caring about the characters and the film, and that totally detracts from the revenge sequence at the end. Shame because with better plotting and editing from midway, this could have been a much better film.",1151366400,6,1817,4.6397515527950315

It's hard to understand why Tarantino would so prominently attach his name to Hostel.

Hostel is no Pulp Fiction. Hostel doesn't even come close to the Tarantino-produced 1996 Vampire classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Dusk-Till-Dawn/dp/B00004RJ74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Dusk Till Dawn</a>.

Hostel is a movie about a whole town that doesn't seem to notice that a giant abandoned factory has been converted into a torture chamber where the wealthy pay to mutilate people for fun. Who knew that there was such a demand for this kind of entertainment by the upper echelons of society!?

The story is the simple tale of what happens when a few B-actors acting like B-actors get abducted to be victims for the sadistic masses that patronize the torture factory.

There is gore-o-plenty. If you're into scenes of torture you won't be disappointed here.

All in all, it's a ridiculously conceived plot line with gratuitous gore. The thrills are few...suspense is about a 0. You could watch this movie without sound all the way through and still have the same experience as if the sound is on. The movie is mostly a visual yuck-fest.

The women are there for a reason, they have motives. This is a minor spoiler, so if you don't want to know skip to the next paragraph. The women are there to trap the guys, that is why they use their assets.

The ending to this movie is one of the most satisfying I've seen all year! The revenge is worth the price of admission. I highly recommend this movie to horror fans.",1151107200,4,547,4.160377358490566

It starts out where many other horror movies start out, three horny dudes out for some poontang, but i think Roth tried some different things when he sent them to the whorehouse in amsterdam and showed how one of them had a heart and made you like them. Hell, the first half of the movie was about the blonde one (sorry, i forgot his name), and when he gets kidnapped i thought for sure he would get out, but nope, he gets cut up and stuff. But after all that so called gore, i didn't feel sick or anything these other reviewers called sick. The eye scene wasn't even that gross to me. I could go into all the plot twists and stuff, but if you see it you'll get the idea.

The cast is full of fresh new faces, but it lacks something that could had made it a truly brilliant movie. Some scenes are just pointless and stupid, and while the other scenes in which you are supposed to shock you, lets just say the climax only goes half way. The characters in which you are supposed to feel sorry for, it just happens to soon, which makes you not really give a crap.

Still I do love the idea, I can't say it was a poor attempt at this movie idea in which two backpackers traveling through Europe find themselves as victims in the under world where anything has its price.",1150848000,2,731,4.297101449275362

The story takes place in Amerstam where a group of guys are vacationing. What happens to them is just plain FRIGHTENING. Jay Hernandez is great as the main character who is trying to escape the torture. One of the worst scenes was when Jay Hernandez's character has to cut out an Asian girl's eye. And believe me, it shows everything. This film shows everything and doesn't cut things. I know the film shows so much torture, but you can't help but to watch it with your mouth wide open in shock.

1554985,5,B00005JOQB,"I liked Cabin Fever. It had a dark sense of humor. It didn't take itself too seriously. When I first saw Hostel I wasn't really all that satisfied. It was predictable and the story itself wasn't very original. The violence was pretty cool. I just felt like it could have been better. DISCLAIMER: If you haven't seen this film and would like to, then don't read any further because I am about to give something away. In the end of the movie when he kills the guy he makes the guy look at his reflection before he cuts his throat. Almost as if he knew that is what the guy did to his friend. How could he possibly know this though. It was too much to have been just a coincidence. That was giving him a taste of his own medicine. That question immediately popped into my head when it happened and it nagged at me. If I actually found anything wrong with this film at all it was that. The second time I watched the movie I really enjoyed it. Eli is trying to generate some good scares that aren't cheap like the ones you see in films nowadays and I think he is successful here. I have never been to slovakia and after seeing this film I know I never will go. If Eli can do that to a person then I think he accomplished something. I probably wouldn't have gone to slovakia anyways but I think you get my point.

  Now, the first half of the film on the border of soft core porn. That could have been cut down just a little. that is the only reason that I give this four stars. Other than that I recommend this movie to anyone that likes blood and violence in film. There is enough here for you to get your fill.",1150761600,3,1607,4.127795527156549

Meanwhile, you get to know the three characters' vices well enough to dislike them, but you can't help laughing at their adventures and finally being won over by their basically good (if horny and druggy) nature.  Looking for even hotter women and cheaper drugs, they are talked by a chance acquaintance (his roommate is having soft-core sex with an attractive nude woman throughout their conversation) into travelling to Bratislava.  Where in heck is Bratislava? In Hell. It does exist, and Slovakia functions for this movie and for ""Eurotrip"" what Eastern Europe did for Dracula and the Prisoner of Zenda - another world, where anything beautiful or evil is possible.  They enter the titular hostel and find two gorgeous women dressing in their room who invite them to a health spa where first they see a topless beauty lounging and then a shapely bikinied brunette walking away from them and a completely nude blonde goddess walking towards them.  Our heroes have come to Sex Shangri-la; even the dopey, socially inept Josh scores with a beauty queen.  Josh really isn't a bad dude, we now know, and Paxton tell us of his nightmares about a little girl drowning in Lake Michigan.  They become likable as we get to know them and the two Asian girls they befriend.  Then they begin to disappear and ...

The films premise is, at least, interesting. A Hostel in a Slovakian city is a jumping-off point for nightclubs, sexual encounters, drugs ...and murder. The hostel owners are secretively helping a select group of the rich and demented. These wealthy and twisted individuals pay to kill people, and an ""art house"" on the outskirts of town acts as the facilitator of horrors. For those unweary travelers who happen to fall victim to the wiles of the hostel owners, ending up drugged only to reawaken in Hell on Earth is a gruesome and life-ending discovery.

Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and his friends Josh (Derek Richardson) and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are three college students traveling through Europe. They stop at this hostel and are quickly enraptured with a couple of young women who have an appetite for sex. Once fully involved with these women, the boys begin dropping off one by one.

1555054,5,B00005JOQB,"I watched this film one night on an ""off"" mood, AND all by myself which didn't help.  I guess I witnessed something deeper than what alot of other people saw in ""Hostel"".  It's not your average horror flick where you want all the characters to die and get it good.  By the time things went ""south"" in ""Hostel"", I sort of ""cared"" about the 3 tourists guys and the 2 Japanese tourist girls.  This film touches a primal nerve in anyone who is human, if you feel deeply about humanity and all that stuff. I did not expect ""Hostel"" to become an evil, witchy, and sadistic film (which it did, and took it's sweet time about it).  There was a realness I haven't quite seen captured in horror films and I don't know how they did it.  Maybe because ""Hostel"" flips the script on you, and taps into human fraility and vulnerablity which we all possess.  It exploits all of our weaknesses.  There was an understated sadness throughout the film, you could sort of see it in the characters eyes.  You  feel disconnected and lost when they are in Amsterdam and even more disarrayed when they make the journey to the hostel from hell.  It was eirie and surreal when they arrive there and just got more bizarre and disheartening as the film went along.  Alot of people say it wasn't bloody or gory enough.  I think the psychological mind f*@#$ is worse than  typical movie FX.  They show just enough to make you crawl inside your own skin and want to die there. I have never in all my life had to literally hit the stop button and end a movie out of pure ""fear"" or ""sickness"".  I had to turn it off after the white guy got it.  Unfortunately,  I have yet to see the rest of the film but have heard alot through hearsay.  After I turned it off, I paced around my house for an hour and sort of began having mild ""panic attacks"".  I ended up having to wake up my roomate and explain what was happening.  Since then I have calmed down but I still intend to watch the rest of it.  I would like to say I absolutely hated ""Hostel"", but instead I have to say this film literally did what no other film has done to me.  It made me think about it days afterwards.  I would like to say the director and ALL of the actors did an incredible job.  They made this film beyond memorable, so good for them.

1555055,3,B00005JOQB,"""Hostel"" is an interesting little movie and definitely a step up from Eli Roth's ""Cabin Fever"", which was pretty disappointing after all that hype. Watching ""Hostel"", it made me temporarily reassess my desires for going to Amsterdam in all honesty. I love the setup for this film and it's actually pretty scary to think about it from the perspective of the protagonists. I think the movie loses steam about two thirds into it and becomes kind of goofy in a way but it works really well as an exploitation piece and a general horror movie. It's not the most gruesome movie I've ever seen but it gets pretty rough at times. Definitely worth a watch for the gorehounds.

This unrated cut is not much different from what I remember the theatrical version to be. This whole trend of releasing a movie on DVD as an unrated cut kind of bites, personally speaking. Damn marketing ploys...

Anyway, this DVD has nice picture and sound and a fair amount of extras (four commentaries is kind of ridiculous for a movie like this but... whatever), including a nice little trio of behind the scenes featurettes that show some of the more interesting aspects of the whole production.

At first it looked as if I was right about the plot as the entire first half of the movie is like soft-core porn(there are some pretty hot ladies in this by the way) and the second half at first seems to be just gratuitous torture, dismembering, etc.  But watch a little longer and keep an open mind and there is an actual plot.  The movie isn't scary in the classic sense of being afraid to turn out the lights or to go outside after dark but scary and disturbing in the sense that there could quite possibly be some sick, bored and wealthy people paying to do this to people somewhere in the world, maybe even here in the USA.  The last time I felt as disturbed after watching a movie as I did after Hostel was Seven.  Difference is Seven didn't show the actual deeds being done, Hostel does.  There also seems to be sort of a social commentary running in the background.  The tourists are interested in blowing there money on weed and sex to get their kicks, while at the same time the wealty men who have gotten bored with being able to have any luxury they want are blowing there money on people to torture and murder to get their kicks.  Also it's interesting to note that the Americans bring a higher price since they seem to be in higher demand to kill.  I want say this is a great movie but better than expected.

Eli Roth, who was at the screening, mentioned to the audience that this was the first public viewing in North America. He also told us what we were about to see was a work in progress print of the film. What I saw was one hell of a fierce horror flick that works on every level.

All the actors do a great job in this flick. I was especially impressed with Jay Hernandez, and Derek Richardson, two relatively unknown actors. There are a lot of funny scenes, and dialog in the early parts of the film. It's not that slapstick, forced stuff that was so prevalent in Cabin Fever. There also lots of nudity in the early parts in the film as well. When things begin to turn towards horror, you truly feel the sense of terror the characters are going through. The build up to the climax is just done so well. I loved the fact the story is very believable.

Make no mistake about it, this is a violent, sick, and gory flick. It's not for the squeamish. I haven't seen this type of extreme violence in a North America mainstream cinema. The Takashi Miike, and Asian Cinema influences are clearly seen here.

This is a film that will shock people, and remain in there heads well after the film is over. It will be interesting to see how the film is edited, and rated. In it's current state, I don't see how it could get anything less than the dreaded NC-17 rating. I just hope that it's not butchered too much, as the audience deserves to see the film how it was intended. Eli Roth has completely redeemed himself for what I thought was a very poor film in Cabin Fever, and has made one kick-ass horror film.",1149379200,4,1869,4.362068965517241

I mean, Im a 25 year old woman, and of course was offended by the charators crude sexual desires, but when  a friend told me they deserved what happened to them, i said ""they weren't murderes or pedophiles , they were just horny tourists!!!""  They were guys on vacation, in a liberating country where they could pay to do anything, little did they know while they were paying to have things to them sexually, there were business men paying to do things to them, by means of torture and killing.  The concept of the movie is genius, and you have to think of it that way, Eli Roth and Tarintino wanted to shock people by providing a movie like no other. Mission accomplished, soft porn and gore aside, the movie had an interested story, some pretty decent acting (most of the time) and even though i shut my eyes for the a good majority of the scenes, i still appreciated the essence of the movie.

I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie with more nudity or gore than Hostel. It is not a movie at all, in fact, because a movie implies that there is a plot and that you are entertained. If you consider people screaming at the top of their lungs to be a choir, Hostel is for you. If you consider the dropping of a paint can, and the resulting splatter to be art, Hostel is for you. If you consider punching another to be a viable form of expressive affection, Hostel is for you. If you want heroin legalized in America, Hostel is for you. If disemboweling people is erotic to you, buy Hostel today! I am serious. That is how disgusting this movie is. The scenes are beyond shocking, and completely sickeing. I am glad my wife didn't watch, for she would have tossed up her dinner.

Seriously, Hostel is over the edge and sickening. I am nearly forty and have seen my share of gore and horror movies, but this nearly made me sick. There was endless vomit, limbs being cut off, eyes being clipped out, etc. That is all that Hostel was: a torture movie. People torturing others, literally. This is not a date movie, nor is it a horror movie. It is really not a movie at all. Hostel is a sick fantasy for those who like extreme sex and violence together.

Do not watch Hostel. The scenes linger in your mind for days, and you wish you could shake them. Hostel is disgusting and brutal This is the sickest film I have ever seen, and will never give my money to this director's movies again.

Some have mentioned how bloody and violent this movie is, I've been watching horror films my whole life and I've seen bloodier and more violent films than this one. Alot of the violence occures off camera, what little you do get to see has been done a million times before in other films. In other words, the torture is not seen. Even in the 'Unrated' version. It is implied. My point is that if you want to see this for the gore you will be dissapointed. Only those not used to seeing these kind of films will find this bloody and horrifying. Those of you that have seen other gore films will find this stuff lite.

Others have mentioned the sex in the beginning of the film. What sex? If it had at least that I would have given it a higher rating!

1555122,1,B00005JOQB,This Movie was pretty unrealistic.  I can't imagin that the amount of people involved  in the capturing of people to be tortured and killed in the movie would ever happen in real life. It seems the whole town is in on it.  It might have been believeable to have just one or two people in on the capture and torture of tuorists but i can't believe that so many people would condone the killing if inocent human beings...especially the girl who just stands there and laughs as the final boy is captured.  Completely unbelieveable.  The movie made me laugh several times from this.  Could have been an interesteing movie but the lack of character development and unbelievability made me loose interest.  Not to mention the fact that the 3 boys are so annoying and such complete jerks that it makes u not even really care about bad things happening to them.,1149379200,,853,4.6092715231788075

I wasn't expecting much from this film cause I didn't hear a big round of praise for it. However, I felt this film got better with every passing minute. Hostel is an intense tense film. It is probably the most bloody film I have seen but what I liked more about the film was it's edge of the seat disorderly unconscious screenplay. I must say it was worth my time. Watch this film if only you think you can stomach it and not be a short attention span dilletante. This is not like Saw and it doesn't try to be SAW. Is it better than SAW? Despite the difference in genres, NO. Anyway, watch it, forget what critics say.

1555124,1,B00005JOQB,"Hostel is a terrible movie. It involves a couple of young Americans and one Icelander backpacking through Europe. They spend time in Amerstdam hitting the hash bars and bagging the local girls. Locked out of the local hostel one night, they meet a man who tells them about a town in Slovakia that has a lot of beautiful willing women for their pleasure. Eagerly they head out for adventure.

When they arrive at the town it's not like the Western European cities, but a rundown community from the post-Soviet ruled era. When they arrive at the local hostel, they meet several women. The women show them a great time, only to be set up and eventually kidnapped. They end up in a murder for profit business. These wealthy psychos pay large sums of money to torture and murder people.

Like every horror movie, one of the victims escapes and goes on a revenge spree. This is were the movie falls apart.

The problem I have this movie it wasn't believable. I found myself snickering in several gory scences. It wasn't scary at all and the character development was non-existent.

Why on earth Tarantino would lend his name for this turkey is beyond me?",1149292800,,1148,4.640394088669951
1555125,4,B00005JOQB,"The first thing that surprised me about this movie was the solid acting. It seems like acting is an afterthough in horror these days.

The plot was original. Two Americans go on a backpacking trip of Europe. They meet another chap doing the same thing and he joins them. The trio are on the hunt for beautiful women, and are told another town has a stock-pile of them. The three of them travel to the town where super-model-type women are available by the dozens, and are overly willing to party with the 3 backpackers. One of the men vanishes. Then another. All of a sudden it becomes clear that things are not what they seem.

The film does not become grusome until over half way thru. But when its hits, hold on to your seats. This movie has some of the nastiest scenes ever. Cordless drills, Chain saws, and welding equipment are all used on helplessly handcuffed victims. Blood is everywhere.

This film will go over well with the Saw crowd. I was fairly impressed with it.",1149292800,5,978,4.5141242937853105

1555128,2,B00005JOQB,"I have an idea of what witer/director Eli Roth was probably going for here; nevertheless, this film is a huge disappointment. It seems that the story of three heterosexual, misogynistic, and extremely brash young men (2 of which are American) who venture to Europe looking for beer, clubs, and lots of sex is trite at best.

As explained by previous reviews- -these three men travel throughout Europe, constantly getting drunk and trying to holla at foreign women while pissing everyone else off with their arrogant, churlish behavior. That is, until the three main characters are told about Slovakia, a land where the men are few, the children travel in weird little hoards of weapon-carrying, psychotic beggars, and the women supposedly go crazy for Americans. Once they arrive in Slovakia, our would-be heroes are seduced by several attractive, libidinous women...only to be set-up, kidnapped, and inexplicably tortured by an unknown organization.

Well, as mentioned earlier, I think Eli Roth was trying to portray the whole what-comes-around-goes-around/careful what you wish for theme. In other words, the main characters only see those around them (especially the women) as mere objects to be used and thrown away. But the tables are quickly turned when the three protaganists are captured and tortured by wealthy sadists as a twisted, cruel form of amusement.

However, the problem is- -the characters aren't developed well enough to really pull this off. While the three men are mostly jerks, their dispositions aren't deplorable enough for the viewer to enjoy their demise, nor are any of them kind/relatable enough to offer them pity. Thus, the viewer is left with a sense of ambivalence towards the film's conclusion- -one can't feel all that passionate about the prospect of the main characters being killed, or of them even escaping and/or exacting vengeance on their tormentors.

Overall, the plot is a little inane- -sort of like a wannabe ""Girls Gone Wild"" meets ""House of a Thousand Corpses"" storyline. I mean...why is it so hard for contemporary horror-makers to realize that special effects combined with a bunch of superfluous, gory scenes doesn't necessarily make for a good horror film? In fact, the only time I was ever truly interested was when one of the characters was being tortured. As a horror fan, the scariness/gore content is intensely enjoyable at these moments. However, shock value alone never makes a movie. In the end, I suggest renting this film or even waiting till it comes on HBO- -under no circumstances should anyone buy this movie.",1148947200,3,2576,5.155502392344498
1555204,1,B00005JOQB,"There is an extremely funny Internet Flash-animation series called ""Retarded Animal Babies,"" wherein our titular characters drink, swear, do things of an outrageously sexual nature, and sometimes meet gory deaths; it's easily the most hilarious animated series out there, and possesses an understated intelligence and razor-sharp satire that probably goes unnoticed by most of its viewers.  Every time an episode loads, as the 'KB' tally increases towards being fully loaded, a separate countdown beneath it shows the viewer's IQ rapidly decreasing.  ""Hostel"" is a movie that carries much in common with that latter countdown; in a way, it is the cinematic equivalent of mental retardation--the more you watch, the dumber you become.  This is the latest offesive, over-hyped piece of trash from the talentless Eli Roth (who also gave us the inexplicably--and unjustly--successful dung heap, ""Cabin Fever""), whose incredible popularity will always be an infuriating mystery to me (just seeing that snapshot of him amongst the 'Masters of Horror' directors makes my stomach turn).  Any attempt at a plot synopsis is pretty superficial in the nihilistic world of ""Hostel""--we have a group of homophobic, rock-stupid, jock-like American guys backpacking through Europe when they run afoul of nude, loose females who find idiocy an irresistible aphrodisiac.  Anyway, our femme fatales transport our boys to a dank, bowels-of-hell warehouse (complete with poor lighting!) where they are tortured and murdered by a bunch of wealthy businessmen who get their kicks from killing.  Like ""Retarded Animal Babies,"" ""Hostel"" tries to inject some satire into its poisonous blood, but doesn't have an ironic bone in its body--Roth fogs up the screen with so much prurient flesh and gratuitous gore that any 'message' is muddled at best.  The film is an out-of-control mess of unfunny, barn-door 'humor,' blood-caked squalor, and juvenile masturbational fantasy.  We never build any sympathy for our completely unlikable 'protagonists,' and therefore cannot care all that much as they are drilled, dissected, and disfigured; some might argue that that is the whole Point, but I didn't even find myself applauding their deaths...instead, an icy detachment washed over me.  I wound up being neither impressed nor horrified by whatever gore effect Roth would throw in my face next--his craftsmanship is so poor and his overall tone so unbalanced that it's impossible to look at ""Hostel"" as anything more than a monument of ineptitude that doesn't even succeed in a so-bad-it's-good way.  Mr. Roth proved himself a fluke with the inexplicable success of ""Cabin Fever,"" but when something as grotesque and tasteless as ""Hostel"" rakes in millions and gets a heavy DVD promo push, it speaks volumes for not only America's bankrupt morality in finding 'thrills' in such rancid material, but how complacent we are in accepting such things.  If you think this crap is 'revolutionary,' check out ""Cannibal Holocaust"" or ""Salo: 120 Days of Sodom"" to see commentary and horror blended with a relative degree of success.",1148774400,13,3090,5.3768115942028984
1555205,4,B00005JOQB,"In his treatise on horror, ""Danse Macabre,"" Stephen King establishes the genre exists on three more or less separate levels with ""terror on top, horror below it, and lowest of all, the gag relex of revulsion."" In the wake of ""Saw,"" and with ""Wolf Creek"" and now ""Hostel,"" it seems clear to me that we are in the heyday of the low card in that particular set. The goal is to make the weak flee the room, before or after they throw up, and to make the strong put their hands over their eyes, but still sneak a peak through their fingers.

""Hostel"" is what writer-director Eli Roth did with the freedom Lion Gates Film gave him after his success with ""Cabin Fever."" As you probably know, hostels, usually called youth hostels, are what young people use when they are backpacking around Europe. As you can easily anticipate, ""hostel"" is real close to ""hostile,"" so you can easily anticipate that this is going to be about one of those places where kids check in, but they do not check out. Paxton (Jay Hernandez), Josh (Derek Richardson), and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are backpacking across Europe, but have only made it as far as Amsterdam and are only having a good time and not a great time. Then they are told about a hostel near Bratislava in Slovakia where women will have sex with any guy with an American accent. Since Paxton and Josh are from the United States, they immediately head for Bratislava so they can have sex.

Now, at this point the idea that the three are going to die horrible deaths sounds like a good thing, because we are talking two Ugly Americans and a freak from Iceland. These people are asking for it and the only fly in the ointment is that Roth delivers on the horrible deaths to the point that we are forced to admit that even these people do not deserve what happens to them. ""Hostel"" really has two distinct halves, with the European sex trip that opens the film giving way to the giant torture sequences. Roth even toys with his audience, relying on a combination of suggestions and screams to get you squirming, not to mention thinking that maybe you are not going to really see the gross stuff, and then he starts showing you the gross stuff. At this point no not feel terror, forget about feeling horror, and just go right for the revulsion.

Even though it really takes too long to get to the blood and gore, and even though the film ends up taking its foot off the pedal at the end, I rounded up on ""Hostel"" for one reasons. That was because when I got to the point where both I as a viewer and the last character standing were wondering what the hell was going on, Roth came up with an answer that rather that surprised me (""Hostel"" is actually inspired by soemthing that really happens, albeit in the Far East rather than Eastern Europe). I even felt more horror than revlusion as well.

In terms of the current crop of revulsion films, there is s more blood and gore in ""Hostel"" than in either ""Saw"" or ""Wolf Creek,"" but that is due in part to the fact the cast of this movie is several time larger. The other key distinction is that while ""Hostel"" obviously is set up for a sequel, which Roth is working on this year, it is really the only one of these films to offer any sort of catharsis in the end. That actually works against this type of film, and you might be surprised that ""Hostel"" is the most lighthearted of the three. So ""Saw II"" has the best squirming scene with the pit o' hypodermics, ""Wolf Creek"" will leave you the most empty, and ""Hostel"" will give you the most blood and laughs.

It's the sum of the parts (no pun intended).

Tarantino creates a slow developing sense of trouble and paranoia. It builds from earlier in the film than is suspected and continues til the climax.

The plot has been gone over here in other reviews so I won't go into detail there. However, Tarantino has brought a polished product to the genre.

What really sets this apart is that there is no supernatural elements and no psychotics weilding a knife. The 'Elite Hunting Club' is something that everyday people who can afford to buy their services belong to, just like belonging to a country club.

The acting, sets, lighting and music all come together with a slick, fast moving story line that is at once believable.

What is most frightening about this movie is that it could really be happening!

Definitely not for the squemish! Typical buckets of blood splash across the screen. But, if you're up for a true roller coaster ride and being riveted to the screen and gripping your chair... I highly recommend this thriller. It is sure to become a classic!",1147824000,3,1273,4.707207207207207

A lot of movies try to copy the gruesome scenes from SAW and the violence of The Devil's Rejects. Some accomplish this in an entertaining way (Hostel) and some scare the [...] out of you (Wolf Creek).

Hostel is not very believable at times. The characters and situations were a little too extreme to really believe. Still, the idea is so fascinating that people would want to kill for fun, that you just hang on for the ride.

The concept of Hostel was based on true events and Roth has shown he can write an entertaining movie. The final half hour was so cool, that I have to believe Tarantino had an influence on how the movie wrapped up.

This movie would have been labeled a video nasty ten years ago, due to its graphic content and lack of any believable dialogue. Films that create suspense do so by excellent acting, imaginative cinematography , good direction, the power of suggestion and dramatic musical score , this film lacks all of the aforementioned!

1555276,3,B00005JOQB,"""Hostel"" is quite a step up from ""Cabin Fever"" for writer/director Eli Roth.  He seems to take his characters and their development quite a bit more serious than in his previous effort.  I actually felt some attachment to Jay Hernandez' character once he realizes what's happening in this tale.  With that said, however, I wouldn't rank ""Hostel"" among the top thrillers or horror flicks in the genre.

First off, just having a lot of gore and blood pumped on to the screen doesn't make a film scary.  Many of today's horror fanatics seem to believe that, but those are the same people who cut their teeth on ""horror"" like the ""Scream"" series and the later, lesser ""Friday The 13th"" and ""Halloween"" sequels.  Introduce these same people to films such as the original and remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" and they'll get a little better dose of terror.  These films actually had terror and suspense in them coupled with the gore.  In my opinion, gore is nothing more than icing on the cake.  I've seen plenty of gory films that weren't even as scary as ""Jurassic Park.""

Another thing that drops ""Hostel"" down a notch is that it lacks a true hero or heroine in the story.  Sure, Hernandez does attempt to save a fellow torture victim, but before all of this his a typical, American butthole.  You know these types of people, they believe that the world is their oyster and mommy and daddy will always be there to bail them out.  Though Hernandez' character does sort of capture me in the end, he just isn't a likeable enough character who I'd want to cheer on.  In fact, his friend played by Derek Richardson is a more likeable guy.

Some of the finer points of this flick include the fact that there is no one bad guy.  The baddies are folks wealthy enough to pay to torture and kill someone for their own pleasure.  None of these characters are of the enjoyable type.  One of the sickest sequences in the film isn't someone being dismembered, but it's the interaction between Hernandez and a soon-to-be torturer describing how great the rush is of offing somebody.  The guy has no remorse or concern in his eye, just the urge to feed his addiction.

I also enjoyed how Roth constantly tipped off the viewer of the impending doom for the primary characters.  Slight looks to each other, creepy train passengers, and even the gloominess of Slovakia all pose as wonderful harbingers of what is to come.

In the end, we have a solid attempt by Roth to seek out the bowels of mankind.  He almost attains it, but focuses too much on gore and leaves the solid and potentially great plotline to drown in a pool of its own blood.

Recommended to fans of the gore genre and Roth's first flick, ""Cabin Fever.""",1147478400,,2702,4.58125

Other than that this piece of junk will give you nothing because it is about nothing and is a complete waste of time to watch or waste of money should you decide to purchase it.

You can not expect anything out of it except perhaps mixed emotions.

Nevertheless it is very hard to not to believe that this movie is just a dumb propagandistic outrage. Especially for those to whom Slovakia is the mother land. How otherwise would one explain why most of the shooting was done in Czech Republic while the movie says it is in Slovakia? It may also convince less knowledgeable audience that once foreign visitors make it through the border they will most likely get laid by horny domestic females waiting for nothing more than western cocks.

Complete, full-on, full-frontal nudity, and one point there's a full-on rear-view of a chicks ""sneepur"". The first 30 minutes is wall to wall tit & ass.

For me it was the suspense that made the film, and anyone who watched the film without an overcritical eye would definitely agree to the fact that it was full of it. I think the storyline was very intriguing and I am definitely going to purchase the DVD edition. I honestly don't see why the low ratings are so avid.... I mean, did someone get their heart broken by one of the actors and get all their high school friends to come online and say how LAME the movie was? lol... Seriously though. This was a very interesting storyline and the suspense was fascinating to me. I think the writer did a great job of connecting the actors to the audience, meaning... I was cheering for the actor to find out what was going on, to escape, to out-wit, etc... The characters were absolutely layered, meaning the writers/producers did an Excellent job of giving these characters many colors and unveiling them to us in perfect timing. The complexity of the characters to me is near brilliant. Not too many movies can pull off such layered events... I mean, everything turns around so dramatically, yet the audience isn't thrown into the climax with a ""what the hell just happened?"" kinda feeling, one that many movies of this genre create.  Maybe there were some scenes that were a little ""overdramatic"" (I.E. the girls eyeball hanging out... ew...) but, overall, I was impressed with this film. And I'm not giving 4 stars for moral value! The torturing of people does not ""excite"" nor ""thrill"" me. I'm giving 4 stars because they did a good job on the film, the suspense of it accounts for most of that.

I think I'd rather be one of the victims than sit through this movie again.  I'll spare the details as I'm sure they've been rehashed to death, but... the entire movie was just a mess.  The first half was slow and boring, with uninteresting characters.  The second half, while fully living up to its blood feast promise, failed to shock or terrify.  Note to Eli Roth: Graphic torture scenes do not automagically equate to frightening, or even disturbing, when there is no emotional attachment to the characters.  It's just... ""eh"".  It's not that I'm numb to the violence... SAW disturbed me greatly, as have several other gory pictures, but, there was a connection with the  protagonists that just wasn't there in ""Hostel,"" with the exception of Kana.

or... the same movie you saw in the theater.

Waaaaaaaaay disappointed here. Not only in the edition of the movie... but in Eli Roth for not going all out on this one. If this is the real-deal movie that was SOOOOOOO bad that it was almost unmarketable... or whatever.... then the MPAA is really weird. It means they made him cut 2 seconds of footage to get an R. Jeez. Grow some, people.

Not only does this ""special edition"" skimp on the gore and violence, but it also skimps BIIIIIIIIIIIIG time on the extras. One multi-angle filming sequence... one pretty long featurette, and a few commentary tracks... one with Harry Knowles from Aintitcoolnews.com....

If anything they shoulda paid me for having to listen to that meaty geek spout sleazy fanboy lines at Eli Roth. Ugh. He mentions that he was the inspiration for Roth coming up with the idea of the movie because he had been looking online for sites where you could pay to kill people. The thought of that giant slug-beast breathing heavily whilst snapping away at the keyboard looking for sites where you can pay to kill asians is scarier than any horror film i've ever seen... Jeez.

I'm guessing there's gonna be an ultra-special edition down the road soon. Utterly typical.

Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie greatly... no matter the rating. It was the idea to me that was more disturbing and horrific than the gore ever could be. If you're a hardcore gorehound though, this one just aint gonna do ya... go rent a Fulci film instead.

1555340,1,B00005JOQB,"I will be brutally honest with you. I hated the movie. I'd been told that it was a 'must see', but I wouldn't recomend it to just anyone. If you go for the mindless violence and torture thing, then by all means, go buy this movie, you'll love it.

Storyline? Not bloody likely. The storyline as I saw it was this: Go to Europe, get laid, get drunk, get tortured. Yeah, that's how the movie goes.

It's these two friends that go to Europe on break, looking for a good time. In one of the countries they visited, they met this thrid guy that agreed to show them around Europe. So now we have three guys, going to all these European countries, looking for one thing: A good time.

They get a tip off about a place where the women go insane for American blood, and they head on down there, to a town/place called Hostel. Hence the name of the movie. While there, the meet some people, mostly women. Then out of the blue (or so it seems), their European friend just up and disappears with an Asian female, leaving them alone.

That is the beginning of a downward spiral of insanity. People seem to be just up and checking out of the hotel left and right, then the Americans get split up, and one of them is abducted.

He wakes up in a dark room and a bright new world of pain. The American tourist is being tortured by some rich guy that can't figure out a better way to spend a couple grand and an hour of his life.

The guy's best friend somehow gets taken to the place where his friend is being held and is the knock out cold. He also wakes up later on to his own little world of agony.

The whole point of this movie is pain and torture.

I do not recomend it, although maybe it's just that I wasn't in the right mood when I saw it.

1555341,4,B00005JOQB,"Hostel is a horror produced by Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill), directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever), and starring Jay Hernandez (Carlito's Way: Rise To Power), and Derek Richardson (Dumb And Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd).

You've heard the story before, so I'll just recap: Hernandez and Richardson play two Americans who, while vacationing in Europe, get stuck in the most gruesome and terrifying experience one can ever imagine. Along with an Icelandic buddy they met during their trip, they are lured to a town right outside Bratislava in Slovakia where the girls will presumably give in to any guy who speaks with an American accent. They meet two attractive locals, and later find themselves chained in a horrifying chamber where men dressed up as surgeons pay to committ random acts of torture.

Before watching Hostel, I was hesitant in forcing myself to watch a movie I knew would probably make me nauseous, but to be honest, it wasn't all that bad as they make it out to be.

Even though I found Hostel a bit flawed, the idea of the movie is original, the execution is accurate with all the gore and disgust, and the act of revenge in the ending is refreshing...all within 94 minutes of running time.

1555344,4,B00005JOQB,"2 Americans and an Icelander are in Amsterdam having a good time. Then this guy  tells them about hot chicks, who will do anything, in eastern europe. They then go their and start to party with hot chicks. Then the Icelandic guy disappears and then one of the Americans. You find out that people in this town capture tourists take them to an old factory and rich people come their and pay to kill them. The other American gets caught but escapes and rescues a woman he met earlier and they both try to escape the town who all seem to know about what's going on.
  The first half of the movie has nudity and it doesn't start to get gory until the second half. You see people getting sliced up, shot, runover and you even get to see some guys getting their heads smashed in by rocks, which is something that is usually left to the imagination.
  There were many mistakes made like when one of the Americans is speaking German in Amsterdam and they are speaking it back to them when they actually speak Dutch there. But on the other hand German is a very popular language in Europe. Also the country that they go to is pretty run down and they watch really old T.V.'s and drive really old cars and the characters are speaking a different language than is actally spoken there. Those mistakes don't bother me because it's a movie but it should be cleared up on a comantary or something so that people don't get the wrong impression about Europe.
  The only thing that I thought was scary was that there probably are places like this wheter in Eastern Europe or America or anywhere else. Where people will pay to kill someone.
  What little gore they did show was okay looking except for a guy who gets his fingers chopped off because you could easily tell that his hand was fake. I liked how the torture place resembled the prostitute place in the begining in that you have all these rooms lined up where people pay to do things. I also liked when the American started to kill some of his captors to escape but then he kills some others for revenge without a second thought which he probaly wouldn't have done before this ordeal. One problem is the ending because it left me wondering what he was going to do when he got home like does he go to the cops and do the bad guys get caught?",1146700800,4,2281,4.348235294117647

1555346,4,B00005JOQB,"So, what's the big deal with this Hostel movie you've been hearing so much about lately?  Well, it's a big deal coz horror films like this don't tend to make their way into the mainstream much.  In fact, I wouldn't say Hostel is a horror film in the traditional sense, but considering the subject matter, what other category would you put in in?  It's horror in the same way that Last House On The Left is horror in that you get people senselessly tortured and killed, and a little revenge thrown in at the end.  Everyone who hated this film is very quick to point out that ""it wasn't even scary"".  Well, lets cut through the B.S. for a moment.  Since you were a child, have you really seen a movie that was actually scary?  I know I certainly haven't.  Entertaining, yes.  Creepy?  Disturbing?  Yes.  But no movie has ever made me afraid to walk around my home in the dark.  No, Hostel isn't scary, but it is disturbing.  All the tough guys out there are also quick to point out that it's not as gory as it's reputation would have you believe.  True, it's no Cannibal Holocaust, but we are talking about a mainstream film here.  Horror fans won't see gore they haven't seen before, but folks who occasionally dabble in mainstream horror films will probably get a smack in the face with this film.  I think the gore was in an acceptable amount, and handled well.  A movie packed with gore , while entertaining, is far from scary and usually becomes a parody.  Peter Jackson's Dead Alive is a no holds barred gorefest, but the film's hilarious.  Hostel tries to treat it's violence seriously.  The reactions to the violence from the main characters are realistic-they react with terror, disgust and pain.  While the acting from the leads in this film won't get oscars, you have to admire how well they switch from dumb comedy stereotypes to frightened helpless human beings.  Their lameness in the first 45 minutes is almost forgiven.  If these same characters were in a slasher flick, you'd be rootin' for their deaths and cheer when they came.  The intensity of their performances in the torture chamber are good enough that they become human, and while you don't actually care for them exactly(this is only a movie after all, it's not like they're in any real danger) , you don't really want to see them die this way.  The film does a decent job with suspense in the first hour when the guys are starting to catch wind that something wrong is happening.  In fact, the buildup is actually better than the payoff.  The actual torture chamber scenes only take up about ten minutes of the film.  After escaping his room, the main character tries to find his way out of the building(the overall look of the factory is actually quite stellar).  Some decent suspense here, but it kinda plays out like a stealth mission from a video game like Manhunt or Hitman.  Once out, the guy gets the Charles Bronson bug and wants to get a bit of revenge.  This was cool also.  Considering this character was the wisecracker of the bunch, it's neat to see him so serious for the rest of the film.  It would have been so easy to have him deliver some smartass comment to his assailants, and that would have been awful.  Most likely it would have happened that way too if it had been a bigger production.  Folks seem to think the ending was a letdown as well.  Well, I guess every film can't end with a big explosion and twenty minute chase through the streets of Slovakia, which I'm sure Jerry Schmuckheimer would have provided if this was his production.  The ending may have been anticlimatic, but it seemed more realistic to me.  In fact, anyone who would escape such an ordeal would simply run away and not look back, and not even bother messing with the torture people anymore.  The only big mistake Roth made was with that gang of little kids who kill a couple of guys when payed in candy.  This was actually quite stupid and ruined what up to that point was a serious film.  Overall, Hostel is actually a good film when you consider the current state of mainstream horror films.  There's no MTV/Attention Defecit Disorder style editing, and thank God it's not a remake of a great classic horror film.  The humor was more miss than hit if you ask me.  I've also never been a big fan of sex and nudity.  Folks  who hate this seem to always point out the nudity as a redeeming quality to the film, but I always figured if a movie sucked it sucked, nudity or not.  I can't watch a bad film even if it's wall to wall breasts.  Yes, it was a bit excessive in the sex department.  If I want nudity, there are other types of films I prefer to see it in(they're usually in the back of the video store and come in black dvd cases kept behind the counter).  It's certainly not a film I would purchase, but I'd have no problem with watching it again.  Best horror film we'll see come out of the mainstream for awhile.",1146700800,,4894,4.459977452085682

1555348,3,B00005JOQB,"HOSTEL comes to us from Eli Roth, the man who also gave us CABIN FEVER.  Like that film, this one spares little when it comes to some gutwrenching gore.  The movie is almost sadistic in its terrifying view of torture and death and dismemberment.

Three backpackers in Amsterdam learn from a native about the available girls in Slovakia who will do ANYTHING for money.  On the train, they meet a weird older man whose identity is secretive but he plays an important role in the movie.  Roth wisely keeps the pace slow in the beginning to give us a chance to familiarize ourselves with the trio, but once the bloodletting starts, it's frenetically suspenseful.

Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson give very good performances as the two Americans, and one has to question one's own tolerance in viewing such a decadently ""sick"" film.

I was more interested in the self-proclaimed ""most horrifying movie"" and how it was supposed to be so scary.  However, the movie is not scary but yes it is horrifying due to its story.  It tries to develop the plot where one can pay an incredible amount of cash to fulfill their hack and slash animal side at the expense (and pain) of tourists.  Yes we all know that humans can be utterly merciless but there are more dramatic ways of reflecting this on the screen.  Unless you cringe at the sight of blood or faint at envisioning someone slicing a piece of achilles tendon, then maybe this movie will frighten you.  Otherwise, with its customary young teens on a sex binge, naked women and breasts galore, the only thing scary about this movie is why I even bothered to watch it.",1146528000,2,887,4.444444444444445
1555407,2,B00005JOQB,"Maybe. This film has PLENTY of each depicted in explicit, oozing, Burroughs-esque detail. Many of the classic horror/slasher film tools are incorporated: deception, loss of control, subjection to pain, maniacal bloodthirsty antagonists, young naked (vulnerable) victims. But there is more to it then just a gore-fest.

Other people are to be exploited as a means of pleasure. That is the view challenged by this pseudo-gripping film. A group of tourists (2 Americans and an Icelander) bounce about Europe, frequent brothels, get high, and party until their fun is stymied by an encounter with Elite Hunting, an evil secret society which profits from the abduction, torture and then murder of (mostly) tourists. Much like the prostitutes these boys encountered in Amsterdam they were held against their will, their bodies encroached upon in a most heinous manner for the gratification of others and their bodies discarded.

This viewer felt the film was fairly well done with the exception of the ending. The ending sucked enough to reduce my rating by a full star. Its almost as if the executive producer informed Roth, ""we are out of funding so lets wrap this up in one week, shall we?"" And we are left with a serious lack of resolution.

Cast:  Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, Eythor Gudjonsson, Barbara Nedeljakova, Jan Vlasak, Jana Kaderabkova, Jennifer Lim.

Running Time: 94 minutes

Rated R for intense, gruesome torture violence, extreme amounts of female nudity, and language.

""Hostel"" is a very confused, problematic film. On the one hand, it is armed with a dynamite, socially relevant premise and an absolutely blistering albeit accidental commentary of the human condition, judged especially on the audience but, on the other, it is an appalling example of missed execution, bumbling screen writing, and over-hype. It is a dichotomy of contradiction that unravels the macabre with the simple relish of fraternity caliber humor. Rest assured, this is not a very good film, but perhaps there is enough novelty in what will no doubt be a hugely successful film to warrant a look at some point.  The premise and subtext underlying director Eli Roth's (""Cabin Fever"") latest film is essentially a dissection of the pleasures that drive two separate groups of vacationers. First, there are the three backpackers traveling as sex tourists across the European continent in pursuit of the carnal pleasures of the flesh. Two of the kids are the typical college byproduct of an over-sexualized culture in which adolescent achievement is measured more by the number of orgasm achieved during the month long jaunt rather than any academic, professional, or personal merit. Complementing this group are the heavies: rich, professional men who for a sizable fee can satisfy their diabolical pleasures of the body through the murder an torture of specimens apportioned out by some clandestine charnal company of mobsters and henchmen. These two groups are two extreme sides of the same coin, both in search of the pleasures derived from other people; one sexual, one absolutely homicidal. A very thin thread divides the two groups of protagonists, perhaps leading credence to the theory that left unchecked, extreme sexual behavior can lead to extreme homicidal behavior.

""Hostel"" then breaks down in its transition. It turns alternately from a light hearted, ""EuroTrip"" sex romp populated by one truly annoying Icelandic character to a somewhat dark, more like dimly lighted than opaque, journey into the world of economic sadism but the transition is full of seams. With little of the ominousness of the gruesomely brilliant ""Wolf Creek"" or the suspense of ""Audition"", the plot heavy handedly limps from ""American Pie"" to Hannibal Lector like a jagged scar. Before the audience even has a chance to grasp the nature of the threat, one character is offed off-screen and another has a sit down with the diabolical surgeon who explains pretty much the jist of what is going on.  Also, there was a lack of continuity with the heavies; since the baddies are rich merchants of torture and leather jacketed henchmen, the nature of the villainy lacked a face. Black jackets and walkie talkies don't generate the same suspense as a ghostly Micheal Myers or backwoods mutant. In fact, as two of the principals flee the dungeons, the film digresses into an absurd Inspector Gadget esquire escape, with legions of henchmen pacing back and forth oblivious to the cowering pair skulking their way through the corridors Roth lacks an eye for action as evident here. It was beyond heavy handed, it was contrived.

The torture was rather boring, nothing much new: slicing of an Achilles, a dissection, a drill to the foot, clipping of a toe.  It was all pretty pedestrian and attention seeking as personified y its director. The carnage in this film essentially plays out with the suspense of a college party drinking game.  In the end, Roth may have betrayed his own sensibility. Changing tone for the third time in the film, the survivors limp toward a showdown with their tormentors in which retribution is inflicted in such a light hearted manner that one has to wonder if Roth even believes in the subtext of his own film. If sex and sadism are two extreme sides of the same coin, then how can he relishly delight in the slaughter of the heavies with such gratuitously bloody style The audience swooned when the breasts made their first appearance, reviled (mildly) when the torture commenced, and then laughed when the three Hostel wranglers were rundown on the street Is Roth suggesting that the same psycho sexual tenancies exist even in relatively sane people (the audience?) or perhaps was the gore thrown in for the pure geek factor? If it is the former than the joke is on the audience and Roth is laughing at his own fan base. Either way, the change in tempo tended to unravel any horror that could have been generated, by purpose or incident. In the end, the carnage of ""Hostel"" is tantamount to eating a bad Thai meal; heavy feet and buyer's remorse.",1146355200,,4831,5.025

1555415,4,B00005JOQB,"I was reluctant on seeing this movie at first, but the story just sounding so interesting that i had to give it a try. The reason i was reluctant on seeing it though is because i really did not enjoy Roth's first film 'Cabin Fever'. I thought it was an idea that was used often, you know: teens on a trip get attacked by a town of hillbillies, and i just thought it was strange. But anyway, i ended up seeing Hostel because unlike Fever the idea was not overused, or really used at all, and i was very surprised that i actually really enjoyed it. If you don't know what the film is about i'll explain: the film follows a trio of teenagers who are backpacking through Europe and end up getting involved with a place that people pay at to torture and kill a person. The set up for the main conflict is very interesting and new. At first it almost seems like another version of the movie 'Eurotrip', but it quickly changes when the torture comes into play. It's almost like it goes from a teen comedy to a seriously sick and demented horror movie. Some people hated this idea, they thought it was strange for a movie to start that way and then suddenly change. I thought it was a really cool idea though.

Now, there are many mixed reviews for this film, it's almost like you either hate it or love it, and i loved it. Some people just thought it was too gross and demented and it is pretty sick (like the eyeball scene), but if your willing to get through the gore and see the art of Roth's film, I think you will really enjoy it. The characters are very well set up and the way it changes from a comedy to a horror to a revenge film is very clever and unexpected. So if you are willing to give it a try, go for it, i think you will be pleasently surprised. Oh, and as for the unrated aspect of this film, don't dawn too much on it because its only like 30 more seconds of violence, so don't expect much difference.

Aside from the film and all its clever and unique-ness, there are also some really cool special features. There are four different commentary tracks, so if your into that, its really cool. And then there is a three part featurette on how they made Hostel, from the cast to the special fx, and everything else, this featurette shows you it all. Those are really the only special features on this disc, but its really worth the money and time. So i guess my bottom line for this film is you should definately buy it if you are up for all the sick gore that is included. I give it four stars though because although it is a really good sophomoric effort and clever film, its just not absolutely 100% perfect. Still really worth the time.

1. The first half hour was so pointless nothing happend.

2. In the first hour theres just sex, more sex, more sex and yes more sex. Yes I can see sex in horoor movies but this was just pointless.

3. The acting was beyond terriable

4. There is no real plot to the movie

5. The charactors are all stupid they all deserve to die. Now come on would you walk in an abanded factory NO and the main charactor dose are that stupid.

6. It was not scary or gross

Ok now let me say the good things

1. The one and only good thing was the last 20 min when things got interesting and the main charactor tries to escape.

1555486,4,B00005JOQB,"Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) brings us another cool gorefest film. Only this time, it's torture. In this film, 3 guys (Hernandez, Richardson and Gudjonsson). are having a good time in Europe. But all that changes when a stranger tells them to go to a Hostel in another part of Europe to get girls.

When they get stupid and go there, they meet 2 girls that set them up, and take them to a place where people are paid to torture and kill tourist.

In real life, only a fool would fall for a trick like that. It seems to good to be true. But hey, it's a horror movie, can't have a horror movie without dumb victims. The gore in this film is awesome, but there's nothing unrated in this version. Even Roth himself said nothing much was cut.

Sadly, this is not one of them. This is a film shot on a shoestring budget with no name actors and whose only purpose is to shock the audiance with ""See, look how much gore I can put on the screen...and get away with it"". This is quite simply a movie reflecting the basest of attitudes by some movie producers and directors. The fact that Quentin Tarrentino is somehow treated as a wonderful contributer to cutting edge movies doesn't speak well for those who actually buy tickets to see this drivel. Fortunately, I paid only a small rental fee and was still upset that I even paid that. If you really want to see gore, join the military and ask for duty in Iraq.

1555490,4,B00005JOQB,"In his treatise on horror, ""Danse Macabre,"" Stephen King establishes the genre exists on three more or less separate levels with ""terror on top, horror below it, and lowest of all, the gag relex of revulsion.""  In the wake of ""Saw,"" and with ""Wolf Creek"" and now ""Hostel,"" it seems clear to me that we are in the heyday of the low card in that particular set.  The goal is to make the weak flee the room, before or after they throw up, and to make the strong put their hands over their eyes, but still sneak a peak through their fingers.

""Hostel"" is what writer-director Eli Roth did with the freedom Lion Gates Film gave him after his success with ""Cabin Fever.""  As you probably know, hostels, usually called youth hostels, are what young people use when they are backpacking around Europe.  As you can easily anticipate, ""hostel"" is real close to ""hostile,"" so you can easily anticipate that this is going to be about one of those places where kids check in, but they do not check out.  Paxton (Jay Hernandez), Josh (Derek Richardson), and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are backpacking across Europe, but have only made it as far as Amsterdam and are only having a good time and not a great time.  Then they are told about a hostel near Bratislava in Slovakia where women will have sex with any guy with an American accent.  Since Paxton and Josh are from the United States, they immediately head for Bratislava so they can have sex.

Now, at this point the idea that the three are going to die horrible deaths sounds like a good thing, because we are talking two Ugly Americans and a freak from Iceland.  These people are asking for it and the only fly in the ointment is that Roth delivers on the horrible deaths to the point that we are forced to admit that even these people do not deserve what happens to them.  ""Hostel"" really has two distinct halves, with the European sex trip that opens the film giving way to the giant torture sequences.  Roth even toys with his audience, relying on a combination of suggestions and screams to get you squirming, not to mention thinking that maybe you are not going to really see the gross stuff, and then he starts showing you the gross stuff.  At this point no not feel terror, forget about feeling horror, and just go right for the revulsion.

Even though it really takes too long to get to the blood and gore, and even though the film ends up taking its foot off the pedal at the end, I rounded up on ""Hostel"" for one reasons.  That was because when I got to the point where both I as a viewer and the last character standing were wondering what the hell was going on, Roth came up with an answer that rather that surprised me (Roth tells one of his actresses that ""Hostel"" is actually inspired by something that really happens, albeit in the Far East rather than Eastern Europe, and that he wanted to do a documentary about it; apparenly she thought ""The Blair Witch Project"" was true too).  I even felt more horror than revlusion as well.

In terms of the current crop of revulsion films, there is s more blood and gore in ""Hostel"" than in either ""Saw"" or ""Wolf Creek,"" but that is due in part to the fact the cast of this movie is several time larger.  The other key distinction is that while ""Hostel"" obviously is set up for a sequel, which Roth is working on this year, it is really the only one of these films to offer any sort of catharsis in the end.  That actually works against this type of film, and you might be surprised that ""Hostel"" is the most lighthearted of the three.  So ""Saw II"" has the best squirming scene with the pit o' hypodermics, ""Wolf Creek"" will leave you the most empty, and ""Hostel"" will give you the most blood and laughs.  Do not say you were not warned.",1146009600,,3734,4.406113537117904
1555491,4,B00005JOQB,"Eli Roth is obviously a huge fan of the genre.  This was made clearly evident with his first feature - the fun, ghoulish, but ultimately flawed Cabin Fever.  Hostel is likewise a fun, ghoulish, but lacking movie that is better than Cabin Fever, but missing something.  If this movie proves anything is that in time Roth has the potential to make a film on the same level as the ones that obviously influenced him - Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, Japanese horror films like Audition - but he's not quite there yet.

The first half of Hostel is Girls Gone Wild as a trio of friends beggar through Europe.  The movie begins by finding the trio in Amsterdam.  Need I say more?  Soon, however, the movie thrusts its viewer into a nihilistic world where wealthy people pay good money to indulge their need for torture.  And our three drug-addled, sex-crazed heroes are the main course.

Hostel has a lot going for it.  It's fast paced.  The characters are likeable.  The women are beautiful and barely wearing a stitch.  And that's just the first half hour.  The rest of the film takes place in a kind of hell of earth where limbs are amputated, fingers are chainsawed to the floor and the human body is reduced to the properties of a pin cushion.  People are flayed and dissected with glee.  Eyes dangle from their sockets.  Ankle tendons are severed.  Although the DVD boasts that its unrated, the gore level was not as stomach-churningly prodigious as I had anticipated.  But still.  Pretty much all bodily fluids are on display herein.  The movie, despite all its bloodshed, seems to not take itself seriously.  And neither did I.  I'm not sure if the desired effect was to make the viewer squirm and dry heave or at times to laugh out loud at some of the more over-the-top effects.  I did mostly the latter.  For any horror fan, this is a must see, considering how stale the genre is it at the moment.  More importantly, Hostel shows a horror filmmaker (and above all, a horror fan) improving his craft while delivering the visceral goods to those of us who eat that sticky stuff up.

Of the special features on the DVD, the only ones of note are the three behind the scenes features and the four seperate commentaries featuring Roth and others, including one with exec. producers Quentin Tarantino and Scott Spiegel.",1146009600,,2321,4.638820638820639

*** 1/4.

I've been eagerly awaiting this movie on DVD. I finally had the chance to watch it. The verdict - mixed.

First, Jay Hernandez. I work at a NBC affiliate so I recall his work on the kiddie show ""One World"". I got past that though after about 10 minutes in.

The first 35 minutes were hard to sit though. Here are some young men at the end of their college years trolloping around Europe. They are indulging in pleasures of the flesh at ever turn. So essentially the characters are after one thing - sex. I didn't like any of them. Well, Josh was ok because he at least knew this was pretty pathetic behavior. He went along with it because Oli and Paxton were ringleading.

The movie doesn't start to get interesting until Oli disappears. Then poor Josh gets it. The film ratchets up the suspense as Paxton now alone in the former Soviet Union wonders what the hell is going on.

When he is promised to be taken to where his friends are by some local call girl - then the real interesting things start. Appears there is a cottage industry in the town of kidnapping foreigners and using them as torture victims. The twist is the rich and affluent train or fly in and pay handsomely to enact thier torture fantasies. Many people in the town are in on this scheme because it brings home large sums of money.

The concept is shocking.

Paxton's escape I thought was plausable. Going back for the Japanese girl I thought was a stretch. I know it was noble, but in that situation it was risky. On top of that, the same girl with her eye hanging out and half of her face rashed. I doubt she'd have been as lucid as she was. Paxton's rescue of her was intended by the writers to add some light in the sea of humanity's lurid darkness.

This a rental movie plain and simple. Its no great piece of cinema. It does though - with its twist midway get you.

If you make it that far, then you'll probably come out of it with a view similar to mine.",1146009600,2,1952,4.279891304347826
1555495,4,B00005JOQB,"When watching this movie I got the distinct impression that Eli Roth, the director, knows and loves movies.  There are times early on when it seemed he was doing cinematic riffs on Hitchcock, at least before the extreme gore kicks in.  The choice of orchestrational music rather than rock or electronic helps to give the movie a rather sophisticated feel.

I think I had all of the proper responses to this movie.  I winced.  I cringed.  I noticed how a character who talks about being a vegetarian at the beginning of the movie becomes a cold hearted killer by the end, and we cheer on this transformation, much as we cheer on a similar transformation in  Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence.""

The heroes of this movie, like Eli Roth's previous film, Cabin Fever, are flawed.  They tend to objectiify women and are out to have a good time.  But they never come off as mean spirited.  When friends and aquantances disappear they actively search for them, become concerned when one of them isn't feeling well.  It is a creepy movie that stays with you and has some sembalnce of context.",1145923200,,1086,4.657894736842105
1555569,3,B00005JOQB,"Well, needless to say that when I saw the trailer for this highly expected film, I was forced to believe that the movie would undergo an entire atmosphere of gothic horror and squirmy scenes non stop. This, however, is not the case. Or, it is at least half the case, to put it nicely.

The film is only one hour and a half long.

The first thirty minutes, to me, is wasted in a montage of sex, drugs, booze, and little, if none, rock and roll. It didn't surprise me seeing as how Eli Roth clearly explained that, for some reason, he must use nudity in his films in order to capture the essence of the 80's nostolgia that got lost in the undertow of the movies of the ninties. However, we are now in the millenium which means: New Direction.

But, on a more positive note, I did like the way the film slowly crept into the dark depths of fear. There are a lot of serial killer movies, supernatural killers, jason, michael myers, flesh-eating bacteria, fear of the unkown, fear of the water, hieghts, or an alien threat. But very few, almost none, do not focus on the fear of being in a room where some stranger gets to torcher you however he or she wants or pleases. So, becuase this is the first movie that hones in on that fear, I have to give the director credit becuase he did what he wanted to achieve; he made me squirm.

Now, after watching it once, I was totally disoriented. But the second time around I began to find myself very sympathetic to the three backpackers who were in this feature. It seems as if they were destined to do dumb stuff right before they witnessed the horror of torture.

There is even signature lighting and tone that really reveals that this was done by the same people who did the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Remake.

In essence, it's an original premise but, for me, it just needed to get there quicker. Could have done without the gratuitus sex scenes and drug hoopla.

This movie, in a way, shows you how sick and twisted strangers are when they get bored with there hum-drum lives.

Also, to the horror-nuts out there; you should know that there is not much gore in this feature. If I could compare it, I'd say that it was a little more than what the movie SAW brought to the screen.

But, another thing I've found is that this is way better than CABIN FEVER.

But, when you think about it, Hostel really breaks into two different acts. The first act of the movie depicts the Hostel (a modern day soddom and gomorah) that the three backpackers are staying at. The second act shows how Hostel (meaning crazy) the villianous characters can be.

1555572,3,B00005JOQB,"I'm gonna start off with the goods.

The movie is original and has a good feel to it. The mood is set as three Americans travel across Europe in search of drugs, sex and more sex. The feeling of when and where is it all gonna go bad is delayed nicely and it keeps you interested despite the slow pace getting down to the nitty gritty. Yet, when it all does finally go down, the shock value is strong and unexpected.

What they eventually stumble across, is more adventure than they were looking for. A sadistic game of torture, brought about by cat and mouse and they unwittingly fall into the trap.

Now the bads.

First off, in a way, it's a good, because when it finally does happen, it holds more punch, but it took a long time to get into the danger that the movie is based on. Much of the film is taken up with set up... travel, sex-capades and things that really don't have anything to do with anything that unfolds in the film. This is not a huge deal to me.

Where the film lost me, is when Paxton is finally strapped to the chair and his torturer is having his way. What unfolds is a series of ridiculous coincidences and clumsiness that leads to his getting free. He yells something at his torturer that is not subtitled, but it stops his torturer for a moment. Then his torturer starts up a chainsaw, SLIPS IN SOME BLOOD and chainsaws his own leg. Then of course... there's a gun!

I hate coincidences. While I was into this film, at this scene, which was probably the most important scene in the film... I rolled my eyes and didn't care anymore.

Don't get me wrong. This is actually a good film. Better than Cabin Fever. Certainly not THE SCARIEST MOVIE IN A DECADE, which has been promoted. Maybe the most VIOLENT. HOSTEL is a movie that, in my opinion, missed a lot of opportunities to really be special when it hit the coincidence super highway, and for me, fell into mediocre land.",1145836800,4,1899,4.3474576271186445

Figure half a dozen of 'em in the average abdominal procedure tray sent up from central supply.  The circulating nurse can always spill a couple more on the Mayo stand if you drop one on the floor, honest.

Yeah, a towel clamp can be used as a tenaculum to grab soft tissue, sure.  But that's because the pincer-like design enables you to bite into skin or muscle or fascia with *less* damage than a regular hemostat or Kocher clamp might impose by virtue of crush injury.

  Over the past few months I have been reading in magazines, reports that ""Eli Roth's Hostel is making the audience run out of the theatre from pure discust"" (which of corse made me even more eager to see the film) .... now 2 month's later after buying the film I relize that the gore statement is somewhat over-rated (wait to let me explain why!). I must confess that one of my true passions is to watch all sorts horror films (low-budget, big-budget, Chinese & Japanese, gory, suspence/thrillers) whatever! it doesnt matter what kind, if there is a horror film I have either seen or want to see it, BUT back to the subject at hand... seeing all sorts of horror film's, I know what to look at in one, and what Hostel brings has nothing unique,... Itilian & French horror film's do the same thing as Hostel does with ALOT more actual horror, any horror film with a decent budget what so ever can make a film THAT gory and un-easing, it doesnt take a brilliant mind, it doesnt take great acting, all it takes is a few million and a somewhat twisted mind. One good thing about this film was the .. (BEWARE.. SPOILER LIES AHEAD!) part where the Californian escapes with the one-eyeballed Asian, it was somewhat suspenceful as well as fast-paced, (unlike the first thirty minutes of boobs, sex & drugs!)

Overall all Roth's 2nd effort is an improvment from Cabin fever (his 1st film) BUT he is still a bit more than a little un-educated in the true definition of horror, and very far still from some of the great horror minds (directors) that are still around today as well as some that are six feet under ground

1555575,2,B00005JOQB,"Certain films just scream a purchase to me, even blind buys. The Fly and Dr Strangelove were pure blind buys and I didn't regret them. Sometimes though a film comes out and you just have to test the waters. Well going to the video store, I found out I got a free rental so I was very curious about Hostel so got that. Well, that saying of ""I want those 90 minutes back"" certainly applied to me. ""Scariest movie in a decade""? Liars.

2 Americans and a Icelandic friend are in England backpacking looking for, what else? Women, particularly soon-to-be naked willing women. They overhear a story of a place that has incredibly easy girls who just love American accents. Well getting there, they meet 2 girls and soon they get suckered in to an odd place: people who pay to torture and kill people for a price, and wouldn't you know it? Americans fetch a mighty fine price.

Like Land of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, the Saw films and Wolf Creek, the film tries to horrify by showing disgusting images such as severed limbs or any other nasty business. Hostel doesn't delve into it right away but there's still a kind of pointless feel to it all. When the carnage starts happening, I can just imagine the filmmakers going nuts because they just wanted to make a violent movie. Gore can be used in a more artistic fashion such as war films but here it just feels violent just for the sake of it.

What piqued my interest was this guy at the college mentioned the film and one of the gory shots and a woman in the class said ""every guy his age should see that film"". Whether she meant it as ""boys will be boys"" who will see those nudity/violence filled movies or it shows commentary on a thing apparently guys love to do: go overseas and bed ""hot European chicks"". To be honest, I never was into that, preferring the romance and chase angle but this is a commentary and it's a well-told one at that, it's just too bad it's on a ridiculous and pointless movie.

1555577,3,B00005JOQB,"Hostel is a gore fest that dares you to not turn away from the screen.

As MODERN horror films goes, this is above average. As horror films go, it is below average. This is a far superior film to say....Friday the 13th, but a pitiful film in comparison to the German film ""M"" (from 1933). Why? Because MODERN horror films don't actually use HORROR (definition: creating a sense of fear or dread), but rather go for the cheap scare: gore and shock. Bill Cosby once said, ""It is very easy to get people to laugh at dirty jokes, because they make them uncomfortable. It is much more difficult to get people to laugh at clean humor."" The same can be said for gore and shock. It is much easier to get a reaction to them than it is to create an overall sense of fear and dread.

Hostel, at times, does create a sense of fear and dread, but not in its scenes of gore and torture, but rather in the anticipation of those scenes.

Two American college aged young men and one man a bit older (from Iceland) are partying hard in Amsterdam as they backpack across Europe. They admit to having no interest in seeing the sites, but rather in being as randy as possible and participating in as many acts of debauchery that they can. This is the first mistake of the filmmakers. Since the three lead characters are not morally redeemable, it is hard to feel sympathy for them...with possibly one exception: Josh (Derek Richardson). Josh is quite possible a virgin and his friend Paxton (Jay Hernandez) is making it his job to see to it that Josh gets ""lucky"". While he does, in fact, get lucky, it would seem that Josh very possibly has feelings for Paxton beyond just good friends. When Josh gets bumped off, his is the only character we feel sympathy for.

While in Amsterdam, the guys find out that there is a youth hostel in Slovakia where the women will do anything sexual with anyone who wants it. Lame premise...but supportive of the naive and stupid tourists who would believe that anything goes in a former Soviet block country.

This is possibly the film's greatest strength. It capitalizes on the uneasy and unsure subconscious fears of the Western world regarding the old Soviet block countries. Sure, they're the new ""wild west"" where anything goes, but that can also include the bad with the good.

The three guys head to Slovakia and this ""hostel not in any guide book"". When they arrive, the hostel appears to be more like a four or five star hotel where they have to share their room with three beautiful girls who remove their clothes at the drop of a hat. In fact, the first half of the film is a veritable ""boob fest"" in that more women run around topless in this than in most hard core porn films.

The guys get lucky immediately, but because we know that the hostel is is front for something far more sinister, we are actually allowed to fear for the characters just what is going to become of them. This is the one factor of the advertising campaign for this film that does its job.

Once the second half of the film begins, the story switches to a very gory version of ""The Most Dangerous Game"", where men pay big money to torture, mutilate and kill other humans.

I don't think I've given too much away, but to tell more would be giving away the simple plot. Is there redemption? I'll let you be the judge. Is it more than a simple gore film? Not really. Is it amateurish? No. The acting is decent and the scenery and the special effects are quite....realistic.

The DVD has almost no extras beyond various commentaries. This isn't Citizen Kane, so I just wanted to watch the film. Thus this sort of ""extra"" is, to me a waste of time - ego stroking on the part of those involved.

It's an inevitable film. One that will surely have sequels. And since you know you'll want to see them, go ahead and get this film.",1145836800,,3821,4.436519258202567
1555578,1,B00005JOQB,"I'm sorry to say that this movie was soooo bad, that it deserves -5 (negative five) stars; what I hated about the movie was that the first half was like Euro Trip (which was a good comedy) and the last half was like Saw, in other words a comedy and a horror movie mixed together in a bad way. The acting sucked! The villain was a wimp until the final scene! And overall this movie was gross and not scary! If you look for scary movies stick with: HALLOWEEN, HELLRAISER, THE FOG, STIGMATA, THE RING, THE EXORCIST, POLTERGEIST and JAWS 1+2, and if you are really looking for blood try THE DENTIST",1145750400,3,594,4.3125

But it was entertaining, I have to admit. Not once was I bored. I mean, how can cutting off fingers be boring? All right, I admit I like a little gore. But this movie actually had a pretty interesting plot. Three guys tour Europe looking for sex and think they've found paradise in Bratislava. Pretty far from the truth. I won't spoil it for yuh but they get quite a shock when they've realized they've been lured there by a sadistic crazy man who has ""always wanted to be a surgeon"". I thought Jay Hernandez did a great job in the lead role. I was totally rooting for him after he discovers the truth and tries to save his life (as well as that Japanese girl). All around a pretty good flick, if you like the ""Saw"" type gory horror movie. Perhaps Tarantino's goriest film. Not to be missed! I'll never stay in a hostel in Europe again. Haha.

Hostel is undeniably trashy,not very scary but it's also a lot of fun in a sleazy way. Like The Man Show this film seems specifically geared toward men and is an effective nasty little B-movie. Unlike Saw there are no clever games so it takes very little brainpower to enjoy this film.

1555642,3,B00005JOQB,"Eli Roth's ""Hostel"" wants desperately to be like a grindhouse horror flick from the seventies, in the sliced vein of ""Last House on the Left"" and ""I Spit On Your Grave.""  It even has Quentin Tarantino, a huge grindhouse afficionado, as executive producer.  The last half of the film is as brutal and bloody as any horror film released in the last decade, and considering the studios so covet the teen audience that many horror films are released with the accursed PG-13 rating, this kind of cinematic poison is just what we needed.  Of course, the first half of the film is all build-up, so the audience is caught off-guard by the shocks to come.  Unfortunately, the horror crowd thrives on shock, so a lot of gore hounds are too impatient to follow a story, even one as simple as this one.  Three young men (can you say ""target demographic""?), two of them the prototypical Ugly Americans and the other an Ugly Icelander, are backpacking through Europe trying to get laid as much as humanly possible.  A creepy acquaintance points them to Slovakia, where they are told the girls are desperate and willing to screw anybody.  Of course, they soon discover that all is not as it seems and that leads to the inevitable Very Bad Things.  This includes bondage, torture, murder and even worse, and we are spared almost no part of the ordeal.  Okay, so far so good.  I enjoy a good abbatoir slaughter as much as the next freak, and Roth goes about it with impressive enthusiasm (why leave an eyeball just dangling from its socket when you can also cut it right off?), but I really want a good story to go with it.  All that time at the beginning of the movie getting to know the characters is wasted, because these cardboard frat weasels are so stupid and unsympathetic that one wants them to be tortured; heck, many people would volunteer to do it.  In the film, rich jaded businessmen pay thousands of dollars to do the honors, and we, the audience, have only to pay the tiniest fraction of that to watch, but it still feels like a cheat.  We don't care if they live or die, so watching to see if and how they escape is rendered as pointless as the carnage they're subjected to.

That carnage, however, is often pretty effective.  Milan Chadima's cinematography is grainy and gritty, lending an air of reality to the most outlandish scenes.  The gore makeup is used so liberally I wouldn't be surprised if it made up half the budget.  One scenery-chewing sequence features Rick Hoffman, as an American ""client"" of the den of torture, coming off as a totally psychotic version of Jeremy Piven (Ari Gold on TV's ""Entourage"").  It's actually more memorable than a lot of the blood-splattering set pieces.  Oh yeah, and don't forget to look for a blink-and-you'll-miss-him cameo by acclaimed director (and probable inspiration for this project) Takashi Miike.

If only the story lived up to these moments, then this ""Hostel"" would be worth checking into for a long stay.  As it is, rent a room but don't stick around long.  The smell of the undercooked script can't be disguised by buckets of blood.",1145750400,2,3090,4.651933701657459

Teenie bopper frat guys look to score with european chicks, heady concept Roth. You don't see any gore for a good 50-60 minutes. The horror in this one is elementary and chessy, I waited the whole movie for the guy with the flip up cut and  hairgell to die and he's the one that survives.

1555646,4,B00005JOQB,"Hostel is an ingenious if sick movie by newcomer Eli Roth(Cabin Fever) You need to take the situation of three young back-packers travelling to a place called Slovokia for drugs and unbridled sex, with a grain of salt. Just the name Slovokia doesn't sound like a horny young mans' idea of sexual paradise.  But it's the movies clever structure of three separate movie genres that disguise the movies flaws.  Part One is soft-core porn--Part Two is sadistic horror, torture and mutilation with an emphasis on the sadistic--and Part Three is revenge thriller.

Strangely Part three is the goriest with death by rock, motor vehicle and train and that old horror movie staple-death in a toilet. And there's even a pack of feral children who kill for candy and bubblegum.

The scenes in the torture chamber are a bit restrained however just the thought of being bound by handcuffs in a chair while some slobbering cretin is standing over you with a chainsaw is chilling.

When I go to Windows Explorer, no files are listed. Is this another one of Sony's ROOTKITs causing this? I can play the dvd fine on a regular DVD Player, but have this problem when playing on laptop DVD drive. The other odd thing I noticed is after I insert the disc and autoplay begins, there is alot of Hard Drive access going on, which then subsides and stops once the movie starts to play.

As far as the movie goes, all the trailers out before the release really made it look like this was destined to be headed for all time classic horror status. Unfortunately, the trailers were more suspensful than the rest of the movie. It was really a let down. The story starts out excrutiatingly slooow. For a moment I thought I had picked up a remake of a Jason movie - oh, here we go with a bunch of drug using sex crazed foul mouthed yoots just asking to be dismembered by our Jason-like anti-hero. I honestly thought Roth was going to use this tired old device to get us to really root for these guys eventual demise. But, then we get confused because of the predicament they find themselves. Even though we see them as privilaged white boys out to get some much needed booty before, alas, they have to settle down to take the bar examine or work on completing that Thesis so Jr. can go off to become Mr. Executive. I guess, we maintain a bit of lingering disdain and secretly want to see these punks get theirs. However, we soon for get why we're rooting for their demise as the movie changes gears and now we are to become sympathetic to their plight. Instead, we are directed to place our sympathy with the other victims - especially, the Japanese girl so horribly disfigured she commits suicide. Paxton, gives into revenge - understandable, but redictable. Soon, Paxton becomes like the evil he is taking revenge against - he seems to enjoy making the Dutch guy suffer for his role in this.

Hostel should have taken lessens from SAW and SAWII, which effectively combined gore and suspence beutifully. Hostel pretty much abandoned suspence - we can easiliy predict what's coming around the corner. Yes, there was massive amount of blood - but scary? No, just kinda gross. I can deal with gross if it's part of the scary suspense parts.

Cool gore scenes although I heard the movie was much sicker and gorier than it really was. Kind of a Chainsaw Massacre and Saw ripoff. I would have expected better from Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth. I'm not sure if there was a ""rated"" version of the film. I bought the Unrated version.

1555746,4,B00005JOQB,"In the first few minutes of Hostel, what I expected to be a dark, brooding, horrifying thriller, a group of young guys walk out of a cafe going ""Amsterdam Baby! Whoooooo!"". I was worried. Coming from Eli Roth, however I should not have been so surprised. Roth, who brought the darkly comic Cabin Fever upon the world a few years ago, seems to be little more than a horror-movie-obsessed fratboy. Consider the character he played in Cabin Fever - a stoner, surfer type. He makes a cameo in the early scenes of Hostel, playing.... a stoner. That tells us much about Eli Roth. He has the potential to be a major horror director, if only he were interested in characters that were more than just sex-crazed partying college kids. In my mind, that is what keeps Hostel (Roth's second film) from being a completely successful horror movie. The movie gets better as it progresses, but the first half  hour resembles little more than outtakes from Eurotrip. Around the halfway mark, Hostel manages to build a real feeling of menace and tension as the boys who wanted little more than to get laid are now in way over their heads fighting for their lives. Don't be fooled by Quentin Tarantino's name on the cover, Hostel is an Eli Roth movie through and through. I can only imagine what the movie would have been like if Tarantino had written and directed it. I'd say it would probably be a lot closer to Takashi Miike and farther away from teen sex comedy.

In spite of my reservations, I really feel that the second half of Hostel is truly gripping, tense and horrifying. The gore scenes are well done, courtesy of the great Greg Nicotero. The European locations especially Prague are well-used and give the viewer a real feeling of being in a foreign, unknown place (well, American viewers anyway). The slaughterhouse used in the second half of the film is a truly atmospheric, terrifying place. The actors do a good job, and eventually you do feel for the main characters. You also will want really bad things to happen to the  villains, and Roth does not disappoint.

So, Hostel is pretty uneven. I still don't like the early expository scenes or the fact that the heroes are horny fratboys. However, Hostel still manages to be a tense, disturbing, gripping thriller  and I would recommend it to horror fans and those who are not squeamish. Eli Roth has real potential and if he loses the college stoner humor he could possibly come up with something really great.",1145664000,,2459,4.669745958429561

Don't get me wrong, there is some suspense after the drugs/sex stuff thankfully conclude, but it was too late for me. By then, the untalented acotrs rounded up for this H-wood version of straight-to-DVD fodder have worn out their welcome (and my patientce). The things that happen in the grindhouse are scary, but not in any way new.

I am a fan of the Horror genre in all mediums, so that is why I am giving this 3 stars. The first 30 mins should have been trimmed down to 10-15 mins and this would have been a tight thriller. I was more troubled and disturbed by the Devils Rejects than this movie. I hope Eli Roth gets it straight for when he starts filming S.

1555749,1,B00005JOQB,"Oh boy was I excited to get the unrated version on DVD as I missed it at the show. In short, this movie sucks - it sucks bad.

1) After the first 10 minutes, I wanted to rip it out of the player, snap it in half, and dispose of it properly - rid the world of this trash. Why? The scenes of Amsterdam (was it even filmed there??) If you've ever been there, this film will piss you off with its childish, inaccurate portrayal.

2) Was this supposed to be a comedy? I'm not sure. It's that dumb.

3) The torture is way over-rated. Check out Audition instead.

4) Only near the end do we get the story.

Is it a fantastic concept? Yes it is.

Could it have been one of the truly great cult movies of all time? Oh yeh - definitely.

Did Roth even come close to pulling it off? Hell no.

Overall, Cabin Fever is a masterpiece next to this garbage. Even the gore is weak - has a video game feel to it. And the eyeball gag? Oh gee, I think this has been done a few times through the years in horror cinema.

If you're looking for good dialogue - there's one good scene about 2 minutes long.

If you're looking for gore - go elsewhere.

If you're looking for suspense - keep looking; I mean who cares about these people anyway - I know I didn't. Character development is close to non-existent in this film.

Overall, I think this is a good start for an emerging (or unused in a while) genre. Taking this exact storyline, I'd like to see someone other than Roth try a remake. It could go down in history as one of the great cult films. As it stands, it's near worthless, and totally laughable.",1145664000,4,1583,4.120521172638436

1555752,4,B00005JOQB,"I don't quite know what to make of 'Hostel'. I'm not sure if I liked it or hated it, because when I was watching it all I could thing about was how crappy it was, and now I'm thinking back, and thinking that perhaps it wasn't so bad. I think, for the most part, that it's just Eli Roth movies that I do this with. I did the same with 'Cabin Fever', so maybe his movies are terrible and I have yet to see that, or maybe they're great and while everyonbe else is running down to the mall to see his newest movie, I'll be debating whether or not I like his movies. Ultimately, I decided that I liked 'Cabin Fever' because of its grisly sense of humor, and the fact that it had a grim ending, something movies rarely have these days. 'Hostel', on the other hand, had no sense of humor. And even when it did it was mean spirited. But going into the movie I knew it wasn't going to be very funny, if at all humorous.

The first half hour or so of the movie is spent on the two main characters, Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson), picking up hookers at Amsterdam hostels. Seemingly, there is no point to these scenes, but it is clear what writer-director Eli Roth is trying to say. Later in the movie, several characters pay to torture someone, basically buying the right to kill a person. Roth has cleverly contrasted to world of prostitution, where sex can be bought for a price, with this nightmarish world of torture. He is trying to say that prostitutes are being sold, and now torture is for around the same price. This contrast was interesting, but the movie needed more action in the first act. However, there is something very interesting about the torture comitted in the movie.

In one of the movies funnier statements on how much Europe hates us Americans, the torture cards handed out have three sections that you can choose from to buy. With each one the price goes up. The first is local, the second tourist, and the third is American, which costs $25,000, and it's funny because almost every victim in the movie (with the exception about about three) are American's. This was probably the funniest thing in the movie, and it's not even real laugh out loud material.

The plot involves Josh, Paxton, and their friend Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) going to Amsterdam for the summer. They hope to find hookers and drugs, and they do, for a little while. Eventually, one of Oli's friends reccomends to him a hostel where the ""[girls] are so hot they'll [have] any guy with an American accent."" So the three horndogs set out for Slovakia, where they have a strange run in with a man on the train going there. However, once they get there, they could care less. They meet several prostitutes, and go to the hot tubs alot. Eventually, Paxton and Josh hear about another hostel, from two of their friends, Natalya and Svetlana. But before they can try it out, Oli dissapears. Then another one of the guys dissapears, leaving the reamining one to try and track him down. Unfortunately, the two that have dissapeared have gone away to the hostel, which is more of a hostile.

The torture scenes in the movie are few and far between, and those that are there are not prolonged or terribly gruesome. I actually found this to be a plus for the movie. It hardly ever seems like things are left to the imagination anymore in Hollywood. In 'The Hills Have Eyes' did the camera ever cut away? No. And most people loved that and said it was the coolest movie ever. But I thought it was a piece of [...]. The last act of the movie, when the plot really gets moving, is very interesting, and I enjoyed it because of how claustrophobic it made the viewer feel. This was a good movie, but I don't know if it's one that I could wholeheartedly reccomend. It's not scary, but it is entertaining to an extent. I would say see it if you have some extra time one day, and if you like these sort of movies.",1145664000,,3896,4.422005571030641
1555753,3,B00005JOQB,"Well well. After the lame Cabin Fever, I didn't think I'd have the gumption to sit through another Eli Roth movie (or that someone would give him the money to make one, for that matter). But here I am, writing this review after spending a day metaphorically chewing over Roth's sophomore effort, Hostel.

Experience they say, is a great teacher. While not without serious problems, Hostel is a huge jump forward for Roth as a filmmaker, all the way around. He shows that he's not just a horror movie-fanboy-hack, but that he might be a guy who, like Mr. Producer-guy Quentin Tarantino, brings the whole package to the table.

The story here revolves around the shenanigans of three guys: an annoying, [..]young American named Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and his [..] American buddy Josh (Derek Richardson), spending a few of their glory days backpacking around Europe with a zany, frat-boy-ish Icelander named Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson). The sex-starved trio winds up in Amsterdam. Locked out of their hostel after a late night out partying, our boys get a tip from a slightly geeky, big-nosed kid about a hostel just outside of Bratislava where they can find all the free love they can handle. Our[..] heroes jump a train first thing the next morning.

Roth takes his own sweet time getting the ball rolling, spending a good forty-five minutes - the entire first act of the film - with the guys as they wander around and hunt for drugs and sex. Roth manages to throw in a couple plot points here and there during all the soft-core nude scenes to set up the next third of the film, which is all about the torture and layering on the gore; and finally bringing us to the grand finale, where some of the bad guys get their grisly come-uppance at the mangled hands of our lone survivor, Paxton (with some help from a group of rag-tag street kids).

Overall, there's some good stuff here, if you're into this type of thing. There's a nifty cameo from Takashi Miike (of Audition and Ichi the Killer - and about a thousand others - fame) The cringe-inducing FX are some of the best I've seen, with as real looking bloody bodyparts as you're likely to find this side of Rick Baker. Roth clearly likes the genre he's working in, and it shows, even with the rough edges. The box art is enticingly creepy enough to suck you in and rent or buy the movie. Unfortunately, the DVD extras included here are the usual making of documentaries and silly, pat-on-the back commentaries, but the Roth and the guys are so clearly having fun its easy to come away enjoying the experience.

In the end, I can't say I'd watch Hostel over again and again - it's no Evil Dead or Night of the Living Dead type of genre-defining classic - but it has enough cover-your-eyes, Whoo-Mama! moments to warrant a review with a handful of stars from this jaded old video hound, and has enough flair to impress me enough to hope that writer/director/jack of all trades Roth improves this much with his next movie (it's sequel time, kids). His could be a fun career to keep a dangling, blow-torched eye on.",1145664000,,3059,4.626151012891344
1555761,5,B00005JOQB,"I thought that this movie was very entertaining.  I don't think that it was scary though. There are just a couple of torture scenes. But, don't let this be the reason to not watch the movie.

Overall, this is a good movie, and a good story. It is a good story because it is realistic - a couple of college boys going off to Europe to have fun, end up in a weird town, meet up with some cute girls, and become the unwilling victims in a scheme where weirdos pay big bucks to torture and kill other people.

Also, I think that anyone who watches this movie will be very satisfied with the ending, because what comes around, goes around.

You will definitely root for the hero in this movie when you see him handing out justice left and right.",1145664000,3,740,4.226950354609929
1555762,1,B00005JOQB,"If young men on vacation are really this shallow and misogynistic - we are all doomed. The three main characters romp through Amsterdam and points beyond, seeking and seeing nothing but naked women who might make themselves available with absolutely no strings. We glimpse what's intended to be the famous red-light district of the Netherlands, but the film really turns the whole landscape into one big red-light district.

Quentin Tarantino and the others who give the generally giggling, juvenile DVD commentary on the film, have one brief moment of realization. One of them tosses out the idea that the film is an example of what goes around, comes around. He remarks that the young men start out exploiting women, then end up being themselves exploited in far darker ways in the horror house where they end up.

But then the commentators giggle on, showing that no such moral has sunk in very deep with them. And it seems certain that their point in making this movie was certainly not to provide any illustration of poetic justice. Their point in making the movie just seems to have been to make some bucks by getting a writhing of soft-core porn (verging on hard-core) out there on the screen.

The actor who plays the prime villain does a good job and provides a few good presaging moments - as he talks about his gustatory preferences. Other than that, this movie is a waste of time unless you are into porn. And then you'd be better off just going into the adult section and being done with it.",1145664000,3,1504,4.6893939393939394
1555763,5,B00005JOQB,"The movie world is full of countless flicks that will make you jump, scream and maybe hurl your popcorn across the cinema. Boogeymen creep from closets. Lunatics are killed but keep getting up. Tiny dolls with knives menace entire communties. Most people enjoy a harmless fright. It's all good once the credits roll and the theater is lighted again.

Hostel is not a harmless fright. It's bleak, bloody and bold and suited only for those who like to wander to the really dark places. It's a gloomy, hard tale every bit as traumatizing to the intellect as it is repulsive to the eye.

In short, I freaking love this movie. And it all starts with lively music and naked people. For the first 45 minutes, I wanted to be a reckless teen again. I wanted to get myself a passport and backpack and prepare to tramp all over Europe. I wanted to wander with my friends and experience the liberal offerings of those far flung countries. I wanted to indulge in all the vice so vividly advertised in the opening scenes of the movie.

By the time it was done, I had endeavored never to leave the safety of the United States. Nossir. I'll burn the passport, drop the backpack in a river and stay right here where 911 is always a finger's length away.
Much fuss is made about the graphic violence in ""Hostel."" It's certainly graphic and violent as they come. Yet, it's not the blood and gore, drills and saws that will leave you unsettled. More disturbing is the concept at the very heart of the tale. The idea that Americans abroad could be snared into a sinister underworld and then sold to wealthy sadists to do with as they will. What gnaws at you is how handily such a business could operate.
There's a scene midway through the film where a young man awakes with a hood over his face and only a small hole to see through. His feet are bound to the floor. His hands are bound behind him. He is a prisoner in a dark, dingy roomand the horrible truth of his situation becomes abundantly clear soon enough.
The movie works because it plants you in that very chair. You feel the rising desperation as it becomes evident what your role is here. You are a plaything for a madman who has paid good money to satisfy all the depraved longings in his sick heart. At his disposal is a nauseating variety of tools. There are drills and blades, saws and hammers, needles and scalpels. All the things that have scared you since your first visit to the dentist or doctor are right here and there will be no anesthesia.
Yeah, it's pretty damn jolting when the first young man gets a drill bit sunk into his thigh. But more revolting is the notion that this is the only beginning. Because a person who pays enormously for such nasty pleasure is surely not going to be quick about it. You feel the grinding and growing horror of the victim's plight. Screaming will get them nowhere. This is a place designed specifically for screams. There will be no human rights groups stopping by. There will be no U.S. led rescue operation at the last minute. This is a place with a name like Ardvarkia, or Ohyuckia. The safety of home is a long ways off and the people back there are blissfully unaware of this strange country and of the terrors therein.
Sure, in-your-face images of dismember legs and hanging eyeballs will ruin your popcorn. But it's the heavy feeling of isolation and helplessness that will cloud the rest of your day.
There are plenty of people who refuse to see this flick. If they are timid about unrestrained nastiness, I don't blame them. Don't blame them at all. But if you're even mildly curious about the movie, I say go. Go spend a couple hours with Tarantio and Eli Roth, and you'll feel a little better about missing those overseas trips when you were a cocky college kid. You never go the high times in Barcelona, it's true. But at least you have all your fingers and you never had an eyeball dangling against your cheek.

If you still get a giddy delight watching the ear scene in ""Reservoir Dog,"" go see this movie. Just cut your date some slack if he or she starts squeezing your hand with bone crushing might. It's only human to recoil against atrocities committed against humans. And a story that can reach a person on that primitive level is a success. I give ""Hostel"" two thumbs up to go with the three or four laying on the floor.",1145577600,4,4329,4.469026548672566

This movie was three parts:
1. Some young American guys and their zany friend being stereotypical horrible and rude tourists just trying to hook up - 40 minutes.
2. The time spent in this cool, torture 'hostel' - 10 minutes.
3. A getaway/chase scene - 30 minutes.

Not only was the only cool part only 10 minutes, but they barely touched on why these people do this.  The only hint that they gave towards one character is because he is a closeted [...].  It was just ridiculous.  It was a let down because it could have been good.",1145577600,,562,4.41747572815534
1555765,3,B00005JOQB,"This film has been hailed as the scariest film since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  I don't think so, the hype is not well-deserved.  Although the haters will probably pounce on my review and say it wasn't ""helpful"", not much I can do about it.

The acting itself was fine, as was the idea.  Too bad the execution and character development were not.  The first half of the film?  Sex and drugs.  Our three adventerous lads find themselves in Amsterdam looking to party.  So the intro to the characters?  Looking to get stoned and laid.  Wow.  I really didn't like any of these boys.  And therein lies one of the problems.  In a good horror film, you should be rooting for at least *one* person.  I didn't.

We've got the nerdy American bookworm who is trying forget his ex-girlfriend.  We've got the wanna-be law student who on one hand is a health-conscious vegetarian, while on the other hand he's looking for casual sex and drugs.  Worse?  For someone who is supposed to be an adult, he has a thirteen-year-old's reaction to naked women.  Then you have the token foreigner leading the dumb Americans around to find the best places for sex and drugs.

That's how they meet Alex, who tells them about a hostel in Eastern Europe where they can find women who will do anything.  Of course, instead of staying on their planned trip to Barcelona, they immediately hop the first train they can, head off to Eastern Europe to go stay in a hostel which is apparently not in any guidebook.

Arriving at the hostel, they leave their passports at the front desk (huh?!?) and get checked into a room, which is conveniently enough co-ed.  Our dumb heros, who think only with their little heads, eagerly follow the ladies they now room with around like sad little puppies, and each one gets picked off one by one.  Turns out the women aren't impressed with anything about our boys except that two of them are American.

The token foreigner disappears, and our American boys run around a foreign city looking for him, encountering criminally insane children.  I guess this was supposed to either be scary or remind us about the plight of the poor Eastern Europeans.  It didn't work, it just came across as goofy.

Anyway, the bookworm gets himself kidnapped while his buddy is passed out in a backroom of a bar, wakes up in a dungeon, and gets himself tortured and killed.  It didn't last long.  Then our next American hunts around the strange city, and eventually discovers all is not what it seems.  Not really much of a plot twist, if you ask me.  He gets tortured by a bungling German, and things quickly go downhill from here.  His escape was utterly laugable, and utterly unbelievable.  He has two hands hacked in half, and runs around acting like nothing is wrong.  In an attempt at redemption, he saves a young Japanese woman who has had half her face burned off.  They escape the dungeon, and thus starts our merry chase through Europe.  Mind you, it seems physically impossible that these two are even capable of moving with the extent of their injuries, but I guess that would have just gotten in the way of the rather bad plot.  The ending was terrible.  Revenge?  In his condition?  Sure.  Right. Another sad shot at redemption.

The reason I'm giving this 3 stars is mainly because of the acting.  All the characters were believable, even if unlikable and dumb as bricks.  It helped the movie move along, taking a very bizarre and unusual hunting game, and making it somewhat believable.  Additionally, I'll give the folks behind-the-scenes credit.  They didn't overdo the gore.  Personally, I didn't find the film all that gory.  They could have gone over-the-top with the gore, and from what I had heard about this film, that's exactly what I was expecting (""People passed out watching it!"", ""I couldn't watch it in one sitting, it took me three tries to watch the whole thing, I was so scared!"").  It was selectively used, and used in the right places to both frightening and comical effect.  I don't see the ""unrated edition!"" hype.  It seemed to me to be an average ""R"" film.  Finally, it was an interesting premise.  Foreigners paying the locals to find them people to kill.  A hunt where the hunter has his subjects captured for him, and then gets to torture his victim in any way he can think of.  It really was an intersting premise, even if it was poorly executed (excuse the pun).

I actually preferred ""Wolf Creek"" to this.  Same level of gore, and although it was a standard horror film premise (kids on vacation get stranded and saved by the man who eventually tries to kill them), it was put together better.  The characters were likable, I found myself rooting for them, and much like this film there was (a) an extensive lead-in before the horror kicked in, giving us the opportunity to get to know the characters, and (b) use of physical gore to surprise us, rather than the use of gore for gore's sake.

Overall, I have to say I was disappointed with this film.  It was average at best, and it was a victim of its own hype.  Had it been a small film released straight to DVD, I may have enjoyed it more.  However, it just didn't deliver the goods.  So, three stars.",1145577600,2,5184,4.5967213114754095
1555766,4,B00005JOQB,"First off,  Tarantino did not write, direct, or produce this film as many of the reviewers have stated. One look at the box and you can easily see it was presented by Tarantino (for all those out there confused it means he saw the movie, really liked it, so decided to attach his name to get it a little bit more attention). The movie was written and directed by Eli Roth who also did Cabin Fever.

The movie takes a while to get going, but once it does it doesn't let up. It quenches almost any need for excessive gore, at least with the unrated edition. You don't see this film for the story, you watch it for the incredible visuals and gore.",1145577600,,644,4.227642276422764

1555768,4,B00005JOQB,"First, forget about the sex! For those that actually watched the movie realized that one of the young men there had no intrest in either sex of drugs. It is not a soft porn movie . The movie is really about this: People pay large amounts of money so that they can have the pleasure of privately torturing,mulitating victims,absolutely anyway they want. The amount that one has to pay to victimize depends on the nationality of the victim (sucker) with American men being most in demand. Oli found these 2 American guys. He played the role of a ""dummy"" who does nothing but get stoned and dosen't care where he has sex. Oli's job was really to bring them to the hotel,which was a stopping point for death. During the visit, they are drugged and taken to the real hostel. At the real hostel,as you noticed,the guy was in one room and the lady was in the far room. Later it became clear that people(any sick individual with the money)were paying to do this to people. The sex was just a lure. The surgeon and the second assailant and the others were just people who paid the fee to do what they did. The fee had to be high because they were paid $25,000.00 just to bring the American. If you're the kind of person who falls for the sex, you would probably end up there!",1145491200,,1266,4.36864406779661
1555855,1,B00005JOQB,"And yet enough horror movie joins the horror movie craze, this time very unsuccessfully.  Quentin Tarantino's 'Hostel' was billed as 'one of the scariest American movies in decades'.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The plot is woeful and centres around a group of macho American lads out to get their bit with beautiful women.  The movie begins in Amsterdam and not content with scoring with a hooker, they are advised to travel to Slovakia where women go mad for the American accent.

Unfortunatley for them, sex don't come that easy and they are tricked into entering a house where they are sold so the hostel can torture them any way they see fit.

Scares are non-existent in this film and Tarantino makes the repetitive mistake of associating explicit gore with shock value.

This movie is possibly one of the goriest I've seen and is not for the faint hearted.  Rent something intelligent instead. And if you've gone and seen it in the cinema like I have, don't you agree it wasn't worth going even for the popcorn?",1145491200,4,1031,4.720670391061453

1555858,5,B00005JOQB,"Eli Roth further hones his visionary style of horror with HOSTEL, a buddy flick gone awry! Three travelers seek out sinful solitude in foreign territory and soon fall prey to a deceitful web of underground entrepreneurs. Unlike most horror films of the day, there is no damsel in distress... unless you count the guys. The whores who con them are as evil as they come, though, and beg little forgiveness for their deeds.
Those who realize how disjointed the process of film-making can be will appreciate what Roth has achieved in both CABIN FEVER and HOSTEL. The mood and tone of his films seamlessly shift from one extreme to the next as the movie progresses. There is generally no filler material and the pace is swift and relentless. Then he ends it with a horrifically satisfying blow to the chrome. Initially, HOSTEL it is a gradual descent into the unknown. Then, suddenly the floor drops out and you are faced with the grim matters at hand. Without giving details, I will say that this movie delivers on the gore (though you can ALWAYS have more gore), the disturbing sounds and images, the nudity and the explicit content. But it is also very entertaining, has a good story with good acting and, at times, is really funny. Anyone with a sick sense of a humor and a love for horror films is going to enjoy HOSTEL.

At first I was disappointed to find that it was written by the creator of ""Cabin Fever""--a film that I wish I could erase from my movie-going memory.  But ""Hostel"" tries to break all the rules and it delivers in that regard.  I would only recommend it to DIE hard fans of the genre, especially if you have a penchant for gore.  This movie has wall to wall blood and guts.  It even evokes some Hitchcockian elements with Americans loosed in a Slovakian country where the characters surrounding them are not on the level.  At times, the film is so gratuitous with both sex and violence, that you almost roll your eyes at how unbelievable it is.

This movie is another example.  This movie is just soft core porn at its finest.  Great if you're single and looking for that but watching it with your wife and having no idea what to expect it was annoyingly overdone.  An example, in one scene the three boys (out trying to get laid and find drugs which is all they do the entire movie) are in an apartment talking to another guy.  Not a big deal but in the background the director felt the need to keep the girl having sex right in the shot.  Another example, at one point a security guard has to get up to investigate something and they show what he was watching on his little dvd player and of course its porn, which wasn't bad but the camera stays on his little tv for what seems like forever showing it.  We got the point why overdo it? This was just two of the many many scenes where nudity and overdone sex scenes were involved. Way, way overdone.

The actual gore and violence were well done when they finally arrived.  However, it was too late and I just felt like I had seen it before.

After that...it turns into a comedy and I don't know why. Going more for laughs than screams. Once the hero frees himself he has little problem escaping and knocking off the villains one by one.

1555914,4,B00005JOQB,"In 2002 or 2003, I forget which, Eli Roth gave us ""Cabin Fever"" his first film.

I liked it, but have yet to meet a single person who also liked it. Critics hated it, the people on Amazon hate it. But, after seeing the preview for this movie during ""Saw II"" I thought it looked pretty good. Oh, and Quentin Tarantino is the Executive Producer. Basically all Tarantino did was sign on as Executive Producer, so they could put his name on their posters, and he picked up his paycheck. The thing is, Tarantino isn't one of those directors who sells out and does whatever he can for money. Tarantino liked this script or he wouldn't have had anything to do with it. I'm not saying that's a reason to see it, after all he liked ""Wolf Creek"" which I hated, so...But, horror fans should see this movie. Eli Roth still has a long way to go before making a quote ""good movie"", but Roth does know how to structure and execute a horror film. He's clearly inspired by early horror films, because this movie has exactly what those did. Lots of gore, lots of violence, lots of language, and LOTS OF NUDITY! In fact, the latter is pretty much what the entire plot of the film revolves around. The movie stars Jay Hernandez (Crazy/Beautiful) and Derek Richardson (Dumb & Dumberer) as two American college students named Paxton and Josh. Traveling with their Icelandic friend Oli (Eythor Godjonsson, who's really funny) the trio travel through Europe with the sole goal of getting laid and smoking pot. In one city, they come close (Paxton & Oli score, but Josh doesn't) and when they're kicked out of their hostel (the european named for hotel) they meet up with a creepy looking guy named Alex who tells them of beautiful women willing to do anything. All they have to do is travel to Slovakia. So, naturally they do and exactly what Alex promises them comes into focus. But, the next morning Oli is missing. So, as Paxton and Josh look for him they end up somewhere they didn't expect to end up...Which, if you've seen the previews is obviously a torture chamber. There's a ""twist"" at the end of the movie which you're given enough clues to figure out early on, but I didn't.

A lot of people write about this, which in my opinion can actually ruin the effect the end product has. But, anyways, Roth has obviously improved over ""Cabin Fever"". He's been compared to Rob Zombie, who's first film ""House of 1000 Corpses"" was recieved about as well as ""Cabin Fever"". And who's second film ""The Devil's Rejects"" got good reviews and was actually one of Quentin Tarantino's favorite movies of 2005. Well, Roth isn't better than Zombie. But, I do respect Roth for what he tries to do. He tries to entertain us, gross us out, make us flinch, and make us laugh. And he actually succeeds at all of them. Sure, not all the characters are that smart and, like all horror films, their are decisions that could be made early on in the film and save the characters life, but this is a good horror movie. It's better than ""Wolf Creek"" by quite a margin and while some recent horror films easily surpass it (The ""Saw"" series, anyone?) it's still a really good for hardcore horror fans.

1555917,5,B00005JOQB,"`Hostel', is the second film written and directed by Eli Roth, whose first film was the popular horror film, `Cabin Fever'. `Hostel' is also prominently `executive produced' by Quentin Tarantino, who seems to aspire to be the Steven Spielberg of the fantasy / horror set. Aside from a few ideas and a clip on the TV in one scene from `Pulp Fiction', it is not exactly what Tarantino lends the movie aside from his very influential name.

`Hostel' is an exceedingly scary movie, primarily because everything about its premise is totally believable. It is so believable, in fact, that the director states that the premise is based loosely on actual events. While the story has a strong affinity to `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', it may be even more powerful in that it is set in the heart of a very civilized central Europe (It was all actually filmed in and around Prague, in the Czech Republic, however, most fictional action supposedly takes place in Bratislava, in Slovakia, the other half of the former Czechoslovakia.) This simply lovely backdrop of old European civility makes the foreground story even more horrific.

I hope I don't give too much away by saying that the story actually owes a lot more to Richard Condon's short story, `The Dangerous Game' than it does to anything done by Tobe Hooper. While I have no evidence that Roth has read Condon, there have been enough knockoffs of Condon's plot that Roth probably got wind of the story line without actually reading the original short story. And, many of the images, although little of the plot, probably also owe a lot to the great Dustin Hoffman / Lawrence Olivier thriller, `Marathon Man' and its scenes of truly malicious dental torture.

While this is a strongly original horror flick, there are some weaknesses which, however, will not deter me from giving this DVD the full five stars, since the extras are so good, they easily make up for lapses due, primarily, to low budgeting. The DVD has five, count em, five commentary tracks by various combinations of director and producer, executive producer, cinematographer, and monologue. Roth says there are so many simply because he has so much to say about the film. These features make the movie an excellent purchase.

The primary weakness is the fact that the actual scenes of mayhem are almost, but not quite as good as the famous, original `Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. They will certainly not satisfy the masochists among the audience who watch `King Kong' primarily for the scene where the big ape meets the hapless blond. It is much more of a truer representative of sadism from the sadist's point of view (read the original `Justine' to see what I mean) rather than the sanitized sadism seen from the point of view of the masochist / submissive. The victims in this movie are NOT having fun.

The commentaries give a lot of information on the kinds of decisions that go into casting movies, such as the decision not to cast Rutger Hauer, for example, in the role as the lead heavy, if only because Hauer has played that role so many times before, that his appearance would give away a lot of the surprise.

There are a lot of minor plot twists that border on the brilliant in their originality. The most interesting is the role-played by the band of Bratislava street urchins. Fagin would have been proud of these lads.

A very chilling and entertaining DVD.",1145404800,3,3384,4.784246575342466

I am seriously disappointed. The best part of the whole movie was when the guys were trying to get laid. The whole ""scary"" part was soo bad. It was not disturbing , gruesome, or intense at all. I felt like they were in a really cheesy haunted house. I really expected more from a movie that was produced by Quentin.

While there are a couple of scenes that are no doubt twisted and brutal, the overall tone of the movie seems pretty confused.  The basic premise has lots of potential to thoroughly disturb, if pulled off well.  Alas, this movie struck me as a cop-out.  It has no business trying to be campy or crowd-pleasing.  The tone of this movie is all over the place and rarely dark enough to evoke any real dread (excepting the torture scenes of course).  There's no build.  No suspense.  No characters to care about.  Bad dialogue.  It's the WB on bad acid.",1145404800,,656,4.338842975206612
1555920,3,B00005JOQB,"Hostel starts out like any other horror movie does, with a couple of kids looking to have fun. In that respect, it ends the same way most horror flicks do, with a lot of blood and terror.

  The movie follows a couple of college kids who are backpacking across Europe with a somewhat off-kilter Finnish man as there self-appointed tour guide.

  The first thing I noticed about this film though was my instant dislike towards the main male characters. To sum it up, the two guys are pretty much meat heads. They are only interested in having sex, doing drugs and, errr...well, having sex. It's basically because of the trio's sex-starved minds that leads them straight to Slovakia, where someone mentions you can pretty much ""TAKE"" whatever woman you want and do ""WHATEVER YOU WANT TO THEM"" when you get them. Which, to me, was somewhat unnerving and sexist. It was hard to actually care for these characters and understand there minds when they were such pigs! They could have thrown in a character who WASN'T a homophobic, dumb, sex-obsessed jock to give viewers a little more of a likeability factor...but, that's just my opinion!!

  Anyways, I can't give much away, but the movie takes a horrific turn when one of the ""meatheads"" goes missing (Actually, The NICER meathead bites the dust first).

  Lots of extreme gore and brutality ensue in what I would consider to be one of the most DISGUSTING films I have ever seen. I am NOT a connoisseur of horror or gore, but this movie really made me flinch and feel sick. I couldn't help but feel dirty after I finished watching this movie!

  There are scenes where fingers are chopped off with excruciatingly gory results, achiles tendons are sliced open and left gaping to the viewers mortified sight, eye balls are pulled out and left hanging on a screaming victims head only to be snipped off with a scissor (the snipped off eye ball oozing cream colored puss was the most disgusting thing I have ever seen), a guy is gagged with one of those S&M type ball-gag devices and he continually vomits and chokes on it, Throats are slit, body parts are chopped...hell, there is even a scene where a gang of what appears to be kids under the ages of 10 stomp in and crush two ""bad guys"" heads.

  I have to admit that when the torture scenes occur you DO feel terrified and scared for the main characters regardless of there immature behaviors, after all, they ARE human beings, and the actors portrayed the fear and trauma of what happens incredibly well. There were truly believable performances by these young actors and I was in awe of some of the dark and shocking moments.

  You can also sense Quentin Tarrentino's prescence in this film. His influences are scattered throughout it in various small details. I found the revenge plot points towards the ending COMPLETELY Tarrentino. They almost seemed KILL BILL in there delivery.

  This movie is NOT for the squeamish. I was definetly disturbed and creeped out by Hostel. I would have given it more stars If the characters were a little more relatable (to ME personally-but we can't win um' all!) and a lot less horny.

  Be careful...if you have a weak stomach or can't handle blood and gore, you might want to pass this up! If you think you can handle the gore, try this movie out...it will definetly hook you and keep your eyes glued to the screen (before it proceeds to tear them out!)",1145318400,66,3393,4.649328859060403
1555921,4,B00005JOQB,"I've noticed many stupid things while cruising through these comments. I enjoyed Hostel in the theatre, and I have just made the dvd purchase as well. I'm at work, I'm bored, and somewhat restless. I'm a regular visitor to IMDB as well as this site, but this is the very first time I have been brave enough to take the dark trek into this so called fan-zone...(or maybe ""fan-abyss"" is a more appropriate label). It's nice to see that some people appreciate this film. However, for others to dwell on the plot and all of its inaccuracies is just pathetic. I guess when I was twelve I also had a lot of time on my hands.

This film was an enjoyable horror film....let's leave it at that. A certain individual here hails this work as a ""soft-core insult to horror films"". As far as I can remember, sex has always played a pivotal role in the horror genre. In my opinion, the drastic shift from playful, explicit sexual shenanigans to full-out horrific assault, is genius! Unexpected things happen...yes..when you least expect them. Chew on those words of wisdom for a few minutes and a couple seconds! You could be sitting in your car one minute, then be strapped to a gurny the next. The unexpected is what drives horror.

The annoying term ""misogyny"" is always slid under the creaking door of horror film reviews. Who cares? Let's face it, this genre is aimed at males aged 12-35....give or take a few years. If you want Fried Green Tomotoes, then shimmy on down to the local WalMart, sniff around the dusty bargain bins and you may be rewarded with chick-flick cuddliness. Was that a misogynist comment? Probably....you see I am a man. I don't have a vagina. My girlfriend loves horror films and would never use that dreaded term 'cause she is intelligent enough to know what these films are all about. To call Hostel ""soft-core""...is like calling Showgirls a good movie.....there's a point in there somewhere....if you find it let me know. Here's my review......Hostel is a good movie....take it or leave it!",1145318400,11,2009,4.688385269121813
1555922,2,B00005JOQB,"I'm a huge horror movie fan, for me the gorier the better. So, I picked up a copy of Hostel on DVD. The first half of the movie, in my opinion, was boring as hell. The first half consisted of talking, sex, talking, sex, talking...did I mention sex? If I wanted to see so much sex I'd watch a porno flick. I like horror movies that start right away, and have gore throughout. This movie seriously lacked the action through the first hour of the movie. On a more positive note, the last 35 minutes of the movie caught my attention. So, my advice: Skip to chapter 18 on the DVD and watch the last half. There are chopped off body parts, an eye popped out, and blood everywhere. If you're like me and love gore, you'll probably find the first hour of this movie a big bore, but will be entertained by the last half hour.",1145318400,,816,4.203821656050955

Just to let you know, the first 40 or so minutes of this film is straight porn.  When watching a horror film, I expect to see more... well horror.  The idea of the film is actually interesting and it could have been a good horror film, but with the delay of the plot due to pointless nudity, the film lost my interest fast.  Because of waste of half the film there was not enough time to spend on the actual point of the film.  I can only imagine that the unrated version is just more nudity.  If you want a soft porn mixed with some gruesome death, then go ahead, but if you want a true horror film, definitely look ELSEWHERE!",1145318400,8,765,4.135135135135135
1555978,5,B00005JOQB,"This film was one of the greatest horror I've seen in a long while. The story is somewhat original, a bunch of horny guys go backpacking through Europe and encounter a strange and dangerous buisness where people are allowed to pay to kill and torture total strangers to satisfy their own sick and demented needs. The group of guys get slowly pulled in one by one into the buisness, meaning they are kiddnapped by the employees as victims for the customers to kill. We then each see the guys get tortured and hurt one by one by sick people who may or may not reveal their interesting back history and their sick motives. This horror flick didn't get grusome until about 40 minutes in, and thats fine with all the events leading up to the end. This film will keep the gore-hounds howling as each kill gets more horrific and disturbing leading up to the end with deaths that made even me, a hard core horror fan, make my stomach twirl. A must see for hard core fans only, definetly not for the squeamish or faint of heart!

1555979,4,B00005JOQB,"Now this was a horror movie. You all probably know what its about so I won't elaborate about it here. Director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) has made one hell of a horror movie. Finally an original horror movie. I'm so sick of the redundant slashers, remakes (sans a few) and crap that they throw out nowadays. This was quite a refreshing movie.

What made this movie great? First off a solid cast. Jay Hernandez does an excellent job in his role, he stands out among the rest in my opinion but that's not to say that the others were bad, they were good as well, Jan Vlasak, who played a business man on a trip to the same place, took the role of the main villain (even though he might not quite be the real bad guy) and he was great as well, really creepy. I know the one question, for those who haven't seen it, as you're reading this: ""Is it really that gory/disturbing/bloody?"" The answer is: No. It's not as bad as you think it will be. Sure there's blood, sure there's torture but not to the extent that its played out to be. Alot of it is suggested. Of course, that's not to say that its a slouch in the gore department. There are plenty of dismemberments and moments that'll make you cringe. The movie gets off to a fairly slow start. There's lots of nudity (Roth even gets away with a full frontal) for the first half and throughout that first half there isn't really any horror aspects. I think Roth put so much nudity in to take the MPAA's attention from the torture. It worked too, I can't believe this movie didn't get slapped with an NC-17. It's a dark toned movie with blood and torture and nudity. Once we get to the second half, the parts that everyone really came to see, we get a hell of a show though. One problem though is that at some points the movie is so dark (contrast-wise) that you can't see what's going on most notably during the ""eye"" scene, there was a clip posted on the internet, dunno if anyone caught it. Anyways, it actually looked much better and much more convincing on the screen than it did during that clip on the internet, it also doesn't fade to black when he's cutting the eye out either like it did in the clip, the camera stays right on the face and damn is it great. I don't think that was done on purpose to make you think you're seeing something and make it more intense, it's just too dark, they should really think about lighting it up for the DVD release. Now I'm going to compare these two movies now; it was more intense than last October's release of Saw II. Much more. I guess the one major flaw is that it takes so long to really get going that it seems over a little quickly. Call me sick but I came for some gore and torture and I think that they could've shown more torture and really gotten to the audience. Don't get me wrong though, what they did show was freaking awesome! Now, I'm not saying that movie need a ton of gore, that's not what makes a movie, not at all. A horror flick needs suspense and this movie has suspense and lots of it. Don't let the slow start sway you though, it's not boring (the first half) it does set you up for the rest of the movie and makes you feel like the friends are really connected. So no, this movie is not perfect but it's a great one, certainly one I'll pick up on DVD when it hits around May-June (in the inevitable Unrated release). The score was pretty good, nothing over the top but that may have been a good thing. Oh and another problem that just came to me was that Roth uses the F-Bomb way too much. I understand in some parts, hell if that was me getting tortured or in those situations I'd be yelling it out too but he used it at such awkward times, it's like he just said ""Hey, let's use that here!"". After this movie, I vowed to never EVER hit a Slovokian city. Check that one off the list (not that it was ever on...).

So yeah, this was a good horror movie. I didn't really touch on everything (I don't think) so I may go back and edit this later if I think of something else to say. So if you're a horror fan then do yourself a favor and see Eli Roth's Hostel.",1145232000,2,4072,4.185987261146497
1555980,5,B00005JOQB,"This movie shows the sickness of the rich people and their bestiality. Shows that they 're always

doing anything they want to satisfy their sickness, with the power of money without consequences.

The movie shows that corruption rules everywhere without exceptions....

The similarity of images are incredible! At start  i.e the whorehouse @ Amsterdam  with the cenral hall and the

rooms on both sides, had similar characteristics with the slaughter @ Bratislava. The only

difference its just in the ""pleasure"" level.

I think the conclusion has a deeper meaning. The prostitution in Amsterdam (and in general)

in the most of cases, hides definitely a form of slavery. The movie just shows something like that

on a ""higher"" level.

Just remember the many cases of worker girls @ North Mexico who they re working on the factories

and witch they have abducted from the big bosses (of course they 're drug dealers, coca producers) who they rule all the local authorities, army and government.

When a woman on a N. Mexico abducted, the dissapearance holds a few days and then the police locates

Following in the popularity of ""Saw"", ""Hostel"" is another chapter in the psychological chop-'em-up. Pretty simple story, about 3 young tourists who are lured to a youth hostel in an obscure eastern Europe town. Typical teen dangers arise ( sex, drugs, and strangers) that always result in trouble.

The movie does have moments of inspired tension, with it's ghostly town residents,a concrete killing field,and it's redemptive finale. It even tried to make the characters 3 dimensional ( could the virginal friend be [...]? What fuels our hero? and we have a promiscuous...father? ), but it seemed there wasn't enough time to care about those shadings, and instead of a paint brush.. here comes the axe... or chainsaw, or blow torch, or machete, or hammer.. at one point it's like shopping in aisle 5 at your local home depot.

Some of the scenes are disgusting, but i've seen more inspired horror scenes. I think some of the most horrific things that happen in the film, actually don't involve the aforementioned utensils, but how people care so little about a fellow human being.

This is obviously geared towards 18-30 males, but it's also a good movie with your girlfriend (if she isn't squemish). In this genre of movie, I honestly couldn't think of a better way to make this. I'm not even a big fan of Tarantino, but this is SUPERB movie making. From start to finish. PERIOD.

Let me state why this movie is one of the best or perhaps the greatest thriller of all time. It's not so much a horror flick, as more of a crazy (yet very possible) suspense movie.

1) The location. I've been to Prague (they filmed near Prague). This town the movie takes place in has the look AND feel of a Slovakian city. Eastern Europe. Old cars, very old yet beautiful buildings, gangs, GRAFITTI (anyone that's been to eastern Europe will see LOTS of grafitti). It really makes you feel like you're there. Great film work. Even the cheesy 80's sounding rock in the ""disco"". Tarantino and Roth really know how to research!

2) The actors. No namers, but yet VERY good at playing their roles. Even down to the 'friendly' student-aged hostel employees (most hostels are run by backpackers trying to make some extra cash). The women DEFINITELY portray crazy party girls from eastern europe (one girl is from Russia, the other Prague). Of course, it doesn't hurt that they are very attractive. The German guy is also a PERFECT match for his role. Oli, the Icelandish guy is also INCREDIBLE in this movie.

3)The story. Yes, it's hedonistic (partying, drinking, drugs, sex). But that's what a lot of American teens think they will get in places like Amsterdam. Not too off target.

also the idea of the hostel is based on the idea of ""tourist traps"" that americans can find themselves in. They definitely TARGET americans to get their money somehow.

4) The senseless violence. Like it or not, there are a LOT of people in this world that hate Americans, yet they've never even met one. If you watch closely, you'll see that they also target Russians and Germans in this movie. Obviously Eastern Europe is not very fond of these people (see World War II/Cold War). The violence itself is disgusting, yet realistic. It looks very real, which makes it even scarier.

5) **** SPOILER *******

The revenge in this movie is the best I've ever seen. Easily beating Brotherhood of the Wolf and the Count of Monte Cristo (two of my favorite revenge themed movies).

If you believe in Karma, this will surely make you feel relieved when you see what happens when you break 'the golden rule'.

Hostel's sick concept of an elite pay-to-torture club comprised of ""successful"" folks seemed not so far out to me, since when Hostel came out in the theater, Florida news included men lured by 2 internet friends for torture and/or murder, serial beatings of the homeless, and a guy paying for busfare and hotel so that he could hunt humans in a state park!  Though Hostel is not some deep movie with multiple themes and metaphors, I appreciate the movie for sparking thought on the extent of human depravity, since recognition of sickness is a step to treatment.

It is a horror movie plain and simple.  People that went in looking for plot and meaning obviously didn't watch the commercials or make note of the director.

BUT, by watching the commercials it was also built up to be one of THE MOST horrifying and shocking movies of its kind due to the GRAFFIC torture scenes.

In my opinion, none of these is true. The idea was there, but it visually failed.  Everything is a cutaway or the actual torture is blocked by the subjugator or it is just alluded to by shadows.  I wanted my money back.

I saw it the Wednesday after it was released and I heard rumor that after the first weekend it was edited. .........This is why I will purchase the unrated version in hopes that it will redeem itself.",1143849600,6,888,4.345454545454546

Maybe you like older movies, maybe you like love stories, maybe you like a film to be uplifiting.  Whatever you like it is not horror.  Sure, there are plot holes (all horror movies have those) and yes it has SO MUCH gore and nudity(which a horror movie is naked without) it offends you.  But who asked you to watch this and rip it apart.

I love movies in general, own a couple hundred.  I saw this in the theater because I enjoyed the very humerous Cabin Fever and Eli Roth as a director in general.  If you like movies and can enjoy good humor watch the cabin fever extras.  So simple and funny.  And Eli Roth appearing in Both Cabin Fever and Hostel was really funny, I dug his cameos.

1556236,3,B00005JOQB,"""Saw"" series fans take note: ""Hostel"" is the latest gore-filled cinematic treat of choice. Its brutal torture scenes, though they could have been far more graphic, are sure to titillate drama lovers' darker sides. The plot revolves around an Eastern European warehouse where visitors can pay to torture and kill captured victims.

The film, however, has a number of important problems. For one, the first half-hour or so is pure sex, chronicling how three young males are captured by Slovakian hunters masquerading as loose women. Not to object to 30 minutes of nonstop boobage, but it really isn't that integral to the storyline.

Secondly, the ending sequence is so happy it's absurd (well, maybe ""happy"" isn't the right word for it). The audience enjoys what happens, but believability takes a backseat to the catharsis.

Finally, there is obviously some kind of statement in that Americans are worth the most for torture, either because they're rarer in this corner of the world or because America is, you know, evil and all that. It's hard to tell what Roth was going for here, but as commentary it's mildly troubling instead of convincing, incisive or perceptive.

Essentially, ""Hostel"" is a worthwhile soft-core porn/gruesome horror flick, but its plot problems leave it far short of classic status.",1143676800,7,1306,5.117370892018779

1556240,3,B00005JOQB,"Hostel is a pretty good movie from the director (Eli Roth) of the crappy Cabin Fever.  Almost like a snuff movie, Hostel has lots of European female nudity and bucket loads of violence.  If you like these two, this movie is for you.  Torture scenes are well done with some realism (despite the fact Hostel only cost 4 million), but I had hoped for more violence and torture.  Hostel also has a lot of laugh-out-loud moments.  From a woman getting run over by a car and a gang of dangerous children smashing in a guys head with a brick.

1556241,1,B00005JOQB,"There's nothing good about 'Hostel'. That's all you need to know.

But since I do so love writing reviews, let me explain to you why there's nothing good about it.

The basic plot concerns two monosyllabic and broadly-drawn sex hounds, (played so amateurishly by Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson: a tip, boys - find new careers!) and their new friend John Q. European, as they trek across bog-standard European cities in search of new sexual conquests. At the recommendation of a friendly Russian pimp, they head to Bratslava, to seek out girls he's shown them photos of (it must be said, the three dames in the snapshots look exactly like all the other prostitutes and loose club women they've met so far, but hey, beauty's in the eye of the beholder, right?) and be treated like the whitebread Kings Of Western Capitalism that they are.

Or so the picture would have you believe. From there on in, 'Hostel' becomes a mere parody of a parody: pathetic make-up effects, totally unoriginal direction and a climax so predictable as to inspire deja-vu merely add to the preposterousness and general boredom brought on by the first thirty minutes of the movie.

I love unnessecary violence in movies. Ditto gore. And no, movies of this genre don't really need Pulitzer-worthy dialogue in order to achieve their aims. Examples of This Sort Of Thing that work can be seen in 'Saw' and in the fight sequences in 'Kill Bill'. The directors there knew what they were doing! But the problem with 'Hostel' isn't really with the script (or what seems to pass for a script, here), nor is it with the overall low standard of performances given by the lead 'actors'. No, the real fault must once more lie with that notorious hack, Eli Roth. How, tell me, can you show a respect or a sense of affinity with your chosen genre when all you do with your movies is rehash (badly!) the same kinds of camera angles and visual devices as those movies that have gone before you? Fans of Roth will claim otherwise; fine, but I have to wonder how respectful it is to reproduce someone else's work at a lower grade of quality and call it your own?

I really should point out the lousy special effects, too. If you're going to be voyeuristic and gory, then for heaven's sake, do it properly. Yellow goo, bright scarlet blood and rubber fingers just won't cut it anymore.

You can see the themes of nihilistic social commentary and anti-American, anti-European, anti-Sexism, anti-whateverthehell coming a mile off, and that puts paid to any satisfaction we might have gained from a carefully-planned subtext. So Jay Hernandez's character starts out shallow and ends up a murderer, so what? How is it possible to be interested in the escapades of a movie antihero whose sole traits are irresponsibility and gross ignorance? And to make matters worse, the script attempts to give him a little depth, a little raison d'etre, with a mawkish Hallmark-style tale of how he saw a kid drown when he was nine. Why bother, when clearly the character is 'designed' to make you not like him in the first place? The end result is confusing and throwaway.

'Hostel' is full of these little contradictions, these self-defeating conflicts of characterisation and idealogy that ruin what little interesting premise it had to begin with. When you add to this the total banality of the visuals and even the lack of interesting dialogue, what you're left with is a wasted 90 minutes and yet another totally substandard DVD movie, gathering dust on your shelf.

Avoid it.",1143331200,9,3523,4.782894736842105

all you people that are sayin cabin fever was one of the worst horror films ever, it was a comedy. I read that somewhere before.

And secondly, stop taking a film so personal, if it was meant to judge the American and European cultures than it would probably be far more political and culturally aimed.

This film is great, it's what the target audience (which I'm guessing is teenagers 16-18, yes I know the film is rated 18, but not by the filmmakers.) anyway, it's what the target audience likes to see these days, blood gore and human torture. Sad, but true.

How anyone can claim it is the scariest american movie in 10 years is beyond me. The first half of the film contains absolutely no scares whatsoever. Just the typical story of 3 backpackers looking to get laid. Initially helped out by the 'friendly locals who turn out to have a hidden agenda (oooh!)(See Wolf Creek - just as bad) Unfortunately what it lacks in originality it doesn't make up for in any other area. The gory scenes in the second half are totally over the top and unoriginal. The only thing that makes a film like this even remotely scary is the fact that you think woahh! tht could really happen!. Yes, and so could alot of other things. Films like this are having to get bloodier and bloodier to try and shock the audience but it just doesn't work. I've seen 100's of horror films over the years and this one rates near the bottom. Why Quentin Tarrantino has got involved I will never know.

It also has no ending, it merely comes to an abrupt halt, which in retrospect is much more welcoming than having to sit thorugh another hour.

The story is - 3 backpackers head to slovakia on the promise of hot girls, which there are and so the first half becomes a soft core porn flick. these girls then drug the backpackers and deliver them to a place where you can pay to torture people. one escapes, comes across one of the torturers and then kills him. This pointless waste of money only gains one star for at least being an interesting idea. unfortunately it suffers from an appaling script and stunning lack of direction.

1556325,5,B00005JOQB,"Okay, I watched this last night and I have to say that Hostel is:A- by no means overhyped, B- not for everybody(especially kids), and C- IMO, the best horror movie I've seen in a long time. Without giving too much of the movie away, here's a synopsis. 3 guys, 2 americans and 1 from Iceland, are in Amsterdam looking to get high, laid, etc. They have a grand old time doing all this but get greedy and want more. So some guy tells them about a hostel in Bratislava where the women do anything you want. They go, meet girls, drink, smoke, and have sex, blah, blah, blah. Then, all of a sudden one comes up missing. Now it's investigation time(Quick Scoob, to the Mystery Machine!!!).

Anyway, what happens from this point is something that we have all seen in movies such as Hard Target and Surviving the Game. This however, is extremely more brutal than both of those put together. For those unfamiliar with the mentioned movies, it pretty much goes like this......rich folks pay x amount of dough to be able to torture and kill people without any reprocussions.

Hostel does take a little while for the goodies to start happening, but there is plenty to keep you occupied until then. If you don't mind the unGodly amount of nipplage(i loved it!!!). And once the nastiness starts...........Damn!

Very visual (i.e. gory) film, but what I found even more f'd up was the audio in this movie. These people were awake while being tortured and the screams and pleas of the victims were ultra-unsettling.

All said and done, Eli and Quentin did a kick ass job with this movie. Be warned, this is for those of us with strong stomachs and those of us who have a firm grip on reality. Not for kids and not for fans of The Grudge and The Ring(ooh those were soooooo scary). I love twisted horror and recommend Hostel to those who feel the same. I cannot wait to get my hands on the unrated version. I know there has to be some stuff that was left on the cutting room floor(no pun intended). Grow a pair and check it out.

1556326,3,B00005JOQB,"This movie is somewhat of a step up from Eli Roth's first uber-terrible and sucky film ""Cabin Fever"".  ""Hostel"" is the story of three friends that go backpackpacking through Europe. They arrive in Amsterdam, where they encounter all the sex, and drugs that they can handle.  They learn of a hostel just outside of town. They are told that there are beautiful gilrs everywhere you look. And the girls are more than willing to do ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING you ask them to. The guys decide to check it out. Later on that night, the guys go to a club in town and hook up with these two girls that are there. Mad props to the casting director for casting these two girls. They were that hotness. Anyway, back to the review. After the guys meet the girls, things take a visceral, violent turn for the worst.  I had high hopes for this movie because one of my favorite directors, Quentin Tarantino, is one the producers of this movie. I was however, very disappointed. It wasn't even scary!  And the torture scenes weren't even all that bad!  I'll probably rent the DVD when it comes out so I can see the stuff I couldn't see at the theater.  This is DEFINITELY not a kid's film.

The,n they stumble upon two girls, who end up being apart of the plan. I think it's nice how it all unravels to where everybody they met were involved in this torture somehow, but what it's about doesn't really fit the screenplay: The movie summarized is about a bunch of college guys going to Amsterdam looking for a good time, and end up being part of a legal torture chamber where people pay to torture helpless, innocent victims.

It's graphic for a mainstream movie, but it could of went further and there is for sure more disturbing movies, for example an eye gouging scene - the most graphic gore in the movie - we seen before and better in Miike's ""Audition"", or Fulci's ""Zombie""  with a spike or even in Bourke's ""Last Exit"" effort with a blunt spoon.

Huge improvement over the ""Cabin Fever"". It actually reminded more of ""Saw"" more than anything else.

1556444,1,B00005JOQB,"I am a first generation American with very close ties to his European roots.  I love Europe and have visited many European countries, including Slovakia.  I am not of Slovakian heritage, but this has not prevented me from deeply appreciating this beautiful country, its culture, and its people.

Eli Roth, however, has no sense of any aesthetic appreciation for anything of worth.  Instead, he apparently must take the beautiful and destroy it with a hideous presentation of falsehood.

Roth presents Americans as a bunch of moronic heathens; European youth as stupid mindless buffoons; European women as cheap whores; and Europe as some abandoned no-man's land of a nightmarish post-industrial ruined landscape.  This is not Europe or how European women are in general; nor is it how Slovakia is specifically.  And if Eli Roth ever spent any time in these beautiful countries, he'd have known better.

I wish to impress upon some of the Slovakian reviwers below or others coming here to read this, that just like in any country you have stupid money-obessed people, such as Eli Roth.  Most Americans are decent people, not wishing to see violence or thinking such stupid ideas of another's culture.  At the end of the day, when all is said and done, beyond race, culture, or gender, we are someone's son or daughter, perhaps a father or mother, and more than anything else--part of the human race.

On  that note, what makes a good movie for me is one that highlights our common humanity and is universal to whomever watches it.  Here in the US, many film producers make the big boom-bang ""Star Wars"" kind of movies.  They are nice to look at and sometimes have a nice story, but usually it is the special effects that rule.  In Europe in contrast, the human story rules, and I love that.  American films, however, sometimes have a great story to tell.  Just think of ""Cinderella Man"" that came out last year (a beautiful and true stroy of early generation Americans suffering the Great Depression as told from the life of an older boxer).  In movies like this, you see the humanity in everyone.

But what has Eli Roth made?  Garbage!  Just pure garbage.  There is no story here.  There is no sense of humanity.  Everything is evil in mankind and the world, if we are to believe Mr. Roth's warped, disgusting world view.  Life itself is but death and its only purpose, according to Roth's presentation, is to destroy--not celebrate our common unity and humanity.

Never have I seen a more shameful, awlful film like this before.  It genuinely left me feeling ashamed that an American had any part in making this stupid film.

I personally do not get the appeal of these movies (and I am not a squeamish one who is easily disturbed by the sight of blood).  What I found disturbing about this film is its celebratory nature of the violence that it glorified in its presentation.  This is not art--but as far as I am concerned, it was an act of cinematic defecation.",1141171200,4,2964,4.732421875

However, Hostel is quite unrealistic whereas a film like ""Wolf Creek"" is actually based on true events of missing backpackers, so the scenes of torture are incredibly disturbing and much more believable than those depicted in Hostel.

One reviewer on another site said that the good thing about the film is seeing Americans get what they deserve for their over-confidence and the way they think they are so much better than any other nation.  Well, that is one persons' opinion ... but it was kind of fun to see some American teenagers getting their just desserts after all those ridiculous teenage road movies which are nothing but degradation of women.

basically, what Roth did here, was take the (brilliant) torture scene from Audition and turn it into an hour and a half of ""let's try to shock the same people who went to see Lord of the Rings 600 times.""

because let's face it, this is a mainstream horror film, and it can't POSSIBLY be nearly as bad as, say, Salo.

Cabin Fever was, without a doubt, one of the WORST horror films i've ever seen, and just generally one of the worst films of all time, so it's only natural that this one eats a big one.

Roth can kiss Takashi Miike's sphincter as much as he wants, but it will NEVER get me to pay any amount of money to see one of his films.  and now he's doing a film with Tarantino and Robert Rodrigues which, OH HOW IRONIC, is two horror films and in the middle fake horror trailers (now, who would ever think that Tarantino would go and rip off an Asian film? [Three...Extremes}

so, to conclude this rant, i'd like to take the time to say:

if you think this film is awesome, great, violent, cool, good or even mediocre, do me a sweet favor and stop wasting my air.

i'd recommend some films that actually ARE sick, depraved and disturbing, but if you liked this film, i don't want you anywhere NEAR the stuff i like.",1141171200,3,1455,4.239130434782608
1556448,3,B00005JOQB,"I may be one of the few people who actually enjoyed Eli Roth's first film, Cabin Fever, despite the many inherent flaws to the story, direction and all-over-the-place feel. I never bought into the tagline for that film as once of the most horrific films this generation. I've been watching horror films for as long as I can remember and Cabin Fever doesn't even scratch the surface of what constitutes a great horror film. But it did show me that Eli Roth was serious about genre and acknowledges and honors his roots and influences.

Hostel is Roth's sophomore effort, and just like Rob Zombie with his second film (The Devil's Rejects) he shows improvement as a filmmaker and continues to show that he respects the genre he's chosen to be in. Hostel is an exercise in hate, pain and nihilism. There really are no sympathetic characters in the film. Roth instead shows just how debased, cruel and inhumane people can be towards each other. Whether its through verbal, physical and intellectual means. I must point out that this film is not the torture-porn that alot of media-types call it. The gore and torture really doesn't start until fully halfway into the film. Everything before the second half begins can be summed us as soft-core porn. There's alot of nudity and sex in this first half and sets-up the three characters played by Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson and Eythor Gudjonsson.

These three college students are shown as boorish, misogynistic, insensitive louts who wish nothing more from their European vacation than sex, drugs, sex, drugs and more sex. It's this behavior that lures them to a town in Slovakia. An Eastern European, Soviet Bloc-era town where the women are stunning and horny to do whatever with foreign men. So, the trio takes off for this haven of horny, easy, beautiful women and the soft-core porn sequences continues once they arrive. But intermixed within these sequences are small bits and hints of dread and uneasiness. There's a certain sense of decay to the town and its inhabitants despite the normal scenery.

The second half promptly begins once they arrive in town and check into the hsotel. The gore mentioned by most reviewers are pretty graphic for what was finally given an R-rating. For people like myself and other horror aficionados the gore in Hostel is something we haven't seen before. The gore and torture scenes are in-your-face and Roth owes alot of thanks to Takashi Miike's Audition in how the scenes are presented. Roth's style of directing Hostel really brings to mind Miike's cult favorite. Takashi Miike even makes a brief appearance in the film.

One thing that I wanted Roth to do which he seemed to have pulled back from was going all-out in presenting Hostel as a horror exploitation film. This film tries to emulate the gory exploitation Italian and American films of the mid-70's to early 80's. Maybe the MPAA had forced Roth to trim certain scenes to get an R-rating. In certain scenes one could almost feel and sense that something was left out. Maybe the DVD release with an unrated, director's cut will shed some light to this. Roth's influences are plain to see, but he falls slightly short of reaching the lofty heights that Romero, Miike, Fulci, Craven (early), Hooper, Gordon and Argento established with their grand guignol works.

Hostel is a very good second offering from Eli Roth who really seem to like the horror genre and is constantly trying to pay it homage. His direction is much better and gone are the campy, almost comedic sequences from Cabin Fever. The film does fail to convey anything original to the genre, but succeeds enough in honoring its bloody past. Roth went from a genre-hack to very promising horror auteur with Hostel. I am hoping his next project is less of an homage to horror's past and he actually adds to its future legacy. I'm happy to give this film a grade of 7/10.",1140998400,174,3883,4.815592203898051
1556449,5,B00005JOQB,"Leave it all behind at the door. I expected this to be a quick fix SAW type movie directed by the interesting Eli Roth and what we get is a 21st century rendition of something like ""Last House on the Left"" multiplied by ""I spit on your Grave"" plus a bit of Hitchcock in the mix and some Jap horror and we got ourselves an impressive movie that was a hell of a lot better than what it should have been. In fact, next to ""The Descent"", this is one of the best horrors I have seen in a long long time, another genre reviver and a lot more than just the popcorn fodder that SAW dished up. Memorable scenes include the goofy accountant type sadist, an eye scene, messy heels, a train and some choky vomit. I highly recommend that anyone who has the stomach for it, go watch it, and certainly those who have a taste for the aforementioned type of splatter masterpieces, well what more can we say than Roth knows how to do it right... and with two severed fingers... I mean... a cherry on top. It even had loads of high suspense towards the end. Yeah, I dig this one like I would a grave for an airhead hooker who just got her cap bust for my giggles. This indie movie is all like that kind of sensibility. Not for the masses. Oh the joy!",1140739200,5,1231,4.133333333333334
1556450,4,B00005JOQB,"Wow... I didn't expect ""Hostel"" to be so vicious. I can't recall any American director making such violent and brutal movies as this one.

Three friends who travel in Europe looking for some good time (sex, drugs & rock'n'roll), finally find themselves in a little Slovakian town, in a hostel where everything seems to fit their idea of heaven on Earth. And as it's easy to imagine, soon this heaven turns into hell or even worse.

And so ""Hostel"" starting as an average teenage sex-comedy, closer to its second half turns into a bloody mess. But not that stupid teen slasher bloody mess - I mean real sick and horrid bloody mess.

Directors used to fight for appropriate ratings for their films lately, hence we don't get to see pictures that are SO gory very often. Eli Roth obviously doesn't care about ratings, so ""Hostel"" turned out to be everything a true horror fan can only dream of. His film is full of gore, severed limbs, sweat and vomit. Believe me, for a long time we haven't seen such a brutal, twisted and in-your-face picture as Eli Roth's ""Hostel"". But it's far from being perfect though. It's extremely disturbing and nauseous, as a horror fan I liked it a lot, but there's still something missing. Some characters' development maybe, some sense... It seemed that trying to shock the audience, the makers of the film forgot why they'd decided to make it in the first place. But it's just the second big movie of Roth, he's young and very talented, I'm sure he'll give the fans hell in the nearest future.

Interesting observation - I just watched ""Hostel"" in theater, and after the film people were lowering their eyes as if they were ashamed they were watching it. That's what I call a good horror movie!",1140652800,4,1723,4.639344262295082
1556535,5,B00005JOQB,"but is is still prone to rampant borrowing.  Then again, that is to be expected from Eli Roth, especially in a film produced by Tarantino.  We used to be the most copied in this genre, especially evident in Fulci's beloved Zombie (Zombi 2) being released in Italy as a sequel to Dawn of the Dead (Zombi).  Many have seen Roth's fellacious review of Audition on the ""100 Scariest Moments in Horror"" (on Bravo I think?).  After seeing his review, and the subsequent re-distribution by Lions Gate, I knew his next project would be heavily Miike influenced.  However, I was impressed by the originality and morality of the story, which is very American (Romero, for example), but is also inherent to the Horror genre as a whole.  I was also impressed with Miike's cameo in the film.  The film is not preachy, but very bleak in its explorations.  The masses may have forgotten, but Horror is always some sort of morality lesson, ""these are all the bad things that happen if you do this.""  Roth is a very intelligent writer and Hostel shows the severity of his message.  The rampant drugs and nudity in the movie are necessary, because of how we are enticed by them.  I was excited when the nudity started because nudity, especially full frontal, is a sign that the censors were tested as far as possible, which means more gore, though I'm positive that many of the shots were sustained much longer than shown (I'm very excited for the unrated version).  If these women are to be reduced to mere objects, then the American men as torture victims is an equal exploitation.  Too often, American men, specifically certain groups, travel to other countries for the sole reason of obtaining sex, usually in a fetish context (ie for their youth, their nationality, their expendability).  This film shows what can happen when one goes to a foreign country for the purposes of satisfying carnal, or depraved, desires.

Get the unrated version.  Anyone ""too sensitive"" wouldn't want to see this movie anyway (even with an R rating), plus unrated editions generally have more features.

I would also recommend Miike's Audition if you liked this movie, not just to see the similarities and such, but because it is a fine film.  The Lions Gate release has a good amount of bonus material and is very reasonably priced.",1140566400,7,2300,4.765151515151516

My suggestion and advice? Next time you will make a movie, set the movie in non-existing, fictive country - the same as your story.

Yes, it is a horror movie. Yes, it does contain a lot of horror movie requisites (Severed limbs, blood, excessive gore, and a little T&A), however, it is not you're average horror film.

Hostel follows a group of travellers from the USA, who head on over to Europe, to get stoned, and to get off. They constantly search for the next thrill, and when a few Slovak girls promise to take them to a hostel where sexy Slovak girls will do anything for foreigners, they eagerly follow. Well, you can pretty much guess what happens next. Instead of beautiful naked girls, kissing the guys' feet, they are captured, tortured, and eventually killed, by people who pay x-amounts of money to capture and torture people, because it is a thrill, and a high for them.

Eli Roth wrote and directed a brilliant film, that raises important and intellegent questions about human nature. I don't know about you, but after I left the theater, I certainly was asking myself a lot of questions. Why are people like this? Why do they like doing this? Am I possible of doing such things!!??

True, the film is brutally gory, and some people gagged, threw up, and left the theater during the film, but there is no denying Hostel's ability to increase you're threshold, and to raise great questions.",1140480000,3,1470,4.556818181818182

1556539,5,B00005JOQB,"Eli Roth is quickly making a huge name for himself in the modern world of horror filmmaking.  With the debut Cabin Fever, Roth showed us his wide, unflinching knowledge of the great horror movies from the 70s and 80s that gave him his inspiration.  While Cabin Fever was more of an homage film, with story not really being the focal point, Hostel is pretty much a straigt-up horror film, and a great one at that.

Josh and Paxton are two American backpackers in college who are taking a road trip to Europe to get away and relax before they both go into the next phase of their lives (law school, etc.).  Along their trip, they meet up with Oli, an Icleandic backpacker who is just as wild and offensive as the two Americans.  We aren't really engineered to care much about these main characters.  The first half of the movie is more about all the wild, deranged things that go on in Europe, and how easy it is to get women, drugs, or whatever you want.  Basically a soft-core porn film, the opening 45 minutes of Hostel serves purely as setup for the horrible, disgusting things that we all know are coming.  After visiting a hostel in Bratislava, Josh and Paxton get a little worried when Oli disappears without a word of goodbye or anything.  So they both set out to find out what happened to them, and they both get lured into the trap that has been set for many young, stupid foreigners to get what's coming to them.

Once the torture sequences start, the movie changes completely, obviously.  Surprisingly, I found none of the gore really shocking, or anything that new to me, but then again, I have seen pretty much any horror movie you can name.  The gore isn't amazing, but the acting is surprisingly good, and the atmosphere is truly amazing, creepy, and disconcerting.  Rather than being a real ""horror"" film, this movie falls more into the ""shock and disgust"" category than it does into the scare category.

Eli Roth really has grown as a filmmaker.  If you watch Cabin Fever, and then watch Hostel, you can see many differences that make Hostel a much better movie.  Hostel is much more suttle and controlled than Cabin Fever was.  Cabin Fever was so chaotic and random, that you didn't know what was going on half the time.  Hostel, on the other hand, knows exactly what it wants to do, and the entire movie is focused around making a singular point.  Also, I loved the ending of Hostel.  I know a lot of people who were disappointed and thought it was too cliched, but personally, I thought that it was a well thought out ending, and it didn't make the viewers leave the theater feeling absolutely depressed and suicidal.

The other part of Hostel that I loved was a single scene near the end of the film, when one of the characters actually gets dragged into a conversation with one of the torturers.  This dialogue is great, and it is with this dialogue that Roth makes the point he wants to make with this movie.  You can really take any point you want out of it, but I felt that Roth was trying to send a message about human nature, and the dark rivers that run throughout each of us at certain moments of time.  Let's just say that Sigmund Freud would love this movie.",1140220800,4,3188,4.4852686308492205
1556540,5,B00005JOQB,"""Hostel,"" Eli Roth's follow up to the disease ridden ""Cabin Fever,"" has everything a true horror fan could possibly want.  It's gory, disturbing, violent, and full of nudity and drug use.  I was most impressed with the ORIGINAL story line, which was such a disturbing concept that it haunted me for days.  It was so nice to see a horror film in theaters that wasn't a remake.

This DVD should be spectacular because it's unrated, and will no doubt be more bloody, have some great special features, and interesting commentary by Roth.  If you haven't seen Hostel and are a fan or horror, I highly reccommend this film.

Pros about the movie:

The acting was believable, and I liked each of the characters, whether I was for, or against them.  I really enjoyed the story, and everything was tied together in the end.  The tourture scenes were graphic and brutal, and the atmosphere was excellent.  I also really enjoyed the ending, which I won't give away here (let's just say revenge plays a key part).  The more I thought about this movie after seeing it, the more I liked it.  It sticks with you (or at least it did with me).

Cons about the movie:

It took a long time to get into the bloody action, and I thought it could have been slightly more gory for effect.  If the movie had focused more on the torture side of the tale verses the ""party"" side, it might have been better overall.  There were some unrealistic moments, which is to be expected, and of course, a lot of unnecessary nudity.  There was also an over-abundance of drug use, but it adds a little to the story, and besides, you get the feeling that's half the reason these boys left the good old USA anyway.

Overall, I really enjoyed this film and am definitely buying the DVD in April.  It's a bloody good time, and its original story is sure to gain it a permanent spot in classic horror cinema.",1140048000,6,1865,4.464497041420119
1556541,1,B00005JOQB,"Only by scratching my head and squinting my eyes can I remember sitting through ""Cabin Fever,"" which marked writer/director Eli Roth's film debut, and just barely can I remember the movie itself. I remember being entertained by it, but it just wasn't good enough. I decided to give Eli Roth a second chance if he ever made another film, and now he has, if you want to conisder ""Hostel"" a film. I'd like to think of it is a heartless, brutal melting pot of the different methods of grisly torture one could inflict on another human being. I am ashamed that I ever saw it.

Exactly what Quentin Tarantino, one of the greatest filmmakers of our time, saw in Eli Roth during his first runaround, much less his sophomore effort, is a mystery. But that's not the biggest mystery. Roth has quickly dropped from an exceptional filmmaker to Uwe Boll lousiness in only one film. God knows what his third film will be like. If it is anything resembling ""Hostel"" then you should save your ticket money and purchase it some time later when you stumble accross it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart.

Roth apparently fancies himself a horror film director. Well, I've got news for him. Scenes depicting bound victims having holes drilled in their flesh, their appendages torn off with chainsaws, and their eyes plucked out are not scary, but are instead the disturbing masterworks of a director who could use a little psychiatric care and a happy pill or two. And anyone who finds them entertaining should join the director in a group therapy session. I'm sure they are the same individuals who were mesmerized by last year's similar motion pictures (""The Devil's Rejects"" and ""Wolf Creek"").

I paused after finishing the previous paragraph and thought for a moment. Why are films whose central themes include torture, rape, and sadism being made? And who could possibly find them entertaining? I suppose knuckleheaded filmmakers are just all too eager to cash in on garbage to make other garbage films. Turning disgusting content into a profit is a greater crime than what happened with Enron. Films that are gratuitous in senseless violence, vulgar brutality, and nihilism should stay in the sick minds of the people who write them.

Let's just say I'm glad that Roth has chosen to direct these kinds of films, because the material skills in his head will never be able to muster Oscar material. Without waisting much more time discussing the film, I will say that it is almost unbearably violent, disturbing, dark, ugly, mean, and terrible. In his review of last year's ""Chaos,"" unseen by me, film critic Roger Ebert wrote ""Why do we need this s**t?"" quoting another film critic by the name of Ed Gonzalez. One can ask the same question about ""Hostel,"" and I can go even further and label it as a middle finger to the face of cinema. - Isaac

1556543,1,B00005JOQB,"Ugh!  Saw the film last night.  Soooooooooooo bad!

The acting.  The dumb story line.  The stupid bad sex acting.  Everything!  I am not quite sure what to make of the film.  Was it a low budget cheap porno showcasing cheap local easy girls?  Was it a comedy, making a parody of the horror genre?  Was it a parody of the action movie?  Or was it, as I suspect, a genuine attempt at being original yet subconsciously trying to emulate all the past films, creating in the process some horrid amalgam, which just proved a truly embarrassing brainchild?!

I also think that Roth has serious issues with sex and the opposite sex.  In his movies, all the sexually active women get killed off and die.  It was the formula in Cabin Fever and also in Hostel.  I think the guys' projeting his ambiguous, even ambivlent, sexual feelings and fears of women on the screen without him truly knowing it.

As a guy, I knid of like that the film shows that women can be evil too--because it is the truth.  And I like it when the bad guys (or women) get what's coming to them (and boy to they get it!).  But the take is too one sided I felt.  Films like the Devil's Reject also show women can be part of evil, but in both the Devil's Rejects and High Tension, there are also female heroines that fight back with the guys, showing that evil and good can exist in anyone--regardless of gender.

Roth, however, presents a sick twist, where men are essentially evil or just sexist animals and women just evil vile whores worthy of only mutilation.  Seriously, what did his mother do to him growing up?!

As for the torture scenes, it looked a bit silly to me, like they let people out of a bus filled of retarded inmates and let them have fun with power tools--that is basically the underlying drive of the graphic violent scenes.

I'll admit though, you do get into the film a bit and start to cheer the only survivor who gets back at these people running the death chambers.

Really, the movie was truly bad.  From the lighting to the acting.  Especially the female actors and the Icelander guy.  But guy who was torturing the poor last survivor was truly a creepy, ugly looking man.

As for the violence, I guess I am sick or something.  All the blood and gore didn't bother me.  The movie was tedius and long and as for the revenge scenes, what revenge?

The kid just shoots them or hacks them here and there.  Like man, wouldn'd you, especially with the girl, take your extra sweet time and not just cut off her legs and arms, but like a$$ f*ck her with the chainsaw and cut out her c*nt--after raping her a few times I mean?  Sure you would.

The girls too were kind of ugly honestly.  No real t*ts and the characters annoying.  I was just happy to see them get killed off but even 90 minutes the movie was too long because of how boring it was.

I really didn't like it overall and thought the story was just too dumb.  Like bodies were literally piling up and there all these people torturing people and stuff everywhere and no one seems to notice this all happening or that the people are missing.  ""Like hi mom and dad, I'll be at the Slovakian Hostel.""  Two days later... ""Hmm, we haven't heard back from Johnny...  Gee, I guess I'll just write him off and never wonder what happened.""

1556601,1,B00005JOQB,"Bret Fetzer is the Amazon reviewer for this film.  With the exception of implyiing that today's horror lacks both originality and no longer dealing with the more complex matters of the psyche, opting instead for a more simpler, formulaic torturing of ""the flesh,"" he gives a glowing review of the film.

How often have we picked up a newpaper or seen a TV ad giving a raving review for a movie, citing some guy's name who we've never heard of before, only to find out later that he was made-up by the marketing team behind the film or some real nobody who's nothing more than a struggling playwright or writer trying to make extra cash on the side.

Fetzer is no exception.  Haivng only a blog (right there that shoudl tell you something, for only vaid and the mentally/emotionally needy and challenged have a blog), Fetzer's bio reveals him to be a ""playwright"" re-writing old fairy tales like Beauty and the Beast and writing decidedly more ""adult"" themed plays whose central focuses are violence and sex.  I guess Fetzer would know then something about a lack of talent and having to fall upon matter of the flesh, the more simpler aspects of art production.

Bottom line is that quite literally Fetzer's paycheck depended on him writing a good review that would sell the product that Amazon's advertisers are selling and also have a good review on file for when the DVD comes out.  Which company will post a bad review for a future product and put off advertisers and companies at the same time?  Just think about it.

Fetzer is enslaved, but as for his actual liking the movie is open to debate.  It could be that he is enslaved to give the movie a more positive review than is merited and that he still likes the film; there is after all no accounting for bad taste.

And bad taste it is to think this movie is anything by terrible.  Not for the blood and scenes of extreme violence.  Not even for the scene of where a person takes a chainsaw to a person and literally cuts them apart.  It is for the nihilistic apathy of how humans are portrayed and the complete lack of respect for the intelligence and sensibility of the audience member.  There is no more art here than, say, smearing fecal matter on a canvas is art.  Only a genuine moron would think otherwise.

Fetzer says there is some poltiical ""subtext"" becuase the ""sardonic joke"" is that sadists are willing to pay more money to torture Americans because everyone hates them.

Apparently, he didn't watch the movie very well.  Actually, it is Asian females that command the highest price in the film, Americans coming in next, but regardless of the race or nationality, females withint comparable race and national category being of higher value.  What ""subtext"" is there in that?: That perhaps society places higher value on women and it is so more taboo to dismember a woman and so richly more decadent an act and thus more valuable a commodity?

One could think of so many ""clever"" reasons, but there is not insightful political message, overt or hidden here.  Despite Fetzer comparing this film to others like the Devil's Rejects, calling them a display of ""brainless sadism"" compared to Hostel, Hostel is truly a aimless, pointless film, and moreover to borrow Fetzer's own description: Hostel is truly brainless as well.

Eli Roth has confused an attempt to shock for talent, and is sadly mistaken in thinking the former could ever be a substitute for the later--no matter how much blood or how many severed limbs are thrown at the audience.

There is not even one scene in the entire movie that resonates with you, in which you feel even an iota of compassion or concern for anyone.  The characters are so one-dimensional and unlikable and truly uninteresting.  There is no interest to know why these sadists are the way they are, what makes them proverbially ""tick,"" or how they got there.  We sense no undercurrent of a past somehow subtly at play in their lives.  The villains, ironically, are the most boring of all characters in the film!  That is truly a first for the ""horro"" genre, perhaps the only really original thing that Roth can make claim.

Yet Hostel is not even an horror film; it is genuinely nonsensical with a thinly told, barely contained narrative that is peppered with a host of unbelievable plot flaws, from how what effectively is a death industy can stay in operation without attract unwanted attention despite there being seemingly hundrends of people disappearing in the town each year to how unrealistic it is that every last victim was never missed.

As for character and plot development, there is none, and there is barely passable acting ""talent,"" if you can call it ""talent.""  The dialgue is so lame and cheezy that you truly have to wonder if Roth might have written the screen play while under the influence of marajuana and thought at the time it was the most greates thing second to trying to ignite his fart with a lighter.

So dear reader, if you are a genuine horror fan, they you will not find it in this movie.  This film has all the sophistication of the sophomoric nuance of a second year film student.  Only the easily amused would find any ""greatness"" in it, in which that ""greatness"" is inversely related to their intelligence quotient.",1138665600,4,5258,4.684439608269859
1556602,1,B00005JOQB,"I thought it was just me.  After seeing all these negative reviews I feel a bit better now.  It really was a sucky ass job by Eli Roth.  I personally didn't like his other movie too, Cabin Fever.  Like Hostel it was sucky and I thought racist at times.  In Hostel, the movie has some racists undertones, especially with an Asian female being tortured.  It is definitely anti-foreignors and really shows Europeans in a very poor, dim light.  What gives with that?  Also the women are shown as nasty hoes and femme fetales and together wtih the Asian woman scene the movie has both sexist and misogynistc tones as well.

As a slasher movie (if you are into that) then I guess it is ""ok,"" but you have to wait something like two-thirds of the first hour and about half the movie to get to it.  First you are shown lots of dumb, boring acting and really bad acted sex scenes.

I really did buy into all the hype and was disappointed at how it turned out.  There really isn't anything new or fresh here.  Even the theme has been done in great part in House of Wax or the unsuspecting travelers coming across the wackos off the beaten track.  It's like a total rip off from lots of other movies and not put together very well either.

Given all the negative responses here, I can see that I was not the only one that bought the hype and didn't like the movie for its lies, cheap filming, and lack of story and unbelievable scenarios.

Go see another moive.  I did like Wolf Creek, which is still playing right now.  Saw II was very good and had a good, developed story to it, although it is on its way out of the theaters now.

I will spare the readers here the already mentioned reasons but fuffice to say that this movie was not in the horro genre but some really bad cut and paste job from a theme here and a variation there from other movies from the past and done with no real seamless connection.  Some of the scenes were truly horrible in terms of the acting and dialogue and cheesy sex scenes.  As for the ""horror,"" showing how a chainsaw works on a human body really isn't a horror scene but just a bit gross.  And it's been done already so many times and cannot emulate the classic Chainsaw Massacre, which first introduced the genre.

Instead the director relies on lots of adolescent, mechanistic cheap sex featuring a pair of cheap, trashy looking girls that look like the are moonlighting in acting in the movie and actually portraying their primary job in the process--and then tons of blood with every cliche horror trick from hiding among dead bodies to someone's back of their feet cut.  Seen it; it's been done; now let's move on...  Next...

Some stupid, prissy American guy is whining about how ""it has to be a real rush,"" refering to his want to really do all the nasty little things he wants to do to a poor Asian woman whom we know nothing about in the movie and whom he cuts her eye out of her face.  Why?  Just for kicks.

After about 30 minutes or so of this and some new guys coming in with masks (remember Dr. Giggles or Jason ?!  Hello !!!).  Seen it; been done; let's move on...  Next...

Then the final scene...  I had to make sure I was still in the right theater, as I almost fell asleep at one point and thought they were featuring a coming attaction of some new super hero movie.  Basically the most unlikable guy in the movie escapes, kills his tormentor and then goes on a merciless rampage and offs all the people that were part of this ring.  It's just a total rip off of High Tension and the Devil's Rejects in theme, which surely influenced Eli Roth.  Both those movies had plot and character developement.

Honestly, this ""film"" looked like some wannabe film director's final project in a film course.  Just awlful for the big screen!!!

Not even worthy of the status of being a ""B-movie.""

I wanted to go on a rampage myself, it was so bad!

And if you think the stupid sluts are worth it, think again.  They really really really need acting lessons.  People are saying they look hot and sexy.  They look like total diseased Euro-sleaze-street-trash.  Who'd every thought a movie's sex scene would have been boring, but I swear it was so lamely filmed it was just bad!  Bad!  Bad! Bad!

1556607,1,B00005JOQB,"With the annoying choir music playing in the background as limbs are hacked and blood squirts all over the place, this movie seemed more like a comedy to me than an honest-to-goodness horror thriller.  Roth completely lacks the talent of building suspense and developing a story thread for character buildup.  Unlike other horror movies, we have no real sense of connection for the victims or really feel like we are with them in the story.  Compare the master of suspense and horror, Stephen King, which someone pointed out on here already.  King first builds the characters up and we get to know them and care for them, and then the monsters come out.  Instead of character development and plot we are given what is really an HBO style porn movie featuring two pale looking Eastern European women that look like they could be in a Valtrex commercial.  After that the movie then turns in a slasher flick, where there is just one dumb mask wearing goofball after the other slicing and dicing people up.  The end of the movie then features the last survivor who goes Terminator on the bad dudes asses.  I mean come one!  This had to be a sick version of a comedy, right?  But maybe it is just me, for I remember laughing my butt off when I read Romeo and Juliet thinking it was a comical commentary on high-brow social distinctions instead of beng a genuine tragedy.  Whatever.  This movie though was just plain dumbass lame man.  I think Roth needs to get his butt back into film school or start studying the classics and read up on the masters of the genre he believes he is contributing to here.

Save your bucks and go see Wolf Creek.  Much better acting and a lot scarier and entertaining.  Don't get sucked into the hype of this dumb movie.

Nuff said!",1138579200,8,1757,4.544585987261146
1556678,1,B00005JOQB,"Just got through watching the film.  To put it mildly, it sucked.  The acting was horrible, althought some of the blood-gore effects were OK.  But this wasn't really a horror movie as advertised.  It was a soft-core porn film for at least half the first part of the movie almost and then just suddenly shifted into a totally dumb series of torture for money scenario.  ?What is more it then shifts again into another genre: action.  The last would-be victim suddenly goes into Rambo-mode and starts taking out the villains wholesale.  So what is it?  Well, it is part porno, part slasher-gore, and part action movie.  But it really isn't horror.

And this is the most stupid part of the movie.  Supposedly this is based on a real incident.  You know what that ""real incident"" was?  Apparently Roth got the idea for Hostel when he was supposedly surfing the net for what he admits was sick stuff.  On the Jimmy Kimmel Live Show, Roth has he found a website in Tailand which was advertising the service of anyone coming down to then walk into a room where a person would be tied to a chair to be shot in the head.  Supposedly the website said the person was a willing participant.

Perhaps this is true.  Who knows.  I cannot find any such website on the net though.  Perhaps, if we are willing to believe this, this was started by a group of HIV infected people, in which AIDS is rampant in Tailand.  Perhaps this is a way for effectively a doom person to collect some money to go to their family.  But this is total speculation and again entertaining the idea that this supposedly ""real incident"" is, well, real.

At any rate, the way this allegedly ""real incident"" is then shown in the movie Hostel is totally inconsistent with how Roth accounts the ""real incident.""  In the movie, people are just kidnapped and tortured and clearly not willing participants.

I agree with some other reviewers on here that there is some attempt, or so it seems, to make some political commentary.  But it is so undefined and froth with other inconsistencies already pointed out by other reviewers, such as the fact that there is a rather sadistic American who is also torturing foreignors, particularly wiht a penchant for severing the eye of an Asian woman.

And the realism of the film was, well, unrealistic.  Like tons of people are being killed, where literally piles of bodies are layered on carts and no one seems the wiser of this all going on.  Give me a break.

The acting was really bad, particularly by the two female ""actresses"" who were nothing but cheap eye candy.  The bad acting really showed and was genuinely laughable at times.  Even the mafia-like boss, or we are lead to believe it is the boss, of this ""industry"" is so stereotypical: black cloths, bold head, automatic in hand and cheezy one-syllable accented interogatives and commands like ""Zamerican?"" and ""Talkz!""

I just feel so bad for poor Slovania, which is shown in a rather poor light, as a deteriorating city in which demonic little homicidal kids run rampant literally killing people for candy.  Just retarded, even though it might elicit a chuckle or two.

As for the ending, yeah people are rooting at the end, but it is to see the bad guys get it, much like in High Tension were the tables are viciously turned on the bad guys again.

Anyway Roth is a dumb writer and director.  There isn't any decent dialgue or plot in the movie, no real acting, and the scenarios so unrealistic that you cannot help but notice just how dumb it all is.  Seriosuly man, it is almost painful to watch how bad this film is.  And seeing the small to medium size breasts of silly-acting tarts prancing about doesn't make up for it either.",1138492800,4,3691,4.595712098009188
1556679,5,B00005JOQB,"For everyone who didn't like this movie: There is an endless supply of serial killer themed , rehash horror sequels with trendy twenty-something stars just oozing out of Hollywood every other weekend. They are destined to end up covered in dust at your local Blockbuster's bargain bin waiting for your consumption. You can go pick them up after church or whatever ""feel good"" activities you do to cleanse yourself of your personal issues.  You can ignore this movie and remain like the other 70% of Americans who never applied for a passport.

Hostel is a very timely reverse exploitation film.  I honestly have not seen an American horror movie this good since the 80s. As if most American men didn't realize 50% of the porn they consume comes from some Eastern European country willing to exploit their youth for anyone willing to pay. Do you really think the underground sex market in most underprivileged countries caters to locals?  Also, this movie is tame compared to most things Americans condone as foreign policy (Hostel gives nod to America's acceptance to their own secret ""interrogation"" prisons).

For anyone who has traveled and bumped into those annoying American tourists behaving like they never would behave in the states, this is some vindication. Yes, I feel it could have even been gorier. However, what is here was sufficient to make my wife run to the bathroom and puke so be warned. People actually were applauding when it ended (as in they liked it).

Wow, Frank Simmons was really bothered by this movie and my praise of it. If Hostel wasn't effective, would he have bothered to write such a long winded and obvious rebuke?  I stick by everything I said.  I don't feel a need to go into specifics, shed light on all of his double standards or point out how many times he misquoted what I actually wrote.  Sometimes movies don't need to literally cite a relevant situation to make one consider an analogy.  This kind of allusion is common in art, literature and music, not that this movie is in the same category.  Don't act so reactionary Frank. You can like this movie and still feel proud to be an American.  I would try to be more open minded to the mechanisms used in these kinds of narratives.  Sometimes an open-ended interpretation is sufficient (I usually do not expect much from ""soft-porn category and the blood-gore category"" movies).  Also, I believe the ""Twist"" is a cheap and overdone narrative device used to provide a culmination without addressing the more ambiguous and usually more interesting aspects in horror movies (High-Tension & Saw).

By the way Frank, if you are going to use big intelligent words while calling me dumb and dim-witted, at the very least use the correct spelling (opprobrium, not opprobium).  Now if you change it everyone will know.",1138492800,,2803,4.844863731656185
1556680,1,B00005JOQB,"This is just a shameful movie.  The whole idea that people would enjoy this movie sickens me.  That is what I find genuinely gross about this movie.

No, I didn't waste a single dime on this movie, but I did get the chance to spy a bit of it while waiting for Munich.  I saw enough of it to get the whole premise.  Once more, and what I loved about this, is when our audience came out of the Munich, the audience members of Hostel from another showing were coming out.  They all looked like a bit of their spirit was sucked out of them.

Munich was a violent movie in its own right, but the violence served a purpose in speaking of the inhumanity that can arise out of what might first seem a morally acceptable thing: revenging murder.  We quickly see that violence knows no limit and grows in its demand for mayhem and soon what might have begun with a more morally sound foundation crumbles beneath an ever strengthening wave of blood-thisty want for spilling more blood.

In Hostel, in contrast, the violence tells no tale of darkness.  Instead, the darkness is just glorified, and like the golden calf, whorishly worshipped for all to see and take part in adoring.  In a very real sense, the moive itself, if you think about it, is the Hostel portrayed in the movie.  Here, the lure of sex on the screen, lures a young sexually charged audeince, primarily young males, who then have their minds warped for some 90 minutes.  I saw their faces, and they were f*cked to put it delicately.  They just didn't realize it.  I am sure that in the future, neuroscientists will demonstrate without a shadow of doubt that movies and experiences like this actually physically rewire the brain.  I am far from an ""old fuddy duddy"" but I am more and more believing the case of rising violence and desentisation to it is due to violent realistic movies and video games.

If Eli Roth wanted to really show the inhumanity of the world, why not a documentary on say the human organ black market, where the poor are taken horrific advantage of daily, paid a low sum of money for their kidney or how we Westerners are more interested in paying over 10 dollars to see a  pointless movie like this that celebrates murder and cruelty instead of donating $5 to countries in Africa, in which $5 would help eliminate malaria, which claims millions of lives each year.

Something is terribly wrong with the world when a movie is not uplifting the spirit but designed to take part of it away and foster a sense that life is cheap and unworthy of fundamental respect and is not inherently precious.  That to me is the sickest part of the whole premise behind this movie.",1138320000,27,2646,4.49581589958159
1556681,1,B00005JOQB,"The reviewer Rene is right, this is a ""garbage movie.""  I think that the startling divide between those that liked this movie and those that didn't is largely due to age.  I think that indeed those in their early 20's and younger like this kind of movie, largely because of the sex and the gross-factor, which does appeal to the adolescent male mind especially in testing how strong a stomach they have.  In fact, in the commercials that had inundated the air ways, the movie was being introduced as a dare to see it, implying you are weak if you can't handle it.  This plays to a juvenile frail sense of masculinity and need to prove their toughness.  Just look at the review below going by the name ""B. Perdue"" (AKA ""blendered fetus"").  He (and it is obvious he's a guy) claims people are ""whinin"" (there's a letter g at the end of ""whinin"" genius), yet ""Blendedered fetus"" (did the moron mean ""Blended"" and just blunder yet again in basic spelling?)bought into the I-dare-you ploy in having to go see it and now thinking after seeing it it was a great movie because of some misguided sense of accomplishment and validation of male toughness.

In fact if you click on ""Blendered fetus"" and see the other movie he reviewed and thought so great, you will find ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" as his other ""great movie.""

""Pirates of the Caribbean!!!!""

What is this guy like 14?

Yet another reviewer identifying himself as ""A kid's review"" first starts out by saying: ""Many 1-star reviewers seem to think there is something wrong with enjoying a film like this.""  He goes on to say why it is OK to enjoy scenes of torutre and that one is ""normal"" to do so, yet his very last sentence is ""So the next time you think about putting down a torture film, get a life. Realize it's the truth and is not just there for people's pleasure...""  Hmm...  Someone needs to take a logic and rhetoric lesson, for he concluded with the exact opposite of his opening thesis.

At any rate, seeing someone's eye popped out and then sliced off or what a chain saw can due might be gross but honestly it's far more silly a notion in terms of serving any entertaining, interesting role for me (I'm 28 now).  Perhaps once when pimples were still making their debut on my face and thoughts of naked girls prancing about filled my waking hour, along with someone farting oddly being the most hysterical thing on the planet, this movie would have been thought of as a ""great movie"" too.  For the laid-less losers of geek-vile, I can see how this movie would be right up their alley.  But for the rest of us with any adult sophistication, this isn't entertainment.  Moreover a lack of appreciating it, far from being a sign of ""mental weakness"" (as the boy wonder below sees it), is a testament to more sophisticated, mature appreciation.

This movie wasn't scary or even gross to me but just plain lame and silly.  Calling it ""garbage"" is being rather kind actually.

Lastly, I want to address a point that ""A kid's review"" and others like him think they've made when he says that ""Things that happen all over the world like this all the time. That's the point of this movie; to show people this.""  Gee, this kid would definitely think that Oliver Stone's take on JFK is an historically accurate portrayal of real events.  Nice try there son, but don't confuse comic gore fantasies transcribed to the movie screen as taken out of the news.  The supposed reason for the film was not to educate you, you gerbil-brain mental midget, but rather the reason was to make lots of money in a short period of time from pimple-faced laid-less geek losers like you by luring them with naked girls that you can only fantasize about and nothing more.  Sorry there Leroy, but that is the truth.  You got taken sucker.  Now go pop your zits and stay in school.  If you ever want to get laid in your life, stay in school and hit the books.

1556682,1,B00005JOQB,"The reviewer that claims ""she"" is female is most likely an adolescent male, but whatever the gender, the review reveals a definite adolescent mentality.  I know one female that enjoyed this movie and thought it quite disturbing.  The fact that you have subhuman pieces of trash that literally are deriving an erotic thrill out of this movie speaks volumes of the moral decay and corruption of values in our society.  I seriously hope that Eli Roth meets with a violent, tragic end, as that fate is the only thing he is worthy of achieving in his pathetic, poor excuse of a life.

From a less visceral and more analytic criticism of the movie, the fact that it was number one in the opening week of the first of the year was due to heavy commerical advertising and the fact that it was essentially the only new release, coming on the heels of movies that were in theatres for several weeks, such as Munich, Narnia, and King Kong.  The fact that it quickly shunk after that first week shows that word of mouth anulled the heavy hype and it's ""success"" was due to only a lack of choice by bored holiday movie goers having most likely seen the other major hits of the previous year.

The movie lacked any depth or story plot other than a very course grain think veiled attempt at narration, which proved more excuse for simplistic gratuitous puerile mindless sex scenes, spanning nearly 40 mintues of the first part of the moive, followed suddenly by a dramatic shift of scenes of torture and murder with an emphasis on extreme gore and excessive blood sheeding.

The movie's sole goal is to disgust audience members via scene of a gagged man vomiting while being cut with a chain saw' a woman having her toes chopped off, one by one; another scene where a woman's face is scorched with a blow torch; another scene were a woman's eye is dislodged from her socket, shown hanging down, over her face, and then sliced off, close-ups of it gushing all over her.  This is Eli Roth's retarded notion of ""creativity"" and ""entertainment,"" where once again the only minds that could derive any sense of enjoyment are those with all the asethetic sensibilities of one that finds horse manure of deep, artistic significance, worthy to be praised and giving great visual pleasure to view.

For the rest of us with an IQ above 80 and no longer cracking a goofy smile when the word ""annulus,"" say, is mentioned this movie was just awlful and painful to sit through.  Indeed, the only thing more grotesque than the gore on the silver screen was the lack of acting and story telling and the horrific, embarrassing attempt by Mr. Roth to try to do justice to both those considerations.

If cheap sex scenes by artificial looking women and blood get you off, go rent a cheap porno flick and watch a cable documentary on slaughter houses.  It would most likely be a much more entertaining evening.

Eli Roth, however, only reveals his warped view of women, sex, and his projected, fixated fears of sex and death and a most sad adolescent state of arrested mental development.  Truly, he is destined to be a third rate hack, following on the heels of a Tarantino, where Eli Roth's ""greatest accomplishment"" will be this embarrassment of a stupid film.",1138320000,,3227,4.63859649122807

Cabin Fever was one of the worse ""horror"" movies ever made.  It lack a story, character development, and had no plot.  The premise was completely preposterous, namely a flesh eating bacteria suddenly breaks out among a group of poor city slicker visiting the back woods of white-trash redneck-ville.  The stereotypes were trite and plastic, even genuinely racists to both whites and blacks.  Thus is the limitation of Eli Roth's talent for both writing and directing.

In Hostel, he does no better, only now substituting more blood and gore in a pathetic attempt to compensate for his blaring deficiencies as a writer and director of cinema.  Yet Roth seems to genuinely believe he has achieved something of greatness in showing, for instance, a woman strapped to a chair having her toes chopped off with a larger lock cutter.  This, we are to believe, is the height of
artistic talent and creativity.  Indeed, only the most scatologicial and undeveloped, vacant loser minds would find such poor garbage as this amusing.

The only thing that proves genuinely grotesque about this movie is Roth's appalling lack of imagination and most undeserved sense of accomplishment and unjustified pride in believing he has any talent other than to amuse adolescent, puerile teenage minds.

This movie was not horror nor horrifying an experience.  Compared to movies like Seven, which despite having little or no blood in it was far more frigthening and distrubing than Hostel for cleverly eliciting the viewer's sense of dread and own imagination to fill in the suggestive details, Hostel just inundates you with a barage of senseless, frenetic images that soon become formulaic and tedious.

Moreover, unlike Seven, which presented a very real scenario that didn't insult the intelligence of viewers and had skillful,  competent actors who actually acted, Hostel is premised on a very preposterous premise of a large underground torture and murder industry in which despite a large clientele of murders and ever amassng murder victims, no one is the wiser outside of the town in which these crimes take place and where everyone in the town just about is involved in the scheme--all the while presented by so-called ""actors"" who cannot act to quite literally save their own lives.  Even the supposedly ""steamy sex scenes"" (to borrow from the trite description so often said of the sex scenes), the acting is stiff (pardon the pun) and plastic.

You have no concern for the characters, except for perhaps one, an Icelander who is arguably the most sympathetic.  The movie then truly proves as a puerile excuse for genuinbely gratuitous lame and rather unerotic sex and female nudity and blood and gore.  You'd have a far better time renting a porno, then, and watching an Ultimate Fight match than seeing Hostel if that is watching cheap looking women acting like whorish fools and seeing blood blow is your sense of entertainment.

1556747,2,B00005JOQB,"From the look of the ads on tv I was excited about seeing Hostel. But I have learned that advertisers are very crafty and deceptive people. I didn't realize that half the movie was going to be cheap boob shots and by the time the horror started I was already sick of the uninteresting characters and didn't really care what was going to happen to them. It was all a big tease. Scenes that were supposed to be disturbing were not because they never actually showed anything happening. On a few occasions, yes there was some gore but nothing to write home about. If they had focused more on the human hunting aspect and less on the nude scenes they would of had a better story to tell. It was more annoying than anything else. The first 40 minutes you are waiting for the fun to begin and finally when it happens it's quite anticlimactic. The characters sucked and the story was weak and on top of that it seemed very short. Perhaps an unrated version would be better. Who knows. It just stinks when a movie has the potential to be good but totally lets you down.",1137974400,4,1061,4.363636363636363
1556748,4,B00005JOQB,"Even if the previews for this movie looked terrible and even if the movie didn't have tons of hype backing it up (stories of people getting sick and passing out in theaters) and even if it didn't have Quentin Tarantino's name plastered all over it, I still would have seen ""Hostel."" Why? Writer/director, Eli Roth, won me over with his first flick, ""Cabin Fever,"" which definitely had a style all it's own and I've been dying to see what he would come up with next. Afterall, the guy's got just as sick of taste in horror as he does in humor. Needless to say, if you go into ""Hostel"" knowing what kind of movie you are seeing, you really won't be disappointed.

The previews make this movie look like an extremely graphic, intense flick where people are being tortured for 90 minutes. I'll admit, I bought into it and sat down in the theater prepared to have my usually strong stomach put to the test. However, this isn't that flick. Just like ""Cabin Fever"" was misrepresented and therefore, misunderstood back in 2003, due to a poor advertising campaign, so is ""Hostel."" Judging by most negative reviews, it seems people went into it under the inlfuence of the ads, which seem to promise a bloodfest. Not to say this movie is wimpy, as it has it's share of gore, but it's not as brutal and unrelenting as it looked like. Eli Roth brings his own flavor once again to this movie, and just like Cabin Fever, it's one of those movies that you never quite know what to expect. Injected throughout are sprinkles of Roth's signature sense of humor, but unlike ""Cabin Fever,"" the movie doesn't end in one big punchline involving rifles. The cast, led by the superb Jay Hernandez (who makes his role as human and realistic as possible) is perfect for this movie, and the European setting alone is intriguing enough to sit through this movie for, if not for the bounty of bare breasts (this movie must hold the record).

So, when you consider the wasteland that is Winter movies (""Big Momma's  House 2,"" anyone?), ""Hostel"" is the oasis in it all. Here you will find a movie that is interesting, original, makes you think, and entertains all your senses at once. As Roth's second film, it's a winner. Obviously it has it's flaws, but such can be forgiven. As by the time you walk out the theater, you will be wondering what you would do in this situation, or if things like this really go on in the world. You've been warned: Don't go in expecting carnage. It's just a unique, slightly bent horror flick, the kind that only Eli Roth could deliver.",1137974400,3,2537,4.547045951859956

1556750,4,B00005JOQB,"**warning, plot details**

Well I finally got to see this film and was pleased.  The film has a great premise.  The story is about these three young men who are traveling through Europe, two of them with one thing in mind, getting some p***y.  Well they got it and more than they asked for.  They are directed to this Hostel in a small town by this strange character who tells them they can get all the girls they want at this Hostel.  Well he wasn't lying about that part.  However he didn't tell them about the fact that they are actually capturing people for this torture game for people with some extra money shall we say.  People pay to go to this facility where they can torture and ultimately kill these people that have been captured.  They even have a price list for different people, Americans bringing the highest amount at $25,000.  I won't tell anymore about the plot.

The acting was pretty good.  The blood and gore was really over the top.  Although I have to say near the beginning when they show someone with a tool that looks somewhat like giant wire cutters approach this girl tied up in a chair.  Well they show the cutters positioned and then cut away and don't show the actual cut.  My first thought was if this movie is supposed to be so gruesome why wouldn't they show that.  Well they show more gruesome scenes later which still makes me wonder why they cut away on that shot.  Well anyway it did turn out gruesome and bloody.  It did however take about 40 minutes to get to the torture scenes and start getting exciting.  It does turn out to be fairly intense.

I know because the look of the films are similar that everyone is inclined to compare this to the SAW movies.  They are not really alike after all, but I would give the edge to SAW for one reason.  SAW was more suspenseful and more intense.  That said though I did enjoy Hostel and it will be in my collection of DVD's when it comes out.

If you liked movies like SAW, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc, I think you'll like this one too.",1137801600,4,2021,4.35656836461126
1556751,1,B00005JOQB,"""What if the blood, flesh, and screams were yours?"" asks the movie poster.  If the sight of blood makes you queasy; if intense scenes of pain and torture make you ill; if the thought of being turned into hamburger meat makes you want to run and faint, so the anonymous, practiced voice on the commercial advises, go see another movie.  With all the juvenile tact of I-dare-you-to, the movie challenges you to see what is in essence a mainstream faux snuff flick.

But is it scary?

After nearly 40 minutes of two women playing every dumb slut stereotype and prancing naked, the blood works begin.  Everyone watching the film knows that the sluts are just soulless bait-everyone  but the horny poor back travelers that soon meet up with some rather pathetic even more soulless types that get their kicks in torturing people.

There is no suspense in the movie.  There is no lead up or character build-up.  The most sympathetic character is killed off just after the first 40 minutes and new characters who we know almost nothing about come into the movie.  Compared to the suspense master, Stephen King, the writer and director of Hostel, Eli Roth, lacks the skills necessary to have turned this movie into something other than how a meat grinder works.

Scary has an element of the unknown, in which suspense builds-up more and more until you cannot take it any more, sensing that impending doom.  Concurrent with this in a horror movie is to have your audience care for the characters and sympathize with them.  The movie fails to do this.  The movie is not scary-but it is ""gruesome"" to most.

As a former EMS worker, I have seen a man with half his arm off, bone marrow literally oozing out; a woman who fell into her window while standing on a ladder, cutting off with surgical precision half her lower face that flapped to the side as if she was wearing a Halloween mask.  I have sceen what a 12-guage shotgun does to the head of a man that quite literally blew the top of his head off; a woman who was eviscerated in an alley way; and various assortments of other ""gruesome"" acts.  No, the sight of blood does not make me ill.  And no, this movie was not scary to me.

What it was, however, was quite frankly unrealistic and evening boring at many times-and somewhat angering.  The premise is that there is this seemingly idyllic town whose main source of income is running an underground torture industry out of an abandoned manufacturing plant.  Sadists from around the world come and pay various prices for people to torture.  Local men are the lowest price; local women a bit higher; various prices for other Europeans; Americans topping at a higher price; but Asian women the most expensive: $50,000.

In one scene were a poor Asian woman is horrifically tortured, including her eye slowly removed, you begin to wonder just how exactly would this ""industry"" work?  Despite Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth claiming on the late night circuit that they ""thought of how"" and presented a realistic portrayal of that economic mechanics, they do not.  How, for instance, does one advertise such a service without attracting authorities or knowing how to target your sadistic audience?  And even if there are ""people"" out there that would want to do this, they too would wonder who would be running this kind of service to trust.  Is it an entrapment-by either authorities or maybe even sicker minds or those that want to eliminate such evil?  And the runners of this ""business"" just take people to be killed, treating them as if truly disposable and no one would care or eventually come to the town.  Despite all this, numerous clients and endless bodies amass-and the business thrives.  No, this is not a realistic film.

And what of the clients?  What makes them ""tick"" and drives them?  Why do they want to do this?  Is it out of past trauma, some unresolved anger or pain, insanity, or just boredom and apathy for the human race?  The movie never addresses these obvious questions.

Putting yourself in the mind of one of these clients, wouldn't you still be worried of being prayed on yourself, discovered and retaliated upon by say the love ones who you tortured and killed?  Perhaps the people who you just paid $50,000 to pluck the eye out of the Asian woman, will then grab you, gag your dumb ass, and bound you to a chair for the next client.  Or perhaps that woman was the daughter of someone quite important or even more nuttier than you, took a chain saw to one of the ""business people"" and came eventually to your door, where one day you arrive home to find your family gagged and bound and get to see first hand a more imaginative use of a Black and Decker drill that your imagination was too limited to envision.  No, somehow I doubt this would be the volume or lucrative business that Eli Roth portrays.

And what of the bait gals?  Are they dumb or what?!  They are working for people who are killing off the locals as well, and moreover these girls are pretty and sexy, the very type that some of the sadistic clients are seeking.  Yeah, you won't kill the lure so long as they are making the fish bite, but once crow's feet comes creeping in, then what?  Maybe one day the main mafia-like thug running the buisness fiugres he's made enough and now needs to clean house and move on and not too interested in sharing the real profits and fiugres he'll make a little more in departing and clean house at the same time.  Oh yeah, this movie makes total sense.

The blood and ""gore"" may distract you, but the truth is that despite so many saying was a great ""horror"" flick this is, it really sucks.  It lacks imagination and proves far more tedious than being a convincing real, honest-to-goodness ""horror"" flick.

Sorry Eli, strike two baby.  Cabin Fever bombed, and this one is not destined to be a classic.  Spew all the blood you want, but it does little to compensate for a lack of real talent peaches.  Indeed, after seeing this movie, you might want to take a chain saw to Eli Roth for having so inundated you with all the hype in the movie trailers and then letting you down at the end.",1137715200,20,6112,4.576816927322907
1556752,3,B00005JOQB,"Wearing the chevron of Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth has created one of the first gore-filled horror films to hit mainstream theatres in recent memory. HOSTEL, the latest film from the writer/director of CABIN FEVER (2002), has an advertising campaign that makes it come across as a filmed abattoir on steroids.

For those who have asked, I've summarized HOSTEL as follows:

1) Take the most gore-filled, pain-filled, dismemberment-filled scene you can remember that makes you flinch just by thinking about it. (I, for instance, use that 5 minute scene from the end of the disappointing AUDITION (1995).) Now, repeat that for about 40 minutes.

2) Now take an hour of AMERICAN PIE (1999) and drop it in the front. In hindsight, I probably should have told everyone to take EUROTRIP (2004) instead.

HOSTEL was an intensely gory film, which was poorly written, very very poorly acted, and ultimately only moderately executed.

In fairness, the premise was actually superb. I don't want to give too much away, but the premise was reasonably believable, and while not an entirely novel concept, it was given a fresh spin.

However, the story was structured in the worst possible way. The first hour was nothing more than pointless nudity (and I don't even mean entertaining, I just mean utterly boring) and cheap humor. Sitting through the first half was tedious and had us wondering, ""are we in the right film? THIS is the great horror film that's been hyped?""

The film then takes a drastic right turn and delves headfirst into gore. Explicit gore. And lots of it. For about 40 minutes.

I can only assume that when writing the film, Roth tried to go for maximum contrast: really funny and lighthearted, and then, WHAM, what the Hell is happening?!

The failure lies in both the pacing of the first half (insufferably long, light on suspense, total lack of atmostphere), and the horribly written characters. In many horror films, the ""protagonists"" are annoying, and you're just waiting for the Big Bad to kill them. Here, they're so annoying, that you just get bored waiting for it to happen.

The gore, however, is delightfully extreme, if you're into that sort of thing. Lots of puncturing, slicing, laceration, dismemberment. Good times, for those who enjoy. But that make it a good horror film? No. No, it doesn't.

A good gore scene will make the average person wince. 20 gore scenes in succession just kind of dulls the senses. If not used tastefully (see SAW 2 (2005)), gore for gore's sake just becomes another load of special effects.

On the bright side, the gore miraculously managed to escape an NC-17 for reasons that I'll never understand. With the more liberal R rating, and a limited release, HOSTEL will likely be considered a commercial success. This is good, for two reasons:

1) Maybe HOSTEL 2 will be to HOSTEL what SAW 2 was to SAW: a dramatic improvement in writing and ambience that greatly enhances the rewatching of the original.

2) A commercial success for HOSTEL could conceivably drive the industry away from these atrocious PG-13 teeny slasher flicks, and back towards some more serious, disturbing, dark material. Look: I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and quite frankly I likely never will.

Do I recommend HOSTEL? Not really. If gore really does it for you, have at it. Otherwise, just watch AMERICAN PIE and the first 20 minutes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998).",1137715200,3,3397,4.883478260869565
1556753,3,B00005JOQB,"""Hostel"" is the story of two young American guys backpacking through Europe on a summer adventure. They, along with an Icelandic friend, decide to head to Bratislava, Slovakia after being told it was a great place to find hot girls and wild sex. They meet up with two young women, a Russian and a Czech, and then proceed to do the obvious - party and have sex. But the next day their friend from Iceland turns up missing and then their drinks are spiked by the girls. From there the movie changes gears from sexy, youthful adventure to brutal tortue and murder, apparently masterminded by a creepy European guy they had previously met on the train. The movie differs from many of the classic horror films in that the killers don't have a seemingly supernatural ability to escape death like Jason or Michael Myers. But rather they are ""normal"" human beings with a twisted, sadistic desire to seek their thrills by torture and murder.

Those expecting something with serious artistic intention because of Quentin Tarantino's name being attached to it will probably be disppointed. Eli Roth is actually the director and writer of this film and his intention seems basically to scare the hell out of you. Does he succeed? Well, for me, not so much. The torture scenes are quite gruesome. But the movie relys mainly on blood and guts gore rather than suspense. Personally, I never really felt scared. The movie also employs a plot device very similar to ""Friday the 13th"" and tons of other films in the horror genre - the victims are lured into dangerous circumstances by first succumbing to sexual temptation. This movie differs from many, however, in that not only does the main character manage to escape. But he also proceeds to inflict some very brutal revenge on his tormenters. This ""eye for eye"" series of actions makes up the movie's finale. I must say that I found the insistence of the ""good guy"" to exact revenge a disturbing way to end the film. But this is a horror movie, after all, and you probably shouldn't come if you don't want to leave feeling disturbed.",1137369600,6,2070,4.718232044198895

They find them selves in some abonded factory only to live out there worst nightmare. There a lot of T&A in the begining I feel so that when all the torture and gore hit you have a happy place to go to. It has a pretty simple story line but it works for this film.

A good friend of mine (who is into the same type of films) saw it a few days before me and she claimed she actually had to turn away from the screen at times. When she told me that, I was foaming at the mouth to get to this one.

Without giving away any details I will say that I did feel there could've been a little more brutality but for a ""mainstream"" it was nearly over the top. I honestly can't believe that this movie only got an ""R"" rating. I may be too desensitized to violence in films from all the gore I've seen but I don't know the last time I saw this much blood (not to mention T&A) in a movie at the theatre.

This is another movie, like ""Cabin Fever"", that must be taken for what it is: a fun, shocking gore-fest. I don't know why so many people gave this bad reviews. Were they expecting an art-house story? Would anyone expect academy award nominations for these types of films? Come on, people...

Roth hit the nail on the head with this one and I look for his future films to get better and better. After all, look where Peter Jackson started out. Does anyone want to call him a hack or a bad filmmaker for his early attempts with ""Bad Taste"" or ""Dead Alive/Brain Dead""? No, because anyone will tell you when you watch those films you must take them for what they are. Same rule applies to ""Cabin Fever"" & ""Hostel"".

1556820,3,B00005JOQB,"I may be one of the few people who actually enjoyed Eli Roth's first film, Cabin Fever, despite the many inherent flaws to the story, direction and all-over-the-place feel. I never bought into the tagline for that film as once of the most horrific films this generation. I've been watching horror films for as long as I can remember and Cabin Fever doesn't even scratch the surface of what constitutes a great horror film. But it did show me that Eli Roth was serious about genre and acknowledges and honors his roots and influences.

Hostel is Roth's sophomore effort, and just like Rob Zombie with his second film (The Devil's Rejects) he shows improvement as a filmmaker and continues to show that he respects the genre he's chosen to be in. Hostel is an exercise in hate, pain and nihilism. There really are no sympathetic characters in the film. Roth instead shows just how debased, cruel and inhumane people can be towards each other. Whether its through verbal, physical and intellectual means. I must point out that this film is not the torture-porn that alot of media-types call it. The gore and torture really doesn't start until fully halfway into the film. Everything before the second half begins can be summed us as soft-core porn. There's alot of nudity and sex in this first half and sets-up the three characters played by Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson and Eythor Gudjonsson.

These three college students are shown as boorish, misogynistic, insensitive louts who wish nothing more from their European vacation than sex, drugs, sex, drugs and more sex. It's this behavior that lures them to a town in Slovakia. An Eastern European, Soviet Bloc-era town where the women are stunning and horny to do whatever with foreign men. So, the trio takes off for this haven of horny, easy, beautiful women and the soft-core porn sequences continues once they arrive. But intermixed within these sequences are small bits and hints of dread and uneasiness. There's a certain sense of decay to the town and its inhabitants despite the normal scenery.

The second half promptly begins once they arrive in town and check into the hsotel. The gore mentioned by most reviewers are pretty graphic for what was finally given an R-rating. For people like myself and other horror aficionados the gore in Hostel is something we haven't seen before. The gore and torture scenes are in-your-face and Roth owes alot of thanks to Takashi Miike's Audition in how the scenes are presented. Roth's style of directing Hostel really brings to mind Miike's cult favorite. Takashi Miike even makes a brief appearance in the film.

One thing that I wanted Roth to do which he seemed to have pulled back from was going all-out in presenting Hostel as a horror exploitation film. This film tries to emulate the gory exploitation Italian and American films of the mid-70's to early 80's. Maybe the MPAA had forced Roth to trim certain scenes to get an R-rating. In certain scenes one could almost feel and sense that something was left out. Maybe the DVD release with an unrated, director's cut will shed some light to this. Roth's influences are plain to see, but he falls slightly short of reaching the lofty heights that Romero, Miike, Fulci, Craven (early), Hooper, Gordon and Argento established with their grand guignol works.

Hostel is a very good second offering from Eli Roth who really seem to like the horror genre and is constantly trying to pay it homage. His direction is much better and gone are the campy, almost comedic sequences from Cabin Fever. The film does fail to convey anything original to the genre, but succeeds enough in honoring its bloody past. Roth went from a genre-hack to very promising horror auteur with Hostel, but I am hoping his next project less of an homage to horror's past and adds to its future legacy. I'm happy to give this film a grade of 7/10.",1137110400,11,3872,4.8165413533834585

Firstly, one wonders why some of our fellow Amazon viewers watched it to begin with, only to vilify it for all of the elements that make it what it is. Yes, it is brutal, dark, and disturbing; it is a top-notch horror film after all, and not one of the current crop of PG-13 duds designed to make youngsters shriek and then giggle for 20 minutes. Was there some confusion as to the theme and tone of this movie? ""Misogynistic"" is the knee-jerk label of choice for almost all horror films today, yet 98% of the people being victimized here are men. They are being brutalized by men. Most of the people who work for this torture mill are men. Some bad gals do indeed serve as lures to bring in the victims, and some women work as prostitutes in the brothels of Amsterdam. Where does this rampant misogyny come in?
As to the other major point of contention, just how much onscreen brutality is utilized in this film? Of course there is some; this is a horror film about sick people who pay to torture people. Yet the onscreen sadism and violence pale in comparison to Passion of the Christ, whose scenes of sadism & brutal torture were 10 times as graphic and prolonged as anything found in Hostel. But Hostel is a nasty horror flick, while Passion was a devout and deeply moving film made for the most pious among us. [???]. As to the charges of the sex scenes approaching pornographic levels, this is indeed laughable. Nudity does not equal porn and there were no overtly graphic depictions of sex acts, though people did indeed have sex. See the distinction? Lastly, Mr Tarantino did not make this film, though he did have some editorial input as far as the script is concerned. He wished to lend support to relative newcomer Eli Roth, who both wrote and directed this movie.
Again, one wonders how so many people who are offended by sex, violence, & horror happened to find themselves watching this flick. Did they wander into the wrong theatre or pick it from the rental shelves with eyes closed? Hostel is what it is and it does its job very well indeed. It is great horror creating an effective aura of dread while offering an interesting political subtext to anyone interested enough to examine it. What more was required?",1136851200,,2451,4.572727272727272
1556934,5,B00005JOQB,"I saw the trailer for this movie around haloween and while watching I was trying to figure out who in the holy of holies would want to make this movie? When one of the most brilliant film makers name came up at the very end I scratched every previous thought and wanted to see it immeditly.

'Hostel' is a fantastic film weather you want to beleive it or not. Even though there are moments that you really wish you didn't have to see the audience is given characters that are developed so perfectly in such a short amount of time that you actually have feelings for the good guys and want the bad guys to be punished. Beleive me you get nothing but a great movie with Hostel.

I can understand why Quinten Tarentino chose to work on this movie. There is a very big Tarentino vibe throughout this movie. There is gore blended with quirky action and plenty of humor throughout. Don't even think about the grusome scenes from what I saw no one else in my theater did.",1136851200,,964,4.35
1556935,3,B00005JOQB,"I liked ""Hostel"" for the most part, I expected a ""SAW"" ripoff but I was glad that they altered the plot to not make it into another serial killer movie.

With that said, it is pretty violent, however amazingly I still think it wasn't too gory afterwards probably because I've seen my fair share of movies like these (Audition, CAT III)

Yes it's predictable, silly in some parts but in horror movies that goes with the territory. In this day and age after a million horror movies have been released over the past thirty years it's hard to be shocking or original anymore.

The acting was OK, the plot good, the twists OK as well. For me the second half of the film saves it, they even managed to add some humor to it. I have to admit as well when the American tourists who is still alive goes on his revenge spreed, the Audience I saw it with loved it....especially we'll you'll see.

(Spoilers)

We'll the plot gives a lot away a couple of horny American guys go aboard to Europe and find the ""Hostel"" hotel where they think they're fantasies will come true.

Enter Natalya and Svetland the local sluts who in fact are part of the torture ring in which they get paid for their ""services""

Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) are too naive to see what's going and when they get drunk they fall for the trap.

Josh is tortured brutally (as with all the other victims in the slaughterhouse).

There were some memorable images, Paxton's ""tour"" of sorts inside this asylum is very creepy. Especially when he sees that this bastards clearly are getting a sick satisfaction of doing this.

He escape by sheer luck , and thus his revenge takes place. Hernandez is good in this although there's not too much character development. His revenge is pretty well played out though.

I'am sure we might see more blood and mayhem on a DVD cut but for now Hostel is a pretty entertaining but perverse little flick.

It was as Quentin and Roth admit filmed on a low budget and it shows but they do manage to use that to an advantage setting up some creepy shots and delivering the ""goods"" when the movie calls for it.

It ain't that bad of a movie, Quentin did produce it so it ain't too bad. Now there's word of a possible ""Hostel 2"". Interesting stuff. I would recommend but be warned of the content.

Ask for those (...)who complained about how sick the
movie is or it's in bad taste? Damn people get a life!!!!

It's only a freaking movie, and it's geared for horror,
if it's not to your liking go rent a Disney flick.
If you don't like the movie for the content alone
and don't ever bother to discuss the script,
acting or directing then you're really not doing
a good review.",1136851200,,2679,4.438775510204081
1556936,2,B00005JOQB,"I went into this movie with high expectations, perhaps too high, especially since I saw that Quentin Tarantino had produced it. But Tarantino fans should be warned that this is in no way a Tarantinoesque film. I had hoped that the film would deal with the fascination with torture and suffering that exists in the human psyche and the strange desire to witness it even though it is horrible. Instead I found the movie clunky and uneven and afraid to be anything accept a horror film just like a thousand others. As you will hear in other reviews, the first and second half of the movie are very different: the first being a college sex romp across Europe and the second being an escape from a chamber of horrors. Unfortunatly, the two parts do not match up well. The two characters who are most sympathetic and well developed in the first half get killed off almost right away in the second half. The one who remains alive, an obnoxious and careless ""ugly American"" (played by Jay Hernandez) inexplicably turns into an action figure who ends up coolly killing off about as many people as the torturers themselves in order to escape. It becomes a familiar cat and mouse game of the loan survivor sneaking through dark tunnels trying to save his life and much of the true gore of the torture chamber is gentled down to simple screams in the dark and shadowy images that invoke a walk through a carnival spook house, and all of especially gory scenes with spraying blood and severed limbs will be old hat to anyone familiar with this genre. The movie also cowers out of delving into underlying political and social issues that momentarily rear their heads. Why, for example, do the European torturer pay such a high price for American victims? The issue is there, but then the movie chooses to do nothing with it. Also, why does this place where the rich pay 50k to torture and kill innocent tourists exist in the first place? How can hundreds of people dissappear in this town each year without arrousing suspicion? I suppose that if you don't mind the tired out slasher, Texas Chainsaw Massacre formula once again (but now set in a European hostel) you may enjoy this movie, but do not expect anything better than that.",1136851200,,2218,4.631979695431472

I think one of them mentions something to that effect about when they go back to their normal lives they'll have memories of the girls they scored with(cheesy yes, but not unbelievable).  As their trip turns into a nightmare the story is full of an exciting, yet very violent/graphic story.  Thing is I was entertained even looking through my fingers as I covered my eyes I sat there hoping things worked out and wondered if I'd ever travel to that part of the world myself after this movie.

Instead What You Get Is A Over Rated Horror Film. Scary No! Sadistic Yes! Grusome Yes! But Its Lacking In Showing You The Gore Scenes.

1556939,4,B00005JOQB,"I'll mention right off the bat that serious horror aficionados aren't likely to be terribly impressed by the gore and sadism of 'Hostel'. They shouldn't need to be told this-- Major release films are rarely ever particularly remarkable in these areas.  Certainly, it's well above average, but don't listen to the hype, and then go see it and complain that it doesn't live up to it.  (Honestly, 'Hostel' is decidedly less intense than 'Wolf Creek', though it certainly has more out and out gore)  Frankly, this still feels like a modern, mainstream horror film, just one that a bit more extreme than most of the competition.  Still, gutlessness is the major problem of mainstream horror, so the added intensity goes a long ways.

'Hostel' opens by following the hedonistic adventures of three young guys in eastern Europe, two Americans and one from Iceland.  Like many others, I don't find these characters particularly appealing, though they are likable enough that I found myself rooting for them rather than the killers, so I guess they aren't all bad.  They're primarily interested in sex, and get a lead on a rather inexplicably fancy hostel in Slovakia which is even more inexplicably filled with countless, uhh, loose, attractive women.  Yes, this movie does have a ton of nudity in it, though it isn't all quite as gratuitous as some would have you believe.  (Mild Spoiler:  This is because the hostel itself is a trap, and the women are the bait. Admittedly, this is a fairly convenient excuse to have a lot of naked women, but it *is* a reason, which is more than you can say for the nudity in most films.)  Some have accused 'Hostel' of being misogynist, what with the women pretty much only existing to be ogled.  This displays peculiar logic, as it supposes that if one finds a women sexually attractive, that means you hate her.  The term that ought to be used is sexist, and while I don't know if I entirely agree, there is a case to be made.  However, I must note that the men in this film exist only to kill & torture or to be tortured & killed. (There is relatively little violence against women, emphasis on `relatively'.)  In short, we are only interested in their bodies, regardless of whether or not they're male or female, and in this regard I think the film is really quite fair.  Perhaps this makes it misanthropic, or maybe it's just a damn horror movie and all you social critics will need to accept the fact that they aren't gonna cause the downfall of western civilization.

The film looks very good for costing under 5 mil, and is fairly stylishly shot. The European setting is a nice change from your more stereotypical horror movie settings. The music, however, is occasionally rather overwrought, but this doesn't ever hurt it too much.  The acting is competent, though this doesn't matter too much as all the characters are very shallow and simplistic.  They do sell the pain of the torture scenes pretty well, however, which is important.  That kinda thing doesn't disturb you if you don't buy the victim's performance.

The movie does take a while to get going, but most horror films do, ya know.  It turns out that there are some who've found that garden variety hedonism is no longer thrilling enough, and that violence is the answer, leading to an underground industry in torture and murder in Slovakia.  Naturally, Paxton, Oli and Josh fall victim to this murder for money business.  `Hostel' is hurt by the fact that the most gruesome, intense scenes are towards the middle of the film, rather than the end.  In fact, the first real full horror scene is the nastiest one, as the victim is assailed with a power drill, has his achilles tendons sliced and is generally tormented by the killer.  The scene actually leaves a fair bit to the imagination, but is still one of the most brutal scenes you'll see in a major release horror film.  Roth is fairly committed to grossing us out, going beyond traditional gore to include that most unpleasant of substances, vomit. (At one point a character vomits while he has a ball-gag in his mouth.  That would be exceedingly unpleasant.)  It remains fairly intense for a while, and Roth actually comes up with a relatively clever way for our final protagonist to escape the torture chamber, but after this things drop off a bit.  Roth includes a bit too much humor and some of the gore is wacky enough that it lacks the real visceral intensity of earlier scenes, (see the eye scene) plus there's just some weird, inexplicable stuff that totally doesn't work.  (Particularly the murderous gang of 9 year olds.  What the hell?)  It just generally becomes a bit too conventional, with Paxton just sneaking around the torture compound, and it utilizes that most tired of conventions, the old scenario where a character pretends to be dead and must hide in a pile of corpses and limbs.  It's always pretty good, however, and it does close with one of the more intense scenes of the film.  It still can't match the earlier stuff, but it hits pretty hard after the less visceral section.

Recently we've seen a few more gruesome, intense horror films pop up in theaters.  I don't think this is as good as `High Tension' or `Wolf Creek', but it's a solid effort and deserves to be mentioned alongside such films.",1136764800,,5284,4.710554951033732
1556940,5,B00005JOQB,"i saw this movie today and i loved the hell out of it!  yeah i tend to get turned off by movies with large amounts of sexual content, but in horror/gore movies i don't mind it. *spoilers ahead... lets see starts out with three guys...the cocky american, his shy hometown friend, and a loud obnoxious icelander they met in europe. basically they just want to do drugs, get drunk and get action from whores. well they go to this place in bulgaria i think where they get everything they want until one fateful day the loud icelander disappears with his ""prostitute friend"" ..qucikly after that, the happy party feel of the movie turns into a hellish nightmare..the lighting of the whole movie adds to the creepy depression. i agree, the three guys have enough things about them to where you don't hate them. well maybe that icelandic guy didn't.... anyways, surprisingly, the cocky american survives out of the three(i seriously thought the shy passive guy would have) i liked the character who ends up being the hero in the end. great character change. i was impressed and shocked by the gore...the shock being more like ""i cant believe im actually watching this awesome stuff in a theater!""  also the ending was kick arse!..i won't spoil it, but those of you who know..the bathroom scene was amazing!

sadly, i don't think this movie will last long in the theaters..it will be lucky if it makes it to the middle of february. its a shame how failures of films such as wedding crashers last like 3 months and on and good movies like this and land of the dead last maybe 2 if lucky in theaters...and NO i see no similarities to american pie and eurotrip(both horrible movies) besides the fact they go to europe. good job quentin tarantino and eli roth! you have made one of the most brutal serious movies i have seen. i recommend ""ichi the killer"" and ""riki oh"" to fans of this film.  oh wait, most of you who gave this more than 3 stars probally already own those.  all in all, if you are expecting a cliche hollywood turd, than you best leave this chilling film to cult movie, true horror and gore fans.",1136764800,,2101,4.5476190476190474

1557011,2,B00005JOQB,"Gotta blame Jim Carrey and Steve Martin.  These dudes' latest box office clunkers were showing at my local theater--leaving HOSTEL the lone remaining alternative inside Theater #1.  I didn't know much about HOSTEL; heck, I didn't know anything about

HOSTEL.  But I do like staying in exotic hotels, so what the hey?  I realized this film was produced by Quentin Tarantino, but for all I knew the controversial director/producer could've had a change of creative heart and made a movie about room service and breakfast buffets. Was worth a look, anyway.

Well.  HOSTEL, at least at first, was like Comedy Central's ""The Man Show"" on acid:  three dweebs (two Americans, one Icelander, all unlikeable) traipsing through Europe in pursuit of the ultimate hedonistic high.  The bongs and the broads are plentiful, but our three protagonists (Have I mentioned they're unlikeable?) want more.  They are told of a special hostel in an eastern European country behind the old Soviet Iron Curtain.  They are shown some pics of naked vixens taken via a camera phone--taken allegedly at the hostel of Paradise--and the three guys are on the next train headed east.

As predictable as predictability itself, all is not well at the hostel of Paradise, and the three travelers, one by one, fall prey to a meat grinder torture chamber--a warped and demented establishment where patrons from the world over pay exorbitant sums to slice and dice unwilling (and screaming) victims.  One of our three ""heroes"" manages to catch a break during his fun session and escape (or at least, run around from room to room, from incinerator to parking lot, and back again, and to parking lot again, ad infinitum); the plot then takes on a morbid cat-and-mouse chase, until our ""hero"" extracts a totally unbelievable and out-of-character pound of vengeance flesh.

Writer/director Eli Roth bombards the viewer with blood and wounds and gore galore--yet the carnage looked like something a group of junior high kids would come up with by raiding their folks' freezers and slinging the stuff around.  In fact, the gore very much reminded me of Peter Jackson's early horror offerings (and that's pretty sad).  As another fact, I wasn't sure--by all the nonsensical slipping in pools of blood and split-second amputations and groping for appendages and so on--if Roth was really trying to present a horror flick, or a parody of a horror flick.  And if HOSTEL is a parody, it's a bad parody; if it's a horror movie, it's even worse.

But still better than Martin or Carrey.

1557013,3,B00005JOQB,"Quentin Tarantino presents. That's intimidating. A talented director supporting a horror movie. Must be good, right? The trailers looked awesome and the reviews were very positive. So, I decided to watch this (instead of Munich! Doh!) with high expectations. I was expecting a movie like Saw. What I got was half American Pie/ soft porn and half good horror fun.
This movie is 1h35 min. long. The first 40 minutes flat out suck. Sure there were some hot babes, all naked, but I went to this movie to see a horror movie.
The plot centers around 3 friends traveling through Europe wanting to get stoned and find some hot babes. They find themselves in Amsterdam and have a little fun before some guy tells them to go to Slovakia to find the best girls. They find them, have fun and then things go horribly wrong. The only problem is tha it takes half of the movie to get there.
The opening sequence of the movie acts like we're going to be in for a great ride. Don't trust it.
For sure, they picked some gorgeous women to be in this movie. So for sure, they're some really nice women naked. But the problem is that I wanted to watch a horror movie not Euro Trip 2.
Once the movie kicks into gear, it's great. The ending is also great. One of the 3 friends manages to escape from a basement full of psychos and executes sweet revenge. Anf boy, the revenge is gory as hell!
The movie also is powerful. It had a very powerful message. These 3 friends are lokking for a good time but they end up in a very sick world. Kind of like 8mm but on a much larger scale. Sick, rich freaks pay other psychos to murder people in horrific ways. The best part and creepiest may I add is that everyone is connected. And once you get towards the end, you'll see that everything was set up and everyone was in on it. It's very disturbing and sad.
My recommendation is to rent it when it comes out on DVD. The first half isn't a horror movie, the last is. What a shame.
But the 2nd half will please for sure. While the movie isn't scary but flat out gory, the 2nd half is still good. And if you liked Saw, the 2nd half is a good appetizer while waiting for the 3rd one (if you saw it, you'll know what I mean).
So, Hostel is a powerful movie with a great second half filled with revenge at tis finest. The final sequence is great and gory and it will make you scream: kill that stupid piece of sh**! Kill him!
Hostel is dissapointing and I nearly left the theater. But thank goodness I didn't because the 2nd half is a true horror movie. Too bad the entire movie wasn't.
Now I know what Tarantino should do. He should take Uma Thurman (Beatrice Kiddow from Kill Bill) and throw her in this sick little torture place. That would make for great fun! Please mr. Tarantino, make my day, we want to see Uma kick more a#$!",1136678400,5,2794,4.253759398496241
1557014,3,B00005JOQB,"This movie is so schizophrenic that you may think you're in the wrong theater for the first half. A pair of ugly American tourists and their found-along-the-way buddy from Iceland run around Europe in a typical obscenity laden attempt to score as much nookie and pot as they can consume, and are basically rude and spoiled obnoxious turds. (And in typical xenophobic fashion, guess which of the three tourons gets offed first? Hint: He didn't have an American Passport...). In fact, the first part of the film is a cross between a tour advertisement for the gorgeous nature of Europe - ""Hostel"" has some amazing cinematography - and a soft core porn flick. B**bies? Everywhere.

But then comes the evil that ""Hostel"" is being sold as. Those hot babes? They are evil femme fatales selling out cute tourists to a place where you can pay to have your sickest fantasies played out. (And in another telling undercurrent of conscious, is it odd that the only sick designs that anyone has involve the brutal torture and murder of the victims? And that an American victim fetches the best price? No fantasy hot sex? Oh wait, the ones who have the hot sex fantasies are getting murdered! It's back to the old slasher rule of 70's horror...lower head gets too much action, upper head will get decapitated.)

Ok, so I did sit on the edge of my seat for most of the film's second and third segments. You don't get much actual horror from the movie itself, there's a lot of obvious screaming and flying body parts, but no direct shot of said torture (like no-one in the theater I was in could tell the difference...pah). By the film's third act, it's devolved into a cat-and-mouse game of escape with revenge as the primary motivational drive.

But with the lead characters in the movie being such dorkwad tourist-morons ('tourons'), the early killing doesn't elicit much sympathy. In fact, with the news of 2005 and early 2006 reporting that the American military is all to happy to ship suspects out the country and off of the radar screen to be ""questioned"" (hah!) without the quaint regulations of those pesky activist courts, then how hard is it to imagine a place like ""Hostel"" in a corrupt county where those rules do not apply? And how disturbed will you be when the scene where the little kids turn from candy-chompers to skull-stompers? Or will you, like some in the theater I saw ""Hostel"" in, cheer them on?

Maybe the earlier analogy of ""Hostel"" to those 70's slasher flicks was not quiet complete. ""Hostel"" may be more appropriately compared to those 50's and 60's mutant movies where our national subconscious used atomically enhanced critters to scare us into fearing the Cold War. ""Hostel"" uses images of foreigners running a tourist death-camp to remind us that all it takes is one sleazy non-American with a bankroll to off as many citizens and sympathizers as he can, as long as your willing to pay for the privilege. Quentin Tarantino backing Eli Roth to issue political allegory as horror films? Hey, stranger things have happened.",1136678400,6,3039,4.771863117870723
1557015,3,B00005JOQB,"I agree with several critics and a few people here on Amazon that this is not the film promised to audiences. For all the hype about pushing the envelope, ""Hostel"" is quite tame folks. There are a few good ""gore"" scenes, but I would say all the torture scenes put together would probably only add up to 10 or 15 minutes at the most. The rest of the film is all atmosphere and suggestion (i.e. sounds hinting at what is happening). Honestly, the way people were talking, I expected at least one gratuitously long, horrific, detailed torture scene that was almost difficult to watch. Nope. And during the rather brief scenes, we still see very little...again, suggestion. I still give the film 3 stars because of the excellent atmosphere, which somehow provides an increasing sense of dread before we ever see what happens inside the slaughterhouse. The film also makes you think a little...what if there WAS a place where people could pay to torture people for revenge, sick pleasures, etc? But overall the payoff is nothing like what we people were promised. I will wait for a director's cut (you just KNOW one is coming) and try this film again. That said, I would not reccomend the theatrical cut to anyone expecting an extreme horror film. ""Kill Bill"", which is an ACTION flick, is far and away more graphic than this ""horror"" film.

1557019,3,B00005JOQB,"I think some hardcore horror fans will be delighted with Hostel, but this movie isn't for everyone.  The first half is softcore porn, enough to push the envelope of an R-rating.  It's about 2 young American tourists, looking for loose women in Europe (they can't get any at home).  They check into a Hostel where they find their girls, but their friend disappears the next morning, followed shortly by one of the American boys.  It turns out they're being kidnapped by a torture-for-sick-pleasure ring.  The second half is lurid, gruesome, bloody torture along the line of Saw and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, enough to break the envelope - it might have needed an NC-17 rating.  I don't have any problem with that except that it is gratuitous violence for the sake of gruesome lurid violence itself, without any point, without any redeeming surprise twist at the end like in Saw.  You might be attracted to the film if you're a Quentin Tarantino fan, but as a whole the movie's not quite as good as some of his others.  And if you're a fan of objectionably pointless gruesome violence, you'll still find slightly better movies for that.  Personally I liked Saw and Final Destination somewhat more.  For the average movie viewer, it's not scary, just repulsive.  I'm not saying that to dis the movie, just to explain why I can't give it 4or 5 stars.  But I can imagine some horror fans will consider it a 5-star instant cult classic.

7941402,1,B00005JOQB,"This type of ""sick entertainment"" is what's wrong with the world today. Don't want my young kids growing up to watch trash like this. Lost all of the plot/suspense with over the top gore .....(Yawn) If you want a good horror flick look elsewhere .......this is way too predicable + exploitative What IS shocking is that the 4-5 stars reviews up here are more frightening than this worthless flick. Wow!",1521072000,,402,4.757142857142857
