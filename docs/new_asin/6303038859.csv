2334417,5,6303038859,Loved the humor and era of this time. Great songs and is a movie one could watch over and over. All these old movies are clean in words and clean in humor.,1370736000,,155,3.875
2334418,3,6303038859,"this low budget 1947 b&w movie does not have the best picture and sound
quality but it's a light fun movie to watch. it's a period piece around
1900 with good singing by kenny baker and some dance numbers. enjoy!",1230768000,,212,4.325
2334419,3,6303038859,"The chance to see the vicaceous Jane Frazee in a workaday musical that combined Gay Nineties nostalgia with better production values that one usually expected from Republic Pictures sixty years ago, make this musical comedy worth watching. Gail Patrick and Victor McLaglen are in good form, too, and old pro Allan Dwan kept the picture moving along so smartly, it seems shorter than its 86 minutes. Not a classic, but you could do worse for something to pass the time. Visual and sound quality make it very watchable.",1222041600,2,517,4.886363636363637
2334420,5,6303038859,"This is the movie where the ""Calendar Girl"" song comes from and it's performed very well. It's a musical in the ""Funny Girl"" tradition and tells the story of a singer who just wants to get a break so he can make teh big time. Of course he does --- the point of the  movie is just to see how he does it. There are enough twists and turns along the way, but the real point of this movie is the  music - which is excellent.",1154044800,2,420,3.872093023255814
2334421,5,6303038859,"""`Calendar Girl' has a wonderfully constructed story, and I found it immensely entertaining. It has all the trimmings of musicals at their very best. I really loved the idyllic Broadway feel of this exuberant movie. This beautiful vintage movie overflows with life.""",1146528000,,266,5.357142857142857
2334422,5,6303038859,"I know that a lot of guys claim to ""just not like musicials."" But let me give you some advice -  lots of women love musicials, especially the classics.

That's why I bought and ordered this movie and it did not disappoint at all. It is a very traditional hollywood musical complete with show tunes lavish sets and beautiful costumes.

I invited my girlfriend over, we put it in the DVD player and had a really nice evening and she was impressed that I wasn't making her watch another Die Hard movie.",1146096000,4,499,4.4021739130434785
8069522,5,6303038859,"Why haven't I seen this before? A delightful movie with excellent production values in spite of its B rating. I really enjoyed the script which was clever & the wonderful musical numbers & dancing, which moved the plot along. I'm grateful to Amazon for including this offering. Since I live in Greenwich Village & study its history, I'm always interested to see how it is portrayed in films. While this movie is far from the truth, I still loved the atmosphere of this crazy community of artists & the artistic license that was taken. Very well acted with lots of pizazz & great jokes! Thoroughly enjoyable!",1520294400,,607,4.735849056603773

8069524,4,6303038859,"While this print of the public domain B-musical ""Calendar Girl"" from Republic Pictures leaves a lot to be desired in the way of picture quality and sound, this DVD-R is probably as good a print as you will find.  Unlike other cut-rate companies, this DVD from Nostalgia Family offers the complete film. And at this price it can't be beat.  A true novelty from  a studio mostly known for low-budget westerns and Saturday serials, this musical doesn't do a bad job in trying to keep up with the other lower end studios.  (It certainly beats the Monogram programmers any day.)",1472428800,,573,4.7
8069525,1,6303038859,I saw five minutes of this movie and decided to turn it off. Terrible acting by the lead actress!,1469836800,,97,4.157894736842105

8069528,5,6303038859,This is a 1947 black and white musical. Good story,1459123200,,50,4.1

8069530,2,6303038859,"The video and sound of this copy is poor, a very unknown to barely B cast. Actual voices and dance pretty good, but story is just fluff. Couldn't recommend.",1390694400,,156,4.413793103448276
