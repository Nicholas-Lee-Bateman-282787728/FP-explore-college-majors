In this case, my own experience with this series is borne out by a large number of those who voted on the Anime News Network (a comparatively small number in this instance; I'm not surprised), when asked to review this title. To whit, absolutely atrocious /worst ever.

To be honest right up front, I gave up after six episodes; something I've never done with any other anime (or even C/J/K television drama). Given that, I don't know how it ended. Perhaps there was some legitimate resolution and justification for the story. It didn't appear as of episode six.

A young woman is dropped off at a mansion by her father's chauffeur while the father will be away somewhere. It turns out the mansion is inhabited by a gang of young vampires. They're a pretty inhospitable bunch, who proceed to treat the young woman like a piece of trash, solely for the purpose of using her for lunch meat. This isn't a funzy bunch of nice, buddy-buddy vampire guys. Rather a bunch of pretty callous muckers.

In the six episodes I watched, I saw little other than their continued abusive treatment of her, with little to either explain why her father had dumped her off at this site in the first place (maybe the chauffeur went to the wrong address?) or whether this abuse was going to taper off in the latter part of the series. I assumed she'd be rescued or they'd be dispatched before all was said and done. But by mid-way, I'd decided that enough was enough.

Perhaps if I'd had an interest in sadism, I'd have continued, but with no redeeming quality to this series evident by it's mid-point, I decided it was time to wrap it up and find myself something more entertaining to watch.

I'm certainly not a prude. I enjoyed Shingetsutan Tsukihime as much as I enjoyed Taisho Baseball Girls. The action of Fate/Stay Night as much as I enjoyed Diamond Daydreams. If the authors of this anime planned more uplifting development in the latter part of the series, they should've given just a smidgen of indication in the former part.

I haven't watched any of the horror genre of animes, so I can't tell how this one stacks up to some of the others. But, in a rare instance of intense discontent, I can't really recommend this series to anyone looking for a fun and/or entertaining anime series. Not unless, as noted, abuse of a young girl, nearly to the point of sadism, is your cup of tea. Visit the ANN for other viewer's votes on this series.",1398556800,,2680,4.629473684210526
