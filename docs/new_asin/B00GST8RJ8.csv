6109305,5,B00GST8RJ8,This movie will touch your very heart!  I saw it and was so moved I just sat there for several minutes after it was over just reveling in the good feelings!,1385424000,19,156,4.032258064516129
6109306,5,B00GST8RJ8,"This movie is such a wonderful cinematic experience for Christians and non-Christians alike. The supremely talented and beautiful AJ Michalka delivers an absolutely draw-you-in performance as Grace, an 18-year-old singer whose relationship with God is put to the ultimate test when she flies out to Hollywood to try to become the chart-topping superstar she's always dreamed of being. Along the way she endures a number of pitfalls and faces the ultimate challenge or either giving up her Christian faith entirely or rediscovering it for the good of her family. Whether you truly believe in God and the effort He puts into keeping us all safe or just want to watch a great movie, you will not be disappointed one bit by this enormously heartwarming and inspiring story of finding the right path to take and knowing what the Lord Himself has in mind for you. Grace Unplugged is seriously a phenomenal film that you must see and share with all your loved ones.",1385424000,81,958,4.883435582822086

I hope others see that the father was not acting as a strong & loving Christian father, but one who was ruled by emotions & a demand for control because of his position.

6110580,4,B00GST8RJ8,"Good pacing; storyline pretty good; in-depth characterization; some dynamic changes; acting and dialogue OK but improve dramatically as the story continues. The difficult trick with Christian movies is that they often fall into didactic (or preachy) dialogue, although sometimes that would be realistic; there's some of that here but it's much more tolerable (and sounds less self-righteous) than in other movies of type and genre. As a musician, I wish they would have explored the differences between worship and entertainment and motive a little more, since that is an interesting subject that was glanced upon. The true heart of the film REALLY is shown and not told, which is good, but may have been amplified a bit more. OVERALL, a really good movie that is worth seeing.",1439251200,2,777,5.125984251968504

6110603,4,B00GST8RJ8,"I am always on the lookout for well-made Christian films. While this one is by no means perfect, it is better than many out there. It is rather cliche and predictable, and some of the scenes are overexposed, but I was still completely engaged with the characters and the story. It is a movie I will be keeping on my shelf and watching again. I was teary-eyed and worshiping and caused me to thank God once again for His grace in my own life. HOWEVER, when I watch this film again I will be stopping it before the last five minutes, which left me feeling a bit cheated. It was like they were presenting a good message and then backpedaled. I would still recommend the movie, whether you watch the last five minutes or not. It's not terrible and may prompt discussion, but I was sad it was included as I felt it was out of place and shallow.
*Spoiler*
The movie would have had a more powerful ending without the ""2 years later"" part. Either that, or change what happened 2 years later (for example, if Grace had continued to be a music teacher, or some other less glamorous but respectable pursuit). Not that you can't be a recording artist and following the Lord, but the end was too neatly packaged: ""Look, you can have Jesus AND be a star!"". It would have been nice to see her choose to use her talents to magnify the Lord without being in the limelight.",1437264000,,1355,4.359683794466403

If you want to see a great Christian movie then Grace Unplugged is the one for you.  I was amazed at how realistic the movie is.  Grace did the normal things that any teenager would do when they think they know what is best for them better than the parents.  I appreciate it because there wasn't any violence, obscenities or nudity.  This movie contradicts the saying that Hollywood needs to write unclean parts to make money but Grace Unplugged proved them wrong.

He knows everything already, nothing is hid from him yet we fool ourselves into thinking we don't have to be honest with him?
Love this movie, recommended that my daughter watch it with my 13 year old granddaughter who is very musically talented and is in both Choir at school and youth group and also has played violin for since she was in third grade.

All though I know that happens in life it was reassuring to know there is still hope and mercy after making mistakes.

Another Christian oriented movie, not as professionally done as those by the Kendricks, but it held our interest, and the message, although Faith based, was not cloying.

6110812,4,B00GST8RJ8,"Good modern depiction of a prodigal child.  It was powerful how we saw Grace's eyes opened to the devil's strategies along the way, especially with the guy trying to get her in bed. My only issue is it handled her time away with a bit of kid gloves (I'm sure this had to do with target audience and not wanting it to be rated R, which is cool) ... backsliding has a deep and profound effect on a persons life and unfortunately the road is rarely that protected and not always a happy ending.

Moments of insight weren't just had out of the clear blue.  Time was taken to draw each character to that moment where he/she said, ""this is what the other was saying all along.""

We see many young Christians who start singing in church and end up swallowed by the entertainment world all because of wanting to be famous.

6110859,4,B00GST8RJ8,"This movie feels a a bit like a good made for TV movie and although not every movie can be at the top of the charts I always welcome good stories and faith-based movies and feel they do very well given the lack of major Hollywood backing. I give it 3.5 stars for good values and a good common story of real life and learning for oneself. I recommend it but it's just not the best movie made to deserve 5 stars.

*(These next two paragraphs were copied directly from the movie site, as it summarizes it best)
""Having just turned 18, Grace Trey aspires to more than just singing at her church, where the worship leader is her fathera former pop star. So, with the help of Mossy, her dad's former manager, Grace records a cover version of her dad's old Top-10 hit, runs off to Los Angeles, and begins to taste the kind of stardom she's always dreamed about.""

""Yet with each rung of the ladder she climbs, Grace feels more and more pressure to compromise her values, further straining her relationship with her parents. Will everything she experiences lead her to reject her faith  or rediscover it?""

Real life inspirational stories honestly portray relationships with others AND ourselves and this movie reflects how many times we want to overly protect others from making mistakes when more often we ourselves know people learn best from personal experience. The irony is, being overly-protective and without good communication with those we care about, people often drive the one they are trying to protect to having to prove for themselves the very thing they were intended to avoid in the first place.

It tells of the importance of not giving up our personal ideals, religious or not, for the thing we desire most, like ""rock star"" image and life. Most children in today's society dream of the rock star image without understanding worldy influence and consequences they WILL have to face. More often then not, media only focuses on the occasional bliss and not the realities most often faced in life.

The story also portrays the lack of communication between parents and their children and the difficulty of having to let children experience trials on their own, as we all learn better from hands-on experience. As with the father in this movie, parents often force rules without explaining their personal experience and foreseen consequences, so children can't grasp the whole picture and can't understand the rules and the truth of their parents' love. How can we truly expect another to understand our own conclusion without explaining the problem and work it took to get there. Can we really expect to give an answer with an algebraic equation without first teaching the process?

Some reviews complained the movie strayed too far from presenting the gospel, which I did feel lacking in the beginning, however I soon realized it was not intended to teach about the gospel as one story teller understands it, but allows the movie to appeal to a wider audience, since we all believe and understand differently, especially youth. If you had expectation of a story about a Christian including more gospel truth, just remember even parables are stories about truths which help inspire us even though they don't spell out the Christian gospel at all.

If we have true conviction we should not give up our personal beliefs for fame and money and we can each be happy and successful in our own way.",1420761600,,3400,4.8

6111000,4,B00GST8RJ8,"Grace Unplugged is the story of a daughter in her teen years, rebelling against her parents. In this case, she is a talented musician only getting to play for the Christian parishioners. Amanda Michalka (AJ) plays Grace realistically. She speaks and acts like a rebellious teenager and her innocence and naiveness is convincing. If I had to fault the film, it would be that it is too predictable and somewhat unbelievable at the end. AJ carries this film, but that is not enough to make it rise above a parable.",1416787200,,511,4.688888888888889

6111030,5,B00GST8RJ8,"I really liked this movie and it was the 2nd time watching it.  I thought it dealt with the issue of young adult children wanting to pursue their own dreams even if they were contrary to what their parents wanted for them, especially when the dreams might have many unhealthy consequences. It showed real life emotions on both sides.  Because biblical values were taught and practiced in the home the young woman had a strong foundation about following a plan for her life that God would bless. Still, she wanted to spread her wings and follow her dreams anyway, and she did. The way the parents dealt with the situation, after some of their own soul searching and asking God for help, showed their unconditional love for her and that their hearts were always open to her.
Eventually, after some trial and error, and the support of a new friend, Grace's eyes were open and she understood for herself where God would truly fulfill her dreams.",1415923200,,941,4.662650602409639

6111156,5,B00GST8RJ8,"My hubby and I LOVED this film. Grace, like many teenagers, is rebelling. Her dad is a little too hard on her which makes the rebellion even worse. When a music producer comes to Johnny and asks if he will go on tour with a remastered version of his hit song, Misunderstood, from many years ago, he declines as he believes the Lord has him in the right place and his life has changed since then.

Grace, who has been leading worship with her dad, goes behind her parents back and agrees to do the song. Boy, is she in for a shock. She can definitely sing but is SO naive about other parts of life and how people in the music industry work.

Watch this movie to see how God protects Grace and eventually brings redemption and forgiveness, restoring her relationship with the Lord and her family. Yes, Johnny repents also as she sees the mistakes he has made.

I wouldn't recommend this movie for young children as there is alcohol and bar scenes but for teenagers, yes! The acting is top notch as is the music.",1413676800,,1009,4.3563829787234045

6111194,4,B00GST8RJ8,"Grace is a young woman who goes out on her own at 18 to find out the real world may not be all she thought it would be.  She began her singing career in church, singing with her father on the worship team.  There are plans in the works to release a Christian CD; but her dad seems to be holding her back regarding her talent.  Its not until he releases her to God that he realizes her talent and allows God to work in her life.

As parents its a fine line to walk ... raising our children and then allowing them to make decisions on their own.  Trusting that they listened to us and are capable of making the right decisions. Yet, wanting your 18 year old daughter to go out into the music industry by herself is definitely a parent's right to be concerned.

Rebellion is part of growing up.
Giving our children back to God is tough (actually they are His and He has loaned them to us).

At least ""Fireproof,"" ""Courageous"" and ""Facing Giants,"" weren't afraid to share the True Gospel!!  Feel good movies don't do it. Truth and Godly Doctrine are passed by in this movie.

6111361,4,B00GST8RJ8,"Grace unplugged was a  great film that talks about what happens when your value system gets challenged by fame and success in the music industry. It also shows how the music industry moulds people into saleable items. This story shows when one very talented musician / vocalist named Grace feels limited in her music with her father. When her father is asked to make a comeback from a very successful song, he declines because it almost ruined his life. His daughter records the track with her feel in it, sends it to the record company and is accepted to come and record the song. At the same time her relationship with her father begins to breaks down.  Grace decides to go to LA and make it big.  However she finds very quickly that she is constantly being moulded by her manager and the record company.  All of this confronts her into making  choices that may compromise her faith while opening her eyes to the world of the music industry.  Without saying much more, this is a great movie to see and a very real picture of what can and has happened to many talented musos in the recording industry.",1411344000,2,1102,4.5125628140703515

Also great for parents to watch to see that we should not provoke our young people.  In the end, God is glorified and the entire family is involved.",1411344000,,449,4.309523809523809

If this is a message that will lift you up, you will like this movie.",1411257600,5,407,4.652777777777778

6111368,3,B00GST8RJ8,"I tried to be open minded. But this is just another annoying Christian movie, full of clichs and mellow characters. Completely predictable, the plot is flat and serves only one purpose: tell you you'd better follow the glorious path of righteousness (which by the way in this movie seems dubiously patriarchal and sexist) . I try to be open minded. I don't mind watching a Christian movie if it is a good movie. Or listening to a Christian song if it is a good song. Unfortunately, it is too rarely the case, and this movie is no exception.",1411171200,3,540,4.520408163265306

6111420,3,B00GST8RJ8,"Having rented Grace Unplugged for the family to view with no recommendations or expectations, I was pleasantly surprised by the capability of the actors. AJ Michalka, James Denton, Kevin Pollack, Shawnee Smith, and Michael Welch all did an excellent job with the roles they were given. The inspirational music fit the story and advanced the plot. The ""owning your faith"" message was presented without being too heavy-handed or preachy. However, [SPOILER] the takeaway for the viewer at the end of the movie is this: if you stand up for your faith, then you can be a minor Christian celebrity. This was certainly reinforced by the Chris Tomlin cameo. In this regard, the movie falls into the familiar Christian cinematic trappings of wrapping up complicated issues with a tidy bow as everyone ends up with a happy ending.",1405555200,3,820,4.992700729927007

We tried everything we could think of but nothing worked, the DVD just ""quit""! We notified Amazon and they sent out a second DVD at no cost to us and provided a return label for the bad DVD. Got together with our friends and re-watched about the last half of the movie (to refresh our memories). Were coming to the spot where it stopped before and were all kind of holding our breath. It reached the same point and sort of "" jumped"" or paused very briefly - like half second, but then went on. We all just looked at each other when it paused but got a big laugh when it continued. I didn't catch the location number, but it's right after Grace & Quentin are on the beach, then get up and are walking away and Quentin is telling her, basically, what she needs to hear. (I won't say more). Anyway....that little ""pause/jump"" seems to be a glitch in the recording of the DVD, so be aware!",1399075200,,1037,4.242424242424242

6111537,5,B00GST8RJ8,I just finished watching Grace Unplugged and I really enjoyed this movie. It was a very good Christian theme and it portrayed a young woman's aspirations of becoming a recording artist. It was nice to finally watch a movie without profanity or violence.

6111550,2,B00GST8RJ8,"I am sorry, but I must have been out of the room when the term ""Christian"" was re-defined. To be a Christian is to be one who's been to the foot of the cross in the realization that one is a sinner and that nothing short of repentance of that sin and full and unequivocal surrender to the person of Jesus Christ will ever do in the life from that moment on. It means a life changed and forever after sold out to the Lord Jesus in everything. It means a great deal more than the few paltry statements of pure unadulterated lip service that are contained in this film.

Being a follower of Jesus is more than playing the latest contemporary music in a church worship team, it means being his, twenty four seven, in all that we do. Walking in ways that please Him not striving to have one's way because it satisfies the flesh. There is never any indication that the young lady in this film, or her father either, have got any more than a ""little religion"" which has made them somewhat different from those around them.

The new birth, regeneration, as specified by Jesus in John 3, and later in the NT in the book of Titus is a whole new way of life, because it's life that God has given not simply a new way of doing things. ""Christian"" films today are marginalizing what it means to be a child of the King. And it's so disappointing to see professing Christian brethren give them high marks simply because sex and bad language are being omitted. Our standards are being lowered each time a film of this genre makes its appearance.",1393372800,17,1529,4.3426573426573425

I pre-ordered it and plan to share it with all members of my family as well as my youth church group. This movie can provide a great discussion based on values as well as entertain.

The story line is weak.  I think it would have been more profound if it showed how to carry religion into the mainstream instead of bringing everyone back into a life that seems to be aligned only with the church.  I did enjoy the music.  Some very good songs.",1393286400,5,426,4.5394736842105265

6111570,5,B00GST8RJ8,"After I read the synopsis, I was dubious. It sounded like a well-worn storyline. Perhaps that's what gripped my husband and me so much. **Spoiler Warning:**  So many well-known actors and singers started out with a church background, perhaps even ""discovered"" at church (i. e. Whitney Huston, Jessica Simpson, Justin Bieber, just to name a few).  This movie showed the desires, dreams, and struggles of the wanna-be-turned-star. Though I didn't agree with Grace's rebellion or her dad's (sometimes) harshness, I understood both of them. I remember those same feelings of ""I'm not a kid anymore! Why do they still treat me like one?"" The incredible acting and directing added to this movie's relatability. Highly recommended.",1392854400,,724,5.28695652173913

6111580,4,B00GST8RJ8,Loved the story. Gracie's dad was convincing but I just don't understand  why Christian movies have such terrible acting.

Grace's voice is great but I was sorry Jamie Grace didn't have a part where she sang.,1392681600,,310,4.535714285714286

6111590,5,B00GST8RJ8,"The entertainment industry.  Fascinating to almost everyone nowadays, especially the young ones.  This movie is about letting go and trusting God.  He has a plan, and some times it's a bumpy road, but you just have to trust HIM.  This was fantastic, and I plan on having my children watch when they are a little older, I think 7 is a bit too young, 10 should be fine; there are some adult topics, but nothing too racy. It really shows how the industry manipulates people and molds them into what 'they' want them to be. It also teaches parents, that if you have done your job in introducing your child to God and the morals he wants us to uphold, God will shine through in the roughest of times for your kids.

Grace's struggle with God in this movie is relatable, she wants to 'shine' and be herself.  Her father wants to shield her from all the wrong he has already experienced and bottomed out in.  There comes a time in every young person's life when they want to be themselves, and not who anyone else wants them to be, but being yourself and being someone molded in the industry are different.  Being a mother, I can see how I would behave the way the father in this movie would, and it has given me insight into what might be a better method, and that having FAITH(not just saying you do) will help with your own sanity.  Sometimes it is better to let go, and be there to catch them if they fall.

I highly recommend this movie for older children and parents, as a family, it can really open up discussion. It gives a good perspective to children as well, letting them know that parents don't just want to cramp their style, they just don't want to see their children broken.",1392595200,2,1682,4.362179487179487
6111591,4,B00GST8RJ8,We all know the cliche Christian films and there's nothing wrong with that. What I love about this movie is that it resonates with ANYONE.  We all face this challenge in life.  Who/what are we chasing after?  Parent-child relationships can be complicated and this story touches upon this perfectly in a way that may still be hard to swallow.  God's grace is sufficient to see us through and we have to trust him with our lives and the lives of those we love.  I actually rented this and am on here to buy it so I can share it with my women's ministry.,1392595200,,551,4.310679611650485
6111592,5,B00GST8RJ8,This story represents the decisions teens go through and how important the parent child relationship is. It also shows how Hollywood and fame can destroy a persons life. It's not about the person. They become an object for gain.,1392595200,,228,4.871794871794871

6111597,2,B00GST8RJ8,"as the other reviewer said , I also wanted to like this movie, but I got 15 minutes in & found the conflict between parent & almost adult child to be what is always is. Yelling, going back & forth etc...A little too much generically, real to be entertaining. I parented teens,so been there, done that, don't need or want to revisit that ! I skipped ahead in the movie & the plot moved on predictably, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but what was presented wasn't very engaging. Also, Oddly, there was the same song, over, & over, OVER again throughout the movie...& not one sung by the girl, but by a guy...the story is about, Grace, so they should have had at least a girl singer, especially since the actress playing Grace DOES sing ! The bulk of the story was a depressing cautionary tale, but you know there's a happy ending. I'd like to see a story about people who make good choices for the right reasons because they have seen what the consequences are second hand. A redemptive story is nice, but this seemed mostly depressing until the end. It's a 'movie'...which to be entertaining benefits from a mix of happy, sad, cautionary & upbeat, maybe a little fun thrown in... Entertainment with a moral, please!",1392508800,2,1220,4.55

6111603,3,B00GST8RJ8,I really wanted to like this more than I did. It was just an okay movie for me. I am happy I rented it but it would not be a movie I would buy. Good message but a little on the boring side.,1392422400,,189,3.4186046511627906
6111604,5,B00GST8RJ8,"The age old battle of teenagers and parents is not very different in a Christian home unfortunately.  Even those in ministry don't have a ""magic formula"" to raise their children and with all the outside influences these days it is a battleground much of the time because neither side is willing to actually communicate.  I found the movie very real because without seeing any situation through the eyes of Christ, it is a battle of flesh and blood and that is a losing battle.  But as soon as one can distance themselves and honestly accept their role in the problem and deal with it, God can and will bring restoration.  I gave it a high rating because it is entertaining but I also believe it has a message for families that can bring healing.",1392422400,2,745,4.537313432835821

6111606,5,B00GST8RJ8,"My 2 daughters were really touched deeply by this movie.  This is a movie for every parent to watch with their young teens.  I think watching it at an earlier pre-teen age will have more effect on the tweens, then waiting too long.  Great movie!",1392422400,2,245,4.4
6111607,5,B00GST8RJ8,"We're in that period of transition with my oldest daughter, the struggle of letting her grow up and still wanting her to be my little girl. This was the perfect girls night movie for us, it encouraged my daughter in owning her own faith and stengthening her resolve to live for Christ and at the same time drawing her back to a relationship with me as good ole' mom which has been a little rocky with the influx of her making some of her own choices and me not wanting to let her make those choices. It has lots of things to talk about in regards to all the temptations and troubles that our kids are going to be faced with in this world. Delicately done in such a way that it is balanced and shows the world's side without being to overly wordly to the point that you're cringing at the exposure (trying to explain this is hard....I'm just thankful there wasn't an overload of immodesty, drunkedness and sex - they hit on these things enough to make it believable but yet discretely enough to not compromise our experience as viewers). This one will definately be going into our movie collection!",1392336000,4,1097,4.435643564356436

6111610,5,B00GST8RJ8,"This was a great film for parents to watch with their teens.  It shows the struggles that young adults have when they go off on their own and the temptations they face that are put in front of them every day. And for parents, it is a reminder that when kids leave home, they are out of our hands but they are in the hands of God and that He is ultimately in control.  Okay, as the mother of one who has left the nest and another who is getting ready to launch, maybe I was a little extra emotional.  I cried more than once during this movie, but they were ""good"" cries.  Great movie.",1392336000,13,583,4.043478260869565

6111620,5,B00GST8RJ8,"Mainstream movie reviewers give this movie weak reviews while they sing the praises of Hollywood standard fare involving profanity, sex, drugs, blood, violence, and general perversity. This is a quality movie with a great and heartening message in the midst of a fallen and lost world. Good music as well. Christian movies like this one get the expected poor treatment by the MSM for obvious reasons, but blessings come through persecution - that we know. We also know that when a movie gets this kind of criticism from the world that the movie's message must be right on target after all. Keep on keeping on. There's a great prize that awaits. I highly recommend this movie, and am thankful for it and others like it. Keep em coming.

I do want to add, though, that the only element I saw lacking in the movie came in the Christian characters frequently seeming to be shy in expressing and explaining their decisions and their faith to the non-believers in the movie. The dad, for instance, turning down the offer for a new recording deal without clearly explaining why to Mossy. Also, there were some missed opportunities to clarify for people the difference between religion and having a relationship with Jesus. Nonetheless the overall message of the movie was clearly expressed, and it is a very important one indeed. It still merits five stars in my view.",1391817600,,1361,4.816239316239316

I loved ""Grace Unplugged"" as it was a very good, wholesome Christian movie. It is inspiring and uplifting, and truly honors Christ.

UNFORTUNATELY, the movie ""Weepah Way for Now"" is truly from Satan. There is tons of foul language as well as sex. What truly disgusted me was when the two sisters were talking about AJ losing her virginity to a 33 year old man, and how cool that was as it was the age Christ was when crucified - I wanted to get sick!

I don't ever remember Hollywood types falling as badly as these two sisters. It's really sad!!!
