The ""actress"" is listed...but only as a Casting Director!  And the director has only one credit, too...as an actor--from The Wonderful Of World of Disney in 1969!

Man, this film flies so far under the radar it must have stunk so bad the culture police sent some Men In Black out to wipe out all traces of it's existence!",1311465600,,445,4.325301204819277
