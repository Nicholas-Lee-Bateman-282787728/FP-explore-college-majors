8683254,1,B00DUUC24E,"This is NOT a proshot dvd. It's a single camera video taken from back in the audience. Lots of shakiness, some blurry moments when the autofocus doesn't work as quickly as it should, and a plethora of arms and heads in the way.  You can see video just as good on Youtube (filmed, once again, by fans in the audience).

The sound is not as bad as the video, however, and if you put this on while you're busy with something else at least you can enjoy the songs. Not for any but the diehard completists. Avoid at all costs unless you must own every performance possible from Deep Purple.",1403395200,,585,4.3090909090909095
8683255,1,B00DUUC24E,"Rediculous rockumentary on what could have been a fantastic review of the classic album. Although In Rock is certainly a milestone, this version is just a money jerker. Nothing new, even if you've never seen anything from Deep Purple so far, this is way from interesting.
Silly comments and wild guesses of ""musicologists"" of how this album presumably got together, back-up by a Blackmore interview from 1974 (that was his opinion than, now he would probably tell a whole different story).
The footages used here are shown in every dvd available (the granada tapes). Although the cover tells you that all tracks from In Rock are featured actualy only 2 songs/tracks get attention: Speed king and Child in Time, the rest is not highlited or mentioned at all.
So don't get fooled by the cover nor it's contents, this is an absolute NO HAVE in anybodies collection. Don't buy!!
Just to illustrate the sadness: The producers even used a photo of Glenn Hughes  on the back (WTF)

Highly disappointing!",1389571200,,996,4.887573964497041
