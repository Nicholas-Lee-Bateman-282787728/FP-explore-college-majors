3058660,4,B001132GNE,"This is one of my daughter's favorite Wiggles DVDs. However, it is one of my least favorite :-) I'm not sure why I think this one is more annoying than the others (I honestly really like the other DVDs we have) - but the more we watch it the more I am getting used to it. One of the dancers wiggles his head all the time and gets on my nerves. Anyway, it is a great DVD for the kids. My daughter really does love it and requests to watch it and wants us to sing all the songs together. It is nice also that she learns all the traditional nursery rhyme songs.",1207353600,5,558,3.9469026548672566
3058661,4,B001132GNE,"Like any parent- I get exhausted by the Wiggles.  BUT this DVD is great.  It's rare anymore to see the classic childrens nursery rhymes in any form.
The production is great (if you like a lot of green screen... and by a lot- I mean that's all there is.)
This Wiggles DVD is by far the least annoying.",1207094400,,300,4.155172413793103
3058662,4,B001132GNE,"At first I was surprised The Wiggles sing old Nursery Rythmes rather than their own stuff.  I liked the fact that it's all music however Captain Feathersword sings way too much!  My 21 month old, Wiggles obsessed daughter was glued to the TV, mimicking the actions and laughing away.  Despite the fake background, this children's group seem to get it right for the kids.",1205366400,,370,4.75

The first new Dvd in some time form the Wiggles, the first song filled show with Sam Moran as Sam the Yellow Wiggle.  Getting Strong in our opinion was more a skit filled then song filled (still good!).  It's nice to see them rolling out the Dvd's again after a bit of a Wiggly lull.  This new Dvd, is a bunch of Nursery Rhymes from all over the world.  My son is 3 and still loves the Wiggles, we have all the Dvd and go to the shows when the are in the area.  I would recommend the Dvd if your kiddos enjoy the Fab 4 of Australia.  It is all songs/rhymes and not many skits.  I have already recommended this one to friends after just one viewing.",1205193600,9,833,5.036496350364963

3058666,5,B001132GNE,"My 3 year old loves the Wiggles, so I got him this as a gift. He's now four, and it's still one of his favorite videos. As an adult, I find myself preferring the later-period (mid-period?) Wiggles videos, like Pop Go the Wiggles and You Make Me Feel Like Dancing, to the earlier videos, which have more of a let's-film-a-stage-show feel. (We haven't seen any of the most recent videos to see how they've continued to evolve.) My 4yo likes the little comic interludes, like ""It's Raining, It's Pouring"". He gets excited by ""See-Saw Margery Daw"" and ""The Grand Old Duke of York"". I like the inclusion of more obscure songs, like ""English Country Garden."" My 7yo enjoys the video as well. It has a nice mix of energetic songs and more soothing songs, but everything is catchy.",1472342400,,773,4.608695652173913

3058681,3,B001132GNE,"Considered by some to be the Wiggles' ""White Album"" and according to them one of the most exhausting DVDs to film.

Thee opening scene of Murray's unhinged and passionate tour de force""Pop Go The Wiggles"" we see a drunk Murray, wearing nothing but a pair of tighty-whitey briefs, sitting in the lotus position and levitating four feet above the floor of his dressing room. It's not the last time we'll see Murray playing a fallen Hollywood star named  ironically enough
""Murray"" who is trying to make a comeback in an ambitious Broadway play, in his underwear. Murray becomes a ""viral sensation"" later in ""Pop Go The Wiggles"" -- more famous than at any time since his run as the star of the eponymous superhero franchise, two decades earlier - thanks to a nightmarish episode where he gets locked out of his own theater and must weave his way through the tourist-packed streets of Times Square similarly attired. It's also not the last time we'll see him defy the laws of physics, which the Wiggles sees (I'm afraid) as a metaphor for what artists do all the time, even those as conflicted and compromised as the Wiggles!",1423440000,,1121,4.714285714285714

3058685,3,B001132GNE,"We have about15 Wiggles DVDs. I was looking forward to having a DVD of nursery rhymes that my kids would recognize, but this fell a little short of being a DVD I would watch over and over again like some of the other Wiggles DVDs. Maybe the nursery rhymes they do in this DVD are more traditional to an Australian child as I thought of how many other cool nursery rhymes they could have done that would have held my kids attention better. I am not a fan of the green screen backgrounds either or the saving of money to clone certain characters in songs. I catch that as an adult, but I guess most kids wont. I think the props and simple backgrounds of some of the first Wiggles DVD's catch my children's attention so much better. As we have watched this over the last few months, this DVD has grown on me, but it is not what I wanted it to be and my 17 month old kids don't usually pick this video out first. It's rated at a three star because some of the songs are kind of boring- but hey! It's the Wiggles so it can never be THAT bad!",1401148800,,1036,4.083333333333333
3058686,5,B001132GNE,"This is one fantastic DVD! My son asked for this one time after time. He happily sang and danced his whole way through.

3058689,5,B001132GNE,"Let me start by saying that we love Wiggles generally, but this particular DVD is our go-to.  Unlike some other Wiggles movies which seem to be made for older children, this will keep your infant/toddler's attention.  It's quick paced (the DVD cover says there are 41 rhymes and songs), moving through lullabies and nursery rhymes in a light-hearted and engaging way.

Here are most of the songs/rhymes on the DVD:

This Old Man
Pop Goes the Weasel
Hickory Dickory Dock
English Country Garden
Round the Garden Like a Teddy Bear
Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush
Pussycat, Pussycat
Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear Turn Around
Mary Had a Little Lamb
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
Skip to my Lou
Three Little Kittens
Lemons and Oranges
Hey Diddle Diddle
Frere Jaques
Two Fine Gentlemen
There Was a Princess
Incy Wincy Spider
It's Raining, It's Pouring
The Grand Old Duke of York
Diddle Diddle Dumpling
Little Miss Muffet
The Farmer in the Dell
Jack and Jill
Lavenders Blue
Little Bo Peep
Did you Ever See a Lassie?
London Bridge Is Falling Down
Pat a Cake
Dry Bones

One nice feature of the Wiggles movies we own, including this one, is the Jukebox feature, so you can choose a specific song and watch it as many times as your child desires, without having to search for it using fast-forward and rewind features.

Another feature is ""Play in ASL"" which we just started doing.  My daughter has been signing since 9 months (now 29 months), so she enjoyed it.  All in all, great value.",1392163200,,1470,4.648648648648648

3058698,4,B001132GNE,"Pop Go the Wiggles, is not as good as ""Wiggly Safari"" or ""Big Red Boat"".  But it is a good addition to your Wiggles library.  It is a conglomeration of many of the Wiggle hits.",1358726400,,176,4.0

3058701,5,B001132GNE,My 17 month old son insists on this DVD being played over and over. He has started to imitate the Wiggles by playing nick nack on his shoe. He is absolutely mesmerized by all of the scenes without Dorothy the Dinosaur (which is most of them).,1346889600,,242,4.282608695652174
3058702,5,B001132GNE,"My 5 yr old and 2 yr old daughters both love the Wiggles.  The catchy songs and creative skits have them requesting the DVD often.  I bought this to leave at Grandma's house and they can't wait to watch it when they visit.  My 2 yr old, who has a speech delay, loves to sing along with the Wiggles and has learned songs from this video that I had never heard of.  It's a great video with Sam, whom we love for his beautiful voice.  I highly recommend.",1343779200,,451,4.079545454545454
3058703,5,B001132GNE,I bought this video for my niece because she ended up watching the previews of Pop Goes the Wiggles on her other Wiggles DVD more than anything. She loves to dance along and I have a fun time watching her because she is entertaining. I really enjoyed buying this DVD for her and I know she loves to watch it as well...she plays it non-stop for days at a time!,1341446400,,359,4.142857142857143

3058705,5,B001132GNE,My three year old son loves it. He was a little bit of a Wiggles fan but now we watch it almost everyday. Lots of songs that keep him dancing along with them. Perfect for kids. Nursery rhymes and Wiggles = win win.,1333065600,,214,4.0
3058706,1,B001132GNE,My 15 month old loves the wiggles! anything wiggles. when he received this DVD he saw the pic and was super excited. But when i started the DVD it was a whole different story. The picture was very faded and he just didn't care much for it. We took it out and haven't gone back to it since.,1325980800,,289,4.0
3058707,4,B001132GNE,"We bought this DVD after listening to the audio CD of ""Pop Go The Wiggles."" I like that it has many classic nursery rhymes and songs that have been around for ages. We own two other Wiggles DVDs (Big Red Car and Yummy Yummy), which are both fine, but none of the songs from those two DVDs are going to be found in other music collections. I'd like my children to be familiar with the older nursery rhymes and songs, even though they seem to be fading out of today's society.

The Wiggles act out each song with fun characters and costumes. I like how enthusiastic they are when singing, while seeming sincere- not overly dramatic. I wouldn't consider their portrayal to be ""cheesy,"" but more like they are encouraging their audience to have fun and dance along. After listening to the CD so many times in the car, my kids got a real kick out of seeing the songs acted on on the TV. My one-year-old and three-year-old enjoy this DVD very much!",1323734400,4,942,4.413793103448276
3058708,5,B001132GNE,"This was for my granddaughter. We watched it over & over again for days. I find their music is going around in my head daily. This is just one of 7 of their dvd's I've purchased. They are very endearing!! I highly recommend ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"", also.",1312761600,,262,4.26
3058709,5,B001132GNE,"First, I just want to say that I was nervous about Greg being replaced by Sam, but have long since decided that I love them both.  (Yes, I do love The Wiggles!)

This DVD is fabulous.  I love ""This Old Man"" and Captain Feathersword as a jack-in-the-box for ""Pop Goes the Weasel.""  I probably love the whole DVD.

But I wanted to give The Wiggles kudos for the option of watching the video with an ASL interpreter.  For young deaf children who are too young to read, or for parents who want their children exposed to ASL for whatever reason, this is a fantastic option.  (If you want exposure, ""Signing Time"" is an excellent option).  My children are not deaf, though I am.  We have watched the ASL track several times, and the interpreter did a FABULOUS job of interpreting these songs, some of which I consider to be difficult to translate properly in ASL.  The only sign I didn't recognize was ""skip"" but I'm wondering if it could be an Australian sign.  What a joy!

We have and have watched many Wiggles DVD's.  The only one I don't really love is Space Dancing, but then, it is the favorite of my older kids.

If you're afraid of joining the Wiggles bandwagon, please don't be.  My three-year-old rarely wants to watch anything else, and they really are a gem.  All five of them, counting Greg!",1297382400,2,1299,4.463829787234043

And then, you have ""There Was A Princess""; Sam sings that song so well, and not only that, but he acts it out very well.  Oh, and also, that cute little smile in ""Three Little Kittens"" while Caterina sings, I just burst out laughing and am awed by it as well. :)

Sam is not the only good thing on here!  Captain is hilarious and Anthony is as well!!!  A++++++++++ for this wonderful Wiggles video!!",1294963200,2,561,4.226415094339623

She watches it almost everyday and for her it is really entertaining, everytime is like the first time and she dances with the songs.  The nursery rhymes are well presented, with colouful yet simple and realistic images.

3058714,5,B001132GNE,"My 2 yr old granddaughter loves this DVD as well as her others. I highly recommend this one especially because of the Nursery rhymes and a very lovely lullabye by Sam called
""Chi-Baba ChiBaba.""  Sam has the perfect voice for this song. Never heard it before and now I
can't get enough of that one song alone.
 I am so glad Sam was picked to join this group. He is a welcome addition.

Parents, as I mentioned with the other Wiggles nursery rhyme DVD entitled Sing a Song of Wiggles, if you and your child are fans of the Wiggles, then this is another one to add to the collection. The Wiggles sing, dance and perform over 20 great nursery rhymes in the usual Wiggles fashion that will keep your little one entertained and even if necessary soothe him/her to sleep. Songs include..

The Farmer in the Dell
Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear
Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star
Hey Diddle Diddle

My daughter loves it, and I really liked that it taught her some common (and some not so common) nursery rhymes that she might run into down the road. NOW, however, I'm a little miffed. The new television shows that just started airing a couple months back integrate all of the exact skits/songs from this video. As a result, the tv shows now bore the heck out of my daughter, who has watched the video a million times, and now misses the old dancing based skits she used to have fun with (Hot Potato, Do the Monkey, etc.) Perhaps I'm more let down by the changes in the television show than by this video on its own, but still, don't buy it if you're looking for something different from what's currently on television, or if you're wanting songs your toddler can learn the moves to.",1231113600,,839,4.384615384615385

3058722,5,B001132GNE,"We purchased this because it seemed to be the ""latest"" release of the Wiggles.  It is all nursery rhymes, which is cute, but tends to be less energetic than ""Wiggly Dancing"" or some of the other popular DVDs/CDs.  I enjoyed hearing nursery rhymes that I hadn't heard since I was a child.  My daughter's interest wasn't held as well as some of the other DVDs since it was less interactive.  The characters looked more like they were posing/acting out pages in a nursery rhyme book than performing or dancing.  The dancing just wasn't as energetic as DVDs in the past.",1217548800,,566,4.62
3058723,2,B001132GNE,"We love the Wiggles--me, my 3 year old son, and my 12 month old son too. Both my sons groove and dance to the Wiggles every time I put their music on. This video, however, was disappointing. It is a collection of nursery rhymes, which I knew before I bought the video, but I expected the songs to be Wiggle-ified, meaning, I thought these classic songs would be jazzed up and choreographed in their unique Wiggly way. However, these songs put us to sleep! Most are so slow! I don't know why they chose to slow down the tempo so much. My kids sit through the video but their eyes glaze over. I get bored too. There are lots of interesting costume changes, but costumes aren't what my kids care for. They like the upbeat get-up-and-dance music with simple, understandable themes and easy motions they can follow. This video does not provide that.

The only times my 3 year old grins and laughs is when Captain Feathersword pops out of the jack-in-the-box.

And I agree with a previous poster that Sam's voice is more musical theater. A great voice but not very Wiggly...I think his almost operatic voice was less approachable for my kids and harder for them to connect with. This video made us miss Greg!

Aside from the music, the video is well made. And I was glad to see that the other 3 Wiggles still have their energy and enthusiasm.

Update 8/5: We just went to the Pop Goes the Wiggles Live concert and it was FANTASTIC. If anyone is reading reviews here because they are anticipating going to the concert, then you should know that although this video isn't that upbeat and danceable, the concert IS. My 3 year old son wore himself out jumping up and down and dancing like crazy. Sam has an awesome voice and I was able to appreciate it more live than on video. I was very impressed with him and the whole concert. Sam is now my son's favorite Wiggle!",1217116800,5,1857,4.452941176470588
3058724,5,B001132GNE,"I will unashamedly say I love this DVD. My son is just now at the age where he really enjoys singing, and the fact that he can watch the Wiggles performing fun and gently catchy versions of the songs he's learning at daycare have made this his new favorite as well. He loves trying out the actions and singing along with the characters on the TV, and it's a joy to watch him enjoying himself so much.

I've read a complaint about the greenscreen backgrounds, but I don't have a problem with them, and neither does my son, which is far more important. The one sad thing is that Greg is not longer part of the Wiggles, but I have to say that Sam was an excellent choice to take his place. Sam's voice is lovely, and he's just as sweet and lively as the other, original Wiggles. And even better is that Dorothy, Wags, Henry and (my favorite) Captain Feathersword are there as well, all taking part in the action. The costumes are great, and it was a treat seeing all the Wiggles performing on instruments.

This DVD is, in short, a fantastic way to help your child learn the canon rhymes and songs of childhood. I can't recommend it highly enough.",1216512000,,1144,4.366197183098592
3058725,4,B001132GNE,"It's nice to see Sam in a video now (my son has been waiting for some videos with Sam in them!).  These nursery rhymes are catchy songs I must say...maybe a little too catchy (we hear them all day after watching it once!), but my boys love it.",1215993600,,243,4.0625

3058727,5,B001132GNE,"My daughter is 14 months and likes the music of the Wiggles more than the skits.  Pop Goes the Wiggles was a bigger hit than Getting Strong.  Everyone gets to sing and it's nice.  Yes, Sam is different than Greg but he's still likeable.  I think I liked him better as Dapper Dave, but what are you going to do?  I also liked the selection of nursery rhymes that they had.  There were a bunch of songs that I remembered from childhood.  I do hope that the Wiggles will come out with some new DVDs and CDs with new songs that are easy to dance to as my daughter gets older.",1210377600,,571,4.09009009009009
3058728,3,B001132GNE,"My toddler son is a big Wiggles fan, as am I. I was so sad to see Greg leave but determined to give the new guy (Sam) a chance. Greg was such a presence and has such a pleasant, gentle-seeming way about him, combined with that amazing voice, I figured it must be a really tough role to fill for Sam. Sat down and watched this video through. Well, I did anyhow. My 2 year old was bored and gone from the tv after about 10 minutes.

  This video is a LOT different than earlier ones. It's a lot slower overall and has almost a sleepy feel to it in parts. My son likes the songs that have dances he can learn and do the motions to (like Hot Potato, Rock-a-bye your bear, Can you point your fingers and do the twist, etc). There aren't any of those on this. I realize it's nursery rhymes etc and not their own stuff, but still, there is nothing to draw him in and involve him.

  Sam has a good voice - but if you're a big fan of Greg's voice, you'll find it a whole lot different. Greg's voice is smooth as silk, low, relaxing (almost hypnotic sometimes - wish he'd do a lullaby cd!), while Sam's is more a tenor and very musical theater sounding.  Sam seemed to me to be ill-at-ease and not at all comfortable with being silly and goofy - his attempts at it seemed put on and, in places, like he was trying way too hard and coming off like he was overacting. I hope that as he gets used to his role that some chemistry shows between the other 3 guys and him - there didn't seem to be any.  Perhaps it's just growing pains and getting used to trying to fill some very big shoes.

  Overall, this is not a DVD we'll watch very much at all. However, there is one fantastic thing on it. One of the bonus features is the ability to watch it with an interpreter doing American Sign Language in the bottom right corner. No one in my house is deaf, but I used to teach sign language so after my son was through watching, I wanted to see the interpreter. He is AMAZING - not only signs beautifully (of course!), but is super expressive, has just the right amount of Wiggle-silliness/goofiness, and seems like he's having a great time. He's a real joy to watch! Wish Sam came off a bit more like that - this DVD would've been far better, in my opinion.

  Here's hoping that they go back to the catchy tunes and simple repetitive ""dances"" that the little ones can learn and join in. (But please keep the interpreter - he's great!)",1209686400,10,2418,4.172043010752688
3058729,4,B001132GNE,A change of pace for the wiggles.  Lots more singing from members other than Sam.  Kids still love it though.,1209427200,,109,4.4
3058730,5,B001132GNE,"My 2 1/2-year-old-twins absolutely love this video. They're huge Wiggles fans, but aren't old enough to notice Greg's absence; while I certainly liked Greg very much, I think Sam is a wonderful addition to the group. His voice is smooth, he has a good range, and he is very expressive--the girls love to watch him.

Probably the best thing about this DVD is its variety: there are few skits, and the DVD moves along at a good pace. This holds the girls' attention, and makes it less tiresome when hearing it for the umpteenth time. I also like that all of the Wiggles and Captain Feathersword seem to do a bit more soloing on this DVD--it adds to the fun. Plus it has replenished my repertoire of nursery rhymes: my kids haven't yet tired of ""Sing a Song of Sixpence"" or ""Mairzy Doats,"" but I was getting a little tired of singing them all the time!",1209254400,,849,4.4423076923076925

I wanted to get her this one since Greg was replaced by Sam and I didn't want her to be disappointed when she went to their concert and didn't see Greg.  She doesn't seem to like this dvd (I think she's gotten too used to Greg).  My husband and I prefer Greg over Sam especially with the singing too.  Sam seems to be lip synching in some of the songs on the dvd.  I guess we just need to get used to the new guy!,1207699200,2,514,3.857142857142857
3058732,4,B001132GNE,My toddler is a Wiggles fanatic. He has a collection of 22 DVDs. I knew from the description this one was going to be different. With Sam replacing Greg I knew there weren't going to be the same songs that my son loves but new ones for him to fall in love with. He got excited over the different costumes as Wiggles became nursery rhyme characters. This Wiggles DVD is a great combination of Wiggles energy & old classics.

One of the dancers wiggles his head all the time and gets on my nerves. Anyway, it is a great DVD for the kids. My daughter really does love it and requests to watch it and wants us to sing all the songs together.

This new Dvd, is a bunch of Nursery Rhymes from all over the world.  My son is 3 and still loves the Wiggles, we have all the Dvd and go to the shows when the are in the area.

Wiggles videos, like Pop Go the Wiggles and You Make Me Feel Like Dancing, to the earlier videos, which have more of a let's-film-a-stage-show feel. (We haven't seen any of the most recent videos to see how they've continued to evolve.) My 4yo likes the little comic interludes, like ""It's Raining, It's Pouring"". He gets excited by ""See-Saw Margery Daw"" and ""The Grand Old Duke of York"". I like the inclusion of more obscure songs, like ""English Country Garden."" My 7yo enjoys the video as well.

Thee opening scene of Murray's unhinged and passionate tour de force""Pop Go The Wiggles"" we see a drunk Murray, wearing nothing but a pair of tighty-whitey briefs, sitting in the lotus position and levitating four feet above the floor of his dressing room. It's not the last time we'll see Murray playing a fallen Hollywood star named  ironically enough
""Murray"" who is trying to make a comeback in an ambitious Broadway play, in his underwear. Murray becomes a ""viral sensation"" later in ""Pop Go The Wiggles"" -- more famous than at any time since his run as the star of the eponymous superhero franchise, two decades earlier - thanks to a nightmarish episode where he gets locked out of his own theater and must weave his way through the tourist-packed streets of Times Square similarly attired. It's also not the last time we'll see him defy the laws of physics, which the Wiggles sees (I'm afraid) as a metaphor for what artists do all the time, even those as conflicted and compromised as the Wiggles!",1423440000,,1121,4.714285714285714

I was looking forward to having a DVD of nursery rhymes that my kids would recognize, but this fell a little short of being a DVD I would watch over and over again like some of the other Wiggles DVDs. Maybe the nursery rhymes they do in this DVD are more traditional to an Australian child as I thought of how many other cool nursery rhymes they could have done that would have held my kids attention better. I am not a fan of the green screen backgrounds either or the saving of money to clone certain characters in songs. I catch that as an adult, but I guess most kids wont. I think the props and simple backgrounds of some of the first Wiggles DVD's catch my children's attention so much better. As we have watched this over the last few months, this DVD has grown on me, but it is not what I wanted it to be and my 17 month old kids don't usually pick this video out first.

Unlike some other Wiggles movies which seem to be made for older children, this will keep your infant/toddler's attention.

This Old Man
Pop Goes the Weasel
Hickory Dickory Dock
English Country Garden
Round the Garden Like a Teddy Bear
Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush

Mary Had a Little Lamb
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

Little Miss Muffet
The Farmer in the Dell
Jack and Jill
Lavenders Blue
Little Bo Peep
Did you Ever See a Lassie?
London Bridge Is Falling Down
Pat a Cake
Dry Bones

I'd like my children to be familiar with the older nursery rhymes and songs, even though they seem to be fading out of today's society.

The Wiggles act out each song with fun characters and costumes. I like how enthusiastic they are when singing, while seeming sincere- not overly dramatic. I wouldn't consider their portrayal to be ""cheesy,"" but more like they are encouraging their audience to have fun and dance along. After listening to the CD so many times in the car, my kids got a real kick out of seeing the songs acted on on the TV. My one-year-old and three-year-old enjoy this DVD very much!",1323734400,4,942,4.413793103448276

This is just one of 7 of their dvd's I've purchased. They are very endearing!! I highly recommend ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"", also.",1312761600,,262,4.26
3293206,5,B001132GNE,"First, I just want to say that I was nervous about Greg being replaced by Sam, but have long since decided that I love them both.  (Yes, I do love The Wiggles!)

This DVD is fabulous.  I love ""This Old Man"" and Captain Feathersword as a jack-in-the-box for ""Pop Goes the Weasel.""  I probably love the whole DVD.

But I wanted to give The Wiggles kudos for the option of watching the video with an ASL interpreter.  For young deaf children who are too young to read, or for parents who want their children exposed to ASL for whatever reason, this is a fantastic option.  (If you want exposure, ""Signing Time"" is an excellent option).  My children are not deaf, though I am.  We have watched the ASL track several times, and the interpreter did a FABULOUS job of interpreting these songs, some of which I consider to be difficult to translate properly in ASL.  The only sign I didn't recognize was ""skip"" but I'm wondering if it could be an Australian sign.  What a joy!

We have and have watched many Wiggles DVD's.  The only one I don't really love is Space Dancing, but then, it is the favorite of my older kids.

If you're afraid of joining the Wiggles bandwagon, please don't be.  My three-year-old rarely wants to watch anything else, and they really are a gem.  All five of them, counting Greg!",1297382400,2,1299,4.463829787234043

And then, you have ""There Was A Princess""; Sam sings that song so well, and not only that, but he acts it out very well.  Oh, and also, that cute little smile in ""Three Little Kittens"" while Caterina sings, I just burst out laughing and am awed by it as well. :)

Songs include..

The Farmer in the Dell
Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear
Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star
Hey Diddle Diddle
English Country Garden (sung beautifully by Dorothy and yes surprisingly the Captain..lol)
There was a Princess (nicely sung and acted out by Sam and his wife Lynn Moran and the other Wiggles)

My daughter loves it, and I really liked that it taught her some common (and some not so common) nursery rhymes that she might run into down the road. NOW, however, I'm a little miffed. The new television shows that just started airing a couple months back integrate all of the exact skits/songs from this video. As a result, the tv shows now bore the heck out of my daughter, who has watched the video a million times, and now misses the old dancing based skits she used to have fun with (Hot Potato, Do the Monkey, etc.) Perhaps I'm more let down by the changes in the television show than by this video on its own, but still, don't buy it if you're looking for something different from what's currently on television, or if you're wanting songs your toddler can learn the moves to.",1231113600,,839,4.384615384615385

3293219,5,B001132GNE,"We purchased this because it seemed to be the ""latest"" release of the Wiggles.  It is all nursery rhymes, which is cute, but tends to be less energetic than ""Wiggly Dancing"" or some of the other popular DVDs/CDs.  I enjoyed hearing nursery rhymes that I hadn't heard since I was a child.  My daughter's interest wasn't held as well as some of the other DVDs since it was less interactive.  The characters looked more like they were posing/acting out pages in a nursery rhyme book than performing or dancing.  The dancing just wasn't as energetic as DVDs in the past.",1217548800,,566,4.62
3293220,2,B001132GNE,"We love the Wiggles--me, my 3 year old son, and my 12 month old son too. Both my sons groove and dance to the Wiggles every time I put their music on. This video, however, was disappointing. It is a collection of nursery rhymes, which I knew before I bought the video, but I expected the songs to be Wiggle-ified, meaning, I thought these classic songs would be jazzed up and choreographed in their unique Wiggly way. However, these songs put us to sleep! Most are so slow! I don't know why they chose to slow down the tempo so much. My kids sit through the video but their eyes glaze over. I get bored too. There are lots of interesting costume changes, but costumes aren't what my kids care for. They like the upbeat get-up-and-dance music with simple, understandable themes and easy motions they can follow. This video does not provide that.

The only times my 3 year old grins and laughs is when Captain Feathersword pops out of the jack-in-the-box.

And I agree with a previous poster that Sam's voice is more musical theater. A great voice but not very Wiggly...I think his almost operatic voice was less approachable for my kids and harder for them to connect with. This video made us miss Greg!

Aside from the music, the video is well made. And I was glad to see that the other 3 Wiggles still have their energy and enthusiasm.

Update 8/5: We just went to the Pop Goes the Wiggles Live concert and it was FANTASTIC. If anyone is reading reviews here because they are anticipating going to the concert, then you should know that although this video isn't that upbeat and danceable, the concert IS. My 3 year old son wore himself out jumping up and down and dancing like crazy. Sam has an awesome voice and I was able to appreciate it more live than on video. I was very impressed with him and the whole concert. Sam is now my son's favorite Wiggle!",1217116800,5,1857,4.452941176470588
3293221,5,B001132GNE,"I will unashamedly say I love this DVD. My son is just now at the age where he really enjoys singing, and the fact that he can watch the Wiggles performing fun and gently catchy versions of the songs he's learning at daycare have made this his new favorite as well. He loves trying out the actions and singing along with the characters on the TV, and it's a joy to watch him enjoying himself so much.

I've read a complaint about the greenscreen backgrounds, but I don't have a problem with them, and neither does my son, which is far more important. The one sad thing is that Greg is not longer part of the Wiggles, but I have to say that Sam was an excellent choice to take his place. Sam's voice is lovely, and he's just as sweet and lively as the other, original Wiggles. And even better is that Dorothy, Wags, Henry and (my favorite) Captain Feathersword are there as well, all taking part in the action. The costumes are great, and it was a treat seeing all the Wiggles performing on instruments.

This DVD is, in short, a fantastic way to help your child learn the canon rhymes and songs of childhood. I can't recommend it highly enough.",1216512000,,1144,4.366197183098592

3293224,5,B001132GNE,"My daughter is 14 months and likes the music of the Wiggles more than the skits.  Pop Goes the Wiggles was a bigger hit than Getting Strong.  Everyone gets to sing and it's nice.  Yes, Sam is different than Greg but he's still likeable.  I think I liked him better as Dapper Dave, but what are you going to do?  I also liked the selection of nursery rhymes that they had.  There were a bunch of songs that I remembered from childhood.  I do hope that the Wiggles will come out with some new DVDs and CDs with new songs that are easy to dance to as my daughter gets older.",1210377600,,571,4.09009009009009
3293225,3,B001132GNE,"My toddler son is a big Wiggles fan, as am I. I was so sad to see Greg leave but determined to give the new guy (Sam) a chance. Greg was such a presence and has such a pleasant, gentle-seeming way about him, combined with that amazing voice, I figured it must be a really tough role to fill for Sam. Sat down and watched this video through. Well, I did anyhow. My 2 year old was bored and gone from the tv after about 10 minutes.

  This video is a LOT different than earlier ones. It's a lot slower overall and has almost a sleepy feel to it in parts. My son likes the songs that have dances he can learn and do the motions to (like Hot Potato, Rock-a-bye your bear, Can you point your fingers and do the twist, etc). There aren't any of those on this. I realize it's nursery rhymes etc and not their own stuff, but still, there is nothing to draw him in and involve him.

  Sam has a good voice - but if you're a big fan of Greg's voice, you'll find it a whole lot different. Greg's voice is smooth as silk, low, relaxing (almost hypnotic sometimes - wish he'd do a lullaby cd!), while Sam's is more a tenor and very musical theater sounding.  Sam seemed to me to be ill-at-ease and not at all comfortable with being silly and goofy - his attempts at it seemed put on and, in places, like he was trying way too hard and coming off like he was overacting. I hope that as he gets used to his role that some chemistry shows between the other 3 guys and him - there didn't seem to be any.  Perhaps it's just growing pains and getting used to trying to fill some very big shoes.

  Overall, this is not a DVD we'll watch very much at all. However, there is one fantastic thing on it. One of the bonus features is the ability to watch it with an interpreter doing American Sign Language in the bottom right corner. No one in my house is deaf, but I used to teach sign language so after my son was through watching, I wanted to see the interpreter. He is AMAZING - not only signs beautifully (of course!), but is super expressive, has just the right amount of Wiggle-silliness/goofiness, and seems like he's having a great time. He's a real joy to watch! Wish Sam came off a bit more like that - this DVD would've been far better, in my opinion.

  Here's hoping that they go back to the catchy tunes and simple repetitive ""dances"" that the little ones can learn and join in. (But please keep the interpreter - he's great!)",1209686400,10,2418,4.172043010752688

3293227,5,B001132GNE,"My 2 1/2-year-old-twins absolutely love this video. They're huge Wiggles fans, but aren't old enough to notice Greg's absence; while I certainly liked Greg very much, I think Sam is a wonderful addition to the group. His voice is smooth, he has a good range, and he is very expressive--the girls love to watch him.

Probably the best thing about this DVD is its variety: there are few skits, and the DVD moves along at a good pace. This holds the girls' attention, and makes it less tiresome when hearing it for the umpteenth time. I also like that all of the Wiggles and Captain Feathersword seem to do a bit more soloing on this DVD--it adds to the fun. Plus it has replenished my repertoire of nursery rhymes: my kids haven't yet tired of ""Sing a Song of Sixpence"" or ""Mairzy Doats,"" but I was getting a little tired of singing them all the time!",1209254400,,849,4.4423076923076925

She doesn't seem to like this dvd (I think she's gotten too used to Greg).  My husband and I prefer Greg over Sam especially with the singing too.  Sam seems to be lip synching in some of the songs on the dvd.  I guess we just need to get used to the new guy!,1207699200,2,514,3.857142857142857
