8412821,5,B0041KA082,"There is no American sitcom as good as this one and there probably never will be. Lipman is versatile, deadpan, angry, yearning, passionate, bemused, and brilliant. The script is sparkling and utterly non-PC: when two men are fighting over Lipman's character she says, ""Go ahead, rip me in two""; her husband responds, ""With my luck, I'll get the half that talks."" I happened to be in Britain when this ran on the BBC, about the same time as ""The Glittering Prizes,"" another series that's too good for American TV. It's an enormous shame there's no version of ""Agony"" for Americans.",1301097600,,581,4.82
8412822,5,B0041KA082,"Maureen Lipman is a genius actor.  Not only on stage, when I went to London specifically to see her in Wonderful Town, but on TV and film also.
Agony is my favorite sit-com.  She is my favorite actress. Despite the length of time since I last saw this series, I remember it as being so sharp & clever that everyone loved its portayal of typical people.",1300147200,,352,4.318181818181818
8412823,4,B0041KA082,"I remember watching this series when it was on WTTW in Chicago, years back - it is a show that runs a wide range of genres seemingly starting out as a comedy and taking a very sudden, and tragic, left-turn near the end of the series with a second strange turn at the very end that leaves you thinking (and, probably smiling a bit).  The writing is delightful.  Each episode is peppered with witty banter and several world class jokes (the one about dating an East Indian woman comes to mind, right off the bat) as well as addressing human foibles of all kinds, infidelity and intolerance of non-mainstream sexual orientation.

I look forward to when this will be available in US format.",1291420800,,686,4.560975609756097
