347604,5,6301702123,"This movie has got to be one of my all time favorites, Ellen Greene has a superb singing voice that totally rocks the house. And even though it is a satire, it moves me toward the Christian walk more than a Sunday School Preacher ever will. A movie of good things that can really happen, praise, faith, and human mistakes. This movie brought tears to my eyes when Sister Ruth (Ellen Greene), first got the spirit in her. This movie contains drugs, sex, and rock and roll. All the elements that preachers preach against. But it seems to get the message across that we are all sinners, and have to find our beliefs in our own way that will make sense to us. Richard Thomas and James Whitmore also make this a great movie. Just a little corny in the ending, but music and theme just makes you feel good inside.",1050710400,18,807,4.3509933774834435

7814306,5,6301702123,"I think is a great one !  It is a shame it isn't on DVD.  Here's the other problem.  You can find it for free in two parts on a certain site.  The total run time there is about 190 minutes.  Apparently the VHS version has 30 to 50 minutes edited OUT.  I thoughts some scenes were missing when I finally watched the VHS,  and the online version confirms that.  It's a much more cohesive story and ties up some loose ends with the additional footage.  My five stars are for the longer uncut version.",1451001600,,497,4.147368421052631

7814308,5,6301702123,"This was an HBO two-part series that was shocking and interesting at the same time.  It focused on religion, the behind the scenes goings on, sin, and anything else you can name.  Loved it.  My husband and I laughed at all the taboos that were introduced into this series.",1390262400,,272,4.510204081632653

7814310,5,6301702123,"First, I give it 5 stars because that's the ""I Love it"" ranking.  Although, on a REAL 5 star rating, I'd give it 4 if I was being objective.  That said, Ellen Greene is just a marvel to watch; especially when you compare and contrast with her performance in Little Shop of Horrors.  James Whitmore is, as always, just amazing to watch as well and shows that he was one of the most under-appreciated talents of his generation (Watch his ""Give 'em Hell Harry"" one man show about Truman).  What made this great was not only a believable story line (OK, somewhat), but the execution and the inter-dynamics between the characters.  AND, the ending is a bit misunderstood.  Some of what you see it isn't really happening.  It is a representation and depiction of their own salvation.  But just for the sheer joy of a fun, and yes, thought-provoking movie, this movie will keep your attention and make you want to buy the soundtrack (which is not available either!).",1310256000,2,959,4.633136094674557

7814312,5,6301702123,"""Sex, Drugs, Rock 'n' roll... they've always worked for me"" says Ellen Greene, in a knockout performance as a club singer turned televangelist. Richard Thomas is struggling to follow in Daddy's footsteps, and his TV church is failing...until he sees Ellen, and recruits her to the cause. His trusted aide Lester (James Whitmore, who won an ACE for this one) helps keep her in line...sort of. Lester's so good, he deserved his own movie.  This is funnier now than when it was made; they'd had televangelist scandals then, but we've got Senators denouncing the ""persecution of Christians"" here and now... The connections between religion and politics do not escape Lindsay Anderson's notice. Just brilliant.",1122768000,7,705,5.184210526315789
