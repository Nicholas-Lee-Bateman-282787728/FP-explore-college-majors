it is horribly directed, the instructor talks and points to things you can not see, then they show nice diagram
with the instructor still talking but no any pointings on the diagram, because he is pointing with his laser on the
wall which we can not see.
next the material is presented with high elegance of physics language like symmetry and contraction, expansion.
but sorry i found it terribly boring and no good explanations, i really couldn't watch more than 10 minutes and decided to return the DVD to the great Amazon.

there may be some thing about this technical analysis methods but at least it is prestented in a terrible way.
i wouldn't buy this product for free.",1288656000,4,765,4.625
8359694,1,B002AL9WVU,"The video was a presentation that was taped at a seminar.  I was looking for a detailed educational video.  Yet, this was watered-down video and was not detailed to where you can specifically identify the Seven setups. The presenter identified points on a few stock charts and called them the seven setups. One of the prerequistes should be to have a background in stock chart reading.",1278288000,2,385,4.818181818181818
