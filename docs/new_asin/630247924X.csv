There is a horrible dancing dream sequence.  Bad movie, not worth buying.  No wonder that it is hard to find.",1168214400,5,287,4.339622641509434
7826160,5,630247924X,"If you like light romantic musicals, then you'll get a kick out of this movie.  The cast includes Anna Neagle, Richard Carlson, Roland Young, Victor Mature and Eve Arden.  Very fun, entertaining movie about a young woman, Nannette (Neagle) who keeps getting her well-meaning uncle (Young) out of jams.  Neagle gives an adorable performance as Nannette while the handsome Richard Carlson holds his own as artist Tom Guillespi, her love interest.  Eve Arden, though only  appearing in a few scenes, is hilarious as the serious aspiring artist.
Songs include ""Tea for Two"" and ""I want to be happy.""",1057363200,11,595,5.030612244897959
