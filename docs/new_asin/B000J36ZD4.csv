8395707,5,B000J36ZD4,"A great movie, it's a shame its too difficult to get. Hopefully on Blu-Ray or HD-DVD soon.",1202947200,3,90,4.352941176470588
8395708,5,B000J36ZD4,"""Kamchatka"", directed by Marcelo Pieyro, is an Argentinian movie that delves on a very sad event of Argentina's history. That event, the 1976 military coup, led to a cruel dictatorship and a ""dirty war"" against citizens that tended towards the political left.

I would like to highlight the fact that Pieyro doesn't show the spectator everything that happened after that year, but rather its effects on a family that has to hide from the new government. Strangely enough, this treatment of the subject is very effective, as the story of ""Harry"" (Matas del Pozo), his little brother (Milton de la Canal), and his mother (Cecilia Roth) and dad (Ricardo Darn), manages to convey the atmosphere of persecution, violence and lies that the dictatorship prompted.

I don't want to tell you more about the plot of ""Kamchatka"", because I strongly believe that you should watch it, and appreciate by yourself how good it is. Of course, highly recommended...

PS: If you can, watch the deleted scenes in the bonus features. There is a specially beautiful one that involves a toad, and that somehow transmits hope.",1186704000,3,1115,4.978494623655914
