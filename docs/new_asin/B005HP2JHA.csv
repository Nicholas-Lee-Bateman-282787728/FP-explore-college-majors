4702742,3,B005HP2JHA,"In a Spanish thriller ""Kidnapped"" (original title ""Secuestrados""), an ordinary middle-to-upper class family - a married couple and their teenage daughter - is attacked and taken hostage by three masked burglars in their new home within a gated community. Unlike ""Funny Games"" (original or remake), in which one character breaks the conventions of the horror genre, ""Kidnapped"" aims for realism with a simpler approach to the material.

That works to some extent. The home invasion movie is violent and relentless, with more graphic descriptions of violence than in Michael Haneke's films. However, while the moments of raw and brutal violence shot with a shaky hand-held camera is disturbing enough, the film's stock characters (criminals or victims), who keep doing things totally unnecessary do not convince, making the already thin story longer than necessary.

This is a sophomore work from Miguel ngel Vivas. He directs the film with confidence and his visual skills (with one Brian De Palma-like split screen) are pretty impressive. His talent as a director is undeniable, but the 85 minute film, competently-shot and well-acted as it is, heavily suffers from countless clichs that are barely tolerable.

""Kidnapped"" shows you that something terrible can happen in the place that should be the safest in the world - something that most people interested in this kind of film know even before seeing it.",1328745600,,1408,5.276785714285714
4702743,1,B005HP2JHA,"Ever since ""Funny Games"" came along, movie audiences no longer want mere suspense; they want sick dread or else they're disappointed.  Reviewers, also ravenous for more horror and death, have justified the genre by claims such as ""The movie actually is a clever commentary on audience complicity in the violence -- implied or shown --on screen.""  Supposedly by realistically depicting torture and suffering, people will see how hidious it really is and be apalled, but we know better, don't we?  Nobody watches over and over a moive that disgusts them with its cruelty.  They watch it for the 8th time because they enjoy it.

""Kidnapped"" is ""Funny Games"" and ""The Strangers"" all over again only this time you get to see the cruelty AND the blood.  How much fun can it be to end another movie with the family slaughtered?  This is more like shock treatment than a movie, only this time we've seen it all before.",1323734400,6,910,4.75796178343949
4702744,3,B005HP2JHA,"There is a certain deftness in the handling of this violent thriller but, at the end of the day, the story is unremarkable.

Here's the scoop. A husband, wife and teenaged daughter move into a a very upscale house in a Madrid suburb. Their first night three men break into the house and take them hostage. They're going to fleece the place and get dad to take as much money out of the ATM as possible and then the bank the following day. Things go wrong.

This is directed well. I did feel as though I were witnessing something. There was a naturalness to the directing that made me feel as though I were there. Some commented on the extreme violence but to me, it wasn't until the last 90 seconds or so that I really felt uncomfortable. During much of it the violence was fairly run of the mill. The story itself was pedestrian. The bad guys come. They overact to make everyone frightened. But, of course, unexpected things happen and they need to adapt. Nothing really happens that you might not have already seen in other similar movies. The near escapes. The missteps by the hostages that , once failed, make the hostages plead for their lives. This isn't new. There is some hope and some good things happen for the hostages. But then the end comes and it really made me want to spit. This film doesn't end. It stops. And it stops in the ugliest way possible.

This is a solid effort. It is handled well and it's worth the time to view it. Just don't expect anything too out of the norm.",1323388800,4,1491,4.375451263537906
4702745,4,B005HP2JHA,"Daryl Loomis, DVD Verdict --Kidnapped is driven by its scenario, not its characters, which has its positives and its negatives. Writer/director Miguel ngel Vivas (Reflections) doesn't give the audience anything to go on and just drops them into the situation. The main characters are neither sympathetic nor hateable; there are no indications as to why these men have entered the home or, outside of money, what they hoped to achieve; there is basically no story to speak of at all. As much as those deficiencies might indicate failure, though, the film actually works rather well.

Because it's a blank slate with very little story development, Kidnapped manages to steer clear of gimmicks. Sure, the family fights back, but nobody turns out to be massively strong, nobody jumps in to save them at the end, and nobody has some heretofore unknown skill that is perfect for just this situation. Horror has enough of all that, as it stands. Instead, the film goes into mostly realist territory, meaning that those with the best weapons and the most force are the ones who win, while those without are left to suffer punishment. That doesn't make for an especially heartwarming film, but I like the fact that it doesn't pretend that there's much hope for the victims.

Of course, if there's no real story development and no redemption of the characters, it leads to the inevitable question of why somebody would want to watch in the first place. That's more difficult to answer, because there's a lingering feeling when watching any of the films in this realm that all I'm doing is watching wretched things happen to people. If they're token, though, discerning redeemable qualities in characters is utterly pointless and this isn't the kind of movie that abides much pointless activity. Outside of a very brief opening that brings up questions never to be answered, this is a no nonsense story. It gets in and gets out without explanation or excuse. If that means some unpleasant viewing or an irredeemable story, so be it, Kidnapped works. It's filmed without much style, but with a good look, and the performances are excellent across the board. It's mean, violent, and hard to watch; it doesn't set out to do a whole lot more than that, so how can I fault it for not giving me a completely satisfying, pretty picture of a resolution.

From MPI and IFC Films, Kidnapped arrives in a decent package on DVD. The wide image is strong, with a strong, if not exceptional picture. Almost the entirety of the film takes place indoors, so its ability to shine is a little stunted, but it performs fairly well, with solid black levels and realistic flesh tones. The sound is similar, maybe a little better but, like the image transfer, there isn't a whole lot to tax the system. There is decent separation in the front and clear dialog, but very little comes through in the rear channels. That's fine, though, this isn't the kind of movie that needs a big, dynamic soundscape; it's full where it needs to be. Extras are left to a scant making-of piece and a couple of trailers, but technically, it's a fine disc.

4702746,5,B005HP2JHA,"Kidnapped took quite awhile to establish it's main characters so that made it a little slow in the begging ,slow yet still interesting.
The further you get into the film the more you get immersed into the story,it's as if you are there. Brilliant camera angles and infectious acting take it even further up the Indie film chain.
The ending of this movie left me breathless and truly shocked. It wasn't a gore fest but there are some very very brutal and gory scenes one in particular that will stay with you for quite some time. I say buy it because it is a film you can watch again.
The intruders are like many we have seen in films such as this before.
The good one ,who wants no bloodshed,the sociopath that of course could care less and the middle man who is neither here nor there just being part of the team,somehow this manages to do it better than most.
Amazing genre piece.",1322697600,2,882,4.384146341463414
4702747,5,B005HP2JHA,"The first time I saw this film was on the on-demand rental and I was astounded. Other than The Last Circus that came out of Spain this year this film to is gruesome and macabre. Spain has had a lot of great films this year but those two are the worst. Atrocious is another great film to that came out of that country. Actually of all the films I saw this year Spain had the best films of all, especially the brutal films. Even though that Kidnapped is not far fetched at all because the film touches on things that happen in everyday life. But, the director has really long shots that keeps you uneasy throughout especially after the first 15 minutes. I cannot wait to see what he does next, because he is definitely one of Spain's best director's of this generation.",1320105600,,767,4.370629370629371
8473412,4,B005HP2JHA,"This is troubling entertainment. I would call it a ''terror film'' not horror. Here the intensity and duration of the frightful scenes drag on and we are left watching the damaged victims. The violence is real. The savagery of the criminals is intense and unforgiving.

Too many American violent films are cartoonish in their delivery of violence. I love martial arts films but too many are like ""road runner cartoons"" where the stunts are perfectly executed and the players return in the next scene without any visible damage. Here the characters suffer and it shows. The women are brutalized and if they put up a fight it doesn't make a difference. (So much for the ""woman warrior"" idea floating around Hollywood nowadays.
That's one thing I hate about American films like the ""Hunger Games"" or ""the Purge"" films where the violence is neatly choreographed and the characters easily ""kill"" each other. (It's too clean and sterile.)
This film is horribly honest in the depiction of terror and violence. The premise is violent, savage people will brutalize, threaten and rape weak, innocent people who simply cannot defend themselves. How many of us fall into that category?
This movie is painful to watch and spoiler alert, the ending is sickening but anyone who thinks they are ""a tough guy (or girl)""  must watch this movie.

Thank God we have the right to bear arms in the USA. Watch this film and prepare for the worse. Prepare an emergency kit for your home. Learn how to fight. Exercise and get to know your neighbors. Savage people exist and they only take prisoners to rape them later on.",1507593600,,1596,4.817518248175182
8473413,5,B005HP2JHA,"Ok, this director is going to be a huge star someday. No doubt about it.
What if there is a movie that is so normal and you have seen this kind of story so many times that you almost feel like you want to just watch it just because you think the story is not bad, the acting is not bad, the tenstion is there, I've watched the half already. And then bam !!!!!
The ending, never forgettable ending that makes you so so shocking that you cannot forger forever in your life and you hail the director for it and you think that this guy is a genious although it is not original and I'm sure he is a bit out of his mind but then again with the good music on the background, everything is forgettable. And plus, above all the movie was steady enough to sustain the finale. And you know, you will never forget the ending anyway no matter what you say.

No one will run away but to say OH MY GOD WHAT HAVE I JUST WATCHED?

KIDNAPPED is a movie not tells a story based on the point of view of the victim but maybe more on the attacker's side. Who won? If I have to say> The attacker.

I just can't erase the ending.",1467072000,,1105,3.990950226244344

8473416,4,B005HP2JHA,"I watched this movie on netflix because I heard it was good.

I was a bit disappointed that my only option to watch the movie was an English dub. The dubbing wasn't bad, but I would've much preferred to watch this in it's original Spanish. I can't comment if the DVD contains the original audio track or not.

Now to the movie.

This movie was pretty horrific and honestly uncomfortably scary. This was not a ""fun"" horror movie by any means. The victims don't muster up superhuman strength to beat the stuffing out of their tormentors and there is nothing funny about what's going on during the movie.

It's dark, brutal and gets quite nasty. The movie is very to the point.... a normal family moves into a nice house and 3 masked men unexpectedly show up and mayhem ensues. There isn't a lot of character development, and the men break into the house for no other reason other then to steal money. The family is targeted randomly and basically it's a ""will the family survive or won't they"" kind of deal.

The pacing is tight and clocks in around 90 minutes. Kidnapped is also well-filmed and well-lit with some stellar use of split screen during certain key moments. This movie certainly looked like it had a budget.

The tension and the suspense are intense to say the least and It's been a while since I've been genuinely frightened during a scary movie. It's weird, since the movie is so similar to the Strangers and those kinds of home invasion movies, but there is something about this flick that really grabbed me and scared me in a way that the Strangers did not.

I found myself yelling (more than once) ""What are you doing?!??"" ""PICK UP A **^&$* weapon now!!"" ""RUN!"" ""Bite him!"" ""Get UP and get it together!"" etc etc, because I was somehow becoming so involved in the movie. I wanted these people to survive, but it just seemed so hopeless and the movie doesn't hide that. No one does anything completely stupid, so I felt like I was always invested in the film and the charcters. I just kept wondering, will these people fight back and if so, when will they have the opportunity? Should they try to fight back? Did they blow their opportunity to escape?

What would I do in this situation? Would I be able to get up and fight these incredibly powerful (and sadistically violent) men, or would I do as they say?

The violence isn't too bad until about the last 15 minutes or so, and there is a nasty sexual assault and some brutal brutal violence. The violence feels very real and is amplified with minimal music and minimal showy gore. The final few minutes of the movie were horrific and honestly very upsetting. I was so shocked by the nastiness of the last five seconds of the movie, I don't think that I'll ever be able to forget it.

The movie is bleak and relentless and the ending is lacking in the sunshine department. Kidnapped is impactful, and a roller coaster, but I felt a little grimy after watching this movie honestly. I can't say it's a five star movie.. I liked it and i was scared but it's hard to say that I throughly enjoyed this flick and truthfully, you've seen this movie before. But then again, maybe originality isn't a part of making a straight to the point home invasion flick.

I would watch it again and show some of my horror hound friends for sure and I think any self-respecting horror fan should really see this movie.

I felt like I was part of this family's ordeal and I don't think I'll ever be able to forget it.",1417046400,,3462,4.469096671949287

8473418,1,B005HP2JHA,"I can't say that I found this movie interesting but just depressing. The whole movie the family doesn't fight back, but the last 10 minutes of the movie the family loses their will to live and just goes crazy. I had no heart to watch this, the family is abused, tortured and raped. The family does what ever these men tell them to do of course with some refusal, but it's not a movie a family can watch I mean you really feel uncomfortable watching this (depending who you are).

Of course this is just my opinion, but I can't say it's  a good movie. The movie becomes predictable in a lot of the scenes, its a bite off of many movies and you just feel disgusted watching a lot of the scenes. I feel this movie was more of a sadistic movie more than a thriller or horror. If you watch this please consider that children should not be in the room, nor the faint of heart. This isn't a movie you watch to feel scared but more uncomfortable. I wouldn't say the title is accurate, I would say ""hostage"" or ""tortured"" would be more accurate.",1373673600,,1036,4.253807106598985
8473419,5,B005HP2JHA,"I found this movie to be quite well done. It's a very realistic and very sadistic film that has about the most unhappy ending I think I have ever seen. In fact the ending is about as depraved and despicable at you can imagine. A lot of people complained about the dubbing, which was actually done about as good as it can possibly get. Any time dubbing is involved it's incredibly difficult to make it match up without getting rather laughable results. But here though the dubbing seems sometimes pathetic, it's done about as respectfully as is humanly possible. As far as dubbing goes this was one of the better attempts at it. So I was able to accept it for what it was. That aside this film is fairly believable and very entertaining, even though the end result is very unforgiving and depraved. This film lies somewhere between 'Last House On The Left' and 'In Cold Blood'. The victims of a home invasion robbery in this film are treated sadistically and unflinchingly. The audience can hope all it wants, but the end result delivers some very heartbreaking and brutally honest reality. Things like this unfortunately happen in real life once in awhile. Life is sometimes all too hopeless in situations such as this. Sometimes hope and the will to live are not respected enough, and people suffer and die anyway. In the meantime, however sad and bleak this story might be, what lies in between is some of the most horrifying film making I have seen in a long time. I think this film. while brutally frank and despicable in it's subject matter, is superbly executed and powerfully presented. Certainly bleak and discusting, but also simply unforgettable.",1367625600,5,1656,4.753472222222222
