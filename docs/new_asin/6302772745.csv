510828,5,6302772745,If ever there is a movie you should see add this one to your list.  I own it.  Too bad it isn't put on DVD.  I would hate to lose it because of the tape disintegrating.,1180051200,3,168,3.611111111111111
510829,5,6302772745,"One of my favorite ""message"" movies.  Roslind Russell and Alec Guiness are delightful as widow and widower who set aside the past to discover each other.  Wonder if they will do a remake set in Iraq?",1168300800,2,199,4.5
510830,5,6302772745,"Back when I was 16  or 17 years old, I came home late one night after a date, and turned on the TV. A Majority of One was on, and I was soon wrapped up in the story. Believe it or not, as a teenager, I was totally enthralled by this story of a romance between two aging people of different cultures.
But, I came from a very strict family, and my parent's bedroom was in earshot of the TV. I knew if I woke them, I'd be in big trouble. So eventually, I got too nervous to enjoy the movie, and went to bed. But, I never forgot the movie, and always wanted to see the end.
Then one day recently, I suddenly thought about it, and realized I could probably buy it online. I couldn't remember the name of the movie offhand, but I did a search on Alec Guiness, and recognized the title when I saw it.
So, I finally got to see the end. I won't tell you the end, but I will say it was worth the wait. This is a sentimental movie, true, but it also has a number of ideas that work through it. (You remember ideas...) One of the themes, stated in other reviews, has to do with racism. Then there is main theme that, if you are right, and the rest of the world is wrong, then you form a majority of one. Great idea! And there's the idea that mature people should be respected because they have more experience in human relations than young people.
Funny thing is, my mother watched it with me, and loved it even more than I did. It was fun to watch it together as two adults, after my past history with the movie.
Okay, accepting Alec Guiness as a Japanese gentleman is a bit of a strech. But just the scene with Rosalind Russel standing pigeon-toed in a kimono is worth the price of the movie.",1084406400,30,1682,4.066265060240964
510831,5,6302772745,"This movie is truly hopeful and uplifting.
Roz Russell ( Mrs. Jacoby) plays a Jewish American widow who's son  was killed by the Japanese during WW11.
She,her daughter and son-in-law take a ship to Japan because the son-in-law is to play a part in the trade relations
conference between the Japanese and U.S.
On board ship she is introduced to a widowed Japanese businessman Koichi Asano ( Alec Guinness)who will lead the Japanese contingent in the trade negotiations. Mr. Asano's wife
was killed at Hiroshima.
Mrs. Jacoby is polite but very cool towards Mr. Asano at their initial meeting,but over time and several chance encounters
these two people overcome their hostilities and prejudices to
see each other as gentle loving human beings.
Both Russell and Guiness exude such warmth and charm that it is
understandable how these two people from seemingly diverse
backgrounds could develop tender feelings for each other.
As an aside,look for Russell getting a little tipsy while
at Mr. Asano's home.
This is definately a two thumbs up movie.
PLEASE bring it out on DVD.",1074124800,48,1071,5.01685393258427
510832,5,6302772745,"This is one of the ultimate feel good movies of the 20th century.  Watching the characters develope slowly and completely is so fulfilling.  The relationships within the different families in different cultures is so encouraging.  It is a little fantasy that proves that there can be exciting romance even though one has raised a family, and lost a beloved long term spouse.",973382400,10,374,5.0

510874,1,6302772745,"I purchased this film through Amazon because it is a wonderful and touching movie.  The DVD I received from Amazon was of terrible quality, it froze repeatedly.  I asked for a replacement DVD, received it and the second one received was actually worse than the first one.

I am shocked that Amazon would sell such a poor quality product, that is offered by the studio that made the film.  Warner Brothers Archive Collection.
Again the film is a wonderful film, however it is impossible to watch on such a terrible DVD.",1489190400,4,518,4.65934065934066
510875,4,6302772745,"This is one of those 1950s sweetheart, romantic type of movies.  A corny plot line but you'll just love Rosalind Russell.  My favorite scene occurs in the hallway of the ocean liner where Rosalind has her first serious conversation with Mr. Asano or ""Mr. Japanese"" as she refers to him.  The credibility of the film would have been better had the producers hired a Japanese actor to play the role of Mr. Asano and this is the reason I give the film four stars instead of five.  But for a evening of sweet entertainment, this is a great film.",1488844800,2,541,4.434343434343434

510883,5,6302772745,"Many years ago, I stumbled on this mid-way through the film by mistake on t.v. Thank goodness that channel played it again so I could see the whole thing from beginning to end........because it instantly became my very favorite movie....and I was quite young then.

In this story, the young people who arrogantly believe they are the most enlightened and international (much like in real life) reveal themselves when tested, to be the most parochial and rigid.  The younger generation disregards the wisdom that comes from their mother/mother-in-law who afforded her children, through her hard work and experience, the very opportunities they believe make them superior,  But she recognizes the hubris of youth....and forgives it, finding joy in her children, and deep love for them, without judgment.  And then, there is the beauty of true love between two seasoned people of different backgrounds.  I looooooove this movie.  The music is like a character in the film.....that  kind of soundtrack is long gone now.  Rosalind Russell makes this a classic.

I hope other people find this gem as enjoyable as I do.....every time.",1480118400,4,1127,5.148351648351649

A fair price and great response to the order. For those that don't know the movie: The story is written with honesty and truths. Heartbreaks and rebirths. It is after World War 2, many hurts and dislikes of people on both Japan and USA sides. Two people come to understanding and new vision of things they could not have known.

It could not be made today since Alec Guinness would never be allowed to play a Japanese man on screen, but he is great in the role. It's about postwar Japan and it's warm, funny and respectful. It's really a film about the difference between generations as much as differences between cultures. Terrific casting, brilliant script.

It is really amazing to see him pull off a Japanese. You must research the background about the movie and the elements required in making it. Rosalind Russell is endearing and charming and so forgiving and understanding. we should all have a mother like her to remind us of our flaws and comfort us at the same time.

511162,5,6302772745,"I had never seen this gem until a couple of years ago.  It's the story of a Jewish widow from Brooklyn who finds an unlikely love with a Japanese industrialist and diplomat.

You have to look past the casting - Sir Alec Guiness as the Japanese diplomat, and Rosalind Russell as the Jewish widow.  In truth, Russell is probably even more of a stretch, as far as believability goes, than Guiness is.  But they're both such great actors that you really have to overlook the racial overtones and possible insensitivity of casting a white actor as a Japanese man (it's especially jarring if you watch this movie right after ""The Bridge Over the River Kwai"", as I did!)

The acting, as mentioned above, is first rate, and the story deals with love, loss, forgiveness and prejudice, in a very real and heartfelt way.  The supporting characters are all quite good as well, and there's plenty of humor to go along with the drama.  Definitely recommended!",1380067200,5,945,4.6909090909090905

When her daughter and son-in-law (working for the US Diplomatic office) invite her to move to Japan with them on his new assignment, she agrees with much reluctance.  On the voyage overseas she meets a distinguished Japanese widower, played by Alec Guiness, whose family was killed in Hiroshima.  An unlikely friendship ensues, which challenges not only the two friends, but the daughter and son-in-law, who portray themselves as un-prejudiced, but must come to terms with their own deeply-seated prejudices as well.  A great story which speaks to themes that are always relevant.",1378339200,2,747,5.243697478991597

511246,5,6302772745,"I was watching the bizarre makeup jobs in the current Cloud Atlas, in the segment set in Korea, and Hugo Weaving and Jim Sturgess are made up in what amounts to ""yellowface"" when suddenly I remembered watching A Majority of One long ago and thinking, why on earth did they put Alec Guinness in the part of the Japanese millionaire?  Back then, the answer was that people thought Alec Guinness was such a great actor he could play anything!  Even 20 years later, Guinness was being cast as a native of India in David Lean's film of Passage to India, and it didn't really work there for him.  Maybe times had changed, but even in the 60s there must have been an eyebrow or two raised up seeing Guinness acting like Peter Lorre with gray stripes painted under his eyes, and looking down at the floor instead of looking at Rosalind Russell's face.

Basically the acting is so stylized that many will not buy it, but after awhile, I just let the pleasures of the story sink in and before I knew it, my liberal tear glands had been stimulated and I was all abawl and nosedeep in Kleenexes.  Watching this movie must have made Rodgers and Hammerstein wonder why they had even bothered with the sturm und drang of South Pacific, because here was South Pacific, except perfected.  They must have felt like two John the Baptists preaching the coming glory of A Majority of One.  In fact it's not surprising that Hammerstein died not too long after the release of the Majority of One movie--his work on earth complete.  Maybe South Pacific does better in the scenery department, though those tragic red and yellow and blue filters are still recalled with horror by every musical fan.  But at least the actors seemed like they were outside, somewhere, in South Pacific.  I daresay that stage sets were used both for Brooklyn, Pan An cabin interiors, and all of Japan--which amounts to two plain looking streets and as dockside steamer lounge.  The rest of the budget for the movie must have been spent in hiring box office titans Russell and Guinness.  I'd like to say a few words concerning the performances of Madlyn Rhue and Ray Danton as Russell's daughter and son-in-law.  They are wonderfully Mad Men in their ways of dressing, speaking, and sexing it up.  Danton is particular swaggers through his ambassadorial role as though he thinks he';s playing the lead in a biopic about Hugh Hefner.  The young actor who plays Eddie, the vicious Japanese houseboy, is worthy of a Quentin Tarantino cameo himself.  He is extraordinary in his part, a shot of sheer adrenaline in a very dainty and refined picture.

As many have noted, Rosalind Russell is supposed to play a Jewish widow in this movie, and she is famous for trying to relate Jewish holidays and customs to Japanese ones, as though to underline the point that it's a small world after all.  I have no idea of how to say You're welcome in Japanese, but I expect that if ever put to the test, I would say, Don't Touch My Mustache, since Russell advises her charges to do just that, not once, but three times in the picture.  If you liked Hiroshima Mon Amour, A Majority of One might upset you with its somewhat casual attitude towards the markets opened up by the atom bomb, but there you go, you can't please everyone.  After awhile you do notice how the movie is one big commercial for capitalism, the trade conference stuff is so boring until you realize that the whole point is that America and Japan can get along because both countries have an appreciation for getting wealthy.  Would Guinness have gotten to first base with Russell had he not been a plutocrat?  Hard to say.",1351555200,,3628,4.609642301710731

511249,4,6302772745,"In 1961 Leonard Spigelgass adapted his Broadway play for the Warner Bros. film starring Rosalind Russell and Alec Guinness and directed by Mervyn LeRoy.

This popular Broadway play weaves both comedic and dramatic elements to question whether individuals can overcome the mutual suspenses and prejudices that war wounds have left upon their souls.

My husband and I watched this movie last night on TCM. We both thoroughly enjoyed it. An unusual story line.  Alec Guinness and Rosalind Russell were old pros. They played it so well. It was enjoyable and funny watching their relationship slowly develop in spite of the odds. There were a couple of surprises especially at the end. I was taken off guard. (No spoilers here.) It was a real delight to watch on a Saturday night. Just one criticism: the Asian appearance of Alec Guinness' eyes was poorly done and I found it somewhat distracting. They simply didn't look normal. Rosalind Russell won her fourth Golden Globe for Best Actress for this performance. Alec Guinness worked hard to play a Japanese man, spending time studying Japanese culture. He seemed totally at ease playing the part.

Madlyn Rhue was one of my favourite actresses from the 50's-1984. It was nice to see her again. She died in 2003 from MS complications.

This film, which came out in the very early 60's I think, is based on a play by Leonard Spiegelgass.  Some of the dialog by the daughter and son-in-law comes across as dated and stilted, but the performances by Guinness and Russell eclipse everything else, bringing to life a lovely story that reminds us that youth, despite its ""modernity,"" isn't wiser or smarter than experience and minds that are willing to change and grow.

I found Alec Guiness and his intense rehearsed facial expressions (looked at facelifts gone wrong,??) and variable L word pronunciation way over the top amusing given all his other spectacular performances.  Roz's theatrical tendencies toward roles (i.e. Auntie Mame, etc.) was annoying but reached great heights during a Sake binge. Eddie, the houseboy, was amusing in his Sumo wrestling adulation and western music and irritating habits.  I found the surprise visit to Mr. Asano's home very educational in terms of how to adapt to this ancient culture. Also, a nod for certain religious aspects and rituals for the Jewish faith were intesting.  Mr. Black's overacting following the foiled negotiations (doulbe gins, smoking incessantly, fearful anger, and pacing, etc.) were too far from his completely humble demure persona.  I relished the taking back the respect from the youngins philosophy and found this the greatest treasure in the movie. Very complex storylines and surprise twists that made for compelling viewing.

Couldn't they have found a real Chinese guy to play the part?  But the cantankerous Rosalind Russell was perfect for her role, and played it to the hilt.
