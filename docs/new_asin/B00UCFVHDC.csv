7035985,5,B00UCFVHDC,"It is fantastic have loved watching all 4 seasons.
Big thank you to the company who released it to DVD. The series was filmed between 1986 - 1989
Would highly recommend for anybody all ages to buy this series. Being from Australia I have learnt a lot about the early days of Canada.
Its set in the 1830's.  Great Family viewing
Bought the series only because it showed one episode with very young David James Elliott's star of JAG
It really showed how talented he is, he played a Mentally Challenged Person.
But now I'm hooked on the series",1438041600,3,540,4.454545454545454
7035986,5,B00UCFVHDC,I liked the shows. It was a very interesting series,1462838400,,51,4.2
7035987,5,B00UCFVHDC,"Excellent program for family viewing about people who might have been. Sanitized, not gory or explicit, ""Campbell's"" takes up the task of giving us a glimpse of Southern Ontario, Canada. Almost two hundred years ago, new immigrants were faced with many challenges. The cast is charming and believable, you will want to meet them.",1456963200,,329,5.111111111111111

7035989,5,B00UCFVHDC,My brother and I grew up watching The Campbells. A fun pioneer tv show set in the 1830's in Canada and Scotland. I enjoy the lessons and family values of the show. I now watch The Campbells with my son.,1454889600,,202,4.075

7035994,5,B00UCFVHDC,"ONE OF THE  GREATEST ENTERTAINING, CLEAN, WHOLESOME FAMILY SHOWS THAT'S EVER BEEN MADE !!!!!!! I've been a fan of THE CAMPBELLS since I discovered reruns in early 1990s. The series could not have been casted any more perfectly than the way it was !!! Each one of the actors were perfect for their role !!! British actor Malcolm Stoddard is a very talented actor and brings his all to the series as well as the other ones. Also, I love to listen to Malcolm's accent !! You won't be disappointed !!!",1439337600,3,497,4.461538461538462
7035995,5,B00UCFVHDC,"This splendid program series was a collaboration of Scottish Television, Telefilm Canada and Fremantle International. If any Canadian Studies program on the university level needed a visualization of a personal narrative of early 19th century rural life in Ontario, this program is the primary candidate of choice. It seems ironic that it is broadcast on Retro TV in the United States and not on PBS. The marvelous aspects of acting are given by the family quartet of Malcolm Stoddard, Amber Lea Weston, John Wildman, and Eric Richards, with a special regard for Cedric Smith as the irascible patrician Captain Sims. I love this series. It is such a pleasure to be surprised nowadays by a television series from thirty years ago ( 1985-1988 ) which succeeds in the development of television as a high art. The historic content is remarkably accurate and gives one an incentive to study Canadian history and its relation to the British Isles, not to mention the burgeoning United States. It is a truly worthwhile discovery for all ages.",1438732800,9,1035,4.988439306358382
8705362,5,B00UCFVHDC,I loved watching this when I lived in Canada. It was set to take place not many miles from where I lived so was of particular interest. It's wonderful to see what Canada would have been like back in the 1820's/30's in the early days of settlement.,1533168000,,247,4.276595744680851
8705363,5,B00UCFVHDC,"Great series for families with a little older children. My 8 year old enjoyed it, but we had to explain a few things. Great family values, a little bit of language (mostly British exclamations) and a step more mature than Little House on the Prairie.",1515196800,,250,4.5777777777777775

8705367,5,B00UCFVHDC,Very happy to have this on DVD. I loved the series when it was on tv years ago. Now it will be great binge watching during the winter.,1481760000,,134,3.8214285714285716
8705368,5,B00UCFVHDC,"Very well done series.  Family friendly.  My sister came to visit and was only able to view half the stories in the time she was staying with us.  She liked the series so much so much she bought her own set when she returned home so she could finish the series and had to get her ""fix"" of The Campbells and the rest of the episodes.",1477612800,2,332,4.0
8705369,5,B00UCFVHDC,"This was my favorite series as a youth in the 1980's. Here in the U.S. this series aired on the Family Channel. I was fortunate in that I had most of the episodes recorded from when it originally aired. But I did not have the complete collection, and many of my recordings were poor, and in some cases had been cut short. I had long since given up on this wonderful series ever being available for purchase, so imagine my surprise when I finally saw it available on Amazon. I immediately ordered it not knowing how long it would be available, and I'm happy to now have the complete collection.

The is an excellent series that those from an older generation will appreciate, and perhaps some from the younger generation as well. The story starts off in the 1830's in Scotland, with Dr James Campbell as a widower, along with his 3 children. Lured by the prospect of having his own farm, an unlikely possibility where they reside, oldest son Neil tries to convince his father to relocate the family to the mostly uninhabited, and still very wild Canada, at that time a British colony. It is also about this time that a medical procedure gone wrong, due to no fault of Dr Campbell, tarnishes the good doctors reputation within the community, making the decision to leave all the more easier. Filmed in the wilderness of Ontario, the scenery in this series is nothing short of breathtaking.

As a side note, did anyone else recall that in the earlier episodes that there was a different Mrs Sims, as well as a Sims son Richard that appeared in a few episodes, never to be seen or heard from again? I had also forgot all about the Frenchmen that ran Logan's Inn in the earlier episodes prior to the arrival of Mrs Logan, and that spawn of Satan son of hers ( I jest of course, though if memory serves me correctly, he was a rambunctious little fellow).",1475020800,4,1848,4.497023809523809
8705370,1,B00UCFVHDC,"I imagine that the series was probably good; but the copy I received was bad.  It kept tiling and cutting out.  I tried it on multiple machines and got the same result each time.  SO, I went ahead and returned it before seeing the series.",1468713600,,238,4.2444444444444445
8705371,5,B00UCFVHDC,The audio & graphic quality of the DVDs were excellent.,1465430400,,55,4.6
