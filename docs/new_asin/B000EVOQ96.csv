I haven't seen it in over 25 years, but I do remember how great it was. I has to come out on DVD or online along with Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean.",1296172800,7,292,4.0344827586206895
2539783,5,B000EVOQ96,"This movie, also released by HBO as ""Between Friends"" is about two recently divorced women who must not only cope with the loneliness, but also with their self-worth; as both their husbands leave them for other women. Carol Burnett plays Mary Castelli, a real estate woman who fills her loneliness through sexual permiscuity and married men, while Deborah Shapiro, played brilliantly by Elizabeth Taylor, sees a middle-aged, paunchy business man who is grufty and constantly after her to get married, even though the two are not in love with each other.

For those fans of Carol Burnett who were used to her comedy show, this portrayal is a departure from the usual Carol even though one might recognize her comedy in a few lines here and there. Carol is also skilled in playing a personage that you learn to feel sorry for as she has been so wounded by her husband's leaving.

The magic moments of the film are the results of a bonding between Mary Castelli and Deborah. I've watched the film many times and always come back to it. It is not for younger audiences as there are sexual references and language. Without giving away the plot, I would highly recommend it. It is shot in Toronto, Canada, but passes for New York City. Great shots of Union Station!

There is a happy-ending after a climax of life-changing events, realisations and just plain great acting!",1246579200,16,1366,4.755274261603375

Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

I mean no offense to Carol Burnett, but I don't find her an attractive woman, in any way. Obviously, she disagrees with my assessment, otherwise she wouldnt have taken the lead role in Between Friends. In the HBO movie, she plays a single mother who willingly engages in affairs with married men. Shes continually referred to as beautiful, sexy, irresistible, and a volcano in the sack-a-roo. If you're confused by that, you will be befuddled when you learn the second lead in the film, a meek woman who wants to marry and be taken care of, is played by Elizabeth Taylor. Did the casting director switch the paperwork? For the life of me, I don't understand why the two women didn't switch roles.

Im not trying to be mean, but it just didn't work for me. Liz did a very good job in a role thats against type; shes far from calculating, a little stupid, and finds sex with her sweetie-pie repellant. But when watching Carols scenes, you can practically smell her ego as she announces to the television, See! I am sexy! and it just doesnt work. Plus, in the scenes when shes not in the bedroom, her characters personality is pretty lousy. She yells at people and has no sympathy or tolerance for people who don't want to blindly take her orders.

If that type of movie appeals to you, Ill offer one more warning: There is no plot to this movie. Its a movie about two women who meet by chance, and disjointed scenes are strung together to show the audience that they remain friends in the years to come. No plot and no point. No bueno for me.",1500422400,,1597,4.462328767123288
8114720,5,B000EVOQ96,"Between Friends was released in 1983. It starred Elizabeth Taylor, with good support from Carol Burnett. Fans of Elizabeth Taylor will like this the most.",1482710400,,154,5.2

8114722,4,B000EVOQ96,"Great movie.  I remember watching it when it first aired on HBO.  Then one day my ex took me to a video store that was going out of business and there it was.  I think I got it for under 5 dollars, but I never got rid of it.  So when I got a dvd burner for Christmas one year I transferred it.  It sucks that they do not have it on dvd as of yet.  However, if anyone wants a copy on dvd, I can burn it for you.  You just need to pay for postage!  Anyway.  If you can, watch this movie....it was a great dramody!",1422662400,2,511,3.6574074074074074

8114724,5,B000EVOQ96,"This film was released in September of 1983 on HBO. As usual, even for back then, HBO put out a quality product, that slipped through the cracks as far as recognition and critical reception.
 Liz is amazing as Deborah, a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown that drinks very heavily to ""deal"" with her constant fears. Her ""breakdown"" occurs at the climatic point of the movie, where she makes a complete raging spectacle of herself at her elegant 50th birthday party in her mansion with hundreds of guests. She climbs up on a glass table and starts spewing off all kinds of fun stuff you have to see (not to mention what happens to the table). Before that, she has a tirade at her workplace. Tragic stuff, but fun to watch the ""trainwreck""!
 Burnett is Taylor's ""rational"" go to guy, but Deb reminds her of her shameful casual sexcapades ""why there might be millions of them!"" as a ""you are too!"" rational.
Fun stuff!",1326844800,,922,4.548192771084337
8114725,5,B000EVOQ96,"This movie is excellent. It's kinda old now but still one of my all time favorites. Carol Burnett is a surprise, a very good actor, and of course, Elizabeth Taylor is awesome and breathtakingly beautiful. Recommend highly!!!",1306886400,4,224,5.081081081081081
8114726,5,B000EVOQ96,"Why would a reviewer ruin a perfect score of this movie just because of something that has NOTHING to do with the actual movie?

Anyway as the title says it's funny, moving, campy movie with Elizabeth Taylors amazing beauty and unique style of acting.  Why is not on DVD, or better yet blu-ray?  Everyone is really wanting Elizabeth Taylor material and this would be a very welcome addition.",1304467200,7,391,4.720588235294118
8114727,1,B000EVOQ96,"I haven't had a chance to watch the DVD ""Between Friends"" because I had purchased it for a friend of mine. I did originally order a VHS copy of this movie from Suzie Qwik since I was under the impression that this movie was only available in a VHS format, and I have not found any evidence that it was ever available in a DVD format. But as I said a DVD was sent to me and not a VHS movie which is what I ordered.
  The movie took a long time to get to me (I don't know why) but when I left feedback about this on the Amazon website, it was removed for some unknown reason. Seems Amazon doesn't like their sellers to receive honest feedback when a transaction goes bad.
  Anywhodillydoodilly, I am taking a screen capture of this review so I have evidence that I left it on the Amazon website, just in case a third party needs to investigate any more complaints I have regarding this transaction.
  I would like to add that Suzie Qwik has sent me several harassing and annoying emails regarding this transaction.",1304380800,5,1012,4.272251308900524
