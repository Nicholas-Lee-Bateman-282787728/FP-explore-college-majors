Joey Greco, the host, is my favorite part of the show; he even fooled me a few times into believing how much he cares about the deceived victims! It is a fact though, that the show is hilarious between using dramatic words, Joey Greco, and the crazy reactions of people.

I'm kind of embarrassed saying that I liked it, but it still makes me laugh and for that alone, it is worth watching.",1273881600,3,550,4.6020408163265305
