8423970,5,B004CYF76W,"Lovely! A great interview with the cast of a show I've loved since I was a teenager. Paley Center panels are always awesome. I really enjoy how the cast seems to get along beautifully and especially love the vibe between Tony and Bitty (always thought they had a thing for each other), and Ted and Bitty too. You can see they all love her to death. A lot of the questions I had about the show were answered herein, including about the writing process and character development. Fun fact: Monk was originally set in New York City, with Sharona living in Park Slope and the Vasques murder taking place in Hoboken, a shout-out to Bitty's home state of NJ.

However! For all that positive being said: Everyone seems to stop enjoying themselves after a while in this interview, though, which is unfortunate, and it has to do with the fact that the interviewer is not the greatest and doesn't try and establish a rapport with her panel. Still, they, especially Tony, give good thoughtful answers and aren't rude or short. Tony Shalhoub is a ray of sunshine anywhere he goes anyway, to be fair. Overall a great interview, I really enjoyed it.",1515801600,,1135,4.618811881188119

8423973,4,B004CYF76W,"Any fan of Monk should check out this cast and crew 60 minute sit down interview
Since every season of Monk on dvd is bare and has no extras
This is very cool but, once you see it once you'll be glad you did but, it's not worth owning on dvd
It's very early on after the show hit and became USA and basic cables darling
Bitty Schram was still attached to the series  and the late underrated Stanley Kamel (Dr. Kroger) are both with the cast
It's a very interesting and fun interview overall
getting info from the cast and crew is truly rare
Both Tony Shalhoub and  Ted Levine are Rockstars it's cool seeing them out of character
You can watch this along with other cool Paley Center interviews for free with Amazon Prime
This is a cool interview overall  8.5/10",1451952000,,761,4.3076923076923075
8423974,4,B004CYF76W,"Disagree totally with first reviewer.
Reviewer viewed show with certain expectations and was disappointed when those expectations were not met.
Yes -- Tony Shalhoub (check reviewers spelling) was business-like.  He was also open, charming and honest with his answers.
Realize some  members of the panel were not at their best, but must remember these are actors who perform best with a prepared script.
FOUR  STAR RATING!!",1434931200,,422,5.363636363636363

8423976,1,B004CYF76W,"We like the series Monk and saw this, thinking it would be a more personal view into the people who play on the show.
It was the worst of these type interviews I've ever seen.  Both Ted Levine and Bitty Schram must have been pissed off about something or high. Tony Schalhoub was pleasant but business like. The others were not relavent.  The audience asked stupid questions and the interviewer was clearly not happy to be doing that job.
If I could give this less than one star I would",1404172800,4,486,4.388888888888889
8423977,4,B004CYF76W,"If you are a ""Monk"" fan you'll probably enjoy this.  It isn't of much interest to anyone who isn't.  It gives a little insight into the real personalities of the cast.",1368489600,,167,4.354838709677419
