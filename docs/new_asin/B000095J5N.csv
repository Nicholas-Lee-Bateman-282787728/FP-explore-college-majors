8144993,4,B000095J5N,"I picked this video for a Spanish class to view after we had our discussion of the Spanish Civil War. Several themes came to mind afterward- PTSD, a longing for the past, and reconnecting with the past in order to move on in the future, to name a few. All of the students enjoyed it and recommended it saying they were able to understand a lot of the Spanish and could relate to revisiting the past hoping to find that someone they cherished.",1328659200,2,442,4.337349397590361
8144994,3,B000095J5N,"I bought this DVD after reading Alvah Bessie's ""Spain Again"", a biographical account of Bessie's return to the battlegrounds of the Spanish Civil War and the making of this film. Bessie himself appears in a small but significant role in the film. Blacklisted as one of the Hollywood Ten, Hollywood deprived itself of the services of one of it's great scriptwriters, certainly one of its humane. Worth watching.",1299542400,2,410,5.044117647058823
