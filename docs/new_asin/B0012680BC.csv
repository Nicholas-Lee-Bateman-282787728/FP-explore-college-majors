3077161,4,B0012680BC,"This show is adorable and hilarious to boot. I love the physical comedy - still so effective in such a simple style of animation. There are a lot of funny little touches, usually related to the characters; Santa Claus lives in the ninja village, there's one kid who's always showing off like Bruce Lee and ripping his shirt off. I have a pretty well cultivated sense of humor (or so I'd like to think) and this show made me laugh consistently. It's really cute and I'd recommend it to anyone who's a fan of animated shorts, be they children or not.",1208822400,5,548,4.435643564356436
