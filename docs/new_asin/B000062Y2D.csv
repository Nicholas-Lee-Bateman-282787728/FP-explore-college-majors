""Merci La Vie is an extraordinary journey of discovery, set in both the present and the past, by two young girls, desperate to explore life and, more importantly, get an understanding of its effect on them.  Charlotte Gainsbourg and Anouk Grinberg are excellent as they search for new experiences and explanations for their current circumstances, which carry them back and forth between present day France and the war time occupation. They are supported by the outstanding Gerard Depardieu, playing a crooked and amoral doctor.""

""Bertrand Blier, writer and director of the acclaimed ""Trop Belle Pour Toi"", has created an incredibly imaginative and daring film using startling color and a fantastic range of music, including Philip Glass, Beethoven, David Byrne, Chopin, and Vivaldi.""

This movie is entirely in French (no subtitles).  This is a very rare and hard to find Charlotte Gainsbourg movie.  The movie would probably get an R rating for violence, adult themes and brief nudity (by Anouk Grinberg and a scene where the Germans have packed train loads of nude people into box cars and then execute them).

The copy I purchased was an NTSC VHS version.  The quality, as VHS tapes go was excellent.  The DVD version does have English subtitles.

Personally I did not care for this movie at all but as a Charlotte Gainsbourg fan it was a must have for my collection.",1247529600,8,1619,5.007462686567164
