8510954,1,B0076L918S,"This is one of the worst westerns I have ever seen. It has some campy 1950's style and soundtrack to it, but clearly it is not designed to be a campy film. I have no idea who the blond woman is on the cover of the DVD and why they even show guys riding horses when clearly both were way out of their budget. In one scene, bad guy Big Ben (Jurgen Vollrath) turns to the  supposed saloon crowd and tells them to get about their business. You never see any crowd. They didn't have any extras. Sheriff Mason (Peter Whittaker) is handcuffed to outlaw Hubert (Ian Quick) in the desert. They were mistakenly left there to die instead of being killed outright. The sheriff's wife is forced by Big Ben to be a PG saloon girl.

The two handcuffed men return for revenge in a movie which boasts a cast of nine people. The final shoot out involved 6-shooters being shot dozens of times without a reload. They had CG fire coming out of the nozzle of the gun...when they showed it. Normally they shot the scene with the nozzle end cut off, so all you got to hear was the noise of the gun. Poorly acted, poorly written, poorly directed, poorly funded. Cliche filled. MST laughable.

No bad language, sex, or nudity.",1337385600,2,1200,4.348214285714286
