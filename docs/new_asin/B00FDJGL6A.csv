5975285,5,B00FDJGL6A,"If you like Justified you will love Strike Back. One thing the British do in their series is have no respect for the lead actors lives. British series like MI5 and Downton Abbey will kill off their lead people on a regular basis (I think Downton Abbey has gone a bit to far in this regard), but It does keep you on your toes as you watch the series. Lot of action and great chemistry between actors.",1389571200,3,399,4.194805194805195
5975286,5,B00FDJGL6A,Best show on tv season 3 delivers just as good as the first two seasons of course I got it pre ordered its a must have and amazon will get you the absolute lowest price in the end,1388534400,18,179,3.736842105263158
5975287,5,B00FDJGL6A,This season kept me on the edge of my seat. New characters and plot twist through out the whole season. I can't wait for the DVD/Blu Ray release!,1388016000,8,145,4.214285714285714
5975288,4,B00FDJGL6A,"It is like a ""Mission Impossible"" movie but with British special agents. The action is non-stop and first-rate. The shooting scenes are exciting, and realistic. The explosions are huge and look real. I did not expect that a TV show like this can afford this kind of special effects.

There is some interesting humour too. For instance, the scene where one of the special-op soldier talks with the lady owner of the bar is hilarious.

There are a lot of  twists that keep it interesting till the end.

The acting is mixed. Sometimes it is engaging and convincing, especially in action scenes. Sometimes, it looks fake, i.e the scene where the two special operators were tortured in Columbia.

The directing and editing create breath-taking intensity.

Another factor that makes its intriguing is it is related to current events such as terrorists.

Episode 7 is the worst of this season. It contains many scenes that are so far-fetched that they are laughable. For instance, the fighting scene in the prison in Russia where one of the agents beat many other guys was unbelievable. Episode 10 is the best with many suspenseful scenes.

It contains red-hot sex scenes including unsettling lesbian and gay sex.

This TV show is more interesting than most of the action pictures shown at the theater.

In short, it is not brainy but it is entertaining. It is definitely worth watching once.",1385424000,23,1385,4.880341880341881
5975289,4,B00FDJGL6A,"The lads from Section 20 are back in Season 3 of Strike Back for another butt kicking, wild adventure facing some ruthless terrorists, the IRA, and a deadly bio-weapon.  This series continues to evolve from its fairly silly first season that relied more on style than substance.

  Season two was by far the best with a strong story and minimal reliance on the over-the-top nudity and sex scenes that dominated its freshman outing.  Unfortunately this season the writers and show runners for some reason felt compelled to reverse course a bit and we have more nudity and sex once again; boy on girl, girl on girl, and boy on boy, something for everyone!  If you're easily offended by this type of thing youve been warned.  The script is strong and the action first rate and unrelenting, they don't need to use titillating (pun intended) scenes to hold the viewers interest.

  As always the camaraderie between British SAS commando Michael Stonebridge (Philip Winchester) and disgraced former US Army Delta operator Damien Scott (Sullivan Stapleton) is realistic and believable.  These guys look the part, speak like, move like and act like actual soldiers and seem comfortable with physical combat and weapons handling unlike some shows.  The season starts with the guys on vacation in the US on motorcycles traveling in California on the way to Mexico.  Of course the stuff hits the fan and just after they're pulled over by the highway patrol they're whisked off by helicopter and sucked into another dangerous mission.  The story climaxes with an incredible chase on the runway of Ramstein Air Base (not the real base) thats worthy of a Mission Impossible movie; really all of the stunts are incredible for a TV show.  The Air Force uniforms are laughably wrong but close enough for most viewers.  New for this season is apparent sponsorship by Oakley with some of the team sporting their signature sunwear and tactical gloves (previously everybody wore Ray Bans).

  Things don't let up for a moment; Rhona Mitra is back as their Section 20 boss, Major Rachel Dalton but shes just lost one of her men and struggling to cope.  Her guilt drives her to make some dubious decisions leading the team to question her motives and ultimately getting her killed.  Mitra is starting to make a career of playing a role in a series for a season or two then having her character taken out; just as her part in The Last Ship met a similar fate.  Theres little time for mourning however and events rip along including a surprise twist with one character that I didn't see coming.

  So, Strike Back season 3 is highly recommended for adrenaline junkies.  Again, not quite as good as the last season in my opinion but great entertainment if you can get past the occasional raunchier bits.  Im on board for Season 4!",1522800000,,2804,4.799582463465553

The sexual situations are well done, but they don't really move the characters beyond what we already know! Just use suggestion instead! The cursing and fist bumps are fine, I'm not a prude. haha

There's a lot of attention to detail with training the actors and the sound FX...don't keep going low brow with hump shots. I'm not here to judge the soft core aspect, I just don't think you need it. Move on and spend the money on the actors!!",1503619200,,566,4.289719626168225

the series is wonderful, i enjoy watching it big-time!  It is well done, more realistic than fantasy and for the most part doesnt insult my general intelligence with too much un-real, unbelievable plots. Until Now. this  Strike Back had too many unreal events.  Stop it!  bring back the people who made this show as good as it is someone said the language and sex was a bit much, making it seem sleazy.  i can see that a little but that has been a solid through-line so i can accept that, but what i cant accept is plot holes and general NOT what would really happen i.e.unreal B.S. .  i can only surmise that there was. a personnel change.too bad!  i hope this ends here and the writing gets back to the way was.",1501632000,,947,4.396551724137931

I find it amusing that there is an Aussie playing an American, and an American playing a Brit, but each were exactly right for their parts. The two made a perfect fit as a team, although there was a rocky beginning for them when they were teamed up. Its funny, but the ""Brit"" had the better body, but the ""American"" exuded more sex appeal.

The female operatives were great, did a fantastic job as shooters, and their team work was outstanding as well. I wasn't as impressed with the characters of the Section Heads, but oh well, I guess that is the Head Shed for you.",1497312000,,621,4.262711864406779

I wished I had used it more much earlier into my Prime membership as I have discovered many good TV series to binge on it. One of them, is Strike Back. It's so full of action. The characters fit their roles well, and I find the main characters charming. Damian Scott is a man-whore, but it's part of his charm. Michael Stonebridge is a goody killing machine. Section 20 is composed of analytical characters capable of kicking terrorist ass. Those who love action shows with lots of explosions will enjoy this series.

Scott and Stonebridge (Stapleton and Winchester respectively) do the things that we in the West wish our special operators had more freedom to do when dealing with the bad actors on the world stage. While the show is fictional, it would be nice to let the good guys go in unchained once in a while to show the bad guys we still mean business if you hurt us or our allies.

5975947,5,B00FDJGL6A,"Great writing. ...each episode ending forces you to start the next.  This series is the definition of binge-worthy!

Another aspect of this series that sets it apart from other action shows is the technical advising.  I can't think of another cable series that has such spot on tactical detail. ..the gun handling,  attention to mag reloads,  use of cover,  movement,  region and demographics appropriate weapons and skills,  etc.  Of course,  the heroes/bad guys hit ratios are out of whack,  but that's just Hollywood (or South Africa, in this case,  I believe)

5976009,5,B00FDJGL6A,"The Entire 'Strike Back' season series is on the far end of the 'exceptional' scale.  It never comes near the 'average' scale, so I don't know about that end of it - but the ENTIRE series, like 24, and few others, lands out in the 'exceptional' -- Oh, right, nudity, I forgot, I recommended it to a friend and he pointed out the nudity - and so that needs to be mentioned - I don't know much about little kids so never think of it.  But even some adults are offended.  I think THIS would have been better without - but that doesn't make it any less exceptional.  And, if you want to rip it apart, mostly it's female nudity so perhaps it leans towards sexism - but that's not why I watched it, it wasn't what I thought at the time, so I'll mention it, and pass it on by since it has nothing to do with the quality of the series.",1475539200,,827,4.0552147239263805

5976090,4,B00FDJGL6A,"Good series continuation.  The dialogue is not highly deep, but definitely entertaining and this show isn't aiming to be cerebral anyway.  The military tactics are at least realistic, albeit only the ""bad guys"" seems to consistently die unless it's a contrived ""good guy"" killing.  The plausibility of the scenes and the rapport between the characters are what drive the series that necessary complete realism.  Since this is a British production, the American is stereotypically written with lots of profanity, sexism, and machismo; however, Sullivan Stapleton does a great job of giving some dimension to this character.",1474761600,,622,5.447916666666667

Hard Core non-stop action set in a ""Semi-Real"" environment of today's sad state of thereal world and the non-stop terrorism that we are fighting against every day.

The only distraction from quality for me is what seems to be the need to insert gratuitous sex scenes that have no purpose into every single episode.
Other than that one detractor, thumbs up all the way.

First rate acting by all.

Scott start the season on a break from the wear and tear of their constant efforts to protect lesser mortals from global terrorist. I have stated before that if one is willing to suspend belief Strike Back has enough adrenaline to keep action fans fueled for a non- stop adventure. Season three gives us a new team commander in Ltc. Philip Locke (Robson Green) as well as the return of the Mosad agent Rebecca (Lyne Renee) who owes Scott her life(twice) but just cannot turn her back on the deadly lifestyle of a Mosad agent. The addition of Kim Martinez (Milauna Jackson) as a DEA agent is welcomed. She teams up with Sgt. Julia Richmond (Michelle Lukes) and what a team they make, these women are a deadly combo that never shy away from the rough stuff. The season also does not shy away from dispatching some of the regulars but this review will not offer any spoiler alerts.

5976341,5,B00FDJGL6A,"Exciting, as usual. My disappointment is in that I must now pay to watch the next season. That's my main beef with Amazon Prime videos. I get hooked on the first four seasons (fairly consistent with the seasonal count) and then they surprise me with a hefty fee to see the next. Otherwise, I just hang in the mid air of suspense or, as quickly as possible, forget that I ever saw any of the episodes. I recently experienced this with ""The Americans"" as well. Being a teacher I have some additional time available to kill some brain cells while staring intently at the screen exploding with action that I can experience only in this manner. (Not that I would want to actually live it.) What a disappointing ending to an otherwise thrilling venture into my own world of fantasy!",1472774400,,776,4.55

The producers have done their homework with regards to how SpecOps teams work (vs. ""24"" where Jack Bauer's weapon handling skills would have gotten him killed), their weapons, etc., which adds to the entertainment value of Strike Back. (And you don't have the blatant advertising of 24 where Chloe was talking about Cisco this and that or close ups of Cisco phones.)

Acting and script may be just a little weak from time to time and the soft porn scenes (not quite to the level of Game of Thrones) and language make it unsuitable for children, but, for adults into this genre it is the best going right now.",1470873600,,719,4.565891472868217

5976730,5,B00FDJGL6A,Love the way they show the gritty side of living at the sharp end of the spear.  Life isn't all glamour and the heroes don't always ride off into the sunset.  There is an emotional toll it takes and they do a decent job of catching this.  It also does a good job of capturing the brotherhood between those who's life relies on the other so much.  The joking and robing they give each other is very true.,1468800000,,403,4.128205128205129

5976905,3,B00FDJGL6A,"The entertainment is there, but the flaws in the show kill the magic for me. Guy loses his rifle scope, then its reattached in 2 scenes later, boat is traveling in a river, and just to the right, at the edge of the frame you can see a wake from another boat (they were supposed to be alone). Cliche fireballs from RPG's, lingo is not accurate, oh, and the best one... female DEA Agent has her eye up against her scope, like brow pressed against it lol! They are also using reflex sights like they are 3x magnification... Dude swims out to ""Steal a boat"" he somehow catches up with it (swimming) while it's traveling at 20 knots. I could go on forever. Lame lame lame. If someone is going to make a film that has heavy combat, please please please spend the money on some subject matter experts and consultants. I am not the type of person to pull the ""I'm cool cause I know about this stuff, so I am going to point out how everything is wrong so I can show off how much I know"", but if you are going to make a show that is geared towards people who are into this story line, chances are they will have some first hand experience in the real world. Even guys who are just into weekend warrior target practice will find the show ruined for them. When there is a large compilation of fails like this, you cant get into the show because you are reminded that it's fake every 5 seconds, which causes you to not be able to get into the characters or the story...",1468022400,2,1456,4.203571428571428

5977039,3,B00FDJGL6A,"Violent, violent and violent, did I write violent yet? Each episode is three quarters filled with from many sides of political and economic factions, killing by using AK47s and other automatic artillery, plus many stabbings in the neck, grenades blowing up houses, trucks and cars, bad guys creating so much havoc I can barely see beyond my nose, and the bad guys, if they are bad guys get injured and not killed until, until and until, did I write until?...the last few minutes of each episode. However, I understand that this show is about military Special Ops and Black Ops operations, thus violence and unpredictable situations arise and cannot be ignored, and on this show it's all for entertainment. Violent entertainment?

Did I write that I like Strike Back? I like it and I don't like it. Is that confusing? That's even confusing to me, too. I'm half way through watching the 3rd season out of 4 seasons, and I'll continue to finish watching the third season and probably watch the entire 4th season, not because of the violence and the bad guys not getting killed, but because I get to see clips of countries that I will never visit.",1466899200,2,1143,4.715

Spoiler Alert: I'm not sure if this is a complaint or not but they have no problems killing off major characters. I just get to liking someone and BANG, a bullet to the head.

5977114,5,B00FDJGL6A,"Strike Back's third season does not disappoint! It is every bit as well-written and well-acted as the two seasons that preceded it! One of the things that makes the Strike Back series so compelling is that all the situations feel frighteningly close to recent political possibilities. What is more, it is impossible not to care about the characters in the stories. Their relationships have been evolving over the course of their ""adventures"" in a way that is both natural and believable. What is more, from the first episode of Season 1, Strike Back has shown that the lives of all their characters are in jeopardy!

Sullivan Stapleton and Philip Winchester continue to be incredible as Sgt. Damien Scott and Sgt. Michael Stonebridge, the heroes of Section 20! In their efforts they have been joined by Michelle Lukes as Sgt. Julia Richmond, Milauna Jackson as Sgt. Kim Martinez, and Robson Green as Lt. Colonel Philip Locke.

The only problem with Season 3 of Strike Back is that it is the last season to be included with Amazon Prime (to-date, anyway). We will be delighted when the Prequel Season and Season 4 of Strike Back join the other seasons on the Amazon Prime list!",1466640000,,1176,4.816831683168317

Small British special forces squad based teams try to infiltrate the bad guys compounds all around the world in an effort to stop terror plots from coming to fruition. The characters are great.

But the big drawback is the extended shooting scenes with everyone firing and firing and firing and firing and firing (did I mention firing?) with the bad guys missing and the good guys hitting. A bit silly, that. More subtlety is needed, more hand to hand, more tricky stuff, more cons, more cleverness, more wiliness; less in your face-looking-down-the-auto-gun brute force...that gets really boring. I am fast forwarding through some of the endless shooting scenes. Otherwise it is a fast moving show that never drags or lags. The two heroes are great together, as is the support staff, which became more of a family this year. Too bad about Dalton. Dalton is really interesting.",1466294400,,733,5.066115702479339

5977263,4,B00FDJGL6A,"So first things first, you're probably not watching Strike Back Season 3 without having watched seasons 1 and 2. The good news for you is that season 3 of Strike Back is as good or better than the first 2 seasons, primarily because the focus remains on action, excitement and the bromancing of the two principal characters with a seemingly higher budget. For all its modernity, this series is basically a throw-back to the old serial westerns of yesteryear: except the horses have been traded in for Range Rovers, saving Ms. Nell's ranch every week has become saving the world, and the mustache twisting villain has become a terrorist.
But the henchman who can't shoot and must die are amazingly plentiful; each episodes cliff-hangs you with a slightly newer version of having someone tied to a rail-road track; and our heroes are usually the only ones available in the entire of the world who can ride in and save the day.
But I personally am willing to buy into this show and suspend some,if not most, of my logic because they manage to bring just enough sophistication to the plot lines and just enough earnestness to the action and overall approach so its enjoyable television. I end up pulling for the characters and the show as a whole because it feels as though, given the restraints of doing TV;  they're giving it a go here for the fellas. And it's a fun show for a guy...Stuff explodes people! Every episode bros! And they occasionally do Cinemax late night scenes, but that aspect seems to be less emphasized this season in favor of spending more of the budget on flipping fiery cars and location shots of exotic cities.
In other words, when I watched Season 3 in my favorite chair, beer in hand, I felt a little classier than I did in season 1 and 2. It was like I was drinking a fancy craft beer not just some mass market domestic, but occasionally I'd remember: it's still just beer.",1466035200,,1897,4.595870206489676

5977267,5,B00FDJGL6A,"For someone like myself who has been there, and done that, around the world, It is nice to see familiar not so touristy places.
Mike and Scott should just carry soldier mounted mini guns, with drums of ammo. And let the smoking hot females, do all the important, extremely tedious, and  time consuming technical work.
However, everyone of the high vis targets they are supposed to capture, always end up dead.

5977272,5,B00FDJGL6A,"I love this show.  One of the most realistic  special ops combat shows ever made.  Being a former Army Ranger back in the day I marvel at the way the show takes great care in tactics and movement.  The fire and maneuver segments are almost out of a training manual or movie from Ft. Benning.  If you look at the credits you would not be suprised because their advisors are SAS and former South African Special Ops folks working as Military Advisors.  The writing and portrayal of characters is amazing.  You really develope a kinship with Damion, Mike and the Team.  The bad guys well lets just say I would not want to meet any of them on a dark night without a whole lot of back up.

OK, get real, fast moving boat. Even with and RPG7, 500 meters with a maximum velocity of 295 meters per second,  the fuze is set at a maximum range at 920 meters. Well that final shot was just too Hollywood. The round probably had the distance, but even with the optics, the bad guy's aim point just would not have made it. Oh well, that's show biz. I'll still watch.",1464393600,,546,4.25

5977809,5,B00FDJGL6A,"This is a big, loud, swaggering, macho show - neither high class nor totally low brow, but somewhere in between.  And (I'm somewhat reluctant to admit) it's pretty great entertainment.  Even for a TV snob like me.

Production values are amazing for a TV show; it looks like a theatrical action movie.  The writing is better than expected and the characters, though definitely cliched (straight-laced, soft spoken Brit paired with ultra-patriotic, trigger-happy American sex hound) are likable enough to keep you engaged.

Yes, the American guy slept with nearly every woman within breathing distance, but at least those women were his equals in the ass-kicking department. (And if you're sensitive to nudity/sex, be warned: it's frequent and it's full-on.)  No damsels in distress here, and I say good riddance; it's one of the primary reasons I kept watching.  The women held pivotal roles and they sometimes did outshine the guys.

Each season our heroes get shipped off to a new, exotic place to do battle with a new, exotic bad guy (or gal), where mayhem ensues.  It's actually more nuanced than that, yet this is pure fantasy nonetheless.  You will have to suspend disbelief quite a lot, but you won't really mind - it's all so appealing to watch!  Everyone's gorgeous and likable, and the locales make you want to jump on a plane, stat -- all of which balances the show's pervasive darkness (violence, betrayal, key characters dying, etc.) quite nicely.

The word is ""entertainment"" and if that's what you watch TV for, you won't be disappointed with this one.",1464134400,,1566,4.957854406130268

5977919,4,B00FDJGL6A,"Introduced to this show through two free seasons on Amazon Prime.  It is the European standard for entertainment, lots of nudity, explicit sex, weapons, and locations all over the world.  It is a Aussie portraying an American Delta Force operator, and an SAS operator as the front men on a special ops team that presumably is able to hop borders and deal decisively with all kinds of terrorist situations.  I don't believe everything I see, but the locations are amazing, and the two guys who star are pretty nice to look at with or without clothes.",1457740800,,549,4.697916666666667

  this series moves so fast and the plot is always intriguing.  sometimes, a little more research and common sense would get the characters out of the intense situations, but it is a movie.  as we watch this series, there must be times when the main characters have to take a break, but the series moves so fast.  it is always difficult to see the brutality in war situations, but it is even more difficult to see it happen to some of the characters in this series.  no spoiler alerts here...  but, the characters will develop as they have and begin to work quite well together.  the action, as always, is very intense.  can't wait for season 4.  an excellent series and cast.",1452124800,,683,4.479674796747967

I would not recommend watching this with your kiddos or parents (or anyone else that you'd like to shield from lots of violence and racy sex scenes).

5978040,5,B00FDJGL6A,"I continually cringe when watching action films at the often pathetic and sophomoric depiction of martial skills of characters we are supposed to believe are elite operators.  This series however, absolutely blew me away.  Yes anyone can nitpick and I make a hobby out of being hypercritical of poorly researched or executed action sequences that undermine my suspension of disbelief....Strike Back however........deprived me of this diversion.  Yes, it is a TV action drama with all the attending limitations and requisite cliches.........however.....the weapons handling, building clearing and close quarters battle sequences in this series are executed with an eye to authenticity I am not sure I have EVER seen in a television show. BRAVO!!  I involuntarily stood up in my living room and applauded on more than one occasion at the brilliant execution of many scenes. Not only that, but you know when you feel like you want to yell at the character, or throw pizza crust at the screen over a stupid mistake or idiotic oversight?  I did this while watching this show on a handful of occasions...........but.........to my surprise.........the character DID IT ON QUE almost as if the writers/directors/tech advisors were winking at those in the audience they knew would be paying attention to such details... Absolutely  Brilliant. If you like Commando Operas.....Strike Back is a MUST SEE.  Yes, Virginia, The Good Guys WILL shoot an unconscious or wounded terrorist in the head to make sure they are dead, and yes they WILL shoot the bad guy in the back when he least expects it...and yes, they are still the Good Guys.  Unfortunately this is the last season of this show, but both of the main actors were so impressive in this series they landed prime time network gigs Blindspot and The Player, also on amazon on demand. Television is now officially awesome. EDIT:  I spoke too soon! I had been led to believe this was the last season.....but there are 10 more episodes of season 4 now available! YAY!!",1447027200,,2008,5.042296072507553

My son is very interested in weapons designs and was very impressed with the shows representation and use of each platform.
While we liked the story lines and the bad guys we even an element and drew us in, we felt the ""one nudity scene"" per episode was just a little forced. In contrast the representation of strong female roles was a very nice touch.
We like that the lead actors are appearing in new shows and wish the the best...
The final episode was a ""shark jumper"" and without giving a spoiler alert the last action scene was over the top and completely over the top...a knife used in the right was would have gotten the job done just fine and quietly. ...",1446249600,,819,4.394736842105263

The 2 chief actors have the look & feel of what special forces soldiers should look like. They are big and strong. As actors they were well trained in all the movements made in shooting automatic weapons in a fire fight. They are also very personable, very likable heroes.

Put the main characters into a tight spot and have them shoot themselves out of it, against superior numbers. It does not get more realistic the umpteenth time around.

5978190,3,B00FDJGL6A,"I am a HUGE fan of the strike back series. The first two seasons had me on the edge of my seat. I could possibly rate it as one of my favourite TV shows of all time. It's smart, action-packed and has great chemistry going on between the leads.

I was waiting with great anticipation for the 3rd season after seeing the first two on PRIME. I pre-ordered my blu-ray and even had a countdown going on in my home with the hubby to mentally prepare for how awesome the third one was going to be. What a let down. I'm sorry to report that things got much dumber in season 3. What made Strike Back different was the formations and the sharp movement, choreography and team work. They had fantastic communication between the leads. They worked off each other brilliantly. Season 3 turned into this bombastic and by the numbers Jack Bauer type crap. I hate American-style television because it's extremely condescending. Nothing makes sense. They don't even try and they just throw in plot points to hurtle the show forward. I hate that. I hate it when people make mistakes that belies their character. Worthy adversaries are taken out because they make dumb moves. Formidable bad guys are dispatched without much fanfare. Dumb moves by team members don't cost them their lives. They changed up the humour tone as well in this season. It's much more base, targeting adolescents. I loved that Stonebridge was the silent soldier. Strong. Unwavering. Now they have him doling out lame jokes. He's a great guy and good actor. I wish they would just write him better material to work with. Damien gets some great lines every so often, or at least he pulls off his jokes a bit better.

I know Season four is the final season. I am not looking forward to its release. It's a shame. They had something great going here. I wish they didn't have to dumb things down and get rid of what made it special. I can watch dumb movies in the cinema anytime here in America. They lost their edge by not utilizing the great athleticism of Stonebridge, powerful teamwork capability of Scott & Stonebridge ( I LOVE LOVE LOVE the formations and action sequences in Seasons 1 & 2), the sleek dialogue that doesn't say more than is necessary and just focusing on getting sh*t done.

What a shame.",1441238400,4,2262,4.580246913580247

5978220,5,B00FDJGL6A,"Long time watcher of Strike Back (""SB"").  SB is to guns what Spartacus was to swords.  Pure wall-to-wall action with multiple gunfights every episode.  Although sometimes the action is improbable, i.e. Scott and Stonebridge wear ""hero armor"" while poorly trained henchmen rush headlong into their gunfire, it's generally very well choreographed and far superior to anything else on TV and most Hollywood films.  Scott and Stonebridge have an affable, sarcastic and easy chemistry while demonstrating believable tactical sense.  I can't think of another show where two characters clear rooms, cover each other, call out mag changes and actually reload.  Not to mention the ladies of SB are just as good.

Kudos to Phillip Winchester for doing such an authentic sounding British accent.  I didn't realize he *wasn't* British until I checked IMDB.  I think SB Season 3 (or Season 4 if you count the prequel) is one of the strongest in terms of plot, action, and global filming locations.  It's better balanced than the plodding Season 3 (although I loved Tywin Lannister) and more action heavy than Season 2.",1440720000,,1105,5.122905027932961

After watching only the  first  4 episodes I feel  I have to leave a comment .  As much as I like and enjoy watching the  series , good story line , action sequences etc , the one issue I have is the ""Laddish"" dialogue  between the two main characters , it lowers the standard of what is an excellent series, everything to them  has to  be made into a joke and lowers the tone of the series.

StrikeBack lives in the same place -- complex layering, with high production values -- but it's a lot grittier than MI-5. I like the characters, though I can't say that I'd know any that have ever fit in my life or real personal experience. The portrayed power of female leadership, let alone fighters, is admirable. Tough women. Tough men. Rough work. As in 24, or other dizzyingly fast paced crime or espionage / counter terroristic programs, StrikeBack acts as a kind of labyrinth around central characters, their survival and demise and their interplay against, in a season, one hyper threatening persona. It's rough and physically intense work -- these people are fit.",1438992000,,747,4.984

5978317,5,B00FDJGL6A,"Strike Back follows the adventures of Michael Stonebridge (a British special forces soldier) and Damian Scott (former U.S. Delta Force) as they battle terrorists and worldwide threats while working together in an elite British covert unit called ""Section 20""  I've followed Strike Back since it premiered on Cinemax 4 years ago and in my honest opinion it is one of the best adrenaline rushes on TV with movie quality production value, great buddy chemistry and action galore.

Season 3 picks up months after the events of season 2 when Stonebridge and Scott are on vacation together in Northern California and are called back into duty to locate a terrorist named Leo Kamali.  Kamali is a high ranking member of a middle east terrorist cell and is responsible for the death of a member of section 20.  Section 20 head Rachel Dalton (Rhona Mitra) has been hot on Kamali's trail and asks for Stonebridge and Scott's help along with Sargent Julia Richmond.  The season also introduces 2 new members including Colonel Philip Locke (Robson Green) and DEA agent Kim Martinez (Milauna Jackson) and let's just say they are solid additions.  The season isn't as cut and dry as it sounds.  There is a lot more to this story than this initial summary that I am giving.  Season 3 takes so many twists and turns in the 10 episodes.  The action begins in Colombia, goes to Budapest, Russia and even Berlin as Stonebridge and Scott are faced with many difficult choices as they discover a much darker and sinister threat to the world.  I can't recommend this season enough.  This is literally like watching a 10 hour feature film.  Winchester and Stapleton have great chemistry and you can't help but continue to root for them to kick butt and laugh along with their jokes.  I would say this is miles better than season 2 which became somewhat of a chore to watch at times.  I think moving the show from different locales definitely helped as season 2 was stuck pretty much in South Africa the entire 10 hours.  Worth every penny if you're a fan of the show.",1438128000,,2044,4.702247191011236

5978324,4,B00FDJGL6A,"I liked season one pretty much but season two seemed to drop off in the story department. Things were stretched pretty thin and were fleshed out with more action. Season three has gotten the series back on track.

Here's the scoop. A mid-eastern terrorist group has been working on a weapons version of smallpox. They have a team in place that will release this in various places and some huge number of people. So....it's up to section 20 to thwart the effort.

This has all the the earmarks of the first two season. Scott and Stonebridge in dicey situations. Down to the second saves. Heavy duty sex/nudity and Scott dropping the F bomb pretty much all the time. But here the plot is much more intricate. The Kamali character is still a mystery. Whose side is he on? And every time the near objective is close at hand, something (or someone) puts it out of reach so, of course, it will come down to a tight finish.

The plot moves at an even pace. The action scenes are choreographed well (though they're usually over the top). The acting is decent. You need to suspend your disbelief through it all because, with as many close calls as Scott and Stonebridge have, they'd be walking basket cases in real life. But they're one of the reason the viewer hangs in. You like these two. They can rib one another without any lasting animosity, and they do their jobs extremely well.

If you liked the first two seasons, this should satisfy.",1419120000,21,1435,4.550387596899225

But I know just what you're runnin' from:
And what matters ain't the who's baddest but
The ones who stop you fallin' from your ladder.""

I hear the cool-ass strains of The Heavy's ""Short Change Hero"" and I know it's time for another season of Strike Back. For the completists, Season 3 is known in the United Kingdom as Strike Back: Shadow Warfare. To them British viewers, this Season 3 is actually Season 4 (or Series 4). Cinemax doesn't count the actual first season (that starred Richard Armitage) because the cable network didn't get involved with co-producing the show until Series 2 (which was then promptly re-labeled as Season 1).

Section 20, that secretive branch of the British Defense Intelligence Service, never rests, even if its top two field agents occasionally do. Sgt. Michael Stonebridge (Philip Winchester, a Yank actor posing as a Brit) and Sgt. Damian Scott (Sullivan Stapleton, an Aussie posing as a Yank) are holidaying in California, motorbiking and snookering and wenching and such, when they're recalled and must embark on a new desperate mission.

Section 20's rampant globetrotting is a staple of the show, and so we see Stonebridge, Scott, and co. jet-setting to this and that exotic locale as they confront the latest terrorist threat. Faces come, faces go, but Stonebridge and Scott endure... or not so fast. The writers of Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, and Strike Back must hang out together, and the killing off of characters must rub off because... Anyway, new characters are introduced - played by Robson Green, Milauna jackson, and Zubin Varla - but be they mainstays or cannon fodder we can only conjecture. But no one is safe, and I love that about the show. The threats are credible and real life. The villains aren't messing about.

The projected big bad is al-Zuhari, elusive leader of a terrorist cell. Section 20 learns of a plot to decimate the entirety of Europe. As Stonebridge and Scott furiously track Al-Zuhari, they match wits and ammo against his allies: a Colombian drug kingpin, the Russian mafia, and the IRA. Networking comes handy in any vocation.

In ten episodes, Strike Back gives you bang for your buck. I dare you to come up with another televised series that approaches its action beats with as much bravado and gusto. The action rivals - and even surpasses - that of many blockbuster theater releases. I love, really love, the bromance between Stonebridge and Scott, love the barbed banter between them, and the gallows humor. But Strike Back shines best when those two (and, more and more, Sgt. Richmond) are caught in the deep sh--, in the heat of battle, outmanned and outgunned. The combat is impeccably choreographed. You can tell the cast has had training in weapons and military maneuvers. Stonebridge and Scott come off as James Bond, John McClane, and Audie Murphy combined. Sgt. Damian Scott also does his best Captain Kirk impersonation as he tries his best to nail every hot chick he runs into. Cinemax approves of Sgt. Scott.

It's Cinemax, there WILL be hot dames. And while they may be objectified, at least the main actresses are portrayed as steeped in badassery. Rhona Mitra sustains an unbridled intensity in playing Major Rachel Dalton. Newcomers Milauna Jackson and Tereza Srbov are lethal and cool under pressure. I'm most gratified that Sgt. Julia Richmond (Michelle Lukes) - the unit's computer expert and my third favorite character in the show - is landing her share of the action sequences. In episode 7, she demonstrates how chillingly stone-cold she can be when deployed to the field.

While the action dominates the narrative, there are enough character beats driven in to get you invested in the principal cast. No doubt that Robson Green adds dramatic depth as the SAS legend who oversees Section 20 or that Zubin Varla as deep undercover agent, Leo Kamali, plays it ambiguous enough that you're never on solid footing with regards to his true allegiance. Sub-plots are woven in pertaining to Scott's personal life and with something that happens to Stonebridge that compromises his combat effectiveness. Hard questions are raised about that blurred line that gets crossed when in service of the ""greater good."" It's not a coincidence that this season's big bad reflects the internal conflicts that engage our boys from Section 20. In a bleak, grey world, no one is virtuous.

Cinemax would like to reassure its diehard viewers that it hasn't strayed too far from its roots. Strike Back, Season 3 comes with gratuitous violence and rampant nudity. The women are deadly and drop dead gorgeous. The action is relentless, the humor is dark, the casualties stack up. Sergeants Stonebridge and Scott, nearly burned out and questioning whether they want to keep on doing what they're doing, remain utterly badass and are showcased in entertaining arcs. Let me throw out a choice phrase or five that will make sense once you've seen Season 3: Mossad in bed with the money man; black bear breakout; ""Do we go on three?"" in Morse code; Pirogova with the vodka; and Richmond offers a beer.",1391212800,53,5119,4.930394431554524
