8168855,5,B000MGBP38,This DVD makes it easy to learn the principles and techniques for giving a number of different sessions based on pulse reading and client intake to balance the elements.  Very calming to watch and background is nice too  (in a blooming orchard of some kind!) - so - all in all a great instructional video. I watched once to just take it in and then again to make notes etc. Very helpful.,1400716800,,387,4.361111111111111
8168856,5,B000MGBP38,Different approach for me than I had previously understood.  Very clear instructions - makes you ready to roll!  Great purchase.,1357948800,,128,5.35
8168857,1,B000MGBP38,"This has to be the worst put together instructional dvd I have every seen.  I bought this dvd just to learn some basic techniques in Polarity.  I understand the importance of theory and the history of modalities, but to not have the techniques grouped together in one section is unforgivable.  Yes...you have to watch or fast forward through the lecture to get to the hands on demonstrations.  They are scattered throughout the presentation.  Which would be fine if they were also available to watch on their own. But sadly they are not.",1295568000,4,537,4.793478260869565

8168859,1,B000MGBP38,"This video was horrible.  I showed it to my class, and we all fell asleep.  The woman that narriated it was boring, and the whole thing was put together poorly.  I'm hoping to get my money back on this.",1260403200,3,202,4.128205128205129
