8373779,3,B002M9WW44,"MGM is commemorating its 85th anniversary this year with a large group of star collections. The only problem is, MGM no longer owns its own films made prior to the year 1986. Thus the stars involved in these collections are not the ones you traditionally associate with MGM. Instead, MGM owns the film catalog of United Artists and the Sam Goldwyn Company, and this is where these films are coming from. This is one of the more modern collections in the group featuring Mickey Rourke, who was a long time out of the public eye until his come-back role in ""The Wrestler"". There he displayed sensitive charm underneath an often battered exterior that first made him a star. Unfortunately, these are not his best films. The Pope of Greenwich Village is probably the best in the group, but the other three are not that great, although Rourke gives a good performance in all of them.

Disc 1: Desperate Hours - (1990 - MGM) - Directed by Michael Cimino costarring Anthony Hopkins. Rourke plays a criminal who escapes during his trial along with two of his cohorts. In the course of their escape they take a family hostage that has problems of their own.
Disc 2: Pope Of Greenwich Village (1984 - United Artists) - Directed by Stuart Rosenberg costarring Eric Roberts - character study involving a heist the profits of which are to go to betting on what is believed to be a sure-fire winner at the race track.
Disc 3 Side A: Prayer for The Dying -  (1987 - Sam Goldwyn company) - directed by Mike Hodges costarring Bob Hoskins. A rather overly complicated plot involving two crimes that go wrong with only bad options involved in escaping either of them. Hodges actually wanted his name removed from the direction credits because he was unhappy with the final product.
Disc 3 Side B: Prayer for The Dying
Disc 4: Harley Davidson & The Marlboro Man (1991 - MGM)- Directed and written by Simon Wincer and costarring Don Johnson. The weakest film in the bunch and the one that makes the least sense to me. A bank stands in the way of a man keeping his bar and he and his friend decide to rob the same bank to get the money they need. They make a mistake and wind up with the wrong shipment - one belonging to the mob.

The low price and the fact that four discs are being used rather than just two is because this is a repackaging of stock, not new releases.",1253318400,12,2349,4.483644859813084
