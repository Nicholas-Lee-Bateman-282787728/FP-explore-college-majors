8585555,5,B00CS711FQ,"For a Classic Aviation buff such as myself, the very generous use of actual 1939 race plane film footage such as the Art Chester Jeep, the Art Chester Goon, the Keith Rider Jackrabbit, the Floyd Bean Special, the Mr. Smoothie and a Wedell-Williams race plane, as well as many other Classic civilian and military aircraft of that era makes this film worth having for that reason alone.

This story about the Powder Puff Derby race is a good one but seeing the classic old planes makes this movie a special gem.",1411430400,2,509,4.593406593406593

8585558,4,B00CS711FQ,"I love just about everything Alice Faye is in so I was very happy to see another one of her films FINALLY released on DVD (this one was never on VHS).

The storyline can pretty much be summed up as Stage Door in the air - with Alice in the Ginger Rogers part, Constance Bennet in the Katharine Hepburn part and Nancy Kelly in the Andrea Leeds part. Written by Frank Wead (whose life was chronicled in a John Wayne film), it tells the tale of 3 women pilots at the Cleveland National Air Races. Yes, Alice does sing one song (there were two originally planned). Joan Davis has a few wonderfully funny lines (she has the Eve Arden part).

If you are interested in the Cleveland Air Races of the 1930s, check out the second unit footage of some of the airplanes.
Like all of the films in the Cinema Archives series, there are no extras - no trailer, no commentary, no fancy inserts, no chapters. Just the movie.",1388275200,9,908,4.3352941176470585
8585559,5,B00CS711FQ,"For those who love old movies, this is a fun movie to watch.  For those who like classic aviation movies they will appreciate it a little more.

The story centers around the women's ""Powder Puff"" race at the historic ""Cleveland Air Races"" during the late 1930's. The storyline by today's standards appears a little corny and somewhat contrived, but that's why I like these old movies.

Even though the storyline is fictitious, in many ways this movie provides a snapshot into aviation history. There are scenes showing homebuilt and military aircraft that don't exist anymore.

The film has ""good acting"" for its time and although not perfect, the film and audio quality is good considering it hasn't been restored.

The writer is the famous Frank ""Spig"" Wead. He had a wonderful talent for writing about and promoting aviation during the 1920's,30's and the early 40's.  Any film written by him is a guaranteed winner in my book. I hope they release more of his films in the coming years.

This a a good movie to sit back and enjoy on a rainy afternoon.",1381795200,5,1054,4.726775956284153
