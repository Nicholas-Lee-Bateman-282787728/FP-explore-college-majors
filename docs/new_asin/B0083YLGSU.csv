8524917,5,B0083YLGSU,"Why this series was not complete in the USA is beyond me. I love the show. Good plots, good acting. The dvd I received in crisp and clear. The sound is good. You must have a player that can play it. Our regular USA players will not play it. It was a little costly, but worth it.",1424476800,2,278,3.8947368421052633
8524918,3,B0083YLGSU,I did purchase Ironside 8 region 4 because I could watch any region. Glad that all episodes were released but none were remastered. It's too bad because all other seasons were.,1415923200,2,176,4.709677419354839
8524919,5,B0083YLGSU,I love Ironside. There is really not much more to say about it. I had to get a different (Zone free) DVD player to watch this and some other seasons. That wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be.,1384041600,5,200,4.025
8524920,5,B0083YLGSU,"BECAUSE ONLY THE FIRST 4 SEASONS HAVE BEEN OFFICIALLY RELEASED IN U. S.  IRONSIDE FANS HAVE TO LOOK ""DOWN UNDER"" FOR THE OTHER 4 SEASONS....***IT'S WORTH IT*** GREAT QUALITY AND JUST GOOD TV !!!!",1358640000,7,195,4.735294117647059
8524921,5,B0083YLGSU,"I was pleased to finally complete the whole 8 seasons.  I decided to get the Reg. 4 format as it seems these were never going to be released in the US during whats left of my lifetime (I'm almost 75).  However, I do have a player to play them on so no matter.  The first 4 seasons I have were released in US the last 4 are PAL, Reg. 4 Import- Australia.  They are equally viewable and of equal quality.  Maybe a little pricier, but better than not seeing them at all.  I am well pleased with my purchase and would recomend for the real Ironside fan.",1341100800,14,549,4.08411214953271
