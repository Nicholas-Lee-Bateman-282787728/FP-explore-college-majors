8492162,1,B0007RLG9A,A road trip across Canada and they skipped the Rockies?  That's criminal.  At least I can say I've driven through Saskatchewan now...,1285804800,,133,5.0
8492163,5,B0007RLG9A,"I first saw Mr. Arthur's work years ago at ResFest. This piece is the culmination of techniques used in those earlier pieces. He has developed a unique method of investigating his surroundings and exploring movement. I have never seen anything like it. It is an exceptional piece of avant-garde film making.

I sought out this disc when it was first released and it knocked me out. Stephen Arthur shows the viewer a seldom seen world of moments in time linked together through the motion of an automobile. In this movement the viewer connects to the world outside of the car in a very different fashion from what is typical of experiencing your surroundings through the picture window of the windshield.

On occasion film makers achieve through the frame a new way of seeing. Mr. Arthur's work rises to that level and is both a technological exploration of film and a beautiful piece of art. Through this ability he provides the viewer a unique and marvelous immersive experience.",1152835200,,980,4.862275449101796
8492164,5,B0007RLG9A,"""Tran Scan"" uses a new technique of telescopic, travelling time-lapse cinematography (albeit cinematography without a movie camera!) to traverse the entire continent from Pacific to Atlantic on the Trans Canada Highway in eight exhilarating, non-stop minutes. Photographed from the point of view of the traveller and fixed on the landscape ahead, the film takes you on a kaleidoscopic joyride unlike anything you've experienced before. ""Tran Scan"" is breathtaking in its originality, a 21st century ""Railrodder"" in cosmic zoom! Fasten your seat belt and treat yourself to the experience. And if you're Canadian, look for familiar landmarks along the way.",1141862400,3,654,5.616161616161616
