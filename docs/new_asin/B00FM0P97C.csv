I was so excited cuz Kuaui is my favorite place in the world and I thought I'd be able to just gaze out at if I were gazing out the car window seeing scenery go by along their one highway.  Not at all!  I'm stuck behind a bunch of bikers watching their butts the whole time.  The scenery is evident only around their heinies.  AND you are forced to sit through several minutes of photographs of the biking group preparing for their trip every... time... you... watch.  I'm not fond of the music personally but don't mind that since I will play my own playlist anyway. I want my money back and will let you know how the company reacts, but I won't buy a Cycling Fusion video again - it's just not fun.",1485129600,,727,4.194244604316546
