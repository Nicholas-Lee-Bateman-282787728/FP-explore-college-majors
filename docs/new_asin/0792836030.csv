140047,5,0792836030,"I loved this movie. It was funny, and inticing. It also showed what old Las Vegas is like. One of Elvis's best films",974764800,,116,4.086956521739131
140048,4,0792836030,"Ann Margaret's back, sizzling, slinky, and as steamy as ever!  She thrives heartily on both land and in water, bringing home that tongue biting, seam splitting splendor.  As always, Margaret is crackerjack and cute as a button, but this time it's ""Lights Out Everybody"" as she frolics with one heck of a sidekick (the hurdy gurdy Mr. Presley)!  This fireplug of femininity sets new standards for knocking the beejeebers OUT of you right after your socks come off!  Meanwhile, Elvis stalks around in sporty cars as the ritzy starbuster that earned him the title of ""THE King"" (before he became Old King Cole).  There's an explosive chemistry between these two lovebirds not often found in chemistry sets you might buy at the local Wal-Mart.  Elvis sings and dances.  Marvelous Miss Margaret dances and sings.  Both feed off each other as the movie progresses.  My only complaint is that the character names of ""Rusty"" (Ann) and ""Lucky"" (Elvis) don't fit the glamorous lifestyle they portray.  Life gets a little sticky when ""Lucky"" enters the stock (car) market, and this relationship from heaven begins to experience a downward cycle. It seems the more down to earth Rusty wants nothing more than a small white house with a picket fence.  Margaret's dance routines, complete with skimpy attire, will have the male ""Hound Dog"" audience throwing fits, and perhaps even fetching a bone or two.  The more aggressive types will discover that biting or chewing on their own arms is a suitable and perhaps necessary therapy for adequate calming effect.",971481600,6,1545,4.9921875
140049,4,0792836030,"I havn't seen this film since I was thirteen years of age (I was ill in bed with Tonsilitis at the time). What a delight, I couldn't believe just how beautiful Ann-Margret was (and still is, I still have a crush on her 25 years later) the way she sang and pulled faces when she danced; she was so different to the female leads at the time (Audrey Hepburn, Doris Day etc). This must be the best film Elvis made, even though the plot is wafer thin and becomes a little boring when Ann-Margret isn't on the screen. It brought back so many good memories.
Why isn't the picture Anamorphic? No 5.1 soundtrack? No directors commentary? (It would have been interesting to hear George Sidney's slant on the making of the film). C'mon MGM, pull your fingers out and re-release it again with a few more extra's, after all it was your biggest grossing film of 1964!",935020800,,853,4.439490445859873

140062,5,0792836030,"I got this DVD as a gift for my dad, and we enjoyed watching it together. Elvis Presley stars as a professional racecar driver who comes to Las Vegas to compete in a race. He meets Ann-Margret (starring as a swim instructor) and soon the two fall for each other, although they face some disagreements and personal differences along the way. The race itself occurs near the end of the movie, and has some cool racing scenes and vintage exotic cars. Very fun movie, it has something to offer for everyone - singing, romance, action - and of course, Elvis!",1515110400,,553,4.54

140068,4,0792836030,"What stuck me was how bad an actress Ann-Margret was. As long as she's dancing and singing, she's okay. It's such a period piece and throwback to Vegas a long, long time ago.

140115,4,0792836030,"A FUN excuse for more than a few great musical numbers from 2 well matched talents. Like all his musicals of this genre its a bit cheesy and (for today) very  misogynistic. Women are just sexual objects... a reflection of the times. UN-like his other musicals that always had a 'good girl', your not so sure about Ann Margret, she acts good but shes a bit to smoldering to totally believe that. Nothing great but lots of Fun, moves quickly, the stars have a serious connection and charisma for days. Elvis was a natural on the screen, its a shame the studios (after a few serious movies) found this silly 'templet' for all his movies and deprived him of a solid acting career. He could have done some really great stuff. But the public wanted this sexy singing Elvis. To bad!",1469664000,,775,4.49645390070922

This version is much cleaner compared to my current TCM DVD version. The image touches both the left and right edges of the screen and black bars ""typical letterbox issue"" on the top/bottom of the video. The TCM DVD version has borders on all sides. The video image on this version is super clean and clear for standard format DVD.  Also the audio is much better on this version (TCM version has monaural audio (1 channel)). I'm going to try ordering again and hope to the get the BD version. Oh, fun movie too and love both Presley and Margret (like stepping into a time machine)...",1463529600,2,734,4.5606060606060606
140131,4,0792836030,"Released in 1964, Viva Las Vegas stars Elvis Presley as a race car driver, Lucky, who wants to compete in the Las Vegas Gran Prix, but he needs an engine for his vehicle. Ann-Margret plays a dancer/singer and Luckys romantic interest while Cesare Danova plays his competition. William Demarest is on hand as the girls father while Nicky Blair plays Luckys buddy.

I prefer the more serious and dramatic Presley flicks (e.g. 1964s Roustabout) as opposed to the farces (e.g. 1966s Spinout). While Viva Las Vegas veers closer to the latter, it compensates with Margrets charismatic performance and her chemistry with Elvis, which paved the way for a dynamic and fun musical (not to mention an affair). Ann truly shines and never looked better. In addition, the race in the last act is actually thrilling with some quality stunts.

The film runs 85 minutes and was shot in the Las Vegas area.

140135,4,0792836030,"It's that go-go guy and that bye-bye gal ... So went the ad and poster copy back in the day for Presley's biggest movie hit of the Sixties.  Elvis and Ann-Margret make the perfect screen couple in this brief (under 90 minutes) and breezy romp, helmed by the great George Sidney (who had just directed A-M to movie stardom in Bye-Bye, Birdie).  Solid character actor Cesare Danova brings along his subtle Latin lover vibe; William Demarest (Uncle Charlie of TV's My Three Sons) delivers his usual quota of cranky laughs; and Nicky Blair makes a fine comic foil/sidekick for EP.  The soundtrack is one of Elvis' best of the era, a nice blend of original ballads (Today, Tomorrow and Forever; I Need Somebody to Lean On), made-to-order movie rockers (If You Think I Don't Need You; C'mon, Everybody), and the massively successful double-a-side lead single (Viva Las Vegas c/w What'd I Say?).  Which begs the question, why was there no original soundtrack album released back in '64 in conjunction with the film to capitalize on its big box-office success?  Who dropped the ball at RCA back in the day?",1456876800,,1098,4.788359788359788

Some you can but at least one third are as good as any Hollywood production and this is one of them.

140341,5,0792836030,"Elvis and Ann-Margret were the perfect pair in all of Elvis' films.  They fell in love while making that film, and you can feel and see it!  The look in their eyes at each other, they are not acting.  (After he died, people who were closest to Elvis wrote and said in interviews, Elvis & Ann-Margret were in love during & after making the film~confirming what was obvious).  Songs and dancing are very good.  Elvis' song Viva Las Vegas became & still is Las Vegas' theme song.
Viva Las Vegas & Blue Hawaii are the top two B movies that Elvis made.
The person that did Ann-Margret's wardrobe should have been replaced!  The bra she was wearing under the yellow dresses made them look bad!  Swimsuits looked cheap also.  She was so beautiful it was a distracting shame to see her dressed so cheaply.",1402876800,2,797,4.486111111111111

140366,4,0792836030,"Elvis was always underrated as an actor and he was never given very many opportunities to display his talents and grow. He is most remembered in movieland for all the fluffy films he made, co-starring with some beautiful girl or girls, that had very little plot surrounded by at least half a dozen Elvis tunes.

VIVA LAS VEGAS is such a movie. Elvis plays Lucky, a race car driver who has come to Las Vegas for the Grand Prix. However, his car needs a new engine and he loses all his cash. So, to earn some dough he starts working at the hotel he's staying at as a waiter. In the process, he meets a beautiful hotel swimming instructor named Rusty (Ann-Margret) and the two our swept up in a speedy courtship.

Now, with that said, VIVA LAS VEGAS, like many of Elvis films, is entertaining. They are the equivalent to the special effects mind candy movies that are made today. Besides seeing The King in his prime there are four other reasons for watching VIVA LAS VEGAS: 1. Ann-Margret 2. Ann-Margret 3. The car race near the end of the film and 4. Ann-Margret. I know that lady was way before my time, but she could dance better than most other actresses I've ever seen and she was hot. The chemistry between her and Elvis is the best of any other Elvis pairing. They made quite a pair and it would have been interesting to see the two stars in more than one movie.",1396051200,,1367,4.356862745098039

140385,5,0792836030,"I don't like most Elvis Presley movies because the plots are weak and all they do is try to exploit girls as sexual objects.
The irony is that Ann Margaret is so stunning and naturally sexy that you can't take your eyes off her.
Of course the story line is weak but the second time I watched the movie it made sense. Too bad Dusty doesn't fall in love so fast with Lucky because the sexual tension between them is exciting to watch. But the musical numbers are just plain fun.  Ann-Margaret can really dance and Elvis can really sing and that is obvious.  Even 1940 musicals...the story lines were weak but the music is fun and uplifting.

Also, it is obvious by the look in Elvis eyes he is really ...seriously in love with Ann-Margaret.  This makes the film  a piece of Americana history of the legendary man that changed the culture of America and added fabulous music in the late 1960's to a generation that needed to escape from war even if for just a short time.",1391472000,2,968,4.385474860335195

And 2. when he's on her dance stage singing ""My Baby Loves Me"". Of course also when he performs the title song.

Near the beginning is an interesting number where they trade opinions of each other, Elvis liking Rusty I think her name is, and she not liking him. Of course they eventually fall in love with each other, but a car race and getting Elvis' car ready to run is more important. It was really funny watching the very voluptuous Ann-Margret get covered in motor oil while working under his car, but then she also does a number about following her mother's advice.

Despite Elvis' very simple acting capabilities  (actually, he plays the ""pretty boy"" quite well, after all, he was very handsome),  Ann REALLY shines!  I forgot that she not only acts well, but sings and dances quite astonishingly in this movie.  This film is intriguingly enjoyable while taking one on a journey to an era when shoes and handbags were the same color, and men wore slacks and/or suits every day!  It may be ""corny"", but I really enjoyed this film with no sex or vulgar language with one of the most handsome men and beautiful women of the time!

Ironically, the beginning of the movie - the scene at the racetrack was shot on the site of what bcame the Internation Hotel (Las Vegas Hilton) - where Elvis entralled audiences on stage for several years.

Ann Margret as his female counterpart was great.  Of course the music is truly Elvis.  This is a must have for Elvis fans - it shows him at his best...and let's not forget the automobile race. It's a siteseeing tour of the area surrounding Vegas - when Vegas was Vegas.  Beautiful show girls and Elvis.  VIVA LAS VEGAS and VIVA ELVIS!!

140561,1,0792836030,"I have this movie already on laserdisc and CED (the letterboxed laserdisc from 1990 is very good for its time.) I would like to comment on the quality of this HD-DVD, but I can't despite having gone through FOUR copies of it. NONE of them will even load on any of my 4 Toshiba HD-DVD players!

I've been collecting HD-DVDs since the format died and have almost every US title, but having just gotten around to watching some of them I've found Warner discs have either a very high defect rate or they are experiencing 'laser rot', where a disc may become unreadable over time. Regardless of HD-DVD ending up as a dead format, there's no excuse for this high of a defect rate. I contacted Warner about this problem to see if they might possibly replace my bad discs with Blu-Ray copies of the same movies, and was told that would only be possible if I still had the receipts and then ONLY if they were purchased from a regular retailer; Amazon 3rd-party sellers wouldn't qualify even though the discs were brand-new when I bought them. Contrast that with Universal's policy in the 80s and 90s of replacing ANY laserdisc that failed after ANY length of time, no questions asked, since they were designed to last forever when manufactured properly!

The Amazon seller I got this from has tried to help by sending replacements and will refund me for these if they can't obtain working copies, so at least that's something. Warner should be extremely ashamed for such shoddy disc manufacturing however, and even more shame on them for not owning up to it (at the time these were made Warner owned the manufacturing plant, though it has since been sold to Cinram, and Warner now uses Technicolor currently which had many problems of its own with standard DVDs a few years ago.)",1307577600,3,1770,4.63375796178344

I'm a huge Elvis fan, but this lousy film is in no way better than his previous films, except for the aspect of eye candy for the guys...in the form of Ann Margret. She is definitely the star of this movie, and it's quite obvious that the director purposely exploited Margret's beautiful face and figure to overcompensate for the terrible script. It starts off interesting enough, albeit quite corny in places (especially in the songs), but I expected that and accepted it for what it was. However, the story just gets weaker and weaker, until the end where the time span between the climax and the end of the movie is about 30 seconds. And absolutely no twists or turns in the plot to make it interesting...just blah, the end. Just an awful movie, sorry.

I really like Jailhouse House and King Creole--those were great flicks, and not just compared to Elvis's other movies. Even Blue Hawaii was much better than Viva Las Vegas. 4-1/2 stars as an overall rating??? Unbelievable. I guess all 4-1/2 stars go to Ann-Margret rather than the movie in general. If you want to salivate over a young, hot Ann-Margret, I recommend this movie. If you want an overall good movie, you won't find it here.",1276732800,5,1233,4.682027649769585

Elvis himself seems to be having a good time and so do the other actors. No doubt he enjoyed this movie more than others of the same era, you can see it in his performance.

But what really makes the film special is Ann-Margret! She is incredibly beautiful and alive. Whether dancing, singing or just being - every scene she's in glows plus she breathes life into Elvis' performance too - there is real chemistry between these stars.

140615,3,0792836030,"When one thinks of fast cars, fun women, and flashy lights - one would probably scream out Las Vegas (and I promise this will be the last joke ""I call it Lost Wages""), but not our current Las Vegas, but the Las Vegas of fast cars, fun women, and flashy lights.  ""Viva Las Vegas"", the Elvis cinematic vehicle that serves more as a time capsule of a Las Vegas that has been nearly forgotten, was a dance riddled, climactically lacking, song powered journey that may have your toes tapping in overdrive, but the overall story allows your brain to remain in neutral.  ""Viva Las Vegas"" was my first step into the world of Elvis cinema, and I cannot complain about his ability to sing or his chemistry with Ann-Margaret, but the film as a whole seemed like a hodgepodge of song, dance, and story (heavier on the song and dance, lacking with the missing-engine-needed-to-race storyline).  Running at nearly an hour and a half, ""Viva Las Vegas"" did impress me with the bold colors, the wild songs, and, well, of course Elvis, but its inconsistency surrounding the central storyline was difficult to watch.  Elvis did carry this film; Ann-Margaret did provide some eye-candy, but a first time viewer cannot help but laugh at the three minute race that provides both joy and shocking death right before the final credits roll across the screen.

Oh, the King of Rock and/or Roll can sing.  There is no question about that.  As a newbie to the world of Elvis, ""Viva Las Vegas"" was the perfect vehicle to introduce me to his whippy lyrics, his limber dance moves, and his abilities to impress the ladies.  Elvis carried this film with ease.  He was great to watch, never quite knowing when we were going to actually get to the plot, the songs he sang provided instant intermissions between points A to B to C.  Coupled with his chemistry with Ann-Margaret, which was so great that even the tabloids were claiming the two were together and getting married, our characters overloaded the senses with charisma, the old-fashioned word pizzazz, and excitement - but was more needed?  Elvis and Ann-Margaret were to two biggest assets to this film, but they were also the biggest liabilities.  Due to the big song and dance numbers, less money/time was spent on the actual story of ""Viva Las Vegas"", thus we know very little about Elvis' character, Ann-Margaret's story, or the non-suspenseful, yet extremely violent, Vegas race that is supposed to be in our minds, but alas, is never on the screen (except for the final ten minutes).  What crumbled this film a bit was the lack of balance, between characters and plot - like saying too much singing not enough dancing - where in the long run it is the viewers who suffer.  I wanted the song and dance that I had, but I wanted more development into the race that was eventually brought Elvis and Ann-Margaret together.

It is this lack of development in our surrounding story that affects the surrounding smaller plot points.  Due to knowing less about Elvis' character, it seems awkward that he suddenly looses his whole winnings in the pool.  There was no prior history of ""bumbling"", so why would it sudden begin here?  His race car was supposed to be one-of-a-kind, yet there were others like it running around Vegas, as well as in the race.  Having no money didn't seem to stop Elvis from having the ""Best Date Ever"" with Ann-Margaret, which included dancing, boating, helicopter rides, and sightseeing.  It was interesting to see Elvis' heart go towards this race that he needed to raise funds for a new engine, but between this and Ann-Margaret, it was obvious what was most important to him (as well as the director!).  Then, as we wind closer to the finish line, our Pod-Racer-style Las Vegas race is wildly intense and disastrous, that it awkwardly just doesn't fit within the gambit of the film.  Since the main plot point is getting to that race, we needed the race to happen, but what occurs to the other drivers of this race (one who looked like he was driving a convertible), just seemed to be sending the wrong connection to the rest of the film.

On a side note, while noting when this film was made, I did enjoy Ann-Margaret's anger towards not being able to help the pit crew get Elvis ready for his big race, but instead being forced to make sandwiches while her incapable father fit right in.  Created a chuckle in a very liberal room, yet somehow fit in an oddly toned film.  Elvis loved Ann-Margaret, but did he love racing?  This was the ultimate question that never was answered.  He wanted the engine, then he wanted the girl, and he settled on the girl by merely realizing that because he was Elvis, he was going to win the race.  This was the hodgepodge I struggled with throughout this feature.

Overall, it was this sudden turn of events that changed my image of this film, while others (especially Elvis fans) will no doubtably argue with my feelings towards this film, this began as a poppy song-and-dance film about winning a race, which transformed into an over-exaggerated love story involving Ann-Margaret (at times the two were dueling), with no real placement in realism.  On the other side of the gambit though, we have an image of Las Vegas that we will never experience again.  This was a Las Vegas lost to my generation, and it was amazing to see the lights, panache, and glamour of this gambling city.  Also, Elvis can sing.  Ann-Margaret can dance, and again their chemistry could not have been a stronger Hollywood pairing.  The two kept my eyes glued to the screen and tapping my toes during each of the numerous dance numbers.  ""Viva Las Vegas"" was my first encounter with Elvis, the actor, and it will not be my last.

140616,4,0792836030,"Elvis movies deserve to be considered a genre all of their own. Although not  Hollywood masterpieces that was never the point. They were a fun way of showcasing the talents of Elvis, think of them as extended music videos.

""Via Las Vegas"" is one of the best of the genre. Ann Margaret is stunningly beautiful and a great dancer. Unfortunately her singing isn't as good as her dancing, however watching the scene stealing Ann Margaret can never be thought of as a chore. One of the best dance numbers is set at the University of Nevada campus, film buffs might want to see if they can locate Teri Garr amongst the troupe.

The Vegas scenery from the 1964, including the neon ""Strip"" from the time, is fun to see. Even the desert car race, however improbable the action, has some great vistas too.

The Song 'Today,Tomorrow and Forever' was originally recorded as a duet and should have been filmed that way, with the associated love scene expanded and a little filler added before 'Cheek to Cheek.' The Wedding Scene should also have been expanded with a transition before the finale.  Other songs, one a duet were recorded but not used in the film.  Without these 'touches' the film is a little jerky, perhap partially due to poor editing but mostly due to Colonel Parker's interference.

140674,4,0792836030,"This is a fun movie as everyone knows.  RE: the DVD itself... the picture is fantastic, crystal clear.  The 5.1 audio mix is great.  Clearly some time, thought and effort went into the remastering of the film.  However, the DVD bonus material is lacking.  There's nothing much to the featurette (sort of to be expected).  My main gripe however is with the audio commentary by ""historian"" Steve Pond.  He doesn't offer much as far as info that most Elvis fans don't already know.  Worse yet, he gets a couple Elvis facts 100% wrong.  Here's the breakdown:

1. He talks about Elvis' sense of humor, explains that it was lowbrow, consisting only of boyish pranks, etc.  He paints a picture of Elvis being shallow in that regard.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Elvis did get a kick out of boyish pranks, however his sense of humor ran the full spectrum of silly to sophistication.  One of his all-time favorite movies was ""Dr. Strangelove.""  Obviously there are levels of subtlety, irony, sophistication to that movie.  Also, he was a huge fan of Monty Python (five years before that craze fully caught on in America, btw).  And -- yes -- Monthy Python can be just plain dumb, but there's also a level of subversive -- yet insane -- intelligence to what they do.  Elvis was also a fan of Saturday Night Live, etc.  The list goes on.  The point being, Elvis was NOT just simply about boyish ""pie in the face"" comedy.

2. Steve Pond points out that ""Viva Las Vegas"" was the last Elvis movie where the producers put any real thought or effort into the production.  Okay, that's a somewhat legitimate point.  However, he lists two examples of later sub-par efforts that, in fact, were not sub-par --  ""Stay Away, Joe"" and ""The Trouble with Girls"".  ""Stay Away, Joe"" was no masterpiece... but it does have its merits.  For one, it's one of the few movies where Elvis plays an ""adult"" role -- he smokes cigars, beds down women without apology, etc.  Also there's some great cinematography and use of outdoor location in the film.  It's not just a typical fake Hollywood backlot like 90% of Elvis' movies.  Add to that, Elvis is clearly having fun in the role.  He's not just sleep-walking through it like say what you see in ""Paradise Hawaiian Style.""

As far as ""The Trouble with Girls"" ... this is actually one of Elvis' better movies.  It has a great supporting cast; Vincent Price, Dabney Coleman, etc.  And, again, a nice use of outdoor locations.  Also, it's a more interesting and adult role for Elvis.  He's not some cartoonish G-rated ""race car driver"" or the like.  He plays a charming con man, the leader of a travelling carnival.  This role fit him nicely since he was something of a charming con man in real life.  And again, you can see Elvis is having a good time, he looks great, and he's not sleep-walking through the movie.

If you listen to the audio commentary on ""Viva Las Vegas"", just take it with a grain of salt... or several grains of salt.  It's certainly not the definitive portrait of Elvis.",1188086400,3,3021,4.594746716697936
140675,4,0792836030,"This is not normally my type of thing.  I don't watch a lot of musicals, I have never seen another Elvis film, and apparently, using this as a launchpad for watching all those other Elvis films would be a dangerous escapade; it seems that most of them are badly-done rubbish.

But this was a lot of fun.  Much as I enjoyed the music and dancing, and as appreciative as I was of Ann-Margaret's zing througout, I especially liked the humour that helps carry the film, even as the plot turns in merely a cameo role.  There are some great one-liners, and some funny extended shtick--like Elvis, as Lucky Jackson/would-be race-car driver, acting as annoying waiter at a romantic dinner that involves his would-be girl and his suave rival, played coolly by Cesare Danova.  The timing of the slapstick and the sharp dialogue is pretty clean at this disasterous dinner, rivaling the superb singing-and-strolling sequence earlier, as Ann-Margaret, aka Rusty Martin, leads a randy Lucky to the nearest pool where Lucky will lose all his Vegas winnings down a drain.  Overall, the scenes and the songs evoke a variety of moods while on a very tight clock.  But again the emphasis is on laughs; many of the songs have highly amusing lyrics, including Ann-Margaret singing in the kitchen while she seems to magically prepare about 5 days' worth of food for her father.

Further notes on the plot: well, it's there, working its way into the film in bite-sized chunks.  Elvis and rival scouring the hotspots of Vegas looking for one gal, guess-who, until they bump into what looks like most of Texas, rowdy and proud while partying in Sin City; Elvis finally racing (given the carefree nature of the plot, I wondered if there was even going to be a car race, or would we just have Elvis's car stalling for good, and Ann-Margaret popping out from under the hood with a wrench in one hand, engine parts in the other hand, and a sly grin on her face, while everyone laughed, started dancing, and the words THE END shimmered into view.  Don't worry, that doesn't happen).  In between the roaming beginning and the hastily-injected finale, we get a lot of muscial wooing, crazy waitering to pay off a bill (the money went down a drain, remember), shots of a sizzling 1964 Las Vegas (wish I coulda bin there), and some laughs.

I'm not about to start binging on musicals or Elvis flicks, but this was a happy change from over-complicated epics with too much sweat, blood, or tears.  A simple tale, not necessarily well told, but deliciously lost in the whimsical shuffle.",1187481600,,2550,4.729119638826185

NO, Ann-Margret for some crazy reason isn't interviewed in the 20 minute featurette about KINGDOM Elvis in Las Vegas.

Just looking at old Las Vegas before the corporations took it over, is a visual treat.  Ann Margaret is very complimentary to Elvis as his wannabe love interest.  The songs in his films were often poor quality, but not so much in this film.

If you are a new Elvis fan and want to see a high quality Technicolor transfer of a great classic romp....this is my pick for his best movie.  The only other one that came close to this was ""Fun In Alcupulco"" (sp?)

140694,4,0792836030,"VIVA LAS VEGAS is the quintessential Elvis Presley musical, filled with great songs and not to mention his most formidable female costar, Ann-Margret at the very height of her 'sex kitten' phase.

Just like many of his other movie roles, Presley plays race-car driver Lucky Jackson, who gets stranded in Vegas when his money runs out.  He meets beautiful swimming instructor Rusty (Ann-Margret) and the sparks immediately start flying.  The director George Sidney had already guided Ann-Margret through her first major starring vehicle ""Bye Bye Birdie"", and had also helmed many of the great M-G-M musicals.  He brought a great touch to VIVA LAS VEGAS which is one of the main reasons why so many people love this movie, even those who aren't too keen on Elvis.  The musical numbers (choreographed by veteran Broadway and Hollywood dancer David Winters) are plentiful but the highlights include ""Yellow Rose of Texas"", ""The Lady Loves Me"", ""Today, Tomorrow and Forever"" and the Title Song.  Ann-Margret also gets to sizzle with the elaborately-designed and jazzily-choreographed ""Appreciation"".

140695,4,0792836030,"I grew up listening to post-Elvis rock bands: Stones, Beatles, Zeppelin and later disco and 80s rock.  Elvis was before my time.  I only recently came to appreciate just how great a singer and entertainer Elvis Pressley was.

Viva Las Vegas is his best movie from the years after he returned from the Army... not so much because Elvis is great in it (his performance is better than average) but because of his co-star Ann Margret who is really at the top of her game in this film.  She sings well and dances well and just oozes sex appeal.  And she and Elvis have great on-screen chemistry together.

This film is pure escapism.  It's not serious stuff.  But it is highly enjoyable, because it takes you back to a very wonderful time -- the early 60s -- when life was uncomplicated and exciting and few problems seemed to exist.

Elvis sings and dances and gets the girls and wins the car race, but Ann Margret makes the movie sizzle and twice as hot as it otherwise would be.

140697,5,0792836030,"Elvis Presley's films were a largely a hit or miss affair, but this 1964 gem is easily The King's best (in my opinion anyway, since I know a lot of people will tell you it's ""Jailhouse Rock""). ""Viva Las Vegas"" features great songs (which include the timeless title song and a sizzling if inferior cover of the Ray Charles classic ""What I'd Say""), a working plot, and best of all, Elvis' best onscreen costar and one of the sexiest women ever to grace the silver screen, Ann-Margret.

""Viva Las Vegas"" stars Elvis as Lucky Martin, a down on his luck mechanic who needs dough to buy a new engine for his car, which he plans to compete with in an upcoming race. While working at the shop, he encounters Rusty Martin (Ann-Margret), a swimming instructor who works at a ritzy hotel. Lucky is immediately smitten with her (best line: Rusty: Can you help me? My engine's whistling. Lucky: I don't blame it.), but Rusty at first feels nothing for him (the duet ""The Lady Loves Me"" is the funniest scene in the whole movie). However, Rusty quickly changes her mind and the two become an item, until Lucky refuses to drop out of the race for her, despite her concern that it's unsafe. When she leaves him for a smoothtalkin' Italian racecar driver (Ceasre Denova) Lucky tries desparately to get her back. The film culminates with some brilliant racing shots and a happy ending.

140724,5,0792836030,"Perhaps his best musical comedy, in Viva Las Vegas Elvis was finally teamed with a co-star whose talent matched the intensity of his own style. Ann Margret plays Rusty Martin who perfectly compliments Elvis's character of Lucky Jackson. Lucky is a race car driver who is in desperate need of a new engine for his car. He arrives in Las Vegas for the Vegas Grand Prix and runs into Count Elmo Mancini (Cesare Danova) who is his rival on and off the track and are both competing for the affection of Rusty. Rusty works at the same hotel as Lucky, who throughout the film is trying to raise money to repair his car. Rusty is reluctant to become seriously involved with Lucky because of the dangers of his occupation. Eventually, she changes her mind and assists him in his last-minute efforts to complete his repairs. Lucky lives up to his name and wins the Grand Prix.
Viva Las Vegas is perhaps best remembered for the romance between Elvis Presley and Ann Margret. The romance was played out on front pages of the newpapers after the two were noticed attending restaurants and nightclubs together in Las Vegas.
Unfortunately, the romance between these two high-profile stars
did not survive the production of the film. Rumours about as to what split them up, ranging from Elvis's relationship with Priscilla Beaulieu to Ann Margret's hasty confession to the press that she and Elvis were engaged. Though the relationship did not work out in the long term, Elvis and Ann Margret remained friends for the rest of his life. According to Ann Margret, Elvis sent her flowers in the shape of a guitar on the opening night of every one of her Las Vegas engagements.",1028332800,30,1657,4.7172413793103445
140725,4,0792836030,"I'm guessing this is the typical style of movies back then in the 60s which propel music stars into showbiz.  I must say, for a film done during that period, this was particularly well made.  Elvis Presley actually wasn't too bad.  Ann Margaret is definitely talented (can sing, dance and act).  It's even more entertaining to see that this film is a blatant excuse to sing a few songs and dance a few sequences.  But I am a sucker for love stories, but it wasn't a bad use of an hour and twenty minutes of my time.
The only thing I must confess to not liking what eventually happened to the Italian guy.  How much more unapologetic can you get?
