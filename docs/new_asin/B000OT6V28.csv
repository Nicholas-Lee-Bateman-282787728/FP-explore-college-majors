8186557,4,B000OT6V28,"This dvd is a study in hilarity. 2 of the comics bget a B, but the rest give A+ performances. Todd Lynn is my pick. This brother brings it on in every performance of his I have seen. A must see.",1233273600,,194,3.7560975609756095
8186558,3,B000OT6V28,Something is wrong with the DVD.  For some reason it skips and stops on it's own.  I can't play past it.  I couldn't do anything with it.  I tried just fast forwarding through the part but it wouldn't allow it.,1210204800,,210,4.175
