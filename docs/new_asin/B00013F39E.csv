8006014,4,B00013F39E,"I ordered this set based on price $10, and I was hoping that BULL DURHAM would have extras (it has none) but the other two films do.  I was also hoping that DANCES WITH WOLVES was the theatrical 183 minute version rather than the long version (I have that and love it, but really also wanted the version that won the Academy Award). Well the long extended version is included.  So those that don't have that, this is not bad for the price! The search continues for DANCES Theatrical Cut on BluRay...",1504742400,,499,4.413043478260869

8006018,1,B00013F39E,"First let me say I am a HUGE Kevin Costner fan. But, I can't give a review because when I clicked on the Kevin Costner 3 pack to see what movies were in the pack they weren't listed.  I was really disappointed that I have no idea what three movies are included in this package. I don't want to buy three movies that I already have.  I was really interested in this item, but now don't know if I would be interested in it or not.",1073001600,21,428,3.9651162790697674
