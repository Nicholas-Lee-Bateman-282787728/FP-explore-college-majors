1975323,5,B00016XNFW,I was so excited to find this.  We adore watching Agatha Christie and have a large collection. Her stories are comfort-food for the mind.  I purchased this for my daughter to cheer her up.  It was exactly as described in the advertisement and arrived quicker than I expected.  We are looking forward to ordering from this seller again.,1246752000,,335,4.724137931034483
1975324,4,B00016XNFW,"Whhhaaat ? You're a fan of Agatha Christie in print and don't know about these gems? About David Suchet's total slip into character as Poirot? Of Joan Hickson's loving portrayal of the Nemesis, Miss Marple? Have you been living under a rock? This jolly series of English murder mysteries will be a delightful amuse-geule - but why not just invest in the entire Anthology, in which all these made-for-tv films appear? The direction is generally excellent, the stories as light as Agatha intended, and the brain-teasers just as impenetrable. There are plenty of good actors on the various sets, and you'll only end up wanting more. Like the long-rumoured appearance of Suchet in ""Murder on the Orient Express"" as well as the two other Christie novels he's not yet done. The series of Suchet/Poirot and Hickson/Marple films has been sliced and diced into so many sets and collections that you'll need to plan carefully if you intend to buy on a piecemeal basis - lots of overlap and duplication between collections, andprices all over the map. If you only watch them once, you aren't a true fan. If fan you are, though these should all be at the front of your library.",1232841600,3,1165,4.772277227722772
1975325,3,B00016XNFW,"I must say I brought these items because I love British mystries. Growing up I have read the books but never seen the movies. The Hercule Poirot mysteries was most interesting, he has a way of keeping you in suspense and keep you wanting to watch more, I total enjoy watching his series. I would recommend buying any of the Poirot series. I did enjoy Miss Marple but the pace of it was a little slow for me, there are a few funny moments where Mis marple meets detective Slack, this was most enjoyable. I recommend ""450 from paddington"", Nemesis""and ""murder at the  vicarage"", in the Miss Marple series.",1200873600,,603,4.532110091743119
1975326,5,B00016XNFW,"I have always liked Agatha Christie, this package has all that i need in the way of great viewing.",1187827200,,98,4.2105263157894735
1975327,5,B00016XNFW,"Nothing new to review here.  This is just a reissue of the first 4 Poirot mysteries released on A&E after the London Weekend Television/PBS Series (which is available in its entirety on Acorn) and A&E release (their second set of 2) of Joan Hickson's Miss Marple (which you still need the Warner/BBC Video set to complete THAT series).  If you have none of these, for the same money (maybe less) you should buy the separarte set of these 4 Poirots and the Miss Marple Megaset which combines their (A&E) ""sets 1 and 2"" into 1 box.  The shows however are first rate and a half, so if you want your money's worth, there are better ways to buy the contents of this megaset and save megabucks.:-).",1163894400,41,692,4.476190476190476
1975328,3,B00016XNFW,"This collection is not very good. It is much better to buy the region 2 complete David Suchet's Poirot set which has all 50 of the Poirot Episodes, and then you can purchase the newest Episodes which are Sad Cypress, Five Little Pigs, Death on the Nile and The Hollow. This is a fabulous set and is much better than buying the smaller sets of poirot.",1088121600,46,350,4.318181818181818
1975329,5,B00016XNFW,"I happened upon this collection at Best Buy and knowing how much our family enjoyed British mysteries, thought it was probably worth the price.  It is even better!!  Joan Hickson and David Suchet are the penultimate Miss Marple and Poirot.  These productions are well made, great for family viewing as there is little or no violence, beautifully filmed and directed.  The Miss Marple's date from around 1987 and you can't tell as the time period is represented so well.  And included are 4 of the best feature length Poirots ever.  You can buy this set used but I don't know why anyone would want to get rid of theirs!!!",1082419200,11,620,4.6422018348623855
8007358,5,B00016XNFW,"Nobody, NOBODY, plays Miss Marple like Joan Hickman. Her intelligence shined through. The way she allow Miss Marple her patience to just let the story play out as she did her knitting, and the quiet comments. ""Well, yes, you see..."" My favorite.",1499040000,,245,4.857142857142857
8007359,5,B00016XNFW,as described - shipped quickly,1473379200,,30,5.2
8007360,5,B00016XNFW,Think this actor Joan Hickson is the perfect Miss Marple. Great collection of some of the best made film versions of Agatha Christie's books.,1384819200,,141,4.916666666666667
8007361,5,B00016XNFW,"Both the sluths are great, I particularly want to get as many as I can though.  But If you just want them around this is a good option without having them all.  Lots of good stories by Agatha Christie.  Thanks  Susan",1366156800,,216,4.195121951219512
8007362,4,B00016XNFW,I bought a used boxed set and found it to be in good shape. I love these two sleuths and couldn't wait to own more.  I did have one disc that had a scratch on it therefore I give it a good rating. Had the scratch not impeded my watching I could have given 5 stars. I would buy used again.,1365465600,,288,3.721311475409836
8007363,4,B00016XNFW,I do love Agatha Christie!! I have read all the books and certainly enjoy the movies. David Suchet is perfect as the Belgiun detective. No one could play Miss Marple better than Joan Hickson. She was the best. I love watching them over and over.,1346976000,,245,4.466666666666667
8007364,3,B00016XNFW,NO SUBTITLES!!!  THIS IS VERY DISAPPOINTING AS THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION STATES IT DOES HAS SUBTITLES.  THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THIS MEGA SET WAS BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SUBTITLES.  I ALREADY HAVE ALL OF POIROT BUT THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOME OF HIS MYSTERIES WITH SUBTITLES.  WHO CAN UNDERSTAND HALF OF WHAT THE BRITISH SAY WITH THEIR TWIST ON THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.  WHAT AMAZES ME IS THEY WANT TO SELL IN THE US MARKET & DO NOT THAVE THE SENSE TO PROVIDE SUBTITLES TO THEIR DVD'S.,1331942400,3,499,4.43956043956044
8007365,5,B00016XNFW,"This is the best of both Miss Marple and Poirot to have for your movie collection as it not only is a good introduction to the two great sleuths but also has ""extras"" about them as well as the author herself.  A must have addition for any of Christie's fans.  Also the actors. Joan Hickson and David Suchet, who portray the great detectives are the best.  It is as if the great dame of mystery, Agatha Christie herself, used them as the models for her two best loved characters.",1314489600,,478,4.348314606741573
8007366,3,B00016XNFW,"So far I have watched two Miss Marple episodes.  Mirror Cracked was fine, though all have suffered from faded colors over time.  Caribbean Mystery was fine except for a 5-10 minute section in which the audio was about 1 second out of sync with the video, which was really annoying.  Luckily it flipped back to normal on its own after a few minutes, and I could concentrate on the story once again.  I am hoping that was the only disc which was defective.",1262995200,3,454,4.433734939759036
8007367,5,B00016XNFW,"I recommend this collection to any Agatha Christie fan.  The production quality of each story impresses me immensely:  A & E devoted scrupulous attention to detail in producing these shows, especially given that they are all set in past periods -- the Miss Marple stories take place in the '50s, and the Hercule Poirot stories unfold in the twenties.  I give kudos to the set designers, costumers, and location scouts for producing such verisimilitude.  These dramatizations magically bring us back to a time and place in England now long gone.  Perhaps just to avoid any disappointment for people looking for thriller movies, I should mention that all these stories proceed quietly, without car chases, explosions, or gobs of blood.  Christie set us more cerebral puzzles, relying on the attentive perception of her sleuths to solve each riddle.  But any Agatha Christie fan already knows that.  If you have not yet familiarized yourself with some of Agatha Christie's novels, it might make sense to do so before purchasing this collection, just to make sure that Agatha Christie's style appeals to you.  If you like the books, you will like the movies in this set.",1261008000,4,1166,5.0
