7578859,5,B019PKH8I2,"As a Catholic nun I have to say that the person who motivated me to pursue a religious vocation other than my deep love of God was Mother Teresa.  She walked the walk.  There is no greater
sense of happiness in this world than to
be in the complete service of one's
neighbor.  Mother Teresa is a testament
to the latter and the movie is well done
In that it captures the essence of her
spirit and purpose.  A great movie for
the family in this age of self-gratification
and materialism.  A tribute to the real
meaning of life and an authentic religious vocation.  Thank you Mother Teresa.",1454803200,145,588,4.398148148148148

7578865,5,B019PKH8I2,"This movie will touch your soul so deeply. I never really knew the struggles Mother Teresa had experienced on her walk with Christ. Serving others (mostly the poor, sick & homeless) is what she lived for. She encouraged me to do more for others than I ever had before. A Must See Movie!!

7578871,5,B019PKH8I2,"Gives an insight into the life of Mother Teresa when she started, as well as the years where she did not hear God's voice, but continued in her work any way. Inspiring for all those who wonder where God is while they are working through tough tasks they have chosen to pursue, and who meet resistance along the way. This movie is not a Hollywood film, but that is what makes it so inspiring.",1503705600,3,391,4.297297297297297

7578875,5,B019PKH8I2,"We are all aware of what a giant of the 20th century Mother Teresa became, what an inspiration she was to people of faith and of no faith, what a spiritual heroine she was. What this film portrays so convincingly is how it all began with one simple yes to God, without fanfare, support, monetary resources, planning, protection, approval from her own order, or even any clear idea of how things would work out. And what her letters reveal is that she carried out God's work for decades without even the ordinary divine consolation that prayerful people expect to receive from time to time. This kind of radical obedience to God is what will change the world. This is what the Church needs now more than ever.",1500249600,2,708,4.582677165354331

7578903,5,B019PKH8I2,"The movie takes a look at the ""dark night"" that Mother Teresa underwent for 50 years. Her spiritual dark night was caused by being too close to Jesus, the light of the world. When you get too close to the light you are blinded. This was never known in her lifetime but discovered in letters and a diary after her death when the Vatican was looking into her cause for sainthood. A wonderful film that will have you crying with compassion.",1485820800,,437,4.407407407407407

Mother Teresa, now St. Teresa of Calcutta, we loved you.  Thank you for showing the world that ""LOVE"" does triumph over any obstacle. And you don't have to say anything about your faith, but could be a beacon of your beliefs through your actions.",1483920000,,324,4.311475409836065
7578911,3,B019PKH8I2,"It's ""okay.""  I own and have watched a number of documentaries and docudramas on Mother Teresa ...maybe four or five. This one was supposed to be about her letters to her Archbishop and spiritual director on her spiritual anguish based the book ""Come Be My Light"" or so I thought.  Unfortunately, there were only a handful of references to her letters!  I would have enjoyed hearing more quotations from those letters and seen more of her personal mental difficulties she faced regarding her faith in God.  I have read ""Come Be My Light"" and wish this movie was more faithful to it. Other than that, the movie did provide a brief overview of her vocation and I thought the actress who portrayed Mother did very good job.",1483920000,5,720,4.645669291338582

7578934,5,B019PKH8I2,"""The Letters"",  those written by Mother Teresa to her spiritual advisor brought to light a new dimension to this wonderful woman's life.  It exhibited her frailties through which she fought valiantly to continue her ministries to the forgotten and the poor.  The story exhibited the power of courage and determination despite hidden problems one might have.  I was immensely moved by this story.",1476835200,3,395,5.222222222222222
7578935,5,B019PKH8I2,"Even though I am not Catholic, I profoundly enjoyed this movie. It shows Mother Teresa's heart for the poor, her battle against a closed religious system, her deflection of fame from herself to the poor, and the inner struggles of her soul.
I thought it was fascinating and really appreciated how, in the Catholic church, it appears that they reverence her higher for having had spiritual doubts and struggles, while in the Protestant church they tend to smear anyone who is not perfect or almost so.
Altogether a GREAT movie. Enjoyed every minute and would watch it again :)",1476316800,2,575,4.818181818181818

I never knew much about Mother Theresa's life, but this movie gives you a good idea of how hard it must have been to be a missionary throughout India. I love her ideology in giving all the praise and glory to God and giving no credit to herself. That is a perfect example of how people should treat one another, always willing to help someone else.

The movie reveals her steadfast faith and special calling to the world's poor despite experiencing a spiritual desert for most of her life. Mother Teresa, I am, sure could be a challenge to people around her who were willing to live the status quo. She spoke the inconvenient truth of the sanctity of all life, from the womb to the tomb. She was small in stature but a giant in faith. She shows that becoming a saint is not for wimps.",1469923200,,553,4.378640776699029

But there were many things about her life I didn't know. The actress who played the lead (Juliet Stevenson) was wonderful for the part. This film reminded me a bit of the film Ghandi, because it was during the same time period.

7579067,5,B019PKH8I2,"This film elicited many tears from me.  I loved the following scenes the most:
1. When Mother Teresa sees the poor in the streets of Calcutta from the window of her convent, we can actually see her start to hear God's ""call within the call.""
2. When Mother Teresa treats one of her first dying patients, one of her assistants says there is no hope and that the man is dying.  Mother Teresa says that dying alone is such a fear and that this man can now die in our presence, among people who love him.
3. When Mother Teresa is treating a dying man inside her hospice, the man raises his head and utters,""Why are you doing this for me? I am Hindu.""  She replies, ""Because I love you, and I see Jesus Christ in you.""
4. When Mother Teresa is tempted to go back to Loreto and abandon her mission to the poor, she puts her hand on the door of the convent and realizes she can't go back and must continue with her mission to the poor, despite the spiritual emptiness she feels.
5. Mother Teresas comment to the then radio reporter that she is merely a pencil in God's hand.
6. Mother Teresa's speech for the peace prize that includes the prayer of St Francis of Assisi: ""Lord, make me a channel of your peace . . .""
This is an excellent film.",1464480000,,1236,4.206751054852321

Comparing to the other dvd about Mother Teresa, this one is less dramatic, but way.... more depth and real to life, made you feel like you walked through some of the real struggles of Mother Teresa in her loyal and persistent following Christ's call to her.
In one single day, this dvd was already watched twice, expecting to be re-watched many many times down the road, a real story of a person walking and working with the Lord, against all odds, is very encouraging to us, to say the least.  Like Mother Teresa said in the movie: ""If it is God's will, He will make it happen.""  So true.",1464134400,,657,4.333333333333333

The fact that she didn't always feel God's presence just shows her humanity and the fact that she was a simple person, just like anyone.  It gives me hope that any one of us can be holy and saintly, and just because you don't hear God speaking to you or feel his presence doesn't mean you are not worthy or saintly.",1463356800,,440,4.214285714285714

The BBC documentary of her life, Mother Teresa, is excellent also.  Juliette Stevenson portrays Mother Teresa in The Letters, nearly perfectly.

I have to admit, I didn't expect a movie on the life of Mother Teresa to engage me but I found myself being inexplicably disarmed emotionally as I got further into it. The experience started to become about discovering the selflessness of this nun and her determination to keep pushing forward no matter what. It was very inspiring actually.

The story is the historical background of Mother Teresa, and how her life became what it did.  She went through a lot of trials I never knew about.  I've watched it 3 times in one week, and found deeper levels to focus on each time.  It was an unusually quiet movie, so I'm glad I could hear the subtle statements I missed by wearing headphones on the third time.  That made a difference!  I enjoyed it, and I'm sure I will go back and watch it when I feel times are tough.  She was a blessing to many.",1461974400,11,634,4.105691056910569

I have been going through dark times, having just lost a second parent and now being so alone in this world. I love mother Teresa's endurance, her courage and willingness to serve the poor. Her honesty about her loneliness, hardship and doubt really shook me to the core. We live in a society where we are constantly striving for happiness, success and appearances, when real peace comes when we are honest about our trials, darkness, loneliness and despair. I'm sure this movie doesn't do justice to the full life of mother Teresa but I am more interested in reading her letters and hearing from the heart of a woman who is a true testament to what Jesus said to do.",1461369600,2,754,4.471014492753623

7579131,5,B019PKH8I2,"Wow I read some of these reviews and I truly think we must have watched different movies. Perhaps I need to watch it again only with the eye of a critic so I can see everything wrong that I seemed to have missed. But then that would be like reading all the ingredients in my chocolate after I ate it. The warm fuzzy feeling would be gone and I like the warm fuzzy feeling this movie left me with.
I loved The Letters. I especially loved the acting I think that Juliet Stevenson did an awesome portrayal of a woman that received a calling on her life that could not be ignored.  Granted the script could have used a little help. For instance the transitions in time between the then and now could have been a little better but that is just a little not enough to ruin the movie. The story is the main reason for watching The Letters, not the acting or cinematography. I think that most of the world was like me and really didn't realize how much sacrifice and anguish actually marked Mother Teresa life. Although ;the movie shows most of her life as a missionary it does demonstrate her twenty years of teaching and the political up hill battle she trod to be able to minister to the poor. Without the support of the local parish Mother Teresa had to battle day to day living. She had to demonstrate true love for the people, not a religious effort ,a showing or rather a demonstration of God's love to win over the very people she wanted to help. Teh movie follows her journey though the letters exchange with her mentor. I believe a truly inspirational film. .",1461024000,28,1561,4.364261168384879
