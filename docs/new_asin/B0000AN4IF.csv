7997719,4,B0000AN4IF,This dvd might be unlike any you've seen before. this lead singer mutilates himself onstage and has an elaborate torture chamber at home. The rest of the band members change so often they included a huge family tree that has recorded very little. This dvd is WAY too short (about 20 min) so that really sucks. The music is very basic industrial but the last song on this dvd is worth the $ alone. If all their tunes sounded like that they would be killer but it seems the better the music got the farther away the singer got w/ the mutilation. Check it out just for kicks!,1211760000,,572,4.305555555555555
7997720,4,B0000AN4IF,"First off,the music is great. Dark,Gothic,Industrial style metal with some Punk and Black Metal elements. The Visuals are pure insanity,and REAL.The singer pounds nails and fish hooks into his scrotum,carves up his flesh with a blade and throws everything imagineable at the audience. Clips are edited from various performances over the last several years,all on Halloween nights. Later we get a tour of his home,which is a wreck. This guy's no weakling as he sends large sofas and chairs and refrigerators flying across the room. The Viewer is taken on a tour of the house,which was previously owned by PINHEAD and LEATHERFACE,as we see altars,candles and unholy religious icons adorning what appear to be blood-stained walls. This House of Dracula also has a hidden dungeon/torture room thru a secret door under his KITCHEN SINK!!! Literally!! The viewer is taken thru the front of the hidden room and suprisingly,there was another secret door past that,that we don't get to see into,one can only imagine what was in that room. This DVD almost serves as a blueprint and instructional video for potential serial killers. Bottom Line,,,LOTS of REAL Blood,lots of Anger from this guy,lots of self-mutilation and self-imposed torture. God forbid if this guy becomes a star,'cuz the only way he could top this maniacal act(not that it is one BY FAR) would be to nail himself to a cross and set himself on fire. Really,,pay the 8 BUCKS for this little number,it's only about 20 minutes,but it makes The Passion of The Christ look like Green Eggs & Ham.",1099872000,2,1548,5.003875968992248
7997721,5,B0000AN4IF,"This is a prime example of how rock'n'roll should be done. Anger, fury and blood. Edwin has made quite a name for himself in my area where Kettle Cadaver still remains a local band. Im actually more shocked that amazon actually sells this thing. Heres your chance to see it people. Its not to long of a video (maybe 20 minuts or so) but its packed with quality footage that will show you the darker side of rock'n'roll that MTV would rather not think about. Parents of slayer fans rejoice, Slayer isn't nearly as evil to your kids as you thought they were.
Watch edwin staple his face. Watch edwin break a bottle over his head. Watch edwin nail his balls to a 2X4.
great video, great price.
Check it out.",1096416000,,704,4.3816793893129775
