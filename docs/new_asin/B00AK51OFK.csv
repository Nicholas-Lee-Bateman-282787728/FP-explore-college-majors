The story also reveals some of the ways corporate management can shoot themselves in the foot and drive their best men away by ignoring their complaints and/or restricting innovation. When their complaints were not taken seriously, these amazing men decided to leave Fairchild Semiconductor Corp and start their own company, now know as ""INTEL"". The new company name was chosen from two phrases that described the focus of their new company. From the phrases ""Integrated Electronics"" and ""Intelligent Electronics"", the company name of ""INTEL"" was born.",1426982400,3,746,5.384615384615385

5444946,5,B00AK51OFK,"This was an informative and enjoyable documentary. Although titled Silicon Valley, it focuses on Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel as well as on Robert Noyce, who played a major role in creating and leading these organizations. Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel made game-changing advancements in designing and producing integrated circuits and microprocessors, allowing them to become smaller, faster, cheaper, more powerful, and available to a mass market. It is thanks to business pioneers like these that nearly everything can be computerized today, from phones to cars to appliances to thermostats.

I also appreciated how the documentary provided context for how daunting it must have been to quit a cushy research job in the 1950s to start your own company. This was well before start-ups were common and so there were few examples to follow and learn from.

Definitely worth watching if you like business documentaries.",1425254400,4,927,5.475524475524476

They really blazed the trail for many of us that work in startups.  This is a very fascinating look at how an idea can drive people to create amazing products while giving up every comfort and financial security.

It's engaging and well organized with lots of great footage and photographs to help convey pretty geeky and intellectual subject matter (knowing nothing about the microchip going in is no problem -- it's explained in layman's terms--and seeing the process of the actual making of the chips is helpful too).
It also traces the story of the American dream, and shows how the westward migration of technology literally puts Silicon Valley on the edge of the continent as much as it is cutting edge in the industry. Great doc from the perspective of a doc lover.",1390953600,4,737,4.857142857142857

In the 1960s, grads from America's best schools, began drifting to other companies whose products offered the best opportunities. In short, it showed why bright people preferred a challenging opportunity rather than safe employment with limited upside. In a way, Silicon Valley offered the same freedom, opportunity and risk that led to our forefathers to leave the safety of their native landds to seek success in America.",1389830400,2,559,5.153846153846154

It goes back to the 40s and 50s when the valley was filled with orchards and takes us from then to now. It focuses particularly on Robert Noyce and eight other engineers who left Shockley Semiconductor to start their own company. They started Fairchild Semiconductor and created the work environment they wanted, one that acknowledged and appreciated the input of everyone. Eventually, these engineers would split up and start other companies and the expanse of the tech industry began. Noyce was one of the engineers responsible for developing the silicon chip which the valley became known for. It is an interesting history whether you are in to ""techy stuff"" or not.",1389398400,2,761,5.0476190476190474

5445028,5,B00AK51OFK,"So much of Tech History is focused on Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, but without the revolutionary steps in computer HW design from 1957 to 1971 neither of them would have had the computing HW available to bring computers ""to the masses"". This documentary covers how a crack team of bright young engineers, mathematicians, and physicists (mostly from Bell Labs) started with big clunky computers based on discrete transistors literally ""wired"" together, to printed circuit boards, and finally the invention of the single chip microprocessor. And all this evolution happened in just 14 years!!! Also revealed are the origins of Fairchild and INTEL (as well as dozens of famous spinoffs) as these companies were the incubators for this revolutionary new technology. A fascinating film that reveals the names of the lost heroes of the Tech revolution. Robert Noyce is not a household name like Gates and Jobs, but he should be. He was to the development of modern computing HW, what Robert Oppenheimer was to development of the atomic bomb. Also interesting that both would not have been possible without DoD/NASA funding.

This film should be required viewing for all electrical engineers, computer engineers, and IT professionals. The tech revolution changed the world. Gates/Jobs are only the 2nd half of that story. This film is the 1st half of that story.",1376092800,32,1353,5.122171945701357

She was married to Tinseltown's most glamorous leading man, Douglas Fairbanks, this after both had been unhappily wed to others. Mary, Doug, Charlie Chaplin and D.W. Griffith started their own distribution company, United Artists, which gave them all the artistic freedom they needed to thrive.

At the height of fame, Pickford seemingly lived a happily-ever-after life, but like all good things, this proved fleeting. What happened to her in later years was in heartbreaking contrast to those glory days.
