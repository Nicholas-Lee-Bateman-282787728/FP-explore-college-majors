7733526,1,B01E9J2XR0,The Worst,1472774400,,9,4.0
7733527,4,B01E9J2XR0,"Some parts of this movie were a little hard to understand at the time, but by the end they all came together.  I was impressed with the skill that brought all of the elements together.  I felt a couple scenes were repeated unnecessarily, but maybe they were necessary for emphasis sake, or at least to serve as a reminder.

This is a thought-provoking movie that deserves at least one viewing, if not more.  It's not a happy, feel-good movie.  But feel-good movies don't really require thought or introspection.

I liked this movie and will probably watch it again sometime.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone above the age of majority looking for a little enlightenment.",1472601600,5,682,4.827586206896552

7733529,3,B01E9J2XR0,"The movie is alright. I guess the 5 star reviews are cast or family. After about 20 minutes I figured the plot. Overall, the movie sets a good tone. And the title is well placed for the plot. The actors did well. For a low budget movie I thought it was fairly well done, and somewhat entertaining.",1472342400,,297,4.228070175438597
7733530,3,B01E9J2XR0,A little weird but it was ok had a lot of unanswered questions in my mind but it killed the time,1472342400,,96,3.619047619047619
7733531,3,B01E9J2XR0,"This is a different kind of film, but in a good way. Strictly speaking it is not a film oriented around horror, supernatural, or sci fi premises. It is really more of a psychological thriller that contains some subcomponents of the horror and sci fi genres.  A young man, who as a boy experienced a massive head trauma, lives in Mexico. He works at a manufacturing plant managed by his sisters husband. The first part of the film is an exposition of the young mans brain damaged state and an exploration of his relationship with his sister, brother-in-law, and best friend. About a third of the way through the film the young man is reinjured. Apparently his normal intellect has been restored and he has developed supernatural abilities. This is where some thematic elements related to the horror genre in general and the supernatural in particular are introduced. On the pro side the production values, acting, and general plot theme and elements were good. There was some decent offbeat humor in several scenes in the film. On the con side the execution and resolution of the plot is a bit on the slow side. If you have watched a sufficient number of horror/sci fi films you can predict how the movie ends about midway through the film. With that said watching the film is an enjoyable experience. In my opinion if this movie had a larger budget it had the potential to be a major theatrical release. It has all the right elements, it just needs some tweaking. In terms of a guide there is no nudity, a limited amount of cursing, some limited violence, and some moderately (though not particularly disturbing) gory scenes. If you have kids who watch CW type shows like Supernatural or The Vampire Diaries then you can consider this film safe to watch for young teens and up as nothing in this film exceeds what is present in a typical episode on those network TV shows.",1470960000,12,1872,4.6555891238670695
7733532,5,B01E9J2XR0,"This movie is incredible to watch!! I highly recommend it to anyone who likes horror or thriller movies. The behind the scenes is super fun to watch, too.",1469750400,,154,4.535714285714286
7733533,5,B01E9J2XR0,"If you are a film maker, or you have interest in how low budget films get made, the behind the scenes feature is worth the price of this DVD all by itself.

7733536,5,B01E9J2XR0,"Don't listen to the bad reviews. Unplug, turn off your phones, and appreciate the adventure. Somewhat predictable for some parts but equally unpredictable in many ways. I'm one for happy ending but, in this case... Watch and see.",1485388800,,229,5.052631578947368
7733537,5,B01E9J2XR0,"Exceptional movie on a budget.  The budget is most noticeable due to the special effects and scene set ups but I thought it was actually fitting to the plot.  Actors did a good job and I really enjoyed watching Ben's character play out.  I will admit that some parts confused me until about a third of the way through but then all of it started coming together and I couldn't stop watching and wondering.  I felt the movie may be a little too deep for some. Beautiful Prison is not as superficial as what we have come to accept (and expect?) in the theater these days and many might be disappointed by this.  Myself, I miss the art of movies and often watch more foreign films due to their ability to make you think.  Like many foreign films, this does not have the type of ending that leaves you feeling that all is right in the world.  It is much deeper than that and should be appreciated for leaving the audience questioning the unknown.",1484697600,,941,4.373563218390805

7733551,4,B01E9J2XR0,Beautiful Prison provides a unique perspective on both the terror and the wonder of what coma could be like.  The superb acting and directing coupled with good special effects with a well matched score made this well worth the time invested.  The well thought out plot and character development lets this movie capture the heart and mind.

7733562,4,B01E9J2XR0,"Starts out kind of slow, but once Ben has an accident and comes home from hospital, strange things begin to happen.  We (and he) aren't certain whether these events are real or hallucinations.  Some of what occurs is funny/silly, some is scary.  It is uplifting to see Ben start to have increased mental AND physical abilities.  He seems to begin an affair with a Telenovela actress, which turns into marriage, and a new life, in which he puts aside all the pain and fear caused by his violent childhood.  Sadly, nothing is as it seems and the ending isn't what I had hoped for.  It's still a bittersweet piece about how people with differences still have worth.",1479168000,,662,4.615384615384615

7733579,2,B01E9J2XR0,"Goofy script with not so special effects.  While the acting is OK the premise of the movie fails the credibility or the suspension of disbelief starting with the cast of zombies with fangs.  No explanation of why the lead actor goes from brain damaged to normal in the movie other than being hit on the head a second time thus reversing the trauma. If your expectations are low, then this could be acceptable but I found the plot boring if not predictable of a fantasy world that in some ways mirrors reality but at the core is controlled by the main character.  The potential for being something exciting and profound was lost.",1477785600,,628,4.589285714285714

When you realize that his state of conscience changes, it gets a little weird and you realize how low budget the special effects were.  Hang on, though.  It gets better.  Much better.  For anyone who was abused or mistreated when younger, you must realize, as Ben does, that you create your own reality.  Your reality can be as the victim or as something else.  Believe that you have the power in your own mind to make your life different, irregardless of your past.  My hot air balloon was soaring for much of the movie.  The ending let the hot air escape but still a great mental journey overall.",1475798400,2,722,4.368421052631579

Sometimes a dream might seem like it took place over a long period of time but while in actuality it might have only been seconds.  If you are fortunate enough to know that you are dreaming you can learn to manipulate your dreams and you become God for a few seconds.  Maybe reality is just God dreaming.

Ben's beautiful sister wants him to move into the house with her husband and her, but Chente wants nothing to do with Ben living there. They fistfight and Ben staggers into the street, where he is hit by a car.

Ben recovers and his mind is now sharp. He understands Spanish, which he did not comprehend before. Unfortunately, he begins having hallucinations that other people are zombies trying to attack him (warning: lots of blood). He realizes he is in his own nightmare, and starts to control events. He meets his favorite actress, Jubilee, and saves her from attackers. They fall in love. Now he must decide to leave the world he has created in his mind and return to the real world, or stay there forever. What would you choose?",1501027200,,910,4.548780487804878
