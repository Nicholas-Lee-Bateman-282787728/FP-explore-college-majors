Now the synopsis.

Wow, This has got to be one of the funniest Kung Fu movies I have ever seen. And I have been seeing Martial Arts films all of my life. Training since age 3. This movie has it all, Humor, villains, funny guys, the plot is pretty good as well. I love the Paddle technique. And the villain is very fast. I have to admit though the closing of this film is so cool, funny weird, it is a must see film. I mean you have got to see this film. Its that funny, and that good.

I have many flicks with the great Kwan Jang Lee,,,and believe me, this is nothing close to his talent!!  Yes,,there is no question this is an o.k flick.  The choreography and cinematography is well put together.  However, almost all copies of the Dvd transfer is remarkably poor.  It's unfortunate watching this flick with such poor picture and sound quality,, but definately a flick to have as part of the collection!!",1152489600,,550,5.0

I have watched this movie many times.  This is my favorite old school Kung Fu Movie.  Many fighting styles shown in the movie are completely original.  For example: Paddle Staff Technique, a fight over a live chicken, and a training sequence that would put a New York breakdancer to shame.  It is pretty long, but it is the kind of movie that you don't have to pay attention to, to enjoy.  If you can't take the heat, just make sure you watch the end, because the last fight scene's ""Finishing Move"" is absolutely jaw dropping.",1047340800,3,750,4.398550724637682
