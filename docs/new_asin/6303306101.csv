You can tell Glenn and Bruno Monsaingeon are comfortable working together, and it's obvious they both like, and respect one another. Glenn's playing is outstanding and beautiful to watch. You will never forget this performance. It shows a gentle and beautiful human being experiencing the absolute bliss of music.",1090540800,3,392,5.140625

One tape has a Very young Gould in  a dark studio playing Partitas, I never heard it played like that ever on  any Recording, breathtaking! I have all these Tapes, they have changed the  thinking behind my performance.",968112000,,334,4.807017543859649
