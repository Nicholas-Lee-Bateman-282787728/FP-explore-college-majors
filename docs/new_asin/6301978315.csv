410838,5,6301978315,"This is defintly my favorite film that Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy did together. It has such lovely songs, one of my favorites being, ""The Indian Love Call."" I can't recommend it highly enough.",998611200,4,200,4.911764705882353
410839,3,6301978315,"Now, you mightn't think those are particularly catchy lyrics, yet that's the song I enjoyed most from ""Rose Marie"", this proud boast of the Canadian Mounties, led of course by Nelson Eddy. I would be remiss not to mention, however, that two other much better-known songs come from this movie, ""Oh Rose Marie, I Love You"" and the mega hit, ""When I'm Calling You--Indian Love Call"". One time they played a bit of that number on the Oscars, and I was sad to see the audience hoot at the rendition. I guess they had gotten beyond simple love stories from a simpler time like this one.  The story line is a tad unusual: Jeanette MacDonald, a famous opera singer, races up to Canada to try to find her fugitive murdering brother--very young James Stewart--before the Mounties do (that's where their theme song comes in handy).  Well, they somehow manage to carve out a happy ending from this unlikely premise, but that's what movie magic is all about!",995500800,14,945,4.652694610778443

410973,5,6301978315,"I can only really say that this movie is delightful!  The acting and singing are fun and romantic. They sing beautifully together. The background in Canada is not accurate as they start out in what they say is Quebec, which is in the east, and all of a sudden they are in the western mountains.  But that does not diminish the plot.  I was only sorry that her brother turned out to be a criminal but they had to show that the Mountie got his man.",1460851200,,446,4.162790697674419

This DVD made on demand is an excellent copy. The movie itself is about the singing Canadian mounted policeman. It's basically the movie that are cartoons Dudley do Right is based on!

Unfortunately, while the music is as always brilliant, the story and pace was relatively slow and predictable.

411129,4,6301978315,"""When I'm Calling You"" is the familiar song that came from this film. The song is ""Indian Love Call"", which is also the title by which this film was originally known. It is very, very dated, which makes it extra fun for early film buffs. The performances are melodramatic, the dialogue manages to insult pretty much everyone except white males, and the plot is ridiculous. Ah, but how Jeanette MacDonald can sing! Nelson Eddy, too, of course, but MacDonald's range is phenomenal. This was back in the days when singers enunciated clearly, and thank goodness for that, since the sound quality is about what one expects from scratchy old black and white films. Outdoor scenes were filmed on location at Lake Tahoe, which makes for interesting viewing for those familiar with Tahoe and trying to figure out where specific scenes were filmed. (Give it up! The trees have grown a lot in all these years!) The scenery is lovely, the film is goofy -- just enjoy it.",1416787200,,958,4.74251497005988

411271,5,6301978315,"I played this movie for my mother when she was entering the ""transitioning"" phase in the nursing home. This was always one of her favorites and she really seemed to take notice and enjoy it for the entire length of the film. I do believe she even moved her lips  to sing along during a couple of the songs. Aside from the beauty of those moments, I myself was amazed to see a very young Jimmy Stewart playing the role of not-too-savory brother to J. MacDonald's heroine. Yes, the plot was melodramatic but I admire the use of the real outdoors for the Canadian Mounties scenes rather than a phony backdrop. Plus, I love the costumes, especially those jodhpurs",1405900800,,659,4.53781512605042

411275,1,6301978315,"I do not believe this is an original disk. Comparing it with my VHS copy of the movie, I see the picture is much darker, too dark to be enjoyable. Also, the disk ID has number instead of the name of the movie, and the disk itself is different color than I've seen before. I can't believe Warner Bros. would put out such bad quality.

411279,5,6301978315,"Nelson Eddy and Jeanette Mac Donald were the top vocal duo of their time; and ROSE MARIE was the best of the films that they made together.  In the movie, the outdoor setting was described to be in the Canadian Rockies; but most of the actual filming was at Lake Tahoe in California.  This was at the time when there was still no smog; and there was only minimal real estate development at that lake.  Thus the result is breathtaking scenery, music, and acting performance.",1398816000,,473,4.541176470588235

I've read a lot about him in books, and he has an extensive opera background...didn't know he was the highest paid singer for his time.  Boy, is he handsome!!!

Total disappointment and totally unacceptable. Was a Christmas gift for my wife. Spending Christmas night emailing amazon customer service and alerting other consumers of unacceptably high defect rates. 1 out of 8 would have been frustrating.
5 out of 8 is obscene. I requested a replacement.

The storyline goes back to a much simpler time.  Jeanette and Nelson made movies with other people, but I think the chemistry between the two on screen is the best.  It is also a treat to see a very young Jimmy Stewart in this movie.  The music and storyline are wonderful.",1386115200,,422,4.358974358974359

411497,5,6301978315,"Again a redemption story. MacDonald's character finds her true 'values' and deep love in the wilderness away from the trappings of fame and she learns these values from Eddy as the mountie who has integrity. Eddy gives a plausible performance although his role does not have the acting range that hers does. But the songs and the singing and her operatic breakdown at the end are compelling and near perfection.  Although not filmed in Quebec, the scenery is a character too - a bleak trial for the pampered opera star. The Indian dance is clever relief but no Canadian Indian from Quebec would recognise it. Pure broadway but clever just the same. As Coleridge says, we must read/see with 'the willing suspension of disbelief"".",1379203200,,728,4.870967741935484

As typical of movies of the 30s and 40s, the plot is good and the story line is good. I have no problems at all with the story. Nice, clean and beautiful songs, especially ""The Indian Love Song"".

First, I am not an opera fan.  However, if these two stars were still alive today, I would go see them in any movie genre.
This is a delightful movie for all ages to view.  I can add nothing to  that which the other reviewers have stated that were singing the praises of this movie.  I think that even non-music lovers would enjoy this movie because of the storyline of 2 lovers whose love is almost lost.  I thoroughly love the opera sequences which says a lot for the movie.  I had no problems with the sound or the video on my DVD.  This movie is in black and white.  And, I adore Jeanette M. and Nelson E! I highly recommend this movie!

411569,4,6301978315,"ROSE MARIE (released 1936) (reviewed 2013)

Not long ago Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers spoke about a team outing to see ""Lincoln."" Kobe is a bright fellow whose basketball exploits have earned him the right to be identified by first name only, but he was taken aback by his teammates reaction to the film.

Some of them didn't know who Abe Lincoln was. And several were surprised when the U.S. president, circa the 1961-65 Civil War, was killed at the end of the movie.

I cite this anecdote to suggest that history is not a strong suit among modern generations. Some of todays filmgoers may have heard of Nelson Eddie and Jeanette MacDonald, who dominated romantic musicals in the 1930s, but don't ask which of the duos movies theyve seen. Unless, that is, you're into blank stares.

The best of the Eddy-MacDonald genre was ""Rose Marie."" Granted, its a subjective judgment, but thats why Im here.

""Rose Marie,"" filmed in black-and-white in 1936, was the second of three MGM adaptations of the 1924 Broadway musical. In it Nelson Eddy of the Royal Canadian Mountain Police is assigned to bring in a fugitive (James Stewart in an early role) who turns out to be the kid brother of stage prima donna Jeanette MacDonald.

Love ensues for the Mountie and the prima donna. As do unforgettable renditions of the melodies Rose Marie and Indian Love Call, which became a signature song for both performers throughout their careers.

As a welcome bonus, ""Rose Marie"" doesnt contain a single car chase or fiery explosion or mutilated corpse. Finding a movie devoid of those entertainments anymore is not easy, but its well worth seeking out.

Restoration of the film for DVD is above average. It has fuzzy portions early on but reproduces very well after that.

And by then youll have suspended any critical niggling to fully partake of the show. And youll be listening to Indian Love Call in memory for several days or weeks after that.

411574,5,6301978315,"Maybe because I'm not so enamoured of their signature duet ""Indian Love Call,"" I don't regard ROSE-MARIE as the best MacDonald/Eddy film. But it is near the top. 1936's ROSE-MARIE is the second of their eight screen partnerships, and it lives up to the mighty hype generated by the preceding year's surprise box office hit NAUGHTY MARIETTA (perhaps my favorite film by this pair).

Jeanette MacDonald is celebrated opera singer Marie de Flor who is in the midst of a successful concert tour in Canada. We learn quickly that, behind the scenes, Marie is temperamental and aloof and exacting, and so we sense that ROSE-MARIE may also be very much a coming-of-age story. Marie de Flor is one self-absorbed diva that simply begs to get taken down a few pegs. But we also glimpse a kernel of sentiment in her. When she learns that her jailbird brother (Jimmy Stewart) had broken out of prison and is holed up, injured, in the untamed north woods, she promptly drops everything and sets out incognito to rendezvous with him. When Marie's half-breed guide amscrays with her funds, she reluctantly falls in with helpful Canadian mountie, Sergeant Bruce (Nelson Eddy), who becomes her escort thru the unforgiving Canadian wilderness. Things get complicated then, because even though Sgt. Bruce is also tracking her fugitive brother, damn, but he's got a fine singing baritone voice. So she's intrigued, against her better judgment. I particularly enjoy the scene in which Sgt. Bruce, while rowing Marie de Flor across the river, flirts with her and then impresses her against her will with his glorious belting out of my favorite song in this repertoire: ""Rose-Marie, I Love You."" Jeanette MacDonald's heavy-lidded eyes just got even more seductive. Besides ""Rose-Marie,"" my second-best favorite song here would have to be the often overlooked but enthralling ""Pardon Me, Madame,"" an uptempo song which hearkens back to her earlier operettas in how it gradually draws in a diverse cast of avid listeners and participants.

When one mentions Nelson Eddy, one tends to laud his ringing baritone but condemn his limited acting chops. But when he's sharing screen time with MacDonald, she makes up for his deficiencies as an, whatchamacallit, emoter. Their playful banter is a highlight of this entertaining operetta. No-nonsense director W.S. Van Dyke (a.k.a. ""One Take Woody"") keeps things moving along. The only dead time (for me, anyway) is that extended Indian totem pole dance.

ROSE-MARIE spotlights a few up-and-comers: Jimmy Stewart, just before he got big, as the fugitive brother; David Niven, fleetingly, as one of Marie's suitors; and Allan Jones as Marie's stage partner ""Romeo"" (Jones would soon enough star opposite MacDonald in THE FIREFLY). Conversely, ROSE-MARIE also features a cameo by former shimmy queen Gilda Gray who, as contrived by the plot, upstages MacDonald in a comical musical sequence in a bawdy dance-hall saloon. Let's face it, Jeanette MacDonald has got too much couth to sashay salaciously in a bar.

I halfway wish that the film had been shot in color. Still, even in black and white, the exterior backdrops look amazing, never mind that the outdoor scenes were actually shot on site in Lake Tahoe, standing in for the Canadian wilds. And when you park a crooning pair as wildly popular as MacDonald and Eddy in front of such picturesque locales, well, sir, fuggetaboutit. It's over. Them suits at MGM must've been cackling like mad as the money rolled in. Except that ROSE-MARIE deserves its bountiful box office returns. Go see it, and see what I mean.",1346371200,,3579,5.061016949152543

411576,5,6301978315,"I will not go into details about this beautiful musical at all BUT will just add my review of the DVD-R. If you have the faded VHS copy of ""Rose Marie"" please upgrade to this DVD-R if possible. Although the film isn't 100% perfect the quality in both picture and sound is excellent. The blacks, whites, and grays are wonderful and the picture quality is pretty sharp unlike the VHS tape where the picture looks milky, soft, and faded. There is much less snaps and pops, although there is a little but on the whole it is not very noticeable. Also, the white dots, flecks, and such are much minimized, however, it does not take away from the film and is not annoying at all. As a matter of fact, it's probably just due to age. In addition, the sound does not need any
adjustments; it is clean, clear, and even; naturally, it is mono.

  IF anyone, like myself, who is a stickler for as near perfect DVD-R as possible ""Rose Marie"" does not disappoint. Well, maybe it does in the sense that there is no closed captioning for the hearing impaired or foreign speakers. The only extra is the trailer. Please be aware that this plays on ""play only"" DVD players and might not be suitable for certain computers yet it is a gem to own. Highly recommended.:-)",1337040000,14,1247,4.436681222707423

411611,5,6301978315,"""Rose Marie"" (1936) is the most well known of the 8 Jeanette MacDoland Nelson Eddy musicals. The film was based on a 1924 Broadway musical and was made into a silent film in 1928 starring Joan Crawford. It was re-made in 1954 by Busby Berkeley and starred Ann Blyth, Howard Keel, and Fernando Lamas.

The songs are marvelous, the scenery is breath taking (especially for 1936), and the costumes and staging for the musical numbers ""Romeo and Juliette"" and ""Tosca"" are so good you think you are watching the actual shows. The supporting cast is up to their task, and include everyone's favorite Scrooge Reginald Owen, the incomparable Una O'Connor, a young Jimmy Stewart, and if you look close enough, David Niven in a very small bit.

Jeanette MacDonald (1903-65) was a unique personality. She was a major opera star who starred in 29 films (4 of which were nominated for Best Picture) and earned 3 gold records. She was equally popular in radio and hosted her own show (""Vicks Open House""). While she is best remembered for her work with Nelson Eddy, she originally worked with Maurice Chevalier in ""Love Parade"" (1929), ""One Hour  With You"" (1932), ""The Merry Widow"" (1934) and ""Love Me Tonight"" (1932) - this last film produced such memorable songs as ""Mimi"" and ""Isn't it Romantic?"". Her first film with Eddy was ""Naughty Marietta"" (1935) which won an Oscar for best sound and was nominated for Best Picture.

Nelson Eddy (1901-67) was the highest paid singer in the world in the 30s. A classically trained baritone he had extensive operatic experience before turning to films which he viewed as a way of gaining more people to come to his concerts. ""Naughty Marietta"" was his first feature film, and the success of that film led to 18 more films, 7 with MacDonald.

Reginald Owen gives his usual good performance as MacDonald's manager, but he's on screen far too little and rarely gets a chance to work his true magic. He's best known as Ebenezer Scrooge from ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938) and made nearly 100 films including ""Mary Poppins"" (1964) and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1971). He has the distinction of having played Sherlock Holmes (""A Study in Scarlet"") as well as Dr. Watson (""Sherlock Holmes).

Una O'Connor (1880-1959) was a terrific actress who made nearly 100 films between 1929 and 1957. She was a true scene stealer and did so in films such as ""The Invisible Man"" (1933), ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), and ""The Adventure of Robin Hood"" (1938). She is relatively low key in this film and adopts a French accent that occasionally slips.

If this film has any fault at all it's the failure to fully utilize the comedic talents of Own and O'Connor.

Jimmy Stewart (1908-97) needs little introduction. This was literally his first year in films and only his second film. David Niven (1910-83) plays a stage door Johnny in one of the first scenes, then disappears after about 30 seconds. This was Niven's sixth film, but for some reason he does not appear in the credits.

Woody van Dyke (1889-1943) directs. Best known for his ""Thin Man"" films, for which he received an Oscar nomination in 1935, he also received a nomination for ""San Francisco"" (1936). He directed Eddy and Macdonald in 6 of their 8 films, and separately directed Eddy in ""Rosalie"" (1937) and MacDonald in ""San Francisco"" (1936) and ""Cairo"" (1942). Van Dyke enjoyed exotic locations and among 90 films made such films as ""Heart of the Yukon"" (1927), ""White Shadows in the South Seas"" (1928), ""Eskimo"" (1933), ""Northwest Passage"" (1940) and ""Cairo"" (1942). Eddy and MacDonald sang at his funeral in 1943.

Rudolf Friml (1879-1972) composed the music for ""Rose Marie"" in 1924. Most of his work was for the stage and he rarely worked on films. Herbert Stothart (1885-1949) adapted the score to the screen. Stothart was the ""house composer"" for MGM and scored more than 150 films including ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) for which he won the Oscar. He worked with Van Dyke on ""Naughty Marietta"" (1935).

This is a great film. It's amazing how beautifully the voices of Eddy and MacDonald are captured given that this is 1936.",1293062400,5,4103,4.822190611664296

411615,5,6301978315,"I watched this movie for the first time recently and I loved every minute of it. The scenery was filmed in the Canadian Rockies and it is so beautiful. Jeannette and Nelson meet and fall in love. There are several songs in this movie, of which my favorite is ""Indian Love Call"". Jeannette is an opera singer in parts of the movie. She has a wide range to her singing voice and at one time she holds a very high note for about 30 to 45 seconds. Jeannette and Nelson are invited to watch an Indian tribe do a traditional dance. If you have watched the movie, ""King Kong"" and saw the dance that the tribe does when Faye Wray and Robert Armstrong and the crew get off the boat and come on land, the Indian dance in ""Rose Marie"" is alot like the other dance. This dance is very interesting to watch as the tradition of the dance unfolds. There is a very heartwarming scene where Nelson stands in the front of the house and looks up at Jeannette's open window and sings to her. She hears him singing and comes to the window to listen. Their love for each other grows in this scene. Another scene shows both of them in a paddleboat and he sings ""Indian Love Call"" to her and does it with such emotion. Jeannette is following another man while they are riding horses. He enters the river without any trouble, but when Jeannette follows him into the water she falls off of the horse and yells for help. Nelson sees her and quickly he goes and frees her from the river. Nelson pulls a tricky stunt on her telling her that he is leaving. He mounts onto his horse and starts riding away with the other man beside him. Jeannette soon feels alone and she walks up the hill to the road where she sings ""Indian Love Call"" to him to try to get his attention. He hears her singing and it touches his heart but he keeps on riding. As he keeps riding he can still hear her voice. Then he hears her crying as she sings to him, but he keeps on riding. After a little while he decides to go back to her. When they meet they sing the song to each other with such deep feelings of love, then the movie ends. I think Jeannette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy are two of my favorite singers. I watched the movie, ""Naughty Marietta"", which they made 2 years before, and I quickly became a fan of theirs. I love Nelson's voice very much also. Because of the love they had for each other and the sound of their voices as they sang, I cried most of the way through the movie. If you enjoy Jeannette and Nelson you should definitely buy the movie and watch it for yourself. This is such a beautiful film. Oscar HammersteinII wrote the music for it. I hope this movie won an Oscar because it sure deserves it. The movie, ""Maytime"" is good also, but ""Rose Marie"" tops all of the films that they made. Get it and see for yourself. You'll be glad you did.",1245283200,,2813,4.220779220779221
411616,5,6301978315,"There have been surprisingly few performers in the history of movies who have possessed operatic type voices. Mario Lanza, Kathryn Grayson, and Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald very nearly completes the list, though a nod should be made to Allan Jones, who, though never a star, managed a few notable appearances in various films, including two Marx Brothers films (A NIGHT AT THE OPERA) and this film, as Romeo to Jeanette MacDonald's Juliet early in the movie, and in TOSCA, near the end.
Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy were, therefore, a unique aberration in the history of cinema history, the only operatic partnership in Hollywood, ever. They were the operatic equivalent of Astaire and Rogers, and if their films never achieved the polish or brilliance of those two, they nonetheless managed to make some very fine films. ROSE MARIE is probably their most famous, and perhaps their finest.

The various renderings of ""Indian Love Call"" in the film are what the film is best known for, but upon reviewing the film last night with my daughter (who loved it, although she found many moments so embarrassing that she had to hide her head under a pillow, especially during the movie's closing moments), I was amazed at how enjoyable the movie is as a whole. The movie is delightful from beginning to end, gorgeous to look at (filmed, unfortunately, at Lake Tahoe, instead of the Canadian Rockies), and infinitely less dated than one might expect from an operatically driven 1936 comedy. The movie was also enhanced from a barrage of excellent supporting players. Reginald Owen, David Niven, Alan Mowbray, Una O'Connor, the aforementioned Allan Jones, and Jimmy Conlin (familiar to anyone who has seen many Preston Sturges comedies) provide a deep cast. Jimmy Stewart has a smallish role in the last film he made before becoming a lead actor.

One of the more intriguing segments was filmed at an actual Indian camp. Visually, it is a stunning sequence, but unfortunately MGM in the best Hollywood fashion marred the scene with added orchestral music and choreography. And no, this is not the film that breaks the mould by having an actual Native American play a Native American. George Regas, who made a career out of playing Indians, was actually born in Greece.",1244246400,,2270,4.971052631578948

I love the movie and am slowly converting all my tapes to DVD. Once in a while it does not work out so will and the DVD is much worse. Unfortunately, this was the case with Seven Alone. The DVD was very poor quality but I had given away the tape which was still quite good. This time I kept the tape and will play it until it worsens. It has not been played too much yet. I worked in a library that rented VHS tapes and over the years found they often broken and or the color or sound faded. So far this has not happened with my tape. Any way, the DVD seemed pretty good. I just considered it an old movie with the picture and sound quality. However, when I played my tape and switched back and forth on the same scenes between it and the DVD I found a difference. For some the difference may not be apparent. I found the DVD picture quality not to be quite as sharp. The same with the music. Both the picture and sound on the VHS tape seemed a little brighter and the music also had a fuller sound to it. As far as artifacting went the DVD seemed to have not much more if any more than the tape. I also noticed some jittery movement in the picture on both. It made me wonder if they has produced the DVD by coping the tape playing. Just a guess. It would be somewhat like the DVD was made for the musical of Cinderella with Julie Andrews. I still found the picture very enjoyable just not quite as. It just wasn't quite right for me. I would still buy it if you love the movie and cannot get a reasonably priced NEW VHS tape.",1192233600,,1737,4.067055393586005
411660,5,6301978315,"If ever a film deserved the label ""classic romance,"" Rose Marie is the one.  It starts out kinda slow, but gradually builds to a heartwrenching climax.  Marie de Flor (Jeanette MacDonald) is an opera star who learns her brother, John Flower (James Stewart) has escaped from prison, allegedly killing a Canadian Royal Mounted Police in the process, and is in hiding.  De Flor hires an Indian guide to take her to  him.  Along the way into the Canadian wilderness, she meets up with Sgt. Bruce (Nelson Eddy),  the Mounty tracking down her brother.  She starts to give him a false name, ""Rose . . ."" but he recognizes her as a star, and assumes her full name is Rose Marie de Flor.  Sgt. Bruce is immediately attracted to de Flor, but before long he guesses her relationship Flower, his prey.  It's one of the all time classic dilemmatic situations as love develops between the two, who are each using the other to their own, opposite ends.  De Flor depends on Bruce  to survive the rugged trek through the wilderness, not knowing how much he knows; he expects her to lead him to her brother, while pretending to be along to protect her.  I don't think it's ever been done more effectively, with ""Indian Love Call"" adding a haunting effect all the while.  The cast also includes Reginald Owen, Alan Mowbray, Una O'Connor, and David Niven in an early, one scene, bit part.",1132531200,13,1368,4.603305785123967
411661,5,6301978315,"There is poignancy at the heart of this movie.  It's a love story and love comes at a high price.  Rose Marie, like many Eddy-MacDonald films, is filled with love and loss, yearning and sacrifice.  The final scene of Rose Marie demonstrates these characteristics perhaps better than any of their other movies.  This is a fine film, but it is dated and should be viewed in the context of its time.  There are laughs, romance, bittersweet moments and beautiful, heart-felt singing.  The MacDonald-Eddy chemistry is magical. This is a movie that should not be overlooked or forgotten.  It will stay with you after you've seen it.",1093305600,6,626,4.849056603773585
411662,5,6301978315,"Rose Marie has it all. Wonderful music, a great story. Good clean entertainment. As for acting, this is Jeanette's and Nelson's best. It is also the first movie Jimmy Stewart was in.
2 of my favorite scenes is when Jeanette and Nelson are in the canoe and he is singing to her. They other scene is she is hungry and he his cooking beans. The looks on their faces are perfectly acted.",1072742400,7,383,4.333333333333333

Being part Apache myself, it's fun to watch the strange way Indians, in this case Canadians, are portrayed in this film.  I was not offended.  I don't even mind that the ""half-breed"" character was played by a Greek actor.  There's too much to like here.  A little romance blown up to universal proportions is fun sometimes.  There's always something new on each viewing.  I hope we're not too jaded and cynical today to get lost in a little light romance.",1060214400,10,542,4.5625
411664,5,6301978315,"I don't know what kept me away from this movie so long. I'd seen it so many times browsing the shelves at the library, but had no idea who was in it or what it was about. Then I saw The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met, got entranced with baritones all of a sudden (yes, me the tenor fanatic), and decided to see some of Nelson Eddy's movies... the first one was The Phantom of the Opera, which I have reviewed separately, then I saw The Chocolate Soldier and I Married an Angel, which I shall review separately later, and then this one. Besides the fact that Nelson cuts a dashing figure in the spiffy uniform (okay, so the britches ARE a bit weird), I found it an incredibly touching, sweet little story, and also enjoyed all the songs. Coming from me that says a lot, because I am not in the least a musical fan - there are very few musicals I count as favourites.
Nelson and Jeannette have the ability to be very spontaneous in dialogue and work very well together, even depsite the fact that Nelson can be rather stiff at times - his singing more than makes up for it.
One thing I found particuarly striking was the scene toward the end when Jeannette is singing ""Tosca"": she is literally cracking up. We can hear what she hears - Nelson's Indian love call - and feel the discord between it and the words she must sing on stage. It reaches a pitch and then she faints.
I also felt that for a lightweight piece of ""fluff"" the character development wasn't half-bad, either - Right from the beginning it's well-established that as far as Jeannette is concerned the entire world revolves around her, so as the movie progresses it's good to see how Jeannette turns from a selfish, slave-driving diva to a sprightly, energetic, loving human being. Not everyone has the opportunity to cross the Canadian mountains with a mountie (unfortunately!), but I'm sure that figuratively there is something like that in each person's life, some backwoods experience that creates real character because of the necessity of facing adversity, learning what sacrifice and love are all about, and that life isn't all ""me"", and sometimes we have to eat bacon...
I found the totem pole dance scene rather amusing as well. I was very into Indians for a long time as a child, and learnt quite a bit about them, so it struck me funny that this tribe had it all - the totem poles of the Pacific Northwest, the feathered headdresses and tipis of the Plains... Still, it was an interesting sequence, despite the fact that it was very 1930's Hollywood and far from authentic.
James Stewart's small role as Jeannette's brother was fine as well - it was interesting how he really was only on screen for a few minutes, but all through the film, you were seeing the wanted posters and thinking about him to a point where he was really a main character.
I recommend this film very much, along with The Chocolate Soldier, which is another truly delightful musical.",1055203200,33,2935,4.539622641509434
411665,5,6301978315,"There have been surprisingly few performers in the history of movies who have possessed operatic type voices.  Mario Lanza, Kathryn Grayson, and Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald very nearly completes the list, though a nod should be made to Allan Jones, who, though never a star, managed a few notable appearances in various films, including two Marx Brothers films (A NIGHT AT THE OPERA) and this film, as Romeo to Jeanette MacDonald's Juliet early in the movie, and in TOSCA, near the end.
Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy were, therefore, a unique aberration in the history of cinema history, the only operatic partnership in Hollywood, ever.  They were the operatic equivalent of Astaire and Rogers, and if their films never achieved the polish or brilliance of those two, they nonetheless managed to make some very fine films.  ROSE MARIE is probably their most famous, and perhaps their finest.
The various renderings of ""Indian Love Call"" in the film are what the film is best known for, but upon reviewing the film last night with my daughter (who loved it, although she found many moments so embarrassing that she had to hide her head under a pillow, especially during the movie's closing moments), I was amazed at how enjoyable the movie is as a whole.  The movie is delightful from beginning to end, gorgeous to look at (filmed, unfortunately, at Lake Tahoe, instead of the Canadian Rockies), and infinitely less dated than one might expect from an operatically driven 1936 comedy.  The movie was also enhanced from a barrage of excellent supporting players.  Reginald Owen, David Niven, Alan Mowbray, Una O'Connor, the aforementioned Allan Jones, and Jimmy Conlin (familiar to anyone who has seen many Preston Sturges comedies) provide a deep cast.  Jimmy Stewart has a smallish role in the last film he made before becoming a lead actor.
One of the more intriguing segments was filmed at an actual Indian camp.  Visually, it is a stunning sequence, but unfortunately MGM in the best Hollywood fashion marred the scene with added orchestral music and choreography.  And no, this is not the film that breaks the mould by having an actual Native American play a Native American.  George Regas, who made a career out of playing Indians, was actually born in Greece.",1014422400,68,2278,4.971052631578948
411666,5,6301978315,"Rudoph Friml's ""Rose Marie"", filmed in the 1930s, stands strong, even in 2001. Its stars shine as a memorial to the era.  At her elegant best as an opera singer seeking to save her brother, a young Jimmy Stewart, from a life of crime, Jeanette MacDonald follows his trail to the Canadian Rockies. There, Royal Mounted Police Sgt. Bruce played by Nelson Eddy, committed to his duty as an officer of law, uses MacDonald, (Rose Marie) as a decoy to get his man. Their words of love are painfully sacrificed in the echoing hollows of the magnificent Northwest. The music haunts the story throughout. The pace of the drama is flawlessly done, directed with total honesty to Friml's artistry.  No detail is overlooked in this poignant drama of idealistic love, so masterfully commanded by both MacDonald and Eddy.  It's almost as if they were not acting at all.",1001894400,30,855,4.763513513513513

7819604,5,6301978315,"This film was cute and old fashioned, which I like. Old fashioned is a good word to me. I loved the opera at the beginning very much, but I'm a rare 21st century 40 something year old who loves opera and 1930s, 1940s swing music too and Golden Age films. Allen Jones sang with her in the opera, but he didn't have as significant role as in other films of his such as Judy Garland's ""Everybody sing"" and Marx bros' ""Day at the races"" and ""Night at the opera"", which also had some nice opera in it. Reginald Owen also co starred here, who also co starred with Jones in ""Everybody sing"".
Janette was sort of a spoiled princess type living in Montreal, which was seen after the opera ended and before she left Montreal to go to a small lakeside cabin town in rural Canada to search for her brother.  I liked the scene in the local bar with the rowdy provincial drunks. Janette tried to sing for them, but due to there already being a singer/ dancer Belle and Janette's style opera singing not being to the local's tastes, it was an uneasy experience. Belle was a much more burlesque, Janette was refined. It was kind of sad the way the local's ignored Janette and her opera singing and didn't throw any money to her. Then Belle cut right in interrupting her singing with her burlesque style and right away the local's started cheering and throwing money again.  I guess that whether it's the southern US, the midwest, the west, or Canada, and whether it's the 1930s or the 21st century, those provincial hick heyseeds types will always be the same. Nelson Eddie, who was a Canadian mountie, saw how Janette was getting treated and really felt for her, you could see it. He followed her outside and tried to help her out. It was nighttime, and I do notice how in these old films with outdoor night scenes, you can tell how they're really filming in daylight and they were just dimming the screen. Older film equipment from the 1930s wasn't able to actually film outdoors at night, it would've made it too dark to see anything on the screen.
Nelson takes Janette to an Indian tribe where her brother is. There were some good scenes there. I really liked alot of the music in the film. The opera at the beginning, Nelson singing the mountie song, Nelson singing to Janette on several occasions and her singing too, they made a great opera duet with every song of theirs. I loved ""I belong to you"" especially, and there were great scenes with the two of them hiking through the Alpine Canadian wilderness together.",1513123200,,2506,4.493421052631579
