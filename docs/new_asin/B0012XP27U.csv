It is just the kind of thing that should be passed along to one's children and grandchildren lest they forget their roots if they are Jewish, and to remind those who are not of the cruel and inhuman sides of nationalism and the wars that territorial acquisition promotes in the name of some imagined racial or ethnic superiority.",1265846400,10,528,4.739130434782608

3099499,5,B0012XP27U,"The DVD presents a beautiful yet balanced view of the Eastern European Jewish World before the Holocaust.  This world was imbued with the spiritual and religious treasures of Jewish civilization, and bound together by the polyglot language, Yiddish.  Visual remnants, including 'motion pictures' and interviews with the few remaining survivors from the area and period discussed, are included:  these remove this forgotten world from the realm of rosy-hued myth, yet reveal the real loss our world suffered when this part of it was murdered.",1227916800,52,541,5.416666666666667

3099517,5,B0012XP27U,We will not forget!! And as I was too young to know first hand; I rely on these books and videos of information on how the survivors made it!  And the losses we will always hold as historical facts!  Such barbaric acts could only have been ordered by a sick and evil person; and all who were afraid to face going against him.  Today I treasure the knowledge that my familial roots come from this era and how lucky I am to be here today and free!!

It matters not your religious beliefs or your heritage, the need to know to look back and remember is something we all experience. It is a way to honor all that has gone before.

The other was ""A Yiddish World Remembered"", an amazing production that provides insights into the rich cultural heritage that existed in parts of Eastern Europe, mainly Poland prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, and the Holocaust. A vibrant community of 3.5 million Jews lived in Poland before the horrors of the Holocaust, and there were only about 250,000 left at the end of the war. This documentary examines the primary language of the Jews in Eastern Europe,i.e. Yiddish which bound the people together.
