8632487,2,B00HFNAA0A,Odd collection from MGM. Includes 2 of the worst transfers to bluray of their library...GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD and THE BLACK STALLION. Both look awful as they took little care to restore them. The latter was thankfully properly restored in a beautiful blu ray by the Criterion Collection. GREATEST may never get the proper care it deserves.,1482537600,,342,5.017543859649122

Now let's crunch some numbers. This collection costs $38.99, and contains 9 films. When we divide 38.99 by 9, to find the value of the individual film you're getting, we get a cost of $4.33 per film, a fair deal to own this diverse and fun collection of family films. I hope this information was helpful. Cheers!",1397260800,23,2748,4.682572614107884
8632490,2,B00HFNAA0A,"While this collection undoubtedly represents SOMEone's notion of ""best,"" it certainly does not represent my own. I suspect the packaging of these films together occurred more from a legal perspective than a family-viewing perspective. And the price is not a bargain unless I agree that every one of the included films is worthy of Friday-night family time. With Netflix as an option, we can find a ""best"" list that represents our own sensibilities; and can do so without spending $40+ to include films I don't wish to see.",1392422400,5,522,4.943181818181818
8632491,4,B00HFNAA0A,"While this is a nice set of family films, 4 of them are Don Bluth movies. MGM should have released these as a Bluth collection. They could have also included ""Rock-A-Doodle"", and tried to clear the rights from FOX for ""Thumbelina"" and ""Troll in Central Park"". Somehow FOX released a collection with ""Troll"" and ""Nimh"", so there has to be a way to get a set from one of these two companies with most of his films. Heck, if they could do something with FOX they could also release ""Anastasia"", ""Bartok the Magnificent"" and ""Titan AE"".
I guess what I'm saying is...while this is a nice family set of films, I think people would rather have a set of Bluth films on BluRay for their collection. I know I would.",1392076800,14,705,4.430769230769231
