4533525,5,B0052ZFFT4,"I originally bought ""The Butterfly Circus"" because Eduardo Verastegui was in it.
But as it turned out it was a wonderfully cast film.
The DVD has Special Features- Behind the Scenes and Outtakes.  It tells you about
the other actors in the film who are not as well known as Eduardo.
The movie is very touching, its a short film but well worth the money.",1311379200,2,353,4.430769230769231

4533527,5,B0052ZFFT4,"A few years ago, a teenage girl entered the shop where I was working.  Her father was pushing her in a wheelchair because she had no arms and legs.  I don't know if she had lost them to illness or an accident or was born that way, because I didn't look at where her limbs should be but rather at her face.  Her expression was one of such great despair that it haunts me even now. Whenever I watch The Butterfly Circus, I think of that girl and hope that she is o.k., that she's come to terms with her life.  This film is a little miracle, and Nick Vujicic is an inspiration. The Butterfly Circus is one of the best short films I've ever seen! It shows you that each one of us has the power to do wonderful things.",1309564800,39,713,4.035460992907802

When I watched for the first time, I assumed it was just great videography - I wanted to know more about the lead character. Turns out there is an amazing story within this story and that is the life of Nick Vujicic. I've never met Nick, but I have complete respect and admiration for what he has done with his life given the story of his life.

I was so impressed with The Butterfly Circus that I ordered a copy for every member of my family because no movie has ever been more compelling or meaningful.

All we have to do is have a little of faith in ourselves. My husband and I had a huge fall out with a church we were going to. I won't bore you with all of the details but I was so scarred that it took 7 years before I would even listen to anything that had to do with religion. There was certainly no way I was even going near a church. That all changed when I came across a book by Nick Vujicic. I was reading it and I just couldn't put it down until I read the whole book. Then I decided that I should go on the internet and see if I could find anything else out about this guy named Nick Vujicic My whole world changed! I had never heard of a person like Nick. Everything I knew about religion was PREACH,PREACH,PREACH! But with Nick He made me feel like he was talking to an old friend. I had watched Nick""s music video and upon searching for it one day I came across this absolutely beautiful movie ""The Butterfly Circus"". Of course the majority of the people I tell about this movie their first question is "" He doesn't do a lot of preaching at you does he?"" Nick was exactly what I needed my life at the time. And he still is in my heart to this very day! After watching this movie I had come to realize that I was being way to harsh on myself. I realized that I am not as bad of a person that I thought I was. I realized that I am a person of self worth. I realized that in this great big world I MATTERED! I guarantee that if you watch this movie you too will realize that you too are a person of self worth and that you too matter I am in a much better place in my life right now because of Nick and I don't want that to ever change!",1491350400,,1772,3.8575342465753426

8454889,5,B0052ZFFT4,"""The Butterfly Circus"" is an amazing, inspiring film, but have no fear; it's not ""preachy.""  It's one of the best short films I've ever seen.  Nick Vujicic is magical, and every element of film making from camera work to acting to story line is first rate and always surprising.  Characterization is realistic, yet has a fantasy feel. The film captures the essence of the Great Depression, life in the circus, and and finding one's gift, all in 22 minutes.  It bowls me over that so much can be done with so little film time.  Indeed, though it's so short, ""Butterfly Circus"" feels like a full length feature, yet is never long-winded, nor is a single frame wasted.  These are the kinds of films that we need to have in our lives, and I am so glad I get to share my thoughts, and that it's on DVD.  I'll be purchesing this soon.",1477612800,,828,4.407894736842105

teens to see differently and develop positive attitudes to become more like the circus leader.  I also hope they will see that they can overcome
difficulties in their lives with the help of a caring community(for us our Catholic faith/Church).",1471824000,,521,4.641304347826087
