8084100,3,B000BB1MDW,"I don't pretend to be a connoisseur of dance, though I saw a performance of Merce Cunningham's group some years ago and was mightily impressed. This is the first exposure I've had to Twyla Tharp, though she's been around for decades. So I may be missing something but I didn't find the first part of the Catherine Wheel to be very interesting; much of it seemed like pantomime more than dance, with lots of people knocking into each other, hitting each other, and falling down. It seemed to be trying too hard to make some kind of point so that it was hard to apprciate the dance itself because it all seemed to be a puzzle put on stage for the audience to solve. But the last part, the Golden Section, was great--pure dance, intricate, complex, virtuosic, often frenetic, and a real pleasure to watch, though it took a few minutes of viewing before I realized this was happening in the same piece that had provided so many uninteresting moments earlier. I guess my expectations had dropped pretty low. I don't know that I'd recommend buying this just to skip to the Golden Section part, but after watching the entire thing, I expect I will be watching that part again--but not the rest of the work.",1364688000,,1199,4.555555555555555
8084101,4,B000BB1MDW,"Saw this when PBS first aired way back when, and thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever seen on tv.
I was a bit concerned at the start of the dvd because there are old film flecks and so on, but those disappear after it gets going, thankfully.
What to say? This is a masterful collaboration of two top talents in their prime. Graphics were cutting edge for the time. I understand why some may dislike the editing, close ups, etc, but this (I assume) is how Twyla wanted it. It is not a stage production. It is a dvd/film. Seems that complaint about not being able to see the whole set all the time could be leveled at any play that is translated to film. Of course dvds were years away from being invented, so the idea of multiple camera angle choices for the viewer wasn't considered. Too bad.
The music is outstanding. It is why I got a cassette player. 12"" vinyl only had 40 minutes compared to the full score on cassette. There is an Indonesian gamelan flavor to much of it. Bryne is just so darn inventive with his riffs.
Perhaps it could have been a little bit shorter. That's why I don't give it 5 stars. Picky picky.
All I can say is that if you like seeing intelligent, thoughtful art at the highest level, take a look. I love both Tharp and Bryne and this is a treat. I am so thankful they came out with this. My vhs tape I made just doesn't quite cut it anymore.",1325980800,5,1377,4.2
8084102,1,B000BB1MDW,A total waste of money.  Old dark video with very bad production values.  I saw the Miami Ballet version on PBs.  This wasn't even close.,1323648000,,137,4.4
8084103,5,B000BB1MDW,"The Catherine Wheel is a device used in Medieval torture, hence it's application to late 20th century life. Twyla Tharp's pessimistic assessment of modern family values leads to a wonderful display of modern dancing. Her choreography is a mix of various styles--ballet and modern, danced to a score written by her then-boyfriend David Byrne. The two synthesized an artistic moment so creative that parts are still performed today as ""The Golden Section"". It is a tremendous contribution to modern dance and this DVD captures the video designed version totally.",1256601600,,560,5.303370786516854
8084104,4,B000BB1MDW,"I saw ""The Catherine Wheel"" for the first time back in the 1980s, while still living in Puerto Rico.  I was young, was dancing and was thirsty for new dancing forms.  This show is full of energy and the artistic style of the 80s.  The music by David Byrne is haunting and contagious.

As a product of the 80s, it must be seen from within its context. I was not convince with the spiritual nature of the piece, and its supposed conection with St. Catherine, but my god, there is unbelievable dancing and creativity.  And is fun to watch beyond belief.",1243987200,,550,4.405940594059406
8084105,3,B000BB1MDW,"I originally saw the final movement of The Catherine Wheel, ""The Golden Section,"" performed live by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater (arguably the best modern dance group in the world).  It was completely far and beyond any contemporary performance i had ever seen.  Everyone in the audience was gasping and amazed throughout the piece, and left speechless at the end.  The choreography was so powerful and intricate, i had to see it again.  So i decided to do some research and buy the DVD.

I should have known better than to expect the same experience and amazement from a DVD of 80's dancers compared to a live contemporary Ailey show.  I believe that dance as an art form should be seen live, from the audience, with a view of the entire stage at once.  Choreography--especially choreography as complex and intricate as Tharp's--is intended to be seen from far enough away that one can see all the dancers at once and still be able to read their facial expressions.  Therefore, i understand that attempting to capture something as deep and potent as The Catherine Wheel on video is basically an impossible undertaking, but i was still disappointed with the way it was done for this DVD.

I really don't appreciate the prolonged close-ups of individual dancers, or extended shots of half the stage or of one couple at a time, when there are four couples on the stage all dancing different combinations.  I also don't see the point of filming the dancers from the waist up.  It's like only reading the top halves of the pages in a novel.  It just seems to me that whoever was in charge of the cinematography had never been to a dance performance before.

Perhaps if i hadn't seen the show live, i wouldn't know what i was missing and i would think it was great.  But the camera work on this DVD cuts out a lot of movement, and the technological additions interfere with the overall flow of the work.  The piece is plenty abstract in its original form, so the digital interference and lack of full-stage perspective makes the whole thing nearly impossible to understand.

As a professional dancer and choreographer, i honestly expected more.  I have all respect for Ms. Tharp and her work--seeing ""The Golden Section"" live was life-changing--but i do not think this DVD does her justice.",1171411200,19,2295,4.726130653266332
