8326423,5,B001EW56CU,"I am a certified Kundalini Yoga Teacher and I highly recommend this DVD to anyone, who just started. This one is the must for the beginners as they should experience the real power of Kundalini Yoga as it was taught by Yogi Bhajan. I have lots of DVDs, including Ana Brett's and Maya Fiennes, they are good ones, but this one is PERFECT. Listen carefully to the teacher, follow his instructions, don't skip little rest between exercises and ENJOY new SELF! By the way, I met the guy personally during the Yoga Journal Conference in New York and he is the one who inspired me to become a Kundalini Yoga Teacher. He was teaching the same Kriya (set of exercises) that this DVD has. I was immediately hooked and finally got the ""aha"" moment, though was practicing it for a while. The beauty of Kundalini Yoga is that it has all aspects of a good workout and includes chanting, breathing techniques, and relaxation (sometimes with Gong, which is more powerful than our mind). If you live in NY and can go to the center where he is teaching (and lots of other very experienced teachers!), then don't wait and go. This is the perfect time. Just to make it clear: I saw him once, in New York, he probably wouldn't even recall my name now, so this review is 100% independent and loyal.",1367193600,10,1277,4.484978540772532
