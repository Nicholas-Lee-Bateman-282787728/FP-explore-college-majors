It was nice to see a Filipino take on the now popular (some will say 'over-saturated') vengeful spirit genre, and to my great surprise, except for a few hiccups here & there, it was very well done.

Kris Aquino is featured as a young upwardly-mobile wife and mother of two who begins to experience a rapid succession of ""good luck"" after she retains a ""bagua"" (a Chinese octagonal plaque with a small circular mirror in the center whose use is believed to ward off bad spirits) which had been ""forgotten"" on the bus seat next to hers. But with each fell of ""good luck"" she experiences, someone close to her soon dies afterward, with the ghosts of those who had died occasionally paying her household less-than 'friendly' visits.

Upon realizing that the bagua is the link, she seeks a way to break the curse and bring about an end to all the death. But if she finds a way to break the cycle of 'bad' luck, it will also result in the end of the 'good' luck! -- And the young wife & mother especially needs a really huge infusion of 'good luck' in her marriage, having to deal with a husband who's had a history of philandering and a mother-in-law who's always disapproved of her son's choice of a marriage partner.

As already mentioned, each 'victim' is offed according to some manner that relates to his/her 'birth year' according to ""Eastern astrology"" -- so unless you are somewhat familiar with the Philippines or daily life there, some of the 'death scenes' will make little sense to you.

One of the most beautiful things about this movie (from my own personal perspective) is the fact that the 'leading ladies' are the antithesis of ""rail thin"" stick figures! It was so very refreshing to watch a group of actresses whose physical attraction is not based on their ability to conform to near-skeletal proportions! Kris Aquino, especially with her ""meaty bones,"" is simply gorgeous!

And if the name Kris Aquino sounds at all familiar to you -- yes, she is indeed former Philippine President Corrazon Aquino's 'little girl'.

8066088,3,B0009S8QWM,"This story isn't spectacular. It has a curse, ghosts, and unescapeable death...but it just doesn't done in an original or new way. Joy is also dealing with a cheating husband, an evil mother-in-law, and two young children. The things making everything easier is that everyone believes in spirits,curses,etc. There is an interesting way people are cursed that relates to the year they are born, and under which animal it is - year of the snake,etc. The lucky bagua brings death to all who look into the center mirror, and the people surrounding the owner are in danger when the owner has luck. Joy needs to figure out how to keep people from dying as the luck becomes a curse to her as well.

It's worth a rental.",1126051200,,712,4.606299212598425
