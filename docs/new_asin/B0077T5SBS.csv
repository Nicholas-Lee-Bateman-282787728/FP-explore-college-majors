5063238,4,B0077T5SBS,"So here I am once again singing the praises of Shout Factory--and for good reason. They've managed to do in three months what Sony could not do in nearly six years--release two consecutive seasons of ""Hazel"" on DVD.

Obviously there IS a market for this 50-year-old TV show when Season 3 is announced weeks before Season 2 hits stores.

Here are the 32 episodes included on this set:

Pot Luck A La Mode (9/19/1963)
An Example For Hazel (9/26/1963)
Dorothy Takes A Trip (10/3/1963)
You Ain't Fully Dressed Without A Smile (10/10/1963)
Cheerin' Up Mr. B. (10/17/1963)
Piccolo Mondo (10/24/1963)
Hazel Scores A Touchdown (10/31/1963) Alan Hale guest stars.
George's 32nd Cousin (11/7/1963) Diane Ladd guest stars.
The Baby Came C. O. D. (11/14/1963) James Stacy guest stars.
All Hazel Is Divided Into Three Parts (11/21/1963)
The Vanishing Hero (11/28/1963)
Call Me Harve (12/5/1963) Ann Jillian guest stars.
The Retiring Milkman (12/12/1963) Sterling Holloway guest stars.
Hazel's Nest Egg (12/19/1963)
Hazel And The Halfback (12/26/1963) Frank Gifford guest stars.
Hazel And The Model T (1/2/1964)
Hot Potato A La Hazel (1/9/1964)
Scheherezade And Her Frying Pan - Part 1 (1/16/1964)
Scheherezade And Her Frying Pan - Part 2 (1/23/1964)
The Fashion Show (1/30/1964)
George's Ordeal (2/6/1964)
The Reluctant Witness (2/13/1964) Mabel Albertson guest stars.
Democracy At Work (2/20/1964)
The Countess (2/27/1964)
Hazel's Midas Touch (3/5/1964)
Everybody's A Comediene (3/12/1964)
All Mixed Up (3/19/1964)
Arrivederci, Mr. B. (3/26/1964) Luciana Paluzzi guest stars.
Such A Nice Little Man (4/2/1964)
Campaign Manager (4/9/1964) Harold Gould guest stars.
Let's Get Away From It All (4/16/1964) Jamie Farr guest stars.
Maid For A Day (4/23/1964) Harvey Korman guest stars.

As with Season Two, the print quality varies with less-than-perfect video on some and excellent picture quality on others, but this time Shout gives consumers a heads-up as the back cover states ""Episodes were mastered from the best available video sources"". Also, one episode titled ""The Campaign Manager"" on Disc Four is the syndicated cut version which only runs 22 minutes. These factors are what prevent this from being a Five-Star release IMO.

The Season-premiere features a different opening with the cast preparing for Hazel to take a family portrait; the last episode of the season features yet another alternate opening with Harold pretending to be a toll-booth operator as Hazel is seated in a bright-red Ford convertible. The remainder of the episodes feature the opening with everyone piling into the car with Hazel smiling behind the wheel. Purists will be glad to know the original Screen Gems ""dancing sticks"" logo appears at the end of the closing credits.

At this rate, we may see the remaining two seasons out by the end of 2012 or early 2013. I certainly hope so, while Season 5 wasn't the best, it features a teenage Ann Jillian as a semi-regular and I rarely saw many of those episodes in syndication. Bring on Season Four!",1328918400,38,3017,5.210309278350516

I find that Hazel can get on my nerves with her busy-body interference and her many well-intended gaffs, but I appreciate that the humor of this show is completely clean and emphasizes the importance of family bonds.

5063284,5,B0077T5SBS,Hazel was a person with good morals and ethics.  She represented that an employee who worked for an employer could be part of a family.

5063288,5,B0077T5SBS,"This is on my list of top 10 shows that I love.  Nothing wrong with this show at all.  Can be viewed by any age without worrying about seeing or hearing something inappropriate.  Hazel was made when television was still decent.  After the 1970's TV shows started going down hill.  Hazel has it's moments of comedy and sincerity, highly recommend to everyone.",1393718400,,358,4.709677419354839

5063290,5,B0077T5SBS,"Having enjoyed all four seasons of the orginal cast of Hazel, this third season was one of my favorites. Going back to a more innocent time, where kids were well behaved, people were good to one another...and no shocking language or scenes...Just plain good old fashion fun. I highly reccommend this DVD series.",1390176000,,311,4.886792452830188
5063291,5,B0077T5SBS,Season three is just as funny and good as the other two.  I have watched it at least three times since I got them.  I have only had them for two months.  It well worth it and can't wait for the next one to come out.,1389398400,,215,3.630434782608696

5063294,5,B0077T5SBS,"For years I was searching for the Hazel series, and finally amazon offered one season after another. Now I have them all, and I still watch and enjoy them. What a different time in America when these were filmed. Shirley Booth is fabulous, I watch these over and over. If you like the 50's, this is for you.",1386028800,,307,4.310344827586207
5063295,5,B0077T5SBS,"As a child, I remember loving this show, along with the other classics of the late 1950s and 1960s. Although too young to remember some of them, I was old enough to remember Hazel. The show revolves around the adventures of this extraordinary Housekeeper/Maid and her uncanny ability to always make things turn out right. The family consists of ""Mr. B"" the attorney and head of the family, although if truth be known, I always felt Hazel was the one in charge. Missy, George's wife, has known Hazel since she was a child and is the perfect complement to her husband. An interior decorator with excellent taste, she and Hazel have a very loving relationship and Missy can be counted on to run interference when Hazel and Mr. B butt heads. Then there is the adorable Harold, better known as ""Sport,"" who is such a sweet little boy who worships Hazel and considers her a hero. The acting is superb and the storylines are anything but sappy. This series proves that wholesome programs have a place in society and with it, there is always a valuable lesson to be learned. Kudos to Shirley Booth, Don DeFore, Whitney Blake and Bobby Buntrock for delivering a beautiful and entertaining story to the viewers in every episode. And while all of them are no longer with us, it is comforting that their brilliance is on record and the days when the simple things were the best can truly live on!",1380499200,3,1384,4.607287449392713

5063299,4,B0077T5SBS,"Picture quality and sound okay.  That's why I gave it only 4 instead of five stars.  If you love Shirley Booth, buy it.",1369267200,,119,4.130434782608695
5063300,5,B0077T5SBS,"My 7 year old granddaughter and I have watched 3 seasons of Hazel.  The wholesomeness of this old show allows people to see how respect and laughter and love can come together and create real entertainment not just for an old geezer but for a child of the 2000's.  Every time she comes to visit the first thing she asks is when can we watch Hazel and each time we watch an episode she wants to see another.  Who am I to say no!  Although there are many entertaining shows on today, most are not appropriate for little kids.",1366588800,,523,4.252525252525253

5063307,5,B0077T5SBS,"Hazel is a series which has been neglected in recent years, but it is one of the best of the sixties sitcoms. Shirley Booth was perfect in the title role, and the writing is excellent, especially next to what passes as sitcom writing today.

5063316,3,B0077T5SBS,"""Hazel"" was always a great show, but so far, all I've seen is episodes that look far from the ones I watched on TV. The color, as I clearly remember was the same quality as movie film. These episodes look ""washed"" out; they are too bright and a little distracting. I'm disappointed, because this was a beautiful show, full of excellent clarity and color.

 As far as the show itself: it presented clever story lines that made it a true classic.",1354233600,,444,4.469135802469136

Absolutely agree with all the kudos to Shout! Factory... they have simply been superb in bringing so many releases to DVD, in as fine a quality as is possible.  Shout! Factory seems to set the standard that others hope to follow (my opinion of course, but I'm truly impressed).  It's simply great to be able to re-enjoy Hazel all over again (and so many others that Shout! Factory has released).  I haven't been disappointed by any of their releases.

Shout! Factory endeavors to provide the best quality they can on their releases.. and it shows..  And that's something we just don't see enough of these days..  A hearty thank you to Shout! for responding to us tv fanatics as often as they have...  Hopefully, viewers will show their support and respond by purchasing (and truly enjoying) these shows, which can only benefit us all !!",1348099200,,1060,4.686486486486486

I truly thought Season 1 was all we were going to get...what was it, 7 years or so between the release of season 1 & season 2? It seemed like forever, anyway. I have a question, has anyone heard anything about when the subsequent seasons may be released? I'm holding back from watching the last disc of Season 3, because I don't want it to end. =) I've checked the Shout Factory Site and do not see any mention of it.

5063333,4,B0077T5SBS,"It's great to finally see Shirley Booth at her finest on TV with the ""Hazel"" DVD sets.  The surviving quality of the early Pathe color film (Hazel was the first color sitcom) has been questionable over the years, but Shout Factory has done a pretty good job with the material that they were given for this Season 3 set.  Not only have they restored the original ""dancing sticks"" Screen Gems logo at the end of each episode (which was deleted long ago), but they have inserted two more of the original Ford-sponsored closing credits sequences (a previous one on ""Hazel's Nest Egg"" was restored in the '80s).  Someone at Shout Factory is definitely a Hazel fan.  Even though one episode is the 22-minute syndicated version (""Campaign Manager""), the rest are all the uncut 25.5 minute versions, and it's a pleasure seeing them that way after several decades.  The laugh tracks are missing for the most part, but this is a minor point.  Hopefully we'll see Seasons 4 and 5 soon.",1339718400,7,974,4.7

There may have been a tad of a color saturation problem on the Season Two dvd release but it has been much improved for the Hazel Third Season dvd. And there are some very nice extras for Hazel's most loyal fans (like me) in the closing credits with a close up, front end shot of a 1964 Ford Fairlane used in the background and on one of the episodes we get a 1964 Ford Galaxie 500 rolling down the highway while the Hazel credits roll. It is really wonderful to see the closings as they were first broadcast in 1963-64. Thank you so much Shout for taking the time and care to add these special and meaningful touches. I am looking forward to the Hazel Fourth Season dvd. Does anyone know when Shout will release it?",1338854400,6,851,4.2592592592592595

5063337,5,B0077T5SBS,"I just got my third season set of the beloved 1960's sitcom Hazel starring Shirley Booth.  It's a shame that they don't make them like this anymore.  I can't wait for Shout Factory to release the remaining seasons.  Such a great way to spend a few hours, with Shirley Booth as Hazel.  I highly recommend this DVD set to anyone! You will love it!",1337817600,4,345,4.34375
5063338,5,B0077T5SBS,"""Hazel"" looks outstanding in Season Three...so another big thanks to Shout Factory! for releasing another season of this much-beloved sitcom. For such an old series, the episodes look fantastic. A few of them have some dirt and grime but for a 50-year old show, ""Hazel"" has probably never looked better.

As sitcoms age, it is common to notice weaknesses in the writing but that isn't the story with Season Three of ""Hazel."" There are a few clunkers here, but most of the stories are creative and we see more and more of Hazel Burke interacting with neighbors and the community at large. Shirley Booth continues to be amazing, and it really seems the award-winning actress was just hitting her stride. Seldom can an actress bring such a wide range of emotions to a viewer, but when her lips tremble and she breaks into tears, I found myself also feeling sad for her. But there are way more laughs here than tears; her relationship with Mr. B. is explored more, especially on the first disk, in a three-episode arc when Whitney Blake was noticeably absent. If anyone knows the background story behind her absence during those first few episodes of this third season, I'd be curious to know the details.

There are also a few guest-starring roles of note, most notcieably a very, very young Diane Ladd as an annoying family cousin that will have viewers saying to themselves that she looks just like her daughter, Laura Dern.

I can't laud Shout Factory! enough for releasing the second and third seasons of this sitcom...and hope they will release the remaining two seasons. Those of us that are fans of classic television will be forever grateful. If you enjoyed the first two seasons of ""Hazel"", you won't be disappointed with Season Three.",1337472000,13,1741,4.796666666666667

I don't know what season three will look like, will they be remastered or what, but I don't care,all I know is that Hazel is back on DVD for season three and that makes me happy.",1336780800,3,399,4.25
5063342,4,B0077T5SBS,"My only gripe is the variable video and audio quality. Some episodes look great from beg. to end. Others are composites of more than one print and of variable image quality. The audio quality varies as well and can be muffled on some episodes. At least one episode was from a pretty poor/ fuzzy video copy so I guess all the films weren't available to SF. Maybe this is why Sony quit after Season One?

Hopefully the remaining seasons will not be any worse and maybe somewhat better. I know you cant expect miracles from old films. Bottom Line: if you have been wanting to see this program don't hesitate to purchase it, the price is right and it still looks amazing, especially compared to a 1960's era TV set!!

If SF releases the first 4 seasons I will purchase them - as for Hazel without Don Defore, I am not so sure I would buy that.",1335484800,2,839,4.337579617834395

They do a good job and I appreciate that they take on releases that other companys don't consider worthwhile.

5063346,5,B0077T5SBS,"Season two has come out but the digital transfer is not so hot. Washed out prints but they seem intact. Funny the first season had one color episode that was exceptional about Hazel buying a color tv set. I just don't understand why any after that would look worse. Shirley Booth plays that character so well sometimes I can't stand her. I want to strangler her and fire her,dang Mr. B takes alot crap from Hazel. This is a comedy cause in real life I can't see a maid taking over and ordering a family like she does. sheesh! But its that premise that makes the show work. She has the perfect big mouth and annoying voice Hazel should have. But at the end of every episode the main moral is be who you are and be proud of it. Sometimes Hazel bums out just being a maid but helps people with their everyday lives by being a nosy and caring person about humanity. A variety of episodes deal with Hazel putting snobs in their place. Glad to see season three so soon after two came out. I like season five cause when they switched networks Hazel got a new Baxter family to take care along with Harold (Bobby Buntrock)the only original cast member to stay with the shows new format.",1330560000,5,1177,4.330316742081448
