I can well imagine the hurried, and necessarily truncated story of this great Russian writer; even as the oeuvre of the great FYODOR ""come[s] alive;"" and even as one cannot help but wish for an innocence of the time, this program punishingly runs down to the very last second, and there, one is left ""yearning for more.""

I find, in fact, I am ""declined to agree,"" relenting now to the fact that this great author's life and life's works are squeezed into a most insufficient 30 little minutes, shaking me from my initial effusive joy, and effectively nudging me to my ultimate resolve: this is a purchase I must decline.

One clever film maker might take an ambitious queue from Michael Tilson Thomas, director of the San Francisco Symphony, and do just as he does when honouring artists such as Gustav Mahler. There is first a 2-hour long documentary detailing the life of the artist, and featuring significant works often played in full. Then, there is a full presentation of one (or more) of the works discussed in the film, where he, the director, and the symphony, and the audience, all tuck in for the 55 minute Maher masterwork, Symphony No. 1 - - the ""Titan"" symphony. This could work when discussing authors: first, a documentary of proper length and substance; and then an interpretation of one, or more, of those great works discussed therein.",1441584000,,1436,4.74

8182508,5,B000O1710C,"Originally produced in Russia, this compact video offers a well-researched, study of the author's life that will be of interest to even the most knowledgeable Dostoevski enthusiast. Using a collage of both black-and-white historical photographs and modern color video images, it  shows the places where the author lived and worked, and the people with  whom he associated.

Dostoevsky is famous for having situated the action  of his novels in actual locations; even today one sees tourists retracing  the steps of Raskolnikov through the back streets and alleys of St.  Petersburg. To a limited extent, this video also does the same, providing  the viewer with a sense of the brooding beauty of the poorer sections of  that wonderful city.

An illuminating biography filmed  where the author lived and worked.

Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821-1881), one of  the greatest novelists of all time, penetrated the human mind and heart  with exceptional insight. His fiction has had a profound and enduring  influence on the modern intellectual climate.

Dostoevsky was born in  Moscow on Nov. 11, 1821. He had a gloomy childhood and at the age of 17 was  sent to the military academy in St. Petersburg. Technical studies were of  little interest to him, so upon graduation he decided to become a writer.  His first novel, ""Poor Folk"" (1849) was highly praised for its sympathetic  treatment of the downtrodden.

In 1849 he joined a group of intellectuals  who read and debated French socialist theories forbidden to be openly  discussed in czarist Russia. The entire group was imprisoned and taken to a  place of execution; but at the last moment they were reprieved and the  punishment was changed to penal exile. Nine years later he received  permission to return to St. Petersburg where he resumed his literary career  and wrote ""The Insulted and Injured"" (1861) and ""Notes from the  Underground"" (1864).

The following years, spent abroad to escape  creditors, were marked with great productivity: the completion of the  novels ""Crime and Punishment"" (1866), ""The Idiot"" (1869), and ""The  Possessed"" (1872). When Dostoevsky returned to Russia in 1873 he was  world-renowned.. His last novel, ""The Brothers Karamazov"" (1880), was  completed not long before his death in St. Petersburg on Feb. 9,  1881.",948067200,4,2310,5.182065217391305

""Filmed where the author lived and worked,"" it effectively uses scenes of those places, rather than costumed actors, to tell its story. Many of those scenes, filmed in St. Petersburg, capture the beauty and mood of that unique city, which played such an important role in Dostoevsky's major works.
