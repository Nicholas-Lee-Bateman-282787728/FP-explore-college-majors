4285334,5,B0047HWGTK,I gave this as an anniversary gift to my sister and her husband. They are very happy with it. Very pricey though.,1410912000,2,113,4.181818181818182
4285335,5,B0047HWGTK,Very happy with the purchase. Arrived on time and was an excellent value for the price. It was a present for my wife and she was very happy to get them.,1396051200,2,152,3.935483870967742
4285336,5,B0047HWGTK,Monk is great.  Our entire family has watched every season.  We actually bought this for our 10-year-old for Christmas.  He was so happy as it is no longer available to stream on Netflix or Hulu.  Thank goodness we could get it on DVD.  We couldn't live without our Monk!,1389571200,4,271,4.448979591836735
4285337,5,B0047HWGTK,The episodes of Monk are as the weekly tv series without the blasted commercials.  Before I had to be there to watch or set recorder and sometimes there were complications.  This way I can watch Monk whenever I want.  What is not to like.,1386806400,3,238,4.363636363636363
4285338,5,B0047HWGTK,"Have been enjoying seeing the 8 season CD collection of the Monk TV show.  As I watch it some family and friends join me and they also get ""hooked"" to watching it.  Lots of good stories and entertaining acting.  I love it.",1293235200,7,222,4.238095238095238
4285339,3,B0047HWGTK,The only issue i have had is scratches on a few of the dvd's.  It skips through an entire episode sometimes. I've only found a couple so far and thought about trying to talk with someone but changed my mind.,1455148800,3,207,4.175

4285342,5,B0047HWGTK,"Had seen each episode except two of them more than twice.  Now I have gone through the entire eight seasons so put them away for awhile.  About a year from now, I will treat myself to all these great, well written, and entertaining programs yet once again.  You can always depend on the characters to stay true to their character and that makes it all more enjoyable than the stories which change or develop the  characters as they go along.",1442188800,,441,4.475
4285343,5,B0047HWGTK,"This is my mother's all-time favorite show.  She's now in the middle stages of dementia and not much holds her attention, but when she watches these DVDs- she's in heaven, her mind is stimulated and she's so happy.  Purchasing this set was the best thing we could do.  Great value.",1441065600,11,281,4.58

8418219,4,B0047HWGTK,"In a language only Monk devotees understand: Only a perfect 100 stars review is justly so in Monk land. Yet, I digress. ""No one granted a four star rating until today."" That is less than perfect. Less than covering all grounds. Just speaking for myself, I would like to cover all bases. Here is to you, Mr. Adrian Monk. I love your command performances over those short 100 (more or less) episodes. Thank you, thank you.",1490227200,,420,4.5394736842105265
8418220,5,B0047HWGTK,"I purchased this product and with one hiccup, it had 2 season # 3.  We just decided to purchase the season # 4 at a very fair price.  I don't regret it a bit. I love Monk!  Not another show ever came close to type of intertainment.  I'm on season 6 now and watch a little bit every night before going to bed. It relaxes me, makes me laugh and I'm ready for a non stressful nights sleep.  I highly  recommend this purchase.",1485820800,,422,4.024096385542169
8418221,5,B0047HWGTK,Just finished the series and it was great. All the episodes plus interviews and other bonuses were great quality and fun facts. Well worth the money.,1475020800,4,149,4.769230769230769
