She loved the other movies and loves this one as well.  This movie was worth it.  I think I might have to share the cost of the movie.  :)",1233792000,3,266,4.038461538461538
3622150,5,B001GZM46G,"Have you seen the Beethoven movies out prior to this one, they were all excellent. Dogs and puppies do get into lots of mischief as you know if you have ever had a dog. This movie is no exception, these cute little puppies are just as mischievious as the puppies in the earlier movies, perhaps more.  It is an excellent family movie and I would recommend it for a nice family movie night full of laughter and fun loving puppies.",1233532800,4,428,4.35
3622151,5,B001GZM46G,I think that this is a great movie for the family.  We watched it on New Year's Eve.,1233014400,2,84,3.6666666666666665
3622152,3,B001GZM46G,"As a kid, I grew up with the first two Beethoven movies! In my opinion, they are the only worthwhile films in the 'series' I was confused as to what this is supposed to be. Is is the 6th film and a writer happens to guess everything that happened in the original classic, or is it a prequel that shows how the first was made. It does have some cute and funny moments, and I liked Cesar Millan's cameo. Eddie is an animal trainer, but he doesn't want anything to do with dogs. His son, Billy runs into Beethoven and he wants to keep him. Soon, Beethoven gets a part in a movie based on his life from the original. I'd probably recommend BEETHOVEN'S BIG BREAK!!!",1230681600,4,660,4.246031746031746

3622161,2,B001GZM46G,"We love the Beethoven series but this one is pretty slow, quiet, and boring for children. Very disappointed. No one does it as well as the actors in the first two movies of the Beethoven movies.",1451260800,,194,4.416666666666667
3622162,5,B001GZM46G,"This movie is such a delight! One of the most enjoyable family films I've seen in a long time. I'm familiar with the Beethoven franchise but hadn't heard of this installment until yesterday when I caught the film on On Demand. Hands down this is the best Beethoven installment ever! It's funny, touching and there's even a little romance mixed in.

The premise is that greedy and bitter Hollywood animal trader Stan, concocts a devious plan to kidnap Beethoven for money and revenge once he is kicked off a film and replaced by Eddie (Jonathan Silverman) who's new dog Beethoven becomes the movie's new star. From the first scene this film is a continuous laugh fest with twists and turns and cameos galore!

What's great about this one is the cast with some well-known faces mixed in! All of the characters are wonderful. Jonathan Silverman plays Eddie with the right balance of charm and goofiness. Even when he rants about Beethoven we can tell he really cares about the pooch. The actor who played Eddie's son was very impressive as well. The actress who plays Silverman's offbeat love interest was the perfect match to Silverman's Eddie with her cookiness and crazy outburts. The man who played Stan had me in stitches and comedy legends Rhea Pearlman and Eddie Griffin are superb. Even Joey Fatone has a small role as one of the bumbling dognappers who try to steal Beethoven. But the winner of them all was the dog himself. Beethoven steals the show once again!

Great cast! Great writing! Tons of laughs and enjoyable for the whole family!",1451174400,,1547,4.764925373134329
