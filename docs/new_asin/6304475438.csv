7872330,5,6304475438,"Q-  When is a video on ocean drifters not a video on ocean drifters?

A-  When it is a video on loggerhead sea turtles.

This is not entirely correct, but close.  Ocean Drifters is about organisms... large and small, shallow and deep, that live in our oceans as opposed to the nearshore environments.  You follow a newly hatched loggerhead as she emerges from the sand, races for the ocean, goes through a day of frenzied swimming, and settles back for a year of drifting in the ocean gyres.

The story switches back and forth between the loggerhead and jellyfish, snails, fish, and the strange organisms that live in the deep oceans.  It discusses ocean management challenges:  trash, chemical spills, and discarded fishing nets.

As we look for life on distance worlds, we shouldn't forget the mystery and diversity of life that exists in our oceans... the ocean drifters.",1138924800,3,874,4.844594594594595
7872331,5,6304475438,"I've seen many National Geographic documentaries, but for me, this one ranks as my favorite. I hope someday it will be available on DVD. ""Ocean Drifters"" presents the most amazingly beautiful photography of marine life. You will be amazed and touched by the beauty and elegance of the life which exists in our world deep in the depths of the sea. After watching it, I almost felt like dropping all my career choices and becoming an Oceanographer so that I may experience such worlds for myself (to me, it was that moving). Add the perfection that is Keith David's voice as the narrator, and a very beautiful and haunting musical score, and you have a documentary which accurately presents the beauty of nature.",1093132800,2,710,4.780487804878049
7872332,5,6304475438,"Ocean Drifters deserves to be ranked with the top biological documentaries of all times.  The crew of National Geographic deserve to be congratulated.  I show it to each of my marine science classes in order to give them an appreciation of the diversity of planktonic life.  The almost one hour video traces the path of a loggerhead turtle as she hatches and takes trip around the North Atlantic Gyre.  The video explores critical fact concerning ocean circulation, biodiversity and discusses a variety of planktonic lifestyles.  People of all ages will appreciate the plight of the sea turtle and I am always amused by the gasps of the first time viewers.",1003968000,4,656,4.927272727272728
