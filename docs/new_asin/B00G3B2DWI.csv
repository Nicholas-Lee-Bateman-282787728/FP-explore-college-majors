6050319,5,B00G3B2DWI,the game was great on the ps3 i never thoug they will make a movie out of this one:) that wat sup,1408838400,2,97,3.4545454545454546
6050320,5,B00G3B2DWI,"First off i have to say I when I first heard the announcement of this movie, I didn't believe it was real. If you love Bayonetta as much as I do then i was jumping for joy when I found out it had been released on DVD/BLU-RAY! This Deluxe version is actually a BLU-RAY disk, and is only compatible on a system or DVD player that is BLU-RAY compatible! I wasn't sure if the movie & CD were going to be Region locked or not, so i purchased the Deluxe edition anyways! Happily find out that my PS3 could play the movie and CD! :D

The movie i cant even describe how great it is! Its the Bayonetta we all came to love and want more of! This animated movie does an incredible job of keeping to the Xbox 360/PS3 game's story line, But with a few twists that are new to this movie! (that i won't reveal, but any fan will notice and hopefully like me appreciate!) The whole animation's run time is about 91 mins long, and is in Japanese! (English subtitles can be added!) The Voice actors did an amazing job of keeping to their character's actual character based on what we saw from the clips from the video game. The CD is simply amazing as well, featuring new songs from the movie and some from the actual game you'll be able to recognize! It also comes with an Art book that is filled with concepts and sketches of characters, weapons, environments, summons and much more (also all of which is in Japanese)! Also the Red booklet it comes with I haven't actually been able to find out what it is, as unfortunately I don't read Japanese very well, so that one is still a mystery to me.

I definitely would recommend this Bloody Fate Deluxe Edition box set to any Bayonetta Fan, as it is so fun to look at, so many goodies, and is such an addition to anyone with their own Bayonetta collection!",1398211200,3,1785,4.262536873156342
6050321,5,B00G3B2DWI,"The style, angles and perspectives to draw a 2D version of Bayonetta are all very impressive and slick.

Film is basically compressed scenes taken-off from the CGI original game adapted to screen. So it does stay true to the game. Just one very very minor thing I did not like about the film ( aesthetically ) is Bayonetta's motorcycle(!) They got her a policeman's motorbike and it's even in white!!.. at least pick something that racy or glamorous that suits her character.

Am a fan of the game and anime in general so I recommend this highly who loves the genre. Not so sure about the steep price, most likely it's just stock availability issues for international release that's keeping it high.. for now.

Just wish they could have at least included a free *figurine of Bayonetta with the booklet and audio CD, at least that would make the price much more acceptable.",1393113600,4,872,4.686274509803922

6050323,5,B00G3B2DWI,"Video games have had a reputation for not doing well in regards to movie adaptations. This anime movie, however, is a video game's movie adaptation that won't disappoint. It's visually impressive, action-packed, and sexy too. I've never played the Bayonetta video game myself, but I think I know enough from watching and reading about it online. I truly think that this is a must-have for anyone who wants to see a good movie adaptation of a popular video game. I think this movie is fantastic in every sense of the word.",1485820800,,521,4.736263736263736

6050328,5,B00G3B2DWI,"First off i got to say that i love how they gave the yellow strings of Bayonetta's outfit and her earrings an extra gloss to make them stand out more on the shell that covers this Blu-ray DVD combo. The full piece of art that covers the inside of the DVD is pretty nice too. The film itself is also very good and is filled to the brim with action and fanservice moments. The only thing that i didn't really like about this movie was the fact that the angels all of a sudden speak English instead of their usual Angelic language. No idea why they choose that but at least the voices that they used for the Angels aint that bad so i'll overlook it. This movie also has a total of 24 minutes of extra footage being actor commentary, storyboards, and the 2 trailers of this movie that were uploaded to Youtube by Funimation. All in all a great movie for any Bayonetta fan out there looking to see the story of the first Bayonetta game in a nutshell and in anime form.",1476230400,2,963,4.210810810810811

This is why the price is so high.  The movie ost does borrow heavily from the video game OST, but throws its' own unique flair to the songs (think of them as minor remixes) and several exclusive songs.  Such as ""Night, I Stand"" by Mai, both ENG and JPN versions.

For one thing, the graphics in the game were so much better I thought.  And I know they had A LOT to cut down on for the storyline what with going from, what...8-10 hours of game play? to and hour and a half movie, but I didn't much care for how they mashed it together.

6050361,4,B00G3B2DWI,"The animation was good, and the voice acting was above average.  I watched the dubbed version.

I was not familiar with the backstory to the popular console game of the same name.

Apparently there was a war between angels/wizards and demons/witches.

Bayonetta was the result of the union between a wizard and a witch.

As with many of the Japanese tales, the angels are actually the bad guys.

I enjoyed the film, but would have probably got even more out of it if I had known a little more about the mythos going into the movie.",1419984000,2,531,4.479166666666667
6050362,5,B00G3B2DWI,"Based on the video game of the same name, Bayonetta: Bloody Fate stay true to its roots. An action fast paced anime with tons shooting, and fights as the video game was. The voice cast from the game are back to reprise their roles, the story is almost identical, some parts are changed due to time, at 90 minutes I consider it short. But it is condensed enough to make it enjoyable. Video and audio are top notch. Leaves the door open for a sequel, which is out now, but only on Wii U. Hopefully it will be released on the major consoles soon. I had fun with it, so should you. If action, adventure is your coup of tea, give Bayonetta: Bloody Fate a try...",1419984000,,656,4.214285714285714
6050363,3,B00G3B2DWI,"This is a film based on a video game. Seldom are the any good. This one takes two and half minutes of narration to explain the plot. The film combines various religious beliefs and portrays the power of light or goodness as being evil because they want to create a new world..at the expense of the old one. This is done by bringing together two eyes. Bayonetta has one of the eyes as well as a healthy case of amnesia after a 500 year sleep in a chained coffin at the bottom of a lake. She is our protagonist who kills angels in a film that blurs good and evil as a yin/yang.

Based on a video game, there is little to no plot as Bayonetta fights just about everyone and at time sacrifices her clothes to do so. She wears her hair in strategic places to prevent technical nudity of a cartoon, although the characters do drop the F-bomb.

If watching stacked cartoon characters fighting, this one has it.",1419638400,,903,4.305882352941176

6050379,3,B00G3B2DWI,"I've been a huge fan of Bayonetta since the original came out in 2009. I had been waiting for an English release of this movie - I bought this to hold me over until the release of Bayonetta 2, as the hype machine was working its magic in overdrive! My experience with this movie was just acceptable overall, and throughout the film I found myself wishing I were playing the game instead. There's a lot this movie got right, and a lot that seemed to be missing from this movie.

Pros:
+Most of the original voice cast is back, so only Balder and little Cereza sound a bit off.
+Some of the original music was used in the movie. This includes great tracks such as One of a Kind and Mysterious Destiny (yay!).
+Cool animation style and beautiful backgrounds. Decent animation quality.
+Helped to clarify a little of the original storyline, for those who missed the major plot points in the game.
+Didn't follow the game by the book, which made the plot a little bit easier for newcomers to understand, and mixed things up for those already familiar with the game.
+Cereza is still super adorable

Cons:
-Not nearly as over-the-top as the game. The game was full of amazing, epic scenarios, and most of the encounters in the movie were relatively muted and anticlimactic.
-The voice acting sounds worse than in the game. It just feels more mechanical and forced overall. In addition not everyone from the game was brought back for the movie (Enzo, Cereza), and although Balder is played by the original voice actor, he sounds like a very different person to me.
-On the topic of voice acting, why do the angels speak English? It sounds so very weird for Beloved, Fortitudo, etc to all be speaking English. It makes them infinitely less intimidating to me.
-Strange audio quirks. A lot of scenes that should be climactic have boring, calm music in the background. The music in the film is worse than in the game; I was super excited when I heard music in it from the game, but the new original pieces just don't come close to having the same amount of energy.
-It's missing a lot of the ridiculous humor from the game, including the silly reactions from the angels when they're getting wrecked. Bayonetta barely even teases them at all in this game. I guess you could say that while the game basks in its own ridiculousness, this movie takes itself a little too seriously.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Bayonetta and I liked the movie. I just want to make sure everyone gets both sides of the story!
If you're a big fan of Bayonetta, you'll probably still enjoy this movie. If you didn't play the game and want a summary of what happened, this film covers the major plot points, with a few differences. There are many areas that could use some improvement, but if you love Bayonetta as much as I do, this is still a pretty fun movie to keep you occupied!",1413936000,29,2858,4.513513513513513

8620310,3,B00G3B2DWI,"I've been gaming a lot lately but I have finally sat down to watch this damn movie, so on to my review. As a huge fan of the Bayonetta games I was excited to see Bayo, back again in this movie. The movie is suppose to be a adaptation of the first Bayonetta game. But there are many problems that I had with it. Fans of the series see as problematic and some of my reasons to disliking this movie as understandable. The story in Bloody Fate is not being story accurate. Which is not hard to believe, adaptations often mix things up because of the lack of originality or trying to be new and not the same as the source material. Which can be for better or worse, in some cases. Other issues includes: the characters not being as fun, entertaining or as interesting for me to watch when compared to their video game counterparts. The action is lacking and isn't as bat shit, crazy compared to the video games. Despite the many lacking and disappointing things about this movie that makes it flawed up the ass. There are things I appreciated from it. Like the songs from the game's soundtrack, along with the original voice actors from the game in the movie. And I do like the flashy animation, some of the fanservice along with some the references that are in the movie. People might still watch this movie because of Bayonetta, heck I did. But I honestly wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless you are a huge Bayonetta fan who desperately needs more Bayo. I'd recommend the games instead, the games are pretty good, definitely better and more enjoyable to experience. I was going to give the rating a 2/5 star rating but since my love for Bayo is so strong, i'll be merciful by giving it a 3/5. It's watchable for people new to the series and for a first time but you wouldn't see this over and over again. Probably not more than twice, especially if you have the games thay does everything much better. Chances are you might enjoy and like this movie more than I did though. So go watch it to form your own opinion, if need be. I still don't recommend though.",1490140800,,2067,4.4136125654450264
