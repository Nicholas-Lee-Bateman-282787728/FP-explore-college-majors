This is, by far, the best I have taken.  Gives you exactly what you need and trims the fat.  I would recommend this to anyone from the experienced IT professional to the beginner that is looking to enter the field of virtualization.",1247529600,,388,4.133333333333334
8481560,5,B00280LRP2,"I have been in IT for over 20 years and dealt with many training solutions: classroom, DVD, books, etc.

Rarely is a package so well organized and presented with just the right amount of explanation, not too techy, not overly simplified, that it can be used in so many ways by the IT department: from proof of concept and development of corporate buy-in to training, implementation and troubleshooting.  The author has a great deal of experience with VMWare and answers many questions before they get asked.

I used many of the author's examples to sell the concepts and principles of virtualization to our executive team.  They were glad to spend the money after fully understanding the benefits and the ROI that comes from virtualization.

With the live installation and configuration screens, you get to see what you will experience before touching VMWare.  I found this an excellent reference before, during and after our company's VMWare migration.

These DVD's were one of my installation resources and were never far from my laptop.  The modular training made it easy to review exactly what I was dealing with during the migration.  Of course, it was required viewing for our engineers and they were very pleased with the material.

I would recommend this product as a resource for those looking to implement VMWare as well as anyone that already has a VMWare shop and wishes their engineers to become more aware of the features and functionality VMWare has to offer.",1243468800,2,1474,4.955284552845528
8481561,5,B00280LRP2,"I have looked at this training and find it to be professional and pratical.
What I liked about this traing is that it does not contain any unecessary fluff but presents straigtforward training through presentation, lectures and product demos that is highly useful for day to day administration and management of a VMWare virtual environment. There is a whole section on best practices and what is also impressive are the useful tips that can only come from real world experience. I would recommend to anyone.
Very well developed and presented!!!",1242000000,,545,5.066666666666666
8481562,5,B00280LRP2,"What a find!
Well paced - easily understood - great technical depth!  This covered everything I needed to plan, install, configure, and maintain an enterprise-class deployment of VMWare.

It is so refreshing to find a professionally produced series with a well-spoken, experienced instructor at such great value!

Highly recommended.",1241740800,,333,5.755102040816326
