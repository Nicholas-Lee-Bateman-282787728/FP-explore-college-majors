8407425,5,B003WM325I,"I didn't know much about Bill Tapia and this documentary helped me learn more about him. This film was concentrated in Bill's later life - after his wife passed away. Although this film did have some information on earlier history, I would have liked to learn about and see more from his younger days. I would recommend this film to those wanting to know more about Bill Tapia or those learning about the legendary ukulele players.",1365206400,,431,4.684210526315789
