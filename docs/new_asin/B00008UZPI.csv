7987010,5,B00008UZPI,"If you like psychological movies, you will really like this movie.  It's about two girls: one, Patsy, from a regular middle class family; one, Marie, whose single mother is a drunk.  The small town kids are so mean to Marie you can't help but feel for her.  In one scene where Marie is depressed about how the kids treat her, Patsy asks Marie how often she bathes.  Patsy does every Saturday; Marie is astounded because they don't have enough water in their well to do dishes, much less take a bath, that often.

But, Marie has a beautiful singing voice that would give Charlotte Church a run for her talent.  (The movie is worth buying just for the beautiful music!)  Unfortunately, even that doesn't raise her social or 'acceptability' standing in the community.  One boy, who plays the piano, does like her, so she asks him to a dance.  When the boy takes leave from dancing for a short while, leaving Marie alone, she feels like everyone is staring at her . . . like she is usually treated.  Suddenly, the excitement of her first date and beautiful dress leave her with only her inner insecurity, so she leaves the dance and walks the five miles back to Patsy's house.  What happened on the way, and in the time after she arrive at her friend's home is the focus, thirty years later as the two friends reunite.

This movie is a wonderful lesson in teen friendship, that can last a lifetime.  I don't think it would be going too far to say that every teen girl's parents should show her this movie and discuss how they would want their daughter to treat girls who are 'outcast' through no fault of their own.  It would also help boys to better understand disadvantaged kids.  They have feelings too . . . wouldn't it be wonderful if something your son or daughter said or did to a disadvantaged friend gave them the courage and strength to excell at something productive?

It was probably a combination of the emotional battering by the the local kids combined with Patsy's faithful friendship and love that gave Marie the courage and strength to become a nationally recognized opera singer.  Still, there were many child wounds that needed to be healed.  This is a wonderful story of that process.

This Candian movie is hard to find.  One of the child actresses won the 'Best Actress - Youth Award' at the 10th International Women Film Festival in Tunin, Italy.  (It may be Alison Pill, but I'm still trying to confirm that.) Again I say, if you like emotional, psychological films, this one is worth looking for.",1149465600,14,2518,4.588366890380313
