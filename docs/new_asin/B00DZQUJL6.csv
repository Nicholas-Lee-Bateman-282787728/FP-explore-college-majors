8599520,2,B00DZQUJL6,"Im going to try to keep this review short. Im giving it two-stars because the film fell short in covering Debussys late period. Masterpieces like Jeux, tudes, and the late sonatas received no mention whatsoever. In fact, the film just passed over Debussys death like it was nothing of importance. What I also found disappointing about this film was there was hardly any talk on Debussys piano music with the exception of Childrens Corner and a mention of Pagodes (the first movement from Estampes). But what about the Prludes or Images or the tudes""? The piano was an important part of Debussys oeuvre (just look, for example, at how many works he composed for solo piano and not to mention the mlodies with piano), but, apparently, to this director, it was of no importance whatsoever like his late period works weren't worth talking about. I understand that there are time constraints, but I think a more thorough job could have been done. Theres just too much time spent on ""Prlude  l'aprs-midi d'un faune, Pellas et Mlisande, and La Mer. These are very important works, but they aren't the only works of Debussys oeuvre worth discussing. So Im giving this a 2-star rating as I thought it could have been more informative. I do hope, however, that a documentary comes out that is in several parts covering Debussys entire compositional and personal history. Until then, this appears to be all we have on this composer.",1522886400,,1421,4.823770491803279
8599521,5,B00DZQUJL6,"This disc was originally produced by Metropolitan Munich and has now been issued by Euroarts as part of their extensive series of musical documentaries. The musical examples are largely extracts from performances made by Metropolitan Munich but there are copious another examples of imagery and recollections taken from the period of Debussy's lifespan.

What emerges from this thorough but engrossing film is an absorbing portrait of the man both as a person and musician. He comes over as an intensely private personality intent on pursuing his own ideas to the point of obsession without much, or any, regard to outside opinion. Consequently he was free to follow his own unique paths of thought and of musical expression.

The quality of the film technically is good, especially bearing in mind the use of so much archive material. There is an attractive bonus with Zoltan Kocsis playing the whole of the Children's Corner Suite. (That same performance is also strangely included in a disc of Schumann's work where the pianist also plays some Bartok as well as Schumann's Kinderszenen). His Debussy playing has been much praised and there are two excellent CDs of him playing a good range of Debussy's piano works.

It would be hard to imagine a more involving or sensitive investigation into what went into making Debussy become Debussy and I would suggest that this documentary would be well worth investing in for anyone even remotely interested in such inside information.",1392163200,7,1480,5.107438016528926
