5673303,5,B00BTYNXHS,"A good suspense movie. No blood and guts just pure intense suspense taking place on a plane.
No monsters either - just an intense movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
If you like all the blood and gore they show today then this will be to mild for you.",1437091200,,266,3.9444444444444446
5673304,5,B00BTYNXHS,"Forget I Know What You Did Last Summer, this is the one thriller to see. Ciccillian Murphy is an awesome bad guy. He reminded me a little bit of Jack Nicholson in one scene and Rachel McAdams is very dramatic and intense as well in this one. Also, Jayma Mays is in here as well-didn't recognize her at first with much longer hair. Great thrill ride or should I say flight, the whole way.",1434067200,,387,4.243243243243243

5673313,5,B00BTYNXHS,"I'm female and 78 years old.  I was very pleased with the movie, and Amazon service.  I could not get the movie from Redbox, nor from my local library.  I watched the movie by my self and I screamed at the point where the girl, while in the airplane stabed the guy.  It came as a suprise.  I liked the way the girl handled herself in  a dangerous situation.  She was spiritually and physically strong.  For me it was a good movie.",1467849600,4,430,4.158536585365853
5673314,5,B00BTYNXHS,"Not your typical Wes Craven movie. Found it interesting, but not any edge of my seat moments. An OK movie for an OK price. Not a bad movie, just not a great movie. B.Beckner",1464048000,,173,4.117647058823529
