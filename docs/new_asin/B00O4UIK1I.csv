8682115,5,B00O4UIK1I,"a highlight match for me was the fight between heavyweights Anthony ""Iron shin"" Fuller and  Gavino Alvarado. it was a mostly  stand up style match that looked to be a mix of two different stand up styles. Alvarado was a local tribe member who had the cheers of this hometown crowd and started the match as a brawling puncher. heavy as this man was at 250lbs his opponent Fuller surprisingly had a weight and speed advantage weighing in at 270lbs. almost from the beginning it became clear that Anthony was the more technical striker as he showed off several muay thai kicks. one kick that landed to the mid section  caused a knockdown and Fuller to move in  with  several punches on the ground. our referee had to to stop the match giving Iron shin a win by tko from kicks and punches. at best the local fighter alverado did land a few semi good power punches into the face",1496275200,,873,4.43125
