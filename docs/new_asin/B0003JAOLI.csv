2155950,4,B0003JAOLI,"We're talkin' old school from the 70's with Stacy Peralta and some brief footage of Caballero when he was small. Wait, he's still small! Just kidding. He's a killer skater, even today! Classic footage of some 70's headband wearing, basketball socks up the knees, checkeredboard Vans, baseball shirt, surfer hair, and OP short shorts skateboarding. It's even narrated by the voice of The Simpsons' Troy McClure, Phil Hartman. If you were from this time of skateboarding, it's a killer dvd to have. If you weren't from this time, this is a good history lesson for you!",1238976000,,566,4.90625
2155951,4,B0003JAOLI,"I first stumbled onto this film about 18-20 years ago when it aired on local TV as a Sunday Matinee Movie and was hooked by the footage and the music used throughout. At the time I tried to get a copy, but it was out of print. DISCLAIMER: I am not a skateboarder at all but still found this film entertaining for what it is.

I'm glad it's been re-released, this time onto DVD and while this release is a burn on demand using DVD-R disc, it's still worth the price of admission for the fantastic footage of guys/gals skating if nothing else. While some of the tracks and footage get repeated, it's not all the same. The clear sphere like apparatus was used in a couple of different situations so while it seems like the same footage, it's not.

The ""plot"", if you can call it that was cheesely done. Kurt is OK in this film as the laid back photographer for a skateboarding newspaper as his job is put on the line for a lack of any decent photos. He's been sent to a skateboarding contest up in the city by the Bay (San Francisco) but in the end, misses the competition and ends up picking up 4 hitchhikers who were trying to get to that same competition and since it was too late, they decided to embark on a journey around the state to some of the hottest skate parks around at the time.

The footage is fantastic and that's about the best thing in this film, shot on grainy 16mm film, you get a good sense of the time, the era in which all of this hit. The fashions, the hair, the early days of skateboarding technique - all of it and for that this film is a fantastic document of the industry at that time was in its infancy still.

Since this film was shot over a 2-3 year period, you do see a progression of techniques during this film and other ideas like snowboarding using itty bitty skis on skateboards and you see wind skating, unfortunately, that fantastic segment ends much too abruptly and we are then back to the skateboarding stuff. Some surfing footage too and used I think to imitate a similarity (or two, or three) between the two sports but is just added fluff otherwise. I do like the continuity of Kurt and his enterage driving around in a 1959 red Cadillac convertible as a transition to the next spot.

Sadly, this film is saddled with a lack of a script, Phil Hartmann's narration style (very annoying) and the fluff pieces. But despite all that, it's a fantastic look back at a time when the skateboarding craze was huge and EVERYONE was doing it. Today, it's still quite popular, but only for a segment of society and it's annoying to have these modern punks riding  their skateboards down city streets and on sidewalks.

Overall, the music used within the film itself is great, especially the one that has Skateboard Madness within the lyrics with its rolling piano style. It fits in with the footage so perfectly and both shorts, the claymation at the beginning and the cartoon short at the end are nice additions.

This version is the print I saw, complete with the shorts intact. Sadly, I wished we knew if Kurt was successful and got to keep his job (probably not for the film seems to be taking months to ""take place"", noting in the beginning of the wind skating footage, his VO says in October...). Some niggly things to report, the audio is mono, not bad in and of itself, but it's not all that great sounding, could be much worse but it does mar the music somewhat and it sounds very compressed and loud with the bass frequencies squashed so it's not very good, oh its got some boom to it, but no definition when played over a good system though. Since it's a burn on demand, no menu or extras on this DVD such as commentary etc and the credits at the end do not really identify the music other than who played them so when you insert the DVD, it begins playing automatically and will repeat, at least it did on my DVD player/recorder. The only thing I can find in the way of music avaiable for it is My Wave by the Surf Punks, which I think is still available on CD but that's it.

I only give this 4 stars for it has fluff, the production quality of the storyline is weak and the audio but the footage of the skaters itself is very good.

As a documentary, it could've been so much more but it was not clearly defined as either a film or a documentary but I think tried to be both.

Still, I enjoy it a lot and have seen it twice 3 days so it holds me even despite the issues that plaque it.",1236988800,,4429,4.292215568862275
2155952,5,B0003JAOLI,"This video flat out rules. I got it just in time to play it looping on the big screen at a skateboard art show i was involved in recently in ojai, california. everyone loved the film and wanted to know where they could get a copy. phil hartman does an exellent job with the narration and the opening and ending animations are incredible. old school, funny, visually stunning and straight up historic. get it.",1216771200,,408,4.527027027027027
2155953,3,B0003JAOLI,"I saw this movie in a little theatre when it came out, years ago.  I was a little skate rat, and thought it was hokey, even then.  It's still downright silly overall, and the guy who plays ""mellow cat"" is just awful.  The skateboarding scenes, however, are worth the price of admission, even today.  Watching Stacy Peralta ride a cement half pipe is just so darn cool.  The other skaters are great as well, but Stacy's slides: rock walks, frontside powerslide on vert, and cess slides, are just the coolest in my book.  What is really visible in this movie is how much style and flow have vanished from skateboarding.  This is a great nostalgia trip for anyone who skated during the 70s.  The extra footage of Caballero at Winchester is pretty cool as well, and shows how influential he would become.  It's a fun film to see, nothing really more or less than that.  If you take out the silly footage of driving, eating, random stuff, the claymation cartoon, and the RIDICULOUS rollerskating footage, you get about 30 minutes of great old school skateboarding.",1122940800,4,1059,4.675675675675675
2155954,3,B0003JAOLI,"I do not know which ""version"" of Skateboard Madness this is being sold here on Amazon. Through the years, segments have been added to this movie to keep it relevant (snowboarding, punk rock, animated sequences etc.). I am reviewing the original 1980 version in this summary. If you liked Dogtown & Z-Boys, this film should be right up your alley. It features some great pool and pipe skating as well as tons of grainy 16mm footage of the 70's skate ""scene"". There is a thin plot about a photographer that travels around with a group of skaters that outlines many skateboard and some rollerskating segments. It also includes a Claymation animated segment about a rat and a hippie skating around a concrete skate park. If you love striped tube socks, long hair and Vans shoes, this is a movie for you.",1101340800,6,799,4.673758865248227
8035946,5,B0003JAOLI,"If you are a Lifer (like me) you will love the SK8HISTORY captured in this film -- The footage of Steve Cab at Winchester is worth the purchase alone........and the cheesy rollerskating footage is worth a good laugh.......Mellow Cat is a featured character persona for those of you that have a bunch of SKATEBOARDER Mags sitting around , you get to see what he is like in real life. All in all, a good watch if you are a SK8LIFER or Urethane Soldier.",1518048000,,450,4.433734939759036
8035947,5,B0003JAOLI,"Definitely an acquired taste, and it helps if you have a history in skateboarding and a love for its heroes and styles of days past. All tongue in cheek, with a killer 'made for the movie' soundtrack that is nowhere to be found. Recommended if you skated in the 70's or 80's or have a curiosity for what seems to have started paving the way for your wacky skate movies.",1478476800,,369,4.285714285714286

8035949,5,B0003JAOLI,Probably the best movie ever made.  Ok.. it's cheesy.  But what's to say?  Phil Hartman Narrating?  Every skateboarder should have a copy of this movie.,1381363200,,152,4.96
8035950,4,B0003JAOLI,"...between the Z Boys era and the modern vert skating of the 80's onward. Plus early footage of Steve Caballero. Way too much roller skating, though. Another bonus- commentary by Phil Hartman!",1379289600,,192,5.03125
8035951,5,B0003JAOLI,"If you were into skateboarding in the eighties, this video is the birth of skating in the late 70s and early 80s. You will love it.",1378252800,,131,4.076923076923077
8035952,3,B0003JAOLI,"When ""Skateboard Madness"" was first released on DVD in 2004, many people were disappointed with the release because the DVD manufacturer used an edit that was missing about 30 minutes of its running time. The movie was re-released on DVD in 2010, and since this release announced it was uncut, I ordered a copy.

First, the good news: This 2010 release IS the uncut version. HOWEVER, the DVD manufacturer used what appears to be an old television print of the movie instead of using a theatrical print or going back to the original negative. The visual quality of the movie doesn't present things at its best, to put it kindly. And while the DVD box proclaims the movie is at a 1.78 aspect radio, it is (you guessed it) presented in a full-frame version.

The movie itself is deserving five stars, but the DVD presentation only merits one star. Averaging things out, I am awarding the entire thing three stars.

(Note to potential customers: Read the listed details carefully on the Amazon listing of the movie, since Amazon is currently selling both the 60 minute version AND the 90 minute version. Be sure what version you are ordering!)",1358380800,,1139,4.742424242424242
8035953,4,B0003JAOLI,"As with reviews above and elsewhere on Amazon, generally I must concur. If you take out all the totally superfluous material added here in order to try and link segments together in a lame attempt to make this some kind of coherent 'story' what you are left with is some stunning and rare raw footage. It's quite a weird movie really: acting as wooden as the boards the kids are riding, along with some strange unnecessary sound effects and an even stranger narration in a pretentiously corny voice (sounds a bit like an amateur rendition of the voice at the end of the '60s Batman series); a 'claymation' animated intro sequence that I cannot fathom which seems to bear no relation to the film that follows, again with a very amateur 'character' voiceover. It's all mixed in with the odd attempt to bring it all back to some kind of storyline now and again.

I would so love to see the raw footage here assembled into a really decent documentary. I know we have 'Dogtown & Z-Boys' but I don't recall seeing most of this footage before. Some absolutely gripping footage going back to the '60s; also some '70s footage of Stacy Peralta working wonders. Someone remarked elsewhere on a review of this film that it does reveal how much style and particularly 'flow' has been lost from the sport, with which I could not agree more. The early influence of surfing being much more evident in those days. Even though there is much that grates about this film, the 'greats' still keep it together and hence still most definitely worth having in your collection, along with Downhill Motion, Spinnin' Wheels, Go For It, Magic Rolling Board etc and for this reason I still recommend!",1336348800,,1671,4.664406779661017

8035955,5,B0003JAOLI,"This movie is a bit of a mixed bag, which to me was very entertaining. Featuring skateboarding, surfing, kite surfing and roller skating with some of the best slow motion footage of bowl skateboarding i have ever seen, absolutely amazing filming.
Off course early 80's skateboarding is the dominant sport featured here and is very cleverly woven into a  extremely entertaining movie.",1277078400,4,383,5.17741935483871
