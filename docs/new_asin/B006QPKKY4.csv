5013457,5,B006QPKKY4,"This movie is long. It felt like watching David Lynch's Inland Empire; def the kind of flick that requires some stamina. That said, this movie is so deliciously weird and campy, featuring more Showgirls quotes and original cast members than anything I've ever seen; its even out-Showgirls the original Showgirls. With weird subplots revolving around snuff films and Wizard of Oz cults, Showgirls 2 makes it clear that Rena Riffel is a huge David Lynch fan. Any Showgirls fanatic or connisseur of bizarre cinema will LOVE this film! Rena truly is the Showgirls ambassador; strong work!",1347321600,,584,5.09375
5013458,2,B006QPKKY4,"I love B movies, camp, and so-bad-they're-good films, so I thought I'd enjoy Showgirls 2, I really did.  I'm also a huge fan of the original film, so I thought, how could I go wrong with the sequel?  Well, I could save time and write ""Everything Brent said in his review,""  but I suppose that would be cheating LOL.

I understand this is a low budget film, but I hoped for at least competent sound, acting, and camera work.  I've seen much worse, and I knew better than to expect a slick Hollywood mainstream product, but the amateur production values got quite annoying.  The changes in sound level and mumbled lines were especially frustrating, and no, there are no subtitles or closed captions.

I'm sure the actors and crew had fun making this film.  I did get a few chuckles from the references to other films, and the intentionally campy funnies, which gained Showgirls 2 two stars from me instead of just one.  My advice is to rent or borrow it if you think you might like it---don't make my mistake and pay full price for a DVD that will be going into my yard sale bin.",1342915200,3,1077,4.426395939086294
5013459,5,B006QPKKY4,"I heard that they were making a sequel to ""Showgirls"" not too long ago. One day I was messing around w/ my Google TV and saw that it could play Amazon Instant Videos. I've never done this before (because I'm not one to sit in front of my computer screen to watch a movie), but, I was so excited, I started browing the massive selection they have on here. When I stumbled upon ""Showgirls 2"" to purchase on dvd, I was ecstatic, and sad. Ecstatic because, well, IT'S ""SHOWGIRLS 2""! Sad, because I didn't have enough money to purchase the dvd. HOWEVER, I saw on the same page that it was available to rent for $2.99! Well, it just so happens I had $5 on my card :) I yelled to my wife in the kitchen and told her they had ""Showgirls 2"" for rent. She immediately got excited and said we had to watch it with dinner. When I saw the running time for 2 and half hours, I lost it! This is gonna be awesome!

We sit down at the table, and I hit ""purchase"". As soon as it's done, I hit ""play"".....
  I've never been so happy with a purchase in my life.

This movie was done with the intent of what movies are made to do...entertain. And, obviously, the only people that are going to check this out are people like me, who enjoy the campiness of the first classic film, ""Showgirls"" (which I own both as a deluxe dvd w/ a ton of extra goodies, AND on phenomenal blu-ray). Now, obviously, this is a low budget effort, and you're not going to get the same...how do I say...""film quality"" (?) of the first one. But, like I said, if you're a fan of the first one and you enjoy campy films, this is for you.

Is it laughable? Absolutely! But, Ms. Riffel knows this. I mean, come on, there's a section on her website titled, ""Versayce Boutique"" :) She's a fan of the first film (obviously), and knows it's cult royalty, which is why I loved this one. Some characters from the first one come back, making it all the more enjoyable. There's also a pool scene to almost rival the one from the first one.

Seriously, I can't recommend this enough. If you're looking for a serious film to spend a few bucks on, well, this isn't the one to do it on. But, if you thought the first one was ridiculous, and you're curious as to how Penny Slot continued with her life after the events of the first film, then please, I urge you...check this out. It's only $3!

Also, if you like what you saw, do an online search for the official website (it'll probably be deleted if I post it on here), and see if you can get ""Showgirls 2: Pennies from Heaven"" playing at a theater in your town!",1340928000,,2551,4.1938775510204085
5013460,1,B006QPKKY4,"I love campy flicks and adore showgirls, but this isn't even enjoyable. Bad acting (I mean BAD), bad camera work, bad sound (you seriously can't hear what people are saying sometimes), AND it felt like it was 100 hours long. After reading a review about how awesome this movie was, I can't believe I wasted money on this trash.",1338422400,11,327,4.559322033898305
5013461,3,B006QPKKY4,"Showgirls 2 is like a Cinemax soft-core porn without any actual porn. The camera work, acting and writing are all so bad that it crosses back over into being awesome...if you're into that kind of thing. I recommend watching this with a group of friends who are appreciative of the original and tossing back a pitcher(a piece) of mimosas during the viewing.",1332720000,,356,4.758064516129032
5013462,5,B006QPKKY4,"Showgirls 2: Penny's from Heaven is written by, directed by, and stars Rena Riffel-- she played Penny in Showgirls. Somehow, Rena managed to get several Showgirls cast members together for this sequel which I would call a spoof-quel. The returning cast members are the people who played James (he's the guy who gave Nomi's dance to Penny), Jeff (the guy who steals Nomi's luggage / gives her the ride to Vegas), and Phil Newkirk (the one who got yelled at because of the whole ""Caesar sing"" shenanigan). Also in the cast is Peter Stickles (while not from Showgirls, he has been in The Lair and Shortbus).

Those who love the original Showgirls (those who go to the midnight screenings, laugh their heads off, applaud and cheer at the pool scene, yell out ""different places,"" or bust a gut anytime Nomi hits anything) will definitely enjoy this endeavor helmed by Rena Riffel.

There is one caveat: it is not Showgirls. The cinematography, visuals, sound, and sleekness of the Showgirls 2 is incredibly... different from Showgirls. Showgirls 2 was made direct to video, and most likely on a very small budget. It looks like a very well-made student film, but in a way it adds to the fun, the humor, and the charm of Showgirls 2.

So, as long as you love the original Showgirls, this will make for a great viewing with a group of friends. Pop some popcorn, get ready for some thigh-slapping lines (this movie was really well-written, kudos are definitely deserved here), and enjoy a trip that many of us thought we'd never get to on: a trip back to see one of our favorite showgirls in action once again.

Five Stars all the way!",1326412800,17,1627,4.658536585365853
5013463,1,B006QPKKY4,We were so confused when the movie start. We thought we accidentally order a porn. we could't watch more then 5 minutes of the movie. We were so  confused and the camera work was horrible. Kids with an iphone would have filmed a better movie.,1433203200,,242,4.377777777777778

5013470,2,B006QPKKY4,"With the film quality and acting talent of a B-rate softcore porno, Showgirls 2 has very few redeeming qualities. It goes on for about an hour and a half too long.

The original Showgirls was great in its ridiculousness and campiness, but this film is just plain bad. And that's coming from someone who LOVES ""bad"" movies.",1403654400,2,433,4.786666666666667

5013479,3,B006QPKKY4,"Where do you even begin with this?  Porn-quality acting, basically no plot, shoddy camerawork, etc.  However, there is a sly sense of humor running through it, particularly in Rena Riffel's character Penny.  She has some of the funniest dialogue in the movie, although the movie is rather painful to sit through.  Some scenes just go on for too long, and the conversations are pretty ridiculous and go nowhere.  And the sex scenes/nudity are even less erotic/sexy than they were in the original Showgirls (which is referenced several times).  Ultimately, it is worth at least one viewing, but preferably with other people so you can collectively laugh at how bad it is.",1382659200,,669,4.981981981981982

Knowing full well that ""Showgirls 2"" was not made by Paul Verhoven, I wasn't expecting this film to be great. I had set my expectations at an all time low. It turns out, my expectations weren't set low enough. This movie was absolutly horrible. Bless her heart, Rena Riffle tried so hard to make a movie, but honestly I have seen better movies from high school film students.

The acting sucks, the story, the filming, the sound, the staging... EVERYTHING about this film SUCKED. OK... not everything, Rena was beautiful as always. I am convinced that Rena could have done better with the Crazy Horse circut. She is very beautiful, has a rockin body and she can actually dance, but clearly acting, producing and directing are not her strong points. I love a trashy ""B"" movie, but this one.... I will never, Never, EVER watch again.",1367366400,2,1033,4.639344262295082

Showgirls 1 has a special place in many people's hearts. What a missed opportunity. This stinker doesn't even meet the ""so bad, it's good"" standard. Just an embarrassing mess for all involved.
