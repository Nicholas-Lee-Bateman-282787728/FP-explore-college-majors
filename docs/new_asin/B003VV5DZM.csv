4212203,4,B003VV5DZM,"My 2 year old had the ABC's down, but all numbers were 2. She got this DVD for christmas and within a couple weeks was counting 1-10 no problem. She loves Elmo and is willing to watch him many times over which is great when she is learning something. I agree with other posts that the skip counting and math were a little unexpected and over her head. She still enjoys the movie, but is no longer interested in singing and counting along when it comes to the math. I'm sure she will still love to watch it over the next year and it just might sink in where she can enjoy it more.",1298246400,,579,4.087719298245614
4212204,5,B003VV5DZM,"My husband got this dvd for a xmas present for our 2 year old daughter...she loves it, it has all her favorite characters (minus DORA LOL), she loves the songs and tries to count with them.  It is a great way to reinforce what we are teaching her and what she is learning in daycare.  Even we like it ! She watches it a few times a week, and now she is starting to count with them",1297296000,3,380,3.9220779220779223
4212205,5,B003VV5DZM,"My almost 3 year old, Mister, has fairly mastered counting 0 to 10.  So, he had fun when Elmo and the Professor were counting.  He didn't really understand the skip counting or math that was included in the video, but that did not negate the fun of the video for him.  Of course, Sister just loves ""Momo"" and doesn't care what he is doing, as long as she can watch him.

4212206,3,B003VV5DZM,"This DVD should be split into two DVD's. One DVD for numbers and counting by 1. Another DVD for counting in multiples and math. Sesame Street tries to include both concepts in one DVD - which is a bad idea. My daughter is 20 months old and numbers/counting is fine. However when they start doing addition and counting by 2's, 5's, 10's etc, it totally loses her. How can a child grasp counting in multiples and math when they're just learning 1,2,3...10? I would've ended the DVD after the counting by 1 portion, but the math is mixed in. For that reason, I enjoyed part of the DVD only. The ""ABC's with Elmo"" DVD is a lot better. It focuses on letters/alphabet without attempting to include spelling also. Let children grasp the base concepts first - before moving on to more advanced concepts.",1284595200,20,795,4.566433566433567

8407114,5,B003VV5DZM,I listen to this about 5 times a week in my car while running errands with the girls.  It's quite entertaining as an adult.  There have been several times at red lights where I've crawled around the front seat of my van to see what they are showing because it sounds so funny.  My 22 month old loves it and speaks (trys) along with it when they are counting.  Great way for your children to learn if you are in the car on long road trips and need to use your phone.,1475020800,,465,4.021739130434782
