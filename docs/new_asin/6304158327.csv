794752,4,6304158327,"I got the subbed video version of this years ago; and it was one of the quirky strange little series that I've kept and enjoyed for years.
Ushio frees the powerful demon he names Tora to save his friends; and so becomes responsible for a monster who enjoys eating people, causing mayhem, and whose simple presence draws out ancient demons and evil from hidden places across Japan. Ushio keeps alive and ahead using attitude, temper and the ancient magical spear that once trapped Tora.
Visually, the combination of bright colours and harsh angled lines works. The Japanese subbed version was a lot of fun: I haven't seen a dubbed version.
The characters have a bit of depth, and do grow and change through the story. Nor are the monsters stereotypical. Some are immense and seemingly mindless, some are insane with grief and despair or the need for revenge, others are simply desperate. My personal favourites: the family of giant flying heads!
Ushio and Tora is a little odd, a little funny, and painfully sad in places. All of the characters are alienated in different ways, and looking to make sense of being alive and sharing that life with each other. Tora wants to both connect with and EAT the other characters - so some of the situations can rapidly spin out of control!
The episodes consist of short story arcs introducing different monsters. The issues get darker and more complex with each story arc, with human deaths, and more difficulty in finding the 'moral high ground'. The monsters are not necessarily evil: some were even once benign. But none of them fit the modern world.
All up: I like this series every time I re-watch it.
Bonus One: There is no huge cliffhanger at the end.
Bonus Two: The videos included some fun little shorts using the cute, squashed characters the Japanese love. I don't know if these will be added to the DVD. Also a lovely short where Tora adopts a kitten. If they are on the DVD, they're worth a look.",1050969600,5,1948,4.682215743440233
794753,5,6304158327,"The beast and the priest are at it again! Of all the shows I've watched, this has to be the best. However that sometimes it's just plain funny and cute, it does have a theme other than it's a good idea to kill bakemono if they start to infest your shinto shrine: friendship. Although Ushio and Tora start off as enemies, and wouldn't admit it outloud, they have a sort of special relationship... not sexual, mind you. I suppose it's because they have something in common, or that they have similar histories (which was explained in the manga, but oh well ^_^;;), but for some reason this youkai-killing duo is better than any other one out there. And Tora is cyuuuuuute, the fluffy man-eating kitty ^_^. I hope they release a plushie of him someday.",1003104000,,749,4.555555555555555
794754,4,6304158327,"I bought the dubbed version of this tape only because I thought it might suck as a subtitled.  Surprise, surprise, this was one of the best dubbed tapes I've watched.  Then I checked out a subbed and that one was pretty good too.  Even though the animation designs for the humans suck, the monsters are pretty well thought out and look believable.  If this series ever comes out as a DVD set I'm jumping straight on it....",998006400,,422,4.441558441558442
794755,5,6304158327,"Of all the U&T videos I have to admit that I liked this one best.  If you're not turned off by extreme wierdness and very gory anime, this one is for you!  The first flic (parts one and two) concern a humongous water-demon which (through various fights) gets vanquished by Ushio & Tora, and there are truly touching moments, particularly towards the end of the second part.  Nice.  The second two flics concern a trio of kamaitachi (traditional Japanese weasle-monsters), one of which has gone mad with grief and loss and is killing loads of humans in an extremely gory manner.  His brother and sister beg Ushio's assistance in ending the matter via assasination of their brother (most reluctantly), and things go from there.  Once again, emotional interplay is strong in this video.  I would rate the four episodes very highly, but would not recommend them for viewing by the younger anime audience-- the last two are REALLY bloody (people being cut in half, blood everywhere, etc.).  A nice ecological message is contained in the last two, though.  Everything gets followed up by a truly odd bunch of short flics, done in the ""super-deformed"" mode, and I suppose they're OK.  Watch the first four videos first.",981849600,,1212,4.839805825242719
794756,5,6304158327,"Even thought not as popular as series like Dragon Ball Z and Neon Genesis Evangalion, or even not heard of Ushio and Tora is an extremely funny show thats only downfall is that the series is kinda short.  The entire thing is  sort of like a japanese Calvin and Hobbes if you ask me(except with cussing  and violence) Watch it it's good!",947721600,,336,4.387096774193548
794757,4,6304158327,"If you like Takahashi's ""Inu Yasha"" manga you may like Ushio and Tora anime series!  ADV films has a mature audiences/Parental Guidance for violence and strong language for these videos.  I find them less offensive  than the ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th"" Movie series.  I watched this in a subtitled format so strong language that you have to  read loses a lot of the shock value. The character developement thruout  this series remains strong and you get caught up in Ushio's Teenage  friendship / romance / Love triangle.  The violence was nicely balanced by  the comedic scenes of Tora trying to cope with modern day city life. I  would have gave this video five star for content. I took back a star for  the high price.",947289600,,726,4.682539682539683
794758,4,6304158327,"I have provided voices for several dozen English dubbed anime titles, and this subtitled show was so appealing that I begged the company (A. D. Vision) to let me write and direct a dubbed version--which they did. Now,  purists will tell you that the subtitled version is better; I can't agree,  since after all I've got a vested interest in the dub--but this show is  hilarious! Ushio didn't believe his father's tale of a 500-year-old demon  in the basement, until he literally trips over the truth...and finds  himself the only thing standing between the monster and the anihilation of  his village. Eventually becoming a kind of ""buddy film"" across 10  episodes (5 tapes), this pair is riotously funny to watch. Buy this  subtitled version. Okay, compare it to my dub, if you want to make me  happy, but really--this show is great no matter how you watch it!

7863132,5,6304158327,"Many years ago, I saw a preview for Ushio and Tora on a VHS that I had purchased. I thought it looked pretty entertaining, and the theme song stayed with me for a long time, but I had never investigated it. Back then, even mini-series on DVD cost upwards of $40, and I simply did not have the cash.

Now, with DVDs being cheaper than ever (and widely available for many anime series), I decided to buy Ushio and Tora on DVD. I had not seen even one minute of it, or read a page of the manga it is based on, but it turned out to be one of the most fun ""blind purchases"" I've ever made!

Besides an incredibly memorable intro, I enjoy the title characters quite a bit, and each episode is action packed. There are far too many ""action""/""drama"" animes where each battle takes at least 2 or 3 episodes to conclude (the Dragonball saga is especially guilty of this). In U&T, there is no mincing of words, and I love Ushio's take-charge, no-BS attitude. In fact, I envy his bravery in the face of scary opposition! The character development is well-paced and enjoyable, and the series is replete with humor; I find myself busting out laughing at times! The relationships between the characters are realistically portrayed and often endearing. The vibe can go from fairly light-hearted to dark and gritty in no time; I find that this makes it dynamic, and allows me to take it seriously when needed, but laugh when appropriate. The dialogue is smart and very well-translated, the characters are distinct, and I'm always entertained.

Much could have been lost while translating U&T from a comic to a fluid animated series, but it was not: The heart and soul of the original incarnation of this story is very much present. There may be only 10 episodes to this series, but they are all done properly, and it is clear that a team of people cared greatly about the finished product.

If you're on the fence, or just haven't bought it yet for whatever reason, BUY IT! After watching the first episode, I jumped for joy because I knew I had made the right decision by adding this my collection -- just hearing the intro theme lifts my spirits. It comes with a few extras on each of the two discs, and the DVDs' menu is laid out very nicely, too.",1303084800,,2233,4.465686274509804
7863133,4,6304158327,"I found out about this show through a friend, and from the moment I saw the first subbed episode, I was hooked. I found a deal through an Amazon Marketplace seller, and I picked up a DVD copy for myself. My only complaint is the dubbed version... Just horrible voice actors.",1293580800,,274,4.392156862745098
7863134,4,6304158327,"I found this anime in a discount pile at Blockbuster day, on VHS. I decided to check it out. After watching the first two episodes I was like ""Woah, that was way better than I expected.""

It reminded me so much of my other favorite anime Yu Yu Hakusho, as Ushio has the same VA in Japanese as in YYH.

I knew I had to go buy the DVDs. I was disappointed to find that it was only 10 episodes....it follows the manga, but just ends.

The animation is great, the themesongs are....um...beyond awesome? The comedy/action/characters are superb, the only thing I don't like about this anime is that....it didn't finish.
I have no idea why this only lasted 10 episodes (11 if you count the chibi OVA)...such a letdown.

But still, this is good fun. Recommended!",1186099200,,754,4.481751824817518
7863135,4,6304158327,"I picked up this DVD set on a whim and it was much better than I was expecting. It's a supernatural story like only a Japanese one can be. The basic premise is very similar to the original Tenchi Muyo OAVs, only rather than a flirtatious and mischievous space pirate, the monster sealed in the family temple is a vicious lion-looking creature that vows to kill Ushio, the main character. Rather than live in perpetual fear, Ushio boldly tells the monster off, decides to call it ""Tora"", and then proceeds to free it from it's imprisonment out of necessity. The two maintain a hostile truce, though Tora tries to kill Ushio when he gets the chance, he is no match for the ancient spear that Ushio takes to bringing with him wherever he goes. Add to this a couple of girls who are friendly with Ushio, and a series of supernatural beings that the two must deal with, and you get a highly entertaining, supernatural action comedy. I found this series to be similar to, but largely more easily enjoyed than GS Mikam. If you've encountered any other Japanese horror anime like Mermaid's Scar/Forest or 3x3 Eyes, this series has much of their appeal, with more comedy thrown in.",1183075200,,1172,4.6124401913875595
