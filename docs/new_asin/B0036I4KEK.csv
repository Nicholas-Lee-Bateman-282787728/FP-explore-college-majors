After years working together the brothers would get into disagreements. I liked how a manager said he avoided getting in the middle of the brothers arguments. He said they were brothers after all.  In the end the brothers always got back together.

I could not stop watching, The Yellow Bittern - Life and Times of Liam Clancy. Liam lived in the States and in Canada but eventually he took his family back to Ireland to live. He wanted his children to know Ireland. I found these interviews and the video's of Liam's show in Canada fascinating. It would be great if this was made for U.S. and Canada.",1287532800,5,836,4.444444444444445
