8374986,5,B002NEODTA,"Torn, played by Chris Clanton,  a self-centered sex machine, is cold and causal in his relationships with the women he beds. After learning he is HIV positive, his callousness and coldheartedness pushes him further in the the ranks of the lost souls. Only when it is too late, does he discover how his destructive actions can, unknowingly, effect those he loves. An engrossing movie, at times witty, at times disheartening, TORN could make an excellent teaching tool in sex education classes as well as in independent film making classes.
