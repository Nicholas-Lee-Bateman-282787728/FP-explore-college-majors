7086719,5,B00VC1YFFM,"The 1970's classic PBS series ""Poldark"" gets a nicely atmospheric reboot courtesy of BBC.  The new version features a nice crop of actors, terrific location shooting, and a slightly modernized take on the basic story.  Ross Poldark, lately a Captain in the British Army serving in North America, returns home to Cornwall to find his father dead, the family estate in ruins, and his sweetheart Elizabeth engaged to a cousin.  Poldark, a moody and violent if basically good man, doesn't have to look far for trouble; it seems to find him everywhere.  The eight episodes of this first series covers his return, his struggles to restart his family's fortunes, and his troubles with women, whether his former sweetheart, a lovesick cousin, a raven-haired prostitute, and the young redheaded girl he rescues from an abusive family.  This is fun entertainment packaged up as period costume drama and romance, as only Masterpiece Theater can deliver.  Recommended.",1435795200,14,956,5.175324675324675

7086722,5,B00VC1YFFM,poldark kind of reminds me of a dark horse version of pride and prejudice and the Godfather with some Batman thrown in there too. I love how Poldark  really does not give a crap about what people think and does what he wants. I esp like the random nuanced facial expressions especially by poldark and demelza. Just letting you know the costumes are not very pretty and everyone looks dirty most of the time. But that's probably how it really was. But the story is compelling and makes you feel that you  can hope and dream and go after what you want even when everything including your heart is broken and you are a little cynical.,1435536000,,631,4.431034482758621
7086723,5,B00VC1YFFM,"Forty years since the first television adaptation of Winston Grahams Poldark series, directed by Ed Bazalgette presents a more compelling historical drama. Despite its popularity the 1975 television series is a slow moving costume drama. Nevertheless, both adaptations appeal to modern audiences not only as historical fiction, but as thought provoking social commentary on the stark polarities between the powerful wealthy and the grinding poverty and powerless of the poor. Just as Winston Graham tells a well-crafted story, Bazalgette presents an intense and spellbinding saga that even the time-poor cant resist watching.
Ross Poldark embodies many of the characteristics of Emily Brontes Heathcliff or a Byronic hero, only hes a more complex and well adapted character. He is very much an Enlightenment man, no doubt influenced by his experiences in the war with the American colonies. He is angry at the shocking imbalance of wealth and power in his society, has compassion for the poor and desire to see their betterment, and disdain for the self-interested and exploitative. Poldarks understanding of morality and justice is egalitarian and natural, not rooted in class blindness and prejudice. He is instrumental in establishing a cooperative to try and wrest financial and economic power from vested and corrupt monopoly interests. Furthermore, he is not afraid to bend or break the law or engage in acts of civil disobedience.
Poldark is not a happy, romantic costume drama. It is a dark, brooding tale and becomes increasingly darker as the series progresses. The rich and powerful exert a malevolent influence over the lives of the working class, and Ross and Demelza are also threatened by ruin through betrayal, jealousy and spiteful rivalry. The saga is full of personal and community tragedy. While Ross and Demelzas love story is a moving counterpoint to the wider social drama it never becomes the focus for too long and is cleverly interwoven with the broader concerns with class.
From a purely entertainment perspective, this is a visually stunning series. Sometimes the landscape appears beautiful and pastoral; other times hostile and Gothic.",1435363200,231,2165,5.351906158357771
7086724,5,B00VC1YFFM,"I never saw the original Poldark series, but this one is wonderful. The cinematography is beautiful, the story is engaging, and the actors are all perfect in their roles. My husband and I loved it and can't wait for Series Two.",1433894400,20,227,4.560975609756097
7086725,4,B00VC1YFFM,"Being Poldark veterans of the first TV incarnation the whole family waited in eager anticipation for this version and were duly disappointed and not disappointed in turns!  And as fans of the former its virtually impossible not to make comparisons.  The writer of this adaptation, Debbie Horsfield, clearly decided early on not to simply make a glossy replica of the much loved 1970s classic starring Robin Ellis and Angharad Rees.  It is to her credit that the finished article renders something that can justly be regarded as a refreshing twist on what many, given the response to the 1996 TV version of The Stranger from the Sea, starring John Bowe and Mel Martin,  regard as something of a sacred cow!

Ross Poldark is still the dark, handsome slightly dangerous but definitely dashing hero returned from the American War and Demelza the rustic maid who fights to win his heart, against what she perceives to be, at least initially, the overwhelming odds embodied by the moneyed society lovely, Elizabeth Chenoweth.  But these 21st Century incarnations of the Cornish lovers have decidedly different character traits compared to their 1970s predecessors, even if their underlying values are the same.

Winston Graham, Poldarks creator, could not of course, help but be influenced by his literary forebears: Ross Poldark, in whichever incarnation, bears strong resemblances to both Rochester (Jane Eyre) and Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights) as the strong and sometimes violent man with equally strong and sometimes violent convictions but also only too human weaknesses.  Graham, in his novel Marnie, created Mark Rutland, also something of a Rochester type character, played by Sean Connery in the Hitchcock adaptation, who rescues the girl Marnie, from herself by employing what now would be regarded as decidedly questionable methods; rape being the most obvious, which Hitchcock didn't shy away from depicting.  Thus, although there are dark and violent emotions in these Byronic archetypes, the present Ross appears to have been mellowed by Horsfield somewhat, perhaps in response to 21st Century sensibilities.

Aidan Turner in the lead role certainly has the obvious Byronic looks and Eleanor Tomlinson, as Demelza, though not quite so feisty as her TV forebear, the right combination of vulnerability and necessary steeliness when required.  There is too, a marked difference in the relationship between Ross and Elizabeth, and even George Warleggan seems slightly less reptilian than Ralph Bates played him.  However, although Im a Phil Davies fan (Judd Paynter) I don't think anyone will ever be able to replace Paul Currans brilliantly memorable Judd!

In short, its a worthwhile viewing experience: though a little too frenetic in places - for example, the motivation for Ross and Demelzas marriage is given insufficient development time - it looks fantastic and should do wonders for the Cornish Tourist Board!",1430265600,98,2924,5.3304347826086955
7086726,3,B00VC1YFFM,"Firs off, I loved the books and the first series, for what they were. This is not a review of Poldark the story or the other adaptations. This is a review of this series based on one critical error: FALSE ADVERTISING. The advertising on PBS (in the US, not the BBC One commercials, as I am in America), has portrayed this series as something entirely different from what came before, a new take on the story with a clear focus on the romantic elements (which are not the crux of the Ross Poldark section of the books nor the first series). However, that is not what this series is about and represents a clear attempt to manipulate viewers into thinking that this series is something more akin to Outlander and the like and less akin to the endless ""business"" focused series currently airing on Masterpiece. I'm sorry to say that it is this dishonesty that ruined this series for me as I viewed my copy expecting to see something new and different, taking the Poldark books as a jumping off point for a story focusing less on money and more on romance, a modern telling if you will. I figured, if you aren't going crazy with the telling of Poldark the rapist then, of course, you can change other story elements. Unfortunately, this is still a money-centered tale and the romantic element is significantly downplayed, as compared to what is promised in the commercials they are currently running.

So, for anyone who doesn't know, as to what Poldark is, originally. Poldark is a sweeping epic encompassing the lives of too many characters to mention and their descendants. Business, finance, plague, love, hatred, competition, and so on, provide the emotional backbone. There is a decent wiki article which covers this so I won't bore you except to say that, if you love complex epics, the books are superb. However, this series is the story of a man's quest for wealth and the similar quests for wealth of many people around him, to put it plainly. There are many characters in this story, from the books of course, but, much like the other ""wealth"" and ""business"" concerned programs on Masterpiece today, including The Paradise and Selfridges, money and business, the trials and tribulations of gaining wealth, keeping a business going, keeping from going under, and the like, are the primary concerns, not romance. Secondary concerns of romance, changing affections and one man's long term obsession with a woman he doesn't get (except by force) are also important but not as important as the money aspect (at least in the unedited version I saw from BBC One). I should note that, thankfully, the hair-pulling, rapist elements of the books have been left out to make way for a more sympathetic lead male and, for the record, I greatly appreciate that, as there can be no romance at all if a man is engaging is such horrific abuse of women. However, these kindnesses do not make up for such a focus on the business element at the expense of the lead relationship, in terms of screen time and development.

Now, this is not a bad series, overall. If you like stories that revolve around business, finance, competition, a region and all the businessmen in that region and their competitions over money and women, debt collection, trying to pull each other under, and so on, you will love this, as it has plenty of that going on. However, this was advertised as being DIFFERENT from the original series (1975 and 1977, which was wonderful as an adaptation of a portion of the book series and quite enjoyable, even if you haven't read this fantastic series) but this is NOT DIFFERENT. Is there romance? Of course. You can't have Poldark without the romantic entanglements of the lead men and women. But this was marketed as focusing more on or, rather, playing up the romance between Ross Poldark and Demelza, focusing more on them, in fact almost exclusively, with other story considerations playing out in the background, and comparisons have been made to Outlander (for no reason I can fathom) and this is simply just not the case. The whole landscape of class struggle, economic upheaval, propriety and fitting in with the wealthier crowd come to the forefront, with money and respect for having said money as a primary concern. This sort of ideology fit well in the era of the last series, leading into the 1980s, the decade of rampant greed, but, today, watching a woman work to fit into a group of snobs rather than conquer them with how different and special she is, not surprisingly, rings as false and uncomfortable and, again, anything but romantic.

Please don't mistake me, this is a wonderful series. As a well-rounded, filled up, cast heavy, character laden drama series goes, the new Poldark does not disappoint in what looks to be the first of several seasons. But, for those concerned with what was promised them in the endless commercials now playing, this is a terrible series as a romance and, again, given how much is going on in this series and how many characters swirl about through each episode, this cannot be called a romance. Like The Paradise and Downton, there are romantic elements, but, overall, it is another money-centric series. I took the time to watch this, having seen the original, a spectacle that I really didn't need to see remade, specifically because this new version was marketed as being different, as giving me more of the romantic element I wanted to see explored in this version. That is just not what this is and I can't figure out why PBS has been advertising it as such. There is far too much economic concern, dead babies and male competition, not to mention the unfortunate ending, which you can feel free to look up elsewhere if you like to know how depressed you will feel at the end of a series like this, for this to ever be a ""romance"". And so, while this is wonderful for what it is, with high production values and wonderful performances throughout, the money, the death, the depression, the lack of focus on the romance between the two leads in an effort to include nearly every character from the books involved here, it is not up the standard set by, of all things, the commercials for this very series. I almost wish I'd watched only the trailers for this, scenes of which come from only the earliest episodes of only the first season, rather than ruining the experience of the romantic element here, by viewing the entire series. The best I can offer is that, If you are interested in this series, and you well should be if you are not looking for a purer romance, then you can find enjoyment in it if you remember that this is a full series, like Downton Abbey with many plots and subplots and a lot of down time from the main characters. The romance is played out by the end of episode three (and there are eight in this first series/season, alone), and if sometimes it seems Ross Poldark loves another woman or his business more than the woman you want him to be focusing on, it is only because he does as, again, this is not just a romance.

Please remember, this is not meant as a critique of the whole Poldark universe, just this series' false claims and failure to live up to what was promised. I don't mean to offend anyone or for anyone to take my criticism personally as this is meant only to inform, not to harm. Thank you for your time and good luck in your viewing. I hope you are able to love this for what it is, as sweeping epics do have a place of honor and appreciation in our entertainment world as well as great value in our lives. And I hope that, if you've read this, you won't find yourself disappointed by a failure to live up to what PBS has promised with an unfortunately deceptive advertising campaign.",1430092800,40,7694,4.6385630498533725
7086727,5,B00VC1YFFM,"It's already a best-selling book series and a widely-loved television serial, but I predict this latest adaptation of Winston Graham's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poldark-novels/dp/1402225091/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poldark novels</a>&nbsp;- recounting the tribulations of British Army officer Ross Poldark - will be the next&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-and-South/dp/B000AYEL6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North and South</a>. That is to say; a BBC period drama whose sheer popularity takes everyone by surprise.

This is certainly helped by the presence of Aidan Turner (doing for Poldark what Richard Armitage did for John Thornton in his portrayal of a brooding and hot-blooded romantic lead) though there are plenty of other similarities between the two shows: the depiction of class tension, simmering love entanglements, a strong sense of time and place, and every character's struggle to reconcile the old world with the new.

It's 1781 and Ross Poldark has returned home to Cornwall after three years in the American Revolutionary War to find his father dead and his sweetheart Elizabeth Chynoweth engaged to his cousin Francis. Nursing a broken heart he departs for his family estate, now little more than a ruin run by degenerate servants.

That one of the first sights we see of Ross is him standing and ruminating at a crossroads is no coincidence, for soon he comes to a decision that will impact the lives of many. He opens his father's old copper mine, employing the desperate workers in the area and creating quite a stir among his peers.

The series encompasses a range of dramas, both local and domestic, involving Poldark's family and colleagues, tenants and servants. His cousin Verity for example, engages in a secret love affair with a man who may or may not be a wife-murderer, while Francis slowly succumbs to his festering jealousy of Ross; a striking portrayal of how an essentially good-hearted young man can be beaten down by expectations, bad choices, and the knowledge that he was his wife's *second* choice.

Meanwhile Poldark strives to keep the mine open, be a good landlord to his tenants, and do right by young Demelza Carne, a waif that he rescues from a street brawl, hires as a scullery maid, and gradually comes to rely on as a helpmate - and perhaps something more.

The cast is strong all across the board, particularly Aiden Turner in his attempt to prove he's not just a pretty face (though don't worry, we get to see him threshing corn sans a shirt) and the luminous Eleanor Tomlinson as Demelza. I've seen her play so many high-born ladies that I initially struggled to imagine her as a street urchin, but once her transformation takes place it's a mystery as to how Ross's attention could ever be diverted from her. Providing most of the laughs is the ever-reliable Phil Davis and Beatie Edney as Poldark's squabbling servants, and there's even a fun bit of casting with the appearance of Robin Ellis as Reverend Halse, most recognisable as the original Poldark.

Naturally comparisons with the original 1970s television series are bound to occur, though I think this new take on the material holds up well. The 1970s version unfolded at a more leisurely pace (which meant more time to spend on the supporting characters), but this one has high production values, with costumes and set designs that look attractive but also lived-in, as well as beautiful shots of the Cornish coast (one assumes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jamaica-Inn/dp/B00S8ONLPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jamaica Inn</a>&nbsp;is just around the corner).

As it's already been commissioned for a second season, ""Poldark"" may well prove to be a worthy replacement for the soon-to-be-ending&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downton-Abbey/dp/B00B7PIRIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downton Abbey</a>, capturing what audiences love most about period dramas: characters constrained by social mores, a vivid glimpse into the past, and the reminder that heart-ache and joy is a human condition regards of age, class or gender.",1428969600,365,4224,5.725677830940989

7086749,5,B00VC1YFFM,"... And the list of superlatives would simply have to go on and on.  The last time anything was this well cast, directed or acted, David O. Selznick was waiting for Clark Gable to play Rhett Butler and going through 1,399 other women to play Scarlett O'Hara before he decided on Vivien Leigh.  If WGBH Boston was a band, (Pink Floyd, for example), this would be ""Dark Side of the Moon"".

Much is made about Demelza's (Elanor Tomlinson's) ""feistiness"", complete with the iconic if artificial red hair, but it is her incessant compassion -- often at the most difficult times and in the most trying circumstances -- that makes her a true heroine for me.  As for Aiden Turner (Ross Poldark), the last time I felt so proud to be Irish, a new band called ""U2"" had just formed and he hadn't been born yet.

My better half got the first season for us from the library.  By about two minutes and thirty seconds into the first part, we were hooked.  We immediately got season 1, 2, and 3 along with the informative ""Poldark Revealed"" documentary about the show.  (The most intriguing part of the latter are the sequences of Andrew Graham reading his father's novels aloud, juxtaposed with their relevant scenes from the series).

In interviews with the cast and crew, the Cornish landscape is mentioned as an underlying ""character"" which of course it is.  But I would add that it is the ""zeitgeist"" of the last part of the eighteenth century, which fermented the American and French revolutions, and Graham's utterly unique ""coign of vantage"", that gives the whole story its lustre.

It's powerful enough, in other words, to enable you to forget that the South Pole is melting irreversibly; that two megalomaniacs are holding the planet hostage to thermonuclear war, and that what is left of democracy is slowly unraveling into a disinformation state.  Highly recommended!  One if by Land; Two if by Sea!  Pass the Brandywine!

For those few of us here gathered who may be interested in finding out about a real-life, 21st Century hero who is willing to speak truth to power, check out another Ross:  Ross Ashcroft, his documentary ""Four Horsemen"" and his website, ""Renegade Economist""  -- The Management",1512172800,,2200,4.790450928381963
7086750,4,B00VC1YFFM,"I've read Winston Graham's novels twice through. I visit Nampara in my mind and see the characters...as Winston Graham portrayed them. I watch the PBS rendition and it is entertaining.  The story line needed some short cuts and be streamlined as it would have been too expensive to stick to the original storyline. The biggest problem I grapple with are the actors themselves. Ross Poldark was very masculine, tall, gray-eyed with heavy lids, and hawkish in appearance; handsome in a way but more masculine.  He was a great combination of insolence yet possessing wisdom. He wasn't portrayed as petulant in the books and Aidan Turner has a tendency to be ""petulant"".  Demelza was described as dark haired, earthy, and ""handsome"". She wasn't what the age considered beautiful but she had a certain attractive quality men found irresistible. Heida Reed should have been cast a Demelza. I think she would have metamorphosed beautifully as Demelza. Elizabeth should have been played by Gabriella Wilde. She would have been absolutely perfect. Eleanor Tomlinson should had been given the part of Caroline. Caroline was outspoken and redheaded. The hair color of the characters are important in his novels. Consolidating the storyline, the producers do okay. But glaring blunders like Sam, Demelza's ""Methody"" brother, raising a rabble is a complete departure from the novels as is the storyline of Elizabeth abusing opium or whatever tipple the doctor gave her. I recommend buying the novels and really falling in love with the Cornish Ross, Demelza, Prudie, Dr Enys, Caroline, et al.",1511827200,,1579,5.184313725490196

7086778,5,B00VC1YFFM,"I first discovered Poldark on Amazon Prime, and had to have the DVDs for my collection. I had not heard of it, had no expections, and was stunned and surprised at how captivating this show is. It inspired me to read the 12 Poldark novels by Winston Graham, on which the series is based. The storytelling and production of this show are so rich, that it actually defies binge watching. You will want to take your time and savor it!

Aidan Turner is perfect in the title role, the ensemble acting is superb, the score by Anne Dudley adds unexpected dimension, and the Cornwall locations are breathtaking. The BBC/Masterpiece Theater production is intense, and the pacing is tight and riveting. It makes for great viewing, and I highly recommend the books too. Although there is still plenty of drama in the books, it is not nearly as unrelenting as in the tv show. I rather preferred to think that Ross Poldark actually got to enjoy life a bit in the pauses between the challenges he faces!",1502928000,,988,4.613636363636363

7086794,2,B00VC1YFFM,"Have watched the first series and working through the second as it is included with Prime. This is no North and South, Wuthering Heights, or Pride and Prejudice (1995). Beautiful scenery and a very hot lead cannot make up for redundant, typical themes, not enough secondary stories, an irritating, whiney, female lead, and weak scripts. The second season is worse. Viewers are desperate for historical dramas, especially well produced ones, but this was a disappointment. I would think the novels are more substantial but perhaps not. It's amazing the actors can sustain their characters and performances with so absolutely little to go on. Further, it's being hailed as taking on social issues, but it does so in a superficial way. Ross being outraged gets a little annoying after a while especially with his shirt constantly staying on.",1497830400,,838,5.124087591240876

So many good messages too and in a way close to life's journey though it takes place in the 1700's. You can still relate to some of the challenges. The photography is absolutely stunning, and very artistic. We love it, and wish  they would hurry up and release Season 3.",1497398400,,527,4.6063829787234045

7086810,5,B00VC1YFFM,"In the series ""Poldark,"" Aidan Turner stars as Ross Poldark, a young Cornishman who returns home from fighting for the British in the American Revolutionary War to find his father dead, his native land in economic hard times, and his love interest engaged to someone else.  This DVD set contains all eight hour-long episodes that were originally broadcast on the BBC in the spring of 2015 and here in America on PBS in the summer of that year.

Rather than leave for the city, Ross stays in Cornwall and begins to make his way there in business and in starting a family.  Poldark lives in the 1780s, but has a nineteenth-century outlook and was healthily out of step with many of the conventions of his time and placethe protagonist is decisive and an independent thinker, having no desire to participate in the drama and games endemic to the formal society in his locale and knowing not least of all that in the areas of vocation and marriage that his decisions were his decisions.

The writing is superb throughout the season but especially in the first episode in which there is much to take in and the storyline well establishes itself very early (this is not a show meant to be binge-watched, and sipped, not gulped).  As the series progresses, as one might predict, an eighteenth-century man who tries to live independently like Poldark eventually has to contend with corrupt, powerful locals who try to undermine him.  ""Poldark"" has as many plot twists and turns as one would expect from a great series and has a superb season-ending cliffhanger.

The series also has other strong, highly watchable characters, and as with other BBC series such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wallander/dp/B001VLBDB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wallander</a>&nbsp;set in a specific place, the cinematography is as good as it gets.  The bonus features about the series on this DVD set are good as well.  Some lament the fact that there are so many reboots in television today, but such complaints are out of place when the new series rival the high quality of their predecessors, here or across the pond.",1494028800,2,2139,5.088571428571429

Masterpiece:  Poldark  is it implied that the disk set is ONLY season ONE!  Not the ad heading, not the jacket photo, not the reviews - they seem to describe the complete series or perhaps series' to date.  But what you get DOES say 'Complete Season One' and, yes, that's what the disks cover.",1481932800,2,440,4.506329113924051

7086889,5,B00VC1YFFM,If you are a fan of Downton Abbey or British period movies this serious is excellent. A smoldering hero and plucky heroine and cast of characters that will transport you to 1700's England. Of course the villain is to be reviled. Highly recommend this series.,1480982400,,258,4.7555555555555555

7086894,1,B00VC1YFFM,"The war against white men is masterfully depicted in Poldark season 1.  With its gorgeous cinematography, gripping story, and fascinating characters, it is very effective at destroying our faith in the integrity of the men of this world.  Surely there were men of Cornwall who were not controlled by their lust, their greed, or their anger?  Sadly, none of them are depicted here.  If you are looking for a story with a moral hero who is faithful to his wife and his principles you will have to look elsewhere.",1480723200,,510,4.696629213483146
7086895,5,B00VC1YFFM,"Love the series. I really like the story, that time of history and the characters that star in the show. Of course my favorite people are Ross Poldark and Demelza. They are really trying to make their lives and Ross' mine work against all odds. I really like Verity who sticks by Ross and Demelza. I enjoy disliking George Warleggan because he is such a skunk and acts like he is better than anyone else.",1480550400,,404,4.4

I watched 1-2 episodes every night and fell in love with the characters, the story and the beauty of Cornwall (Aidan Turner as Ross Poldark is QUITE easy on the eyes which helps).  The DVD and season 2 are getting me through the Droughtlander until Outlander returns but this is a marvelous series all on its' own.",1478390400,2,415,4.52

7086912,5,B00VC1YFFM,I had recently come upon this series and was hooked immediately! We don't have netflix or any reliable service like that so I ordered season 1. It was a great price and great service. I have watched the whole season about four times and don't know how I'll make it to Nov. 22 to get Season 2.

7086916,4,B00VC1YFFM,The cinamatography and acting is excellent.  I have read the books and that may be part of my slight disappointment.  In the books there is more on the business and opening of the mines.  They could have had a little more about the smuggling done in that area and even Ross's involvement in some.  This would have made my husband a lot happier and given us something to watch together.  He lost interest very quickly and said it was more of a chick drama. He did like the characters of Ross and Demelaza.  I personally have enjoyed it very much.,1477612800,,545,4.4
7086917,3,B00VC1YFFM,"I purchased this as a gift for my grandmother, who is a fanatic fan of Downton Abbey.

Many of the reviews for this series touted this to be ""the new Downton Abbey"" and also compared the series to Outlander, which I disagree with.  After personally watching this series, I found it didn't draw me in nearly as much as Downton Abbey or Outlander did, and I found myself not particularly caring About the characters or what might happen to them next. This piece has good historical context, and you can tell the producers paid close attention to the detail of the setting and props, but the plot of the show itself and the acting isn't great.

This show felt much more like your run-of-the-mill period series than a drama that really draws in the viewer. Overall the show was entertaining, but I don't feel that it is comparible to some of the better recent period drama series.",1477612800,5,876,4.56687898089172

I knocked off a star because at this price (compared to similar TV series on Blu-ray) I was expecting a lot more ""extras"" than it has.

Some of the Les Mis, Colin Firth's Darcy in Pride & Prejudice...This production is Class A. The writing is sublime. Debbie Horsfield (I hope I spelled her name correctly) is nothing short of a genius! To take Winston Graham's novels plots, characters' developments growing from bud to full bloom with the turn of a page, let alone the intense interior struggles, and translate this work into a script is a talent uncommon! She is a DELIGHTFUL WRITER. (I dare say, as good as Winston! I think he would love her interpretation!)

You come to truly care for him, his loved ones, and those less fortunate he tries to help and care for.  You come to see that he is truly a good man, with a beautiful heart.  I loved watching Demelza transformation from a ""kitchen wench"" to a strong beautiful lady. Ross and Demelza are so wondefully matched.

7087009,5,B00VC1YFFM,"I first saw ""Poldark"" in the 70's or 80's with Robin Ellis.  Most dramas on Masterpiece Theater are exceptional.  This production was on TV and I hope it comes back for the second season.  It's a story about a good honorable man who almost lost everything except the rundown property and copper mine his deceased father left him in Cornwall.
He had been in Virginia to fight for England in our Revolutionary War.  His wealthy uncle and family thought he was dead.  His fianc married his weak, spoiled cousin Francis.  Lots of struggles and underhandedness to try and bring Ross Poldark down.",1466985600,,591,4.745098039215686

What can I say - this adaptation of the classic Poldark novels just has to be one of the best things on TV. And yes I do mean Mr Poldark himself but to focus on him is to undermine everyone else involved. Demelza, Jude and the entire cast to be fair are just how they should be. I picked up the books years ago to enjoy the most iconic novel of Cornwall there is. I haven't seen all of the old adaptation but this one is very well acted, full of drama and intrigue and the music in the background is stunning! Even the opening credits are a homage to glorious Cornwall where it's filmed.

Settle down with a box of popcorn, tissues for when you start to drool and a nice cool drink. One of the best BBC dramas in recent times.",1465689600,,737,4.075862068965518

Aidan Turner as Ross Poldark leads an incredible crest of story tellers. I remember SHOGUN with Richard Chamberlain that had that draw.  I can't think kind of another series other than maybe ROOTS that had you yearning to know what next.  I bought the first season DVD thinking that if would be casual entertainment like a candle light burns a month of dinners.  Instead, my family and I, greedily ate up the 8 episodes as a fuse burns on firecracker.  Cry we must, for now we wait.  Long live Poldark.",1463961600,,677,4.516393442622951

So much is left out that there's very little to it, and if I literally lost count of the times Ross rode his horse across one particular stretch of Cornwall's North coast.

But please keep in mind that I'm prejudiced about Poldark.  The original mini-series led me to the books, which in my opinion are among the best historical novels ever written.  I was already booked that year to go to the U.K., and Poldark - the series and the books - got me to Cornwall, which I love to this day.  The richness and depth of the books are incredible, and the original mini-series made a valiant and largely successful attempt to bring them to the screen.  All that is missing from the new series, which is simply about a series of events, rather than letting us get to know the people who experience those events.  It is shallow and rushed by comparison, and does not take the time to allow the audience  to get to know the characters.

7087087,5,B00VC1YFFM,"As a geologist and engineer, I have been pleased and impressed with the accuracy of the portrayal of the 19th Century Cornwall mining including the Bal Maidens who processed the ore before there were stamping mills and the mineralization within the mine.  I just wish they would show the workings inside the mine building in addition to the large smokestack because it was here at this very place and time that James Watt developed the modern steam engine (to pump our the Cornish mines) that enabled the Industrial Revolution, the benefits we enjoy to this day with our high tech civilization.  As a technical nerd, I wish they would show even more detail about the mining and geology of Cornwall.  As a dedicated horseman (I named my new horse Ross), I admire the expert riding scenes too.  As a man with (what I consider) a Social Conscience, I really identify with Ross' concern for the people working under him (as I hope I did).  I too tried to keep one of my crew from going to jail, but in my case, I was successful, I am happy to say.

I really can't say anything in praise of this series that hasn't already been said except that I have bought at least 6 DVD sets.  Each set I bought I ""lent out"" to a friend who never watched the series on TV for one reason or another.  So far I haven't received a single set back because the friends and their wives have loved the series so much they are reluctant to return them.  I don't want to press anybody for a return since I ""lent"" them out for them to share my pleasure and enthusiasm for the series, so right now I am without a series of my own.  I will either get a whole bunch back or none at all, but that is fine with me because it brings me pleasure to know that my friends are just as much in love with this series as I am.  By the way, I watched the older series on DVD that a lady friend lent me (and I returned), but I'm sorry, in my opinion, it doesn't hold a candle to this one.  Except for the last six years of Downton Abby, there is nothing that I have enjoyed as much as this series and I am impatiently looking forward to Season 2.  Oh yes, the music is outstandingly beautiful and I have that CD also.",1458777600,,2174,4.209638554216867

7087095,5,B00VC1YFFM,"I loved the Winston Graham novels upon which this series is based and adored the 1970s Masterpiece critically acclaimed television  series starring Robin Ellis as Poldark and Andharad Rees as Demelza. Then, there was a 1990s remake that was simply dreadfully and pilloried by the critics. So, I eagerly looked forward to seeing this new version and am happy to report that I was not disappointed. I loved it! this series fairly faithfully follows the  story of first two books, ""Ross Poldark"" and ""Demelza"", and ends with the beginning of the third book, ""Jeremy Poldark"".

When Captain Ross Poldark returns home to Cornwall after a three year stint in the Colonies during the American Revolution, he finds that life as he knew it has changed. His father dead, his estate left to rack and ruin, and his sweetheart, Elizabeth, engaged to be married to his cousin, Poldark must begin to rebuild his life. Then he engages a young, feral girl named Demelza as his scullery maid, and his life would never again be the same.

The cinematography is simply stunning, beautiful yet primal.  The music is haunting, harkening to a bygone time. The script is well-written, though it rushes through certain pivotal moments, as when Poldark proposes marriage, striking a momentary, almost discordant note. Though this pretty much how it happens in the book, it segues more seamlessly in the book. Still, this is quickly forgotten, as the viewer is swept away by the tide of events that tells so compelling and absorbing a story that is epic in scope. The cast  is superlative in its entirety, and Aidan Turner, as Poldark, is a standout, commanding the screen with his brooding, smoldering good looks, and his extensive thespian talents. I am delighted that season 2 is forthcoming and cannot wait to see it!",1458345600,,1794,4.904290429042904

7087179,5,B00VC1YFFM,"Fabulous view of country life in mid 1800s. Great attention to detail in terms of customs, costumes, etc. The scenery/photography plays a large part in this series, and is superlatively well done. Anchoring the people in the landscape means everything for this time period, and BBC nails it. Acting is fine, but I think the above factors render it a stellar production! Looking forward to Season 2 in 2016.  I did not see the older version of Poldark so cannot compare",1452470400,,468,4.777777777777778
7087180,5,B00VC1YFFM,"Absolutely one of the best series I've ever seen.  Ross Poldark is roughly handsome, passionate, determined, mostly angry and absolutely willing to do whatever it takes to make a life for those within his sphere.  He isn't one to stand by and allow wrongs to be committed if he is able to do something about them whether it's rescuing a young girl from a brutal life, rescuing a sick friend from prison or hiding someone who's running from the law.

Although Ross is a bit wild, he's considered enough of a gentleman that he's included in the gentry's societal events even after taking his serving maid for a wife.  Demelza's development from the lowly class she was raised in to her elevation as the wife of a gentleman is absolutely riveting.  Elizabeth, the past and somewhat ""current"" love of Poldark's life, although married to another, isn't the witch some have professed her to be - at least in this first season.  Since I've not read the books, I can't state whether or not her character has held true from the books to this series.

The constant hindrances of George Warleggan and his business associates toward Ross and his attempts to keep his mine running and food on the table of the local commoners, creates a type of angst that is more than slightly frustrating.  One thing I hated is that Ross has the most horrible, filthy servants imaginable running his household.  Ugh!  I look forward to reading all the books and watching next year's Season II.",1452297600,3,1465,4.6875

7087185,5,B00VC1YFFM,This is a remake and I think it's better than the original.  Research was done to make this series as close to actual as possible.

7087204,5,B00VC1YFFM,"A lot of SPOILER ALERTS for the past & present version.  Although I'm enjoying the wonderful Cornwall scenery and Aiden Quinn's performance, the story suffers in the re-writing versions especially when it comes to Damelza's character. This Dameleza, for example, lacks the first one's spitfire personality. This Damelza is almost too good to be true. She's so insecure & nice, I find her annoying at times. Compared to her fiesty counterpart, she lacks a strong personality and is written almost as if she's there to redeem Ross's failings. Also, this new version focuses on Poldark and Damelza's romance almost exclusively leaving Elizabeth out of the love triangle. Actually, there seems to be no love triangle all together. Damelza 2 doesn't run away after their first night of passion, which confuses Ross's reason for marrying her. Ross falls in love almost instantly, making little sense. This doesn't happen in the '75 version (streams on Amazon & Acorn). This new version also seems to focus too much on the financial matters of the mine, which is rather boring. The Warleggans also play a larger role and are around all of the time. We know that the young Warleggan is in love with Elizabeth in the first version when this fact comes much later in the '75 version.  In version 1, Elizabeth leaves Francis & runs to Ross wanting them to be together. Ross is delighted until he finds out that Damelza is pregnant and marries her out of duty. So he dumps Elizabeth while Damelza listens in the doorway. We, therefore, have a deeper understanding of Ross' s dilemma. There's just so much left out in version 2 that I'm not sure I wouldn't be confused if I hadn't seen the first version (or read the books, which I haven't). Now that Poldark is filming Season 2, I'm re-watching the '75 version. So much is left out right now that I can't help but wonder about their reasons for this. Time? Money? I don't know. Maybe the writers will clear things up in the upcoming seasons. I certainly hope so. Because the way it is now, the Ross & Damelza romance suffers in depth & understanding.",1448496000,,2088,4.733516483516484

There are very few actors that make my passionately talented actors list; Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson have joined the ranks.  They literally become their characters on the screen.  Such skill, talent, and passion in and for their craft seems an impossibility for two people so young.  All of the actors, the scenes, the storyline are perfectly suited and portrayed.  Masterpiece, I tip my hat to you for this broadcast, and for my set of DVD's.  I did think I had chosen the set exactly mirroring your broadcast, but there are a few different scenes.  It is all good though!  I am reading the books now and can hardly wait to see how beautifully the next season will be acted.  This series is by far the most exciting, real-life, full of moral lessons, bringing one to sing, laugh, and to tears saga I have ever seen.",1445212800,3,946,4.583333333333333

7087269,3,B00VC1YFFM,Liked the original version better. This version doesn't progress as far as the original version. It stops around the middle of original.,1444780800,2,136,5.2272727272727275

7087271,5,B00VC1YFFM,"I love, love, love this series! Top-notch acting! I first saw all but the first episode on PBS. I really needed that first episode to clarify what happens next. That motivated my purchase, but I might have bought it anyway because I love it so. I have re-watched it at least six times. The DVD contains the story broadcast in England; PBS had to make some cuts to fit into their time slots. Therefore, it was even more of a pleasure to view new bits. I cannot wait until the second season. I understand Aidan Turner is under contract for five seasons, so there is much to look forward to!",1444608000,,588,4.3545454545454545

7087274,4,B00VC1YFFM,"This remake is not as good as the original.  The difference is in the slightly different  and darker portrayal of the hero.  However,m I found the heroine a stronger and warmer character.  There was some departures from the story liine as it went along which I hope will eventually resolve the later chapters of the original story.  They wound down the story rather than wound it up in a well resolved end.",1444348800,,406,4.583333333333333
7087275,5,B00VC1YFFM,"BUY IT!!!!  After reading the novels, I have waited long for someone to make the books into an up to date series which PBS did!  They didn't put a foot wrong.  So beautiful and correct for the times visually, and the acting is superb!",1444348800,,234,4.2727272727272725

7087284,5,B00VC1YFFM,"Oh sweet mother, I am ADDICTED to this show!  It's like a mixture of Downton Abbey and Outlander mixed into one.  Every character is spot on and does a fantastic job at their role.  I also love the period clothing and ethics (often lack of) in this series.  In fact, I loved this series so much, I ended up ordering the books.  Plus, Aidan Turner?  RAWR!

If you think you can watch one episode and walk away, you are sadly mistaken.  Be sure to leave a weekend free, because you will want to binge and binge and binge.",1444003200,2,519,4.224489795918367

7087287,5,B00VC1YFFM,"Ross Poldark was portrayed by Aidan Turner with much energy and sensuality-and seemed to be a more intense and angry character than the  1970's Poldark. Beautifully filmed and good casting. As compared to the 1970's version, this seems to leave out some details of the Poldark family storyline and background but makes up for it with more action and realistic emotions of the main characters. Really enjoyed it!",1443916800,,411,5.044117647058823
7087288,5,B00VC1YFFM,It is encouraging that one can still find a wholesome show to watch. Getting really tired of the perversions Hollywood is trying to sell.  Poldark is refreshing,1443830400,,160,4.925925925925926
7087289,5,B00VC1YFFM,We watched this series on PBS and bought the DVDs because we loved the show.  This historical drama is set in Wales during the late 1700's and the tensions beneath the surface between the peasants and the land and mine owners.  One mine owner who is taking on the established separation between the classes is Ross Poldark.  His relationship with those in his upper class circle and his friendships with the peasants and with a servant girl shakes up the strict class system in Wales during that time.,1443830400,,501,4.670454545454546

7087293,5,B00VC1YFFM,Wow! Was a big fan of the original series back in the 70's. When this new series came out I was not sure I would like it. But by the end of the second episode I was hooked.

7087328,5,B00VC1YFFM,"This series is one of the best I've seen on Masterpiece Theatre.  I have collected British period drama series for many years (Pride and Prejudice,  North and South, Downton Abbey, etc.), and I was happy to add Poldark to my collection.  The cinematography on the English coast at Cornwall is spectacular, and very important to the story.  The scripts are well written, and follow the Winston Graham novels closely according to the experts.  The actors are impeccable:  Aidan Turner captivates as Ross Poldark, manly but impulsive at times, always passionate, and very attractive to the women in the series, Eleanor Tomlinson as Demelza will win your heart with her goodness, her generous heart, and deep love for Ross, Heida Reed as Elizabeth Poldark wins admiration for her class and breeding, but pity for her selection of Ross' cousin, Francis, as a husband.  The stories paint a vivid picture of life in a coal-mining area of England, and show us the contrast in the lives of the upper crust as compared to the common folk who work the mines and the fields.  I look forward with anticipation to the second season of Poldark..",1442016000,3,1130,4.848958333333333

Never saw any of these actors in this ensemble before but they are just wonderful to watch.  Great acting from all.  Each character is well-drawn and oh-so-human.  But Aidan Turner as Ross Poldark - oh my oh my you are absolutely fabulous!  I did not think anybody could replace Toby Stephens's Mr. Rochester in Jane Eyre (another Masterpiece Theater 2006) but when I watch Aidan Turner as Ross Poldark, I'm like Toby who?  Just one facial expression from him can knock the air right out of me.

Masterpiece keeps getting better and better.  But where is season 2?  I'm already going thru withdrawals.  Oh Ross how I miss you so.",1441756800,,749,4.507462686567164

7087368,5,B00VC1YFFM,Okay...who would have thought this would be this good??? The original Poldark was wonderful. This one is as good if not better.

However after watching several episodes, I grew to love this show beyond just Aidan Turner's character. This show has everything one would want in a period piece: fabulous actors, gorgeous costumes and scenery, history, drama and romance.

7087402,5,B00VC1YFFM,"A new series based upon Winston Graham's Poldark novels.  A caution like all adaptations this one takes some liberties with the books and alterations occur that change it from a strict interpretation.  That said I would say it stays remarkably close to the novels this season covers the first and second of the novels.  The end of the season prepares for the third book in the collection.  Ross Poldark returns home from war only to find his father dead, his inheritance in disarray, and the girl he thought to marry no longer his.  Ross must find his way and restore what he can but in order to do so he has little to avail himself of only a meager source of funds and his own strength.  He begins to find out how changed his world has become and that there are forces that will seek to prevent his success.  During his struggle however, he finds help from old and new friends that help him survive.",1440633600,,900,4.418181818181818

7087419,5,B00VC1YFFM,Wonderful rendition of the classic story. Beautiful landscapes of the Cornish country side enhanced the story line. All  the actors were superb in their parts.

7087450,5,B00VC1YFFM,"I absolutely love this show - it is officially one of my favorite shows of all time!  It is very much in the same category as shows like Downton Abbey in that it is a British romantic period television series, and yet the story is different from Downton.  This series focuses a little more on the relationships between the main characters, particularly the romantic relationships, than Downton did.  For this reason, I actually like this show even more than Downton Abbey.  The writing is really great and the acting is fantastic as well.  Here in the States, it seems like almost every show these days is a reality show, and while there's nothing wrong with those either, it's so nice to watch something with an actual plot and a great script and really talented actors.  I can't wait to see what happens in the next season!  Highly recommend this show!!",1439510400,,855,4.66

7087452,5,B00VC1YFFM,"This is television as it should be.  Scenery is gorgeous, music is beautiful.  Being from a copper mining area myself, the story is fascinating. One of the most romantic pieces I've ever seen. I don't think anyone could have played Ross Poldark as well as Aidan Turner (even though it's been done before).  The facial expressions are a performance in themselves.  I would recommend this series to anyone who has had it with regular television programming and the violence, language and smut it contains. These characters are polite even when they are stabbing you in the back.  Can't wait for season 2.",1439510400,,602,4.862745098039215
7087453,5,B00VC1YFFM,"This is my second encounter with Poldark.  I watched the original version in England in the 1970's.  I returned to the U.S.A. before the
series was over so I am looking forward to the end of this version.  The British do period pieces with wonderful detail and select the
very best actors to portray the characters. The scenery is beautiful,it has adventure, love, sorrow and all human emotions.  Just wonderful!!",1439510400,,413,4.857142857142857
7087454,5,B00VC1YFFM,"There's not much I can add in terms of extolling the virtues of this series.  Others have done a good job of that.  No, I write these words as a caution for those viewers who might contemplate making the mistake I almost made in viewing it.  To wit, be patient; don't be hasty in dismissing it.  After the second episode I was about to stop watching it.  Why?  Well, because it was somewhat plodding.  It lacked a certain kick required to maintain my interest.  By episode 3 things started coming together.  I'm glad I ignored my intuition (which I usually rely upon, for it seldom lets me down).  This is a great production.  First-rate all 'round, especially the location shooting.  There's a certain beauty to the cinematography of the bleak Cornwall land/seascape.  That said, this is not feel-good story telling.  The lives of the people here depicted seem to consist of one calamity after another.  There's not much uplifting happening here.  Their lives are as bleak as the landscape.  Disease, pestilence, graft, corruption, hypocrisy, unfulfilled ambition, bad teeth, short & brutish lives, etc.  And worse--no internet.  (!)  I thank the Lord every day that I was born in the present times.

Anyway, great casting, costumes, sets, etc.  Enjoy.",1439424000,,1253,4.923076923076923

7087475,3,B00VC1YFFM,"Was excited that a remake of Poldark was coming to PBS, but was disapointed in the production.  It was ""large"" with wonderful scenery, but cut out so much of the originial story.  If you had seen the original production from the 1970s you understood more of the details, like Mark Daniel and karen, how they met why they married.  Much of the interaction between Poldark and the military was omitted ie, the smuggling part where Ross hides down in the ""hole"" in the floor while the British captain waits with Demelza, Judd and Purdie for him to come home.  Ross was in that hidy hole for quite a long time, the captain finally gives up and almost but not for sure believes Delemza that Ross is not home.  Ross and Demelza the relationship develops in the first production, in the new one it just happens. Other relationships were omitted in this remake. Yes we did enjoy watching it and will continue to watch if a second season is produced and aires.",1439164800,5,951,4.538011695906433

7087517,5,B00VC1YFFM,"A real Super Soap Opera.  We can't wait for a next season!  Meanwhile, we can watch this series again, marvel at the many weed close-ups and endless sunsets and people riding horseback along the cliffs.  I wonder if the hero did all the riding.  The Extras were a little confusing on this point.  If he did all that riding, then he must have had to stand up a lot for lunches and dinners.  Saddle sores, anyone?  Another thing:  after watching this drama, my wife refuses to let me take in that cute redhead now living under the freeway underpass near downtown Poorville.  That would upset the neighbors, and the girl's grubby family.  Maybe even a priest or two, locally.  Ironically, my state is in controversies over mining.  There hasn't been this much violence over and within mines since IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.  Both of those 1950s movies had romance, but not quite on the same level as Poldark with all the gorgeous women orbiting around him.",1438300800,,987,4.635838150289017
7087518,5,B00VC1YFFM,Fantastic!,1438300800,,10,10.0
7087519,5,B00VC1YFFM,"Perhaps I'm putting too much stock in the sexy, brooding, handsome lead, Aidan Turner (Ross Poldark), but I'm enthralled with this series.  Didn't see the '70s version, but Turner, writer Horsfield, and director wanted a fresh look at this fine collection of Winston Graham's novels, and have said so in numerous interviews.  It doesn't disappoint at all.  Comparing it with Downton Abbey is off the mark, as they are really two different types of shows.  While Downton is a showpiece of period drama, characterization, wit, and plot, Poldark is also an adventurous period drama, character, plot and action in a historical series.  They are set in two different eras of British History, although there is the common theme of class distinction and societal changes in both series. Much as I love Downton, I don't compare it to Poldark - perhaps Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre is more to the point.  It's a welcome fresh drama, lush romance and societal/class conventions that ebb and flow with the gorgeous Cornish coast - a big part of the plot in itself, as well as the themes of affluence, poverty, social status. Although reckless at times, Ross Poldark, has a finely tuned moral compass.  He's no saint, but he has heart, empathy, passion, and he and Demelza (Eleanor Tomlinson) are a lovely twosome, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. They are certainly less staid and conventional than most of the Downton characters. There is a massive cast, many plot turns and twists, family jealousy and rivalry, above which Ross and Demelza rise and move the series along with passion, caring, wit and liveliness.  The best of Masterpiece, in my opinion, since Downton; perhaps that's why all the comparisons to it.  That BBC picked up a 2nd season before the 1st one aired tells me that they have a HUGE HIT on their hands. I just hope Americans watch and enjoy it as much as the Brits have.  I certainly have, and look forward with sadness to see the end of Season 1 Sunday, August 2.  I hope the series garners some well deserved British and American awards, especially for the daunting, smoldering, brilliantly beautiful Aidan Turner - with or without shirt!!",1438300800,8,2168,4.864130434782608

It is so easy to fall in love with the Poldarks. Aidan Turner is great as Ross, gloomy, handsome, strong and a rebel. Eleanor Tomlison as Demelza is lovely, strong, but delicate and perfect for Ross.

The other actors are very good as well and well chosen for the parts they play. Every time I see Ross riding his horse fiercely from his house to his cousin's house I want to book a trip to Cornwall.

Nice eye candy too, though that is not as important as his fine acting.  The actress who plays Demelza, Eleanor Tomlinson, also does an excellent job.

7087543,4,B00VC1YFFM,"Entertaining series and well worth watching. My criticism would be that it goes too fast and leaves out much of the development of characters and relationships which I would have liked to have seen. Especially as it relates to Ross and Demelza. Their relationship grows over 4-5 years in the first book before they are married. And still, the pace is never dull in the books. I think the TV series could have benefitted from either a few more episodes or in sticking with the first book instead of the first two books. Still, if that's my only complaint then I suppose they've done a tremendous amount right! Great scenery, acting, characters and stories. Highly recommend.",1437264000,4,673,4.810344827586207

I saw the original Poldark from the 70's last summer and to my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed the whole collection. I have to admit that this updated version did it justice...the BBC and Masterpiece never fail to produce a quality product!",1436918400,5,374,4.28169014084507
7087552,4,B00VC1YFFM,"Well, what can one say? The romantic coast of late 18th century Cornwall, the dark, sultry Aidan Turner as the well-born and intrepid Ross Poldark, defying local convention and hard luck upon returning home after some years as a soldier . . . I've been watching this in my area on PBS right after Season Two of ""True Detective"" on HBO - and the two shows make for a very entertaining if contrasting back-to-back two hours of Sunday night television!

The story lines are fairly predictable even if you didn't read the original novels by Winston Graham or see the original Masterpiece Theater production of 1972 with Robin Ellis in the title role. Everyone in the cast inhabits his or her slot perfectly, including the late and I'm sure much-to-be-missed Warren Clarke as Ross's sly, curmudgeonly, but uncompromisingly clear-sighted Uncle Charles - Clarke died shortly after filming this. Eleanor Tomlinson, all grown up from her first role as the young Duchess in ""The Illusionist"" makes a sympathetic and charming ""Demelza"", the feisty kitchen maid who snags Ross's heart.

""Poldark"" is just a few steps up from a ""bodice ripper"" (but a very high quality one). There is not much depth or mystery here, so it is up to Aidan Turner to carry this and make it worthwhile, and carry it he does, beyond what he can do with just his looks, which would only have taken one past the first episode. Turner brings a naturalness to the character of Ross, even if the producers did send him off to the gym to get a bit too ""ripped"", as they say, for an 18th century gentleman. A former professional competitive ballroom dancer, it wasn't as if the 32-year-old Turner wasn't already in good shape, as could be seen in Being Human, Hattie, and Desperate Romantics, in all of which he appeared periodically in a state of undress. But the suspiciously 21st century gym body is the only jarring note of modernity here and not Turner's fault.

The program's huge success in Britain and the US is justly down to Turner, and may just do for him what ""Sherlock"" did for Benedict Cumberbatch. I've been aware of Turner since I saw ""Hattie"" and wait with interest to see if he can make the transition from television heartthrob to big-screen one. So far, Turner's two screen roles have been minor (Kylie the Dwarf in ""The Hobbit"" series and ""Luke"" in the disappointing first filmed installment of the ""Mortal Instruments"" series) - we'll see if his success in carrying ""Poldark"" on two continents leads to better and bigger movie roles.

A very enjoyable series - beautifully photographed on location, and I understand that after it premiered in Britain, realtors in Cornwall were inundated with international inquiries about purchasing property there: not hard to understand why after viewing its lush yet rugged environs!",1436832000,10,2800,4.851464435146443

When all was said and done and feeling a little lighter in the wallet, I must say the series did not disappoint and neither did the resolution of the viewing...neither sad nor wiser.",1436832000,2,426,4.618421052631579
7087554,4,B00VC1YFFM,"Good remake of a classic Masterpiece Theatre:  I have to say upfront that the 1970's version is my all-time favorite Masterpeice Theatre presentation. However, I will try to be objective in evaluating/comparing this remake of the original. The biggest drawback of the remake: the casting. Compared to its predecessor, the casting is rather bizarre and somewhat uninspired; the most obvious being Jack Farthing as George Warleggan as a far departure from the character in the novels. Not that Ralph Bates was much more appropriate. But like Bates, Farthing does the best he can. Overall, the acting in this new version is not quite up to the quality of the original. However, although Robin Ellis is THE Ross Poldark, (Nice touch to have Robin play Dr. Rev. Halse) Aidan Turner is very good in the role. And once she put a little more spunk and spirit into her Demelza, Elinor Tomlinson gives Angharad Rees a run for her money. Although Demelza in the books had dark hair,it is interesting/amusing that BBC is determined to make her a redhead! What I like better about this remake: the script and dialogue is more faithful to the novels. I only have to hear the first few words of many sentences and from reading the books, I already know the rest of what will be said. And although the 1970s version shockingly left out the pilchard fishing scene so pivotal to the development of Ross and Demelza's relationship, the 2015 version at least partially depicted it. To conclude, although this version falls a little short of the high standard set by its predecessor, I still recommend it strongly.",1436745600,10,1593,4.835164835164835
7087555,5,B00VC1YFFM,"new version of Poldark even better than the original.  I usually dislike remakes but this is the first time in which I find myself being contrary! Casting and acting is superlative to the original as is the character development.  Mr. Turner and Miss Tomlinson are Ross Poldark and Demelza Poldark, without question.",1436745600,3,316,5.0576923076923075
7087556,5,B00VC1YFFM,"This 2015 version of the Poldark series attempts to be true to the characters in the Poldark novels.  I had really enjoyed watching the original BBC version on Masterpiece Theater and was skeptical initially with the casting of this version since I was familiar with only Aidan Turner from The Hobbit who plays Ross Poldark.  This updated version attempts to be realistic to the hard life of the poor as they lived in Cornwall in the late 1700s and the screen writer portrays the characters so well you can understand if not empathize with each and their reactions to the harsh reality of their lives.  This series is currently being shown on Masterpiece Theater and after watching the first episodes I ordered the complete first season.  As usual in an ongoing series, there is a cliff hanger at the end of the first season and you will wish you could immediately watch season 2.  Bravo to the British--another wonderful series for Masterpiece Theater fans!",1436659200,6,958,4.817073170731708

7087559,4,B00VC1YFFM,"As a devoted fan of Graham's entire Poldark saga and the original series, I found this adaptation, while compelling in its own right, to be extremely abridged and it is my one disappointment with the production.  The elements for more character development and story depth were certainly present---an undeniably gifted actor in the stormy lead, a very good supporting cast, stunning location and a timeless literary work---but was simply too rushed.  Having said this, the dark, moody undertone of the actual written story was captured very, very well.  It may be an odd observation, but I wonder the reasoning behind having Dwight, George and Francis wear Regency hairstyles in the 18th century?

Caroline Penvenen is my favorite character, both in the books and in the original BBC adaptation, and I look forward to seeing how her character is portrayed in the continuation of the series come 2016.

I would give this series 4.5 stars if it were an option.",1436572800,5,958,5.0
7087560,5,B00VC1YFFM,Poldark is one of the BEST DVD's I have bought. The scenery by the sea is so beautiful. The characters are well portrayed. Couldn't find a more handsome leading man. I watched several episodes at a time because I just couldn't turn it off!!  I stayed up late watching & only have one episode left. I can't wait to find out how it ends this weekend. What a great DVD!!!!!!,1436572800,5,371,4.3
7087561,5,B00VC1YFFM,"(SPOILERS) Even better than the original - but then, they only had one camera!  Follows the books much more closely, and we really get to see Cornwall.  Love the scenery.  Those of us who have read all the books (more than once :->) realize the 'telescoping' involved.  But that's encouraging.  I think it means they're going to get further into the books than the original series.  There are minor changes which make it all happen more easily - for example, Captain Blamey lives much closer than in the novels - but there's no place where I see the license being taken causing any problems.

Little things mean a lot, and one of the disappointments in the original (Robin Ellis didn't like it, either) was having Ross marry Demelza only after she became pregnant.  That makes him a different kind of man than the one who was portrayed in the books (and who is portrayed, here). They got it right this time around, and that's much appreciated.

Appreciate the humor.  A scene where Demelza places dinner items on the table at the exact moment Ross is asking for them was perfectly done.  Also, they got the cast members' ages right, this time.  (I could never figure out, in the original, why George Warleggan was so much older than Ross.  They were classmates.).  And having Robin Ellis portray Reverend Halse and face ""himself"" was fun.

Much like the remake of ""South Pacific,"" with Glenn Close, even the wardrobe makes more sense.  ""Regular"" clothes are more natural, more like something people would actually own/wear.

This is going to be a keeper.",1436486400,12,1554,4.7388059701492535
7087562,5,B00VC1YFFM,"A quick word from an obsessed Poldark fan across the pond.  I've seen the whole series.  I bought the UK DVD (and the music CD) from Amazon UK, and posted comments on the UK Amazon site (you can see my confirmed purchase there).  But thought maybe some comments on here, too, might perhaps be of some interest?

Firstly, LOOKS like you are getting the FULL version, not the cut version that I gather PBS/Masterpiece is currently airing?  If so, that is great because every minute of this wonderful adaptation matters.  This is a fast-paced story, covering a huge amount of material in the novels in all-too-little time.  So cutting ANYTHING risks losing the plot!

And yes, wonderful.  I don't use that word lightly.  But this is a simply superb new adaptation of the first two of Winston Graham's brilliant novels. The cast is amazing, and the two leads are beyond amazing.  The casting, the acting, the script, the cinematography, the costumes, the music, the scenery - even the weather, and the horse and the dog! - are all outstanding.  Aidan Turner gives an absolutely virtuoso performance that just HAS to win him awards. As does the lovely and supremely-talented - and quite stunning - Eleanor Tomlinson.  You'll be hearing a LOT more of her in future - perhaps the best young British actress to emerge since Keira Knightley? These two play their roles as much with expression and body language as with dialogue.  Their scenes together are just magical to watch, and include both the most moving and magical, and the most moving and powerful, scenes I think I have ever seen in TV drama.  You'll also see that Eleanor is a lovely singer too!

Have to give a massive rap to the scriptwriter, Debbie Horsfield.  This adaptation is quite faithful to the books, without being slavish to them (more so than the previous one was) and she has used quite a lot of the dialogue from the books. I've never seen a better adaptation for screen than this one - it ranks alongside Andrew Davies' outstanding ""Pride & Prejudice"" adaptation from 1995.  Indeed, that was the benchmark against which future historical fiction adaptations would be judged, IMO, and this one is easily as good.  Episode 4 is the most moving and magical hour of TV drama I think I have ever seen; episode 8 is simply the most powerful, most emotionally-pummelling I have ever seen. Great stuff!

Those who have seen and love the previous adaptation: I would urge you to approach this as a new, and subtly-differerent, adaptation not as a ""remake"". If you can avoid the urge to forever compare the two - which IMO may ruin your enjoyment - I would hope most will conclude (as I have) that both adaptations are outstanding, and are sufficiently different to be able to thoroughly enjoy each on its own merits. Personally, I could never imagine anything approaching, let alone bettering, the previous adaptation, nor the wonderful Robin Ellis and Angharad Rees.  But I was wrong. IMO This one, and Aidan and Eleanor, do.  I'll leave it to you to decide whether it approaches or betters its predecessor; I am already clear which it is for me.

Writing this because I've been loving reading in social media how you so many of you guys are clearly enjoying this series, now it is airing, as much as I and so many others over here did. Don't know about you, but when I really enjoy something I just want to share it.  I'm sure you will really enjoy this DVD!",1436486400,143,3420,4.671118530884808

I've never knew there were books about the main character, but it's entertaining to watch. Although, if some women are expecting this to be like a Jane Austen book, then you'll be disappointed. Even though the synopsis may appear to be romantical, it is, but not in a dreamy, Disney way. Yes, Aidan Turner looks hot on a horse, but he's not a prince, he's a struggling war veteran coming back home to a uncertain future.",1436313600,,597,4.537037037037037
7087566,3,B00VC1YFFM,"I'm a little disappointed with this new version of Poldark (I never saw the first one). I find the actors that portrait the two main characters, Ross and Demelza, very attractive but their story does not develop, so it is hard to understand why Ross marries Demelza so soon. My opinion is that the pace goes too fast so that is why if you do not read the books or go to Wikipedia, you don't understand that takes some years for their marriage to take place. Instead of spending so much time riding  I would have spend more time developing their love story (Ross is always riding by himself or with Demelza and my question is why cannot Demelza ride another horse).",1436140800,4,664,4.442622950819672
7087567,5,B00VC1YFFM,"The 2015 version of Poldark is unlike the wildly popular 1970s version of the saga in that it is a carefully and even meticulously faithful dramatization of the Winston Graham novels.  Author Winston Graham (died in 2003 at age 95) was furious at the dramatization of the 1970s that depicted Demelza as a flirtatious and sexually active youngster.  The first series added many side plots and romantic tensions that do not appear in the books, but which were certainly the inventions of TV writers who wanted to be sure that the viewing audience would ""tune in next week"".  Colorful and interesting as it was, the new series tends to be more realistic and historically accurate.  (Sums like 1,000 pounds were also bandied about in the 1970s series while the current production correctly mentions sums like 50 pounds as a very substantial investment -- and it was -- for 18th Century Cornwall.)  ---  Former Poldark lead character Robin Ellis turns up in a cameo role as a harsh, aging magistrate in the third episode.  Winston Graham would probably have approved of this 2015 dramatization.  Demelza is depicted as a hard working, occasionally awkward and resourceful young woman with less of the clever, sexually engaged character of the 70s series.  Ross Poldark is less of a swashbuckler and more of a honest, hands-on worker.  Both the older series and the newer are excellent and worth viewing.  ---  http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/562702/Poldark-creator-s-Winston-Graham-hated-BBC-s-first-TV-adaption",1436140800,14,1519,5.389830508474576
