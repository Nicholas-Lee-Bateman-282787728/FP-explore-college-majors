4330863,4,B004CYF708,"I think fans of the show will enjoy this. You get to hear about how the actors first heard about the show, the auditions, and some of their own perspectives on the show's story. Unfortunately, with so many important characters, you only get to hear a tiny bit from each actor. It would have been great if this was two or three hours so the actors would have time to get into more detail.",1306022400,10,387,4.243243243243243

4330871,5,B004CYF708,"Great discussion. These people are so great together, no wonder the show was so fantastic.  Still doing conventions together even though the show hasn't been on in years.  Buy the whole set and binge watch it.  Best show ever.  Will be a classic.  So say we all!",1435276800,,262,4.48936170212766

4330878,5,B004CYF708,"Fun and interesting video of some of the cast and creators of BSG, being interviewed on stage about their lives, and why they got a role on the show. It was taped during and towards the end of the 2nd season...",1414886400,,210,4.146341463414634
4330879,5,B004CYF708,I loved being able to watch this entire panel bersus snippets that were on YouTube. Very informative and it was good seeing the cast and RDM and DE discuss the background of the show and the characters as well as how each actor was selected for the parts. There was a lot of humor which was a pleasant surprise.,1412467200,,311,4.288135593220339
4330880,5,B004CYF708,"I'm a fan and I liked hearing the background and observations from cast and creators about experience of creating BSG, their thoughts on the characters they play, and the arc of the series. The extended interview added to my enjoyment of the series when I watched it for the 2nd time.

If you are not really a fan this might not be as interesting. But if you *are a fan* of a series and there is a PaleyFest cast and creator interview it can entertain and add insight to make the series more enjoyable and interesting.

As I said, I'm a BSG fan and for me this was a very good interview.",1398643200,,587,4.232142857142857
4330881,4,B004CYF708,I like to hear cast and crews perspectives as well as expiriencs. You get to learn more from them to enhance understanding of the show.,1389916800,,135,4.44
4330882,4,B004CYF708,"it appears to be after the first season wrap. it is fun, if your a fan, they are out of character and you get to see a different side of the actors, producers and writers. the paley center has done many of these shows.",1372377600,,218,3.977272727272727
4330883,5,B004CYF708,"It's exactly as it seems, them on a panel at a convention talking and then answering fan questions.  It's nice to see them act and speak as themselves with no ""acting"" involved.  I never go to conventions, so this was a nice substitute for me.",1367020800,6,243,4.377777777777778
8424111,5,B004CYF708,So much fun. This show was a great re-imagination and took the story further and deeper than most folks expected. To hear the cast and creators talk about this and it's only going into Season 3!! Wow! Too cool!,1484784000,,210,4.410256410256411
8424112,4,B004CYF708,Creators and cast members were all great.  The Master of Ceremonies was a bit on the boring side.,1484092800,,97,4.388888888888889
8424113,4,B004CYF708,"If you want an interview w/the creators of the reboot of BSG, this is the video for you.  They spend very little time with the cast members assembled for the panel.  If you want to spend time w/the cast, this is not the panel for you.  Mary McDonnell shared her feelings when she visited Ground Zero a couple of weeks after the attack.  EJO has some things to say about ""Latinos in space.""",1483142400,,389,4.287671232876712

8424117,3,B004CYF708,Meh. Moderator was passive and lethargic. He permitted the panelists to reminisce (babble).,1471737600,,91,6.076923076923077
