Although, the cost was more than what I would usually pay for a DVD season, the set was actually getting higher as the days went by so I put up with the price.  Though, I think that will be my last expensive item for several years.
All in all, the item was great, the seller was great, and the shipping was good.",1324944000,,407,4.205128205128205
8217934,1,B000AYQNWU,Everything about Cardcaptor Sakura is wonderful as it truly is an enchanting and captivating series that most people will fall in love with - but the last price this second dvd set was at was around 800$ which is like ridiculous!!,1228521600,4,230,4.634146341463414
8217935,5,B000AYQNWU,This is one of the Best Anime I have ever seen.  It is the second half of this series and it ened well.  It left me wanting more.  I enjoyed it very much and advise anyone who is looking for a cute and lovable show to buy this immediately.,1168473600,4,239,3.836734693877551
8217936,5,B000AYQNWU,"andI'm very happy with it!!! the package is great. it really look like the clow book. I just wish they'd put an insert in it but oh well it is great anyway. for this set I hope they respect the original color of the sakura book and one last note, please Amazon lower the price of this set. when it was first launched in pre release the price was 74.99 just like the first set but now??? I never knew a case before in wich the price goes up before the actual release!!! well unfortunately I won't be able to buy it form Amazon if they don't lower the price at least 10 bucks. well anyway thanks for a great great great overseas service Amazon!!!",1128643200,3,644,4.16
8217937,5,B000AYQNWU,"This set will take you through the conclusion of the ""Clow Card"" story arc, and the entire 'Sakura Cards' season, collectively the second and third seasons of Cardcaptor Sakura.  Easily one of the better anime series that was released Stateside.

It bears being repeated, as the last reviewer has stated.  This set is in Japanese language ONLY (w/ English subtitles).  This can't be stressed enough, so if you're a fan of the North American English adaption or other 'international' versions, or dislike reading subtitles to get the whole story, steer clear.

That said, this is where things get downright interesting, especially with the third season.  Some new characters are introduced in this season, who start to give Sakura and her friends some trouble.  Not to forget, Sakura's own personal struggles with her feelings for another major character.

I won't spoil anything.  Just pick this set up (along with the Clow Book set).  It's worth it.

Don't forget the two movies.  Those are also worth looking into.  They tie up some loose ends left by the TV series.",1125014400,6,1068,4.966101694915254
8217938,5,B000AYQNWU,"Well, I'll be darned. Geneon has decided to release the entire Cardcaptor Series in two box sets, inside of a MONTH of one another. Looks like this otaku picked a bad time to quit his job for school...^_^

Anyway, this is definitely worth the cash. This set contains volumes 10-18 of Cardcaptor Sakura, one of the premiere magical girl anime shows of the last decade. The second half focuses in more on Sakura and her struggling romance, as well as her fight to prove herself truly worthy to be master of the cards. If you can afford it, pick up this, The Sakura Book, but be sure to get the Clow Book, too, otherwise you may be a tad lost.

**WARNING: These sets are entirely in Japanese with English subtitles. I read a whiny review once because somebody thought it was English dubbed (didn't read the product info), so be forewarned if you don't like to read your television. ^_^",1124928000,4,882,4.50625
