8058603,4,B0009A2FAO,"This set in the series guest stars two actors that would later become famous on other 60's sci-fi shows: June Lockhart (""Lost in Space"") and George Takai (""Star Trek"").  Lockhart stars in ""The Ghost of Moby Dick"" as the wife of a scientist (Edward Binns) obsessed with capturing a large whale that had killed their son during a research expedition.  She gets to show more emotion and depth than she ever got to show on Allen's later show in her role of ""Maureen Robinson.""

Takai is a treacherous foreign agent in ""The Silent Saboteurs,"" one of the episodes from the first and second seasons that had themes of espionage and foreign intrigue, reflective of The Cold War atmosphere of the times.

The first, a black and white episode, features impressive effects of the giant whale striking the research vessel, as well as its attacks on The Seaview.  ""Saboteurs"" (from the show's second and first all-color season) has interesting effects featuring The Flying Sub.",1135468800,,964,4.889570552147239
8058604,4,B0009A2FAO,"""Eleven Days to Zero"" is the pilot episode for the long-running Irwin Allen series.  It was filmed in color, unlike the installments from the first season of the show.  Utilizing scenes from the theatrical film and reworking some of the same situations, the episode introduced Admiral Harriman Nelson (Richard Basehart), his second-in-command Captain Lee Crane (David Hedison) and the crew of the futuristic submarine Seaview.  Eddie Albert guest-starred in this episode, a few years before he himself would have series success with ""Green Acres"".

It is the second installment, also from the first season, that has the most significance, for it features Robert Duvall in a chilling performance as ""Zar,"" a recently discovered alien that has ulterior motives to revive his people and bring an end to humanity.  Though the costume is rather cheesy, Duvall exceeds in his delivery that ranges from innocence to outright malevolence.  He is truly outstanding.

Fans of the actor will relish this showcase of one of the great film actors of all time.",1135468800,,1046,5.190476190476191
8058605,4,B0009A2FAO,"Though it didn't have the ratings success and devoted following of Irwin Allen's ""Lost in Space,"" ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" began one year earlier and ran for four seasons (110 episodes) in contrast to ""Space's"" three (83 installments).  Because of the greater popularity of LiS, ""Voyage"" spent much of its last two years dealing with stories, though a bit more serious, that brought the crew of the Seaview encountering creatures and situations that could've easily been met by the Space Family Robinson.

The two episodes on this tape come from the first and second years of ""Voyage,"" when the show was more dramatic, allowing stars Richard Basehart and David Hedison to show their acting chops.  ""Mutiny"" is a tense episode wherein Basehart's ""Admiral Nelson"" falls victim to psychosis as a result of an encounter with a giant jellyfish that had previously destroyed a submarine that he was visiting.  Basehart gets to show the range of his skills when he goes from self-composure to paranoia as the effects of the exposure takes its toll.  Guest stars Harold J. Stone (as ""Admiral Stark"") and Steve Harris (""Fowler"") add just the right touch as an investigating admiral and seaman, respectively.

Special effects are quite impressive as the giant jellyfish swallows and destroys the submarine Neptune.  The episode was filmed in black and white, as the show did not go to full color until the following season.

""And Five of Us Are Left"" is one the best of the series, spinning a tale of rescue of survivors from a battle that took place in World War II.  Especially distinctive are the performances of Robert Pine and Teru Shimada as enemies forced to become allies as they attempted to survive for twenty-eight years.

With the success of ""Lost in Space"" on DVD and the upcoming release of ""The Time Tunnel,"" it is hoped, by this reviewer, that ""Voyage"" will receive the full DVD treatment, as opposed to the current VHS releases.",1135468800,,1944,4.88145896656535
