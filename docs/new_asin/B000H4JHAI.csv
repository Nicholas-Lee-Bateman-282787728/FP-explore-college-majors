8136285,5,B000H4JHAI,This film needs a Blu-ray 'rendition' already! Best stark 'raving' movie on the subject of (house) music ever!!!,1434672000,,112,5.277777777777778

8136287,4,B000H4JHAI,"Its a movie with an Australian angle, it has Australian style about it which I love.
However many just don't get Australian movies, and that's a shame as it has a charm about it that is found nowhere else in the world, except perhaps New Zealand movies, although they tend to be more raw and to the bone.

Its a movie set on a small scale, a love between two young people trying to make sense of things in their own way, and how the world relates to them as a couple.
It has some lovely dance music sets.
Because its meant to be a deeply personal movie set on a small intimate scale revolving about two young people in love its not a huge big budget slick affair.

I found the treatment of a search for the prefect sound charming.
Its an unpretentious movie.

Its a little gem in a big bad world of movies, enjoy.",1336867200,3,813,4.165605095541402
8136288,2,B000H4JHAI,"When I saw the cover for this movie, even as a romance, when I think of techno music, I think of a good time...a fun spirited movie. And I'm also an Abbie Cornish fan. I was so disappointed after the first 20 minutes, I was about to shut it off. But since I bought it, I fast forwarded through the rest of it, stopping at times to get even more depressed. Despite the music, which I recommend only buying the soundtrack, it is one of the most misrepresented movie covers I have read. What appears to be a fun, love filled movie is exactly the opposite. It should be renamed as 'Our Horrible Lives'. There was absolutely no perfect days in this movie.",1237680000,2,650,4.2926829268292686
8136289,4,B000H4JHAI,"This was a really good movie, but an even better soundtrack.  For anyone out there who loves the Rave scene, or even just electronic music, this is a movie for you.  There are some downers in the movie, but the movie is about the struggle to find one's self and push through what life throws at you!",1161129600,5,299,4.228070175438597
