4909526,5,B005ZFJZKQ,"The Land Girls a BBc show is deicated to the women who worked the farms and odd jobs that the men of England did before they went off to war,The show not only is patriotic but has so many stories rolled into one. This is the third season and some of the roles have changed but the women still have domestic and personal problems with each other and different mean and dangerous people. There is comedy in some ways and there is always some fifth columnist lurking in the countryside,
there is sex and singing,bootlegging and other hilarous goings on. You'll like it,

4909527,5,B005ZFJZKQ,"I enjoyed the complete Land Girls series, British women's organized home front participation in World War II. The women are from all walks of life, doing their bit for the war effort, but some use the opportunity to runaway from their past homelife. What happens to them and how they cope is what this series is about.",1344384000,3,318,4.5964912280701755

4909530,5,B005ZFJZKQ,"Land Girls staff changes, few, but the action picks up as do the affairs. The comic element remains led by Farmer Finch (Mark Benton). He's not received an award yet, like returnees Becci Gemmell (Joyce) and Sophie Ward (Lady Ellen). There is hardly a character in series 3 who is not involved in a romantic ripple at some point, but it's wartime and something things end harshly. Over a dozen cast back picking up British wartime 40s where it left off, doing their bit for the war out of...well, almost out of harms way.

An excellent mix plots in the storyline keeps the viewer interest. 5 episodes (originally shown during a single week) connect in a continuous war adventure that would be considered an epic if on a longer and wider land scale. It's a small community of farms but the outside horrors of war begin to reach the furors around Hoxley Manor. Old complaints of changes to period clothing colors seem to fade as the depth of the characters swell like cabbage fields.

NO SUBTITLES again. BBC cares little about hearing & dialect impaired but continues doing well with this war drama series, released 2 months after airing on DVD.
1 HOME TO ROOST---Hoxley gets converted to a hospital after the local is bombed. Dr. Channing (Dominic Mafham) at the head, oops a former Lady Ellen lover. Frank (Paul Ritter-`Vera') to the Story-Tucker feud which newest land girl Iris (Lou Broadbent) gets caught up in. Finch wrecks Mrs. Gulliver's (Carolyn Pickles) victory garden and is blackmailed to replant. Table turns when treasure found. Connie's (Seline Hizli) about to mate the Vicar till bad-past Danny (Joe Armstrong) appears. Joyce's John (Nicholas Shaw) hospitalized at Hoxley with amnesia. Thus a stage of plots is set for the remaining series.

2 THE WAR IN THE FIELDS---It had to happen, a competition between farmer vs Land Girls. Iris seems to get caught in the thick of all things controversial, including plowing and romance. Danny meets the Vicar and 3's a crowd. Esther (Susan Cookson) vomits of a morning, consequential horror.

3 THE ENEMY WITHIN---John's memory buds via pressures. Is the doctor collaborating? Who's to be a father? Abortion? Who will pay for the murder of a lamb?

4 FAREWELL MY LOVELY---Connie's forced back to crime as another at Hoxley finds evidence of same for a recently bedded liaison. John's memory and secret returns badly. A murder, a suspect, a lover's tiff? Fuel, a boy, and a bag of coins are central in a bungled robbery. There's lots of loose ends left to wrap up in the last episode.

5 LAST DAYS OF SUMMER---John's memory begins to return with confused reconciliation with Joyce. Thugs arrive in the area bent on revenge. Iris and Vernon have a confrontation with results promising season 4. More than one pair of lovers reunite as wedding bells chime, also with whispers of new episodes. Guess who gets holding the bag?

No bonus, not even the annoying trailer ads.",1330819200,12,2923,4.845691382765531
4909541,3,B005ZFJZKQ,"After seeing a few episodes of Land Girls on PBS of Season 1 I thought this seemed like a neat story - along the lines of ""Bomb Girls"" and other such stories. Though the cast is good, there is at least one character who is almost an exact replica of a character on ""Call the Midwife""  but I know that often writers do borrow ideas from other stories. The one negative that stands out from this series is that Americans are very stereo-typed... yes, I've heard the phrase ""overpaid, overfed, oversexed and over here"" before - but there hasn't been one American depicted on this series as a NICE person.  Umm, excuse me, first they wanted us there, when we get there they complained we took our time getting there, and then they decided they don't like us being there.  Your welcome.  By now, isn't it time to give up that attitude about American GIs?  Stop making us look like they were as bad as the enemy.  Are Americans not the best allies?  And maybe I'm just feeling this way because my dad was ""over there"" in WWII.  He had a few stories too!",1495929600,5,1047,4.360824742268041

4909549,3,B005ZFJZKQ,"Middle-brow  Brit show is still better than most U.S. productions. However, there is a fair share of  over-acting and little care with consistency from one season to the next.  For instance, in the final season 3, Land Girl Connie 's romance with the local Vicar  Henry is carried over from Season 2.  However with no explanation, a different actor plays Henry in Season 3.  Another interesting note is that in the English countryside where these Land Girls are farming and  ""doing their bit"" for king and country, it is always sunny and beautiful.  The war seems pretty remote. Also, the caterers for the series must have been pretty good because ""Bea"" and ""Connie"", two of the prettiest girls from Season1 and 2, were noticeably chubby by Season 3.  Still, after series binging on crime and drama series, Land Girls was a refreshing change to simpler and cleaner tv watching.",1447113600,,877,4.832214765100671

4909558,4,B005ZFJZKQ,"The British just do drama and characters SO well. Its hard not to get 'involved' in the characters and their lives, and the settings and values of the times are so clear and 'right'. Excellent stuff, just Ike the earlier series.",1384300800,,228,4.585365853658536

4909581,2,B005ZFJZKQ,"What started in Series 1 with engaging characters in an interesting time and setting seems to have totally fallen apart by Series 3. Primarily, the story continuity is terrible. Important characters and their storyline seems to vanish in an instant with little to no effort creating confusion as a viewer. Sometimes I viewed sections over again and turned the closed captioning on to see if I missed something due to my own stupidity or inability to comprehend the clarity of the audio.
The last episode in Series 3 was the coup d'gras -- every character was silly and immature. So much so that the only drama was that it was easy to predict every shallow conflict and shallower reunion. I found myself retitling the program 'Land Morons'.
I'm sorry this program disintigrated. The WLA and wartime England is an endlessly fascinating drama on many levels and Series 3 did not measure up at all.",1380153600,6,894,4.811688311688312

4909584,5,B005ZFJZKQ,"The Land Girls series three continued to please. No great acting or star performances, just a simple story about how things were during World War 2 in Britain.",1370304000,,159,4.714285714285714
4909585,4,B005ZFJZKQ,"Though it's not a very old series, we only recently discovered Land Girls, checked it out of the local library, and viewed the episodes one right after the other.

We've been fans of British television for quite some time (As Time Goes By, Foyle's War, etc.), and find the shows so well acted, and in the case of period drama, very well researched. We also appreciate that the shows aren't generally 'dumbed' down for the American audience.

From what I've read on other sites, quite a few people griped and complained about historical inaccuracies, which I suppose the writers/producers/set designers should have paid more attention to (like on Foyle's War), but all in all, this is still a good series, paying tribute to a part of the war effort that truly was important, and mostly overlooked.

That said, we didn't feel that series 3 was quite as good as the first two. Some major characters seemed to fade into the background (such as Mr. Finch), whereas in the first two series they were interesting and highly entertaining.

Other characters seemed to have been brought in simply to irritate - Mrs. Gulliver comes to mind. Someone who considers herself the conscience of the town, but is really nothing more than a busy body who spreads gossip and then calls herself a 'Christian' woman.

By the way that series 3 ended, they either planned it that way, or knew they were headed for cancellation. All of the loose ends were tied up, though there was obviously more storyline left for Dr. Channing, who we learn some interesting secrets about. It seems those will need to be left to our imagination. Maybe that was the point.

I do recommend the show. It's well done, well acted, and entertaining. Once in a while the accents are a bit difficult to understand, but if you watch enough British television, sooner or later you can pick it up. No different than the states. There are varying degrees of accents. Some easy to decipher, others not so much.

No sub-titles? No problem. These days, most television sets come with closed captioning, so turn that option on and you're set.",1367884800,5,2086,4.745856353591161

4909598,4,B005ZFJZKQ,"The deceptively complex Gordian knot of English village life is subtly unwoven for us by three diverse, independently spirited yet wondrously feminine characters, each with separate conflicts that champion English integrity, steadfastness and humor.  The farm is part of Hoxley Manor, ramrodded by Lady Ellen,cool,  statuesque, noble, no feelings worn on her exquisite sleeves, however, who centers the timeless English value of home, as does Connie, land girl on the farm, who with her large house husband, has recently sold her favours to the lascivious farmer to pay for her son's eye operation.  Amply proportioned Joyce, recently arrived from London's east end, razor sharp wit, matched with a cat o nine tail's tongue, who calls it as she sees it, but carried a dark secret of her own.  Her checkered past is contrasted nicely when the young, handsome Vicar proposes, certifying that Joyce's is both beautiful, inside as well as out.  New with this Series is the ginger-haired land girl, Iris, who's male foil is the older misunderstood mystery man with a secret past.  Through the demands of farm life, the indirect pressures of the war only 20-miles distant and with subtle yet telling sub-plots, these three characters are complex, the plots strongly conflicted, as each young woman finds her particular mettle tested in a karmically-suitable fashion.  If you buy it, observe closely for details of movement, eye shifts, body language.  The English sense for understatement yet with powerful emotional forces driving the simple farm life of three strong yet feminine Land Girls.  I further recommend Series 2 which covers the arrival of Joyce (Becci Gemmell) which adds spice, humor and pace.",1354579200,5,1701,5.224264705882353
