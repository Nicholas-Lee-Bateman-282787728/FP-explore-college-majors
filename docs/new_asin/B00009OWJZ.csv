If you are an oldschool skate punk you know what I'm talking about. This movie captured a peice of skate history. The evil Daggers vs. The  clean cut Ramp Locals! C'mon it dosen't get any better then that! They even have a crazy ditch skating joust scene that makes me laugh everytime I see it.

Sure, the acting is cheesy at times, but that gives the film charm, there is punk rock band named after the villians in this movie called ""Hook and the Daggers"" that eveyone should check out. skateboarding, punk rock, red hot chili peppers, a really terrible love scene, this movie has it ALL!! buy the movie already.

 just when you think the movie has no idea, they give you the red hot chilli peppers! christian hosoi, steve steadham, & eddie rategui play members of the daggers & the bones brigade did the skateing for the ramp locals(look for the obvious wigs in the st skating scenes).if your an os skater, like me, this movie is for YOU. enjoy the movie but remember to keep an eye on your ramp because the daggers might burn it down:-)",1062288000,4,847,4.5359477124183005

1887719,3,B00009OWJZ,"It seems that the story of Romeo and Juliet can be translated into almost any setting. Troma took it strange, WEST SIDE STORY took it to the gang filled streets of New York and this movie moves the setting to sunny California during the heyday of the skateboarders.

A young Josh Brolin stars as Corey Webster, a skateboarder with a dream to skate in the most death defying downhill run in the country called the LA Massacre that takes place in Los Angeles. With a little cash in pocket he heads west where he plans to stay with friends there. New to town when the group hits the seaside beach area set up for skateboarders, he strays into the turf run by The Daggers. This must be a tough group because, well, they're decked out in black leather and just look tough.

Okay in case you didn't recognize the sarcasm there this is a movie with 80s written all over it, everything from the slang to the look. Between the punked out make up and the style of clothing you keep waiting for Kajagoogoo or Flock of Seagulls to pop up somewhere. But seeing as how this is LA during the huge punk scene instead you get an early Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Circle Jerks.

Back to our movie. Corey catches the eye of a hot young girl among the Daggers named Chrissy (Pamela Gidley). A bit of flirting and a meet later sets the romance in motion between these two. Unfortunately Corey isn't aware that Chrissy is the little sister of Tommy (Robert Russler), the leader of the Daggers and a skateboarding champ in the area. Once he discovers what is going on he sets out to keep the two apart but we know that isn't likely.

A showdown between the two prior to the LA Massacre leaves Corey with a broken forearm and unable to compete. Complications between him, Chrissy and Tommy leave Chrissy on a bus heading home and a tale of inspiration that leads Corey to the LA Massacre where he intends to compete, broken arm or not. Taped up and ready to go the race is on with the winner able to decide the fate of all three.

Understand up front that this is not Masterpiece Theater. Instead we have a genre thats been around as far back as I can remember, the exploitation film. Dont think that exploitation films are all about gangsters and horror flicks. The teen drama was a staple for years before this movie arrived. It now joins that genre as well offering a lot of fun, a travel through time into the 80s world that will leave many a parent now trying to deny to their own teens that they ever dressed or looked like this.

The movie is well made, well shot, filled with some terrific stunts and solid acting by all around. Watching this you might not have a clue that Brolin would one day star in an Oscar winning film or become a solid star as an adult but it happened. It would make a great double bill with THE GOONIES though since he was about the same age in both.

The quality of the reproduction here is solid and looks great. Once again, its nice to see a company like Olive Films taking care with a movie that isn't heralded as the greatest movie ever made and offering it the respect that all movies deserve. Its entertaining, its fun and its well worth taking a look at. And if you grew up in the 80s, youll want to add this to your collection to watch when the kids aren't home.",1438300800,,3282,4.318181818181818

It features Tony Alva, Christian Hosoi, Stev(i)e Caballero, Rodney Mullen (best freestyle skater EVER, I.M.O.),Tony Magnussen, & even Tony Hawk!  This film from 1986 is a pinacle of the skateboarding era, stemming from one of the most notorious skate spots in the U.S., some say from where skateboarding originated, in Venice Beach, CA, A.K.A. ""Dog Town"".  There are scenes in the film showing all varieties of skateboarding, including ramp (vert), street & even downhill.  The love story that comes along with all the shredding is sort of cheesy, but is still worth the watch for all of the action.  If you haven't seen this movie, it's a must!

1887741,2,B00009OWJZ,"I've seen this movie a few times, and have to agree with the reviewer that said the film has not aged well. It's West Side Story with skateboards starring Josh Brolin as Corey Webster, an arrogant pro-skateboarder wannabe from one of LA's valleys who meets and falls in love with Chrissie (Pamela Gidley), the girl-next door from Indiana and sister of Tommy Hook (Robert Rusler), leader of the punk-skate gang the Daggers; while on his way to training for the LA Massacre, a downhill skateboarding race featured at the film's climax.
There are great skate sequences, skateboarding legends in minor roles (i.e.,Tony Alva as Dagger gang member TA), and a dynamic cameo performance by the Red Hot Chili Peppers (back when you could still see them without the use of video monitors and telescopes), and the scenery-chewing Daggers. Whose on-screen presence never failed to grab my attention. In fact, the film would have been a better film if it had focused solely on the Daggers without the snooze-fest love story.
I gave the film two stars despite the fact that it was fun because I couldn't identify with Josh Brolin's off-putting portrayal of his character. And if you can't feel sympathy for the lead characters, then the film is doomed.",1324684800,,1238,4.9
1887742,5,B00009OWJZ,this is a must for any die hard skaters. This movie came out when I was a kid who love skateboading and after all these years finally found it on amazon.,1315180800,,153,3.967741935483871
1887743,5,B00009OWJZ,"I loved this movie as a kid and it held up much better than I thought over the years. It was my favorite skateboard movie ever. Since it doesn't come on blu-ray, this DVD is as good as it gets.",1287360000,,193,3.85
1887744,1,B00009OWJZ,"This movie was not about skateboarding.  This movie was about a director's impression of what he thought skateboarding was about.  This movie was lame.  It was lame in '86 and it's not aged well... The first time I saw the film all the way through was 2006 and I was embarrassed by how ridiculous the entire production actually was; the only part of this DVD worth watching is the interviews with Jesse Parker, Brad Edwards (both ride for Gravity Skateboards) and Steve from Alva Skates.

Hollywood has never understood the culture surrounding skateboarding.  I couldn't even sit through Lords of Dogtown.  If you want to understand 80s skateboarding from a skater's perspective, pick up one of the following on DVD:

Dogtown & Z-Boys
H-Street: Shackle Me Not and Hokus Pokus.
Santa Cruz: Wheels on Fire; Streets of Fire
Powell-Peralta's Bones Brigade videos: Public Domain and Ban This are stand-outs.  The Search for Animal Chin was more believable as a movie about skaters than Thrashin'.",1268352000,3,991,5.0

And too bad that nobody in the movie had careers after it was filmed. It's pretty cool to see the skating footage, most of which was mimicked from Powell videos, 'Bones Brigade' and 'Future Primitive'. Yes, the same skaters for Powell and others were the stunt doubles for this movie. As a line from the movie, 'The Search for Animal Chin', 'Just like the boys from Thrashin'. Exactly! Get this movie!

1887751,5,B00009OWJZ,"This is one of those ""so awful it's unintentionally amazing"" kinds of movies.  It's everything that was cheesy about the 80's, only on wheels.  I mean, this movie has so much cheese food goodness, it practically explodes from the can.  You couldn't find more succulent cinematic trash (I mean ""thrash"") if you tried!

Need more proof?  How 'bout this: the movie's theme song is performed by none other than Meat Loaf.  That's right: you get meat and cheez - two essential sk8r food groups - right from the get go!  What more do you need?!  (Is it some great old skool skating you desire?  Well it's got that too, with some of the greatest skaters of that time.)

And sure, Hook and the Daggers' (the ""punk"" villains) opening skate sequence is about as menacing as Pat Benatar's girlie group dance in the ""Love Is a Battlefield"" video, but c'mon - this here's a classic!  Plus you haven't really lived until you've seen Hook's air guitar prowess.  (Also, now-jailed ex-skater Gator plays one of the Daggers, so I really wouldn't mess with them...)

Yup.  This movie is one that formed me.  In fact, to this very day I often find myself thinking, ""What would Radster do in a situation like this?"" (trivia fact: Josh Richman, the actor who played Radley, now manages the band Deadsy, of Family Values Tour fame and acclaim).

And speaking of bands... I've always wondered how the Red Hot Chili Peppers (who appear at a party with their original lineup playing ""Black Eyed Blonde"") felt to be included amidst all the synthesized bleeps and blorps of the new wave Thomas Dolby-esque soundtrack?  I mean, seriously - it's about the most anti-skate soundtrack you could possibly put together!

The song playing during the inevitable love scene is just hilariously awful - like a poor man's ""Almost Paradise"" (if you can even imagine a lesser version of that song).  (All right, I'll admit that the Circle Jerks playing ""Wild in the Streets"" almost makes up for it) (almost) (but I was still glad to hear in the commentary that even this movie's director hates that song)

Suffice it to say: without this flick, I would have never known how to get ready for a joust (you paint your eyes like some sort of radioactive pirate raccoon, of course)!  It seems so obvious once this movie shows you the way, but without it?  Well, I wouldn't have a clue.  (note: a joust is a skateduel where two people try to hit each other with combination maces/man-purses, later recreated as an homage by the Jackass crew.)

And I won't give away what happens at the spectacularly surprising and climactic climax at Tuna Canyon (""the steepest and gnarliest course on the circuit,"" dooood), but suffice it to say: it's bitchin'.  I'm not kidding.

This DVD also features an awesome commentary track where they call Johnny Depp and rag on Tony Hawk (who appeared in this movie at age 15 but later dissed it in his book), among other things.  There are so many great lines from the commentary track alone to make this worth your while, but I'll leave you with Robert Rusler (Hook) talking about Hawk: ""If I knew that man was going to be a tri-zillionaire, I would've been nicer to him on the set.""

It really reflects the mid-80's skate scene by including pool, ramp, streetstyle, freestyle, and downhill.  The actors are weak but the actual skating stunt doubles were the best of their time - Tony Hawk, Tony Alva, Per Welinder, Mike McGill, Steve Caballero, Christian Hosoi, Lester Kasai, Billy Ruff, Steve Steadham, Tony Magnussen, & Lance Mountain.

The screenplay and direction do accurately convey many of the details of genuine skating culure at the time of filming (having a number of active pros heavily involved definitely helped); it's evident that the director was genuinely attracted to the skateboarding scene and wasn't just using it as a gimmick.  The story's weak and the acting even more so, but you've seen worse without the cool scenery, excellent soundtrack, and awesome skate action.

Repeated viewings only improve the viewing experience; I highly recommend gathering a group of friends to watch it as it's a great movie for hanging with friends.",1125878400,,1019,4.8
