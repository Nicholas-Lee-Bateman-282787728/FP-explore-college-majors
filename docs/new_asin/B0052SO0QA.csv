8454335,5,B0052SO0QA,"First of all let's not forget that this was the last movie Margaret Sullivan made. Film historians will recall she was an incredible actress and singer. Most of her work was on stage. In this project she partnered with Buddy Adler (producer) and Wendell Corey. This is a must see for serious film goers, film students and others.
It has a beautiful message, a nice score and superb acting. I am happy that the film is still available thru Amazon..
This is a one of a kind movie. Wish there were more like it today. There has never been another like it.

8454337,5,B0052SO0QA,"A wonderful little film.  Understated and unpretentious, and so believable.  Two people deeply in love - the husband and wife, that is, and the wife gives her husband and daughter the greatest gift she could possibly give them - the will and the courage to carry on after she is gone.  Makes effective use of Brahms' First Symphony, the triumphant theme in the fourth movement being a kind of leitmotiv in the movie.  Maggie Sullavan is simply marvellous in her last film.

8454340,5,B0052SO0QA,"This film is about a great a ""woman's picture"" as they get. Absolutely stellar performances by Margaret Sullivan and Wendell Corey. I don't want to give away the plot because I want people to just see this movie and enjoy it as much as I did an extra plus: Natalie Wood in her ""awkward stage"" playing a 10 year old YES! This rather not terribly pretty adolescent blossomed into one of the most beautiful ladies of her time. I will most definitely watch this film with my daughters when the are that age to show them that the loveliest of women had a time in their lives when they weren't. :)",1405209600,2,591,4.333333333333333
8454341,4,B0052SO0QA,"No actress during the golden age of Hollywood handled death with more soulful dignity than Margaret Sullavan, an actress unjustly forgotten even though she gave peerless performances in MGM classics like Frank Borzage's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Comrades/dp/B002EAYEEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Comrades</a>&nbsp;and Ernst Lubitsch's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shop-Around-The-Corner/dp/B004GAKENI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shop Around The Corner</a>. This modestly budgeted 1950 sudser was her last film, a decade before her own untimely death from a drug overdose. This was one of only sixteen screen performances Sullavan gave since she preferred acting on stage rather than on celluloid, a shame since she was utterly sublime no matter what the vehicle. In this appropriate swan song, Sullavan plays Mary Scott, a suburban wife and mother who learns too late that she is dying of cancer. Director Rudolph Mat holds the camera on the veteran actress for long takes as she reacts to this news.

Well before Lifetime TV-movies made such morbidly involving topics commonplace, Mat lets Mary's mercurial moods dictate the tone of the film and allows her to find a way to die in the most mature way possible. This is where the insightful screenplay by Howard Koch (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca/dp/B001EBWING/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca</a>) rates a cut above similarly minded soap operas. Witness the adult way he has Mary deal with her husband Brad's thinly veiled infidelity and her pragmatic approach in setting up Brad's assistant-turned-mistress, a serious-minded Norwegian draftsperson named Chris, as her successor in the family. While Mary's selflessness is likely to look masochistic by today's me-first standards, Sullavan brings such an affecting combination of pathos and intelligence to her character that she transcends the innate limitations of the material, including a few predictably excessive turns like a high-speed drive on a deserted highway and a seriocomic drunken scene at an all-night diner.

She even has a couple of moments where she gets to recreate famous dramatic cues from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Comrades/dp/B002EAYEEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Comrades</a>&nbsp;such as her irritation at the ticking of an alarm clock and her valiant struggle to get out of bed. Character actor Wendell Corey does a fine job as Brad as does Viveca Lindfors (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Way-We-Were/dp/B00001W9G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Way We Were</a>) as early feminist Chris, although their affair is severely downplayed to appease 1950 censors. At just eleven years old, Natalie Wood was still five years away from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rebel-Without-a-Cause/dp/B0007US7EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rebel Without a Cause</a>, but she manages to play Mary and Brad's precocious daughter Polly with aplomb. The film has a low-budget look about it, but it doesn't take away from Sullavan's artistry on full display here. To the strains of Brahms' ""Symphony No. 1 in C Minor"", the last scene packs the necessary emotional wallop even though you know the film's outcome from nearly the beginning. There is a newly remastered print on the 2011 DVD release.",1321833600,13,3520,6.683406113537118
