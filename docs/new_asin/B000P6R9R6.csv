8189453,5,B000P6R9R6,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday. We both enjoy jazz and collect a lot of DVD's. This one we keep on watching time after time. In fact, he shows it to people when they come over. If you are looking for a nice variety of today's musicians, this is a DVD set for you. It has 13 episodes that are themed either by instrument or style. One episode is entitled ""Latin Jazz"" and the special guest artist talk about Latin Jazz History and play Latin Jazz music. Another episode is entitled ""The Golden Horns"" this one is about trumpet players and they talk about the history of trumpet players and have 3 special guest artists that are various ages and play very differently from each other.

It is a wonderful series because you hear a little bit of history, see a short interview with eacher performer, and then hear each performer play, sometimes they will do a duet or trio at the end of the episode as well as play the theme song. I highly recommend this series, my husband and I learned a lot about the performers and it opened out ears to new musicians that we have now become fans of. I would recommend buying all 3 together instead of the vol 1,2, and 3 separately, it will save you a lot of money.",1231891200,3,1213,4.296943231441048

8189455,5,B000P6R9R6,"Ramsey Lewis has earned an astonishing reputation as presenter, he is a good talker and besides let his guests talk to bring us the best of their craft.

In this compilation there are many highlights but mostly the chapter of the three generations of sax players (Benny Golson, Chris Botter and Markus Strickland) and the Latin Jazz represented by Eddie Palmieri and Dave Valentin was simply overwhelming.

Since its immediate release,  this successful and so long expected musical program dedicated to jazz became a cult favourite program and captured a vast portion of dispersed audience all around U.S. and overseas, who love and appreciate this musical genre.

Of course, you will enjoy and delight the rest of the serie. It's truly fascinating, mesmerizing and enriching because it `s living history told by their own protagonists.

A kind kudos for the producers who had such brilliant and moreover, the boldness to materialize it.",1217635200,3,937,5.1381578947368425

In addition, there are bonus interviews with guests, the producer, and the host, as well as a behind-the-scenes photo gallery.
