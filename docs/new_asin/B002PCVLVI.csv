8563149,5,B002PCVLVI,"This documentary follows Brandon Bond's All or Nothing rescue, which he created in order to be able to help out the dogs that were seized from Michael Vick.  His rescue received two dogs; Seven and Makevelli.  This documentary shows the journey of the two dogs and how they overcame their fear issues.  Sadly, Seven dies when she escapes from her backyard and gets hit by a car.  I cried during this part and it really is hard not to because you can tell everyone loved her.  Even just from watching this, I loved her!  After her death, Brandon travels around the U.S. and talks to other celebrities that care about animals, such as Debbie and Danny Trejo, Michael Berryman, Pixie Acia and Donal Logue.  I did not know who Brandon Bond was before this.  In the documentary he talks about how his life was at one time crazy and how he turned it around.  I have to admit that after watching this, I am now a fan of his.  He is a hero to many people and many dogs!  I have a lot of respect for a person who truly cares about animals and him, his friends, and the celebrities shown are all animal lovers to the extreme.  I highly recommend this and with a box of tissues!",1293408000,2,1167,4.302752293577981
