2653475,4,B000I7KHJ4,"A good little workout to get you started.  I give it 4 stars and it is a steal for the price advertised.  I purchased my dvd locally at Big Lots in a combo package with two 3 lb. weights for $10.  This combination is also a good deal if you can find it.  The weights are very comfortable red foam and they are solidly constructed and easy to grasp and hold on to.  I like the idea of the cross body exercise that simulates chopping wood, pulling the starter on a lawn mower, rowing, etc. and the use of the weights unequally on one side of the body to get a more inefficient workout. He also incorporates traditional and effective squats and floor exercises such as crunches and abdominal side lifts (don't know the name for this).  You will need a yoga mat (or a comfy carpet) and two weights.
Gunnar has a very pleasant, unpretentious and soft-spoken voice and he is an attractive middle-aged man (in a Carl from ""Desperate Housewives"" sort of way).  The women doing the workout are also attractive with great abs.  One woman is doing the easier alternative of some of the exercises.  All in all it is a great start primarily for weight-bearing exercise and it could be incorporated into a longer workout.
The exercises are fairly straight-forward, but it may take several tries to get good form.  The 30 minutes go by quickly. This is a good all-round workout for men, women and teens.  The weights can be adjusted for different intensity or strength levels. What may be lacking is a longer warm up and cooldown stretch.  I have already ordered another of Gunnar's workouts because he is unlike some fitness trainers very calm and easy to follow.",1261353600,7,1649,4.552542372881356

2653479,5,B000I7KHJ4,"I just did this  Core Secrets ""Full Body Challenge"" workout by Gunnar Peterson this morning for the first time. I was VERY impressed!

By way of background, I'm an advanced exerciser and a big part of my fitness regimen involves using various types of fitness dvd/vhs's (I've got over 130 various types of programs from Yoga to Pilates, Strength and Cardio Workouts as well).  One can achieve incredible results working out this way if one is consistent (the MOST important thing) and uses a decent amount of intensity.

This workout by Gunnar Peterson was really outstanding and unique! It's extremely well designed in the way he sequences exercises and the way he incorporates compound movements that work both your core and other body parts and the same time.

He does a great job of clearly explaining each move beforehand rather  than just plunging into it and expecting you to keep up haphazardly. I can see why he's such a popular personal trainer because he has a real gift for clarity and program design.

 I found that even though he takes the time for explanation, the program still moves at a good pace. I kept up a nice light sweat throughout most of the program because while not being a cardio workout, the pace is quick enough to keep your heart pumping, especially if you use enough intensity. I rotated between 3 sets of dumbells in order to make sure I was getting the most out of each exercise.

 What I liked is that by the end of the workout I definitely felt that my body was pushed plenty hard enough but I didn't feel so depleted that I couldn't function after. That for me is the sign of a great workout, one that can be done on a regular basis so that you can really feel like you accomplished a lot while still feeling you can be effective in the rest of your life. If you're so beat up that you can't function beyond the workout, chances are you're not going to be able to do it regularly.

 This workout really gives you the most important thing you can ask for from a strength workout and that is FUNCTIONAL strength. This is strength that will help you in the real world, in your daily activities or even in athletic activities because your body is used in an integrated manner the whole time.

 The workout is a relatively short warm up, then you have the main body of the workout, then the cooldown. It clocks in at about 45 minutes.

I'd gauge it as a solid intermediate workout in terms of level, definitely not for a beginner. There are other Core Secrets workouts designed for beginners (Fun-Damentals and Give Me 20). I'd recommend doing those or some other beginning stability ball workouts (Stability Ball Workout For Dummies w/ Liz Gillies, or Suzanne Deason's GAIM DVD for example) before plunging into something like this.

 The production quality is excellent and the camera work makes it very easy to follow along.",1196294400,49,2860,4.5984251968503935

2653509,4,B000I7KHJ4,"I did this DVD for the first time yesterday and it is excellent! I would definitely recommend it!  There is a very good range of exercises to work your entire body, and Gunnar used multiple exercises to target areas like your shoulders and upper back.  The abs work was also good, and I liked that he incorporated exercises for your lower back, as that often gets overlooked in ab workouts.

Note: You do need a fitness ball as well as a set of hand weights for this DVD.  I would recommend 5-8lb dumbells.

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I felt that the workout could have been a bit more intense. I am a more advanced exerciser, and I felt that there were not enough reps of each exercise.  It would definitely be good for beginner to intermediate exercisers, and for those who are more advanced you could pause the DVD while you complete more reps, as I will do the next time.

Overall this was an excellent workout DVD and I definitely recommend adding it to your collection!",1361145600,4,989,4.4010989010989015

2653516,2,B000I7KHJ4,"I purchased this because I've enjoyed Gunnar Peterson's Core Secret videos in the past. I own about 6 of his workout DVDs. The good thing is that this workout only requires a stability ball and some hand weights. I've only used the video once but I already know that this really wasn't what I had hoped it would be. This is more of a beginner's video than an actual challenge video. I was really expecting more of a concentrated intermediate/advanced workout.

Although I have good leg and ab muscles, I feel like what is lacking from my routine is a good upper body workout such as arms and chest, especially the triceps. My arms weren't even sore from the workout. Not only that but there is a lack of variety in this video. There are two repeated sets of crunches and woodchops on the ball. I don't really feel like there were that many arm moves. On top of that, I think there were more arm exercises in his Give me 20 video.

There were also moments in the video that I felt were time-wasters considering that the video is only about 30 mins long. For instance, in the middle, they take a short water break where they drink Propel water and Gunnar talks about the importance of being hydrated and that he thinks flavored water is a good idea because it does down easier. Then at the end of the workout, the last couple of moves don't require the ball, so they all walk their ball over to the far corner of the room which is time wasted because they could just put their balls off to the side. The cool down stretches at the end also take a long time. I liked the cool down stretches but I feel like I barely got an actual workout and would have like more exercises thrown into the routine in addition to the stretching at the end.

Overall, I would say that I was really disappointed with this video as it wasn't challenging at all. Some of the moves were great, but there could have been more exercises and less pointless filler.",1282953600,4,1935,4.354570637119114
