1984605,5,B0001AW02A,"when i went in to see the movie i was to tally shocked. we mostly know about such poor countries but we have never reconsidered and learned from what we saw... this a very amazing movie to let us know where we are in the time many others are dying due to hunger and disease... we must make also some moves to aid our brothers and sisters all over the world...
people, what will we say to god on the judgment day? we are all responsible for those poors...",1076716800,3,454,4.112359550561798
1984606,2,B0001AW02A,"""Beyond Borders"" was originally to be directed by Oliver Stone, and to star Kevin Costner and Cathrine Zeta Jones.  Keep that in mind before you watch it.  The completed film by Martin Campbell starring Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen retains one of the initial intentions of the film -- namely, love romance.
Angelina Jolie plays Sarah, a lady who accidentally meets her fate in Doctor Callahan (Clive Owen).  To what extent she is led by the fate, you will guess in the first sequence in Africa.  The globe-trotting plot is melodramatic, but thanks to the actors' good acting (and Ms. Jolie's off-screen personality we all know), we clearly know that the film is made with good intention.
But the film is shot against the backdrop of the suffering of many refugees in the world, and it opens with the scene showing that nature of the film quite blatantly.  Romance, is it?  But can we relate to either of them in this situation?
Please don't say the film opens your eyes.  Surely, the locations that show the plights of refugees are convncingly shot.  And Angelina Jolie knows these people in person, as you know.  But when you see something (I won't name it) in the middle of African desert, and see it is used as a device to enhance the romantic side of the story, I start to doubt the authenticity of the film.  I may be wrong here, but if I were the director, I would change that part, definitely.
I sincerely hope that it does not symbolize what happened to the career of Angelina Jolie when ""Beyond Borders"" never even reached #10 of box ofice chart in America.  I know the film is a well-intentioned attempt to show the misery of these people, but if you really want to see the authentic accounts of refugees' lives, see Michael Winterbottom's ""In This World.""  That is more realistic and shocking, too.",1073520000,11,1810,4.621875
1984607,5,B0001AW02A,"Angelina Jolie is truly one of the most amazing actresses today. This movie was her best yet! I would recommend this movie to my mom, my boyfriend, or my best friend.

1984609,3,B0001AW02A,"Let's separate BEYOND BORDERS from all the hoo-ha about Angie's (deservedly) celebrated UN work. Also, it's a relief to see her not being asked to wear spandex and kick ass. So often, when an actor (or any artist) scores with a particular type of role and establishes a personality, we ask them to repeat over and over.
  Anyway, I though Jolie and her co-star, GOSFORD PARK's Clive Owen were both quite good, despite the two dimensionality of their roles. Owen: idealistic, noble, emotionally unavailable. Jolie: naive, well-intentioned, simpering. The movie itself falls into the old trap of portraying serious issues in light of how they affect good looking white liberals. The Ethiopia sequence is particularly galling, as Jolie's rescue of a (digitally animated?) baby is portrayed as a major victory in the war against famine. By the time we get to Chechnya, it's just an action movie. The scenes of Jolie at home never take off-- she apparently met the actor playing her husband (Linus Roache) ten minutes before shooting. BEYOND BORDERS is a perfectly entertaining afternoon at the movies, but a movie that seriously addressed the causes of world hunger is probably one most of us wouldn't watch.",1067817600,7,1204,5.045226130653266
1984610,5,B0001AW02A,"This is a quality film, something that is harder and harder to find these days! ""Beyond Borders"" tells the story of a privileged American, Sarah, who's married to a wealthy Brit. At a benefit dinner one night, Sarah was so moved by an outspoken relief- worker doctor that she decided to travel to his aid camp in Ethiopia. From there, we see the story of several years of her life unfold. She travels between her comfortable life in London and the gritty world of aid camps in Ethiopia, Cambodia, and Chechnya. The visuals in this film were amazing, and the story of life in the aid camps were gritty and certainly not sugarcoated. It was interesting and enlightening to see this world and I'd say the filmmakers did a nice job of educating the audience without being didactic. The entire film was tied together with a love story, which was ordinary, although it provided some action, adventure, and suspense in the film. Angelina Jolie did quite well in this film (aside from her sometimes irritating blank stares and her oversized lips). I wasn't sure I could really take her seriously in such a serious role, but actually she really did quite well and fit the part nicely. Overall, this is a quality film. But be warned... it's not for those who like sugarcoated, feel-good, airheaded pieces of work (in other words, the majority of Americans who will be going to see Texas Chainsaw Massacre instead). I was glad I went and certainly took something out of it. It's one of those few movies that is actually worth seeing in the theatre.",1067126400,21,1537,4.675276752767528
1984611,3,B0001AW02A,"This movie has good intentions, but ends more as disaster tourism. The humanitarian crises end up providing exotic, dangerous backdrops for a love story that never quite takes off.
Sarah and the doctor remain two dimensional, especially the doctor. We never know these two people, except as noble, committed souls. There are few simply human moments between them, where they connect as people; it is all crisis without character development. By the time they got to Chechneya, I had lost most of my suspension of disbelief, and much of my interest.
I also couldn't help but be annoyed by Sarah's wealth. Most of us would like to help but don't have the luxury of cashing in our savings to buy truckloads of food and vaccines, or of winging in and out of dangerous countries.
Then there were Ms Jolie's costumes, made more with an eye to what the camera would love than realism. When she appears in war-torn Chechneya looking fashionable in a priceless sable hat, it is absurd--particularly when she arrives in a remote cabin after a mountain trek with makeup flawlessly in place. This is a movie that wants both glamour and realism.  You can't have both.
The scenes in Ethiopia reminded me of Helen Fielding's pre-Bridget Jones novel ""Cause Celeb,"" which did a much better job of exploring the world of aid workers. It kept them human by making the point that no matter how noble the work they do, many aid workers are also escaping something back home. Not only that, but being in a crisis doesn't make those problems go away. Though the novel's ending is somewhat unbelievable, this is still a good book to read if you are curious about the world of humanitarian aid.
Still, in spite of its flaws, it almost worked. Had the love story been more gripping, no doubt it would have. If you are a fan of either star, you won't be able to resist seeing this in theatres, and you will probably enjoy it. For others, I'd say wait for video.",1067040000,3,1934,4.6384839650145775
1984612,3,B0001AW02A,"I watched ""Beyond Borders"" last night, and while the other people I watched it with were beyond bored, I was infatuated. The film, while being a bit ""preachy,"" (nothing anyone would be overly annoyed with) is visually intoxicating. Sometimes in a surreal way other times in a horrific way, but intoxicating no less. Angelina Jolie shines in her role as Sarah, an American whose life changes drastically throughout the years of her adult life with her experiences with refugee camps she visits. Clive Owens plays Nick, a struggling refugee doctor with the best of inentions, but has become cynical and often bitter towards others, but not without good reason. Together they reach an understanding of one another, and eventually find love. But as much as the studio promotes this as a ""Love Story"" it is NOT that in the least. (I repeat this is NOT a love story.) It is bulked up by some hollywood explosions and such. However in whole this is a film about HEROISM in it's many forms. This film will grab hold of your heart, it will tug, warm, tear, comfort and break it. I think everyone should watch it becuase it gives an honest and unforgiving look at worlds outside our own little box. I give it * * * 1/2 for being a great film, but dragging on a little at times.",1067040000,2,1267,4.56140350877193
1984613,3,B0001AW02A,"Being a huge Angelina Jolie fan, I skipped ""Mystic River"" to check out this new movie. Some of this movie touches you deeply on important life issues and sends tingles up your spine(not scary tingles, but impressive and deep tingles).
Its hard to rate a film like this, because its so touching and meaningful, but it fails to make you interested. The storyline is
boring and a little unbelievable and it lasted 2.5 hours. As much as I tried to enjoy this movie because I love and deeply respect Angelina, it really never hit the mark of excellence. It had its moments and ended well, but never really came together....

1984614,4,B0001AW02A,"Angelina Jolie in this movie reminded me of Barbra Streisand's role in ""The Way We Were."" She's desperately fighting for a cause she believes in and falls in love at the same time. The images in this movie are frightening and really calls attention to the help these poor people need. Roger Ebert said in his review that the reason Angelina Jolie's character is even involved is because of her crush on the handsome doctor. I disagree. He opens her eyes to the problem but the whole reason why she goes to Africa is to help. Not to get a date. Angelina's performance is wonderful. You really believe she is a woman who wants to live her life to help others. Perhaps that is because she actually is that way in real life. She is a woman to truly be admired. However, the one thing I didn't like about this movie is the story leaps forward too much. At one point it goes forward four whole years and you have no idea what happened during that time. It keeps doing this. The scene where a baby is given a grenade is incredible. If only the scenes were tied together and the story played out more smoothly it would have made for the perfect movie.",1066953600,12,1143,4.345794392523365

1984662,3,B0001AW02A,"Romantic adventure, marital crisis, and the tragedy of global hunger are combined with mixed but respectable results in Beyond Borders. It stars Angelina Jolie in a role that reflects her off-screen efforts as a United Nations goodwill ambassador. She plays a naive American socialite, unhappily married and living in London, whose life is revolutionized when a passionate doctor,played by Clive Owen draws her into the cause of humanitarian aid in the world's most dangerous political hot-spots including Ethiopia, Cambodia and Chechnya in the 1980s and '90s. Linus Roache, Teri Polo and Noah Emmerich co-star in this film directed by Martin Campbell.

Sarah Jordan is an American living with her wealthy British husband, Henry Bauford, in London during the early '80s. At a charity benefit, she meets passionate relief worker Nick Callahan, who chastises the rich people for not helping out the needy in war-torn countries. Sarah is quickly compelled to join his humanitarian cause to fight the famine in Ethopia. She then follows him to Cambodia, where they start up a love affair and Nick gets involved in an arms-smuggling operation before they finally end up in Chechnya.

This well-meaning film suffers from an identity crisis. Is it a globe-trotting love story?Or is it an impassioned political expos? But one thing is for sure. It is an old-fashioned romance. The powerful scenes and fine performances can't entirely offset the flaws of the film and the ending is severely lacking. Overall,it is a melodrama with pretensions to humanitarian generosity.",1447977600,,1561,5.290322580645161

1984724,4,B0001AW02A,"`Beyond Borders' starts off rather brilliantly, but it loses focus in the end and turns in a rather uninspired and generic ending that takes away from all that it built up throughout the first three quarters of the film.

The film tells the story of a young socialite named Sarah Jordan who becomes fascinated by a relief worker named Nick Callahan.  Sarah is woman who was unaware of the horrors others face and quickly became determined to help in every way that she could.  This also gives her an escape from her loveless marriage (together for the kid) and soon leads way to a budding romance between Sarah and Nick (as should be expected).  Sarah makes many changes in herself and her life while across the globe, becoming a member of the UN and going out of her way to supply Nick and his partner with supplies when needed.  Soon Nick and Sarah begin to struggle with bounderies for their relationship, since the two are in different places in their lives (Sarah has a son to think about, and Nick is too wrapped up in his work to think about a normal life).

Despite having so much depth on the outset, `Beyond Borders' caves a little (and then a lot) and starts to muddy the waters so-to-speak but introducing plot points designed to get people in seats and make money.  Sadly, these plot points don't really further the cause but take away from the film's initial impact.  Turning what could have been a strong dramatic piece about the tragedies of third-world-countries into a tragic love story with a chaotic and out of place action themed climax was a poor choice.  It was a sudden shift in tone that did not work and it really dampens the film's overall feel.  I understand why they did it, but I was just hoping for more.

I should learn better.

At least the performances were uniformly effective (thank god they traded out Kevin Costner for Clive Owen).  Owen and Jolie are both very good here, especially Jolie.  Yes, she kind of changes gears in the end and goes all Laura Croft on us, but she still pulls it off (the shift in tone is the scripts fault, not hers).  You really believe every emotion these two portray, and I admire that.  The film reflects Jolie's mindset at the time, and I think that's why it felt so honest.  That's also why I was perturbed with the direction the film too in the end.  I would have hoped that Jolie would have pushed to have the focus be on the right subject the entirety of the film, but alas, you can't fault it too much.  It tried, and succeeded in many places; it just regressed when I wanted it to push through.

Still, it's well worth seeing and the first half of the film makes up for the second half's decline.",1313971200,,2672,4.458847736625515

He revealed a child so thin it left the wealthy ignorant people in shock. This inspired the young woman to help a african refugee camp where she once again saw the same man. she then officially dedicated her life to helping people in need. she keeps being reunited with the man and they soon fall in love, but a love that has to go threw many challenges in countries that are corrupt and deadly. i suggest atleast rent it, but i loved this movie so i bought it!",1296950400,2,909,4.481927710843373

It might not have been an award winning film, and of course having Angeline, being so gorgeous wanting to be involved in relief and someone looking like Clive Owen, might have been a bit of a stretch.

1984784,4,B0001AW02A,"`Beyond Borders' starts off brilliantly, and it continues down that turf for quite sometime before veering off the beaten path and heading straight into generic Hollywood fluff.  The prose established in the outset of a young socialite named Sarah Jordan (Jolie) who has her eyes and mind opened by relief worker named Nick Callahan (Owen) caught my attention, and for the most part the film initially played out like a coming of age film about a woman who was unaware of the horrors others face and became determined to help in everyway that she could.  To me Angelina made this character a part of her, since I truly believe that this character is a part of her, and thus made Sarah a very believable person.

Sarah is married to Henry Bauford (Roache) but their marriage has been falling apart for years.  They mostly stay together for the sake of their son Jimmy.  Sarah has since her initial visit to Ethiopia become a member of the UN and, when Nick and his partner Elliott (Emmerich) need supplies sent to them in Cambodia she takes this as an opportunity to escape her philandering husband and venture off to this country to help those in need.  It's while there that she realizes her attraction and or love for Nick and the two of them begin to struggle with the thought of their future since Sarah has a son and needs to be with her family where Nick is so attached to his work that a normal life is something he'll never have.

As much as I was not looking forward to a romantic nor dare I say tragic love story I was alright with the sudden change of pace when these two star crossed lovers began to switch focus from the dying children to each other.  What threw me was the sudden shift into action adventure thriller when Nick's hot head gets him kidnapped and Sarah rushes out to Chechnya to save him.  To me this movie would have been better served if it had kept its focus on its humanitarian side and left the action out for it somewhat robs the movie of its dramatic nature and turns it into a generic Hollywood blockbuster, which in my opinion it shouldn't have been.  `Beyond Borders' has a lot of important things to say, and if it had kept focus on those important matters then the outcome would have been a better film, but instead it feels too compelled to add the romance and add the adventure to make it appealing to every audience that it loses the audience that would normally embrace it.

I will say that the acting on all fronts elevates this film and delivers a bit of realism.  Every tear that Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen shed feel real and genuine.  Nothing feels forced or out of character.  Some have said they feel Angelina was miscast, and I will admit that in the end when she goes from her humanitarian care giver to Lara Croft Tomb Raider I felt she stepped out of character and created a new one, she still was every bit convincing.  I just feel that this movie forgot what it was trying to prove and allowed the pressure to be a box office blockbuster, to draw in a large crowd, cloud their judgment and caused them to sabotage what could have been a dynamic film.  That said I was still very impressed and will most likely enjoy this film again; I'm just disappointed for with such a brilliant and original start I would have liked to see a less generic and more focused ending.",1161648000,3,3324,4.442434210526316

The acting is breathtaking. Clive Owen cries a few times in this movie - an actor who can crie (it is unusual). I completly felt in love with his character Nick - the second he appeared on screen. Also Angelina is amazing.

1984791,4,B0001AW02A,"Understandably, this is the movie that influenced Jolie to take on her humanitarian duties with the UN.  At the heart of this film, is a love story about a doctor who is unapologetically passionate about his work with refugees and a rich socialite inspired by his passion to serve.  Their love spans 10 years in three different locales and grows stronger with each time they meet.

Clive Owen was simply divine in this role as the forcibly aggressive doctor demanding funding from his supporters.  The manner in which Owen portrayed this literally made me shudder.  He is not the type of character you want to cross in a dark alley.  Owen can easily and convincingly play brutal villians by his very looks and strong persona.  The challenge is to play the opposite which balances out quite well in this role.  He was incredibly brooding and sexy all the same, especially at his quieter moments on film.  It's not hard to see why Jolie's character fell for him hard.

Additionally, as explained in the special features, the film shows how the complexities of humanitarian aid workers have evolved over the past twenty years.  In Africa in the early 80s, the main problems rested in the logistics of getting food to the hungry.  In Cambodia, political crises of the country made even humanitarian workers vulnerable targets.  In Chechnya, all bets were off.  An aid worker was no safer than the enemy.

It is an attempt to spotlight an issue that most of us do not think about, but which we should. You leave the movie feeling lucky that you have a home and food, and wonder how you can help those who are less fortunate. Scenery is breathtaking. The humanitarian effort is valiant and endearing. Deeply moving and inspiring. This movie is a very well-crafted, well-directed, and well-acted wake-up call, a valuable education, and good story.

1984817,4,B0001AW02A,"When there have been dozens of movies made about the Holocaust you can get to the point where you can tell the story of a romance set against such horrors as Robert Benigni did in ""La Vita  bella.  But when you are first showing a world of horror like that in the movies you cannot try and tell a romance against such a backdrop.  More to the point, you should not try, and that is the fatal flaw with ""Beyond Borders,"" which will constitute many viewers introductions to the major disasters and wars around the world that international disaster relief works have tried to deal with in the last two decades.

Granted, it is the stars of the film and not the subject matter that will get people to watch the movie.  Originally ""Beyond Borders"" was going to be directed by Oliver Stone and star Kevin Costner and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  What they ended up with is director Martin Campbell (""Vertical Limit""), Clive Owen (""Gosford Park"") and Angelina Jolie (""Tomb Raider"").  When this film was made that would be considered pretty much a drop down across the board (Owen had yet to make ""Arthur""), but the fault is not to be found in either the director or the actors.  Certainly Jolie is at home here, because even those wearing their Team Aniston t-shirts have to admit that as a good will ambassador for the UNHCR the actress has walked the walk.  She was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award from the UN's Correspondents' Association for her work, made an honorary citizen of Cambodia for her humanitarian work there, and the tabloids covered her adoption of a newborn baby girl from Ethiopia who was left orphaned by AIDS.  No, the problem is with the decision in the script by first time scripter Caspian Tredwell-Owen to go with a romance between the two.

The story is told in three major acts, each representing a major disaster in a different time and place.  The first is the Ethiopia famine in 1984, the second is set in the Cambodia of the Khmer Rouge in 1989, and the final is the Chechnya of 1995.  These major sequences, shot on location, are sandwiched between scenes in London of the family life that Sarah Jordan (Jolie) leaves behind when she goes off to help Nick Callahan (Owen) to try and save the sick and dying.  The film starts off with what we take to be the ""present,"" as Sarah plays Schumann's ""Traumerei"" on the piano.  Clearly this is going to be a sad tale.  When then go back to a fund raising party in London in 1984 that Sarah was attending with her husband, Henry Bauford (Linus Roache), and journalist sister, Charlotte Jordan (Teri Polo).  The evening's festitivites are interrupted when Callahan storms in with a young Ethiopian boy demanding to know why his funding has been cut off.

I thought the first third of ""Beyond Borders"" was pretty memorable.  Callahan dresses down the crowd in a profane but pointed manner, and when there is a pathetic rejoinder to his barbs he turns it around to really shame them.  Sarah is profoundly affected by what happens, both there and afterwards, and decides to drop everything in her life and use all of the money she can get her hands on to fund a relief convoy to Callahan's camp in Ethiopia.  There she is given a rude introduction to the horrors of the famine and her efforts are rudely dismissed by Callahan.  But Sarah has spunk, or at least a heart in the right place, and she is able to help, which, after all, is what you would think this would all be about in the end.  But I should have known when in middle of a relief camp in the middle of the Ethiopian desert Sarah finds a piano to play, that this 2003 film was going to go in the wrong direction.

Here is where I think the movie makes a mistake, because when the supplies run out, Sarah goes home.  She and Callahan have established the beginning of a relationship, not just because they have been butting heads but because of a pointed conversation where she demands to know why he never uses her name (and he has a good reason).  The idea is that their two paths will cross at the other times and in the other places and their romance will progress.  It is just that I find the idea of the romance unnecessary at best.  What international disaster relief operatives have to do to not just try and get the job done but to survive is fascinating by itself, as the second act in Cambodia amply proves.  Besides, I am much more interested in the rest of Callahan's group, such as Elliott Hauser (Noah Emmerich), than the sparks between Sarah and Callahan.  By the time we get to the final act in Checnya, the film is reduced to those two and the relief effort is barely in the background.

The other problem with the last act is that it is telegraphed.  When a movie stops so a driver can explain his artifical leg and the climax takes place in Checnya, you have to see the ending coming (especially with the red herring of the opening piano piece).  Overall I give the Ethiopia part a 5, the Cambodia part a 4, and the interludes and the Checnya part a 3.  That averages out to a 4, but ""Beyond Borders"" deserves that simply because although the romance takes over the movie in the end, the human misery depicted is not easy to forget and that is worth something.  Plus, I appreciate the idea that when people are starving to death there is a point where it does not matter than there are people with guns trying to tell you want to do.",1125878400,8,5395,4.464831804281346
1984818,3,B0001AW02A,"Win some, lose some. When Clive Owen replaced Kevin Costner (due to ""artistic differences""), this movie got a truly magnetic leading man. When Martin Campbell replaced Oliver Stone, however, it got a lesser director, although Stone later got to direct his leading lady, Angelina Jolie, in ""Alexander"" (which did not exactly conquer the world). Had another actress replaced Jolie, say the excellent Joan Allen or Julianne Moore, it might have found its footing. As it is, ""Beyond Borders"" is simply beyond belief.

It is not just that Jolie is unconvincing as a socialte who enlists in the fight for world famine relief. She's in way over her head. She doesn't display any of the fortitude that such an effort as world humanitarian aid demands, and which Owen intensely conveys whenever he's on screen. That Jolie ends up a martyr to his cause, leaving a loving husband (the always underrated Linus Roache) and two children in London, is a twist of fate that will make you cringe instead of care. The current ""Constant Gardener"" tended these themes far more effectively.

""Beyond Belief"" is ambitious. There are some interesting situation ethics, character clashes, and stark scenes of corruption, violence and human suffering in Ethopia, Cambodia and Chechnya. You can see why Stone was attracted to the material. But the movie draws our attention away from these imperatives and onto an adultery, given the circumstances, of staggering unimportance. It squanders our good will, making us feel guilty about our impatience for the picture to end.",1120176000,,1545,5.126984126984127

Happy to say that once again critics sometimes (read: often) just don't... get... it.  I recall reading some rubbish about love and war don't mix, which was laughable, perhaps the critic forgot that war as a backdrop produced some of the very best narratives in existence (Papa Hemingway would more than likely share this opinion).  At any rate, Miss Jolie gives a truly wonderful performance, she is quite still in this role, a feat not easily achieved.  Her expressions, body language and eyes (those incredible eyes!) tell the viewer everything they need to know.  I've seen pretty much everything Angie has done and along with ""Gia"" she can be so very proud of this picture.  Clive Owen is (as usual) also guite good, he could have phoned this one in as it is a role tailored to his talents.  Marty Campbell also shines with what I understand was a thready budget.  And, of course, perhaps the real stars of the film are the locations and the brave, amazing people that are the focus of Beyond Borders.  The film opens many a complacent eye - I encourage everyone to see it so that they may make a small (but so significant to those in need) change in somebody's life.  I also congratulate the film on being brave and daring with their female lead; the places they take her both physically and mentally and the impactive ending make this a wonderful cinema and life experience.

Her travels take her from 1984 England to Ethiopia, then to 1989 Cambodia and, finally, to Chechnya in 1995. Most of the time she is following overwrought M.D. Clive Owen, who runs around the globe smoking cigarettes, seeking funding, engaging in revolutionary activities, and trying to save poor people in the Third World.

This is the basis for the romance, which is essentially killed by an incoherent script, plot and poor acting by Owen. Jolie gives one of her better screen portrayals as, first, a young woman, then activist, then conflicted wife and mother and, later, U.N. official more overwhelmed by love and grief than Anna Karenina for Brodsky.

But there is no classic line or theme in this film, which lacks continuity between scenes and places on the globe. In addition, while Jolie's two children age between the 1984, 1989 and 1995 sequences, neither of the leads nor Jolie's husband puts on even a year. Jolie finishes the film just as she started it -- without an age line in her face. Odd indeed for a woman of her experience!

And while this is a romance between the two great looking leads, it takes a full one hour and 26 minutes before the two even embrace and kiss! That's an hour and a half of foreplay to satisfy romantics but emptiness for the rest of us.

The movie ends with a message that it is dedicated to relief workers and victims of war and persecution across the globe. It's hard to believe this was the genuine message of the film, which is really not much more than a romantic adventure.",1119830400,2,1852,4.703703703703703

Angelina stars a a bright but bored married Amercian who lives in London, and Clive Owen plays the man of the world as a doctor. They bring to the big screen the truth of just how cruel the world is to people with little to no education and extreme poverty. In a movie that streches a time span roughly of 10-15 years, it lets you feel just what it would be like to wonder when you would be getting another meal, what it would be like if you were to die from a simple and curable diease and what it would be like to have to do anything for the one you love.

Angelina Jolie particiapted in this movie because of the importance of using theatre to gain public interest in world events.  It is the latent public that watches this movie and does nothing but criticize it.  It is the aware public that takes this movie literally, by trying to make a difference like Jolie is doing working with UNHCR.

I felt the actors had amazing chemistry and felt the emotion of the picture down to the last frame. I really got an understanding of just how bad it can be in these places overseas and the story of a socialite coming full circle,learning the truth about herself, even dying for her convictions made an excellent,emotional,and heart grabbing movie.

I just think if more people would go to the movies to let go and enjoy the movie, instead of looking for everything wrong with it, life would be so much better.

While losing herself (and her marriage) to the plights she sees in various parts of the world, she also falls in love with Owen's character. Unfortunately I think the seriousness of the issues with which these relief workers grapple would make a good enough story without this implausible love story thrown into the mix (reminds me of Titanic that way... the tragedy of the ship sinking would have been a good enough story, but filmmakers, I guess, don't trust that a story is good enough or emotionally gripping enough without ridiculous couples falling in love, so we have individuals to latch onto when the ending turns out unhappy).

I would agree that Angelina Jolie was probably miscast but she did a respectable job and Clive Owen was dead on.  The scenes of mass starvation, corrupt officials, rebel leaders destroying their own people, brutality and political connivance and venality were all stunning and very well  presented--believable and appalling. I am glad there was a romance, however brief or star-crossed, to provide a little relief from the otherwise overwhelming grimness.  Further, I can't imagine any American audience going to see a film of totally unrelieved misery, as one reviewer seemed to be suggesting they would do.  The plot did have some gaps which could have been filled in better for the understanding of what was really going on in the bizantine world of international relief but I think they did the best they could without extending the film beyond reason.

That aside, I was genuinely drawn in to this story.  It's hard for me to get wrapped up in a love story, so when I do, I remember it!  Generally I find Hollywood's version of true love to be, well, Hollywood. Very clean and simple and a bit flat. This film was so full of characters with such altruistic personalities, it was hard not to want them to live happily ever after!

The film makers seemed to leave out a lot of plot either for time or budget purposes.  It would have been nicer to have a more detailed explanation of exactly what the CIA guy was finagling.  The viewer has to figure out a lot for him/herself.  More background on the Angelina Jolie character might have been nice too.  At first all we know about her is that she's recently married, then she goes to Ethiopia.  Next thing we know she's working for the UN?  What exactly was her UN function other than the very shallow scene we see of ""setting up aid""?  Maybe I need a second viewing, but without giving too much away --what exactly had the Doctor done to irk the Chechen warlord? I'm not sure that was explained.

However I feel it took a different direction when the movie seemed to focus more on the attraction and allurement between two of the main characters; Sarah Jordan played by Academy Award winning actress Angelina Jolie, and Nick Callahan played by actor Clive Owen.

1984852,2,B0001AW02A,"No one can accuse ""Beyond Borders"" of not having its heart in the right place.  After all, how many mainstream American movies so much as acknowledge the existence of starving people in the world, let alone make them the centerpiece of their stories?  For its willingness to do that, the film deserves a certain amount of genuine praise.  Unfortunately, having gone this far, the filmmakers then cheapen it all by pasting onto the film a corny, superficial love story more appropriate to a Harlequin Romance than an ostensibly serious social drama.

Angelina Jolie plays a United Nations relief worker who flits from one worldwide trouble spot to another - Africa, Cambodia, Chechnya - dispensing aid and carrying on an adulterous affair with a handsome field doctor (played by Clive Owen) whom she met several years earlier (the film takes place in the 1980`s and `90`s).  It's a little hard to take seriously the extreme plight of these suffering people when Sarah and Nick are making goo-goo eyes at one another in between saving lives and delivering inspirational, we-are-the-world speeches.  As with so many movies of this type, the put-upon, indigenous people become little more than extras in their own story, a mere backdrop for the trite personal drama occupying center stage.  It's as if American audiences couldn't possibly find any interest or relevance in all this misery if we didn't have some well-fed, well-scrubbed white people serving as our guide to get us through it all.  I'm sure that the last thing the people who made this movie intended was to in any way demean the incredible efforts done by relief workers around the world, yet that is exactly what they end up doing by forcing all this heartbreaking human tragedy through the funnel of a hackneyed love story.

The moments of highest interest come when we see the incredible amount of power politics that goes on even when it comes to delivering food and medicine to dying people - although the filmmakers don't always make those complicated logistics entirely clear for the lay audience.  We often can't tell what exactly is happening on a sociopolitical level that's preventing the aid from getting through.  A little less time spent on the romance and a little more on the behind-the-scenes aspects of the story would have gone a long way towards redeeming the film.  Unfortunately, there's something almost comical about the sight of Sarah and Nick, nattily dressed and perfectly coiffed, making passionate love amidst the rubble and ruin of war torn Chechnya.

Jolie and Owen turn in relatively lackluster performances, not entirely their fault given the stock characters they play and the bland dialogue they've been assigned to deliver.  Jolie has one basic expression throughout - that of teary-eyed sympathy and concern - that wears awfully thin after awhile.

The filmmakers are highly critical of all those well-off people who merely pay lip service to helping Third World causes but who are really only concerned with salving their own guilty consciences (the film begins at one of those lavish fundraising dinners with everyone dressed to the nines and enjoying a sumptuous banquet while they're giving one another awards for great humanitarian achievements for helping to eradicate poverty and hunger).  Yet, by treating the material as if it were some sort of bourgeois romantic fantasy, the moviemakers are, in many ways, doing the very same thing they accuse the elite snobs of doing - which is making misery palatable and easily digestible for the complacent, self-satisfied masses.

""Beyond Borders"" is, obviously, a labor of love for all those involved in its making.  That is turns out to be a misfire of almost laughably bad proportions is, perhaps,  the greatest tragedy of all.",1100390400,16,3779,5.056360708534622
1984893,5,B0001AW02A,"First off I am a Linus Roache fan.  There was not enough of him in this movie.

It is however a great movie with a Hollywood love story between Jolie's, and Owen's roles.  Its sparked as Angelina in her way is moved by the death of a black child who froze to death as he slipped through deportation from England.  She goes off to many global locations as a UN person to where aid is being doled out.

Linus Roache plays the stay at home city boy of London.  Its obvious early in the movie Jolie's, and Roache's characters are due for parting of the ways.

It will move you with realistic glimpses of the struggle to feed the global populous.

We need not forget there are people right here in the United States living close, or at the level of starvation, and homelessness.  Many are victims of many sorts here.  As Americans we tend to forget Appalachia, and treatment of American Natives.  This movie will not let you forget the plight of those less forunate.  Even those less fortunate in the struggle for a true equality across the board for all.  The way the world is now are any of us not far from the third world?  The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.  As petrol constantly hovers in the US at/near two dollars a gallon; I still feel the wrong man got back into the White House.

1984894,5,B0001AW02A,"I am not sure how to describe this film.  Beyond Borders is a film unlike any other.  It stirred such deep emotions and feelings in me that I am having difficulty choosing the right words.

Angelina Jolie shines in this film as Sara, a beautiful socialite whose life is changed when a volunteer relief worker doctor named Nick (Clive Owen) crashes a charity ball.  Sara wants to help.  She gets some money together and goes to Ethiopia with medical supplies.  Nick hates her at first, thinking she is a do-gooder rich girl only doing this to assuage a guilty conscience.  Over ten years, they meet in tumultuous backdrops around the world, and realize they love each other.

Beyond Borders was such a massive undertaking.  It was filmed on location in Africa and Southeast Asia.  The sets are absolutely astonishing: a refugee camp in Ethiopia; Grozny, Chechnya, recreated in Montreal.  The music by James Horner, one of Hollywood's greatest composers, is sublime.  The acting is amazing.

When I first started watching it, I thought ""Great, a guilt trip with prosthetic starving people.  Great!""  I was wrong.  As I continued watching, it was like my mindset actually melted, changed into something else.  As someone else mentioned in a user review here, this movie has changed my life. Once Sara returned to England from her first relief trip overseas, she could not go back to the way things were.  It is the same for me.  I can not look lightly at the things I have; the money I have; the family, life, and security I have.

1984896,2,B0001AW02A,"BEYOND BORDERS is an example of a film made to satisfy someone's agenda of political correctness, and the entertainment factor is a thin veneer slopped-on to sell tickets.

The film opens in London at a gala charity benefit to honor the founder of an international aid organization. During all the back slapping and ego massaging, the event is crashed by Dr. Nick Callahan (Clive Owen), the physician-director of a camp for starving refugees in Ethiopia, with a young survivor in tow. Nick angrily berates the guest of honor for not providing more funds to keep his camp going, and the attendees, enjoying their caviar and champers, for hypocrisy in general. After being hustled from the hall by security goons and sent back to Africa, socialite Sarah Jordan (Angelina Jolie), experiences a crisis of conscience, arranges for a shipment of food for Nick's cause, and personally accompanies the goodies to the desert. After an initial period of tension between Jordan and Callahan, the two naturally - because this is a Hollywood script - fall in love before Sarah must return to England and a failing marriage. Five years later, now a member of a UN commission for refugees, Sarah contrives another visit to one of Nick's lost causes, this time in Cambodia. And yet again another half-decade later, Jordan travels to war-torn Chechnya, where Nick has been kidnapped by one side or the other. And you can bet your last sack of donated rice that Sarah is fashionably attired for each expedition!

About mid point in BEYOND BORDERS in Cambodia, one of the minor characters, who had lost a leg to a land mine, explains to Sarah how the arming click one hears when stepping on the booby trap is the first indication that life is carefree no longer. That scenario, of course, will surface again before the film's conclusion. That click was the only one. Neither the Jordan or Callahan characters, either alone or paired, clicked for me. The romance between the two seemed an artificial construct by scriptwriters desperate to engage the audience in their underlying three-part message concerning the plight of refugees worldwide, a desperation culminating in one of the more contrived endings to any film that I've seen recently.

Of the two main roles, Callahan's was perhaps the most obnoxious. Here we have a high-powered aid worker, presumably needing advanced schmoozing skills to coax money out of donors, not to mention the cool head to negotiate the treacherous shoals of dictatorships and warring factions, comporting himself like a loutish soccer hooligan. (I've seen it mentioned that Clive Owen may be considered as the next Bond. Say it ain't so, Commander!)

1984900,4,B0001AW02A,"The worst thing about the film is the casting.  Angelina Jolie is very pretty and I've enjoyed her performances in several films.  But she's way over her head here, cast as a socialite U.N. worker who thrusts herself into danger, not only for her empathy with the suffering that goes on.  She's also attracted to a fearless outspoken doctor, played by Clive Owen, who dedicates his life to helping people and advocates their causes loudly and bluntly.  For example, in 1984 he crashes an upscale London charity event and brings a starving Ethiopian child with him.  That's how he and our heroine meet, of course.  And as she is married, this adds to the complexity of their romance.

We then see the couple in Ethiopia, where Jolie is a novice in the ways of the world.  It's all very sad but she does manage to rescue a child.  This part of the film was shot in Namibia and I was a little shocked at the casting because they obviously used people who are really and truly starving.  Ms. Jolie's lips, however, remain perfect throughout and they are so unnaturally large that I couldn't help wondering if she has them cosmetically enhanced.  This kind of thinking distracted me from the very seriousness of the situation.  She and the good doctor respect each other but don't really get together in a romantic way at this time.

Years later, in 1989, they meet again in Cambodia.  This section of the film was shot in Thailand and is action packed.  There are guns and double dealing and very bad people and one of their friends is murdered.  Here's where their romance really begins but, alas, they are separated again.

Fast forward to Chechnya in 1995 where the good doctor is captured by bad guys and the beautiful woman tries to rescue him.  This part was shot in Montreal in the dead of winter.  It's a very scary segment and the ending is not a happy one.

It's a good story held together by the couple but it just was a little too artificial for me.  Also, it tried to say too much in too short a time.  I would have rather they focused in just one place.  It did hold my interest throughout, however, and the pace kept me interested.

Clive Owen does, as per usual, does a spectacular job.  And Angelina Jolie, as per usual, gives a more than adequate performance.  The relationship between their characters, however, lacked heat I was expecting.  From the perspective of the audience, their relationship also seemed to lack a bit of history.  They went from barely knowing each other to being secretly in love.  Perhaps some scenes were left on the cutting room floor or perhaps it was supposed to be ""understood.""  Either way, it didn't work.
The social commentary does get fairly heavy at times.  However, with the love story struggling to maintain the interest of the audience, I can understand how some critics would feel that the movie trivializes the struggles of international relief workers.

There was too much going on, and it looked like the filmmakers were trying to make two films in one.  If the movie was attempting to be another English Patient, but with late twentieth to twenty-first century issues, it failed.
The most memorable aspect of the film was the attempt at presenting issues that have occurred or are occurring within the eastern borders both in the pacific and the baltic or in between.

She journeyed to those countries over a decade and eventually fell in love with the doctor (Clive Owen). The movie tried very hard to be a politically motivated film and I respect that.

Having said that, ""Beyond Borders"" is a good film, not spectacular or overwhelmingly poignant, just good!  Given Angelina Jolie's personal passion towards helping children from third world nations it's easy to see why she chose to do this film.  That personal passion does translate to the film however, the script in and of itself just doesn't translate into an overly impressive film.
Performance wise, Angelina Jolie delivers another solid performance but she comes off as somewhat subdued for the better part of the film.  She is such strong and versatile actress that her part in this film, despite a couple of strong points, just doesn't suit her talents.  Clive Owen delivers a strong and memorable performance as does the majority of the cast.
I believe the only other film I've watched that was directed by Martin Campbell was ""The Mask of Zorro"" which was a pretty good film.  His direction of ""Beyond Borders"" clearly shows that he can make the best of the film despite a weak script.
The Premise:
Sarah Jordan (Angelina Jolie) is an American married to a Brit.  At a fundraising gala, Nick Callahan (Clive Owen) crashes in dragging behind him a young Ethiopian and turns Sarah's world upside down as he delivers a strong speech about the suffering the Ethiopians are going through and haranguing her father-in-law about pulling his funding.  Sarah soon finds herself taking every last penny she has and buying relief supplies to personally take to Ethiopia...
What follows from there is a mildly poignant film in which Sarah and Nick carry on an odd relationship as she is unhappily married and he continues to follow his passion of relief work all over the globe...
Without trying to sound too harsh, I would rate this film at 3.5 stars if it were possible as it is a good story it just doesn't live up to its billing or its leading actress.  I would definitely recommend it but more as a rental than an actual purchase.  {ssintrepid}

1984926,3,B0001AW02A,"Think Tomb Raider meets English Patient meets Proof of Life meets U.S.A for Africa.
1-Tomb Raider because:- Angelina starring(obviously), her hairstyle and pouting, some of the action sequences, Asian location, brooding English/Scottish/ Welsh co-star with similar character to Nic's, with the love scene even located in Asia
2-Proof of Life because:- some of the subject matter in terms of civil and political unrest, the rescue scene, brooding emotionally unavailable male lead character.
3- English Patient because:- English characters, sweeping romanticized desert scenes, posturing in flowing clean white garb (though Sarah's in the middle of a dusty refugee camp), landmines, brooding emotionally unavailable male lead character
4- USA for Africa because:- obvious.
But having said all this, this wasn't a bad movie- I'd thought it would be worse. It started powerfully but by the end deteriorated into a ""movie"" in terms of storyline, dialogue, action sequences. However, the second to last scene is an unexpected gem- it made the movie for me.
Clive Owen is the best thing about the movie- a powerful gritty performance. (No offence- I think Kevin Costner is an excellent actor and one of my favorites, but he would have made the role a different animal.)
If you'd never seen an Anglelina Jolie perfomance, she would have moved you, but essentially (and like a lot of other actors) she pulls out her usual range of emotionions and pouts and falls slightly flat and two dimensional. A grittier actress would have been better in the role. If this movie had starred Catherine Zeta Jones as planned, or a Nicole Kidman, or a Julia Roberts, with Kevin Costner or a Russell Crowe lead, Oscar would have been falling over it's feet to worship. But the lack of A-list leads (by Hollywood's standards)and the uncomfortable guilt- inducing subject matter for most Americans was enough to keep audience's away.
To conclude...You'll enjoy this movie more if you watch the special features and watch the movie as it was intended according to the author -""an epic romance set against the backdrop of humanitarian work"", not as a documentary on relief work or the UNHCR. (I must say, though, I was very disappointed and surprised at the director's repeated use of the word ""Africa"" when referring to Ethiopia, given that ""Cambodia"" was referred to as Cambodia, not Asia, and ""Cheznya"" was referred to as Cheznya, not ""Europe"" and the Art director's comment""...Namibia on the Ivory Coast"" What does that mean?!)",1081728000,3,2503,5.152334152334152
1984927,3,B0001AW02A,"From it's troubled pre-production to it's schizophrenic storytelling, Beyond Borders has loads of promise but ultimately fails to deliver.  Angelina Jolie plays an American woman living an unhappy marriage in London when she is drawn into humanitarian aid in various political hot spots by a very passionate doctor (Clive Owen, replacing original star Kevin Costner).  The two end up having an affair (naturally) while helping out those in need, but the film's schizophrenic storytelling and lack of focus on one subject is where the film loses steam.  The performances by Jolie and Owen are excellent and make the film worth watching, but the overly long running time and disappointing direction by Martin Campbell (Goldeneye, Mask of Zorro) ultimately drag the film along.  Had Oliver Stone directed as he was originally set to, Beyond Borders could have been something special.  It's still worth watching, just don't go in to it with high expectations.",1081555200,2,955,5.256578947368421
1984928,4,B0001AW02A,"Before I say my praises, I will advise for anyone who enjoys not having their movie spoiled,  not to read a review by BANANAGURL, who totally spoils it by giving away the ending!
Anyways, I found this to be more of a heart moving, touching movie, than a  love story with a war/refugee backdrop. It made me realise and appreciate all that I have in my life. The warmth, safety, food and cleanliess, that 50 million people, such as those portrayed in the movie lack.
This wasn't a boring, draggin-on movie, but a moving drama, that really shows the raw and deep pain of human suffering that goes on, out of peoples minds and awarenss. Hunger and pain, spreads through those people like a great colossos of doom. Great perforamnce from Angelina, and Cliwe. I'm very glad I got a chance to experience this visually  moving project.",1081036800,19,827,4.612244897959184
1984929,3,B0001AW02A,"This film was kind of disappointing.  Of course, I shouldn't have expected much from a wannabe Hollywood blockbuster.  Instead of exploring the nuances of international conflict and international organizations, the film portrays Jolie as a UNHCR poster-child in a wishy-washy love story.  As if the UNHCR or UN in general for that matter is all that great.  Furthermore, this film was not clearly researched.  Jolie dies at the end because she steps on a land mine.  Not realistic at all.  Land-mines are anti-personnel.  They generally don't kill but are tactical and/or strategic tools meant to demoralize and occupy the enemy with wounded personnel.  I'm probably being over-critical because this film presents itself with serious subject matter and purports to be a serious film.  But a documentary could have done a much better job getting the point across.  Finally I figure the theme was supposed to be ""beyond borders.""  This was the title of the film afterall.  Maybe the directors should have capitalized on that theme with something more concrete than trite flitting around to places like Ethiopia, Cambodia and Chechnya.  Oh, and one last point.  I'm not sure how I feel about viewing the emaciated Ethiopian mother and child in the film.  Did they get compensated?  Did someone take care of them?  Were they exploited?  Too many questions of morality in a film that's out to make money.",1080345600,3,1399,5.057017543859649
1984930,4,B0001AW02A,"BEYOND BORDERS doesn't seem to know where it is going as a movie: an  international love affair, a poster film for the courage of the human soul, a documentary, a promotional film for Angelina Jolie's laudable contributions to global charity, a study of the mismanagement of fundraising and fund disbursement for the victims of famine, starvation and war around the globe, etc etc. If you can get past the need to hone in on a single concept then there is plenty to like about this movie.  For once Jolie is able to play a woman obsessed with aiding the unfortunate instead of towering above all others as a fictive comic book character.  And there are truly fine performances by Clive Owen (wholly commited to his role as a physician for the masses), Linus Roache, Teri Polo, and Noah Emmerich and of course minor roles played with aplomb by actors from the various locales needing aid - Ethiopia, Cambodia, Chechnya etc.  This film has the appearance of a Blockbuster  in style and execution, but its real importance is in its depiction of the suffering that covers the globe.  In a very touching passage physician Clive Owen addresses the quiet courage of the people in extremis and at that point the message of the movie is driven home with great impact.

As an avid supporter and volunteer in arts and culture here in Des Moines, it made me think about human service needs here in our community and abroad.
