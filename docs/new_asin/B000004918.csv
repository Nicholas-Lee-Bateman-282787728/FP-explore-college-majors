1183518,4,B000004918,"""Runaway""
This is the archetypal ""average"" movie. Whilst not expertly handled by director Crichton (yes, Michael Crichton), Runaway at least succeeds in being reasonably interesting and very watchable. It's one of those movies that succeeds in being very enjoyable without actually being that good; there is something very comfortable about the tone of the whole film. Whilst most of the set-pieces could have been more tightly edited and paced, there is an undeniable consistency in the visuals throughout. And note has to be made of Gene Simmons (yes, from Kiss), who makes a convincing bad guy, and the subtle but workable chemistry between Tom Selleck and the glammed-down Cynthia Rhodes.
The film boasts an impressive electronic score by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith, done in the same year as his beautiful work on Ridley Scott's Legend, at which time Goldsmith was in the process of moving over to synthesizers. The closing theme, which plays out as Selleck and Rhodes kiss under showers of sparks, is exhiliarating.
The DVD is unremarkable, with a fairly good transfer and sound if nothing in the way of extras (unless you're still counting trailers).",995068800,40,1159,5.170212765957447
1183519,4,B000004918,"Featuring both the original Panavision version in 16:9 anamorphic and a pan&scan version for those who don't know why there must be black bars on a widescreen frame.  Also features Dolby Digital 4.0 and Dolby Digital 2.0 sound in English, and monophonic soundtrack in Spanish.  Includes English, Spanish, Portugese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai subtitles.  Special feature worth mentioning is only the original preview. (The preview is actually more interesting than the movie!) The disc is single layer, double sided.  One side in widescreen and the other in full screen Pan&Scan.  Disc replicated by Sony DADC USA.  Authored by Sony DVD Centre.
The movie isn't as bad as a lot of people coin it to be. (After seeing real garbage like ""Space Mutiny"", it's hard to call a bad Hollywood movie ""bad"".)  As for the music, I love the score, which was composed and performed by the master of film music, Jerry Goldsmith.  (Although I can understand why some people may not like it, it does sound eighties as they were performed on Yamaha digital keyboards.  Appropriate, though, given the ""technical"" atmosphere the film attempts to portray.  The score was electronic to help better portray this intent.)  <",994377600,8,1199,5.035532994923858
1183520,3,B000004918,"I'd like to think of myself as an advent movie buff and somewhat of an  audio/video file. I pride myself with my Home Theater and DVD/LD/CD  collection. I'd also like to think that I've got good taste in movies.  There are 2 qualifying criteria that a movie has to meet for my to purchase  it (and it doesn't necessarily have to have both of them in the movie), a  good script and/or great sound. I enjoy a good story line, but I also love  to hear reference quality sound (being that I have a home theater). That  being said, I think this is a decent flick! I must admit though, I'm a  little bias being a big Kiss fan. I ran out to see this movie in the  theater (when it came out) solely for Gene Simmons. I also think Tom  Selleck is a decent actor; he just has the Burt Reynolds and John Ritter  syndrome (guys that can act but seem to pick very BAD movies to act in). It  also has something that I whish more older movies would do...Dolby 4.0 (true  Dolby pro-logic) and not just stereo. I know every movie can't be in THX-EX  and they aren't all going to rumble your house either, but when they can  spread the sound spectrum across the front 3 and the surround speakers, it  just seems to accentuate the mood of the scene, and this movie can do just  that! The only knock on the sound track is the 80's synthesizers, but it's  used more for affect than anything else (so that makes it bearable). Now a  little about the story, Tom Selleck plays a cop who transfers to the  robotics division of the police department because of his fear of heights.  His usual calls are responding to robots (that are designed to do menial  labor) that have for some reason or another, malfunctioned (hence the term  Runaway). Gene Simmons play a High-Tech villain named Charles Luther, and  his only goal is to sell a newly developed bullet that is more like a  ""smart missal"". It acquires and locks onto it's target by using a  persons body heat signature and will literally follow your every move until  it hit's the target. Selleck accidentally stumbles across this and kind of  takes it upon himself (and dragging his partners in with him) to crack the  case.  The affects are cool for the time-line of the movie (especially the  view from the ""smart bullet"" as it chases it's target) and the  story isn't as bad as some of the reviews here make it out to be (even  though everyone is entitled to their own opinion). If you are looking for a  movie to take a chance on, Runaway could be that very movie.",968803200,17,2498,4.3470715835141
1183521,4,B000004918,"Jack Ramsay (Tom Selleck) is a sergeant on the runaway squad - a police squad dedicated to robots.  Ramsay and his new partner (Cynthia Rhodes)  track down an electronics genious named Charles Luther (Gene Simmons) who  has programed robots to kill.  After the murders of two electronic  engineers Ramsay discovers Luther has stolen a new weapon and plans to sell  it to the highest bidder.
Its hard to believe this movie is sixteen years  old.  I like all the actors in this movie and have seen it several times  and it still is not boring.  The only problems i have with it is that the  dvd does not have many options on it and there are two very cheesy scenes  at the begining.",966902400,17,680,4.439024390243903

1183523,4,B000004918,"I don't understand all of the negative comments on this movie.  The story was good.  The cast was good.  The special effects were good.  What is the problem?  Granted it is SCIENCE FICTION!  The story is no more far  fetched than most other hard sci-fi films.  Anyway, I am wasting this  review defending the film from the critics.
The film is based in the  near future, when robots (rather believable ones) can be found in many  homes and businesses performing menial or repetative tasks.  A certain  level of AI has been reached but these machines are far from perfect, and  seem to malfunction with some regularity.  This background sets the scene  for Tom Sellek and his partner who are police officers who specialize in  deactivating ""runaway robots.""  It also forshadows the evil  genius Gene Simmons who has a bunch of wonderful (and lethal) robotic  ""toys.""  He also has developed an explosive ""smart  bullet"" which is encoded with a specific target's thermal pattern and  can home in on that target, even around corners.  Anyway, without giving  anything away, the plot gets more involved as Sellek and partner track down  Simmons to a final exciting showdown.
My best recommendation here is that  if you are a fan of hard sci-fi movies, Tom Sellek, Kirstie Alley, or Gene  Simmons (of Kiss fame) then you will probably like this movie.  It is  nicely paced, with some intense moments and a satisfying, if cliched  ending.  If you are on the fence about whether or not to see this film, get  it.  I'll wager you won't be disappointed.
P.S.  I'm waiting patiently  for the DVD verson.",945129600,100,1592,4.766666666666667
1183524,3,B000004918,"This movie really isn't half bad, in my opinion.  It's not going to stretch your imagination or present you with any moral dilemmas, but the film's pace is good - the plot moves along nicely - and Tom's  sidekick/partner is pretty enough.  Too bad there isn't any nudity (or at  least none worth remembering, apparently) or I would've rated it higher.  I  was secretly pulling for Gene Simmons to kidnap Tom's love interest and  give us an extended ""damsel-in-distress"" torture scene (always a  plus in a he-man action film), but no such luck. Instead, we have Tom  trying to de-fuse an unexploded bomb that's become lodged in her arm.  Policing is a tough job for cops of the future, I guess.
Anyway, it's  good action fare that's worth seeing at least once, particularly if you  like well-done robot props.",927244800,4,808,4.733812949640288

1183558,4,B000004918,"A pretty decent 80's ""high tech"" film that's shown its age some.  The film almost tries to hard to be contemporary and ""futuristic"" (for the time), but it's well shot and the plot and story are actually pretty good.  Combine that with some really top notch casting and you got yourself a pretty good film.  In fact I was impressed with just how well it was shot.  It's not that it's very artistic, but it's exceptionally competent.

If I had some issues with the film, it's that Gene Simmons is a bit over the top, and I'm not sure he was as well portrayed as another actor and director who had more insights into sociopaths might have done.

That, and the tech is a bit dated.  Even for the time I got the sense that whoever was directing this really didn't have too much concept on what robots could do or how they operated.  But I'm thinking that may be more the fault of the screenwriter.

Even so, it's a pretty decent film in spite of it showing some tech-age here and there.  There's some nudity, some swearing, neither of which really needed to be, so it's not really a family film.

Check it out and see what you think.",1504483200,,1128,4.3238095238095235

1183593,4,B000004918,"Runaway, 1984 film

It begins with an emergency call due to a runaway - a machine robot that does not operate as planned. A special police unit will disable the machine. What happened? We see Lois, a model 12 that performs the household tasks of maid, cook, child care, and personal assistant. There is a call for another runaway. What can be causing these problems? Nobody knows. [But there is a hint that someones greed may be the cause.] People have been killed and wounded, the Chief is looking to fix the blame. Can the guilty party be found? There are small vehicles that can chase a police car and explode beneath it! Is there a way to evade them? [Think about the drones of today equipped to carry a bomb to a selected target.]

The evil villain wants the templates that Sergeant Ramsey has, he must bring them to a construction site, alone. An elevator takes Sgt. Ramsey to the top. His son Bobby is released. But there is a trick: the villain will leave no witnesses. However he fails to kill Sgt. Ramsey, who is unarmed. Small mechanical devices (spiders) attack Sgt. Ramsey! Can he restart the elevator to escape? Yes, but there is another confrontation. Of course the good guy wins in the end; the villain meets his mechanical spiders for an ironic ending. Will there be one last surprise? You look awful! There will be a happy ending for Sgt. Ramsey; a mechanical robot cant do everything.

This movie has the look of limited actors and scenery from a lower budget production. The night scenes reduce costs to offset the added costs of those machines and the technicians who operate them. This is an interesting movie but probably doesnt have a wide appeal. Karel Capeks 1920 play R.U.R (Rossums Universal Robots) was the first play to use the idea of mechanical servants that revolted against their human masters. Few have heard of it, even fewer have seen it.

In the real world there have been problems with automobile air bags that don't work or malfunction. What can happen with more complex and expensive devices? Can robots like in this movie ever be cost-effective and replace humans? No, but Im not an expert.",1485648000,,2132,4.662234042553192

1183618,3,B000004918,"In writer/ director Michael Crichton's future world of Runaway, robots will be responsible for duties both at home and in the workplace. Of course man's decision to relegate duties to machines will never be perfect. Look no further than the recent release The Terminator or Crichton's own Westworld (1973).
  ""Magnum P.I."" star Tom Selleck is Jack Ramsay, a cop whose specialty is tracking down errant robots or ""runaways."" He has a young blonde partner (Cynthia Rhodes, John Travolta's love interest in last year's Staying Alive) and a desire to keep matters professional with her. Ironically, he owns a robot which tends to household chores and keeps an eye on the widower lawman's son (Joey Cramer). Ramsay discovers that many of the malfunctioning machines have been tinkered with, thanks to the malevolent plans of Charles Luther (Gene Simmons of the glam rock quartet KISS). He has enabled robots to kill those they once served and has a pretty mistress (Kirstie Alley). Luther also has gotten his hands on some ammunition that can find their targets wherever they may go with both lethal accuracy and devastating results.
  The always likable Selleck seems to be doing nothing more than a reprise of his work on the small screen but with more sophisticated firepower. Selleck almost looks uncomfortable, no doubt realizing that many will stay home to watch his weekly series and maybe catch this film once it arrives on cable. Selleck makes for a reliable enough leading man though his talents are wasted. Still, he and co-star Rhodes do have chemistry and make for an attractive pair. As Selleck's nemesis, Simmons makes for a convincing bad guy. Without the black and white kabukiesque face paint he wore some years ago, he is rather frightening. He has the presence of a captive predatory feline pacing in its cage, longing to be freed from its confinement; and ready to pounce on whatever it may happen upon.
  Rhodes and Alley do little more than look pretty for the camera and wind up being maimed or killed. The only other females (a cop, a female party guest, and the wife of one of Simmons' fellow inventors) are victims. Even Ramsay's robomaid is not spared from violence. The effects are passable. the arachnid-like robots are chilling and the final act has some genuinely terrifying moments. It is almost no surprise when we discover the hero's fear, which this writer will not name, is exploited in the climax.",1472774400,,2430,4.929095354523227

The bad points: the plot is just awful and confusing The movie is from 1984 and takes place in the near future, the year??? Is not mentioned. My guess is 1997, because Tom Selleck's character is born in 1958, actually Selleck was born in 1945. Gene Simmons as the villain is maybe too clever, so he make look Selleck and Rhodes just plain dumb. The robots dominate this near future but they are not perfect and maybe kind of dangerous (????) ... so they need to be controlled by a special police force.

'Course the robots are clunky by today's standards but the designers were thoughtful and much of the concepts are being implemented today (not by the far flung future standards of the 80's though). I found it interesting that the bad guy had steerable devices and DARPA is working on those now.

Speaking of bad guy you can't go wrong having Gene Simmons and Tom Selleck in a movie as villain and hero. Plus Kirstie Allie as bad girl with big hair and heart of gold. Tom is great as always.

1183741,2,B000004918,"I lived through the 80's and have seen plenty of outstanding movies for the period.  This however, is not one of them.  I'm not sure how it falls apart, but it's not just one thing.  The writing and acting were all definitely sub par.  There was one exception :Cynthia Rhodes  I thought she did a good job.

It was cute to see the tech., with the gargantuan chips and circuits of the day.  I tried it out for that as much as Gene Simmons.  Overall, even watching the movie as a spoof film/comedy, I regretted spending even a penny on it.  It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not far away from the bottom of the list.",1419552000,,630,4.183333333333334
1183742,3,B000004918,"Michael Crichton's Runaway (1984) was the famous author's second to last film as director, a fact he was unlikely to have realized at the time as the film was released a good twenty four years before his untimely death in 2008. He only directed seven films (although he was credited as co-writer for several more). Despite this paucity of films, his reputation as an author, screenwriter, and director meant he had little trouble attracting top acting talent, and the cast of Runaway is no exception to this. Feature actors included Tom Selleck, Gene Simmons (the front man of the metal band KISS), and Kirstie Alley.

Most of Crichton's films study the impact that advances in technology would have on current society. As such most of his films (directed or co-written) focus on the ""near future"" where the technology used in everyday people's lives is recognizable. For Runaway the one important change is in the realm of robotics, which has advanced to the point that they are commonplace  a part of everyday life like any other electrical appliance. But unlike most appliances, malfunctioning robots are significantly more dangerous. A special unit of the police handle such runaways, and Selleck is the head of that unit in one such police department.

Crichton had long been interested in what would happen when robots and machines were programmed (or malfunctioning) to kill people. This theme had been explored as some length in Westworld, Crichton's 1973 film (with actor Yul Brynner), and of course in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), but in these films and others the robotic protagonists were somewhat exotic and futuristic. Runaway examines what would happen when robotic technology was already well integrated into society and the effect it would have when someone tampered with careful protections usually programmed into them. To a large extent the film succeeds in this regard.

Downsides: The film's plot, which this review will not summarize, is clichd and silly. Simmons is miscast as the corrupt engineer at the center of the conspiracy. Selleck's performance is workmanlike, but unable to overcome his lack of chemistry with either Cynthia Rhodes (his new partner) or Kirstie Alley (one of Simon's co-conspirators). Film editing and choreography is sufficiently poor at some points that for many scenes the viewer can often imagine Crichton is behind the camera shouting ""action!"" and ""cut!"".

Upsides: Alley and Rhodes give reasonable performances, as do G.W. Bailey (the chief of police) and Stan Shaw (the runaway unit's techie). Viewers familiar with 80's nostalgia will get a kick out of the permed hair and heavy makeup of the female actors, the line-drawn vector graphics in displays, the bulky CRT monitors, and the pin-and-via microchip technology that permeated the electronics of that time.

Bonus: The real gem to be found in this movie is the prescient look at where technology was headed in 1984. The film features hand held PDA's, smart bullets, retina scanners, whole body scanning security devices, work robots, facial reconstruction software, and more. All these items are immediately recognizable in the world of 201X, so much so that viewers get a distinct feeling of deja vu, albeit anachronistically. That earns Runaway its third star (out of five) in this reviewer's opinion--firmly recommended for its pure entertainment value.",1419120000,,3388,5.21875

Tom Selleck is always appealing as an actor, and co-star Cynthia Rhodes is as gorgeous as ever as Selleck's partner in this 80s robot flick. This film was made when Personal Computers and the possibility of home robots (which never panned out) were all the rage. Selleck and Rhodes are cops specializing in robots that malfunction, possibly hurting people. The premise is a little shaky, but this is science fiction. Someone is trying to make killer robots, and therein lies the plot.
With a good cast and a good writer-director (Michael Crichton, no less) one would expect that this film would be excellent. Instead, it is only OK, and it is hard to put one's finger on why. Perhaps it lacks the intensity of say, ""Blade Runner"" or similar serious Sci Fi films. In any case, I found this one watchable once, but not a film that most viewers will return to a second time.

The robot spiders freaked me out as a kid and Cynthia Rhodes was always easy on the eyes. The plot about a microchip smart weapon was clever for its time, and Simmons easily falls into the role of a major twerp!

The performances are really good with Tom Selleck as a guy nice as you could get and Gene Simmons as bad as it gets.  Simmons' icy stare is perfect for his character. The only weakness I found with the movie as a whole was the young man playing Selleck's son in the movie.  Not that he was a terrible actor, but I don't think he was the best for the role. As father/son, they just didn't mesh well, to me.  Also, check out the minor cast players and you will see some future stars and even a future academy award winner in very small role.

The movie is set close enough to our time to feel futuristic even to today, but not so far that we can't relate to anything in the movie.

The special effects are pretty good - especially since this was made over 20 years ago - and I particularly enjoyed watching the heat-seeking bullets fired from the villain's gun. Rock star Gene Simmons, by the way, does a nice job as the bad guy.

As entertaining as this Tom Selleck movie was, it had a B-quality to it with some stupid and predictable dialog. The climactic scenes were very predictable.

Do ya love films made in the past predicting what the future would be like....and getting it so wrong and dated in the process? Wow, then Runaway is for you. Best put, the world's now serviced by robots, not really smart human-like robots but more of the HAL/Doctor Who's Daleks kind. Tom Selleck's a cyber-policeman who you basically call when your robot starts acting crazy, and Gene Simmons (yes, that tongue-enhanced KISS demon who took off his make-up only one year prior) as a madman computer programmer who wants to turn The Jetsons Rosie into his own version of Blade Runner's Replicants. In fact, think of this film as a product of the popularity of 1982's Blade Runner, except much, much worse on every level. Add in a couple of assassin mini-spider robots filled with acid and a very young Kirstie Alley in a strip-search scene (?!!?), and pretty much that's Runaway. Selleck is like ""Magnum P.I. 2010"" here, so don't expect much of an acting stretch from him on this one. I guess the most surprising aspect of the film is that it's not only written by, but directed as well by Michael ""Jurassic Park"" Crichton, and does remind you of one of his earlier than this works in Westworld, just very 80's instead of 70's. Dated, corny, and should be seen by anyone who loves the inaccurate future films just once, Runaway could become one of your newest guilty pleasures on DVD.

Runaway is no GWTW or DZ, but it's a good, very well casted little movie.  What better a villain to have than to be portrayed by Gene ""KISS - demon"" Simmons is there?  He got into his part with relish.  You can tell he enjoyed playing his role.  Tom Selleck is a strong selling point with my wife.  Cynthia Gibb is cute as a button and had no trouble invoking sympathy when she got that explosive bullet lodged in her arm.  Did you realize how big that thing was, probably about a .60-caliber?  Kirsty Ally was great, too.  What a waste - oops, did I just give something away?  I tend to be mean like that.  The plot was pure sci-fi, and the episodes with the robots were downright funny, and rather wicked on occasion.  That cute police woman with big glasses who got iced by a spider-bot in the men's room made me eager to see Simmons' character get his.  Things kept going at a good pace most of the time.  I have to admit my blood sugar rose during the scenes with Ramsey's son.  A bit syrupy there, but oh, well, chase scenes and the conflict on the exterior elevator toward the end pushed the cutesy stuff out of the way like a Mack truck in a parking lot full of VW bugs.  I have a fear of heights myself, so I reeeaaally empathized with Ramsey in the final showdown.  When I saw this movie in the theater, that last little thing Simmons did sent just about everybody straight up out of their seats.

He appears cocky at times but he certainly was a good fit for Michael Crichton's (E.R.) flick. Gene Simmons, (Family Jewels, the Lord of Rock, and member of Kiss) was great as the bad guy Dr. Luther who creates ""spawns of satan"" robots. These robots will kill! Gene has such an evil look and a stare that will frighten anyone. Kirstie Alley (Cheers, Look Who's Talking) plays Dr. Luther's girlfriend and a mule for his templates to turn robots evil.

Ramsay's partner, and G.W. Bailey as Sellick's Sgt. Ramsay's captain in the police force where he is in charge of robotics (runaway robots). G.W. Bailey as in Lt. Harris of Police Academy 1 and 4-6. A side note: If you saw Gene Simmons's Family Jewels you'll see that his mother has one of the robot spiders from this movie on display in her house with what she describes as the dedication room for Gene and his girlfriend and mother of his children Shannon Tweed (Gene refuses to get married but they've been together for more than 2 decades).
  This Sci-fi thriller takes place in the not to distant future where most homes have robots as maids, doing chores, or working on farms. Sgt. Ramsey gets calls about ""runaway robots"" since he is the head honcho in the robotics division in the police department. A runaway farm robot that's mowing down a corn field, to a robot that holds a .357 magnum and a knife holding a baby hostage while it cries in the crib (the baby is crying). The robot apparently is owned by a person who works with Dr. Luther. Sellick finds out Dr. Luther (Simmons) has been making microchips that turn robots into murderers. Simmons in the movie has a awesome missle gun and everything leads up to the showdown between Selleck and Simmons (for a fight to get Ramsay's son Bobby played by Flight of the Navigator's Joey Cramer taken hostage by Dr. Luther) which is not exactly 5 stars but is something you wouldn't fast foward to end it. The showdown between the police and Dr. Luther in the hotel room was great. Gene Simmons has the ultimate evil look perfectly excuted as was also his ""you're not going to take me in"" look (watch as Gene's eyes motion upward). Tom Sellick was an underated actor as well as Gene Simmons in his movie debut. If you like Gene Simmons, check out his show, Family Jewels which spotlights him and his family. I typed a review for it as well. It's funny!
The high price for the DVD with minor extras is puzzling though. I thought it would have deleted scenes ect. The picture is great. I play it on a Philips upscaling DVD-R that I also reviewed.",1184198400,2,2887,4.539347408829174

1183934,5,B000004918,"You know how mechanical things go awry?  Well, in the future, when a robot becomes a ""runaway"", who do you turn to?  Jack Ramsey (Tom Selleck) and his division of the police department.

There are great gizmos in this sci-fi story, such as electronic spiders and bullets that have your name on it.  Though, dealing with the latter, a newspaper had fun pointing out those bullets were so slow and weak that a restaurant table could provide protection.

Michael Crichton did a good job directing it, though he inserted one bit on reincarnation that did not add anything to the story (you should expect a fundamentalist like myself to point that out).  Cynthia Rhodes played one of my all time favorite love interests.  Gene Simmons started off low key, but by the end of the movie, you could easily picture him with his demonic makeup.

I really enjoyed this movie, and would highly recommend it.",1168992000,3,894,4.72258064516129
1183935,4,B000004918,"Runaway is a great classicly old film the robotics are dated but that is to be expected considering its made in 1984!, It still doesn't stop the fact its definately one for the collection?

1183938,3,B000004918,"I'll actually give this one 3 1/2 stars.  It is the future although when is never actually stated but it's certainly the very near future.  A mad Doctor Charles Luther, straight out of Monogram ""B"" movie is creating robotic devices with the power to kill and sending them loose on his targets.  That mag doctor is played by Gene Simmons of KISS and he plays it menacingly to the hilt as a modern day Bela Lugosi.  Over the top but sinfully fun!

Tom Selleck and Cynthia Rhodes play a couple of special Ops cops whose job it is to track down rogue robots.  Kirstie Alley, when she was still smoking hot, plays Luther's secretary.  It was 1984 and this wasn't a huge budget film so don't expect ""I, Robot"" type special effects.  These robots kind of look like the type of things kids could build using that old Robotix construction sets.  Things like mechanical spiders and the such.  Only these robots could shoot bullets or spray acid.

The film was directed by Michael Crichton and he does a pretty decent job with what he has to work with.  The action scenes are done very well, particularly the ""smart bullet"" sequence as well as the climax with Selleck attacked by those robotic spiders.  Selleck is fairly wooden in his role and doesn't seem to fit well with a more gung-ho action role.  It's still a fun movie, if for nothing else than to see Simmons' evil stare.",1110758400,5,1369,4.512195121951219
1183939,4,B000004918,"When I am watching a 1984 sci-fi movie, I am not expecting to see an oscar calibur portrail full of twists and turns.  Some may call it predictible, but myself I feel that the story flowed and made sense.  Too many times have I seen a movie wher its certainly unpredictable because the plot climax comes out of nowhere.  Tom Sellek plays the part well and is very believeable as a hardened and some what cynical cop.  Gene Simmons in one of his only noteworthy film performances takes his KISS type persona and plays the evil genius well. I for one enjoyed this movie alot, and unlike Blade Runner didn't find myself watching it 5 times to understand the very shallow story line. If you are looking for a believeable near future story, pick this up.",1090195200,14,749,4.485294117647059
1183940,4,B000004918,"Poor Tom Selleck. I swear everybody loves him but he never gets a hit movie. This happens to be a very good SciFi movie. I know since there are not many I don't own. Not to mention you have a good director and great music. Add in a cool evil Vectrocon doctor played by Gene ""Kiss"" Simmons with killer insect like robots and you have a winner.

Selleck plays Sgt. Jack Ramsey, a cop that polices runaway robots. Since most of them are fairly harmless house units it starts out a bit comical. But as the story develops with a Vectrocon secretary played by Kirstie Alley finding out about killer robots. Add in some incredible heat seeking signature bullets that can turn corners and the tension mounts.

The DVD includes some extras including Bios on the stars. The picture and sound quality are sharp. Well worth owning on DVD, especially for fans of Tom Selleck.",1055203200,70,862,4.554838709677419

7903294,5,B000004918,"The movie itself may or may not be to your liking, however, I just want to say the dvd is pretty good.  It seems like an early-ish dvd release so the picture isn't 100% as a newer master would be, so it looks a little soft, but other than that, once you're into the movie there's not a problem.  Interestingly it has Dolby 4.0 and at first I thought it meant it wouldn't use the subwoofer, but was presently surprised when there were some instances of some nice deep but clear base.  Of course there's not a lot I think mainly because of how the scenes in the movie go, but it sounds really good.  Surround is pretty good and all the voices seem clear.  So if you like this movie, and are unsure of whether the quality of the dvd picture and audio are, don't really need to worry, except you need to realize this was from the 80's and is one of the more obscure sci-fi-thrillers out there.  So it didn't get as much love and attention as some of the other more famous movies from the time period.

If you want a review of the movie itself, I would suggest you go search online, I like the movie pretty good but these reviews on Amazon should be about the product itself not the movie.

One quick little note to maybe parents or some people who like to be careful about the content they watch, this is PG-13 because of the subject matter (a killer who uses high tech weaponry) and I think there was an F-bomb dropped, but also there's a scene where a woman is seen topless for a few moments, so just in case anyone cares about that.",1519776000,,1531,4.201365187713311
