641970,5,6303402666,"""I Like It Like That,"" written and directed by Darnell Martin, tells the story of Lisette (Lauren Velez), a young Latina living in the Bronx. When her husband, Chino (Jon Seda) gets into serious trouble, Lauren must support their family. Her attempts to find self-respect and economic stability bring her into conflict with Chino, with her scheming, materialistic mother-in-law (Rita Moreno), and with a white record company executive (Griffin Dunne). Along the way, she gets advice and moral support from Alexis (Jesse Borrego), her sibling, who is a male-to-female transsexual.
""I Like It"" is a film that is full of life. Through his characters, director Martin offers thoughtful insights on ethnicity, gender identity, family ties, economic pressures, and other issues. The Santeria religion is an interesting backdrop to some of the plot. And the film as a whole is well complemented by a diverse musical score: I heard such elements as R&B, rap, and salsa.
The film is enhanced by excellent performances by the mostly Latino cast. It is especially fun to see Latina icon Rita Moreno playing the role of the arrogant mother-in-law (who boasts of her family's ""pure Castillian blood"") with gusto. Tomas Melly is impressive as Lisette's young son, who faces the temptations of the street. But perhaps the most memorable performance is delivered by Jesse Borrego as the transgendered Alexis; he is alternatingly bitchy, nurturing, witty, and heartbreaking, but always with a core of dignity. I give this film an enthusiastic recommendation.",989107200,23,1541,5.2682926829268295
641971,5,6303402666,"I LOVE this movie. It's terribly funny, brutally honest and as fine a movie on Nuyoricans as you will find. Lauren Velez is extraordinary as Lissette. Her relationship with her son ""C"" will bring tears to your eyes. Jon Seda is slammin as the philandering husband who's a whore, but one with a heart who loves his wife and kids. This movie manages to do what most other ""minority"" movies do not; be funny while tackling serious issues, and honest without resorting to base stereotypes. I pray that Darnell Martin gets more play because of this wonderful debut.",973641600,12,560,4.724489795918367
641972,5,6303402666,"""I Like It Like That,"" is a film will fascinate mostly anyone interested in Latin culture in the United States. Lissete Linares (Velez) is a homemaker, mother of three young kids, and wife to an unfaithful  husband. After a sudden change of events (her husband is arrested for  looting) Lisette finds herself out to fend for her and her kids in the  gritty, tragic world we know as the South Bronx. Director Darnell Martin,  who was a protege of Spike Lee, brings the cast alive utilizing realism and  humor, and the spporting cast, especially Jesse Borrego as Lisette's  transvestite brother are scene stealers due to their versatility in  performing both comically and dramatically. Students of Sociology,  Anthropology, and Hispanic Studies should watch this film to understand the  true status of Puerto Ricans who in the United States and the effects the  economic diaspora of the early 20th Century brought to their development.  Viewwers should pay careful attention to the main character's views on  welfare, religion, and family to understand that although many Puerto  Ricans live in poverty they have what many Hispanics who are successful  don't have : happiness. Feminists and Women's Studies students should also  take time to view this film to view the essence of Latina sexuality and  machismo in Latino culture, and also to see the emergence of an empowered,  financially-independent woman from the shackles of male servitude. AN  EXCELLENT FILM THAT SHOWS THE POWER OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT!",951696000,16,1504,5.144628099173554

7846310,5,6303402666,"This is one of my favorite movies. It mixes drama with comedy that most latins can relate to. Its drama that isn't so far fetched like most movies. It is something that has actually happen to most people. I guess because I have been through those kind of hardships and I know many friends that have been through them too, it made the film more real and understandable. It was real right down to the ... that is always trying to get your man. One of my favorite moments is when John Seda says ""I make crazy, stupid love.""",1040947200,2,520,4.262626262626263
