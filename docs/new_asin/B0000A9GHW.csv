8070338,4,B0000A9GHW,"Cool and Crazy was a wonderful film about the Berlevag men's chorus.  The original film interspersed interviews with the mostly aging chorus members, living in a tiny Norwegian fishing village, with scenes of the chorus performing songs against the local scenery (And, as the town is located above the arctic circle, the conditions shown are often quite severe).  It was a charmer.

Well, the sequel features the chorus during a U.S. tour.  Regrettably, the chorus is in New York city on September 11, 2001.  The events of that tragic day inevitably overwhelm the film.  The director works very hard to absorb, honor, and make sense out of the American reaction to the attack, but it is clearly not the kind of film that he had been prepared to make.  Many of the Norwegian chorus members express concern about what the attack will do to America, and their comments are eerily prescient as we look back now six years later.  Watching this is worthwhile, but not ""fun.""

I do recommend the movie as a fascinating look at 9/11--as it happened--from the perspective of these kindly Norwegians.  It is still a pleasure to spend time with these men, but don't look for the joy that so many of us loved in the original.",1194307200,,1213,4.706161137440758
