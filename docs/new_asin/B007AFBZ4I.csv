5071569,4,B007AFBZ4I,It's so exciting to see literature that's been read come to life in film. The only thing that could have been better would have been to allow the entire Madaris family books be a made for tv series.,1349827200,,198,4.2368421052631575
5071570,5,B007AFBZ4I,I read the book and totally enjoyed the movie.  I was in awe as to how the adaptation was so close to the book.  The scenes with Felicia and her son Austin were touching and those of Felicia and Trask were hot and romantic. And those Madaris uncles were a hoot.  Very good for an independent movie. Ms. Jackson I am ready for another movie.  How about doing Surrender next.  I would love seeing Ashton Sinclair in his loin cloth.,1349740800,,429,4.3125
5071571,5,B007AFBZ4I,"I found this movie to be very enjoyable. Although it is not as long and as detailed as i would've liked, it is still a very good movie taken directly from the book. I give this movie more than 5 stars.",1348963200,,201,3.926829268292683
5071572,5,B007AFBZ4I,The movie was fantastic.  The movie didn't deviate from the book as many movies do when making a book into a movie. I have watched it several times and still enjoy it as if it was the first time.,1348012800,,195,4.0
5071573,5,B007AFBZ4I,"Truly EVERLASTING,THIS WAS A WONDERFUL MOVIE, I LOVE THIS MOVIE I WILL WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER AND I WISHED I WAS PLAYING THAT PART FELICIA, WAS PLAYING.BECAUSE TRASK IS A SEXY ASS MAN I WILL KISS HIM AND NEVER STOP.I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE MOVIE AND THIS WAS ONE SEXY SIZZLING MOVIE..I JUST LOVE THIS MOVIE..IF I EVER MET TRASK  IN REAL LIFE I WILL ASK HIM TOO MARRIED ME. BECAUSE THIS BROTHER REALLY SEXY, I MEAN BABY IS REALLY FINE..",1344729600,,446,4.373493975903615
5071574,5,B007AFBZ4I,I enjoyed the movie very much even though I have not read the book. I knew the characters from the other books by Ms. Jackson.,1344297600,,126,4.08
5071575,2,B007AFBZ4I,I am a HUGE fan of Mrs. Jackson and I loved this story BUT I did not like the movie or the actress who played Felicia!!!The emotional scenes were horrific! She ruined the movie for me! I imagined the Madaris Men in my mind and when they showed the uncles picture once I again I was highly disppointed. Im sorry to write this review but I purchased the movie extremly excited but after watching it once I gave it away to another fellow Brenda Jackson Book lover.,1344038400,3,461,4.310344827586207
5071576,4,B007AFBZ4I,I went to the premiere of this movie that was financed and produced by Ms. Jackson. It is based on the book by the same name. Being that the film  was made on a tight budget(at times it really shows)it was a labor of love for Ms. Jackson. It stays very true to the book and though most of the actors are unknown they met my expectations  of the main characters in the story. If you are a fan of Ms. jackson you will appreciate the time and effort she took to bring her characters to life.,1337040000,20,488,4.020618556701031

5071581,1,B007AFBZ4I,Actors could not act.  Hate I wasted my money and I love my Madaris Family I have all books!,1425686400,,92,3.8421052631578947
5071582,2,B007AFBZ4I,"Ms. Jacksons books are always well-written, so that gave rise to my ability to get over the poor acting. The actress chosen for this film didn't pull off the essence of the books heroine Felicia; the stagnate speech; eye rolling, etc., of Felicias character was over-the-top to say the least. Perhaps, Ms. Jackson can employ more recognizable actors for her next film; or better trained actors. For example, the BET films that were produced for Arabesque books a few years back; those were excellent and Im not sure why they didn't produce more.",1422921600,,545,4.870967741935484

5071585,1,B007AFBZ4I,"There is not a Brenda Jackson book written that I have not read.  I check her web pages religiously waiting for the next novel.  I could not wait for this movie to come out to put faces and emotions to the characters in her book that I have loved for years.  I am not an avid movie/television watcher so I am not versed in the quality of Independent movies, so forgive me for saying this, but the acting in this movie was stiff and uninspiring.  I have faith that the cast will improve, and I wish them much success in their future endeavors.",1411257600,,542,4.233009708737864
5071586,5,B007AFBZ4I,loved it! Great considering the small budget. The lead actors chemistry was off the chain!,1410566400,,90,5.066666666666666
5071587,1,B007AFBZ4I,"I ended up watching this movie during a random night at a friend's house who has Netflix. A random romantic movie was picked and this was it. This movie was obviously low budget and just all over the place. Not to mention everything in it was contrived and done before, from the little boy wanting to a ""Christmas daddy"" to the leads' love/hate typical romantic movie romance. I said it was all over the place because not only was the editing weird, but the tone was too. There was the typical mushy family Christmas movie subplot with the boy but also there was ""steamy"" love scenes that weren't explicit and didn't show much more than kissing, but went on too long for a ""family"" film. And there was more than one. Oh, and did I mention... The acting was terrible! The female lead can bearly act and nothing she said was believable like she actually came up with her words on the spot. I've never heard of Brenda Jackson before this movie but I'm guessing the book was better than the movie (also explains all the subplots and the unnecessary PG-13 love scenes which were probably different in the book but lowered in the film to ""keep it for the family""). Really a shame.",1408147200,,1174,4.490654205607477
5071588,1,B007AFBZ4I,"Brenda Jackson is amazing at weaving words together and making magic. However, this movie fell so short, you're forced to search for something good to say. Maybe it's because the characters that I read about in the book are not being portrayed properly on the screen, but, I found it impossible to connect to them. The woman playing Felicia was such a bad actress I'm convinced she thought that she was still auditioning. She tried so hard to play the role that you could actually tell that she was trying. There was no acting from her, there was only reciting words she'd memorized from a script. She also took forever to finish a sentence and pronounce her words. Why did nobody yell cut and force her to do it again? Her attitude never changed, she was mad the whole time, even while talking to her son about Trask. She played the same role from beginning to end. It was like listening to a singer sing in the same key. And why, I ask, is this child asking for a daddy? He's way too old for this. The character definitely should have been younger. It really was a struggle to sit through.

Clayton and Syneda have always been portrayed as the married couple that can't keep their hands off each other. I didn't see or feel any passion from these two, which left me sorely disappointed.

Quick note: the picture of the uncles....which one was Jake? Because none of them were attention grabbers. Honestly, Trask and Clayton didn't even get my attention. The men in Mrs. Jackson's books are supposed to be drop dead gorgeous and well, they weren't that.

Although I won't stop reading Mrs. Jackson's books, because she is an amazing writer, I may be forced to leave her movies to those of you who actually liked this one. There is a talent that goes into choosing a great cast for a movie, so I have to wonder, who was involved in casting this movie? Whoever it was, does not have the Midas touch.",1407888000,6,1897,4.492753623188406
5071589,5,B007AFBZ4I,"I love this movie. Felicia & Trask Maxwell story will always be one of my favorites. It's takes an great man to love a woman back to health after she has been hurt, a strong woman to allow herself to heal and family to help us every step of the way. Trask was awesome to step in and care for a child that was not his just to give him is Christmas wish, not many would do it. In this movie we see the gift of an unexpected love at a time when it was needed most. This is a story of love, trust, change, family and second chances. I give it 5 stars it's a must see. Mrs BJ did it again contrary to the opinion of others this is a really good movie to be her first movie. I cannot wait for the next movie. As always love triumphs over all.",1399852800,,736,3.816993464052288
5071590,4,B007AFBZ4I,"I watched this dvd by one of my favorite author's.  Thanks for making this movie.  It was hot.  I am just wondering will there be anymore dvd's coming out in the future, Mrs Jackson?",1394236800,,182,4.294117647058823
5071591,4,B007AFBZ4I,This movie was very good for a first production. I enjoyed the characters chemistry so much that I went and bought Brenda Jackson's book. Now I'm a fan!,1393200000,,152,4.464285714285714
5071592,5,B007AFBZ4I,I overall loved the movie i had never heard of none of the actors accept maybe 2 but i think the movie great now Mikki Marbra for it to have been her first movie i believe in my heart she did exactly what she was suppose to do far as her role If Felicia was the attitude type then that was the role that was suppose to be played if you watch the movie and take away the attitude that Felicia had she did an excellent job playing her part in the movie. If felicia had an attitude in the book then she suppose to have attitude in the movie Felicia didn't always have an attitude in the movie it was a Excellent movie and i would recommend it to anybody!!!!!!,1391731200,,656,4.015267175572519
5071593,3,B007AFBZ4I,Thw two main characters were good as well as the litltle boy. Clayton and Syneda Madaris' character were quite disappointing to me. They appeared as two classless individuals.,1391212800,,175,5.285714285714286
5071594,5,B007AFBZ4I,I have enjoyed reading Brenda's books and now watching her movie. I am looking forward to the next movie coming soon.,1389312000,,117,4.619047619047619
5071595,2,B007AFBZ4I,"Let me start by saying I absolutely love and support independent films. This one unfortunately was a disappointment for many reasons. The female lead is a horrible actress. I don't know who made the decision to cast her in this role but, it was not a good choice. I agree with the reviewer who said she spoke like she had an attitude through out the entire movie (even when it wasn't necessary). It was very very annoying and took away from what could have been a good film. Don't take my word for it, watch it for yourself. It even sounded like some of the actors were reading a book and not acting, The little boy that played her son was entirely too old for that role. A younger child would have been more believable reciting that type of dialogue.",1386892800,,751,4.371428571428571
5071596,5,B007AFBZ4I,Awesome great movie. I would love to see more of Brenda Jackson books on DVD . Waiting for the Westmoreland's movies next,1386115200,,121,4.545454545454546
5071597,5,B007AFBZ4I,For a independent movie it was good. The actors made the characters believable and it was nicely well writen. I enjoy watching it over again.,1385164800,,141,4.68
5071598,3,B007AFBZ4I,"I just recently chanced upon this movie and since i do like Brenda Jackson i was intrigued.  I have read some of the Madaris stories but not this one in particular.  I can tell they did a good job writing the script to match the book so kudos on that.  But i have to be honest the acting was Horrible!!.  I always want to see the books turn into movies so i hope ms Jackson n her crew read these reviews as a critique and as a stepping stone to help them on the next project.  The girl who played Felicia was horrible n i could tell she was acting as one with an attitude but i don't think thats how she should have spoken in the whole movie.  The lady who played Syneda nailed her lines and it flowed not like she was reading the book the whole time. The other actors were okay but i think they needed a better director and this would have moved so much smoothly.  I do hope they can make another movie but learning from the errors of this one and reviews it comes out better. Good job on the maiden one tho, I would watch it again",1384473600,,1032,4.004878048780488
5071599,1,B007AFBZ4I,"I had to skip through this movie a bit because the acting is HORRIBLE! On the dinner scene the news reporter lady even made an expression before the text even came in (the text was supposed to be unexpected). Sorry the acting is horrible! Sounded like they were reading straight from the book, pausing at the periods, commas etc and all......",1384214400,5,342,4.622950819672131
5071600,3,B007AFBZ4I,Followed the book almost word by word. Maybe next time a little more acting. I love Brenda Jackson's Books and family sagas.,1383436800,,124,4.681818181818182

5071602,5,B007AFBZ4I,This dvd scored big time.  It was as close to the novel as you could get.  The actors were great and done a great job bringing the Madaris's to life.  I pray there are more movies forthcoming in Brenda's and Gerald Jackson future.  I would love for Brenda to bring some of the Westmorelands to the world of dvd.,1364169600,,311,4.220338983050848
5071603,5,B007AFBZ4I,Brenda well done. I have all your books and this movie almost followed the book to a tee. Trask was fine and Clayton was as well. I was hoping to get a look at Dex and Justin. I pictured Syneda being a little lighter but that was fine. I loved the movie and cannot wait on others. Job well done with your husband and sons.,1361491200,2,322,3.9692307692307693

5071605,5,B007AFBZ4I,"I feel this film was one of those films you love to hate,to some the pace of the film may have seemed sluggish at first,but the pace had to be set, for future films and because I am a huge fan,and I am very familiar with Mrs Jackson's novels she is very detailed which I feel is one of the great characteristics that required her to become a renowned author and now has evolved into her first independent film,this film stayed true to the book,and was condensed into a wonderful romance film, this film was not the ordinary,boy meets girl,girl falls for boy and live happily everafter. This was a film where Man(Trask Maxwell)knew and was aware of the Woman and Woman(Felicia Madaris)was aware of the Man,and they both succumb to there years of suppressed feelings and Felicia's son and family had a hand or two in Felicia and Trask paths crossing,and as for Felicia's son (Austin)he had his own reasons,and in the midst of it all they all got what they desired,and it unveiled into a Truly Everlasting film,by a excellent author by the name of Mrs. Brenda Jackson, can't wait until the next film,if you have not seen the movie ""it is a must see"" hats off to Mrs Jackson son Gerald Jackson Jr. for bringing the book to life,and if you have not read this book among any other Brenda Jackson novels they are phenomenal reads,and like I tell those who I come in contact with if you have not heard of Author Brenda Jackson,let me introduce you to her readings and I will advise you that you will get hooked to true love all over again.",1350518400,,1531,4.4714285714285715

This independent movie shows what you can achieve on a reasonable budget while putting in hours, days etc of hard work and dedication.
Yes the movie wasn't hollywood but for hard core fans such as myself it was a throughly enjoyable movie which brought the book to life and only left me wanting more. I hope mrs jackson can find that support in order to bring us another book turned into a movie, this would be a pure delight and I would absolutely purchase that and recommend to others!",1350086400,,616,4.558558558558558

I really loved reading the book it was such a touching and romantic story. It had all the elements of a truly good book for me - romance, family, love, friendship, humor as well as hot love scenes. So when I heard it was going to be turned into a movie, I was truly excited being a huge Brenda Jackson fan. Once I saw the movie I was sincerely impressed with the product Mrs. Jackson and her team created. The movie pretty much followed the storyline in the book of course it was not exactly the same because some scenes had to be left out for filming purposes. Nevertheless, I was happily surprised and excited about what I did see on film. I have seen the movie many times. I love it each time I watch it.

Keep in mind this is an independent movie, so it's not the big Hollywood props and blockbuster type of scenes. However, I thought the actors in the movie were very good, especially for their first movie role. There were a few standouts for me -- Omarr Dixon who plays Clayton Madaris, Charte Jones as Syneda Madaris, Robin Reed who plays Cherie Saunders, Schwanda Winston who plays Mrs. Gardner. They did a wonderful job and came across on screen as very believable. Now for eye-candy, let's give it to the Delivery Man played by Randy Richwood and Alex Maxwell played by Jullian Goodin. Kenny Rogers as Trask Maxwell played his role good as well, not to bad for a first timer. Now the leading lady Mikki Marbra as Felicia was beautiful and likable. I would have to say everyone in the movie did a good job adding to the over all feel of the movie.

The Five Alive Films, Mrs. Brenda Jackson and the rest of the team produced a well-rounded film that's truly entertaining and enjoyable.

Let's not forget about the soundtrack. BreMaDa Productions did an awesome job with the music. BrianH and Jamia Alesia soulful voices really emphasize the romantic elements of the movie. I really, really, really loved the entire CD. If I had to pick favorites, it would be Truly Everlasting. One Love and He's So Fine. If you love old school R&B you will enjoy the music on the CD.

By the way, with the upcoming Holidays, this movie and soundtrack will be great gifts to give for Thanksgiving, Christmas and Valentine's Day.  Give the gift of Love!!

Sure there are things that could've,should've and did not happen and Ms. Jackson knows this.

5071623,4,B007AFBZ4I,I have read nearly all of Mrs. Jackson's books and I couldn't wait for this DVD. The storyline is good as it follows one of the Madaris family. The actors were juicy and definite eye-candy. I applaud Mrs. Jackson for bringing to life one of her books. I look forward to seeing one of her books hit the main stream theaters. Keep up the great work Mrs. J.,1349827200,,354,4.220588235294118

5071625,4,B007AFBZ4I,"For Brenda Jackson fans, this is a home run! This film did something that is rarely done in big budget productions...it stuck to the original book.  Perhaps that is the advantage of self-production.  Congratulations Ms. Jackson!!! I for one am anxiously waiting on your next film endeavor. (The Midnight Hour or Unfinished Business would be phenomenal!)",1349827200,,353,5.285714285714286
5071626,4,B007AFBZ4I,"I have to applaud Brenda Jackson in her first movie effort!  Considering that she financed the movie herself, just for her readers, says a lot about Brenda.  The movie was true to the story, which was a great plus!  Yes, there were a couple of hits and misses, but the same can be said for movies produced and financed by the Hollywood big wigs.  But all in all, I enjoyed the movie and Brenda profusely for all that she did to bring her story to life just for her readers!",1349827200,,473,4.222222222222222
5071627,4,B007AFBZ4I,"Truly Everlasting, the movie, was excellent! Brenda  Jackson  and crew did a tremendous job in making the novel come alive  in movie format. It has made me want to see more of her novels in this format. I know finances play a major role in this type of production. I highly recommend the video to All  Brenda Jackson fans and those who love this genre!",1349827200,,352,4.369230769230769

5071629,3,B007AFBZ4I,"I attended the movie premier of Truly Everlasting count it a Blessing have been able to share in Mrs. Brenda Jackson's wonderful accomplishment. From the refreshments, sound track<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brenda-Jackson-s-Truly-Everlasing-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B007LNJ67W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brenda Jackson's Truly Everlasing (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)</a>, to the actual move, everything was on point. The movie stayed true to the original story. Mrs. Jackson did an awesome job on her a first self produced film, with limited resources and a tight budget. Believe me when I say that I have seen some real stinkers (movies) with well know ""A-list"" actors that had huge budgets, but this movie was no where near that category. True, many of the actors were new to acting, and though not polished, they were not horrific. Tyler Perry went through very similar trials when he first started and look at him now. Like Mr. Perry, Mrs. Jackson believes in giving back to the community, encourages young adults, and is always welcoming to her readers. It was a honor to know that I had a tiny part in helping her dream, of a self made film come to life. May the Lord continue to Bless and Keep Mrs. Brenda Jackson.",1349827200,,1284,5.589743589743589
5071630,4,B007AFBZ4I,"As an extra in this movie, I seen first hand what it takes to make a movie. I enjoyed it very much and I
give Brenda Kudoos for taking on this project. I have read the book numerous times as I do all her books
and I like the way she stuck to the story line.",1349827200,,257,3.607142857142857
5071631,4,B007AFBZ4I,I've watched this movie several times and loved it each time. I love the fact that it held true to the book with a little extra storyline added. If you loved the book you will love the movies even more.,1349827200,,202,4.075
5071632,4,B007AFBZ4I,I am a fan of Brenda Jackson and I have read the book as well as own the DVD of the movie.  This movie stayed very true to the storyline of the book it did not change anything and I for one enjoyed it for that very reason.  You see a while back BET was turning Arabesque novels into movies and they had included another one of Mrs. Jackson's books which happened to be my all time favorite book One Special Moment and they change the storyline which then ruined the movie for me.  It is important that the movie stays true to the book just like Truly Everlasting did.  Good movie and I am looking forward to more by Mrs. Jackson.,1349827200,,629,4.131147540983607
5071633,4,B007AFBZ4I,"I have been a Brenda Jackson fan for many years and I can truly say I am proud of Brenda in her accomplishments of doing this movie. It's not easy to do.  I know the budget was tight, but she brought out some good qualities in this movie. For a first time at it, I commend her work.  I bought the DVD and plan to watch it again.  I know some comments were negative, but having a son in the music business and seeing what all goes into this type of business, you have to walk in her shoes first.  Everything is not smooth sailing working on a project like this. It takes dedication, thick skin and alot of hard work.  Money is an issue as well. Consider that the next time you comment.  Just ask Tyler Perry.  Brenda, congratulations on your first project and I hope to see more.",1349827200,3,778,4.1466666666666665
5071634,4,B007AFBZ4I,"I love anything Ms J puts together for her fans to enjoy and Truly Everlasting was no exception. The actors/actresses were good and I was able to follow along with the storyline. As a reader, I expect the movie to be different but I hate the ones that switch up the storyline, this wasn't the case. What several reviewers fell to realize is the fact that ""million dollar"" actors/actresses cost ""million dollar"" money. These actors/actresses needed a break or a start and I think they were awesome. Ms J, I am ""Fan Base"" and we are standing by for Movie #2. Let's do this. I was thinking of Sterlings story...lol...I love the history of his paternal heritage.",1349827200,,658,4.632478632478633

I can't wait for the next movie from Ms. Jackson. ""The Midnight Hour"" maybe?",1349827200,3,250,3.9019607843137254
5071636,5,B007AFBZ4I,"I truly enjoyed the movie version of the book and it was on point.  I am a huge fan of Mrs. Jackson's work and I see bigger and better things ahead. The chemistry in the movie between Felicia and Trask was HOT, HOT, HOT.  Watching the movie was like reading the book, the script was the same so you knew what to expect.  Yes, there were no big name stars in the movie, but why should there be?  The movie was based on a book by an author who conveys love and a happy ending in all of her books. Tyler Perry started his plays off the same way. I feel that you really can't get real life drama from A list actors because in reality, they get paid to act for it to seem real.  I am glad that the movie will possibly give an opportunity for these actors to branch out and do more things.  Case in point, the person who portrayed the character of Clayton was in an episode of 'Single Ladies' and he got to kiss Lisa Raye** Big name and well established actors are great, but I truly adored this movie.  I highly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of Mrs. Jackson or just an avid reader.  Things can only get better.  A great idea would be to read the book, buy the DVD and if you have book club meetings or such, share it with your group!!! **HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD*** PICK UP YOUR COPY TODAY",1349827200,,1292,4.05511811023622
