7952551,3,B00005RHFF,"American Pie 1 is definitely worth checking out, it has the comedy, charm, and sleaziness that were once great in the 80's but were lost in the 90's. It's a high school film that could've been a little more serious, but it was serious enough, and definitely portrayed young high school boys the way most of them really are. Yes, they're horny and stupid sometimes, but also have feelings and are confused about love, and can be as lonely as anyone now matter what their ""status"" is. I definitely recommend it.
American Pie 2 takes the same cast a year later once in college. This one isn't as good. Why? B/c it's completely full of college cliches and stereotypes. The actors acting abilites just seemed to worsen dramatically (the whole story with those 2 x-lovebirds coming back together as ""friends"" after a year was so ridiculously stupid and unrealistic it made me wanna vomit, not to mention how laughably horrible they acted it out), and the college experience as a whole was completely superficial. Granted there are a couple of funny parts during the film, they're mostly unnessecary goofy antics that are really the only things holding the movie up.
Even though the first was pretty good, both films' depictions of the teenage obsession with sex went a little far sometimes, it becomes hard to believe. Ask any REAL highschooler, having sex at that age isn't as huge a deal as it is portrayed, and if it is a huge deal, it's because of movies like this. Buy the first, rent the second.",1039132800,,1495,4.688212927756654
7952552,5,B00005RHFF,"Personally,I would suggest for people to see the first one before they see the second one. I thought the first one was the
funniest and the best one out of the two. The second movie is
more serious and has more of a story line. It's not as funny as
the first one but it has it's funny scenes. I think American Pie
part 1 is one of the best teenage comedy's ever made,If you love
teenage comedy's,you'll love American Pie.",1036368000,,421,4.209876543209877
7952553,5,B00005RHFF,"These movies are so funny that the first time I saw each of them I laughed so hard I couldn't catch my breath.  Sure they are both sophomoric, that is what they are ment to be, no hidden purpose, no message, just laughter.  You just have to see the movies, and judge for yourself which one is your favorite, they are both great.",1034294400,,328,4.190476190476191
7952554,4,B00005RHFF,"American Pie 2 is a great movie......if u just need a good laugh every now and then.  Stifler real steals the show in this one.  The part when they are convincing the girls to strip and do things to one another is classic,  Ages 19-25 will really enjoy. GO SEE IT...........",1029542400,,274,4.333333333333333
7952555,5,B00005RHFF,"I guess you'll just have to watch and find out!  (But if I were you, I think I'd stray from the creamy filling.)",1021507200,,112,3.869565217391304
7952556,4,B00005RHFF,"This is not like most teen movie sequels (remember Porky's II?) in that it keeps well up to the standards of the first. The gang is all there from the first movie, but here they have left school and we see them going off on holiday after their first term in college. The main four characters decide rent a beach house while... you guessed it, Allyson Hannigan goes off to Band Camp! There are some great moments like when Jim accidentally mixes up a tube of lubricant with a tube of superglue, and well you can guess what happens. The supporting cast is also here, but it's Eugene Levy who really shines. Playing Jim's Dad, he is so incredibly dead-pan in his portrayal of an awkward embarrassed father who wants to do the right thing for his son. He had me rolling off my chair in laughter. Stiffler's Mom also returns, but for a brief cameo, and Allyson Hannigan could also have featured more prominently. The only quibble with the story is that the first movie's premise of a pact between the four guys couldn't really be repeated, but it's a brave attempt and the documentaries included with the DVD show what a lot of fun the cast and crew had making it.",1017705600,2,1159,4.446009389671362
7952557,5,B00005RHFF,Both of these movies are a must see!  Have to watch the first one or re-watch first one to understand some of the situations in 2.  Jason Biggs is a riot!  And the band camp scene was a classic.  We got to go into Band Camp to actually see what happens there!  All the old characters are back in 2 and it is just as good as the first.  Must have in the DVD collection if you are a collector!,1016150400,,391,3.825
7952558,3,B00005RHFF,"i didn't stay awake for the first installment of this soon to be teen trilogy, and kind of wish i hadn't for this one. if not for a few scenes that saved the film, i wouldn't have bothered.",1015286400,,189,4.0
