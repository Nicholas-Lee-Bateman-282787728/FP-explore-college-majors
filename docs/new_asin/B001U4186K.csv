3796583,3,B001U4186K,"First of all it doesn't make any sense to buy groups like these unless you can find enough redeeming features in all of them to make them worth watching. I thought the most about the Day After Tomorrow, the weakest of the group. I found that if you ignore the pretense, i.e., that the world is going freeze up, flood, and otherwise go to hell all within a few days, its not so bad. Watch it for the effects. The Terminator is an easy pick, and while I, Robot did not in any meaningful way track the classic Asimov story it does have its good points. You just wonder why they didn't follow the Asimov story to begin with. If you're a sci-fi geek, go for it. Otherwise, buy The Terminator and forget the other two.",1245801600,,712,4.242647058823529
3796584,2,B001U4186K,"why but 2 movies you don't want when you could buy a collectors edition  terminator  blu-ray movie for  less?

terminator  is by far the best movie  of the  set.  even 25 years later it has held up nicely  even the stop motion effects of the  evil robot  are acceptable and  add to the  charm of this classic sci fi film.  but for $30 you could get a collectors addition with mulitple discs that include commentaries and making of features  that you would enjoy much much  more than  the day after tommorow and I, robot

also the gold box price is still $29  thats about the same deal you will get at costco or target  so don't be in a rush to grab this ""deal""",1244764800,,660,4.169354838709677
8342812,4,B001U4186K,"Three movies, i Robot being the best in this series. Day after Tomorrow being second best. And Terminator.. is terminator..

If you love any of these three movies, it is a good deal getting 3 movies for the average price of a single new release.

Good deal, decent movies. See the individual movies pages for full reviews, there are many.",1354492800,,338,4.616666666666666
8342813,2,B001U4186K,Excellent update except for The Terminator. I guess the original film is not good enough to enhance the movie detail as it did for the other two movies in this combo package. The sound for The Terminator is not enhanced and makes me wish I had passed on this Blu-ray disc.,1331856000,,272,4.352941176470588
8342814,5,B001U4186K,"very good price, movies you must have, I Robot with Will Smith great Story and awesome effects, the same with The Day after Tomorrow, terminator the quality is not the best but it is better for the dvd version, I love this pack, I recomend you. Additionaly the section of special features is full of exclusive material. each one of B ray has at least five hours of content",1314576000,,372,4.405797101449275
8342815,4,B001U4186K,i bought this collection because i was going to buy them seperately but whwn i saw this deal i jumped on it,1262822400,,107,3.909090909090909
8342816,5,B001U4186K,Great value for money! 3 great movies at a great price. The sound and video quality of all the movies are great! Terminator being a 1984 has a video quality a bit inferior that the other two. Also keep in mind that 'The Day After Tomorrow's' certain scenes have rather below par CGI. I Robot is the best in CGI and visuals effects of the lot but as I said all there are great in its own way.,1262217600,,391,4.0256410256410255
8342817,5,B001U4186K,i love bluray so i am probably bias.  but i would recommend it to anyone.,1262044800,,73,3.8666666666666667
8342818,5,B001U4186K,"Less than 10bucks a bluray and I'm interested, I'm cheap I can't help it.  I love The Terminator as its a cult classic for me, the third and on don't get me started.  The Day After Tomorrow got totally panned by the critics, but its one of those movies that I really enjoy for some inane reason, the characters are surprisingly likeable and the special effects are actually pretty good. What surprised me was I, Robot. I didn't really care for it at the theater, but I thought I'll just get it in the pack and can give it as a friend gift to someone later.  This is where high def can seriously help a movie.  The special effects were quite good and the sound was awesome.  I even let my self feel for the robot a bit.",1262044800,,718,4.173913043478261

8342820,5,B001U4186K,"I have always wanted The Day After Tomorrow and the Terminator on blu-ray. I already have I Robot (plan on passing the new one on). Wal-Mart has The Day After Tomorrow by itself for $29.86. I, Robot for $12.86 and The Terminator for $9.00 that is $51.72!! Just the non -blu ray set is $22.36 at Walmart and this exact box set for $39.32 so for $21.99 I had to buy it. Can't wait to get it :) I enjoy all 3 movies..",1259280000,2,414,4.0
8342821,4,B001U4186K,"First of all, I own all three of these movies on DVD so I never would have purchased them at more than the $32 they are selling for (as of Oct. 14, 2009).
The movie that gave me the most pause for thought was actually ""The Terminator."" Not because it's a bad movie, but because its picture-quality transfer has been so hammered by critics with one critic on another site saying it was no better than an upscaled DVD. Unfortunately I have to largely concur with this verdict, it may be slightly better than an upscaled DVD, but not by very much.  The movie itself is one of my favorites and has been since it was released in 1984.
I would guess that ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is somewhat of a guilty pleasure for me and although I already own the two previous DVD editions this is the first time I am purchasing it. I received the other editions in my professional position as a DVD reviewer (much like I did for ""I, Robot""). Anyhow, despite its rather preposterous plot I find the movie entertaining on a very basic level and mildly diverting with some truly likeable characters. The PQ and AQ are hardly reference quality but certainly better than for either of the DVDs.
Where this collection really shines is in regards to ""I, Robot"" The transfer on this Blu-ray is simply stunning with a high level of detail and a picture devoid of defects. Also excellent is the audio quality of the transfer which can also be summed up with the word ""stunning."" The Blu-ray also includes some fairly comprehensive special features including three commentary tracks and a handul of featurettes (with one clocking it at an hour, 16 minutes).
Overall a good buy and recommended.",1255478400,9,1664,4.583892617449664
