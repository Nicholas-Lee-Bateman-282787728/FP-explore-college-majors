8208041,4,B000BF2KGG,"Stan Webb's Chicken Shack has been around for a long time. This is their first and only DVD. I was a little disappointed with Stan's playing, I thought it was a little sloppy, maybe due to being a little drunk. The rest of the band was very good and carried Stan through the concert, other than that as a whole the concert is very good. Descent Audio and Video make up for some of the sloppy play, so if your a Chicken Shack fan it's still a fun concert to watch and isn't that the whole idea, Have some fun.

I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)

1.***
2.****
3.****

Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio or Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a BAD product. Those who would still rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get",1297036800,,1122,4.3798076923076925
