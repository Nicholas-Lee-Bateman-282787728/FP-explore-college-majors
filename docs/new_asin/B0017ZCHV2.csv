8267922,3,B0017ZCHV2,"This DVD is full of essential information, and the presenter clearly knows his topic.  BUT I would have found his instruction much more useful with more closeups to really SEE what he's doing.  Show me the fingerboard, the nut, the tools, the different kinds of bridges, etc.  He would casually mention something but not show you so you could truly see it.  It was just kind of there.  As someone just learning, that wasn't the most useful form of instruction.

It wasn't horrible.  Again, Al knows his topic.  But it just could have been better.

The menus are quite nice, but they do seem to drag on when one is viewing in sequence, as opposed to getting a refresher on a specific point.",1325894400,,689,4.536585365853658
8267923,4,B0017ZCHV2,"This dvd is very well done and is easy to follow with just the right amount of knowledge given to a novice. Since watching this video i have re fretted two guitar necks and found myself using the tech and advice from the dvd many times. Also the host really explains things well without over complicating the advice. The explaination of setup and intonation will not only give you a better idea of what makes your guitar tick it will also save you some serious coin and time instead of taking your guitar into the music store you will be able to take on everything from string buzz to nut adjustment and tremelo adjustment. Handy tips also included are measurements given in metric and imperial which help, also the tools are shown that are used in the setup and are not expensive to purchase. Overall this dvd will give you confidence to do most adjustments yourself.

must have dvd if you are serious about guitar and want to learn more about the best instrument ever invented by man!

If you are a player check this video out. I played bass on the video so I got a chance to watch the whole thing. I learned a couple of key adjustments to make and I'm playing faster as a result. Having this on DVD is cool as I can always jump to the section I use the most.",1213315200,,534,6.216216216216216

8267927,5,B0017ZCHV2,"This DVD is put together in a nice modular fashion and Markasky does a good job showing step by step procedures on how to setup a guitar.

My 35 year old guitar desperately needed setting up.  I wanted to bring it in to a professional for repair, but feared it would be too costly.  Instead, I decided to give this video a shot.  It helped me realize my problem was some of my strings were too low and explained, in layman's terms, how to fix the problem. I also was able to learn all the different components of my guitar.

I would highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to learn how to setup a fender style electric or bass.",1209513600,6,635,4.214876033057851
