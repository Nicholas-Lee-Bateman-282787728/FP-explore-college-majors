7905974,3,B00000EZRN,"I did not know when I ordered this VCR tape that the subtitles were in French.  Despite having minored in French in college, I would not have purchased it.  That said, having seen the opera many times on video (with English subtitles) and read the libretto several times, I was able to keep up with the French subtitles pretty well.  Nevertheless, it was rather a lot of work as my eyes spent too much time glued to reading when I could have been watching what was going on on stage.
  The video is pretty bad, worse than you might think.  You would have thought this was shot in 1940 rather than 1980.  The stage is very dark and the characters are often shot from a great distance.  The so-called ""color"" is really about 90% black and white and 10% washed out color.  Forget about skin tone.
  As for the singing, it is first rate.  Despite this opera's being sung towards the end of her prime, Caballe is in excellent voice and won't disappoint.  Carreras and Pons are both young here and sing wonderfully.  If you can disregard the poor quality video and the French subtitles, it is worth watching.",1310342400,,1102,4.472361809045226
