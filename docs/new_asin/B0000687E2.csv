7963734,5,B0000687E2,Very informative. Interesting biographical facts and insight to Dada Max. I have been to Sedona many times and really appreciate the part of this film that shows his life there. I even recognize people Inknow in the Sedona chapter. Buy it if you can.,1524700800,,250,4.704545454545454
7963735,4,B0000687E2,"Out of print for years, I waited four years to find a reasonably priced copy ($24 - it usually sells used on Amazon for $100 or more.  YIKES) .  It's wonderful to hear Ernst speaking, relating bits of his story.  The travelogue bits sort of go on with what I assume is stock footage, but it illustrates the storyline.  Major parts of Max's life are glossed over - his tenuous relationship with his father, his three-way love affair with Paul Eluard and Gala (later to become Dali's wife), his crazed, passionate relationship with Leonora Carrington is barely mentioned and the Peggy Guggenheim period, though approached, is certainly umm...prettied up by what is obviously a labor of love.  Max was a womanizer and that's part of the fascination one feels as you dig deeply into his life.  There's not much out there for Max Ernst on video and this could have easily been twice as long as far as I'm concerned.  Still, a must have for Max fans and students of 20th century art.",1437436800,,977,4.61271676300578
7963736,5,B0000687E2,"Yes, the Max Ernst DVD is filled with bio information. beautiful filmed scenic photography and a lot of his fascinating art.",1406592000,,124,4.9523809523809526
7963737,5,B0000687E2,"This movie is wunderbar and I watch it over and over. Max Ernst was so amazing and so is this film. The footage is ridiculous, and they have Ernst talk while they show actual film of  where he lived or what he experienced. The cinematography is beautiful, the research is awesome-brilliant. Its so great and they show you paintings you can't find even at the library when you are writing a huge paper about Ernst. If you want to understand his paintings, watch this movie and you will see the best example of painting explanation I have ever seen. If only college were this good!!!!
""Who made world history? Not the most reasonable people, the madmen. So if painting is the mirror of a time, it must be mad to have the true image of what a time is."" MaxErnst",1197504000,,758,4.414285714285715
7963738,4,B0000687E2,"This excellent documentary of the great German artist has mostly footage of him speaking about his own work, which is for me the very best way to help me understand any artist's work.  His remarks as well as the accompanying biographical information are excellently done.  The only reason I give it only 4 stars is that he's not one of my favorite artists.",1106179200,6,356,4.634920634920635
7963739,5,B0000687E2,"This well-made documentary on the great Dada / Surrealist Max Ernst is a must for fans of those movements. This superb artist all to often goes unnoticed by our current mainstream culture, which seems too obsessed with Dali and Duchamp. Sure those two were important, but Max Ernst was probably just as significant in the development of modern art. The DVD quality is very good, and the movie itself is simply terrific. It follows the life and career of DadaMax, with footage of him speaking, and in a Bunuel movie. 5 out of 5.",1062720000,14,527,4.617021276595745
