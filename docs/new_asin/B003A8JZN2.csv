8392900,1,B003A8JZN2,I am a huge Cormac McCarthy fan and couldn't find anything in the movie that remotely resembled McCarthy's magnificent range of literary genius.  The characters were not brought to life in the way they are in McCarthy's novels....(of course it wasn't his book - only his screen play - but I was waiting for any of his takes on human nature to appear - they never did.)  Maybe it was the acting.  It was pretty bad and not convincing - especially by the main character.  I watched the whole thing waiting for something to happen to redeem the thing....it never did.,1380499200,,564,4.554455445544554
8392901,3,B003A8JZN2,"As a fan of McCarthy, I have to say that this film doesn't do his screenplay justice. For a low-budget, public television film, it's probably very good. But since the producer and director spent so much time with the writer, I had hoped he, Richard Pearce, had put McCarthy's vision on the screen. To be fair, he did well. But not good enough. The deletion of critical dialogue and the alteration of scenes disappointed me. The end scene, particularly should have stayed closer to McCarthy's script. The whittler, if you read the screenplay, totally makes the whole thing work, but we see him for just a second. It's the old man seen after the hanging if you haven't read the screenplay. Mrs. Gregg's digging up her husband's grave? Should that have really been cut?

Okay. The casting is good and the acting is very good. Brad Dourif makes a good Bobby and I didn't think he would. Kevin Conway is excellent. His performance is close to best among the players as James Gregg. Anne O'Sullivan steals the show. Her Martha is more than right on, she looks the part and plays her part so well. Pearce never should have put make up on her. Ned Beatty as always does his job. The parts of the lawyers, which are so essential to the feeling of the screenplay, are trivialized. Not those actors fault.

Trouble will make folks look for places where they saw better times.

If you love McCarthy's dialogue, you'll love to here them try it. Ultimately, a decent attempt. If you are looking for a film and have never read his novels, then let me suggest >> Blood Meridian <<. If you go there, you're not coming back.",1338595200,,1606,4.550173010380623

8392904,5,B003A8JZN2,"I have been collecting Brad Dourif Films for Eight years now and I have been searching for this film in that same length of time,I am absolutely thrilled that this seller has decided to sell it here on amazon.
The seller seems to put a lot of time and effort into it's products and really cares about the buyer.
""The Gardener's Son"" is in a nice DvD Box with a wonderful photo that is also depicted on the the disctop with a fancy gloss finish,the discface is absolutely spotless.
The Film itself is very clear and crisp-same goes for the sound-and is in a 4:3 format which works on every sceen i've played it on,including LCD and HDTv.
I haven't seen Brad Dourif act quite like this in all my time and "" The Garderner's Son"" has taken it's place amongst my favorites. I hope it does so with everyone else who buys it.",1288828800,4,818,4.318181818181818
