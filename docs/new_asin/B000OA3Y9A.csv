2793085,5,B000OA3Y9A,This is a great DVD. It shows in depth the many interesting things to do in each country. The videography is outstanding and places that are visited are just beautiful. The only downside is the two hosts that go on this journey. They lack any real excitement and are a bore to watch. Luckily they don't distract from the scenery that surrounds them.,1216857600,12,349,4.555555555555555
2793086,1,B000OA3Y9A,"Just saw then visiting an ""Isolated Amazon Tribe"". As a brazilian I can assure you the hole thing is a hoax, false. Those ""indians"" have an urban life on a nearby city, they speak portuguese, drive cars and send their children to school as everybody else, etc.. and they were depicted as an ""isolated tribe"". Typical tourist trap. Shame.",1279324800,,337,4.728813559322034
2793087,4,B000OA3Y9A,"I love watching this series.  I think Albin and Melanie are great and allow you to feel like you are experiencing everything with them.  They are also seeing everything for the first time, so hearing ""Wow"" and ""Awesome"" are expected!!  My favorite episode is their trip to Alaska.",1269129600,2,280,4.791666666666667
2793088,5,B000OA3Y9A,It is a darn shame the company that made this DVD is out of business and now very difficult to find - it is FABULOUS wallpaper for the widescreen TV to be running in the background while you are doing other things!  Someone (the author) should make some kind of deal with another DVD Producer (Image Entertainment) to keep providing this.,1252713600,,338,4.540983606557377
2793089,1,B000OA3Y9A,"I think this DVD could have been done in a more mature manner.  The couple kept saying, ""wow"" instead of describing what they saw or did...",1244419200,19,139,4.346153846153846
2793090,2,B000OA3Y9A,"I would have to agree with a previous poster that the hosts ruin this collection for me.  However, I cannot give it one star because the concept is great and seeing the book brought to life is wonderful.  That being said, Melanie and her husband come across as being criminally stupid and, more often than not, my wife and I felt embarrassed that the editor allowed their inane remarks and questions to remain in the final product.
I found it best to listen to the indigenous peoples when interviewed and to mute when the esteemed ""hosts"" start to speak.",1244073600,4,554,4.585858585858586
2793091,4,B000OA3Y9A,"I watched this show when it was on TV and am probably going to buy it for Christmas for my parents. I loved it! It was a great introduction to some beautiful sites around the world and I can't wait to share it with my family. It will be a great way to expand the world of my younger siblings who have not traveled more than a couple states away from their home.

The others who posted about the hosts being boring or ill informed must be hard core international travelers or possibly even just hard core Travel Channel watchers to have been so horribly disappointed. I felt another opinion had to be added here to balance them out.

There is a narrator and there is the couple who won this opportunity. THEY ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL HOSTS and nothing was scripted for them. I thought the narrator did a great job with the more technical travel information and I thought the couple reacted to the experiences similar to how I would have in their situation. They seemed to make an effort to be respectful of everyone involved in their tours and often seemed like they endeared themselves to their guides with their enthusiasm (although this could have been fostered by the camera crews and influx of money and publicity the show would bring).

Their actions probably fit the uncultured American stereotype but I can't see how they could have had enough preparation time for every location with the whirlwind tour to satisfy the critical reviewers out here. If I ever scraped up the money to visit even one of these locations I would plan for 6 mo to a year and certainly would not be able to travel in the extravagance they had. But that is what makes it more fun to watch! Even with all the planning and research I am sure I would have plenty of American tourist stereotype moments like asking ""who is their most dangerous predator"" about a pack of elephants. Of course its humans, but you try to think of something witty to talk about at location after location.

The Discovery Channel could have planned in some preparation time for each location and even provided some study materials to the couple, and I guess based on the negative responses I would suggest they do that if they have another season of this.",1228089600,11,2207,4.551637279596977
2793092,3,B000OA3Y9A,"This series is a little bit awkward in its attempt to show you new places through the eyes of two new travellers. The hosts are what they are, inexperienced tourists who don't offer great insight but rather two average characters to follow on their travels and to see a little bit of how travelling might affect the inexperienced. As an enxperienced traveller I didn't find their insights interesting. It is really a very basic traveller's series targetting those with little or no previous knowledge. In this respect it's enjoyable and offers some ideas about where to go, what to eat, where to stay and what to do. For a serious traveller it unfortunately falls short. The only other draw back is the focus on expensive life styles and places to stay. At times it can be a little boring as these high class places do not appear to be as interesting as the real tourist attractions or real life on the streets that are also presented. I prefered episodes that were not set in wealthy countries as they seemed to delve more into things that as a traveller I might be more likely to do. The episode on France was particularly boring, which is unfortunate, as it's the number one tourist destination in the world. The episode on Brazil on the other had was actually enjoyable, presenting me with some good ideas for a holiday in the Amazon or Rio. Visually this program is lovely. It isn't the greatest thing I've ever seen, but it offers some nice images and scenes.

Overall, this is a good program for those with little or no experience, for those interested in not getting off the beaten track too much (or even staying in high end places) and for those who don't really watch travel programs too much and might enjoy watching some new travellers discover the world. For anyone who has been around a bit I would give this one a miss.",1226793600,3,1835,4.577507598784194
2793093,4,B000OA3Y9A,"At the beginning of each show, Melanie says she has been asked, ""How can you afford to put your life on hold (to travel around the world)?"" and she responds, ""How can you afford not to?""  Well, let's see, traveling is very expensive, and a lot of people can't afford to travel around the world.  Also, some people have very severe health problems and are not even able to perform normal daily tasks.  If the viewer can ignore her comment, the dvd set is actually a pretty good value.  She and Al ARE on their honeymoon.  They make no claim to be professional travelers.  That said, I think they are fine enough ""hosts.""  Go ahead and blow the $9.99 for this set.  You probably won't find a cheaper vacation anywhere!  As far as the content, Al and Mel go to many fascinating places and are not afraid to try adventurous and daring activities.",1222560000,,842,4.450980392156863
2793094,1,B000OA3Y9A,"I can not agree more with the previous 1 star review.  They have to be the worst travel hosts I have ever seen.  They are the stereo-typical ignorant, annoying American tourists.  As an American living overseas for 10+ years I could not even manage to watch this program and couldn't decide if I was more embarrassed or annoyed. I am really surprised that they were chosen to host this program as they clearly have never traveled further than the strip mall at the end of their block.

Do yourself a favor and do not buy this DVD...read the book or buy other DVD's mentioned below.  Another great series is the BBC Earth series which is amazing.",1220227200,9,645,4.525862068965517
2793095,1,B000OA3Y9A,"Hi Folks,

The book is well worth the read and the series would have been worth your time as well... but...  the problem is that they chose the worst possible people to view these places through the eyes of and it ruins the experience.  These are perhaps the worst hosts ever for a travel series.  They aren't appreciative of the journey and don't ask interesting questions or add anything of value to the show on any level.  In fact, I'd buy this if they had a version that simply eliminated their words and ever showing their face and just included the raw footage of the places.  It's really that bad.  With a world of enthusiastic (and educated) tourists or guides to choose from who would have viewed this as the opportunity of a life time and demonstrated some respect for the places they were going by perhaps learning anything about them in advance to prepare themselves to show the world, why they chose these two mopes is beyond me.  I found myself (and my wife as well) getting angry at the show each time we watched because these people were ruining it all.  Save yourself the annoyance and buy other travel DVD's from the same places and you'll be much happier.  Rick Steves has a wonderful box set of Europe where he educates and moves you over each place he sees.  He has respect for both the places and the viewer.  Samantha Brown, who is very different, also has some nice episodes.  Rudy Maxa, who does his show on PBS is another wonderful option.  Frankly, ANYTHING is better than this.  (Heck, stare at some postcards and you'll get more out of it without the frustration).  I also suggest going to Google Earth and looking at all the amazing photos that users have posted all around the world.  There's so many better ways to experience the world, even if you can't travel there yourself.  Don't waste the excitement of these fantastic's places on these unappreciative, misinformed and ignorant self absorbed people.  Yuck.

8184128,1,B000OA3Y9A,"I've heard the book is great, but you won't find anything appealing in here. I agree with all of the other reviews, I just wanted to throw one more in the ring to drag down the average, and emphasize that without the daffy couple, it would still be bad. Everything here is reported with the breathless inanity of someone describing the features on a cruise ship to you. You won't hear anything of history, but you'll hear plenty about the helicopter tour and five-star hotel. If your hoi-polloi aunt with money to burn wants to see the beautiful sites through a variety of motorized vehicles as a change of pace from her normal Atlantic City trip, without actually doing or learning anything, lend her this and tell her to have at it. The only thing she'll be missing is pointers on where to find the nearest Hard Rock Cafe. Those that actually go on vacation for novelty, skip this one.",1401580800,,887,4.55

8184130,2,B000OA3Y9A,"The chosen couple are typical Americans - riding every motorized device in every country they go to, knowing absolutely nothing about the history, culture or even geography of the destinations. I guess they are ""average"" Americans who need constant base entertainment without too much learning. They are inarticulate at best, and embarrassing at worst; could more educated people not be found? They're cute and dumb, which will sell well in the U.S. Worst of all is that the producers/directors never bothered to do any fact checking. The France segment highlights a village that was ""15th-century Roman;"" this misinformation is repeated twice. The Alaska segment mispronounces Kenai, and mispronounces and misspells Chugach. Would it be that difficult to have someone who is knowledgeable, or even with moderate formal education, check the final production before release?

Too bad because the actual footage is terrific, which for me warrants two stars. But the negatives outweigh the positives. If you want pretty pictures, this is great; if you want to really learn or explore, you might just have to go there yourself.",1332115200,,1123,5.308988764044944

8184132,1,B000OA3Y9A,"This had potential to be quite a great series, but they REALLY screwed it up by putting in those hosts!  Where did they get these people that ""put their lives on hold for 14 weeks"".  Who wouldn't put their lives on hold??  And it's not putting your life on hold, it's expanding your life!

The hosts are unappreciative bubble boy, American flag tshirt wearing, F150 truck driving, Walmart shopping, suburb couple that are extremely uneducated and I can't emphasize MORE how UNAPPRECIATIVE they are.  Profoundly can not stand that couple!

They anger me.
