8073161,3,B000A2XB3Q,Love this old clean classic comedy that takes me back to my child hood days. My only regret is that they include Winston cigarette commercials from back in that day. Which I think have the potential to influence impressionable young kids. If it weren't for that I would have definately given this 5 stars.,1456185600,,305,4.666666666666667
