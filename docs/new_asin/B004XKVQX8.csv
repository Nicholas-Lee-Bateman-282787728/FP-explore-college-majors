4496418,5,B004XKVQX8,"Ok first id like to point out im rather dissapointed that the box sets for naruto shippuden are getting smaller and smaller, i mean, if they subtract one more episode it'd be the same as an individual volume! But they sure aren't coming down in price! If i wasn't such a fan i wouldve refrained from purchasing such an overpriced deal!

  Now all that aside this was an excellent set of episodes! The fight between Asuma and Hidan is pretty epic! Im much further ahead in the series because i watch it when it comes out in the original japanese and i have to say
The fights featuring the Akatsuki get more and more epic!

  Naruto shippuden is my all time favorite anime series and it truly gets more and more epic! This set features hardly any filler and lots and lots of action! It features alot of asuma and shikamaru in this set with hidan and kakuzu (sp.?).

  All in all its a must have for any Naruto shippuden fan",1315180800,3,921,4.3391812865497075

4496420,3,B004XKVQX8,"I wish I had waited for another box set to come out.  While Naruto is a great Japanese Anime, of all the other Uncut sets Viz Media did, each CD was too short!  They leave you on a cliff hanger instead of working into the next part unlike they did in the previous Set.  I honestly felt cheated out of my money with the short time.

 On the good side, two members of the Ikaski clan conclusion turns out to be interesting.

The price should have been a bit lower due to less time.",1312675200,,479,4.042553191489362
4496421,5,B004XKVQX8,The whole family will get together and watch this. We love the animation and story line. Can't wait for the next one.,1312416000,,117,4.363636363636363
4496422,5,B004XKVQX8,"I'm over sixty, my sons are eleven and we have all been Naruto fans since they were old enough to watch television. We have all the DVDs and all the illustrated books (which you have to read backwards) and we still want more.",1311379200,2,225,4.255813953488372
4496423,4,B004XKVQX8,"For a person who has watched the series since episode one, I found that I really enjoyed this arc. This set inculdes 11 episodes, which is a little disappointing since their is normally 12-13 episodes, and no significant extras. The extras are a very scarce compared to the first four box sets and I don't really feel that the omakes themselves should have been considered an extra when they're already attached to the episodes. Their are also some production sketches, the English credits, some storyboards, and some advertisments for other VIZ products. The acting on both the English and the original Japanese tracks are well done, so if you enjoy one over the other you'll enjoy it, and both are included on the disc despite Amazons description saying their is only the Japanese voices. Subtitles are also included for the Japanese track. The only Problem I can honestly say I had with the box set is the case and the amount of episodes. To me, and I have felt this way for box sets 5 and 6 as well, I feel cramming 3 discs into a normal sized DVD case dosen't really work. It saves space,yes, but because the prongs are so short on the insert for discs 1 and 2 I'm afraid their going to break. As for the amount of episodes, which I'm sure many people are disappointed with, they're lacking. Normally their is at least twelve, but I've seen VIZ cutting down on the episodes on a lot of their anime box sets (for example Bleach). I also felt that they really could have added the extra few episodes to have better closure for this arc and to help transition to the next one. Overall I must say I was satisfied with my purchase and felt the price was decent, not overly pricey, and about what I would pay for it.",1310428800,8,1715,4.464968152866242
4496424,5,B004XKVQX8,"First things first. This boxset only contains 11 episodes,these are ep77to88. But there is no need for concern as this boxset is the greatest set of episodes so far. The first episode starts with a bang as Hidans terrifying powers are revealed and shikimaru tries desperatly to stop Hidan from killing everyone in his squad. There is a shocking and crucial event in the early episodes that shapes up for a truly epic battle in this boxset. NOW for those people who are wondering why there are only 11 episodes in this set i will explain my thoughts. Episodes 72 to 89 are original material from the manga episodes 90 to 111 are filler mixed with some original material. In my opinion viz media know some people do not buy filler arc and so release one original episode (89) with the next box set of filler. True fans do not want to miss an episode in their collection and therefore will buy the next boxset. Getting back to my original review this boxset is ESSENTIAL as there are so many amazing moments in this set. Shikimaru team 10 and Kakashi fans will be delighted with this set. Id love to say more but i don't want to spoil anything. IN SHORT THIS SET HAS MY FAVOURITE AKATSKI MEMBERS IN LOADS OF FIGHTS,EPIC AND SAD MOMENTS,BRILLIANT FIGHT SCENES AND A SUPERB BUT DARK ENDING.",1304467200,24,1285,4.51931330472103
4496425,4,B004XKVQX8,"At least one reviewer complained that this box set was too short at 11 episodes, but in this case 11 episodes is enough because it reaches the end of a major storyline in Naruto Shippuden.  This set begins with Asuma, the earthy teacher of Team 10, losing his fight to an enemy ninja (I forget his name, but he has six hearts and is therefore very hard to kill).  Ino, my favorite hottie kunouichi, has followed in Sakura's footsteps and become a medical ninja, and tries to heal Asuma but she isn't quite as good as Sakura in this respect and Asuma finally says farewell to his students and passes away.  A series of very touching scenes follow as Asuma's students weep over his body (Shikamaru and Choji more silently than Ino) and reminisce good times with him.  Choji runs away to the wilderness for awhile to mourn by himself but Shikamaru brings him back to the village again.  After Team 10 visits Asuma's grave to put flowers on it, they demand Tsunade that they be allowed to avenge Asuma.  Tsunade refuses to let them go out without an experienced jonin to lead them, but just then Kakashi, recently released from the hospital, volunteers to lead Team 10 on their mission of vengeance.  Naruto comes along as well because Asuma had also been his teacher in wind based jutsus for a short time.  By the last episode of this set, Team 10's goal is complete and Asuma's assailant lies dead.  Shikamaru does the bulk of the fighting, so it's only fitting that he is pictured on the package cover.

And then there's the matter of Kurenai carrying Asuma's child, but that will be dealt with in future episodes.",1304208000,12,1613,4.569444444444445
4496426,4,B004XKVQX8,"First off, Im a huge fan of the naruto shippuden episodes. I collect all the box sets. But what is Viz Media doing with these box sets. The episodes are great but the quality of the box sets keeps getting worse and worse. First they completely change them, and now the new box sets don't even have the names of the episodes that are on the cds, and worst of all. They originally started with 13 eps per box set, which was great. But then they went down to 12 eps, and now its down to 11 eps in the new 7th box set. Pretty soon it won't even be considered a box set if they keep cutting down the eps like that. Anyway, Im sure the box set is gona be great, but Im very dissapointed with only 11 episodes. Thats one short box set if you even wana call it that.",1303948800,40,758,3.9607843137254903

It came to me damaged but amazon did a very good job sending me a new one. The best I've ever seen in a few days I got another one!",1375747200,,263,3.6785714285714284
4496481,5,B004XKVQX8,"Great story. I love when anime progress stories like this. The original naruto series was well written. Each character was interesting. Alot of touching moments. Especially naruto,always trying to inspire an help. This continues in Shippuden. EXcept,the characters aged a few years. Which is what I meant by progression. Im not going to explain what each set is about. Just know this series is addictive. So if you get the chance,buy alot or all sets at once. I got all 15 on sale almost half off. 20ish$$$ a set. Im a little disappointed in the length of time it took to ship from Amazon LLC.5 business days just to be shipped. But arrived shortly after. The sets are kinda a ripoff considering each set is 11-13 episodes. But on sale it was a must buy. For 330$ I got 15 sets instead of paying
660$.I love this show and will keep buying. Set 16 is due to release in october 2013.

Anyway, Amazon should have informed that the box set wasn't for my region!!! I did inform them of my location, so it wouldnt be very difficult to tell me I couldtnt use the discs!",1350345600,,519,4.232323232323233

This box set to me has been the most boring of them all. It's all about this fight between shikamaru and 2 akatsuki memebers. That I don't mind. What I don't like is that it has taken a whole box set to deal with this. The fight isn't even that interesting.

4496491,1,B004XKVQX8,"I was pretty upset when they changed the quality of the box sets with the 5th set.  I was disappointed when the 6th set only had 12 episodes.  I was stunned that this box set only has 11 episodes.  I bought it anyway, and when it arrives in the mail there isn't even a GD slip cover to make it *almost* look like a real box set.  To make this problem worse, they decided to use that crazy super blue to hold the plastic onto the spine of the set, so it looks like complete crap on my shelf.

I'm tired of giving Viz my money and having them spit in my face.  I've already stopped collecting Bleach because of the horrible way they've handled those releases.  I kept trying to collect this set because my wife likes them and refuses to watch subtitles on my computer.  After this set, I might just tell her to deal with it.  I've had enough.  It's time Viz went the way of the dodo like all the other anime companies that have treated their customers like this.  The ONLY reason they're making ANY money with policies like this is because Naruto and Bleach were already hugely popular before they ever got their hands on them.  I'm not sure their huge popularity can save them forever though if they continue spitting on their customers like this.",1328745600,,1246,4.323275862068965

The animation for these episodes is really well done, especially the sequences of fighting amongst the trees (first Kakashi and Hidan and later Kakuzu). This is the only set I had to buy used as that was all that was available. It seems all other sets can be obtained brand new. That indicates to me that this was a really popular set.
