The film begins outside of Louies Sweet Shoppe. Louie sings a song [for comedy], A man rides up on a horse. Sheriff Luke Barlow is searching for Louie the Lout, dead or alive. So Louie explains what happened 20 years ago; he was blamed for a murder he didn't do. Louie saved the map to the gold mine. The Bowery Boys decide to go West to get the gold, and find Petes daughter. Are the days of the Wild West gone? [Not for Hollywood.] Some Indians greet them in an unusual manner. Do you want your arrows back? The Indian Chief warns them against Hangmans Hollow, a dangerous place.

Did someone talk too much? Black Jack gets a warning and sets an ambush. Shots are fired, real bullets. Marshall K. T. Barlow halts the shooting. One of the boys is kidnapped for the map on his back. So the others go to rescue him. They seek help, and find someone (a coincidence). There are comic scenes. Slip enters and fire shots, nobody looks at him. There is a card trick to impress the crowd. [All those shots must keep the carpenters busy.] Katherine Briggs sings a song to entertain the audience. Black Jack plots to find the map during a dance. But Slip kidnaps Black Jack, and the chase begins. Will they use threats to get a confession? [Is that funny?] Louie is exonerated by Black Jacks confession. So what will happen next? The ending redeems the story.

This is a low budget production to provide popular entertainment for those who go to a movie every weekend. Malapropisms aren't that funny. TV will soon put an end to these films.",1231372800,,1560,4.485915492957746

7824854,5,6302328039,"The Bowery Boys go hunt for a lost treasure in Texas with the help of a map tattooed on the back of a sweet-shop owner, whom, they hang around on the Bowery named ""Louie"".  When they travel to Texas to free  Louie, a fugitive from justice, (of which he was wrongfully accused)  they  find out information with the help of a undercover friend (Gabe).  On  their way there, they tattoo the tattoo on the back of a dim-witted  character name Sach, who gets kidnapped by being bribed with a slingshot.  He then walks through water and washes off the map which he maintained.  With lots of funny wise-cracks and slapstick, and the gang getting into  trouble they find the real murderer and through torture they make him  confess.  Louie is brought to Texas by a Marshal of the town (Hangman's  Hallow) and Sach captures the rest of the bad guys gang.  Then, it turns  out that Sach was just dreaming the entire movie.
