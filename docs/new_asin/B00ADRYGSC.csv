5409733,5,B00ADRYGSC,"After waiting 14 years Warner Brothers has finally started releasing the Bowery Boys films. It is said that they will release each volume quarterly, and priced at about fifty dollars each. They films are not in order of release, so you get a fair sampling of titles from different periods.

These films look great, although they are not from 35mm prints (16mm prints seem to have been used) they are crisp and clear throughout. These are not the same prints shown on TCM some years ago that looked awful. Warner Brothers did not use DVNR, thank God, so you get an exact transfer from the original film elements. The dics hold three titles each so they are not over compressed, and BIG SURPRISE these are NOT DVD-R they are commercially pressed DVDs!

So, sit back and enjoy the Bowery Boys complete and uncut. Thank you Warner Brothers!",1354924800,39,836,4.680272108843537
5409734,5,B00ADRYGSC,"Wow! I thought this DVD Set would never arrive, but after a long delay I must say that VOLUME ONE was worth the wait! Warner Brothers had been wanting to release all 48 films in this series for many years, but they kept waiting to find the best materials they could so each movie could look its best.

Here are 12 films in what is said to be the first volume of a 4-volume release. Because WB wanted to hold off on certain titles until they could find the best possible elements, VOLUME ONE is not in strict chronological film order; there are some movies missing which will likely come on future sets.

I have owned weak copies of all 48 films from other sources before, from broadcast recordings on TV. However, this DVD set boasts the best these particular films have ever looked, and probably ever will look. It must be remembered that these movies were cheaply made by Monogram Studios, and never were as sterling as your typical ""A"" product. Even with the occasional speck or line, this set remains the best presentation you're ever likely to see on Slip, Sach, Louie, and the Gang.

You've made me one very happy customer, Warner - Thanks, and I cannot wait for VOLUME 2 !",1354838400,84,1179,4.474418604651163

5409801,5,B00ADRYGSC,"Great quality! Leo Gorcey has never been acknowledged as being a great comic. There is a scene in ""Live Wires"" where Leo is in a room with a very big, very muscular, friendly gangster. Every effort by Leo to escape is met with the gangster throwing him into the sofa, across the room, over the bar and under it. Leo's punch drunk, disoriented actions are one of the most hilarious scenes in movie comedy. He should be ranked with W.C. Fields and Stan Laurel. Except for the fact that he never got out of the B movie Monogram pictures. The plots of each movie were sooo tediously repetitive that it is fortunate that anybody has a fond memory of these movies.
I believe that the cheap, artistically deadening hand of producer Stan Katzman was involved with most of these productions. Amazing that there is any lasting value with these movies considering that fact.",1416700800,,863,4.647058823529412

5409807,5,B00ADRYGSC,"I was torn as to whether to give this review four or five stars, since I've waited for these movies to go on DVD soooo long and they're finally out I went on and put five stars. That's how glad I am to finally own these! I am, however, quite disappointed with 'da fact dat' there are no interviews, no commentaries, no bonus features. There's no chapter selection, no 'play all' functionality and most of all no fun animated menu with music like you get on lots of other recent DVD releases of classic productions. The DVDs are nicely styled, but they came in the kind of flimsy case you'd expect the Boys to sell off in one of their shams. The discs keep falling out of place because the inner holders are defective / chipped in the set I got.

BUT. The quality of the remastering is GREAT. I am watching these 30 to 40 years after I first saw and fell in love with the Boys as a child, with the aid of Leonard Getz's fantastic compendium From Broadway to the Bowery, and I'm learning a lot. I notice this volume does not include some of the first Bowery Boys era films, I plan to order the other volumes and see what pops up in those.

It breaks my heart that the biggest stars in these have died, but the fact that the original playwright of Dead End, Sidney Kingsley, lived long enough to see his original production brought back to relevance on a stage in 1978. The 2005 production was the 70th anniversary. I'm hoping 2015 will bring it back for the 80th, we the fans know the deep import of the message that is more relevant than ever in America today. The movies, from that first film Dead End through the Bowery Boys, are of great historical and cultural significance. Plus there are some of the funniest moments in human history in these.

My recommendation: even though these DVDs are the bare minimum with no extras, they are a great investment, along with Getz's compendium and the biography on Leo Gorcey written by his son, entitled Me and the Dead End Kid. See these films again now with the knowledge of the difficult, often miserable lives these child-turned-adult stars lived. This makes their incredible talents and efforts all the more precious and entertaining.",1411516800,2,2183,4.493702770780857
5409808,5,B00ADRYGSC,"Yup the gang is all here-Slip, Sach, White, Dave, Chuck and the gang. When I was a teenager, my brother and used to watch the Bowery Boys and laugh at their antics.

These are just great fun!",1410652800,,340,4.412698412698413

5409810,4,B00ADRYGSC,"The Bowery Boys are FINALLY back,and boy have they been gone a long time. I haven't seen them since the 60s on TV.Warners has decided to release all 48 movies. However in their infinite ""wisdom""(no one can say they are smart!),they have decided to release them willy nilly. That is,each set's movies are in order,date wise,but there are major gaps in each. And I am less than thrilled by their condition. The second film Fast Company contains a major vertical scratch that appears and doesn't go away for between 5-8 minutes. The rest all have artifacts and defects of some kind to a greater or lesser degree,and Warner's seems to have done very little at all to clean them up. I am getting used to this though. Warner's on-demand releases have all been like this;minimal clean up,less than stellar pictures(some downright poor)and they charge a good buck.
This sets starts with their first film Live Wires(released Jan/46) and ends with No Holds Barred(Nov/52).Each set's ending films get progressively later in date. Despite the set's failings it is great to see Sach(Huntz Hall) and Slip(Leo Gorcy)back in action once more. They are joined in various films by Billy Halop,David Gorcey,Brenard Gorcey,Gabriel Dell,Bobby Jordan,Billy Benedict and others. The latter plays Whitey and he is in the earlier films. I wish they had kept him around as he was one of my faves. He and Sach played off of each other well and were constantly trying to out-Stan Laurel themselves.
Leo Gorcy who plays Slip is the ""boss"" of the outfit,and he was Huntz's Oliver Hardy. He thought he was superior but when it came right down to it,both were as dumb and child like as the other. In fact they are referred to as children in some movies. And those malaprops by Slip....woweee. Gorcey was constantly letting fly malaprops left,right and center. When Sach later would start to correct Slip on a word, he'd come back with something to the effect he was speaking in the past tense. Hilarious stuff. It is also neat to see the character development/progression of the two stars as the movies wore on. Slip loses a bit of his edge and Sach gives more with the wisecracks and becomes more expressive.
The movies are for the most part in full screen,but the films from the earlier 50s onwards are all in w/s format,which I had never seen before this.
This was the longest running series of its kind and it is great to see them back again. These are films a family can watch together. And while I'm less than enthralled with the prints,the movies themselves are just fantastic. Highly recommended.",1400803200,2,2572,4.795045045045045

""In Fast Company"" - Red Circle Cabs unscrupulously eliminates its competition;  the boys help a small-time cab operator.

""Bowery Bombshell"" - A roving photographer snaps Sach's picture - he's outside the bank holding a bag of stolen money!

""News Hounds"" - Slip writes a newspaper article on the sports fixing racket;  now all he needs are the facts!

""Fighting Fools"" - The boys sponsor a down-and-out fighter make a comeback to avenge his brother's death in the ring.

""Hold that Baby!"" - The boys find a baby in a laundry basket;  unbeknownst to them, the baby is the heir to a fortune.

""Master Minds"" - Sach's toothache allows him to foresee the future;  unfortunately a mad scientist wants to tap his brain.

""Blonde Dynamite"" - While Louie and his wife are on vacation, the boys turn his sweet shop into an escort bureau!

""Lucky Losers"" - The boys learn the tricks of crooked gamblers so that they can go undercover at the Top Hat Club.

""Blues Brothers"" - After Sach has his tonsils out, he croons like Bing Crosby.

""Crazy Over Horses"" - Rancher pays off his debt to Louie by giving him a horse;  unfortunately the bad guys want it.

""No Holds Barred"" - Inexplicably, various parts of Sach's body become like iron, allowing him to win wrestling matches.

A few years ago I spent a small fortune on a 'bootleg' set which contained all 48 movies.  This set was unsatisfactory with grainy images. poor sound and other issues which plague bootlegs.
It was better than nothing, however.
Until this set was released.
What a pleasure to receive this set!  Not being a technical person, all I can say is that I am more than pleased with Vol 1 and glad I ordered Vol 2 well.  These releases brought forth a feeling of pure pleasure.  To see Louie's Sweet Shop, enjoy the antics of the characters and hear snippets of late 1940s music is indeed a trip down memory lane.
The version I received is the pressed one and it is well worth the price of admission.
Am eagerly awaiting release of the remaining 24 films and will order them as soon as they become available.

Simple, just look at the non label side. If it's a pinkish purple it's DVD-R. But that's not the reason I gave it 4 stars. The reason is because the chronological order of the films is hampered because some of the films will be released on later sets.

Remaining movies on the disc were fine.  Disc Two was a challenge.  NEWS HOUNDS successfully played for about 45 min. then suddenly the picture froze for ten seconds and we were bounced back to the menu screen.  Tried again in our Sony device: fast forwarded to the same spot.  Frozen and bounced again.  Placed the disc in our Sony DVD-VCR Player/Recorder device.  No dice.  The caveat about not playing in a recording device in on the money.  Last resort: put the disc in our Insignia DVD-TV combo.  Played without a hitch.  Huh?  [This has happened with other collections, i.e. Stargate SG1, where one disc would never play, no way, no how, with no recourse from Amazon or the original scurvy vendor. In other situations with large collections, we found that by the time we actually get around to a defective disc, it was too late to return it.]  Fortunately, regarding Bowery Boys: the next movie, FIGHTING FOOLS, played without incident on the original Sony device.

5409881,5,B00ADRYGSC,"I bought this item as a gift and had it mailed to my brother.  He was very pleased with the product itself and is looking forward to volume 2.

HOWEVER, I am very concerned about the way the address was written!!!

It was addressed using his name and after his name is said:  ""OR CURRENT RESIDENT""!!!

This is very disturbing as it could cause me a myriad of problems if it was delivered to incorrect address and left in wrong apartment or wrong mailbox by post office, ups etc.

I would be billed as my account  would indicate it was ""sent and received"" when in fact it was not since it was addressed to ""OR CURRENT RESIDENT"" SO IT WOULD BE LEFT EVEN IF NAME I WANTED IT SENT TO WAS NOT ON THE MAILBOX.

For this reason I will be hesitant to order from this company again.",1359936000,2,773,4.175675675675675
5409892,5,B00ADRYGSC,"Great picture quality. Having been a fan of the Bowery Boys since I was old enough to turn on a TV, this set gives me all the Bowery a girl could ask for.

5409893,5,B00ADRYGSC,"My husband has a nostalgic ""thing"" for the Bowery Boys. He watched these really old movies on Saturday mornings as he grew up. He asked for this DVD for Christmas and his face lit up like a child's when he saw it. The great thing is that all the movies have been remastered and are sharp and clear. They're better than they were ""way back then.""

The order came quickly and arrived in excellent condition. I'm pleased with the quality and the smile on my husband's face.",1359590400,6,470,4.402298850574713
5409894,5,B00ADRYGSC,"Finally, a decent DVD set of my favorite comedy series!
These appear to be commercially pressed DVDs, not DVD-Rs.
At any rate there are 4 DVDs with 3 films each.
The prints used are pretty good but there are some scratches and other extraneous marks on some films.
The set kicks off with one of my favorites, the first Bowery Boys opus, ""Live Wires"" featuring Mike Mazurki.
I prefer the earlier Bowery Boys films with a gritty feel of crime over the later slapstick ones.
But they're all fun.
So if you are a Bowery Boys fan you're sure to love this set.
Can't wait for Volume Two! :)

And these guys are having adventures in the city i was born and raised, for a young boy as I was then I was so proud of Leo and Huntz. I am so thankful that I am able to see the Bowery Boys again.

5409898,5,B00ADRYGSC,"Long overdue and awaited debut of UNCUT Bowery Boys films. Back in the mid 80's as some may remember, WB put out a 6 VHS collection that claimed on the box covers - ""classic uncut feature film comedy"". Of which at least one of those films - Bowery Buckaroos - was NOT ! Lets hope that Warner's extended search has found all missing footage and put it back where it belongs. IN THE MONEY was another one that had some footage missing as well when it aired years ago on A&E and TCM. Hopefully the aforementioned films will get the makeover they deserve when they eventually make their DVD debut.
  Now, about this set, of what I've seen so far, I like. But some films look too contrasty and dark. I also noticed extraneous audio between a fade out to fade in on a scene in IN FAST COMPANY. During the ""fade"" you can hear audio for about 2 seconds from the previous scene ! This could be a post production error when the films went to be digitized and the editor must've had an extra audio track in the timeline of the editing software. I can't imagine that the actual film print would've had an audio flaw and if so, someone in post production should have recognized it and dubbed it out. I do an extensive research on these films. I check with some of my own 16mm prints and TV prints that I have recorded over the years and compare. This is how I found a lot if the edits and omissions.  Also, the version of IFC is a different print than the one shown on TCM. The TCM version has more scratches, some lines and other film imperfections but yet it is still uncut and no second audio problems on that fade scene. So in WB's defense, I guess they are doing extensive searches for the best quality prints to present on DVD because IFC is a different print sans the imperfections. Nevertheless,  Note to WB Film restorers : please go over these with a fine tooth comb, so that the last bastion of Americana can be viewed in its intended glory ! I can never understand why some studios won't, don't or can't revert back to some TV versions of the films to retain the missing footage. There are a lot of film collectors out there who would gladly contribute or lend their 16 or 35 mm prints for a nominal fee or a DVD credit, all in the name of preservation ! Please don't drop the ball on the next volume(s) ! I still gave it 5 Stars because overall its a nice collection and one of my favorite series.",1357603200,15,2397,4.2615384615384615
