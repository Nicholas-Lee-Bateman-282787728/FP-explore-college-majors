7543830,3,B018AXRMZ4,"From Dusk Till Dawn: Season Two focuses on relationships that become increasingly complicated as everyone attempts to put their lives back on track after one very insane day. Santanico (Eiza Gonzalez) and Richie (Zane Holtz) are now partners in crime  a sort of modern-day Bonnie and Clyde. Seth (D.J. Cotrona) and Kate (Madison Davenport) are scraping by as small time criminals south of the border. And Freddie Gonzalez (Jesse Garcia) has an almost obsessive focus on protecting his wife and young daughter in the suburbs. Carlos Madrigal (Wilmer Valderrama) and Scott Fuller (Brandon Soo Hoo) have become changed men. The characters will once again come together facing off against a huge threat.

Season Two co-stars Danny Trejo, who appeared in the original feature film as Razor Charlie, and Esai Morales, currently a series regular on The Brink. Trejo plays The Regulator, a frightening agent of evil who is summoned to perform a deadly errand. Morales appears as Lord Amancio Malvado, a figure of terrifying cruelty and power who has a complicated and obsessive relationship with Santanico. Gary Busey and Demi Lovato also make guest starring appearances.

The 3-disc Blu-ray release contains ten episodes. Bonus extras include audio commentary with director Robert Rodriguez and cast and crew; 2015 New York Comic Con panel discussion; cast bios; Inside the Episode (1-10); and several behind-the-scenes featurettes.",1454112000,3,1425,5.381165919282512

7543843,5,B018AXRMZ4,From Dusk Till Dawn season 2 continues the story of season 1 and expands on the story from season 1 and the movie.  i love this show.  the special effects are well done the acting is great and the story is getting really good.  season 3 starts soon and i am so excited to see where it goes from here.,1460851200,,300,3.966666666666667
7543844,5,B018AXRMZ4,"If you love the movies, you would love the tv series.  The tv series goes in more detail of all the characters, where they came from, and how they become who they were in the movies",1458518400,,181,4.027777777777778
7543845,4,B018AXRMZ4,Ok,1458432000,,2,2.0
7543846,5,B018AXRMZ4,"I am a huge fan of the film so checking out the television show was a no brainer. I enjoyed the first season very much so when I heard about a renewed second season I had to check it out. I won't give any spoilers but, if you enjoy the film (ONLY THE FIRST) check it out, it continues the story of the Gecko bros and the other characters which all do a fantastic job acting. If your on the fence about it go in with an open mind.",1457740800,,429,3.831460674157303
7543847,4,B018AXRMZ4,"Just finished Season 2, I think it lacked a bit of the magic that made the first season different from the huge amount of other vampire power struggle TV shows that have come out in the past decade or so.  It is more unpredictable of course, being that it no longer follows parts of the plot of the movie, but season one just had the different to the norm factor with the parallel stories where the characters crossed paths such as the family in the RV, the Texas ranger in pursuit after Seth and Richie who murdered his partner who was like a father to him.  Sure most of those characters are back in this season but they are sidekicks to the various Snakepire characters.

Season 2 is basically a power struggle season for who will be the top Snakepire.  Seth and Richie want nothing to do with each other and have their own plans on how to get what they want from the Snakepires conflict.  For me this makes it pretty similar to most other Vampire shows, except of course these ones are snake themed.  I thought Season One was brilliant, but although I will watch it, I don't think I'll rush out and get a copy of Season 3 when it first comes out on DVD.

On the plus side if you were a huge fan of Fez on That 70's Show we get to see a lot more of Carlos (Wilmer Valderrama).  Danny Trejo has a pretty cool character in this season too (different one to the character he played in the original movie).

There's plenty of special features on the DVD but overall I just enjoyed the first season a lot more than the second.",1457481600,2,1524,4.2456747404844295
7543848,5,B018AXRMZ4,love this show and it keeps getting better!,1456531200,,43,4.5
7543849,4,B018AXRMZ4,"Big improvement over the first season since it's not constrained by the original plot.  Characters are more established and not so ""over the top"" as well.  Plot is a little weak, but that's not why you're watching this.  It's fun escapism with crazy snakepire creatures and outlandish anti-heroes.  If you liked the first season, you'll be happy with this one as well.",1456185600,3,368,4.887096774193548
7543850,4,B018AXRMZ4,"Season 1 of Dusk Til Dawn was a decent enough run, enjoyable if plodding at times. Most of the flaws in that season are cleared up here, however, as the story moves more fully away from the film to become it's own unique create. The character work and plot is more interesting, with Jeff Fahey, Esai Morales and Danny Trejo all adding quite a bit. Fun, fast moving and very worthwhile.",1454544000,,385,4.436619718309859
8741859,5,B018AXRMZ4,Love all three seasons keep makeing more,1528502400,,40,4.857142857142857
8741860,4,B018AXRMZ4,"Not as good as season one, since most of the cast was separated for large chucks of the story. However, it was still enjoyable. I liked that they explored more of the mythology behind everything.",1501891200,,195,4.6

8741863,5,B018AXRMZ4,"I love the movie and like the show even more, which I didn't think was possible.  Pure gold.  The actors, plot line, everything, just awesome.",1495843200,,142,4.64
8741864,4,B018AXRMZ4,It was a gift and he liked it.,1485907200,,30,2.875
8741865,3,B018AXRMZ4,"Season One had a tight story line and a cast that did an excellent job stepping into the movie characters' roles.  Eiza Gonzlez  Salma Hayek; Robert Patrick  Harvey Kietel; Don Johnson  Michael Parks.  Even Sam Medina does a great job reprising Danny Trejo's bartender role and makes it his own.

Season One used Tarantino-like non-linear narratives to hold viewer interest and develop characters' back stories.  Season Two just plods onward through some ponderous plot.

Charitably speaking, Season Two's plot line is less focused.  Random characters are added for no discernible reason.

Caprica's Esai Morales is available?  Make up a character for him.  We can sign Danny Trejo?  Write him into the story line too.

The Trejo character randomly appears, scowls, and brutally murders someone.  There is no back story for the Trejo character or any indication of his relevance to the story arc.

Jake Busey is carried over from Season One.  Jake Busey.  Crickey.

Utterly bored after the first disc.  Probably won't make through the second disc without completely losing interest in the characters and whatever the plot line is supposed to be.

Fyi, the Blu-Ray disc played normally in a North American player.",1484352000,,1212,5.144329896907217
