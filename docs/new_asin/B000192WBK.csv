John Byner doing both voices, he always made me laugh (I didn't know that he was the characters, when I was a kid).
But happily just added to the flavor of the Ant and the Aardvark. Well done series :-)",1402531200,,292,4.327272727272727
8008467,5,B000192WBK,"This 17-episode series features a bungling blue aardvark (sounding like the very New Yorkish Jackie Mason) chasing the casual, wise-cracking ant (sounding like the jazzy, oh-so-laid-back Dean Martin, both done by impressionist John Byner), with loads of visual and dialog gags. The Ant and the aardvark get to joke it up, since they could both talk, unlike Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.

I, my wife, my seven-year-old daughter, and my teen son all find these cartoons hilariously funny. It's not often you see a Jewish-accented aardvark as a cartoon antagonist, and some of his lines are priceless (""I strike! And then I strike again! And then again (if necessary)!""). And some of the surrealistic bits from the PINK PANTHER cartoons leak over, as when the Aadrvark uses something called ""Instant Hole"", which the wind keeps blowing around and creating, of course, an instant hole where there wasn't one before! Usually right under his feet.

And dig that toe-tapping Dixieland background music! These are even funnier than the Pink Panther cartoons themselves. Why don't they make stuff like this anymore?",1196899200,4,1112,5.138121546961326
