M.D Geist is not that, is a fantastic , war anime in space, that's actually very realistic. Also I saw that the Uncut Japanese, English subtitled version, not the crappy dubbed version these idiots watched. lol
The plot, and it's a great one is the Geist is part of space soldier team. They have a great war against an enemy and Geist is one the few men still alive. His platoon though deserts him, and leaves him for dead.
If the plot sounds familiar, its exactly like ""Soldier"" with Kurt Russell in animated form.
Geists though, only on brawn and brains survives and destroys everything in his path. Well not everything, he does come to a city invaded by a bunch of deadly gangs (like in Fist of the North Star) and eventually he wipes them out too...
Geists platoon eventually find out that he's still alive and want to use him, check that abuse him.
Geist has other plans , and what results in a hour of the best hand drawn action anime you've seen.
The other critics don't know what they're talking about, so check it out.
I know great anime (Macross DYRL, Gundam Wing) and M.D. Geist is great.",1088553600,,1231,4.524663677130045

I wasn't able to figure out what was going on most of the time.... didn't even know who the bad guys and the good ones were. The ""hero"" was constantly screaming like  he was close to a nervous breakdown ( he was supposed to be a  technologically enhanced super being or ...whatever). There was also a lot  of disgusting stuff (suprise) in it, like humans being torn apart slowly  and bit by bit. Not bad BUT IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. There was lots of  action, no humor, no sex (booooh!)... anyway, if you like anime chaos at  its height, go ahead, buy it.",944784000,,597,4.285714285714286
