8145857,4,B000IJ7AF6,I have arthritis and this program works well for me.  Easy to follow  & really like the mirror reverse option.,1411084800,,110,4.45
8145858,5,B000IJ7AF6,I enjoyed this product because of the slower pace I can use this workout on the days that I don't want a harder workout yet I still get to loosen those muscles & warm up my body once again that's for a great work out from David Chang.,1377561600,,234,3.8958333333333335
8145859,4,B000IJ7AF6,"Fun workout , great for beginners. I recommend for anyone starting out. Basic positions easy for any recommended for any level.",1368835200,,127,5.095238095238095
8145860,4,B000IJ7AF6,"As some of the other reviews noted there are no slick production values. It feels and looks like you are in a working dojo street sounds and all. Frankly that doesn't bother me as I work out in one. David Chang demonstrates the moves well and narrates as he goes along to help get the proper movement. For me the learning speed was just right, not too fast or too slow. It may take several run throughs to get it all right, but the beginner can accomplish learning basic Tai Chi from this DVD. There is an 8 minute stretch to begin then you have a 28 minute session where there is a choice between a regular and mirrored version. I appreciate there is a version for iPod as I like to use mine.

I only have 2 small criticisms. The iPod version of the regular workout portion is split into 3 separate 9 minute clips instead of one flowing one. I also would have liked an un-narrated version where once the moves were learned we could just go with the flow of the stretches and routine. Of course you can always turn off the sound and put on some music and the only distracton would be ignoring the lip movements as Chang narrates. Other than these two small quibbles, I enjoyed this DVD and would recommend it to beginners. As I recall I also purchased this DVD new at a discounted price so for me it was also a good value.",1347926400,2,1322,4.246031746031746
8145861,5,B000IJ7AF6,Excellent - Yang style t'ai chi seems to be the oldest form and David takes you through the exercises clearly and concisely.  The DVD also has a mirror version which I found easier to follow.  I would recommend this DVD for anyone who not only wants to keep fit but also wants to increase their body awareness and spirituality.  I've read reviews where the background was criticised but if you focus as you should it isn't a distraction and I don't even notice anything.  Brilliant!!,1344211200,2,483,4.647058823529412
8145862,4,B000IJ7AF6,"My mom recently attended a Tai Chi class at her local senior center. She asked if I could find her a DVD that would allow her to practice what she learned by watching those moves over and over again.  I bought two DVDs: this one and Sunrise Tai Chi.  This one only had 3 stars, the other, close to 5.

We tried Sunrise first and it was just too much for us--too complicated, didn't know where to start and too much esoteric discussion. For those who are really serious about learning authentic Tai Chi--both advanced moves and philosophies--I think that DVD would be great.

Then we put this one in and it was perfect for US.  Just the standard set of moves that my mom learned in class, done slowly and repeatedly, talked through in both regular form and mirror form, depending on what's easier for the viewer to imitate.  Yes, it doesn't have fancy production values, but when I go to a class in person, people open doors and everything isn't in soft focus either, so for me, this did not cancel out the fact that I found this DVD refreshingly easy to follow.

It depends on what you're looking for, therefore, but for those who just want to learn basic tai chi moves to do in a consistent, easy-to-watch- and-learn routine, I think this DVD is an excellent choice.",1243987200,12,1267,4.458874458874459
8145863,5,B000IJ7AF6,"Sure you could make a tiny case that the production values could have been higher and that's true. But what is more important? High production values or High Instructional value from a great teacher like Sifu David Chang? The picture quality is great and the audio well done with Sifu Chang providing clear, gentle instruction. By the way if you are not breaking out in a subtle sweat you aren't doing it right. Bravo Sifu Chang. Great job! When will you produce say a 24 step or longer DVD? Buy this if you are a Tai Chi beginner or an intermediate needing to return to basics!",1230681600,2,578,4.462264150943396
8145864,4,B000IJ7AF6,"Firstly to the other reviewers posted here take a chill pill. While I agree that there were a couple of minor guffaws in terms of some exterior noise and I think one time a door opened, there is really nothing offensive at all. The picture quality is very good and most importantly Sifu David Chang is a remarkable instructor who is both very inspirational and very gifted. The moves are learned SO easy it's a joke. A teacher like this is worth his weight in platinum, but seriously teaching like this is rare even on China dvds. If you want complicated look elsewhere. If you want to learn real beginning Tai Chi and get a GREAT workout BUY THIS DVD and his other DVD on Tai Chi For Weightloss.",1230681600,5,696,4.403100775193798
8145865,3,B000IJ7AF6,"As the other reviewer said, the production quality of the video is poor (you can tell it was filmed in one take in what seems to be an acutal Tai Chi studio with a bathroom door in the background...also you can hear traffic going by outside).  All that aside, the instructor is great, and in my opinion that's what matters.  If you can just picture that you're in a classroom with this guy getting private instruction then it's not bad.  He's very knowledgable and explains the moves really well.  I felt like I got a good workout.",1190332800,6,531,4.443298969072165
8145866,2,B000IJ7AF6,"I wish I would have known or seen this video before I bought it as it is a complete and total waste.  The instructor seism to know what he is doing but the quality is just terrible.

Another DVD disappointment in my collection.",1190073600,,227,4.255813953488372
