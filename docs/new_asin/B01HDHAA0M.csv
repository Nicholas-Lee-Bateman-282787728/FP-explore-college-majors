7785987,5,B01HDHAA0M,"Forced Move had me on the edge of my seat, making me wonder, what would I do? This Independent film has the edginess of cult-classics like Deliverance and The Blair Witch Project. Looking to see more from this promising director.",1467676800,,229,4.75
7785988,5,B01HDHAA0M,"Had the opportunity to see this film and absolutely loved it.  It's a really well done indy film with amazing performances from David Kallaway, Rhes Low and Jennifer Pierce Mathus.  The supporting cast really shows up as well.  I have no idea what the budget was but it was great to see a film that was well performed and based on a good story.  For sure will recommend this movie to friends.",1467590400,,392,4.402777777777778

7785992,5,B01HDHAA0M,"I saw this film at a film festival and was so impressed with the performances. Rhes Low, Jennifer Pierce Mathus and David Kallaway just blew me away! And not giving anything away, but I can't remember the last thriller that captivated me enough to make me emotional through the end credits. Very well done!",1467504000,,306,4.685185185185185

7785996,3,B01HDHAA0M,"Yeah, it's low budge and a slower burn than your average, ultra-predictable, H-wood thriller, but what it might not offer in shock-and-awe-visual-effects distractions it more than makes up for in its serious approach to storytelling. This tension-building, teeth-grinding flick is an investment. Watch it for the payoff. (All that foreboding ain't for nuthin!).",1501113600,2,361,5.830188679245283
7785997,1,B01HDHAA0M,"I hate how this movie made me feel. Although I turned it off after they started chasing the guy and his wife into the woods, I did not see any value in this movie. I suppose that if I had watched to the end by some miracle there could have been a plot or a point to this movie that shows no value in human beings. Absolutely hated it!!!",1500768000,,336,3.8840579710144927
7785998,5,B01HDHAA0M,"Although it's fictional, it seemed like a non fiction. It's a learning experience. Sorry to to say, part of problem today, are these movies, and I do say part of problem, not all of it. It's part of where serial killers get their ideas. But is was very good.",1500595200,,258,4.285714285714286

7786003,4,B01HDHAA0M,"Not much of a plot.  I kept thinking this must be because it is based on a true story, but it's not.  The acting was very good though, and it kept my attention throughout.

The helplessness of the lead character, John Parsons, did get rather aggravating.  He cannot start what appears to be a new truck.  Although he is an avid runner, for no apparent reason, he sprains his ankle and limps through the entire second half of the movie.  When he does catch up with the psycho killers in the process of torturing and killing two of their victims, all he can do is ask one of the victims where the phone is and hide.  Toward the end, I actually found myself hoping the killers would get him simply for being so pathetically useless. :)",1499126400,,732,4.338235294117647
7786004,1,B01HDHAA0M,"If you thought ""Inbred Redneck Alien Abduction"" was a masterpiece, you'll love this movie.  The producers must have blown a thousand bucks on making it.  If they had pizza delivered for the ""actors.""",1499126400,,199,5.0
7786005,4,B01HDHAA0M,I appreciated the 16:9 picture. The audio was not 5.1 surround but I'd rather have widescreen if I can't have both. The story did interest me. I guess I do like to watch something unusual.,1499040000,,188,4.4

7786012,5,B01HDHAA0M,VERY GOOD FILM WITH A HORRIBLE SENSE OF DREAD. IT NEVER GOES FOR CHEAP SHOCKS. IT IS A HARROWING FILM EXPERIENCE.,1498348800,,113,4.428571428571429
7786013,5,B01HDHAA0M,Worth the watch!,1498262400,,16,4.666666666666667
7786014,4,B01HDHAA0M,"This is a low budget film. However, the acting was fine and the plot was really good. It kept me on the edge of my chair and reminded me to make sure my doors were locked. It wouldn't get an Oscar but it was really good for what it was. WARNING and SPOILER: This movie is not for the faint of heart. It is not for little kids. It is basically about two psychos who drift into town and start torturing and killing people. One is totally detached and considers himself to be highly evolved and on a mission. A climax to his actions and the reason why he was put on this Earth, to begin with. His partner is extremely violent and sadistic in his killing techniques and easily manipulated by the other. He does the deeds for pure enjoyment. There isn't much blood, just the sound of an extremely violent death, with victims screaming in agony. The horror of the whole thing is that it took place in a small town, in a common neighborhood to regular people who were just living their lives amid a few personal problems. The film was extremely realistic and reminded me in some parts as being in the same league as ""In Cold Blood,"" but without much personalization. It was a brutal movie and the acting by the fellow who played the manipulating psycho really acted exceptionally well and acted exactly the way an insane cold blooded killer would. I gave it a four.",1498089600,6,1358,4.392857142857143
7786015,5,B01HDHAA0M,"Don't expect a fast-paced thriller from start to finish. This film hooked me from the first few minutes with a look into a marriage that's falling apart. We're introduced to the characters slowly, but the acting is true and the storyline drew me in. The thriller (violent) part of the movie doesn't start until past the halfway mark, but that's fine because it's a solid, riveting movie well before the blood starts. It's just an excellent movie from start to finish.",1497744000,3,467,4.777777777777778
7786023,1,B01HDHAA0M,Terrible movie.  It's a joke.,1497312000,,29,4.8

7786025,1,B01HDHAA0M,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Seemed like there were a lot of missed opportunities that would have made it interesting.  The ending was ridiculously stupid.  One big example of a missed opportunity centered around the mother teaching her son about chess strategy.  It seems like foreshadowing that the son was going to implement his mother's sage advice and save the day.  No such luck.,1494720000,,399,4.8088235294117645
7786026,5,B01HDHAA0M,Good little Indie thriller with Hitchcockian undertones and an abundance of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.,1494288000,2,130,4.695652173913044
7786027,5,B01HDHAA0M,"Cool indie suspense flick that had more thrills than most Hollywood thrillers and it's under 80 minutes! Lean, edge of your seat plot with great characters and direction. Reminded me a lot of some ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" episodes. Would love to see more mature, intelligent thrillers like this!",1493251200,,298,5.229166666666667

7786046,5,B01HDHAA0M,What a great film! Loved the story and love supporting indie film makers. I liked the suspense and the creepy villains. The scenic location was so beautiful and really enjoyed the music.,1492732800,,186,4.84375
7786047,3,B01HDHAA0M,This is what I will never understand. People pick on indie films (so where is yours?) This film was interesting. It kept my attention and made me want to see how it ended. There was a review that said the last 10 minutes was the only good part. I say the last 10 minutes is what brought the movie together. I'd love to see more films like this. Gloss and Hollywood is fun but I`ll take a nice raw indie thinker any day. Kudos.,1492646400,7,426,4.083333333333333
7786048,1,B01HDHAA0M,So slow and boring.  Like watching ice cubes melt.  Acting fair.  Story line slow until the last ten minutes.  Then It becomes a little crazy.,1492560000,,142,4.56

7786050,4,B01HDHAA0M,"I'll take an indie thriller like this over auto-tuned big-budget movies any day, because it gives them room to defy your expectations more. This one has a neat setup: a guy with a teetering marriage goes for a morning run through his farming community, only to realize that a pair of psychos are killing people along the same route-- and making their way towards his home. It's tense, harrowing, and surprising, reminding me of the cool minor thrillers of the 40s like The Reckless Moment. Definitely check it out!",1492473600,3,514,4.786516853932584

7786053,1,B01HDHAA0M,Slow and boring.  Turned it off because after 45 minutes or so we still hadn't gotten to the theme described in the synopsis of the movie.  Just a bunch of rednecks complaining about their daily problems.,1492214400,,204,4.638888888888889

7786066,5,B01HDHAA0M,"This indie is an engaging throwback to the taut thrillers of Hitchcock, using pacing and camera work to build tension. Interesting characters you can root for and baddies you want to see get what's coming. Worth checking out.",1492041600,5,225,4.947368421052632

8765106,5,B01HDHAA0M,"I'm a screenplay consultant (scriptguy.com) and the vast majority of scripts and movies I come across are the same old generic, been-there-done-that stuff.  Can I get an Amen?  But FORCED MOVE really makes you think.  Yes, it's dark and grim, but not for sheer sake of it (unlike so many other starkly ""realistic"" movies out there these days.)  Its broodingly dark undercurrent is more to set the mood for the film's real message and it's a powerful one.  For my money, it offers the same thought-provoking concept as MAGNOLIA, only in reverse.  Where MAGNOLIA swirls around the individual trials and tribulations of a bunch of L.A. residents only to make them realize that their petty troubles are insignificant in the face of a genuine, life-affirming miracle, FORCED MOVE goes the other way.  In this flick, those individual struggles and anxieties are all but obliterated by a random murder spree that forces these characters to remember what really matters in life.  The closest movie I can think of to this one - both in terms of its tone and its poignant but sobering message - is ONE FALSE MOVE, the classic Indy flick directed by Carl Franklin and penned by Billy Bob Thorton.  Both films capture the same sense that all the soap opera dramas in our lives may really just be prelude to the event that truly defines us.  The wake up call that shows us who we are and reminds us what's truly important.  Most of all, it's refreshing to see a film that makes you think about what matters, even as it's scaring the pants off you too.",1503964800,,1538,4.659259259259259

8765108,4,B01HDHAA0M,"I loved it. A man and his wife are having marital troubles: he loves her, and she's having an affair with the sheriff, who's getting impatient. It goes a little slow at first, and the husband is frustratingly boring and needy, but it's a small-town pace to get you started. Then two obviously bad men move into a motel room and a dog is dismembered and found in a garbage bag in the road, by the sheriff. The killings start and are discovered by the jogging husband who can't find a phone to call for help and is hobbled by an injury while running to find some. I found myself calling him names when he practically walked in on a gruesome murder in progress and didn't hobble the other way. A comedian plays the more cerebral of the two killers and at times, it's amusing. Only at times, though. It's exciting for the last hour.",1501632000,,828,4.348387096774194
