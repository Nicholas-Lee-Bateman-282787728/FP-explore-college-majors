8662769,4,B00KZ1WE8A,"Nice wartime romantic comedy with Ameche as a half South American rubber salesman in town to woo investors.  He rents an apartment from rich girl Bennett who recently has gone broke.  Bennett pretends to be the maid and has to do some shuffling to avoid Ameche finding out her real identity.  Billy Burke plays another one of her funny scatterbrain roles, but Ameche and Bennett carry the film.  The only drawback is a mildly weak ending but the moving is pretty entertaining throughout especially if you like the leads.",1405814400,8,520,4.808988764044944
