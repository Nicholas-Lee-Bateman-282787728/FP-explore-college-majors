5169842,5,B008MILL78,All three movies are classics and would recommend to anyone who enjoys violent movies.  Also they all look and sound good.,1363737600,,122,4.809523809523809
5169843,5,B008MILL78,"As soon as I saw this blue ray I had to get it. All three of these movies are fantastic. Action packed and a little crazy, but in a good way. If you haven't seen them then you need to. I think this 3 pack movie deal is a great idea but a lot of times i can't find one where I like all 3 movies so I was super excited when I saw this one. Great price too, cheaper than the 3 movie blue-ray packs in the store.",1363046400,,408,3.595505617977528
5169844,4,B008MILL78,"I wanted American History X and True Romance on Blue Ray. When I first saw this package, I had never heard of A History of Violence. I was also afraid the movies may be on less than one disc each. Turns out A History of Violence is a good movie, and they are all recorded on their own individual discs. I recommend it.",1361923200,3,318,4.063492063492063
5169845,5,B008MILL78,"Three powerful action thrillers, beautifully remastered. Typically, one would expect at least one of the films to be a dog, but that's just not the case here. At $9.99, an absolute no-brainer!",1360713600,,192,5.03125
5169846,5,B008MILL78,"But throw in Ed Norton in American History X, and you have a really good deal here.  I hate ""A history of violence.""  I gave that away as a gift. but True Romance is awesome in blu-ray/",1360281600,2,185,3.972972972972973
5169847,5,B008MILL78,3 great combination of epic movies. All three are movies that will change your views about a lot of things in life.,1359936000,,115,4.2727272727272725
5169848,4,B008MILL78,"Three movies presented in 1080, why not? For the price this is well worth it.

5169849,5,B008MILL78,"Most triple-feature blu-ray offerings have not even one disc worth owning, but all three of the movies in this collection are solid. You can't go wrong here.",1437523200,,157,4.851851851851852

5169852,5,B008MILL78,3 good movies that all come on separate discs with bonus features included.  A pleasant surprise since bonus features are often stripped from combo packs like this.,1429920000,,164,5.074074074074074

5169864,5,B008MILL78,"I was riveted by these powerful and superbly acted films, each of which explores the subject of male violence, both latent and manifest. In ""American History X"" (1998), Edward Norton plays a neo-Nazi gang leader consumed by race hatred; after he is imprisoned for an appalling crime, he becomes determined that his impressionable younger brother (Edward Furlong) not suffer the same fate. In David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"" (2005), a seemingly mild-mannered man played by Viggo Mortensen must come to terms with a dark past when an ominous visitor (Ed Harris) forces his wife (Maria Bello) to question his identity. ""True Romance"" (1993), written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott, gives us Christian Slater as a low-key, daydreaming loser who falls headlong into a world of homicidal thugs after he marries a blonde prostitute (Patricia Arquette) with a vicious pimp (Gary Oldman); also featured in the great ensemble cast are Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn, and others. These three Blu-rays feature improved picture and sound, several enlightening extras (commentaries, documentaries, deleted scenes, and more), a compact case, and a low, low price. This is a great value!",1396137600,3,1251,5.355329949238579
5169865,5,B008MILL78,"This was a gift for my husband, and he likes all these movies!  It was nice to have them all together on Blu ray!",1370649600,2,113,3.7083333333333335
5169866,5,B008MILL78,This is such a great combo of movies and for the price you can't beat it. Every one of them is a classic,1365379200,,104,3.5652173913043477
5169867,5,B008MILL78,"I couldn't believe I could get these three masterpieces in one set for such a low price. If you're like me, I was worried that it may have had all three movies on one disc but this is not the case. They each have their own disc as if they were pulled straight from their individual cases and placed in this compilation. These movies are not for the faint of heart, but if you are not put off by violence, get this collection.",1365120000,15,425,4.132530120481928
5169868,5,B008MILL78,What can you say?  All three of these movies are great.  Each disk has a good amount of extra features and the blue ray quality difference is clear.  The extra scenes in True Romance alone make the collection worth owning.  But the most appealing thing about the collection is the price.  I have seen one of these movies selling in a retail store for more than I paid for the three movie set.  A great collection at an unbeatable price.,1364428800,,436,4.3875
