3935205,5,B002HWUU3G,Several Websites are reviewing a HALL OF FAME LIVE 9 Disc Set? Why is amazon.com only offering a 3-Disc package??,1256688000,12,113,4.7
3935226,5,B002HWUU3G,Excellent,1485129600,,9,9.0
3935227,3,B002HWUU3G,"There are a few fatal flaws with is what's a great and exciting idea.

1. The main problem is that the record quality is dismal.  There's nothing I can do to make these sound good and although I appreciate the talents involved I can't know for a fact that there was even decent sound live at the venues. I assume there must have been but the performance you get is TV speaker quality regardless of your playback equipment.  If I read this review I wouldn't believe it but it's the truth

2. These are not great performances in the first place.  Some of them are very interesting and a few are really good but most are confused, bored, unprepared, and sound uncomfortable. There are usually one or two that work per disk.  Which is about what you expect from a typical album.

3. They represent a wide variety on each disk.  This comment can be seen as good or bad balanced at mediocre.  I would have preferred separation by styles or by attitude but instead they seem to be linked by brain mush and an overall sameness that the muffled sound enforces.

I bought these as used disks for just a few dollars each so I'm not unhappy with my purchase.  Try one or two before dumping big money on the whole set.",1484611200,,1205,4.358744394618834

3935233,2,B002HWUU3G,"I was going to purchase this 9 DVD set, until I read a few of the reviews.
I also wished that each year's inductees would be on one DVD, the actual footage shown on HBO would have been great!
Not sure how far back these ceremonies have been recorded, but it would be an awesome library to own.

3935235,3,B002HWUU3G,The mix is wacky. It was totally fragmented. Theydidn't put excerpts from individual shows together.  Nor does there appear to be any discernible rhyme or reason  to the sequence which they chose,1463529600,,195,5.0625
3935236,5,B002HWUU3G,"Breathtaking performances by Mick Jagger, Bruce Springsteen, Tina Turner, Metallica, ZZ Top and more.

3935259,3,B002HWUU3G,"I have to agree with other reviewers that the editing totally ruined the show. There's no order. it's back and forth, without any timeline, sequence or reference. The DVD's are not even numbered? (only the cases were)
We have here one of the kind of historical footage that should be preserved for posterity with meticulous love and care. With attention to the details. Someone did butcher job on editing this one! What were they thinking? Perhaps in the future if this ever will be released and Remastered on Blue ray, it will be edited back to its original entirety. Like it once was when it took place and when it was aired.
When this is being offered as a Complete set of 9 DVD's it should be such. If I choose to purchase the ""Best Of"" 3 DVD then I would expect edits.
Also the Audio and Video quality ranges from Good to OK. Worth of Complete Remaster, shows were excellent and performances stunning! 5 Stars",1438128000,,914,4.5120481927710845

3935263,3,B002HWUU3G,"This is a great collection. Great artists. My fav. so far is James Taylor playing a solo acoustic version of ""Woodstock"" as both a tribute to Joni Mitchell (the writer), and CSN-whom he inducted after playing it.
The ONE major problem is sound quality. It SHOULD have been remixed, remastered, etc. I know it's tough w/all those performances, but my buddy as a top notch studio, and I have my mixers, and software myself, and they could have done SOMETHING in making this DVD. Time Life, I love you, and your collections, have a few. But you dropped the ball on this very important collection in music and R&R Hall of Fame History. SOOO, having said that; you'll love it for the performances, the collaborations, the speeches, etc. BUT, make sure you have a good stereo, and preferably a manual (yes old school) EQ in your stereo you play this set thru. That's the best advice I can offer on this one. If that's ok by you, then it's ok to spend over a hundred bucks on purchasing it. Peace.",1435881600,,990,4.5055555555555555

3935286,5,B002HWUU3G,"There Are Stellar Performances Among This 3-Disc Set: ALL REMARKABLE!!! (This Is NOT the 9-Disc Set, Nor To Be Confused With The 25th Anniversary R.& R. Hall of Fame Tribute Concert DVD.)  I Am THRILLED With This DVD Set.  Originally Purchased For The Tribute To George Harrison By Tom Petty, Stevie Winwood, Jeff Lynne (Electric Light Orchestra) & George's Son Dhani Harrison w/AMAZING Guitar Solo By Prince Performing One Of The Most Hauntingly Beautiful Rock Songs Ever Written ""WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS"".  PRINCE OUTDID EVEN HIMSELF! - This Is The Best Live Performance, EVER...OUTSTANDING!!!  I'm Equally Enthralled With All 3 Discs!!!

Performances Are Absolutely BRILLIANT, Spanning Several Decades.  Another ""MUST"" Is Billy Joel's Induction Speech Of John Cougar Mellancamp...Hysterical!!! All The GIANTS Are Here, Minus Joan Jett & The Blackhearts, Billy Idol, Lenny Kravitz, INXS & Oasis (Who Still Must Be Inducted!!), and I Love, Love, Love Each Of Them.  These Performances Are SO Mesmerizing, I'm Transported & Transfixed While Watching.  You've Got Mick Jagger Solo & With The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton Solo & With Cream, Sir Paul McCartney, Traffic, AC/DC, Bruce Sprinsteen, U2...The List Goes On & On.

One Of The More Unique & Totally Absorbing Aspects Of The Inductions...Interesting Mixes Of The VERY BEST Musicians Performing Songs' Of Each Others' With Each Other...SUPERLATIVE!!  Another ""NOT TO BE MISSED"" Performance: A Very Young & Enthusiastic Dave Grohl and Taylor Hawkins (Of Foo Fighters) Performing ""Tie Your Mother Down"" With Brian May and Roger Taylor For Queen's Induction.

While Every Performance Is A Genuine Standout & Remarkable, There Are Far Too Many To List Individually. Additional Favorites Of Mine:

""Sunshine Of Your Love"": First Time In 25 Years Cream Performend Together...So Good, Could've Been Yesterday!!

Kid Rock Inducting And Performing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" with Lynryd Skynrd...Really Fun Perfomance!!

While Never A Big Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) Fan, I Have To Compliment His Lead Vocals With The Doors On ""Light My Fire""..Great, Great, Great!!

Performers Who Most Look Like They're Having A Great Time Performing Together: Tom Petty Inducted Buffalo Springfield & Performed Rousing Rendition Of ""For What It's Worth"" With Graham Nash, Stephen Stills & David Crosby. (Stephen Stills Was Inducted Twice That Night: For Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills & Nash!)  Aside: Whenever Graham Nash Appears, He Looks Like He's Having The BEST Time!!!

MAGNETIC!! KINETIC!! This DVD Set Will Appeal to ANY LOVER OF ROCK 'N ROLL!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",1400889600,,2608,5.429280397022333
3935287,3,B002HWUU3G,"Turns out the Induction and Acceptance speeches are not the original versions.  They were cut to save time.  Quality is okay, understandable since some footage is from quite a few years ago.  Also not all of the Honoree's performances were included on the DVD.",1391817600,,260,4.863636363636363
3935288,5,B002HWUU3G,There are different forms of this collection and I decided on this one for its price.  It has all the performances I need.  Some of the all star jams are to cluttered with people on stage but the smaller performances are priceless.  Good picture and sound quality.,1391817600,,264,4.574468085106383

3935290,4,B002HWUU3G,"This is sort of a ""greatest hits"" collection of what was 9 CD's.  One wishes that they used the abundant time on the three that come with this to present more performances.  A lot of time goes to acceptance speeches and extras.",1387324800,,227,4.380952380952381

3935294,2,B002HWUU3G,"The audio is absolutely horrible, terrible!  It's mono! Over half the vocals & guitar solos are way too low.

3935295,3,B002HWUU3G,"The product was brand new, but the content was a dissapointment.  They chopped up the years into many different DVDS and didn't just show the year's inductions as they happened.  Too bad

The historical value of each year's ceremony is totally lost in the shuffle and it seems like the same performers are on over and over.",1373500800,,323,4.631578947368421

3935299,3,B002HWUU3G,"Its good to go back and see these artists playing, the sound is mostly good, but we are so spoiled today with the sound of music dvds.

3935300,5,B002HWUU3G,I FOUND THIS DVD TO BE EXCELLENT IN PICTURE AND SOUND  WAS GREAT SEEING MANY THAT MADE ROCK ROLL  SO FANTASTIC IN THE EARLY YEARS.  WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH CHUCK BERRY AND JERRY LEE LEWIS,1369958400,2,187,4.285714285714286

3935305,5,B002HWUU3G,"While at the start of the discs, yes- You get 3 whole DVDs full of live music, they say they did the best to restore the original audio/video as possible.  Only 3 or 4 of the performances where low/bad quality.  The rest were perfect.  That is the only bad thing I can say about this incredible treasure.  If you like live music and/or you like to see some incredibly gifted musicians jam together- BUY THIS NOW!!  You won't regret it and I will bet you will return to buy other copies for friends as gifts!",1362873600,,507,4.294736842105263

3935307,4,B002HWUU3G,All wrapped up in one DVD. While it is true that some of the video is a little ugly it is clear that this was taken from analog video and for the most part a good job was done. I have not watched the whole thing because there were some performers I was not interested in (shame on me).,1361059200,,285,3.847457627118644

3935309,4,B002HWUU3G,"An overall great collection, however I wish the induction speeches were full length.  I haven't watched all of them but one of the reasons I bought this DVD was to see Jakob Dylan induct Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers.  Unfortunately, they only showed about 3 sentences of his speech so that was disappointing.  Other than that, worth the money for sure.",1359504000,,353,4.754098360655738

3935312,5,B002HWUU3G,I bought two of these as I recall for both of my children since we sat up all night to watch that live performance...I live near Cleveland where it was held in our old Brown's stadium on Lake Erie.  It went into the wee hours of the night and we watched the entire thing.  This was to give to my children as a remembrance of that night when the Hall was opened here.,1356566400,,366,4.0

3935314,5,B002HWUU3G,I bought this for my husband who saw the program on TV & just had to have.  Now he watches it over & over & I don't mind because there is some great guitar playing.,1353628800,,164,3.6857142857142855
3935315,5,B002HWUU3G,This was the perfect Fathers's day gift my husband was very excited when he opened it. He especially liked the book inside each DVD explaining what is on each disk.,1342310400,,164,4.5
3935316,3,B002HWUU3G,"Maybe I'm just anal or probably just OCD but I had to buy the 9 disc set instead of just the 3 discs.  The main reason is that when you watch just these 3 DVDs, you miss out because many of the artists in their presentation and acceptance speeches reference previous inductions and events and/or songs that were played and if you dont't have the whole set, you get lost not knowing what they're referring too.  Also, the Special Features on the 9 disc set include rehearsals for the big show and backstage interviews with some of the greatest artists of all time.  One negative, really the ONLY negative is you get more than your normal dose of Paul Schaffer on most of the discs.  You see he was the Musical Director for the first several years of the Rock Hall Induction concerts and he is downright annoying in the background.  He's literally trying to DIRECT some of the jam sessions and he stands with his back to the audience jabbing his finger in the artists faces trying to cue them when to play.  They mostly ignore him but he makes a complete ass of himself pretending like he's on par with Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Mick Jagger, and Bruce Springsteen.  No clue why we are forced to watch these awesome never to be repeated reunions of Cream, CSN&Y, CCR, and others along with collaborations with Mick Jagger and Tina Turner, Springsteen & George Harrison, Prince and Tom Petty and a slew of others but with Paul ""Dumb Ass"" Schaffer getting in the way.  He even insisted on playing in the background with piano players like Billy Joel and Steve Windwood.  Nobody must have told him that his job was to direct from behind the scenes but he's such an Attention Whore that he couldn't stay off stage for one minute.  That's the one and only negative about the set.  Anyone who says it's ""tiring"" to watch 9 discs shouldn't even purchase 1 disc let alone 9 because these sets are for true rock and roll fanes who want to see rare performances of their favorite bands.  And the induction speeches are extended on the larger set too so you can see every minute of them as though you were sitting in the audience.  So so cool",1337644800,6,2127,4.465116279069767
3935317,4,B002HWUU3G,"Yes, I hate when people have the hubris to rate products like this without actually owning or viewing them, but there some serious problems with this collection, and I had to voice my disappointment. Why oh why is this collection not on blu ray, and why in FULL SCREEN??  I gave it a rating ABOVE its average, but this is a callous and glaring omission. Time/Life always seems to take the cheap way out when releasing collections like this, so I shouldn't be surprised. Someone else needs to take it by the horns and release it in blu ray, in WIDE SCREEN aspect ratio. This is 2012 people, get with the times.",1335052800,,609,4.4375

3935330,1,B002HWUU3G,"I was so excited to watch Springsteen induct U2 since I hadn't seen it since the original night that it was aired on television.  The DVD seemed packed with great introductions, performances, and collaborations from some of the greatest musicians of all time.  Well I've just finished watching it, and I can honestly say that this is the worst live music DVD that I have ever watched.  Many of the performances were an embarrassment, the sound quality poor, the production weak, and generally, the entire DVD feels like a waste of time and money.  I know that it isn't easy making the sound work well when the performances are in a large hotel room, but when the likes of Santana, Jagger, Keith Richards, Springsteen, Johnny Cash and many more share the stage and sound like they are singing in a pop corn tub, there is something really wrong.  Frankly, if this is the best that could be done, there really is little reason to have made this DVD, since the performances themselves lack any sense of  excitement or originality.

As I painfully listened to the first hour, I at least grew excited at the thought of seeing Bruce and hearing that great U2 induction speech one more time.  I was met with a 30 second version of a five minute speech.  I was mislead into thinking that when the DVD information says that an introduction is included, that it is in fact the introduction and not the verbal 30 second Cliff Notes version.  The only honest part of the entire DVD is that this was consistently bad, and incomplete throughout the production.

Some may say that these productions have some sort of historical value.  I say, these performances are better remembered in the mind.",1293235200,3,1680,4.6768707482993195

I have to agree hands down with the liner notes provided with the disc-there really is no simpler way to say it: ""The DVD you hold in your hands features 14 of the finest performances of soul music that you will ever see."" That is one of the biggest understatements I have heard in a long-time.  Memphis, Detroit,Philadelphia,Chicago and Muscle Shoals are all represented with performances that are really for the ages. The Aretha that came to sing that night is the energized, electrifying Aretha from 1967- now imagine that voice captured within 2 stellar arrangements,  with sharp visual and aural fidelity, backed by a superb band who channel the heart and soul of those early Atlantic records. Yeah, tears of joy streamed down- The Staple Singers, Al Green, Wilson Pickett, Percy Sledge, the O'Jays, the Four Tops, a blow you away perfect performance of "" Theme from Shaft"" by Issac Hayes, Keith Richards jamming as I have never heard him solo with Booker T. and the MGs, and the list goes on and on.

""Rock and Roll Hall of Fame + Museum Live: Sweet Emotion"" (105 min.) brings a number of interesting moments from the rich legacy of the induction ceremonies over the years. The best on here include Jackson Browne and Melissa Etheridge's cover of ""Wake Up Little Susie"" (which starts off this DVD). It is followed by the 1989 acceptance speech from the Rolling Stones (Mick and Keith doing the talking), and the subsequent all-star jam of ""Honky Tonk Woman"", and all I could think was ""all of them look so young"" (given that this was 20 years ago). Same with the 1997 induction of Crosby Stills & Nash (performing a great ""Wooden Ships""), and even with the 2001 induction of Aerosmith, which is only 9 years ago, but Steven Tyler and the guys look so much better then than these days (don't care too much for the ""Sweet Emotion"" performance with Kid Rock, though). But the best on here comes towards the end: Bono's 1999 speech inducing Bruce Street & the E Street Band (followed by a fabulous ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"" performance by the band), which is followed by Bruce Springsteen's 2005 speech inducing U2. The last performance on the DVD is the 1992 all-star jam of ""All Along the Watchtower"" (for the induction of the Jimi Hendix Experience) and again I couldn't help but stare and think how young so many of the performers look to me now (this being 18 years ago now).

The DVD comes with some bonus materials, including 6 more induction speeches (including the 1988 speech of Mick Jagger for the Beatles and the 2000 speech of Paul McCartney for James Taylor), and an interesting 1997 rehearsal by James Taylor and a 2009 rehearsal by Metalicca.

Thing is, I've never been a fan of any of these people (except George/Beatles), nor has the tune ever been a favorite, but the performance -- and the recurring chorus through Prince's solo spot -- is just staggering! The addition of George's son -- who looks a whole lot like his dad -- and even moves like him -- on acoustic guitar, adds a sense of poignancy to the whole affair.

3935361,3,B002HWUU3G,"For a ""Best of"" three-DVD set this should have been better

The Annual Rock Hall awards have been aired on cable for many years but lots of collectors were either too young - heck many weren't born yet - or didn't have cable TV. So having Time-Life issue a set of the ""best"" performances was great news! They issued it in various configurations including a NINE-DVD set and this, the smallest, as a three-disc set. So, one would think that the three disc set was the ""cream of the crop"" and the bigger sets for those who want ""more"". Well, that's not the case here.

Why is the Rolling Stones acceptance speech shown TWICE and other pieces repeated also? While the ""jams"" which conclude many of the ceremonies are a chance to see everyone on stage at once, they are - based on what is here - sloppy. Look at Mick and Bruce! Great artists, not at their best here. So, what is the ""best"". Well, IMHO, it's the reunions like Cream, the Doors and Queen (even giving props to Freddy Mercury's mom).

You can leave out anything with Kid Rock - again, in my opinion - as he is more a hanger on than a real artist.

The camera work is also not consistent, jumping from videotape to film in the same performance.

I could go into more detail as to what is here, but others have listed that. I guess I just hoped for better choices as what to include on the ""Best of"" set which is the one most folks will look for.

3935362,3,B002HWUU3G,"I agree very much with ""art87's"" review... I got this as a x-mas gift b/c it looked like a real ""must have"" from the promotional ads.  I don't know who edited this but it's so poorly put together!  There's 3 CDs but part of the speeches and live performances are all chopped up on different CDs, all the speeches are cut really short, (like Bruce Springsteen inducting U2) and it's extremely disorganized!  It should've been put together in date order, with all the speeches and songs for the band being inducted on the same CD and not butchered and put all over the place.  What's up with the different names of the CDs, what's the point of that?  They could've just gone in order and called each CD ""1,2 & 3.""  And what's the point of even having the speeches on the CDs if you can't show each speech as it was done live?  I don't know if this is a Time Life error or an error by the editors of Rolling Stone, but I have to ask... what were you thinking when you edited what could've been a really great bunch of events to see???  BEWARE OF BUYING THIS!",1261958400,,1055,4.24
3935363,5,B002HWUU3G,"Five stars are too few. I'd like to give this set 100! This is really a wonderful set, both for us baby boomers and our kids, who get to see and hear the musical icons of the 60s and 70s. And we baby boomers see performances by some of the newer artists, like Metallica, and Eddie Vedder.

The best part of this fabulous set is seeing these musicians induct other musicians and accept induction themselves. They honor their peers, reflect on their work, and share their joys and sorrows, successes and mistakes, and lament over the passing of many of them.

It's sad but joyful to see John Phillips perform with the Mamas and Papas (sans Cass Elliott). And George Harrison, who was inducted both as part of the Beatles and posthumously for his own work, by his widow Olivia and his son Dhani.

Billy Joel, when inducting John Mellencamp, speaks of the possibility becoming a rock icon by dying prematurely. He says, ""If we die young we become a rock icon but we also become dead, and what could be worse than becoming fertilizer?""

Ray Charles inducts Billy Joel and thanks the Hall of Fame for including him in the ceremony, yet another poignant moment.

Bruce Springsteen participates in several inductions, one of which is for Ray Orbison. Springsteen tells of how as a child he listened to Orbison's ballads on the radio at night and was so moved he vowed never to speak to a woman again!

There are so many moving performances, among them, the Righteous Brothers singing ""You've Lost That Loving Feeling,"" with string and choral accompaniment, the Byrds singing ""Turn, Turn, Turn,"" and the Who singing ""Won't Get Fooled Again."" Eric Clapton admits to not having played with Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce for 25 years.

Among others who speak and perform are Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jefferson Airplane, Buffalo Springfield, and Crosby, Stills, and Nash. The Doors do a riveting ""Light My Fire"" with Ray Manzarek's swirling keyboards, as fantastic as 40 years ago. Eddie Vedder sings, faithful to Jim Morrison's brooding, sensual style.

Mick Jagger makes several appearances, both accepting induction and inducting others. The Stones let loose with Honky Tonk Woman, joined by Tina Turner and other. Jagger, when inducting the Beatles, recalls the rivalry between them and the Stones. He and George Harrison and Bruce Springsteen perform a rousing ""I Saw Her Standing There.""

As he did in the seventies, Steve Winwood and Traffic sear us with ""Dear Mr. Fantasy."" His wail is as clear as it was back then. It's as if no time has passed.

Fleetwood Mac, Jackson Browne, Melissa Etheridge, Santana, and the Band appear as well, and carry us back. We may have aged but our music still pierces.",1261094400,19,2698,4.83297180043384

3935365,5,B002HWUU3G,"Many others have talked about what's missing (probably driven by clearance issues not politics), but what's included is golden. Bono's induction speech for Springsteen, Springsteens's ""Tenth Avenue Freeze Out"" (both DVD #2) and Prince's killer guitar solo on While My Guitar Gently Weeps (DVD #1) alone are worth the price of this package. Check out the total look of glee on (the normally dour) Dhani Harrison's face as Prince absolutely slays the guitar solo. This DVD set is a backstage pass to an industry insiders' event - lots of classic moments to treasure.",1260835200,,564,5.075268817204301
3935366,4,B002HWUU3G,"It's got some great moments but there is no rhyme or reason to the order in which this progresses. It skips from one decade to another, backwards and forwards.

3935367,4,B002HWUU3G,"THIS WAS PRODUCED BY TIME-LIFE.
This is a typical Time-Life glossy release.  There are some really fantastic moments, but there is no real meat or depth.

Time-Life has been producing this type of stuff for 50 years.  It started with book boxsets.  Like World War II in nicely bound books with lots of pretty and sometimes amazing pictures.  It gives you an overview of what happened, but cannot go into detail.  Now it is CD and DVD sets that are sold through Informercials...like the Flower Power CD set being adverstised by Peter Fonda (how embarrassing).

This DVD set is exactly like that.  There are great moments on this DVD set, but you know there is much more that is available that is not included.

I hated this thing at first.  But, as you watch some of the performances, you got to love it.

This is a 3 DVD set with 44 songs and about 3 and a half hours of music.  There are bonuses of introductions and back stage stuff that gets it up to something like 8 hours.

There is so much missing for this set, but what can you do about it?  It is 3 DVDs that are filled to the max.  So, either you have to add more DVDs and increase the price, or cut some stuff and replace it with other stuff.  My vote would have been to cut some stuff.

I would have preferred more performances and less induction speaches and backstage stuff.  But the purpose of this is to give you a feel for the whole Hall of Fame experience.  Plus, you would then miss Billy Joel's induction of John Cougar Melloncamp, which is the best thing on the whole set.  I am not a big Billy Joel fan, and I don't think John Cougar Melloncamp (sp?) has any business being in the Hall of Fame, but the speaches both give are very entertaining.

There are certainly some performances that could have been cut to make way for others.  All of the Bruce Springsteen songs could have been cut.  For some reason, he does not give very good performances of his own songs at the Hall of Fame, but does provide some very good guest performances with other groups.  The songs by some lesser artists like Jackson Browne and Melloncamp could have been cut.  Not just because I am not a big fans of the songs, but because the performances are nothing special.

There are many, many groups I (along with you) would have loved to have seen added.  In some cases, it may not have been possible because of contractual reasons...who knows?  But you would think that the Hall of Fame would make sure to own all of the performances.

As for the DVD:
One thing I really like is that you have the option of just playing the songs, or playing the songs with the inductions into the Hall of Fame.  But, the inductions are so heavily edited, I don't know why they bothered including them before the songs.  The full inductions for many of the acts are included in the bonus material.

What I don't like about the DVD (and most music DVDs) is that it defaults to stereo and you have to go into the menu to change it to 5.1.

The audio quality is good to excellent on all the songs.  The video quality is just barely passable to OK.  There is a note at the beginning of the DVD blaming the audio and video quality on the age of the tapes.  That is ridiculous.  It has nothing to do with the age of the performances or the tapes.  They just made a decision long ago that they wouldn't do a professional job in recording these concerts.  The oldest one is 1988.  People have been making quality concert films for decades before this.  You just need to make the effort to do so.

There are many great songs, like the Doors' Light My Fire, and While My Guitar Gently Weeps with Prince.  For a Jimi Hendrix tribute, there is a very nice All Along the Watchtower.  But, I don't know how that belongs in a Hendrix tribute.  The song was written by Bob Dylan and was performed by many artists.  The way they play it at the Hall of Fame, it sounds more like Dave Mason's version than Hendrix's version.

For under $30, I think this is worth getting.  Many people talk about the ""politics' in how the songs were chosen.  But, I don't think it has anything to do with politics.  I think it has everything to do with what they thought would sell...which is why Mick Jagger and Bruce Springsteen are all over the thing.",1260576000,2,4251,4.33248730964467
3935368,5,B002HWUU3G,"This really is a great collection! So much history in here, and a lot of things that I have yet to discover.

One of my favorite scenes is the performance of the Beatles' ""I Saw Her Standing There"" performed by George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, and John Fogerty.

There's tons of coolness in here though, and I haven't even made it to the end of disk 1 yet.

Definitely worth picking up, especially if you're a fan of what is now known as ""classic rock""! Would also make for a great gift seeing as the holidays are sneaking up fast!",1260230400,,583,4.429906542056075

with my kids who otherwise groove on Miley and Jonas Bros.  We had a
fabulous time!  Springsteen is the boss here but it was totally fun to
see a mix of amazing stars performing together.  What I also loved
about this set is that it wasn't intended for public consumption!  I
don't think people really recognize that.  The speeches and backstage
clips are the stars being themselves.  It's great to see them standing
around a little awkward, making lame jokes with each other, as well as
inducting one another with heartfelt tributes.  And sometimes they are
so pretentious it laughable!",1260230400,3,654,4.881818181818182

In September 1995, what had been a wild dream for so many became corporeal reality as the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame finally opened its doors. To celebrate such an august moment, a concert to end all concerts, featuring a Who's Who of rock and rhythm and blues greats, was held at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium. The Concert For The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame contains eleven of the greatest performances from that day, ranging from the street-smart sounds of Lou Reed and Soul Asylum to the sanctified soul of Al Green. If you were lucky enough to be there, you know how incendiary the concert was. If not, the material on this DVD will blow your mind and send you straight to rock and roll heaven!

It's even cheaper (about $109) on the Rock Hall of Fame's site. Somebody's trying to make a quick and unfair profit here.",1260144000,8,292,4.745098039215686
3935372,4,B002HWUU3G,"Sloppy, indulgent, and sure not to please everybody, this is the face
of rock and roll in probably the most candid and spontaneous way
most of us are going to see.  Most of the good stuff is on the first 3
discs that make up the mass market version, but, this is what you miss:  the Dave Clark 5 tribute ""Glad All Over"" with Joan Jett, John Mellencamp,
John Fogerty and Billy Joel.  Ruth Brown with Bonnie Raitt.  You have to
be old like me to know Ruth Brown but she was in great voice and
out sung many younger singers in this collection.  The Staple Singers  with all of its members.  Pops Staples so old just glad to be there.  ""Who'll Stop The Rain"" John Fogerty.  The Pretenders three song set with  Neil Young playing lead on ""My City Was Gone.""  The last disc is the live  stadium concert which was surprisingly good but way too short at 52
minutes.  Biggest surprise (other than Ruth Brown) was Bon Jovi and
Eric Burdon doing ""It's My Life/We Gotta Get Out Of This Place.""  Burdon  looked and sang great.  Coolest guitars:  Jack Bruce's fretless bass and  Chrissie Hynde's metallic Telecaster.  Like I said, the best stuff is on the  first 3 discs.  Crosby, Stills & Nash were the best I've seen in years.  Pete Townshed's induction of the Rolling Stones is hilarious.
Biggest complaint:  They cut out the funniest moments from Springsteen's  induction of U2, which I saw live and was the best speech ever if you got  to hear the whole thing.  The 9 disc set is for collectors and worth a hundred  bucks, but no more than that.  Best Buy has an exclusive 4 disc set which  is just the first three plus the stadium concert disc, which is the best deal  money wise.  I am happy with the 9 disc set and will not go on about all  the people left out.  The Hall Of Fame is a brand and will be around for
some time.  More releases are sure to follow.",1259798400,32,1853,4.290697674418604
3935373,4,B002HWUU3G,"Many, many great moments.  Especially liked the exuberant version of I Saw Her Standing There--watch for Springsteen and Jagger competing for the mike and screwing up the lyrics.  Prince's lead on While My Guitar Gently Weeps is a must see/hear.  Speeches were good--liked McCartney's daughter's t-shirt which said ""It's About f---ing time"".  Referring, of course, to taking almost 30 years to induct Paul into the RRHOF as a solo artist.  At an average of $10 per DVD, it's a good price, though most of the stuff you'll only watch once.

Don't mind the people that ding this set because it omits so many stars.  Other DVD sets will eventually be released.  The success of this set will ensure that more archival footage will be released.

When this was broadcast on HBO, they also offered all of the songs on these DVDs on pre-recorded CDs--makes it easier to get on your iPod.

3935375,5,B002HWUU3G,I loved watching this because you really feel like you are part of the action - the footage is raw and some of the performers seem like they had been partying before their induction (thank god - it IS rock and roll after all) so you like you are there and in on the action.  SO many performances to point to but my favorite is the Metallica Rehearsal footage and when ever U2 is on!  This is a must buy for anyone who loves Rock!,1258588800,2,429,4.035294117647059
3935376,3,B002HWUU3G,"this could have been great & definitive.  i haven't played all 9 dvds yet, but am frustrated how years & artists are thrown across multiple discs.  like the Beatles performance is on disc 1 & Mick Jagger's induction speech for them is on disc 2.  another example, U2s acceptance is on disc 3, but their induction is on disc 2.

& the glaring omission of Led Zeppelin.

& no respect for the Bee Gees.  they get severely cut for no good reason.  u get 45 secs of Massachusetts & 90 secs of You Should Be Dancing.  they're good enough to be inducted so they should be good enough to be uncut.

there's definitely some bias here.  the Pretenders survive the cuts & scattering here the best with their induction, acceptance & 3 songs intact & in order.  thats the way the other inductees should have treated here.

but this is what's available to us, so we have no other choice.

so 5 stars for the material minus 2 stars for very poor editing.",1258329600,58,939,4.358381502890174
3935377,2,B002HWUU3G,"leaving out Led Zeppelin is like leaving the A out of the alphabet.

my other complaint is inductions are chopped to pieces & thrown across multiple dvds.  a prime example is the Stones.  Pete Townshend inducts them on Disc 1,  Mick accepts on both Discs 2 & 3.  His speech with Keith is chopped in both places.  why not just have their complete acceptance speech in one place.  definitely some butcher did the editing here.

most likely, they'll release a correctly sequenced version probably in the future on Blu-ray & milk consumers for more money.  until then we are stucked with this chop suey version.

2 stars for the butchered editing, 4 stars for the material, -1 star for no Zeppelin.",1258329600,12,694,4.661157024793388

Disc 2: ""Sweet Emotion"".
Disc 3: ""Start Me Up"".
Disc 4: ""Concert For the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame"". (Selected performances).

The 1st 3 discs contain the following:
This is an excellent piece of Rock & Roll History. It shows Inductor Speeches, Inductee Speeches, and Inductee performances. It also contains some excellent collorabtions. It does not include all the inductees, but what is does have is simply outstanding. I think the best colloration was the one with Neil Young, surrounded by a host of guitarists, including Johnny Cash, The Edge, Carlos Santana, John Fogerty & many others, performing ""All Along the Watch Tower"", it showcases individual guitarists, ""solo-ing"", at times. Another great collaboration was Mick Jagger & Tina Turner performing ""Honky Tonk Women"", along with many, many backing singers, guitar players, & etc.

The 4th disc contains the following: Part of the Concert for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame which was filmed in 1995, in Cleveland's Municipal Stadium, to commenorate the Grand Opening of the Hall of Fame.

The Concert is as followers: (Note: This is not the entire concert, but this is a great excerpt from it.)

2. Eric Burdon (from the Animals) and Bon Jovi - It's My Life

3935381,1,B002HWUU3G,it was great news to hear of this release.  so i forked out and brought it for the mamas and papas section.  but it has been cut and not a single glimpse of cass in her hey day the speaches were cut.  also no induction for them (shnia twain did this in 98). timelife seem to do this with all there releases .  my advice try and buy the groups and performers you want from other sources. you might be disappointed,1258070400,8,412,4.049382716049383
3935382,3,B002HWUU3G,"So many duplicates, I mean how many times do i need to see Springsteen and Eddie Vedder?  How bout some Jerry Lee Lewis or Little Richard?  People that shaped rock!  And to leave out Led Zeppelin is just shamefull.  The performances that are there are nice, but the ones missing, greatly outshine them.",1257811200,4,302,4.6415094339622645

This 3 disc set is an excellent piece of Rock & Roll History. It shows ""selected"": inductor speeches, inductee acceptance speeches, and inductee performances. It also contains some excellent collaborations, with many musicians participating. It refers to some of these collaboration musicians as the Rock Hall Jam Band.

The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Gift Shop has a ""Complete"" box set of about 10 dvd's that contain all the induction ceremonies. It may be available at their website. It runs around $108. While this Amazon set has some of the best, it does not contain the induction of Blondie, Talking Heads, the Ramones, the Pretenders and many others. However, what it does contain in simply outstanding.

The product description of this set contains the details of the bands and artist being inducted,and so on. So, there's no need to repeat that.

All the inductions & performances are outstanding. I'm sure everyone has their favorites. Some of the one's I liked includes:

I think the best collaboration performance, was the Neil Young & the Rock Hall Jam Band performing ""All along the Watchtower"". This one is an awesome performance. I've never seen Neil Young rock so hard. Plus, you get mutiple musicians, including Johnny Cash, on this one.

Prince does an excellent guitar solo, in a collaboration of George Harrison's ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"". Others that I liked include: Mick Jagger and Tina Turner and the Rock Hall Band performing ""Honky Tonk Women"". The performances by ZZ Top, & the induction of ZZ Top by Keith Richards. The performance of ACDC & their acceptance speech. The induction of Bruce Springteen by Bono of U2, and the induction of U2 by Bruce Springteen.

My favorite part is the induction of Lynyrd Skynyrd by Kid Rock, and the performace of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" by Kid Rock & Lynyrd Skynyrd. And the ""Main"" thing I liked was the acceptance speech by the surviving members and by family members of Lynyrd Skynyrd. Remember, their plane crashed in 1977, killing lead man Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, and others. Also Allen Collins & Leon Wilkeson are dead.

I was so glad to see this band get inducted, especially after all the tragedies, this band has gone through.

Ronnie's widow Judy gave a very touching acceptance speech, and accepted Ronnie's trophy. Allen Collin's father along with Allen's daughter accepted the trophy for Allen. Leon Wilkeson's trophy was accepted by a young man, probably a family member. Two young ladies accepted Steve Gaines trophy, I'm not sure of their relationship, but I think one was Steve's daughter. Anyway, this was a special moment to see these people finally being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

Overall, I gladly highly recommend this one. This is pure Rock & Roll History!!!",1257465600,3,2887,4.909650924024641
