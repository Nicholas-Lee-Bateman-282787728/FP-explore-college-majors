8058757,1,B0009A6BTA,"An opportunity to see Mussorgsky's original concept of BORIS (orchestration and libretto) is interesting but this DVD has more problems than no subtitles.

First, the conducting is simply plodding and boring, not emotional at all and BORIS needs a strong conductor.

Second, this a telecast videotaped by someone so the picture is grainy and not always good.

Last, and worst of all, the entire film is lip-synched and not always well. There are shots of a conductor starting some acts but this wasn't a video of a live production. The post-production recording was probably for certain touches such as having the ghost of Dimitri give part of Pimen's narrative in the final scene. They could have gotten the voice perspective right but they all sound like they're standing in front of the same mike with no stage sounds at all with all the emotions of a run-through. But, then, with a conductor like this, they probably wanted to get it done and go home - which is what it sounds like.

I can't recommend it and suggest anyone interested in a DVD of the opera to stay with either 1954 film with Pirogov or the 1978 Bolshoi telecast with Nesterenko under Khaikan.",1380844800,,1163,4.742574257425742
8058758,5,B0009A6BTA,"For openers, some secondary drawbacks to this set need to be listed:
1) There are no subtitles.
2) The cast list is given at the beginning only in Russian (i.e., Cyrillic characters).
3) The names of the cast members are given with only a first initial and last name.
4) The names of some minor cast members are omitted.
5) There are no notes, not even a paper tray card, included with the set, to provide any contents (not even
  a track list).
6) The back of the DVD case prints what little information the set provides in German, and has several typographical errors in the list of characters, including misidentifying the Innkeeper as Princess Marina.

Next, be advised that this is the original 1869 version of the opera, meaning that it is missing all of Act III from the 1872 version -- no Princess Marina or Rangoni at all, and no Act IV Kromy Forest Scene to conclude the opera after the death of Boris.  (It is given in Mussorgsky's original orchestration, not the re-working by Rimsky-Korsakov.)  Furthermore, a  few additional cuts are taken, most notably portions of the scene between Grigori and Pimen in Act I.

Why, then, given all these caveats, do I rate this a five-star item?  Quite simply, this is the most riveting performance of Boris Godunov among the half-dozen or so versions on DVD.  While it will not replace the 1872 versions of either the 1978 Kultur release of the traditional Bolshoi Opera production of the Rimsky-Korsakov edition (but lacking Act III, Scene I) with Yevgeny Nesterenko as Boris Godunov and Boris Khaikin on the podium (do not confuse this with the much inferior 1987 version featuring Nesterenko and conductor Alexander Lazarev!), or the Philips release of the idiosyncratic 1990 Kirov Opera staging of Mussorgsky's original orchestration with bass Robert Lloyd and conductor Valery Gergiev, it is an indispensable supplement of great strengths that put the packaging flaws in the shade.

First, a list of the cast members and their roles, with as many first names supplied as I could find:

Boris Godunov - Vladimir Matorin
Fyodor - Sasha Belyaev
Xenia - T. Yasko
Nurse - Larisa Kurdiumova
Innkeeper - Yulia Abakumovskaya
Grigori - Vyacheslav Osipov
Shuisky - Vyacheslav Voinarovsky
Simpleton - N. Garaeev
Missail - N. Deminov
Varlaam - Vladimir Svistov
Pimen - Vassily Kirnos
Shchelkalov - Anatoly Kichigin
Mitiukh - unnamed
Boyar - unnamed
Orchestra & Chorus of the Stanislavsky and
  Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre
Conductor: Yevgeny Kolobov
Recorded live, 1991

Second, while virtually all the singers are unfamiliar -- only Matorin has had much exposure on recordings -- the singing is uniformly strong from top to bottom, with only a mediocre but passable Mitiukh being a partial exception.  Admittedly, Matorin does not have a voice that bears comparison in weight, depth, and color to such great protagonists as Feodor Chaliapin, Mark Reizin, Boris Christoff, Nicolai Ghiaurov, or Martti Talvela, but he sings quite well and is also a compelling actor whose terror is palpable.  Vyacheslav Osipov is one of the best vocal exponents of Grigori to be found in any recording, though visually he does not look like a young monk.  All of the other singers fulfill their roles quite ably, with boy soprano Sasha Belyaev as Fyodor deserving special plaudits.  The orchestra and chorus play and sing well.  Yevgeny Kolobov is an idiosyncratic conductor who often makes unorthodox tempo choices, but he nonetheless makes them work and is a convincing interpreter.  With one odd and brief exception, the applause is cut from each act until the opera's conclusion.

Third, the acting is a couple of cuts above the operatic norm.  The Stanislavksy Theater has long been renowned as one of Russia's great stage houses for training actors, and here one can see visible results of the work that was done with the singers.

Fourth, the staging and filming are extremely compelling.  Coming shortly after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and on the eve of the dissolution of the USSR, it boldly uses the Russian Orthodox faith as a dominant symbolic motif.  At the front of the stage is the traditional sand-box from parish churches in which Orthodox believers place lighted candles for votive prayer offerings.  The onion dome of St. Basil's cathedral and of other Orthodox churches loom in the background over a three-sided boxlike set that defines the stage area but changes in appearance for each scene.  In some scenes, most notably the death of Boris, all three walls form a giant and very beautiful iconostasis.  The sets are otherwise spartan but effective; the costumes are traditional and strikingly attractive; in the coronation scene Boris is (quite properly, given 17th century imperial rites) vested by clergy, in a manner similar to an episcopal consecration.

Another ingenious device is the inclusion as a silent character of a young boy who represents the murdered Tsarevich.  Unlike many other stagings where this becomes a gimmick with an omnipresent figure usurping the action, staging director Olga Ivanova has the good sense to have the figure appear briefly only during the orchestral introduction to the opera's prologue, and after that only in scenes involving Boris, where he becomes a hallucinatory projection of the usurping Tsar's tormented conscience.  In an unexpected but moving final touch, in the brief orchestral epilogue to the death of Boris the Tsarevich takes Boris by the hand and leads him gently into a lighted realm, signifying forgiveness for his murderous deed through suffering and repentance, fulfilled in reconciliation beyond the grave.

The film itself is of high quality, much better than most opera videos of the same vintage -- again, doubtless a benefit of this being a Stanislavksy Theater production.  The camerawork does include some devices and effects that go beyond what a theater audience could see, so in that sense this ""live"" production is also one conceived and executed in terms of commercially made films.  Again, however, these touches are always well thought out and add to, rather than detract from, the production.

In conclusion, then, don't let the several minor flaws I initially noted dissuade you.  If you love this opera -- and it is among my half-dozen favorites -- buy this before it disappears.",1368576000,,6322,5.06268081002893
