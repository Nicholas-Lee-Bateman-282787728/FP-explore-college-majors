2117012,5,B0002S94G6,"The other reviewers that is.

This is a fabulous film that superficially is about WW2 submarine warfare (and yes you can see there's a lot of low-rent sets...especially the interior shots of the American submarine). In Enemy Hands is the best male-ensemble war film since Platoon...& maybe better. It isn't William Gacy's best effort(he seems to throw off his lines like an aging hipster)

& perhaps it's because Til Schweiger absolutely steals the film with his nuanced deeply effective performance of the U-boat Captain.

What I think is truly subversive is the metaphor- in this case meningitis that affects the American crew and later contaminates the German crew which has rescued the them. You don't have to dig deep (or think too hard) to find that this is an anti-war film on the surface and a clever way of critiquing America's influence

and culture throughout the world. The film id's it as a disease- a fatal disease that infects all.

And it's somewhat of a trojan horse in that it masquerades as the familiar genre of naval warfare films.

Look closely- the German actors are wonderful to look at...they look healthy...the Americans? Wimpy, non-descript, outside of the head bangin'banty-rooster American sub commander.

This is a hidden gem of a film- perhaps too subtle for a mass-audience of film goers. If you've taken a good film history class or studied acting- I think you'll be blown away.",1120867200,24,1411,4.953389830508475
2117013,3,B0002S94G6,"My friend had rented it an I borrow it from him one night and watch it. I've seen some costumers review about this movie and I think it's not that bad. this is only a low budget B movie. that's it. but actings are good, special effects and CGs are acceptable.

there is a problem with DVD. Americans speak in english, Germans speak in German but there is no subtitle in english for german speeches! that's a real problem cause germans speaks lot in the movie and you can not understand about half of the movie if you don't know German!

my last word is, this is a forgettable, low budget movie. doesn't worth to buy, doesn't worth to rent. but It's not that bad that some said!",1118361600,,677,4.28125
2117014,3,B0002S94G6,"Well, first and foremost, i would say the acting by well known actors such as William H.Macy, gorgeous Thomas Kretschmann (German officer in ""the pianist"") was good.. they deliver the mood and feel very well. As for the hunk, Til Schweiger (i was introduced to him OFICIALLY,through this movie. But seen him in the replacement killers,tomb raider,king arthur before), he was a bit stiff i should say... and supporting roles such as Jeremy Sisto (played Caesar in ""julius caesar"") and Ian Somerhalder was ok... but sometimes too ""Over"" especially Ian... but hey,they are young actors so there's a lot of time for them to fix that..

The story is focusing on how Germans and American, in desperate time calls for desperate measure, that is to work together inside a german U-boat after the american's have been distroyed. There is no other option but to help to keep the boat and the crew survive or at least make it work. The american have to work with their enemy... you guess it..  The idea was good already, but maybe some ingredient was missing for this film.. You can expect good actings from those you want to expect to....but don't expect the movie to be as thrilling and as moving as other War movies like Enemy at the gates, Saving Private Ryan and others.. but still,you can feel the closeness between the characters,like the last part when Ludwig (kretschmann) end up as POW and visited by William H.Macy, you can still feel something...

Pretty typical though...but it's alright... But to those who loves Thomas Kretschmann, Til Schweiger.. you gotta see this movie! Both look good in this Film!",1117324800,,1606,4.832727272727273
2117015,1,B0002S94G6,"Okay, last night I rented Ocean's 12 and went to my buddy's house to watch it.  I get there.  We play some Bocce ball.  I kick some arse.  Then we retire into the house to eat some turtle ice cream and watch the movie.  Too bad his dad was watching 'In Enemy Hands' and wouldn't let us throw in Ocean's 12.  I have to say, the prologue is the only good thing about this movie.  Some very impressive world war 2 film stock.  But then the movie starts.  Within minutes you know this film has nothing going for it.  There is no structure, the acting is horrible, there is no sense of drama, and there's a continuity error in the first shot.  I want to know whos nephew got to direct this film.  Thanks for trying, but no.......just...no.

PS- Don't watch this film.  I bet if they did a study, they would find that watching this film actually takes about 12 minutes off of your life span.",1115510400,5,885,4.221556886227545
2117016,2,B0002S94G6,"'In Enemy Hands' stars the solid cast, including William H Macy ('Fargo'), Scott Caan ('Ocean's 11'), Lauren Holly ('Turbulance'), Till Schweiger ('Driven') and Thomas Kretschmann ('The Pianist').

This low-budget film (by Artisan and others) about the two WW2 submalines and their crew has one interesting idea at its core, but fails to make good use of it.  In 1943, USS Swordfish Lt. led by Cmdr Randall Sullivan (Caan) encounters its enemy ship, German U-Boat U-429 led by Kaptain Jonas Herdt (Schweiger).

The film then shows one intriguing premise -- What if the crew of the boats share the same submarine; what if they must join force to survive the situations that get more and more deadly to them?

Sadly writer/director Tony Giglio fails to find the best method to develop this idea.  You know, in this case, you need lively, interesting characters to engage our attention.  Instead, Giglio assembled the used materials from other submarine films, and patched them up to cover the whole 98 minutes.  You can hear the echoes of other better films -- I don't name names -- when you see the mutiny/hostage situation, and occasional torpedo attacks.  And you also get one epidemic, too, which is too conviniently introduced.

William H Macy and Thomas Kretschmann, both playing the officers under command of Caan and Schweiger respectively, are doing their best, but it is obvious that the acting is nowhere near their best.  And as to ill-used Lauren Holly (who was also ill-used in 'Down Periscope'), and Jeremy Sisto whose character is reduced to a pixel, I have nothing to say except that they deserve much better roles than these.

I don't say 'In Enemy Hands' is badly done.  It just lacks originality.  The CGIs are decent, and the submarine designs are reasonable, but still it needs momentum 'Das Boot' and 'U-571' are endowed with.

Though it seems that 'In Enemy Hands' went straght to video in USA, it showed up in theaters in Japan, and the Japanese version I saw was doing an admirable thing, letting Germans speak German through the film.  I like it, but that does not bring the cardboard characters to life.",1108944000,17,2129,4.891364902506964
2117017,4,B0002S94G6,"Having NOT seen this in a theater, as it was only released on DVD in the U.S., I can only comment on the DVD version.  I have seen half of it in English (in which Germans are speaking excellent English), and all of it dubbed in German (released in Germany, with no subtitles).  There, of course, the Americans are speaking German all too well.

This film must be taken for what it is, I think.  A showcase for W.H. Macy (his acting is not superficial, nor are his interactions with his wife, whom he had to leave as Chief on the U.S.S. Swordfish).  Sure, the numbers and names of ships are all wrong. Did NO Kapitn-Leutnant serve underwater with his blue tunic on, as suggested by one reviewer?  This is a good introduction to Til Schweiger, who really is of matinee-idol stature and appearance, as Captain of one U-Boat, and the first watch officer (Thomas Kretschmann) really shows his acting talents....compeletely different in Stalingrad, The Pianist, U-571.  Perhaps Mr. Macy was not challenged by the role, and the meningitis outbreak is unbelieveable....but aren't movies unbelieveable.  Do they not require suspension of disbelief, even the best?

I did not expect the Barry Lyndon of U-Boat movies.  The sets are too wide, the U.S. sub is too brightly lit...but the ""best set"" film has been done (Das Boot) and took a year to film (see the Director's Cut DVD).  Other criticisms are hollow...the flag, the seaman appearing to wear a modern German Navy tunic (I have seen them, I do not think so, but it is a brief shot.  At least no one is wearing Chuck Taylor sneakers!  And the back and forth between Macy and Kretschmann (Captaincy shifting back and forth depending on the conditions and likelihood of being captured by Americans or Germans--all within a few hundrend miles of the U.S. coast (which is realistic)...ending with Kretschmann ending up as a P.O.W. with the guarantee of living past the war, which was the intention of the Captain played by Til Schweiger.

All in all, it may not be historically accurate, but is a drama set in wartime, with some atypical themes (German taking prisoners against orders), some suspense...you want more from a film that did not get theatre release?  I recommend it, but of course it is not a chick flick (probably an un-PC statement although commonly used), but it might become one because of Til Schweiger!  So see it!",1105315200,24,2375,4.7560975609756095
2117018,1,B0002S94G6,"Wow. This movie was a big disappointment. Acting was shallow and overall very poor, even with otherwise fine actors such as William Macy and Thomas Kretschmann (starred as German officer in ""The Pianist""). One does not gain any insight into the German or American crewmembers lives or personalities, despite a few very brief segways into the backgrounds & mindset of the German captain and U.S. crew chief, acting was stiff and superficial. Special effects were poorly done, mostly computer generated sequences that gave the movie's combat scenes a kind of video-game quality. Moreover, several ridiculous historical inaccuracies served to spoil the movie even more: crewman smoking on the submerged subs, German U-Boot officers serving in full dress uniform on sub duty w/swastika flags flying in the background, devious Nazi crewmen vs. heroic Americans, etc. At one point it even appears that one of the U-Boat crewman was wearing a uniform/tunic of the modern German army.

If one enjoyed movies such as ""U571"" or ""Pearl Harbor,"" this might be fun to watch - but if you're looking for a serious war movie and gain a new perspective on the war in the Atlantic or sunmarine warfare in general, this isn't it.",1101600000,5,1210,5.05
2117019,3,B0002S94G6,"Unfortunately, I have to add a 3rd negative review.  I am legally blind and don't get out to theatres.  I see all new film when they come out on DVD (and dhown on a big screen TV)..

I have no memory of the theatrical release of this movie, so I didn't know what to expect.  I DID expect a good performance from William H. Macy.  I don't know why this incredible actor isn't a major star, but always shines in supporting roles, like this one, playing the Chief of the Boat who has to fill in for his wounded captain.  The problem here is a weak script and lackluster direction.  No true sence of tension was ever developed.  This is just a standard, WWII sub movie.  In fact, they did them better DURING WWII.  Footage was also purchased from the movie U-571, which is a dead giveaway that this movie was done on the cheap.

The DVD transfer is very good; good picture and excellent sound.  Both help a little in keeping your attention.  It's a good rental, but I wouldn't want to own a copy.  I already have U-571, plus that great WWII naval drama, THE ENEMY BELOW with Robert Mitchum.",1099094400,,1086,4.311881188118812
2117020,3,B0002S94G6,"It's funny, because outside the US this movie was already released in DVD (with no extras at all). It's an average sub-thriller, with good perfomances. Macy is credible plays a woman, it's a great character actor). The weak factor is Scott Caan (son of James Caan). He tries his best, but his acting skill have ample room for improvent. (what is agood thing, since he's a young actor - only 27 years old).

In the good side, an actor who made a great increase in performance quality was Til Schweiger, from the obnoxious DRIVEN (Stallone's flop of 2001). He's very convincing as the German U-Boat captain who lost all desire to continue war after he receives the new that her daughters were killed by a night bombing in Hamburg.

A flaw in script's development was s mysterious plague of meningitis that kills a lot of people, but all of a sudden it's gone, no one mentions it anymore!

In general, the movie is enjoyable to watch in the comfort of your room (it does not deserve a trip to the theater!), and of course the Americans win...",1097884800,3,1039,4.545454545454546
2117028,3,B0002S94G6,"Some of the acting was very good, but some of it was quite awkward. The dialog and emotions between the COB and his wife were disjointed and unrealistic. The German saboteur was realistic, perhaps, but not believable. Caan's acting felt forced, which is a shame because I've seen better from him. German captain and XO's acting, dialog and moral dilemma were actually quite believable and good.",1515024000,2,394,4.984848484848484

2117031,5,B0002S94G6,"Some reviewers stated that this type of event is not likely to have ever happened during war. While I understand that view, you also must be careful about stereotyping people and just dismissing them all out of hand. Many people on both sides of any war can see the enemy as a person and we should.  Wars are about protecting our own people and beliefs, not hating other people. While I don't believe in pie in the sky, i.e., everyone disarm and we'll all live together and be safe and happy together, I also know that not every single person on ""the other side"" is evil. Some are just as much a prisoner of their government or regime as captured combatants. All that being said, I think this movie considers that sometimes people can overcome their opposing views and see each other as people and work together. As some reviewers stated, U571 (a fabulous movie that I watch often) is a more probable scenario in war, the premise in this movie can't be completely dismissed as having possibly happened many times in the wars that have been fought and are being fought.  For example, we have indigenous people working with our troops overseas to aid in our war efforts there and this assistance is invaluable.  While we can't stick our heads in the sand, we always should be diligent, we should also be aware of and looking for the opportunity to find those people who have good in them and are willing to work for a better future.  I enjoyed this movie as a good story and as a reminder that you don't know what people have inside them just by seeing the outside. So, there you have my movie review and a little speech on my soapbox with it.",1514160000,,1641,4.46

2117042,4,B0002S94G6,"I'd really like to give this movie 4.5 stars -- not perfect, but very thought-provoking.  I watched it for the first time 2 weeks ago and haven't stopped thinking about it since.  I'll be re-watching this movie multiple times, like a good book.

I won't summarize the plot, since that's already been done well by others, except to mention that while it sounds like the American submarine commander (Scott Caan) was entirely at fault for the spread of meningitis, actually it was already spreading.  Scott Caan's character wasn't kind about it, but it would have spread throughout the crew(s) in any case.  Crowded quarters, and the first crewman to catch it hid his symptoms until it was too late to contain it.

I can't compare this movie to other WWII submarine movies since I have seen so few.  I watched this movie for only two reasons:  Scott Caan is in it (I'm a huge admirer of his work on the Hawaii Five-0 TV series) and the plot sounded compelling.  I wasn't familiar with any of the other stars in this movie, but that's no reflection on their quality, only that I don't watch very many movies and TV shows.  The quality of the acting was superb, especially William Macy as the American Chief of Boat and the German captain and first officer.  Marvelous acting!  Scott Caan was excellent, too, though his role was smaller than I expected.  He is more than good enough to be a leading man of a movie or TV series, but he didn't get to show his very best work because I feel that the most meaty part of the movie began once the German and American crews had to start working together, and Scott Caan's character was barely involved by then.

I don't see this as an anti-war movie, or a criticism of American culture or values.  It's a character study, and asks you to think about motivations, personal integrity, decency, mercy, hope...  The only real ""bad guys"" in this movie were those crew members who were never willing to stop hating and start recognizing each other as fellow human beings instead of just ""German"" or ""American"" chess pieces.  War is very peculiar in that when you haven't personally met the enemy and it's necessary to do battle, you have to do your job even if it means killing.  But once you meet each other as people and for whatever reason you don't have to fight anymore, you might actually become friends, which is what happens at the end between the American Chief of Boat (William Macy) and the German first officer.",1472688000,,2456,4.581235697940503

2117149,4,B0002S94G6,"While it was a little unbelievable, it was entertaining. The story line was unusual but it worked. I would have had pneumonia be the disease, not meningitis. Oh well... As for accuracy, I am sure some submariners will criticize it, but for the rest of us it was fine. It is very difficult to live up to the classic WWII submarine films with the best being ""Das Boot"".

Somewhere, I read that this film was loosely based upon a true story. However, it is a fictional tale of enemies becoming one in working to save themselves. In that, it was remarkable and as some have mentioned, was a very good anti-war film.

There was once a POW camp close to where I live and my parents told me that it held some German submariners during the war. It was rumored that they were allowed to do outside work under strict supervision, but I cannot corroborate that claim. However, relatives once said the Germans were very happy to be out of the war and enjoyed their time here in the middle of the US. I wonder how many actually stayed here following the war?

In reality, only a few U-boats were ever captured by the USN and in a case or two, were actually able to snag an Enigma machine and some German Navy documents. It would have been suicidal to get within 100 miles of the US coast, but a few U-boats did when they snuck spies into the US earlier in our involvement in the war, which resulted in all of the spies being captured. I believe all were executed, but I am not sure.

This film is entertaining and has quite a cast of excellent actors. It is a shame that it was never marketed in theaters in the US, as the general public missed a chance to see a very good film.",1438819200,,1665,4.276190476190476

2117166,4,B0002S94G6,"In Enemy Hands is a very powerful movie about war and respect.

William H. Macy stars as the Chief of the Boat (COB) of USS Swordfish.  Swordfish, out on patrol in WWII, has its crew fall under meningitis.  In a fight with a German U-boat, Swordfish is mostly destroyed and the crew abandons at sea only to be picked up by the same U-boat (U-429) who took her under.

The XO (Second in Command) of Swordfish had the disease and owing to an order from the new, young CO, was required to status his watch station during battle.  Subsequently, he passed the meningitis on to other members of the crew.  Being taking aboard 429, the sick crewmen eventually pass it on to the German sailors.

The real story is how the two crews eventually had to work with each other in order to stay alive.  Macy's character is a realist.  He wants his crew to survive and the only way to do so it through cooperation.

This is a very well acted movie on all parts.  The Germans who tolerate the Americans as well as the Germans who do not.  That goes equally for the Americans who tolerate the Germans and those who do not.  They are all believable.",1436745600,6,1130,4.349282296650718

It has it's errors and such, but it is a good ""movie."" William H. Macy is always great as a character actor, here as the Chief of the American boat. The German officers were better actors in this flick than their American counterparts.  I'm a big fan of James Caan, but his son Scott was not convincing as the American captain of his sub.  Scott's acting got better as his character got ill, but his performance early on in the movie was not very good.  He is young however, maybe this was simply one of his first lead roles?

From the degree of plausibility, it fails both on the medical and military points-of view.  The set design is unremarkable,  The cinematography doesn't escape television quality.  The characters are flat.  Even Macy isn't allowed to realize the full potential of the stupidity of his character, which is role he performs so well in so many other films: the well-meaning idiot.

Others have written here that they see this as a highly ideological film, a pacificist statement with a degree of nazi apologism.  I don't think the script or film-makers have shown themselves to be smart enough to pull such a thing off.

2117248,5,B0002S94G6,"Synopsis: Starring William H. Macy, Til Schweiger, Scott Caan and Lauren Holly, among other notable actors, this movie is set during World War II when Hitler's Germany was turning out U-boats by the tens of thousands. The Americans and the British had one goal: to put the innumerable U-boats out of commission. Aboard an American submarine, disease breaks out and then the boat is destroyed by a German sub. Going against protocol, the German captain takes the surviving Americans on board. Disease and sub damage force the Americans and the Germans into an unlikely alliance, and no one knows whether they'll make it out alive - or whose side will kill them all first.

This was a very different role than I'd seen Scott Caan in to date. For one, this wasn't an indie film, and after watching so many of those (mostly his) as well as a lifetime of watching studio pictures, I've gotten so I can tell the difference now just by sitting through a minute or two.

This was a kick-ass movie.

Mr. Caan plays a Naval officer commanding a U.S. sub during World War II. It turns out one of his men has meningitis, and he contracts it. Then his sub, the Swordfish, comes under enemy attack and is destroyed. Only a handful of his men survive, but the captain's fading fast, dying from the disease.

I have to admit, I had a tough time believing someone so young would be in command of a sub during wartime with the first scene where Mr. C.'s wearing the dress whites. However, once we were on-board the sub with him, it really worked. It was like he came alive on that set, and between his and William H. Macy's performance as the Chief of Boat...along with the rest of the cast...I was hooked.

Full of action, full of the critical human elements that make you care about both sides no matter which side you might have supported had you been alive back then, the movie delivers in a serious way.

**SPOILER ALERT**
I have to admit that I heaved a long-suffering sigh when I realized Mr. Caan's character was going to die. I thought, Does he die in, like, every movie he's in? Well, no, he doesn't. But someone significant always seems to in the ones I've seen! However, I was pleasantly surprised by the manner in which he did eventually go, because at least it was a heroic death!

There was a great line delivered by the captain of the German U429: ""To save a life instead of taking it away, that's power."" I liked that.

Because my focus is to talk about how the movies made me feel...what my gut-reaction to them is rather than sounding like a professional movie critic (which I will never be), I have to say the movie at times made me teary, at times got my adrenaline going and at times left me breathless.

It was quite refreshing to see Mr. Caan in a role like this, and amused me a little to think that here, years later (this movie came out in '04), he's now on a show where it's the other guy who dons the dress whites and is in the Navy.

Some other points of interest for me were other members of the cast whom I recognized from other TV shows such as Lauren Holly from NCIS, A.J. Buckley and Carmine Giovinazzo from ""CSI: NY"" and Jeremy Sisto from ""Law & Order."" This film was filled with a who's who of television actors.

I highly recommend this if you like action, war movies, subs or just the actors involved. It is a damn fine movie.

Oh, and guess what? An actor by the name of Ian Somerhalder is in this movie, too, for you fans of ""The Vampire Diaries.""",1320883200,2,3470,4.396255850234009
2117249,4,B0002S94G6,"Warning: plot spoilers. William Macy gives us a credible role as the COB (Chief of the Boat) on an American submarine during WWII. The COB is the highest ranking enlisted man and is typically the voice of reason, controlling young brash officers, such as the captain of this boat. We contrast his ""driver: style to that of the likable easy going U-Boat captain. The action takes place off the coast of the US in 1943 as U-Boats are sinking US ships. In this case, the American and German sub meet, and exchange torpedoes. The German sub is destroyed and American is damaged and sinking. During the attack the XO dies from meningitis, which he was nice enough to have shared with the captain. As fate would have it, there was a second U-boat in the area and the remaining American crew are picked up and held prisoner. The meningitis spreads and 2/3's of the German crew die. The German supply boat never shows up.

The captain of the U-Boat decides he needs to use the Americans to survive. His plan is to work together and head for the US shore and surrender as their only hope to survive. Macy, who by now is the American leader, and really wants to see his wife again, agrees to the Germans and Americans working together. The crew develops respect for each other, except for a hand full of Tea Party followers, filled with hate from listening to Hitler and Glenn Beck decide otherwise. (Okay, I am just kidding about Hitler.)

Predictable-yes. What I liked about the movie is that in spite of the cheap scenes, they stayed fairly accurate to sub life in general. Diesel boats would surface at night to recharge the battery running the diesel and then during the day run submerged on the battery.

The movie is fine for people who have been on subs such as myself, although I would knock off a star for most of you who haven't.",1295827200,3,1830,4.522658610271903
2117250,2,B0002S94G6,"In Enemy Hands is a strange movie. It's a film about an outbreak of Meningitis on an American sub in WW2, followed by a battle with a German sub in which infected US survivors are taken on board as prisoners, and the infection spreads to the German crew members. As more and more people drop, the remaining Germans and Americans must try to work together as they find themselves caught between a U.S. destroyer and another German sub.

The film stars William Macy and Scott Caan with Til Schweiger, Clark Gregg, Jeremy Sisto, Lauren Holly, Xander Berkeley, and Carmine Giovinazzo.

William Macy made a career out of small character roles from 1978 to 1996 when his appearance in ""Fargo"" earned him nominations for virtually every award out there. Subsequently he earned a fist full of Emmy and Screen Actor Guild nominations and wins. Personally I liked him best in ""The Cooler"" (2003).

Scott Caan (1976) is best known for his recurring roles as Dano in ""Hawaii Five-O"" (2010) and Scott Lavin in ""Entourage"" (2009-10). He's the son of James Caan

Til Schweiger (1963) has been in more than 50 films, mostly foreign language. He played Sgt. Stiglitz in ""Inglorious Basterds"" (2009) and Cynric in ""King Arthur"" (2004).

Clark Gregg (1962) is best known for his recurring roles as the ex-husband in ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"" (2006-10) and Agent Michael Casper in ""The West Wing"" (2001-4). He's married to Jennifer Grey.

Jeremy Sisto (1974) is best known for his recurring roles as Detective Lupo in ""Law and Order"" (2007-10) and Billy Chenowith in ""Six Feet Under"" (2001-5).

Xander Berkeley (1955) has been in nearly 200 films and TV programs. He's best known for his continuing roles as the evil Percy in ""Nikita"" (2010), Sheriff Atwater in ""CSI"" (2003-4), and George Mason in ""24"" (2001-3).

Carmine Giovinazzo (1973) is best known for his continuing role as Danny Messer on ""CSI:NY"" (2004-10) and is the only actor to have been in all three CSI series.

Lauren Holly (1963) is best known for her recurring roles as NCIS Director Jenny Shepherd from ""NCIS"" (2005-8) and as Maxine Stewart in ""Picket Fences"" (1992-6). She appeared in ""Dumb and Dumber"" (1994) with Jim Carrey and they were married from 1996-7.

Writer-Director Tony Giglio has made 5 films, none of them particularly memorable.

As far as submarine movies go, nothing can beat Robert Mitchum and Curt Jergens in ""The Enemy Below"" (1957). Other notable contributions to this genre include ""U-571"" (2000), ""Das Boot"" (1981), ""The Hunt for Red October"" (1990), ""Crimson Tide"" (1995) and ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" (1958). This film doesn't challenge any of them.",1290211200,,2634,4.950113378684807
2117251,2,B0002S94G6,"This story is well overdone, a story of enemies having to work together to survive?

Having said that there was not even a pretence of trying to make the story realistic. A ww2 German u-boat was an incredible dirty place. Sailors had beards, the director could have made an effort to make the setting more realistic. Furthermore, I doubt very much that a US crew could work without considerable training a German U-boat.

Finally, the ending of the American crew betraying their country because their officer made a promise, I found extremely unrealistic.",1281744000,,555,4.956989247311828
2117252,1,B0002S94G6,"I blame myself for not taking the clue of the title, ""In Enemy Hands.""  Yep, just like a submarine gliding beneath the surface into your worldview, the mission of this propaganda film is to promote a ""let's just be nice"" attitude toward our ""enemies.""

What ""Hunt For Red October"" tried to do with the minds of Americans toward the kind-hearted, well-meaning Russians, ""In Enemy Hands"" tries to do with our minds toward those regular-guy, would-be brothers who happened to be born in Germany in the Hitler era.  I should have seen it coming, from the early scenes of the (albeit subtitled) German dialogue.  The producers of this subversive film make every effort possible to show us that the Nazis didn't really want to be mean to us, and that they really only torpedoed a U.S. ship if it was mean to them first.  Come on guys!  Can't we just get along?  Let's all realize that if it wasn't for those nasty war-minded few, we would all be great brothers!

Even the cowardly American sub-crew who were taken captive (by the kind-hearted Nazi submarine captain) had to be shown (by the makers of the film) that their fears of being mistreated by Germans were entirely misguided.

Shoot, can't you see the love in the teary eyes of the Nazi captain when he chokes up over the news that his daughter's school was bombed (""with no survivors"")?  And if you get really on board with this movie, you'll realize that it was us mean Americans who did all of the bad things in the WW2!

Oh, and by the way, no, WW2 was not ""over"" in 1943 as the actors claimed throughout.  Lemme see, I seem to remember a couple of bombs going off in August of 1945 on Japan.

As for the casting, I guess that for the ""hero"" in this anti-military media effort, they had to find an actor who is best at being a wimpy bit-player.  William C. Macy sticks out in my mind as the dorky principal in Mr. Holland's Opus, the annoying bean-counter in A Civil Action, the insecure worry-wart dad-of-a-loser in Searching For Bobby Fischer, and the only forgetable character in John Grisham's The Client.

Why did the writers choose the disease of meningitis?  Along with the not-so-subtle title message of being in the loving hands of the Nazis, I think they chose this disease because it sounds like ""men in crisis.""  And of course, the crisis is having to admit that we have thought of Nazis in such undeservedly ugly ways.

And if I may ask one more question; why make this film in 2004?  My guess is that ""In Enemy Hands"" is really aimed at our present-day mean view of those kind-hearted, well-meaning Muslims around the world who only blow themselves up around dissenting men, women and children because Americans have been so mean and unkind to them first.

This film deserves a full depth charge.",1187654400,4,2766,4.583333333333333
2117253,1,B0002S94G6,"Didn't believe there could be a worse film than U-571 until I saw this one.

Scenes are pretty good. Costuming very period. They used a real submarine and they used real germans.

 Acting is very low quality. Plot is dragging and dull. Diolog just dies. Spoken devoid of spirit. Other than the German captain and his exxo, none of the characters is really interesting.

Really pathetic this one.",1176508800,5,395,4.764705882352941
2117254,1,B0002S94G6,"This is an unbelievable movie. Let's get this straight, Macy makes a promise that he will not take the ENIGMA machine to the Nazi commander, and then keeps his word by scuttling the ship.  This is a true version of Hollywood's idea of a hero.  A man betrays his country for his friendship with the German, nevermind the thousands of American and British sailors possession of the ENIGMA would save, nevermind defeating the most brutal dictator and mass murderer in history (Stalin's and Mao's mass murders hadn't happened yet), Macy's loyalty is to his new German ""ally"" (lover?).  His actions are not believable.  In reality, if Macy did act in this manner, his crew would probably have killed him, or at least subdued him and turned him in for treason along with the ENIGMA device.

To the guy who rated this 5 stars and said most won't get this movie (typical Liberal elitist), we get it, we just don't like it.

Typical Hollywood anti-war drivel, adequate acting, weak plot, poor writing, unimaginative Leftist propaganda...Barbara Streisand's version of WWII.",1145145600,13,1064,4.949438202247191
2117255,3,B0002S94G6,"In 2000's U571, the Americans attacked a German UBoat and eventually their boat got destroyed and so they had to us the German boat. In this one, the German's attack the American sub when it was doing pratice dives and eventually the German's take the remaining American survives aboard and hold them hostage. Things happen when some German soldiers get out of hand attacking the Americans and some of the German's actually try to blow up the ship after the German captain has the American's help them get back home. Not bad submarine movie has its moments and the cast has some excellent stars and young stars which gives this movie the power it needs. There are some cheesy moments (actress Lauren Holly (Dumb & Dumber, Down Periscope) for one thing) but it was a decent enough ride. I would say in a different style then U571, not like it (but it did feel like it sorta). The excellent cast includes the superb William H. Macy (The Cooler, Stealing Sinatra), Scott Caan (A Boy Named Hate, Into The Blue), Til Schweiger (Driven, Barefoot), a solid Thomas Kretschmann (Immortal, King Kong), Clark Gregg (We Were Soldiers), Ian Somerhalder (Tv's LOST, upcoming Pulse), Jeremy Sisto (Wrong Turn, Suicide Kings), AJ Buckley (Wishcraft, The Forsaken), Chris Ellis (Con Air, Crimson Tide), Sam Huntington (Rolling Kansas, Detroit Rock City) and Xander Berkeley (North Country, Fox's 24).",1145059200,5,1383,4.9655172413793105
