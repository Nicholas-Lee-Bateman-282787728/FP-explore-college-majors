8037830,5,B00063H42S,"Best Kept Secrets is based on real life events and is an amalgam of the activities of an Arizona Police Department and the Albuquerque Police Department.  For reference,  the viewer can obtain background information from the US District Court,  Denver Colorado, specifically the case  Joseph Riggs, III et al v. City of Albuquerque, et al,  US District Court Case No. CIV 88-1141SG.  This movie details the rogue activities on an ""Intelligence Unit"" in a Southwestern Police Department, which is clearly out of control, in searching out ""enemies"". Patty Duke Astin plays the wife of an Intelligence Unit Police Officer.  The  Albuquerque P.D. Intelligence Unit conducted campaigns of harassment, intimidation, dirty tricks, character assassination, etc. against members of the ACLU, NAACP, New Mexico Lawyers' Guild, and Community Activists because the Intelligence Unit considered them ""enemies"" of the Albuquerque Police Department.  Headed at the time by Joseph M. Polisar, a former Long Island, NY taxi driver, 59.4% of the files maintained by the Albuquerque Police Intelligence Unit were on NON-CRIMINALS who were simply classified as  ""personae non grata"" by the Albuquerque P.D. The Albuquerque Police Department eventually settled this lawsuit after fighting it for 7 years, and paid out a cash award to Plaintiffs, attorneys' fees, and (don't laugh now) was placed under the supervision of the LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT for 5 years (of Ramparts infamy).  The Albuquerque Police Department agreed to also disband the Intelligence Unit, but it was
reinstated under Chief Joseph M. Polisar, who had previously headed the unit, in 1995.  Joseph M. Polisar, who was picked to be Chief of the Albuquerque Police Department by former ""Mayor-for-Life"" Martin J. Chavez, in July 1994, was one of the CHIEF DEFENDANTS in  Van Bering Robinson v. Maruffi, Polisar, Kramer and Hansen, US District Court, for the District of New Mexico, Case No. CIV 84-1216M,  Memorandum Opinion and Order dated 13 January 1986.  Polisar and his co-defendants were found to have framed an African-American Man, Robinson, for the murder of Police Officer Phil Chacon.  Robinson served 29 months on death row before he was acquitted first by a State Jury and then a Federal Jury and Judge in the instant case, awarded $75,000. plus attorney fees.  Within 1 MONTH of being appointed Albuquerque Chief of Police by Mayor Martin J. Chavez, a lawsuit was filed by 21 Hispanic Police Officers against Joseph M. Polisar and the City of Albuquerque for all sorts of civil rights violations of Hispanic Officers' rights and the rights of Hispanic arrestees.
Gilbert Najar et al v. City of Albuquerque et al,  US District Court, for the District of New Mexico,  Case No.  94-0837M.  This movie just goes into SOME of the activities of the Arizona police department in question and the Albuquerque Police Department.  Suggested supplemental viewing:  ""A Case of Deadly Force""  with Richard Crenna,  ""The Star Chamber"" with Michael Douglas,
""Internal Affairs"" with Andy Garcia, ""Street Kings"", and ""Prince of the City"" with Treat Williams.",1285977600,,3110,5.285132382892057
