5037562,5,B006YWIFH8,"I absolutely loved this! Maybe it's because I seen it live so I knew what to expect? My brother only laughed once through the whole thing, while I was laughing hysterically. Mostly they tell stories of things that happen in their lives in this one. It makes me wish I knew them personally because life would be entertaining every single day. I guess it depends on what you find funny on if you'll like this or not.",1334534400,,414,4.3896103896103895

5037624,4,B006YWIFH8,"While this was not quite as good as the Blue Color Tours they did, still it was funny and entertaining.  Ron White had been part of their early group, but his style was more for adults only type performances so he didn't quite fit in.  But the others were loads of fun.  Bill Engvall, usually my favorite, has slipped a little and this time it was Jeff Foxworthy who really stood out.  Of course the three of them really appear to have fun together in their closing scenes as they sit together on their stools and adlib together.  It is a good fun watch if your into down home humor.",1419552000,,583,4.263636363636364

5037650,4,B006YWIFH8,"This is hilarious, as expected -- I'd say it's not as good as the Blue Collar Comedy Tour videos, but it can hold it's own.  I expected a little more ""funny"" from Bill Engvall -- and as usual, Jeff Foxworthy stole the show -- I was literally rolling on the floor laughing his routine was that funny.  If Bill had had a better routine, I'd have given it a ""5"" -- Larry the Cable Guy was his usual funny self -- but I'm not always impressed with his humor...",1400371200,,456,4.112359550561798

And I won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen it, but Jeff Foxworthy talking about his colonoscopy is one of the most hilarious things I have ever heard. I was rolling out of my seat.",1364083200,,297,4.137931034482759
5037679,5,B006YWIFH8,"Put together Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy and you have a riotous evening of fun.  We enjoyed this latest in the Blue Collar series.",1361836800,,155,4.535714285714286

5037681,2,B006YWIFH8,"sorry,, but it's not even close to the status of the blue collar tour videos.. that one dude,,Bill engval ,, isn't even funny,,he really sucks.. Larry and Jeff where ok....",1361145600,,172,4.766666666666667
5037682,5,B006YWIFH8,"What else can be said. This is awesome, but it wasn't long enough. I really like them without Ron White.  Bill and Jeff routines were totall awesome!!! I laughed so hard. Larry was a little flat but i still like him.  Buy all of the Blue Collar you can find, make some pop corn and laugh a Friday night away,",1359417600,,308,4.116666666666666
5037683,4,B006YWIFH8,I bought this for my father who is a blue collar comedy fan. He seemed quite happy even thought he's seen them in concert as well.,1358899200,,130,4.038461538461538
5037684,5,B006YWIFH8,What do you get for a father that has or had everything and spends all his time in front of the TV? This video appears to be one from the Foxworthy crew that I haven't seen or heard of before so I bought it for him. My experience with the purchase and delivery were as promised. I won't hold you to anything he might say.,1358726400,,321,3.953846153846154
5037685,5,B006YWIFH8,Great to see these guys back again!!  We had a lot of laughs.  Too bad Ron White wasn't on it.,1358380800,,94,3.65
5037686,5,B006YWIFH8,I loved it because we love any thing with jeff foxworthy in is as well as Larry the cable guy. So I also rated it 5 satar because it was the funniest movie I have presinly seen in a long time.,1358121600,,192,3.707317073170732
5037687,5,B006YWIFH8,These guys are the funniest. They do some of the stupidest things but they are hilarious no less. You watch this and you will be laughing for hours!,1357862400,,148,4.321428571428571
5037688,4,B006YWIFH8,About what you would expect from this bunch of nuts :)  Another solid performance but probably on the lower end as far as their other DVDs.  Audio and video is both good.,1357689600,,170,4.28125
5037689,3,B006YWIFH8,"We thought this would be better but it was kind of lame. It's still funny though, but not as good as the originals",1357084800,,114,4.0
5037690,4,B006YWIFH8,"I was hoping for the same level of comedy as the previous Blue Collar DVD's. I was a little disappointed. Not a fan of Larry the Cable Guy, wish they would have had Ron White instead. It seemed like most of their jokes consisted of turning 50. Still enjoyed Bill Engval and Jeff Foxworthy, just didn't laugh nearly as much.",1356393600,,323,4.4
5037691,5,B006YWIFH8,These guys can just keep you rolling This is one of the best ones I have ordered I never get tired of watching them If you are in a bad mood just pop this in the dvd and you won't be long,1356048000,,187,3.4761904761904763

5037693,4,B006YWIFH8,"Love them guys. It always nice to see Jeff foxworthy, Bill Engvall, and Larry the cable guy. This was good as well but Larry was not as good in this release.",1354924800,3,157,4.096774193548387
5037694,4,B006YWIFH8,"Ron White is missing from this line up. It make it a bit different. They have a ""host"" named Reno that does a minor routine - he still needs polish.  Bill, Jeff and Larry are more family oriented than ever - and it is appreciated. Hard to not like Them Idiots. Sorry Ron, you are missed, but not sorely......",1354665600,2,308,4.220338983050848
5037695,5,B006YWIFH8,"Another great show, similar to the Blue Collar Tour

Great stand-up routines from Americas funniest comedians.

5037699,3,B006YWIFH8,Without Ron White it just not the same. He really did not fit in with the others type of comedy and the fans they attracted. Dont get me wrong i really liked their Red Neck Comedy shows (all 3 of them). But its time to move on like Ron did.,1344729600,,240,3.82
5037700,3,B006YWIFH8,"I thought this was so-so, but I was really disappointed by Bill. He is usually my fave of all of them, but he just seemed so uppity. Seriously making fun of minimum wage workers? Not funny. Jeff was great as usual and it is hard for me to watch Larry without thinking he really doesn't talk like that so I am always trying to catch him slipping. It was ok, but not as good as the last one.",1341964800,10,389,4.0
