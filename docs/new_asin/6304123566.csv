7862170,3,6304123566,"A thoroughly enjoyable kid-friendly movie, with keen acting and great costumes. The film has a light campy feel similar to that embraced by many Alice in Wonderland films.  I recently purchased the VHS for this and its sequel (Magic in the Mirror: Fowl Play) as I had remembered seeing this movie years ago and had at that time been impressed how the villains could still convey emotion well while the actors had half their face covered with a moving duck bill. Yes the villains are ducks (or rather Drakes) who seek to take over the world so they can turn all the people into tea (seeped for 60 seconds).

I'll summarize the plot since I don't see it in the item description, so please note the rest of my post is full of spoilers (so many in fact that you probably won't need to buy the video after reading this - which I thought okay to do here since this remains only available in VHS).

Our young heroine, Mary Margaret, finds her way through an old mirror to the Mirror World where she encounters Mirror Minder Tansey and his boss Mirror Master Melilot. Together they travel to meet Queen Hysop to explain how the mirror had been breached, while trying to avoiding the Drakes.  Mary Margaret had used some Mirror Berries she found in our world to cross over to Mirror World, and our group had to prevent the Drakes from getting these berries in order to save the People World.  Unfortunately the Drakes attack our heroes on route to the queen and stole the berries.  They try to capture our heroes as well in order to boil them for tea, but the heroes escape.  The Drakes attempt to find the exact Mirror that Mary Margaret used to cross over, while our heroes continue on to the Queen to warn her of the threat. Their audience with the Queen does not go well, and Mary Margaret is left to save both worlds by preventing the Drakes from crossing to the People World herself.

While Mary Margaret has been in Mirror World, her parents were looking for her at home, and found the mirror in her room still showed Mirror World.  Not having Mirror Berries themselves, they couldn't cross over to get Mary Margaret. Dad goes to find Mirror Berries, but when he finds them he trips and drops all but one down the house's floor-vent. Mary Margaret's mother is a physicist who had just succeeded in created a machine that gives split-second access to alternate dimensions, so mom was attempting to use that new machine on the mirror. The Drakes follow Mary Margaret to her mirror and use the Mirror Berries to cross to the People World just as mom's machine hits the glass, throwing the Drakes back to Mirror world, along with Mary Margaret and her mom.  Queen Hysop frees both Tansey and Melilot congratulating Mary Margaret for her success as a mirror minder.  Mary Margaret and her Mom return home using what they think is the last of the Mirror Berries.  The audience is then shown that in the house's basement, the Mirror Berries that Dad had dropped ended up falling through a hole in the piping and onto an open bag of potting soil.",1344902400,,3036,4.530164533820841

I LOVE this movie, and it was my FAVORITE when I was little.  I used to love nothing more than helping my mom and grandfather in the garden, so I loved the flowers and nature in this film.

If your buying this for your children, they will remember this movie for a long time, like I did!",1322956800,,438,3.78021978021978
7862172,5,6304123566,"Well, I am a mom of two little girls (ages 6 & 7), and we all love this movie. It is so entertaining, and the little girl in the film is a great role model for kids of all ages -- very independent, feisty and smart! I don't watch movies much, but when I see one I really like (like this one), I feel it only right to say something about it for other parents and kids. I found this one at my local video store and my kids watch it at least twice a year. The actors are great, the story line is entertaining, and the costumes magical. With all of the trash out there being made for kids, you won't want to miss this one. Enjoy! P.S. If you are looking for quality family movies, a couple of my other family favorites are ""The Three Little Pigs"" starring Billy Crystal & Jeff Goldblum (so funny!) and the animated movie, ""Kiki's Delivery Service"".",1036454400,,844,4.152439024390244
