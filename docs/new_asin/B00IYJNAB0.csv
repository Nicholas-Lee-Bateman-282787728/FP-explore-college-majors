8646381,3,B00IYJNAB0,"I picked this up in the hopes it would strike that magical balance of entertaining our toddlers (age 4) and making the parents smile.  And while I found a lot of funny stuff in it it veered too far on the adult side and was often too scary for our girls.

It's a good show and might be worth revisiting at a later date but for now it goes back on the shelf.",1490745600,,357,3.8767123287671232
