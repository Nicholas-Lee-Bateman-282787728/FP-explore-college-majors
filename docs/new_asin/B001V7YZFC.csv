8345736,5,B001V7YZFC,"They compare this to law and order.... but I say it is ""Criminal Minds"" mixed with Law and Order.  Why the PBS stations do not have this on their schedule is their loss.  They are finding out the British shows are their bread and butter but don't bring the tried and true to our televisions for viewing. Some scenes are very graphic, but does not take away from the quality of the show.  Personally, if you are comparing this to the Law and Order in recent years.... there is no comparison.  This is much, much, much better.  That's how I feel and I now have all the Episodes....",1398297600,,579,4.324074074074074
8345737,4,B001V7YZFC,"I've been watching all the episodes in order, and I think it's a superior series. I found the split-screen format distracting at first, but I've gotten used to it. Well-acted and well-written.

One of the episodes in Set 3 features an American criminal profiler, and the actor who plays the part sounds like an American. (Sometimes in British series, there are problems with this.) However, there are a few minor errors in the script. For example, no American would use the expression ""bin bag."" He would say ""trash bag."" He also would refer to newspaper ""clippings,"" not ""cuttings.""",1355184000,3,583,4.948979591836735
8345738,5,B001V7YZFC,"all the sets are excellent you can not go wrong with buying this series. Suspenseful,enjoyable,and exciting. It is worth the money. It is too bad they do not have mant programs like this.",1351123200,,187,4.696969696969697
8345739,5,B001V7YZFC,"Extraordinary combination of engrossing plots, character evolution across episodes, superb acting. David Hayman is an actor of the first rank. Effective use of split screens, such as showing details of a crime scene while witness is describing the scene. My wife and I are mid-way through Season 3, and we have already purchased Seasons 4 and 5.",1345420800,2,345,5.0701754385964914
8345740,5,B001V7YZFC,This series is one of the best I have seen.  It beats anything the US has of this genre.  Acting is believable and the writing is top notch,1340841600,,139,3.9285714285714284
8345741,4,B001V7YZFC,"By now, if you have viewed the first 4 episodes, you are aware of DCS Mike Walker and his colleague and, now lover, DCI, Pat North.  It is inexplicable to me how they have maintained their relationship. But, then again, it seems to be unraveling.

The quality of this series remains very high. The cases are all original, however, one or two seem to be representative of real life crimes, shown elsewhere.  The acting is superb,  the police procedurals very realistic, and the courtroom scenes are usually spell binding.  The actors are well known, and I can guess that the high quality of the writing and the filming attracts well known stars.

We now know that DCS Michael Walker is a murderer, thief and philanderer. But, this seems to be an attraction to some. Exit, DCI, Pat North, and enter, DCI, Roisin Connor.  I was sad to see North leave, and it took me awhile to warm up to the hardened Connor.
However, Connor is a much better match for Walker, she is able to put him in his place quite easily. She is superb as an investigator, and like all other DCI's, she is a tough taskmaster. She is beautiful, but understands she needs to work twice as hard as men to achieve her status. Her hard boiled attitude is a method of controlling her emotions. What she faces day to day on her job is mind boggling.  We are privy to the gore and the messiness of the cases, the dead and their families. That is what makes this series, a terrific one.

Highly recommended. Prisrob 05-20-12
