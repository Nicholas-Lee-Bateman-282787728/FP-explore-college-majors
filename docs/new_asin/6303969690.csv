7857606,5,6303969690,"I really like this movie because Lance Henriksen is outstanding as Burns...funny, original, and with his incredible ability to move from caring to menacing in the blink of an eye or simply a look. Molly, Michael, and Alex keep repeating the same lines ad nauseam. Lance/Burns is really the only person worth watching and he's wonderful.  I SO WISH for a Region 1 DVD version!  A must for all Lance Henriksen fans!

7857607,5,6303969690,This is a great who-dun-it with lots of twists and turns. And the man who steals the spotlight is Lance Henriksen (Aliens) with one of his uncoventional scary guy creations. Molly Ringwald (Fresh Horses) and Donal Logue (Dear God) play a couple in hiding in Baha. They are trying to get money from her dad played by Corben Bersen (Major League). They'd had a drug deal go bad earlier and a person was killed. It wasn't until much later that they noticed the strange tourist (Henriksen) hanging around. Then surprising things begin to happen. This is a great movie for Henriksen fans and a great one for those who love a mystery.,1003622400,3,628,4.616071428571429
7857608,3,6303969690,"There's a goofy charm to this film. It doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, but instead of ending up a mess, it manages to maintain a good pace, a comprehensible storyline and more-than-adequate character development. A good, occasionally noir soundtrack evens the whole thing out nicely. The boys - Lance Henriksen in particular - seem to be having a good time; unfortunately Molly Ringwald doesn't ever seem to catch on, but that's okay 'cause she turns in a reasonable if somewhat lower-key performance than her male co-stars. Flawed but interesting. Absolutely worth the time.",994723200,4,585,5.041237113402062
