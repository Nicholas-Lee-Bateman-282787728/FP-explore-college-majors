7559148,5,B018WGEFUE,Misty Mundae is one of my favorite actresses. Sweet and innocent.,1462579200,5,65,5.0
7559149,3,B018WGEFUE,"A great deal of this movie is long boring scenes that I think only exist because of the music being played.  If you've seen this guys movies before you know what to expect when it isn't a long boring music video: witty dialog given by people who can't act and excessive nudity.  The box warns that this isn't porn, and the box is right.  Porn is arousing.  This is not.  This is Bill Zebub.

IF it was an hour long, with all the dialog preserved, this movie would be great.  But the long boring scenes with music just suck.

Also, I want to make a movie, just so I can get all the hot starlets like the director does.  I can't act either, so I'll be perfect!",1461542400,14,658,4.118110236220472

7559151,5,B018WGEFUE,This film is great.  It is smart and sexy. Bill Z rocks.  Erin Brown is gorgeous as well as all the other actresses. Thank you all for this beautiful piece of art cinema.,1457654400,2,170,4.121212121212121
7559152,5,B018WGEFUE,"Brilliant.  Rachel Crow, Erin Brown and Lydia Lael star in this comedic masterpiece from the King of B-Movies - Bill Zebub.  The surface is accessible and entirely enjoyable for those fans who thrive on Troma and other B-Movie films.  It's brash, with glorious nudity, the trademark metla score and humorous dialog.  For those that wish to dive deeper, oh my, what a journey you have before you.  The underlying themes touch on a number of philosophical maxims and the film will reward those who embrace the thin veneer of sarcasm. Definitely one of Bill's best films.  After a successful IndieGoGo campaign, Bill was able to craft a monstrosity of car sized proportions for this movie and it's used like a child unmasking an action figure on Christmas morning - with purpose and free of the grasp that convention uses to stifle convention.  It this film perfect? No.  Is it awesome? Yes. If you dig underground movies with the pulsing vein of Zappa thumping through it - buy this.  It's beyond awesome.",1452211200,10,1003,4.818713450292398

7559154,5,B018WGEFUE,"I think that this is Misty Mundae's most exploitational footage, but the reason why i bought this was because I heard that it was a bizarre mix of high brow and lowbrow, with a lot of WTF on-screen moments.  The slow motion shots were amazingly beautiful.  I love this style.",1475539200,,275,4.48

7559157,4,B018WGEFUE,"Just when you thought it was safe to enter the water....

A man creates an enhancement cream with shark results. The titled shark becomes severed and freed. The shark is attracted to the scent of a woman and is growing larger.

This is made by the same group who did, ""Nightmare on Elmo Street"" i.e. if you liked one you will like the other. The style is the same, naked women having sex with a puppet interrupted by long boring conversations. This time the dialogue was worse than their previous film as they whined about things like standardized school tests. This is listed as science fiction with a claim it is not porn. It is more porn than science fiction with 9 girls with full frontal close up nudity, including Misty Mundae this time. (She took a pass on nudity in Nightmare...) Guys got facial close-ups while women got torso close-ups.

4 stars for the nudity (Misty Mundae as Erin Brown, Sheri Medulla, Rachel Crow, Scarlett Storm, Lydia Lael, Kathy Rice, Chrissy Lynn, Andrea Hall, Sarah Hunt....Bikini only-Kayla Browne, Barbir Kish)

7559158,1,B018WGEFUE,This was a waste of money. I couldn't really watch it.,1470268800,,54,4.0
7559159,1,B018WGEFUE,"Avoid this movie like the plague.

I have a great love for Schlock movies & Exploitation films but this was just a movie without a plot, over saturated in terrible music, with not even a modicum of acting talent & absent of any kind of cinematography skills.

The best analogy for what this movie is like is if you gave a group of 13 year olds a camera & said ""go make a movie"" at which point they went & made a lame duck porno while pretending that they were doing anything but making a porno. I've seen better made movies created specifically for youtube.

Don't waste your money on this one.",1467936000,5,594,4.285714285714286
7559160,4,B018WGEFUE,"This is softcore the likes of what we are used to from Misty Mundea (Erin Brown). It's silly, it's sexy, and it's stupid! If you're not into the Seduction Cinema type of sexy humor you'll hate it. If you're a MM fan you'll love it. As shown on the cover, Dickshark, is a plastic dildo that gets played with by good looking women.",1465084800,2,329,4.238095238095238
7559161,2,B018WGEFUE,Are you kidding me? It took me about 15 minutes to watch this and when I did slow it down it was this huge plastic dick flopping around in the water doing all the tattooed ladies. And the tattoos one chick had barley any clean skin left. Some of the girls were sort of cute. Any way  I gave this movie to a friend again no plot but you don't expect it. If you like a joke movie this is it and the joke will be on you.,1464739200,7,417,3.7386363636363638
7559162,4,B018WGEFUE,"Decent nudity, interesting dialog. The movie is non linier and a little disjointed.",1462838400,5,83,5.461538461538462

8743188,2,B018WGEFUE,Only Buy if you want to see exposed Female flesh and like heavy rock music. I only bought this because I heard about this from Chris Gore who runs film threat,1515628800,,158,4.129032258064516
8743189,1,B018WGEFUE,"Funny premise, fairly well done first scene, Misty Mundae is always fun, but... this director just doesn't know how to make films.  He simply doesn't know when is when, how to edit/cut, and how to take a seemingly foolproof premise and turn it into an engaging story with a beginning, middle, and end (very BASIC stuff that even toddlers know) that entertains for more than a few minutes tops.  Nothing but impromptu babbling and scenes that drag on and on with one scene finishing and another beginning making you wonder if he just films stuff and slaps it together without having any kind of, again, storytelling flow.  This guy is like a Z rate Troma's Lloyd Kaufman wannabe and IMO Troma has the same types of problems of coming up with great titles/premises and never fully delivering what you hope for but at least they understand the general concept of storytelling where there's actually an end point/exclamation point that everything leads up to.  Mr. Zebub's films are the case of a guy having all the ingredients and never coming up with an edible meal.  He manages to get B-Movie scream queens that have cult followings and then it's like he has no clue what to do with them.  Nothing is foolproof with this guy.  He makes nude girls seem completely unsexy, he makes heavy metal the last genre you'd ever want to listen to even if that's your favorite genre beforehand, and he ticks you off in the process because it seems impossible that a movie called D*ckshark wouldn't be fun, but it isn't after about two minues.  This thing's 2 and half hours long and apart from the opening scene which feels like a promising super corny porno, the rest feels like he just filmed himself yapping with chicks in hotels and in the woods (sometimes groping them as if they were just there to be his own stress balls) while they stood around uncomfortably but hopefully paid well enough to stand there smiling and replying to him with improv that's just as good as Bill's but still nothing more than what any nontalented normal Joe Schmoe would say at any Denny's restaurant on any night.  Just garbage.  Just because you have a camera and can get girls to undress in front of it does NOT mean you're a movie maker nor a B-Movie director.  This is no better or worse than the stuff dorks at home who make cell phone or camcorder movies with their buddies in the park and in their backyards make, and most of that stuff is just not funny to anybody but those involved and often only a couple of those involved while everybody else thinks it's like watching slide photos of vacation trips of people you're not really that interested in.  Not only that but the long run time makes the DVD have playback issues of sticking/freezing which often happens when long stuff is put out on poor quality DVD.  Avoid the temptation to buy this.  Misty Mundae fans will think less of her afterward which is a shame.  It's good enough to simply read the title, know the basic synopsis, and then use your imagination.  Your mind's eye version will be better than the real thing by MILES.",1508371200,,3068,4.591575091575091
8743190,1,B018WGEFUE,"What the hell?!?! Listen, I love low budget movies but this is something even I couldn't watch! This ""movie"" was made for two reasons. First, to show alot of naked women. Second, to pimp out the ""music"" of the movie. Both which are bad! Nobody was trying to act or make this movie. Its just a mess. ONLY reason to watch this movie would be to make a drinking game out of it with friends.",1504828800,,387,4.173333333333333
