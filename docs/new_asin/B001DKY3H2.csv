8326354,4,B001DKY3H2,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD - it was very informative. My major complaint is the fact that they don't sell their rubs anymore. The store is closed. I tried to contact them through email but I never got a reply. This is just disappointing because Kevin talks about how great his rubs are (and they look and sound amazing) but alas, they are no longer for sale. So I would recommend this DVD, but keep in mind that you'll have to use different rubs and possibly use a different method if the rub you're using is high in salt content or it uses different sugars.",1363910400,,561,4.352380952380952
