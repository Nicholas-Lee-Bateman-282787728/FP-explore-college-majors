It has an excellent cast, and when I realized over half the movie was missing, I was pretty angry.  Can't even return it - I watched what was there!",1438387200,,271,4.0754716981132075

8613836,2,B00FAOCIXI,"4 films about ghosts, designed for TV.  That says it all, to be honest.

Subpar effects, even for their day.  Cardboard characters you will forget about quickly.  Any story based upon actual events/settings were poorly researched, or flat out incorrect.  I mean, they could have tried a bit harder to mimic the Winchester House.  You don't expect them to use the actual house, but the one they used... nothing similar in the slightest.

Terrible films, I regret buying the collection.  But, if you like cheap ghost films from tv a few decades ago, you might give it a go.  The price is decent enough.",1388707200,4,600,4.6923076923076925
