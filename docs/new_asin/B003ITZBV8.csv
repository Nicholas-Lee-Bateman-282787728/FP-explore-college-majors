4128305,5,B003ITZBV8,My child loves all things Elmo and this movie is one of his favorite.  I would definately recommend this dvd.  You won't be disappointed.,1283040000,,137,4.666666666666667
4128306,4,B003ITZBV8,"My toddler loves this DVD. She already knows her alphabets so his was just for fun. Be mindful that Grover says the alphabet the wrong way a few times and the way he says it is quite catchy. My toddler likes to say it the way grover says it now, but she does know the difference. So my advice is make sure your kid knows the correct way of saying the alphabet before watching it.",1280793600,10,379,4.066666666666666

4128323,3,B003ITZBV8,"I purchased this for my toddler who, like most, is in love with all things Elmo and we needed a DVD for the car for him. I assumed that this would be just all about Elmo and his explanation of the alphabet.  This wasn't the case - it starts with Grover doing most of the talking and Elmo chimes in here and there and then we leave them entirely and go over to Telly and songs and other things.  If you're looking to get something that is heavy on the Elmo, I wouldn't recommend this item.  I'm going to order an episode of Elmo's World instead.",1439942400,3,544,4.113207547169812

4128336,3,B003ITZBV8,"Its is useful for learning but very boring and is not successful in catching attention at all. I think if you find an alternative,  better go for it not this one",1388016000,,161,4.193548387096774
4128337,5,B003ITZBV8,My son loves all Elmo videos so how can you go wrong with a educational video..he already knows his ABC's but it can't help to ingrain it some more!,1378684800,,148,4.137931034482759
4128338,5,B003ITZBV8,"Wasn't sure how this would go over- as my 2 year old son has been more obsessed with Barney latewly, than Sesame, but he IS learning his ABC's, so I thought it was worth a shot. He LOVE LOVE LOVEs it!!!!  Super cute, all the favorite characters. Totally worth the price, and your time. Also, not annoying, like some of the others can be.",1375315200,,337,4.265625

4128347,5,B003ITZBV8,"My 18 month old son loves this DVD! He knows all of his letters, and gets so excited when he sees them on the screen. I was worried that he would quickly tire of the show segments with Professor Grover, but he watches with the same level of interest each time. There's fun music, with the alphabet constantly reinforced.  The show segments are funny for parents too. You won't be sorry that you purchased this one!",1327881600,,414,4.447368421052632
4128348,5,B003ITZBV8,"Chabela's first word was ""Elmo"". She owns four of its films, and has more on order. Soon she will be able to host an retrospective on his work, and have her fellow ""Elmo"" cineaste over for a lazy afternoon followed by some warm milk and cookies, and then a nap. As she gently falls into a sleep, her little lips pronounce the word ""Elmo"".",1325894400,,338,4.296875
4128349,5,B003ITZBV8,"If anything, my daughter loves this DVD a bit too much. She picks up the box, runs to the couch, points at the TV and says ""Elmo! Elmo! Elmo! Elmo!"" until I either give in or hide. We don't let her watch much TV, so this has basically become the only TV we watch with her. On the bright side - it is very well done, the songs are good, there are plenty of variations on the alphabet song, and they really do focus on teaching the alphabet. If she has to watch something, I feel like this is at least educational. Maybe it's because I grew up with Sesame Street, but compared to a lot of modern kid's shows, I also find it very watchable. I'm not as enthused about watching it 5X/week as my daughter is, but it's definitely bearable for the adults.",1322870400,,747,4.158620689655172
4128350,5,B003ITZBV8,"I got this video for my grandson since he loves Elmo so much! I can say that this one is his favorite, he watch it over and over and keeps singing abc song even after video is over. He has other videos, but every time I try to put on another video he just said: No, abc Elmo, abc Elmo!!!Learn while having fun, that's important!!!",1319500800,,330,4.092307692307692

4128352,5,B003ITZBV8,"My 20 month old son loves Elmo, Grover, Telly, and their alphabet antics!  This is a great DVD to reinforce what your child is already learning about the alphabet.  Great songs and skits.  One reviewer wrote that the traditional ABC song is not in this DVD but that is completely not true.  They sing it at least 3 times.  Two of the times is has a slightly ""funky"" beat but it still has the same meter and sound!  Thanks Sesame Street for a great DVD and teaching tool!",1300492800,9,470,4.284090909090909
4128353,5,B003ITZBV8,"My 2 year old daughter had the ABC's mostly figured out when I bought her this DVD, now she has mastered it. On long car rides or rainy days she wants to watch it over and over again, and I really don't mind it. Elmo is a great character and this is a great educational DVD!",1298246400,3,274,3.9107142857142856
4128354,5,B003ITZBV8,"I bought this because my daughter loves sesame street. She is only 1 but she loves the music and gets excited when she see's all the characters esp Elmo. I really love that this dvd is repetitive with the abc's songs and in their show segments. All the songs are catchy and the shows are so much fun, it's a great way to teach your kids the alphabet and will be sure to grab their attention everytime! I recommend this to everyone with kids!",1296432000,9,441,4.261904761904762
4128355,5,B003ITZBV8,"We've been working with our 2-year-old on the alphabet for a few months and I wanted a fun DVD that could support our teaching.  I'd checked out some other videos from the library but they were painfully boring.  Since my son loves Elmo, I was glad when this one came out.  It's a great DVD.  The sketches are engaging and the songs are very catchy.  My son watches it a few times each week.  And my husband and I love it too!",1285977600,5,426,4.134146341463414

8397728,5,B003ITZBV8,"This is the 4th time we've bought this DVD. It has been a hit with each of our kids and with other friends as well. The songs are fun to listen to and an incredibly catchy. You would think after 8 years that we'd be sick of this DVD or that the sketches would've become annoying, but like most SS, the characters continue to be lovable, there's a solid range of diversity in the kids, songs, and shorts, and the sketches are still entertaining to grownups as they spoof some of our favorite shows. A must have if you love Sesame Street and want to keep the attention of children of any age.",1517702400,,590,4.230088495575221
