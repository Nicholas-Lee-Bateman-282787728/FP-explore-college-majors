Official product info:
WACKEN OPEN AIR has never simply been a festivalit has, for over a quarter of a century, been a lifestyle, event and community rivaling those seen at the likes of Glastonbury in the UK and Burning Man in the US. As the festivals founders Thomas Jensen and Holgar Hbner always said, Wacken is about the music and the lifestyle, and it is that noble simplicity of aim that has seen the festival sell-out to 85,000 people within hours of the tickets going on sale every year. And now, UDR Records is proud to present a comprehensive view of both the Wacken festival and culture via 25 Years Louder Than Hell  The W:O:A Documentary, a film directed by Sara Kelly-Husain and produced by Christine Stephan for Nice Productions.

Utilizing deep, archival footage, live action film and hand-held camera montages, 25 Years Louder Than Hellweaves together the full story of this cultural phenomenon from its humble beginnings in one small village field to the consistently sold-out, 85,000 plus music megacity it has become. Featuring interviews with the likes of Lemmy from Motrhead, Slayers Kerry King, Biff Byford of Saxon and Nergal of Behemoth, 25 Years Louder Than Hellalso speaks with fans from across the globe to further explain the enormous cultural phenomenon which Wacken Open Air has grown into.
