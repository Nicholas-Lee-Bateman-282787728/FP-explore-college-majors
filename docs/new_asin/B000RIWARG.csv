2867484,1,B000RIWARG,"I've been walking and riding a stationary bike regularly since becoming pregnant (I am 14 weeks) and I felt I needed a little more variety. I am not new to exercising and I am in decent shape. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone who is not extremely familiar with Pilates before becoming pregnant. The Standing Pilates section feels quite safe and got my heart rate up, but after that everything is done while laying on the floor, which is against anything I have ever heard or read about being on your back while pregnant. I did not feel comfortable with that even though I used 2 pillows as instructed. Some of the stretches/moves are extremely painful and I pulled a few muscles that I really don't think I should have. I had to stop the DVD because it didn't feel right or safe in any way for someone who is pregnant and trying to keep herself and her baby safe. There are ways to get a safe and efficient workout during pregnancy. This DVD is not one of them.",1194998400,17,969,4.359116022099448
2867485,5,B000RIWARG,I love this DVD!  It is getting colder where I live and harder for me to walk outside like I would like.  I do this at least 4 times a week and it makes me feel wonderful!!  It is easy to follow and the 10 minute segments are great! Especially for someone who gets bored easily like me!  The fact that I can switch them up and do the ones I want on any given day is a nice feature as well!  I just entered my 6th month and I am sure that I will do this all the way until the end!,1194220800,3,479,3.6116504854368934
2867486,4,B000RIWARG,"I'm TTC so i decide to start exercise before i get pregnant. I actually broke a sweat and the next day my legs were sored. About the lying on your back, i wasn't laying there still. I was moving around big time and it was only for a short time. If you're really concerned, put a pillow underneath but confirm it from your doc about this. I've know a lot of people doing pilates pregnant and they had no problem. Everyone is different.",1193616000,,434,4.240963855421687
2867487,3,B000RIWARG,"This is my second pregnancy & I lost my pregnancy weight by using a lot of other 10 minute solution workouts by fitting them into my busy routine. I really like the concept of fitting in exercise whenever I can, so I opted for the 10 minute Prenatal Pilates Workout. It is a good workout, challenging yet doable. However, my only caveat is the part where you have to lie on your back to do a couple of moves. I have still not reached my 20week mark, but it definitely concerns me. I really wish the instructor would have addressed this issue because this is the one thing you are supposed to avoid. Maybe I will skip the lying down exercises & do the other sections after 20weeks. I will suggest to anyone who wants to buy this DVD to consult with their OB-GYN especially after your 4th month.",1192924800,6,793,4.328859060402684
2867488,4,B000RIWARG,"Okay, I bought this workout video for the Pilates for Flexibility section, as I wanted a nice stretchy type workout to do before I go to bed.  This fits that bill.  I have however, previewed the other segments and would like to address concerns about working out while lying on your back.

First, this video is NOT endorsed by the ACOG because you DO some parts of some workouts on your back (hey, it's Pilates).  However, the time is limited that you are on your back, and for each exercise that you do on your back, you're moving around--up, down, side-to-side.  The whole reason for the ""don't lie on your back after 20-weeks"" rule is that the growing uterus can exert pressure on the inferior vena cava (a major vein which returns blood from your lower body to your heart)--which can result in dizziness, low blood pressure, and a possible reduction in blood flow to the uterus and, therefore, baby.  So, in my non-professional opinion (although, this is my second pregnancy, so I'm not a complete newbie), as long as you're not on your back for too long, and especially if you're moving around stretching and exercising, it's not a big deal.

If you're still concerned, I'll break it down by section.
Two sections--Standing Pilates and Total Body Pilates have no portion where you are on your back.
Core Pilates obviously has you on your back, but it's on an incline, so that eliminates/reduces the pressure on the inferior vena cava.
Pilates for Buns and Thighs has you lay flat, mostly to lift your pelvis for bridges and the like.  Again, movement is going to reduce the pressure, and it's only for about 3 minutes of the segment.
Pilates for Flexibility has me on my back for about 2 minutes total, and for most of that time I'm rolling from side-to-side stretching.

I hope that answers people's concerns about this video.",1191628800,225,1832,4.682242990654205
2867489,5,B000RIWARG,"I've been collecting pregnancy videos and I really like this one.  It's not terribly aerobic, so I have to alternate with other tapes, but I like having some ab exercises that actually seem to challenge my abs without breaking ACOG's rules about lying flat.  The 10 minute segments make me more likely to do the workout, since it never seems like a huge time comitment, and then I end up doing more than I planned.",1191456000,2,414,4.506666666666667
2867490,1,B000RIWARG,"During parts of the workout, the teacher tells you to be flat on your back--and all of my pregnancy books say that's not a safe position after a certain number of weeks (I think it's 16 weeks but it may be 20). At any rate, I wish she'd address that point in the DVD.",1189987200,10,267,3.962962962962963
2867491,4,B000RIWARG,"I'm starting my 2nd trimester and have been doing this workout for several weeks.  I like it a lot, primarily because it's efficient, fun and offered in bit-size segments.  I've done pilates before and can follow it.  The fact that the segments are 10-minutes in length has made them more conducive to do.  I also have Shiva Rea's prenatal yoga and the Perfect Pregnancy Workout and I alternate doing them, or do the yoga and then follow it with a few segments from this video.",1188691200,,477,4.576470588235294
2867492,5,B000RIWARG,I am currently 36 weeks pregnant and got this video at 35 weeks.  I have only been doing it for a week and can already notice a difference.  I absolutely love it!  although I could see how it may be very difficult for someone who is not already in decent shape.  This is a great video for someone who has some knowledge of Pilates or yoga experience.  The video moves very fast.  If you want to start doing Pilates while pregnant start this video at the beginning of your pregnancy not the end.,1187913600,,494,4.258064516129032
2867493,4,B000RIWARG,"Currently in my sixth month of pregnancy, I enjoy doing this pilates workout. This prental pilates workout is part of the 10 minute solution series. There are five 10 minute segments that can be done all together or combined in any way you like. The segments include pilates for upper body, lower body, core strength, total body pilates and pilates for flexiblity. It also has a 10 minute segment ""blast belly fat fast"" for after the baby. The workout moves quickly, so while not terribly challenging, it is fun and stimulating for those who are advanced exercisers yet doable for beginners. Completing the workout leaves me feeling flexible yet toned.",1187222400,4,652,4.9363636363636365
2867524,5,B000RIWARG,"I don't exercise much, but this felt do-able and felt like it was targeting the right things to prepare you to carry a child for 9 months.  This is my second child and I felt so much weaker going into this pregnancy and feel fatigued sooner than with pregnancy #1.  I hope to do two of these a day.",1516406400,,298,4.033898305084746
2867525,5,B000RIWARG,"I love these videos. They are short, but I feel like I accomplished something while doing them. My energy level has been garbage during my pregnancy, but I tell myself, ""I can do anything for 10 minutes."" I recommend these videos to anyone who is pregnant and is struggling to maintain the same kind of exercise routine they had prior to pregnancy. I'm so happy I have these...I'll probably use them in the early weeks of postpartum too to help me get back on track with exercising.",1513468800,,482,4.551724137931035
2867526,5,B000RIWARG,I loved this workout during my pregnancy!  You can do just 10 minutes out make it longer and the workouts vary in intensity so you can match how you feel each day.  I credit thus video to helping me stay flexible and lean through all three trimesters.,1511740800,,251,4.319148936170213
2867527,5,B000RIWARG,"I love these 10-minute workouts.  I try to do two or three at a time.  Ive used them throughout my pregnancy, and theyve worked well at every stage.  The core strength exercises have gotten a little harder now that I am in my 37th week.  I did Pilates regularly before getting pregnant, but these exercises are appropriates for novices as well.
The only thing I wish I had known beforehand is that a few workouts require 2-3 lb weights.  I had to buy those separately.",1511654400,,468,4.458823529411765

2867529,5,B000RIWARG,"Wonderful programs to keep fit and flexible during pregnancy, and great ab workout for postpartum! Building your own workout ranging from 10-40minutes is great for anyone! I used this during my entire twin pregnancy and had a wonderful pregnancy and delivery, also quick recovery. I. previously owned this during my first pregnancy, I let a friend borrow it and never got it back (probably because she loved it too!).",1510099200,,417,5.057971014492754
2867530,5,B000RIWARG,"I can't say enough good things about this DVD! It has saved me throughout my pregnancy. I have always had bad back and hips and when I became pregnant the pain set in and I thought "" how am I going to get through the next 6 months?"" This DVD has the best stretches and prenatal pilates positions that have helped me become pain free. Actually, my back and hips have never felt better. There is no excuse that you don't have time because anyone can fit in 10 minutes! I really like how you can choose which exercises you want to do for a total of 5- 10 min exercises to equal 50 min max. I also paired this DVD with a prenatal yoga DVD and do both of them at least twice weekly. I recommend the yoga DVD ""Heather Seininger in Yoga Pregnancy Pre and postnatal workouts."" I am just a week shy of 9 months pregnant and still do them and feel great!",1508371200,,844,4.090361445783133

2867532,4,B000RIWARG,"It is a nice workout, not intense at all, so I am combining it with a daily stair master 30 min workout. For the 8th month of pregnancy it is nice, for any time before the 7th month I think it won't do much. But, of course, something is better than nothing at all.",1507075200,,264,3.9074074074074074

2867534,5,B000RIWARG,I am currently 31 weeks pregnant and have been using these videos since about week 13. I usually do 2 or 3 of these videos at least 4 times per week. These videos have kept me feeling strong throughout this pregnancy. I don't have any lower back pain and I believe it's due in part to the core pilates video. I'm cautious to not over exert myself when working out and these videos work perfectly for me.,1505692800,,403,4.246753246753247

Take your time with the workout, and stay at your comfort level. But, it is a great workout, and my wife really likes it.",1503532800,,243,4.304347826086956
2867537,5,B000RIWARG,"I really like this DVD. The instructor is likeable and informative. She works at a good pace and the format of the DVD set is great. You can work out for any number of the sections, and you can even customize your workout by choosing multiple sections.",1500940800,,252,4.382978723404255
2867538,5,B000RIWARG,I love that these workouts can be quick or paired together for a super long workout when I have the time! The ab workout is really good and doesn't make me feel like I'm pushing myself too far as I get bigger.,1500595200,,209,4.0
2867539,5,B000RIWARG,"Recommend this a lot if you're pressed for time it's only 10 mins. And doing that a day will keep you and baby healthy. You can create a personalized workout, pick one workout, or play all. The energy in the video is good.
Helped a lot with my first pregnancy, wish i used it for the second. But they have a post natal workout on the dvd which is great!",1499472000,,353,4.057142857142857
2867540,5,B000RIWARG,"I love these workouts! I worked out fairly regularly prior to getting pregnant, including stott Pilates classes. But I have gotten SO tired and sore and it's been so hard to keep up.
These workouts have been a lifesaver. I choose one workout daily and always end with the stretching segment. If I'm feeling it, I'll add another workout. I love that you have the option to break the time down.
I will be buying this for all my pregnant friends from now on.
Only con is there are a few moves that have you laying on your back which aren't the bedtime after 1st trimester, however she gives options to raise your upper back.",1498694400,,621,4.408695652173913
2867541,5,B000RIWARG,"I started this DVD around week 23 & use it in combination with the long & lean prenatal. I love the 10-minute chunks. Depending on how much time I have, I'll do 2-4 of them at once, always ending with the segment for flexibility. I feel better overall & appreciate that she uses light dumbells for some of her moves. Highly recommend.",1495324800,,334,4.403225806451613
2867542,5,B000RIWARG,"This video was so much more practical than others I purchased because the workouts were good, but fit my schedule.",1494201600,,114,4.75

2867546,3,B000RIWARG,"The video is okay.  I wish there was a way to shut the music off.  Also, she moves very fast for a heavily pregnant woman.  I wonder if she is actually pregnant or using a prosthetic.  If your in great shape before pregnancy this video may be good for you, but if your in more moderate shape, the movements are too quick.",1493510400,,321,4.129032258064516
2867547,5,B000RIWARG,Love these 10 minute solution DVDs in general but this one is great for prenatal exercise and totally doable!,1493078400,,109,4.7894736842105265
2867548,5,B000RIWARG,I seriously LOVE all of the 10 Minute Solutions DVDs! They are super convient to use because you can do anywhere from 10-50 minute workouts and you can pick which areas of focus you want to do! I have tried a LOT of Pilates DVD's and the ones with the most jam packed Pilates have always been these! Even if I only do a 10 minute segment I can still feel the workout and see results! When I was pregnant with my son I used this DVD to make sure what I was doing would be safe for me and baby! :),1492128000,,495,3.8627450980392157
2867549,5,B000RIWARG,"I LOVE this dvd!  The 10min options allows you to work out no matter how much time you have and if combined, they create a great workout.  The only part i am a bit scheptical about (but it is about Pilates, not the DVD itself) it's the core one.  I am still not sure crunches are good because of the risk of Diastasys.  As a pre/postnatal trained I prefer other forms of exercise to the the abs.  Never he less, I borrowed this DVD from the public library to check it out, and then purchased it.  Good workout even when not pregnant!",1492128000,,533,4.176470588235294
2867550,4,B000RIWARG,"I really enjoy the 10ms series, especially since I've been pregnant. In my first trimester I would use some of the other DVDs in this series to keep motivated. Even with morning sickness and feeling lathargic, I could still find 10 minutes a day to keep in shape.
I only gave this one 4 starts because like all the 10ms series, there are a few of the workouts I don't like as much and it almost seems like a waste. Right now i am now in my 2nd trimester and have been loving the one for flexibility. I also feel like with 10ms, you get what you pay for. The editing quality is definitely not as good as some of the more expensive brand like Beach Body. Overall, it is still a pretty good workout and I plan to be able to do most of the workouts thought my full 9 months.",1491955200,2,770,4.072368421052632
2867551,5,B000RIWARG,Wife is currently using this video during the pregnancy of our first.  She feels great and is glad she's exercising.,1491264000,,116,4.8
2867552,5,B000RIWARG,Great exercise video for pregnancy and postpartum. I love the 10 minute segments which are very practical. Good modifications for the pregnant body. I would recommend to any pregnant person who wants to stay toned and exercised. The only bad thing I can say is that the instructor is so amazingly in shape that she changes position too fast and I can't keep up. But I understand it's only a 10 minute video so we can't move like sloths....,1490832000,,439,4.569620253164557
2867553,5,B000RIWARG,"I started having lower back pain so ordered this 10 minute solution video. The first week just 10 minutes was SO hard to do. Every 4 days or so I could add abother 10 minute session. After 2 weeks, lower back pain was gone and I started feeling strong again. Highly recommend!

2867556,4,B000RIWARG,"I really enjoy how I can choose which workout to do daily and customize my plan. It definitely fits into my schedule.

Overall, I love the practice!",1487548800,,307,4.5
2867557,5,B000RIWARG,"so far i really like it, at 18 weeks. however, as i begin to learn the routines i find it getting easier. I might buy another video, maybe a little harder, and come back to this one when i am further along. as for the routine itself, i always do all 50 minutes because the time literally flies by! makes you feel great and accomplished after working out.",1487462400,,354,4.220588235294118

2867561,5,B000RIWARG,"I have done a myriad of workout DVD's, everything from Tae-Bo to Dancing with the Stars to P90X to Insanity and beyond. However, after my first child, I never got my body back to my pre-baby self, and my body is incredibly weak now. This is my second pregnancy, and I'm definitely feeling the 'growing and stretching' pains more this time around, so I wanted something specifically geared towards pre-natal fitness. I absolutely LOVE this DVD. I love that you can pick an individual workout, or you can customize your day with the segments you want to do that day. The workouts get your heart pumping (with the exception of the stretching segment - that's pretty mild)! There's no jumping or high-impact work, which I am really appreciating. So even as someone who started with very weak muscles, I'm able to get through the workouts, feel challenged, and feel like I'm getting stronger each time. I will definitely be doing daily throughout my whole pregnancy. Highly recommend!",1484179200,,979,4.868263473053892

If I can spend the full 50 minutes, I do and again feel really great after.  It really helped my hips stop hurting during my pregnancy.  I picked this up well into my second trimester and didn't have a problem keeping up.  It's a light, low impact workout that hit all my sore spots this pregnancy.  I really encourage women to use this if they can.  There is no crazy moves or heavy weights and you can pick it up at any point.",1483920000,2,589,3.899159663865546

I wanted to take it down a notch during pregnancy, so I figured I'd stick with yoga/pilates, walking and spin once a week. I started this DVD in the first trimester. I called it lame (as it was so easy) but stuck with it. Now I'm in the third trimester. And now I see what people mean when they say she transitions quickly. I can barely keep up! This large body is not so quick to move around. Still loving this DVD and will continue as long as I can. Love that each workout is 10 minutes. I usually end up doing everything except the core workout - lots of conflicting information out there on whether core workouts are good for you in pregnancy. I tried it once and didn't love it, so I'm sticking with the other 4 workouts - 40 minutes of working out is plenty!",1478563200,4,862,4.2303030303030305

I love the face that they are 10 minutes!! I usually add at least two together... But on days when you don't have the time at least you are doing something. The videos are not hard so if you are looking for something a bit difficult than this is probably not for you however ..

2867577,4,B000RIWARG,"I normally do Focus T25 which is a lot of cardio, burpies, jumping, planks and push ups.  When I got my BFP I planned on continuing with my regular exercise routine through my entire first trimester.  At about 6 weeks I started getting really sick every day so my exercise plans went out the window and I couldn't do anything for about 5 weeks.  At 11 weeks my sickness started to fade but after 5 weeks of no exercise I am very out of shape.  10 Minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates was just what I needed to get started again with exercise.  I am feeling very out of shape and still not quite feeling myself and this is a great re-introduction to exercise.  I have never done pilates before so this is all new to me!  I imagine if you do pilates regularly that this won't be very challenging.  I am currently 12 weeks pregnant and my plan is to use this for a couple weeks and then get back into something that has some more cardio and is a little more challenging.  I will use this on nights when I am not feeling well but still want to exercise.  I imaging that when I am in my third trimester this will feel challenging and be the perfect level work out.",1474156800,,1156,4.213636363636364

Cons- Nowhere was it mentioned that you need equipment (bar bells) to do this DVD.  The exercises are simple, but there are no modifications suggested in any section like you might find in regular Pilates classes or DVDs .

I can fit 10 minutes in, it's a small commitment. I usually end up doing more, but 10 min. is a good start. I would say I was in average shape. I didn't work out regularly, but I'm not a couch potato. I find it hard to make time to work out, there is always cleaning or something else I think I should be doing :) I have had this DVD for 9 months and I don't get tired of the workouts.

I'm not a huge fan of her voice or her belly hanging out so I obviously was more judging her from the couch than doing the exercise or I wouldn't have noticed those things. If you manage to do it kudos to you but if you're pregnant just go put your feet up. You're going to be busy soon enough anyways. :),1471219200,,400,4.075949367088608

Depending on your schedule you could work out 20-50min. The workouts are great for pilates beginners like me! She is nice, easy to understand, and doesn't talk to much. I feel like I got a good workout after each workout. Some of the videos you will use dumbbells which I love. If you don't have dumbbells you can totally still do the work outs too.

The workouts are very doable and I was surprised to find that I could feel it in my muscles the next day after a couple of them.

2867609,5,B000RIWARG,I really love this workout video so far. I like to pair up the different workouts to make a 20-30 min routine depending how my body is feeling. Sometimes I just stick with 1 10 min routine. Either way the exercises make me feel well worked out. The stretching pilates has alleviated a lot of tummy stretching pains and back pains.

Will be great for getting back into shape post-baby as well.  Was a long distance runner up until 5 1/2 months pregnant, when it just became too uncomfortable to run anymore.  That's when I began walking and ordered this pilates video.  She does move pretty fast at times through the moves and transitions, but once you've done the video a few times, you can easily keep up.  Definitely recommend!",1464307200,,598,4.59433962264151
2867621,4,B000RIWARG,"This gives you a good workout focusing on key areas during pregnancy using modified or regular pilates moves for your workout. I did not do pilates before my pregnancy, and found this video after. I ordered it in my third trimester. Many of the exercises are like stretching and toning at the same time, which felt great on my hips. Painful at first, but I took it at my own pace and after just a few days of these stretch/tones, my hips were already feeling better. It helped to relieve my lower back and hip pain. I would give this five stars, but some of the floor exercises were either very difficult (I don't even think I could lie on the floor and point my toes to the ceiling not pregnant, let alone at 34 weeks) or hard on my back. For example, she has you lie on the floor and put two pillows behind you to lean back into. No matter how I situated the pillows, what pillows I used, or how I moved, it was really hard on my lower back. That could just be me and my body. Overall, I think this is a great workout, especially for moms that are having trouble with the lower back and hips. Did it help with overall labor? Not sure, but it absolutely gave my back and hips some relief in the last trimester.",1464220800,,1211,4.17948717948718
2867622,5,B000RIWARG,"I used these daily during my pregnancy and I think they helped a ton with the soreness that comes with pregnancy. Apparently 38 is considered ""advanced maternal age"" which I find ridiculous considering I had a perfectly healthy pregnancy. I didn't always have the energy for exercise but getting some kind of activity into my day was strongly stressed by my Dr particularly because I was ""high risk"" and had gained more weight in the first trimester than the ""average"" for my pre-pregnancy weight. I was super lucky and didn't have morning sickness so of course I gained more weight, I was a rare case, I was able to eat and I most certainly did. I was told if I kept going the way I was I would gain way to much weight and could cause complications. I did not ""work out"" before I got pregnant but I did walk 2-4 miles a day and I kept that up as my energy levels allowed. The walking was a great help but I needed something for flexibility and mobility and this was my favorite of the ones I tried. I found it initially on you  tube but wanted the convenience of a DVD and for the price I thoughn why not. I'm glad I did, there are more workouts on the DVD than I had found on you tube. I like the way I felt after doing even one, it really helped me with tight muscles.",1464220800,7,1271,4.187755102040816

While I do still do it about once a week, it is not challenging at all, especially if you have ever done pilates. It's broken into 10 minute segments which go very quickly, but too many of the exercises and stretches are really rushed.

2867627,5,B000RIWARG,"I started using this at about 2 months pregnant when complications forced me to stop running.  I have taken a lot of pilates classes over the years so I started doing more difficult versions of the exercises on the DVD, using heavier weights, and doing the whole set of workouts.  As my pregnancy progressed, I had to slow down and eventually did the exercises exactly as the host was doing them, in 2 or 3 of the segments at a time.  That's what's great about this DVD, you can choose to work out from 10-50 minutes in 10 minute increments.  You can customize from the main menu so you don't have to go to the menu every time to start another segment.
Others have said that they didn't like that ""equipment"" was needed, but all you need are pillows and hand weights, which I already had.  I also used a yoga mat that I have but that isn't necessary.  Once I was cleared postpartum for light exercise I went back to this DVD and it felt great, like just the right amount of movement.",1462838400,18,983,4.315217391304348

Seriously, it was okay for a while but then it got frustrating because I didn't want to keep hitting pause but I didn't want to miss out on the exercises. 2) I don't actually feel like this is a very challenging workout. Maybe other people enjoy it more than I do, but I don't really feel like I got a workout in when I'm done with the DVD. I would be much more likely to recommend Suzanne Bowen's Slim and Toned Prenatal Barre workout (this one is my favorite) and Fit & Sleek Prenatal Physique.

I definitely decided to give this a try and I'm glad I did.  Two of the five workouts incorporate light weights and I love that. I actually feel like I am getting something out of the workouts as opposed to just traditional breathing and stretching.  The relaxation piece is really nice too.  I usually do two workouts plus the relaxation and find that it's just right for what I was looking for! I was doing some hardcore workouts prior to getting pregnant so I was looking for something that was much more laid back but still a little challenging.",1457308800,,714,4.427480916030534

I used to run , palates, and the revolver work out on the trampoline before becoming pregnant.

I feel just starting out, that these 10 minute work outs are perfect for just starting out after not working out for a long time.

2867656,5,B000RIWARG,"So much of working out is mental, not physical. You have to be ready and willing to do the workouts. This workout DVD helped me to get over that mentle hurdle so that I could workout on a regular basis. The way it's broken down into ten minute increments means you can fit a workout out in just about whenever you need it. They are targeted so even just ten minutes feels very gratifying and productive. You can customize it to focus on what you need. I stopped doing the ab portion when I felt uncomfortable but still had plenty of other options to choose from. I honestly feel like this Pilates workout helped me to maintain my activity level throughout the pregnancy and reduce physical discomfort. I was able to continue with Irish dance until about 37 weeks (and probably would have continued if it wasn't for Christmas break.) The balance work and strength training in this DVD helped greatly.

I'm currently 38 weeks pregnant and have been doing one segment of this video most mornings since the beginning of my 2nd trimester, combined with an hour long in studio Pilates class once a week. I did cut out the Core section once I hit my 3rd trimester since I didn't feel comfortable with some of the exercises. Ten minutes a day isn't very much and it's not very strenuous but it's enough to maintain flexibility and muscle tone, and it gets me going in the morning. My weight gain has been right in line with my doctor's recommendations and I feel great!

I have a bad back and was having alot of tailbone and pelvic pain and the stretching portion of this video has REALLY helped me!  I am at 30 weeks with my 4th baby and do the stretches everyday to keep the back pain, pelvic and tail bone pain at bay and it seems to really be working.  Not too mention, I feel and sleep better!  The only thing is that she goes pretty quickly through the exercises, so you may have to pause the first time you do them so you can watch her and make sure that you are doing them right.  I also spend a little more time on each stretch than she gives, but I think that's the beauty of the remote control!",1454284800,6,787,3.9745222929936306

I'm currently 5 weeks ... this video feels really good! I don't sweat like I did with JM, so I hope in the long run it'll be good for me, but the stretches are great and I can definitely tell the moves are going to keep me more tone. It's also sooooo easy to whip through 40 minutes of this. They are broken down into 10-minute sections, and I just keep moving through each! I've never done pilates before, so like I said, I hope it keeps me looking good for the long run, but I'm also incorporating treadmill incline walks into my workouts as well to hopefully keep the weight down.

For those complaining about being on your back---it's so incredibly minimal, it's ridiculous that you are complaining! Plus, she uses pillows--and clearly she's pregnant and it's not affecting her. I asked my doctor and she said this is not a problem at all.",1454025600,,969,4.41340782122905

I also love that the segments are ten minutes each, so I can fit in one or two during my daughter's naps or before she wakes up in the morning.

I like this video more than the What to Expect workouts because they are more challenging (I use What to Expect on days I am feeling a little more strung out).  I'm 36 weeks, been using this video since first trimester, and I sincerely believe it helps me stay more toned and, more importantly, it does wonders for my back.

I had no problems doing the workouts during my first and early second trimester, though I ended up preferring a couple other DVDs and haven't done this one much lately. I tried it again last night. Now that I'm at 26 weeks, I find that the workouts are not really ideal! There are a lot where you lie on your back, which you're not supposed to do in your second and third trimesters. During one of the sequences (I think it was Core), I felt really uncomfortable doing some of the ab work, despite the fact that I had pillows behind me. It caused pain and cramping in my abdomen and my stomach was still sore this morning (and I don't mean the good kind of sore you get after doing an ab workout when you're not pregnant!). I began worrying I might have abdominal separation, which about 30% of pregnant women get... I tested myself for it and it seems I don't, but I can imagine it would make ab separation much worse!! I would not recommend doing this DVD after the middle of your pregnancy. My personal favorite prenatal workout DVDs are Fit & Sleek Prenatal Physique (this has a great core workout that feels safe to do!) and Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & Short Forms (particularly if you have done yoga before).",1442620800,5,1313,4.429752066115703

Now I am 31 weeks and have moderate sciatica, so wanted to find something that was pregnancy-friendly that might help me regain some flexibility.  I like this video, but I am not sure how I feel about the fact that a large portion of the video requires you to lie on your back.  I know that other reviews mention that you can propr yourself up with a pillow during this part, or that lying on your back is not really a big deal in some peoples' opinions; however, I definitely found myself to be lightheaded when I was attempting the moves while lying on my back so I decided to skip those parts.  I also found some parts of the video to be a little difficult for me to perform.  The woman in the video is 9 months pregnant, but I found myself huffing and puffing at times to keep pace with her! And I don't consider myself to be out of shape because I chase after my 14-month-old all day plus did Pilates daily up until a few months ago.

The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars, given its staying power, is that the 10 minute solution format seems to require a transition from move to move that is a little too speedy for my taste.

She does an excellent job of showing you how to be safe while doing these exercises. Not very intense, but great for at least keeping active during pregnancy.",1437609600,,450,4.567901234567901

No excuse not to workout with these short clips. When I was tired, I would only do one and when extra tired would choose the steching one.",1436832000,,282,4.339622641509434
2867714,5,B000RIWARG,"Love this workout, and I'm not even pregnant!  I have some arthritis issues in hips and knees myself, and also teach a pilates class of women my age or older.  They love the routines from this workout that I use in my class, especially the standing and weight work.  It is strenuous enough to be effective, yet gentle and slow enough to accommodate a little awkwardness in movement, whether you're pregnant or just not as limber as you used to be!  I also like the 10 min. segments - most days I combine two or three, or sometimes just do one if I'm pressed for time.",1436832000,,567,4.320754716981132

2867716,3,B000RIWARG,"The exercises are quite good and my wife has really enjoyed using this video expect for two things:
#1 Throughout the video Ms. Garcia keeps saying how much easier childbirth will be after doing these exercises, but then she says how this is her first pregnancy. So what the heck does she know? haha
#2 The background music is strange and too loud.
Expect for that, it's a good video for a moderately healthy beginner who wants to stay healthy throughout her pregnancy.",1436054400,,469,4.662650602409639

2867723,5,B000RIWARG,I have never tried Pilates before this DVD and I love it! I usually enjoy just yoga while pregnant but this DVD is defiantly on the top of my list! I actually feel like I'm getting a good workout and burning calories! Some of the moves are a little fast without a lot of direction but just take your time and watch her and you will see how to do the moves. Highly recommended,1433808000,,375,4.081081081081081
2867724,5,B000RIWARG,"I love this video!  First, prior to pregnancy, I certainly workout all the time, but I am not an intense cardio junkie.  I say that because someone who is at an advance level might not might this review as helpful.  For me, It's the perfect combination of some stretching and relaxing with an actual workout that leaves you feeling like you actually burned some calories (especially the standing pilates and full-body sections).  Plus, the instructor is incredibly likable, provides easy instruction, and it leaves no questions to ""is this safe for me to do pregnant?"" She is awesome! After trying other prenatal videos, this one is my favorite.  I especially love the incorporation of hand weights in the two of the ten minute workouts.  Great choice if you are looking for something that can offer a bit of a workout and stretching.",1433635200,,834,4.838028169014085

2867727,3,B000RIWARG,"I think the instructor in this dvd is great and there are parts of it that I liked, but the moves just did not work right for my body. I am in my sixth month of pregnancy, and I did pilates prior to pregnancy. I don't know if it was too much lying on my back or what, but I began to experience spot bleeding after doing this dvd and I decided to discontinue using it. I do other workouts without any negative effects, but this one just wasn't for me.",1433030400,,450,3.956043956043956
2867728,5,B000RIWARG,"I have been using it for three weeks and already see a toning difference in my legs.  I have done Piliates before.  Therefore, I was familiar with certain moves.  I did find it to fast paced at the beginning, but it is intended to be 10 minute workouts, so it's supposed to be fast paced.  After about the third time, you do start getting into a routine.  Also, I know some of the other reviewers were concerned that you lie flat on the floor for a small portion of one of the segments, but it is not for a long period of time and your are moving throughout that portion.  Not a concern for me.  I recommend this video to anyone trying to stay toned during pregnancy, but that does not always have the time/energy to go to the gym.",1432857600,,731,4.178571428571429

I loved pilates before pregnancy and this video is just what I've needed to get through this pregnancy. I really appreciate that Lizbeth Garcia is pregnant in the video so I don't feel alone in my baby bump or pilates modifications.

2867740,5,B000RIWARG,"I purchased this video in my second trimester, and have been using it regularly. I love that you can customize your workout by selecting a series of segments, or a different combination of workout routines each time (from an easy to use menu, simply using your DVD remote) so that you don't get bored of the exact same routine. Sometimes, I just do 1 ten minute workout if extra tired. Other times, I mix it up and do buns, core, standing (3) or mix and match other body focus routines. The instruction is very easy to follow and she moves at the perfect pace - not too slow, not too fast. I personally find it encouraging to be led by the workout instructor, who is herself VERY pregnant - makes it easier to get through it when you're feeling tired, but someone in your shoes is leading the way. I would highly recommend this workout to anyone who has received doc clearance to work out during their pregnancy.",1430006400,,912,4.434523809523809

2867758,5,B000RIWARG,I did this video throughout my entire pregnancy. Sometimes I would just do one 10 minutes sections and other times I would do all 5. It was great to have that flexibility. I really liked all the exercises and never felt like they were inappropriate for my stage in pregnancy. I would highly recommend this DVD. One thing to note is that I got it as an amazon instant video. I wouldn't recommend this only because you don't have the dvd menu option. So if you wanted to do the third workout you would have to fast forward to it on the Instand video. It wasn't a big deal but I definitely wished I had the DVD instead for this reason.,1427068800,,632,4.231404958677686

Great instructor, clear directions and demonstrations, easy to listen to and workout with.  The workouts are very reasonable throughout the pregnancy, never too difficult, yet I always feel like I got a good, toning workout.  I use the first 4 segments as a workout 4-6 times per week.

2867766,5,B000RIWARG,"I started looking into yoga and Pilates as a way of relieving the persistant back pain I was experiencing. This program really helped. I don't do the full workout just the core and flexibility sections (about 20 min total). Instead of waking up at 3am due to back pain Im sleeping through the night. The more consistent I am the better I sleep.
Also, don't be put off if it seems too hard at first. It was for me and quite frankly I feel like a beached whale when I'm doing it but the benefit of sleeping through the night: priceless:D",1425859200,,535,4.306930693069307

2867769,5,B000RIWARG,I love this workout!  Each section is challenging enough to feel like a real workout yet gentle enough that I don't feel like I am going to injure myself or the baby.  My only complaint is that the core section is difficult to do in the third trimester but with the standing and total body sections I can still work my core by keeping the pelvic floor lifted and the baby pulled in as she says.  This is my fourth baby and I only wish I had this workout for my previous pregnancies.,1425254400,,482,4.161290322580645
2867770,3,B000RIWARG,What can I say. My son ended up being almost 10 pounds. I carried my weight all over and was so out of shape that this CD was useless for me. I think you need to be in pretty decent shape to begin with for this DVD to help you. There were a few things I could do but I would easily get out of breath. I weighed in at about 220 pounds with my son.,1425254400,,346,3.5657894736842106

Therefore, its a little more difficult to keep up with. I realize it is a 10-minute solution video, but still. It is great in that it works your muscles and I don't find the instructor to be too annoying. But again, I only use it when I have limited time.

I like how there are segments that you can select, making it easier to choose exactly what I want to make time for. Overall, meh...3 stars.",1425168000,,561,4.194444444444445

Nice though that you can choose from several different workouts and they are only 10 minutes. I do not exercise and it was an easy enough commitment for me but hard enough for those used to more. Now I do the included post pregnancy workout and my husband does it with me. We laugh at ourselves for being so out of shape we can't keep up but good to do something to lose the belly flab.,1421625600,,497,4.1875

2867788,5,B000RIWARG,"This is a great DVD! It has 5 10-minute workouts that target different areas of the body (one of them is a full-body workout). This makes it easy to choose the number and type of workouts, depending on how much time you have or how tired you feel. Even doing one 10-minute session leaves me feeling energized and relieves different kinds to pain. Doing the whole 50-minute workout is also very manageable if you are up to it.",1420934400,,425,4.461538461538462
2867789,4,B000RIWARG,"I am only in my second trimester, so I can't really say how this video is for an entire pregnancy, but so far I like it. It has 5 different 10-minute workouts, which you can watch singly or choose a few to play back-to-back. It's great to have all those options and still feel like you did something even if you only have 10 minutes. It is suggested to use 1 to 3 lb weights for some of the exercises.

The instructor is pleasant to listen to, though the instructions are a little fast sometimes. I guess if you only have 10 minutes, you can't use too much time just explaining the moves. It was easier to follow after going through it a couple times.

I read a few reviews concerned about spending time on your back later in pregnancy. The Core Pilates segment has the most time spent on your back (I think about 7 of the 10 minutes), and the instructor does imply that it isn't for the 3rd trimester by her instructions. I am not a medical professional, but I don't think laying propped on pillows for a few minutes poses a big risk. Anyway, even if you skip any moves on your back out of caution, I think there is still plenty of good stuff here.",1420416000,,1149,4.218181818181818

2867793,5,B000RIWARG,"This is my 4th pregnancy.  I had this video during my 1st pregnancy and I have been meaning to find it again. I have tried other pregnancy videos during my other 2 pregnancies & I could not find one that was safe and easy.  During one video, a 6-month pregnant woman put her head between her legs, I found that extremely hard in additional to not being able to do other exercises on that video.  It was a waste of money.
This video has 4 segments and they are only 10 mins long each.  You will not feel extremely tired after this video or several segments but you will feel slightly sore the next day which  means you are working the muscles.  The trainer is very pleasant, the exercises are easy, well most are easy, some are hard if you have no coordination, but that quickly improves.
I highly recommend this video over any prenatal video.

I'd also not done Pilates before, so it may just be that it's not the work out style for me. Having said that: my midwife told me around 24 weeks into this pregnancy that I was going to have to wear a support belt because my ab muscles were getting too relaxed from the hormones. After that appointment with her, I started doing the ab workout in this set every day instead of a couple times a week, and the next time I saw my midwife (3 weeks later) she said my stomach was looking great and that my abs were supporting my baby like they should.

2867806,5,B000RIWARG,"This is the perfect pregnancy workout video. This is my third pregnancy and my best pregnancy so far. My first pregnancy, I walked a lot. I didn't retain much muscle mass though and I started having really bad back pain. The weight peeled off quickly though. The second pregnancy, I thought the weight would also fall off so I was a couch potato. Well, let's just say it took 1 1/2 years to lose the weight. Now with the third pregnancy, I feel the best so far. This really workout really helps with bladder issues because there are a lot of pelvic floor exercises (I'm not sneezing and peeing like I did before). My back is also much stronger so I'm not having back pain. I also sleep like a baby and without discomfort.

I started this during my second trimester (21 weeks) and felt muscle soreness the first week. I highly recommend this but I wouldn't recommend this video if you're in your third trimester AND you haven't worked out at all. This would be too much on your body at that point.

2867822,4,B000RIWARG,"Love this DVD first time I tried for the intensity level, workout options, and duration options this DVD offers. How our body feels each day during pregnancy may vary a lot. This DVD provides the flexibility of workout combinations and lengths. Strengthening and toning, which this DVD focuses on, prepares for labor. I won't know for sure until delivery but I'm having high hopes for it! Usually after 20 minutes my body feels a little warm but not to the extent of losing breathes. (I wasn't super active pre-pregnancy, only did hot yoga one or twice a week.) I think for every workout one has to make adjustments according to her body condition. For example, I'm not sure about those sit-up movements in the core exercise session but guess a more athletic person might feel comfortable doing them. And, the instructor carries relatively high. I carry low. So for some movements I'd need to open my legs more than she does to leave space for my low belly. I may also add some slower stretching and breathing routine myself before and after working out with the DVD.

If the first 10 minute segment I choose isn't enough for me, I just do more segments until I feel I've gotten a sufficient workout.  Some of the exercises are really tough for me (those leg bicycles..omg) , others feel like nothing but fluff and I can't imagine they do a single thing (all that arm waving, can-cans and breathing..) and Sometimes it feels like she's rushing through the stretches too much because of having to fit everything into the ten minute time slot (like thread the needle). but as a whole I'm satisfied. I like being able to pick and choose which workouts I feel like doing, being able to mix it up from day to day.  I think she has modified the exercises well to suit pregnant women, there's nothing on here that I feel like I can't do. I just wonder if they are not TOO easy.. I can not imagine this workout would be hard enough for someone who was already in great shape and used to lots of exercise. I don't do these as regularly as I should, but I'm skeptical that this workout would yield very much results even if I did. Still, it can't hurt.  At the very least it helps to keep the lower back pain away, something I used to suffer a lot from with my previous pregnancies.  This workout is likeable enough and just easy and hard enough for me to keep doing it, so that alone says a lot. Also the fact that it's so affordable at just around $10 is great (especially when so many other exercise programs jack up their prices so ridiculously high!)

It's easy to find at least 10 minutes a day to work out for busy moms like me (I work full-time). I do ten to twenty minutes a day and I already feel myself growing stronger and more flexible. The instructor is nice and easy to follow and she challenges you without pushing you too far. Some of the exercises strength your pelvic floor to help with delivery and others help ease or prevent back pain by tightening your core muscles.

Before I got pregnant I had decided to try P90x which is an intense 90 day workout program.  I got through one month and then stopped doing it for a month before I got pregnant and was advised by my doctor to not do it at all during this pregnancy.

I am currently 25 weeks and I decided that I could not remain still for the rest of my pregnancy.  I was intrigued by the great reviews for this DVD and so I ordered it.  It sat on the DVD player for a couple weeks before I actually tried it.

It is exactly what I needed.  Short, sweet, to the point.  Before I can get bored enough to make an excuse to turn it off, I am already done with the work out (I only do 2 a day).  Mixed with some 30 day challenges (squats, pushups...etc) that I found online, I believe that this DVD has helped me get into the best shape I ever have been through any of my pregnancies (this is my fifth and last baby).  It makes me feel good and I know that recovery will be smooth as well.

Like other reviewers said, this might not be a video that will interest people who were already in great shape before becoming pregnant.  However, maybe if you choose to do all 5 workouts every day you would get more out of it.

I really enjoy the fact that it doesn't leave you feeling like you've wrecked yourself. I also have Lindsay Brin's 4 disk set, but I only use that once a week since that program *really* sets out to kick your ass.

Afterwards, your whole body just feels GOOD. Strong, energized, and stretched out. I have several pregnant friends who have not been exercising and I definitely see a difference in their core strength vs. mine.
The title menu makes it very easy to do all, one, or a few of the 5 workouts. (You can select which ones you want to do at the beginning and then it plays it straight through.)

I didn't do yoga or pilates before, so that could be the greatest factor for why it's such a hard work out for me.

Easy to follow movements for beginners. You do need to buy 1-3lb weights which it didn't say on the description, so make sure you have those first before starting your routine, or you'll be disappointed the first go like I was.

2867906,2,B000RIWARG,"I am in my third pregnancy and have experienced a lot of prenatal exercise, as well as doing pilates outside of pregnancy.  There are some great pregnancy modifications here, and some of the workouts are great.  I have a hard time, though, because some of the moves are just things you clearly should not be doing while pregnant.  It isn't safe to lay on your back, which has you do through much of the ab video, and some of the other videos.  Also, it is important to work the abs from the side, but not be trying to do normal ""crunch"" style ab work.  This causes too much strain on pregnant abdominal muscles which are already pulled apart, and could cause a diastasis.  I have never had any other pregnancy exercise instructor deem laying down or crunching as appropriate for pregnancy. There are a lot of moves here which feel more like a ""look what I can still do!"" types of thing than doing what is best for the baby and yourself.  I would probably pass on this one next time.",1392595200,6,982,4.392265193370166
2867907,4,B000RIWARG,"I had to give up my gym membership at 15 weeks, but I'd been exercising about four times a week (cardio and strength training) prior to then. I'd never done Pilates, but it seemed like a good exercise to remain limber and strong during pregnancy.

The 10 minute length means each exercise goes by very quickly, which is nice. I typically do four in a row without feeling like I've been exercising forever. However, the exercises are very simple and easy for someone who's already in shape. I'd prefer some challenge, though I do think the exercises are helpful and varied. I'm still trying to make the core and flex routines work for me. I find them uncomfortable at times, not from my pregnancy, but from some of the positioning. This is especially true for the core, which I'm trying to do on an incline in order to avoid working out on my back.

For simple maintenance, it's not a bad DVD. However, I much prefer Bowen's prenatal barre workout for an actual challenge and feeling of ""really"" working out.",1392249600,,1007,4.588888888888889

I am a first time mommy and in my second trimester and I have been doing this video for 4 weeks straight now.  I come home from work, exhausted and not wanting to do it (I don't have the 2nd trimester energy some people speak of!), but knowing that I only need to do a ten minute video gives me a little motivation (and I tell my husband to make me! :)  So I turn it on, committing to one ten minute video--can't believe the first one is over already and feel better, so I keep going until I do about 30-40 minutes!  I think the 10 minute videos are a great motivation to do a little something without being as overwhelming as some video which make you carve out an hour to get a workout in.  I would not be motivated to start something so long, but knowing that I can choose what I want to work on that day and how much I want to do feels great.

I feel better doing this video and know its good for my baby, so that makes me happy!  I'm sure I'm not burning TONS of calories, but I know I'm toning and have heard the more you do exercises like this, the better for labor, so I'm in! :)

2867913,5,B000RIWARG,I'm 21 weeks and have been working out with a personal trainer 3 days a week since before I got pregnant. I used to do pilates as well. I was looking for a workout to balance out my gym days with some toning/stretching. This video is actually a series of 5 - 10 minute workouts. The first time I did the workout I did all 5 in a row. It was surprisingly challenging but not overly so. It caters well to my growing belly without making me feel like an invalid. Bonus points for using the word 'kegel' in the video :) I also feel like the workout can be made more challenging using heavier dumbells and ankle weights.,1391731200,,615,4.176470588235294
2867914,4,B000RIWARG,"I bought this workout as a safe way to keep active during my first pregnancy. I love the 10 minute workouts. You can do one, or, build your own workout focusing on different areas. The only downside is during the core workout, there's a couple of workouts when the instructor is flat on her back. It's OK if you're in you're first trimester, but being in my second, it really freaked me out. I ended up using a pillow to slight tilt my pelvis but then felt like I wasn't accomplishing the goal of the workout.

2867916,4,B000RIWARG,"I really enjoy the core/ab and legs/butt (videos 2-3), but I don't get much out of the others.  I was especially disappointed with the standing pilates workout.  The leg work is good, but even with heavier weights than recommended, I do not see the benefit for your arms.  I am a Soldier and was in great shape before the pregnancy, and did a fair amount of weight lifting before I became pregnant.  Pregnancy has made weight lifting difficult, so I've been looking for lighter weight or body weight workouts that are still challenging.  The second and third videos are great for this and are worth buying the set for, but if you were in good shape before your pregnancy, you may not find the rest too challenging.

I also did not like the stretching video.  I get a lot more out of the 10 minute pregnancy yoga videos on youtube than I did out of that.

Overall, I would recommend this video set, it definitely has some worthwhile parts.  I just don't think I'll use anything but the 2nd and 3rd video.",1391472000,,1003,4.467032967032967

I was starting to get lower back pain from my weakening abs and tried some other workout videos that were embarrassingly much too difficult. This workout is perfectly easy and is broken down into quick 10 minute sections. It didn't make me feel frustrated or overwhelmed at all. The instructor is delightfully very pregnant and obviously knows what a good range of motion is for pregnant ladies. The moves are all modified familiar Pilates moves and other simple toning, not crazy difficult combinations. If you are in excellent shape have a perfect core this workout might be too easy but if are like me and having been totally skipping ab workouts or maybe haven't done much before, I recommend this.

2867919,5,B000RIWARG,"I was a yoga snob for the longest time until I discovered pilates.  While I love both, pilates, in my opinion is far superior.  That said, this dvd is just mat pilates.  You will need two pillows and weights to be able to follow along, but what I love is the pace of the instructor and how she explains things very easily.  She is also very pregnant in the video.  I'm currently 25 weeks pregnant with my 2nd child and needed a solution for working out at home since I also have a 2.5 year old toddler.  I can do the whole dvd in 50 minutes or choose from one of the five 10 minute sessions.  All the sessions are really great and while I""m not necessarily huffing and puffing and breaking a major sweat, I know I'm getting a good workout and stretch in.

I always bought prenatal exercise DVD's at the start but could never get into any of them or do them regularly.

With this pregnancy I decided to try harder. It would have been just good intentions if it wasn't for discovering this DVD. I love the instructor and everything about the routine and its presentation. It's not annoying or boring. It's easy to do but also makes me feel better.

Pre-pregnancy I would run about 10-15 miles a week and do barre-method ballet workouts 2x/week and then a very intense strength training session once a week.  I am quite fit and have good muscle tone and a strong core.  I continued my normal routine for the first trimester, simply skipping any jumping-rope or trampoline based exercises.  By my second trimester, I began to worry that perhaps I wasn't doing appropriate workouts for my ""condition"", as my belly has popped out now and is definitely a bit in the way.  I also was at the stage where laying on your back for extended periods of time was no longer medically sound for the baby - so I moved onto specifically prenatal workouts (in addition to continuing my cardio which I switched from running to the elliptical).  I have four prenatal DVDs that I ordered here on Amazon:

- this one (10 min prenatal pilates solutions)
-suzanne bowens long and lean
-summer sanders prenatal
-suzanne bowens barre workout

Those are in order from easiest to most challenging (IMO).  This DVD is quite mild and doesn't ever make me sweat or feel intensity, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I save it for a day of the week where I'm feeling lazy and would be proud of myself to accomplish anything at all, but am not up to the challenge of one of the other work outs.  Lizbeth is easy to follow, though the first few times you may miss out on a rep or two by watching her to find the proper form, but by the third time - you should be able to follow easily without needing to constantly study her movements. I feel very relaxed and like I got a good stretch in after I've completed this DVD-  but like I said, I don't feel like I worked out.

 If you're a beginner at exercise, this may be right up your alley.  The only thing that worries me is whether we should be doing crunches, etc while pregnant -- I've heard that you shouldn't if you want to avoid diastasic recti (which we obviously all do). She does have pillows supporting her though, so the crunches/roll-ups are much less intense than they would be otherwise.

All in all, I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a very mild, calming exercise routine -- just don't expect to get an intense work out, and you won't be disappointed :)",1390780800,2,2352,4.460280373831775
2867922,5,B000RIWARG,"I am 25 weeks pregnant. Before pregnancy I was very active but those activities weren't pregnancy friendly (high-intensity). I got into a lazy streak and just recently decided to try this video. So glad I did! Lizbeth Garcia does an excellent job of modifying Pilates exercises to make them safer and more comfortable for a growing belly. Nothing is overly strenuous and I had no problem making it through all of the workouts in one sitting. I was definitely surprised at how out of shape I've gotten already because theses exercises would normally feel too easy. After the workout I was left comfortable and energized (not sweaty and exhausted) and I feel like these will really help with growing back pain as my belly grows. If you're in an exercise slump like me and looking for some quick stimulation, set everything aside and go for it. Even after the first 10 minute segment you'll be glad you did!",1390608000,2,904,4.727848101265823

The reviews are right-- this is challenging, and I fee like I am getting a good workout without overexerting myself. I felt the ""burn"" during and after-- it was great to get in a quick workout that didn't make me feel like I was just going through the motions and taking it easy. Plus, I ordered it on my Kindle, so I can take it with me anywhere and sneak in a good workout.",1390348800,,511,4.12

I like that there are a lot of different segments, so you can do different ones or different combinations each time, and so you don't get bored of the exercises.

I was surprised that this DVD uses dumbells for many of the segments (1-3 pound weights are recommended); I didn't have any so I went out and bought some.  I'm actually quite glad for the upper body toning; my arms are quite weak and I probably wouldn't get around to exercising them otherwise.

However, the postnatal workout should be titled, ""Core workout for the impossibly fit who have never been pregnant.""  Not only is the instructor a different person who looks like a barbie with a perfect belly and no stretch marks, but the challenge level is so high it will induce the average new mom to tears and frustration!!

She does all of my favorite pilates moves too!",1387238400,,318,4.063492063492063

I also enjoy the music - peppy enough to keep me moving but still restful and relaxing so I didn't make me feel like I needed to push myself too fast!  I've recommended this DVD to many friends by word of mouth, as it seems like just the right mix between ""workout"" and ""stretch"" for a pregnant mom.

[Note, I also did the post partum section and it really helped!!  Then I started the whole routine over again when we started trying to conceive #2 & I felt in SO MUCH BETTER CONDITION for the WHOLE pregnancy because I started even before getting pregnant!

Add to that that my baby was breech and you can imagine the discomfort. This video was something I could do, regardless of how uncomfortable and sick I was feeling. In fact, the stretches often made me feel better. The 10-minute segments kept it from being overwhelming on any day, and the ability to combine them for a longer workout helps keep it interesting. There is even a short postnatal workout that is great, too. I only wish they had an entire video for postnatal exercise and recovery. The few I have tried are too long or too hard, or both. I would definitely recommend this for any pregnant woman.",1386633600,,783,4.52112676056338

I do feel like I'm not really getting that amazing of a workout though, but its hard to compare because I have never done pilates before.  I'm more of a yoga or hardcore workout kind of girl, but being pregnant I wanted to try more low impact workouts.  I think this is ok for what it is.

My only complaint is that it's not quite aerobic enough for me as I don't break a sweat and don't get my heart rate up and I wish she spent more time on stretching after the exercises. I like to use this video on opposite days of my other workouts (biking/walking/Prenatal Fitness Fix video)",1385337600,,396,4.591549295774648
2867960,5,B000RIWARG,I used this video to change up my workout and hopefully get some new stretches to work with. I started this when I was just in my 3rd trimester. The core work section was pretty difficult for me but it gave me a challenge on the days I felt up for it. I loved how it worked the whole body.,1385078400,,289,3.8333333333333335
2867961,5,B000RIWARG,This is a well organized and fun to follow work out. There are five 10 minute segments to choose from so you can create your own customized workout.

2867962,5,B000RIWARG,"This work out is easy enough to feel comfortable doing while pregnant. The stretching portion is particularly helpful during pregnancy, allowing you to stretch all the tightest parts affected by a growing baby--lower back and hips. It is awesome that the workouts are only 10 minutes long. I find that one section alone isn't enough for me to feel like I've really gained anything. She isn't an annoying instructor and she is VERY good about keeping the repetitions balanced. You do need a pair of weights and a couple of king sized pillows, which isn't listed on the packaging. I like that I can choose the order that I do the different sections. It gives some variety to the workout. I don't know that this particular series would be good for women that were already experienced pilates users before becoming pregnant. I'm sure there are modifications that could be done to make it more challenging though.",1384905600,,908,4.826923076923077

2867975,5,B000RIWARG,"I have been doing a 10 minute session every morning before work. It really gets me going in the morning and feeling connected.  I tone different parts of the body with each one.  Sometimes I tack on a few more at night when I get home, but it is not hard to find 10 minutes right now.  The instructor is great and tells you exactly when and how you should be breathing. I always forget to breathe so this is great.  I highly recommend!",1384819200,,435,4.142857142857143
2867976,3,B000RIWARG,"I have to say that what I love most about this video is the ability to just do 10 minutes for the days you are particularly busy (or lazy). It's very simple to pick from the list of videos and put them together into any combination you like, which is also great for the days you'd like to do a 20,30, or 40 minute workout.

However, I can't say that this is much of a workout. I'm almost in my third trimester and the ""total body"" series is the only one that seems remotely challenging. If you've never worked out prior to pregnancy, this will be nice. If you are used to a difficult, challenging workout (Jillian Michaels circuit training, etc) - you'll find this feels more like a warm up than a real workout.",1384732800,,711,4.266666666666667

2867978,5,B000RIWARG,This is the best prenatal pilates video. I've used for 2 pregnancies and feel so much better after doing it.

2867979,4,B000RIWARG,It's good product! It is working properly.  My wife is working with this video and she had a delivery.  She said that it was so helped her.  When she had the first one she did not have the video and she has one month to recover but the second delivery she had the video and she recover only one week.  It might not be because of this video but it definitely helped her.,1383350400,,369,4.013698630136986

2867981,5,B000RIWARG,"I ordered a few different workouts for my pregnancy and I love this the most! It's very easy to select different combinations of the 5 workouts, and put them in the order you want them in. If you only have 20 minutes, just pick 2. Or if you are really pressed for time, just pick 1! Sometimes I do that and then after will start another one, so it's also a good motivator to think ""I'll just do 10 minutes"". The 10-minute length per segment is perfect, and during the workouts it seems like when I start getting ""tired"" of a certain exercise, she switches to a new one. I will try to do this one day and then my next workout walk on a treadmill to get more cardio (or if you don't have a treadmill, I recommend one of the Leslie Sansone walking workouts - they aren't pregnancy focused but you don't need them to be!).",1382832000,,818,4.1835443037974684
2867982,5,B000RIWARG,This was a nice relaxing workout routine towards the end of my pregnancy. I really didn't use it until third trimester when my standard workouts were too intense for the size of my belly. It was very helpful for stretching out my back and hips to relieve the pain. It's also in short enough segments I could always ft in at least one a day.,1382486400,,340,4.246153846153846
2867983,4,B000RIWARG,"I love that you can pick and choose which workouts you want to do or you can do all of them! There's also a bonus workout for abs after you have the baby. I know some people complain that you're not supposed to lay flat on your back when you're late in pregnancy, but it's easy to put some pillows under you during the exercises she does on her back - or skip those parts! I like the instructor because she's not obnoxious or condescending like a lot of them. I'm 16 weeks along, and when I do the full 50 minute workout, I can feel it in my muscles, but I don't feel out of breath, which is good when you're pregnant.

But as I progress (now I'm 6 months), the short, simple segments are really great especially since I don't have a lot of time most days. Also I love that she's pregnant too. The stretching segment is good when you don't have time for anything else. Helps with the typical pregnancy back aches and random pains. I have another DVD (Suzanne Bowen's Barre Workout for pregnancy) that provides a little bit of a more intense workout, which ends up being the perfect mix.",1381795200,2,585,4.4766355140186915
2868006,5,B000RIWARG,Better than I expected.  I love that you can make your own workout routine.

2868009,5,B000RIWARG,"I really enjoyed doing this video during my pregnancy, and found that it helped a lot with my back pain that started early in the middle of my second trimester (especially the stretching / flexibility section). There are 5 10 minute sections and I love that you can build your own workout to be as short or as long as you have time or energy for. I also did a lot of traveling for work during my pregnancy and this was very easy to do in my hotel room because you don't need a lot of space, and I just laid a towel or blanket on the floor, used some of the extra pillows, and for the parts that used weights I either used water bottles or just did it without weights.

Standing pilates - I found this one to be the most challenging (which was a good thing!) and liked the squats and pelvic exercises

Core pilates - other than the flexibility portion I probably did this one the most often, although I found it was a lot more difficult / uncomfortable around halfway through my 3rd trimester.

Buns / thighs pilates - definitely works the buns and thighs! This one made me the most sore, and some of the exercises were tough when I started having pelvic / round ligament pain, but once I made it through I think it was helping to strengthen and stretch those muscles.

Total body pilates - not quite as tough as the standing pilates (probably because you get to sit on the floor for most of it!) but I still liked that it worked a lot of muscle groups

PIlates for flexibility - I did this one multiple times a week because it really helped stretch my muscles and ease back pain. At only 10 minutes long it was so easy to do right before bed or first thing in the morning.",1380067200,,1672,4.2125
2868010,5,B000RIWARG,"I love this workout!  Not too hard...not too easy.  There are several different workouts broken down into 10 minute sessions, some harder than others, so you can pick and choose which one(s) you want to do depending on how you are feeling that day.  The ""Pilates for Flexibility"" workout is my favorite.  The stretching exercises feel so good to do and are easy enough to follow (even days when you are feeling stiff and bloated).  I know some reviews mentioned they didn't like this video because there are times throughout the workouts when you are lying on your back (not supposed to do when pregnant).  I really don't think that is an issue. Not lying on your back is recommended because of circulation issues.  The few times in this video where you are on your back, you are either propped up with pillows, or if you are flat on your back it's only for a very brief time and you are actively moving your legs and getting circulation.... it's not like you are sleeping or lounging on the couch for long periods of time.  But if it still concerns you... there is a great ""Standing Pilates"" workout and plenty of other things to do if you want to skip the few parts on your back.",1379980800,,1181,4.46046511627907

I was a high intensity workout maniac thriving on running marathons, turbo fire, p90x and bikram yoga but with pregnancy I scaled it way down to walking, jogging, swimming, and doing my own workouts with weights. This dvd is fun, easy to follow, gives you an all body workout in under an hour and is something I can see myself doing even after I give birth with modifications that make it harder. In the workout there's parts that recommend using 1-3lb dumbells. I used 5lbs and got a major burn. Ive tried Pilates before but never enjoyed it this much. The trainer is clear in directions which are fluid in sequence and each side you work on is even in numbers. Ive done workouts before that aren't and it just makes you feel incomplete. I also purchased the Perfect Pregnancy Workout which I enjoy but I like this Pilates workout more. I feel I target more areas with this workout and this workout feels more fresh and new. I like the background setting which is bright and more lively whereas the Perfect Pregnant W/O is dark and less motivating. In this Pilates dvd you can workout in 5 separate 10min sets that target different areas or you can do the whole series at once in 50min or you can modify the 50min in the order you like. I say go with the whole 50 one time. Once you start you'll feel great and it's fun enough that once you're done it won't feel like 50min went by.

Then I usually pick one or two other 10 minute exercises then switch it up throughout the week. I highly recommend it!",1379289600,,415,4.473684210526316
2868026,4,B000RIWARG,"I like that it's divided into different sections so you can customize your workout and just do what you want to do for that day.  I enjoy all but the core pilates workout--I feel very uncomfortable on my back, so I just skip that one.  I'm 18 weeks along, and sometimes I feel like the exercises are too simple or easy, but I'm sure I'll appreciate that as I get further along!

I haven't gotten bored of this yet. Work outs are at a good pace for most people. There are a couple sections that she has you laying flat on your back. I just modify that by putting a pillow under my back so I'm on somewhat of an incline. Other than that, I love this dvd!",1379289600,,450,4.067415730337078
2868028,4,B000RIWARG,"I'm giving this 4 ""I like it"" stars because it is almost perfect but I was a little bored with some of the stuff. I stopped doing regular pilates classes at 28 weeks mostly because a lot of the moves (planks, push-ups) left me with my belly hitting the ground and not giving me the best results for my effort. I really like how you can do all of the sections of this video or pick and choose your own sequence for the workout. I liked most of the sections, my least favorite was the ab section, not really feeling that it does much. But ya know what, if you are willing to put in 50 minutes of movement throughout your pregnancy daily, this video is worth it. You will work up a sweat but I would definitely recommend adding at least 30 mins of cardio no matter what.

Good luck

2868032,5,B000RIWARG,"I bought several pregnancy workout videos, and thought it would be a good idea to write a review of all of them at once: Amiras Bellydance and Yoga for Pregnancy; 10 Minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates; Shiva Reas Prenatal Yoga; Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1; Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout.  Let me start this by saying that before my pregnancy, my level of fitness was somewhere in between couch potato and world-class athlete  I usually worked out a few times a week, doing 20-30 minutes cardio and some light weight-lifting, but was not running marathons or anything like that.  I wanted to maintain a similar level of fitness during my pregnancy, while building muscles and flexibility specific to labor and burning enough calories to offset my very increased appetite.  Whether you get one of these or not, my overall advice is that working out during pregnancy really, really helps  it helped me stay more comfortable as I expanded and my center of gravity shifted, it helped me feel good about the changes that were happening to my body, and it helped prepare me for a relatively smooth and manageable labor and delivery (no medication).

Amiras Bellydance and Yoga for Pregnancy: This was one of my favorites, and I think in the long run it really helped prepare my body for labor; it also helped me to relax, stretch, and feel good as I got bigger and bigger.  Some of the reviews here point out that it is not a very intense workout  thats true, but I felt like there was plenty of stretching and strengthening, and through much of my pregnancy high intensity was not what I was looking for  the goal of this video is not to increase athleticism, but to help the body adjust to pregnancy and prepare for labor.  Amira is a very encouraging coach, and much of the commentary is designed to be relaxing, informative, and comforting; I also appreciated that she looked like a real pregnant woman in the video, rather than a super fit, still skinny woman who just happened to have a bump.  The bonus material  interviews and some dance performances  was not all that appealing to me, but I liked Amiras intro statement about her own experience and the history of bellydance.  The interviews might be more interesting/helpful for someone who doesnt have sisters/girlfriends who have been through this before.

10 Minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates: This was another favorite.  I really like the format, where you can choose how many of the 10-minute segments to do, and in what order, and I felt like the workouts were manageable and well-suited to pregnant bodies.  Towards the end of my pregnancy, I was doing the flexibility workout more than the others and often just one or two at a time, but for the first two trimesters, I would usually do three of the workouts at a time.  I was somewhat familiar with pilates already, but not an expert by any means, and I found the workouts easy to follow (with a little practice needed the first few times); I think this would be good for those new to pilates, and the format means that even people who are not used to working out can start off with a manageable amount and work up from there.  The instructor sometimes gives conflicting cues about breathing patterns, but generally she is clear, informative, and easy to follow.  Seeing someone well into her 3rd trimester doing these exercises was very inspiring.  Some of the workouts don't require any equipment, but some require light hand weights and/or pillows.

Shiva Reas Prenatal Yoga: I didn't get this until near the end of my pregnancy, but the few times I did it made me wish I had it earlier.  The pace and level of difficulty are definitely geared towards beginners, and much of the emphasis is on toning and stretching in ways that are particularly geared towards pregnancy and labor (kegel exercises and hip stretches).  This is a very relaxing and slow-paced video  not a killer workout that will leave you sweating and panting.  There are modifications for each trimester, but with many of the moves, I found I could do the 1st trimester version and didn't need the modifications.  It did require some equipment: a yoga blanket (? Not sure what this is  I just used a regular blanket folded up), a strap (I used the belt from a bathrobe), and a yoga brick (this was needed for some of the later trimester modifications  I just skipped it).

Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1: I had read great reviews of this, but was disappointed and only used it a few times.  Basically, it was too strenuous for my pregnant self  the instructor is a world-class athlete and I guess this is the workout she had put together for herself during her pregnancy  nothing wrong with that, but her level of fitness and her fitness goals were just a little different from mine, and I really couldn't keep up.  That said, there were a few moves that I liked and did separately when I just needed something quick (like the labor squats).  I did like it that kegels were built into this.  If you feel you are up to it, it is an intense and thorough workout.  The final section, on preparing yourself mentally by doing an intense endurance exercise, seemed silly to me at the time, and it still seems silly now that Ive been through labor: 3 minutes of arm circles is difficult, but conquering this difficulty will not be enough to prepare you for making it through labor (which can be manageable if you are well-prepared!).

Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout: This video was ok, and definitely offers a thorough workout, but it was not my favorite.  It has three separate workouts, one for each trimester, and you can choose the complete version or an express version for each one (I think the complete version is just the express workout repeated a second time)  I almost always did the express version.  The 1st trimester workout was way too hard for me (I wanted to spend most of my 1st trimester sleeping), the 2nd trimester workout was just about right in terms of intensity, and the 3rd trimester workout was a little too light (for me).  The moves here are fairly traditional and will certainly tone major muscles groups without any frills; I would have appreciated more stretching.  There were a few pregnancy-specific moves that I often did separately (labor lunges, plie squats).  Summer Sanders and her trainer/sister-in-law are encouraging, but their chatter doesnt hold up well and starts to get annoying after watching it a few times.",1378080000,5,6440,4.737219730941704
2868033,5,B000RIWARG,"I bought this when I was three months pregnant and have used it for my whole pregnancy. I like how you can mix and match your exercises programs, (which is helpful when your energy levels are all over the place). The exercises are the perfect amount of stretching and light lifting. Nothing is too strenuous and its easy to follow along. I usually don't do exercise videos but this was well worth it.

2868046,3,B000RIWARG,"I've tried this tape a few times, and I always feel that same way: concerned. Some of the exercises seem to be unsafe for pregnant women, and they are sometimes done at a rather quick pace. There is a lot of lying on your back, which is a no-no (although one of the sections does use a cushion, which is fine). Not all sections make me feel uncomfortable, but overall, there are much better tapes out there.",1377820800,,407,4.298701298701299
2868047,5,B000RIWARG,"I love this video b/c you can squeeze in a quick workout and get your heart rate up in not a lot of time.  While the ideal is 30 min of activity daily, sometimes it is hard to fit that in all at once.  The instructor is in her 3rd trimester and she explains slight modifications for all trimesters.  Her pilates moves are very fluid and move quickly, so if you decide to only do one session, you have an elevated heart rate, if you continue with others, you will sweat.

**still love doing this dvd at 28 weeks.  Actually, it is probably my favorite as you don't feel pressured to commit to a long workout.  Just do 10 min and see if you feel like another 10 min(and another...or just do the stretching).  I do modify my moves to not lie on my back as often as she does.  I am sure it is OK to do that, as she is not there long.",1377561600,,828,3.9757575757575756
2868048,4,B000RIWARG,"I really enjoyed the workout! It feels low impact and easy to do but you also feel like you're doing a lot of toning which I totally need right now.

My only negative is that I didn't want to wait for the DVD to ship (and in this world of digital EVERYTHING, who needs another psychical DVD???) so I purchased the amazon instant video and you kinda have to do the whole workout. You can pick and choose which ones you want to do. It's one long 55 minute workout video. Sure, you can try to fast forward through segments using the oh so friendly ""move the bar"" method but it's easier just to do the whole video.

Btw: if you wanted to fast forward through they are ever 4th min in 10 min increments (i.e. 4, 14, 24 etc.)",1377388800,,719,4.128571428571429
2868049,5,B000RIWARG,"I used this video from the very beginning of my pregnancy at 11 weeks. I continued to do these yoga exercises through the second and third trimester. The video also comes with a ten minute ab blasting routine for after childbirth, which I have done about three times.
During the first trimester, I could feel my muscles being sore from using muscles I hadn't used before. It really helped shape and tone my body. I believe it helped keep my energy level so high during pregnancy.
Through the second trimester, the workout began to feel really good. I didn't feel sore after working out, and it helped a lot with managing stress.
The third trimester seemed to be the most useful time. It helped a lot with back pain, I noticed instantly that if I went more than a week without using the video, back pain would begin, but as soon as I completed a workout session, I would feel much better. Towards the end of my pregnancy, I could feel the baby drop lower from doing the pelvic tilts, and I really feel that these workouts made for my easy labor.
During labor, both having a toned body and knowing how to control my breathing helped tremendously. I definitely think this video does a great job of helping prepare for birth.
My recovery was pretty quick, I grant most of the credit to yoga throughout pregnancy.
The abs video for post-natal is amazing, it really challenges the abs. I felt like I was using muscles I didn't know I had.
Overall, this 10 minute solutions video is perfect for the entire journey of motherhood. I am very pleased to have found it.",1377216000,5,1557,4.5053003533568905

After downgrading my workout routine from running to walking after I found out I was pregnant, I was later stalled entirely by the dreaded ""morning"" sickness. I resumed walking, but my midwife recommended adding Pilates to the mix to help with some round ligament pains and sciatica issues I was having (it's working!).

I really, really enjoy this video. The 10 minute segments are perfect, because even on a lazy or busy day, you probably have ten whole minutes to run through a routine. It is not so difficult that I have to stop or get frustrated that I can't keep up. It is appropriately challenging - I had pleasantly sore glutes the day after I did the standing routine. In all I've found it the perfect level of challenge for someone who has been active but might have lost some fitness after spending a few weeks on the couch eating Saltines.

It also has a 10 minute stretch portion that is divine!  My mother loves this video as well.  She comes to my house and we do it together.  Mom says it leaves her feeling relaxed and limber for the rest of the day.  I walk for about 40 minutes 3-4 times a weeks in addition to doing this video about 3-4 times a weeks as well.

However, with this one, she just jumps into each exercise with no explanation. Perhaps because I do not have a strong Pilates background, I felt that it was not safe to be doing the exercises at the pace she was doing them especially since she gives no advice on whether your form is correct or not.

Normally, I would keep with it and figure out form as I go, but since I am pregnant, I fear that using improper form could have negative consequences for the baby, not just me. I also feel that her lack of explanation makes me question her knowledge of workout safety while pregnant overall.

These little workouts made me feel great and I was able to do them even when my belly got crazy huge. I also had some pretty severe sciatica, and the stretching segment helped relieve some of the associated pain. And how many of you ladies know that absolutely any sciatica pain relief during pregnancy is pretty much priceless?

2868110,5,B000RIWARG,"Ok, first off I am writing this from a husband's perspective. My wife was the one who used this DVD to stay fit and active during her pregnancy. I joined in on some occasions since it couldn't hurt. I must say this is the perfect DVD for the pregnancy months. Why? The answer is in the title - ""10 Minute Solution"".

My wife is very busy and when it comes to exercising, squeezing in time for it is a challenge each day. It is very easy to say dang I don't have 30 minutes to an hour today to exercise or I don't feel good (since you are pregnant obviously) and soon one finds themself not exercising at all. But EVERYONE can find 10 minutes in their busy day, and this format makes exercising while you are pregnant doable. The DVD has 5 workouts you can do with each one being 10 minutes. So if you have extra time you can do a couple or a few of the exercises. Or if you are like us, maybe you'll find the one 10 minute workout is just the right amount each day.

So no you will not be the most in shape pregnant woman out there, but this DVD makes working out doable, and my wife looked great during her pregnancy. Lizbeth was a great instructor/encourager too!",1370563200,,1165,4.150442477876106

The idea should be that if you have only 10 minutes here or 20 minutes there then you do a workout or two at a time, or a full 50 minute workout if you want. The video itself advocates this, but the problem is with actually doing them in sequence. The props change each time and the mat is in a different place on each video. This is pretty annoying, since you have to adjust everything between each workout segment. There is no time to adjust this, so you have to pause between each segment- she just jumps into the workout. What's more annoying is that the few workouts with the same setups aren't even next to each other in the order presented- which means going back to a certain setup over and over again- which just feels like poor segment order. I would give it more stars, despite bad flow, if not for the workouts. I didn't feel like the buns and thighs workout actually worked my buns and thighs. I also found some of the exercises too stressful on my lower back and neck. Not that great; I wouldn't buy it if I had it to do over again.",1369785600,,1085,4.221153846153846

3) Each 10min segment keeps me motivated to do more. Pregnancy has its own issues with either being lethargic or nauseated therefore having a exercise programme that keeps you motivated is ++++++.

The DVD does go threw the exercises quickly but after you do it a couple times you won't have a problem.  My buns where burning with in 3 mins of the Buns & Thighs Section.

I would recommend this to anyone that wants a decent workout that you can change up on a daily basics.

I do this on the days that I don't go to Bikram Yoga, along with another DVD that is top rated on amazon.",1368576000,,620,3.888888888888889

Also, read other reviews about lying on back...it's not that long.

I have a lot of hip pain at night while sleeping and I did the ""buns and thighs"" pilates section with about 20 minutes of another yoga tape and I slept pain free that night.

This is my 5th baby and I have lost the weight after each pregnancy to date by staying active during and after. This is great for us moms with other little kiddos, trying to find an entire hour to work out is nearly impossible, but sneaking 10 minutes in here and there throughout the day makes me feel like I am at least doing something.

I love that there are five 10-minute sessions, so you could exercise for 10 minutes or up to 50 minutes.  Some require light weights (I use 3 lb. weights), and that's great to help keep your arms toned a bit.  She also uses them for squats and lunges, and I've honestly felt that in my glutes afterwards.  I'm at the end of my 2nd trimester, and I don't have the stamina for long work outs.  For cardio, I'll do the elliptical or walk, but I always turn to this for stretching and muscle toning.  I highly recommend it for pregnant women!",1366416000,,671,4.32

The movements are classic pilates moves, some adjusted for pregnancy.  The workouts always make me feel relaxed and flexible. I didn't find the workouts particularly challenging until the 3rd trimester when I could really tell my balance had changed.  They are still pretty easy, so a good workout to do on the days you know you need to do something, but can't face a more challenging workout.  The instructor is laid back, descriptive of how to do the moves, and keeps the workouts moving along at a speedy pace -- something I like a lot.",1365984000,,675,4.4471544715447155

I would have given it 5 stars if it had some cardio options, which I know isn't really pilates, but it meant I needed another DVD for that. I love this DVD when I don't feel 100% or if I just don't have time for a 30 minute workout.
She does a good job of packing a full workout in 10 minutes. Even though I've been doing this workout for months, it isn't boring, I can still feel it and she hasn't gotten annoying (like some instructors can after too long)",1365811200,,546,3.9727272727272727

2868154,2,B000RIWARG,"I want so bad to like this video. The instructor is energetic, the music, too - and the workouts so neatly packaged into little do-able 10 minute segments. But whether you're feeling slightly distracted today, or aren't a pilates expert - a few more pointers on how to keep this workout safe are desperately needed! The #1 danger for pregnant women for this type of workout out, is that it becomes an ab workout rather than a true pilates workout which engages much deeper - the TVA. too much abs, and it can pull on the TVA in ways you'd like to avoid. I need those extra reminders to engage the TVA - CORRECTLY - to ensure I am not setting myself up for diastis recti, which impacts 1/3 of all first time pregnancies (if not more). How about a workout where quality rather than quantity is the goal? Where I'm not tempted to push too hard by fear of birthing or of post-birthing body? I'll take, instead, a safe, hi-quality pregnancy workout that really strengthens what needs strength today - having faith it builds my capabilities tomorrow.",1365465600,4,1044,4.558510638297872

Within 8 wks post partum back in my regular clothes and only a few pounds away from starting weight. Mind you I am a dietitian but I tell everyone it was prenatal Pilates that helped everything get back to where it should be and I had a c-section.

It's hard to get motivated to workout at this point in my pregnancy (7 months) and sometimes telling myself to 'just do 10 minutes' is what gets me into a workout that usually lasts longer than 10 minutes. I love the work outs and I'm surprised by how sore I was at first! I did a lot of walking/jogging through my first trimester but as I progressed into the second and now third I'm loving this pilates dvd. She does a great job accommodating for the needs of pregnancy and I've never had any problems with the short periods of time that I was on my back, usually she has you put a pillow behind you anyway. I'm pretty sure I'll use this video beyond pregnancy even (even beyond postpartum period) because I feel like it's just my speed of a work out. LOVE IT!",1364169600,,810,4.132911392405063

This is great because it stretches a lot of areas that you wouldn't think to stretch otherwise and still does a little cardio and strength training. I always feel much better after I do the video. It has 5 different 10 minute workouts to do so I tend to go down the line and do one every day of the week. It makes for a nice variety.
Overall a very good workout video for a pregnant lady. :)",1363824000,,473,3.9894736842105263

I try to fit in at least 1-2 workouts each day, and it's been easy to, despite how busy I am with my two kids (age 3 & 5) and my full-time job.  I love the 10-minute segments, because I can always finish a full workout.  With the 30-minute workouts, I would always get interrupted by something or someone.  I'm 5 months pregnant with my third child, and after these workouts, I feel so great.  After just over a week of doing these workouts, my body feels tighter and longer.

I love that you can customize your workout and pick the ones you want to do in the order you want to do them and it will go through them one right after the other.  She moves through the workouts pretty quickly (which I love because its not boring) and when you are done you are amazed that ten minutes have already gone by.
My only tiny complaint is that I wish she would do some more reps on some of the workouts and unless you keep your controller really close you don't have time to pause it and do more reps of a certain exercise so you actually 'feel the burn' on some of them. Other than that, I absolutely adore this dvd and am so happy that I bought it to help me stay flexible and toned during my pregnancy.",1363651200,,821,4.125

I really like how you can do a 10-minute segment or combine them for longer workouts. They are not terribly challenging for me right now at 22 weeks, but would be great for the days when you want to rest or focus on flexibility. I think these workouts will come in handy in the third trimester!",1362873600,,437,3.977272727272727
2868166,3,B000RIWARG,"My biggest problem with all the pregnancy DVD's is that they are WAY too fast.  1) there is no stretching before hand 2) there are NO EXPLANATIONS.  She breaks everything down into 10 minute segments which she should really do in 15 so she has time to explain and then do the moves.  To me it just seems like she is rushing way too much just to say that it is a 10 minute workout.  If you want a real workout, take the time to do each move twice as much.  By the time you really get into a move she's onto the next one and half way through it.

Bottom line, if you're in good exercise shape before pregnancy, then you won't find this very useful until month 8 or 9.  I would suggest if anything, write down the exercises then do them on your own so you aren't so rushed and can do more and get a better workout and better stretch.  (yea, her ""stretches"" in the middle of a workout are like 5 seconds, seriously, what is that all about)",1362873600,,935,4.0710382513661205

On days when I feel sluggish, I will do a quick 10 minutes (or 2) to perk myself up.

During my first pregnancy I started with private pilates lessons and then moved on to group prenatal. At the beginning of my second pregnancy I did yet another group prenatal run by a nurse / yoga instructor. Absolutely nothing compares to the workout that I get doing this video . I often don't have time to do the full 50 min work out, but I love that I can pick and choose the areas I'd like to concentrate on. None of it is so hard that I feel uncomfortable, but after doing it I find that my energy levels and mood really pick up.

For a while I used this as an excuse to not do much.  However I started to get some stiffness and back pain (well, duh) from being so stationary.  I ordered this and a prenatal yoga dvd to help combat my laziness and pain.  I thought the yoga would help me more, but I hated it.  This system on the other hand is fantastic for making you feel great in short amount of time.  I always feel amazing even after doing only one of the segments.  There are 5 different segments: core, butt and thighs, standing, flexibility, and total body.  There is also a postnatal workout that I haven't gotten to yet because I'm still pregnant.  Each of the segments are 10 minutes long, so if you're pressed for time you can just do one.  You can also create a custom workout to do just 2, 3, or 4 in whatever order you choose.  I always recommend ending with the flexibility one because it rounds it all out nicely and feels so great.  I also try to do the flexbility right before bed and after getting up in the mornings.

Word of caution:  If you were extremely fit and strong before your pregnancy, you may not find this very challenging.  I just know that for someone who had fallen off track with fitness it is a great program for getting back into a routine that makes you feel you can be strong again.",1362182400,,1445,4.238095238095238

I love that you can choose to do just one 10 minute workout if you're feeling really tired, or the whole 50 minutes if you're feeling energetic. You can also use the menu to personalize your own workout and it will automatically move through them without having to return to the main menu after each segment.

I really like the instructor and find her easy to listen to and follow (which is not the case for many workout DVDs), and the music is not overpowering.

The 10 minute segments make it feel doable, even if you're doing more than one at a time. The intensity of this workout feels just right to me - enough that I feel it's a little challenging, but not enough that I feel overwhelmed.",1361318400,,808,4.337748344370861

It's intensity level is fairly low, but you can make it more or less intense by changing your weights or making motions smaller or larger.  There is not a lot of cardio, but it does get your heart rate up.  I like to do 10-30 minutes in the morning before work and have realized if I do this I feel so much better all day.  The 10 minute flexibility segment is really nice at night time before bed (or after a workout as a cool down). I bought it on amazon streaming, so I can play it from anywhere I can access my account (great for people who travel).

I didn't need to support my body in the same way she did, but the moves are a good workout regardless.  Don't expect a high intensity/deep sweat...this is a low intensity, low impact, strengthening and stretching working.  The video is broken up into different 10 minute sections that you can choose from to create your own workout.  My sister said that all of the exercises the doctor recommended were included in the routines too.  So if you mix it up and do some or all of the sections throughout the week, you are preparing yourself for a healthy pregnancy/delivery.",1358035200,,666,4.6581196581196584

These workouts keep me feeling great as I am about to enter my thrid trimester. I feel strong, lean, and almost pain free as long as I do a little bit each day. If I skip a day my back starts hurting! I usually do total body or standing pilates in the morning, a 10 minute walk on one of my work breaks, and one or two workouts in the evening and there you go, my 30 minutes of moderate exercise each day.

I love doing these segments in conjunction with cardio. I try to do two of these videos before work and then cardio after work.

This is definitely challenging but not so much so that beginners cannot catch on and move up.

I would have given it 5 stars but I downloaded it through Amazon Instant on my PS3 and it doesn't let me skip through the different sections easily. (I only like to do 2 sections at a time and then end with the 10-minute flexibility section to make a total of a 30-minute workout) You actually have to fast forward through the video (like old VHS!) Unless you know exactly what minute each section begins, this is time-consuming. I would recommend the physical DVD instead (so long as that one has a menu and breaks the video into tracks. I actually don't know if it does.)",1354233600,,842,4.3630573248407645
2868213,4,B000RIWARG,"I got this DVD about 3 months into my pregnancy. I like the 10 minute segments so you can pick and choose what you want to work on depending on your schedule and how you're feeling. I am fairly petite and had a large baby so somewhere in the third trimester I stopped doing the ab workout because it was not comfortable/doable. I was still able to do all of the other segments though and felt great after getting in at least one other segment along with the stretching segment. I am 11 weeks postpartum now and still enjoy using this DVD. I think doing this DVD along with doing a lot of walking outdoors helped me stay fit through my entire pregnancy.

I also purhcased ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1"" which was a little more hard core than this DVD. I found Prenatal Pilates to be more enjoyable and ended up working out with it more.",1354060800,,843,4.3354430379746836
2868214,5,B000RIWARG,"I chose this dvd because I liked the idea of 10 minute sections which could be easily adapted into my schedule and it sounded like it had good sections.  The only pilates that I've done up until now is the Winsor Pilates dvds so that is what I have to compare it to.

I definitely like the 10 minute sections and that I can select the ones I want to do that day and create my own workout depending on time constraints and how I'm feeling that day.  And I find the instructor pleasant and easy to listen to.

I'm torn on the pace of the workouts.  On the one hand I feel like the instructor goes thru the moves to quickly and doesn't always explain them as clearly as she could.  For instance, you may already be on the 4th repetition when she finally tells you on which movement you should be breathing in and which one you be breathing out.  And it moves so quickly that sometimes I'm really forcing the breath to keep up with the moves.  On the other hand, I figure once I get use to it and I don't have to pay so much attention it'll be nice to have it keep moving and I'll probably love it.  I say this because while I love my Winsor Pilates dvds I do get frustrated having to wait thru her talking and instruction between each movement and once I know the routine well enough I end up just moving on without them and fast forwarding it to catch up with me.

I like that I recognize a lot of the traditional pilates moves but there are a lot of new ones to me, especially the ones including weights.  I have not had a chance to do all the workouts yet because I've just been too sick but I like the ones I've done so far.  I've watched the others and am excited to add some resistance training back into my routine now that I'm starting to feel better.  It seems like a good overall workout if you don't mind the quick pace.  I figure for the days I don't have the energy I'll stick to my yoga dvd.  I'm finally in my second trimester and looking forward to starting a more serious and daily routine and this will definitely be a part of it.",1353888000,,2045,4.103015075376884
2868215,4,B000RIWARG,"I was doing pilates and spin classes pre-pregnancy and like this for a light workout (it is still a workout unlike most pregnancy dvds). It's broken into 10 minute intervals so you can do 10-50 minutes depending on how you feel at different stages of pregnancy. I love that I can combine workouts that fit how I feel. In the beginning of the 2nd trimester I did the standing pilates and either the core or butt pilates. Now at the end of the second trimester I have more aches and love to do the standing pilates and the ""flexibility"" section.

This workout is the best I've found, especially for days when I don't like working too hard. Erin O'Brien does a pregnancy workout which is actually a real workout, but the video quality is terrible and Erin O'Brien is annoying.

ps you will need hand held weights. She says 1-3 pounds. If you want a little bit of a challenge go for 3-4 pounds.

UPDATE by TRIMESTER
1st: unnecessary, just do your regular exercise
2nd: the core section has a lot of on the back work elevated with a pillow. I found this very uncomfortable by half way through the 2nd trimester, but you can just choose a different section. The pilates for flexibility section should be called pilates for pregnancy aches and pains. In the first half of this trimester it was not nearly challenging enough. By the middle it was perfect for relieving hip and back aches.
3rd almost there!",1353715200,,1398,4.5396825396825395
2868216,4,B000RIWARG,"This is a great DVD to keep you motivated to exercise during pregnancy, because the choose-you-own-adventure type format, and the short 10 minute segments. However, I question the effectiveness when there are so few reps of some exercises and so little time spent holding a position or pose.

I kept this in the rotation along with 2 other DVDs just for variety while I was pregnant, but I wouldn't count on it as your sole workout.",1353542400,,432,4.684210526315789
2868217,5,B000RIWARG,I bought 4 different DVD's and this one is the best. You can choose from several 10 minute workouts to create your own custom workout. The workouts aren't too hard nor too easy.  I would recommend this to any pregnant woman.,1353369600,,224,4.463414634146342

The core section is great, it gives a good feeling of strengthening without stress.  I LOVE the full body section, and you can really feel the work in your arms.  The Buns & Thighs section does its job for sure!.  The Standing Pilates section is okay, not my favorite because I prefer Pilates to be more targeting and about stretching/strengthening; but it does get the heart rate going, so it is nice to use as the first section of your workout as a warmup.  And the Flexibility section is great to use as a cool down, and feels wonderful on the lower back.",1352851200,,685,4.230769230769231
2868219,5,B000RIWARG,"I received my three workout videos last week: ""10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates"" with Lizbeth Garcia, ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1"" with Karyne Steben, and ""Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout."" So far I have only used 10 Minute Solution twice, and the other two only once. I would like to update as I continue to use these videos but I wanted to give my thoughts so far.

10 Minute Solution has five 10-minute workouts. I am a total newbie on pilates but I loved this video. I only made it through two workouts on my first try; on my second try I got through all five. In the future I will only use the first four, and instead of the flexibility one I will do my own stretches, just because it didn't seem to go as well with my joint pain as my own stretches do.

Perfect Pregnancy vol. 1 is about 40 minutes long. Karyne gives alternate moves for intermediate and advanced, but I had to stick with the beginner moves, and it kicked my butt. Twice I even had to stop and rest because I could not keep up with her. That woman is amazingly strong. I really liked that she included a lot of ab work, because I feel like my abs need that desperately.

Summer Sanders' workout was much milder, but it was still a good workout. She does a little bit of abs, but mostly focuses on arms and legs. The workout is about 45-50 minutes long. I didn't realize that you need a resistance band. I have one, but mine is a loop and on the video she uses a straight band with handles at each end. I was able to do the leg exercises, just holding my band lower, but for the arm exercises I used a pair of 3 lb weights instead, and that worked fine.

I just wanted to say how amazed I was with the difference I felt in my own body after only one week of working out with these videos. I am 33 years old and 21 weeks along in my 5th pregnancy. I am six feet tall, so my ideal weight is between 150-160 lbs. I have sacroiliac joint dysfunction, which started in my first pregnancy, which just means that I get a lot of joint pain in the back of my right hip. This joint pain got worse with each pregnancy, until in my 3rd pregnancy I was sometimes unable to walk from one room to the next without pain. I have found that regular chiropractic appointments have helped a ton, and I walked regularly through my 4th pregnancy and that seemed to help too. But I have also noticed that my abs seem really weak, like they can't handle carrying another baby and I have felt like I really need a good ab workout.

After my first pregnancy, I got down to 145 lbs. Woo-hoo!
After my 2nd pregnancy, I stopped losing at around 155. After my 3rd it was 165, and after my 4th I never got lower than 173. So I have also been extremely concerned with this trend. I have gained too much weight during all of my pregnancies, and so far in this one I have already gained about as much as I think I should have gained for my whole pregnancy. So I hope that regular exercise will help me gain slower, as well as help my joint pain.

After only one week of working out with these videos, I have already felt a huge improvement! For the first time in weeks I didn't gain a pound this week (yay!), and although I imagine I look exactly the same, I feel better, my muscles feel tighter all over, and I feel like I look better. My joint pain is very minimal, and most of the time I don't feel any pain at all there. I am blown away with how much the joint pain has improved with just one week of working out. And my tummy feels tighter, like maybe it can handle this baby after all! I feel healthier in every way. I am really excited about such amazing results in so little time.

UPDATE 2/2013: I am now 33 weeks along. I have been favoring 10 Minute Solution, Perfect Pregnancy, and Knocked-Up Fitness with Erica Ziel, which I got a few weeks later. Over the Christmas holidays, we went out of town for a while, and I didn't exercise at all during that time, and I ate a lot more than I needed to, so at this point I am still heavier than I want to be. But I have been exercising consistently for close to a month since that break, and I am still loving these videos. I have been focusing on one video per week, which is nice to stick to something for a week but over the month I get some variety. I have been working out six days a week, and I have stopped drinking everything except water and sometimes milk, and I have been eating a lot less desserts lately. For the past few weeks my weight has pretty much stayed the same, and my back pain is very minimal. Also, I have been getting lots of compliments from my husband lately. He has noticed that my butt looks different than it has for a long time, and he says he doesn't think I have ever looked this good while being pregnant. I definitely feel better now and have more energy than I did during all of my other four pregnancies. The differences I can see are that my butt and the back of my thighs are still separate (rather than meshing together like they always did in the past), and I still have a little pouch of fat on each of my hips but it is shallower even than it was before I got pregnant, and in past pregnancies I always had a couple rolls above my belly, below my chest, and I do have one small one now but it's so much better than before. And my arms had started to get kinda floppy but now they are looking toned lately. And this is my first pregnancy without swelling in my feet and ankles. So I am still excited about my videos and hope to keep using them up until the baby comes, and then after she is born and I'm ready to exercise again, I will likely come back to these videos before going back to regular non-pregnancy videos.",1352678400,,5670,4.153776160145587
2868220,5,B000RIWARG,This product was very helpful. And very easy to use. It also helps that the instructor was pregnant at the time too. So she didn't make you do anything that she wasn't able to do!,1352332800,,179,4.142857142857143
2868221,5,B000RIWARG,"So, I didn't work out at all before pregnancy, or during my first tri. I finally got my act together mid-2nd trimester, and I LOVE this DVD. The 10 minute sections make it easy to exercise for just 10 minutes, or to mix and match what you feel like doing on a particular day. All of the exercises are super easy for anyone to do, but not under-challenging, if that makes sense. I've noticed that when I keep it up, my low back pain decreases, and I have more energy overall. The pilates for flexibility is my favorite :)

As for Lizbeth Garcia, she's great to follow, and isn't too talky or obnoxious. The only thing you might find obnoxious is her amazingly in-shape pregnant bod lol",1351987200,,684,4.3858267716535435
2868222,5,B000RIWARG,"Not too hard, but not too wimpy - just right for a pregnant lady!! It is awesome that you can ""create your own workout"" by choosing which 10 minute segments you want to do.  First few times, I did all 50 minutes, then realized I don't have time to do that everyday.  I picked my 3 favorites (Standing, core, and legs) and did those pretty much everyday.  The results so far (and I'm 20 wks/5 months prego) I haven't gained any unwanted weight other than my baby bump, and THE DAY I started doing these exercizes, my lower back pain DISAPPEARED!!!  It is comforting that Lizbeth Garcia is 36 weeks pregnant herself and she has a soothing way of leading the routine.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this video, especially considering it's under $10 - what a steal!!",1351814400,,751,4.492647058823529
2868223,5,B000RIWARG,"I highly recommend this video to anyone late in pregnancy! When I bought this DVD I was 24 weeks along with my second child and experiencing everything early! Back pain, sciatic nerve pain, and heart burn all came quicker than with my first.

I definitely recommend this DVD!!",1351468800,,434,4.64935064935065

I have alot of back/pelvis pain, hoping as I continue the workout some will be relieved, but definitely didn't make pain any worse.",1351036800,,486,4.658823529411765
2868225,2,B000RIWARG,"I decided to rent this from Amazon's Instant Videos prior to purchasing, and I'm glad I did.  I was expecting a tough pilates workout to make my muscles feel a burn, but that's not what I got from this.  Many of the moves just didn't feel good and made me concerned about injuries.  I decided to skip the entire core workout, because I've been dealing with round ligament pain and didn't want to make that worse.  I also didn't want to lie on my back that long.  Taking that out leaves you with 40 minutes of workout, 10 of which is stretching.  I also skipped that, because I was just frustrated by that point.  There were also a couple other exercises I skipped, because of the lying on your back worry.  Maybe if I could have done the entire workout it would have been better, but I don't think so.  I didn't feel like many of these moves worked much at all.  There was one part of the thigh and buns section that made me feel like I was working something, as did some of the arm exercises in the total body section.  But, other than that, it just didn't do it for me.  To give you an idea on level/intensity, I run 3-4 times a week and do strength or yoga twice a week.  I considered myself to be at an intermediate level, maybe a little higher.  If you want a good strength workout, I would suggest the Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol. 1 with Karyne Steben.  It is a great workout that really packs a punch, without making me feel like I'm hurting anything.",1350950400,2,1460,4.258181818181818

I tried 2 other videos with my first pregnancy, and I wish that I would have had this one.

I began to use it at the tail end of my second trimester, second pregnancy.  I would consider myself fairly fit but with limited pilates experience.  I can do most of the video, with the exception of the core exercises which are too challenging for me; perhaps if I had been doing pilates regularly pre-preganancy then my core would be strong enough to feel that these were safe to do.  I would not recommend this for someone entirely new to pilates as some basic understanding of proper posture and alignment will help prevent injuries.  Also, some of the moves are on the more advanced side, so don't be afraid to stay with the basic exercises depending on your level.
In some cases, I wish the instructor spend more time explaining the proper alignment / set up of specific exercises, and sometimes transitions feel rushed, but overall easy to follow and a great addition to my prenatal health.",1349740800,,1112,4.706185567010309

2868232,5,B000RIWARG,"This is a nice set of convenient, short workouts during pregnancy.  I still got most of my cardio from walking, but the 10-minute stretching workout at the end of the video really helped address muscle tension and probably saved me a ton in avoided prenatal massages.",1348963200,,267,4.804347826086956
2868233,5,B000RIWARG,"The video is great for pregnancy working out. It helps to tone every part of your body without hurting the baby in anyway. It is flexible for women with a busy work schedule and can only squeeze in 10 min here and there. However, it also allows you to have an amazing 50 min work out altogether on the weekends if you can find the time to go through the video at once. During pregnancy, this video helps me to cope with weight gain and body changes.",1348876800,,449,4.172413793103448
2868234,5,B000RIWARG,"I am very picky when it comes to working out with DVDs.  I usually find them painfully boring and they all feel like bad 80s flashbacks!  This is the only DVD workout I've used in years and I absolutely love it.  I was in fairly good shape pre-pregnancy, typically did crunches with the gym ab equipment.  Obviously, could not continue that during pregnancy, was just too straining on the back so I tried this DVD a friend gave me.  I literally felt my abs get more toned within 2 weeks of doing this regularly.  I am now 5 1/2 months and feel like my abs and lower back are in great shape as a result of faithfully doing this workout.  My pre-preg wt weight was 90 lb and my lower back started to ache even when I'd only gained about 8 lb.  I was so worried about what would happen with more weight gain as the pregnancy progressed.  After doing these exercises, my lower back pain resolved completely and has not returned!  Its great that each segment is only 10 mins, that allows you to do what you can each day, and also focus on different parts each day.  No matter how you mix/match the segments, I'd recommend doing the abs as often as possible because thats truly the part that is stressed the most and can lose a lot of its pre-pregnancy tone.  Also, the variety in this workout keeps the routine from getting boring, the background music is relaxing, and so are the exercises overall.  I feel very relaxed after doing them.  I'm so grateful my friend passed this on to me, its been immensely helpful in my pregnancy.",1347926400,,1526,4.384341637010676
2868235,5,B000RIWARG,"This is a great prenatal workout video that utilizes the foundation of Pilates. I LOVE that the video is in five 10 minute segments, and you can create your own personal workout each time you use the video.  The DVD lets you pick (in the order you want, and how many) of the five segments to do.  I often do 4 of the 5 and change up the order, I have not seen this perk in any other DVDs.  Overall the workouts are very efficient and the buns/thighs segment is challenging for anyone, pregnant or not.  I am/was an avid exerciser before this 2nd pregnancy and this is definitely a good workout, nothing fluffy about it.",1346544000,,619,4.310344827586207
2868236,5,B000RIWARG,I do some workout from this DVD almost every day and it is my favorite out of the several prenatal workout DVDs I purchased. The instructor is pleasant (not at all annoying like some instructors) and encouraging without being overzealous. The workouts are just the right intensity for me and I like that I can combine them differently. I don't get bored of the DVD that way. I recommend this DVD to all of my pregnant friends!,1345507200,,426,4.545454545454546
2868237,4,B000RIWARG,"This is a great pilates video for people who don't have a lot of time but want to get in at least 10 minutes of exercise a day while they are pregnant. I don't see an issue with the exercises while you are on your back. You are constantly moving and the segments are only 10 minutes! You won't spend more than a minute or so on your back for an exercise.

Pros:

-You can select all 5 ten minute segments (50 minutes) or you can customize the workout and pick 1 or more of the different segments. This is great particularly if you want to exercise a certain way. For instance if you know sitting isn't a good idea you can just choose the standing workout. Or if you just want to stretch a bit you can choose the pilates for flexibility segment.

-even though they are short segments, you break a sweat and really feel like you are getting in that exercise!

Cons:
-because the segments are only 10 minutes things move quickly. SO, while this video isn't advanced if you have never done pilates before it my be difficult to keep up with the different exercises and breathing techniques at first. But I guarantee after you watch it a few times you will catch on.

-some of the segments use weights (she says 1-3lbs). I wasn't prepared for this and I don't have the weights. But I just do the same motions without them. Not really a big con, but something to be prepared for.",1345075200,,1372,4.3023255813953485

So far, I can still do this workout video while watching my baby play in the morning as soon as we get up. I get him changed and dressed for the day and we sit on the living room floor with all of his toys while I workout to this video and keep an eye on him at the same time. With this baby, unlike my first, I've been having a lot of sciatic nerve pain and general back pain, radiating through my hips and legs. I'm sure it's just due to the added stress on my body from being pregnant with one baby while carrying another, sometimes squirmy, baby. After using this video every morning for about two weeks, the pain has dissipated and I feel much better. If I happen to skip the workout for a day or two, I notice a worsening of how I feel. I would recommend this not only as a way to help feel better overall, but to also get a good workout while being pregnant. It's nothing like normal, non-pregnant pilates (not as intense), but I do feel like it's making a difference in not only how I feel but tone and flexibility, too. I would recommend this video to a friend.",1341532800,,1144,4.044052863436123
2868242,5,B000RIWARG,I bought this in the beginning of my second pregnancy and I am surprised that I am still going strong with it now into my third trimester. For me it is just the right level of exertion. There are some moves that my body does not do well with but I just avoid those. So just listen to your body and don't do something that you are not comfortable with. Overall a very good workout. I have been having backaches and I notice that the days I do the workout for flexibility I instantly feel much better.

Yes, the instructor is a bit fast with her explanations but nothing that the pause button from you dvd cannot solve :o). I have some back problems and this dvd has helped me to reduce the pain. The key is to take your time, watch the whole dvd first and then plan what do you want to do. I create my routine by doing only two workouts per day and no more than 2 times per week. My objective is not to get super fit but to keep my body moving and prepare it for the delivery since it is quiet importat to train your muscles from where the baby will come out so I think this dvd has the basic to do that.

I can feel myself getting stronger and staying in shape without being completely exhausted afterward.  I am in my second trimester now and can still do all the excercises safely.  I was concerned because of statements from other reviews stating that it was unsafe to excercise on your back, but after a little more research, I saw that lying flat on your back for an EXTENDED period of time in the second and third trimester can limit bloodflow and be unsafe.  This video does NOT keep you on your back for an extended period of time and you are also propped up by pillows.  I started doing only one or two of the 10 minute segments at a time and have worked my way up to 30 minute workouts.  I feel strong, have less tension, and also have not experienced any back pain since starting the workout.",1340668800,,972,4.426966292134831

I decided I want to do more toning while I still can. I have to say I love this DVD! I have several other 10 Minute Solution DVDs that I am a huge fan of (Rapid Results Piates and Target Tone). This DVD is great; it works you out but doesn't over do it. I didn't realize how out of shape my arms had gotten in the past few months until I did the Total Body Pilates segment! Felt great :) I like doing the standing piates, buns & thighs and total body pilates as a 30 minute routine.

I am in pretty good shape, and am not over weight.  This video has been perfect!  I actually tried a few out in advance before I purchased this, and this one was the easiest to follow, kept me active and interested, and the music wasn't obnoxious.  I can set up my ideal work out depending on how I'm feeling and how much time I have, and I will be able to increase time and intensity as I get stronger--or take it easier as I get bigger.  I feel great after my work-outs, and I can feel it the next day without being over sore.  I absolutely suggest this video.",1339804800,,906,4.172413793103448

This 10 minute workout was just what I needed to get movitivated.  The DVD comes with 5 different 10 minute workouts so you can mix it up, and obviously extend your exercise if time permits.  The ""flexibility"" session has taught me how to relieve my lower back pain, I find myself waking up at night just to perform these few routines - with great success - and it only takes 5 minutes!

2868251,1,B000RIWARG,I am so disappointed with my purchase.  I bought this dvd and I have not yet been able to watch it.  We just bought a Samsung blue ray dvd player less than 3 months ago.  We've never had an issue with any dvd not playing on it still to this day.  This dvd will not even play at all!!!  It's very frustrating.  You put it in and it gets stuck on the black warning screen and will not play past that.  I totally wasted my money and am very frustrated.  I would never buy from them again since I wasn't even able to use my product not one time and it was supposed to be brand new.,1337817600,,577,3.871794871794872
2868252,5,B000RIWARG,"What a great solution!! I work about a 60+ hour week, and was finding it really difficult to find time to exercise, and then feeling really guilty that I wasn't getting it together.....  What a revelation that even 10 minutes is better than doing nothing: It's so easy to slip into the mindset that if I can't find a full hour to exercise, then the whole day is a write-off so try (and fail!) again tomorrow.

SO I have just been getting out of bed 20 minutes earlier every day (that I can manage!) to do 2 of the 5 workouts, and feeling much better because of it. I love that you can select any of the 5 in any order.... so you can do a different combo every time and it doesn't get too repetitive.  Then in the weekends when I have a bit more time I just do all 5 in a row for a decent-length workout.

I'm not in great shape anymore and it's easy for me to do but still works and is challenging on my muscles. Some reviews have criticized the fact that you have to lay on your back which isn't safe for pregnant women after the first trimester. You are only on your back for a brief time. It's not long enough to be harmful to the baby. The price is right, too. Try it!",1337299200,,512,4.13
2868255,5,B000RIWARG,"I've been doing Pilates on and off for about 5 years, so when I got pregnant I started looking for prenatal mat classes. There aren't many to choose from and the classes I found were at noon and 8pm (um, my pregnant self was only interested in lunch at noon and getting on the couch at 8pm). And unfortunately, one-on-one training on the Reformer was just out of my price range. So I started looking at DVDs and tried this one. It's fantastic. The workouts are manageable yet challenging and always make me feel stronger, more open, more flexible, and less sore and tight after I'm done. I always include the Pilates for Flexibility segment because that one manages to hit every spot where I'm hurting, bringing instant relief. I didn't start this DVD until about week 14 of my pregnancy when I finally started to feel better and am now in week 25. I honestly think I'd be looking flabbier and not feeling as good if I wasn't doing this DVD 1-2 times a week. Although the workouts are prenatal, they are still fairly challenging so I usually do 2-3 segments 2-3 times a week and try and get a few 20-minute walks in as well. I would also recommend this DVD to people who aren't pregnant who want to try Pilates. Even beginner Pilates exercises and beginner mat classes can be super challenging, so this would be a nice way to ease into things or build up some strength and flexibility before going to a class. I full intend to try the Body after Baby segment that is included on this DVD. I haven't watched it yet but it looks to concentrate on rebuilding the core muscles.",1336521600,,1573,4.446366782006921

I searched for some good DVDs that I could do at home since I would no longer be running and we don't have any good local prenatal exercise classes.  Luckily I found this gem.  Lizbeth Garcia was 36 weeks pregnant when she filmed this and it challenged me from the first trimester through the end (I am now almost 38 weeks along).  I must say that I credit this DVD for keeping me in good shape and even toning areas that were not toned prior to my pregnancy!  I have gained just over 20 lbs in the past 9 months and have not dieted or denied myself anything.  The DVD is not too hard, but leaves you feeling like you did something good for yourself, especially if you do the full 50 minute workout.  If you can't do the full 50 minutes, it is broken down into 10 minute segments and each one is good by itself.

With this video I could decide how long and intense I wanted my workout to be.  It might not be the best for those who were avid exercise champions prior to pregnancy, but as someone who worked out moderately 3-4 times a week I found it perfect.

Great for first trimester? I think some moves might not be safe for 2nd and 3rd trimesters ask your doctor.
Starts slow
Great stretching throughout workout
Not boring - ten min. is just enough
A beginner, like myself, can do 1-2 ten min. Workouts easily
Standing and floor work
Build your workout option (you can choose 1-5 of the workouts to play consecutively)
She's not annoying like many workout leaders

Cons
Needs a second person for modifying things - she's pretty hard core
Needs more ""how to do the first exercise""
Music is 'meh'
It maybe could be a tad bit harder",1333497600,,578,4.611650485436893

During my busy work week, sometimes I just do one workout (love that!).  Great for muscle tone and can be done all the way to 3rd trimester.  I was in pretty good shape prior to pregnancy and this DVD is just enough of a challenge.  Definitely recommended!!",1333065600,,410,4.486486486486487
2868263,5,B000RIWARG,"I have always been a fan of the 10 Minute Solution series. The Prenatal Pilates DVD is no exception in terms of quality and fun.

Most 10 Minute Solutions programs are divided into five 10 minute segments. You can put them easily into any order you prefer or just do as many or as few as you desire. There are many days where I am only good for about 20 minutes of exercise and I appreciate this function. As an added bonus, this one includes a freebie extra 10 minute postnatal workout devoted to flattening your abs. I can't wait to give it a try later.

Lizbeth Garcia is one of the most likeable dvd fitness instructors that I have encountered. She is pregnant in this video. She is very confident as she flows through each exercise and she is easy to keep up with. There is no pausing and rewinding as you try to master a move. I also enjoy the background music which ranges from fun to soothing without being distracting.

Some of my favorite things about the program: the focus on core strength, the standing pilates segment to help with the balance issues many of us expectant moms face, the incorporation of light hand weights, and the full segment to aid in flexibility. The full body pilates segment feels almost as challenging as a regular workout routine and I do it 5 days a week. I can see some of my major muscles are being kept toned by doing this simple workout when I quickly deconditioned during my first pregnancy...I wish I had this dvd then. The pilates for flexibility was something I wrote off as pointless stretching until a day came when I was tired and I saw how it eased a lot of my back and hip discomfort.

My only real criticism is that it can seem a little too easy in the early stages of pregnancy, but it has so many other perks that I will stick with it for the pure fun of doing it. In a couple of months when I am more cumbersome, I will think it plenty challenging!

Update 09/14/2012 I am 9 months pregnant now, and this dvd has kept me in much better shape than I was in my previous pregnancy. I have not packed on the upper arm fat or the extra padding on my buttocks and thighs. I have averaged four workouts a week and have slowly increased my hand weights to 8 pounds. My spouse keeps telling me that I look so much better during this pregnancy. As predicted, I find the workout plenty challenging now. It is a real workout to do these moves in the third trimester but the energy I feel after completing the workout is unbelievable.",1332720000,5,2477,4.318279569892473

I was having doubts if i should get this one or something else, but im glad that i chose this one.  The workout is not too hard and not too lite, its just well balanced to suit the condition of a pregnant woman.  Since i did Pilates before at home, i can tell that some workouts have been alternated to the needs of pregnant women, so they won't spend much time on their back, and not to overload the muscles in their bodies.
When i first started with this video, just looking at the instructor gave me motivation cause she is well in the 3rd semester and she is working out easily, without too much effort. All the sequences are lasting 10 minutes, which is perfect timing, and for those 10 minutes you get a good exercise who won't leave you breathless at the end of it. Its not meant to build up muscles, its just a workout to keep you physically in a good condition throughout the pregnancy, and thats why its so suitable and easy to do.
For those who haven't done pilates before, i think they should watch it once or twice before trying the workout, because they will understand how the breathing pattern goes and what is all included in the workout.

FYI (this video might not be good for people who have never done pilates or who are not in very good physical shape)but if you're up for the challenge i say GO FOR IT! I skip the first part (Standing Pilates) only because i have bad knees and there is a lot of bending and crunching going on but the other 4 parts offer a good enough workout for me. I love how energetic the instructor is and how upbeat the music is, it really keeps you motivated. Lizbeth moves at a pretty steady pace so it might seem a little overwhelming at first, i did a lot of rewinding in the beginning but the more i do it the better i have become at keeping up with her. If you don't have the time or energy to do all the workouts you can choose which ones you want to do and even mix them up if you get bored with the same routine. Before i became pregnant i was following Anna Caban's Intermediate pilates video (which there are some exercises on that video that i still feel comfortable doing and usually do those after 10 Minute Soultion). Anna is another one of my favorites and i will definitely be including her back into my workout routine after i've had my baby;o) Always listen to your body when doing any workout routine, take your time you can always hit rewind;o) God bless all you soon to be mommies, i hope this helps!",1330560000,,1448,4.212230215827338

I attend a local pilates class and the instructors there continuously modify all exercises lying on your back for me so I can avoid that position. Safety aside, I find it extremely uncomfortable to do the exercises on this DVD on my back so found myself modifying at home, not something I really want to do with a prenatal DVD. I've given the DVD a low rating of two stars simply because a truly excellent prenatal DVD should work for a pregnant woman from beginning to end, not need to be modified as I already have to do with regular exercise DVDs.

The video is broken into five 10-minute exercise segments.  When you're feeling under the weather, it's great to just do 10 minutes of exercise - so much better than doing nothing.  When you're feeling up for more, you can do two or three or all five exercise segments.

I was in reasonable shape before pregnancy, but lost a lot of fitness during the first trimester.  I feel like a get a decent workout doing 2 of the segments without being totally wiped out.  It's not easy or hard - I'd call it moderate.  Doing all 5 segments in a row is a tough workout.

2868302,5,B000RIWARG,"UPDATE:
Three months after having my LO I wanted to get back in shape. The first thing I tried was the extra add on to this DVD. It is led by a different woman, who does not look like a slim pack of muscles who doe not look like she ever has been pregnant. The postnatal workout would be challenging for me even in the pre-pregnancy days. Now they are next to impossible. I found it very frustrating and not helpful. After going over other DVDs that erred on the other side of being too easy, I decided to do regular pilates and try this DVD once I am more in shape. One good thing, though -- it doesnt require any special equipment (balls, bands etc) so you can do them in a whip -- an important thing to consider with a busy new-mom-schedule.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I used to practice pilates fairly regularly prior to my pregnancy, and was looking for a work out that would help me maintain fitness while being safe in my current condition. Many pregnancy work outs I have seen erred on the side of being way too easy even for someone without any work out history.

In this sense, this DVD is great. It offers a variety of exercises on different levels, so both fledglings and veterans can enjoy it. Moreover, as I progressed through the pregnancy I no longer could do certain exercises but could still benefit from others.
It is very important to stop BEFORE you get tiered, and to never exhaust yourself. So at some point I had to give up a lot of the exercises that require bringing your knees towards the belly or lying flat on the back. (A note on this issue -- ask your OB. Mine said that spending just a few minutes lying flat on the back will not be a problem, but you should stop if you feel any signs of dizziness, nausea or fatigue).

I liked the adaptation of many of my favorite pilates exercises, but I have to note that some of the exercises have very little t do with pilates. They are nice and probably do the job, but it is a misnomer.

My favorite sequence of pilates workout: Start with the first 3 minutes or so from the standing pilates for general stretching and warm up. Then skip the weights exercises and continue with pilates for flexibility. Then, alternate between days with either pilates for buns and core pilates (in both there would be some things I could not do past 6th month, so I only do about half the work out from these two series). This results in a very nice 20 min work out session, that makes me feel flexible and energetic for a good portion of the day. Although, as you can see, I do skip a lot, I think this is a very good value.",1314316800,,2575,4.2792607802874745
2868303,4,B000RIWARG,"This workout was pretty good.  I have never done pilates before, and this video was easy to follow and went at a good pace.  It was very low impact, and I didn't feel incredibly challenged.  However, it seems like a good workout for those days after work when you don't have a lot of energy left.  It covered the full body - legs, arms, core, butt, and stretching.  It's nice that it's broken up into 5, 10 minute segments so you can pick and choose what you want to do, or you can do them all.  It requires an exercise mat and 1-2lb dumbbells.",1313193600,,544,4.1826923076923075

You can def feel a burn and its a good burn and the total body is just that, she kits everything, especially arms.  each section is just long enough where you feel accomplished but not overdone in the end.

I do, however, recommend this video if you have trouble getting motivated to do more than 10 minutes of exercise a day.  This video allows you to pick and choose what segments to do in a given session, from just 10 minutes to 60.  This can be a bit weird, but I realized that I could push myself through my lethargy to all 60 minutes because of the way it's broken up.

This does require you to have weights available, which is a downside.  It's also not as calming as some other pilates workouts available.  I definitely felt it had a little more intensity than other prenatal workouts, so you must rely on your own ability to back-off if you're overexerting yourself.  This video felt very standard as fitness videos go, and is not my favorite, but like I said, has a place if you're just wanting to do something for 10 minutes, 20, or more.",1310169600,,1064,4.453608247422681
2868311,5,B000RIWARG,"I bought this after I had been using a prenatal yoga dvd for a little while. While the yoga was good for stretching and relaxation, this pilates workout was an actual workout! But it wasn't too exhausting or difficult - it was just perfect.
The fact that it's broken down into 5 different 10-minute segments is excellent. You can do as many as you want, or only do one of them.
The instructor is great - she is engaging and easy to follow. You don't have to be staring at the TV to understand what to do.",1308873600,,504,4.206185567010309
2868312,5,B000RIWARG,"This is a good workout that you will feel in a good way the next day. I like that all the exercises are only 10 minute long and that you can pick and choose which ones you want to do. Good breathing throughout the exercises, challenging moves,modified from easy to more advanced. The moves have been helpful releasing the pain in my lower back as my spine is adjusting during pregnancy. The instructor is pleasant and doesn't move too fast between the moves.",1308873600,,458,4.530120481927711
2868313,5,B000RIWARG,"This is my favorite prenatal exercise routine. It doesn't spend too long on any one movement so it's not too hard, but it still gives you a good workout. I love how it's broken up into 5 10 minute segments, you don't feel like you're spending such a long time doing it, not to mention having the breaks makes it easier to fit exercise in around my 3 year old. And it feels like the muscle toning and practice focusing on breathing will be helpful during labor (not to mention bouncing back after the baby). I'm definitely very happy with it!",1308787200,,541,4.366336633663367
2868314,5,B000RIWARG,"I found the ten minute format really helpful for tailoring the exercise to how much you could handle at any point in my pregnancy.  Some people warned me that I shouldn't attempt Pilates if I hadn't done it before pregnancy -- I did exercise, but not specifically Pilates -- but, honestly, I think some Pilates aficionados are just a little too into the mystique around the discipline.  Most of the exercises are moves you've done in other toning and body sculpting classes.  These routines may be too gentle for ladies coming from a higher level of fitness pre-pregnancy, at least up to the third trimester.",1308614400,,608,4.771428571428571

2868316,3,B000RIWARG,"I have two other prenatal workout DVD's that I purchased from Amazon and I must say that this one is my least favorite. The movements seem rushed and I don't like the transitions. With that, the routine isn't challenging enough for me and makes me feel a little disoriented with fast pace nature of it. Everyone seems to be on the same page about the abdominal portion of the DVD. I agree that I don't prefer to do those types of movements while pregnant. I do however like the flexibility routine. I do enjoy the pilate based stretching and movement. I joked with my girlfriend and said that as soon as I began the workout I could tell that the instructor was a freak and there's no doubt how she got pregnant... lol. Forgive my humor if this offends anyone.",1308009600,,759,4.428571428571429

The DVD feels a little weak.  When I first did this I felt like I was going through the motions without actually working my core.  I can't lie - doing roll ups with two pillows behind me has felt like a joke.

BUT I will admit that I think I'll be happier with this product as I progress through the pregnancy.",1307750400,,571,4.25
2868318,5,B000RIWARG,Ive been doing pilates for a year and needed a new video now that im pregnant. This is a very simple and successful workout. The pilates exercises are simple and didn't cause stress to my growing belly. Best of all its only 10 minute sessions. I would recommend this video to any pregnant women.,1307404800,,295,4.481481481481482

I was very bummed, so I turned to pilates (a very high recommendation from my physical therapist).  This was one of the only pilates DVDs I could find and it rocks.  Not only do you have the option of choosing the length of your workout (I've done everything from combining 30 min cardio with two of the 10 minute pilates workouts to just rolling through all 5 workouts as a whole workout in itself), but it keeps your heartrate up (not too high, though) and really works your muscles/core.  I actually plan on continuing to use it for the first couple of months after having the baby while my body readjusts...  HIGHLY recommended from a fitness enthusiast.",1306886400,,899,4.628930817610063

I feel like it really helped my core a ton and over all just helped me stay in shape. My belly was literally all baby..As soon as I delivered my stomach was pretty flat again. I can't help but think doing this twice a week is what helped me accomplish my stomach being baby only. I overall still have a little baby weight to lose but nothing like I expected. I also didn't get any stretch marks on my belly! I totally recommend this video for pregnant women.,1306368000,6,613,4.203389830508475

2868323,5,B000RIWARG,"I love the ""10 minute Solution"" series. I have the regular pilates DVD, and that is what got me to purchase this prenatal workout video when I was in the market for one. I like that on somedays I only have the energy or time to do(1) 10 minute segment, and on days that I have lots of energy I can create my own workout order. I hate do the same workout everyday. I know some other comments were about the fact that this wasn't a terribly challenging workout. I might not recommend it for advance pilates practitioners. I am a pretty fit woman, and before I got pregnant was mainly a runner - so I consider myself in good shape. I was able to enhance my workout through increasing the weight of my hand-weights, and taking on the challenges that the instructor suggests in the video. Also, as I learned the routine better,I was able to focus much more on my breathing and tightening my muscles and my core - this definitely enhanced my workout. Also, any concerns about being on your back...I echo the other comments, it is for such a short time it should not be cause for worry. But if you are concerned - do check with your Doctor.",1304553600,,1133,4.323943661971831
2868324,4,B000RIWARG,"This is a fun and energizing video, great to do in pieces or as a whole. The only disadvantage is that there is a portion done lying on your back. I know it's probably okay, but to be cautious, I don't do it. however, it's not much of a problem - I can fast-forward through it quite easily and it's a relatively small portion of the video. Would give 4.5 stars if I could.",1304035200,,372,4.04054054054054

2868326,5,B000RIWARG,"I purchased this workout during my second trimester and love it.  It's a total body workout but gives you the flexibility to divide the workout into 10 minute workouts.

The segments are well instructed, easy to follow, and effective.  Best of all, I can fit exercise in anytime I have an extra 10+ minutes.  This has been critical with my busy schedule and varying energy levels.

10 Minute Solutions also makes great non-pregnancy workout DVDs.",1302480000,,446,4.8933333333333335
2868327,3,B000RIWARG,"I really enjoy this workout and used it quite regularly through most of my pregnancy. The thing I LOVE about it is the option to customize the order/number of segments.  This was really helpful on days I was feeling tired... I could tell myself ""I'll just do 10 minutes today"", so the thought of working out wasn't overwhelming.

One area of concern however involves the Core segment.  Unless you already have extremely fit abs, I think this section can cause more harm than good.  In the latter half of pregnancy, you are more prone to abdominal separation (aka diastasis recti), and the exercises in this segment--especially the crunches--can bring on this condition.  I was doing the core workout faithfully until around 25 weeks when I noticed a freakish-looking vertical ""ridge"" extending down the length of my midsection every time I crunched. (Very disturbing!)  It was simply too much strain on the rectus abdominus muscles and they were beginning to separate as a result.

This is still a great workout dvd, but I do NOT recommend the core segment after 20 weeks.  Do standing ab crunches instead, and always keep the belly button pulled in tight during any exercise that utilizes the abs.  I had to learn this lesson the hard way!",1302048000,16,1240,4.838862559241706

Now, at 24 weeks, I have a lot of pelvic and posterior pelvic pain.  A friend lent me this DVD and it does a great job at stretching out those muscles.  My hips crack and pop a bit, but I feel so much better afterwards.  I can actually bend over to pick the newspaper up off the driveway.  I actually went ahead and bought my own copy because I use it all the time.",1301443200,,530,4.106796116504855

I do not participate in pilates classes, but this is great for even a beginner(I do however exercise 4-5 times a week). If I get home late from work or don't have the energy for the whole tape, I love picking 2-3 segments to at least fit in a good workout. The thigh/leg workout has actually made me sore and the other exercises are great too. I'm at 4 months - and I'm sure this will continue to be challenging through the pregnancy. There's also some great stretching/relaxing and I always feel great after doing this video. NOthing spectacular about set or music but I don't pay much attention to that stuff anyway. I'd consider this a must-buy, and I'm sure I will use it throughout my pregnancy.",1301184000,,829,4.42483660130719

Anyway, I am loving it. I'm not new to pilates, but this seems like a decent dvd with some good workouts on it. I absolutely love the flexibility workout section. I plan to do this all the way up until I deliver (as long as I have no issues.) I'd recommend it.

Only issue I'd like to mention is she really goes through things fast, but I think that has to do with the 10 minute time limit on each workout - so probably not her fault.

I am a very active person and wanted to have a workout at home that was practical for my small apartment and time outside of work. It was so easy to work out because the segments are 10-minutes each. So on a day where I was feeling tired or more pregnant than usual I would tell myself to do just one segment but always ended up doing at least three. And in pregnancy I actually changed my body thanks to this DVD and Pilates. My muscles got leaner and I was in the best shape of my life. Now I do Pilates at the gym and running. Also, the stretches were amazing. I had a very fast and easy delivery (easy, nothing is easy in birth, but as close to easy as you get), and I truly believe part of that was due to the stretches, breathing and positive message about your baby in this vide. I also really like Lizbeth, who I did not find annoying like I do with other DVDs and trainers. I am really not someone who writes reviews, but I just loved this so much I felt truly compelled to do so.

I like how it is divided into 10 minute workouts that you can combine into longer workouts as you wish. The woman doing the workouts is very easy to follow. With pregnancy irritability it was important to me to not have an annoying trainer on the DVD. She is great and the DVD is a must have during pregnancy.,1298937600,,434,4.240963855421687

I usually use this DVD in conjuction with another one (Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout); I do the Sanders' workout first and then choose a couple of 10-minute sections off of this DVD.

I only have 5 lbs weights and they recommend 1-3 lb weights, so my arms feel like they are going to fall off by the end! :) But I love how it is no nonsense and you just get to the point and don't have any lag time. it's great for full time mommy's who don't have a lot of time!",1297123200,,587,3.704

2868342,5,B000RIWARG,"Overall, this is a great prenatal pilates DVD for all 3 trimesters (and beyond).  It is broken into 6 10-minute routines, each with a different focus (standing, core, buns & thighs, total body, flexibility, and bonus post-natal).  The DVD lets you create your own playlist of workouts, so you can truly customize each session based on what you want, need, or just enjoy doing!  I aim for 2-3 routines per day, and I switch them up daily.

You need a workout mat, light weights(I use 2 lbs), and pillows (she asks for king-sized, but I use standard).

It's not a slow workout - you make the most of the 10 minutes - but I find her directions to be clear enough to not miss a beat.

I haven't used any other prenatal pilates DVDs, and I don't think I will!

2868344,5,B000RIWARG,"I love this DVD!  This the first 10 Minute Solutions workout I've tried and I absolutely love the format.  Because the workouts are broken up into 5 10 minute segments, they seem to go by very quickly.  When I'm working out with a DVD I usually get bored and start looking at the clock after 20 minutes.  With this one, I can do several of the segments together and it seems to go by really quickly.  I love how flexible it is as well.  You can do as many or as few as you have time (or energy) to do.  Today I had a little spare time so I just quickly did two segments.  The instructor is really good too, she's sweet and not annoying at all.  Plus she looks amazing with her big bump.  She flows into each exercise very quickly so there's no time for that annoying banter that you hear on some DVDs.  I'm nearing the end of my first trimester and I can see myself doing these exercises all throughout my pregnancy.  I've typically favored yoga over pilates but I just really love the format of these exercises.

2868345,5,B000RIWARG,"Sooo, I'm not much for working out but when I started gaining weight after i got pregnant, I decided I didn't want the weight to stick afterwards, and the easiest way to do that is to be in the best shape possible during the pregnancy so it's easier to bounce back afterwards. Plus, I wasn't as flexible as I was before and that bothered me. I loved the fact that the video comes with 5 exercises that are only 10 minutes long each so it feels like it goes by quick. The workouts aren't too strenuous either and REALLY helped with my flexibility. I don't think it helped much with my back pain though. My absolute favorite part about it was that you can mix and match the workouts so you can do as many or as few as you want in any order. That was awesome, and I've never seen it before. the ONLY downside was that one of the workouts requires little dumbbells which I don't have and don't intend on buying. Overall the video is more than worth it and i bought it 'used', there are lots that are cheaper and are still sealed :)",1296172800,,1027,4.191919191919192
2868346,4,B000RIWARG,"I bought this workout in my first trimester when I was too tired to continue my regular workout but still wanted a way to tone and stay fit at home.  This will not get your heart racing, so I would suggest mixing it with a cardio workout, but it is a great way to stay toned in little amounts of time and space.

I like to create my own workout by mixing two-four of the workouts - the DVD allows you to do this.  I really enjoy the Standing Pilates workout.  The Total Body is good, but there is a move at the beginning that always makes my knees pop - my pilates instructor told me to put a bolster or pillow behind my knees as I lean back and that seemed to help.

I usually use this workout for 20 minutes then walk on the treadmill at another part of the day for 20 minutes.  My muscles are still toned and the only place I am ""showing"" at 26 weeks is my tight belly.  However, I do mix it with cardio and I take a pilates class with a very good instructor who does an excellent job of modifying for pregnancy twice a week.

This is good for at home use and when you need a quick spurt of energy or it is too late in the day to rev up your heart and you want some stretching.  I do think it also aids my digestion and helps me sleep!  Always a plus!",1296000000,,1254,3.9015748031496065

2868348,4,B000RIWARG,"I really enjoyed doing this pilates DVD during my 1st pregnancy.  However, I did not give it five stars because of the Flat Belly Fast feature at the end.  I started doing it 7 weeks after I delivered my son because my Dr. said I could.  Well the lady who does the Flat Belly Fast bonus feature is not the same lady who does the Prenatal Pilates through out the rest of the DVD.  I'm pretty sure she was never even pregant in her life!  It is extremely hard (in my opinion)and I ended up finding out I had a hernia after doing it.  I'm not sure if I already had the hernia or if I got it doing the DVD.

It's not super challenging, but if you do all 5 10-min segments I bet it would be. I'm 13weeks pregnant and wanted to get into a good workout routine now so that it would be easier when I am further along. I will for sure do this dvd for the rest of my pregnancy. I love that you can customize your workout so you can choose which of the workouts you want to do and in what order. Some days I only do the flexibility one(it feels so good) and other days I do more. I also love that she is 36 weeks pregnant. She's really easy to listen to and I feel like if she can do it then I can too haha, so it pushes you! Before being pregnant I only worked out moderately and not regularly, so if you're like me, you'll love this. You feel so good afterwards without feeling like you over did it.

This DVD in combination with some cardio had me in great shape and helped me have an all-natural delivery.
I'm not a doctor, but in my opinion, if you're worried about laying on your back, don't be. It's only a short time that you're on your back, and if you start to feel uncomfortable, listen to your body and skip that segment.",1295395200,,539,4.242718446601942

Having done 2 out of 5 workouts on this DVD in one evening, I have to admit that it was more of a workout than I expected and for that I like the DVD.  While you won't necessarily huff and puff as if you were doing cardio, your muscles will get a workout. In case it's not clear, it's pretty easy to do just one 10 min exercise of your choosing (each one targets different muscles) or do them all.  The only thing I did miss is that you should invest in a couple of low weight dumbbells.  You can do the motions without them to start and then you'll want to increase the resistance.",1295222400,,834,4.0920245398773005
2868353,4,B000RIWARG,I purchased several prenatal dvd's because I wanted a combination of easy workouts for the days I felt exhausted and some challenging ones for days I had a boost of energy. This dvd offers it all in my opinion.  You can do the full @40 min workout or you can do only 10 minutes of the area you choose.  My legs were definitely burning when doing the video and I definitely think it's a good workout!,1295222400,,399,4.2368421052631575
2868354,4,B000RIWARG,This is a great workout video for pregnancy. I've been looking for something that is a workout but safe for baby during the winter months since it's hard to get out and walk in the cold weather. This is very good because you can pick and choose how many 10 min workouts you want to do each time.  The only bad part is for the core workout and segments of other workouts she lies flat on her back. I've been told not to lay flat on your back white pregnant b/c a large vein runs back there that the weight of your belly can impact causing reduced oxygen.  I skipped those parts and still greatly enjoyed the workout. It'll keep me toned and ready to get back in shape after the baby comes.,1294963200,,688,4.165413533834586
2868355,5,B000RIWARG,"I was in pretty good shape before the pregnancy, however I have let myself go some.  I wanted something that could help get me on the right track again, because well I'm starting to gain a lot of weight back.  I've been eating better, but needed help with workouts.  I am now about 26 weeks along with only 14 to go.  I found this video and decided to give it a try.  I have NEVER done pilates, but this video made it so easy.  I was able to flow right into position.  Some of the workouts can be a little challenging, but if it were easy everyone would be in shape.  You just have to do what you can then ease into it.  I would highly recommend this for a beginner especially and love how easy it is for myself.  I will continue this video even after the pregnancy.",1294876800,,766,4.080536912751678

It looked great for maybe the first trimester, but I bought it in the third and it was just not right for me. I preferred the Wii Fit hula hoops to keep me active.",1294617600,,321,3.735294117647059
2868357,5,B000RIWARG,"I have always had a hard time picking out workout tapes & doing so pregnant was no exception.  I previously purchased the Pregnancy Workout Volume I and Prenatal Yoga tape-both of which I did not like.  The Pregnancy workout Volume I was insanely hard, especially for me to pick up since the first 3 months of pregnancy I was sick EVERY DAY & was out of shape... the Prenatal Yoga tape was boring and the instructor annoyed me.

With the 10 minute solution prenatal pilates tape none of those things were issues.  I literally JUST finished my workout and had to come on here to do my review.  I put this tape on because my lower back was bothering me and I figured doing the 10 minute standing pilates section would be a nice stretch. I wound up doing all 5 segments instead.  This workout provides nice stretches and good workout techniques for pregnancy.  I felt the workout but I don't feel like I never want to do that again because I am too beat up from it.  It has a nice balance of exertion without being too strenuous.  My favorite segment is the total body pilates and the standing pilates.  The flexibility one didn't seem as challenging as I would have liked, but overall still a decent workout.  The core pilates is mostly done on your back HOWEVER if you use the pillows properly for support as shown in the video it minimizes any impact on the lower back and makes the exercises adaptable for pregnancy.  Going into this video I had some issues with my lower back and was to the point where I couldn't even lie flat on my lower back without experiencing pain.... some of the exercises on here you do do flat on your lower back.  Please bear in mind that this is not the ""optimal"" position for pregnancy but the time spent here is minimal, at  best, and you are constantly moving.  Also, I would recommend trying it.  I made sure to try to do at least 2 reps of any flat back exercises through my slight discomfort and I can honestly say that just from this one time through my back feels better now than it did before.  I am eager to see how much I can increase my reps and work out the kinks - literally- in my lower back.

I would highly recommend this workout. It is good to be able to break down the sessions into quick 10 minutes spurts but you can also work through them one by one or customize your workout each day.  The workout is efficient without being too overly taxing on the body.  You can tell that the standard pilates positions and workouts were modified for pregnancy with serious thought.  Also, the instructor is not overly perky or obnoxious like is the usual case with these videos. She is pleasant and almost fades into the background as a guiding voice.  One small addition is that she does move fairly quickly through the workouts and at one point on the buns and thighs session I got slightly annoyed because I couldn't switch sides as quickly as she did. But, overall that is minimal compared to the pro's in the video.

** For this video you will need a set of 1-3lb dumbells and 1 or 2 king sized pillows, a yoga mat is also recommended.  This isn't indicated on the case of the DVD itself, but you will use them and they are beneficial to the workout.",1294531200,,3195,4.367174280879865

I find that the cueing is easy to follow and I never have trouble keeping up with Lizbeth's pace. I also like her teaching style. This workout is probably not hard enough for a really advanced exerciser, but that's precisely why I like it. Overall, I highly recommend this dvd.",1289260800,,555,4.398058252427185

2868367,4,B000RIWARG,"I got this dvd early in my pregnancy (6 weeks) because I had planned to exercise throughout my trimesters. I discovered I was way to nauseated and fatigued to even bother exercising in my first trimester! Now I'm in my second and feeling better so I decided to give this dvd a try because after all it's only 10 minutes of exercise.

What I like about this dvd: easy to follow, simple moves.
  simple equipment required (small handweights, king size pillows and floor mat).
  good instructor who is not overly perky.
  nice,unobtrusive music.
  good lighting/set (if you care about aesthetics).
  five diff. 10 min. programs offered so you can concentrate on areas you want to work.
  there is also an option button on dvd to personalize your own workout. You can combine 2 programs for a 20 min. workout( what I'm doing) or utilize them all for 50 minutes.
  post-natal (flat belly fast) section included.

*The only thing I have difficulty with is the proper inhalation/exhalation on the exercises...but i think maybe that'll come with time and practice. Also, I'm not so flexible yet so it takes me a few minutes to switch from side to side(in which case I pause the dvd).

2868369,5,B000RIWARG,I was a fairly active person before I got pregnant but my 1st Trimester wiped me out. I bought this and didn't start until my 2nd. I have been loving it. You can customize your own workout with as many or as few workouts as you have time for. I worked up a sweat in just 10 minutes but never felt like I was over-exerting myself. I would recommend this to all women at any point in pregnancy. You can go slow and only do 1 workout a day and still feel good. I have not done any of the ab work because I'm nervous and hear so many opposing views on doing abdominal work while pregnant. The rest of the DVD is great!,1284249600,,614,3.9596774193548385
2868370,4,B000RIWARG,"I'm currently 5 months pregnant and have been using this DVD for about 2 months now.  I do like the 10 minute segments because it allows you to customize your workout depending on how much time you have that day.  Initially, I thought a prenatal pilates DVD wouldn't be much of a workout.  However, it is actually a decent workout and is a good thing to pair with cardio.  If you were a hardcore Pilates or Yoga fanatic before, this might be a breeze for you.

There are a couple of small reasons I didn't give it 5 stars.  Firstly, the instructor moves rather quickly from one move or position to another.  Once you get the hang of it, you'll have your pillows and weights ready.  Having done Pilates before I got pregnant, I do know that having proper form is important, which the instructor doesn't overly stress. I suppose that's okay given the nature and limited time for each segment.  My second reason for not giving it 5 stars is because there is little time for stretching.  I've always understood throughout my time playing sports growing up as well as taking several gym classes that you should hold a stretch for at least 10-15 seconds.  I know this is really minor, but if you don't make it to the fourth or fifth 10 minute segment on flexibility, you don't really get a good stretch at all.",1284076800,,1304,4.459915611814346

Ten minutes are also short enough that I feel like I can't talk myself out of exercising - I can spare at least ten minutes a day - so I've actually been sticking with it and being consistent. The workouts are fun and I can feel them working (without putting too much stress on my baby-growing-body!) I also love that there are five different workouts so it doesn't get too monotonous.

2868372,3,B000RIWARG,"I wish I had read the reviews on here before purchasing this video because it is far too easy for me.  I am not an avid exerciser but I had been exercising at least three times per week for five months prior to becoming pregnant, and now I'm at the beginning of my second trimester.  The ab section just made me feel uncomfortable.  The standing part consisted mostly of easy squats and pelvic tucks.  The buns and thighs part for me was a joke having been able to do The Original Buns of Steel video without flinching.  The only part that I did like was the flexibility section, but the instructor did mostly side stretches, and did not do a neck stretch at all.  This would probably be a great workout for someone who hadn't exercised before pregnancy.  But I think I will probably let this collect dust, and maybe try it one more time once I'm in the middle of my third trimester.",1282694400,,883,4.347560975609756

2868374,4,B000RIWARG,"I have always been a big fan of the 10 Minute Solutions series. They are quick, versatile, and give you a lot of good ideas of exercises to try out on your own. Everyone has time for 10 minutes, even if you can't string all the segments together for a 50 minute work out. I really felt my muscles working, without feeling like the movements were strenuous or unsafe for the baby. It is true (as other reviewers have mentioned) that she lies flat on her back, but it is NOT for very long, and she herself is clearly 8 or so months pregnant, and so it doesn't seem like a big deal. I mean, when you wake up in the middle of the night and realize you've rolled onto your back, do you freak out and panic? No, you just roll back onto your side. I didn't feel like I was flat on my back for nearly long enough to disrupt blood flow through the Vena Cava.

The fun thing about 10 Minute Solutions is that it takes longer to become bored of the routine. I like to switch up the order of segments, and have managed to stay engaged in the DVD for a couple of months now (along w/ a few other videos as well -- like Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout).",1281052800,4,1139,4.084821428571429

2868377,4,B000RIWARG,"I purchased this DVD because pilates classes in my area are $15-20 each and I have limited time for visiting the prenatal ones. At about $13, the dvd is definitely worth the price. I have never done pilates (just Ashtanga and Hatha Yoga), but I'd now like to start pilates classes after my pregnancy.

PROS
My favorite aspect of the video is that you have 5 segments of 10 minutes each, so can customize the workout. I did all of them and they flow well together. I'm in decent shape, but I need more toning in the legs, so will probably focus on that segment as much as possible, combining with other videos. Each of us have our target areas, so 10 minutes is a great way to start getting those areas in better shape.

CONS
I didn't think the flexibility section was helpful, but this may be due to my Yoga practice. I liked the leg circles and some of the exercises, but 10 minutes seemed a little short. Flexibility is pretty important to having a healthy birth, so I'd recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Prenatal-Postnatal-Yoga/dp/B002EWD0BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga</a>, which isn't too hard and should help a mommy-to-be have longer, leaner muscles.",1280620800,,1250,5.183168316831683

Following a video everyday is not for me, but I can easily remember the moves and incorporate/supplement them in my workouts at the gym.

i find the instructor pleasant and relatively easy to follow. i like the movements and feel like they are beneficial for both keeping my muscles toned and lengthened, as well as helpful as a preparation for delivery. and i particularly like the work my abs get without being too strenuous (but always listen to your body and modify when needed). during the flexibility section, there is a very small amount of time spent on the back, but you are constantly rolling or moving and therefore not resting long enough to be harmful for the vena cava. but if you are concerned, you can always use a pillow.",1278720000,,889,4.420731707317073

2868384,3,B000RIWARG,"When I got this dvd, I was just starting my second trimester.  I really liked it then, because I had been a little lethargic in my first trimester and it helped me get back into exercising without being too tough.  Now that I am in my 7th month, I think it is a little too easy if you just do a couple of the 10 minute sections, and a little long if you do all 5.

The dvd is broken up into 5 sections, which is great for focusing your workout when time is short.  In the beginning they were all great, but after doing the dvd for a couple of months I didn't find it challenging anymore.  Also, I don't care much for the Core Pilates section.  I did regular Pilates before my pregnancy, and it just doesn't compare.  I know it is supposed to be easier and lighter for a pregnant belly, which it makes sense for the 3rd trimester, but in the first 2 trimesters your belly is not necessarily that big, and it would be good to have the option of doing more.

Overall it is a good dvd, in spite of the criticisms listed above.  The instructor, Lizbeth Garcia, is energetic without being annoying, and the music and background are nice and not at all distracting.

The 5 workouts push enough without feeling like I am doing too much. They are great when I don't have a lot of energy or time.

This video is fast-paced and exactly what I was looking for! It's easy to mix and match, I love that format and the intervals go by so quickly its hard to believe it was 10 minutes!

(It was only thirty, but the Freshmen 15 is a determined threat no matter what age you start college lol.) When I realized I was pregnant, I was determined NOT to gain an ungodly amount of weight this time around. 15lbs is my goal and I'm happy to report that as I approach my 23rd week I've only gained 8 lbs. This of course is due in part to pregnancy metabolism, 2 mile walks and now Prenatal Pilates. I've never been real big on the twist, stretch, raise and hold type workouts, (AKA anything Yoga and Pilates related) but the 10 Minute Solution reviews were impossible to ignore. Almost every one I read included something like, 'I felt great after this work out' and 'The instructions were fast paced and easy to follow.' This is especially important to someone like me. I'm not gonna lie I went into this DVD expecting to hate it as I hated all things bendy, but man was I wrong! I'm sitting in my living room, computer on lap, writing this review after my very first, very awesome 10 minute workout. I feel absolutely revitalized not to mention accomplished. My muscles are pulsing and a smidge sore, but nothing outrageous. The overhaul of exhaustion that normally hits after starting a new regimen has been replaced with a shocking amount of energy. At the menu page I chose the Total Body workout and let me tell you even if the rest of the DVD sucks this one routine made it well worth buying. You're going from the second it comes on. The fast pace and easy instructions work you without working you into the ground. I've never had this much fun exercising. Ever. I've looked high and low for something that would make me feel the way I feel today. I've ordered other Prenatal DVD's and researched until I'm blue in the face, but that's all over now. Take it from a pregnant, overweight Pilates hater like me; the 10 minute solution is exactly that; the solution. Good luck to you all, and have a happy, healthy pregnancy.",1273968000,22,2066,4.526737967914438
2868390,5,B000RIWARG,"I love this DVD! I do about 3-10 minute segments every day and I feel great! I would totally agree with the review that says you spend more time on your back at some ultrasounds. In addition, because you are exercising while lying down, my guess is this would improve your circulation if that is the concern especially when you stay conscious of your breathing. My husband is a physical therapist and he did not have any objections to it.

I love that you can build your own workout and do whatever combination you want in any order. It's so easy and convenient to just pop it in when you have the time, I'm much more motivated to work out because of the ease of the whole thing! I also do this with my friend who is not pregnant and she gets a great workout too so I'm looking forward to continuing to use it after I give birth!",1272931200,,829,4.213836477987422
2868391,5,B000RIWARG,"I enjoyed this video. I am 15 weeks along with my third child. I worked out regularly before pregnancy and I wanted to continue working out, but safely. I think the workouts in this video are really good and effective. I wish they were longer than ten munites, but at the same time I do like that you can pick and choose the workouts you want, so if you are in a hurry, you can still fit in exercise.",1271203200,,400,4.075949367088608
2868392,4,B000RIWARG,"This video is not super tough, but good for those days you are just too tired to do something very rigorous. Don't love the Core/Ab section...but the other ones are great!",1271203200,,171,4.548387096774194
2868393,5,B000RIWARG,"I am admittedly out of shape and I suffered a pulled thigh muscle in my first trimester. But with the ok from my Dr. I decided to start exercising again (after several years off) but I had a bit a trepidation. However this particular DVD got rave reviews from a friend who has tried MANY prenatal and regular videos to find the perfect one, so I gave it a shot.

I am blow away with how I feel!! I have a weak lower back to start with & my knees tend to hurt while I exercise but I have NO PAIN at all while doing this DVD and following her clear directions - and I feel great afterwards! I find it moves at a quick but nice pace leaving very little downtime which is fine by me because I have two other young children to care for. And a cute side benefit is that they sit next to me (5 & 6) and watch me and do some of it themselves and coach me along. :)

I like VERY MUCH how the DVD is divided into 5 parts so I can do all 5 a few times a week and then just 1 or 2 the other days when I am pressed for time. And all I have to do is wake up just a few minutes earlier to fit in a routine before running off to school/work. That feels good even if it really is only 10 minutes. Better than nothing!

Her voice is pleasant and her directions clear. The moves are not hard or strenuous and again I feel no pain in my back or knees. And I really feel it afterwards - in a good sort of tight/fit way, not a sore and painful way.

The perfect pregnancy and postnatal workout in my opinion. I am can see myself using it for a while after the baby comes as it's just a good quick workout.",1270512000,2,1583,3.817073170731707
2868394,5,B000RIWARG,I am 3 1/2 months pregnant and the streches in this video have been great to help ease my lower back and abdominal pain due to the baby growing. The exercises are a good workout and really support your needs as a pregnant woman. I love that they are only 10 min. workouts so even when Im busy I can just get somekind of exercise in.  Definately buy this its worth your time and money!!!,1270252800,,386,4.1466666666666665
2868395,5,B000RIWARG,I love this DVD.  I do 2-10 minute segments every morning. Since each segment is only 10 minutes it is really easy to fit a few into your day!!!!,1269820800,,145,4.0
2868396,5,B000RIWARG,This video was perfect for a very busy working preggie lady. The exercises were short in length and provided great strengthening and stretching necessary for childbirth. I started these videos around my 4 month of pregnancy when my energy levels were back wish i had done it from the beginning. She is calm and uses a gentle tone when speaking is also looks amazing for being sooo pregnant! i recommend this video,1269388800,,413,4.75
2868397,5,B000RIWARG,"I am a massage therapist specializing in pregnancy massage.  I also am pregnant with my first child and I wanted a workout video that I could do daily.  The modifications that she teaches makes this video usable right up until you are term.  This video is safe and effective at giving you a total body workout.  I also have runner's knee, so standing squats and other exercises like that are not recommended for me to do.  This video is nice because there are 5 sections, and only the first section has the standing/squats workout, so I can use the other 4 sections and still get a great workout.  She has a nice voice and the video production is of high quality.  I will recommend this video to all of my pregnant clients.",1269216000,,723,4.431818181818182

Each one is perfect for what it says it is going to be working and even though it's only 10 minutes, you still feel like you actually get a workout. I also like that I can customize the workouts so I can do exactly what I want for the amount of time I have. It's true that there are some exercises where you are on your back, but you aren't there for very long and you certainly aren't just lying still. All in all, I would recommend this product for any pregnant woman I know who wants to stay fit during her pregnancy.",1268611200,,643,3.992248062015504

The DVD will just put them together for you. The only equipment you need is light handweights, a mat, and a couple of pillows. It has made it much easier to exercise when I can't find time for the gym.",1268352000,,369,4.138888888888889
2868401,4,B000RIWARG,"I have been doing the Ana Caban, Total Toning Workout, the pilates standing section ONLY, and I am very happy with it. So I tried out a few prenatal pilates DVD's. Making a good pilates pregnancy workout is difficult because a lot of pilates exercises are very core challenging, are done on a flat back, and include fast paced breathing, all of which is great if you aren't pregnant or in your first trimester. Most of the videos I tried were either entirely unsafe or not even worth taking the time to do because they were so easy. This video is Ok, I am in the second trimester and did the whole video straight through, It was an OK workout. The Buns & Thighs, Standing, and Flexibility sections are 5 star short workouts, the other three are 3 to 4 star workouts.

My concern is only in one of the six workouts on the video. The core pilates. 100% safe for your first trimester. However, in your second trimester you must modify the exercises and splint your abs on half the exercises. As seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gabrielle-Reece-The-Complete-Fit-and-Healthy-Pregnancy/dp/B001AYWY72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gabrielle Reece: The Complete Fit and Healthy Pregnancy</a>. If you don't your abs will begin to split apart. This was never addressed in this video.  Also in your third trimester I would recommend omitting any of the exercises that feel uncomfortable, or cause dizziness. Some people where concerned about lying on your back to do these exercises, as long as you feel good doing them you should be OK. In the Core section she has you doing the exercises supported by pillows so you will not be on a flat back, and it is only about 5 minutes. Though out the video their is a minimum of flat back work.

If you want to try a Pilates wourkout video I would strongly give 5 stars check out, Jillian Moriarty's Prenatal Fitness (Pre/Postnatal Yoga & Pilates Workouts), by Parents, you can find it at Target. Also&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suzanne-Bowen-s-Long-and-Lean-Prenatal-Workout/dp/B001TC8PNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suzanne Bowen's Long and Lean Prenatal Workout</a>&nbsp;Is a great 5 stars all Pilates workout video.

2868402,5,B000RIWARG,I normally can't stand exercise dvds.... this one is so interesting and the 10 minutes segments make it so interesting. Love it... and you definitely feel it.. great workout!,1267401600,,174,5.0344827586206895
2868403,5,B000RIWARG,"I have enjoyed this DVD, and use it more than any other (I have 4 pregnancy-specific workout DVDs) precisely because it is broken into 10 minute segments. Sometimes, at the end of a long day, or when I have an extra few minutes in the morning, a 10 minute workout is perfect. Other times, I do a workout two or three times, or pause it to do a particular move more than the DVD does, or do the whole DVD- start to finish. I can adjust this workout to the days I have no energy and the days I am bursting with it. I highly recommend it as a beginning workout, or a supplement to your existing one. If you are in relatively good shape it will not be a challenging workout, though it still feels effective. Also, some of the stretches have been very useful for relieving the back pain I have had recently. All around, I recommend the DVD- I've given it to each of my pregnant friends.",1267401600,,881,4.188235294117647
2868404,4,B000RIWARG,"This is a solid workout video with pretty creative adaptations from traditional pilates.  It has 5-10 minute pilates sections which you can do straight through, 1 at a time, or in any combination / order that you please (you can preset a customized workout at the start - cool!), which is great for the days that I am trying to squeeze in a workout.

I go back and forth between feeling like this video is too easy and feeling challenged by it... overall, I use this video on as an ""easier"" workout day when I need a little strength training and a little flexibility.  One thing I like about this video is that there is virtually no down time, and you don't have to do any exercise for very long - which means that if you think a movement is really challenging or really easy, you move on from it pretty quickly.  I definitely break a sweat during this video, which always surprises me... maybe it's just sneakily difficult.

As to the concern about laying on your back... I believe this is something that you are advised against doing for longer than a few minutes at a time during your second and third trimesters, but it shouldn't be a concern for most because you are only on your back for a couple of minutes during a couple of sections.  Don't freak out too much about that, or just avoid the segments where you lay on your back.  You probably spend more time on your back when you roll over during your sleep, honestly.

I found the instructor to be pleasant.  Overall, I would recommend this video.",1267315200,3,1506,4.427536231884058
2868405,3,B000RIWARG,"I purchased this workout to replace Winsor pilates that I usually workout with.  The way the video is arranged is convenient as you can select one 10 minute workout or add others and it will play the onces chosen.  The workouts, however, are not very challenging.  I am 14weeks and did the elliptical machine prior to this workout and did not feel very ""worked out."" Also the total body workout is an arm workout with weights.  I am not sure why it is called total body?  There is one move where she says, ""This will work your whole body"", maybe that's why?  This might be better for a novice or later in pregnancy, but for now I have to do something else to feel like I am getting a workout.",1267228800,,692,4.2846153846153845
2868406,4,B000RIWARG,The instructor is very clear and easy to follow.  The exercises are perfect for a mom-to-be.  I loved the modified positions that still engage your core.,1267056000,,153,4.846153846153846
2868407,4,B000RIWARG,"I have another Pilates DVD by Lizbeth Garcia, Pilates on the Ball. I didn't use it as often as I should as I always knew it would make me sore the next for days. I loved it though. When I saw she had a Prenatal workout and that it was in the 10 Minute Solution series I knew this was the one for me.

I alternate this video w/ the You: Having a Baby Workout (DVD): The Owner's Manual to a Happy and Healthy Pregnancy, which is about 30 minutes, but more on weights and squatts. Together I love the two of them.

This one is great because I can break it down into how much time I have and then normally I go back after work if I don't run that day (yes I'm still running) and finish up what I didn't have time for.

The different segments are quick and yet can be adjusted to be as challenging as you need. I find the 3lbs weights to be a little light for me, so I alternate certain workouts when necesarry to 5 lbs. The 10 min Flexibility is great, as I do have somoe lower back pain now. I will sometimes pop that one in before bed just to help stretch everything out. Ever section is a winner for its own topic.",1266969600,,1113,3.9598214285714284
2868408,5,B000RIWARG,"I love this dvd, the teacher is lively, the music is nice and the exercies are efficient and fun. I also purchased the Stott pilates prenatal and I don't like it.

2868409,5,B000RIWARG,This is a great DVD for prenatal pilates. I like how there are different 10-minute segments you can choose from that target different areas. I like to do two a day.  The instructor is more upbeat than some and she keeps your attention. The 10 minutes go by so fast and you get a really great workout. I am a Stott Pilates follower and this DVD is the most similar to that style I have seen. I would recommend this DVD.,1266537600,,418,4.160493827160494
2868410,3,B000RIWARG,"I am 4 month pregnant and I purchased this video for its medium difficulty and the 10 minute convenience. I have not exercised much at all before I got pregnant or in my first trimester, but decided it was time for me to start.  I like the fact that I can exercise just 10 minutes at a time, but ususally go through more sections. I love that some weights are being used while the exercises concentrate on all body stretching and strenghtening. The trainer is very pleasant and encouraging. The reason I did not rank the DVD higher is that there is very little explanation of the positions she is taking and the pace is quite fast. There is also very little breathing guidance or over all pilates principles explanation. It is good to have at least a very basic knowledge of the pilates principles before going through the exercises (for example Pilates Beginning Mat Workout with Ana Caban). Not negating the above, the fact that there are no breaks for exercise explanation makes the routine interesting over and over again - it prevents it from getting boring once you get familiar with the exercises. Over all, I recommend this DVD.",1266278400,9,1136,4.651741293532338
2868411,4,B000RIWARG,"This is an excellent pilates prenatal workout, especially when the author cum instructor is herself pregnant. I would recommend this to any body, as it is easy to to and does prepare you for an easy delivery. I bought this for my daughter who has already reached her third semester. However, I have supplemented this workout for her with exercises from Reebok using a rubber band to undertake weight exercises to tone her body and increase bone density.

The author cum instructor looks marvelous and exudes confidence  and positive energy and good health which is important for women who are not used to exercising and want to attempt these prenatal pilates exercises.",1265760000,,669,4.964285714285714
2868412,5,B000RIWARG,"When I got pregnant, I bought six pregnancy exercise vidoes. This one is my favorite. First, there are five different 10 minute workouts, and the DVD menu lets you mix and match the order so it can be different every time you do it. Secondly, the workouts are actually challenging, and make your body feel good. I love the buns and thighs section--I will continue to do this even after I have the baby! On days when I feel tired, I just do the flexibility section and it's great. I often end up doing more once I start. Depending on how you feel on any given day, you can work out for 10 minutes or 50 minutes. It works every body part, so you really feel like you're doing something good for yourself.",1265241600,,702,4.285714285714286

Over Christmas I skipped a few weeks, but it was easy to get back into the routine of waking up and doing these workouts. They really have helped me to feel better and more comfortable during this pregnancy and I recommend it to anyone experiencing back pain or muscle tightness. It's easy to fit into a busy schedule since you can do them in as little as 10 minutes, and you aren't sweaty afterwards. I enjoy them in the morning as my back hurts when I get up, but after doing one or two workouts from this video I feel relaxes, stretched, and ready for the day!",1264982400,,668,4.2265625
2868414,5,B000RIWARG,"I'm in the 5th week of my 3rd pregnancy. I gained 45 with my first and was in terrible shape. I didn't loose the weight until after my 2nd pregnancy where I only gained 25, but started overweight. I finally lost all the baby weight and then some and now here I am for #3. I am no where near in great shape, but at least my weight is down and I'm working on it. I started working out early and I've promised myself I would have a more healthy pregnancy this time. My diet is great, I just needed to find a workout that I would enjoy and that wouldn't take an hour of my time. I purchased 4 pregnancy workouts - 2 pilates and 2 yoga and I love them all. I looked at pretty much every prenatal workout Amazon has to offer (spent a couple days reading reviews) and am super happy with my choices. All 4 make the workout very personal, the music is great, and there isn't any of that super peppy over acting stuff like so many workouts. They are all well trained in their art and have many years of experience behind them.

#1 - 10 minute Solution Prenatal Pilates with Lizbeth Garcia
This really energized me. It uses weights along with great moves and my heart rate was up and going. I love Lizbeth Garcia. I LOVE that you can pick which order you do the workouts in and you can do one or as many as you like! I'm looking forward to the postnatal workout after my beautiful little one arrives!

#2 - Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga with Elena Brower
This is a great workout! This is my first time doing yoga, though I've done some of the moves in my regular non-pregnancy pilates workouts, and I'm loving it. It has really loosened up my stiffness and made my hips and lower back feel so much better. I thought I was going to die during my 2nd pregnancy because of all my aches and pains. I talked with many of my friends about yoga and what I should look for. They told me about how I should feel it, but not overstretch, to know what my bodies limits are. The breathing really helps. This one also has a postnatal workout!

#3 - Pilates During Pregnancy with Niece Pecenka
All I can say is - wow! My legs are out of shape. The ab workout is great and helps me feel open and even helped my bloated feeling pass. The leg work is a challenge and has a lot of different moves my other pilates workouts don't, but I know it will get easier as I gain strength. Some of he movements aren't always the same length, but I still love doing this workout.

#4 - Yoga for Pregnancy Labor & Birth with Colette Crawford
I did this today and it really relaxed my body and mind (which I needed as my 3 and 5 year old were running around the house doing crazy things). It's very simple and straightforward and anyone can do it. I feel motivated after doing it and so many pressures are gone. As mentioned in some of the other reviews the girls in it aren't super skinny and that is kind of nice sometimes. She talks a lot about breathing, being in the moment, and just knowing your body. I would recommend this to anyone who just needs some time to learn to relax and do some great stretching to help with aches and pains!

I hope this helps anyone out there looking for some great workouts to stay in shape and feel in control during pregnancy. Just a side note, I've noticed working out really helps me control my cravings and wanting to over eat. It strengthens my mind and helps me feel in control.",1264809600,342,3377,4.197226502311248
2868415,5,B000RIWARG,"This video is awesome!  I used it all 3 trimesters.  With the video being broken down into 10 minute workouts, it allowed me to workout more often without my busy schedule getting in the way or being too tired.  I had a great labor.  No tears, all natural with no epidural.  I pushed for less than 30 minutes.  I still use the workout today post pregnancy just with heavier weights.  I highly reccommend this video.",1264550400,4,415,4.453333333333333
2868416,3,B000RIWARG,"I have been working out all 6 months of my pregnancy and I am about to enter my third trimester and I found this DVD good but not for people who are not already in shape, especially the ab work.  If you do not have a strong core and stomach muscles the section on core strength is not for you.  I have been working out regularly throughout my pregnancy but found the core section a little tough and she does not give variations for the 2nd and 3rd trimesters.  Great workout for beginning pregnancy and will be great as you grow, but if this is your first time trying Pilates you might have to make some variations on your own because she does not give you any.  I will stick with this DVD because I have been doing Yoga throughout my pregnancy and think the prenatal yoga to be a little slow but this is challenging and what I am looking for.",1263945600,37,843,4.185185185185185
2868417,2,B000RIWARG,"I was excited to get this DVD so I could stay in shape while pregnant and also help my core muscles post-natal.

I started at about 7 months pregnant -- I know, maybe too late.  I could do the exercises, but I was worried because so many of them had me on my back.  I disagree with other posters -- I felt like I was on my back for too long and was concerned about blood supply to the baby.
But even worse, in the 2-3 days after doing these exercises, I was so sore that I was uncomfortable and grumpy.  My prepregnacy weight is 120 lbs and during this pregnancy I walked EVERY day -- so I was shocked that I was so sore since I'm not horribly out of shape.

My baby is 8 weeks old now, so I tried the postnatal workout.  The instructor goes really fast, with no introduction, and her instructions weren't clear how to do the positions right.  She doesn't talk about safety for exercising after you've had a baby -- and that's importannt.  For instance with Lisa Hart's workout, she's constantly giving modifications if you've had a C-section, have abdominal muscle separation, etc.  I appreciate that.  But worst of all, AGAIN, I was SO sore (and am still so sore) that I don't even feel like carrying or cuddling my baby.  I am, but it HURTS my chest, neck and shoulders.  Maybe if I kept at it, I would improve -- but the experience is so negative I'm not going back to this DVD EVER.

I would NOT recommend it for an expectant or postpartum mommy.  To be honest, I don't feel the routine was modified for pregnancy at all.  I just feel like the instructor happened to be pregnant and just did her normal routine to show off what she can do (because she is a professional fitness person.)  Not for the average woman.",1263340800,2,1719,4.291925465838509

You can do just one or two segments for a brief workout or all of the segments for a full/intense workout. The instructor moves quite quickly through the routines so you may have to pause the video to get into proper positions or to hold stretches longer but she is pleasant in her instructions. Overall a great workout that causes me to break a sweat but is not over-the-top strenuous. There is also a bonus postnatal workout routine as well.,1260230400,,539,4.684210526315789

2868424,5,B000RIWARG,"This video is perfect for working pregnant moms!  At only 10 minutes per segment it can easily be made a part of almost any day.

The segments-my favorite was the total body segment.  It really tones your muscles and is challenging without being too hard and it doesn't require any equipment except dumbbells.  It also doesn't require you to lay on your back which has worried some reviewers although I agree with another one that none of the segments require laying on the back as much as ultrasounds do.  My next favorite segment is the standing pilates.  It also just requires weights and requires no laying on your back.  The flexibility segment is nice and soothing.  The buns and thighs segment seems to give your lower body a good workout without hurting and has really seemed to aid in helping my hip pain that I've had prior to now starting my third trimester.  The Core Pilates segment is fine too.  It requires pillows and is probably the one I do least often only because I like the other ones so much, especially the Total Body segment.  I'd recommend this tape for that one alone.

Also, the instructor is very knowledgeable without being annoying and she's obviously very pregnant.",1258675200,,1196,4.697115384615385
2868425,5,B000RIWARG,"I am 21 weeks into my third pregnancy. I am overweight to begin with and wanted to get into a good routine. I was afraid that I would find something that was too much of a challenge (I can't dance at all) but this is exactly what I was looking for. The hostess is easy to understand and not at all annoying. The music is in the background and not in your face. The moves are simple and effective and I can already feel my core strengthening after only a week of doing the DVD daily.

I haven't worked up to all five at once, but I have rotated them and done either one or three at a time. The 10 minutes FLIES by and I feel so good afterward. I feel it's helping my posture and my back.

The stretching workout is PERFECT after taking my two kids on a walk. And they don't find the workout annoying either. My 3 year old sits next to me and does it too.

I highly recommend this DVD for someone who's starting out their exercise routine!",1256947200,,937,4.054054054054054
2868426,5,B000RIWARG,"I've always had trouble sticking to an excersize routine, but this DVD makes it so easy. You can do one workout, all five or anything in between depending on how you feel that day. The workouts are challenging but not so exhausting that you dread doing it. The music is nice, and the instuctor is very pleasant. The best part is I know it's safe for baby. Oh- and it comes with a bonus belly flattening workout for after you give birth. Nice touch.",1256688000,,448,4.345238095238095

2868428,5,B000RIWARG,"I give this DVD a top rating. I was looking for something to help me stay strong and toned during this pregnancy and this delivers very pleasantly. The ten minute segments make it easy to fit a workout into your day (even with a toddler to look after). And the DVD allows you to put workouts together in any sequence you like to build a workout up to 50min long. The instructor moves through the sequences fairly briskly which is a challenge at first but once you've been through each workout a few times you get the hang of them. She's also in the last stages of her pregnancy which is confidence inspiring.
Following this workout DVD has helped to give me a sense of control of the changes in my body and a sense of achievement at the end of each segment. Enjoy!",1254700800,,764,4.3125

Each workout is 10 minutes long, so depending on how much time you have that day, you can still work out.  Plus it has the great option of creating your own workout routine in the order you want, which I love!",1253491200,,354,4.115942028985507

2868431,5,B000RIWARG,I love it.  the ability to do only 10 minutes or combine to do a much longer workout is great and I especially like the buns & thighs and the total body work out.  What a great way to keep your muscles toned and working while having a good time.  The time just flys by and I found her a great instructor.,1252540800,,304,3.870967741935484
2868432,4,B000RIWARG,"This DVD is really good. The instructor has a clear voice and her excercises are not too hard(you don't need to be a pilates expert).You can do just 10 minutes a day if you don't have time.
The only down side is I don't think it's enough to mainatin a good flexible body through out your pregnancy so I had to buy a yoga DVD that I thought both complimented each other and I used to follow this one on my busy days and the other one when I had more time :)",1252281600,,456,3.913978494623656

Provides a good work out for my busy schedule without leaving me drained or sore the next day.  Easy to follow, Explained so you can easily follow along from the first time with modifications for different stages of pregnancy.  I usually do yoga or traditional cardio workouts and found Pilates a fun change of pace and just challenging enough for what I have time and energy for at 20+weeks pregnant.",1252281600,,540,4.604166666666667

I had never done Pilates before but had heard of the benefits of toning and stretching.  This is a wonderful workout.  The instructor is very easy to follow and I feel the workouts are wonderfully adapted for pregnant women.  It is not aerobic; but it is a wonderful toning and stretching exercise.  It has helped to greatly decrease my back pain and the pain you can feel high in your rib cage.  If I don't do the DVD each day, I can feel a difference!! I will use this for all additional pregnancies; I'll just start using it sooner than 30 weeks :)",1251504000,,679,4.384

I debated about several Pilates/pregnancy DVDs, but finally chose this. I am very happy with my decision.",1250121600,,344,4.639344262295082
2868439,5,B000RIWARG,"I constantly worked out prior to getting pregnant and found myself too tired the first three months to do anything!  This was the first video I bought (and I never really did pilates before).  I enjoy it and it's nice that you can pick which 10minute intervals you want to do.  I get up early in the morning and sometimes only have time for 1-2 so I can switch the exercises I choose.  Overall, I like it and although she is on her back I haven't had any problems and I'm 18 weeks.  If she can do it and produce a video then obviously it's not as big a deal as they make it sound!!!",1248652800,,582,4.026086956521739
2868440,5,B000RIWARG,"I've used the 10-minute solution pilates series before I was pregnant, and I liked them, but this DVD beats all the others, hands-down. I plan to use this even after the baby is born; it really works out all the muscle groups I need to tone. Each 10-minute segment targets a particular area of concern, but all of them focus on building a strong core to help carry your baby to term. I really appreciate the fact that, while the workouts are gentle enough for pregnancy, they do work up a sweat and get your heart pumping. My favorite segment is the standing pilates routine, which works the arms with weights while also toning the thighs and pelvis. The core segment is better than ones I've tried on other workout DVDs, and the stretch segment makes a fantastic cool-down that leaves you feeling toned and relaxed. This one gets five stars! If you've never tried pilates before and aren't sure about it, this is a great introduction, pregnant or not.",1248566400,,952,4.605882352941176

2868442,5,B000RIWARG,"I really like this DVD.  I am 17 weeks pregnant.  I can see using this DVD post-partum as well.  It is challenging, without being too difficult to complete.  Most of the time I select 30 minutes worth, but if I am feeling really ambitious, I do the whole thing (50 minutes).  I LOVE the 10 minute segments - it really helps to break apart the routine so it isn't boring!  The instructor is 36 weeks pregnant, which motivates me to keep going - even as my belly continues to grow.  I would highly recommend it!",1247097600,,509,4.294736842105263

2868444,4,B000RIWARG,"This video is a great workout.  I read the other reviews about laying on your back, but I do not agree that what the video shows is unsafe.  During the core section, you are supposed to use pillows to ensure that your head stays above your heart.  At another time you only lay on your back while you are rolling your hips side to side.  From what I learned form the Dr. and reading elsewhere, its ok to excersise on your back if you are elevated at EITHER the hips or shoulders/head. Granted, I am not a doctor, so do what you feel is comfortable.  If nothing else, just skip the core section when you get too big!  The only other comment I would like to say is that it goes really fast, which is the same for other 10 minute solutions videos.  So I guess its to be expected.  I use the video at least once a week.",1246233600,3,814,4.0754716981132075

I've been doing this workout for a couple of months, and it's perfect for me. You get cardio, strength training and flexibility work all in one workout, and of course the 10-minute segments allow for total customization, which is great for busy moms (which, let's face it, is all of us!). It's actually fun and I look forward to doing it.

The instructor is never annoying or condescending and her pacing and instructions are perfect. I've never really done pilates before, but I'm a definite convert - I've already bought a few 10-minute solution pilates DVDs for after the baby comes!",1243728000,,708,4.664

It's not difficult to follow or to do these workouts, even if you're just beginning to workout. There are 5 seperate 10 minute portions focusing on the following: Buns and Thighs, Flexibility during pregnancy, Core workout, Standing Pilates and Total Body Pilates. You can choose which ones you want to do to create a custom workout or select all. The core workout focuses on your abdominals and you will lay on your back, which we all know you're not supposed to do during late pregnancy. But you lay on pillows and it's only for a little while. None of the routines get your heart rate up to a dangerous level and since she is clearly pregnant, all moves are specifically for pregnant women to protect the baby, your back and stomach. There is also a great 10 minute workout for flattening abs after delivery, which I hope will come in very handy. I highly recommend this DVD!",1243641600,,1034,4.50531914893617

I used to workout a lot, when I was pregnant with my frist child I would go jogging, this time is different just finding time is difficult.

If you like to exercise and don't mind a challenge, this is perfect. I am so pleased with it. I haven't tried out all of the segments yet, but I think the exercises that she performs really will help out during the entire pregnancy and delivery. I am 5 months pregnant now and have no trouble doing any of the exercises. Hopefully it will work for you as well as it has for me. Good luck.",1242950400,,564,4.044642857142857

2868453,4,B000RIWARG,"I bought this dvd early in my 2nd trimester. I had been in some pain, and didn't have much time for exercise. The simple exercises loosen up sore muscles in a hurry- and the workout regimen can be tailored to fit your schedule and needs. If you were fairly active before pregnancy, this might not be vigorous enough for you, but for a cubicle dweller like myself this is perfect when combined with a simple walking regimen.

Be aware that you do lie on your back at times- but not for long and you are always moving so no harm should come to either you or your baby.",1241740800,,566,4.2407407407407405

It allows you to do all 5 workouts or pick and choose depending on how much time you have or what area of your body you feel like working. The instruction is upbeat and easy to follow but moves a little fast. Although, I guess if you really want to fit all the moves in a 10 minute series, it would have to move along at a steady pace. There are short moments in the workout where it requires you to lay on your back. (Don't panic) I have not had any problems with it and to be honest, I have been flat on my back for longer periods of time at my doctor's office for ultrasounds.  I will use this throughout the rest of my pregnancy (I'm 30 weeks now) and will use the postnatal series after I recover from giving birth.",1241654400,,790,4.064102564102564

She is not extreme. She is slow enough for those of us who fairly worked out and fast enought for you to break a sweat.

I love that I am able to create my own workout so that there is variety. There are 5 prenatal workouts and post workout on the DVD. If I only want to work out for 10 minutes then I have that option as well.

When I get done with my workout I feel good and as if I accomplished something. I never feel like I am doing to much and that I might be harming the baby. I would recommend this to any pregnant woman.

You should have a mat and some 2-5 pound weights handy for some of the workouts.",1239580800,,770,3.8607594936708862

The instructor is easy to follow, she gives good tips for modification, slowly adds difficulty to the exercises, and seems very natural. Yes, there are short segments on your back, but all the while you are moving, (tilted abs, spinal twists and precursor to bridges, which by the way, the latter two, you do in regular prenatal yoga class). The instructor herself is 36 weeks pregnant and I doubt she would put herself at risk either. I love the option to mix and match your workout or do as much as your busy schedule allows.

I bought this and several other exercise DVD's and this has impressed me more than any of the others.  This workout was easy for me to do and it never overexerted me. I felt revitalized after the workout--which is a rarity for me. I really like Lizbeth and she is not annoying at all--she seems very normal which is hard to find when watching pregnancy exercise DVD's.  She speaks slowly and gives clear instructions. She is pretty easy to follow. My husband doesn't make fun of me when he sees me working out to this, unlike the others. Another thing that I love about this DVD is that it is customizable.  It is categorized into 5 different segments.  You can choose to watch just one, or you can choose different combinations of the different segments and create your own customizable exercise session.  Why don't all my DVD's do that?  I have never done Pilates before, so I don't know how it compares to other Pilates DVD's, but I am definitely sold on this one and happy I own it.

The time spent on your back is quite brief, and the instructor (who is 36+ weeks herself) keeps you moving or on an incline for all of it. I'm not overly concerned about this.",1227398400,,515,4.4787234042553195

2868476,5,B000RIWARG,"After a shaky first trimester, my doctor gave me the ok to exercise again. I started shopping for a good, fun workout DVD. I tried the ""Buff Moms-to-be"" workout - don't bother with that one. Way to wimpy. Next, I got the ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" DVD. I love that workout. By far my favorite. However, there isn't much core work involved, so I thought I'll get a pilates DVD, so I can alternate workouts. So, I ordered ""Pilates during Pregnancy."" That workout is way too brutal. It made me hurt all over, and not in a good way. Finally, I ordered the ""10-Minute Solution Prenatal Pilates"" DVD. Oh, how I love this workout. The whole body gets a workout. Every muscle in your body is working. The workout is just right - not too wimpy and not too hard. Very doable. You'll feel great afterwards. The instructor is very pleasant, and the background is very inviting. The music is there, but not overpowering. There are five 10 minute sections: Standing Pilates, Core Pilates, Pilates for Buns & Thighs, Total Body Pilates, and Pilates for Flexibility (my favorite). You can select the ""Play All"" feature, or you can create your own workout by selecting only the sections you want to do. I recently started some physical therapy for my sciatica, and the therapist commented on how great my muscle tone is, especially in my core. I told her about this DVD, and she told me to keep it up, since it seems to work well. I'm now 34 weeks pregnant, and I will continue to use this DVD and ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" as long as I can.
A number of people have raised some concerns about some of the exercises on this DVD that are done laying on your back. First of all, the amount of time you spend on your back is extremely short. A couple of minutes at the most. I spend more time laying on my back during ultrasounds. Also, the physical therapist gave me some exercises to do at home for my sciatica, and those exercises have me laying flat on my back for 3-5 minutes, so it can't be that bad. Also, while you are laying on your back, during this workout, you are moving around, so I could imagine that prevents blockage of blood flow. But, you need to do what you feel comfortable with. I would definitely recommend this DVD for a great pre-natal workout.",1218240000,456,2259,4.472154963680388
2868477,5,B000RIWARG,"I'm in the 7th month of my third pregnancy. With my first two, I didn't really exercise much beyond long walks with my dog. This one was an oops AND I'm almost 37, so I decided to try some exercising to stay in better shape. When I'm not pregnant, I am a regular exerciser and like to stay fit with jogging, some pilates, some yoga, etc. I've used the 10 minute solution series for years and liked how easy it is to fit into my schedule as a working mom.

I ordered this DVD a month ago when I was 6 months along and absolutely LOVE it. It is not meant to be a cardio workout, but is perfect for toning and stretching. I see results in my arms, legs, and it has helped my back be more comfortable as the baby gets bigger. I never knew you could do abdominal exercises while pregnant, but I love what is included. Lisbeth (or whatever her name is) is great because she is at 36 weeks while doing the workout--very inspiring. My only ""complaint"" is that she does move quickly from one thing to the next, so until you do it quite a few times, you may need your remote nearby to pause while you move your body from floor to kneeling on all fours, etc. I may just be slow...

If you've used and enjoyed the 10 minute solution series, you won't be disappointed with this one. It's been a perfect solution for my desire to exercise and feel better about this pregnancy. I don't think I would have found it all that great until the 2nd trimester, when I stopped running. I look forward to the bonus section on getting your tummy flat after the baby is born, too.",1217030400,,1554,4.193979933110368
2868478,4,B000RIWARG,"This video has a great variety of exercises in the 5 segments, which is so helpful. While there are some on-the-back exercises in a few of the segments, I just do those on pillows. I feel the results of the segments, the stretching motions help with pregnancy back pain, the varied exercises of each segment helps me change up the workout and holds my interest, and the short time span of each segment flies by so it helps eliminate excuses for not exercising. A great buy for expectant mothers!",1211932800,,495,4.573033707865169
2868479,4,B000RIWARG,"I really liked this.  I did pilates before and this was pretty tough, but I actually felt like I got a good workout.  There were a couple of things I questioned whether were really safe, however, there is enough in the workout that I felt was safe and I enjoyed!  I felt confident too that the instructor was 36 weeks pregnant and did the workout and I don't think she would jeopordize her health.",1203292800,2,397,4.337837837837838
2868480,5,B000RIWARG,"I love this prenatal workout!  Each workout is 10 minutes long, but you can choose which ones you want to do, and which order you want to do them in.  I love the fact that you can control how long of a workout you want.  They also show how to adjust each move depending on which trimester you are in.  If you like pilates, you will enjoy this workout.",1202860800,,351,4.043478260869565
2868481,5,B000RIWARG,"I'm a beginner at pilates; I did some before I was pregnant and wanted to do it while I was pregnant, but I was very crunched for time being a first year teacher.  I finally ordered this because I liked the other 10 minute solution pilates DVD I had.  I felt so good after doing the segments!  The 10 minute commitment each day is a doable goal and I usually do more than one segment because I feel so good after I'm done.  The stretching helps the back pain and I feel better and sleep better.  As for laying on your back, you are constantly moving and it isn't very long, so it doesn't seem like a problem to me.",1201824000,,614,4.083333333333333
2868482,5,B000RIWARG,I am 26 weeks along and thoroughly enjoy this workout. I try to do all 5 sets when I can but I love that it's broken up in 10 minute segments. It's a great workout that makes you feel like you have accomplished something at the end. Plus all the stretching really helps me sleep better at night and has helped my back feel less strained. As far as the very few exercises you do on your back I don't see how they can be hazardous as they are for very short periods of time. You cant beat this video especially for the price!,1201824000,,523,4.038461538461538
2868483,4,B000RIWARG,I have never done pilates but i had always wanted to try it out.  When I became pregnant I went right away to best buy to get a dvd to workout with but all they had was this dvd.  to tell you the truth I just love this dvd.  The workouts are so easy and after I am done I feel really good.  I have noticed a difference in my legs and arms since I started to do the tape.  I will be using this dvd for this whole pregnancy and I will use it for the next one.  And I plan on getting more 10 Minute Solution dvd's because I think they are so great.,1199836800,2,545,3.6551724137931036
2868484,4,B000RIWARG,I like that this video is broken into 10 minute increments. It makes it easy to select the parts you like and skip the parts you dont. I wish my yoga video was like this! The workout is pretty decent too. She moves through it all really quickly so it takes a while to get the hang of it. But once you do it's not too bad. The lower body segment has some great leg/butt toning exercises. I always skip the abs section.,1198108800,,417,4.036144578313253
8200863,1,B000RIWARG,I bought Used Very Good condition. Never got to try it since the 1st time I put in in the DVD player it didn't work... tested other DVDs and they were fine. Its just this one. No noticeable scratches either. Wont repurchase. Ill just find a different DVD. Not what a pregnant momma wants to deal with when she finally has the energy to exercise.,1526601600,,345,4.323076923076923
8200864,4,B000RIWARG,I have really enjoyed this DVD during my pregnancy. The buns and thigh section as well as the flexibility are my favorite!,1526342400,,122,4.590909090909091
8200865,5,B000RIWARG,I was worried that this workout DVD was not going to be challenging enough since it is prenatal. It actually kicked my butt! I have been doing BodyPump and other circuit training classes and weight lifting for the year prior to getting pregnant and I wanted to find something that was challenging but also safe that I wouldn't have to overthink. This 40-minute circuit of 4 different pilates tracks is the perfect mix. I like that the weights are incorporated in each set. The pillows make it very comfortable and safe. I was not worried about any of the moves and was quite impressed with Lizbeth's flexibility and range of motion despite having quite a bump! What a great workout that can empower pregnant women and lead to better and healthier pregnancy outcomes.,1525392000,,766,4.7669172932330826
8200866,5,B000RIWARG,I love this. I've done it with 4 pregnancies now. I recommend it!,1524700800,,65,4.076923076923077
8200867,1,B000RIWARG,Way too easy,1523664000,,12,3.3333333333333335
8200868,5,B000RIWARG,I have used this workout throughout two pregnancies and I absolutely love it! I love that I can workout anywhere between 10-50 minutes because of the 5 - 10 minute segments. The flow and direction provided by the instructor is really smooth and clear which means you don't have to watch her the whole time to keep up.,1521504000,,317,4.482758620689655
8200869,5,B000RIWARG,"This was my favorite of several preggo videos. I liked choosing the workouts and I felt that I could get the appropriate amount of exercise as I progressed into my last trimester. If you've done Pilates or core workouts before your pregnancy, you're gonna love the preggo adjustments that are all there for you.",1519430400,,311,4.777777777777778
8200870,5,B000RIWARG,"Easy to follow, and I still use this after giving birth since theres a postnatal workout",1518048000,,88,4.5625
8200871,5,B000RIWARG,"I love that there are selections to pick from each time you do this workout. You can choose to do the whole DVD or you can choose from a variety of short segments. You can also put the segments in the order that you want, which is awesome if you have to prioritize (in case you get interrupted and can't finish). I liked having the option to do the whole workout or just a 5 minute segment.

I also liked that there are varying levels of difficulty. Options are a great thing to have when you are pregnant and this DVD offers that for the buyer.",1517097600,,545,4.1415094339622645
8200872,5,B000RIWARG,"I researched many different DVDs when I became pregnant and settled on this as one to start with.  Overall, I love it and I have recommended it to others! In the early days when I didn't feel like working out I would talk myself into just doing one 10 minute work out and I usually ended up doing 2.  I love how you can mix and match based on your energy and time. I continue to work this DVD into my workouts and I am almost 5 months along.  The music may be a little cheesy but if that is what you base your review off of then turn on some of your own music!",1516665600,,560,3.8521739130434782
