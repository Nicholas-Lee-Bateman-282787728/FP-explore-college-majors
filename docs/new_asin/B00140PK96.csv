3121119,5,B00140PK96,"Keeping in mind this is an independent film, I highly recommend it as a quirkily fun watch.

Jack is your stereotypical NY businessman, stuck in his groove, far from happy but 'satisfied' with the status quo.  Jill is the stereotypical free spirit who crosses paths with him while lost in the city (trying to find a street using a subway map).  Jack is intrigued by Jill, doesn't like the idea of her living in a shelter with no contacts in the city, so he invites her home to use his spare bedroom.  Jill spices up his life, brings out his smile, and even his best friend/coworker notices a change in Jack for the better.  But Jill has a penchant for disappearing for stretches of time, and this really bothers Jack.  Their manifesto says ""Be Honest""... but Jill's hiding the fact that her lungs are giving out on her via Cystic Fibrosis and she has to check into the hospital for 'tune-ups' when things get bad for her.  When Jack finds out the truth, will he ditch her, or realize that life is short, and you grab on and live it with those you love, waging war on the ugly bits.  The movie is very ""Sweet November"" with a more charming hero and more child-like heroine.

I know the plot sounds like a tearjerker, but this is hugely light-hearted for a drama (from 5000 'Stupid' stickers being thrown off a building, the off-the-wall best friend who flings ice cream and does the robot while singing poetry, and a wrestling 'fight' between two business men on the company's roof... to philosophical conversations with pigeons). Surprisingly, for a dying heroine movie, this has a wonderfully happy ending.",1278460800,2,1607,4.630281690140845
3121120,1,B00140PK96,"A painful film that can neither be categorized as a romantic comedy or as a life-shortening pull-at-the-heart strings piece. I would have to put it as a needed to pay the rent film for both actors. This is another NY love story with sap, bad music, fake roles, forced performances and a misplaced plug for an important sickness (CF).

The initial narration by Robert Forster (very recognizable voice) helps break up the uncomfortable feeling of corny moments but his take mysteriously disappears. Putting aside the obvious camera car carrier/trailer in every window they pass,  forced dialogue or a pigeon having the best scenes, one might enjoy the film. It is a light fluff piece, but not sure if even the teen girls will come back liking this. Has to be the worst music I have heard in a ""romantic comedy"" sex scene in years. The split screen communications can be better seen in Conversations with Other Women or the X Files bathtub episode, not this.

I would recommend watching Dandelion or even Hustle & Flow to see Manning's work - I am sure with eight films in production there will be something better down the pike for her. See Brooklyn Rules for FP Jr. Usual ratings miss as the multiple breast shots are not even listed by the MPAA. The DVD has a brief making of docu (actually a horribly made plug piece), deleted scenes,  and finally a well made history of the filmmaker and her quest to do this (On Set On Edge 5-part series) - the highlight of this film for me. IF you are an indie movie maker - watch just this docu and check the associated websites they mention.",1214956800,7,1581,4.575971731448763

taryn manning plays jill is sick with cystic fibrosis and her goal in life to is affect someone elses life in a positive way and that is exactly what she does with jack(freddie prinze jr) an uptight set in his ways ad exuctive who bumps into her on a random day. wow makes you wish this would happen to you. anyhow he ends up giving her a ride home, feels very bad about where she lives so he offers her to stay with him until she can find something a better, well romance blossoms and she ends up changing his life and he becomes very protective of him
its love when you least expect it where you least expect it
she changed his life for the better
and its just bittersweet with her health condition
great perfomances",1214870400,7,888,5.089041095890411
