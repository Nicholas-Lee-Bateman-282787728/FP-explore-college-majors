2570409,3,B000FKP4JC,"Surprisingly these three movies bring up the question of tolerance. Piglet is looked down upon initally for his small size. The Tigger Movie shows Tigger's initial pride in being the ""Best Thing About TIggers"" (supposing that he's the only one). But then he begins to mope as his friends don't seem to be as manically into bouncing about as he is.

Pooh's Heffalump movie is perhaps the best of the bunch. The elder animals become frightened of a loud noise they hear at night. Roo, Kanga's son, thinks the noise is cool. So having made provisions, the elder animals go on an expedition to catch the Heffalump. (Hilariously, it falls upon Eeyore to carry most of the luggage and so he must shoulder a pack the size of a house.) Roo ofcourse finds the Heffalump first, well atleast a younger version of one anyway. This is a first for fans: in all the history of the TV show and movies, we've never before been granted the opportunity to meet a heffalump. And ""Lumpy"" doesn't disappoint.",1168300800,,986,4.634285714285714
2570410,5,B000FKP4JC,"I gave this set of movies as a gift to my daughter, she loves Pooh. I did the numbers and it was cheaper to buy the set than the movies separately. The three of them are pretty good, specially the Heffalump movie which is the most recent. I've watched all of them many times with my daughter and I still don't get bored. The multi-language option is nice since we watch them first in English and then in Spanish.",1167004800,3,412,4.227848101265823
