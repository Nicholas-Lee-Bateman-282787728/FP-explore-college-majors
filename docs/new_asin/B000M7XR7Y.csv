2726841,3,B000M7XR7Y,"a good movie for a diehard flyers fan, but a little drawn out.spends a great deal of time on early history and not much on recent.",1293408000,,130,4.038461538461538
2726842,5,B000M7XR7Y,"Excellent video ! even gives respect to Eric Lindros and his huge involvement in turning the team around. I originally feared that due to the Org - gan - I - zations view of Eric ( Ed Snider's ) that he would be bypassed . It is small but it is at least recognized.

The rest of the video is fantastic.

Great Buy",1279929600,2,313,3.9523809523809526

2726844,4,B000M7XR7Y,"I have not rated this item as yet.  It is a birthday gift for my youngest son is an avid fan of the Flyers for many years.  He will get the DVD in November 2009.  A review at that time will be possible.  Until then, no comment.

The 4-star rating is a guess.  To date, I have not been disappointed with any sports DVDs ordered through Amazon.",1255651200,,342,4.029850746268656
2726845,5,B000M7XR7Y,"I gave this to my boyfriend for his 25th birthday recently. He is a big hockey buff, loves the Flyers, knows all about their history, and he thought this was a solid DVD. It doesn't skip over important seasons and gives a very comprehensive look at this franchise. I give it 5 stars because I actually sat through it and was really entertained! I've only been watching hockey for a few years now, and wouldn't call myself a ""big fan."" Also I liked it because it made me feel like a cool girlfriend for getting him a gift he actually enjoyed.",1246320000,5,541,4.366336633663367
2726846,4,B000M7XR7Y,"This disc was a fairly comprehensive look at Flyers history throughout the years, and, unlike the 10 DVD set, includes Lindros and his contribution to the franchise from the Legion of Doom days.  All in all, I can say that this title is a keeper and a nice addition to any Flyers fan collection.

The only complaint I have is the choice of background music.  It should be removed before someone strokes out from too much fat/cholesterol.  Just because the DVD is about Philly does not mean that the quality of ::CHEESINESS:: should be the order of the day piled atop all things originating from the City of Brotherly Love.  Tocchet and mullets I can deal with, but I'll pass on the cheesy muzak.",1199318400,9,695,4.57258064516129
