6333271,5,B00J4LMKS6,"Axel: The Biggest Little Hero is a story about a boy named Axel, who sets off to a journey to find a grove of edible Bonta cactus to save his home from starvation. Along the way he makes multiple friends with distinct personalities. Of course, this is all in a fantastic world with the main characters' bodies similar to spring toys and a wide variety of mechanical characters! You will never ever guess what the ultimate tool Axel and his friends use to save the day is.
In its entirety, this movie feels a bit rushed, but definitely makes up for it with its depth and characters. The sequels show a lot of promise!",1406332800,,616,4.412280701754386
6333272,5,B00J4LMKS6,Love this movie!!! Very easy content for kids to understand. I'd say it's an excellent movie for adults to watch as well not only the storyline reminded me of my childhood dreams but the high quality of the animations attracted my eyes. It surely worth to watch and you'll be impressed! I highly recommend this movie to everyone!,1406246400,,329,4.689655172413793
6333273,5,B00J4LMKS6,"I am trying to think of a movie to compare this one too, but I can't.  I'm not sure what the animation is exactly but its different, in a good way.  Its not like cartoon animation but its not claymation either, kinda a combination of both?  The movie is an underdog movie where we were rooting for AXEL.  Oh and about the characters they don't have bodies, they remind me of those little wind-up toys you can play with.  They have arms, a head and a foot they hop on, strange but cute.  So anyways, the movie is about the underdog, AXEL, who decides he wants to do something significant and save his village.  He meets some interesting characters along the way and has some adventure with his friend who tags along.  I watched the movie with my kids ages 3, 6 and 7, and didn't notice anything in-appropriate.  There was one part I remember that might be a little scary for some kids, but it didn't bother mine.  I'd recommend this movie for anyone looking for a new kids movie and something out of the normal characters from today!",1403049600,2,1032,4.38421052631579

8648043,1,B00J4LMKS6,"I have to say that this was probably the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure to experience. Ever. I am not sure what form of recreational substance that the people that gave this multiple stars were using, but either they have never seen a good movie, or they just put their kid in front of this one and then walked out of the room for an hour and a half, because they definitely didn't watch the same steaming pile of cinematic train-wreck that I did. I want my 90 minutes back.",1444176000,,487,4.247311827956989
8648044,3,B00J4LMKS6,"The story is a typical ""hero"" wannabe learning not to act like a jerk, but the story had too many of the ""jerk"" moments for my taste. A number of the characters are off-putting.  The animation is cute.  The movie wasn't horrible.  I just wouldn't recommend it, and I certainly would not have purchased the video had I seen the movie first.",1444089600,,339,4.435483870967742
