3597687,4,B001G7Q15O,"In the early 1970s, a spacecraft has splashed down off the coast of California. When the craft is recovered by the U.S. military, they are shocked to see that it carries three ape passengers, Zira (Kim Hunter), Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Milo (Sal Mineo). Scientists and officials start to figure out what to do with the intelligent and, as they later discover, talking apes. It is not long before Zira and Cornelius become celebrities in America.

Coming off the lackluster Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Escape is a noticeable improvement. Both the Zira and Cornelius characters are likable and the actors do a good job of handling this movie. The film is an entertaining look at what the first movie would have been like if the tables had been turned as human society figures out what to do with apes unlike anyone has ever seen. Plus, the movie has a pretty good score by Jerry Goldsmith.

Overall, this was a fairly entertaining film. It may not be as good as the original, but it is better than the second movie.",1423785600,,1027,4.637362637362638
3597688,5,B001G7Q15O,"hello,
  ok, this escape from the POTA was so much better than the last version that was made in 1970.  but the campy antics of the people of the planet are a little silly.  this movie was more character driven and there actually was a decent plot as well as believable action.  you get to know more about the characters and how they all fit into the whole POTA concept.

At first, the world loves them. There's some funny scenes, and their attempt to join human culture is very interesting. However, the movie is very campy and shows its age.

Ironically, the silliest movie in the Apes franchise has the darkest ending. I won't say much, but the events in this film lay the groundwork for the ape revolution.

It's an enjoyable film, although strange and silly. Definetely watch it if you plan on seeing Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes",1405728000,,645,4.792792792792793

3597710,3,B001G7Q15O,"In part 2, Zira claims Cornelius beat her as if it were a cultural norm in Ape society  - that's when I became more convinced that this is about Japanese excuses for waging war.

In Escape, we are given a view of their shoes - precursors to Nike's Air RIft (rift compatible?) and the even more hideous toe shoes available presently.

With cold calculation, polite sweet talking ZIra chucks the chimp baby in the water.

This begins the message that if we forget history, we are doomed to repeat it and if we sentimentally or politcally correctly (as Charlton Heston condemned at a commencement address), we became enablers in our own destruction.

It's not nurture over nature.  It's always nature as the rest of the series will play out.

The apes are so unattractive that their message that there are two sides to every story will invite a shenanigans reaction.",1405036800,,863,4.713333333333333

3597715,3,B001G7Q15O,"In the third installment of the popular Planet Of The Apes franchise we get to witness the series beginning its historic ride off the rails. Coming from Earth of 3955 to 1973 on one of the spacecraft that the astronauts used from the first two films, our spunky heroes Cornelius and Zira begin a laughable journey into the ""hip"" culture of the 70's. While one would think that two talking chimpanzees landing from space would create quite a bit of hysteria not to mention Charles Darwin spinning in his grave, they are treated in the same manner as you might treat Aunt Gert and Uncle Floyd who are visiting the big city for the first time. The chimps are embraced by our culture and are turned into celebrities with Zira doing the lecture circuit (Groan) and Cornelius trying to keep the choke chain on Zira. One would even think that Roddy McDowell who played Cornelius didn't want a big part in this film as Kim Hunter who played Zira had ample more screen time. The human actors are no better as with the wooden way they speak their dialogue it would appear that most of them came direct out of Central Casting. Well, eventually the paranoia of man but mostly evil Victor Neumann (Eric Braedon before he did Young And The Restless)  want those apes caged! However, we know how it will end with Man being stupid and the apes winning our hearts. While this film is rated ""G"" I have to say that a death scene involving a falling dummy at the very end is somewhat gruesome to watch. I have seen this film countless times and the way it lands still gets me every time. Yes, they show it all the way down from a top down perspective.

The other item worth noting is the budgets for these films. The original 1968 film was budgeted at 3 million dollars. As each subsequent sequel was made the budget was further reduced by $500,000. By the time they made this leaking lifeboat the budget was 2 million. Where they spent it is unknown as the sets and dcor were straight out of used prop shop. In fact, by the time they made the last film of this series the budget was less than $1,000,000. By then all of the background apes were wearing cheap masks and believe me, it shows. You can start to see the masks making their debut in the next installment Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes!",1403136000,,2281,4.415676959619953
3597716,2,B001G7Q15O,"While the first two movies were awesome, this one is a decidedly 70s movie targeted to the pop-culture of the time, with a couple of Planet of the Apes characters thrown in just to milk a few extra dollars from the franchise.

3597717,1,B001G7Q15O,"After watching the first two in this series, I just found this, which I believe is the third in the series, to be quite boring. I stopped watching after only 15 minutes. It reminded me of a rather mediocre made for TV movie from the 1970s.",1401840000,,239,4.217391304347826

3597719,2,B001G7Q15O,"This review is provided to you, by someone whose parents had not yet met during the theatrical release of this film.
I remember watching the re-runs of these movies on TV when I was growing and it only because of this nostalgia that I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1. A cheesy as these films were, it brought the family together in front of the TV, to glance into an alternate reality of the world we lived in, if only for a few hours.

Taking into consideration that modern-day special effects did not exist, I'm basing this my review on the two simple criteria: 1) the story or plot 2) the actors/actresses performances. I'm not going to completely exclude special effects, since I seen countless films from that era and older that managed to wow their audience despite the technological limitation of the time.

So here goes, this movie sucked. There's just no nice way to put it. Cornelious' and Zira's character development seemed to regress from the original two films. I am not sure if this was by design, or it was just horrible acting, but I was not amused. As for the story, it started off with a HUGE plot hole. Cornelious, Zira, and Milo managed to recover Taylor's space craft from the middle of the dead lake where it sank, and somehow find themselves inside the spaceship after Taylor destroyed the world with. I can go into more details, but both wikipedia and other reviews probably have pretty much covered this story in full detail. Needless to say, the rest of the film was not much better. Weak performances by nearly every actor in the film, plot hole after plot hole, and special effects that would make early silver screen producers cringe.

If you're looking to engross yourselves in this primate universe, in preparation to the new upcoming film, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", then stick with the first two films and definitely watch ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"".",1400371200,,1898,4.626112759643917
3597720,2,B001G7Q15O,This movie gave me the heebie jeebies. I had to stop watching it. It is totally predictable and a classic plot. The evolved chimpanzees get hurled back in time through a space time continuum after an explosion. Humans think they are from a different planet. The chimpanzees are not accepted as colleagues and spend the rest of the movie building credibility while one or two humans acknowledge them and the masses reject them.

3597737,4,B001G7Q15O,"After narrowly escaping the destruction of Earth using the ship that was left behind by Colonel Taylor, ape scientists Cornelius, Zira, and Dr. Milo are thrust back in time through a worm hole that transports them to the year 1973. Government officials sieze and detain them immediately, but unfortunately Milo is killed in a tragic accident. When it is discovered that the two remaining apes possess the ability to speak, they become an instant sensation with the media, and a threat to the government. Fearing that their arrival could signal the fall of humanity, it is decided that Zira and Cornelius are to be destroyed, along with their unborn child!

Despite the explosive finale in BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES, the thrilling Science Fiction series continues onward thanks to the thoughtful (although inconsistent) tools used in ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES! This chapter poses a complete reversal on the original film, asking what would happen if the tables were turned and man were the one to discover that he is not the only form of intelligent life on the planet. The opening act plays as a ""fish out of water"" comedy, as the two apes join high society while attempting to learn the customs of the humans. The ethical dilemma occurs when Zira mistakenly divulges that her kind will inevitably rule over man, and the government is forced to decide if it is right to destroy three innocent lives if it means preserving the lives of many. The tone shifts dramatically as Cornelius and Zira head out on the run to protect their newborn son, which leads us to another depressing ending. Despite the reduced budget and diminishing make-up designs, ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES is another smartly-played sequel that opens the series up to a whole new string of adventures!

 I assumed they used the second space craft as opposed to the first.
 The movie came out in the early 70s, only a decade after Spider-man and the Hulk were given origins from radiation.

Otherwise, it is a brilliant juxtaposition to the first Planet of the Apes. The same apes who took pity on Heston's character are now brought to present day Earth.  Worth watching. Especially if you like the original POTA and the recent Rise of the Apes movie.",1341619200,,594,4.619047619047619
3597742,4,B001G7Q15O,"This is the third in the series, but it jumps back in time by about 2,000 years. Not too surprising when you remember that the last movie ended with the Doomsday Bomb. We did not learn until the start of this movie that Zira (Kim Hunter), Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) and Dr. Milo (Sal Mineo) had retrieved Taylor's space ship from the lake he had originally landed in, repaired it, and escaped just before the planet blew up. They land in the US circa 1973, and of course astonish everyone with their ability to talk, and their civilized ways.

But things are not all just diplomatic receptions and amusements. One doctor, an adviser to the president, gets Zira drunk and gets her talking about their lives in the distant future, and concludes that he must alter the future by not allowing the child that Zira is going to have to survive. This sets up a chase and rescue plot line that leads to a circus run by Ricaldo Montelbaum. Toward the end, Zira mentions that she only learned to trust three people in the time they were there. Presumably these were the two doctors from the zoo to which they were first taken, and Montelbaum.

What's fun about this movie is that it completely reverses the focus of the first two. There, apes were everywhere and only a very few humans could talk. Here, humans are everywhere and only three (two, once Dr. Milo is killed by a gorilla) are able to talk. One of my favorite scenes is watching Cornelius and Zira get outfitted in top fashion clothing, apparently from Rodeo Drive.

Just in case there are two or three people out there who have not seen the whole series, I am not going to tell you the ending, and how it sets up the next film's plot.",1337126400,,1686,4.467532467532467

The story begins with a helicopter over the ocean. They see a craft near the beach, soldiers arrive to pull the craft ashore. ""Open it up."" Three travelers step out and remove their helmets! The visitors are locked in the zoo infirmary. We hear their explanation of events. ""Don't take any chances."" The female is tested and shocks the examiners. Something bad happens to a visitor. ""We mean you no harm."" There is another shocking statement! ""I like you."" The news shocks the scientists. The Presidential Commission meets to learn the facts. They speak the language of their ancestors. They come from a distant planet system. ""We came from your future."" The audience applauds. What did they see destroyed? They can't tell all the facts.

Cornelius and Zira are taken to a hotel and shops in Los Angeles. They are shown the sights (like Disneyland). Zira speaks out. ""Beastly"" says Cornelius. Zira faints. ""Grape juice plus."" ""In vino veritas""? What about the future? ""Convince me."" Can we alter the future? There is a philosophical discussion about the two apes. The Presidential Commission makes a decision - they will go to Camp 11 and be questioned. How did apes arise? It began with a great plague. Apes are smarter than dogs and cats. After a few centuries they learned to change their conditions. They want to give a drug to Zira and then question her. They did it for ""science"". Experimental surgery on humans? Will the apes be ""humanely destroyed""? Or will they escape? Can they find a refuge? Yes, and Zira gives birth to Milo. The search is on for the two apes. Armando says farewell. They can hide on an abandoned ship. Lewis gives Cornelius a revolver ""just in case"".

The scientists talk about problems like the population explosion or the threat of nuclear war. They find the clothes of Zira by an oil well. They search the area. The scientist who wants to kill the pair approaches their hide-out noisily. Other armed men arrive. There is a shoot-out. [Who are the savages?]And so their story ends. There is one last surprise. ""Mama.""

This movie is one I hesitated to own because I always found it very painful to watch.  And that is why I think it succeeds.  This is campy, and very '70's...yet to this day I still care for Zira and Cornelius and feel pain by the end at their murder.  So for that reason I think the movie succeeds.

The blu ray editions look fine and this movie while not having the action of the first two movies is still quite a decent movie. Man fears the future the apes represent  not realizing that man will make it happen more than the threat of talking apes. And as the series progresses history is changed with a entirely new future anyways or at least the apes returning from the future has created a NEW timeline which is probably what would happen if you tried to change the past. That old future is still there and you are now in a new universe of possibilities.  Anyways the blu ray has bonus features and is also part of the five picture set ,I like them all although the last one is the weakest.

3597748,4,B001G7Q15O,"It all starts as the funniest comedy ever. Three Chimpanzees escape the holocaust on their planet in their time in Taylor's spaceship and land in California.

The first half is the meeting of those three apes with Americans who do not want to believe they can speak but are fascinated and under the charm of the extraordinary thing it represents. It is hilarious because every single sentence has a double meaning when we shift from man's point of view to the chimpanzees'.

But that funny atmosphere turns sour very fast because the men who interrogate them, namely the CIA, believe them and see the future in their tale, a future of total reversal of the world order, of the natural order, the apes at the top and human beings having regressed to the bottom.

And it is the hunt and the killing. That ending is like the proof that what the apes have said is going to be true. There is really no future for man on this planet and in this life. Apart from that this film is kind of sad.

It represents a strange world, the world of 1973 of frightened human beings who cannot see things the way they could be but only the way they should be according to their own desire of domination. The President could be different but he is impotent and no one obeys him anyway.

3597750,4,B001G7Q15O,"""Escape From The Planet Of The Apes""
is part of the the classic SciFi
movie series begun with ""Planet Of The Apes"".

Three ""apes"" arrive in the pop culture
America of 1973 (?) from a future where
apes are the dominant and intellectually superior
species, able to communicate by spoken
language (English), and humans are as beasts.
Upon their escape, they witness the destruction
of the earth due to a weapon of warfare
created by humans and used by apes.
This film provides a thematic bridge in the
movie series, but also stands on its own.

It is both comic and tragic.
It is notable for trotting out the social
and political concerns as defined by the
pop media of the period in a
heavy-handed way and trivializing
them with humor at the same time.
Social satire well done.

The great thing about this film is that
it gives one numerous themes to consider.
It is serious and rich with meaning
while at the same time campy and fun
and ultimately tragic.

Among the interesting ideas presented are:
- submission to God's will...
- danger of political zealotry...
- ends justifying the means...
- analogy between ""apes"" and the negroid race...
- trumping of absolute truth by majority vote...
- modesty in dress vs. exhibitionism...
- pacifism vs. just use of violence...
- use of animals...
- truth telling and omission...
...and on and on

The film is a great vehicle for discussion
and a definite candidate for repeated viewing.

Sure, the ape costumes are rather silly,
but so what;
we know they are not real apes anyway.

Last, but certainly not least, is the
great, great, great musical score
by Jerry Goldsmith. Wow!

Good plot, interesting characters,
campy humor, serious themes, great music,
action; what's not to like?",1219276800,,1728,4.7558528428093645

An interesting story, it uses the only two likeable characters from Ape City to deal with humanity. Lots of laughs and social barbs but not one of the best of the series.

Despite the lighthearted scenes of Zira speaking for the first time to the unexpected, the presidential inquiry, and the apes tour of the city. This movie has a serious and sometimes grim tone with a sad and tragic ending that may upset some children. I would recommend that you watch this in it's entirety first before you decide if this is suitable for your children. There is no nudity or profanity, so it's safe in that respect. I saw this for the first time when I was roughly 13 years old and the ending traumatized me to no end. I may have been a little extra sensetive then, but to this day I can not forgive Eric Braeden.

3597755,3,B001G7Q15O,"Following the cataclysmic finale of Beneath the Planet of the Apes, there was only one logical direction for the series to go---> back to the future.  The result is an illogically conceived and satirical prequel that will amuse and delight and ultimately devastate with its bleak Shakesperean tragedy.

When Taylor's spacecraft unexpectedly splashes down in 1973 and is retrieved by a military envoy, the three astronauts that emerge from the capsule are not revealed to be Taylor, Landon and Dodge, but rather the astonishing simian ape-o-nauts Cornelius, Zira and Milo... the third of which is a completely disposeable character who is appropriately killed off very early by a caged zoo gorilla who was probably jealous that the talking simian chimpanzees were getting all of the attention.  With Milo out of the picture, the story focuses on the relationship between Cornelius and Zira in ways that were not afforded the opportunity in the two previous films and is filled with tongue-in-cheek episodes inspired by Pierre Boulle's original novel as Cornelius and Zira go around ""aping"" 20th century human culture (a subtle and clever mockery of our own) in an attempt to make themselves fit in to our society.

While Cornelius and Zira make themselves at home as cultural ""celebrities"" they are being carefully monitored under the watchful auspices of the nefarious Dr. Otto Hasslein played by recognizable character actor Eric Braeden (of Young and the Restless fame) who listens with great interest to what the talking chimps have to say about where they came from during a Presidential Inquiry and how they managed to arrive in Taylor's spacecraft as Cornelius explains that it landed on their seaboard and was repaired by Milo -- an implausibility which is the film's glaring continuity error since Taylor's spacecraft immediately sunk into the depths of the Forbidden Zone it is a far fetched conclusion that they somehow managed to not only find, retrieve and repair it (even if they had repaired Astronaut Brent's crashed spacecraft from Beneath) with engineering far in advance of their own intellectual ape intelligence (which Milo only ""half-understood"" as Cornelius describes it) but managed to do so and escape within a very small window of time before the planet was obliterated by the shockwave of destruction catapulting them backwards in time and arriving at roughly the same destination and era as Taylor's original point of departure (it could be argued that these narrative discrepancies support the theory of ""Hasslein's Observed Time Curve"" which suggests that a predestination paradox created alternate intersecting timelines as illustrated by the incongruent timeline of events that occur between Conquest and Battle).  Nevertheless, once you get past the narrative gaps and just go with it, Escape is a fun and dramatically intense film but is my least favorite second only to the weakest link in the evolutionary Apes chain; Battle For The Planet of the Apes.

When Zira announces that she is pregnant, the film takes a dark and conspiratorial turn when the government realizes the consequence a race of intelligent talking apes will have on the future of our human civilization.  In an effort to protect their newborn (the ape who would become Caesar), Cornelius and Zira find refuge with Armando, a sideshow circus entertainer played by the extravagant Ricardo Montalban who gladly welcomes the simian family with open arms, but it isn't long before Dr. Hasslein picks up the fugitives' trail and hunts them down in a tragic and inevitable climax that sets up the paradox of the entire Planet of the Apes chronology.",1147737600,,3646,5.179966044142614

This film supposes that Cornelious and Zira somehow retrieved the ship and repaired it and were able to fly it back through time.  All this was done in the short time from when Brent left their camp in the second film till he reached the mutant camp, which at most was a day).

3597758,4,B001G7Q15O,"This film in 1971, the third episode of Planet Of The Apes series, is very comic at first but it belies the ultimate catastrophe human beings will or will not be avoided in distant future. Previous two films are about 40th century Earth where apes with extraordinary intelligece rule the planet while men there are degraded into slave status despised by apes. It just reminds me of that of humans called ""yahoo"" similarly despised by horses in ""The Gullver's Travels"" by Jonathan Swift. Third of the series suddenly bring us back to present world to 1973. It might be the sort of Hollywood ploy we have seen in Jurassic Park II Lost World that made the bio-bred dinosaur to land in American soil.
Three ape scientists escaped from warring 40th century Earth landed somewhere off the American coast captured by the U.S. forces. They were first sent to the zoo but after Zira spoke ""Because I loath bananas"" they are suddenly welcomed as guests becoming sort of celebrity. The ape couple Zira and Cornelius are really comical and I can't help laughing at their witty remarks such as the ironical usage of ""human"" and ""beastly"". But after government committee finds out about gloomy future awaiting us mankind, they orders to have their new-born baby killed. The couple escapes with the aid of their kind animal behaviorist and circus owner who might have devised a remarkable trick we will find out at the end of the film.

3597767,4,B001G7Q15O,"Even if you are not an APES series fan, this movie grows on you.  It is easily the most intentionally comic of the series, and features a cleverly plotted mix of real drama and sci-fi, and placing the action in  then-present day Los Angeles gives it a peculiar point of view, one that  succeeds almost brilliantly.  Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall inhabit their  roles so completely that you believe utterly that they are apes, and that  their peril is real.  Since I love the twists in a movie that give it  gravity and an enduring quality, I love the strange sense of doom and  tragedy that pervades this movie, even when it is at its most humorous.  The final moments remain chillingly effective, and paved the way for the  many, many copycat plots featured in movies yet to come.  Forget BENEATH...  -- go directly to this movie; you will not be disappointed.",945388800,,861,4.5855263157894735
3597768,5,B001G7Q15O,"The preceding film, ""BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES"", ends with a nuclear weapon destroying all life on the apes' future Earth.

  ""ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES"" begins by establishing that three apes (Cornelius, Zira, and Dr. Milo, played resepctively by Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, and Sal Mineo) escaped Earth's destruction. They have managed this by repairing astronaut Taylor's spaceship(which crashed in the first movie) and piloting it through the same rift in time that took the astronauts forward in time from the 20th Century to the 40th. This is a retcon from the previous movie, in which it was a combination of the rift and time spent in suspended animation that allowed the astronauts to survive in the interim centuries.

  The apes arrive on present-day Earth, splashing down on the Pacific coast. The Navy hauls the ship to the beach, and the apes remove their helmets. They are quickly transported to seclusion for examination and are later moved to a secluded are of the Los Angeles Zoo. Milo is killed by a mean-spirited gorilla agitated by an argument, leaving the two remaining apes under the observation of two scientists, Stephanie and Lewis. Both discover the apes' power of speech. The apes then are brought before the Presidential Commission, where they reveal publicly their ability to speak, and are welcomed as guests.

  The apes at first become celebrities, but they are soon watched by a scientist, futuristic consutlant Dr. Otto Hasslein (Eric Braeden), who discovers Zira is pregnant and fears for the future of the human race. He is determined to force the issue, gets Zira drunk to get information out of her, and convinces the Commission to have the apes taken for proper questioning. Both are questioned under numerous means, and Hasslein learns for himself how the human race will eventually meet its downfall and be dominated by simians, and will eventually lead to Earth's destruction.

  The government and the U.S. President order that the unborn child's birth be ""prevented"" and that both be sterilized, though Hasslein prefers they die. But after the ape Cornelius kills and orderly while imprisoned (the orderly teased Zira), Hasslein uses it as an illustration of the future danger the apes present, thus calling for the apes' murder. Running for their lives, Cornelius and Zira (assisted by Stephanie and Lewis) find shelter in a circus run by Armando (Ricardo Montalban), and there Zira gives birth to a son whom she names Milo.

  Hasslein, knowing Zira will imminently give birth, orders a search of all circuses and zoos. As a result, Armando must let the apes go. The drama climaxes aboard a derelict ship in an abandoned shipyard. Hasslein tracks the apes down. He shoots down both Zira and the infant ape she carries. Cornelius and Hasslein end up in a shootout. Cornelius kills Hasslein, and in retaliation a police officer returns fire and shoots Cornelius in the heart. Stephanie and Lewis watch in horror as Cornelius gasps a final breath before falling three stories. Then Zira tosses the baby over the side of the ship before crawling to lay with her husband.

  The survivors, however, are unaware of the real fate of the infant ape; Cornelius, Zira, and Armando switched babies before their final escape. Armando now watches over the infant Milo, who will grow up to become Caesar, the main character in the third and fourth sequels, ""CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES"" and ""BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES"". The film ends by showing the baby Milo sitting in a cage, plaintively speaking the words ""Mama? Mama?"" with the voice of a human child.

  Trivia: (1)The ending of this film was purposefully written so that the writers would have something to work with, in case Fox wanted another sequel.(2)This movie marks the first appearance of Dr. Otto Hasslein. The character was referred to in both previous ""PLANET OF THE APES"" movies, but was never seen until this film.",944006400,,3944,4.945454545454545
3597769,4,B001G7Q15O,"This is the obvious choice for best sequel because of the brilliant plot.  It does get a little cheesy (the ape's flourescent-orange blood, the caged gorilla in the zoo, ""because I loathe bannana's!"", etc.), but  what it lacks in visual taste, it more than makes-up-for in  acting and  plot.  Sal Mineo is excellent in his last film.  The substance from the  first installment is not lost in this sequel.
P.S.  Seeing the apes in  astronaut gear is kinda funny.",931996800,,461,4.734177215189874
3597770,4,B001G7Q15O,Of all the Planet of the Apes movies; this had to be the one that really brought a tear to my eye. Roddy MacDowell and Kim Hunter are excellent as the innocent explorers who are misunderstood by modern human about the  world that come from.  Great cameo by Ricardo Montelban and wonderful  surprise ending.,930873600,,306,4.62962962962963
3597771,2,B001G7Q15O,"I LOVE the Planet of the Apes movies, but this one was poor indeed.  It was far too friendly of a movie, they made it with children in mind, and not the real fans.  I wished for this movie to end soon after it began, it  brings shame to this great series... but what can you expect once they got  rid of Heston?  I would recommend this movie to people who want to see the  entire series... but that's all.  Definitely the worst of the saga.",929750400,,440,4.046511627906977
3597772,4,B001G7Q15O,"I tought this was the funniest Apes movie. It took alot to come up with this idea,two years to be exact,compared with less than a year with the next two films. I thought what it lacked in action it made up for in  humor. This is also the last film with Kim Hunter,as Zera,in it.",928627200,,278,4.054545454545455
8304339,5,B001G7Q15O,"Interesting premise from the start with apes ruling the planet Earth eventually after man has demolished it with nuclear weapons, with the first two episodes involving two separate astronauts that are making this discovery under different circumstances. This, however, picks up where the second one left off at the demolishing of Earth entirely, and the apes escaping just before the ""doomsday bomb"" annihilates.
The impact of the demolish forces them to travel back into time and land just after the first astronaut took off. It is here that the smart ape offspring is implanted that actually starts the whole ape takeover made possible. Very emotional, well thought out of political and religious implications, and I just can't get enough to those lovable apes under that fancy garb. Total realism.",1520294400,,800,5.209302325581396
