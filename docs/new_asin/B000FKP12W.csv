8124015,5,B000FKP12W,"Documentaries on the antisemitic history of the The Protocols of the Elders of Zion proved difficult to find. I felt like this one was quite pricey, but given that there were few options I took a chance on it. I would have been much happier paying $20 instead of $40 but was pleased with the quality of the information and the detail provided. Not bad for a History Channel documentary. Glad I purchased it.",1365120000,,407,4.513513513513513
