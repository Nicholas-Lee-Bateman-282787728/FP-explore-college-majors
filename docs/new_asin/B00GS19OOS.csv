6105859,5,B00GS19OOS,"I have ready every chapter available of the manga and when the anime came out it did not disappoint. Although they left one or two things a little open ended (especially if u know what happens in the manga). But all in all i was hooked from the get go. Each character was perfectly represented and the love story is kick ass. plus theres enough humor in there to keep you smiling through the whole thing. Hands down one of my all time favorites. And if you don't fall head over heels for Tomoe, well then theres something wrong with you.",1389312000,9,537,4.326732673267327
6105860,4,B00GS19OOS,"This is a really great anime and now I'm interested in starting the manga and while I would really like to buy this when it becomes availabe...this is an absolutely ridiculous price for anime that only contains 13 episodes!

And while it is DVD AND Blu-Ray that is still a really high price for, again, an anime that contains thirteen episodes.  (That's another thing!  I wish there had been more than thirteen episodes!  Wahh!)

When the price drops maybe then I'll buy it but I'm not spending $50 bucks when I can still watch it on Hulu.",1389225600,16,539,4.515463917525773
6105861,5,B00GS19OOS,"I've already watched this online, but I have to get it when it is released, because it is much better than the usual shojo anime. The American title is a misnomer, since the story is more about roles than about kissy stuff. The Japanese title is Kamisama Hajimemashita (Having Begun to Be a God), which is more apt.

Yes, there is a lot of romantic tension, but it is a story of a girl in over her head trying to live up to the role of a land kami, while following her own heart. It is the story of an arrogant yokai forced to serve a girl, whom he knows is much less capable than he is, trying to be both an obedient servant and a strong protector. What makes the series interesting is watching them sort out (often comically) who should take the lead in what situation. That they have fallen in love and can't admit it, because as human and yokai and as mistress and servant they aren't supposed to, just makes their story more touching.",1386720000,64,939,4.275280898876405

6105879,5,B00GS19OOS,"I absolutely love this series. I've been following the manga, and I'm happy to say that the tv show does it justice. Be aware that even though it says its the complete series, it isn't. This is only season one. The show originally only had one season, but ended up making a second season later (I assume because of popular demand).

I don't want to spoil it, so I'll just say this: Its a coming of age / romance story, with a hefty serving of Japanese mythology and fantasy. Sometimes its poignant, and sometimes its humorous. The characters are endearing and complex, and the artwork is beautiful.",1468108800,2,598,4.588785046728972

Faithful to the manga but moves very fast through the various plots.  At 13 episodes it feels over to quick.  Only reason I gave it four stars.  Still well worth the watch.

6105936,5,B00GS19OOS,"I bought this one for my niece who's newly discovered anime. I like this one because it's intelligent, crazy and engaging in a lot of different ways. I've found girl's television in the US to be devoid of any sort of intelligence and I think that American cartoon companies don't realize how advanced girls are. This isn't something that's dumbed down, and I really like that.

Keeping it short is a good thing. The 12/13 episode season keeps the focus on the characters and their budding love story and there's not a lot of fluff/filler. The thing that really drove home how good it is was that my mother, who's 62, asked me when we were going to watch the next episode because she wanted to watch it, too. I know it went over well because she's asking me when the next season comes out. This is a gem for all ages.",1432166400,3,816,4.368421052631579

It doesn't follow the manga, which is detrimental in this particular case since it feels off the way the anime writers did it.  However, if the price is right, try it out, it is fun and enjoyable.",1420588800,,352,4.147058823529412

6105964,5,B00GS19OOS,"I bought this for my sister, who watched it with me when it arrived. I was hooked on episode one. I love the charm of the characters, and -odd though it may come across- I adore the way Tomoe is so angry at being under Nanami's service.  The show made me laugh as hard as Fruits Basket and Ouran High School Host Club, and the latter had me laughing through all but the last two episodes, roughly. This did the same thing, though I still laughed some in the final episodes ans the comedy is not excluded completely.

I love the voice acting in this, and especially adore Tomore, as I am a fan of Tatum.

I have barely heard of the series through my sister, so I have not yet read the manga to compare to the anime, but I do adore this show.

The bottom line of this show is that it is filled with laughter, some heartbreak -that adds to the sweet story-, love, plenty of attractive men -starting with Mikage, quickly followed by Tomoe-  And, of course, the struggle to find a life in the new world left to you.

It is, in my opinion, a heartwarming story of love and laughter that -as the typical saying goes- belongs in any anime collection. I can also personally promise that if you like Fruits Basket, you will like Kamisama Kiss, for it posesses all the same pricipals as Fruits Basket, right down to a Yuki-Kyo style rivalry.",1413763200,,1330,4.3

6105973,5,B00GS19OOS,"UPDATE:SECOND SEASON COMING OUT 2015!!!
I am not a fan of shoujo, HOWEVER, I enjoyed the manga for Kamisama Kiss SO MUCH that I even bought the anime!! While the show is short and does finish completely different to what fans of the manga would expect being that it is still ongoing, I enjoyed this IMMENSELY. I even liked the dub!!! That is a very hard thing for me to like, and Funimation brought in a SUPERB English cast. However, it cannot trump the amazing Japanese cast:) Tomoe's VA has seriously one of the sexiest voices in Japan.

The story has a strong female lead who I have a lot of respect for. Granted she does let her emotions pop up as it is shoujo, but she never annoyed me. If you are a fan of bishies, Japanese folklore, great characters, and beautiful animation, I highly recommend you try Kamisama Kiss.

Though to be honest, the manga truly outshines the anime near the anime's ending, because it made its own spin to nicely end it. Tomoe's VERY dark past is never really explored because that all happens in the manga. I would say read the manga if you want, but if you are considering the anime, it certainly is worth your time and money. Though it does end pretty fast, and doesn't have as much action, plot and romance as the manga. Truly, it's a doki-doki worthy series. <3",1406332800,9,1300,4.435146443514644
6105974,5,B00GS19OOS,"I fell in love with the series. A perfect mix of forbidden love, action, adventure and that humor that makes it worth watching",1405468800,,126,4.521739130434782

6105976,5,B00GS19OOS,"If you are looking for excellent artwork, charming characters and a memorable, sweet story, this is your best choice.  Easily one of my favorites, I've loved both the manga and the anime.  The anime follows the manga's story line very closely and only diverges in the last episode in order to round things out and complete that arch.  I hope that one day they decide to give us a sequel series, because there are lots more chapters in the manga, but if they don't, really consider reading the manga.  It's so worth it!

As for the english dub, Tia Ballard is a perfectly acceptable Nanami, but J. Michael Tatum (Tomoe), while he is a wonderfully talented actor with a wide variety to his voice acting, sounds eerily like 'Sebastian' from Black Butler in this.  I'm not sure that simpering tone works as well for Tomoe and I found myself wishing he'd used one of his gruffer voices for the character.  The other choices of voice actor all worked pretty well, but if you really like this series, try listening to the subtitled versions (also on the dvd) and see what I mean about Tomoe's voice.  It's worth a listen.",1401753600,8,1114,4.562814070351759
6105977,5,B00GS19OOS,"Mikage a shrine land god wants out of it, and one day while in the park he meets recently evicted from her home and now homeless Nanami they talk and he offers to let her live in his house, Nanami however is unaware that because of the kiss he gave her she is also a land god. At the shrine she meets Tomoe the handsome fox youkai who at first is none to thrilled with the new arrangement, they end up bickering and it is totally hilarious. There are some great action martial arts fight scenes between Tomoe and others. Other characters include

Kurama a tengu crow demon aka fallen angel

Kurama is red haired gray eyed highly charismatic hotter then hell school heart throb, internationally famous singing star and Tengu crow demon who passes off as a fallen angel Kurama is a challenge for Tomoe, Kurama is after Nanami's godhood but there's a glitch in his plan and a hilarious event takes place. Eventually previously and seemingly uninterested Tomoe starts showing his possessive and jealous side

Mizuki a snake deity and a water gods familiar

Add to the mix Mizuki a white haired green eyed kind caring and very lonely snake deitywho meets Nanami in the oddest way then later on kidnaps her, fuming and very territorial Tomoe searches for her, Mizuki wants Nanami to be his. This group of characters and the plot make a wonderful and highly enjoyable series full of comedy, romance, action, and some drama, it is one of the most comical heartwarming anime's out there. If you haven't seen it yet it is well worth a watch

Recommendation for another funny romantic fox meets girl anime

I love anime foxes and if you do then check out an anime that would go great with this one called [ Inu X Bocu Secret Service ] the lead male character Soushi he is a fox like Tomoe only he has 9 tails and is beautiful in kitsune form. The plot to it is Soushi is a secret service agent working in an apartment building made and built for descendants of humans and various supernatural beings, he is assigned to Ririchiyo a fiery amythyst color eyed beauty with long flowing black hair, it is totally hilarious from start to finish",1401062400,,2127,4.54046997389034

6105980,4,B00GS19OOS,"I enjoyed Kamisama because of its on the spiritual realm versus a regular world setting. Several of its high points revolved around the different interactions between being a landgod(guardian of the temple) and continued life as a normal teenage girl.
  Although it is different from the manga I highly recommend it for anyone looking for something to warm your heart. Also it can be pretty darn hilarious.",1396656000,,406,5.044776119402985

That's so you will read the book(s). But I absolutely love this anime and it's manga counterpart! The only question I have is what is with the narrator?

They really should continue this series as the manga has more to offer...though I think it may be coming to a close from recent chapters, anyways it would be awesome to see it animated as well.

This anime really sticks close to the manga and I love that. Now a few things here and there were added but I can see them doing that because they were only making one season. Hopefully if sales go well they'll decide to make a second season, here's to hoping!",1389312000,5,593,4.05982905982906
