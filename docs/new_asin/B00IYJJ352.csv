8646364,5,B00IYJJ352,An interesting documentary on this formidable and fascinating lizard.  (The cover picture of this documentary puzzled us somewhat.  The Kimodo dragon has his head tilted in an almost Disney expression).  Anyone interested in these creatures would enjoy this look at a most ancient reptile and the facts as presented by a biologist.  Very good and recommended.,1457913600,3,359,5.357142857142857
