Whoever said this is reminiscent of a Ray Harryhausen film has apparently never seen a Ray Harryhausen film.
I'm a big fan of all of the tales in the 1001 Nights, and it makes me sad that we can't get a good movie series. This fails on every level possible.
Just because you CAN make a movie, doesn't mean you SHOULD make a movie. This is on par with the terrible crap Asylum puts out. Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe my feelings for this sad film.",1412553600,,611,4.368421052631579
8212829,2,B000UBS48Y,"I had ordered this on the artwork as I fell for the Imhotep (Mummy) look-alike and the possibility of an under the radar indie hit. As I played this in the store various customers had the same idea as they thought it was an Arnold Vosloo film and immediately became interested (it is not him).

The story centers on a man suffering through the tribulations of saving his love from some kind of shape-shifting demon. He is helped along by some angels and seers, but the muddling of storyline, fast cuts and blends made people lose interest each time something started to look good. The CGI is decent at times but looks like a cartoon during some of the ""dream"" sequences. The angry/deep voice over of the demon would attract people's attention, but then the lips stopped matching the words too many times and people would then skip it. The overall feel of the pacing was tedious and confusing as to what was happening at various times.

Technically, the amount of cast/crew sand prints magically appearing/disappearing throughout all of the desert shots, power poles in the background, etc. distracted attention at all of the wrong times. There is a short how to make a film docu that breezes through how ""easy"" it is to make an indie film and a trailer to supplement the DVD.

I noticed the 5-star review here is from the film's publicist, but I do wish them well in making some more fairy tale films.",1233792000,6,1401,4.618473895582329
8212830,5,B000UBS48Y,"DJINN is a fantastic story, reminiscent of the Ray Harryhausen SINBAD movies. The special effects and music made the film.  It's a very enjoyable film for all to see.",1231804800,,166,4.724137931034483
