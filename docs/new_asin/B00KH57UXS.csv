6426430,5,B00KH57UXS,"I love Adventure Time! I love the cover (Marceline is my favorite character)! This is so cool, I even like the story about how they write music!",1412640000,,144,4.37037037037037
6426431,5,B00KH57UXS,"Adventure time is easily one of the best shows (if not the best) on Cartoon Network. I'm in high school, and this show still manages to make me laugh in every episode. The show's creativity and depth is quite simply amazing to those people (including me) used to simple plot and characters in most cartoons. It's so sad to see people like the person in the one star review dismiss Adventure Time as a dumb kid's show when it is so so good. Anyway, the point is this show deserves a 5 star rating so please do just that!",1407715200,5,519,4.252525252525253
6426432,5,B00KH57UXS,Love this show. But wish they'd release the Flapjack series,1405641600,5,59,5.0
6426433,5,B00KH57UXS,"I agree with the other two reviewers before me 100%. The only thing that I could possibly add is the fact that Season 4 isn't the best season of Adventure Time because season 5 was powerful and contained an almost overwhelming amount of information, silliness and character development. Season 4 was absolutely outstanding. Don't get me wrong, but everything that comes from this show is better than the last. Everywhere from the comic books and graphic novels to the actual episodes. Even FanFiction for this show has very well written stories. Having said all of that... Adventure Time is awesome and Season 4 with be mathematical!",1405123200,12,633,4.981132075471698
6426434,5,B00KH57UXS,"Very few shows have been more consistent than Adventure Time's current run. Besides its unique colorful silliness, the fourth season continues the show's childlike creativity and surprisingly astute storytelling ability. If judged only by the latter, then this is easily the best season of them all. Like The Lego Movie, people of all ages can genuinely enjoy this show despite its youthful outer shell.

By far, the emotional depth covered in many of the episodes trounces that of any other animated show. It's hard to believe for those who've never watched Adventure Time, but it's not even close. One such episode that exemplifies this is ""I Remember You"", typically hailed as the best of the entire series. It sounds crazy, but it could be the most heartfelt 11 minutes of animation you may see for a long while, and you won't even know what hit you. There's a reason why so many television critics - some who don't even watch cartoons - applaud this episode; I can only recommend that you watch it for yourself.

""Princess Cookie"", another season 4 episode, is a personal favorite of mine. To start, it's simply one of the show's funniest episodes. But it's also deceptively amazing with its simple premise, and it highlights a recurring characteristic you may find in every episode. Hidden behind the premise and trademark humor is a giant emotional layer. Much of Adventure Time is rewarding in that sense. Give this show a try, and you'll be glad you gave it a chance.",1404172800,23,1476,4.830039525691699
6426435,5,B00KH57UXS,"Sometimes, a show will start out one way, and then begin to change for the better. An excellent example of this is ""Adventure Time"". The show began as a quirky story about a boy and his dog living in a magical post-apocalyptic wasteland. As the series progressed, the focus shifted from non-sequitor  humor to character development. No where is this more on display than this season. Without a shadow of a doubt, the fourth season of ""Adventure Time"" is my favorite year of this series.

The season begins where the third left off: the introduction of Flame Princess. From there, the first half is your standard AT fare (we get the introduction of the Graybles, but other than that, these next few episodes are mostly OK). Then, starting with the Nightosphere two-parter and then really clicking into gear with ""Gotcha"", the season starts to examine the lives of B-list characters, like Lumpy Space Princess (""Gotcha!""), Magic Man (""Sons of Mars""), BMO (""BMO Noire""), and Lemongrab (""You Made Me!"")

In the last 12 or so episodes, some of the all-time best episodes were made. In ""Sons of Mars"", Finn journeys to Mars to meet Abraham Lincoln and stop Magic Man's nefarious plot. ""Gotcha!"" is arguably the single greatest Lumpy Space Princess episode ever made, wherein she becomes Finn and Jake's adventure secretary. Ricardio returns in ""Lady & Peebles"" and we get to see PB be a total badass. Gunter goes bananas in ""Reign of Gunters, and finally, Lemongrab returns for ""You Made Me!"" and we get to see why he ticks. The last one in particular is sad-but-happy episode that I feel encapsulates the very essence of the series.

And then there's ""I Remember You"", the season's penultimate episode. When I first started watching the series, I NEVER knew it would have been able to hit the emotional notes that this episode manages. I shan't spoil the plot (those of you who have seen it know what goes on, and those of you who haven't are in for a treat), but I will say that it is probably the show's finest episode, and a testament to Rebecca Sugar and Cole Sanchez's storyboarding abilities.

And then there's ""The Lich"", featuring the return of the titular villain. It's a fantastic way to end a fantastic season, bleeding right into the magnificent season 5.

I assume the extras will included DVD commentary on all the episodes, as Jesse Moynihan (a storyboard artist for the show) seemed to confirm this on his Twitter awhile back. As for the rest, I guess we'll just have to wait and see!

All-in-all, this season is amazing. If you are an ""Adventure Time"" fan, I urge you to pick up this DVD and support the brand. And since Amazon can be kinda bad about posting what episodes are contained on this disc, here's the 'track listing' (anything marked with an asterisk is just a personal favorite of mine. Be warned, as about half the season could be counted among my personal favorites!):

6426446,5,B00KH57UXS,My girlfriend loves this show so I keep getting her all the seasons as gifts. I really like the packaging for this. The girls hair on the outside is a cardboard sleeve that slides off which is well thought out. Fair price for a good number of episodes.,1485216000,,252,4.270833333333333
6426447,2,B00KH57UXS,Alil disapointed because i bought season 1 thru 5 and all of them had sleeves but not season 4 probably missin or idk but besides tht im satisfied,1483574400,,146,4.25
6426448,5,B00KH57UXS,That episode where Marceline and Ice King are playing music together is worth the purchasing the entire season alone,1482624000,,116,5.157894736842105

6426450,5,B00KH57UXS,"I love Adventure Time; the series just seems to keep getting better and better!

The only problem I had was a minor one. The case sleeve that comes with the DVD wasn't on the package, it was just the DVD. Not worth taking a star off it though, but I can see how a collector might be irritated.",1480118400,,293,4.051724137931035

6426453,5,B00KH57UXS,"Personally this is hands down my favorite season of Adventure Time.  This is mainly due to the beautiful, tragic & heart-tugging episode ""I Remember You""  which is probably the most well executed allagory of dealing with losing someone you care about to Alzhaimers.  It is a serious issue brought up in an entertaining & respectful way in an episode that will have you laughing and crying, sometimes at the same time.",1474934400,,417,4.845070422535211

6426462,4,B00KH57UXS,I love the show and this blu-ray/season especially because it includes extras about the music but for other things like the commentaries it is very disappointing and continues down hill as with the previous season/blu-rays and would make me question weather or not to purchase future seasons on blu-ray.,1456531200,,303,5.204081632653061

6426467,5,B00KH57UXS,"I'm in love with this cartoon series and one thing I love is that every season seems to be crazier than the last. I can't make up my mind if I'd recommend watching it with kids or not. I mean for me I'd be fine with it but I could see where some parents wouldn't be okay with that. I love the adult humor in this show but at the same time it takes me back to being a kid and watching cartoons on a Saturday morning. I love the colors, the characters and just the world that they live in. It's just overall a really fun show to watch and this season has me laughing constantly.",1451347200,,576,3.9316239316239314

6426480,5,B00KH57UXS,"I am a big ""Adventure Time"" fan (thanks to my son for getting me hooked) and was glad when this came out for purchase.  It's great that Cartoon Network is almost caught up with the recent release of season 5 by the way!  It's a great way to binge watch AT because it seems that Cartoon Network only cares about Uncle Grandpa and Teen Titans Go these days.  I feel like they don't care about Adventure Time anymore, which is a shame because it's light and funny enough for younger kids to watch but has enough deep, dark things that older kids and adults can pick up so they can enjoy it as well. I recently viewed a You Tube video counting down the best recent cartoons and Adventure Time was number one!  So as for this DVD set, I don't really care if it has bonus content or not. I just care about the episodes and now that I own them to watch any time I want to, I will do just that.",1439596800,,886,4.074712643678161

6426483,5,B00KH57UXS,"Pop culture has certainly gotten unusual.  Think of it: the most compelling, interesting (and tragic) characters around are all in cartoons: a skinny one-legged teenage Viking who's taught himself how to ride dragons; a hyper-depressed Scandinavian princess with magic powers who locks herself in a prison made of solid ice because she's terrified of herself; a reckless strong-headed 12-year-old boy with a silly hat who lives 2,000 years in the future after our world has been destroyed, whose best friend (and adoptive brother)  is a magical talking dog, and who is in love with a princess made of candy and a princess made of fire.  And I'm completely serious, these are easily the most deep, emotionally fascinating creatures in pop culture.  Get out of my office, Don Draper.  You too, Lena Dunham.

And then of course there's Marceline the Vampire Queen.  Yessir, folks, the most profound and tragic character on TV is a 1,000-year-old floating teenage vampire who plays a bass guitar made out of an ancient battle axe.  That's right, you heard me.

Buy this brilliant set just for the heart-rending episode ""I Remember You.""  And keep your box of tissues close to hand.",1437696000,,1177,4.98974358974359

I am tired of having to get like 3 volumes before getting the actual season, so I suggest waiting for DVD's like this to come out at least if you can wait because it takes a while for these to come out. A lot of interesting and fun adventure happen in this season. The worst part of this season is that it ends in a cliff hanger and now you have to wait for the 5th season to come out or get the Finn the Human DVD volume that contains the 3 part episode.",1429056000,,541,3.8828828828828827

The only episodes I hadn't seen from this season, checking out the dvd, were the green penguins, ricardio's return, and the nitosphere. They were all great episodes and lived up to what I had already seen. I especially liked Nitosphere but they were all brilliant (loved the Heironymous Bosch take).

This even had the great Ice King/Marcelene duet, which I love. My feelings about this show are superfluous, it's one of the best ever. If you haven't seen the episodes yet then stop thinking and get it. Cannot wait for season 5, I bet that's going to be a huge deal when they release that.

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

Once in a long while or two, something comes along that's a piece of lifes puzzle. That piece exponentially helps you find the next. Adventure Time is it.

I can't tell you how many times I watched it for a minute or two only to switch to something more comfortable Regular Time, Murdoch Mysteries, etc. I finally looked it up on Wikipedia, I was dumbfounded that a fairly intelligent (needs clarified) person as myself missed this gem for so long!

Adventure Time is like a child growing up. Everyday something is learned, lost, amended and cherished until that one moment that it all comes together, that voil moment! It might take you 15 episodes or 3 or whatever, but it will come.

I could go on for hours (people my age, 62 tend to do that) about Adventure Time but alas, you are busy and I need to place my Season 4 Blu Ray (don't ever settle for DVD in cartoons if BR is available) in my player, select my 60 Plasma and 5.1 sound and go to a place of magic!

What are you waiting for?",1413331200,6,1055,4.276381909547739

8658635,3,B00KH57UXS,"Not happy. I ordered this as a gift and it arrived the day before the party missing the cover case. This may not seem like a big deal, but there's an effect that happens when you slide off the cover. Plus it would not match his other seasons without it. I have ordered a replacement and will edit my review when I get it. Given 2 stars for right product, but missing pieces.

After replacement arrived:
Everything was there this time, but because it was wrapped in plastic the edges were bent. All-in-all, my younger brother loved it. Just wish it would have come in right the first time.",1490313600,,588,4.394495412844036
