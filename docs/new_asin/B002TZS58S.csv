3986670,5,B002TZS58S,"I was very surprised at Hilarys acting ability in this film, she was VERY good. Like someone said before me, this is her best film. I can't believe this wasn't released in theaters, with some promotion I think it could of been a moderate hit. I'm going to buy it so I can watch it again.",1264636800,,287,4.142857142857143
3986671,5,B002TZS58S,"I should probably start off by saying that I am a HUGE Hilary Duff fan but I also like to think of myself as a person who is really good at giving unbiased opinions. I understand that movie critics do not think very highly of Hilary and I can understand that since the movies she has done have kept her in the ""tween category"" (even though I really like those movies because they make me happy). ""According to Greta"" is one of the many slew of movies that Hilary has been a part of lately to help move her more in a direction of a young adult actress (others including ""War Inc.,"" ""What Goes Up,"" and her guest appearance on ""Gossip Girl"") and this is by far her best acting display. She is very believable as the rebellious, super sarcastic and suicidal teenager forced to stay with her grandparents for the summer. I have to say that I also enjoyed all of the side characters just as much in this film. Her grandmother, grandfather and boy interest were well played and allowed the film to seem very real.

It is unfortunate that it took SO long for this movie to come out (I believe filming finished in late 2007) and when it came out in theaters it was only in L.A. For this reason I encourage everyone to buy or rent this because it truly is a great film. It is an indie, low budget film but it is still very enjoyable. I'm very happy for Hilary, she is still young and can still go far places with her acting career. I wouldn't say this is her big break but it is definitely a huge leap in the right direction for her.",1263254400,6,1524,4.219178082191781
3986672,5,B002TZS58S,"Just saw this film at its Santa Monica, California, premiere.  It is truly a shame that the movie is not being distributed in theatres and instead is going direct to DVD & Blu-Ray.  I hope the DVD contains some extras, especially a commentary, all of which were sadly lacking on the DVDs for Hilary Duff's earlier small, independent films of ""War, Inc."" and ""What Goes Up.""

For those who have doubted Hilary Duff's dramatic talent up until now, ""According to Greta"" should put those fears to rest.  Duff turns in an unquestionably strong performance of a complicated character that will come as a surprise to those primarily familiar with her more tween/teen-oriented work such as the ""Lizzie McGuire"" TV series, ""A Cinderella Story,"" and the ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" films.  What the audience has borne witness to here is her genuine maturity as an actress and the possible paradigm shift in her career to more serious dramatic fare in the future.

Duff plays the title character of Greta, a 17 year old girl who has been ""exiled"" to her grandparents' home in New Jersey for the summer, given her mother's own inability to control her daughter and preference for saving her troubled marriage.  Greta has decided to end her life once she turns 18, currently reflecting upon which method of death would be most desirable.  Simultaneously, she has created a ""bucket list"" of sorts of things to experience in the final year of her life.  The news of Greta's plans come as a surprise to her grandparents, especially her grandmother, played by veteran actress Ellen Burstyn.  The Golden Globe- and Oscar-nominated Burstyn turns in a fine performance as Greta's ""Grammy"" Katherine, who is determined to give her granddaughter structure and discipline, and perhaps even aide in finding value in life.

Another surprise performance is given by actor Evan Ross, who plays Julie, a restaurant line cook with a shady past, who is committed to living as responsible and ethical a life as possible.  Next to Duff's substantive performance, Ross' own poised and balanced performance will likely be a highlight of the film for viewers.  In the movie, Greta and Julie become co-workers and eventually strike up a romance, one that comes off naturally, even in scenes of interpersonal character unease.  But Greta's hardened attitude about life, her sharp hurtful words, and manipulative actions towards Julie, as well as her grandparents, threaten to drive those closest to Greta away, even as they all labor to help her see life's gifts.

Standing behind inter-relational tensions, is a haunting secret from the past.  Will the recognition of this painful experience finally push Greta to take her life?  Or can her grandparents and Julie -- or more pointedly, can she herself -- help transform her great pains into a realization for the sanctity of life?  Check out the movie and find out for yourself.",1261094400,27,2887,4.979166666666667
3986673,4,B002TZS58S,"Similar to 2007's Georgia Rule and what will be 2010's The Last Song, 'According to Greta' starring Hilary Duff is another drama featuring the plot of a rebellious daughter sent away to live with family. Unlike the other two, this film more-so tackles teen suicide. Duff plays the title role of Greta, a rebellious and free spirited teenager who is sent to live with her grandparents for the summer. The thing with Greta is, she's contemplating suicide. Hilary Duff gives what is arguably the best performance of her career thus far in this bittersweet drama of love, loss and the meaning of family. A definite recommend for those who enjoyed Lindsay Lohan's 'Georgia Rule'.",1259884800,,674,4.921052631578948

3986693,2,B002TZS58S,"Boo!  Hilary Duff plays a character who, by turns, is disrespectful, spoiled, belligerent, insensitive and impossible WITHOUT any underlying projection of context so that we can empathize with her road to self-ruin.  We don't learn until too late in the film why she might be this way.  Her mother is simplistically condemning, her step father clueless and her erstwhile boyfriend the only character worth saving.  Of course, I will never fault a single performance by Ellen Burstyn who is, as always, excellent in this role with very little to work with.  Otherwise, I would say, there is enough teenage angst films out there that are good to spend anytime watching this one.",1407542400,,676,5.0

As an independent film I feel it was too obvious, it needed to rely more on the audience drawing their own conclusions. It doesn't leave anything open to interpretation really. Especially the end, it should've ended with the book underwater with the converse scene, leaving the audience to determine her fate. But I understand wanting to give teens, the main audience for this movie, a positive outlook, serving as a suicide prevention tool.",1406160000,,577,4.958762886597938

3986702,4,B002TZS58S,"When I first read about this movie, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Like any kid from the early 2000s, I fell head over heels for Hilary Duff as Lizzie McGuire and then became mesmerized by her albums. When I read that she plays a suicidal teenager in an indie film, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Duff has played teens for a decent part of her life, but never one who was as serious as this character.
Overall, I was really surprised by how much I fell in love with this movie. The story is well-developed, though not particularly unique and interesting. However, what makes the whole movie unique is the characters and their development. Greta has many levels of emotion to her, all of which are revealed throughout the movie. Julie is an ex-rebel who had cleaned his act up. And Greta's grandparents are simple and sweet, and it seems a wonder in the beginning that they can handle having Greta around.
Though it may seem like it could be a little slow, this movie moves at a really good pace and advances the characters pretty quickly.
I really do have to praise the acting in this movie, which I thought was fantastic. Veteran actress Ellen Burstyn, who plays Greta's grandmother, does a fantastic job and is easily able to switch emotions and feelings throughout the movie. Evan Ross, who plays Julie, did not bring as much darkness to his character as I think it calls for, but he does an amazing overall job. Michael Murphy, Greta's grandfather, does a perfect job of creating a character who stands calm and collected next to Ellen Burstyn's own character. And finally, Hilary Duff really kills it in this role. She shows a lot of depth and seriousness in a role which feels much more adult than her other roles. I hope she develops her more adult roles more in the future, because I think she was stellar in this movie.
The only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is that the end didn't feel finite or complete enough. It is definitely worth watching the movie, but the end didn't exactly hit me as amazing.
Overall, I really recommend this movie, if anything because of Hilary. :)",1384819200,,2105,4.542105263157895

3986720,3,B002TZS58S,"It's very hard for me to watch movies where teenagers treat their grandparents (or parents or elders) with such disrespect. My grandmother, who was my most favorite person in the world, died when I was only 18 and there was so much I hadn't yet learned from her. Visiting her was always my favorite day of the week and I hate to see teenagers on TV wasting away that time. On the other hand, sometimes it bothers me even more when it is someone my current age in a movie who STILL has their grandparents and does not appreciate it. I guess maybe I can understand if the kid grew up with their grandparents far away and never got a chance to know them. But still, it irritates me when teenagers act like all adults are idiots. It doesn't take much of a brain to realize that the longer you use your brain, the more of a brain you will have. Hence, age usually equals wisdom. It doesn't always equal maturity, but oh well.

I like Hilary Duff. I even used to watch her on Lizzie McGuire periodically, even though I was a bit too old for that show. I've been pleased recently to see her expanding her horizons. I thought she did an excellent job in this movie as Greta, even though it was hard to see her playing such a mean character. After getting to know Greta (a not very subtle acronym for ""Great,"" she tells us), you could understand what she was going through and sympathize. She had a hard life, was not always treated well or raised well, and acted out based on what she knew. I don't want to give the ending away, but she started to pull herself together, and while she may always be the type with a bit of a rebellious streak, I think there is a lot of hope for Greta.",1330819200,,1676,4.2375

3986723,5,B002TZS58S,"(Spoiler-free)
I literally JUST finished watching this movie. The credits are rolling.
I had to write the review as soon as possible.

I see that on here, ACCORDING TO GRETA has some negative reviews. Quite a few, in fact. From what I've seen (because I wanted to do my homework), most of the issues are that the character is too dark or because this movie isn't very good for our kids. Some say Hilary is too old for the part, and some say the character herself is very unrealistic. Finally, some say that the acting wasn't very good. Listen to my take on this.

AN OVERVIEW: Greta is a troubled seventeen-year-old who is sent by her mother to live with her grandparents because her attitude is affecting her mother's marriage. She has a notebook she carries around everywhere which is basically a bucket list of things to do before she kills herself (This is revealed in the first five minutes of the movie and is not a spoiler). Then she meets a guy (and listen to me when I say that the guy isn't even the point... this is not a boy meets girl love story; in fact, he's only used as a tool to bring some messages and revelations across). I won't say anything else.

THE ACTING: I have to clarify this very instant that I started this movie with an open mind, which is how it is supposed to be watched. Let me make it clear that Hilary Duff's acting is good. There are no 'but's. I find the people who claim that it was poor representation or that the character herself is unrealistic, mistaken, as GRETA reminded me of a friend of mine who is very similar to her (although not suicidal). Hilary portrayed the character VERY well, and I did not think she looked too old to be seventeen, as I am seventeen myself and can say this confidently. Be patient with the movie (not that it required much of it from me), and you will find that the acting is actually more realistic than in most movies, which is why it comes across as unique. Hilary reminded me a little of Kristen Stewart from 'Welcome to the Rileys', although GRETA was released before that. Which actress is better? That is up to you to decide.
And speaking of 'Welcome to the Rileys', Melissa Leo is also in this movie.

THE POINT: ACCORDING TO GRETA should be one of those movies that every single teenager in the world must see, as it has lots of morals in it, and does not at all come across as trying hard to show them. Not in the slightest, actually. This is NOT a chick flick. This is NOT a love story. This is a movie about growing up and should be treated as a mature movie. FORGET about any other movies any of the actors have done; treat this movie as something different from the moment you pop it in. I guarantee you will enjoy it.

AUDIENCE: Who this movie is for? O.K., this is VERY IMPORTANT: The movie is rated PG-13. I, however, would advise that the movie should not be shown to anyone below the age of 15. Because just when you think you can keep up with the tone it has set, you find out some VERY dark and VERY deep and disturbing stories. I Loved it because it gave the movie maturity that flowed easily and made it look nonchalant.

ACCORDING TO GRETA really is something special, and I honestly can't wait until I share it with my friends. And I'm a guy. That's saying something.

Five stars. There is nothing I would change. There are a lot of deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and a Behind-The-Scenes featurette, so enjoy.

Take my word for it, people: It's great. Just approach it with an open mind.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1318723200,6,3532,4.33939393939394

While the title character is considerably darker than the usual Hillary Duff role, Duff does a respectable job showing a lot of teenage angst. The weakness of this movie is less the casting than the characters themselves and their story, which follow well worn conventions. We have the angsty teenager who tries to be bad, meeting the boy from the wrong side of town and finding love and hope in their relationship. Their relationship generates much of the usual cultural conflict situations have become so predictable. The only thing that redeems this movie is the arrival of Greta's mother at the end of the movie and the surprise twist at that point.

Ellen Burstyn saves this teen drama from total disaster, her warmth and strong acting chops are well above average like always. Parts of this film feel like a watered-down version of Georgia Rule minus the sexual abuse angle.

3986731,3,B002TZS58S,"It is inevitable that every child star tries to grow up (or drift into obscurity), but those transitions tend to be a rocky road and as awkward as the teen years are in general before they can find their footing, if at all.  Hilary Duff has jumped head first into more grown up roles like performing in threesomes on Gossip Girl and an over sexualized pop star in War Inc.  Now for According to Greta, Duff unleashes her dark side.  Is the world ready for a suicidal Lizzie McGuire?  Well it is here ready or not.

For According to Greta, Duff plays your typical rebellious teen that gets shipped to the Jersey Shore to live with her grandparents for the summer.  Duff is quick to tell them of her diary where she keeps track of ways to die in.  Naturally her straight laced grandmother, Ellen Burstyn (W.) is not amused.  Luckily her grandfather is more understanding; same goes for the boy from the other side of the tracks who is trying to get his life straighten out.

Duff does go over the top at times in her characterization of a moody teen, but Burstyn ground the film and the more you learn about the family and its back-story, the more interesting the film gets.

But when I watched the movie, I was impressed with her performance.  After all, I am a big fan of Hilary, and I sincerely wanted to slap her face when I watched this movie.  Sometimes the ""bad girl"" or tough girl isn't always in your face; it's in the strength of her words, her tone, or her body language, all of which Hilary used to make the character of Greta come alive.  What we see when we peel back the layers is a girl who yearns to be loved, but has been so used to being disappointed that she puts up barriers.",1278892800,,666,4.2204724409448815
3986734,4,B002TZS58S,"Somewhere between the screenplay and Ms. Duff's performance in the first half of the movie, the power of this film is almost undermined. Miss Duff, as Executive Producer, clearly found the story appealing. However, it takes a closer look to fully appreciate the winning qualities of this endeavor. Miss Duff seems unclear how to embrace the role. Should she portray the character's youthful recklessness as a reflection of what her audience would expect? Or will she allow the role to provide her with the bridge she seems to be searching for from teen idol to serious actress?. The script is  slow to reveal where the movie's gravitas lies. That is part of its problem because the writer (s) are not completely comfortable in taking a bold leap with the story. That cautiousness places the movie just right above a ""movie of the week"" television fare. The addition of Ms. Burstyn and Ms. Leo also gives the movie breeding.

While this movie was built around Hillary Duff, the bright, sparkling career of Evan Ross continues to shine through. In his first semi-romantic lead, Evan's character, Julie, is mature, remorseful and loving. Ms. Duff may have thought that this ""bad girl"" role would be an opportunity for her  to stretch and move into more adult roles. Instead, she comes off looking like a spoiled, undeserving brat. In one of the first more arresting scenes, when she callously reveals how Julie (Evan Ross) learned to cook, it is Evan Ross that pulls the scene up and gives Ms. Duff's ""Greta"" more substance to play off of. The Academy Award winning actress, Ellen Burstyn, seems a little uncomfortable in the role of her grandmother. Perhaps that is intentional. The affection shared between her and her husband, as seniors still capable of loving, is unique in cinema today.

Evan Ross has an impressive resume of films (25) in some stage of development/production. He has such an ease on camera that it is rather mundane to state, but he looks like a natural on screen. Here he gets to emote in a different way than his previous other (6) roles. His youthfulness limits the types of roles that he gets to play so to see him show another side of a teen developing into a young man, is refreshing.

In only a manner of time, there is undoubtedly  a full starring role for him waiting in the wings. He has taken on some solid supporting roles in his previous works (""Life Support"", ""Gardens of the Night"", ""Pride"", ""ATL"", etc.). He is now clearly ready for the camera to focus solely on his amazing talents.

He literally steals the show in this affecting role. The  movie could have taken the traditional path but it makes an effective, if not, startling progression. His eyes are those classic ""Ross"" eyes and he clearly has inherited his mother's natural abilities on screen.

He is just a moment away from that break through role. ""ATL"" is in constant replay on BET and TVONE. ""Life Support"" has gotten a strong amount of airplay on HBO. So his face is becoming more and more familiar.......out of all the movies on his slate, that breakthrough role is sitting, waiting to be enjoyed by his building fan base and those ready to discover an amazing new talent, one, Mr. Evan Olaf Ross-Naess.

Thanks to the appearances and performances from Ellen Burstyn, Melissa Leo and Mr. Ross, the movie earns another viewing. Though it never got a full theatrical run, it deserves a closer look as a rental, if only to watch the fascinating development of Evan Ross.",1278028800,2,3471,4.750830564784053

Certainly not a good influence for teens. Also, I just didn't think Duff had the gravitas to pull off a suicidal teen.

The acting in the movie was fine. While not a fan of Hillary Duff I thought her performance in the movie was right on par. I feel that the part of this movie that falls short for me is the plot.  While the movie is engrossing and entertaining- the end feels rushed and like it was neatly wrapped up a little too quickly.

Hilary Duff gives a realistic performance as the title character, a 17-year-old who's trying to figure out who she wants to be in the midst of a troubled, broken family. Her mother seems to care only about her current relationship, and her father killed himself when she was very young. Greta's mother ships her off to stay with her Gram (wonderfully played by the talented Ellen Burstyn) and Gramps (an enigmatic Michael Murphy) in the small town of Ocean Grove, New Jersey, for the summer. Greta views her stay as 'an imprisonment' and sets out to be a total bad girl, but does find some redeeming moments as the movie progresses.

In her journal which she keeps with her at all times, Greta keeps two lists: one of things she wants to do before she dies and one of suicide methods. Greta's grandparents both try to help her, but really don't know how to deal with a depressed teenager. Greta meets Julie, a black teenager who was once in juvenile detention is now a short-order cook with dreams of becoming a chef, and the two begin the age old dance of romance. Just when we think that Greta's relationship with Julie has helped her to mature, the bottom falls out.

At first, Greta (played by Hillary Duff) appears to be a self-centered, spoiled teenager.  Throughout the course of the movie, it becomes apparent that Greta has much more depth -- and has experienced much more pain in her life -- than any teen should have to deal with.  But at the same time, the movie shows how the thoughtless act of suicide (or even attempted suicide) affects others much more deeply, and in ways not expected.  It's difficult to tell the  how, why or who else without giving away the plot.  But I will say that the movie does a good job of treating such a touchy subject with sensitivity, and in a way that doesn't glamorize suicide or treat it lightly.  Despite myself, I ended up enjoying this movie.",1268784000,,854,4.5359477124183005
3986745,3,B002TZS58S,"Hilary Duff's career mission to remain relevant past her teens doesn't gain an awful lot from this film. It's a vanity piece for Duff, who plays a maladjusted and disaffected teenager with a loving family who consistently rejects anything reasonably nice in her life. Once she details her personal suicide pact to her grandparents, she proudly concludes with the notion that they ""won't have Greta to kick around anymore"". Just who is so adamantly opposing her must be immaterial, because in reality she is impudent, sarcastic, and just generally obnoxious. I suppose her personality is intended to be 'lovingly sassy', but the screenplay fails miserably in this department. Greta commits a sin worse than being an unlikeable character, she's simply boring and uninteresting. She's a spoiled infant with no genuine problems, using an event from her past to continually push away those closest to her and essentially just behave like a child.

For teenagers, however, this film will probably strike a chord. It's unlikely they'll question overmuch the items I just mentioned, preferring instead to relate with Greta because they, too, have some sort of dark teenage angst to work out. For it's target audience, there are a myriad of high notes this film strikes. Greta's character arc is nicely realized and her burgeoning romance with a co-worker is pleasant to watch unfold. There's some fine life lessons for teenagers here, along with some moments of genuine humor, and an open yet satisfying conclusion. It just simply offers nothing for those past their teenage years.

We enter this club by accepting free copies of products but we promise in return to submit an opinion.

Greta is a welcome addition to our movie collection. The plot reveals a young woman who is growing up right before our very eyes, going from a teenager filled with anger and issues of abandonment, to a rebellious girl sent to spend a summer with her grandparents, to a young woman attempting to become independent through a job, where she meets a young man that has had very difficult times and clashes with what he perceives as a person who ""could be lots of fun, passionate, but who could get him into trouble again.""

The movie started slow, one has to ponder as to where the movie is taking us and soon we find ourselves in the middle of a powerful story of transformation.

Hillary Duff's performance as this 17 year old who is overcoming parental abandonment issues while she figures out who she is and who she wants to be is magnificent. The grandparents, played by Ellen Burstyn and Michael Murphy are pivotal to her growth, presenting the generational friction necessary for Greta to create a vision for the future.

Without attempting to give the plot away, if you enjoy transformational movies that reveal key elements of personal growth, then this movie is excellent. If you have teenagers in your family, share the experience for them to gain from the lessons learned from this rather dysfunctional family.

Hillary does very well depicting the obnoxiously rude teen who's mother has pushed her onto her unsuspecting maternal grandparents. Greta quickly informs her grandparents of her intention to kill herself by the end of the summer but it's pretty obvious right from the start that she's really in it for the shock factor.

This was a movie with powerful potential, especially since the topic of teen suicide is an important one. Unfortunately the execution wasn't as strong as it could be. There were three problems with the movie: inconsistent acting, a mediocre screenplay, and haphazard editing.

As far as the acting, Hilary Duff excelled in certain areas of the movie, for instance when she began working as a waitress and toward the end of the film when she opened up to her grandparents. But more than a few times, her acting came off as disingenuous. I was surprised, however, by Evan Ross, who plays Julie, Greta's love interest. His acting, though also inconsistent, was better than I expected. Ellen Burstyn, who played Greta's grandmother, was completely believable in her role and her experience definitely shines through.

The screenplay hindered this movie more than helped it. The development of the relationship between Greta and Julie seemed far too rushed and before I knew it, before the two really *did* anything together, they were already as close as two peas in a pod. Part of me suspects that this had more to do with editing than the screenplay itself. Overall, the movie would have been stronger if they played the romantic angle (since it is pegged as a romantic drama) more than they did.

On a more positive note, I truly enjoyed the art direction of the film. The opening credits, along with the DVD's menu, played off a collage journal theme. The DVD also offered special features, which includes a behind the scenes look at filming the movie (which was more interesting than I expected it to be), an alternate ending, and some deleted scenes. In terms of language and risque situations, it's quite tame. The message that the film imparts--that life truly is worth living--is certainly a good one and I'd have no problem recommending it.

It is as though they wanted to keep the movie in the mainstream while looking at flawed characters.  Or perhaps with a running time of about 90 minutes, they didn't leave themselves enough time to thoroughly explore the impact of suicide in our society (though they did show that it resonates with a lot of families and among teens). Having said this, my family enjoyed the film and felt that the plot was intriguingly portrayed by the actors even if a bit too predictable and ""neat"".

Greta has not had the easiest life, and although she does well in school, she has a rude and blunt personality, and easily alienates people who are trying to befriend her.  Most of her issues stem from the fact that her Mother is constantly remarrying and spends little time with her, and her Father is not present (where he is I'll let you find out for yourself).  Faced with a life of loneliness and boredom she decides the best thing to do is commit suicide before she turns 18.

The summer she spends with her Grandparents plays out fairly predictably.  Grandma is the stern disciplinarian whom Greta is constantly fighting with, and Grandpa is the lovable peacemaker who is always trying to smooth things over.  In order to have some money to spend Greta takes a job at a local restaurant where she is befriended by a young chef named Julia (Evan Ross).  Their friendship eventually turns into a romantic relationship.  Greta attempts to commit suicide twice, and during her second attempt things do not go as planned.  That marks the point in the movie where the story becomes more engaging and the acting more believable.

The cut scenes and opening credits deserve a mention.  Both are done using stop motion effects and the music that accompanies them is great as well.  The visuals are done well and interesting to watch.

While I didn't expect a groundbreaking film, the acting in the first half of the movie especially disappointed me.  Both Hilary Duff and Ellen Burstyn are acting in an over-the-top melodramatic way.  The characters have so many clich&eacute;s in both the performances and costumes that they are forcing down your throat that Greta is a rebellious teen and Grandma is a cantankerous old lady.  Moreover, Hilary's Greta is such a nasty character for most of the film that you simply don't care if she does kill herself.  Evan Ross' Julia is performed well and his character is nicely developed, but someone needs to tell him to speak up, he whispers all his lines.  Thankfully, for some reason, Hilary and Ellen tone it down for the last half hour of the film, and they become much more believable and engaging in their roles.

All in all...if you can get past the first hour, it's a decent ending.  The cut scenes and opening credits are especially enjoyable though.",1266105600,,2781,4.745833333333334
3986757,3,B002TZS58S,"Hilary dDuff plays this bratty girl that goes to live with her Grandmother. Wow!! What a stretch. Otherwise it was a typical story of an ungrateful young woman who turns around after realizing life is a gift itself and we shouldn't have to wait for life to give you something.

I liked the visual storyline in how her journal drawings would come to life. Otherwise it was an OK movie.",1266105600,,384,4.485714285714286
3986758,2,B002TZS58S,"... but for anybody else, pass on this one.

Hilary Duff is an angst-ridden teenager -- not a big stretch there, is it?  Ellen Burstyn must be having trouble finding work, because she agreed to play the completely overly-stereotypical grandmother, in a role far far far below her talents.

""Julie"" is a *gasp* black, *gasp* boy, *gasp* out of juvenile detention, who somehow has his life pulled together and in balance, and pulls Hilary Duff's character (Greta) into something resembling growing up.  At first, Greta uses him for shock value to scare her grandparents, but he shows her up as the childish fool that she is.

The ""You want to kiss me, don't you?""  ""I totally want to kiss you"" scene is so trite as to be beyond belief.

Anyway, if you love Hilary Duff, you'll probably love this movie.  If you're an angst-ridden teenager (and I'll even say ""teenage GIRL"", because boys won't care), you'll also probably enjoy it.  I'm neither; I didn't like it.  Enough said.",1266019200,,974,4.744047619047619
3986759,5,B002TZS58S,"One wouldn't think the subject of suicide should be done with such a light-hearted tone.  But here we see Greta, though an unhappy 17-year-old, wouldn't really kill herself.  She just wants attention.  But her mother doesn't realize that and sends her to live with her grandparents for the summer, on the excuse that she needs to work on her marriage.  We learn that Greta aches to know her real father, who committed suicide when she was young, and to get her mother to be more open and honest with her.  This film shows Greta struggling against her grandparents by saying she's gonna do whatever she pleases, and gets a job as a waitress, goes into the forbidden Ashbury Park, makes her new boyfriend climb the trellis into her bedroom - and writes a series of bizarre fun notes in her notebook.

The movie has a light tone, a lovely resolution, great acting, and superb filming techniques, including some of the entries in her journal that come to life.  I think the movie does a wonderful job shedding some light on teen suicides, and on how only we can change ourselves - we can't expect others to do it for us.

This movie was released in 2009, but I don't think it ever made it to the screens, which is a shame.",1265932800,,1218,4.479638009049774
3986760,4,B002TZS58S,"Was surprised by the maturing of Duff in this movie. It seems we have all watched her since she was a small girl in some capacity or another, so this role was a new one. I also noted that she produced the movie as well. Who knows this may be a turning point in her career. The story focuses on the relationship between a 17 year old and her mother/grandparents. Since I have family members in this age group I could feel strong identification in the differences of ages and expectations of each other. Duff is a lost young woman, bent on self destruction and apparently the destruction of those around her. She is angry and rebellious. She is without a father and this void has never been filled in her. Her mothers apparent neglect of her in her fight to find a life for herself as well has further driven the wedge between them. Avoidence of the ""problem"" leads the mother to send her to her grandparents for the summer. The grandparents have a hard time adjusting to the free willed Greta as well but I had to admire the fact that they were determined to help her. It is a delightfully complex movie about the relationships in a family and you may see yourself in any of the roles represented. Not for young children.",1265760000,,1220,4.402654867256637
3986761,2,B002TZS58S,"I commend Hilary Duff from breaking her teen princess mold here, but her acting leaves a lot to be desired. The story itself, about a girl wanting to kill herself before turning 18 and then finding reason to live, is nothing new. I didn't like the characters enough to care what happened to them. It's not entirely bad, but there's nothing worth wasting 90 minutes of your life over.",1265673600,3,383,4.565217391304348
3986762,3,B002TZS58S,"I heard good things about this film, and I was eager to see it.  And the performances certainly did not disappoint.  Sadly, however, with a running time of less than 90 minutes (not including credits), the solid cast could not salvage a rather superficial storyline not given enough time to mature and develop.

As a moody, disrespectful, angst-filled teenager mad at the world, Hilary Duff gives the performance of her career and creates one of the most distasteful and unlikeable characters in recent memory. It made the film difficult to embrace, but I assumed that, over time, her character would subtly change and her behavior at the start was necessary to appreciate the journey. Sadly, however, her character stays mostly the same until the last fifteen minutes when a sudden, unbelievable change takes place that wraps everything up a little too nicely. The love interest, which serves as the film's emotional core, completely vanishes and remains unresolved, though a better ""alterate ending"" on the DVD provides a tiny shred of closure.

All in all, this is not a bad film. It could have potentially been a great film if given a realistic running time of two hours to better develop the characters and their relationships.  As it is, I have difficulty recommending it.  It is worth noting that on the DVD you get a better alternate ending, about seven minutes of deleted scenes, and a decent 18-minute behind-the-scenes featurette that, somehow, does not feature Hilary Duff at all even though most of the cast and crew give interviews.",1265673600,,1546,4.9728682170542635
3986763,5,B002TZS58S,Hilary really impressed me on this spectacular movie about finding your place in the world and how everyone just wants a little L-O-V-E. Buy this movie and you won't regret it. It has comedy drama and something for everyone. I still cant belive it wasn't realesed worldwide.,1265587200,,274,4.851063829787234
3986764,2,B002TZS58S,"This entirely predictable movie simply strings together one tired cliche after another. Ellen Burstyn's performance is excellent, but I had a difficult time believing Hilary Duff was a teenager, let alone a depressed, suicidal teenager. The animated diary sequences held my interest, but the rest of the movie bored me. If you're a Hilary Duff fan, you might enjoy this film, although her limitations as an actress become appalling apparent when you see her side by side with Ellen Burstyn and Melissa Leo.",1265155200,2,506,5.108433734939759
3986765,4,B002TZS58S,"There are plenty of problem-child films.  I had low expectations -- that we would get the usual check list of problems, causes and events.  Slam them in and crank out a movie.  I do not know Hilary Duff's work; I have heard the name.  I can say she has done a convincing job.  I  can assert that the casting in general is strong.

Gretta the troubled child is put on a bus by her mother because mom is trying to stop her current husband from exiting.  Gretta is an annoyance, and bloody adept at it. She is going to Ocean Grove, New Jersey, an idyllic ocean-front resort where Gretta's grandparents have lived since mom was a brat.  Ocean Grove is one of the beautifully built ocean fronts in the world.  Large houses where porches and upper story balconies are prized far above a lawn, to gaze on the Atlantic and breathe oh so well.

The central theme is teen suicide.  There are others.  The songs are a dead, so to speak, give away,  The opening ""I Wanna Die"" might trigger the theme, but of course it is a lovely song about wishing to die in Louisiana, rather than, say, Burma. The sound track in general is thoughtfully chosen and effective in this well executed not in-your-face mode.  Nice touch with this song.  Another is a classic 50's summer seaside song, ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" by heart throb Frankie Avalon.

I like how the grandmother (Ellen Burstyn is better than in so many anguish-only roles), and grandfather are fully developed characters.  Evan Ross is superb as the romantic interest and, more importantly, the foil to Gretta's background.  He almost steals the show, but I am happy with both.  We will be seeing more of him.

With all of the story, there is still a little to see of careful film making.  In Grandfather's marina, do not miss the long shot of the dog paddling among the slips; he fetches what otherwise looks like merely another floating board.  Nice touch, this.  Next you will see his project: restoring a mahogany cabin cruiser.  These are the glories of our 1890-1940 boat industry.  This boat deserves to be the platform of the movie's climax.

All themes are intelligently expressed, especially the hard ones.  I have only one nagging question, which is ""Who am the guy in the photo at the very end?""  I know his face and I am having a brain-out.  Lastly, the movie has the good grace to close with an Oscar Wilde quote.",1264896000,,2376,4.522352941176471

8380807,4,B002TZS58S,"When I ordered this, I thought that it was yet another teeny bopper movie. However, it touched on many adult themes.

Duff stars as an annoying, rebellious, and bipolar (?) teenager. After her mom grows weary of her antics, she gets sent to New Jersey to spend the summer with her grandparents (BTW: I loved all of the snide remarks about Jersey, especially considering the fact that I work there...). She acts disrespectful to them. Her grandpa, who's somewhat of a pushover, tolerates it while her grandma isn't having that (If I talked that way to my parents or grandparents then they'd take a belt and whoop my behind).

Greta got a job as a waitress and mouthed off to her customers (I'm seriously perplexed as to why she wasn't fired). While at the restaurant, she met Julie (I never heard of a guy named Julie- that's a female name). Julie, who spent time in juvie, was a little rough around the edges. After he becomes aware of her plan to commit suicide, he tried to talk her out of it. A funny scene was when Greta introduced Julie to her grandparents. Even before she knew that Julie was an ex-con, it was clear that her grandma was apprehensive of a black male.

After a stunt in which Greta pretends to attempt suicide, her grandma suffered a heart attack. Then, her mom arrived and threatened to send her to boot camp. It was later revealed that Greta was acting out because she misses her dad, who tragically took his own life. She also wanted to commit suicide since she was afraid of getting old and wanted to live life to the fullest while she was young. Furthermore, her mom has animosity towards her grandparents due to the fact that they kicked her out of the house for abusing drugs.

This is definitely an enjoyable movie, but it requires somewhat of a suspension of disbelief. A petite white girl is really going to ride a bike through Asbury Park in short shorts by herself at night and not get raped or mugged? A waitress who's totally obnoxious isn't going to get fired? And her grandma forgave her after she nearly caused her to die?",1464048000,2,2061,4.517426273458445
