2214621,3,B0007KI9LU,"Incredibly bad script (with two good scenes-shark death, brosnan and harrelson in bed together), very strong musical score by Lalo Schifrin.  Overall unforgivingly weak acting from Selma Hayek and Pierce Brosnan.  Cheadle was good as always although wasted for the most part and playing a thoroughly ridiculous and unbelievable bad guy.  Ratner's direction of this was also all over the place and i am a fan of his other films.  I kind of felt with this film that he was becoming a poor man's Jonathan Demme because at times ""Sunset"" reminded me in feel of Something Wild and Married To The Mob, but unlike Demme who when he's good he's great (i.e. Wild, Mob, Howard, Silence, Philadelphia) Ratner really lost it with this one.  It felt like he couldn't find the right tone for the humor and suspense and was at a loss in terms of balancing the two.  The film is not the worst ever made - don't get me wrong it is watchable but so much of it is so preposterous and some of the characterizations simply don't work.  I decided that the film deserved three stars out of five though as opposed to the one star I initially wanted to give it for three reasons 1. Naomi Harris(28 Days Later)in a strong supporting role 2. The music and sense of place (i.e. a wonderful parade scene that was very Demme in spirit) 3. And last but certainly not least the brilliant comedic performance by Woody Harrelson that makes the film so much better than it deserves to be.  He truly is a great and underrated actor who has starred in two of my favorite films of all time Larry Flynt and NBK.  Every film i have seen him even some really bad ones he is always in top form.",1101600000,,1652,4.443708609271523
2214622,4,B0007KI9LU,"I've seen a lot of reviews panning this movie. I understand the perspective of these reviewers. Generally, they find this type of movie too light-hearted and shallow. They expect a movie with some teeth and action and reality driven (Oh, what ""Survivor"" has done to us!) Well I have to admit, I go to movies to escape reality, not face it. Life is heavy-hearted and deep enough for me. This movie fits the bill: it's a total escape from reality. And if you take it for what it's supposed to be, you can have fun with it. I did.

Harrelson and Brosnan play off each other very well.  Brosnan is understated, at times maybe too much, while Harrelson as an FBI agent is miscast.  Salma Hayek still can't act, but then again in this movie she really doesn't have to.  The story is predictable, the plot line breaks occasionally, and the acting occasionally is phoned in.  But the scenery, including Hayek, is breathtaking, and the trip away from reality is fun and humorous, with enough suspense and intrigue to keep me interested.  It's a piece of fluff, but if you understand that going in, you'll probably enjoy it.",1100822400,2,1114,4.601010101010101
2214623,2,B0007KI9LU,"Pierce Brosnan, I can't believe that he left the James Bond franchise, the most prosperous movie franchise of all time, to do simple minded caper films like After The Sunset.  I'm usually able to put up with boring movies, but not when it comes to caper films.  So I was extremely disappointed with this movie.

This movie is basically about a criminal named Max (Brosnan) and his girlfriend Lola (Hayek) who just stole the second of three Napoleon diamonds and decide to move to a tropical island to retire.  There they are followed by an FBI agent Stan (Harrelson), whom the two theifs stole the diamonds from while he was on duty watching them, who is ultimately trying to get revenge on Max for making him look like a fool in the FBI.  Luckily enough, the last Napoleon diamond is going to be on display on a cruise boat that will be docked on the island for one week, so Max has one week to come up with a way to get the diamond, avoid getting caught by Stan and keeping his girlfriend happy.  She doesn't want Max to steal the diamond.  Does he decide to steal the diamond?  Does he avoid the FBI and get away with stealing it?  Does he keep his girl happy?  Thats basically the whole plot.

  This movie was not good at all. As you can tell from the title of my review, it was very slow.  It started out pretty good with a cool remote control car chase.  Then the movie just died for, well, basically the rest of the movie because even the scene when Max attempts to steal the diamond isn't very exciting and it lasts for about 5 minutes.  Pierce Brosnan is good, but then again he always is.  I'm a big Bond fan and I'm just a little bummed out that he doesn't want to make any more Bond films.  Selma Hayek just shakes her [...]and jugs the whole movie.  Woody Harrelson tells very unfunny jokes and Don Cheadle appears for maybe 10 minutes of this movie.  Talk about a waste of talent.

So overall I would not recommend seeing this movie.  Theres just not enough going on the keep the attention of the audience.  But at least I understand what the title means.  It means the time that you go to sleep, which is a great discription of this movie.",1100649600,9,2155,4.316708229426434
2214624,4,B0007KI9LU,"I would actually give this movie 3.5 stars if I could.  This is a movie that I really wanted to like.  Its got Pierce Brosnan and Woody Harrelson playing very well off of each other, its got Salma Hayek in tiny bikinis, and its got beautiful locales.  And its pretty darn funny too.  Sadly, the movie is less than the sum of its parts.

Basically, the story begins where most heist movies end- on the beach after the final heist.  Max Berdette (Brosnan) and his girlfriend Lola Cirillo (Hayek) are, or I should say were, professional jewel thieves who had simultaneously pulled off one of the best heists in history while at the same time completely humiliating FBI Agent Stan Lloyd (Harrelson), who had been tailing them for years.  After the heist, the couple moves down to the Bahamas to retire.

After a hilarious montage, we learn that the couple has been on the island for a few months, when Lloyd shows up claiming that he's ""on to them"".  Turns out that a cruise liner is carrying another priceless diamond, and Lloyd thinks that Berdette wants to steal it.  In order to learn about Berdette's plans, Lloyd and Berdette start hanging out, and they even start to become friends.

Meanwhile, Henri Moore (Don Cheadle), a local gangster enlists Berdette's help in stealing the diamond, while Lloyd teams up with Sophie (Naomi Harris), an island cop, to help him catch Berdette in the act.

So that's basically the plot.  While the movie is great and fast-paced at points, there are points of equal lenght were almost nothing happens to advance the story.  Furthermore, this movie follows a fairly standard heist movie formula, so it is reasonably predictable.

However, as I said, this movie is pretty funny.  This would be the main reason I would suggest seeing it now.  If you want a good story though, wait for it to come to DVD.",1100131200,6,1837,4.672897196261682
2214625,4,B0007KI9LU,"I must confess to not being a fan of Woody Harrelson, Don Cheadle or Selma Hayek, so you know off the bat who I went to see in this film -- Pierce Brosnan.

However, but the time this film was halfway through, I became a BIG fan of those three actors.  Very rarely do you get the sense that the actors had fun making a film, but the chemistry and joy that comes off the screen in After the Sunset makes it very hard to miss.  This is a great popcorn flick, and clearly the actors had a great time making it.  How could they not, they were in paradise.

Speaking of -- the cinematography in this film is costly.  Costly because after seeing ATS you will want to stay at the Atlantis resort, and I am guessing it is costly.

Costly too is Max Burdett's (Brosnan) tastes but he can afford it with his skill in thievery.  Equally skilled in law enforcement is Stan Lloyd (Harrelson), who is banking his career on finding Burdett as he tries to steal the third Napolean diamond.  Who ultimately succeeds in this film is something you have to pay to find out, but trust me, like Catch a Thief there is a twist at the end.

Selma Hayek is GORGEOUS in this film and equally believable as a thief and as a lover.  Don Cheadle's role is only a touch longer than a cameo, but when he makes his appearances, he can not be missed.

One of the big surprise highlights of this film is the chemistry between Rachael Harris and Obba Babatund.  Equally fun is the banter between unlikely gal palls Hayek and Harris.

Another surprise is the deft hand Brett Ratner had at giving the film goers just as small taste of social commentary.  You do see both sides of Paradise, and a careful viewer will take note of the stark differences between the two.

Being a Brosnan fan, I went into this film expecting to enjoy it a lot, but there was no way I could anticpate the many different ways I would.  After the Sunset is a film where you mind spending the money on the tickets and the popcorn.

Oh and that noise you're hearing?  That's the folks at Eon Productions banging their heads against the wall because they let their billion dollar Bond get away.",1099785600,27,2131,4.309045226130653

2214630,3,B0007KI9LU,"One would think that having Pierce Brosnan, Woody Harrelson, Salma Hayek and Don Cheadle in one film would give it a good chance of being good but no such luck here. The script is just bad/stupid. I don't mind watching movies in the ""light vacation-type genre"" every now and then but it only works when the film makers are not trying to pretend it's something more. In this case, they are trying to present it as a smart action flick but fall on their faces. For example, some of the tech gadgets are interesting and manage to engage you initially, but then, when it's combined with stupid human behavior it's no longer impressive. I would be willing to forgive plot deficiencies if there was at least some good chemistry between key characters and some romance but both Pierce and Woody fail to generate any heat with their respective ladies. The only good parts were some cute semi-funny scenes/dialogues between Pierce and Woody - 2 men clumsily reaching out to each other for some old-fashioned friendship...I also hated the complete lack of even an attempt to bring the story to any sort of moral conclusion, the end is just disgusting from this standpoint (won't reveal to those who still want to watch it but you be the judge). Basically, if you just want to watch something VERY light, that won't strain your brain but entertain with beautiful Caribbean sights, bikini-clad women and tech gadgets, go for it. Otherwise, if you want something more, don't bother.",1492128000,,1469,4.78740157480315

My first annoyance is they completely took out the sound track from the DVD and replaced it with some cheesey 90's cop drama music. Then they decide to replace all the sound effect to so if you have seen it enough that you know how it supposed to sound it will make you feel like your hitting speed bumps and the flow of the movie is destroyed. My second complaint is with the picture quality, it looks nice and sharp but the colors look muddy and almost yellowish looking. It ruined the vibrant colors of the film and the Bahamas backdrop.

I won't delve into the details of the plot but I will say that the film was a joy to watch. The locations and art direction were terrific. The cast and crew did a remarkable job of creating an island paradise that although unnamed was probably Bimini as that island archipelago at the time had no extradition treaty with America.

As another reviewer said, the cast truly had a great chemistry working together and enjoyed their time making the movie. I would have loved to have seen a sequel to this film. It's still not too late for that. But for now there is just this film. I'm the 169th person to write a review of this film and I can honestly say that it is a DVD you won't be disappointed to buy. Leonard Maltin only gave it Two Stars out of Four. That translates to Two and a Half Stars out of Five. In my opinion that is much too low. I would give this film Four and a Half Stars out of Five. It was too slickly made not to reward it with a high mark. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.

2214695,2,B0007KI9LU,"Watched it through, wished I hadn't, though heist films are a big favorite.

Every turn of the story, you see it coming a mile away. Woody Harrelson had some nice moments.

Ever noticed there's a trap that a lot of island location, particularly tropic location malaise that movies fall into, a troubled zone which, btw,  no generation of the Bond movies has: the actors and even the story seem to get so steeped in the location that there's not much of interest happening on any level?  I have to report that syndrome of way-too-laidbackness didn't happen in THE BIG BOUNCE, another island film. But it happened here.

Not worth it. Maybe this is a film aimed at drunken cruise ship patrons who prefer the Disney channel? In that case, it probably works pretty well for that demographic. It was good being able to watch the only other role I've seen otherwise great actress Naomie Harris in.  Harris' complex and haunting performance as Jamaican Obeah woman Tia Dalma in the PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN AT WORLD'S END film remains one of the great film portrayals in a genre that often gets written off as young adult/kiddie fare.

2214736,3,B0007KI9LU,"After reading most reviews I could find for After the Sunset I thought about this Blu-ray would be a safe bet but it didn't turn out that way. I won't go into the movie since it's a nice little caper that reminds me of a Bond film and Pierce Brosnan is great in it. I watched the New Line DVD in the U.S., where I live, and had nicely saturated colors so I thought the Blu-ray would have that plus better compression and clarity. Since this is a Canadian Blu-ray from Alliance it could explain the following differences compared to the DVD. The Blu-ray seemed to pump up the contrast and brightness but also dialing down the colors. There is also a yellowish/warm push to the colors which doesn't look all that great. There is more clarity to the image than the DVD but the overall look of the film has changed. Adding to this the font of the main title sequence is different from that of the DVD and some of the soundtrack music isn't the same as the DVD. For example the movie opens up on the DVD with the New Line logo against soundtrack music to the film but the Blu-ray opens up with the same New Line Logo except against the usually sound effects for that logo and once the soundtrack music does start it sounds similar but different from the score on the DVD. In essence it changes the movie a little bit. The lack of bonus content wouldn't matter if they had gotten the look of the film right. If you're fan of the film and like the look of the DVD don't buy this Blu-ray keep your DVD. Hope this will help future buyers who are interested in this.",1399420800,4,1556,4.260135135135135

Woody Harrelson was good as the somewhat bumbling FBI guy who has the last laugh.  I wished Salma had more acting opportunities that would reveal her excellent acting ability as well as her 10 figure.  I felt bad sometimes for her because she does have great talent and it is often lost as the director showcases her genetics instead.

2214804,2,B0007KI9LU,"Lobotomized mollusk and senile senior citizens must have been the target audience for this contrived nonsense. Apparently, this is a lame sequel to the revised version of the Thomas Crown Affair which starred Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo. Only this time, Pierce steals jewels instead of art. And, instead of courting Rene he is living with Salma Hayek, who plays Lola Cirillo, his crime-partner and lover. But, even Salma in a skimpy bikini cannot save this lame crime-caper/love story. However, if you dislike the FBI, you will like Woody Harrelson playing doofus FBI agent Stanley Lloyd, a modern version of cartoon character Dudley Do Right.

This is another classic paint-by-the-numbers production which supposedly was going to be a blockbuster simply because it starred Pierce Brosnan, Salma Hayek, Woody Harrelson and Don Cheadle at the luxurious Atlantis Hotel & Casino on Paradise Island adjacent to Nassau, Bahamas. But, apparently, nobody at New Line Cinema read the pathetic script by Paul Zbyszewski, based on a story by Paul, who subsequently created and wrote Day Break, the short-lived TV series on ABC. Obviously, Pierce, Salma, Woody and Don didn't read the script, or care as long as they got big bucks. There are all kinds of prostitutes in Hollywood.

The script is a cut-and-paste assemblage of cliches and contrived characters with the main plot revolving around Pierce as Max Burdett, a jewel thief pursued for seven years by FBI agent Stanley Lloyd, played by Woody Harrelson. Apparently, the FBI embraces nitwits which I guess explains how it bungled the 9/11 attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. Agent Stan after pursuing Pierce for seven years is robbed by Pierce as Max of Napoleon's Hope Diamond while personally transporting it to a museum in Los Angeles. I didn't know FBI agents can be hired as couriers.

Anyway, during the heist, Pierce locks Woody in an SUV and then via remote control directs the vehicle along public streets until concealing it in a parking garage. Although the vehicle is surrounded by other FBI vehicles, none of the many FBI agents had the common sense to simply shoot the tires of vehicle carrying Woody. But, that is minor compared to upcoming big cat-and-mouse chase which comprises most of the film.

Agent Doofus played superbly by Woody is suspended by the FBI but somehow retains his gun, badge and identification card. Somehow, he tracks Pierce and Salma to a private house on a beach in Nassau, Bahamas. Then he obtains six suitcases of high-tech surveillance equipment from FBI headquarters in Washington D.C. Then, on his own dime flys to Nassau, breaks into Pierce's house and plants listening devices. Somehow, a guy with a gun and six suitcases of high-tech equipment simply got on an airplane and walked through Bahamian Customs.

Next, the story really gets silly. Doofus Woody waits for Pierce at the house and makes lame threats. Pierce pays to have Woody moved to a VIP suite at the Atlantis resort and entertained by female masseuses. Meanwhile, Pierce and Salma, allegedly retired from crime, spend evenings going to dinner with an endless procession of loud and overweight American couples. Also, Salma pressures Pierce to write his wedding vows. Whoop di do! Another alleged hot chemistry scene.

Agent Doofus better known as Stan, enlists Sophie a local, black Nassau cop played by Naomie Harris, as his partner in the war against Pierce and Salma. This leads to the second love-story subplot which is even more pathetic than the Pierce-Salma tryst. The big sex-scene between Woody and Naomi is interrupted by a call to Naomi's cellphone regarding a jewel theft from a cruise ship docked in Nassau. Woody pleads for five minutes to do the deed. Naomi asks ""Can you do it in two minutes?"" Woody says ""Oh, yeah,"" and begins humping while both are still wearing underwear. I guess that was one of the great chemistry scenes referred to by other reviewers.

Anyway, the story limps along to a stupid finale more appropriate for a Saturday morning kids show on Nickelodeon. Regarding the Don Cheadle character and subplot: lame.  While playing a folk hero, Don as Henri Moore is building a paramilitary training center in what is supposedly a hospital in the heart of Nassau. I want to know how Paul Zbyszewski managed to sell this idiotic story. All the characters resemble cardboard standees at a ghetto liquor store and the actors simply go through the motions. As far as chemistry, you'll see more by watching mold grow on stale bread.

This big-budget($58 million) film was released by New Line Cinema during 12 November 2004 and had an opening weekend gross of $11 million. After two years, the world-wide gross was $61.3 million. So, New Line only received about $30 million which means the film was a proverbial bomb. If you waste your time watching this dud, you will easily understand why it failed.

By the way, although some scenes were shot at the Atlantis Resort on Paradise Island and the Old Fort Bay Club in Nassau, many beach scenes were filmed at Sycamore Cove State Beach in Point Mugu, CA, which is just north of Malibu. Also, most of the interior locations were shot at Los Angeles Center Studios.",1334707200,,5204,4.943935926773455
2214815,5,B0007KI9LU,"An OK story, but terrific photography. The flick also needed more action. Woody H was not the best casting choice for a FBI agent. Not convincing.

2214816,4,B0007KI9LU,"I really like this movie.  I think its cute, witty, and its got some great scenery.  And it has a good cast of characters as well.

After a heist in which they steal one of the Napoleon diamonds, Max and Lola decide to retire.  But island life is hard for Max, and when an FBI agent who used to be his nemesis brings the 3rd Napoleon diamond to his attention, he finds his mind wandering from writing his wedding vows to planning how he would steal the diamond.  But the FBI agent Stan is on him pretty thick, and while they get along they both know what the other is planning.  And Lola really does want to be retired and Max doesn't want to disappoint her.  But will the intrigue and challenge prove to be too great for him?

Characters:
Pierce Brosnan: Max Murdett
Salma Hayek: Lola Cirillo
Woody Harrelson: Stan Lloyd
Don Cheadle: Henri Moore
Naomi Harris: Sophie
Rex Linn: Agent Kowalksi

I think everyone was pretty well cast in this.  I thought that Don Cheadle's character was kind of an afterthought, and really just a diversion from the main movie, but at least he played it well.  Pierce Brosnan does a great job as Max and he plays a very likable thief.  Salma Hayek as Lola is very likable as well and its odd to find yourself rooting for the bad guys.  But they are just too charming.  Well, and for the male population Salma and all her bikini shots are probably pretty appealing too.  Stan Lloyd played by Woody Harrelson was a bit odd.  He did a good job but there was just something about him that didn't fit in with the rest of the characters.  I'm just not sure what that something is though, call it a feeling.

Its a pretty simplistic plot since its a caper.  Thieves want diamond, thieves go after diamond and have a good time while doing it.  But the setting they chose was absolutely gorgeous.  I have to admit I was quite distracted and jealous of the tropical paradise and lobster dinners.  I guess I'll just have to live vicariously through the movie though.  I also enjoyed the music which really fit well with the Island theme.  Lots of good band and tropical music.

It should be warned that there are some pretty amorous scenes in this movie.  If thats not your thing they don't last too long and don't really show anything, but they are definitely implied.  I'd still say its probably ok for children to watch, there's a bit of violence as well but most everything is pretty tame.

Definitely a good movie.  Nice acting done by the cast and a wonderful island to look at.  Easy to watch and relax.

2214817,3,B0007KI9LU,"It's a gem heist flick crossed with a buddy movie, set in the tropics with a double love interest to try to hold your attention. I only laughed when Woody Harrelson, as a hapless FBI agent, gets trapped in limos with jewel thief Pierce Brosnan remote-controlling the vehicles. Otherwise, it's a bit of a snoozer that makes zero sense. Harrelson is miscast. He always works better as a bad guy. Brosnan's hairy gut flab may be a turnoff. At least Hayek is in shape. The whole thing goes very soft after the taut opening. Worth a night's viewing if you have nothing better and don't wish to think at all.",1317600000,,602,4.4818181818181815
2214818,3,B0007KI9LU,"The time you spend watching this movie will probably be enjoyable and perfectly pleasant.  The location scenery in The Bahamas is absolutely fantastic.  The characters are charming and the plot is light-hearted and amusing.  There are problems that may arise, however, once the film is over and you've switched off your player.

The script is really quite one-dimensional.  Nothing whatsoever is happening beneath the surface.  Once you know how the story ends, you know absolutely everything there is to know.

The characters in this movie are also one-dimensional.  They seem to have no ""back-story.""  They exist simply to move the plot along and they have no reality in any other way.  We really don't know  anything about them.  They're dummies.

Pierce Brosnan plays a roguish thief in his patented manner and that's all he bothers doing.  It was a very easy paycheck for him to earn.  Woody Harrelson's portrayal of a rascally FBI agent is also a trademarked role for him.  Salma Hayek is beautiful to look at, but her character is not a person.

This is a fine flick to kill some time with.  Maybe that's what you want and maybe it isn't.",1284940800,,1145,4.814432989690721
2214819,5,B0007KI9LU,I loved this little movie. It is not the caliber of Gone with the Wind or The Green Mile but I thought it was a fun little movie. Good acting. The story really draws you in and then plays with you a little. Great scenery throughout the movie too! I recommend this movie whole-heartedly!!

2214822,3,B0007KI9LU,"The Seven Seas Navigator is docking in Paradise Island in the Bahamas for a solid week...They're having a nice promotion for the maiden voyage, calling it the Diamond Cruise: a gem exhibit whose star attraction is the third Napoleon Diamond... It's, allegedly, the only priceless remaining 'cute little rock' Max Burdett and Lola Cirillo haven't stolen...

The unlocking Special Agent Stan Lloyd of the FBI (Woody Harrelson) suspects that the two are planning to purloin it... But how could they with six cameras plus 24-hour rotating guards, unbreakable polycarbonate display?

Max (Pierce Brosnan) knows he can easily clip Napoleon III and make Lloyd look like a jerk again... For him, it's more about the challenge and the alibi--that's his work of art... But he affirms that the two are a couple of retirees trying to enjoy the island life...

The gorgeous Lola (Salma Hayek) knows that, with Max, they went out at the top of their game, undefeated... They were great together... But, now, she feels it is the best time to quit... For her, now, the challenge is to find joy in simple things, as a life filled with sunsets...

Lloyd was chasing Max for seven years--ever since the first Napoleon Diamond went missing... That day, he got to the scene, and took a few shots at the getaway car... Next day, a bottle of champagne arrives at FBI Headquarters with a note saying, ""Aim for the tires next time.""

In the island, Lloyd teams up with the beautiful Sophie (Naomie Harris) a local intriguing cop who requires a big arrest...

On the scene also appears Henri Moor (Don Cheadle)--the biggest gangster on the island--who affirms to Max that the impoverished people of the island need his help, and that a cash injection in tens of millions of dollars would relieve the entire Caribbean... So, he suggests to Max a partnership... He would give him what he doesn't have: access to the marina, the crews, rotation schedules, whatever he needs...

With picturesque sunsets, this colorful caper comedy has plenty of beauty, fun and humor...",1232755200,2,2040,4.895652173913043

2214835,5,B0007KI9LU,"I rented this movie on a whim and I fell in love with it.  It is action packed, funny, and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  Of course, who wouldn't love Pierce Brosnan in ANY movie, but he's especially charming and witty in this one as well.  Combine that with Salma Hayek's sensual curves and smarts, along with Woody Harrelson's humor and you've got a great movie. The only thing I didn't ""like"" was that the left Woody Harrelson's ""love interest"" hanging and didn't make sure they ended up together.

I watch this movie AT LEAST ONCE A DAY!!!  I love it!!!  I love that it takes place in the Bahamas!!  Someday I'll go to the Bahamas and visit where Max and Lola live.  :)",1209600000,3,691,4.2615384615384615
2214836,3,B0007KI9LU,"""After the Sunset"" (2004) directed by Brett Rather (""Rush Hour"" trilogy, ""Red Dragon"") centers on two successful jewel thieves, Max Burdett (Pierce Brosnan in a role that is a homage/parody of Bond. James Bond and Crown. Thomas Crown) and his dazzling girlfriend Lola (if anything, watching Selma Hayek in bikini on the Caribbean beach is well worth the price of renting). The couple retire to the Paradise Island after they creatively stole the second of the three famous Napoleon diamonds. The unlucky FBI agent Stan Lloyd (Woody Harleson) who has been pursuing them for years comes to the island at the same time as the third huge diamond from the collection is put on public display on the new cruise ship that spends few days on the island. As a true artist, Max can't help thinking about possibilities of stealing the diamond, even if he promised Lola to concentrate on writing the wedding vows and to enjoy retirement. Stan is certain that Max won't be able to resist the temptation and would not let him out of sight with the help of tough and sexy local cop named Sophie.  There is also Mr. Moore (Don Cheadle), a mafia boss, former Detroit gangster who has the plans of his own for the diamond...

I don't know how plausible or original the story is, but if you don't expect too much and are ready to forgive some awkward twists and turns, not very convincing relationships or almost wasted Don Cheadle, the movie is fun to watch. Brosnan and Hayek both look nice; Brosnan and Harleson have few hilarious scenes together; the scenery is gorgeous and the sun shines as bright as the famous diamond. With the running time of just 100 minutes, Action / Comedy / Crime  ""After the Sunset"" is a pleasant light entertainment.",1196035200,2,1729,4.6996699669967
2214837,4,B0007KI9LU,"After the Sunset is a very entertaining heist movie that is able to successfully combine several other genres along with a good cast and some beautiful locations.  Max Burdett is one of the world's greatest diamond thieves, and after a successful robbery in Los Angeles, he retires with his fiancee Lola to the Bahamas.  But after several months in the Bahamas, Max finds out that the third Napoleon diamond, he's stolen the other two, is coming to the islands as part of a cruise ship exhibit.  Lola doesn't want him to come out of retirement for one last heist, but Max has trouble resisting even with an FBI agent who's been trailing him for seven years and a local gangster hot on his tail.  Along with the heist aspect, the movie also has elements of the buddy picture, comedies, drama, and romance so there's something for everyone here.  This is the definition of a popcorn movie, it's entertaining throughout with plenty of twists and turns and a good twist ending.  And really, who needs an excuse to watch Salma Hayek in skimpy outfits for 100 minutes?

  Part of the enjoyment of the movie is that the cast seems to be having a ton of fun throughout the movie.  Pierce Brosnan leads the way as Max Burdett, the diamond thief who doesn't know if he can resist one last heist or go along with his fiancee's wishes.  Salma Hayek plays Lola, Max's fiancee and partner in crime who wants to settle down to a more normal life.  And the script gives her plenty of chances to wear bikinis and any number of skimpy outfits so that's always good.  Woody Harrelson is great as Agent Stan Lloyd, an FBI agent who has become obsessed with catching Burdett but comes to admire him and in some way become his friend.  Don Cheadle seems to be having a ball as Henri Moore, an American gangster in the Bahamas trying to muscle Burdett into stealing the diamond.  And last but not least, Naomie Harris plays Sophie, the local police officer working with Lloyd to take down Burdett and make a name for herself.  Chris Penn also makes a quick appearance that is one of the movie's funniest parts.

  For a single-disc DVD, the disc really has a lot of quality special features.  Along with the widescreen presentation of the movie, the features include 16 minutes of deleted and alternate scenes, including a different ending, a 5-minute gag reel that's very funny, a commentary from director Brett Ratner and his crew, a 70-minute making of documentary that follows the film from finding shooting locations to the premiere, a really worthwhile feature compared to most making of docs, a Charlie Rose interview with Brosnan, Hayek, Harrelson, and Ratner, an interview with a real diamond thief, a featurette about the visual effects, and a trailer and tv spots.  It's a great DVD and a must-have for fans of the movie.  The cast is great, the locations are beautiful, and the DVD is loaded with features, but overall, it's just a lot of fun.  Check out After the Sunset!",1195862400,2,2961,4.651923076923077
2214838,4,B0007KI9LU,"Max Burdett (Pierce Brosnan) is a retried jewel thief. Stan Lloyd (Woody Harrelson) is the FBI agent who failed to catch him. Max has settled down with his girlfiend (Salma Hayek) when Stan goes to see him, tempting him into one last heist but Max's girlfriend tries to talk it out of it.

""After the Sunset"" mixes action, drama and comedy and actually pulls it off, with a twist or two. The relation between Max and Stan is interesting and the film is well written overall.",1189728000,,474,4.511627906976744
2214839,4,B0007KI9LU,"This movie starts out like a James Bond film with an action packed scene before the credits roll.  Pierce Brosnan and Selma Hayek play a couple of high tech jewel thieves that have stolen 2 of the 3 Napoleon diamonds.  They retire to the Bahamas, only to find the third Napoleon diamond to be on display on a cruise ship.  Do they come out of retirement?  This is where the fun and thrill ride begins.  Woody Harrelson plays the FBI who kind of has a friendship with Pierce.  This film is action packed and even had some comedy in it.  I highly recommend it, especially for Brosnan and Bond fans.",1188345600,2,596,4.363636363636363
2214840,3,B0007KI9LU,"Nice film to pass the time, but nothing to write home about as the saying goes..... A bit on the slow side too.

Just your average diamond heist film! Take two diamond thieves, played by Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayak, out to steal one last diamond before going into retirement to a tropical island for the rest of their lives.....

Woody Harrelson plays an FBI Agent out to capture Pierce Brosnan's and Salma Hayak's character's in the act of stealing a diamond, but fails miserable & is suspended from the FBI. Harrelson catches up with them in attempts to capture them in the act of stealing a rather large diamond one last time!",1173398400,,632,4.584070796460177
2214841,4,B0007KI9LU,"Marketed as a clever heist movie set in an exotic locale, ""After the Sunset"" is also a satisfying romance with two idealized lovers (Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek) who let greed, dishonesty, and complacency come between them.  These lovers happen to be master jewel thieves enjoying their spoils in the tropics as their relationship reaches a turning point.

Filmed on location in Paradise Island, Bahamas, ""After the Sunset"" begins as they finish their final score in which they steal the second of the three famous Napoleon diamonds.  However, a persistent FBI agent (the unfortunately miscast Woody Harrelson) has been pursuing them for seven years, and becomes convinced that they are plotting another heist, rather than a romantic interlude and an early retirement.

Because the agent has no jurisdiction in the Caribbean country, he teams with a local police officer (Naomie Harris) and sets out to catch the couple.  A local man, (Don Cheadle), is a transplanted Detroit gangster also intent on acquiring the third diamond.  A convenient parallel romance between the agent and the police officer seems like an implausible scenario concocted by the screenwriters merely for laughs.

The relationship between the Brosnan and Hayek characters, however, feels genuine.  Although their circumstances are extreme, their struggles to remain a couple reflect problems in off-screen romances everywhere.  Not only is the audience unsure whether they will stay together, but we're unsure whether they should ever have gotten together in the first place.

The plot twists and turns combined with the two beautiful co-stars in a breathtaking environment make this an exciting film to watch.  While the story stretches the limits of believability, it's an entertaining 90 minutes of pure PG-13 escapism.

2214856,4,B0007KI9LU,"This movie gets high marks for five things and low marks for three, so overall it's a keeper.

THE GOOD - (1) A very colorful film, with wonderful bright colors from the Bahamas scenery; (2) an interesting story right from the get-go; (3) originality in the story; and (4) yes, to be honest, Hayak's figure, which is seen in abundance throughout the film. She knows it's good and isn't shy about showing it, and (5) overall a good mixture of crime, comedy, romance and suspense and just right amount of time at just under 100 minutes.

THE BAD - (1) Insulting gratuitous sex and really stupid sexual dialog at times; (2) once again subversive Hollywood making the FBI character a moron, for the most part; (3) some Rambo mentality (bad guys miss from close range, good guys never miss, etc.).

It's an outlandish story but don't analyze it for credibility or you'd be turned off and quit after 10 minutes. Just go along for the ride and enjoy the entertainment....and entertaining it is!",1146873600,3,987,4.69364161849711
2214857,4,B0007KI9LU,"Now ""After the Sunset"" is what I would call a really cool and funny movie. You can well expect something fun and interesting if a movie has both Woody and Pierce Brosnan in a movie together, and you get it in this film. The movie doesn't take itself so seriously since this isn't a serious heist film. There are little small jokes thrown in here and there that keep you watching and really keep you entertained. There is even a twist at the end of the movie that I never really saw coming. Throughout the film, you see two enemies that eventually grow to have respect for each other and even become friends. If you want a serious action flick like off of a James Bond movie, this movie probably wouldn't appeal to you. But if you like ""good cop bad cop"" comedies that keep you entertained the entire time, this is it. Not a blockbuster movie, but entertaining none the less.",1146182400,5,874,4.401234567901234
2214858,4,B0007KI9LU,"this is what his life would have been.

Max (Brosnan) is a jewel thief who always gets his target.  Stan (Harrelson) is the FBI agent in charge of guarding the latest gem Max has his eye on.  Stan doesn't have a chance but nearly manages to take Max down during the theft.  Lola (Hayek), Max's girlfriend and partner convinces Max that it is time to retire while they are one the top of their game.  With some reservations Max agrees and the two move to the Bahamas where Max soon gets bored while Lola seeks to find ways to fill their days.

Stan then appears convinced that this has all been a ruse as Max and Lola prepare to steal yet another diamond that will be arriving soon.  Max protests his innocence but Stan does not believe him.  Others soon become involved in this would be heist and eventually the diamond does disppear but who is the thief?

This is to serious heist films what REMINGTON STEELE was to serious detective shows.  Like Steele, AFTER THE SUNSET is a lighthearted romp that requires to viewer to not look too closely.  The real attraction here is not the clever heist but the interactions between the various characters.

While this film is fun and I definitely recommend it, it is not without flaws.  At times the action gets a bit confusing, even to lack focus.  This is somewhat explained during the directors commentary where it is made clear that the movie was rewritten a few times up to and including who the thief was and how the film would end.  Still this is a fun film, like REMINGTON STEELE, there are references to other movies.  Some are subtle like the split screen action a la THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR others more obvious like Max watching TO CATCH A THIEF.

The film is beautifully shot, and is at times, as the director jokes, almost an advertisement for the Bahamas in general and the Atlantis resort in particular.  The music score is a delight in itself.

The additional features are interesting and include, besides the director's commentary, deleted scenes, bloopers, a 'making of' feature, and some hidden 'goodies' that require a bit of searching.",1143763200,6,2098,4.621621621621622
2214859,3,B0007KI9LU,"""After the Sunset"" is a moderately entertaining cat-and-mouse caper film whose lighthearted tone, spirited performances and witty screenplay compensate for a less-than-sterling plotline.

Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek play two impossibly beautiful thieves who have decided to quit the business and retire to a gorgeous tropical paradise in the Caribbean.  However, it isn't quite that simple.  For one thing, temptation is an awfully hard thing to overcome, especially when you're as good at what you do as these two individuals clearly are.  Plus, the past always seems to be catching up to them, most specifically in the form of Woody Harrelson, as the Javert-like FBI agent who has spent his entire career being outsmarted and outwitted by the couple and feels this just might be his opportunity for some well deserved payback time.  Thus, he heads to the island to make sure they don't steal a priceless diamond (that once belonged to Napoleon) that is being exhibited in the area.  The tricky thing is that the chaser and the chased, the law enforcer and the lawbreaker may have more in common than any of them could have imagined before.

Brosnan, Hayek, Harrison, Don Cheadle and Naomie Harris have all tackled far more challenging roles than the ones they've been assigned here, but they all seem to be having a very fun time on this sun-soaked Caribbean holiday.  The resolution of the plot is both muddled and anticlimactic, but it's the interplay among the performers that is the selling point here.  And there is one truly hilarious scene involving Brosnan and Harrison in bed together that will have you rolling on the floor in hysterics.",1142726400,2,1652,5.0
2214860,4,B0007KI9LU,"I like all three stars. The mix of adventure, comedy and romance was good.  I thought the shark scene was hilarious. Bought a copy for a friend.",1141344000,,144,4.333333333333333
2214861,2,B0007KI9LU,"If you make comparion between `After the Sunset' and films based on Elmore Leonard, this clichd heist movie would be dull `Big Bounce' or turgid `Be Cool.' For all the inclusion of Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek, Brett `Rush Hour' Ratner-directed `After the Sunset' is at best a marginally entertaining film with few redeeming points.

From the ridiculously contrived opening heist sequence in LA, you know the film is not very good. You watch FBI agents carrying an invaluable diamond in SUV. You know their braggadocio is the sign that tells you its leader Woody Harrelson would be humiliated. And you know it is done by two professional thieves super cool Brosnan and ultra sexy Hayek.

That is fine as long as the scenes are quick and slick. No such luck, for the direction of Brett Ratner is slow and lazy, showing his hand too fast. And his bland direction never improves after flash-forwarding to the Bahamas, where Brosnan and Hayek live in retirement. Though Harrelson's agent arrives, and a big cruise ship comes in with a big diamond, providing the master thief Brosnan another chance to pull off a heist, the film never becomes involving, relying on the familiar jokes and the uninteresting, stereotyped characters.

Instead of the character-driven story, what you get is lots of beautiful images of the Bahamas (as if shown as promotion video) and a rough idea of the comfortable life there. You also have a chance to see Ms. Hayek in bikini, which is fine in itself, and a dull, thrill-free heist on the ship. And Oscar nominee Don Cheadle's worst acting in his career. Perhaps the director is to be blamed for Cheadle looks as if he doesn't know how to play his character as the gangster, who is after all unnecessary in the story, and probably he knows it. Only Naomie Harris goes unscathed thanks to the mildly interesting character as the local police detective.

With careless storytelling, careless casting (full of racial stereotypes) and very dry and tasteless capers, `After the Sunset' is `Rush Hour' without Jackie Chan. There are a few funny moments, but the film is hardly worthwhile.",1140825600,2,2111,4.871866295264624

A good combination of a ""not so bad guy"", the ""real"" bad guy, the bumbling FBI agent and romance. For those of us who like action but not the blood and the gore this was great. The comedy bits as Pierce Brosnan plays off against Woody Harlson were hilarious, as was Woody's performance. Pierce Brosnan's dry wit and humour was great.  Underlying it all was romance and sensuality. I've read reviews which complained the film had too much sex.....The main characters are lovers in ""retirement"" living in paradise and planning to get married....that's a recipe for a lot of lovemaking. When two people are in love they make love....a lot, and it was clear that Brosnan and Selma had great on screen chemistry. The love scenes were tasteful, sensual with a touch of humour at times. It was enjoyable seeing the on screen love between the too main characters come out right through the movie.

I bought the movie on DVD and enjoyed all the great extras.  For those of you who like the special features on the DVD this DVD is chock full of them. The bloopers and gags are hilarious.",1130716800,6,1205,4.616822429906542

2214875,2,B0007KI9LU,"""After the Sunset"" stars Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek as an engaged couple who also happen to be jewel thieves.  They plot one last job before they retire to the Bahamas and a life of luxury.  The only thing standing in their way is a bumbling FBI agent, played by Woody Harrelson.  Can these two thrill seekers can forego their lives of crime?

Overall, the movie is an agreeable time-filler.  The cast is attractive, the soundtrack music is fun, and the setting is gorgeous.  Unfortunately, the awkward script tries to balance intrigue and humor - ultimately doing a disservice to both.  In other words, it's exactly what you'd expect from the director of ""Rush Hour"" (Brett Ratner).  More importantly, this movie brings absolutely nothing new to the already over-crowded field of heist films.  One of the running jokes is that Harrelson's character borrows a DVD of Hitchcock's ""To Catch a Thief"" from Brosnan.  I should have taken the hint and watched that vastly superior Hitchcock movie instead of this completely average flick.",1124582400,8,1036,4.97093023255814

2214878,3,B0007KI9LU,"Okay, so After the Sunset certainly isn't a film that you'd be hearing about at the Oscars. It's not even a good caper movie, but it is funny. While the movie is surrounded around one great caper, the caper itself is nothing special, nothing we haven't seen before, and without any surprises. As a caper movie, it flops. As a comedy, it's, well, pretty good.

Brosnan and Hayek star as Max and Lola, two thieves ready to give up their caper lifestyle and retire to the Caribbean. Lola is excited about quitting-- she would rather spend her time scuba diving and watching sunsets with Max. Max, on the other hand, learns that a big fat diamond is on public display, coincidentally on the same island that he is now living on with Lola. He can't get the jewel out of his head. Then we have Stan (Harrelson). He's an FBI agent who teams up with a local cop named Sophie with the hopes of finally nabbing Max, whom he's been chasing for seven years. Toss in a gangster played by Don Cheadle, some funny one-liners, and lots of bronzed skin and you have yourself the perfect popcorn flick.

What's funny is that Brosnan and Harrelson have more chemistry than Brosnan and Hayek. I found myself wanting to skip the parts with Hayek just to get straight to Harrelson! These two are so funny together, especially in one noteworthy scene where they end up in bed together. Brosnan and Hayek make a beautiful couple no doubt, but their relationship seems forced and somewhat awkward. But at least they're nice to look at. All in all, this is just a funny and sometimes goofy movie. Not much in the caper arena, but funny nonetheless. Check it out sometime -- RECOMMENDED.",1121212800,19,1660,4.567114093959732

Hayek is beautiful, but she plays a caracature. Brosnan tries to look sophisticated and sexy by never shaving, but he can't pull off the look. He just looks old and haggard, especially in contrast to Hayek's vigor. Woody Harrelson wastes our time. Don't watch it.",1119657600,3,398,4.7

Then you add the FBI agent; Harrelson who doesn't like the either of them and has escaped his clutches for the last 7 years. Yet he admires Bronsan for he cleverness and just the way that he operates; add an attractive local Police Officer who gets mixed in with Harrelson and you have a comedy - drama to boot.

Although entertaining, this film has none of the wit or ingenuity of The Thomas Crown Affair. What it does have is Salma Hayek's breasts, which are so prominently displayed they are practically another character. What really stretches credulity is the sudden fast friendship that develops between Brosnan and Harrelson's characters.

2214883,5,B0007KI9LU,"I finally purchased this movie.  I saw it on an airplane on my way to Europe the first time.  Then it wound up on Netflix twice and at that point I decided to buy it...and I've played it in the background while doing other stuff a couple of times...why?

Well, it has great ""view again and again"" qualities to it.  I won't sit down and ""watch"" it intently but its a great background movie...but why?

Well lets start with the characters: The characters carry this movie.  Salma is gorgeous and she plays her role to a tee.  Pierce is in character as James Bond -- cool, suave, debonaire.  Woody?  He plays his role in a very serious manner and his character comes with color and flair and hint at a comedy that only Woody can bring.

The supporting cast is comprised of very senior characters.  Don Cheadle is an academy award nominated actor.  In every scene where he appears, he fills the screen with his acting.  This man carries movies all by himself -- and in this movie it shows the caliber actor that he really is!  He did a wonderful job in Hotel Rwanda and After the Sunset works in large part because of the dimension he brings to his villanous role with lines like, ""this used to be a childrens hospital but I'm revitalizing it into a paramilitary compound.""  How can you deliver that line convincingly but still tell the audience that we should laugh here?  I'll never know but he does.  Naomie Harris also plays a great supporting role and great opposite to Woody.  There are too many good supporting cast and I'm wondering how they got so many recognizable faces to do this movie.

At the end of the day, this movie works because all the characters were cast very well and played off each other very well even the seasoned actors who step in for bit parts that they play very very well.

Ok now to the plot, Its formulaic.  Pierce and Salma are jewel thiefs who decide to get out while at the top and retire to Nassau after stealing two of the three Napoleon diamonds -- Woody was assigned to protect Napoleon two and he's mad that he lost the diamond to Pierce and Salma.  Woody is the serious dogged FBI agent who does not give up but after losing the second Napoleon diamond to Pierce is now on a ""short leash"" from the FBI as he says but does not believe for a minute that Pierce and Salma are retired so he follows them to Nassau...apparently the ""third"" Napoleon jewel, the only one Pierce and Salma haven't stolen is on display on a cruise ship which conveniently is coming to Nassau.  The fun really takes off from there -- I won't give up more.  Its a wild romp from there.

If everything I've typed hasn't gotten you to at least rent this movie....men, Salma wears teeny bikinis and amazing dresses throughout this movie!  Uhm.  That's enough for me.  To her credit, she's a wonderful actress but gosh she's gorgeous too!  Ladies, both Woody and Pierce run around without their shirts for half the movie so there is a certain degree of gratuitous sex appeal to this movie.  But in the end, its the acting and the chemistry between the main characters and the supporting characters that makes this movie wonderful.",1118188800,,3137,4.471830985915493

Pierce Brosnan is always himself, which is pretty cool.  I always enjoy his films.  He brings an element of class to the art.  Woody Harrelson adds excellent acting with fun slapstick and great humor.  I don't want to give away too much about the movie because I think not knowing what's going to happen next is half the fun, trying to second guess the next scene or the outcome.  It's a story about a jewel thief with a really hot girlfriend and partner in crime.  Woody plays an FBI agent that is trying to catch Pierce, the thief, and is humorously outwitted each time.  Remember, I don't want to spoil it for you.  The end is very cool and I really got a good laugh on that.  It is the kind of movie I could watch many times with friends.  It's just a fun, fun movie with some nice eye candy.  You have a beautiful body Selma, stay in shape.  Enjoy!",1118016000,7,1021,4.294736842105263

Woody Harrelson saves the film from drowing; undoubtedly Pierce Brosnan shows his charisma and Hayek is convincing in her role but the film is in the middle of the road. it is a simpe divertimento and its only aim is to have a fun without any other pretensions. Brett Raner camera abuses of the first plane shots and close ups. The argument is almost imported from the Thomas Crown Affair but lacking the stylistic elegance of Norman Jewison.

The storyline is about two master thieves Max (Pierce Brosnan) and Lola (Salma Hayek) who decided to retire to the Bahamas. But Stan (Woody Harrelson) who plays a FBI agent believes that it's a cover for their next big hit. The last Napoleon diamond, which is scheduled to arrive on the island as part of a cruise ship exhibition. The question which is left hanging is max going to go for his biggest heist yet and will Stan finally catch his man?

The film has also other fun characters like Don Cheadle who plays the boss of the origination crime on the island. It's not an amazing film but with the cast and setting you won't be disappointed.

2214897,3,B0007KI9LU,"This isn't really a caper film, which is one reason I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  Sure, it has some of the elements of the Hollywood caper movie--the debonaire, super-clever and super-successful thief, the cop out to thwart him, exotic locations--but the movie isn't really about will-he-pull-it-off-or-won't-he.  It's more of a cat-and-mouse buddy movie.  That the heists are utterly implausible, to the point of being ridiculous (as they are in most caper movies, like Oceans's Eleven and Ocean's 12) doesn't matter as much, because it's not what the movie focuses on.

Instead, we get a lot of cute banter and bonding between Harrelson and Brosnan, who are fun to watch.  There are some good, low-brow laughs in this movie--they are enough for me.  I laughed out loud, for instance, when during the fishing scene Harrelson is putting tanning lotion on Brosnan's back, and Brosnan says, ""My pole!"" and Harrelson pulls back with disgust and says, ""No way, I'm only doing your back!"" (Of course, Brosnan meant, Look at the pole; I caught something.)  There are other, similar crude jokes and sight gags.

Both men are good in their roles, and fun to watch.  The female roles in the movie seem incidental, a formulaic requirement of Hollywood movies, and are never really developed beyond that basic requirement.  And what is Don Cheadle, a great actor, doing in such a miniscule role?  Anyone could have done his rolel he's sadly wasted.  Chris Penn has an amusing cameo...but my goodness, has he gotten fat.  I remember seeing him in movies in the 80's, before he starting hitting the Big Macs.  You don't often see an actor let himself go like that.",1117238400,,1664,4.875444839857651
2214898,3,B0007KI9LU,"After the Sunset is a fluffy piffle that is almost always beautiful to look at, but emptier than the nutritional content of cotton candy.

Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek make a good-looking couple, and the movie actually TRIES to address a theoretical dilemma that is infrequently brought up in movies.  If a rich and successful criminal retires, what do they do?  If, presumably, part of why they were a criminal in the first place is for the thrill of it, how can they be content simply retiring?  If being a thief is both your job AND your hobby, what do you do after the last ""big one""?  The only film I can think of that showed the boring lethargy that sets in on a successful criminal is the end of ""Scarface"" when Al Pacino is lying around in the marble tub of his palatial bathroom, smoking a cigar and cursing at his wife and buddy.

But I digress.  After the Sunset would be familiar territory if the only movies you had seen were the ""Ocean's 11"" remake(s).  It's a ""steal the jewel"" caper.  It tries to be a comedy, but Brosnan and Woody Harrelson don't have the comic chemistry we've seen both of them have in other work. Harrelson appears as the FBI agent who has been repeatedly burned by Brosnan, and wants to get his revenge.  It follows the film cliche where the lawman is ""hot on the trail"" of the criminal - a la ""Heat"", etc., but instead of an edgy relationship between the Thief and the Lawman we get a bumbling comic relationship between Brosnan and Harrelson.

The ""star"" of the film is the way it looks, and much of that is owed to the Bahamanian resort standing in for paradise.  The movie made me want to go there - but it didn't make me want to ever see this film again.",1117065600,,1698,4.355555555555555
2214899,1,B0007KI9LU,"Did I miss something?  Was there a contest going through all the Grade Schools of America to find the best story for acclaimed director Bret Ratner to bring to the silver screen?  If so, why wasn't there a calendar made for those who didn't make the final cut?  Oh, wait, apparently children did not write this film, but instead a guy that wrote for the TELEVISION SERIES the Weakest Link.  That surely makes him ready by all means to tackle the caper genre and inherit a big payday ... right?  You are the weakest link ... good-bye.  This movie was a disaster from the beginning.  With cardboard acting, an aging (and girth growing) sex symbol, and a corny ending that incorporated nothing that we were shown through the entire film, it is a big wonder how After the Sunset ever saw the illustrious ""green-light"".  Perhaps it was the size of Salma's boo ... name, or perhaps the fact that Pierce Brosnan's The Thomas Crown Affair was such a cult film, or maybe because Don Cheadle was in it, because it had really no pull with just Woody headlining.  So, how did this film get made?  This film targeted pre-teen boys and retirement communities, and with their great pull, the financing behind this film became very easy.

This was a caper film right?  We are supposed to go on this roller coaster ride of who's conning whom, coupled with lies, deceit, and a surprise ending that will make you want to rewatch from the beginning to experience anything that you missed.  That is the focus, goal, and overall tone that a film like this should have followed.  Instead, Ratner decided to just make a movie without any sort of excitement or drive.  As I watched this film, I never once felt excited about the plot.  Why?  Because there was nobody getting me excited.  The acting in this film was well below par for anything that Hollywood has released.  Pierce tries, but just can't seem to capture the essence of the film.  There is no little demon inside you rooting for anything.  Salma's role was basically for eye-candy.  She provided nothing spectacular either.  I can literally say the same for Woody and Cheadle as well.  Here we have strong actors doing absolutely nothing during the course of about two hours.  These characters never drive the plot, they bring nothing but clichs to the table, and by the end we really don't have any true grasp as to whom they are.  Honestly, cardboard cutouts could have replaced the actual actors and After the Sunset would have been a better film.  There was no depth to the characters, no emotion, no structure, just the simple direction of ""step here, say your line, step here, look surprised"".  It was embarrassing for all that were involved.

I think a major flaw to this film was that Ratner did not fully understand, or was prepared, for the caper genre.  From the opening moments until the end of the film, you can tell that Ratner is just trying to use his friends in the industry and show the world that he has some power as well.  I say this because I saw no true direction or moment of impressiveness where he defines himself as a director.  He reuses the same ideas throughout the entire film, he doesn't give anything strong to his players, and nothing stood out in this movie.  Sure, it was a beautiful location, but am I to believe that Salma spend a majority of the film building a deck for them to sit on?  Am I to believe that Pierce is still a sex symbol even with a HUGE gut sticking out?  Am I to believe that Cheadle is a bad guy/imported American who is at the top of the community?  Finally, am I to believe that Pierce could still move as quickly as Ratner defined?  I swear that in the final unclimactic moments of this film, I could hear Pierce doing some heavy breathing to get from point A to point B.  Maybe he isn't ready for the next Bond role.

So, without a good story, or decent characters, maybe there was some humor in it that could pull us away from the sour sensation cultivating in your mouth.  Well, guess who is placed in to do the humor element? Woody Harrelson.  Now, I don't mind Woody, but in this role, he just wasn't believable and his humor was so clich that I had trouble believing that he brought anything to this character.  He literally plagiarized his entire role.  Teachers, and film viewers of the world, should be very upset with him.  Instead of bringing a new twist to his character, he resorted to weird sex humor, skimpy bully humor, and that ever-popular drunken humor while fishing that is sure to make that senile woman in the front burst out with laughter. To me it was pathetic and a worthless attempt to make a joke out of already dead film.

Overall, this was a massive disappointment.  Here you had a decent director, some strong players, but the worst story ever written by a man who wrote for a game show.  Which piece does not fit?  There was this huge sense of apathy throughout this entire film and clichs riddled it that I just couldn't get past.  Brosnan had trouble with this film, and I couldn't tell if it was because he just didn't care, or because he was working with such low-talent that his heart just wasn't in it.  The ending hurt as well.  There was no excitement or intensity, just plain ... ""here it is ... like it or not"".  I personally couldn't digest this film with its poor acting and below-par story.  This may be a good film for some that are not familiar with the caper genre, but for me it was just hogwash.

It makes it hard to believe the level of antagonism that is needed to exist between them. Hayek is beautiful and likeable, but her revealing wardrobe does not redeem her one dimensional character.

Brosnan stars as Max Burdett, a jewel thief, who has devoted his life to the Napoleon diamond collection. Hayek plays Lola, Max's cohort in crime; and Harrelson is FBI agent, Stan Lloyd, Max's ever enthusiastic always present thorn-in-the-side.

After successfully absconding two-thirds of the Napoleon collection, Max and Lola have gone into retirement in some South Sea's vacation paradise. Eager to settled down and start a normal live, Lola is only interested in the simple things in life like watching the sunset, and socializing publicly. However, their lives are upended and thrust back into the limelight when FBI agent Lloyd tracks Max down on the hunch that he might be casing the last diamond in the prestigious Napoleon collection.

It so happens, whether coincidental or not, the exact island that Max and Lola have decided to retire on, is also hosting a cruise ship carrying the last diamond of this collection. Tensions run high, as Lola tries to convince Max to not venture into the trap that Lloyd is perpetrating. A subplot concerning Don Cheadle, playing Henri Moore, as a local underworld character, also motors along just under the radar of this film until the culmination of the film's pinnacle sequence, and the movie's ultimate deception.

Although I found the film very predictable, it was enjoyable nonetheless. However, what I found more entertaining was the lengths that this film went to remove Brosnan's debonair James Bond image which included: showing him scruffy with facial hair most of the film, overweight with a paunch belly, and jovial homo-esque eroticisms with the Woody Harrelson (Stan Lloyd) character. All in all, the film was not a complete disappointment. Plus there's the added bonus of having Salma Hayek to look at while on the screen too.

2214904,2,B0007KI9LU,"""After the Sunset"" is a caper movie that doesn't function particularly well as a caper movie, a romance that doesn't function particularly well as a romance, and a buddy movie that...well, you get the point.

This movie breezes through a hour and a half pretty painlessly, and provides some decent moments; besides, honestly, any film that shows this much of Salma Hayek gets two stars on general hetero principles.

Problem is, caper movies have to have something that crackles - the dialogue, the details of the caper itself, the action, the suspense - and ""After the Sunset"" settles for a laid-back, Jimmy Buffett style of storytelling that doesn't offend, but isn't particularly involving or fun.

Pierce Brosnan plays Max, an ace jewel thief; Hayek plays his partner in crime and life, Lola. Brosnan and Hayek have a nice, easygoing chemistry well suited to their comfortable onscreen relationship, which is tested when Max decides to pull one last job.

Woody Harrelson plays Stan Lloyd, an FBI agent who has been foiled by Max before, most notably in the opening sequences, during which Max takes remote control of the SUV Lloyd is riding in (neat trick, since 1) no car can be driven this way, and 2) Max couldn't possibly drive the car without knowing where it's going), knocks him out with gas, and steals the diamond the FBI is transporting.

Lloyd follows Max to the Bahamas (one wonders how much the Atlantis resort paid for all the free product placemeent), where he finds Max thinking (or maybe not thinking) of knocking over an ocean liner carrying a precious diamond.

Along the way, a local cop (Naomie Harris, following up her strong performance in ""28 Days Later"" with another one) takes notice of Lloyd, and they eventually hook up in a scene taken straight from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (you know, the one where Indy keeps telling Marian to kiss different innocuous body parts before pointing to his lips).

And, amazingly enough, Max and Lloyd become buddies, though I never bought that aspect of their relationship one bit (which, as it turns out, is more of a plot contrivance than a failure of the actors or script).

There's also a local crime boss (Don Cheadle), a transplanted gangster from Detroit who tries to contract Max to steal the diamond to ""develop the local infrastructure.""

Caper movies can either revel in the details (""Heist""), the characters (""The Sting""), or in the style (the remake of ""Ocean's Eleven""), but ""After the Sunset"" doesn't seem to revel in anything but its own mellowness (and long, lingering shots of Hayek, thank goodness).

2214916,2,B0007KI9LU,"Brett Ratner has directed several mainstream films including Rush Hour (1998) and Red Dragon (2002).  His latest addition to mainstream cinema is a less than mediocre cinematic experience called After the Sunset.  It has several interesting premises, but Ratner never succeeds in thrusting the story in an appealing direction.  Ratner does develop a sense of intrigue, as the film promotes an atmosphere that radiates charisma and lures the audience to desire the film to succeed.  Instead the film remains hanging in a twilight zone where the audience eagerly anticipates the film to kick off.  In previous films that Ratner has directed such as Rush Hour which brought millions to the theaters to enjoy the funny and action packed duo Chris Rock and Jackie Chan.  This time the audience will feel cheated as the end credits roll before the their eyes.

The idea to the story surrounds the couple Max Burdett (Pierce Brosnan) and Lola Cirillo (Salma Hayek) who live on the edge stealing highly guarded jewelry.  The affectionate companionship that these two have is suppose to engulf both of them and seems tense, ludicrous, and hollow.  This might be one reason for why the film never takes off, as much of the story surrounds how they feel for one another.  It is true that there are a couple of intimate scenes, yet these too feel a little awkward, as this is not the focus of the film.

The film opens with such a situation where the FBI agent Stan Lloyd (Woody Harrelson) has a strong intuition that Max will attempt to steal a colossal diamond that he is transporting.  In order to prevent Max from stealing the diamond the FBI has him under surveillance, but to little aid as he turns the situation into an extraordinary robbery where the FBI looks like kindergarteners versus adults.  During the heist the audience gets to see a solid idea, which is truly depicted in the Ratner spirit that many have been accustomed to through Rush Hour.  Yet, the film is very unlike Rush Hour, as After the Sunset also attempts to play on humor, but does not succeed and feels awkward, unfocused, and untimely.

After the heist, during which Max got shot, the couple retires to a comfortable life in the Bahamas.  Initially, Max and Lola enjoy retirement through fine dining and tender days in the sun.  However, too much of something good can also be spoiled if one loses the meaning of life, and one only tries to relax.  Restlessness begins to grow within Max while Lola picks up several hobbies such as tennis, carpentry, and snorkeling.  One day out of the blue Stan appear in Max's house, as he suspects that Max will plan a heist for the third and final Napoleonic diamond.  A light is born within Max, as Stan draws his attention to this grand diamond and maybe Max will make a comeback from his retirement.

After the Sunset brings several stimulating ideas to the audience that Ratner could have expanded on such as the restlessness of retirement, Max's love for Lola, the comeback from retirement, the heist, the relationship between Max and Stan, and much more.  Yet, this potpourri of themes and plots is turned into a jumbled mishmash of notions and thoughts that are never drawn in a distinct direction.  This leaves the viewer with much to think about, but nothing to conclude, as nothing is truly relevant to any of the characters.

After the Sunset has many good qualities such as wonderful cinematography, good sound, and good casting that unfortunately does not bring together a solid cinematic experience.  There is too much going on in the film, which makes it a little ditsy and unfocused.  Despite the unfocused storyline the audience gets to experience Ratner's potential as a filmmaker, as he does generate an atmosphere of brilliance that makes the audience want the story to succeed.

The entire movie is pretty much spent focusing on two professional thieves, the FBI agent that is tailing them, and the $64,000 question of whether or not they are really ""retired"" or will they steal again.

There seems to be lots of chemistry between Selma and Pierce, and because the location is tropical, there's LOTS of Selma in a bikini. The movie could almost be worth watching just for that.

I can't even say it's a romantic-comedy because there's really just not much comedy to it. Maybe it's almost a romantic-comedy, just with not a lot of comedy. They needed it funnier, or more action, or SOMETHING to happen. Instead, this film has multiple personality disorder, kind of just wanders around aimlessly until the sappy stupid ending.

Wait until they begin showing this on TBS before seeing it.",1112313600,,1030,4.743016759776537

2214921,4,B0007KI9LU,"AFTER THE SUNSET has all the makings of an enjoyable evening's diversion, and if that is all that you ask from a movie then this one delivers!  Director Brett Ratner knows how to stir the ingredients of his previous 'RUSH HOUR 1, 2 and soon 3' formulas and turn out a fast-paced, sexy, mildly tense heist situation into a story that successfully mixes comedy with suspense.

Max Burdett (Pierce Brosnan) and Lola Cirillo (Salma Hayek) have retired as diamond thieves and live on a Caribbean Island in total luxury and bliss.  Enter ex FBI agent Stan Lloyd (Woody Harrelson) who in an attempt to capture the escaped crooks dangles another Napoleon diamond that just happens to be arriving on the island on a cruise ship under their noses.  Stan quickly engages a perky local cop Sophie (Naomie Harris) to assist him in his plans.  Max discovers Stan's ploy, plays him for a fool, but eventually succumbs to the temptation to make one last Heist.  Lola, content with her retirement, discourages Max, but the stakes are upped by the local corrupt guys (a wasted Don Cheadle et al) and the heist proceeds.

How this all plays out - as far as Max and Lola, Stan and Sophie, and the almighty diamond temptation - is the quirky twist of the story.  Don't expect to be dazzled by the 'Topkapi, Thomas Crown Affair, or Italian Job' standards: just enjoy the fun of mixed setups and resolutions ... and a heavy dollop of Salma Hayek's physical attributes displayed at every possible moment.  A nice evening's diversion if not a great heist flick.  Grady Harp, March 05",1112140800,2,1558,4.694852941176471

Pierce Bronson is a thief allegedly on the verge of retiring with his beautiful girlfriend Salma Hayek. Woody Harrelson is a goofy, discredited FBI agent obsessed with catching Bronson.  This movie is a throwback to films of another era.  And much more entertaining than I expected.  In fact, I liked it a lot.

2214935,3,B0007KI9LU,"Utterly generic and unsurprising, but thoroughly enjoyable. The Bahamas are positively stunning, as is Salma Hayek and the other female lead (unfortunately, her name escapes me). Hayak and Brosnan have great chemistry, looking and acting completely comfortable and believable together. As for Brosnan's ""less than Bond-like physique"", did it ever occur to critics that he deliberately let himself get like that for the role? Never bothered me--he's one of few men who can pull off that scraggly look and still be hot.
A decent way to spend two hours on a Saturday evening.

So the DVD will contain outtakes? I hope one of them is the one shown on Letterman or Conan last fall (Hayak and director Ratner switched places behind Brosnan's back as he made a phone call, when he rolled over to kiss her, he completely flipped out upon nearly locking lips with Ratner. LOL!)",1111449600,4,868,4.904761904761905
2214936,3,B0007KI9LU,"It's not quite the groaner that trailers suggested it'd be, one cannot really go wrong with Salma Hayek and Piece Brosnan after all, but it's a fairly ho hum mishmash of crime and romance.

I guess the intent was to get two high-octane lead characters together and let them sizzle. Funded, I am sure, in part anyway, by the Carribbean tourism board because the locales are as goodlooking as the actors themselves. But the meat that goes around these bones, in the form of diamond heists and whatnot, is dated and lackluster.

Someone has to hate the other's guts for this kind of movie to work, as in Heat. Or there could be that intriguing capricious flavor as in Thomas Crown Affair. After the Sunset opts instead for a jaded comic turn that quite definitively kills the atmosphere it was gunning for.

If this comedic romp wasn't mostly relegated to easy double entendres, homoerotic mishaps (thief and detective, both male, caught in the same bed), and goofy shenanigans, this might actually have worked as it does for oddball Jackie Chan capers.

In the end, this is just a goodlooking but predictable filler for Brosnan's otherwise illustrious career, the way The Tailor from Panama was. Perhaps a rental for a lazy afternoon.",1110758400,6,1232,4.8246445497630335
2214937,4,B0007KI9LU,"Let's face it....there has been quite a lot of heist films in the past 20 years, and while this film does not thread on new grounds, it does bring all the elements we love from heist films, and with a little touch of comedy, makes it a worhwhile movie to watch.

The film starts off with a very paranoid, very jumpy FBI agent (played by Woody Harrelson) who's transporting a very valuable diamond.  As usual, we are treated to the clever, if not genious, plan of the diamond thieves to steal the diamond, with a somewhat eyebrow raising scheme.  I was having Knightrider flashbacks, but excuse me, as far as I know, we are still not able to have cars drive themselves yet? Even by remote....

Well, needless to say, they get the diamond, but not before our anti-hero thief gets shot (accidently), that brings us to the main plot of the movie.  Brosman's partner thief, the sexy Hayek, apparentlly fears for his life, since it came so close to ending, that she convinces him to retire to a paradise island.  It's obivous that they will play on the cliche that the thief wasn't really just being a thief for the money, but for the exciment (Hollywood's way of making the character a bit less amoral and tolerable to audiences I guess.)  His temptation will come in the form of an FBI agent (Harrelson).

Ok. I'm not going to give the movie away, but I will say that it does have its comedic moments, such as the lobster montage- where you see them eating it day, after day, and you can tell Brosman is getting sick of it.

Hayek playes a rather minimal role, being relegated mostly as the sex appeal, running on the beach, baywatch bouncing kind of scenes.  She plays the part well, for what she is given, although, her trying to be normal and do normal things kind of annoyed me- especiall when you think about her being a thief.  For one thing, if she wanted to settle down and be normal, then there were plenty of professions to choose from besides stealing, that would provide that same result.  Also, if you are rich, why bother doing things yourself when you can pay someone to do it? Isn't that the point of stealing to get money?

All and all, the movie is fun.  It does have a somewhat twist ending to it, which I must admit, I did not see coming.  The action, or heist, plays a minor role as well-foregoing the usual set up, when you see the thieves laying out their plans and preparing, which is usually present in heist movies.

Good movie to pass the time when you just want to stop thinking about the world for a while and put your brain on hold.",1109894400,2,2558,4.399150743099788

2214942,3,B0007KI9LU,"If you're looking to kill a couple hours, this movie might fit the bill.  It's a standard caper flick with FBI agent Harrelson playing cat-and-mouse with master jewel thief Brosnan.  Nothing groundbreaking:  you have formula characters in a formula plot.  On the minus side, the acting is uninspired and the plot has holes big enough to drive a freight train through.  Still, the interplay between Harrelson and Brosnan is fairly amusing and Salma Hayek certainly enhances the visuals despite her one-dimensional character. There's nothing exceptional or objectionable here, just an above-average cast making the most of decent material.",1101686400,7,637,5.459183673469388
2214943,2,B0007KI9LU,"Someone needs to tell Pierce Brosnan to play something other than spies and charming thieves -- he's been playing them since the eighties, and there's only so much he can do with those roles. Unfortunately he treads old ground in ""After the Sunset,"" a weary crime caper which is lightened only by Salma Hayek's attempts to spice it up.

Max (Pierce Brosnan) and Lola (Salma Hayek) are master thieves... in retirement. Having pulled off one last robbery, they are planning to retire to a tropical paradise. Lola loves the life of leisuere in the Bahamas, but Max is finding it a bit hard to settle down -- he even tries to get Lola to engage in some petty thefts, just for the rush of it.

Then Max learns that a nearby cruise ship is showcasing the famous third Napolean diamond. He's already stolen two, so it seems only appropriate. FBI agent Stan Lloyd (Woody Harrelson) is determined to finally catch his quarry after seven long years -- and engages in a tedious game of cat and mouse with Max, as Max decides whether or not to steal the diamond.

It's a bit hard not to compare this to ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" Brosnan's sleek star vehicle from 1999. ""After the Sunset"" suffers from a lack of almost everything that ""Affair"" had -- style, sexiness, a tight plot and solid direction, a few unexpected twists, and a female lead who doesn't look way too young for the 50-plus Brosnan.

The main focus of the plot seems to be lingering on the beauty of the Bahamas and the swank surroundings Max and Lola glide through. Occasionally Max uses improbable hi-tech robbery tools. Not a bad tour, really. But you can only eat so much cotton candy before wanting a steak. Otherwise, it gets obscenely boring -- no thrills. Eventually the strained plot tries to give itself some twists, like Lola threatening to seek the high life AWAY from Max. But you never actually believe that she will.

Brosnan doesn't stretch any new acting muscles, but he's charming and suave in a Bond-ish, Remington-Steele-ish way. Salma Hayek does much better, giving the film some bikini shots, yet offering an innocent charm whens she talks about a tennis instructor complimenting her ""backside."" Don Cheadle is embarrassing as a local gangster, and Harrelson gives a decent enough performance as the bumbling agent.

""After the Sunset"" has two good actors, but misuses them in a plot that is overstretched and overstrained. ""To Catch a Thief""? How about ""To Catch A Break.""",1101600000,8,2451,4.7552941176470584
