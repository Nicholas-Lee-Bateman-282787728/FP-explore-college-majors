8603121,5,B000BMXY6Y,"If you are interested in learning more about the Perigord or thinking about visiting the region, this DVD will give you the experience you are looking for.  The film is a true feast for the eyes.  Some of the content in the DVD includes the prehistoric sites and cave drawings found in the region, magnificent aerial shots of some of the Perigord's numerous castles and medieval villages.  Another treat in the movie is a medieval musical performance.

The DVD highlights some of the culinary delights of the Perigord such as the cepes mushrooms (it shows some of the secrets of foraging them) and walnut oil, strawberries and of course foie gras.

The movie is one hour long and is in French with English subtitles.  It is in NTSC format so you can watch it on American DVD players.  I've visited the Perigord several times and this film informs and captures the magic of the region.",1304985600,,884,4.664516129032258
