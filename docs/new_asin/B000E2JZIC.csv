8104567,4,B000E2JZIC,"If you remember your first love then you will find this romantic fantasy of a young girl in search of fulfilling that love quite engaging. Beautiful setting, some fairly good acting and interesting story with two unexpected twists. Hint: (1.)  What happens to the father of the girl. (2.) And, of course, the ending.",1236124800,,316,4.851851851851852
