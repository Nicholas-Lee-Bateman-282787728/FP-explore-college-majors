8072102,5,B000A1INFI,"I actually found this film by chance, but what a film to find!!!  You cannot watch it without crying, at some point in the story.  It is so human, so real, and yet as you might cry, you may also find yourself chuckling or bursting into laughter.  A great, great film!!!  Love it...",1338595200,,281,4.245283018867925
8072103,5,B000A1INFI,"Original title ""Un difetto di famiglia"". Made for Italian TV. A heart warming story of two brothers, brought together, after some 40 years of silent separation, on the sad occasion of their mother's funeral. This charming comedy has a slightly surreal but quaint touch to it. Even though she's in the Afterlife, Mom still has a few things to say and wishes to utter. Pretty soon this turns into a road movie with plenty of surprises and revelations in store for the brothers. It's a joy to watch Lino Banfi and Nino Manfredi (the Family Flaw) warming up to one another as they travel to their mother's final resting place and ultimately bond as brothers once again. Both actors deliver very fine and affecting performances. The large supporting cast (including the adorable Yorkie) is very good. The celebrated composer Ennio Morricone supplied a lovely score. Photography is beautiful. The DVD offers optional English dubbed or original Italian versions. English subtitles for both. Unless you speak Italian fluently I'd recommend the English version, which is quite good and matching. If you go with Italian plus English subtitles you will soon discover that the subtitles lag a bit behind the actual dialogue. WideScreen.",1306281600,,1224,5.0945273631840795
8072104,4,B000A1INFI,"This is a situation comedy that could have been only sub par, had it not been for some very good acting. That alone raises the bar on it and makes it entirely worthwhile to see. It can be overly manipulative (a  speech on diversity) and a bit silly at times (a coffin bobbing up and down a river after it slides out of the back of a hearse), but there are also scenes that have a great power to them, thanks to the talent of the great actors here. I thoroughly recommend this film for anyone wanting some laughs as well as some ""meat"" to their story. It is not a ""gay"" oriented film, but has much to say about how all of us are different and that no one has a right to judge anyone else until they know the whole story! Tolerance? Yes. Diversity? Yes. So, I certainly recommend it as a good night's entertainment and for anyone who may be looking for something a little different. Bright and breezy fun that amazingly, Hollywood hasn't copied.",1265500800,,943,4.297752808988764
