8396157,5,B003FTM19Q,Surprisingly well done for a made for TV movie! One of the best adaptions of a classic story I have ever seen!  Great acting! Great effects!,1453248000,,140,4.384615384615385
8396158,5,B003FTM19Q,This is the best version of Pinocchio I've seen to date.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  While there are other copies of this version on Amazon that are only specific to regions 2 and 4 this copy is an all regions copy meaning it can play in any DVD player anywhere in the world.  The only thing I saw wrong with this copy of the film is it has no main menu.  It is also split up into two parts although both parts are on the same DVD so it can be a little confusing when you watch it for the first time and the credits role after the first part concludes.  However the second part starts right up after the credits are done for the first part so these are no major issues.  Other than that the movie itself plays fine and its also an English version of the film which is a big plus.  As I said before I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes Pinocchio.  Thank you Amazon for manufacturing this on Demand.  I've been looking for an English all regions version of this film to own since I heard about it and saw it the first time.,1432512000,3,1052,4.067961165048544

8396160,5,B003FTM19Q,"This is a delightful adaptation of the Pinocchio tale and I can't think of a better actor to play Pinocchio than Robbie Kay (Peter Pan in Once Upon a Time and more).  He plays perfectly and to a tee the rascally puppet/boy who desperately wants to become a real boy but keeps falling into the wrong adventures.  It starts off with the author Carlo Collodi promising his publisher a new children's story but has no clue as what to write about.  He brings in a carpenter to repair the broken leg of his desk.  The carpenter by the name of Geppetto says that it is a fine hard wood that has life in it.  Collodi comes up with his story of a carpenter who recently lost both his wife and baby son and in loneliness makes a puppet to keep him company unknowingly out of the wood that is alive within and the rest is history.  Bob Hoskins (Who Framed roger Rabbit) does an excellent job as Geppetto.  In fact the entire cast works well together.  The only disappointment was the special effect of the giant shark/whale which looked like something out of the 50's. This was also a TV production which I didn't realize and it took me for a moment when in the middle of the film the end credits came up but the second half started right up.  It is also regions 2/4 which means it will not play on most U.S. DVD/Blue Ray plays unless you have a region free unit.  I don't know why this wasn't made in a region 1 or region free version.  But again, I don't know why we have region coding anyway.  I give the film because it is just plain good and entertaining.",1423353600,3,1549,4.249146757679181
