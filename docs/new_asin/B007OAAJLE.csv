A real offense to the extraordinarily beautiful genre of operetta theatre is
By Oppicelli Ernesto on 11 Dec 2014In Italy we could call this tv version of the Straus' masterpiece simply '' una americanata ''. I have smiled throughout the complete watching without being angry as it does not sound as an offense to the original work: it's simply something else. Ah s: moltissimo 'something else'! A real offense to the extraordinarily beautiful genre of operetta theatre is, for example, a BAJADERE performed recently at the Budapest Operetta Theater or DIE HERZOGIN VON CHICAGO presented - imagine that! - by the viennese Volksoper. Roba da chiodi! Here Rise Stevens seems to amuse herself playing just for fun and singing beautifully as she was capable of. The splendid original music and the orchestrations by the composer have given way to Irwin Kostal's useless and very pompous new arrangements (those choruses murmuring during the singing are unbearable) - highfaluting humbug if I say the right words. The story is more familiar with the original story than the film with Nelson Eddy, but it sounds silly and crazy as an aim to believe that operettas must be nonsensical and stupid things with no harm for anybody. The sense of humour is forgotten and stupidity is at leisure owing to the ''intelligent'' arrangers. If you visit theatres nowadays you can even see worse than that, unfortunately. The Comic opera of Berlin, Germany, presented a BALL IN SAVOY by Abraham impossible to be recognized if you had the chance of knowing it. Well, let's think about miracles: in Ohio you can find a theatre where they have the extraordinarily great courage of performing operettas and musicals in their perfect original form - evviva Wooster! Every now and then my friends the americans may offer cds of musicals in their original form (Kern's SITTING PRETTY, Rodgers & Hart's DEAREST ENEMY ... ) and the european label cpo goes on offering unusual and forgotten operettas always in their original form (Lehar's EVA, WO DIE LERCHE SINGT, DIE BLAUE MAZUR .... etc). So, in conclusion: if you are an operetta lover get this CHOCOLATE SOLDIER watch it just once, forget it and buy the 2-cd-set of the Ohio Light Opera Company, or, should you ever be in contact with collectors, try to enjoy the radio versions conducted by Max Schnherr and Siegfried Bhler - these are of course in german and the original title is DER TAPFERE SOLDAT. Be happy with operettas!

8519825,5,B007OAAJLE,The is a great presentation of The Chocolate Soldier.  Rise Stevens is charming and worked well off Eddie Albert.  Doug,1369180800,2,119,4.9

8519827,5,B007OAAJLE,"This is a DVD version of a television classic. The plot is light hearted and romantic, based on George Bernard Shaw's novel Arms and Men. The producers have done a remarkable job at reproducing a television version made in 1955. For those of you who lived through the 1950s you will appreciate this restoration of a classic. According to one critic, Eddie Albert looked ""tubby."" In reproducing black and white television for today's screen everybody looks ""tubby."" The producers did an outstanding job with the sound of Rise Stevens singing ""My Hero"" three times in the production. A top mezzo-soprano at the Met for two decades, she is at the height of her career at age 42 in this version of the opera. Who cares that she is not twenty-something. This is about wonderful singing. The bad is that Eddie Albert can't sing. The good is that Stevens drowns him out. You won't be disappointed.",1345248000,9,890,4.748387096774193
8519828,2,B007OAAJLE,"As a fan of the old musicals I was looking forward to this one, but it was hugely disappointing.  A tubby Eddie Albert was an unlikely hero, Rise Stevens looked far too old for the romantic female role and  the plot is extremely weak, not uncommon in musicals, but the songs and the singers can usually overcome this.  Not this time.",1344902400,4,333,4.426229508196721
