8022929,5,B00026L87G,"This is an excellent DVD on coaching running backs from a coach with a proven track record at The University of Nebraska. This DVD contains some good pointers and drills that you can use to increase the game productivity of your running backs. I have coached at the middle school, high school, and college levels and can't think of a coach or an athlete that could not benefit and improve by the  purchase of this DVD.",1286150400,,418,4.5
