8576659,5,B00C2RAOGE,"One of the best operas I have ever seen. Everything was great. The Music, the singing the acting, the sets and the story. Who ever said that Bellini couldn't keep up with Verdi as master storyteller and  composer didn't see this performance Bravo!!!!!",1395878400,,251,4.837209302325581
8576660,3,B00C2RAOGE,"Beatrice di Tenda is really a wonderful opera, and I wish it were given more performances. In terms of commercial DVD's there is little choice out there, we have the 2002 Zurich production with the lovely Edita Gruberova, and now this performance from Catania 2009. The main point of interest here is the soprano, and in the title role we have Dimitra Theodossiou although I think she manages the role fairly well, she may not be to everyone's taste. Her voice is not as flexible as Gruberova or dare I say Sutherland, and she really has some problems with intonation, she seems to take it all in stride and punches along with little sense of belcanto line hitting some thrilling if out of tune high notes along the way. I admire her for making the effort at this stage in her career, she is obviously more comfortable singing the early Verdi roles, and Bellini's long lines seem to challenge her at times. The rest of the cast support her well, if not memorably, and the production is boring and inept, and not very visually attractive. If you make this purchase it would be to see another production of Bellini's great opera, and to hear Theodossiou take on the challenge of Beatrice.",1372636800,6,1186,4.625592417061611
8576661,4,B00C2RAOGE,"I'd been waiting for an ""upgrade"" from my DVD of Bellini's Beatrice Di Tenda for some time now ... not that the Zurich Opera/Edita Gruberova offering from TDK was bad, but ... well, my review of that DVD is only a few clicks away.

After my initial viewing of this new Blu Ray version of the opera, I am glad I didn't get around to selling my Zurich recording.

My overall first impression is that these two versions (the only two versions presently available) are basically, for different reasons, on par with each other.

Concerning this new offering from Dynamic, first among its  strong points are that it is a Blu Ray release, and the audio and video quality are fine indeed.  The three standard sound formats are offered, and my choice of the HD DTS sounded very good.  The video image is what one has come to expect as well ... which leads me to another positive aspect of this Blu Ray disk - the colorful dresses worn by Ms. Theodossiou, Ms. Lo Monaco, the ladies chorus, and the dancers are very nice to look at, providing a dramatic contrast with the men, all dressed in black tuxedos or long black coats ... not sure what the dancers are doing out there, but they are nonetheless a pleasant addition to the production.
When Ms. Lo Monaco is lying in a bed of flowers while singing ""Ah! Non pensar che pieno"", the experience is both visually and sonically satisfying ... until the 'structure' that occupies the middle of the stage for most of the opera is lowered back down - at this point, one can discern a mechanical sound that is a little bit of a detriment.  This structure itself is, for the most part, an interesting addition to the whole effort.  Different images are projected upon it throughout the production, usually to fine effect.

In general, I enjoy the use of visual projections which add scenery and other elements to our opera productions.

My reservations concerning this production center mostly on the singing ... I am usually quite hesitant to nit pick about the singing in an opera ... just to make it on stage, let alone to have it end up on a recording, requires more talent and training than I'll ever have (obviously :-)

Specifically, Mr. Kalmandi (as Filippo) seemed to struggle somewhat with the music ... his vocal tone seemed just seemed a bit too low (I wish I could expound in a more acedemic manner than this). A word that comes to mind regarding his tone is 'heavy' ... yikes ... I feel uncomfortable pointing this out due to a relative lack of expertise compared to some our other, more learned reviewers, but anyway ... one thing I can say though is that Michael Volle's performance on the Zurich DVD was alot easier on the ears.

In the lead role of Beatrice, Ms. Theodossiou was generally OK, but I enjoyed Edita Gruberova's performance (even if somewhat past her prime) better.  Early on in the aria ""Il mio dolore e l'ira"", Ms. Theodossiou throws in a really high note where I've never heard one before - and it seemed so out of place I'm not sure if it was a mistake or an ill advised piece of improvisation on her part.

Pet peeve ... designing the 'chapters' of the Blu Ray disc ... it seemed that some degree of disregard was involved with where the chapters begin and end .  A case in point is, again, with the aria ""Il mio dolore e l'ira"".  There is an instrumental interlude which serves as a wonderful introduction to the aria which ends up being the last 2:17 of the previous chapter, resulting in an abrupt beginning of the aria if one is to search for it, wanting to listen to it specifically.
If my wife enjoyed opera as much as I do, I wouldn't have to sometimes hear just bits and pieces as much, and the chapter editing/organization wouldn't be such a big deal (ah! love that half hour she takes to get ready for bedtime ... queue up the Blu Ray player!).

In conclusion, it's always nice to have another release of a Bellini opera ... I'm very happy with my Norma(Fiorenza Cedolins), I Puritani(JDF & Nino Machaidze), I Capuleti(Valentina Farcas), and La Sonnambula(both the Natalie Dessay & JDF and the Eglise Gitierrez offerings) ... but this new Blu Ray of Beatrice Di Tenda leaves me looking forward to a more satisfying release, hopefully, in the future ... 3 stars for the production/Blu Ray quality, plus 1 star for Bellini and his beautiful melodies.",1370563200,7,4327,4.5482625482625485
