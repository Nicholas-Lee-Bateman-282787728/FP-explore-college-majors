2521887,5,B000ELJ3E4,"My family watched the DVD last night and it is a great film. It is everything we expected it to be. It really evokes some strong emotions (my daughter started crying), and it delivers this legacy of the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw tribes and other indian people of the area in a frank, straight forward manner.

Wes Studi does a wonderful job, and speaks the Cherokee language eloquently as the story of the Cherokee trail of tears unfolds in a long over-due examination of this Cherokee legacy. James Earl Jones' presence is a strong statement in itself, not to mention his unique way of making almost anything interesting and he adds a feeling of authenticity to the film. The closed captioning is a definite plus and the beauty of the scenery in the Cherokee's ancestral homelands was breathtaking.

A big thanks go to the Cherokee Tribe and to Rich-Heape Films, Inc. for granting Public Performance Rights to schools and libraries. I will be sending a copy to my sister today. She is the principal at the Wakpala Indian School in South Dakota. She puts the videos and music into the School Library system where they are made available to the students who check them out like they do books.",1141948800,185,1194,4.735576923076923

Of course, I loved that it was narrated by James Earl Jones, and I found the visuals beautiful. II do agree the Cherokee Legacy should go on forever:)  However, I was looking for a more historical, fact ridden approach for my son's Trail of Tears section of U.S. History.

2521914,4,B000ELJ3E4,"This video was an awesome chance to bring the Trail of Tears to life. I've been working on a research project about it, and so far, the research has been cerebral, in a sense. Facts, facts, facts. This video had a nice balance of facts, but also a personal touch, to bring faces to the facts. I really appreciated the easy chronological flow it had to it. It was also very sad to watch. Our nation has a huge scar in its history because of this event, and I think this video was very informative about what happened.",1349308800,,516,4.275510204081633

2521916,4,B000ELJ3E4,"There's a lot of educational value in this DVD about the ""Trail of Tears"": that in which American Indians of the southeastern region were told they had to give up their homes and march to an undesirable westward location. Definitely one of the black spots in American History: beat up another culture, made them feel like secondary citizens at best and then take their lands when it was convenient. Worse, we banished them with a hostile military escort that didn't do much for them and probably contributed to the smallpox epidemic a la used blankets given to them. Note that this DVD focuses only on the Cherokee Tribe but the ""Trail of Tears"" was over an extended period of time and included several tribes from the southeast.

CASUALTIES: 4,000 of the 15,000 Cherokee died during the march of roughly one thousand miles. One family recounts the beating of parents trying to be saved from their 14 year old daughter being gang raped by indifferent soldiers. The parents, who kept trying to save their daughter, were beaten down like animals.

It has also been claimed by descendants of the survivors that the term ""Trail of Tears"" referred to the tears of those who witnessed the suffering of the marchers, and that the Native Americans themselves marched in silence (Wiki source).

While the narrative flow can be dry at times I'd say this is worth watching just to impart what was done back in the day and if that means we as a people are less likely to commit such acts then it's time well spent.

2521917,5,B000ELJ3E4,"TRAIL OF TEARS: CHEROKEE LEGACY This documentary explores one of the great historical tragedies of America's aboriginal people. In 1830, eager to gain access to lands inhabited by Native Americans, President Andrew Jackson enacted the Indian Removal Act which forced the Cherokee Nation to leave their homeland and relocate into unchartered territory. Many of these forced settlers suffered from exposure, disease and starvation and upon arriving in Indian Territory, they arrived with no past and no future.",1330300800,,508,5.6103896103896105
2521918,5,B000ELJ3E4,"This is an excellent film for anyone interested in learning about the history of the tribes that were removed from their ancestral lands.

It is comprenhensive and has some excellent scholars and credible historians providing great detail as to what led to the historical atrocity known as the Trail of Tears.

Many people died during the summer of 1838 and it seemed few cared about this. No one attempted to really stop it which is the sad part about it.

It is believed that at least 4,000 Cherokee Indian people died during the removals to the west. This is a historical fact that few people seem to be aware of.

It is a sad reality that must be faced and restituion is most certainly due to those involved in this genocidal aspect of American history.

I find it almost amazing to know that this occurred less than 200 years ago and that so very few people seem to know or care about what happened. Genocide is ugly but is has a face that will never go away.",1328313600,,964,4.423728813559322

2521920,5,B000ELJ3E4,"Had ordered this DVD as a Christmas present for my Mom & had also picked it up at my local Library to watch for myself.

Yes, this was a very educational film & I actually learned quite a bit, but certain there's more to be told.

Reason in the Title line I had put 'a scene that made me chuckle' (since by any means this film isn't happy) is this:

While watching the film I had noticed this in Chapter 8:  When the scroll comes onto the sceen for: ""The Words of: A Cherokee Citizen Position"", count to about 18-20 seconds & in the shot, on the right hand side, you see an eldery woman what appears to be a silver digital camera tied off to her waist :) Other than that little flaw, it was a very good documentary.",1323388800,,715,4.085714285714285
2521921,5,B000ELJ3E4,"Again. this is a great teaching aid for maybe middle school or even high school students.
 It gives a new slant on history as it is being told from the Cherokee viewpoint. Most history books in the public domain have very little or just a passing sentence or two about something that is a great shame in the history our nation.
 Don't forget the Trail of Tears or the losses of a gentle people whose only crime was just being Indian....and what greed can cause.",1308009600,,461,4.411764705882353

2521923,5,B000ELJ3E4,"It's amazing how much or our nation's history was left out of my elementary and high school education.

2521924,4,B000ELJ3E4,"This was a good documentary. I learned a few things about the Cherokee Indians that I did not know.
I found it interesting that there were black slaves that made the journey to the west with the Indians.
I guess the stories about blacks having some Indian blood in them are probably true as I can now see how it was possible.",1296950400,,325,4.258064516129032
2521925,5,B000ELJ3E4,The Trail of Tears: Cherokee Legacy - This DVD tells the tale of the Cheorkee people and the way they were treated in The years of the forward movement of the New American Government Stealing land to Give to The Georgia Aristocrats of the American Southland.  They then took these established lands which were wonder Communal farms and turned them in to Slave Plantations after shipping the Cherokees off to Oklahoma and represented colonialism that we have grown to associate with our American Legacy.,1287705600,5,502,4.976190476190476
2521926,5,B000ELJ3E4,I have researched this debate for three years for a Masters dissertation focussing on Andrew Jackson and Georgia's role in removal. It was a real treat to see on screen many historians whose works I have read and whose opinions I value. The film is historically accurate and brings home the injustice perpetrated on the Cherokees. My only wish is that I had this disc at the beginning of my research rather than at the end. I recommend this film to anyone who wishes to know the true facts and who better to tell the story than Wes Studi and James Earl Jones.,1283212800,7,559,4.436893203883495
2521927,5,B000ELJ3E4,This movie was wonderful.  We have no idea what these people suffered just to try and remain free and keep the land that was theirs.  We should all feel shame at what the founding fathers did to the American Indian. Everyone should watch this film.,1265068800,5,248,4.488888888888889
2521928,5,B000ELJ3E4,"This is a very well presented documentary of one of our most well known American tragedies, the frced removal of the Cherokees - the trail of tears.  Presenter Wes Studi brings to DVD the gripping story shown with real life actors demonstrating how the Cherokees developed not only their culture, but also a society based on the American model complete with a constitution, government, alphabet, ecomony, and everything else a society entails.  The film also shows a dark side of American history too many are willing to ignore or gloss over.  It shows what happens when one culture desires what another has, and will do whatever it takes to make sure the other culture is displaced.  Greed and corruption were the driving force behind the forced removal of natives to Oklahoma.

This film shows what happens when a government, allegedly based on freedom and liberty for all, decides it can remove those who possesss what it wants for its own people.  There should be a degree of shame and acceptance for the actions of our forefathers who participated and who drafted the laws that enabled this tragedy to occur.  Instead we get morons like William Bennett who write history that glosses over what it refers to as myths.

Indian removal was not limited to the Cherokee.  This film touches on some of the other forced removals, the Creeks, Chickasaws, and Seminoles, but it could have added the Kickapoo, the Fox, the Sauk, the Wyandots, the Potawatomies, and a dozen other native tribes who had the misfortune of residing east of the Mississippi River between 1830 and 1845.  This film also delivers a powerful message that there often is no liberty and justice for all, and men are not created equal.  We need to question our Christian beliefs that preach peace on earth and goodwill toward men, but likewise allow for one race to dominate another simply because it can.  Towards the end of the film one of the speakers says one legacy of the trail of tears is to make sure it doewsn't happen again.  Well, it did happen.  Indian removal transition into the west in the second half of the 19th Century, Japanese-Americans were displaced from their homes in the 1940s.  The question thus becomes when will it happen again and to what group of people?

But regardless of personal opinions, this is a well done movie.  The Trail of Tears comes alive, though for practical reasons the actors couldn't be asked to follow the course of the real trail of tears.  What was presented as Indians on the trail is sanitized for both viewing and production reasons.  But this doesn't detract from the film's message.  It is important to teach this to our children, rather than just showing the imperialistic conquests of a people supposedly favored by God to do his work.  This should be shown on network television, but it probably never will be.",1262390400,8,2836,4.782340862422998
2521929,5,B000ELJ3E4,"Once again, this is an excellent movie.  It is so hard to believe our distant relatives were so evil and inhumane.  This was THEIR country.  They have more rights to it than we should have.  It should at least be equal.",1249344000,4,219,4.2682926829268295
2521930,5,B000ELJ3E4,I got this for a gift for my mom because of her cherokee ancestors. I have not seen it but she enjoyed it.,1240185600,2,106,3.652173913043478

2521932,5,B000ELJ3E4,"In this movie, presented like a documentary, we learn volumes about the Cherokee nation at the time of Jackson's Indian Removal Act. We learn for example that the Cherokee were willing to comply with the Whites' way of life : even though I knew it that some of them had turned into farmers, I was surprised to see them dressed like the Whites. The film focuses on the excruciating and perilous journey from Georgia to Oklahoma. It also dwells on the politicians' contradictory statements. Indeed, the Cherokee were denied the right to keep on tilling their lands after they had been prompted to do so. Definitely, you must see it!",1217203200,7,630,4.736363636363636
2521933,5,B000ELJ3E4,"This video is more a documentary with historical perspectives than a movie for entertainment.  It was very informative and I honestly enjoyed watching it.

2521934,5,B000ELJ3E4,"I am a Cherokee from Oklahoma now living in Colorado. In this movie, what you will get is not a classic western but the tragic truth about a people that regardless of their ability to adapt, to welcome their distant neighbours and indeed to welcome and to even embrace progress clearly displaying this adaptability to change were nevertheless out of greed driven out of their own homeland and nearly driven to extinction only to once again, adapt to change and once again, many are succeeding.",1211846400,19,493,4.811764705882353
2521935,5,B000ELJ3E4,"Liked how the speaking documentaries were interspersed with the re-created scenes.  My favorite parts were Wes Studi's as he spoke in the Cherokee language (subtitled in English).  It just added authenticism to this work.  Also, the fact that different well-known actors were the voices at various parts of the film.  Didn't know that James Earl Jones was half Cherokee, and he did a nice job as well.  I plan to share my copy with friends and family.  Definitely a story Americans should know, especially those of us living in/around Appalachia.",1200355200,9,546,5.011111111111111
2521936,4,B000ELJ3E4,I used this video as an instructional supplement for my classroom unit on westward expansion and initial confrontations between the nascent United States and Native nations.  The information presented is detailed and clearly presented.  The use of the Cherokee language by Wes Studi really drives home to urban high school students that this culture is still very much alive.  There are some production issues that detract from the overall story such as during the recreation of the Trail of Tears the participants clearly have tennis shoes on and from a teaching vantage it hurts the credibility of the film as visual literature.  I will be using the film again because it is an excellent product.,1199577600,8,698,5.043478260869565
2521937,5,B000ELJ3E4,A wonderful historical based movie that I will watch for the next 10 years.  I am sorry the indians were treated so badly by out ancestors.,1198886400,5,139,4.346153846153846

It is a documentary and uses actors to portray some historical characters and you can hear comments from some people who could be termed 'experts' in this area.  I liked being able to hear from an ancestor of John Ross and the past leader of the Cherokee nation, Wilma Mankiller, as well as  the present principal chief, Chad Smith. Atleast he was the chief at the time of the film.

  There were also other university people and Cherokee tribal members who gave some thoughts and anecdotes.  The program was hosted by Wes Studi, one of my favorite actors, who did a part of the narration, speaking in his own native tongue, Cherokee!  I liked that part. James Earl Jones, who is part Cherokee, does the general narration.

The DVD wasn't quite what I expected, some of it seemed a little low-budget to me, but it's a good overview of an American story that should be told.  So I recommend it for that.",1176249600,18,981,4.497175141242938
