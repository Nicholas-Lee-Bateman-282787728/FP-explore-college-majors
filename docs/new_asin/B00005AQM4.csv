7935746,5,B00005AQM4,"The Fable of a Duckling Who Went His Own Way
By Walter Goodman

Harvey Fierstein, the bard of ''Torch Song Trilogy,'' delivers a fairy tale. That does not represent a coming-out from the literary closet (he has never been one to conceal his predilections), but it is a sort of cross-dressing. His latest offering, a fable called ''The Sissy Duckling,'' is modeled on Hans Christian Andersen's famous ''Ugly Duckling.''

Elmer, the spunky hero of this animated fable, is by no means ugly; he's cute and something of a smart aleck, but the other ducklings pick on him because he's no good at baseball. Elmer prefers to play with dolls. His father, the sort of duck dad who hangs around watching sports on television, despairs of him: ''He's no son of mine.'' The voice belongs to Ed Asner, that tough duck.

Elmer laments that he wants to be like all the other ducklings, but ''considering my options,'' baseball isn't in his future. His supportive mother tells him not to worry about name-calling but to follow his own heart.

It will surprise few viewers of whatever age to learn that Elmer turns out to be no sissy. Confronted by cold weather and duck hunters, he comes through heroically. When a sacrifice is called for, Elmer doesn't strike out.

The narrator, Sharon Stone, keeps insisting that like all of us, Elmer is ''different.'' That is, we are all unique, or as she says at one point, ''most unique.'' You get it. Even daddy duck gets it by the end of this short show.

The bright animation includes a duck ballet; the songs, rendered by Mr. Fierstein and Dionne Warwick, are determinedly edifying (''Listen to Your Heart'' and ''There's No One Exactly Like Me''); Elmer's dialogue is snappy.

Homosexuality is never mentioned, and the only people who are likely to be upset by this tribute to ducklings who march to their own non-macho drummers are the anti-gay, family-values quackers. When Elmer sings, ''I play by my own set of rules,'' it is enough to send William J. Bennett into a stew.
