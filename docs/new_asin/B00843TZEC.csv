5130078,5,B00843TZEC,"I've been waiting 15 years for Space Adventure Cobra and countless emails to Urban Vision pleading with them to release this on DVD. For whatever reasons, they didn't and their license expired. Perhaps the rights got tied up and they were unable to do so. The original VHS release in the US was around 1996 and goes for silly money and I was never going to pay second hand sellers hundreds of dollars even though this valuable movie warrants it.

Fans will be glad to know that Space Adventure Cobra includes the fan favourite Streamline Dub in Stereo, as well as the choice between a Japanese 5.1 or 2.0, depending on your audio equipment and preferences.

The video quality is literally stunning and probably the best anime remastering I've ever seen on DVD. Apparently Discotek got Blu-ray masters from the Japanese domestic release and used these rather than doing a port of the Japanese DVD release. Also the video is progressive scan like all Discotek releases and is in Anamorphic Widescreen.

Considering this came out in 1982, it transcends most contemporary anime in detail and color, literally jumping off the screen. This motion picture can be considered a standalone entry since it's nothing like the TV series. The Cobra motion picture is a serious, space opera sci fi, there's almost no comedy in this at all. Instead there are genuine moments of sadness and emotion as you become attached to characters with a less than happy fate. The whole movie is wrapped up in mystery and you'll be completely mystified and engaged all throughout this 99 minute story
Considering the VHS sellers are still trying to make a bundle of this property, I think the DVD is a steal. Get this before it goes out of print. This is a must see for newcomers and experienced fans. Every person deserves to see this movie at least once in their life.

5130080,5,B00843TZEC,"Wrote a full review found here: http://www.fandompost.com/2012/08/10/space-adventure-cobra-the-movie-anime-dvd-review/ But left a couple quick points below:

Audio:
The audio presentation for this release comes with the Japanese mix in 5.1 which sounded decent from what I could tell. There are also Japanese 2.0 and English 2.0 Dolby tracks present and both sounded fine on my system.

Video:
The movie was originally released theatrically in 1982, and the video converted here from the Japanese blu-ray release looks gorgeous. Its very nice for animation fans to appreciate the detail that went into the artwork as well as the various techniques used at the time. The subtitles are colored and detailed appropriately, which makes them easy to read as needed.

In Summary:
Despite some of the grumbles I have here, its really nice to own this DVD. Id have liked a few more features, but the movie is the most important element of discussion. The presentation is very nice to watch for the first time in its entirety so Im willing to overlook a couple things that a fanboy (such as myself) might want.",1450828800,2,1101,5.139664804469274

5130095,5,B00843TZEC,"Just received my copy of Space Adventure Cobra in the mail and couldn't hesitate to watch it immediately (in English). Last time watching was more than 15 years ago, old VHS version, and was one of the cornerstone pieces of my anime watching career. I just have to say, this is a must have for any Cobra fan and the film/audio quality is much better than the old VHS.

Pros:
1. Original English track (same as old US VHS release).
2. Japanese tracks; both Dolby 5.1 and 2.0
3. Audio quality for English track is excellent
4. Film transfer quality is excellent, you can throw your VHS copy out the door!!!
5. Nice DVD menu, nothing extravagant but it gets the job done.
6. Some interesting trailers are included for other anime from back in the day.

I have not had a chance to watch a second time in Japanese w/subtitles but soon!

Cons:
1. At times there are minor film transfer issues, it can get blurry and/or discolored at the left or right of the screen. I don't recall if this is also a problem in the original VHS or if it is intentional but it is noticeable.

2. I did not see that the trailer for Space Adventure Cobra was also included; would have been a nice addition.

Overall, definitely buy this ASAP if you are a fan of this film!!!",1370995200,6,1247,4.334763948497854
5130096,5,B00843TZEC,A classic sci-fi animation that was fun and witty.  A b class movie for a Saturday afternoon.  What more can I say.,1368057600,4,115,4.181818181818182
5130097,5,B00843TZEC,"If you are a fan of the golden age of anime. (late 80's early 90's pre-cgi) and haven't seen this movie BUY IT!  If you liked Golgo 13/Fist of the North Star/Demon City Shinjuku etc....It is not as violent or rape-y as the previously mentioned titles... but it is about twice as weird.  Awesome imagery, tight action, star nipples, if this one doesn't have it, you don't need it!",1360022400,9,379,4.478260869565218

8524951,4,B00843TZEC,"A retelling of several episodes from the middle of the series' story arc.  If for any reason you're not sure you'd like the show (although I mean seriously, how could you not?), start with this movie.  If you've already seen the show, I'm not sure the movie will be entirely worthwhile unless you're a relentless devourer of media like myself ^__^",1512691200,,347,4.672131147540983
8524952,5,B00843TZEC,"I am not a fan of Anime. That needed to be said, sure I liked Akira and Samurai Champloo is amazing, but I'm not a fan of the genre. I cherry pick the classics that are up my alley, like Ninja Scroll and Cowboy Bebop.

This movie though... this is a work of art.

I'm a huge fan of 70s/80s scifi, especially Moebius. This is like watching a French Scifi graphic novel from the early 80s unfold on screen.

The music and artwork are so unique that I cannot recommend this enough to scifi/fantasy fans of the era",1500681600,2,510,4.183673469387755
