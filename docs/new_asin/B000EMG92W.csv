8111145,1,B000EMG92W,"Just awful. The first video is a ""Three Stooges"" approach to water safety. Important water safety points are discussed, but they get lost in the slap-stick comedy routines. The second video would be great to show 6-8 year olds that are going fishing for the first time, but has very little value beyond that age group. Suggest you do not waste your money as I did on this video.",1252627200,,378,4.492753623188406
