8377151,4,B002PNU2LC,"Very odd film - but it's meant to be.  A little disappointing if you're expecting the Dylan Moran from Black Books, but still quirkily entertaining.",1482710400,,148,4.92
8377152,4,B002PNU2LC,"German region BluRay was the only way to get a hard copy of the film. The English language audio is an available option. Aside from a compulsory set of trailers for German language films before the menu, no issues.",1465516800,,214,4.512820512820513
8377153,5,B002PNU2LC,Maybe I've got a warped sense of humor  -----  but I thought this movie was hilarious. Needless to say it is a black comedy. If anything can go wrong --- IT DOES ---- in the worst of ways. The 2 main characters are priceless. My first time seeing either one of them. I plan to seek out other movies in which these 2 actors Dylan Moran and Mark Doherty are in.,1425081600,2,359,4.042253521126761
8377154,5,B002PNU2LC,One of the best movies I've ever seen. Dylan Moran is brilliant as always. Anyone who has enjoyed Black Books will love it!,1406419200,5,123,4.391304347826087
8377155,2,B002PNU2LC,"A story from Ireland of a cover-up of a set of deaths occurred freaky, implicating an innocent by-stander.

Desperately boring.",1334016000,2,127,5.35
8377156,4,B002PNU2LC,"As a fan of ""Black Books"" I greatly enjoyed this movie, Dylan Moran is always fun as his familiar style of character.  As the comedy revolves around people dying in odd, accidental ways it will not be a film for everyone.  However if you like black comedies and can handle a large dose of coincidental events I recommend this film highly.",1275004800,10,338,4.524590163934426
