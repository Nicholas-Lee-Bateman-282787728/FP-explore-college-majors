2997354,4,B000X25F78,"Rio Grande is a 1950 western film and the third installment of John Ford's ""cavalry trilogy"", following two RKO Pictures releases: Fort Apache (1948) and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949).

John Wayne stars in all three films, as Captain Kirby Yorke in Fort Apache, then as Captain of Cavalry Nathan Cutting Brittles in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and finally as a promoted Lieutenant Colonel Kirby Yorke in Rio Grande (the York/Yorke character's last name was spelled slightly differently in Fort Apache and Rio Grande).

The film is based on a short story ""Mission With No Record"" by James Warner Bellah, that appeared in the The Saturday Evening Post on September 27, 1947, and the screenplay was written by James Kevin McGuinness.[1][2]Ford wanted to make The Quiet Man first, but Republic Pictures studio president Herbert Yates, insisted that Ford make Rio Grande first, using the same combination of Wayne and Maureen O'Hara; Yates did not feel that the script of The Quiet Man was very good, and wanted Rio Grande to be released first to pay for The Quiet Man. (To Yates's surprise The Quiet Man, on its eventual release in 1952, would become Republic's number one film in terms of box office receipts

The film was shot in Monument Valley, and other locations in southeastern Utah around the town of Moab and along the Colorado River.[3]

In Rio Grande, Colonel Yorke is posted on the frontier to defend settlers against hostile Apaches. Col. Yorke is under considerable stress between the Apaches and the young-raw recruits sent to the post-in numbers far inadequate to the needs of his command.

Tension is added when Yorke's son (whom he hasn't seen in fifteen years), Trooper Jeff Yorke (Claude Jarman Jr.), is posted to the fort. Not wanting the other men to think he is favoring his son, he ends up being harder on him. Jeff is watched over by a pair of more seasoned troopers, Tyree (Ben Johnson) and Boone (Harry Carey Jr.).

With the arrival of the estranged Mrs. Kathleen Yorke (Maureen O'Hara) who has come to take the under-age Yorke home with her, even more tension is added. The Colonel and Mrs. Yorke figure out it would be best to let young Jeff grow up and make the decision whether to stay or leave for himself; he chooses to stay. The tension brought about in the fight for their son rekindles the love they once had for each other.

Yorke is visited by his former Civil War commander, Philip Sheridan (J. Carrol Naish), now Chief General of Army. Sheridan has decided to order Yorke to cross the Rio Grande into Mexico, an action with grave political problems since it could well be seen as an act of war against Mexico.

If Yorke fails in his mission to destroy the Apache threat he faces the threat of court-martial. Sheridan, in a quiet act of acknowledgment of what he is asking Yorke to risk, promises that the members of the court will be men who rode with Yorke through the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War. Yorke accepts the mission. Now Col. Yorke must fight to save, and put back together, his family and his honor.

Some aspects of the story, notably the regiment's crossing into Mexico, and undertaking a campaign there, loosely resemble the expedition conducted by the 4th Cavalry Regiment (United States) under Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie in 1873.",1228348800,47,3292,4.76140350877193

2997377,5,B000X25F78,"This collaboration - one of many - between the legendary director, John Ford, and the legendary actor, John Wayne, has many superlatives to recommend it. This was the third in a trilogy of excellent cavalry films directed by Ford and starring Wayne. While all are almost equal in terms of quality, this one is the best...my opinion of course. This was the first of five collaborations between Wayne and the fiery Irish redhead, Maureen O'Hara. ""THE QUIET MAN"" which immediately followed this one was also directed by Ford and was their best collaboration...this one is a close second. I do not know if anything was going on off-screen between these two, but their chemistry on-screen was palpable in this and their other movies. This film is probably the best portrayal of horse cavalry life during the Indian wars, from the day-to-day routine, to the training in preparation for battle and finally to the actual Indian fighting. One of the key ingredients in horse cavalry life was music...and that is superbly furnished in this film by the iconic, Sons of the Pioneers, whose lead singer at this time was none other than Ken Curtis (Festus Haggen on ""GUNSMOKE""). Curtis - who was also Fords son-in-law - had a beautiful voice and puts it on display in this film. Wayne is LtCol Kirby Yorke, a reprise of his character in ""FT APACHE"", the first film in the cavalry trilogy. He is charged with protecting Texas pioneers against the Apache along the Rio Grande. The Apache lived on both sides of the river and crossed back and forth freely. There is some basis in history for the cross-river raid conducted by LtCol York...a similar raid was fought by Col Ranald MacKenzie in 1873. In addition to Wayne and O'Hara, look for Claude Jarman, Jr (Jody in ""THE YEARLING"") who plays the young trooper son of Yorke; and several of Fords stock actors - Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr, Victor McLaglen, Chill Wills, etc. One of the finest of the Ford/Wayne collaborations...my highest recommendation.",1360281600,6,1988,4.85

2997381,3,B000X25F78,"This is the third, and the best, of the John Ford/John Wayne cavalry trilogy. Maybe it's because this one includes Maureen O'Hara, with whom John Wayne always worked so well. But mostly I think because the script has more going for it. The title refers to the fact that the outpost is only a few miles from the Rio Grande, which offers much frustration, because the policy is they cannot cross it, even in hot pursuit of renegades.

John Wayne is Lt. Col. Yorke, and the story opens with him being informed that his son (whom he has not seen since he was an infant) flunked math and was dropped from West Point. Later we learn that the reason he has not seen the boy or his mother in all that time was that Yorke, as a Yankee soldier, burned down her house during a raid on the Confederacy. She was a southerner, and has been bringing up her son as a southerner.

Then when new recruits arrive (18 when he had requested 180), his son is among them. Not long after that his estranged wife (O'Hara, of course) shows up, mostly to persuade Wayne to let his son out of the Army. Apparently she needed his signature to permit the application to go through, even though young Yorke had lied about his age to get in. But her son points out that the application would also require his signature, and he has no intention of signing.

One of my favorite scenes is when the new recruits are being instructed in horsemanship by the drill sergeant, and he asks whether any of them know anything about horses. Yorke and two of his southern friends show up the entire troop by accepting the sergeant's mocking challenge to ride ""like the Romans did,"" standing astride two horses. They even jump the horses while riding like this, the way some expert circus performers can do. Of course one knows they are stuntmen, and not the handsome young actors, but it's still quite a show.

These three southern fried boys are brave and they are wise-asses, and they make much of the lighter moments of the movie. One is being sought by the local sheriff for a horse thief. But he manages to hide when the sheriff comes to call, and Wayne protects him mostly because he's a very good soldier.

There are many women and children at the post, and by subterfuge, a band of renegade Indians manage to raid the fort and capture the children as hostages. They take them across the Rio Grande and impound them in an abandoned mission. Wayne risks being court-marshaled to go across, even though he had the tacit permission of the Mexican officer on the other side. Young Yorke and his two rebel cronies sneak into the mission and are able to hold off the Indians, diverting their attention while the cavalry comes charging over the hill in typical western movie style, bringing along wagons in which to rescue the children and kill enough Indians to get them away. Wayne takes an arrow in his chest, and his son has to pull it out.

All in all, it's a good but rather typical Wayne western. However, it is old enough that it is not imitating, but having been imitated since. I enjoyed it enough more than ""Yellow Ribbon"" to give it three stars.",1337385600,,3111,4.477954144620811

He's soon followed by his mother, York's estranged wife Kathleen (Maureen O'Hara in the first of their four team-ups), who wants to buy him out of his enlistment--but Jeff doesn't want to be bought.  Then Natchez's Apaches make a raid on the post and free him, and eventually York must rescue the post's children, who have been captured by the hostiles and taken across the river into Mexico.  Adding to the complications is the presence of Trooper Travis Tyree (Ben Johnson)--obviously not the same Tyree he played in ""Yellow Ribbon""--who besides being a buddy of Jeff's is being hunted for manslaughter by a U.S. Marshal (Grant Withers).  Harry Carey Jr. appears as Jeff and Travis's pal Sandy (it's tempting to wonder whether Travis and Sandy, after their hitches were up, teamed up to trade horses and guide Mormon settlers in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagon-Master/dp/B002BIULMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagon Master</a>), the inimitable Victor McLaglen as Sgt.

2997404,5,B000X25F78,"The last in Ford's cavalry trilogy, this is a very fine film. Ben Johnson's introduction into the cavalry as trooper Tyree features some stunning horsemanship and cements him as one of America's very best character actors. If you wanted a salt of the earth Texan - you could do no better. Maureen O'Hara puts in one of her best performances as Wayne's estranged wife and the Ford cavalry ensemble delivers another stunning portrayal of making the best of life in the rough. Wayne demonstrates, yet again, that he is not just a movie hero. The guy can act, and here he does it in spades. One can only assume that those disparaging his abilities either haven't seen his early stuff or they just disapprove of his politics. But the real hero of this fantastic movie is, of course, John Ford. He demonstrates, yet again, his total mastery of black and white - the nuances are so much more subtle than anything you can do in colour. But forget the arty stuff, what Ford was doing here was putting the lid on a series of movies that created an American mythology - where they came from and what it meant to be an American. And forget the carping hypocrites who rage about how it wasn't really like that. First, how do they know? Second, do they really think soldiers in King Arthur's time were anything like the Knights of the Round Table? Realism doesn't matter, this is the stuff dreams are made of, not to mention nations. Ford understood that and undertook his mission with a startling clarity and persistent integrity - that, coupled with his artistic flair, is what made him one of the greatest of directors.

The last film in John Ford's ""cavalry trilogy"" and, IMO, the best of the three. John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara are one of the great ""screen teams"" and they are in top form here. Wayne is ""Lt. Col. Yorke"", O'Hara is ""Kathleen"", his estranged wife, and Jarman is their son, who has enlisted in the Army and has been posted to his father's command. O'Hara has accompanied Jarman to his posting hoping to persuade his father to let her ""buy out"" his enlistment and return him to civilian life. To her chagrin, Jarman wants no part of that and refuses to allow it.

The film is ""classic Ford"". The characters are developed slowly and fully and, as always, the location photography is stunning---the film was shot in Moab, Utah. There is plenty of action involving an Apache uprising. McLaglen is a delight as the ""top kick"" for Wayne's unit. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr., give fine performances. The scene where Johnson, Carey, and Jarman ride teams of horses bareback, ""Roman style"", is just incredible---especially so given the fact that each actor is doing his own riding---no stunt-doubles for any of them. Ben Johnson, who was a National Champion Rodeo Cowboy prior to entering films, is probably the best horseman to ever appear in the movies.

(To Yates's surprise The Quiet Man, on its eventual release in 1952, would become Republic's number one film in terms of box office receipts

The film was shot in Monument Valley, and other locations in southeastern Utah around the town of Moab and along the Colorado River.[3]

In Rio Grande, Colonel Yorke is posted on the frontier to defend settlers against hostile Apaches. Col. Yorke is under considerable stress between the Apaches and the young-raw recruits sent to the post-in numbers far inadequate to the needs of his command.

Tension is added when Yorke's son (whom he hasn't seen in fifteen years), Trooper Jeff Yorke (Claude Jarman Jr.), is posted to the fort. Not wanting the other men to think he is favoring his son, he ends up being harder on him. Jeff is watched over by a pair of more seasoned troopers, Tyree (Ben Johnson) and Boone (Harry Carey Jr.).

With the arrival of the estranged Mrs. Kathleen Yorke (Maureen O'Hara) who has come to take the under-age Yorke home with her, even more tension is added. The Colonel and Mrs. Yorke figure out it would be best to let young Jeff grow up and make the decision whether to stay or leave for himself; he chooses to stay. The tension brought about in the fight for their son rekindles the love they once had for each other.

Yorke is visited by his former Civil War commander, Philip Sheridan (J. Carrol Naish), now Chief General of Army. Sheridan has decided to order Yorke to cross the Rio Grande into Mexico, an action with grave political problems since it could well be seen as an act of war against Mexico.

If Yorke fails in his mission to destroy the Apache threat he faces the threat of court-martial. Sheridan, in a quiet act of acknowledgment of what he is asking Yorke to risk, promises that the members of the court will be men who rode with Yorke through the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War. Yorke accepts the mission. Now Col. Yorke must fight to save, and put back together, his family and his honor.

Some aspects of the story, notably the regiment's crossing into Mexico, and undertaking a campaign there, loosely resemble the expedition conducted by the 4th Cavalry Regiment (United States) under Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie in 1873.",1228348800,47,3292,4.76140350877193

3231874,5,B000X25F78,"This collaboration - one of many - between the legendary director, John Ford, and the legendary actor, John Wayne, has many superlatives to recommend it. This was the third in a trilogy of excellent cavalry films directed by Ford and starring Wayne. While all are almost equal in terms of quality, this one is the best...my opinion of course. This was the first of five collaborations between Wayne and the fiery Irish redhead, Maureen O'Hara. ""THE QUIET MAN"" which immediately followed this one was also directed by Ford and was their best collaboration...this one is a close second. I do not know if anything was going on off-screen between these two, but their chemistry on-screen was palpable in this and their other movies. This film is probably the best portrayal of horse cavalry life during the Indian wars, from the day-to-day routine, to the training in preparation for battle and finally to the actual Indian fighting. One of the key ingredients in horse cavalry life was music...and that is superbly furnished in this film by the iconic, Sons of the Pioneers, whose lead singer at this time was none other than Ken Curtis (Festus Haggen on ""GUNSMOKE""). Curtis - who was also Fords son-in-law - had a beautiful voice and puts it on display in this film. Wayne is LtCol Kirby Yorke, a reprise of his character in ""FT APACHE"", the first film in the cavalry trilogy. He is charged with protecting Texas pioneers against the Apache along the Rio Grande. The Apache lived on both sides of the river and crossed back and forth freely. There is some basis in history for the cross-river raid conducted by LtCol York...a similar raid was fought by Col Ranald MacKenzie in 1873. In addition to Wayne and O'Hara, look for Claude Jarman, Jr (Jody in ""THE YEARLING"") who plays the young trooper son of Yorke; and several of Fords stock actors - Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr, Victor McLaglen, Chill Wills, etc. One of the finest of the Ford/Wayne collaborations...my highest recommendation.",1360281600,6,1988,4.85

3231878,3,B000X25F78,"This is the third, and the best, of the John Ford/John Wayne cavalry trilogy. Maybe it's because this one includes Maureen O'Hara, with whom John Wayne always worked so well. But mostly I think because the script has more going for it. The title refers to the fact that the outpost is only a few miles from the Rio Grande, which offers much frustration, because the policy is they cannot cross it, even in hot pursuit of renegades.

John Wayne is Lt. Col. Yorke, and the story opens with him being informed that his son (whom he has not seen since he was an infant) flunked math and was dropped from West Point. Later we learn that the reason he has not seen the boy or his mother in all that time was that Yorke, as a Yankee soldier, burned down her house during a raid on the Confederacy. She was a southerner, and has been bringing up her son as a southerner.

Then when new recruits arrive (18 when he had requested 180), his son is among them. Not long after that his estranged wife (O'Hara, of course) shows up, mostly to persuade Wayne to let his son out of the Army. Apparently she needed his signature to permit the application to go through, even though young Yorke had lied about his age to get in. But her son points out that the application would also require his signature, and he has no intention of signing.

One of my favorite scenes is when the new recruits are being instructed in horsemanship by the drill sergeant, and he asks whether any of them know anything about horses. Yorke and two of his southern friends show up the entire troop by accepting the sergeant's mocking challenge to ride ""like the Romans did,"" standing astride two horses. They even jump the horses while riding like this, the way some expert circus performers can do. Of course one knows they are stuntmen, and not the handsome young actors, but it's still quite a show.

These three southern fried boys are brave and they are wise-asses, and they make much of the lighter moments of the movie. One is being sought by the local sheriff for a horse thief. But he manages to hide when the sheriff comes to call, and Wayne protects him mostly because he's a very good soldier.

There are many women and children at the post, and by subterfuge, a band of renegade Indians manage to raid the fort and capture the children as hostages. They take them across the Rio Grande and impound them in an abandoned mission. Wayne risks being court-marshaled to go across, even though he had the tacit permission of the Mexican officer on the other side. Young Yorke and his two rebel cronies sneak into the mission and are able to hold off the Indians, diverting their attention while the cavalry comes charging over the hill in typical western movie style, bringing along wagons in which to rescue the children and kill enough Indians to get them away. Wayne takes an arrow in his chest, and his son has to pull it out.

All in all, it's a good but rather typical Wayne western. However, it is old enough that it is not imitating, but having been imitated since. I enjoyed it enough more than ""Yellow Ribbon"" to give it three stars.",1337385600,,3111,4.477954144620811

He's soon followed by his mother, York's estranged wife Kathleen (Maureen O'Hara in the first of their four team-ups), who wants to buy him out of his enlistment--but Jeff doesn't want to be bought.  Then Natchez's Apaches make a raid on the post and free him, and eventually York must rescue the post's children, who have been captured by the hostiles and taken across the river into Mexico.  Adding to the complications is the presence of Trooper Travis Tyree (Ben Johnson)--obviously not the same Tyree he played in ""Yellow Ribbon""--who besides being a buddy of Jeff's is being hunted for manslaughter by a U.S. Marshal (Grant Withers).  Harry Carey Jr. appears as Jeff and Travis's pal Sandy (it's tempting to wonder whether Travis and Sandy, after their hitches were up, teamed up to trade horses and guide Mormon settlers in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagon-Master/dp/B002BIULMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagon Master</a>), the inimitable Victor McLaglen as Sgt.

3231901,5,B000X25F78,"The last in Ford's cavalry trilogy, this is a very fine film. Ben Johnson's introduction into the cavalry as trooper Tyree features some stunning horsemanship and cements him as one of America's very best character actors. If you wanted a salt of the earth Texan - you could do no better. Maureen O'Hara puts in one of her best performances as Wayne's estranged wife and the Ford cavalry ensemble delivers another stunning portrayal of making the best of life in the rough. Wayne demonstrates, yet again, that he is not just a movie hero. The guy can act, and here he does it in spades. One can only assume that those disparaging his abilities either haven't seen his early stuff or they just disapprove of his politics. But the real hero of this fantastic movie is, of course, John Ford. He demonstrates, yet again, his total mastery of black and white - the nuances are so much more subtle than anything you can do in colour. But forget the arty stuff, what Ford was doing here was putting the lid on a series of movies that created an American mythology - where they came from and what it meant to be an American. And forget the carping hypocrites who rage about how it wasn't really like that. First, how do they know? Second, do they really think soldiers in King Arthur's time were anything like the Knights of the Round Table? Realism doesn't matter, this is the stuff dreams are made of, not to mention nations. Ford understood that and undertook his mission with a startling clarity and persistent integrity - that, coupled with his artistic flair, is what made him one of the greatest of directors.

The last film in John Ford's ""cavalry trilogy"" and, IMO, the best of the three. John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara are one of the great ""screen teams"" and they are in top form here. Wayne is ""Lt. Col. Yorke"", O'Hara is ""Kathleen"", his estranged wife, and Jarman is their son, who has enlisted in the Army and has been posted to his father's command. O'Hara has accompanied Jarman to his posting hoping to persuade his father to let her ""buy out"" his enlistment and return him to civilian life. To her chagrin, Jarman wants no part of that and refuses to allow it.

The film is ""classic Ford"". The characters are developed slowly and fully and, as always, the location photography is stunning---the film was shot in Moab, Utah. There is plenty of action involving an Apache uprising. McLaglen is a delight as the ""top kick"" for Wayne's unit. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr., give fine performances. The scene where Johnson, Carey, and Jarman ride teams of horses bareback, ""Roman style"", is just incredible---especially so given the fact that each actor is doing his own riding---no stunt-doubles for any of them. Ben Johnson, who was a National Champion Rodeo Cowboy prior to entering films, is probably the best horseman to ever appear in the movies.
