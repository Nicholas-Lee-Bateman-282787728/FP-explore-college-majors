He hopes to revive a relationship with his life-long love Diane, Stone encounters his biggest challenge...finding the strength to forgive Stanley and help his uncle repay a debt he can't pay.

8569555,5,B00BJC8KM8,"First, brilliant screenplay. Suspense at every turn.  Second, outstanding directing. Great use of turns and twists on camera. Third, outstanding cinematography. Best use of shadow and back light I've seen in a small indie in...well, a long while!  I've learned to expect all three from Derek Wayne Johnson and Rob Senska. The acting was seamless and well done by all players. Production value was extremely high on what I know to be a very low budget film .(Kudos George Landrum , Derek and the rest of the production crew). Effects....effectively wonderful. Proves the indies have all the real talent. Should do well, if not win, at the Wide Screen Festival in Miami in 2015. Looking forward to Derek's John Avildsen's upcoming bio-pic. Great job, cast and crew alike.
Only observable complaint........a couple of edit blacks that went a little too long. Easily fixed.",1424390400,,869,5.06993006993007

8569562,5,B00BJC8KM8,"With dynamic acting, brilliant cinematography, and southern charm Broken Blood keeps you on the edge of your seat. The writing is reminiscent of Elmore Leonard with characters leaping off the screen. Playing a dual role of twins, co-writer/director Derek Wayne Johnson turned two excellent, realistic performances, while also directing a cast and getting a different side out of prolific character actors known more for other types of roles. The characters were fun to watch, and make you want to know more about them. Ali Costello did an excellent job as the southern belle, girl-next-door love interest and had great on-screen chemistry with Johnson. I've already watched it twice!",1372118400,2,683,5.333333333333333
