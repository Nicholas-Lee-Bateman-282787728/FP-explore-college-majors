7793295,4,0876045654,I use several of Prof. Engel's lectures in my high school English classes. This is another good one.  Students never get enough of Poe!,1433548800,,135,4.625
7793296,5,0876045654,The professor makes this informational video very engaging. I showed this to my High School English classes for several years. It always held their attention and gave them some laughs. It is one they remember! I encourage high school Literature teachers to give it a try!,1417392000,,271,4.913043478260869
7793297,2,0876045654,"Elliot Engel may be the authority on Poe, but this presentation is laughable to high school students.  His mannerisms are so annoying that it was impossible not to shut it off.  I would never use this in a classroom.  The information is great, but the presentation is not.",1354924800,,272,4.625
7793298,5,0876045654,This documentary is by far the most mind stimulating and may I boast for me a life changing education. Professor engels reaches even the dullest of minds and captures his audience with the way he tells the story of edgar allan poes life. Thank you so much for this video!,1350777600,,271,4.44
7793299,5,0876045654,"I use this DVD in my English classes and the students love it. It is not only educational, it is also very entertaining. Professor Engel is an engaging speaker.",1347667200,,160,4.551724137931035
7793300,5,0876045654,"I myself enjoyed Prof. Engel's Shakespeare and History of English DVDs, but my 7th grade students were not so enthusiastic with his urbane joking and erudite storytelling. What a difference a year makes! I ventured to show Engel's Poe video to my three 8th grade classes after we read ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" and viewed a more conventional Poe biography video (snore). All the classes were spellbound by Professor Engel's storytelling, his humorous appraisal of the quirky life. They loved his labored hyperbole, begged to finish viewing the following day and applauded the video upon its conclusion. Middle schoolers are nothing if not ""morbidly curious"" (his words) and Engel gives 'em what they want!",1289520000,3,701,5.212389380530974
7793301,4,0876045654,"One of the best things about most documentaries is when the narrator is talking, images are displayed to illustrate points.  There are very few images show in this DVD, most of the time is spent simply watching the professor talk.  So visually, it is not the most appealing.  However, the content of his lecture is amazing.  This is the most complete overview of Poe's life I have seen in a very long time.  I showed it to my high school juniors in American Literature class and they, overall, thought it was pretty interesting.  Also, he repeats the main points several times, which is good if you give students questions to answer while they view the film.",1242259200,,658,4.629310344827586
7793302,5,0876045654,"At first glance, this seems like it would be dull--a professor lecturing on the life of a poet. WRONG! It is fantastic! Professor Engel brings Poe to life through stories of the writer's life accented with tidbits of information from the time period in which Poe lived. A fellow teacher told me about this dvd; she said she showed it to her junior English students and they really liked it! These were not honors students or the college-bound students who tend to be more interested or open to this sort of thing. Her regular classroom students found Professor Engel's teaching to be engaging. If you teach high school English, you know that is sometimes a feat in and of itself. Professor Engel tells stories of the young Poe that really illustrate why the writer was driven to produce the sort of works that he did--works that ulimately made him famous. I have bought the dvd of Professor Engel discussing Shakespeare, as well as his History of the English Language dvd. No classroom collection or school media library is complete without this dvd. It is really wonderful!",1225065600,9,1074,4.779569892473118
7793303,1,0876045654,"I am sad that I wasted my money on this DVD, Edgar Cayce would be disappointed at the price of this DVD.  It's nothing more than an infomercial.  It looks like I'm the sucker who got the last copy as see it is unavailable now.  I have been so excited to recently discover the readings of Edgar Cayce, but I am near tears that I have gone further in debt purchasing this DVD when I should have paid bills.  Hopefully, the DVD from the Biography Channel is better.  Actually - there is a wealth of information on the internet and it is still free as Edgar Cayce would have wanted.  I want my money back!",1207180800,19,601,4.182608695652174
7793304,1,0876045654,"From the title, I assumed this was going to tell me all kinds of ""Fascinating"" things about either Cayce or the ""Course"" the title refers to - it does neither.  This was nothing more to me than an advertisement about the ""course"" it talks about and how it might be similar to Cayce but from a different perspective.  The DVD is 1/2 hour of an uninformative interview with Cayce's relative and someone from ""The Course"".  It may have been worth printing the contained information on a pamphlet, but as a DVD being sold as a retail product, it's a waste of money. I gave a one-star rating because it wouldn't accept a rating of 1/100th.",1198368000,24,634,4.495652173913044
