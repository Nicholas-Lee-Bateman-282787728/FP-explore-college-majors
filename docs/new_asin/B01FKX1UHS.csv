7750617,2,B01FKX1UHS,FAKE!,1500854400,9,5,5.0
7750618,5,B01FKX1UHS,This set had all of the regular seasons. It didn't include the specials. So you'll be wondering what happened to David Tennant if you don't buy them elsewhere! Why they didn't just include the specials as a short season makes no sense to me.,1494201600,41,241,4.5
7750619,5,B01FKX1UHS,I got my package with all of the items ahead of time and in great condition. All of the series were there and new and in the plastic package. I am so incredibly happy with the products and the price for them. This was the cheapest price I found by at least $300.,1481587200,8,262,3.9622641509433962
7750620,5,B01FKX1UHS,Evrerthing is awesome! Just as described and delivered with plenty of time for Christmas.,1481241600,,89,5.428571428571429

7750624,5,B01FKX1UHS,"Amazing!!  I purchased this when it was on sale for $110.  Not only is that a steal, but imagine my surprise when it not only had Series 1-9, but had Series 10 included as a bonus.  That was a special little surprise.  (Not saying they all come with Series 10.  The listing only said 1-9.  Maybe I just won the jackpot.  But I saw another review that mentioned the 10th Series was included in theirs. Either way, the price was amazing for just the first 9 Series!)

Just remember, if you want the specials, you will need to order those separate, as most of these do not have them in their set. Thats the way it is though.  Thats why they are specials.",1527724800,2,651,4.227642276422764
7750625,5,B01FKX1UHS,"I am absolutely thrilled to pieces. I was expecting to get seasons 1 through 9, as described, but season 10 was also included! Sure would be nice if someone offered a similar set of Classic Doctor Who DVDs (hint, hint).",1527206400,,219,4.5
7750626,5,B01FKX1UHS,"Its Dr Who. Theres a minor issue in season one of only have of words showing up on closed captioned, otherwise is fine. You get all the regular episodes plus the extra xmas ones.",1526774400,2,178,4.264705882352941
7750627,3,B01FKX1UHS,Loved the series but one season has a defective dvd which was sad about.,1525132800,,72,4.214285714285714
7750628,4,B01FKX1UHS,"Sorry people, the specials are NEVER included in the ""complete"" sets.  It's a shame but the BBC obviously has a different dictionary entry on ""complete"".",1524441600,5,153,5.12

These are considered special episodes and aren't included in this set.",1521676800,25,245,5.125
7750632,5,B01FKX1UHS,Itll you're looking to collect all the doctor who DVDs look at my other reviews to pick up the missing ones. These all came in good condition and all played well.,1520380800,2,162,4.258064516129032
7750633,1,B01FKX1UHS,"I don't see the David Tennant specials, so I question whether this is the complete collection.",1519516800,8,94,4.9375

7750636,3,B01FKX1UHS,"I'm not a Doctor Who fan, but my girlfriend is absolutely obsessed with it. I got this for her 18th birthday and I'm so excited for her to open it up in a few days.

The delivery said that it would arrive anywhere between Feb. 17th and Feb. 29th, but it showed up on Feb. 14th, so kudos to Seller for that. The reason for not putting a five star review is because, as I said, I got this as a gift for my girlfriend. Once it's all opened up and we can see the image quality I will be more than happy to change my review.",1519084800,,519,3.850467289719626
7750637,1,B01FKX1UHS,The advertisement stated that it was the complete series.  It was not.  I was searching for the complete series commencing with the original Doctor Who.,1519084800,2,152,5.04

7750648,1,B01FKX1UHS,"Poor quality product, the discs were blurry and didn't appear to be up to BBC manufacturer status.  The package left a lot to be desired, as it was swimming in a box to big and no filler material.  The order wasn't shipped until 11 days after it was placed.  This was my first Amazon return.",1507334400,9,291,4.254545454545455

8761012,4,B01FKX1UHS,I like the episodes that are in the set - but it is NOT a complete collection!,1533513600,,78,3.6470588235294117
8761013,2,B01FKX1UHS,I opened the first box set and got a surprise when I found out these are not legit copies of the disc they are pirated. You can tell by the picture I have included that the BBC would never let go discs that looks so ugly and washed out. This is only the first box set but I feel so jipped. I put in the first DVD and yep you can tell the difference this is definitely a knockoff.,1532217600,6,379,3.810126582278481
8761014,2,B01FKX1UHS,"I can't believe the incredibly poor quality of these DVDs. I've never seen anything this pixelated and ugly in my life. Parts are incredibly blurry, just outright embarrassing. This is not a 'quality' release at all. Not so sure I'd call it a ""bootleg"", but it's  an incredibly poor release, that's for sure.",1532044800,5,308,4.811320754716981
8761015,5,B01FKX1UHS,Good came on time and all the disk run smooth,1530057600,,45,3.6
8761016,5,B01FKX1UHS,Amazing series. Ordering this collection was to fill the void in my hearts. Ive read other reviews saying they were bootleg copies and they received missing seasons. Not only did I get 1-9 but I also got season 10 as well. It is DVD quality. There are special episodes that are not included. I was looking to get the entire series on Blu-Ray but this is a much cheaper option. Im very happy with it though.,1529971200,,406,4.355263157894737
8761017,1,B01FKX1UHS,Very poor video quality. Seems like a bootleg. Very disappointed. Returning.,1529712000,,76,6.0
