8362244,3,B002BWP2K8,"This was a really enjoyable series. The actors where delightful to watch and they all had great chemistry with one another especially Alexa Vega ( Ruby ) since her character interacted with everyone on an emotional basis. David Cassidy was her biological dad on the show, Patrick Cassidy was like a dad, along with his wife and the two young guys on the show where sorta her brothers and they where charming together. Plus, you got to hear some music and thats always good. Like so many other series that just let you sit back and be entertained for 1/2 an hour this one was under appreciated and wasn't given enough time to be. I look forward to enjoying it once again on dvd.",1307750400,4,677,4.467741935483871
8362245,5,B002BWP2K8,I was very saddened when they canceled this sitcom.  It had a great cast with such great possibilities for story lines!  The girl that played Ruby was multi-talented.  It will not surprise me to see her turn up again somewhere else.  David Cassidy turns anything he touches to gold.  ABC let a good thing go - what's your problem ABCFamily??????,1259452800,14,345,4.683333333333334

Not only are David Cassidy and Alexa Vega in the show but Patrick Cassidy also stars with Shaun Cassidy on the production team and Ryan Cassidy also working on the show.

I went to an episode recording on 19 June in Los Angeles and there were giggles and side splitting laughs from all of us there in the tv audience.

This show is going to be a smash hit - let's get the DVD presales list figures to record levels to show CBS/ABC Family that this series can be sold to networks worldwide.

What a boost of a show this is in the current climate. Check out the Ruby and the Rockits Facebook page and the channel's show website[...]",1245542400,20,753,4.251748251748252
