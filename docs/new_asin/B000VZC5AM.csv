'Jhoom Barabar' is an overall entertaining film of serendipity and kismet unfolding between two strangers who happen to meet at a busy cafe while waiting for a train. A conversation soon ensues and to pass the time they attempt to impress each other by making up an imaginary, romantic tale. They both claim to be waiting for their future mate and express how deliriously happy they are. As you might expect in the course of events they fall in love with each other during the wait and now must swallow their pride and find a way express their true feelings for each other. Neither wanting to let the other know their stories where made up they arrange to meet again and bring along their significant others. Will they continue their mutual charades and lose each other forever or will they find the courage to express their true feelings for each other?

Abhishek Bachchan (Rikki) and Preity Zintal (Alvira) do a solid and believable job of portraying two chance, smitten romantics but I actually preferred the performances of Lara Dutta and Bobby Deol as their make believe lovers. However what really made the movie for me was the four or five intermittent appearances by the legendary Amitabh Bachchan in the whimsical role of a dancing, singing sprite who apparently has some mystical cupid-like connection with the budding relationship between Rikki and Alvira.

Solid production values, recognizable cast and an excellent soundtrack make 'Jhoom Barabar' and easy and enjoyable watch. My rating: -3 Stars-.",1268352000,4,1574,5.0

8220581,2,B000VZC5AM,"It's more of a musical, if you are fan of the cast, then this will be a treat. Nothing special about the story nor the music however the choreography is worth the praise. It has lavish decors, sets and customs. It's a colorful movie.  Leaves you all puzzled at the end, gets 2 stars for the effort.  The whole thing falls flat.",1458691200,,327,4.258064516129032

8220583,5,B000VZC5AM,"I love anything with Amitabh Bachchan in it, especially when he dances or sings. Even though he is only a bit part player he still can carry a story line.",1388448000,,154,4.166666666666667

8220585,4,B000VZC5AM,"Jhoom Barabar Jhoom was a fun movie; I think it was made as a vehicle to carry some great dancing, at least one wonderful song, marvelous costumes, and the sexiest gypsy musician you are ever likely to see. I liked Abhishek Bachchan as a carefree bachelor who tells highly inventive lies without second thought, and ends up falling for someone who is as good at creative fiction as he is. The movie started out with this incredible guy leaning against a wall; (Amitabh Bachchan as the Gypsy street musician) wearing boots, jeans, hat complete with feathers, gold earring, and the most beautiful coat you have ever seen. He and his double guitar gather up the crowd (a la the Pied Piper) and they do the title song - Jhoom Barabar Jhoom - all over the train station. It was wonderful. Then boy (Abhishek Bachchan as Rikki) meets girl (Preity Zinta as Alvira), boy and girl tell each other lots of lies, boy and girl part having fallen for each other, boy and girl have astounding dance competition, boy and girl get together at last, back to the gypsy for one more go round with the great song. Not much of a story as you can see, but the dancing alone makes up for the story shortcomings. By the way, I liked Lara Dutta as Laila much more than Preity Zinta as Alvira; I would have preferred Rani Mukerjee or even Kareena Kapoor as Alvira. For one thing they would both have looked better in the costumes. All said and done, it was a romp. I enjoyed the movie, loved the dancing, and coveted the gypsy.",1372204800,,1501,4.461818181818182
8220586,5,B000VZC5AM,"one of my all time favorite bollywood movies. i recommend this title as an intro to hindi movies because the story is captivating and does not drag, in my opinion.",1367193600,,163,4.466666666666667
8220587,4,B000VZC5AM,"THIS IS A FANCIFUL MOVIE WITH A DIFFERENT PLOT LINE . FUN TO WATCH .

Opens with Big B doing a fun catchy song as dancers sway and Abhishek Bachan walks through the train station to deliver Cricket match tickets to one of his usual customer's (he's somewhat a bit of a scamp and let the buyer beware on anything he is ""selling""). He reaches down with his eyes closed to pick a winning lotto ticket and grabs Preity Zintas hand by accident she gets mad and tells him off . He walks to her table to sit and eat because there are no chairs to sit in in the coffe shop in the train station . He keeps telling her he aint that kinda guy to hit on her. She waves her ring in his face and says she is engaged...he does the same. They start exchanging outlandish stories of how they met these fiance's.....It't pure comedic fun till the end of the movie with hilarious deliveries by Bobbby Deol and supporting cast. Enjoy and as always judge for yourself..",1332720000,,948,4.237569060773481
8220588,2,B000VZC5AM,"Jhoom Barabar Jhoom was okay, not great, but not absolutely horrible...  About to be expected from a Bollywood movie.  Since Hindi DVDs are pretty cheap from Amazon, it was worth checking it out, especially since Preity Zinta is my favorite actress...

I thought the premise, two strangers, Preity Zinta and Abhishek Bachchan meeting at a train station and swapping wild stories of how they each met their fiances to pass the time sounded like good fun, if nothing else.

Unfortunately, almost any of the time that Abhishek Bachchan was on the screen, and mostly wished he'd leave...  I didn't like his character, Rikki, at all, or the way he used the phrase ""I got class"" instead of actually having a modicum of class.  He was just too scummy...

Rikki's story of meeting Anaida, a manager at the Ritz Hotel in Paris was simply too far fetched to suspend disbelief for a little bit to go along with it.  While Alvira (Preity Zinta) had a story that was a little better put together.

I never figured out if the scene where they dare each other to do things was part of the story, with Rikki and Alvira passing time, or was one of them daydreaming they were doing it.  Since Alvira's dare to Rikki was a tattoo, there was no follow-up later on with his tattoo or not...

Bobby Deol's transformation from wimpy, dorky Satvinder into cool Steve was far too extreme to quickly to be believable at all...

The songs were mostly kind of dull.  I liked ""Ticket to Hollywood"" as far as the song and the dancing, though Rikki's attitude in it simply made me dislike him still more, and wonder what exactly his made-up finace, Anaida actually saw in him (but hey, it was his fantasy...).  The rest of the songs I just fast-forwarded through, until the dance competition at the end, since that was part of the plot.

Overall, it was entertaining, but ultimately unsatisfying...",1309046400,,1867,4.649390243902439
8220589,5,B000VZC5AM,"This film is about 2 strangers  Abhishek Bachchan(Rikki) & Preity Zinta (Alvira) they meet at a subway station,and have to wait for 2 hours. They're both attracted to each other (but won't admit it) so they decide to tell each other the outrageous way they both met their ""imaginary"" significant others. The stories are outlandish,but of course since this is Bollywood it's so cute. Abhishek and Preity even fantasize about how their love story would be like, very romantic. Within these crazy,romantic stories there are musical numbers combined with awesome choreography. They meet again at a dance competition. However Preity Zinta (Alvira) must find someone to pose as her fiance, she looks to Bobby Deol (Steve) to help her out. In the meantime, Abhishek Bachchan (Rikki) looks to Lara Dutta (Anaida) to pose as his fiance,but she's a prostitute with a foul mouth and pleads with her to act the part of a refined lady,so as to not give him away. At the dance competition, the attraction felt between Preity and Abhishek is evident & Lara and Bobby are attracted to each other as well. ""Cupid"" portrayed by the famous Amitabh Bachchan (Abhishek Bachchan's dad) is seen throughout the film with music & choreography is lending a hand in joining these 4 hearts together. He even dances with all 4 of them in the dance competition!! This film has a sweet happy ending filled with romance. If you love lavish costumes, hip swaying music combined with awesome choreography, this movie doesn't disappoint :) I bought the cd to this movie and I never tire of it. I've seen this at least 8 times, it's that awesome!!!",1293667200,6,1612,4.840579710144928
