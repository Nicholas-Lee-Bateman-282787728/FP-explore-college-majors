Your kids will love seeing the kid who just can't measure up finally take the prize - don't worry I can't spoil it we already know how it's going to turn out and it's all just a feel good kind of movie where everybody wins in the end - even the bad guy.

8320223,3,B001M0DOSW,"Humiliated former Olympic athlete avoids the limelight & his fears by being a gym teacher in a middle school

Meloni does a fine job as the gym teacher.

Amy Sedaris is terrible as the Principal

David Alan Greer is not bad as a rival gym teacher

Nathan Kress is ok as the nerdy overprotected by his mother, but coached & mentored by Meloni to be able to compete",1503360000,,363,4.294117647058823
8320224,5,B001M0DOSW,"This is a great movie. It will appeal to 7-12 year olds, and also adults. It has Amy Sedaris as the sexually frustrated high school principal  and Chris Meloni as a sexy 40+ y old neurotic loving man with many, I assume deliberate, butt shots. It also stars Bruce Jenner before he became Caitlyn Jenner (check out his facial skin). There are also other brief appearances by great comedians (opening scene for example). There are teenage references to kissing and attraction, and many humorous sexual references that kids will get (not raunchy, but showing a sensitivity to teenage curiosity). It has a great message of inclusivity and overcoming your fears. Well worth seeing. It was made in 2009 so some messages may seem obvious to kids 8-14 nowadays, but if seen as a family movie it could be good fun (especially if you explain who Bruce Jenner became, and the the TV shows Chris Meloni starred in previously).",1492473600,,914,4.784810126582278
8320225,4,B001M0DOSW,"Kids said it was a good movie to fill time on a road trip. They are 10 and 8 year old boys.  Not sure they loved it enough for a repeat viewing, but it held their attention...",1477267200,,175,3.72972972972973
