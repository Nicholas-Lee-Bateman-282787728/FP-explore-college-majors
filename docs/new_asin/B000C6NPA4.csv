8095989,4,B000C6NPA4,"No Inhibitions tells the story of a woman, April Hannah, who finds an ancient artifact. When she touches it, she becomes sexually aroused. This story should have written itself, with April jumping everything in sight and a couple of her friends getting ahold of the artifact and doing the same. Some of it plays out that way, but most of the story is her having lame conversations to a former college professor over the internet. In fact, April doesn't ever have sex with anyone. She has a fantasy about having sex with another girl, which we get to see, and towards the end, she masturbates, but that's it. It was a really disjointed story.

But then there wasn't much of a story anyway, because almost all the running time is alloted to the seven sex scenes. Two are boy/girl, two are girl/girl, and three are girl solo. The sex scenes were okay, and parts of them were great, but the heat needed to be cranked up a few degrees higher in a couple of them. All the women in this video were smoking hot, especially April. In addition to her, there was Roxanne Hall, Alana Evans, Dawn Arellano, Nina Ferrari, Lexi, and Lola.

It's an decent offering from Torchlight. If you like a lot of girl/girl and girl solo action, I recommend it.",1137196800,35,1234,4.5291479820627805
