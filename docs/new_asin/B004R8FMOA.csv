4459848,4,B004R8FMOA,"Very good. This movie held my interest even before I knew exactly what was going on. I've never seen Noel Coward act, but I certainly know his name. He played his role to the MAX.",1419379200,3,179,4.142857142857143
4459849,5,B004R8FMOA,Love Noel Coward and this is a really elegant story with spectacular dialogue... was originally a play but this makes for a great movie...hidden gem,1416182400,2,148,4.96
4459850,5,B004R8FMOA,"A perfect movie for a lazy, rainy day.  The performances are stellar.",1416009600,,69,4.75
4459851,5,B004R8FMOA,"Noel Coward and the Celia Johnson with the supporting actors, are but a few of my favorite British talents. This film draws me in, over and over.

I have come to know Noel Coward as a director, who stands out along with David Lean, and many other awesome creators. He is a multi-talented person. I actually prefer British films to those made anywhere else.",1411776000,3,356,4.5625
4459852,3,B004R8FMOA,"This is not a great film, but it's an interesting one. The acting ranges from good to excellent and I'd have watched it just to see Celia Johnson, Noel Coward, and Margaret Leighton. It's also interesting as a period piece: the viewer gets a glimpse of Britain just a few years after the Second World War. Like some other reviewers, I found it difficult to believe that the psychiatrist played by Noel Coward could so quickly go from being a successful and happily-married man to being a self-destructive wreck obsessed with a woman who can't return his love. It's not that such a scenario is implausible; it's the speed with which he spins out of control. Much of the dialogue is good: sophisticated and somewhat brittle as one would expect Coward to be. But toward the end, the lines match the melodrama of the plot and become annoying rather than interesting. Having said all that, I still found ""The Astonished Heart"" to be a satisfying bit of entertainment.",1403913600,2,962,4.732142857142857
4459853,5,B004R8FMOA,A great read for folks who find good writing joyful and are in awe of the legacy of talent that has emerged from The New Yorker.,1399334400,,128,3.9615384615384617

4459855,4,B004R8FMOA,"The story of sad but it appreciated very much the sensitivity with which it was performed.  Actors, I thought, very good.",1371772800,,121,4.761904761904762
4459856,4,B004R8FMOA,"Disregard the supercilious one-star review. 'The Astonished Heart' (U.K., 1950) is a provocative, wry Gainsborough melodrama starring Noel Coward (based on his play), Celia Johnson ('Brief Encounter,' 'Captain's Paradise') and Margaret Leighton ('The Winslow Boy,' 'Under Capricorn'), and co-directed by Terence Fisher (known for helming a number of the better Hammer horror films). Like most of Coward's works it is stubbornly, impeccably urbane, but therein lies its appeal (a quaint change of pace in this age of coarse, shallow colloquy). And while Coward the actor may seem at first an odd fit as the romantic lead, his physical unattractiveness here forces the viewer to look beyond the superficial aspects of the story's subject-- marital infidelity-- and into its more mature intellectual and emotional aspects. If you have the remotest admiration for the British stiff-upper-lip approach to problem-solving and enjoy smart dialogue, well-delivered, you'll appreciate TAH. Excellent b&w cinematography, as well. 4 stars.",1367280000,11,1028,5.769736842105263
4459857,1,B004R8FMOA,"If you admire Coward, avoid this embarrassing misstep in his career. Every  over-enunciated syllable is an assault on the senses.",1326672000,2,129,5.45

4459866,4,B004R8FMOA,"I love old movies and thought I would give this one a try.  I was so surprised by how good it is.  Noel Coward does a superb job as the cheating husband.  He is a very successful Psychiatrist totally self absorbed in his work and seems content to stay that way.  His wife is devoted to him, and one day introduces him to her sexy friend who she hasn't seen in years.  Her friend, kiddenly, warns her that she might try going after her husband.  Trust me there are women out there just like this.  Coward does such a great job transtitioning from over confident, successful Psychiatrist to being infatuated with his wife's friend - to finally all out obsession.  During this fall from grace - he is well aware of how wrong his actions are and that he is not unlike the many patients he treats and how all too human he really is.",1431648000,2,827,4.290322580645161
4459867,5,B004R8FMOA,I like the stilted ambiance of this anal psychiatrist and his loving wife. I like that he falls for someone with no empathy and little care about consequence. It is not a fast movie but I like the contrasts.,1428796800,3,207,4.333333333333333
8438751,5,B004R8FMOA,"Like Coward's masterpiece ""Brief Encounter,"" this film studies infidelity and its wearing effects on everyone it touches.  Excellent performances by Coward and Celia Johnson as well as Margaret Leighton and a good ensemble support cast.  That silent, plodding, get-on-with-it British spirit illuminates all his characters and their movements and attitudes.  Well, it's Noel Coward in his glorious underplayed suffering.",1471564800,2,419,6.067796610169491

8438753,5,B004R8FMOA,"Great film with great acting and all especially for those trying to deal with their own obsessive love
situation. It does help one get on with the obsessive love that is over, and balance out.
with the obsessive love that might have a chance except for the obsession.
I loved the scene about the search for the Bible in the house; all actors carried this out so well without getting
into stereotypical character acting.",1470960000,3,419,4.675675675675675

8438759,5,B004R8FMOA,"Noel Coward was such an amazing man, an incredibly talented person and made ,wrote and directed some of the best movies ever made. The Astonished heart is one of those special movies I love to watch at least once each year. There are so many wonderful life lessons in this movie and without giving anything away, I think it is a movie everyone can learn from. Forgiveness is a gift humans seem to have such a hard time giving to anyone. Especially the ones they seem to love the most! I recommend this film and believe it can open your mind and heart. A beautifully, written and superbly acted film that is not dated in my opinion in any important way. Its intention and lessons are the same today as they were then.",1457395200,6,716,4.390977443609023
