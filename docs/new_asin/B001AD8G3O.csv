8276924,4,B001AD8G3O,"It boggles my mind that there are so many mediocre films out there being released in clear, beautiful digital transfers and they still stink.  Here we have a rare, Euro Spy movie from the sixties which should be given that same treatment and would make it a cut above the deluge of copy cat Bonds that came out after the success of 'GOLDFINGER'.  With this outing we have Stewart Granger, who at this time would make a number of these, playing a typical spy in the Playboy mode (we never really know who he is working for) out to thwart an evil organization run by German actor Curt Jurgens.  This is where the German Krimi genre molds with the James Bond genre.  We have Karin Dor and Klaus Kinski from the Krimis and we have British actor Rupert Davies keeping the british end up and Adolpho Celli in his usual oily performance for the Bond genre. You will also see Sixties babes Molly Peters and Erica Remberg popping up to make you gasp.  In amongst the mix is a stand out performance by Italian actress Scilla Gabel as Tiger pushing the censors to their limit with her highly erotic, buffed babe performance.  Clad in black leather pants and toting a machine gun, she would be right at home with Tura Satana.  Direction by Manfred Kohler is fast and busy which is what makes the film so entertaining and the fuzz guitar music score by Marcello Giombini sticks in your mind long after the movie is over.  Alas, the quality seems to be culled from a pan and scan 16mm print with splices showing up now and then to disrupt dialogue or action.  I hope that companies like Hens Tooth Video or Dark Sky Films read this review and give this guilty pleasure the overhall it deserves. If obscure titles such as 'DEADLIER THAN THE MALE' can be released , why not this one? The Four star rating is for the film , not the quality of the release.  Sinister Cinema, however, deserves kudos for finally giving it a DVD release.  Its better than nothing until the definitive version finally arrives.",1276387200,5,1988,4.4944444444444445
