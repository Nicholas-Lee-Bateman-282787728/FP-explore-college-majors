4900254,5,B005X5XI4C,"The Blue-ray versions of the Poirot 1-hr. episodes are markedly better than the DVD version in resolution and color, whether watched on a flat screen TV or via a projector. I'm glad I found the Blue-ray versions halfway through building my Poirot Series library.",1331424000,18,262,4.9772727272727275
4900255,5,B005X5XI4C,"The second series of Agatha Christie's ""Poirot"" adapts one novel and eight short stories into ten fifty-minute episodes (the novel being split into two parts) and stars David Suchet in what is considered by many to be the definitive performance of Christie's famous Belgian detective. Working as a private investigator who is often called in by Scotland Yard to help with some of their more baffling cases, Poirot enjoys a modest lifestyle amidst the Art Deco styling of 1930s England, which the show goes to great pains to reproduce.

Working alongside Suchet is Hugh Fraser as his Watsonian sick-kick Captain Hastings, Philip Jackson as the by-the-books Chief Inspector Japp, and Pauline Moran as Poirot's immensely efficient secretary Miss Lemon.

As a long running series that began in 1989 and only recently finished filming the final adaptations of Christie's books in 2012, the release of the older episodes on DVD is a treat for long-time fans of the show. With writers such as Clive Exton, Anthony Horowitz (best known for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alex-Rider/dp/0142406112/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alex Rider</a>&nbsp;series) and David Renwick (creator of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jonathan-Creek/dp/B0002ISG0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jonathan Creek</a>) penning some of the screenplays, it comes as no surprise that the show has won plenty of awards, including BAFTAs in its time. Although the pacing can be a little slow by today's standards, the earliest episodes of ""Poirot"" still stand as the benchmark not only for faithful Christie adaptations, but mystery shows in general.

""Peril at End House"" is the highlight of this box-set, with higher production values and a more sophisticated story than the rest of the episodes. Spread over two parts, this is the only story that is based on one of Christie's novels rather than a short story. Poirot and Hastings take a holiday to a Cornish seaside resort where they meet the charming Nick Buckley (played by a young Polly Walker, now probably best known for playing Atia on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome/dp/B0028RXXE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome</a>) who tells them that she's lately had a string of near-fatal accidents.

Poirot's curiosity is piqued, and he warns Nick that her life is in danger, urging her to take precautions amongst her inner circle of friends. Nick laughs it off, at least until her lookalike cousin is shot dead. Now the race is on to find the killer before he's successful in his attempt to finish off Nick.

The rest of the episodes are fifty-minute episodes based on short stories that can be found in various Christie/Poirot anthologies. They are as follows:

""The Veiled Lady""
Poirot ponders how effective he would be as a master-criminal at the same time a beautiful woman (wearing a veil for discretion) asks for his help in retrieving a compromising letter from a blackmailer who is threatening to send it to her fianc just a few days before her wedding. Poirot concludes that the only way to retrieve her property is to break into the blackmailer's house and get it himself, resulting in a scheme that ends up with Poirot on the wrong side of the law!

""The Disappearance of Mr Davenheim""
Mr Davenheim leaves his house to meet with a fellow businessman, but never reaches the train station. His college swears that he passed nobody in the lane on his way to the house, and his wife is at a loss to account for his disappearance. To further complicate the investigation, Inspector Japp makes a bet with Poirot: that he can't solve the mystery without leaving his apartment.

""Double Sin""
Surprised by news that Poirot wants to retire, it's up to Hastings to solve the mystery of missing miniatures that were stolen on their way to an American buyer. Having been on the bus during which the case containing the miniatures were taken (and befriended the young woman responsible for delivering them safely), Hastings is further astonished when he reaches the buyer to find them already in his possession.

""The Adventure of the Cheap Flat""
Poirot is intrigued by a young couple's tale of how they acquired their flat: not only did it come remarkably cheap, but several other applicants were turned away before the Robinsons were accepted as the new tenants. But why does the landlord say that they've lived there for six months when they only moved in a few days ago?

""The Kidnapped Prime Minister""
This one involves - well, exactly what the title says. Poirot is called in by the British government to track down the Prime Minister, due to make an important speech on Germany's disarmament, but who has gone missing after an assassination attempt. Government officials are on the verge of panic, but what Poirot really wants to know is why the kidnappers would want to take the Prime Minister alive after first making an attempt on his life.

""The Adventure of the Western Star""
Two women with matching diamond necklaces have both received threatening letters demanding the return of their diamonds to a Chinese god. Each woman's husband has their own plans for the jewels in question, and Poirot must ferret out the secrets that exist between husbands and wives if he's to uncover the mystery behind the diamonds before they're lost for good.

""The Lost Mine""
A map to a valuable silver mine vanishes along with the man who planned to sell it, whilst a confused young man is found lying unconscious in an alleyway next to a dead body. This one contains such rather cringe-worthy Asian stereotypes, right down to the silk-wearing prostitutes, opium dens and ""Asian Speekee Engrish"" caricatures.

""The Cornish Mystery""
A woman comes to Poirot for help, suspecting that her husband is trying to poison her. Poirot arrives at her home the following day to find that she has passed away in the night and so begins his investigation of her family and friends in the attempt to track down the killer - much to the displeasure of Japp, who considers it an open and shut case.

For those interested, all of these short mysteries (except The Cornish Mystery"" and ""Double Sin"") can be found in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poirot-Investigates/dp/0062074008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poirot Investigates</a>, an anthology of many of his cases, and of course&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peril-at-End-House/dp/0062074024/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peril at End House</a>&nbsp;is its own self-contained novel. As you can see from the summaries, the shorter episodes rarely deal with murder, instead revolving around espionage, kidnapping and theft. That and the fact that Poirot's cohorts provide some comedic relief to the proceedings means that these early episodes are far lighter in tone than later installments in the series.

The problem with adapting some of these mysteries is that Christie's short stories were (obviously) very short - sometimes only a few pages long. As such, many of the episodes need to be padded out in order to fill up the running time. This results in subplots such as Poirot looking after a friend's talking parrot or Miss Lemon losing her keys and finding them two days later in the very first place she should have looked, or extended scenes such as car-chases and police stakeouts. There's never a dull moment in the feature-length ""Peril at End House"", but some of the shorter mysteries can drag a little.

But nevertheless, this is still a superior production, and it's obvious that great care has been taken with Christie's original material, the actors' commitment to their roles, and the distinctive Art Deco style on display throughout the show's sets, locations, costuming, vehicles and general late 1920s/1930s ambiance.",1331164800,15,7899,5.383805668016194
4900256,5,B005X5XI4C,David Suchet is priceless in his role of Poirot.  We enjoyed every story in the Series 2 collection.  We started watching these mysteries on PBS and had to have our own to view and review every story.  We enjoy the roles of Capt. Hastings and Miss Lemon.  We miss them in the Poirot movies.  Long live Agatha Christie's Poirot.  We recommend these DVDs for any mystery fan.,1330905600,24,373,4.492537313432836
4900257,5,B005X5XI4C,"With the great success of series 1, LWT (London Weekend Television) quickly continued with an equally successful series 2.
This time, along with Agatha Christie's Poirot short stories, one Agatha Christie Poirot novel story was included, creating a double length episode. This longer story allowed for a more intriguing mystery.
The rest of the season was filled out with Poirot short stories, but the 'pilot' of the longer double episode showed that LWT was capable of producing the Poirot Novels for television.
Series 3 would dramatize another novel, and series 4 would would feature 4 novels and no short stories.

ITV, the current owners of the LWT programs, went back to the original film elements and remastered them in HD. Yes, there are subtitles.

My only complaint is that the British film makers still need to improve their audio recordings.
