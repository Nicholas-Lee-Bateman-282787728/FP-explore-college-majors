7602838,5,B01AIO7JQ0,"My dvd will be here today and I am soo excited about it!! I have the other two dvd's and they are amazing. So, I know this one will be even better. The workouts are challenging but the results you will obtain is worth the challenge.  If you want to invest in yourself and your health, then investing in the Blk Girls workout dvds are the way to go. I personally think the price is great compared to all the other fitness dvd's on the market. And the best part is I identify with the trainers on this dvd which makes the experience so much more enjoyable.",1454284800,18,554,4.177570093457944
7602839,5,B01AIO7JQ0,"I don't know why people who haven't even purchased the DVD, watched the DVD, or did the DVD are giving a review just to complain about the price.  The DVD may be priced higher than others out there but the makers of this aren't a big corporation like Beach Body. I got the DVD as soon as I found out it was out and have no regrets! Workout is almost an hr long (when you include warm up and cool down). I've done the workout twice in it's entireity and burned over 600 calories both times. Both workouts are very challenging and fun at the same time.  Good workout and well worth the money!",1454025600,26,590,4.166666666666667
7602840,5,B01AIO7JQ0,"Just bought this for my girlfriend... She loves these DVDs. She bought the first DVD and lost weight fast although she struggled and cheated on the meal plan she had real results. Sometimes I do the work outs with her for motivation. She said this one is more intense so we will see. As long as she's happy. It does work ladies , I'm making her stick to the meal plan this time !",1453939200,7,379,4.135135135135135

danigirl & xn nxnnxkxkxxkkxmxkk), as they were not helpful. Feedback is helpful and relevant to the product being advertised.

Yes, ""Ectorcise"" is $39.99, but the quality of Ellen and Lana's training is well worth the price.

7602844,5,B01AIO7JQ0,Black Girls Workout Too and One I lost a significant amount of weight.... I don't think 40 dollars is a bad price. If you are eating unhealthy you spend more then 40 dollars!

7602854,4,B01AIO7JQ0,"This video is really great for what seems to be a slightly amateurish video. It's not a professional video like in a workout studio but it is a very good high intensity workout. You're going to need access to some dumbbells, kettle bells, and a few other fitness tools. I do recommend a yoga mat if you don't have like really soft carpet to workout on because there are some times you'll get on the floor (a mat definitely isn't completely necessary, though.",1482105600,,458,4.530120481927711

Great visual setting. The duo are very motivating which i definitely need. Ellen slays my arms per usual lol
Cons:
a little bit all over the place with the moves and they don't really explain how to execute each move. Lana's dance section looks like she's just kinda winging it so i was confused for most of it lol. And once again, lana gems snatch is on full display. Im talking serious camel toe 90% of the time. All in all, its an ok dvd once i catch on to the moves and get used to it. Their 2nd dvd is still my favorite",1471392000,5,694,4.0
7602867,4,B01AIO7JQ0,"The DVD is higher priced, but I wanted to support the Ectors after finding them on Instagram. I love both workouts from the mother and daughter. I prefer the mother's style because I love working out with a kettleball! The workouts are fun and different and it's funny because they both have different workout styles. I like that they included both normal and fit people as their back up work out partners. Included was a meal plan, which is very helpful. I have done the FLUSH stage which is the first week plan and I felt full and satisfied (even without meat and bread, which are my favorite things to eat!) The only CON I have is honestly, they don't walk you through step by step and will often jump to another exercise without prompting but that's ok with me because after doing the DVD a few times, you pretty much memorize what's next.",1471219200,15,843,4.48051948051948

7602871,4,B01AIO7JQ0,I ordered this DVD about 3 months ago to start back working out again after having my son. I wanted to get back in shape but didn't have the time to get away to the gym every week. This DVD was a great start and helped me to get active again. The exercises  are tough but effective and I definitely saw results in about 3 weeks. The DVD also includes a meal plan that it very detailed and helps you achieve faster results. The editing is not the best and could have been more professional but other than that I would recommend for an at home work out.,1470528000,2,551,4.101851851851852

Some of the exercises seem not to be done correctly and at times the extensions with the weights seemed to lack proper technique as well.  There was a lot of wind in the background in the daughter's portion and I wondered why this couldn't be fixed or put in as a disclaimer before purchasing as it really was annoying to me.

7602890,3,B01AIO7JQ0,"I love the enjoy of this mother and daughter duo and I love the workout.  I feel the burn and I feel I get a good workout each time I play the dvd.  My issue and why I didn't give it 5 stars is, the workout doesn't seem to be structured.  It almost seems as if the workouts were done on a whim.  I'm fine with the constant moving and switching workouts, but the way it is done could possibly lead to injury.  I just think it needs a little fine tuning and it will be awesome.",1466294400,8,475,3.8556701030927836

7602892,5,B01AIO7JQ0,Exceeded my expectations! Excellent work out! The daughter Lana screams throughout the video but her moves are effective. I prefer the mom w/ the arm work out & body sculpting moves.,1466121600,,182,4.903225806451613
7602893,3,B01AIO7JQ0,"I have been following this mother-daughter duo on Instagram and really like their inspirational and encouraging messaging. I really like that they look shapely while being fit because so many women fitness instructors look like men with ponytails. I also saw them on Steve Harvey and was allured by their 30-day meal plan, which is a bonus to the DVD. I felt that the meal plan alone was worth the cost of the DVD, so I felt compelled to purchase it even after reading the negative comments about the video. I love the meal plan and feel amazing and energized.

Now to the DVD: I'm in moderate shape - I've done Insanity programs, cycling and other BeachBody programs.

Pros:
- I liked that this was an independent African-American production.
- They each have individual segments and instruction techniques, which focus on different muscles.
- I also liked that there were a few moves that were new to me (unlike other videos that seem to cycle the same movements).
- You can modify the equipment requirement (i.e. I replaced the kettle bell with a weight in Ellen's session).

Cons:
- I felt the movements were jerky (i.e. a bicep curl didn't really reach the full extension and contraction before you were on to the next rep).
- On a few occasions, I felt like they forgot their instructed moves and weren't in sync with their support cast.
- I wouldn't necessarily purchase all of the equipment (i.e. jump rope) because it really wasn't utilized much in Lana's session.

All in all...I like the duo and will utilize this DVD occasionally. I plan to follow the meal plan but utilize a more challenging workout routine this one.",1465948800,19,1630,4.708771929824562

7602899,5,B01AIO7JQ0,"This is a great workout. I did this with one of their previous 21 day challenges and lost 9lbs. I ate sensibly during this time period as well by loosely following their meal plan (I followed it to a tee for the first week,then did a little of my own thing the next 2 weeks). There are two 25 minute segments (each run by either Ellen or Lana), a warmup, and a cool down. Ellen's segment has 4 arm related segments. Lana's has 4 lower body, ab, and cardio segments. The workout is tough but manageable. I would say a beginner could definitely do it but maybe with less enthusiasm than how they're doing it and some slight modifications like no weights. The background people are not professional so it's actually a little motivating to see regular, but fit people doing the workouts. I think I prefer their 2nd DVD, Black Girls Workout Too, because it's a little bit more fun and maybe it's because my arms are weakest but I find myself dragging through Ellen's segment. It is tough and I just want it to be done. But this DVD still has interesting music, the ladies are still motivating and energized. I have tried other workouts like the 30 day shred and I keep coming back to these ladies. The workouts are just more interesting and more fun than what else is offered out there. I would definitely give these ladies a try, either with this DVD or their others.",1464825600,9,1363,4.434262948207171

It's a good workout. It's something that I'll incorporate a couple of days a week with my regular workout routine just to switch it up.  I already try to workout 5-6days a week. I don't know if I'm disciplined enough to do the meal plan but it's easy to see why one would lose weight on it .  I MIGHT try it .  Overall I'd say try it. To me, it doesn't matter what you do, as long as you're moving and getting a full body workout. As with anything, it's about what's going in your mouth.  Enjoy!",1464393600,3,657,4.054263565891473

7602913,2,B01AIO7JQ0,"Two stars for the location only!  - This workout is unsafe, with no pointers as to proper form or technic when using kettlebells (or dumbbells).  I have been exercising to DVDs from the likes of Cathe Friedrich, Karen Voight, Bob Harper, Jillian Michaels, etc. for over 20 years and this Ectorcise workout is in my view totally unsafe.  I also felt is was somewhat improvised.  Ellen uses a fast kettlebell swing without explaining any proper technic and also in one instance holds a kettlebell in one hand and a dumbbell in the other and performs side bends with uneven weight.  Does not repeat on the other side.  She also does overhead triceps extensions with incorrect form, etc. And who would use 3-5 pound weights to simulate fast hitting of drums? ... hmm!  These are just a few observations about the first workout.  Lana doesn't do much better either although her segment is more dancy-cardio based, lots of squats, abs and less use of weights.  They both use a drill sergeant type cueing, which gets annoying after a while.  The music is repetitive too. I do not recommend this DVD!",1458604800,15,1092,4.73015873015873

7602916,3,B01AIO7JQ0,"Now first met me start off by saying I absolutely love the mother & daughter team! The first day I received my dvd it allowed me to go through all the chapters of the workouts. Day 2 it kept playing the warm up & allowed me to go to Ellen's challenge, which I completed. Now day 3 I'm trying to do Lana's & it keeps playing the warm up or Ellen's & does not let me go past that. I'm totally frustrated, I'm sitting here with my workout gear on & can't go past those chapters. I read the reviews of frustrated customers & thought well I've seen negative comments about their other DVDs & bought them anyway & didn't have any problems! Well my advice would be for the ladies to solve this problem before continually selling thes DVDs. Yes there a little more expensive than their other DVDs but from what I seen would be worth it if the dvr actually worked. Plus u can't put a price on your health. I'm actually thinking about retuning this dvd for a refund until the problem is solved. If your exited it was back on Amazon & are rushing to purchase the dvd I would suggest you wait until they get it all the way right & continue using your old DVDs like I am & have been. Really disappointed but things happen :-(",1457568000,18,1212,4.183760683760684
7602917,1,B01AIO7JQ0,"Extremely disappointed. Dvd won't go past Ellen's challenge. I know this fix is to simply return or exchange, but who wants to have to go through such a hassle. These women make too much money to not be able to afford better production. This is my time and money being wasted. A shame.",1457395200,7,285,4.39622641509434

7602920,5,B01AIO7JQ0,"Very well priced for the value you will receive. I challenge everyone that has said negative things about the DVD to:
1. Actually do the workouts for a FULL 30 days
2. Stick to the 30 day meal plan
3. Post before and after pics

In 30 days I will update all those who are considering buying the DVD, so far I can tell you after three days I feel that my posture is improving slightly and I have a bit more energy during the day and am more alert. Stay tuned for pics",1456790400,14,466,3.9574468085106385
7602921,5,B01AIO7JQ0,"This DVD is worth ever cent spent!  I joined the 21 day fitness ECTORCISE in Feb (last month) and not only were they supportive, but the recipes and workouts are great! I was unable to finish due to travel, but I am at it again this month!!!! You will NOT be disappointed in purchasing this mother/daughter duo!!!",1456790400,18,313,4.491228070175438
7602922,2,B01AIO7JQ0,I am a fan of the Ector mother and daughter workout DVDs. I have used the two previous ones and lost weight doing it daily and following the meal plan. However this DVD is horrible. It does not follow any type of particular routine and is basically all over the place. The only reason why I gave it two stars is because of the meal plan. The meal plan is excellent! It's very good and healthy. I ordered this DVD however I don't even use it. I only use the second Black Girls Workout II. This was a waste of money for me.,1456790400,7,521,4.067961165048544

7602926,5,B01AIO7JQ0,The DVD exceeded my expectations. I did not have the 1st set of DVDs that they produced so I was not familiar with their product.  I found the duo on Instagram and I'm happy I did.  The workouts are fun and motivating. If you complete both sessions you will feel the burn.  Great job ladies.,1456099200,26,291,4.254545454545455

7602931,4,B01AIO7JQ0,"This is a very challenging video! And I really like it! Each routine is fast paced, a lot faster than BGWT2, in my opinion. However, I do miss the  breaks from the BGWT2 video, as the breaks really helped to get the necessary equipment (e.g., dumbbells) into place before the next routine began. I also thought that the BGWT2 menu was better and easier to navigate. But overall, if you're looking for a great workout and want results, this is the DVD you should get.",1455062400,6,466,4.482352941176471

They are extremely motivational, the setting is wonderful and I will continue to support their work very good workout. Vitamin Ellen is amazing I have yet to come across a women her age that works out as hard as she does and her legacy will continue on through Lana. I love seeing two women of color working out and taking care of their bodies it's very inspiring. I salute them both and I hope they continue making dvd's for people like myself who don't live in ATL and are unable to take their class. I love and appreciate them both!!!!

7602934,3,B01AIO7JQ0,"I have never done any of their dvd's before. So I had no expectations. That being said, I really wanted to give this dvd 5 stars just for inspiration and motivation alone. Seeing Ellen look so great at 63 is inspiring! The moves are good. I like the quick low reps approach. I love Ellen's dumbell stroll and drummer boy. My biggest complaint about this dvd is that they really didn't cue proper breathing when doing the moves or proper form. That is essential to engaging the core, avoiding injuries, engaging optimally the right muscles, etc. I love the mother and daughter relationship! They really have something else that no one else is selling. Also the title menu is a bit frustrating. When trying to choose the title you want, it plays the title you hit next. For example I finished Ellen's segment and wanted to jump to Cool Down. As soon as I pushed arrow/next to go pass Lana's segment, it played it. I had to hit stop and then next. Good workout, it was just missing that one thing that could have been more professional as trainers. I wish these ladies the best. They really have something special. I look forward to purchasing their next dvd if they address these issues. I think it will be worth it.",1454371200,12,1214,4.5227272727272725

They also provide a full 30 day fitness plan that include filling soups and yummy smoothies. These ladies rock!",1494892800,,377,4.5588235294117645

8747474,4,B01AIO7JQ0,"This workout definitely gets your heart pumping and the sweat flowing. My only critique would be the timing. It seems like they were pressed for time when putting the segments together. There are a couple of times only one specific arm or leg are worked before the segment ends. Naturally I would continue the workout on the other side, but not having that part on the video is a little annoying.",1489708800,,396,4.591549295774648

I was debating this for a while, that was such a waist of time, I could have been doing the workout.  I got this yesterday.  I'm loving it Im doing Ellen's Challenge that lady is kicking my butt.  My shirt was soaking wet and I sat out for about 2-3 minutes.  I liked it so much I did the first 2 sections a second time right after.  I worked out for 35 minutes and burned a total of 622 calories per my fitbit.  I can't do the jumping right now so maybe at a later time I will do Lana's.",1489536000,,585,3.816666666666667

8747477,2,B01AIO7JQ0,"Two stars for the location only! - This workout is unsafe, with no pointers as to proper form or technique when using kettlebells (or dumbbells). I have been exercising to DVDs from the likes of Cathe Friedrich, Karen Voight, Bob Harper, Jillian Michaels, etc. for over 20 years and this Ectorcise workout is in my view totally unsafe. I also felt it was somewhat improvised. Ellen uses a fast kettlebell swing without explaining any proper technique and also in one instance holds a kettlebell in one hand and a dumbbell in the other and performs side bends with uneven weight. Does not repeat on the other side. She also does overhead triceps extensions with incorrect form, etc. And who would use 3-5 pound weights to simulate fast hitting of drums? ... hmm! These are just a few observations about the first workout. Lana doesn't do much better either although her segment is more dancy-cardio based, lots of squats, etc. and less use of weights. They both use a drill sergeant type cueing, which gets annoying after a while. The music is repetitive too. I do not recommend this DVD!",1486166400,2,1087,4.756613756613756
