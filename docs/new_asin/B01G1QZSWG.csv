7753081,4,B01G1QZSWG,"Performance is great and energetic as all Twisted Shows are.  A stampede!!  I don't mind how the dvd is broken up with clips, however is it horrible how the companion cd is organized.  It would have been amazing if it was a show was in order of the set list and not broken up with pauses in between the songs.  You can't stop rock n Roll is completely destroyed by the sequencing.  The mix on the cd is better than the surround on the blue-ray. Still a great document of a legendary Band.",1469404800,7,488,4.204301075268817
7753082,4,B01G1QZSWG,"I just saw the TS documentary ""We Are Twisted F'n Sister"" (which was outstanding, by the way) and so I've been on a Twisted kick ever since.  Dusted off my old cd's and cranked 'em up.  When I heard that Metal Meltdown was coming out, I figured what the heck.  I was especially interested to hear what they sounded like with Mike Portnoy on the drums (RIP AJ Pero).  The result:  it's really, really good.  The setlist is what you'd expect and the show is high energy.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the show is cut up and features interviews and other stuff in between the songs.  I'd prefer to just have the show uninterrupted, with the documentary/interviews completely separate.  But that's a minor point.  The band sounds great.",1469318400,12,752,4.503703703703704
7753083,5,B01G1QZSWG,Holy crap!  This is as good as you're going to get!  The sound is alright in my book!  And look at the value!  You get an audio CD plus a DVD and Blu Ray of the concert!  Plus a 93 minute documentary of the band plus a live photo gallery on the Blu Ray!  All for only $13.99!  The concert is awesome and so is the documentary!  We're Not Gonna Take It from anyone that complains about this great deal!  I Wanna Rock!,1469232000,6,416,3.9156626506024095
7753084,3,B01G1QZSWG,"The 5.1 DTS mix on Blu Ray is bad on this. I'll be curious to hear from others on this.

The performance is great. The PQ is great. The interviews and documentary is also great.  I can't add anything more than that.

Edit July 26, 2016: Just got done listening to the CD on this. Totally brickwalled to distortion. Unbelievable. Don't believe me? Here's a screen shot......",1469232000,21,373,4.537313432835821
7753085,1,B01G1QZSWG,"The DVD is fine but once again like the documentary ""We are twisted f****** sister"" [BD] that I also ordered, the blue disc in this package does not play in my [BD]player. Is this some kind of encryption issue? Somebody explain this to me, because all my other Blu-ray discs play fine in my player many of them are brand new as well.",1483920000,,333,4.301587301587301
7753086,4,B01G1QZSWG,"Great Bluray but could have been so much better!  The mix of the band is excellent!  They absolutely killed it on this night. (They pretty much did that every show they've played.  I've seen them over 30 times and have never seen a bad show from them.)  Which leads me to my complaints with this Bluray.  I was at this show and the crowd was nuts!  The energy that night was fantastic!  You expect the audience to sing along with We're Not Gonna Take It but this crowd sang along with every word during Under The Blade!  Every word!  This was an amazing show!  The problem is that as great as the band sounds on this video, they did not capture the energy of the room at all.  The crowd is barely audible in the mix at all.  Dee was repeatedly impressed with how loud the crowds was this night but on this disc, you hear Dee urging the crowd to sing along and there's nothing.  You can't hear the audience at all.  For some, that might be a good thing so take that for what it's worth.  It is a fine line.  But I just felt that they lost the energy of the show by having almost no audience reactions.

My other complaint?  Personally, I hate it when music video directors try to be cute and chop up the show and feel the need to stick interview footage throughout the show while chopping off some of the end or beginning of some of the songs in the process.  They also cut out almost all of Dee's in between song banter with the audience.  I consider Dee to be one of, if not the greatest, front men in rock and roll so his interaction with the audience is part of what makes a Twisted Sister show so great!  Now, the interview footage is great.  Don't get me wrong.  My big issue here is that they chop up the performance to insert interview footage then you watch the bonus features and every minute of the interview footage that was spliced into the performance was included in the bonus features so it's just being duplicated!  Give me the whole show and then leave the interviews as bonus footage if that's going to be the case.  If there were no bonus footage and just the clips spliced in, I would have been fine with that but if you're just going to duplicate it in both places, what's the point?

I was also a bit disappointed that they seemed to minimize the fact that this show was dedicated to the memory of their late drummer AJ Pero.  That was a big focal point during the performance but almost all of Dee and Jay Jays comments about AJ ended up on the cutting room floor.  With that said, the video of AJ's drummer solo was awesome the way they worked that into the show.

With all that said, if you're a fan of Twisted Sister, it's still well worth picking up!  The price is great for a 3 disc set and the performance is excellent!  The band sounds awesome.  Just try to imagine the intense out of control audience reacting to the band because that's what was actually there that night.  With Twisted Sister calling it quits in 2016, this is a great disc to remember them by.  If you love this one, then pick up the Live at the Astoria DVD/CD set as that one is amazing!  That might be the best Twisted Sister live DVD to be released.",1483401600,,3151,4.238655462184874
7753087,5,B01G1QZSWG,Oh my goodness!!! It is so awesome to see yourself in a video! We are in many shots of the crowd becuse we were right in front of the stage. This video brought back all the excitement and electric feeling we had at the concert!! The extra footage and interviews are great! I have Loved Twisted Sister since I was an early teen. They were a big part of my life growing up. Thus was a great tribute to their drummer that passed away earlier that year. Brought back soo many great memories. One of the best shows I've ever been to.,1483056000,,528,4.186274509803922

Until I changed discs to something else.  If you want to be immersed in the sound of the concert experience then this disc is not for you.  If you don't care and will only be watching with the sound coming from your TV then I guess you will enjoy.  My 2 cents!",1473984000,,400,4.037974683544304

7753107,5,B01G1QZSWG,"I've been a Twisted Sister fan since the early club days I used to see them at the Main Event,  Emmett's and Zaffy's in NJ.  I just watched the Blu-ray last night as was blown away with the bands powerful live performance and Dee's amazing vocals after 40 years. This is the highest quality concert film release that I've ever seen released by Twisted Sister  and the Bonus Doc is exceptional. The Stereo and 5.1 Surround Mix is awesome as well. The full package comes w 3 discs (DVD-Blu-ray-CD) and is really a great value.",1472774400,,524,4.494736842105263

7753113,1,B01G1QZSWG,"The video quality is great and the performance is alright. Snider and Portnoy hold their own, but the rest of the band really need to be tighter! Neither are they playing complex music, nor are they short on experience. There is no excuse. what sad is, the sound. The 5.1 mix is vague without any oomph, the drum sound is minuscule. The stereo mix is no better, the entire thing is treble-y and basically s***. I'm not bitching, just sad.",1471824000,2,438,4.4875

7753117,5,B01G1QZSWG,"TWISTED SISTER's Metal Meltdown is their finest work ever!!!
An amazing look back at the future of TWISTED SISTER!! In the midst of their 40th Anniversary & Final Tour, long time drummer, friend, and brother A.J. Pero passed away.
This concert was already scheduled to be filmed at the Metal Meltdown event in Las Vegas.
After much discussion, the band decided to resume the Tour with Legendary Drummer Mark Portnoy (Dream Theater, Winery Dogs, etc).
Ironically, years before, A.J. eerily chose Mike to replace him ""in case of emergency ""and decision to continue the 2015-16 Final Tour in A.J.'s memory!!!
The Multi-media 3 disc set includes the entire ass kicking concert (Stereo and 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound).
Filmed at The Joint (Hard Rock Las Vegas) and available together in a CD, DVD & Blu-Ray package.
This package also includes a 90 min BONUS DOC on the band from their start in the mid 1970's, playing in local clubs, not being able to get a record deal and how by believing in themselves they proved to the Record Companies they should be signed.
Footage also remembers the contributions and passing of A.J. that includes historic footage of A.J. performing an amazing drum solo that's cleverly edited into  ""Burn In Hell"".
The Editing, use of Cool Animation, Storytelling and Stellar Live Concert performances Are The BEST I've ever seen in any concert film release.
The Rock Documentary alone is worth the price of admission.
It's my favorite Rockumentary since Spinal Tap.
The stories pull you in and before you know it, the Rockumentary is over... leaving you in the mood to now watch the entire concert again.
You'll hear about the band, their interaction with club owners, the Mob, and who the driving forces in the band are...
All of this for less than you paid for a couple of beers at one of their concerts!",1471305600,5,1826,4.8152866242038215

7753124,3,B01G1QZSWG,While the energy is there this is not a great live album.  The mix is distorted and Deep is out of tune a bit too often.  If you're just getting into TS the Live in Hammersmith is a better album with more songs.  Still give thumbs up to the band for rocking this hard after 40 years.,1469491200,2,283,3.9298245614035086
8761902,4,B01G1QZSWG,I am a lifelong huge Twisted Sister Fan so i love everything they ever released. I got this album a few months ago and it is a regular listen for me a great live album it was recorded on there final tour with the great Mike Portnoy on drums filling in for AJ Pero who passed a few years ago. Twisted Sister play songs from all there albums just no Love Is For Suckers songs which is a drag cause i love that album.but they play some Come Out And Play songs  which they never played in the old days. I Believe In Rock And Roll and Come Out And Play  and The Fire Still Burns are played and are great versions also  Under The Blade Shoot E'm Down I Am I'm Me from the first (2) albums and the Stay Hungry songs are better and heavier live Stay Hungry The Beast SMF and a killer version of The Price Dee sounds amazing for someone who is over 60 .it is a great final album and a tribute to AJ .reccomended for any heavy metal or Twisted fans you will enjoy this cd dvd.,1533340800,,966,3.9690721649484537

8761905,2,B01G1QZSWG,"I usually wait to read reviews whenever a concert blu ray is released hoping to get some info on the quality of the picture and sound, if there is quick cut edits, interview segments or backstage footage interspersed between the songs and the overall performance  of the show. So I purchased this because I'm a fan of TS (duh!), the price was awesome and I was told by someone that this featured a play concert only option as I was disappointed to hear that interviews interrupted the flow of the show. Well if it's there I couldn't find it.

This first blu ray by TS is a letdown in some of those departments. The picture quality is mostly good. There is some grain present in some scenes but overall it's great and the editing was actually  done right for this release! No quick cuts or split screen! And the performance from the band was great as usual although I have seen them do better on other dvd releases like Live at Wacken.

The sound as others here have mentioned is a letdown. It sounds okay but there's just not enough kick to it. It's loud enough but lacks a good bottom end.

The biggest disappointment for me was that the interview and backstage segments that interrupted the songs were repeated in the bonus feature documentary! Why not just leave those there and give us the full uninterrupted show which by the way is heavily edited to begin with I guess so that they would have time for the interview segments that we get again in the doc!

So this was a pretty disappointing first blu ray release from TS for me. Performance wise the band is on fire as usual and the pic quality is really good but the rest is a let down. Release Live at the Astoria on blu ray as it's a lot better than this.",1512604800,,1714,4.3573667711598745
