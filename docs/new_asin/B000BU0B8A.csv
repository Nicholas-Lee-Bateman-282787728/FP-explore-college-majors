8092670,4,B000BU0B8A,"Well, many U.S. viewers will find this to be ""tonally impaired.""  The low budget and general sleaziness of the material don't help that, but then again, as someone who has always been suspicious of message-mongering and the rendering of messy events in ""perfect"" acting and plotting, I find this refreshing.  Scenes are eccentrically shaped, discontinuity shots a la Doris Wishman abound, and basically it's so seat of the pants that it's hard to fault it as exploitation, since it's just not cold-blooded and polished enough to seem like it's getting over on its abject characters and situations.  Basically it's a spirited romp through the culture of porn, without either approving of it or pretending that we could just get rid of it and be better off or ""different"" somehow; and while the middle admittedly gets very whacky, and the ending veers sharply into what might be a high school play based on ""Peeping Tom,"" this film never loses its entertainment value.",1389052800,,966,4.987577639751553
8092671,3,B000BU0B8A,"""When I bought this movie I thought that  it will be a great foreign film with the drama quality of Cruel Intentions or something like that. How ever I find it to be somehow empty and I'm not talking about the Hollywood Fanciness but to the kind of material that makes a movie great. There's a lot of nudity. When you finish the movie you mind might go like Hu!!!. Not to recommended from my part.""",1229644800,,398,4.2368421052631575
8092672,3,B000BU0B8A,"While it's never as salacious as the plot makes it out to be (young guys record sex tapes), I was especially pleased to see a young Finnish lad getting the rough treatment from a pair of married swingers.
I gather the camera serves as a metaphor for those living vicariously through others. But hey, ""Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer"" and ""Auto Focus"" kinda touched on the same themes to greater effect.",1191888000,,405,4.638888888888889
8092673,3,B000BU0B8A,"Well, I had two jokes in mind with this review. The rejected one was, ""I like this movie better when it was called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Auto-Focus/dp/B000087F7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Auto Focus</a>."" The accepted one was, ""This movie does for video tape what Jonestown did for Kool-Aid!""

Smart-[...] jokes aside, and that's where they should always be, I suppose, this movie was... interesting. It wasn't great. It was good, I guess. Not four-star good, but good. And certainly... interesting.

The plot centers around young Taavi, a nice-to-look at Finnish boy who has just inherited the house his family used to own. His parents died ten years before and he's been raised by his aunt since.

Taavi seems like your basic nice, if somewhat emo, sort of person. His friends seem to care about him. Hard to tell if he really cares about them, though. It gets especially hard, as it were, once he begins to get into the idea of taping his friends having sex.

These sexual activities start out pretty mundane, but pretty quickly end up in some interesting places, including an S&M threesome. Taavi's only remark about that is, ""That was horrible to film"", leaving one to speculate whether he means the content or the difficulty he had in getting any decent shots.

For the voyeurs among us, this is an interesting movie. On the one hand, there's acres of nubile flesh to oogle throughout the film (and, for the record, Markus and Jere both look quite alright when naked!). On the other hand, the movie makes some strong comments on the very idea of voyeurism.

The movie is not rated in the USA, and would clearly, and correctly, have been given an NC-17 had it been. This is NOT a film for minors.

This is not, as I said, a great film. It's ok. It passes an evening. I recommend it, but only just. It could have been great. Instead it's... acceptable.",1187913600,,1910,4.95
8092674,5,B000BU0B8A,"This is certainly not a comfortable film to watch. Despite the many sexual scenes there is little to titillate .. for example, one boy pursues an adventure in S&M that descends to levels he hasn't anticipated, while another sexual situation -- between a husband and wife and played back from an old videotape -- is almost too horrifying to watch. (I won't say more about the latter for fear of spoiling a key revelation about one of the characters.)

The main story follows a group of rich kids who create a kind of ""film club"" where membership requires you to secretly videotape your sexual exploits. Periodically the boys get together to watch everyone's work and award the best submission. As you might expect, things gradually spin out of control. One boy loses his girlfriend, another meets a woman with whom he wants much more than a sex-tape relationship, and another (the hapless and awkward one) struggles to achieve a conquest that will impress his friends. (Perhaps too predictably, his story becomes the most tragic of all.)

Director Siili paces everything beautifully and the film's editing deserves special mention .. it incorporates all the video footage in a manner that is virtuostic while managing not to be headache-inducing. This movie was much better than I expected and delivers a powerful message about the cost of pursuing one's own pleasure at the expense of real connection with others.",1159574400,8,1413,4.983050847457627
8092675,4,B000BU0B8A,"Walk down any street in metropolitan areas and the omnipresence of the Big Brother camera is frightening: cell phones now capture all  manner of images from friendly to horrific, cameras at stores' entries scan customers like a police state, police  have license plate detecting cameras on their vehicles, strolling youngsters and tourists have the ubiquitous camcorders recording sights and other people's privacy - the list is endless.  This strangely mesmerizing film 'HYMYPOIKA' (Young Gods) from Finland addresses these facts and builds a story around just how invasive and destructive the personal hand-held video camera has become.  '1984'? Yes, in many ways it is.

Director Jukka-Pekka Siili has taken an idea from Jaajo Linnonmaa, passed it through screenwriter Jukka Vieno, and though Jarkko T. Laine is credited as the cinematographer, Siili records this story as though he were the one holding the intrusive camera.  The technical aspects of the film  - black and white into color into white noise screen into abrupt movement, odd angles, etc - are a strategically important aspect of the film's success.

Taavi (Jussi Nikkil), the enigmatic 18-year-old lead, has just inherited his long-deceased wealthy parents home and estate.  It is highschool graduation and Taavi's birthday, and after his fiends greet him au natural and are arrested (the policewoman Helena Pkknen - Laura Malmivaara - is attractive and forgiving), Taavi invites his friends to the mansion for a wild party.  Taavi lives with a recording camera to his eye, a machine that allows his to keep interpersonal distance from everyone.  Among his friends are Jere (Reino Nordin) who considers himself a woman's man, Markus (Jarkko Niemi) who appears the well-adjusted one, and chubby, pierced Sami (Ville Kivel) whose sexuality is ambiguous.  The party gets wild, guests sleep around, and Taavi records it all!

When Taavi's friends discover his deed, a pact is made: each of the four young men will videotape their own sexual encounter.  This contest begins innocently enough for the boys, but when the girls photographed en flagrante discover the ploy, anger erupts and varying degrees of tragedy occur.  As with many invasive games, this contest progresses  to humiliation, rape, and worse, and finally leads to the truth about Taavi's secrets about his parents and his own personality disorder - all focused on the video camera as the source of evil.

The film is daring, entertaining, frightening, cruel and dissecting all at once.  While many may dismiss this as just another example of foreign film exploitational technique, there is much more to the story than meets the first encounter.  Siili has uncovered truths about our current preoccupation with privacy invasion and they are loudly criticized here.  This unrated movie is not a film for the squeamish, but it is a significant statement that needed to be made.  Grady Harp, October 05",1128211200,18,2928,5.240343347639485
8092676,4,B000BU0B8A,"Young Gods (Hymypoika) shows what happens when four male high school students in urban Finland make a pact to accelerate their personal growth by secretly filming themselves having sex with women and then viewing each others' films.  The four have a variety of outcomes and receive a variety of responses from the women involved.

The blond on the DVD cover, Jere (played by Reino Nordin), pushes the idea the hardest and gets goateed, romantic Markus (Jarkko Niemi), and awkward Sami (Ville Kivela) to go along.  Well-off orphan Taavi (Jussi Nikkila) will compulsively film what he can get away with but does not want to be a performer.

The women swept up in this are Jere's girlfriend, Reeta (Jenni Banerjee), Markus's girlfriend, Mira (Mervi Takatalo), and Jere's sister, Jenni (Evi Suppala).  Markus discovers an interest in a policewoman, Helena Paakkonen (Laura Malmivaara).

The students' plots are found out.  Girlfriends change or drop boyfriends, there are rape attempts, there is a suicide, some women like being filmed, and one student discovers shocking films of his family's past.  To move the action along, there are nude parties, public nude celebrations, standard sex scenes, an S&M anal sex scene, sex with a prostitute, nude conga-lines and more.  Some even have homework.  There is a lot going on.

Jere, Markus, Sami, and some extras provide full male nudity. The women do too, though they are more discretely positioned.  Although none of the characters is gay, there are enough bodies and borderline events to keep a gay audience entertained.

The photography is remarkably good.  The actors are convincing.

The extras are trailers, TV spot ad, music video, and English subtitles for the Finnish.

Some ideas are so bad that seeing is believing.",1127433600,27,1770,5.136363636363637
