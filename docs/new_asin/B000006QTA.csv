7904705,4,B000006QTA,"The video is a good introduction to the history of fighting ships in the Age of Sail.  It begins with the development of the warship in the age of sail and battle tactics that led to the nomenclature ""Ship of the Line.""  There is the usual commentary by historians, which I enjoy very much.  There is discussion on the construction of the ships of the line and types of shot.  The viewer really comes to understand how much work and material went into the construction of one of these ships.  Those ships were truly amazing feats of work.  Also included is an extensive discussion of the history of battle tactics and how they changed. There are reenactors, but their inclusion is a bit irritating, as we never see enough of them to really get a sense of what is going on. This means they aren't on screen long enough, nor do we see their faces most of the time.  Maybe they're just too ugly to show their faces?

I really liked the fact that this video covers the Chesapeake campaign (that was the naval leg of the Battle of Yorktown) in the American Revolution.  Typically, we get only the Napoleonic Wars; and we do get that, but it was refreshing to see something else.

All in all, good stuff, but sometimes it moves a bit slowly.  Give me a couple clips from ""Damn the Defiant"" to spice it up a bit.",1130976000,,1305,4.373443983402489
