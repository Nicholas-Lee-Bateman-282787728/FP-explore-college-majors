8575687,4,B00BYS0XVI,"The Company We Keep is what black America and America needs.  It's a well crafted story about having it all - a career and a relationship under the backdrop of hip hop.  The lead female character is a strong woman with a good head on her shoulders as she tries to balance running an independent record label and an engagement to an athlete. Now I know this could turn you off by what you see on especially reality TV in regard to music artists and athletes.  But this film isn't vulgar and is a pleasure to watch.  The black women in the film are intelligent and the men are well behaved.  Of course there are conflicts but it doesn't insult our intelligence with outlandish bickering.  This is a date movie, good for a teen sleepover and for anyone who wants to see a good romantic comedy.  So, check out the DVD - you will not be disappointed!",1375574400,,845,4.343949044585988
8575688,4,B00BYS0XVI,"This film was  of interest to me because it mixes up several areas I love.  Strong women,artistic expression,philosophy and history. It has an original approach of self -talk brought into  the action. Love scenes fun. The various characters were enjoyable to meet.  nicole milner",1375315200,,279,5.2727272727272725
8575689,2,B00BYS0XVI,"The title has a duo meaning, both on a personal level, and attempting to keep a company. The story centers Teri (Nefetari Spencer) who manages a record label, one that has financial problems. She is engaged to Dwight (Stephen Bishop) who is a multimillionaire football player. She is attempting to promote Sean Starr (Jamie Starr) on a limited budget while laying people off and moving the company from Beverly Hills to East LA.

Teri does a number of asides to explain her feelings. This really doesn't do anything but highlight the inadequacies of the script. I found the characters to be flat and poorly developed. They branched out at the end instead of coming together, The script was flat also. It was a real yawner watching one poorly written and acted scene after another. A rather trite drama.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. Brief sex/love scenes.",1373155200,2,864,4.870748299319728
8575690,5,B00BYS0XVI,This is a fun movie - my favorite part about it is that it has a lot of strong female characters. Watched it on a date and definitely enjoyed it.,1370390400,3,145,3.8666666666666667
