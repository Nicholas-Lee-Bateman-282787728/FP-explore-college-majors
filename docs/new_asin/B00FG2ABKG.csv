effects and information.",1392422400,,151,6.4
5990875,1,B00FG2ABKG,"I just received this set and was highly disappointed that it is basically the exact same release as Clash Of The Gods!! I already own Clash Of The Gods on Blu-Ray, why would I want it AGAIN, on DVD?? There was no mention of this in the description on Amazon, nor on the DVD cover. My rating is for the poor product description, which I don't fault Amazon for.

I'm disappointed as I had already opened it, popped it in the player, then said to myself ""This looks awfully familiar. Don't you already have this?"". To make it worse, Clash Of The Gods is available on Blu-Ray for about $4-$5 less!!!",1387324800,23,595,4.36036036036036

8615467,5,B00FG2ABKG,"Nice selection of oldies and goodies from the History Channel. Great for introductions to the myths and religion of Ancient Greece, but does not touch a deeper scholarly level, obviously. It's entertaining and I've used it to expose my niece and nephew to mythology.",1505865600,,266,5.068181818181818

8615469,1,B00FG2ABKG,"Many of the stories are the same as you've heard before with little new content. Every story was ""and this is how it is like Christianity."" Was very upset as it didn't seem like an unbias and educational series.",1470096000,2,211,4.435897435897436

8615471,3,B00FG2ABKG,"Good, but each segment, is in a 50 minute segment, but is only a 20 program. Repeats itself. Probably good for classes in a small segment.",1444262400,2,138,4.346153846153846

8615475,1,B00FG2ABKG,"One-third mediocre overview program and two-thirds empty calorie television, ""Greek Gods, Heroes and Monsters"" is a sad, pathetic rehash of previously existing ""History"" programming not so cleverly disguised as a new offering. Nothing else needs to be said.",1393459200,5,257,5.7894736842105265
