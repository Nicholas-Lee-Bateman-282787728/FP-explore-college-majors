job of acting with a average script.",1454976000,,128,3.9615384615384617

8175024,5,B000N5W5PK,"This rare video from the mid 70's is a must have for those of us who appreciate that great era of television.  It is a sequel to the mini series ""The Blue Knight"" starring William Holden in 1973. Joseph Wambaugh's character Bill ""Bumper"" Morgan is probably brought more to life by George Kennedy than Holden because Kennedy's  depiction.  Kennedy is portly and fits the description of Morgan as described in Wambaugh's book of the same name.

As in the mini series, Bumper Morgan walks a beat on the gritty streets of Los Angeles.  He is quick to overlook the prostitutes and minor criminals on his beat for information about bigger crimes and suspects.  Morgan is respected by people on the beat and his supervisors.  One of the best scenes in the Kennedy movie is when Bumper wraps his cruiser radio microphone cord around the arm of a juvenile suspect and pretends that it is a ""lie detector"".

The music in the movie is top notch and will take you back to the 70's. Enjoy this video as it is one of the best of the 70's.",1358899200,8,1024,4.467741935483871
