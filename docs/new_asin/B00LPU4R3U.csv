8667736,1,B00LPU4R3U,"I worked in Skid Row for 5 years. This is not a documentary. This is a kid walking around, filming addicted users, while he is guided by their drug dealer pretending to be a Skid Row liaison.",1476662400,2,191,4.1891891891891895
8667737,5,B00LPU4R3U,"I happen to live within walking distance of the area famously known as Skid Row, near my neighborhood in the downtown LA Arts District. Want to see what kind of human suffering our fellow men and women are living in their everyday lives? Feel the humanity and have compassion for the victims of a system that has essentially forgotten these souls exist in the world. The next time a homeless person comes up and asks you for a dollar - try connecting to the individual rather than avoiding their eye contact or just simply offering them your change so you can get back to your entitled lives.",1420934400,,592,4.542056074766355
8667738,4,B00LPU4R3U,Makes me thankful for what I have. I think it gives a good view of how poorly some people in this society live. it is just one mans view of a slice of the poverty many of our citizens reside in.,1417910400,,194,3.7560975609756095
8667739,3,B00LPU4R3U,"Upon seeing the trailer for this documentary the day it was released on Reddit I was enticed and excited to view it.  I ordered a physical copy ( not recommended if still available rent it for $5) for $20.  The reason for this lack luster review is because the film is not well rounded.  I thought they would give the various drug epidemics in Skid Row equal light but instead 85% of the footage and coverage in the film is about crack and the vast majority of interviews are with 40 something year old tweaked out black crack heads who have been up for days.  There was two very short interviews with heroin users.  The reason I gave it 3 stars in place of 2 is because there was good material covered by a rent a cop who gave an in depth breakdown of skid row and an interview with an older black man who explained how nearly impossible it is to get off the streets due to social and governmental barriers.

All in all the documentary was very redundant after the first 30 minutes.  It was never ending footage of various folks hitting crack pipes and saying drugs are bad compiled into 90 second clips. Rinse and repeat that compromised the bulk of the film, especially the beginning and middle.  At the end it resembled an episode of drugs Inc. from Nat Geo.",1411689600,4,1262,4.363247863247863
8667740,5,B00LPU4R3U,"This documentary is an eye opening look at the problems that America over looks. It is well put together and raw, I give it 5 stars!",1409702400,,132,4.115384615384615
8667741,5,B00LPU4R3U,"Skid Row  Los Scandalous  by Shanks Rajendran is an honest and raw look at life in the streets and the gutters  of Skid Row, Los Angeles. This documentary has a rare genuine quality to it that only an independent filmmaker can offer; its original and uninhibited approach, as opposed to the predictable commercial angles offered by large film companies, is impressive. There is no desire in the film to maintain and push an agenda  there is only the concern to capture in film things as they are. And to show life as it is. That approach is truly refreshing.

It was initially a bit difficult watching a film about the fallen, the forgotten, the neglected and about the darker side of society but soon the Dickensian quality of the film and Shanks Rajendrans ability to transport the viewer to a different world took control.  Rajendrans film technique and the various commentators (including Lavell Putman) - and the numerous people of the streets who open up their hearts and speak directly and boldly - make the film unique and gives it the power to open up the mind of the viewer.

This is not a film for the squeamish or those comfortable in their middle class enclaves  this is like one of the darker plays of Shakespeare (Timon of Athens, Measure for Measure) that confronts us and forces us to re-consider our world. Skid Row  Los Scandalous is engaging and it forces us to question the way things are.",1408579200,,1410,4.653225806451613
