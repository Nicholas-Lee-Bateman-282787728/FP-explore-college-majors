7844849,5,6303359566,"Excellent, traditionally-styled production with much power and stage excitement.  Robert Hale's Dutchman has a suitably romantic look, with great anguish and sorrow in his voice and demeanor.  Julia Varaday is a beautiful looking and beautifully singing Senta. All of the cast members look the part, and are wonderful in their roles, with no weak links anywhere. This production is far superior, in my opinion, to the ""on location"" production that is otherwise available on dvd, with Hildegard Behrens, etc.  As a long-time Wagner fanatic, I would highly recommend this production above any other that is available on video or dvd. (NOTE: Some of the sellers' comments on the ""used"" availability list apply incorrectly to that other ""on-location"" production on dvd, not to this production, which is conductd by Wolfgang Sawallisch and was filmed onstage at the Bavarian State Opera.)",1123632000,8,883,5.338129496402877
