7829590,4,6302703646,"I liked the character of Tasha Yar and found myself peeved that she was killed off--especially so easily. Her death was just cold blooded murder and not a suitable end for someone like her. This tng episode is a great way to open up a discussion on the nature of evil with younger viewers too. Evil lies and takes pleasure in the pain and destruction of others. That said,i found the character of armis to be strange. This episode is kinda of like the paranormal meets Star Trek. I'm glad the Armis character never came up again in future episodes.",1372550400,,548,4.49
7829591,4,6302703646,Nice video but too much commercials in the beginning. Somehow I missed this episode and now completed my collection with this one. I'm not going to say anything about the content except it is a certified ST stuff. It sure is worth watching.,1114560000,,240,4.604651162790698
7829592,3,6302703646,"The villain in this episode, Armus, isn't really that much of a threat. And he's really annoying too. Tasha Yar dies so quickly, we almost don't believe it happened. Counselor Troi and Expendable Crewman #28b are trapped in a shuttlecraft surrounded by a large walking chocolate syrup monster. This guy can force people to do things for his own amusement, but fails to be amused by the Enterprise crew. Picard never even breaks a sweat in defeating Armus. This is a significant episode only because of Yar's death. The rest is just the usual muck from the first season.",1043107200,,569,4.757575757575758
7829593,2,6302703646,"It's farewell to Tasha Yar in this episode as the Enterprise crew find two of their number held hostage by a malevolent being.
Troi and ""Ben"" (who is barely given any consideration) crashland on Vagra II and are captured by Armus - an evil creature looking for the amusement tormenting others brings it. It inflicts mental torture on all those it meets: Troi, Riker, Crusher, Geordi, and even Data. And it kills Yar, just because it can.
This wasn't a bad concept for an episode, but it fell rather flat. The special effects are sub par, the dialogue often clunky, and the pacing is jerky due to action on the planet being broken up by certain other events that the director felt needed lingering over.
The ending fell flat for me, too. Picard's admission that he did not know whether he, too, had found pleasure in being cruel was a bit of a cop-out. And Tasha's farewell . . . yes, it was moving. But she had appeared so little in the series, to such limited effect, that all those farewell messages held no resonance with anything that had been seen in previous episodes.
It's a fine idea to have someone die in the middle of a mission, with everyone else left behind needing to carry on. Unfortunately, ""Skin of Evil"" just didn't have the emotional depth and strong plot required.",1031616000,,1284,4.562770562770563
7829594,2,6302703646,"""Skin of Evil"" is basically about a rescue attempt of two Enterprise crewmen on Vagra II (counselor troi and a mostly ignored, unimportant crewman whose name is never really mentioned) which results in a really senseless tragedy. An evil alien force named Armus kills Yar and torments the crew while they attempt to rescue Troi and the other crewman. I found the plot really average, and the special effects left a lot to be desired.
The only reason I bought this episode because my favorite character was Tasha Yar, and I collect ST:TNG episodes myself. If you are looking for a memorable, exciting episode, and you don't particularly care about Tasha Yar, then don't buy it. I don't think you'd like it.
However, the ending on this episode is its saving grace; it is really touching and great, and even I had to shed a few tears. At least they gave Tasha the proper send off! It's too bad that Yar dies senselessly in this episode and is soon forgotten by the crew.",985996800,6,967,4.595375722543353
7829595,5,6302703646,"The Early Demise of  Tasha Yar
In a very poignant episode; Tasha meets her tragic end.  Armus, the oil slick alien arbitrarily kills Tasha.  He seems to made of the remaining biological skin from a people who no longer need bodies to sustain life.  Following this so far??.....
Remember the living beams of light in the original series?  The Organians?  Well, folks it looks like when these folks evolved into life forms composed of light....Armus was the skin that was left over.........Yuck!
If you can suspend your belief in reality in this crazy sci-fi concept this episode is better than most.  Tasha leaves a holographic last message for the crew that will bring tears to the eyes.  If you can sit through the giant oil slick from space; you'll enjoy this one.",981676800,4,766,4.75
7829596,3,6302703646,"This episode takes place on a planet, where an evil skin (an oil slick) has been left by a vacated race...they 'shed' there negative qualities..forming this 'skin of evil' and left it behind. So. Well. Hmmm.  Mediocre episode...and to be honest, I always felt Denise Crosby overacted  anyway...her expression I felt was not subtle enough for STNG, too  over-the-top. So, I don't entirely dislike the episode. Nothing personal  Denise.",964137600,10,434,5.246376811594203
7829597,2,6302703646,"I think the writers made a big mistake with this one. Although I liked the character Tasha Yar a lot and didn't think she should have left, if they did have to kill her off, surely there are better ways than death by a  giant oil slick?
Instead of her being killed honourably in the line of  duty, her death seemed meaningless and took a back seat to other events in  this episode, such as Troi being trapped in the shuttle, and Picard's  negotiation with the creature, Armus, itself.
I've only forgiven The  Powers That Be because this was the first time a really major character got  killed off (Except for Spock who supposedly died in Wrath of Kahn and then  under went an amazing resurrection in Search for Spock). But then, Jadzia  Dax's death wasn't handled much better.
The one nice bit about this  episode is Tasha's goodbye speech at the end, which was really sweet and  touching, and brought a breath of fresh air into an otherwise poor episode.  Other than that, it was an awful send off for a good character.  'Yesterday's Enterprise' was a much better attempt.
I only got this  episode because I'm a collecter, and I'm a fan of the character Tasha Yar.  If you are neither, then I suggest you don't waste your money.",958780800,2,1229,4.502262443438914
7829598,3,6302703646,"This is Denise Crosby's last episode, and boy did the powers that be go about ending Tasha's trip with the Enterprise wrong.  Very anticlimatic.  I  liked some of the scenes, such as Troi's pleadings to the big black goo  thing, and it was cool seeing Riker sucked into it.  This is an important  ep in TNG lore, but not a stellar one.",940809600,,335,4.32258064516129
