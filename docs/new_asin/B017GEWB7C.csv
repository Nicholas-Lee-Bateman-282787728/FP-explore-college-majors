8739065,4,B017GEWB7C,"The general plot of this film was formulaic to most of Novarro's movies in that he once again portrayed a figure who loved but could not have the woman due to either cultural or class reasons.  But the underlying mystical narrative was genuine; Nigel de Brulier made a convincing holy man and I admit I could watch any film, however bad, with Ramon Novarro in it.  Aside from his ghastly makeup, he still cut a dashing figure of a wealthy Indian jewel merchant and although too eager to love the Madge Evans character, his boyish charm won me over.  Mexican accent aside, he is still magnetic and looks great in his costumes.  The film didn't do well at the box office at the time, but now its a charming period piece of pre-code Hollywood and I think should be viewed in that context.",1454198400,6,785,4.468531468531468
