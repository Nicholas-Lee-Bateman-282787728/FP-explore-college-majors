7949216,1,B00005OSOU,"For those looking to purchase the cartoon ""Family Dog"", you will be very disappointed in this package.  These are ""dog movies"", with Lassie, Rin Tin Tin, Yellow Dog, etc.  All fine and dandy if dog movies is what you are expecting to receive.",1137628800,,242,4.604651162790698
7949217,3,B00005OSOU,"It says it in the title...""The Family Dog.""  It's not just a normal life...it's every dog's life.  Bad days and good days and a family who's just as crazy...it's absolutely perfect!!!  I grew up with these cartoons and I will watch them forever!!!  It is a must see and you'll never understand what I mean until you actually see it for yourself.  It's a great comedy for the whole family so grab some popcorn, get a few sodas and pop in ""The Family Dog 5 pack"".  You won't regret it!",1070668800,,483,4.311111111111111
