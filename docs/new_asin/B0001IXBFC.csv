Almost a year ago, I noticed a lot of the songs on the Kids Sing Praise songbook we have (we have volumes 1 and 2 of the songbooks) were from that show. I Googled Kids Sing Praise and was glad to see it was what I thought it was. I am glad to be able to watch it again. I watched it on YouTube. My mom got a VHS of this a few weeks ago at Second Chance (a thrift store). It definitely looks clearer and nicer on the TV screen than on YouTube.

This show brings back great memories. I LOVE their Do Lord song, more than any other Do Lord song I have ever listened to! I love their happy, country music. My younger siblings really enjoy it as I was hoping for. On this VHS, why doesn't it list Down in My Heart on the songs on the back of the cover? Why does the back show pictures that are not from the show?

Shows tend to prohibit duplication which is totally understandable. Now that the company does not exist anymore, does anyone know if there is any way Kids Sing Praise songs can be legally recorded onto a blank CD or audio cassette, at least if we do not sell it? I would REALLY LOVE to listen to the Volume 1 Kids Sing Praise songs that were not on the video (like Step into the Sunshine). Can anyone use a special camera to upload Kids Sing Praise Volume 1 on YouTube that makes it look and sound JUST as clear as it does when we are watching it on a very good TV screen so that it NEVER goes extinct, even when VHS's do not exist anymore?

Kids Sing Praise is the BEST Christian children's show I can think of. It is DEFINITELY better than Cedarmont Kids! Cedarmont Kids is known to be good, but a lot of their music is more modern sounding than I would like, and I also probably do not care for Cedarmont's rhythms as much as I love Kids Sing Praise's rhythms. I watched Kids Sing Praise Volumes 2 and 3 on YouTube, but I do not find them as amusing as Volume 1. I REALLY hope Kids Sing Praise will always exist! It would be VERY sad if it did not exist anymore, wouldn't it be?

Kids Sing Praise's company *probably* stopped existing because it was not popular enough. I really wish it was. Kids Sing Praise Volume 1, even if others do not care for you, I ABSOLUTELY DO! You are GREAT!

I sure hope anyone who loves Kids Sing Praise can enjoy it as long as they want!",1522713600,,2428,4.05

I just can't let anyone else watch it because the picture is going up and down. Luckily I wasn't worried about the condition of the tape.",1372636800,,294,3.8360655737704916
