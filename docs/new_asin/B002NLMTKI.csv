2. I purchased this for my children. It's a cute video BUT you cannot understand the pronunciation because there is no captioning, there is no English translation. I could even do without the English translation as long as they at least showed in writing HOW to pronounce the words. It is a beautiful language, but I don't even understand what they're saying.

Not worth it at all.",1325289600,,426,4.51948051948052
