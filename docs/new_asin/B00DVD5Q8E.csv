5859295,5,B00DVD5Q8E,Best movie I purchased this Christmas season.  This is a sensitive touching movie.  May be a little sad for someone who has lost a love one but I think the movie could be helpful.,1386288000,,179,4.235294117647059
5859296,3,B00DVD5Q8E,"I really hate deceptive marketing. Slap a different name on the product, but it's the same thing. I ordered both videos for the holidays and find out they are both the same movie. Do I need to start double checking every movie I buy because of this practice? That means we can expect ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""It's a Wonderful Christmas Life"" to be the same movie. Now I have to decide to return it, or give it as a Christmas gift, grrrr!
All Grinchyness aside, it was a really good movie.",1384128000,28,492,4.301075268817204
5859297,5,B00DVD5Q8E,"My husband and I sat down to watch this movie a couple nights ago (starting our Christmas movie watching a wee bit early this year!!!) not knowing anything at all about it or its story line.  Well, I have to tell you, we absolutely LOVED it! On so many levels!  I would highly recommend it, in fact, I may buy a few copies more to give out at Christmas time!  This will be a movie we will watch again and again!  (and there was nothing ""inappropriate"" in it...at all!  That is a super plus to both of us :)",1383523200,44,506,4.070707070707071
5859298,5,B00DVD5Q8E,"This was a really cute movie. The child (Ioan ?)is outstanding as was the Mom (Toni).  I wished it had ended a little differently; but, how could it?",1382313600,7,149,4.321428571428571
5859299,5,B00DVD5Q8E,I loved the mystical feel of the film and gosh the ensemble of such wonderful actors! Its a quiet film with lots of humor as well as some emotional tear evoking scenes. All in the perfect amounts for a peaceful evening at home.,1483574400,2,227,4.3023255813953485

5859301,5,B00DVD5Q8E,"What a cute! movie. This is a movie for the whole family, nothing sleazy, no bad language, just a fun movie. You will love the little boy in the movie he is very charming. Ioan Gruffudd plays the husband, I really liked him in the movie ""Amazing Grace"" and he does a good job here. I had never heard of Toni Collette who plays the wife, but she does an excellent job acting along side the little boy in the movie..",1481068800,,414,4.1234567901234565

5859304,5,B00DVD5Q8E,This film is a Christmas classic. I've enjoy it more each time I see it. The way a small child (who is an angel) arrives to a young family dealing with the loss of a child ingeniously changes their life is so incredibly touching. The love of Christ radiates through the film and what else could Christmas really mean?,1479340800,2,317,4.389830508474576
5859305,1,B00DVD5Q8E,"The movie is great but the false advertising is a real pain.  This is advertised as a second movie and it is just the same movie as Angel in the House with a new wrapper.  I will probably give as a Christmas gift but I hate being suckered into buying a ""set"" thinking I was getting two different movies.",1478131200,,303,4.11864406779661
5859306,5,B00DVD5Q8E,"Warning: This is the same movie as ""Angel in the House,"" not a continuation. It was also released overseas as ""Foster.""  Do not buy this one and ""Angel in the House"" together, as you will be aggravated.",1473552000,,202,4.45945945945946

5859312,5,B00DVD5Q8E,"This is the same movie as Angel in the House and Foster. I bought this one because they listed it as having English subtitles but they lied - NO English Subtitles and no other languages, and no extras.  Aside from that, this is a WONDERFUL movie, very sweet. I watched it on Amazon Prime and immediately ordered it. Amazon Prime had subtitles, not sure why the DVD doesn't. I don't consider it a Christmas movie, although it's Christmas time at the end. But highly recommend. The DVD case says it has English Captions but my newer TV does not get closed captioned.",1457481600,3,564,4.529411764705882

5859324,5,B00DVD5Q8E,"I ran across the movie by accident a couple of years ago and loved it immediately.  It is now in my ""holiday collection.""

They are both the same movie, only the Christmas one shows it as having subtitles.  I give that one star but the movie itself is 5 stars..very sweeeeeet story.  So that averages out to 3 stars.  The volume is also low and heavy accents.  Just crank it up...it is worth it!",1422230400,,399,4.549295774647887

5859342,5,B00DVD5Q8E,"This is a really good movie. Ioan Gruffudd and Toni Collette are really good as a couple who have lost their son, and how it has affected them as a couple. they are trying to have another baby, and then a foster child comes into their lives and shows them how they can heal their relationship and reminds them what their life is truly about.  They soon remember what their marriage is truly about and remember what brought together in the first place, and to heal their pain and loss. the ending is very touching and they find out their foster child was really an angel sent to them to show them the way back to their life, and he must leave  but they realize he showed them what they needed in life.  It has a very special message for the way to heal and go with life and love.",1420848000,,778,4.173333333333333

5859348,5,B00DVD5Q8E,"This is our new favorite Christmas movie. I bought one for my best friend who loved it also. She did say that at times she had trouble understanding the English and Scottish accents. My Mom was born and raised in England and my Grandfather was from Scotland, so I didn't notice the accent. It is a sweet story and the little boy in this movie is amazing.",1419206400,,354,4.298507462686567

5859350,4,B00DVD5Q8E,a very sweet little film. Don't buy it if you rant to watch a Christmas movie.the movie has no mention of Christmas until they popped a tree on the set towards the end.  still worth a look.

5859352,5,B00DVD5Q8E,absolutely brilliant picture. Eli is just brilliant-I told my husband that I wanted one just like him-it is just a pity that lads at 7 years doesn't really come like him hey. This picture will make you want to watch it over and over because you will never get enough of Eli. He is the most lovely wee lad you will come across in a wholesome family pictures. This picture is family friendly and it contains clean material. If you are tired of the rubbish on telly you will love this picture.

Purchased from Wal Mart and their policy is that once you open the dvd, it can not be returned unless it's defective and then they will only replace dvd with an exact duplicate.
