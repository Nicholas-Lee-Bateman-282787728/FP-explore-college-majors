2054152,4,B00021A1W4,"Well, it was much better than the original, but literally had nothing to do with ""The Last Statement of Randolf Carter', which it claimed to be.

Nonetheless, it was a Lovecraft based film, so therefore I HAD TO watch it  Nor was I disapointed.  It had the excellent acting of John Rys-Davies (you know, the axe-slinging dwarf in the Lord of the Rings Movies), and the gorgeous Maria Ford (naked scene), and even Julie Strain!  So, we have nudity, the Necronomicon, pretty good acting (for the most part), and demons?!?!? COOL!

Add it to your collections, HPL fans!

Go on.

Do it!

2054155,4,B00021A1W4,"Not exactly Lovecraft, but quite true to his spirit.
This very well-made sequel picks up exactly where the first film left off:  Miskatonic College student Randolph Carter and his best friend, Howard (Phillips Lovecraft, no doubt), are the only survivors to walk out of a haunted house, carrying with them its hidden treasure  -  the famed ultra-rare Necronomicon, by Abd al-Hazred.  They alone know what killed the other college students in that house, a conjured demon from the seventeenth century that has now been safely contained by the Necronomicon's sorcery somewhere in tunnels beneath the local graveyard.  Concerned that the demon might ultimately escape again and wreak more havoc, Howard and Randolph and sympathetic magic researcher John Rhys-Davies track the imprisoned female demon to her lair, and manage to exorcize her, freeing her host (the original 17th century conjurer's daughter), who takes a liking to Carter.  Unfortunately, the released demon is now twice as nasty (not to mention twice as ugly), and hunts her host woman down to repossess her, savagely killing anyone who gets in her way.
This one performs like Dean Koontz reads, with a plot similar to his famous novel, Watchers, but with more friendly humor.  Writer-director Jean-Paul Ouelette is an Orson Welles protege, and knows how to keep the pace flying while providing a real visual feast with the camera.  The cast, which also includes David Warner as a cannily secretive college dean and Peter Breck as a homicide cop in over his head, is terrific, and the production  -  especially for direct-to-video fare  -  is surprisingly good.  The actresses playing the two halves of the demon-girl (one of them being Julie Strain, in a lot of really believably scary makeup) are especially good.
Colorful, generally pretty exciting, consistently entertaining.  Good stuff.",1031270400,2,1854,5.219594594594595
2054156,2,B00021A1W4,"This film is fun in some parts, but it's too slow getting started.  I don't have a problem with slow films as long as they have atmosphere and scenery or something interesting happening, but this movie lacks all of these.  After seeing some remains of some victims in the beginning, some may think that the film is going to be fast paced and bloody, but it takes a long time for the first kill scene.  The movie just doesn't get moving until around the second half.  Unlike the first film, there's no gore scenes that are worth mentioning, but the monster looks good. The first one was available in both R and unrated versions, but this sequel is only available in an R-rated version. I've never read anything about this film being censored, but the gore has been drastically toned down compared to the first one; it makes me wonder if the original negative has some extended gore scenes.  There's some nudity, and some sequences later on in the film were entertaining, but I didn't care for the film that much overall. Ford is fully nude for quite a bit in the film, but she has overlong hair that blocks most of it.  I also tried watching it again and the replay value wasn't good.  If you're a 90s horror fan you might like this, but I'm not really into 90s horror films.  There are some films from that time that I like, but I don't like the film style of most of them.

The full screen DVD looks good, but there are no extras.",1346803200,,1431,4.369811320754717
2054157,1,B00021A1W4,"Well I had purchased this movie through Miles of Movies, a seller via Amazon and I took it with me on a trip intending to watch it on my laptop while gone. I purchased this item in February & left it in its wrapper up until yesterday. Suffice to say, I got shafted. It's unwatchable as there is all sorts of green code popping up on the screen halfway through the film. This is a DVD defect (I'm guessing the printing) BUT there is no way for me to exchange it with the seller and the seller has no way for me to contact him/her. Amazon's policy is that it's too far past the complaint date so here I am stating I feel slighted but with nothing to do other than throw it in the trash. I don't want to sell or give it to anyone because I wouldn't want that to happen to them either.

I guess when you order 10 or more videos at one time, it's still mandatory to open them all right then & there and watch each one to make certain there's no problem with video quality.

Being a Lovecraft fan, this movie was something I was looking forward too.",1337558400,,1043,4.082926829268293
2054158,4,B00021A1W4,"Ahh nothing more enjoyable then the golden years of hilarious 90's B horror on a nice quiet evening. Already being our favorite decade of laughable horror, The Unnamable II has made a name on our list of classics. Right from the opening scene you just get that feeling of ""oh yeah this one's got it"" as most of the time period contain. It came with all the goods including a sweet cheaply made creature, hilarious acting coupled with even worse dialogue, and some of the greatest special effects we've seen since Grim.

The Unnamable revolves around a girl that had been possessed by a demon for quite some time dwelling in the underground. Because this demon is so bad a** they decided there nothing good enough to name it by (hence the title). Once some murders take place near a college campus a few of the students (who were way too old to be students) decided to try and crack the case only to unleash the beast in hilarious fashion. Once they put the entire universe at risk their ring leader and his awesome sweater must take the demon out and finish him.

After watching this one we have yet again found another 90's classic to throw up on the board. In no way is it good by conventional means but for us it worked just fine. Maybe we're a bit bias because we happen to love the 90's flicks but can't see this one not being enjoyed by B horror lover's out there. It's got enough going for it making it worth one watch for sure. There were even a few jumps, which may have been inspired by a few drinks, where the demon pops out of nowhere hissing like a cat. Mmmm that sounds good..I'll have that.",1269561600,,1605,4.364548494983278
2054159,1,B00021A1W4,"If you want to get rid of company put this on, it was one of the worst movies, and eventhough it was bad you could not help but watch(LOL)",1264982400,,138,3.793103448275862
2054160,4,B00021A1W4,"I'm glad I found this before it was totally out of print. It's fairly close to the source material (the book). I enjoy cheesy flicks very much, and this one fills the need. Now I only wish I could find part 1 (not the vhs).",1264896000,,223,3.977777777777778
2054161,5,B00021A1W4,"To all those looking for The Unnamable on DVD, Anchor Bay have released them both in the UK as a set (still available from amazon.co.uk when last I looked), but you'll need a region 2 and PAL setup to view them.
Personally I thought they were very good (especially when watched back-to-back as one movie spread across two disks).",1229817600,,329,4.593220338983051
2054162,3,B00021A1W4,"I never saw the first unnamable but i wanted to give this one a chance anyway cause it sounded interesting.the movie is not all bad but it couldve been better then the final product.the demon looks good though i must saw and it had two or three moments of cheap pop up scares,which are good.the bllod and gore are decent but some kills you don't get to really see(like the lady cop toward the end)and i think thats a waste.the plot is ok but the movie drags in some places.i would say rent but that would cost around six dollars and i got a copy on amazon for only three so if your courious id say buy a cheap used copy.i hear the first one was better so im hoping they put it on dvd one day.a few of the kills were gory and thats always a plus.",1225929600,,745,4.04054054054054
2054163,2,B00021A1W4,"This movie is the sequel to H.P. Lovecraft's The Unnamable and is not as fun.  That film was based upon the H.P. Lovecraft short story of the same name.  I wish THAT film was available on DVD.  It involves a haunted house in which resides a creature that is the half-human, half demon daughter born to a warlock and his wife two hundred years ago.  Long after their death, she has continued to reside in the house which is not far from a local college.  Get the picture?  Macho college kids, haunted house, making out with young women, awesome-looking scarey monster who likes to rip hearts out doing battle with nerdy, bookish heroes familiar with local legend and black magic.

The story of the sequel starts immediately after the conculsion of the the original which itself was a ""B"" movie but with a number of chuckles and quirky characters (played by quirky actors who, just as the film's director, did not take themselves too seriously).

Despite having the same cast and director, there are few chuckles in this sequel and it loses some of the charm of the first because it was darker and the actors and director apparently intended this to be more serious. The monster isn't quite as cool as she was in the first film but is probably the highlight of the movie.

If you are a fan of the first film, you'll probably like this one. But the first film while, not a great film, is actually one of my favorite horror films...mostly because the monster is so cool-looking.",1197763200,3,1474,4.574144486692015

8019953,5,B00021A1W4,"Ive never had the opportunity of seeing the first film so I have no idea what I might be missing.  This sequel, on the other hand, is a hoot, thanks in large part to the bizarre performance by Mark Kinsey Stevenson as Randolph Carter.  Hes confident and hilarious because he is so confident and matter of fact.  Unflappable, he has no problem dealing with demons or watching friends die horribly.  The plot, such as it is, involves separating a woman from the demon shes become.  The problem requires defeating the demon before it kills them.  This eventually leads to a showdown in the Arkham Library.  John Rhys-Davies and David Warner put in brief appearances.  Equally amusing is Charles Klausmeyer as Howard, Carters unofficial sidekick and comrade in arms.  I don't know if this adaptation of H.P. Lovecrafts work was meant to be a comedy, but I appreciated it as such.",1479340800,,875,4.78

8019956,1,B00021A1W4,"Fans of H.P. Lovecraft the master of the horror genre will find this a great letdown. Lovecraft was mature, suspenseful, intelligent. This movie is childish, predictable, boring. The naked woman might keep your interest 2-3 minutes and the stereotype trademark winged demon creature might get your attention once or twice but that is it. Total failure.",1420156800,,352,5.303571428571429
8019957,1,B00021A1W4,"I don't toss around one-star reviews, but this one deserves it. Other than the typical B-movie horror junk (poor costuming and SFX; bad acting--although Jonathan Rhys-Davies brings a level of respect here), what bogs this movie down is that it's way too  long and clogged  up with ridiculous exposition that drones on and on and on and on. Plus Mark  Kinsey Stephenson is perhaps the most unlikeable presence on screen  that  I've ever seen (not to mention thoroughly unconvincing as a college student!).

Even at that, it had potential: Anytime that you have Maria Ford in the cast, you have potential. She runs around naked throughout nearly her whole appearance, but you never really see anything because she's wearing a huge, long wig that covers up the good parts. What a waste--no point in casting an actress known for her scorching nude roles if you're not going to show her nude. Two or three exposures and suddenly this becomes a three-star film. As it stands, it's basically unwatchable particularly in its latter half.",1413590400,,1029,4.91907514450867

8019961,4,B00021A1W4,"I like this film, even with the flaws evident from the low budget.  The cast is pretty solid, the script has some great one-linters (the person discussing how strong a creature would have to be to punch, then pull it's fist out of a human body is priceless) and the creature is fun.  The ending is a suitable downer, considering it's based on a Lovecraft tale, but the film's pacing is an issue.  Too many scenes of endless chases down hallways and such make for an acceptable running time, but drag the film down.  For lovers of low budget cheese only.",1366761600,,553,4.445544554455446
8019962,5,B00021A1W4,"THE UNNAMEABLE (1988) was, frankly, just another college-kids-in-a-haunted-house type of flicker.  The 1992 sequel is far superior.  Subtitled THE STATEMENT OF RANDOLPH CARTER, it makes much better use of H.P. Lovecraft's source material.  I particularly liked Mark Kinsey Stephenson as Carter; he conveys a scholarly nerd with just enough backbone to carry the story.  David Warner and John Rhys-Davies have small roles, but nevertheless lend class to the production.  It would seem that the director, Jean-Paul Ouellette, learned from the shortcomings of the first film and crafted a much better sequel.  Oh - and I should mention that Scream Queen Julie Strain plays the monster!",1362787200,,682,5.447619047619048
