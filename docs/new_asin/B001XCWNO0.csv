3827209,4,B001XCWNO0,"""The Guild"" is an independent web series about a group of anti-social gamers who join an online guild in a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) similar to ""World of Warcraft"" and finally meet in real life after only knowing each other virtually. The results range from hysterical to lovable. The series is the brainchild of the luminously charming redhead Felicia Day, who is best known for her recurring role in the final season of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-The-Vampire-Slayer/dp/B000AQ68RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy The Vampire Slayer</a>&nbsp;and more recently for her starring role in the sensational independent Joss Whedon project&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Horrible-s-Sing-Along-Blog/dp/B001M5UDGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog</a>. She writes and produces the show herself and also plays the main character, Codex (the characters all prefer to use their online monikers). Turns out, the girl's not only a spectacular green-eyed beauty and talented actress, but she's also has a great sense of humor and [loving sigh] is a hardcore gamer. Is there a more perfect woman on this Earth? I don't think there is. I'm reviewing the first two seasons at once because I am a lazy, lazy man.

""The Guild"" advertises itself as being made ""by gamers for gamers"", but the fact of the matter is I think anybody with so much as a slight curiosity about geek culture will have a blast with this show. The episodes run short at usually 6-9 minutes which made them perfect for internet viewing. As with any low-budget show the strength is in the characters. Codex is more than adorable in her social awkwardness, overzealous neurotic video blogs, and manic alarmism. Her psychiatrist is considering filing a restraining order. Her love interest Zaboo has taken her online flirtations a bit too seriously and tracks her down in real life to move in with her. If you think that's crazy, wait until mommy shows up. Vork is the middle-aged guildmaster who lives in a house his parents own and is pathologically cheap. I mean cheap as in ""takes his own cheese to the restaurant and offers to sell it to his friends wholesale so they don't have to pay the outrageous extra cost for a cheeseburger"" cheap. Tinkerballa is the socially disconnected Asian mega-hottie who spends every second she is not online with a Nintendo DS in front of her face. Even when she is on the phone. Now THAT is a gamer. Her complete disregard for other people is amusing at worst. Clara is the overweight housemom who locks her kids in the next room and ignores them while she games for days on end. Maternal instincts not quite what they oughtta be there, but it is hilarious seeing the kids flood in when their father takes down the gate and then rush at their mother in slow-motion, unplugging the computer's ethernet cord as she flies at them saying ""NOOOOOO!"" in that deep slo-mo voice. Rounding out the primary cast is Bladezz, the slacker who would rather screw everyone else up then take the game seriously. This leads to a predicament early on where the Guild has to vote to kick him out not realizing that he has possession of all of their in-game wealth. These gamer stereotypes are given real heart and are extremely fun to watch.

So far, there have been two seasons of ""The Guild""; 21 episodes total not counting the specials. They originally appeared online and can be downloaded on Xbox Live. But for non-gamers or the gigabyte-impaired, the series is now here on DVD. Subplots where the diminutive Codex meets an amazonian first-person shooter (FPS) gamer girl, Zaboo takes on a martial-arts master for her love, Clara secretly launches an in-game assassination campaign on a guildmate, Tinkerballa takes advantage of Bladezz' attraction to her to clean him out, and other hijinks assure that no episode is a dull episode. While there are plenty of gamer references in the show, they are usually low-key enough that the average viewer won't be left out.

In the end, ""The Guild"" is a satire of interpersonal relationships in the digital age and it's just plain funny. Likable characters and humorously quirky dialogue never go out of style. If nothing else, the show is something different from some very funny people who love what they are doing. This is what all good things in life flow from. Enjoy.",1243987200,4,4442,5.183844011142061
3827210,5,B001XCWNO0,"I do not know if I would call this a parody of geek culture...I would call it an exploitation in that the characters all exhibit very real gaming personas.  Anyone who has played an MMO can relate to the characters which is why I think it is an instant hit with them.  For non-gamers, some of the lingo may not be instantly identifiable but the characters are not caricatures and have heart and soul.  These characters make allow the non-gamer to relate on a simple human level.

The DVD is loaded with great extras and, so far, at least one Easter Egg.  I could go on and on about the wonders of this DVD (and its partner, Season Two) but since you are already reading the reviews, you now you want to buy it.  Not only that, you know you will buy it.  And as an added bonus, when you introduce this series to your friends, you will be able to tell them about you basing you purchase on the rave reviews it has received rather than tell them truth about you being a closet gamer and you are, in fact, a character on the show :)

This DVD and Season Two are what I like to call a Win-Win-Win situation.",1242691200,3,1102,4.18957345971564
3827211,5,B001XCWNO0,"Felicia Day has created, written, and starred in one of my favorite shows of recent years. Each five- or six-minute episode is funny, sharp, so smart, and beautifully acted by a talented comic cast. As others have pointed out, when the Guild ran out of money midway through this season, fans reached into their own wallets and helped keep the show afloat. Now we get the chance to do the same by buying the DVD.

Between this and Dr. Horrible, it's obvious that webshows created without interference by corporate bosses mark one very promising future for entertainment.

And the best news: There's already been a Season Two (equally terrific and available here on Amazon), while a third one is on the way. I can't wait.",1242691200,3,719,4.744
3827212,5,B001XCWNO0,"The Guild is about people addicted to online gaming. They neglect their own lives, their children, their personal needs, all in service of their avatars, their game personas. Gamers can talk to but cannot see each other, but this guild of six decides to meet in the real world, and thus the central conflict that drives the story.

The Guild was created and written by Felicia Day (a gamer herself) of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame. She is also the star of The Guild and her character, Codex, introduces each episode. Felicia is one smart cookie, toting bachelors' degrees in both mathematics and music from the University of Texas, where she entered at sixteen and was valedictorian of her graduating class.

The Guild as a web series is on the leading edge of a wave of the future. As network television increasingly buckles under to reality and game shows, which cost much less to produce, good series are increasingly going under or going to the web. The Guild, in my opinion, is the best series ever. Felicia is simply adorable as Codex. She's witty, insightful, and naive all at once. The other characters are also unique, original, and are like no one you'll ever seen on a major network. It's just simply the most refreshing entertainment I've seen in a long, long time.

Perhaps the most appealing quality of The Guild is how personal it comes across. At the beginning of each episode (which are five to eight minutes in length) Felicia, as Codex, speaks directly to you, the viewer. She explains what has been going on with her since the last episode and foreshadows a little of the action to follow. These short introductions remind me so much of something out of Shakespeare. They are so smart and classy. The editing of these initial monologues is also artistically interesting. Take a look for yourself.

In Buffy, to me, Felicia never really stood out as an actress I would want to follow, and it's rather mystifying how she can be so appealing in The Guild. But she is. Just a part of the girl's magic. Once you've seen an episode or two, you'll be searching her website and blog for more information about her. As I've already said, she's simply adorable.",1242691200,9,2172,4.692913385826771
3827213,5,B001XCWNO0,"The fact that I am able to type a review here at Amazon for The Guild is kind of amazing.  Considering this, the first season, was funded by Felicia Day with donations/help from the audience and considering how unlikely such a collaboration is, it's amazing that the show has become such a hit, spawning additional seasons and a more mainstream acceptance.  Not that it should be very surprising since it's probably one of the funniest and heartfelt shows I've seen on either the web or TV.

Stepping back a bit, The Guild is a show about...well, an online guild of friends who live in the local area but only know each other through their online alter-egos.  Cyd/Codex (Felicia Day) is struggling with what appears to be an addiction to their current MMO, dealing with a psychiatrist who hangs up on her and a gnome warlock who shows up at her front door, thinking they are romantically involved.

What works for The Guild is the fact that the characters are so vivid and played pitch perfectly by the entire cast.  Yes, they verge on walking stereotypes, but the hilartiy and the love for these people (some of the kinds of people I know personally) gives the show a much needed heart.  What's great is that, while a gaming geek will get the most enjoyment out of the show, I have shown this to friends who think gaming is limited to Rock Band and they, too, kept coming back, week after week, to watch it.

You can go view these shows online, still, either via the website, MSN or Xbox Live.  I'm personally glad that there's now another option in this Amazon exclusive.  Give it a chance.  I bet you'll come back laughing.",1241654400,25,1626,4.553264604810996
3827214,5,B001XCWNO0,"The Guild is a comedic gem lovingly directed at and about geeks and gamers, but the cast is so great together and Felicia Day (Codex) is so charming and lovely that this show would be hard for anybody NOT to love. Filled with in-jokes and geeky subtext, every episode is an absolute riot to watch over and over again.",1240963200,9,317,4.389830508474576
3827215,4,B001XCWNO0,"In the setup for THE GUILD, SEASON 1 Cyd Sherman (Felicia Day) reveals that her therapist has dumped her and she has lost her job. Her only outlet is her online gaming guild: the Knights of Good.  At the start of the season, Cyd, aka Codex receives and unexpected surprise when Zaboo (Sandeep Parikh) shows up at her front door and expresses his love for her. Her online character, Codex and Zaboo have done some serious flirting in the game and when Zaboo learns of all her recent troubles, he decides it's time to make his move and show up unannounced.  Codex seeks help from her Guild friends and the group reluctantly agrees to meet in person. The leader of the Guild, Vork (Jeff Lewis) has an alternative motive for agreeing to meet: the Guild's rouge, Bladezz (Vincent Caso) is causing trouble and he wants input on what to do. Tied to the main storyline of Zaboo moving in with Codex is the arrival of Zaboo's domineering mother: she controls every aspect of Zaboo's life except for his gaming and he is desperately seeking an escape, but needs help.

From the premise, it might seem that THE GUILD is a silly web series. However, it's not. It is true that the characters can be outlandish at times (particularly Clara and her parenting skills), but the series is never mean or cruel. As outlandish as the characters can be, they are sympathetic and never cartoonish (surreal, yes, but never cartoony). In actuality, THE GUILD is more of a parody than it is biting satire.

The series was marketed as a show ""about gamers, for gamers, developed by gamers,"" but the humor and heart of the series is something that just about any adult can appreciate. I've never played an online game in my life, but I really enjoyed watching THE GUILD. Also, it helps that this was a web series as the episodes are between 6-9 minutes. So, you can binge watch the entire season and not feel guilty. Overall, I'm glad I joined THE GUILD, SEASON 1 and look forward to the further adventures with this group.",1397779200,,1995,4.579831932773109

3827217,5,B001XCWNO0,As one of the few hardcore female gamers I know this series is a breath of fresh air. Hilarious and dead on it peels back the layers of gaming complexity and gives voice to those too glued to their computers to speak up :) we are a diverse crowd hiding our uniqueness in a fantasy world and are nothing like the stereotypical troglodytes most people picture. Thanks to Felicia Day for breathing new life into a tired topic and giving those whose fantasy life is richer then our reality a chance to be appreciated!,1361491200,,513,4.468085106382978
3827218,5,B001XCWNO0,"Codex -- aka Cyd Sherman -- has a sad, sorry life. Her only social life is her RPG guild, her therapist has dumped her, she has no job, and now her online friend Zaboo is living in her apartment.

And that is only the setup for ""The Guild Season 1,"" a hilariously geeky webseries that follows the misadventures of a bunch of RPG geeks in their offline lives. Everything about this series is mind-blowingly funny -- the actors, the scripting, and the many troubles that these nerds encounter in their lives (ranging from an angry Hinjew mom to personal betrayals).

In the first season, Codex (Felicia Day) is horrified when her fellow guild member Zaboo (Sandeep Parikh) shows up at her door, and declares his undying love for her. Having nowhere else to go, he ends up living on Codex's couch, even as Codex struggles with Zaboo's hostile mother. Will Codex be able to get rid of Zaboo without relinquishing him to the iron grip of his mom?

Meanwhile, the lecherous teen Bladezz (Vincent Caso) causes unrest in the group, causing Guild leader Vork (Jeff Lewis) to talk about the possibility of kicking him out. But it turns out that Bladezz has some clout with the group, no matter what they try to do.

""The Guild"" is one of those webseries that shows why conventional TV output is going the way of the dodo. This show is head-and-shoulders above bad sitcoms and reality TV -- excellent writing, hilarious running jokes, weird characters and jokes centering on the social misfits who are united by RPG gaming. It doesn't care that it's a niche series.

Most of the humor stems from the characters' personalities and their total lack of normal social lives (""I'm at your doorstep! Doorstep'd! Where should I put this stuff? God, I haven't logged on in like 21 hours!""). There's a bunch of running gags that wind their way through each season, leading up to a climactic battle with whatever is threatening the Knights of Good. Even if it's only an aging Indian woman with glowing eyes.

And the actors do brilliant jobs as the shy neurotic Codex, neglectful mom Clara, lewd teen Bladezz, smothering stalkery Zaboo, cold cruel Tink and fussy Vork. They range from merely strange to outright insane (Clara's parenting skills), and almost every line wrings some humor from SOMETHING -- one example would be the running joke about Codex's gay ex-boyfriend.

""The Guild: Season One"" ends up being like M&Ms -- each episode is small, but you just won't stop until you've run out of them. Addictive, insanely funny, and well worth watching.",1331337600,,2534,4.771689497716895

3827222,5,B001XCWNO0,"The Guild is about a group of local massive multiplayer online role-playing gamers (MMORPGs) known as The Knights of Good whose real lives eventually intersect with their gaming personas when the party's warlock Zaboo (Sandeep Parikh) moves out of his domineering mother's home and into Codex's (Felicia Day) life.

What ensues is a series of increasingly awkward moments, as each member of the Guild's hilarious foibles comes to the fore through the simple stress of social interaction. There is the sarcastic Gen Y ""griefing"" rogue known as Bladezz (Vincent Caso), the chipper and neglectful mother of three Clara (Robin Thorsen), the sarcastic and rude Tinkerballa (Amy Okuda) and the set-in-his-ways neurotic guild leader Vork (Jeff Lewis).  The entire cast is strong in their segments and the dialogue is whiplash fast, a necessity with so many characters in such small web installments.

The Guild delightfully tweaks its own gaming stereotypes while maintain a winking insider's love for gamer culture.  Day created this web series by drawing on her own MMORPG experience and it shows.  Only a gamer could create a show that both embraces and is ashamed by its obsession with gaming.

All of the Guild members are real precisely because their real lives are so unfulfilling.  With a few broad strokes, Day contrasts the weaknesses of each character's real life with their avatar's form of empowerment.  Vork is a control freak because he has so little control over  his own finances; Zaboo sees the game and by proxy Day as an escape from his overbearing mother; Codex caught her boyfriend cheating on her and is desperately trying to regain some control over her life. The Guild has more heart than most sitcoms on television.

The core of The Guild is Day herself. There's something about her that is both alluring and vulnerable.  She is able to create instant intimacy with her webcam confessions, ping-ponging from abject horror to smirking amusement to the verge of tears.  The season one plot wisely focuses on her as an object of Zaboo's affection (or obsession), and by proxy the viewers are invited to play along. Day has a girl next door quality that makes her believable - she's just pretty enough to remind viewers of the gamer girl they have a crush on.

I once met a gamer girl a lot like Day - and like Zaboo, was instantly smitten. Just like in the Guild, our own team of good-aligned characters was torn apart when online affection spilled over into real life.  And like Zaboo, I moved in with her. Fortunately, she didn't kick me out.

So I married her.  And thus began season two...",1281052800,,2609,4.882086167800454

It's a lot of fun & I love the way Ms. Day took an experience in her life & turned it into such a creative success. To me, the entire endeavor is entrepreneurialism at its best.

I found out about this web series via a Facebook link to the catchy music video, Do You Want to Date My Avatar? It was so playful and instantly recognizable to my inner Gamer Geek, I had to find out more about the characters it introduced.

Now I can watch the show start to finish without waiting for the online episodes to buffer, I can watch the audition tapes for some of the actors and view the scripts on my computer. That may not sound important, but in the rapid fire gaming conversations, it's not always possible to catch every well-placed phrase.

If nothing else, you can buy this DVD and share it with someone who doesn't understand your gaming addiction. If they don't get it, well, it's a small price to pay to avoid future grief when your raid runs long and you show up late for the dinner party date, wedding, music recital, Bar Mitzvah... you get the picture.

THE GUILD is one of the most successful direct-to-Internet series yet produced.  It was created and is written by and stars Felecia Day, who starred, along with Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion, in what is by far the most successful Internet-first project ever, DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG.  The series concerns a group of people who would normally have nothing to do with one another, but have been drawn together by playing World of Warcraft together.  For though who have never played WoW (I suppose such individuals exist), one of the things that you can do in WoW is form guilds who quest together.  From personal experience I can attest that you end up forming online friendships with people you normally would not spend much time with.  If you have played WoW, the show has lots of subtleties that will seem familiar and fun.  I've intentionally avoided meeting anyone that I play online with, but these poor souls decide to meet in person. (Though I never join guilds for person reasons.  I detest PvP [Player versus Player] and WoW is structured so that if one member of a guild fights a member of another guild, all members of each guild are thereby opposed to one another.  Since I could not find a way to be a member of a guild and not PvP, I played solo, which luckily isn't that hard to do in WoW.  BTW, I stopped playing WoW after maxing out several characters because of the staggering amount of time that gaming can absorb.  Never going to get that book written playing WoW.)

The Guild consists of: Codex (her online name), played by Felecia Day; Zaboo, a Hinjew (half Indian/half Jewish) who stalks Codex; Vork, an early middle-aged loser who lives in his dead grandfather's house (he lives off cashing his granddad's social security checks, and who is also a world-class tightwad and the titular head of the guild); Clara, the mother of three toddlers that she neglects to play online; Tinkerballa, a cute Asian girl who is so obsessed with gaming that she plays Gameboy while also playing WoW; and Bladezz, a long-haired teen who is not the most popular character on the show in Season One.  This exceedingly odd collection of individuals unhappily linked with one another provides a host of funny moments that shouldn't be missed.

Felecia Day has pretty much established herself as the hottest female actress on the Internet.  Though many knew her from her Season Seven appearance on BUFFY as one of the Potentials, most of her work has been away from either film or television.  DR. HORRIBLE made her on online star, a status that was quickly reinforced by the beginning of THE GUILD.  She also starred in the great, though unaired episode of DOLLHOUSE ""Epitaph One,"" which many regard as the best episode of DOLLHOUSE.  But again, unless you watch it on DVD, you won't see it at all.  Most recently she has become even more popular due to a music video based on THE GUILD ""going viral.""  If you haven't seen ""Would You Like to Date My Avatar?"" do so immediately.  Starring Day and the rest of the cast of THE GUILD, with music written by Jed Whedon (the brother of Joss), it is a delightful send up of online socializing.  The song is infectious, the performances delightful, and the lyrics witty.  And it completes the whole DR. HORRIBLE-""Epitaph One,"" and music video trilogy.  Jed Whedon co-wrote DR. HORRIBLE and ""Epitaph One"" with his wife Maurissa Tancharoen, and Maurissa is one of the performing dancers in the music video (she is one of the female dancers who back up Tinkerballa).  And Felecia Day starred in all three.  She is so adorable that I'd love to see her translate her online and DVD success to film and TV.  Until then, we have this delightful online series.

The rest of the cast are stereotypical gamer geeks who bring great color to the series.

This is a very good series and the DVD is reasonably priced. While the entire series can be found on-line, I bought the DVD to support the show.

Highly Recommended! The second season is also out,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Guild-Season-Two-Amazon-com-Exclusive/dp/B001XCWNOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Guild - Season Two (Amazon.com Exclusive)</a>",1247961600,,882,5.62406015037594

There's a lot of video on the internet these days, and this is the best of it.  I couldn't recommend it more enthusiastically.",1247875200,,296,4.528301886792453

There are two seasons available and while each episode is only a few minutes long they are all filled with ""delicious drama"" the third season is set to come out in the fall. *I love Zaboo*",1246838400,3,324,4.491525423728813
3827241,5,B001XCWNO0,"I saw Felicia Day on 'Attack of the Show' and she mentioned The Guild, and I ordered it from Amazon.  Entertaining, but also almost painfully right-on at times.  I highly recommend this CD to everyone.  If it were possible to subscribe to Felicia Day Inc (FDI) and in return for a monthly/yearly stipend to FDI, in return receive a CD or access to view the latest chapter(s) I would go for it.

There is a huge amount of talent in this crew and it will be very interesting to see what they accomplish in the future.",1245974400,,515,4.333333333333333
3827242,5,B001XCWNO0,This show is about a group of people who play World of Warcraft and decide to meet in real life. They have nothing to talk about and are all socially awkward. Great fun and witty.,1245715200,,179,4.142857142857143
3827243,2,B001XCWNO0,"I watched all of season 1 and half of season 2 because of the reviews I read on here saying it was so funny and so good. I kept hoping something would happen to explain those statements. It didn't. There are only two things good about this show. 1 each episode is short, and 2 Felicia Day. Her character is endearing but beyond that this is not a good show. I understand this is a parody of gamers but the characters are not likeable AT ALL, and not funny. Maybe I just don't get it because I'm not a gamer but for the average veiwer I'd suggest watching something else.",1245110400,5,570,4.1909090909090905

The actors do a great job of bringing them to life, but they would be nothing without the excellent writing of this show.
