2211676,5,B0007GP73C,"My son is 3 years old and adores the Wiggles. He has every single video/DVD that they have released here in the USA.  Presently, this latest dvd is his favorite, he would watch it all day if allowed.  I agree that the Wiggles do not feature as much as in some of their other dvd's, but if your child is anyway musically inclined he/she will love this dvd.  My son just can't sit still when this is on.  He is crazy about the ""Sydney Barcarolle"" which they do a Christmas version of on their ""Santa's Rockin"" dvd.  He loves polka's and so ""Roll out the Barrel"" is another big favorite.  ""Agapame Tin Athena (we love Athens) has him copying the Wiggly dancers in some great Greek dancing.  My 3 year old is attempting to sing opera along with Sam Moran (he sings the Sydney Barcarolle song). It's so cute to hear a 3 year old warbling along with all these tunes (even if he is rather flat!), he just sings his wee heart out.

As a mom who is homeschooling I would recommend this dvd simply for it's music quality alone.  I can't help but love the Wiggles myself, their music is always top-notch, very catchy tunes.  They never fail to get your child on his feet.

This dvd is not like some of their other ones, it's not really doing comedy sketches.  It is definitely more musical than funny.  My son doesn't seem to mind that in the slightest though.  We also purchased the cd so that we can play it in the car for him...and it's just as well he's got a good sturdy car seat as the legs and arms are flying in every direction to the music :-)

2211677,1,B0007GP73C,"I have 3 kids ages ranging from 2 to 6 and they all love The Wiggles so we have been looking forward to an all new around the world adventure starring the family friendly fab four. Unfortunately this DVD fails to shine from the get go. The Wiggles are only seen sparingly to intro a bunch of tediously long sketches featuring Captain Feathersword and his crew. Then the only other time we see them it's as some cool looking flash animation or preforming in a cheesy looking undersea studio for some of the tunes. Other than that this project seems to be hanging everthing on the premise that the captain and his huge new crew of humorless stiffs are way more entertaining and funny than The Wiggles. It's a bad idea that painfully sinks slowly right in front of our eyes.

 First of all the captain's traditional pirate ship is replaced with a very small modern yatch and has a few garishly ugly lime green and brown pirate props attached to it. It doesn't act as a good fascade for a pirate schooner; in fact, it looks completely out of place and ridiculous. To make matters worse the ship spends most of it's time anchored in dock or in Sidney bay. I thought we were supposed to be sailing around the world in this video adventure? I'd rather they had used some high schoolish props with enough ample space for all the actors and a well written scripting of events than to try to impress us with something more realistic, but makes absolutely no sense.

 Then to make matters worse they crowd 6 or 7 really bad actors onto the tiny deck to play the captains supposedly wacky subserviant buccaneers. The sketches just aren't funny even to kids as there are no real jokes present and rely way to much on these meatballs trying to make silly contorted faces overeacting to everything or attempting some really bad ablibbing. My boys really love the captain, but this video has proven to me that a little Captain Feathersword goes a real long, long way. Given too much of the character in a clumsy unstructured presentation and you'll want to make the annoying  pirate walk the plank. At some places on the DVD kids and adults alike will be begging for his pointless rambling to end and for the singing to commence.

Then there's the issues with the music. Now I'm an adult who finds a lot of The Wiggles music to be highly addictive but this project was a huge step backward for the largest part. Some of the best songs on the program were from previous shows. There's quite a few songs from different locations around the world, but most of them are uninspiring. Most of the new tunes just fall flat and The Wiggles as musicans it seems are now starting to to fall into a rut to which many of their songs are sounding similar to older tunes without the charms or catchiness of the older gems. The only two new songs that were worth their sea faring salt were Hiccuping Chicken and The Captain's Wavy Walk. The rest of the new dittys were well below The Wiggles past watermark of excellence.

 I'd hate to see their next new project (The Big Red Car) stall and sink like ""Sailing Around The World"" has. I hope the group and their creative crew rights this ship soon because if not I can see the whole Wiggles franchise sleeping with the fishes in Wigglebay in the near future.",1121904000,15,3275,4.483221476510067
2211678,1,B0007GP73C,"We were very excited that a new video was coming out, since we have watch our other Wiggles dvds until they are about worn out.  My 2-year-old son loves the Wiggles. In fact, we are even going the their concert in August.  This dvd was a total disappointment.  We usually love to sing and dance to the songs.  This dvd, however, did not have songs that children would enjoy.  Most of them were completely over his head and hard to understand, even with subtitles on.",1121904000,6,466,4.435294117647059
2211679,3,B0007GP73C,"This DVD was disappointing because from the title and the ""on Location"" written on the DVD case I expected the Wiggles to actually be in other countries, doing performances specific to the location where they are.  Instead, the Wiggles only sing in the studio and Captain Feathersword and his crew perform almost exclusively on a modern yacht (not a very good pirate ship) in Sydney Harbour.

There are, for one location, what look like brief snapshots of the Wiggles posed in front of a backdrop of a monument.  Captain Feathersword briefly walks through London and San Francisco...not doing any special performing in either location.  Two of the Wiggly Dancers are very briefly shown in Mexico City.  That's it for being in foreign locales.

Several of the songs don't have anything to do with any country.  There's one about goldfish, one about mopping (dancing with mops), one about Driving In The Big Red Car, one about the Captain's Wavy Walk, one about exercising Elbow To Elbow, and one about a chicken with hiccups.  There's a song about sailing around the world on the Good Ship Feathersword (no specific countries mentioned).  More of this video seems to be Captain Feathersword than the Wiggles.  They do have some songs with themes about various places such as London Town, San Francisco, Mexico City, Athens, Sicily, and Syndney - though the Wiggles don't perform in any of these places.

Our 24 mo daughter is a little Wiggle-holic (we have most of the Wiggles' videos and our daughter carries her little Dorothy, Wags, and Henry beanies everywhere) and does enjoy this video.  It's playful and upbeat with lively singing, music and dancing (though there aren't kids on this video for her to dance along with).  Many of the songs don't lend themselves to moving along with as well as those on some of their other videos which have songs like ""Rock A Bye Your Bear.""  She just asked for the video to be changed to ""Wiggly Wiggly World"" instead (I had put on ""Sailing Around the World"" while writing this in order to note specifics).

I had been hoping for and expecting something more similar to their wonderful ""Wiggly Safari"" where they actually are in the environment they're singing about and interacting with it.",1121558400,4,2231,4.865079365079365
2211680,1,B0007GP73C,The wiggles hardly played a role in this dvd.  Captain Feather Sword and his crew were the main characters in this dvd.  My kids didn't even pay attention to this dvd.  I was very disappointed with this purchase.,1199664000,,212,4.526315789473684
2211681,1,B0007GP73C,My kids are big fans of the Wiggles but they could not sit through this one.  The skits in between songs are dull are take up too much time.  Way too much of the annoying Captain Feathersword and not enough of the Wiggles.,1145836800,,222,4.1395348837209305
2211682,1,B0007GP73C,The Wiggles make cameo appearances in this video featuring Captain Feathersword who should probably remain a supporting castmember.

2211683,1,B0007GP73C,"My son is one of the biggest Wiggles fans in the universe and even he won't watch this video twice.

2211684,3,B0007GP73C,"I've had this one for many months

But delayed my review

`Cos I kept drifting off to sleep

Before the show was through

The Wiggles have abandoned ship

They must have writer's cramp

They've made the S.S. Feathersword

No bigger than a stamp

The Captain ""travels"" round the world

and makes us twitch and groan

The Wiggles pop in now and then

And call this one their own

They ""go"" to Sydney, London, Greece

And Sicily as well

This ocean faring fairy tale

Gives off a fishy smell

San Francisco's cable cars

Then on to Mexico

How they can look us in the eye

I guess we'll never know

The set is cheap, the props are too

The costumes a disaster

Wait `til you see the rainy gear

You'll roll around with laughter

Some of the songs are pretty good

I wouldn't call them great

And when they're stuck for filler stuff

They simply animate

Some older kids may like this one

The young ones will be bored

When I think of what they used to do

The Wiggles have me floored

2211685,1,B0007GP73C,"My son absolutely loves The Wiggles and this video he won't even watch for a couple of minutes.  Where is the fun from Murray, Greg, Anthony and Jeff??",1137801600,5,151,4.392857142857143
2211686,3,B0007GP73C,My mom got my daughter and step son this for Christmas and I specifically wanted this one because this is the concert we went to see right before Halloween.  I was kinda disappointed because it was NOTHING like the skits they did at the concert and this one is all about Capt. Feathersword and his ship mates.  The Wiggles are barely in this one.  The Wiggles have far better videos out than this one that's for sure.  You can get the Top of the Tots DVD and have a good selection of songs from this DVD on that one.,1135900800,4,516,4.181818181818182
2211687,1,B0007GP73C,"Our daughter is a huge Wiggles fan, and a huge fan of the Sailing Around the World CD, so imagine our dismay when we watched this DVD and realized that most of the songs on the CD are not on the DVD.  Most of the DVD is ""acting"" by Captain Feathersword and his crew, and, lets face it, they were not meant to be lead characters!  The acting is bad and the dialogue between songs too long and too boring.  It will not hold the attention of a young child (our daughter is 22 months) or the parents who will be forced to watch it with them.  I had been warned against this DVD but hoped for the best when I bought it.  Don't waste your money like we did... get ""Wiggly, Wiggly World"" instead.",1135468800,8,689,4.074074074074074
2211688,2,B0007GP73C,"As you've read in other reviews, this DVD features primarily Captain Feathersword frolicking with the crew of the SS Feathersword.  The Wiggles are sporadically featured during the songs as if they are the Captain's backing band!  There are some great songs, particularly ""Elbow to Elbow"" and ""Do the Captain's Wavy Walk,"" but most of the runtime is spent on rather boring ""comedy"" sketches with Captain and Co.  My 4-year old has enjoyed the Wiggles since age 2, and he also seemed unenthused/nonplussed by this venture (though he did get up and dance to the ""Mop Mop"" song, much to my surprise).

The only way I can justify the existence of this DVD in my mind, is to think that this must be some overlong promotional video for an upcoming or perhaps existing TV series about the Captain and his crew.  There are some cute animated videos for favorites ""Driving in the Big Red Car"" (from ""Wiggly Wiggly World"") and ""Fly Through the Sky (from ""Top of the Tots"").  The resemblance of animated Greg to real Greg is truly uncanny!

Even the bonus feature ""Postcard to Mexico"" is Wiggle-free, as it features Fernando, Fernandito (with moustache) and Julio showing us around Mexico.  Really makes me feel like the Wiggles are checking out and planning their retirement!  I would definitely get the CD, but the DVD is not so hot.",1135036800,5,1324,4.771929824561403
2211689,2,B0007GP73C,"Whoever wrote, directed, and especially edited this DVD really forgot the roots of The Wiggles - in early childhood education. Each song is introduced by The Wiggles, but before the song begins, there is a long scene of Captain Feathersword and his crew. For younger viewers, it's just asking too much of their attention span, and for parents watching with them, the break in the pacing makes it frustrating to watch. It seems like they're really pushing pretty hard to make Captain Feathersword the star of this DVD. The Wiggles also seem to have less of a presence than usual - several songs are accompanied by poorly-animated caricatures of the Wiggles rather than live action, and there is much less dancing than in other Wiggles DVDs. Overall, this DVD just seems to have been made in too much of a hurry, and it does not do justice to the excellent music from the Sailing Around the World CD.",1133740800,2,898,4.689873417721519
2211690,2,B0007GP73C,"To start, the following list of Wiggles productions (minus live videos and material compiled from Wiggles TV shows) in approximate chronological order represents A Brief History of Wiggle Time:

Dance Party
Wake Up, Jeff!
The Wiggles Magical Adventure (movie)
Wiggly, Wiggly Christmas
Wiggle Time
Yummy Yummy
Toot! Toot!
Wiggly, Wiggly World
Hoop Dee Doo! It's a Wiggly Party
Yule Be Wiggling
Wiggly Safari
Wiggle Bay
Woo Hoo! Wiggly Gremlins! (much material from TV show)
Space Dancing
Top of the Tots
Cold Spaghetti Western
Santa's Rockin'
Sailing Around the World

Here are some comments from both the adult and juvenile points of view. It's appropriate to include adult perceptions for two reasons: 1) adults watch the videos with their children; and 2) over the years the productions have incorporated increasingly mature elements such as adult dancers, more sophisticated music, and sketches based on humor that, while low or vaudeville, is over the typical toddler's head.

Although there are a few bright spots in later videos like Top of the Tots and Santa's Rockin', except for Wiggle Bay the productions have declined in entertainment value. The early videos built to a peak achieved in Wiggly, Wiggly World. In that video the songwriting, choreography, and even the friendly, mellow sketches with various guest stars are all first-rate. It's superior family entertainment. After that, Wiggle Bay is the only first-rate video, largely because the songs are so well written.

In Sailing Around the World the best songs--like Let's Go (We're Riding in the Big Red Car), taken from Wiggly, Wiggly World or even the recycled Barcarolle from Santa's Rockin'--come from earlier videos. New songs Sicily and San Francisco Trolley Car feature dreadfully boring repetition (""Si-ci-ly...Si-ci-ly...Si-ci-ly...Si-ci-ly..."" or ""San Francisco trolley car ...San Francisco trolley car ...San Francisco trolley car ...San Francisco trolley car ..."") that recalls Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA, which is surely the least interesting musical composition in human history. Also, the copious amount of non-Wiggles dialogue really weighs on the sense of Wiggly fun in this video.

But one of the most curious elements of Sailing Around the World is that it drastically ends the trend, established in several previous videos, of highlighting Wiggly Dancer Larissa Wright in close-ups. That's not necessarily a flaw, even if children and more than a few fathers have taken notice of Ms. Wright's blonde beauty. After all, she's very appealing and clearly a talented dancer. The camera loves her, so why not highlight her? But in this video it's as if she's deliberately stuck in the very back of the crowd, and there's not one close-up of her. It's almost like she was intentionally demoted for some reason. The point here is not to insinuate dark motives or sling innuendo, because there are many possibilities as to why the producers might decide to stop showcasing a supporting player, including the performer's own wish to downplay her role. The point is, it's a blatant change that can pull the regular viewer--and as the father of two toddlers, I'm definitely so--right out of the entertainment groove. In no other Wiggles video would such a thought even cross my mind.

Which wouldn't be an issue if not for the reaction from my children (ages 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 at this writing). Normally they dance and sing to Wiggles videos. They show a marked preference for the older ones (up to Wiggly, Wiggly World), but the more recent videos still hold their attention. Not so with Sailing Around the World. My younger daughter turned away from it (luckily we only borrowed this one from the library), and my older daughter's comments were, ""I want The Wiggles,"" ""I don't like those pirates,"" and, worst of all, ""Where is the lady with yellow hair like me?"" So if a toddler can spot the differences, it's fair to say that the producers miscalculated here. Meanwhile, we can hope for a future Wiggles production that captures all the breezy sense of fun that infused the earlier videos.

Two stars because it's still The Wiggles, and The Wiggles will likely never put out anything that's all bad.",1133481600,3,4187,5.112573099415204

He likes that there's more dialogue between the songs, as well as some sort of plot. And he has always loved the Captain, so his prominence in this DVD doesn't bother us one bit. And some of the songs are quite catchy, particularly ""Here Comes the Chicken."" So if your little one isn't interested in anything but the music and the dancing, this one might not be for you. But if you have a preschooler who is starting to enjoy a plot along with the musical entertainment, then I'd recommend this one.",1128729600,2,650,4.25

I could not agree more.  Where are the Wiggles?  We do not see them much on this DVD.  ""Wake up Crew!!"" to parody ""Wake up Jeff!!""--now that was pretty cheesy.

With their new shows that started this week on Playhouse Disney it looks as if the Wiggles are taking a reduced role in their show as well; especially with the ""Little Wiggles"" segments and the spliced in performance clips from the various DVDs.

Our two year old certainly loves it, and we find it a refreshing change from a certain purple make-believe dinosaur and five plump psychedelic aliens.

Our 2 yr old normally jumps, dances and sings along with many of the other Wiggles DVDs, including Hot Potatoes, and Wiggly Wiggly World. Unfortunately, this DVD is so full of unfamiliar characters and long stretches of dialogue, my 2 yr old quickly loses interest.

This DVD shifts the focus from the Wiggles and moves to Captain Feathersword and his stalwart band of pirates/dancers/singers/actors...etc.  The wiggles are moved into back-up singers position.  Their instrument playing is so obviously pantomimed that it's as if they weren't even trying.

Because of the focus on Captain Feathersword and his crew, we are left with a series of awkward sketches by characters that the kids aren't familiar with.  This is interspersed by handful of songs -- only some of which are entertaining.  The best part of the video are the animated song -- it is a bit disappointing when you cringe through the live performances just to get to one of the animated songs!

However, this DVD hardly includes them. Captain Feathersword is the main character, BY FAR. He and his dancers are featured predominantly on the previously described ship in Sydney Harbor. I agree that there are far too many dancers, and they actually SPEAK in this video. Who cares about the dancers? And their acting is pretty bad. They should stick with their mediocore dancing.

The Wiggles phoned this one in. They obviously showed up at the studio for a one day shoot, to sing some of their songs, in the studio, NOT on location. For more than a few songs, they didn't even bother to appear to perform them, CARTOON versions of the Wiggles sing. I love the Wiggles because they are a live action act, my son can watch lame cartoons anytime!

I am honestly so disgusted at myself for purchasing this (and ignoring the other reviews here), that I am considering sending it back to Hit Entertainment and telling them to just keep this awful DVD.

Listen to these reviews, and go buy a Wiggles DVD in which they actually sing AND perform!!",1122422400,8,1191,4.55607476635514
2211709,1,B0007GP73C,"They're almost nowhere to be found on this DVD, except for a few odd snippets here and there. Captain Feathersword, usually a witty favorite, seems to be struggling to carry this entire show on his shoulders, as he and the Wiggly Dancers are the main focus of this video. One of the worst things on this video is that Captain Feathersword's crew fall asleep, and are then woken up with 1...2...3...WAKE UP CREW! Hmm...where's Jeff? The songs are not the catchy tunes that we are accustomed to, and one of them isn't even sung by Greg. The whole thing seems to have been thrown together without the Wiggles even knowing about it. Maybe that's why Captain Feathersword looks so jittery! The extras are just as bad. The Wiggly Postcard from Mexico only shows two of the Wiggly Dancers being shown around Mexico city by Fernando, Fernandito and Juan. We are going to see The Wiggles Sailing Around The World Tour in August, but after this we are worried that the Wiggles won't be there at all! Overall, I'd say don't waste your money on this DVD. And it really pains me to say that, being the rabid Wiggles fan that I am.",1122163200,12,1117,4.534653465346534

On our long trip, she watched the particular DVD four or five times in a roll without any fussing in the car.  Thank you so much Wiggles for making our lives so much easier as parents during our trip!",1364860800,,336,4.0606060606060606

He LOVES the wiggles, but he turned away and left the room when this DVD was on. He has NEVER turned away from the Wiggles before.

8047336,1,B0007GP73C,"Our children love the Wiggles.  They love to dance to their songs, and, though we find the Wiggles simplistic and staid, some of their albums and videos are, we must admit, catchy.  This video, though, is definitely one in which the Wiggles are past their prime.  In fact, there are more animated shorts of the Wiggles than there are shots of the Wiggles themselves.  You get to see a postcard or two of the not-so-fab Four every so often in the movie.  I can hear them now: hey, let's take an all-expenses paid tour around the world and get the parents to pay for it.  Heck, we won't even have to play anything.  No kidding.  Borrow it from the library.  Do not make the same mistake we did.",1231891200,,692,4.34375
