2107645,5,B0002NY8R6,"Finally! Taxi is being released on dvd. If you do not already know, Taxi is one of the best shows ever. It has wonderful writing and a superb cast. Judd Hirsch and Marilu Henner have great chemistry together. Add in the comedic talents of Andy (I like to wrestle large women) Kaufman and Tony (I like to play characters named Tony) Danza and it is tv series gold. Last but certainly not least is the talented Danny Devito as the incredible Louie Depalma; one of the most memorable and funniest characters in tv history. It only gets better with season 2 when Christopher Lloyd joins the regular cast as the hilarious Jim Ignatowski. If you don't laugh while watching season one of taxi, I will give you money because you need to buy yourself a sense of humor.",1090972800,13,759,4.507246376811594
2107678,4,B0002NY8R6,"""Taxi"" was one of the best comedies on television with one of the best cast ensembles to ever grace television. Danny DeVito played slimy Louie DePalma, the taxi dispatcher, perfectly and odds with his taxi drivers. Judd Hirsch played Alex Riger perfectly as well. Tony Danza played an aspiring boxer while Jeff Conway played an aspiring actor. The late great Andy Kaufman was unforgettable as Latka Gravas. Of course, Marilu Henner fit perfectly into the masculine world of taxi driving as a divorced mother of two and an aspiring artist.

Everybody at the Sunshine Cab Company in New York City had dreams other than riding a taxi cab in the city. The three DVDs have the entire first season with an excellent list of guest stars like Mandy Patinkin, Tom Selleck, Martin Mull, Talia Balsam, Ruth Gordon, William Bogert, Susan Kellerman as Latka's mother, Allan Arbus, Dolph Sweet, Christopher Lloyd as Rev. Jim, Gail Edwards, and more in the cast.

Too bad, the DVD first season doesn't come with any extras like behind the scenes and the making of a hit series. The theme music for the series is one of my favorites.",1483315200,,1118,4.787564766839378

Never liked Tony Dansa, nor his tatoo(hate tatoos). Has irritating voice. All the rest actors /actress just funny, and the serie is a novelty still because  the interaction OF ALL players sometimes together in scenes. and when they are on the road, you see the road.
The good lovely 70's cars who are so beautiful(unlike now) the atmosphere of New York city, it all is part of the show so here's also a flashback to the real life of late 1970's, I feel.

I once drove a checker cab before their extinction in the 80s, so this comedy is part funny and part serious. DeVito is great as always. This is a must for DeVito fans. One problem; they don't seem to have a busy dispatch office like most cab offices so the drivers spend too much time at the station and not enough time driving.

Danny Devito is great as the insanely cranky dispatcher/boss of the crew but everyone on the show is somewhat crazy. Except for maybe Judd Hirsch who plays the ""straight"" character but gets tons of laughs with the way he deals with everyone. All the characters are immensely likeable in one way or another which is a key factor in making the show great. Who can forget characters such as Andy Kaufman, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza, Marilu Henner and Jeff Conway, all of whom played one of the best characters in their careers if not THE best.",1359936000,,636,4.539130434782609

I couldn't wait to watch the two episodes per night starting at 10 pm, a good way to end the night.

So it was with a comforting pleasure when I finally purchased season 1 of Taxi and popped the DVD into the player and witnessed the fun all over again.

2107792,4,B0002NY8R6,"... Randell Carver almost makes the first season of this otherwise excellent show unwatchable.  The best choice the writers ever made was dumping him to the curb for Christopher Lloyd for the rest of the series.  You'll notice his face isn't even on the box art.  There's good reason for that.  Nonetheless, if you can blot him out (like CBS did when they put this together) the episodes of the first season were pretty darn good.

  There are however some minor audio issues with this first set.  Mostly random muffling likely having to do with the old original audio tracks fading away.",1328140800,,588,4.696078431372549

2107808,5,B0002NY8R6,"What made this series excellent (in addition to the writing) was the cast of actors and the characters they played, Louie, Alex, Latka, Jim, Banta, Nardo, et al.  ""Taxi"" was, in short, among the best sitcoms ever on TV.  Happily it can all be seen again on DVD.

All the episodes in this first season are good, but the funniest to me was Class Reunion, when Wheeler goes as Louie.  The finale was a real surprise and very funny.

I was never much of a fan of the family sitcoms, except ""All in the Family.""  The really good ones were Barney Miller, Cheers, and, of course, ""Taxi.""  If you've never seen the latter, get this now.  Or if you saw them all, you don't need this recommendation.",1237334400,,689,4.3700787401574805

It seems Paramount has a problem with getting people to buy a lot of the seasons, then stop releasing the remaining 2 or 3 seasons.  They did the same thing with Cheers.. they released the first 8 seasons then decided not to release 9 through 11.  I guess lovers of that show complained en masse so they've released season 9 and 10 is about to be shipped next month. All three of these shows have some of the same producers, writers, and directors. Taxi fans need to get on Paramount's back to get them to release the last two seasons.  I hope they don't stop releasing Wings after the 7th comes out next month.",1219190400,,665,4.338709677419355
2107810,5,B0002NY8R6,"I got this first season's worth of ""Taxi"" for Christmas last year from my sister Michel in Maryland-- I remember talking about it a lot and asking for it as a Christmas present. I had gotten introduced to the same through renting each of the three component discs from Netflix. I watched each one of the twenty-two component episodes, and, at least in my opinion, none of them failed to impress-- all were equally stellar. That is why I remember saying to myself, 'this one's a keeper.' It made me laugh harder than ""Friends,"" harder than ""Seinfeld,"" harder than ""Raymond."" The truth is, I had seen at least one episode's worth of each of those '90's comedies, and none of them--none of them!--could stand up to the sheer enjoyment that I got out of this first ABC season's worth (1978-79) of a late-'70's comedy called ""Taxi.""

This first season's worth consists of three discs, each in its own slipcase, and these slipcases fit into a larger case which, on the front, has the ""Paramount Television"" banner atop, then the ""Taxi"" title and ""The Complete First Season"" notation, and then, between two strips of checkerboard, a group picture of most of the major players. On the back side, there is another group picture of the major players, with a ""Special Features"" box listing normal DVD specs (why this is like that, I do not know, as none of the ""Taxi"" releases have had any real special features), and below that, a description of the season and the players, with some screenshots below.

Each slipcase has the ""Taxi"" title and disc number on the front, and a screenshot from the season, and on the bottom front of each case are images of two of the major players. The inside of each case lists the component episodes, and the back of each case gives episode listings with descriptions and airdates, with another screenshot below. There are 8 outings on each of the first two discs, and 6 on the last, for a total of 22. The discs have the ""Taxi"" title and disc number above a strip of checkerboard, with ""The Complete First Season"" notation and some technical information on the bottom. When the discs are removed, there is another image of some of the players under each disc.

When I rented the first season's worth, and the first disc arrived, I loaded it, and after the Paramount DVD logo, I expected to see the commercials that, as I believe it had been said before, were on these releases. Refreshingly enough, there were no commercials on this first release-- it went right ahead to the anti-copy warning and the disc menu. I was glad of that, because I didn't want to have to go through commercials for other series. Unfortunately, this is not true, I believe, for either of the other ""Taxi"" releases (although I must admit, I haven't seen any of #3).

This first season's worth didn't have any bonuses (matter-of-factly, none of the three currently released seasons did), but I'm not complaining-- I'm just glad to have the first season's worth of a series that, in my opinion, was much, much, much better than any of the comedies of the '90's and today.",1208044800,,3069,4.656826568265683

The first season didn't include a bad episode, and did include some classic shows.  My personal favorite was the episode where Elaine had to leave town, and left her son with the cabbies.  They took turns taking care of him, and then showed up to cheer him on at his spelling bee.  Louie was in top form, calling the other kids ""losers"" and trying to bet on the outcome of the spelling bee.

2107828,5,B0002NY8R6,"It is my constant misfortune to begin following a television show toward the conclusion of its network run.  TAXI was one of those great series that I belatedly watched during its fifth season only  a few weeks before it was announced that the show was canceled.  Fortunately the series went into immediate syndication and I was able to recapture all of the episodes on local television channels.

Judd Hirsch leads the cast as cab driver Alex Reiger.  Reiger is the only employee at Sunshine Cab whose full time profession is as a cab driver.  He is also a father figure to the other cabbies.  Danny DeVito is Louie DePalma, a modern day Italian-American Ebenezer Scrooge.  DePalma's penny pinching and inflamatory remarks are the driving forces behind most of the stories.  The other stand out is Andy Kaufman as Latka.  The part was specially created for Kaufman and his ""Foreign Man"" routine.  Kaufman reportedly scoffed at the idea of appearing in a weekly situation comedy, but was convinced by his ever-wise agent that it made good professional, as well as financial, sense to do so.  Years later Kaufman tired of Latka and insisted on the opportunity to play his role differently.  By the fifth season his character was nothing more than a nostalgic backdrop.  However, in season one his presence is fresh and entertaining.

TAXI is one of the few television series where you could virtually mix and match most of the episodes and not feel that you lost continuity.  The very first episode, ""Like Father, Like Daughter,"" is a volume you might actually expect to see further in the series.  Indeed, with the exception of a few introductory moments at the beginning of this episode when Elaine joins Sunshine Cab for the first time, this show could well have appeared in later seasons.

The solitary shortcoming of the first season is, with the exception of one appearance as Reverand Jim, Christopher Lloyd is missing.  At the end of the first season Randall Carver, who played John Burns, was dropped in favor of Lloyd's more excentric alterego Jim Ignatowski.  Carver did a credible job as John, but his character always played second fiddle to Alex, Bobby, Elaine, Tony, and Latka.  In viewing the first season on DVD there are coincidental hints that John's days at Sunshine Cab were numbered.  Though it is doubtful that the writers had John's departure in mind, in TAXI episodes John precariously balances full time school, his marriage, and is constantly berated by Louie for his poor bookings.

TAXI premiered on ABC in September 1978.  At this time half-hour television sitcoms averaged 22 episodes per season and TAXI has exactly that number.  Compare that to television series of the mid 1960s where 32 to 34 shows per season were the norm.  My only regret here is that I exhausted my 22-episode DVD set all too quickly.

There are no special features in the season one set.  The picture is very high quality and gives me the feeling that I am watching every episode for the very first time.  Next up: Season Two.",1171152000,3,3031,4.831067961165049

2107830,3,B0002NY8R6,"Andy Kaufman is gone now but several of these actors got started and are still visible in all kinds of roles; not just acting. They are writing books, hosting talk shows and still adding character to movies and tv.

The first season of Taxi is probably not my favorite. I especially liked the later seasons when Latka started having different personalities, one of which was Vick Ferrari, which I borrowed for my own Amazon pseudonym. Another was his beautiful imitation of Alex.

For me the negatives are that some of the lines seem a little corny to me now and some episodes are less funny than others in favor of a human interest or emotional storyline. I really prefer the humor in a sitcom. But, when Taxi is funny it's incredible.",1142726400,2,736,4.6106870229007635

2107834,5,B0002NY8R6,"Critics of the situation comedy generally agree there've been five truly great sitcoms: I Love Lucy, The Dick Van Dyke Show, All In the Family, M.A.S.H and Seinfeld. Two of those shows were still in first-run during the late 1970s/early '80s. It was a common thing then for people to ask me, ""Which do you like best, All In the Family or M.A.S.H.?"" My answer was always the same: ""I prefer Taxi."" Though Taxi lacked the social satire of All In the Family or the grandiose, larger-than-life quality of the best episodes of M.A.S.H., what it had, more than any other sitcom I've ever seen, was a cast of believable, sympathetic, real world characters dealing with real world problems.

Alex Reiger (Judd Hirsh) is the heart and soul of the Sunshine Cab Co. While every other driver considers being a cabbie merely a sidelight to their ""real"" job, Alex is the only person willing to say, ""I'm a cab driver."" Alex's compassion and common sense makes him the guy everyone comes to when they have a problem.

Louie De Palma (Danny DeVito) is Sunshine's irascible dispatcher. Snide, abusive, cheap, avaricious, dishonest, lecherous, DeVito's portrayal of this walking emotional toxic waste dump won him numerous Emmies and paved the way for a very successful career as a motion picture actor, director and producer.

Bobby Wheeler (Jeff Conaway) is an aspiring actor with the attention span of a fruit fly.

Tony Banta (Tony Danza) is the world's worst middleweight boxer, and even dumber than Bobby.

John Burns (Randall Carver) - and I hate to say this in case Carver's reading it, I don't want to hurt his feelings - was the weak link in Taxi's first season. John was just boring, he combined the low IQ of Bobby and Tony with none of their charm. After Season 1, the character disappeared.

Elaine Nardo (Marilu Henner) is a hard working divorcee who moonlights at Sunshine to support two kids while pursuing her ""real job"" at an art galley. I had SUCH a crush on Marilu Henner when I was a teenager. Auburn hair, great face and figure, and, to all appearances, a really nice person to boot. What more could you want?

Latka Gravas (Andy Kaufman) is Sunshine's mechanic, an immigrant from an unnamed Balkan country whose native language sounds like speaking in tongues. As a teenager I couldn't understand why so many people raved about the character of Latka. I didn't like him at all; he was the one jarring note in an otherwise believable real world cast. My girlfriend, while watching the first episode of Taxi on DVD with me (she'd never before seen the show), as soon as Latka appeared on-screen said, ""Obviously he's going to be the most popular character."" Me: ""Why do you say that?"" Her: ""Because all the other characters are so normal. And here you've got this total weirdo walking around in the middle of all that normalcy. He's something different and exotic."" Okay, so after 20-plus years, I understand.

In the very first episode, we see exactly what made Taxi so great: real human emotion. In ""Like Father, Like Daughter"" Alex meets the daughter he hasn't seen since his divorce 15 years before. They finally meet in an airport departure lounge five minutes before her plane leaves. Their conversation, shown in real time, encompasses that five minutes and contains enough pain, honesty and humor to fill any ten episodes of most other sitcoms. After that first episode - which I saw back on September 12, 1978 - I said to myself, ""If they can maintain that level of quality, this show has me as a fan forever.""

In the 8th episode, arguably the most memorable character in Taxi history makes his first appearance. In ""Paper Marriage"" the Reverend Jim (Christopher Lloyd) officiates at Latka's marriage of convenience to avoid deportation. During the service Reverend Jim, a total drug burnout, goes through a long, impassioned speech about the sanctity of marriage, then crows triumphantly, ""I bet you all thought I was gonna screw up, didn't ya!"" In that moment Lloyd won the hearts of Taxi fans everywhere, ensuring his return in Season 2 as a series regular.

In ""Sugar Mama"" Ruth Gordon, in an Emmy winning performance, is a rich and lonely widow who pays Alex, repeatedly, to drive her around town and talk to her. Eventually he begins to feel like a kept man.

In ""Mama Gravas"" Alex meets and winds up in bed with Latka's mother. The role of Greta Gravas required a woman very tall, somewhat rawboned, and sexy as hell. Whoever cast Susan Kellermann should have received a special Emmy.

The first season ends with a two-parter, ""Memories of Cab 804"" in which each cabbie reminisces about special moments experienced in a recently totaled cab. Of note, in Cab 804 Elaine met the man of her dreams who looked amazingly like a young Tom Selleck. Wait a minute....it WAS a young Tom Selleck! Alex delivered a baby in Cab 804 whose father looked amazingly like a young Mandy Patinkin. Wait a minute....okay, you get the idea.

Season 1 of Taxi proved just how much humanity could be shoehorned into a half hour sitcom. And they did it week after week; few indeed were the missteps. It's great to have these episodes on DVD. There are no ""extras,"" not even captioning. But who cares? What's important is the show itself, one of the best sitcoms ever. Period.",1120176000,20,5272,4.75492341356674

And ""TAXI"" appears in a big graphic at the end of the tag scene right before the closing credits in that pilot and that's never been shown in reruns either.  The other episodes are awsome too, and look like they must have been fully restored, but this has got to be the best pilot show for any comedy series ever.  It's too bad there are no extras or commentaries by Tony Danza, Danny Devito or Judd Hirsh but I love these dvd's anyway.

2107836,5,B0002NY8R6,"With its acerbic humor and quirky characters, Taxi is widely considered one of the funniest sitcoms in television history. Created by James L. Brooks (whose magic hand played a role in such hits as The Andy Griffith Show, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and The Simpsons), Taxi maintains a loyal following to this day via syndicated reruns. Sporting an all-star cast, the show introduced the world to the comedic talents of such superstars as Danny DeVito, Tony Danza, Marilu Henner, Andy Kaufman, and Christopher Lloyd...

Taxi follows the inner-workings of the Sunshine Cab Company, a New York City taxicab operation run by an insulting and tyrannical dispatcher named Louie De Palma (Danny DeVito). De Palma's onerous tactics are dispensed from the safety of his small office ""cage"" in the corner of the body shop, while various cab drivers such as Alex Reiger (Judd Hirsch), Tony Banta (Danza), and Elaine Nardo (Henner) associate with one another. Throw in foreign mechanic Latka Gravas (Kaufman), and all the ingredients are in place for endless hours of laughter. As the characters perform their numerous runs, meet back at the shop, and deal with varying problems in their personal lives, audiences are treated to some of the best comedy ever to grace the small screen...

The Taxi (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere ""Like Father, Like Daughter"" in which Elaine Nardo begins a part time job with the cab company where she meets the various characters who work for the outfit. When everyone discovers that the broken pay phone will allow them to call long distance for free, Alex uses the opportunity to call his ex-wife in Brazil (hoping to speak to his estranged daughter). But instead, Alex learns that his daughter is in Miami on layover while en route to Portugal. He commandeers a cab and drives down to see her... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Memories of Cab 804"" in which the various cabbies reminisce about their good and bad experiences in a recently damaged taxicab, and ""Friends"" in which Tony unwisely places the fate of his pet goldfish in the hands of his bestfriend Bobby...

2107837,5,B0002NY8R6,"I love Taxi.  I started watching it on reruns in the mid '90s.  I watched a ton of them, and I could have sworn that I saw all of them.  However, to my surprise, I think I've only seen about 75% of the episodes.  I bet you'll find that, too, if you've been a long term fan, that there are a lot of shows that you haven't seen.

I love the first episode where Danny De Vito steps out of his office for the first time, and you see how short he is.  Of course that's no surprise now, since Danny De Vito is a household word, but I thought it was very interesting how dramatic they were about his height in the first episode.

Jim Ignatowski is on the first season for just one episode as a guest star.  He starts appearing as a regular in Season 2.

In it's original run the show never had high audience ratings nor much respect from the two different TV networks it ran on. Today it's considered a TV comedy classic. For anyone, who dosn't know, the show mainly takes place within the confounds of the garage of the 'Sunshine Cab Company'. It is here, that we hang out with the company cabbies & other employees, who are trying to earn a living, while they pursue their dreams. The company's diminutive & extremely nasty Dispatcher, Louie De Palma (Danny DeVito) would term these wannabes as a ""bunch of losers"". (Of course the company's foreign mechanic, Latka Gravis (Andy Kaufman) would respond ""What a Yacabey!"") The cabbies include would-be actor, Bobby Wheeler (Jeff Conway), not very bright, fighter Tony Banta (Tony Danza), divorced mom/hopeful art gallery employee, Elaine Nardo (Marilu Henner) and student/future forrest ranger, John Burns (Randall Carver). Alex Reiger (Judd Hirsh) is the only cabbie, who actually admits that he's a cabbie for a living. Alex is the everyman, that everyone else seems to go to for advice to solve their problems and a shoulder to cry on. All these characters have their faults, but they also have a lot of heart. Thats why we both empathize and laugh at the mistakes and situations, they get themselves into. There ar two components that made this show a classic. One, would be the excellent writing by TV writing veterens such as James L. Brooks, Glen Charles, Glenn Gordon Carron, Ed Weinberger Etc. The other reason is the amazing ensemble cast of actors, who just hilariously work together like a well oiled, comedy machine. It can't get much better than these guys! Now, the show is being put out by Paramount in the DVD format, season by season. Season 1 is a three disc set, that includes such classic episodes as ""Sugar Mama"" (Alex becomes septagenarium, Ruth Gordon's paid escort), ""High Scool Reunion"" (which includes Bobby's killer, Louie impersonation) and ""Paper Marriage (the first introduction of Rev. Jim Ignatowski). The DVD's picture & sound are O.K., but nothing fancy. Unfortunately Paramount gives us absolutely nothing in extras. It's a bare bones release at a luxuary price. It would have been nice to get a short documentry or some commentaries from the show's actors & creators. Though this is a fault, I would still recommend this release simply because the show is TV comedy at it's best! It will simply have you laughing your head off!

Once the local network stopped airing these, I was not only saddened, but angry. Just to show ya how great this show really is, after only watching it once, I was completely hooked, thanks to my favorite character, Jim Ignatowski. This show was on and off a few years before I was born, but I still consider it to be one of the greatest comedies ever. When I received this box set on Christmas day, I was overly excited. Not only am I a huge fan of ""Taxi,"" but my mother also feels the same way. Now we can watch the entire first season and laugh together. Even though Christopher Lloyd only appeared in one episode during season one, the show was still as funny as ever. I think that they really didn't need him for the first season because the episodes were just as funny without him, mainly because Latka and Louie really made the show a barrel full of laughs. ""Paper Marriage"" is probably my favorite out of all 22 episodes (thanks to Christopher Lloyd's first appearance as Reverend Jim and Andy Kaufman's zaniness as Latka), but you can't count out many other episodes, including ""High School Reunion,"" ""Men Are Such Beasts,"" ""Alex Tastes Death, and Finds a Nice Restaurant,"" ""One-Punch Banta,"" and ""A Full House for Christmas"", which was one of the first episodes I watched, seeing as how it was December 25th.

(let's hope they don't pull a Mary Tyler Moore and stop the DVD releases at season one....i need more) and yes...i've overused my parenthesis in this review....i'm sorry",1101254400,3,848,4.66
2107855,4,B0002NY8R6,Taxi was a catch show. I dug the Bob James theme Song.i still got a crush on Marilu Henner. this show had a good solid cast that truly Complimented one another. Danny Devito was always a trip. a really good show that  finally made it to DVD.,1100304000,,241,4.127659574468085
2107856,5,B0002NY8R6,"I'm old enough to have watched most of these when they first came out.  It's great to see the whole thing again with crystal clear digital reproduction and ear-scorchin' mono remastered sound.

Was this the best American comedy ever?  I also liked CHEERS, which had a similar style, but I don't think it ever quite measured up to TAXI.  CHEERS never had Latka or Reverend Jim or Louie, for one thing.  Danny Devito has played ""Louie DePalma""-type characters in other films, but never once came near to his performance in TAXI (my opinion).  I wish they had more of Reverend Jim in this first season.

Someone once pointed out to me that the show GREEN ACRES always dealt with the theme of communication or the failure to communicate:  Eddie Albert never understood anybody else, everyone is able to understand Arnold the Pig, etc.

I was thinking about this concept of meta-theme when I watched these TAXI episodes.  I've noticed that, in this series, virtually every episode deals with frustration, failure, or loss.  The first episode demonstrates how Alex left his family years ago and has spent his life missing his daughter; the next one has Tony getting a real chance to make it as a boxer, and failing; a later one deals with Elaine's humiliation at being a cab driver among a circle of art-museum friends; then there's Latka's 10-minute marriage; Bobby despairs at ever becoming an actor; etc.  Remember the one where Alex's dog died?  The cabbies were perpetually trying to improve their lives, then failing, then dealing with the failure.  That gave the show a bittersweet edge, but the stories rarely came off as schmaltzy, and they were always hilarious.",1098403200,14,1666,4.861702127659575
2107857,5,B0002NY8R6,ITS ABOUT TIME Paramount released this on DVD!! The best sitcom ever!!..I just hope that Paramount releases the other seasons.,1098144000,5,126,5.35
2107858,5,B0002NY8R6,"Paramount has finally decided to release the first season of TAXI on DVD. I won't waste space here describing to you the show or it's premise but I will fill you in on what the DVD's are like.

This is definitely what you would call a ""bare bones"" box set... no extras, no bonus material, no language or audio selection. The three discs come in individual slip-cases covered with cool photo collages made up of both promotional photos and stills from the show itself.

But you wouldn't be buying this set for bonus materials... TAXI is the most heartfelt, hilarious, engaging, memorable, and sometimes strange sitcom ever to have aired. Every episode from the first season is here, looking as good as you've ever seen it. (Paramount has wisely added a ""Play All"" feature on the menu) The twenty-two episodes in this set are some of the best of the series' run, including the heartbreaking ""Blind Date,"" the hilarious two-part ""Memories of Cab 804,"" and the Emmy-winning ""Sugar Mama."" James L. Brooks (who would later go on to co-create The Simpsons) is at his best with this show, moving you from stomach-straining laughter to genuine tears with only one line. And of course the show serves as ""Cheers'"" older brother since James Burrows and Glen and Les Charles would eventually go on to create the other greatest show of all time.

Maybe the biggest bonus here is that the DVD restores all the scenes that were cut from the syndicated episodes, which makes all the difference. If you've only seen TAXI in reruns- as I had- you missed out on a lot.

Maybe there's nothing wrong with a bare-bones set... it makes you appreciate just what you're buying it for in the first place. There are two kinds of people in the world... those who love Taxi and those who have never seen it. This box set is worth every penny, and Paramount has even confirmed Season Two's release for sometime in the first half of 2005. Enjoy...",1097798400,38,1916,4.659763313609467
2107859,5,B0002NY8R6,"I am so glad that Paramount decided to release Taxi on DVD.  I'm sure there will be many complaints about the bare bones nature of the set - there are no extras whatsoever (unless someone discovers hidden easter eggs somewhere) and no options for audio or subtitle choices.  It is just the 22 episodes of the first season presented in the order they were originally aired on tv.  However, just to have this all in one place with a nice clean print sure beats all my old VHS tapes with washed out color and sound that are also full of commercials.  Taxi is my favorite show of all time because of the excellent writing and the way the relationships were developed between the characters.  These are people you can care about and relate to even if you'd never imagine yourself being a cabbie.  Plus it's funny!  While Danny DeVito as Louie De Palma could be very acerbic at times, there i none of the mean-spirited cruel humor that marks so many of the present-day sitcoms.  I just hope that enough copies sell to induce Paramount to release the other seasons.",1097625600,31,1058,4.531578947368421
2107860,5,B0002NY8R6,"The 1978-79 television season brought several new hit shows. The Dukes Of Hazzard,Mork & Mindy and this one. They killed CBS's All In The Family,I'm sorry to say. Here at the Sunshine Cab Company is Judd Hirsch as Alex Rieger one of the drivers. The other drivers are Tony Banta(Tony Danza),Elaine Nardo(Marilu Henner),Bobby Wheeler(Jeff Conaway) and Russian immigant Latkas Gratvas(the late Andy Kaufman). Their boss is Louie DiPalma(Danny DeVito) who's always cranky and grouchy. Previously Conaway filmed the Paramount musical GREASE with John Travolta. Conaway and Travolta,the film's star,were so-called T-Birds. Subsequently,Hirsch appeared in the films ORDINARY PEOPLE and TEACHERS. Also he co-starred with Bob Newhart on a short-lived sitcom,George & Leo. Kaufman appeared on the first Saturday Night Live show in 1975. He lip-synched ""Here I come to save the day!"" from the Mighty Mouse theme. Kaufman succumbed to lung cancer in 1984. DeVito and Henner went Hollywood while Taxi ran on ABC(the show was cancelled in '83 after its last and only season on NBC). DeVito remains one of Hollywood's biggest stars. Post-Taxi,Henner had her own morning talk show,Marilu,for a few years. Also she starred with Burt Reynolds on CBS's Evening Shade. Also Danza had a second hit sitcom,Who's The Boss,another ABC show.",1096934400,4,1317,5.429268292682927
