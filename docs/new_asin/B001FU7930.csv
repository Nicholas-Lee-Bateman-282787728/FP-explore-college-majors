3589305,2,B001FU7930,"Just finished watching ""Red Mist"", and frankly i got a bit bored after the 2nd killing.
After that it just gets predictable.
This is yet again another so-called ""horror"" movie that involves vengence on a group of friends that kill some random loser they all make fun of by accident and blablabla, we ALL know where this is going and it leaves nothing to the imagination of what could happen next.

This is not worth a second watching.

It had potential in the beginning but after that it went flat.

I would've loved if it had some back story on why the killer self-mutilated and why he was the way he was, but all it showed from that is his mother being a hooker and him witnessing abuse for like 2 minutes of the whole film and that's it.

I was really looking forward to liking this movie and adding it to my collection, but i'll just have to pass on this one.",1290643200,3,863,4.276073619631902

Unfortunately, they are witnessed by Kevin, the hospital morgue attendant, who videos their antics on his cellphone. Rather than have their future careers ruined, said students decide to get the guy wasted instead, so they can destroy the evidence. Of course, things go horribly awry, leaving poor Kev in a deep coma! After dumping him in the hospital parking lot, our heroes go back to their studies. Oh no! One of the students w/ a conscience tries to help Kevin by injecting him w/ an experimental drug. Now, Kevin has psychic abilities, enabling him to possess those around him, turning them into his personal assassins of vengeance! RED MIST is a well-made, dark thriller w/ just enough horror elements to keep it creepy.

3589308,3,B001FU7930,"Red Mist, also known as Freakdog (which is a more suitable and sensible title), is an interesting little indie horror flick. Arielle Kebbel (The Uninvited, John Tucker Must Die) stars as Catherine; a young doctor hopeful who, along with her group of fellow med students (including Sarah Carter) accidentally cause the creepy Kenneth (Andrew Lee Potts) to go into a coma. Catherine feels bad naturally, so she administers an experimental drug to Kenneth with the hopes that he'll survive, only to find that it makes him have outer body experiences in which he can posess anyone and wreck brutal vengeance on his wrong-doers. Surprisingly well-filmed and well-acted, Red Mist is a violent and compelling little thriller that you will be surprised with. What hurts the film however is that it isn't suspenseful or scary in the least, but then again, it doesn't fall to any sort of typical slasher conventions either, which it easily could have. It occasionally plods along as well, but for the most part, Red Mist is a worthwhile shocker that is definitely worth giving a chance. Plus, it has the gorgeous Arielle Kebbel running around in her underwear, and that alone makes anything worth seeing.",1262476800,4,1194,5.005025125628141
3589309,4,B001FU7930,It was pretty good and had some good acting in it. The story line was decent and there was enough blood and creepiness in it to make it worth buying.,1259539200,2,149,4.0
3589310,3,B001FU7930,"**WARNING**
This movie is not for epileptics.
You WILL have a seizure like The Simpsons did when they went to Japan.

What we have here is a very ""Shocker""-esque flick about ""out of body experiences"" from the guy who directed the cult hit ""Shrooms"".
A group of med students accidentally take a joke a little too far,
which lands the mentally-challenged, all too creepy, epileptic janitor at their college in a deep coma.
One of the students, feeling guilt for dumping him at the hospital,
injects him with an untested drug that revitalizes brain function, but causes out of body experiences.
But not just any OOBE,
this drug gives him the ability to possess others.
And of course he uses it to seek out revenge.
Hence the name Red Mist. (A feeling of rage that temporarily clouds one's judgement.)

There were plenty of deaths in this flick,
all of which, should have-could have been a lot gorier.
Don't get me wrong there was SOME blood.
but not nearly enough to match the viciousness of the deaths themselves.
The one death that should have delivered the most gore, (acid funnel) delivered the least, which seemed kind of like a cheap cop-out.
Aside from absent gore the movie also never seemed to mount any suspense.
Ok ok maybe the one scene, where the mother was standing at the head of the stairs holding the baby, was suspenseful
(subsequently this also happens to be the only scene in the whole film that pours on the red stuff)
but the rest of the movie was straight forward to the point of being predictable.
Anytime anyone was possessed their nose would bleed so there was no surprise.
If that small effect (nose bleed) were omitted the plot might have actually had the chance to pile on some tension.
Essentially; had the gore & suspense been present.. this flick would have been dynamite,
the acting was great,
the plot was interesting enough,
it had some nice production values,
like the camera work of a big budget flick.
It had all the makings of a great horror movie,
but just fell flat in the one department that should have made it.
If you're going to title your film ""Red Mist"" at least have the decency to show me some splatter.
3 stars = Worth a rental, but not a purchase

3589313,3,B001FU7930,"Checked this out as a rental and wasn't expecting much from seeing the trailer. Slow beginning and then started picking up speed and kept me entertained till the end. I think this had a lot of potential to be better. It was an interesting idea, done in an interesting way which set it apart from typical slasher horror movies, and typical villians.

It succeeded in the characters your supposed to like you do and the ones your supposed to hate, you really do hate. I was expecting it to suck and it didn't but wasn't quite good enough to get me to buy it. IF it had been unrated rather than an R and they had pushed that, gone that one step further into ""unrated territory"" upping the violence, gore, blood and other things you expect to find in an unrated horror movie could've or would've been enough to probably purchase the Dvd. it's certainly ""Creepy"", but misses in the making you jump or gasp areas.
It's still entertaining but just barely misses in the I want to buy this movie category.

Since they leave the ending open, perhaps we'll see the much needed ""unrated"" push in a sequel. I was glad it didn't have a really horrible, let you down, no pay off ending.",1234656000,5,1171,4.441860465116279

8302750,4,B001FU7930,"NOTE:  This review is based upon the Blu-ray edition and unfortunately not the DVD version

Looking to watch some other work by Sarah Carter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shark-Season-One/dp/B000TM1CL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shark - Season One</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Falling-Skies-Season-1-Blu-ray/dp/B004LROMX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Falling Skies: Season 1 [Blu-ray</a>]), I purchased ""Red Mist"" under the pretense that Sarah Carter was one of the stars.  I came to this false conclusion based upon the fact that both the cover of the Blu-ray edition (but not the DVD version as I learned tonight) and the Wikipedia entries for Sarah Carter and ""Freakdog,"" aka ""Red Mist,"" indicated such.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed when Sarah's character was as much a star of the film as John Wayne was a star of The Longest Day, How the West Was Won and The Greatest Story Ever Told: Name recognition!

That said, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw Andrew Lee Potts (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primeval-Volume-1-Series-1-and-2/dp/B001D2WUGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primeval: Volume 1 (Series 1 and 2)</a>, the Canadian spinoff  B00ECXJC28, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-TV-Miniseries/dp/B0031DDG9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice (TV Miniseries)</a>) as the real costar portraying Kenneth, the janitor, cruelly nicknamed ""Freakdog,"" that lead to the alternate release title.  While his lines were few, his actions were on the spot creepy.  As far as I am concerned Andrew makes this film a darn good drama; i.e., it is no slasher or horror film in my opinion.  In fact, as noted in another review (that I unfortunately waited until tonight to read) most of the ""good"" stuff appears off screen or very quickly, and lessened the impact of the film.

As the lead actor/star of the film, Arielle Kebbel gives a sound performance in the role of Katherine, the only intern doctor who remotely cares about or tolerates the attention given her from the lascivious janitor, Kenneth.  Stephen Dillane (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones-Season-1-Blu-ray/dp/B00IYJW7QY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones: Season 1 [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Adams-Blu-ray/dp/B001684L0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Adams [Blu-ray</a>]) was another surprise as Doctor Harris, a man of dubious morality when it comes to patients.  Alex Wyndham (Rome) must have played his character very well because I could not wait for him to get killed--I mean it had to happen, the film is that kind of movie after all!

Now as to why I am even more upset about purchasing the Ble-ray edition:  THERE ARE NO FEATURES AT ALL!!!  NO MENU, NO SOUND OR LANGUAGE OPTIONS, AND NO SPECIAL FEATURES!!!  Oh, and it both starts out play right away and starts replaying as soon as the credits finish.  I don't know about the sound/language options, but the DVD most assuredly has a menu since, according to the web page description anyways, has three bonus features: The Making of ""Red Mist,"" Extended Interview with Arielle Kebbel, and The ""Red Mist"" Cast in Northern Ireland.  Guess I will be buying a DVD to replace a Blu-ray instead of the other way around--a first for me!  I'll try to update this review after seeing the DVD version.",1407542400,2,3540,6.276859504132231
8302751,2,B001FU7930,"I'm going to be quite frankly honest. I only ordered this movie because of two factors: 1) the cast and 2) it's a horror movie. It started off okay, but quickly went downhill from there. It becomes extremely confusing and messy the farther you get into the movie. On top of that, the killer.. really?? It was a unique idea and I'll be the first to admit that, but seriously. It's not worth watching. If you're bored and you truly have nothing else to watch and this is free to view somewhere, then sure. Waste your time on it. Also, the DVD cover shown here technically spoils a death in the movie. Just thought I'd forewarn you all.",1385596800,,633,4.372881355932203

Pros:
-cool plot and the editing was done well

-decent acting
-a few good death scenes
-creepy (but not SCARY)
-held my attention, I was never bored
-quick pace, quick little movie

Cons:
-a few deaths are off screen, as in you don't even know they happened until the main character finds a dead body. If the death scenes were actually show, the movie would be scarier and longer.
-there is no twist, you'll figure out the ending very easily with some common sense.
