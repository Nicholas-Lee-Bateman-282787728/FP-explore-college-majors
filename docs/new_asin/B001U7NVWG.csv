3797316,5,B001U7NVWG,My 3year old loves fireman Sam and this video did not disappoint us.  I think we have them all and will get the new one coming out in July.,1309219200,,139,3.793103448275862
3797317,5,B001U7NVWG,"We bought it before we took a long trip. Our toddler loves it. However, it is not what you see on PBC Sprout channel. The characters look different. Some of them do not exist in the TV version. There are some new characters in this DVD. It took several minutes for our toddler to figure it what we were watching! After that we did not have any problem.

In this DVD twins James and Sarah do not have any parents. Elvis does not sing. There is no Radar dog.

In this DVD there is Dusty dog. There is Bella, an italian lady, who owns an italian cafe. Bella has a cat named Rosa.

I just wished that they kept characters look the same and didn't change them in all seasons.

If you have time then check other seasons on youtube and you will understand what I am talking about.",1302998400,4,773,4.167785234899329
3797318,1,B001U7NVWG,"My 4 YO LOVES Fireman Sam. Seriously loves this video above all others. If he were able to type he would give it a 5,000 star rating and tell everybody to go buy a copy immediately (this is the 3rd we now have after succumbing to his relentless pressure for MORE Fireman Sam).

However I give it 1 star for the following reasons:

1) As an adult who actually watches TV with my kids during TV time I can say with all honesty that this is the worst video ever and it causes me physical pain to have to sit through all 34 minutes of it. I think I have a Fireman Sam induced stomach ulcer now.

2) The characters in this video consistently and relentlessly make poor choices (all of which require the assistance of a fireman). While I understand that if the people in this town actually made reasonable choices than there wouldn't be much drama, I don't appreciate the behavior that is modeled. As an example - when a squirrel sets fire to a house the girl runs INTO the fire to rescue the squirrel while her PARENTS wait outside for the firemen to come rescue their daughter.

3) 2 of the 4 firemen are probably taking the short bus to school (Wendy and Sam are OK so if there is a fire in your village please request their help specifically). Again while not all firemen are top notch, having firemen model ridiculous behavior sends a confusing message. Are firemen well trained individuals who you can count on in a crisis? Or are they apt to attempt to throw a bucket of water onto an electrical fire?

Its too late for us. But please.....save yourselves. Give this one a pass.",1296432000,6,1578,4.3720136518771335
3797319,1,B001U7NVWG,i guess that is the risk you take when you buy something used but when people say that the product is in good working order you expect it to work.  The CD played for the first 15 minutes then kept freezing and skiping.,1295222400,,218,4.069767441860465

3797322,5,B001U7NVWG,"Our son started out watching the older Fireman Sam videos on cable when he was 2. Then recently, our cable provider switched to the newer version. He loves this video of older episodes, and I love that there are several together so I don't have to keep the remote near by to select another episode. Great stuff! We bought the other videos too.",1273968000,,343,4.4603174603174605
3797323,1,B001U7NVWG,"The content of these DVDs is great. My son loves Fireman Sam. That being said, HIT/Lionsgate has created these DVDs so that you have to sit through several minutes of previews to get to the autoplay feature. Then, when you select autoplay, you have to sit through the previews again before you can watch the program. Anyone with an impatient two-year-old can imagine what a pain this is. Shame on HIT/Lionsgate for forcing this on consumers.",1262649600,4,441,4.815789473684211
3797324,5,B001U7NVWG,"Fireman Sam DVDs are not widely known.  But toddlers LOVE them. I got this one when it came out and for the price it's a steal.  Arrived on time and my granddaughter loved it.  Happy all the way around.

The Fireman Sam series keeps toddlers fascinated, while teaching them great values.  It is the fireman version of Thomas the Tank Engine.  I recommend this for all parents and grandparents.",1246060800,,393,4.6231884057971016
3797325,1,B001U7NVWG,"Disappointed it is the same old episodes on Cable On Demand, just repackaged onto DVD with new date May 2009. There should be more information stating that- save the money and watch it on Cable.",1244073600,3,194,4.571428571428571

The animation is very cute and charming as are the story lines. Each story is around 10 minutes long which is nice if you don't want your kids in front of the TV for too long. Our children choose this video more often than any other in our collection.",1322179200,,419,4.25

8343087,5,B001U7NVWG,"We love Fireman Sam and find ourselves partial to this 'original' version with the claymation look and Welsh dialects.  This DVD includes four episodes: the one where Norman and Mandy are lost with Fire Captain Steele, the one with the mystery of the missing licorice shoelaces, when the carnival comes to Pontypandy and the one with the Joker Soaker.  Its followed by one episode of Roary the Racing Car, another series that my boys love.",1506124800,,439,4.84
