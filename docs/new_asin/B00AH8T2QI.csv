8551543,3,B00AH8T2QI,"I bought this film because I am a fan of Saito Takumi.  I have seen him in both Boys Love and Cafe Seoul in which he co-starred and he was terrific in them.  Unfortunately - although he is good - this film is nothing more than one fight after another.  It is about a school of 3000 students of which over one half are delinquents with a tradition of each year's class having a top dog who is someone who can beat the crap out of everybody else and protect his followers.  Saito's character wants to be the Top Dog and the entire film is one fight after the other with students beating, kicking, using clubs and metal bars to beat each other up. What is amazing is that no one shows any wear or tear.  Hardly anyone, Saito's character does get a black eye and one of his followers ends up with a bandage but is otherwise fine and ready to fight again.  But if you like gratuitous fighting, this film is made for you.",1376784000,,915,4.170454545454546
