2271579,5,B0009811ZG,"Thank goodness this isn't one of them. Everybody's favorite masked man is on DVD!! This collection is simply great. All of the first 100 emails are here in their entirety and complete with the add-ons and easter eggs (be warned though the easter eggs only work when viewing on your computer.)

There isn't too much to say about this collection that you already shouldn't know if you are a strong bad fan. The emails are all great and only get better with time.

Here's hoping that Strong Bad keeps up the great work, as these gems are the bright light that shines through the muck of every day life.",1198454400,3,599,4.486238532110092
2271580,5,B0009811ZG,"Strong Bad is the lead character in the animated fictional world of Homestar Runner, in which he answers emails from fans throughout the world who have visited the actual website. The answers Strong Bad gives to these emails are each the subject of 100 comedic animations under one minute in length and are the centerpiece of this DVD. Strong Bad is modeled after a Mexican wrestler from Nintendo's ""Tag Team Wrestling"", and the creators obviously like poking fun of 1980's era computing by featuring Strong Bad's computer the ""Compy 386"", and then when that computer is destroyed by a virus- and a shotgun - the ""Lappy 486"". My favorite emails include:
""trevor the vampire""- An incomplete email from Trevor the Vampire has Strong Bad fearing the worst- that Trevor has been done in by vampire hunters!
""credit card""-Strongbad gets ""phished"" by someone seeking his credit card information & forwards the email to Homestar. Homestar gives out his credit card info and Strongbad proceeds to buy a spaceship, rocket launcher, killer robot, and 200 bean burritos using the information.
""techno""-Strong Bad gets an e-mail asking if he likes techno. He proceeds to make up and sing a techno song of his own, with accompanyment by The Cheat.
""english paper""- Strongbad writes an English paper for someone- convinced that the secret to success is to have a cool knickname- in this case ""Kyle the Yellow Dart""-, and to tape some money to the last page of the report.
My personal all-time favorite is ""dragon"" in which Strong Bad displays his ""skills as an artist"" as he shows Strong Mad, Strong Sad, and CoachZ how to draw a dragon. Strong Bad names his own drawing ""Trogdor the Burninator"". Trogdor is mentioned on the series finale of Buffy the Vampire Slayer as a tribute by Joss Whedon, who happens to be a big fan of Strong Bad.
In short, the Strong Bad emails are hilarious and the accompanying commentaries and extras found on the DVD are great and are suitable for kids and adults alike. Strongly recommended.",1132272000,17,2008,4.857142857142857
2271581,5,B0009811ZG,This. Is. The. Greatest. DVD. Ever. Way better than those sucky Bratz movies. 10 out of 10! A real winner!!! I love the sing along music videos!! THE BEST BUY AT NEWBERY COMICS EVER!!!,1122076800,5,184,4.4411764705882355
2271582,5,B0009811ZG,"The Coach is so upper-midwestern, dude.  I'm surprised I haven't heard him say ""You betcha!"" yet.  You need to get your accents together.  And YOU, reader of this review, must get with the picture and check out homestarrunner.com.  You don't have to buy this DVD... right now.  Just wait until you've watched every freakin' episode of Teen Girl Squad and well up with tears at the thought of losing this site someday to the great domain in the sky.  Then you'll be crawling back here if you haven't already had the forsight to buy this DVD.  There.  I'm done.",1118361600,7,559,4.575757575757576
2271583,5,B0009811ZG,"If you ask me, this cartoon site just goes to show you that you don't need just juvenile humor or graphic violence just to make an internet cartoon.

Creators Mike and Matt Chapman (aka The Brothers Chaps)have made the cartoon site HOMMESTAR RUNNER, which brought in a large fanbase of teens and young adults, including me. I just LOVE the goofy site; it's fairly clean, safe for kids to watch, and has some downright hilarious stuff to fufill your day.

But the real gems of the site are the Strong Bad's Emails, and this DVD set covers the first 100 of them. How it works is that the arrogant Strong Bad begins typing in his email address on the computer while singing a zany little ditty, and when he reads the email out loud, he'll either answer it by word or pull a crazy stunt on somebody in order to answer it. You'll see him have the cool Bubs make a robot out of SB with a GrapeNuts box, dress the melancholy Strong Sad up as a stuntman for a 007 parody, get sit on by the meaty yet mindless Strong Mad while invisible, try to make the clueless Homestar Runner say smart stuff, make a phone message to make the clueless Marzipan's answering machine explode, team up with his pet The Cheat to go on a ""caper"", give the Poopsmith a cake, spend the night at the old King of Town's place, give the deep-southern accented Coach Z ""Flamin' Hot Chips"", and try to pop Pom Pom with a pin blindfolded (Is that one in this set?).

Anyway, now that this sold on ebay or amazon, I can now find ways to buy set. Oh...Holy...Crap...",1115078400,7,1527,4.3321678321678325

8058503,5,B0009811ZG,"For anyone who has a more sophisticated sense of humor, and by that I mean, if you like amazing rants and ridiculous ramblings of stuff that doesn't necessarily fit together, but somehow ends up workings perfectly, this internet cartoon series is for you. The guys who made this series are geniousess who had a sense of humor possibly on par with the likes of Douglas Adams (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). In my opinion, if you're looking for a good quality laugh, this is where you get it.",1361404800,3,498,4.606741573033708

8058505,5,B0009811ZG,"Successfully making a lifetime fan out of a 20-something with PG humor is an incredible feat in this day and age, and Strong Bad/Homestar Runner's comedic styles, which include surrealism, 80's/90's/00's pop culture references, and social commentary, achieves this in spades.  Highly recommended, especially considering the DVDs are loaded with bonus stuff.  The only bad thing I can say is that the commentaries are only a few seconds long, and are not accessed by the menu.  It is either an ""angle"" option or a ""1 of 2 tracks"" option, and these are not compatible with my not-so-awesome, built-in, very very basic DVD player.",1258070400,3,627,5.067961165048544
8058506,5,B0009811ZG,"If you weren't aware of the site homestarrunner(dot)com (amazon won't let you post the web addresses in reviews, I guess), you wouldn't be familiar with this DVD set. The site is named after the annoying & dimwitted character of Homestar Runner, but it's the e-mails of his rival Strongbad that gains much of the attention of the average site visitor.

There's no need to study up on the background of the characters- you can catch on to things pretty quickly & besides, most of the e-mail topics are incredibly random & varied. If you aren't a fan of madcap, zany & pointless humor then there's a chance that you may not like this set. I do recommend that any potential buyers give it a chance, though. There's something for everyone to laugh at in this set.

Unsure if you want to plunk the money down for this set? An easy solution is to go to the site itself & view a few of the e-mails. After viewing a few you'll be sure to have a greater appreciation for this set. (Most of the people interested in this set will more than likely already be aware of this set, but there's always the potential for new fans of the series!)",1253145600,2,1128,4.392344497607655
8058507,5,B0009811ZG,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  It's great because we hadn't seen all of the newest Strongbad e-mails before, and it was much easier to pop it into the DVD and watch them all without crowding around a computer and constantly having to click here and there to keep going.  Now everyone can enjoy them together.",1227830400,,322,4.5344827586206895
