Contemprorary filmmaking han easily handle it then it was when the ""It Happened Here: History of Hitler's England"" was made.
This movie does not tell full background itself but it is definetly great for those who know British history well.
Whoever, though, put the movie into VHS format did not ""modernize"" it--there are NO close-captions, or color. Re-creators of this movie probably could not emagine the DVD ""extras"" that tell the full background of the story.",1252800000,,515,5.216867469879518
7894011,5,6305741719,"I saw this film at the National Film Theatre in London, UK, in 1997. Some people were so offended that they left the cinema. It starst with the words: ""The conquest of England was swift and brutal. Due to pressure from the eastern from German troops are removed from England, and the garrisoning of England is largely carried out by British volounteers..."" From there on the film gets more provocative.
Low budget, only one professional actor, but the message is hammered home relentlessly: We cannot blame the Germans only for the crimes of the Nazis. Given half a chance we will happily commit them oursleves.",1078704000,9,611,4.828571428571428
7894012,5,6305741719,"I had read about It Happened Here for years before I had a chance to see it and assumed it was created by and for teenaged nerds who make detailed models of Tiger tanks and Stukas.  However, what impressed me the most about this film was its adult, complex plot. I would not have expected two young film and military history geeks to choose as their main character a woman faced with making moral compromises to survive in a Nazi- occupied England. The fanatical devotion to period accuracy that Brownlow and Mollo display only serves to enhance the film's depiction of the brutality of life under the Nazis.",1023494400,16,608,4.62962962962963
7894013,5,6305741719,"The premise of this most unusual war film is that Britain was invaded and occupied after the Dunkirk retreat, and in a mixture of documentary and narrative styles it sets out to tell the story of the occupation that the country narrowly (some would say, unaccountably) escaped, up to and including the 'liberation', orchestrated by the efforts of local partisans with American assistance, in the war's closing year.
It is hard to believe that this film began its life as the spare-time project of 18-year-old Kevin Brownlow, a film enthusiast working in the cutting-room of a small London production company, and his 16-year-old schoolboy friend Andrew Mollo, who had a passion for military history and a collection of old German uniforms and regalia. Starting without a budget, using a borrowed 16 mm camera, the two doggedly pursued their dream of completing the project for almost eight years, finding actors, actresses, sets and backing as they went along.
This is a low-key, reflective war drama, which follows its central character, an Irish- born district nurse working in a village near Salisbury, through the horrors of a partisan ambush that goes wrong, to a chilling Nazi-dominated vision of London, where she finds herself assimilated into the highly political ""Immediate Action Organization"" and receives her ""political re-education"", on to a rural medical centre specializing in euthanasia for ""undesirables"", through to the final chilling irony of ""liberation"" and the wholesale slaughter of ""collaborators"".
The most famous sequence in the work is a six-minute scene in which genuine Neo- Nazis expound their ideas. The Directors were required to cut this sequence at the behest of its first distributor, United Artists, but it has now been reinstated.
I found this film disturbing, unsettling, unforgettable. The scale of the achievement involved in the creation of a work of this quality from such humble beginnings can hardly be overstated.",1006560000,31,1959,5.302250803858521
7894014,5,6305741719,"Considering the problems with getting their independently produced film onto the screen, Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo have succeeded brilliantly. The film follows the story of an average citizen living under Nazi German occupation, in this case what England would have been had the Germans invaded in 1940. With Mollo's historical expertise this is carried out convincingly,especially with the inclusion of foreigners collaborating with the Germans (yes, that did occur in occupied Europe). Technically Mollo succeeds where other less precise film-makers (some with unlimited budgets) fail miserably; the vehicles, weapons, uniforms are what you would see in 1944-1945 Europe.  Despite the amateur nature of some of the actors with spoken (and unspoken) lines, the film nevertheless is enjoyable. The ""documentary"" like cinamatography adds to the illusion. Brownlow and Mollo put together a credible story line, one that enlightens and entertains. If you are interested in seeing, or learning about, life under German occupation during the Second World War, especially that of Western Europe, you will enjoy viewing this classic.",975715200,13,1132,5.6982248520710055
