There are some really good treatments of this story. But this is NOT one of them. No SPFX. No production values. Nothing to justify spending 20 minutes, much less the whole running time. The the that's all folks.",1484611200,,365,4.7936507936507935
8443223,4,B004VDL7NG,"I did like this, I am a Mysterious Island junkie!  I have 4 different movies on this book.  This is an older look and liked that it filled a lot of time so I could work on art projects while it played.  The thing I didn't like it seemed a little darker in mood and I felt like it left some connecting parts out.  Maybe I just missed it.  Still over all if you like this kind of show this is a good collection and worth the money.",1479945600,,429,3.8295454545454546
8443224,2,B004VDL7NG,Am sure Jules Verne is turned in his grave at this idiotic interpretation of his book.  Gawdawful acting and predictable and rather moronic episodes.  Would have been seriously annoyed if I had spent a lot on this.,1472774400,,214,4.756756756756757
8443225,4,B004VDL7NG,Interesting take on the novel by Jules Verne.  Good series and a good add to my sci-fi collection.,1469836800,,98,4.444444444444445
8443226,4,B004VDL7NG,"I wasn't sure about this but to my surprise, it was a fantastic series. Basically some people get stranded on an Island with the devious Captain Nemo who plays with their mind and emotions. It's exciting, mysterious, and has a conclusion at the end. Try it, I think you will enjoy it.

Quality is sharp and clear but it's a former Echo Bridge release and the image gets some pixelation at times. Don't worry, it's not as bad as it seems, totally watchable. Picture is in 4:3 (1.33.1).",1461715200,4,484,4.5
