8121242,5,B000FDECGU,Super great awesome movie! It was filled with memorable quotes and packed with non stop horror/action! Great job by Lloyd Kaufman and Tom Savini. Looking forward to the sequel.,1377734400,,176,5.103448275862069
8121243,1,B000FDECGU,"This isn't even a movie as I understand them. Do not waste your time or money....take a walk instead. The cover has nothing to do with the movie, story (if there is one)or genre. Pitiful! The producers of this trash should be Left Behind after Armageddon.",1307404800,,255,4.565217391304348
8121244,1,B000FDECGU,just don't your better off jumping in front of a speeding locomotive i bought it cause i liked the cover bad mistake,1298246400,,116,4.318181818181818
8121245,1,B000FDECGU,"I'm well aware that when you're buying anything released by Troma, it can be a dodgy proposition.  Most any Troma release can be guaranteed to be funny, stupid, gross, offensive and cheaply made.  There's also a chance that you'll see someone like Ron Jeremy lurking in a cameo.  Or in the case of ""Zombiegeddon"", you'll see an endless parade of horror genre celebrities slumming it in one of the most unfunny, poorly made wastes of time I can recall seeing.  I would be embarrassed to show my face at a convention if I appeared in ""Zombiegeddon"".  With a cast of well-known genre actors, camera in hand and Troma's distribution behind him, the least that director Chris Watson could do was TRY to come up with something worth anyone's time and effort.  In the end, ""Zombiegeddon"" will end up being more useful as a drink coaster in a DVD case.

If there is a plus, it's that there is a rather informative interview with splatter legend Herschell Gordon Lewis included on the DVD as a bonus feature.  Although Lloyd Kaufman surely has enough experience under his belt to better handle the camera and not make Lewis look like he's leering out of the TV screen through a fish eye lens.",1267660800,,1183,4.626794258373206
8121246,1,B000FDECGU,"I rented this movie from a local movie store and laughed at the warnings about how bad it was.  This might be the worst movie ever made!  It is not funny, not scary, and is filled with terrible acting and effects.  Do not waste your money or any portion of your life on this movie.  If you are looking for a funny zombie movie I'd recommend Shaun of the dead or Return of the living dead.",1231459200,,388,4.065789473684211
8121247,1,B000FDECGU,"I like zombie movies.  Some would say I'm obsessed with them (and they'd be right).  I've seen some good zombie movies and, even more, bad ones.  I downloaded this flick to my TiVo box and then I started watching it.  It starts with a warning that no one should watch it and then has another warning, and still another warning (in the form of newscast) about just how bad it is.  This film is the worst piece of excrement, human or otherwise, that I have ever seen.  I only made it through about half of it and decided enough is enough.  As they say, the only two things going for it are that it isn't any longer than it is and it doesn't have Ashton Kucher in it.",1222560000,,664,4.140625
8121248,4,B000FDECGU,"Bad movie, bad acting, bad script--but still a lot of fun if you left your expectations at the door.  :)  Seriously though, some of the actors were great (Joe Estevez dominates his scenes and Jennifer Greer and Ari Bavel are a treat!) and the movie does have it's surprises (a live tiger, anyone...?).  Worth a watch, as long as you remember it's an independent film by an amateur director/producer.",1214006400,,399,4.753623188405797
8121249,1,B000FDECGU,"This movie is total JUNK.  I should have known better but I am a zombie movie addict so I wanted to give it a try.  It's filled with dialouge, stupid and talentless actors, HOMEMADE quality, sexual inuendos, which rather than make me laugh, make me annoyed as Hell.  All around I thought this movie was a complete waste of money and time.",1203120000,2,338,4.419354838709677
8121250,5,B000FDECGU,"Didn't know what to think of this movie, but I kept reading about it all over the internet. Aint It Cool News, especially. So, when I had the opportunity to see this screened in Cleveland, I couldn't pass up the opportunity. This is one hilarous, entertaining little gem of a movie. Some of my B movie favorites like William Smith (The Losers), Robert Z' Dar (Maniac Cop), Linnea Quigley (Return of the Living Dead), Tom Savini (Dawn of the Dead), Edwin Neal (Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Lloyd Kaufman (Toxic Avenger), etc. appear in this movie. There are also a couple of pretty good unknown actors in the lead roles. This movie was incredible. There were tigers running around in there! This movie is so wacked out it's terrific! I would definitely recommend this to someone who enjoys Tromaesque B horror movies.",1145232000,8,813,4.814285714285714
8121251,4,B000FDECGU,"Starring : Ari Bavel, Brinke Stevens, JOE ESTEVEZ, Tom Savini, Lloyd Kaufman, Linnea Quigley, Tom Savini, William Smith, Felissa Rose, Robert Z'Dar, Conrad Brooks, Edwin Neal and Lilith Stabs.

Very humorous ,but Scary Movie, with awesome cast. Stand out performances by Brinke Stevens as the radio talk show host, Lloyd Kaufman as Tromaville College janitor, Joe Estevez as the loyal minion and Edwin Neal as a priest ? The fresh faces in the cast are good, One stand out is ARI BAVEL, as the Corrupt Cop.

The story is very well thought out and it (movie) acts like it wants to join the Zombie Section at Blockbuster or Hollywood video, It would do well there.

The unknown actors do their job well, and provide plot filler till the celebs show up again, again let this critic mention ARI BAVEL deserves a sequel or a internet show based on his character , COPS he ain't, More like Kojak and Buford T. Pusser's ugly baby on steroids. This by by his killing of innocents, till the next zombie got in his sights, He was commited to his own greed and never out of character (A new franchise ICON).

Some celebs just showed up, or were not well? Linnea Quigley, William Smith and sadly Robert Z'Dar. HEY, Yes, I know I didn't list everyone's prior credits, Go to imdb.com or google.com, you lazy ZOMBIE !!!

(one little note, can this be film-looked, It's got that tv news footage look?)",1145145600,7,1385,4.6138211382113825
