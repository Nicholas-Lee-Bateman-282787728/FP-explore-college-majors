8384328,5,B002YOJBX2,"I had never heard the music of this opera, I only knew that it was written by Rossini, but I bought it because of the good reviews and I like to hear operas that I am not familiar with. I didn't know very well the cast either.
When I started watching the DVD I realized that it was a typical opera buffo with a lot of funny situations, some misunderstandings, hilarious scenes and a happy ending.
The cast was very good, in particular Myrto Papananasin who played Donna Fiorella.
The scenery as well as the costumes were very appropriate.
I enjoyed the opera very much.",1464566400,,569,4.428571428571429
8384329,5,B002YOJBX2,"Il Turco has never enjoyed the popularity of its older cousin, L'Italiana in Algerie, which is unfortunate, since Il Turco is wickedly funny and chock full of memorable music. It is said that audiences of the time reacted negatively based on the erroneous perception that Rossini was doing a ""do over"" of L'Italiana to take advantage of that work's exceptional popularity. This is too bad, since it is, when well performed, a delightful theatrical experience.

Fortunately, is this recording, we have an excellent performance of the story of Donna Fiorilla ( sung ravishingly by Myrto Papatanasiu) who loves too well and too frequently for her husband Don Geronio (Bruno de Simone.) Visiting Turkish pasha, Selim (Simone Alaimo), of course, falls for the lady, encouraged by her to do so. Tenor Antonio Siragusa is yet another flame, Don Narciso. It is staged in a largely traditional manner, emphasizing both the wit of the agile score, and the humor of the libretto without turning it into some slapstick parody of what this opera does on its own.

Conducting Rossini is best left to folks who understand Rossini's music, and here, Maestro Jonathon Webb executes in near perfect style.

Disc quality is simply superb.

The performance runs for 162 fun filled minutes with abundant subtitles.

HIGHLY recommended, gentle reader.",1434758400,5,1329,5.1342592592592595

8384331,5,B002YOJBX2,"Why is (or was) this one of the most neglected Operas of Rossini for over a century? Perhaps the hypothesis that I propound here may be the reason(s) why such a tuneful masterpiece was neglected and not really performed to its potential for over a century. Even when it was revived by Callas, it did not become a huge hit (except for Callas herself probably) for a few more decades. Oh yes. Some of the arias etc have always been in the repertoire of some singer or the other, but the Opera as such never took off.

I think it is about to, because the staging of this Opera in this production not only pleases, but such a fantastic recording of such balanced sound (in PCM that I heard it in) is going to make it go a long way. To top it all, the picture is almost perfect as a showpiece for a blu ray recording, although lights are harsh at certain places. To make it even more alluring, not many would fail to be smitten by Myrto Papatanasiu in the role of Fiorella. Let me assure you, a less pretty (or let me be brutally honest, an unattractive or plain 'fat') Soprano could just not have pulled it off, especially with the kind of personality that Fiorella portrays.

So, again according to me, why was this Opera neglected so far?

The incredulous plot (please read it elsewhere on the net, won't waste time elaborating it here) that falls to smithereens after a very solid beginning right up to slightly after the middle of the opera. I will not go into that in detail, it is to be experienced.

The plot is not just incredulous, but extremely daring for the beginning of the 19th century, whatever the truths about the 'morality' of the era may have been, even given the hypocrisy of both the nobility and the peasants alike.
Just about every Commandment has been broken or threatened to be violated in this plot, and that may not have been really acceptable as a laudable theme for the Italians and indeed the rest of Europe at that point time of history. At the end, the reconciliation comes not because of true repentance, but owing to the fear of Fiorella being cast back into poverty by her cuckold husband. Not even Offenbach could have succeeded with that kind of a plot and theme. I am not surprised at all that the Opera was not performed much after the initial forays.
I would also hypothesize that the Opera may have failed because the Male Audience probably found it a little unsettling and felt insecure. Who knows...
It is also noteworthy that no reputed composer ventured into such daring plots about cuckolds - not Donizetti, not Verdi or even Wagner. The sole exceptions may have been the operettas of the late 19th century, but even there, the portrayal of a weak hearted cowardly cuckold was never attempted.

BUT
The Music!!! Wow... So Tuneful and so masterly orchestrated and without overly relying on the usual Rossini trademarks makes for a stupendous score. It is not as predictable as most other popular Rossini scores for Operas, and I am surprised at that too. Maybe I should get hold of the more obscure Rossini and do another study. You will not find too much resemblance with respect to the coloratura passages in say, Barber of Seville or Cenerentola or even Italien in Algiers. It is quite different.

The staging is simply superb, and thankfully they have not chosen to update the time and kill the production.
All the singers do justice to their parts, although I have noticed that all the male singers with the exception of Alaimo (Selim) have had a few problems with the tempo and rapid diction, especially in the first act where they even fall behind the conductor and orchestra. But that is bordering on nitpicking, I must admit.
To nitpick further, I the downsizing of the 7.1DTS to 5.1 loses a hell of a lot (thats why I listened to it in Stereo). I wish there was a bonus of the work being discussed by those who produced and sang in it. It was sorely missed. The trailers too, were rather puzzling. The first three had only the audio (!) I have a Sony BD and it is quite adequate for ALL the other blu rays that I own.

5 Stars definitely. I am sure this particular production will hopefully revive and restore this masterpiece to its deserved place in the Opera houses of the world and bring out more dazzling performances of the work. In this century, I am sure it will not prove to be as unsettling to men as it probably was in the last two centuries...or am I wrong? LOL.. Whatever, but...BUY IT. It is so instantly appealing and tuneful that one will overlook whatever the reasons for it not being a smash hit so far.",1302393600,17,4572,4.501204819277109
