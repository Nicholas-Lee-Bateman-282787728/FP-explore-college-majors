5469294,5,B00AQ6J5JU,"A brilliant debut Terrence Malick's ""Badlands"" first film is a fair cry from what most people would consider a first film--it's an assured debut with strong performances from Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen in the lead roles. Based on the roadtrip and killing spree of Charles Starkweather and his 14 year old girlfriend that occurred in 1958.

Malick's film arrives in a stunning 4K blu-ray transfer that has amazing depth and detail. The colors look gorgeous throughout and the widescreen images (true to the original aspect ratio of the film)are often breaktaking.

This isn't an action film nor a typical thriller.

The audio is presented in a lossless mono soundtrack. The only way they could have improved this would have been to create a 5.1 mix from the original elements (which, no doubt, no longer exist).

We get a New 4K digital restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack.

The special features included with this set are quite good.""Charles Starkweather,"" a 1993 episode of Great Crimes and Trials which gives us background on the people that inspired Malick's film. We also get a new documentary on the making of the film with new interviews featuring Spacek and Sheen discussing the making of the film. We also get new interviews with film editor Billy Weber and producer Edward R. Pressman. As with all Criterion releases we get a booklet featuring an essay by filmmaker Michael Almereyda.

The only person missing is Malick who keeps a pretty low profile now. It's a pity that we don't an audio commentary but the documentary does make up for that.

This edition of ""Badlands"" features a transfer that is the best the film has ever appeared on home videowith some nice extras for the film. I would avoid the Warner DVD and go for the Criterion if you don't have a Blu-ray player. The earlier Warner edition had a full screen transfer of the film (as I recall) while the Criterion looks very similiar to the Blu-ray (perhaps using the same source transfer).

Highly recommended.",1365206400,15,2000,4.896449704142012

5469296,5,B00AQ6J5JU,"This is one interesting drama from the early '70s. And it is a facinating film, especially in this full blown restoration Criterion has done to this little gem. Have had this on LD, VHS, DVD and they all looked bad. This blu ray is like seeing the movie with a new set of eyes! Cannot get over the beautiful cinematography captured on this blu ray. The picture looks grander being in its original 1.85 aspect ratio and the lush colors and detail...breathtaking! Not only is the video prestine, the disc includes a great documentary on the making of this classic with the two leads being interviewed. I can listen to Sissy Spacek talk about movie making all day, very facinating how she really gets in on this interview. Just wished the director was more involved (not even a running commentary). At least he approved this transfer (according to the cover). But all in all, this is a must have in any film collector's collection. This is Malick at his best! Once again Criterion has proved to us why they are THE trusted studio when it comes to blu ray restorations!",1364256000,7,1065,4.610526315789474

5469298,5,B00AQ6J5JU,"I saw Badlands when it first hit the theaters back in the 70's...and immediately went back to see it again.  I believe it's director Terrance Malik's first major movie, and his best.  My feeling is that it is one of the best ever made by any director. I won't write a summary of the true-life based storyline.  That is available elsewhere. Let me just say that I love movies where everything ""works"":  The story, the script, the direction, the acting, cinematography, the serendipidous background soundtrack (music the classical composer Carl Orff wrote for children); and the magnificent acting by Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek, including her voice-overs throughout.  If I had a ""Top Ten"" list, Badlands would be on it.  I'm surprised it took so long to produce it on Blu-Ray.  It's one of the most expensive single DVD's I've ever purchased...don't know why it's priced that high.  But, I'm glad I waited for it. It's worth it.

5469299,5,B00AQ6J5JU,"1958 was a more innocent time in America than today, thus when Charles Starkweather and his teenage girl friend, Carol Ann Fugate, went on a cross-country killing spree, the nation was shocked.

In 1974, writer, producer director Terrence Malick loosely fictionalized the couple's sensational story in BADLANDS, coming up with a hypnotic, visually stunning film that starred Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek as the fugitive lovers.

Spacek lives with her widowed father (Warren Oates) in a small South Dakota town when she first meets Sheen, a local garbage collector.  Dad, who objects to the relationship, becomes Sheen's first victim, after which the couple takes off, taking up residence in a forest tree house until they are forced to kill again.  What really makes this story so disturbing is that it's true.

This edition from The Criterion Collection features a new 4K digital transfer, approved by Malick, a ""Making of"" documentary featuring interviews with Sheen, Spacek and art director Jack Fisk, interviews with associate editor Billy Weber and producer Edward Pressman and a 1993 episode of AMERICAN JUSTICE that tells the true story of Charles Starkweather.

There is also an accompanying booklet with an essay by filmmaker Michael Almereyda.

5469300,5,B00AQ6J5JU,"No lie, friends: Badlands is one of the finest films made in that finest of decades. It stands with Bonnie and Clyde and Thieves Like Us as one of the most evocative crime pictures of the era. It is brilliantly acted, brilliantly scored, brilliantly directed--I tell you, Badlands is a beautiful, beautiful film.
It is also Malick's most inherently entertaining film. That's not to say it's his best, it's just a fact. It's a road movie, a crime film, a romance, a comedy. It's funny as all get out, and what's more, there isn't a single dull moment. Not one.",1361491200,,559,4.6
5469301,2,B00AQ6J5JU,"In the direction we see a burgeoning auteur. I don't think this film quite holds up today but nonetheless a Bluray viewing is mandatory.

I do think it would be average with critics if it came out today because the acting is only okay, the editing is average, and many of the film's best scenes are too subdued for their own good, too low budget for me to really take them in. Malick today would really make this film sing imo.

By this I mean the picture is dated. Many pictures from the 70s are not dated to this point. This one sadly doesn't make that list in my opinion. We have done killer films better before and since. I will admit that Malick was young and I respect what he did at this point in time and even what he tried to do. That doesn't have anything to do with valid criticism though.

And beyond that, these characters are not very well written or believable in any realistic context, and even Malick is nowhere near his best, which, should be obvious for any young filmmaker at this point in time of a career. His cuts and transitions leave a lot to be desired if you are coming from his later films.

The direction and cinematography here, while sufficient and very well done in places, simply cannot mask the mediocre writing and the way the actors approach the script. It does have some beautiful scenes no doubt and Malick does his best with the material as a director, but something here isn't doing it for me.

I bet if he revisited this material today we would see a true masterpiece.",1202342400,5,1509,4.375

5469314,5,B00AQ6J5JU,"Wonderfully complex and hilariously disturbing.  This is a movie that makes you take a hard look at how we treat violence (in films and in society) and how a lot can be forgiven if our hero (villain?) is charismatic and handsome.  Strange, beautiful, heartwarming and horrifying.  Martin Sheen's performance is one for the ages.  I love this movie!",1436486400,,348,4.948275862068965
5469315,3,B00AQ6J5JU,"Movies such as SUGARLAND EXPRESS, NATURAL BORN KILLERS and KALIFORNIA likely owe some of their DNA to Terrence Malicks directorial debut BADLANDS.  It traces the exploits of a man and his teenage girlfriend who go on, if not quite a spree, a long run of evading the law and killing witnesses along the way.

I will admit right up front that Im not the biggest Terrence Malick fan.  Ive yet to see a movie of his that really gripped meand Im usually up for just about anything in a movie.  His fans often praise his take on humans and how they fit with nature.  THE THIN RED LINE juxtaposed shots of war with long, drawn-out takes of nature.  Soldiers walking through lovely fields of flowers, gently running their hands over the delicate plants as the sway in the wind.  They are sometimes lovely images, but Malick is often too indulgent, in my opinion, and forgets to tell a story or craft his message in a way that is resonant.  I can discern the meaning of what hes trying to dosometimesbut I never feel it in my heart or gut.  Its okay if a director wants to be leisurelybut it shouldnt feel like hes wandering or even dozed off.

This juxtaposition with nature is only just emerging in BADLANDS.  Mostly we follow the two main characters:  Martin Sheen is the 25 year old James Dean wanna-be (this is set in 1959) who just lost his job as a trash collector and is now working on a cattle farm.  He has fallen in love with 15 year-old Sissy Spacek, a vacuous girl, watched over by her protective father (Warren Oates).  Sheen slowly wins her trust and apparently her love.  We can see the fascination and perhaps passion he has for her.  But Spaceks character is too young, immature, uninformed and lacking in experience to really seem to know what to make of Sheen, their relationship and eventually the deadly turn their relationship takes.  They feel compelled to go on the lam, and Spacek passively joins in.  She never seems horrified by the events that take place and just lets Sheen dictate the terms of their lives.

The best scenes come fairly early in their journey, as they spend some time living in a forest in a makeshift treehouse.  Sheen has a lightness in his movements that show his enjoyment in living off the land and being away from civilization.  It would appear his more relaxed attitude allows Spacek to loosen up a bit.  If left alone, they might have lived out their lives as a sort of Swiss Family Robinson.  But soon, the law catches up to them, and the level of senseless killings increase.  We can hardly but hate Sheens character and at best, be aggravated and confused by Spaceks.

This lack of self-reflection is not entirely a criticism of the film.  The seeming lack of conscious of these characters is startling.  Not because they feel like psychos (think Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis in NATURAL BORN KILLERS) but because they feel like empty husks.  The film seems to suggest that in the face of unformed or unconsidered inner lives, we might all be killers without reason or remorse.  In one scene, Spacek is reading aloud from the book KON-TIKI (the true story of Thor Heyerdahls Atlantic crossing) and she is on scene where the conditions of the sea are becoming threatening, and the characters aren't sure yet how to react.  Sheen observes aloud, Hes nervous, and Spacek looks back at Sheen and smiles proudly, likes hes said the most profound thing ever.  If this passes for profound for these guys, is it surprising that the lives of others mean so little?

The fugitives eventually end up in the badlands of South Dakota and Montana.  There are huge vistas and amazing clouds, and Sheen takes time to comment on their beauty.  Again, he seems only vaguely at peace when able to take in natural beauty (another Malick theme in this film).  Its a nice though.  And the scenery is lovely and nicely photographed (and looks great on Criterions Blu-ray).  I don't want to spoil much else, but you certainly won't be surprised to hear that their jaunt across our country doesnt go on forever.  And when it all ends, the lack of remorse is complete.  Its not even a thought that crosses their minds.  Chilling, in its way.

The Criterion version includes many excellent special features, but I really like the cheesy 90s era episode of AMERICAN JUSTICE that tells the story of Charles Starkweather and his teenage girlfriend who go on an 8 day killing spree in Nebraska and Wyoming.  This true story served as an inspiration for BADLANDS.  And after seeing this, I have a stronger appreciation for Spaceks characterapparently sociopathic, passive teenage girls DO exist.  The details of their spree are more horrific than anything in Malicks film (if he had copied events more closely, there would have been no chance to feel any sympathy for the characters).

The film moves briskly enough (especially for a film from the 70s) and I think it holds up fairly well, because even then it was a bit of a period piece.  Sheen is quietly charismatic, and is really the glue that holds the film together.  Spacek is young and her best acting still lay a couple of years ahead.  BADLANDS is worth watching, even if you're not a Malick fan, because it was part of a new era in American filmmaking, it tells a compelling (but frustrating) story and yes, the shots of nature are lovely.",1434153600,3,5323,4.636752136752137

5469317,5,B00AQ6J5JU,"Badlands is not only my favorite of Terrance Malick's films (it was his debut film) but my favorite crime film as well. Based on the story of real-life serial killer Charles Starkweather, played here by a young, intense Martin Sheen (as ""Kit""), the film is narrated by Sissy Spaceck's naive, 15 year-old ""Holly"" (her voiceovers aid the storytelling perfectly) and both characters are portrayed as real human beings (yet Malick does not romanticize their actions).  After much violence, committed by Kit, and he two end up on the lam through South Dakota and the Great Plains, the true cinematic beauty of the film is captured.

I hadn't seen the film in over a decade when I bought this Criterion edition and the crisp, brilliant restoration of the original film is immediately noticeable. The sound design has been brightened noticeably.  A great, informative 45 minute documentary, ""Making Badlands"" is also included. I highly recommend this edition to anyone who hasn't seen the film but also to those who haven't seen it since the original screenings (or have only seen the VHS or original DVD).  This is the true starting point for Malick, Badlands would launch the career of one of cinemas most enigmatic and artful filmmakers.",1421452800,,1233,5.0

5469342,4,B00AQ6J5JU,"""Badlands"" is a beautifully shot film, directed and written by America's great filmmaker, Terrence Malick. It's the story of a troubled young man, played by Martin Sheen, who falls in love with a young girl, played by Sissy Spacek. When her father disapproves of their courtship, Sheen's character murders him and the two go on a murder spree through the MidWest.

The film fumbles a bit in its third act, portraying Sheen as some sort of folk hero, but other than that, it's a gem of a movie. Great cinematography, and the suspense and tension is tight throughout.",1378166400,,565,4.76530612244898

5469345,3,B00AQ6J5JU,The picture has a lot of grain most of the time and isn't that sharp by today's standards. Some of the closeups look a little better. This was evidently Terrence Malick's first film out of film school and it shows. Although there are some creative and artistic photographic elements the acting and story telling comes up a little short. I didn't really feel the emotion or motivation behind Martin Sheen's character that led him to want to go around shooting people.,1377475200,2,466,4.765432098765432
5469346,1,B00AQ6J5JU,"I'm sure that my comment will get a torrent of angry comments. This is just a very poor film that perhaps is representative of people who knew what happened at the time it happened and this film is some type of memento from their youth. I just don't get it.

People hold out this film as if it's a group of youngsters without a conscience. But that really isn't the case. First it is full of contradictions. Kit seems like he is a logical person to some degree and has some respect for the opinions of others. And his gal... well she is all upset about killing a sick pet. But those scenes magically disappear as we move to the next segment. Besides this illogical and inconsistent display of emotion, it's an entire film full of characters that seem not to give a damn about the seriousness of what happened throughout the film. It's preposterous. It's not limited to the two protagonists. As the film plays out, you will not believe the way things work out at the end. It feels like this movie was given a good old Hollywood ending and it's laughs and smiles all around! Even the music at the end seems like island music you might hear from Disney's Under the Sea or some other tropical island paradise.

The script preposterously calls for country bumpkins yet these two were surely both eloquent and insightful. The characters were completely out of their place and element. It's supposed to be some sort of Bonnie and Clyde without anything other than a script to move characters along to a next scene. What motivated Kit to suddenly do what he did? It attempts to show some type of indifference but instead of seeing and believing, there is just talky dialogue trying to explain / rationalize why the scene just happened. This movie is chilling? Baffling is more like it. There is an inconsistency in how people are treated along this preposterous journey. One day stuff happens, you don't know how Kit changed or why. No explanations. Extremely unsatisfying.

The inane script ruins the two positives: beautiful scenery and a good cast. The interminable chatty philosophical insights probably are reflective of something the Director would think and write but certainly not the characters. This is not like the awkward dated moments you might have in an old Hitchcock movie that are representative of the time. There just is no buildup of emotion in any way.

Want to see a psychopathic film with gorgeous scenery? See No Country for Old Men. At least an iota of character development where this film had virtually none.",1376956800,9,2527,4.710407239819005

5469362,5,B00AQ6J5JU,"A masterwork is a hard thing to come by, and once you find one, it becomes impossible to let it go. Make no mistake about it, Badlands is a masterpiece of the highest order. It is a film I might never recover from, like all of Terrence Malick's films, Badlands aims to get personal with its audience. Badlands has officially entered my top ten favorite films ever made. Chilling, haunting, sublime, and enigmatic, Badlands is a blessing.

It is a film about a savage murder spree and the lovers who went through with it. Kit and Holly, played incredibly well by Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek, are the lovers on the run, killing anyone they see fit, all the while remaining charismatic, likable, and most of all, relatable. Just imagine if the films of Quentin Tarantino actually had soul. My interest in the films of Quentin Tarantino dwindles more and more as the years go by. I've come to the conclusion that the man is not only a hack but a thief, and his crimes against Badlands did not go unnoticed nor can they ever by forgiven or forgotten.

If I could pick one word to describe the films of Terrence Malick, it would have to be 'poetry'. Badlands is one of the cinema's boldest and most chilling poems. I could go on forever about how I analyzed the film but these 'films of the day' are meant to be brief, so I'll spare myself the time and energy I'd spend on writing something that will never actually be read. Just know that the film is brilliant, in every single aspect, one the my favorite films of all time, and the best directorial debut ever. Beautiful and intimate, Badlands is a true treasure.

Bare with me while I praise Martin Sheen. He was just incredible in the film. Badlands' Kit is quickly becoming one of my all time favorite screen characters. Sheen was extraordinary, and has definitely proven that he was one of the best actors of the seventies, and that's a pretty big accomplishment once you consider his contemporaries. I absolutely loved his performance. Great talent.

The film is otherworldly, maybe even mystical. A visual poem full of lyrical beauty. I believe that Badlands best represents American cinema of the seventies. There is an intimacy that no other film, aside from maybe Malick's other ventures, has been able to match. An amazing film that I recommend to everyone I know. A top ten mainstay for me, and a film that like none other. An addictive film, I can watch Badlands over and over again, and I do.

Holly's father warns Kit to stay away from his daughter, leading to a showdown of sorts between the two men that ends with an act of violence. Kit leaves a record player playing a recorded message claiming that he and Holly are going to kill themselves (to throw off the authorities), and sets fire to the house before escaping with Holly, setting off on a journey whose course is foreshadowed by something Kit says in the aforementioned recording: ""Nobody's coming out of this thing happy...especially not us.""

From their makeshift home in the woods and a brief, violent visit to an old friend of Kit's, to their dash for the mountains of Saskatchewan (which to Kit represent freedom beyond the reach of the law), we are given a window into Holly's private thoughts through the use of voice-over, a sometimes vapid, sometimes rambling commentary from a young girl that can also be frightening at times, like when she thinks after Kit commits a triple murder: ""At this moment, I didn't feel shame or fear, but just kind of blah, like when you're sitting there and all the water's run out of the bathtub.""

Holly chitchats with a teenage girl, who is likely not much older than herself, surely knowing that the girl will most likely come to a bad end, and soon. Kit records nonsensical ""advice"" (for whose benefit, we're not quite sure) into a Dictaphone while holding a man and his housemaid hostage. The pair politely ask a man if they can borrow some gas before Kit pulls out a gun when the man refuses. Kit and Holly dance together in the glare of headlights while listening to Nat King Cole. We watch them drive though a great emptiness under painfully blue skies, heading somewhere, reaching for something, while seeming to not quite know where or what it is they are searching for. And all the while we remember those words spoken earlier in the film, ""...especially not us."" But as Kit concedes in that same recorded message: ""I can't deny we've had fun, though.""

And the reason for it all? There is no reason here, no logic to these senseless acts of violence. It's best summed up in a line from the short story ""Nebraska"" by Tennessee Jones, a story inspired by the Bruce Springsteen song of the same name, which in turn was inspired by this film. When the girl asks the boy why he killed a man, he answers simply: ""I don't think I need a reason for that. He was doing what he does, and here I am doing what I do.""",1365552000,3,2714,4.557377049180328

8556137,5,B00AQ6J5JU,"If you have not seen this film, you are lacking a critical film from the 20th century. The talent on this film is extraordinary. Terrence Malick directed it which is reason enough for watching it. But if that isn't enough, seeing both Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek at the start of their careers is sublime.

If you identify Martin Sheen with tv shows, as many do, it is a major discovery to see all of his talent on film. The other major film role for him was APOCALYPSE NOW. This film is tied with that one for being his very best performances ever.

One might mistake this film initially for being one of Oliver Stone's or Quentin Tarantino's. That is because of high amount of violence in the film and that it centers on a killing spree launched by these two characters beginning in the Badlands section of America. But Malick's take on that plot is sheerly poetic which the others' films are not.

If you are or were a Charlie Sheen fan, it is eerie to watch this film. For a moment you might think you are watching Charlie Sheen when you begin watching. The resemblance between the two men in every respect is startling. However, Martin Sheen has lived a life under very tight control, which has kept him on course through every film and tv series. I think Charlie got all of his talent but none of his control.

A word of caution: there is an act of startling violence at the beginning of the film. This is something terrible that the Sissy Spacek father does. Gird yourself for it because otherwise you may not be able to keep watching.",1468886400,,1543,4.4416961130742045

8556139,5,B00AQ6J5JU,"BADLANDS is an amazingly beautiful film about a seriously dark subject based on a real story.  It's not a film for everyone's tastes, but it's a classic example of exceptional filmmaking.
BADLANDS was acclaimed director Terrence Malick's first movie after film school. He had a lot to prove in untested waters. Here is also a chance to see a young Cissy Spacek and a handsome young model-perfect Martin Sheen before fame came their way.
The film is loosely based on the 1958 murder spree by 19-year-old Charles Starkweather.  Was his 15-year-old girlfriend Caril Ann Fugate a willing accomplice or was she a desperate hostage trying to stay alive? BADLANDS deviates from the facts and somewhat idolizes the murderer now called Kit and his girlfriend Holly. Yet, it is a deep character study of two lost souls who have collided into one destiny.
Stunning photography and sets turn a stark location into a thing of beauty. It's already a clear vision of Malick's style and of things to come.
Sheen was 31 when the film was made so his teenage character was aged to 25. Spacek is seriously convincing as an innocent 15-year-old despite being around 24 at the time. Sheen is one of America's great actors but it was a surprise to see him as a sexy James Dean type often shirtless and in tight jeans with a glorious mop of hair. Spacek is chilling and convincing as a 15-year-old. This film explodes with the talents of its young stars, director and production crew.
The beauty of this film and its haunting music cannot not be underestimated. What turned a young man into a murderer? Starkweather killed 11 people including 10 in an 8-day spree. BADLAND'S murderous Kit is less vicious. The facts are changed. Fugate had a mother, stepfather and baby sister. Holly just has a father. I wondered why they took the basics and changed the facts so drastically.
Of course the meat of the story is the troubled relationship of Kit and Holly. Was Holly a willing accomplice or did her age and devotion to Kit turn her into some sort of hostage in a trance? Fugate always claimed to have been innocent of any crimes. BADLANDS gives fuel for thought and in the end the viewer must decide Holly's guilt or innocence.
Again, BADLANDS won't appeal to everyone with its vivid depictions of murder. Film buffs can't miss this stunning example of filmmaking. The beauty of this film is beyond compare. It's a vision of great things to come from Malick, Spacek and Sheen. As an aside, Spacek met her husband production designer Jack Fisk on this film and they are still together. Great things did come out of this film.",1456963200,,2600,4.712087912087912
