7564816,4,B0196ZK37E,"Bearing credits to Israeli-created ""Prisoners of War"", this American TV show, Seasons 1-4, is a completely different produce reflecting US realities of interracial and political affairs.

Brutality, sexism, macho culture and complete arrogance to everything and everyone while playing own paranoia- and mistrust- infested games dominates.

A bunch of unruly intelligence agents saves a world from enemies as their colleagues conspire with the same antagonists they fight.

Grasping, controversial story.",1476230400,,503,6.1571428571428575

8744223,5,B0196ZK37E,"Good collection. We didn't get that full series, but the four years provide quite enough high quality episodes. Similar interest an quality to a full series package of West Wing that we also own.",1516060800,,195,4.764705882352941
8744224,5,B0196ZK37E,Fantastic series. Continued watching for multiple seasons. This purchase was to rejuvenate my library with exciting and dramatic videos.,1501459200,,136,6.2105263157894735
8744225,1,B0196ZK37E,"This series is in no way to be considered rated ""G"".  A substantial amount of nudity, graphic sex and graphic torture.  Story moves at glacier speed and is depressing, at best.  Wish I could send back  the four seasons pack, only watched the first 5 episodes. Don't meet to watch any more.",1501027200,,289,4.5
8744226,5,B0196ZK37E,"Great storyline, great character development.  This was a series I wasn't sure if I would like but after the first one, I was hooked!  I tend to binge watch, so this was a great product for a weekend.  The discs work flawlessly and are packaged well.",1496275200,,250,4.391304347826087
8744227,5,B0196ZK37E,I hadn't watched this series before getting the season 1-4 pack. Now I'm hooked on it.,1496188800,,86,4.4375
8744228,1,B0196ZK37E,"This is not a review on the DVDs nor the 1-4 DVD pack, but Homeland in general, on Showtime.  One star for good to great acting on the part of most actors. Zero stars for almost everything else.  This show went from being somewhat interesting and credible to total trash.  Carrie is beyond stupid - nothing to do with acting bipolar, just plain inane.  For someone trained to not trust and question everything, someone who knows how everything is show and smoke screens, and portrayed as having a sixth sense she really drops the ball far too many times.  The sixth season totally kills any value this might have had, especially when it comes to how she relates to and treats Quinn and how slow she is to ""get it.""  She's great at lower lip trembling and whining, and distressed - oh I am hurting so bad and getting so emotional faces and tears! - I'll give her that, but it becomes old quickly - and it's that even good acting? Not!  Pity, because it could have been entertaining.",1494892800,,981,4.446927374301676
8744229,4,B0196ZK37E,"Very suspenseful and entertaining. Based on somewhat true to life circumstances, and current events happenings in the country and other parts of the world.",1494374400,,155,5.5
8744230,5,B0196ZK37E,Homeland is an excellent series!!,1492905600,,33,5.8
8744231,1,B0196ZK37E,You like this series or not. The one star is because this is the worst quality DVD series I have ever watched. The discs stick and on one episode on each disc the sound and video are out of synch. Of course it's too late to return them,1491868800,3,235,3.9166666666666665
8744232,3,B0196ZK37E,"Pretty good story, somewhat predictable.  I like it better than my husband.  He says Claire Danes drives him crazy because she is so manic.",1487894400,,139,4.75
