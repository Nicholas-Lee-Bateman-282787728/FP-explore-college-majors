Nonetheless, I found this to be an entertaining and informative documentary.

The video provides a history of the company & the founders, a decent history of the development of the Cadillac from the 1920's to the 1990's, and it has some great archival footage. For example, the video contains rare footage of the first Cadillac off the assembly line, the first Cadillac plant, the first meeting of the first Cadillac board, etc.

Even though its not perfect, you can't really find a video solely dedicated to this subject anywhere else. I suspect that, despite some minor quirks, any automobile aficionado or the loyal Cadillac fan would enjoy this film.",1188950400,,918,4.9480519480519485
