8579156,4,B000HKEQ8U,"A typically Albion-re-made story about Lucas a commoner leaving behind both well-hilled driving-sports-car/ horse-riding husband Pierre and Nicias the Milord-guarded-round-a-clock, by bedding Melissa, a wealthy house-wife bored.

And Bilitis-who? A pupil of both an epoch and age not defined precisely by a script-writer, a puberty-reached teen experimenting with females only, who-knows-why taken by a family friend Melissa for holidaying-hah, they did it, and Lucas, a photographer ageless was afterwards exercising his manhood with an older experienced housewife instead a virgin, surely same-gender-attracted schoolgirl, which looked simply as a mere natural sex-object substitution for ""normal"" Melissa also no convincible mentioning of satisfying gained was expressed.

Nice performing, the very romantic staging while a further sequence of Nicias the Milord with his bodyguards in a bedroom was explicitly seen as logical extending of this movie.

  P.S.  Unexplainably, a tag ""paedophilia"" was saved from a third attempt recently.
Well, does it change a very essence of the screened???",1325462400,,1093,6.019354838709678
8579157,1,B000HKEQ8U,"David Hamilton's oeuvre of late 1970s erotica is known above all for its imagery, particularly his limpid images of teenage girls exploring their sensuality. Plot, such as it is, is simply a device to link the nude scenes. It's dated stuff but he still has a following. Arguments rage over whether it's art or smut. Like it or loathe it there can be no argument that picture is paramount.
This Australian DVD release fails Hamilton badly because of the dire quality of the transfer. It has been mastered from videotape rather than film and mastered badly. The image quality is coarse and the early scenes are further marred by video tracking error. The frame edges are ragged rather than sharp and straight. The aspect ratio is 1.33:1 rather than the 1.85:1 of the 35mm cinema release.
Save your money and hold out for a version remastered from the original film elements and presented in 1.85:1.",1192665600,7,896,4.787096774193548
