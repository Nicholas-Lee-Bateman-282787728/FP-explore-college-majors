8373440,4,B002M2T21M,"this is not really a review but more of a telling that this is the last part of the season 1 DVD collection. its a little confusing seeing how the second season has four parts so i just wanted to tell people who might purchase this that this is indeed the last one. I have watched the show when it was on sci fi, but i did not get to finish it. however, i decided to purchase the dvd's and finish the show myself. i do recommend this show to anime or gundam fans alike.",1350691200,3,469,3.9473684210526314

8373443,5,B002M2T21M,"Without giving away any spoilers, this is the point where the #&@* hits the fan.  The Trinity team has continued their senseless violence and begin to attack civilian targets.  The Ptolemenos crew and the four Gundams decide to intervene, considering Trinity to be promoters of war and destruction.  The plot threads that have been woven during the first season really begin to play out.  We soon find out more about each characters past and explore the relationships of some of the principal characters to each other.

I recommend watching in Japanese with English subtitles due to the amazing talent that Sunrise seems to find for their Gundam franchise.  On par with Gundam Seed (not Destiny) as far as the quality of the story and voice acting but with far superior animation.  Awesome series!",1265673600,4,797,4.947368421052632
