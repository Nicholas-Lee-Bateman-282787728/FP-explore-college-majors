8472716,4,B005H7WDWY,"This DVD is a reissue by Euroarts of Kultur's video program of Arrau's 1984 concerto and recital appearances from the Teatro Municipal in Santiago, Chile. Arrau is also interviewed and briefly discusses the works and his relationship to them with some telling remarks. The musical program is as follows:

Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 4 Op. 58 with the University of Chile Symphony conducted by Victor Tevah
Beethoven: Piano Sonata No. 7 Op. 10 No. 3 in D
Schubert Drei Klavierstcke D946: No. 1 In E Flat Minor
Chopin: Ballade No. 3 Op. 47 in Ab
Debussy: L'Isle Joyeuse
Liszt: Sonetto del Petrarca No. 104

Beethoven's exuberant Piano Sonata Op. 10 No. 3 in D (1798) is the highlight of the eighty-year-old's performances here. Additionally, this early D major Sonata makes it only film appearance by Arrau on this DVD and its excellence alone should qualify it for purchase consideration.

Arrau navigates the mercurial juxtaposition of ideas and pianistic demands with unforced ease as his handling of the unusual ""Presto"" opening movement makes abundantly clear. This movement is composed on an expansive canvas, with subsidiary themes to the main subjects that demand an awareness of perspective in the overall form. The initial motive's upbeat character and the thematic relationships to a single motivic cell are well exposed in this performance, showing for all its wealth of ideas just how tightly compressed and compact the movement is.

Arrau's playing typically exhibits flexibility and nobility of tone and phrasing while maintaining the dramatic tension even through rests and fermatas. Appropriate weight is given to each new texture, be it of a pianistic nature or imitating an orchestra or string quartet. To phrase endings he consistently gives a sense of repose and completion before beginning the next musical thought. Arrau's forte playing is never percussive, achieving its effect by relaxed distribution of upper body weight transferred to hands and fingers that remain close to the key surface. Throughout the first movement, all of the brilliant scales, arpeggios, octaves, broken 6ths, double 3rds, hand-crossing, various accents and articulations, contrapuntal writing and over the bar-line phrasing are performed with awareness for textural clarity and stay within the confines of an overall high-spiritedness. Even the development section - beginning in D minor and taking off from an interrupted move to Bb major - builds its drama with ever rising excitement and inevitability to the big dominant chord which heralds the recapitulation.

Arrau states in the interview on this DVD that fidelity to the musical score should lay the foundation for any creative flights and his playing leads by example. The famous ""Largo e mesto"" is played with dignity and depth while maintaining an essential forward flow of line. The gravity of this movement is the heart of this Sonata and was a huge step forward in terms of how Beethoven expressed a newfound tragic weight in music. Arrau quietly asserts himself at the start, aware of the underlying pulse, sense of foreboding and desperation of the single-voice laments. He draws out the contrasts between themes and carefully places the elements within their musical context as he builds the inner turmoil organically towards climactic points. Music almost always requires a sense of repose after such moments but it is the overall momentum and dramatic pacing which is so notable in Arrau's performance.

The final two movements - a Minuetto with Trio and a Rondo - counter-balance the weight of the opening movements. The Minuetto is played with stately character but with ample dynamic contrasts. The naive musical question and pregnant rests which serve as the main motive to the Rondo, the movement's push and pull, its interrupted cadences, modulations, cheeky chromatic runs, dissipations and cadenzas, reveal Beethoven at his young, whimsical best. Arrau's playing is always colorful and finds expressive context for how these devices are put together.

Though easily able to despatch the musical and technical demands at this autumn stage of his career, it is worth comparing Arrau's 1938 Berlin recording of the same work&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Claudio-Arrau-in-Germany-Pre-War-Recordings/dp/B00004T92Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Claudio Arrau in Germany: Pre-War Recordings</a>. The 1984 reading retains a spirit that has not forgotten the exuberance of youth even if some of the immediate physicality has given way to a wisdom which places greater value on efficiency and reserve.

While not reaching the same high artistic or technical levels as the Sonata, the Concerto and other recital pieces clearly reveal Arrau's committed concentration to the material at hand. It is indeed wonderful to see Arrau playing the first of Schubert's Drei Klavierstcke D946, a set of pieces he recorded for EMI in the 1956 with tremendous results&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ICON-Claudio-Arrau-Virtuoso-Philosopher-of-the-Piano/dp/B004HF0PEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ICON: Claudio Arrau: Virtuoso Philosopher of the Piano</a>. Interestingly, in the Chile recital he chose to omit the final episode in D946 No. 1 which was intact on the 1956 recording. For those viewers primarily interested in Arrau playing the Beethoven G major Piano Concerto, the film from 1983 with the Philadephia Orchestra under Ricardo Muti may be a preferable option&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Age-of-Piano/dp/B00008ADAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Age of Piano</a>.",1335139200,3,5677,5.75
