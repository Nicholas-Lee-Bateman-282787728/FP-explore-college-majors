7846263,4,6303394140,"This video is the sixth in a 10-video set documenting Rock `n' Roll in America.  It's very entertaining and informative, although more on the entertainment side.

This video covers the era of the 60s--Woodstock, the Isle of Wight Festival, the deaths of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and the anti-war movement.  It's a lot to cover, and as the video is only 60-minutes long, it does its best.

Although the other videos up until this point have been pretty clean, this one contains (surprise) a decent bit of nudity and cursing.  One lady is even interviewed topless.  I'd have to give this one an R-rating (I don't work for the MPAA, so don't take my word for it).

What I really liked about this video in particular was that it showed some of the great aspects about the hippie movement without romanticizing it.  They showed clips from the Isle of Wight Festival, and there are some powerful moments when the rock stars comment about the wave of rock star deaths during that time.

The video (as it seems to continue to do) does not do a good job of explaining why the hippie movement really started, or why it ended.  These are more social issues than musical ones, but none of these videos really can get more than four stars from me so far.

Enjoy.",1102723200,,1266,4.557522123893805

Well put together, it is extremely interesting.  Maybe not for a teacher to SHOW the students, but any high-schooler ought to see this to understand where rock n roll fit in.  Oh, for the days of a real drummer.....",1077840000,,346,4.896551724137931
7846265,5,6303394140,"This History of Rock'n'Roll segment ""My Generation"" covers the '60s counter-culture and puts it in coherent framework.  Interviews with Chet Helms (who put Janis Joplin into Big Brother), Janis, Hendrix, Arlo Guthrie, Pete Townshend, Levon Helm (The Band), Jerry Garcia, Country Joe, Ray Manzarek, and many others make this a true Sixties experience.
  We get some great footage of Woodstock, the Isle of Wight (where Joni Mitchell has to calm down a hostile crowd), and of course the Greatful Dead (I Will Survive).  As Jerry says the sixties opened a door for a moment and we saw a quick glimpse of how things could be; then that door slammed shut.  With this documentary we also have a moment where we feel we are actually back in the sixties--sex, drugs, rock, and revolution in the air.
  Also included are some sixties hecklers including Ronald Reagan who denounces rock shows.  And as David Crosby says the counter-culture was right about everything...except drugs.

  Overall a great overview of the most incredible decade in history.",1063584000,6,1042,5.035087719298246
