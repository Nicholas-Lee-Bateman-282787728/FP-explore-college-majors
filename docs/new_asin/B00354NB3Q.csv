This is also not a Gary Null production, as I had assumed. But he is interviewed along with Dick Gregory and several other respected professionals. This documentary begins by highlighting the globalization of agriculture and commerce and the resultant devastation it is causing society by way of massive, widespread disease.

""FAST MOVING AND INTENSE DOCUMENTARY""? Not really. It's a rather slow moving, lower budget production.

BUT -- big BUT here -- it is worth the low cost of $11-15 or so. It includes information we should all be armed with regarding how governments and the world banking system are selling out our individual health rights through corporate-controlled government. But there's not too much on politics so as to obscure the health focus of the movie - after about 10 minutes it moves into the healing power of some of the world's most common herbs and plants. I learned there are more varieties of the aloe plant than I ever imagined (and I've been studying alternative health for nearly 40 years), and that the Aloe Vera variety has already been approved for fighting cancer in animals, including feline leukemia. It tells that another variety, Aloe Ferox, is 22 times stronger than Aloe Vera which is the most common type of aloe found in local health food stores today.

Some of the segments are shot in an interview-style format in front of a display of some sort of branded aloe product. At first I was put off by this, wondering if there was a hidden agenda attempting to push a product. But I don't think this was the case because the brand name and marks are blurred out, and the segments are brief, centered around healing stories from diseases such as diabetes and infertility, with narration interspersed about aloe's use for hair growth, stomach pains, skin wounds, glaucoma, and as a powerful cancer fighter.

This important information may be emerging due to India's and some developing countries in Africa's attempts at hanging on to their traditional remedies. This also serves to support the public's access to these remedies without buying into the traditional medical model. I admire them for not laying down in the face of the ever-powerful pharmaceutical industry. These people, who have had to fight for generations against all odds, are a generation who clearly will not be silenced.

There is also info on other healing herbs and plants such as hemp, hashish, marijuana, garlic, onions, and even royal jelly and Chinese Medicine. I've seen most of these covered in the books I have, but not with the detail provided here regarding the variety of problems and diseases these remedies address. It talks about the many uses of hemp, including biomass fuels (with a little info on how they are made. Fascinating!) and how Henry Ford constructed an entire car out of hemp. (I read elsewhere this metal was ten times the strength of the current metal used). And there's more interesting tidbits on the subject.

I would have liked more information on specific healing modalities such as how much of a specific remedy for which disease.... Although most health-related DVD's omit specifics such as this, they usually offer a companion book to supply these details.

It's less than an hour long but could have easily been twice the length without becoming boring. It offers a nice starting point on some important healing remedies.",1353024000,4,3516,4.929054054054054
