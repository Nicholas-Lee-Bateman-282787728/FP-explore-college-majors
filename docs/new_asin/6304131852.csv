Now, both films are very old and silent, so if you don't like black and white films, this isn't for you. Let me start with The Hunchback  of Notre Damme. They way the film is made and acted is absolutely  brilliant. Chaney is absolutely brilliant as Quasimodo and the makeup is  very good for it's time. Then there is the Phantom of The Opera. I loved  it! I enjoyed this one more than the hunchback but this is because I am a  big fan of Webber's musical. Again, brilliantly done and acted. Chaney  astounded me as the Phantom and sure you will get the same reaction. They  were instant classics when they came out and always will be!",946944000,2,714,4.363636363636363
