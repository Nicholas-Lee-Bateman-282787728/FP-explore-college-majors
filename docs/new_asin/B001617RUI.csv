8260647,5,B001617RUI,"I love everything Agatha Christie, especially with David Suchet playing Poirot, or practically anyone playing Miss Marple. Peter Ustinov is an acquired taste since he plays himself more than Poirot. However the five movies or TV movies he appeared in as Poirot have such beautiful production values (sets and costumes) and you get the added appearance of such actors as a young Bill Nighy in THIRTEEN AT DINNER that it is really worth watching. This film has a real treat in that David Suchet plays Inspector Japp, and not as well as the Japp in his own TV series. I think in his book, Suchet recalls that Ustinov told him he should be playing Poirot instead during this movie. Ustinov was right, but that does not take away from the entertainment value of Ustinov's work as Poirot.",1426982400,,782,4.7153284671532845

8260649,3,B001617RUI,"So, lately, I've been conducting a Hercule Poirot retrospective of sorts. Today I saw the 1985 film Thirteen At Dinner (based on the book of the same name). This is the fourth Poirot I have seen featuring Peter Ustinov as the Belgian detective. To many (myself included), David Suchet IS Poirot. Yet there is something Ustinov's Poirot has that Suchet's lacks: charm. Ustinov is funny and subtly charismatic - I can completely understand how the detective would be successful at interrogation. He does not always need to employ threats to receive his answers. A simple smile or an understanding observation can frequently invite the confidence of a suspect.

Thirteen at Dinner I rank as one of the better Ustinov Poirot films. The attempt to modernize the story-line was very well done. Usually an attempt to modernize appears hackneyed and awkward. Rod Browning's teleplay flows well, allowing for the retention of most of the original clues, and the direction achieves a sense of suspense in the final denouement. The supporting cast was good too, with a minor but important turn by Bill Nighy. Faye Dunaway is beautiful and effective in just about all her scenes; without her I do no think the picture would work, as she takes what could be very vapid lines and manages to make an effective character out of them. Also impressive is a much younger David Suchet as Inspector Japp.

There are a few shortcomings. Given Dunaway's acting abilities, I had hoped for more scenes with her. The movie was made for TV, so there are a few annoying breaks in the action for commercial slots. Hastings (played by Jonathan Cecil) is an almost invisible caricature of the devoted friend who documents the case. (This not Cecil's fault, who injects an element of dry English wit into the proceedings on occasion). And, finally, there are the usual problems I have found in translating Agatha Christie to the big screen. The largest issue is usually that her books follow the problems and events that occur when as many as a dozen people are in one locale for a period of time (nearly always involving murder). Many-threaded narratives such as these tend to be clumsy and fragmented when transferred to a visual medium. Happily, the resulting choppiness is minimized in Thirteen at Dinner. While a trifle long and slow, it is a quality production in which good acting takes the film much farther than the quality of its lines.",1315094400,,2414,4.871046228710462
8260650,5,B001617RUI,"This movie was not made or intended to be one of those beautiful epics with dazzling color and wide screen. It is a made for TV movie. It does follow the book closely. The few variations were probably due to time constraints in getting the information out. I have to admit I also was about to press the fast forward button. I do not think thy will ever try to put Poirot in the 80's again. What you missed was David Suchet playing Inspector Japp with the worst English accent I ever heard. So what is his real voice? And Faye Dunaway did not dominate every scene. The Colonel Hastings (Jonathan Cecil) was to pansy to be in any army I know. Still it had its moments; like when Hercule turned to Japp and said ""Get used to the fact that wherever you go, it is on our way."" And by the end of the movie you get over the initial shocks and can enjoy it for it's self.",1264809600,,863,4.112426035502959
