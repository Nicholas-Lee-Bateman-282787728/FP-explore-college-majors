8252071,1,B0013M0F7M,I didn't learn anything new in this video.  Nothing was in depth just basic guidelines which most people know. I have a less expensive book on wedding planning which gives so many details and didn't cost as much.,1217289600,,212,4.578947368421052
8252072,5,B0013M0F7M,"As a fellow wedding planner, I cannot imagine the task of managing my client base along with compiling this hugely informative accessory.
My knees virtually buckle at the thought of the research, experience, time, energy and heart that must have gone into constructing such a valuable tool and source of inspiration to both brides-to-be and wedding professionals alike!
I intend on sharing this with my client base as a ""supportive role"" and an engaging, informative and inspiring resource.  I would be remiss if I didn't have this in my personal library-",1207612800,,555,5.0989010989010985

I am a very busy lawyer and I hired Susan to plan plan our beautiful wedding at Jekyll Island, Georgia - she did such an incredible job! Planning can be torturous; but because of her organization, experience, and elegance, I didn't have a thing to worry about. Our wedding was on the Style Network, and my husband and I now have people approach us asking how they can reach Susan to plan their weddings. If you can't book her for your wedding, buy the DVD because it has her many tips for organization, color selection (ours was a hit with expresso and sage), vendor management, etiquette, budgeting, and everything you will need for your wedding!",1203984000,2,875,6.008
8252075,5,B0013M0F7M,"I was at the Perfect Wedding Guide event in Orlando and bought her DVD there (I just bought another to give to my cousin for her wedding). I met her and she's been planning for 15 years - she's been on the Whose Wedding is it Anyway Show from the Style Network. I am showing this to my friends, I am so excited! She has EVERYTHING on this dvd. It gave me ideas for my dress, wedding colors, vendor contracts, proper lighting and more. I am going to use the contracts as samples for how to deal with my vendors. I totally recommend this for your wedding planning - even if you have a planner!",1203984000,2,591,4.147826086956521
