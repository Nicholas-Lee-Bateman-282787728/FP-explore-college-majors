7671302,5,B01BZE7MNW,"Grimm is wonderful. Looking forward to watching season 5 again.  However, this particular edition of season 5 came without any information about what was on each disc!!!",1475366400,,169,5.2592592592592595
7671303,5,B01BZE7MNW,"It's hard not to love a show with a comely apothecary, and it's impossible not to love the new season of Grimm. I have been a season ticket holder for Grimm since day numero uno! I like Sci-Fi & Fantasy so this fits right in to my tastes. I even watch reruns; bingeing on my days off. For those who disparage this show, I say ""watch something The writing, production and character development are exceptional. Yeah, there may be some stretching of character identities throughout, but let's give the writers/produces a break to evolve the story. Not every episode will be great, but what show has that? To you in control: keep the story line flowing & growing. Don't forget the path of the river lest you run into a waterfall.",1475280000,,726,4.549618320610687
7671304,5,B01BZE7MNW,I love Grimm,1475107200,,12,3.3333333333333335
7671305,1,B01BZE7MNW,I wasn't happy receiving a new product and it froze at the beginning of the last episode and jumped half way through.  You would think buying it new it wouldn't be bad. But I hate to go though the trouble of sending it back. I'm not happy I just received it today,1475020800,10,263,4.0576923076923075
7671306,1,B01BZE7MNW,"Disk 1 and 5 would not play. It was made poorly with rough edges. Also you will hate how the disks go in the holder.
I got replacement today and disks 3 and 4 would not play.  I combined both together and got a full working set.",1475020800,16,228,3.851063829787234
7671307,1,B01BZE7MNW,"This review is clearly for the packaging itself and not for the actual show. The show is great and I highly recommend people watch it. Now the packaging for the fifth season is completely different from the other seasons and is listed as ""limited edition"" and well it SUCKS!!. As one user said, it is a shiny cardboard flip out with no numbers on the disc to let you know which is which and there are no inserts for what are on each disc or anything. This is the stupidest idea that anyone has ever had with releasing a blu ray set. There is a paper on the back that gives the description and special features but this doesn't even stay on, it just comes right off. IF you are true die hard fan, like myself, then you will probably get this but I would suggest maybe getting the DVD itself instead of the blu ray. I am hoping they will release the entire series in one set once the show is over and then I may buy it and just get rid of this piece of garbage.",1475020800,25,959,4.1063829787234045
7671308,1,B01BZE7MNW,"Pathetic packaging by Universal. Someone should think about the customers when they design the product. The discs are in a cardboad holder and several of them were loose when the package arrived. Also, they're marked by the print is so small you can hardly see it: disc 1, disc 2 etc. NO episode guide at all. No remarks anywhere as to what's on the discs. The series is good but the packaging is horrible! Beware - from now on I'll watch it on Netflix and not buy any further blu-rays!",1474934400,6,486,4.411111111111111
7671309,5,B01BZE7MNW,"I love the Grimm t.v show and had pre ordered this a month in advance. Jonsing for a good Grimm Marathon.

When this arrived today it arrived in pristine condition nothing chipped, scratched, or broken. Knowing these reviews are important to know about the products arrival and everything instead of what the show is about. I hope this will help out feature buyers.

7671347,4,B01BZE7MNW,"My family has enjoyed watching the popular Grimm series.  Personally, I feel that the series came to a very awkward, poorly-written and difficult-to-digest conclusion.  The series began to show signs of ""going south"" in Season Five, when it became apparent that producers had a hot series and were pulling out ""all of the stops"" so that they could milk that popularity as long as possible without regard to content. Therefore, Season Five (in my opinion) is the beginning of the end of a great series that still could have concluded successfully (like American Odyssey did), rather than rotting on the vine, as it eventually did in Season Six.  So, is Season Five worthwhile?  If you are a fan, then definitely it is worthwhile.  It will still be fun for you.",1507852800,,759,4.8076923076923075

7671349,5,B01BZE7MNW,"It certainly doesn't hurt to have two of the main characters bare a striking resemblance to Christopher Reeves and Julia Roberts. But it's the supporting cast which makes the series work exceptionally well, especially the characters of Reggie Lee as Sergeant Wu and Silas Weir Mitchell as Monroe. These characterizations are spot on with their humorous tongue-in-cheek dialog helping to maintain a light-hearted atmosphere and medium even in its darkest moments. The cinematography is also exceptional; the fade-in and fade-out sequences are harmonious and fluid as are the close-ups when interspersed with the long shots. Direction is at least on par with the Jesse Stone series.  Though, I cannot help but wonder if the exceptionally pretty girls take some perverse pleasure in seeing themselves transformed into hideous beasts.",1507075200,,830,5.484375

One of the things I enjoy most about Grimm is the cast, and the humor. Overall, Grimm deals with dark themes, but there's lots of comedic relief. The main character Nick develops close friendships with several strange and likable characters, who have become the protagonists in the series.

If you order Season 1 or Season 5 on Blu-ray, be sure to check if you're getting the standard plastic Blu-ray cases (which I prefer), or the crummy cardboard cases. The cardboard cases have more artwork, but are a hassle when removing/inserting the disks.",1484956800,5,807,4.970370370370371

I love the way they've done it all.  This last season did not disappoint, no sir.  I like the quality of the Blu-Ray packaging a bit more than previous seasons.  Very sleek.

I thought season 5 was  great!  Probably the most dark, twisted, and true to grimm.  Eve/Juliet episodes or the black claw episodes were the best imo.  WIsh in season 6 or later seaons( crosses fingers for more) they explain more about the stick or what i call ""Moses Staff on Crak"". Maybe  more into the magic universe or a mini grimm holy episode with more about the grim history.  Maybe next season we're see the Grimm Cave or where that underground tunnel leads to.....

Digital copy as usual has no problems redeeming and now able to watch on my phone or away from home.

Problems  (most are fixed and won't really be a big issue)

Some guys are reporting playback issues, package, disc label issues.  There is actually 2 versions of Season 5 bluray usa sets:  the first version is the one that came in a hard plastic case where the disc got easily damage, no paper or episode guide insert to tell us what disc has episode 1 etc, the 2nd version is the normal packaging for bluray season sets that most of us are use to seeing ( 5 discs spread across 2 trays, 1 disc on each side of the disc tray and the 5th disc on the package cover.  Luckily I waited till they changed the packaging back to the normal bluray case, and got it on black friday.  The 2nd problem was the disc label or a simple  ""DISC 1 writing on each disc was not changed.  This is not a big issue to me, but was it really hard or money costing to not put a decent label for 5 letters a big deal?  Unfortunately on the all editions (old packaging and new) the disc label was not changed at all.  We still have to play the disc to actually see what disc is what or if u want to do a retinal test feel free to stick each disc to your face and look for  season 5 disc 1.  Playback maybe check the bluray player settings, update the firmware, or buy a new bluray player.

Other than the label and playback issue for some guys there's really nothing wrong with the quality of the bluray.",1480204800,3,2114,4.19106699751861

7671610,4,B01BZE7MNW,"Grimm's appeal to me has been a balance of horror-lite and humour.  The fifth season is a little grimmer than usual.  Not totally my cup of tea, but not a radical change, either.

As usual, Grimm meanders through the season.  The writing is not sloppy, but the assumptions about the characters are.  If I were paid every time a character on a US TV series didn't ask a crucial question or reveal a necessary detail, or even question something that is obviously extremely important, I'd be rich.  The same applies to the characters on Grimm, who appear to have a reticence that is most un-American, and, indeed, not quite credible.  Any tension supposed to be created by making your characters have the logic process of a four-year-old is trumped by an overwhelming desire to throw something at the TV.  Minus 1 point for this.

As others have pointed out, the packaging is a little odd.  I found it easier to handle than the niggly one for Series 2, but agree that it is not really optimal.  Minus 0.5 point.

Leading to 3.5, rounded up to 4/5.  Will be sorry to purchase the next set when it comes out knowing that it will be the last.",1476057600,,1136,4.482926829268293

7671617,2,B01BZE7MNW,"Grimm used to be a guilty pleasure of mine. The plots have always been all over the place, the characters are frequently inconsistent, the show has a nasty habit of sweeping rape under the rug (gosh, Adalind had a lot of fun with every man on this show, often sleeping with them under magical compulsion, but it's fine because she's a hot blonde; they just got lucky that week), and I could always tell there was no plan in the writing room -- but it was fun. It was clever. It had occasional bouts of heart, and a few episodes and arcs made my month.

But this season is a hot mess. My excitement level hit zero somewhere around mid-season and never recovered. I actually wondered, at one point, if I was being too critical of the show in thinking it utterly dull, uninteresting, trite, and pathetic this season -- and then I got an e-mail from a friend who, without prompting, said, ""I think this is the worst season of anything I've ever seen on television. :P""

What's wrong with it?

Everything. The setting is incredibly bland. Nick, Adalind, and their spawn live in a boring bunker, which sucks the life out of the backdrop. At least the house provided some warmth. For some inexplicable reason I cannot explain, they wind up a couple -- gee, Nick got over all his ""Hexenbiests are eeeevil"" hangups pretty fast. (Basically, the writers make the characters act out of character to prop up whatever idea they're running with this week.) Renard turns up once in awhile to snarl, or sit behind a desk, but they waste him for most of the season. Trubel turns back up (yay!) ... and is blah, and now working for a secret government organization who has an even BIGGER secret in the wings (... yawn; if I wanted a secret agency, I'd rewatch ALIAS). The payoff with the keys the writers have been routinely forgetting about for five seasons is somewhat underwhelming. As usual, they explain nothing, clear up nothing from former seasons that is left dangling, and their new approach -- which was to try out an espionage plot, rather than the usual cop / Grimms working alone under the radar -- changed the entire show dynamic, and, for me, undermined all the original charm.

Monroe is fantastic. He always was, is, and will be until the very end. Unfortunately, I cannot think of a single case or episode that left much of an impression on me, other than the finale. But by then, I was so utterly over the entire season I could not rustle up much ability to care. I hope the final half-season finds its footing again. I'd hate to walk away with less than fond memories of a show that once gave me many amused hours.",1475539200,,2615,4.510548523206751
