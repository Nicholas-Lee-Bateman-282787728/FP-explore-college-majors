Graphics were poor indeed . Many times felt like calling to get my money back. Never did , learnt a lesson never to buy from Amazon again. If you are tempted to buy this product,make sure you are allowed to return it.  I did notice the DVD was made by a company that produces the DVD the container  back and front labels, all for 1.79 each , does that tell you anything?",1265328000,2,531,4.096153846153846
8541181,4,B0016ZSWB2,"This dvd, based on MovieStudio 8 Platinum, is not an alternative to the Bill Myers dvd with similar sounding title. The Bill Myers approach is to show how to do specific tasks; this dvd by Gordon White attempts to show what MovieStudio can do. It is almost like a video version of a book or manual, and in that respect it does a fairly good job. It would be most useful to people, like myself, who are new, or fairly new, to MovieStudio. To those experienced users, I would suggest that it is of little value, offering nothing that they did not already know.
Gordon White provides a good basic grounding in MovieStudio's facilities over the course of 50 short tutorials. My criticism, if any, would be that some tutorials are too short and do not go into sufficent detail. But maybe that is one of the limitations of trying to cover everything on a dvd. But I suppose that by introducing a topic or facility, and demonstrating the basics, this gives the user the confidence to subsequently play around with that facility and learn more from experience. Note that DVD Architect is not covered, and is the subject of another of Gordon White's dvd's.
Unlike the Bill Myers dvd, this one can be purchased in the UK, thus for UK residents the price is far more reasonable, not being subject to an extra 13 by Customs/Royal Mail!",1224547200,3,1323,4.563025210084033
