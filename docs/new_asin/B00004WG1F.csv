8324353,4,B00004WG1F,"B-17 and the Crews of the 100th Bomb Group. Pilot Dwight Chiles tells stories of incoming German FW190 and ME109 Fighters, how he could see their faces as they flew close. Dwight Chiles ended up in Stalag 1 after his heroic battle. Rosie Rosenthal talks of all his many missions. Buy this video for real history!",1135641600,3,312,4.589285714285714
8324354,4,B00004WG1F,"The only reason I could not give this video a 5 star rating is because of the misleading title.  There is very little mention of the Dresden mission and the video is more of a testament to the B-17 and the Crews of the 100th Bomb Group.  The never before seen  archival footage is brilliant and the interviews with 100th BG Veterans ( ie Harry Crosby,Group Navigator and Robert ""Rosie"" Rosenthal pilot and Squadron CO) tell of their harrowing missions and the repect they had for the ""Queen of the Skies"".  If you are looking for information on the B-17 and the Bomb Groups of the 8th Air  Force then this video is a ""Must Have"".",984960000,4,629,4.387931034482759
8324355,1,B00004WG1F,"In 52 minutes there was only one short 'by-the-way' reference to Dresden.  This video is all about the B-17, Flying Fortress, in the 100th Bomb Group and nothing about the Firestorm in Dresden.  The title is extremely misleading.
Since this video's only reference to Dresden was one sentence and a short clip of flames from the air, I rated this video as a one because they will not let me rate it a zero.  The title and content do not match.
