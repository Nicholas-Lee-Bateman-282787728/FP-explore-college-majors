8470275,5,B005FLWKXO,"I have watched four of these sessions so far. I had difficulty watching the first two, but the ones on acceptance and gratitude were just what I need to hear. According to Elisabeth, suffering is anything that is in your life that you wish was not, or anything that is not in your life, that you wish you had (I will have to watch again to get the exact quote).  This is so good, since we all tend to compare our suffering with others. The Scripture she shares and the way in which she shares it really comforted and challenged me. These sessions are two dollars each from Ligonier ministries, though their site may be down from this recent scandal (God have mercy on us all, he will be the final judge).",1442448000,,704,4.333333333333333
8470276,5,B005FLWKXO,"A wonderful and necessary series on suffering preferably read before one encounters suffering, as everyone will experience some suffering in this broken world.  It will help you understand suffering better and "" know the One who knows"" says Elisabeth Elliot. I encourage everyone to take a listen to what she has to say.",1414886400,,320,5.037735849056604
