He's moved on a lot since this was recorded and now has a new band and focus, but this is good to see especially for his fans.",1260057600,,264,3.9074074074074074
8003579,5,B0000V8HZ4,"I have seen Eric several times in concert, Big venues, the Lorlei in 86, and bars in Munich 70's and 80's and once in the United States (Osh Kosh Jun 2003).  The DVD gives the feel for the concerts, and if you have seen the master in the past two years you know eactly where you are in the concert.  Well worth getting for the hard core Eric Burden fan.  Now if I can find a complete copy of factory girl.",1071705600,8,405,3.9753086419753085
8003580,4,B0000V8HZ4,"For anyone who has ever wanted to tour with a band, and see the real backstage life, this DVD is for you. If you're an Eric Burdon fan, that makes this even better.
As the director states, this is not a concert DVD. Rather than experience Eric Burdon from a fan's point of view, you will experience their journey back to their roots as one of the insiders. I felt like I belonged backstage with the band as I watched this DVD. Watching Eric walk the streets of his hometown and reminisce about his memories there gave me a unique perspective into his life.
I also enjoyed watching the band's interaction when there was no audience to perform for. I got a chance to see what they were really like when no one else was around.
All in all, it was a wonderful, matchless experience. If you are an Eric Burdon fan, you must own this DVD.",1070064000,10,832,4.305732484076433
