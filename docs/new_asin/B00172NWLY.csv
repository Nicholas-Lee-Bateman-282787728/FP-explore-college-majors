8264765,4,B00172NWLY,"The DVD is a bit unorginized at best... You have to access apecial features on either side of the disc... The film was a disappointment in terms of casting choice for Dave Saville... Jason Lee always looked like he had a 5 O clock shadow. ""Uncle Ian"" Got off too easy in this outing.. He should have went to jail for kidnapping and neglect... The realistic look of the chipminks was one aspect that was close to what was on the early LPs from the 50s... The DVD does offer up some intereting facts on the voicing process... The dolls that come with this are adorable and soft.. Nice to display... Kudos go the the extras and to the dolls.. The movie was only so so for mw... The box discription has an error too.. It says that it is their first movie.. Not so... It is their first LIVE ACTION film... All in all a MUST for the serious collector...",1209340800,2,847,4.267080745341615
