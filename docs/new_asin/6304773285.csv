It's got Kenan and Kel, it's got Less Than Jake, it's got Sinbad, it's got Carmen Electra in an auspicious near-debut, and it's got Abe Vigoda at the peak of his abilities. It's also a product of Nickelodeon in their peak years. Good Burger is stupidly funny, but it's not stupid to the point where the audience loses interest. It has a surprisingly compelling story and a lot of energy to carry it to it's wild finale. It's about as guilty as guilty pleasures get, but for anyone who enjoyed the film as a child and wants to revisit it, it holds up shockingly well. P.S. Imagine if Spike Lee had directed Good Burger. It probably would have been hailed as his best film since Do The Right Thing.",1402358400,,751,4.371428571428571

The DVD main menu is just the same picture that is on the DVD cover with three options, Play, Set Up and Scene Selection. No music, nothing but a picture. All the menus are like this. You would just be better off buying a digital download instead of buying this DVD because there's nothing on it but a movie and some ghetto-ass menus.

Kel's character is hysterical.

It's a silly plot, and a lot of the acting is atrocious.  But, for a family film, I find it quite enjoyable.  It's a classic 90s Nickelodeon flick, based on a recurring sketch from All That.

I was a huge fan as a kid and love it more now as an adult because it reminds me that humor need not be vulgar, crude, or offensive to entertain.  I am a huge fan of the old Nicoleadan and love this movie as a piece of my childhood.

One of my favorite scenes is where the guy comes into Good Burger and says ""give me a good burger"" and Ed replies ""Dude, I can't just give you a good burger, you have to pay for it"".  LOL!!!!  Also in the mental hospital where they play that terrible music and George Clinton turns to Ed and says, ""this music sucks"".  LOL hilarious.

I don't know why this movie is so funny, but it is great and has become a cult classic for good reason.

If you love to laugh, get this movie, it's a sure thing!

PS- the George Clinton dance scene is totally freaking awesome and it reminds me of the zombie dance scene from the MJ Thriller vidoe, very cool!",1315872000,,1080,4.0046728971962615

I'm happy--deliriously happy, I might add--to say that this movie did not disappoint.  I even showed it to my niece the next time she was over our house for a visit, and she and I laughed throughout the whole movie.  Kids' movies aren't like this anymore; if anything, the kids are smart-mouthed, irreverent, and disrespectful.

928142,5,6304773285,"Based on The Popular Skit on Nickelodeon's ''All That'', ''Good Burger'' Follows The Histarical Adventures of Friends Dexter and Ed, Who Work at The Famous Fast-Food Restruant, Good Burger. One Day, a Brand New Fast-Food Restruant, Mondo Burger, Opens Across The Street of Good Burger, in which is Trying To Put Good Burger Out of Buisness. Shortly After Figuring Out Mondo Burger Makes Thier Big Burger Meat Patties Out of Ileagal Supstences, Dexter and Ed Start Out on a Mission To Prove Mondo Burger Guilty as Charged.

Though I Haven't Seen Much of the ''Good Burger'' Skit on Nickelodeon's Show ''All That'', But I Can Tell You, GOOD BURGER The Movie is One of The Best Kids Films Ever Made, and Not Only is it Funny For Kids, it's Funny For Teens and Adults if Thay Happen To Be Caught in The Right Mood To Watch Such A Film. Nickelodeon's Films That Are Based on Thier Shows/Skits, Thay Don't Live Up To What Thier Show/Skit Was, or Sometimes It's Just Not Good at All, But ''Good Burger'' Lives Up To Fans of The Skit. Kenan Thompson, Kel Mitchell and Everybody Who Were in This Film, Played Them Great and Histracally Funny. It's So Hard Finding a Good Kids Film That Doesn't Show any Thing So Violent, or Sexual (Even Though GOOD BURGER Gets it's PG Rating For Some Sex-Related Humor), or Language So Mild and Mean You Would Turn off Your TV or Walking Out of The Theater. GOOD BURGER is Nice, Good Fun For The Family. I Highly Recommend Everyone Watches GOOD BURGER.

928143,4,6304773285,"There are fewer and fewer movies that can be watched by the entire family today.  It seems so many are filled with foul language, too much violence for the eyes to watch, or nudity that is usually uncalled for.  I hate to think what watching this R-rated junk does for our psyche.  On the other hand, we can watch the G-rated animations that seem to be the other end of the movie-watching spectrum.  Teenagers tend to think they are past watching these seemingly childish forms of entertainment, even though a lot of times the humor is directed at a more adult audience. Good Burger is funny, entertaining, and can be enjoyed by the entire family again and again!",1241049600,,663,4.593220338983051

Kenan & Kel do an awesome job and are the perfect partners. Mondo Burger is opening right across the street from Good Burger. It literally puts Good Burger out of business. When Dexter tastes Ed's sauce for burgers, they open to the public, and they get the customers back. Soon, the manager at Mondo Burger named Kurt tries to steal Ed's recipe. Soon, they poison the sauce and send Ed and Dexter, and Otis to Demented Hills. They have until 10:00 in the morning to stop everyone from eating a Good Burger. Will they stop them in time and stop Mondo Burger? I highly recommend GOOD BURGER!!!",1228521600,,721,4.2700729927007295

Kenan and Kel never grow old on you. I have watched this movie so many times I've lost count.

928236,5,6304773285,"When I took my kids to see this in the theater, it was pretty empty.  And I'm sure I was the only one really laughing throughout.  That's when I got that Good Burger was made more for people my age than theirs.  As they've gotten older, they've come to appreciate it more.

I know it was an expansion of an All That skit, but it had one big difference.  On All That, the Good Burger skit was mostly about Ed, played by Kel Mitchell, and his goofy talk and attitude.  This movie also had Kenan Thompson, as Dexter.  That made all the difference, because Dexter actually had a story.  Ed is funny, innocent, and what not, but he didn't bring the story by himself.

So, I'm watching this movie, wondering how Dexter's going to get out of his problem, when everyone somehow ends up in a mental institution.  And who's in the middle of the scene, but George Clinton, turning the dial on the radio to Knee Deep--one of my favorite songs of all time!  And when Kel leads the room in a rendition of the Thriller dance, I knew I'd found one of my new favorite movies.

Kenan and Kel, George Clinton, Sinbad as a tacky, over-the-top 70s jive talking teacher--this movie was hilarious!  And it's definitely one of the 7 happiest black movies of all time.",1192320000,,1243,4.399122807017544

But why? There are so many ridiculous puns. There is nothing on this blue and green Earth that I like more than puns and this movie provides them either intentionally or unintentionally. SAUCE!!! etc... I cab;t think of many of them now because I am still chuckling from the after-effects of this deleightful film.

It is just absurd beyond comparison, well every single film about teenagers with a PG rating would be, but unlike many other films, the toned down language and situations of this film provide it with additional pun fodder and additional charm. The formulaic story and the formulaic characters are all groovy with me.

I am not even high or drunk, but this movie intoxicates me with a bizarre laughter. Kenan and Kel have made me happy today. BRILLIANT!",1176854400,17,1001,4.581005586592179

As you can probably guess, one restaurant has a bunch of jerks working there, determined to close down the restaurant across the street.  Meanwhile, the other burger place has well-meaning, though not necessarily the most intelligent bunch of employees working there (these are the GOOD guys).

Sure, there slapstick style comedy works well on Nickelodeon but that's television.  A half hour of funny on the T.V. screen can turn into 95 minutes of pure stupidity and torture when stretched into a full length motion picture if it's not done correctly.

Believe it or not, `Good Burger' was done absolutely to perfection (pun intended). Kenan and Kel star as Dexter and Ed, two high school kids working at the local fast-food restaurant known as, Good Burger. Yes, the movie contains loads of the over-the-top physical comedy the two are known for, but it also boasts a very inventive, well thought out script containing lots of quotable lines, a strong storyline and a great supporting cast that keeps your interest peaked from beginning to end.

The only reason I wrote it was because people were bashing it, they were saying it was horrible and stupid, but it isn't.  Thats how I feel about this movie.  ""Good Burger"" is not just a good movie, it's a great movie.  Two very funny guys, Keenan Thompson and Kel Mithchell, star in this movie about a small burger place that gets some tough competition and stands up to it and its also about a kid who needs to make some money and does it in all the wrong ways.  I first saw this movie when I was about 11 years old and I still enjoy watching it whenever I can, even though I'm seventeen.  the best part of this movie in my mind is all of it, it's funny, has action, and it tells a story about doing the right thing no matter what.  I also want to say one more thing, this goes out to all the adults who review kid movies like this,  it doesn't matter what you think because your not the ones who matter when it comes to these movies.  There made to appeal to kids.  Kids have more imagination, and in my mind, have better taste in anything.  I should know, I was and always will be a kid.",1111708800,,1158,4.035087719298246

Yes, the film has a likeable character with the intelligence of a cucumber and a genuine innocence that endears him to all.

The story of Ed (Kel Mitchell) and Dexter (Kenan Thompson) and how they rescue the Good Burger restaurant from destruction at the hands of the domineering Mondo Burger is more than just the story of warriors battling the onslaught of corporate tyranny; it is a metaphor for the transcendence of the human spirit. Like our Homeric heroes Ed and Dexter, each of us must struggle to find a place in the universe -- only then can we truly be free.
Not since Henry Fonda won for ""On Golden Pond,"" has an actor nearing death deserved a nomination more than Abe Vigoda. His portrait of proud Otis, the aging fast food employee, is both complex and compelling -- and a powerful comment on the plight of geriatrics everywhere.

928494,5,6304773285,"I am outraged that this movie was passed up for an Academy Award.  Instead movies like Titanic, and Braveheart are snatching the Oscars like butter, and movies like Good Burger and The Power Rangers are left in the dust.  Not since Lucielle Ball have I seen comedy like these two young actors,  Kenan and Kel.  They're the Abbott and Costello of the 90's.  When I saw  this movie, I laughed and cried.  The emotional roller coaster Good Burger  takes you on is rivaled only by The Green Mile.  I can't say enough good  things about this masterpiece on film.  If you could frame a movie and put  it next to the Mona Lisa this would be the one.  Don't let this gem of a  film escape your clutches.  BUY IT NOW!",948412800,3,708,4.297709923664122
928495,5,6304773285,Good Burger is great movie. Kel and Kenan are a very good together. Kel most havea hard time acting weird in this movie. I like the part when Kenan IS DRIVING HIS MOM'S NICE CAR.A great movie to rent and buy.,937008000,,208,4.097560975609756
