What a funny, dead-on movie...a hilarious shot of dark humor runs through it, without the  utter blackness of Very Bad Things.",930096000,,255,4.543478260869565

1039863,5,6305492247,"Not a fan of violent films, but this is more about the humor than the violence. And it is very, very funny. This is definitely a favorite.",1505865600,,138,4.148148148148148
1039864,4,6305492247,"The British have a relationship with violence in film that is similar to the relationship that Hollywood has with sex. It's glorified, hidden, teased at, and shown in measured ways.

This is one of my favorites of that sort of film.",1505606400,,232,4.658536585365853
1039866,5,6305492247,"I came to this after a friend showed me the later film 'Snatch.' It hits similar notes, and has the same satisfying mix of humor, complexity, and over-the-top violence. While I enjoyed Snatch a bit more as an overall experience, this movie is right up there with my favorites. The last 30 minutes or so in particular really turn up the intensity (and enjoyment), and the characters sum it up perfectly when they ask, ""What the f*** is going on?""",1503792000,,445,4.575

1040030,4,6305492247,"Guy Richie you get a four in this because you put Lucky Star by Madonna in the movie. The worst part of the soundtrack (worth getting ,you can skip that song). Guy Richie makes good movies. From these earlier on..and later Author. This great stand alone movie..basic theme about card playing and stealing money. If you haven't seen this..it isn't like the American Counter Part. You know the ones..like that movie with Tim Roth (good actor) gets out of jail and is forced back into the mob to steal again. Your talking about low level Scammers that gets mixed in the big Dog Club and has to pay there dues. There is lots of thought into the script to the movie. It is meant to be something with substance and can watch over and over. Don't you get tired of movies you buy, see a few times and like ""why did I buy this?"". maybe I sell it at a yard sale. I didn't feel this way about this movie. This Guy Richie show a little T&A in this..and the main thug works at a porn shop..that adds a great comedy line..that once you see it your like, that is oddly funny! This isn't a graphic movie in that end as a note..just a small fraction.",1489968000,,1133,4.25

1040665,4,6305492247,"This was an enormously entertaining comic caper film that I have to say was completely unexpected.  With a cast of skilled British comic actors, most of whom are comparatively obscure, what I was treated to was something reminiscent of Pulp Fiction or Get Shorty in its feel and deft touch.  This is a story of a complex network of inept violent buffoons from a tier of crime in the UK that is not usually celebrated on film.

Jason Statham is probably the best known performer and was, as usual, very good in his role.  Sting has a small part in which he certainly chews the scenery but aside from that this is a large ensemble cast.  At the beginning it is a little tough to figure out which criminal goes with which group of criminals but in the end they are hilariously interconnected.

Don't watch this expecting great drama or even particularly surprising plot twists.  It is just fun to watch such boobs bumble their way through their criminal activities.  Even the amazing amount of violence and death seems undisturbing as it is cartoonlike in the manner of a Tarantino film.  Just sit down expecting a really good laugh and a film that will keep your attention throughout.",1458000000,,1182,4.644230769230769

It is unexpected from the beginning to the end. And, oh the end......  Watch for Sting as the bar owner. Superb acting. A movie I enjoyed and still has me a bit perplexed. A good one to watch again.

1042227,5,6305492247,"This is just a fun film with a lot of layers.  It is at its core a heist movie, with several interested parties vying for the prize.  It's a little violent, and a little mean spirited, but altogether just a ton of fun.

This put Guy Ritchie on the map, and introduced Jason Statham to a larger audience.  And while both men had bumps in the road career wise, be it a poorly realized vanity project, or styling emerging career doing a series of altogether similar action films, this film catches both of them at a great time.

The story is fairly grounded.  A group of guys hard on their luck, who continually get in over their heads, happens upon an easy score.  Of course, there's multiple other parties interested in this same score.  Which they may not even realize.  And the multiple layers and characters at play during the bulk of the caper give it a really interesting set of stakes.

Dialogue, although it might be hard to interpret to western audiences, is also really good.  It lends an authentic and gritty feel to the characters.  It also gets pretty jokey at times.

This is not a terribly serious film.  There are serious moments, but this is much more of a comedy than a drama.  The actual drama is honestly incidental.  This is a mostly light hearted affair.

And it works.  The characters, the plot, and the overall direction are just wonderful.  It made Guy Ritchie the new hotness in the movie industry when it came out.  He also managed to deliver very well on his next film, Snatch, which is one I also recommend for similar reasons to this film.

All in all, fun is the one word I would use to describe this movie to someone who has heard nothing about it.  And there's even a bit of depth to it too, so it's not just a dumb comedy action movie either.  And if this sounds like something you'd want to see, then you've really got no reason not to see it.",1453593600,2,1876,4.373913043478261

While this movie put Guy Ritchie on the map, it is not better than Pulp Fiction. The low budget hindered some of its scenes and the lighting was way off in certain scenes (Remember The Scene With Bren Gun?).

Despite this, I enjoyed the basic tenor of this movie. I liked the characters and felt the story more or less went well. Had the movie been awarded a bigger budget it would have looked, sounded and gone better. However, as this was one of Ritchie's first films, this can be understood.

I did have a few problems with the plot's culmination. There were too many characters and too many angles being played conterminously throughout the film. In the end this culminated with virtually all of the characters being slain. I did not like this nor did I find it to be realistic.

Cons: Too British, predictable, nasty language

I say Get it, and if you get it, you'll get it. As a disclaimer, I should point out this movie is not for everyone, it has a pile of nasty language, a small amount of gratuitous nudity, and a bit (although not to graphic) of violence. Also, if you don't like Monty Python or movies like Pulp Fiction, you won't like this movie. However, if you pass those litmus tests, you are in for a great ride. The story of how poor communication and crime leads to the downfall of virtually everyone, this clever action comedy has a great story, some great one liners, and characterization that deserves high accolades. Although at the end of the movie you get the point and it is a bit predictable, there is always another surprise waiting for you, and even guessing the plot outcomes is part of the fun. Putting all the pieces together gives one as much enjoyment as watching them unfold (usually with a twist) in this film. Definitely worth a rent, check it out.

1043014,4,6305492247,"I think I may have tried to watch this once before with little to no interest and obviously did not finish it. But after reading how Jason Statham used to do the con artistry featured in the beginning of the movie for real on the streets of London and other gossip about his start in movies, and seeing that the latest Sherlock Holmes incarnation with Robert Downey Jr. had been directed by Guy Ritchie, the same guy who directed here, I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised.

Ritchie, also the writer, has a wicked sense of humor. This is black humor because not everybody gets what he wants in this movie, although he may get what he deserves. But what is amazing is the jigsaw puzzle effect of how things come together, which seems to be a hallmark of all of Ritchie's original works ... it's probably what made Holmes a natural for him. Fun evening of entertainment socked in with your faves and a big bowl of popcorn. Oh, violence and profanity maybe not so good for children.

1043016,5,6305492247,"""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a British crime-fiction film and is a breakout offering by Director Guy Ritchie.

The narrative is cleverly constructed and whilst groups of protagonists at first appear to standalone their interaction creates a fantastic series of events.

The film contains a terrific cast and many of whom have become very well known since this work such as: Jason Flemyng (as Tom), Dexter Fletcher (plays Soap), Nick Moran (is Eddy), and Jason Statham (plays Bacon).

It is quite a treat for viewers as the diversity of the story with its many turns and twists is absorbing entertainment.

1043101,5,6305492247,"Fast-paced, twisted, British crime comedy with enough guns to keep Americans happy and enough irony to keep Canadians engaged.  Yes, you do have to pay attention throughout because conspiracies collide, and the cast of characters keeps expanding even as the plot picks up speed.

Plus, just as you say to yourself, ""They may be speaking English but I need subtitles,"" you get subtitles.  So reading's required.

But the payoffs are many.  Having Sting play the father, for instance.  He's exactly the kind of father Ward Cleaver would have been if the Beev had been a card shark hanging out with a couple of oafish grifters and a knife-crazed chef, especially if the Beev and his buddies had tried to get out of serious trouble by committing serious crimes against serious criminals in a gritty little patch of London so inbred that the criminal-in-chief knows whose father to whack to death with a sex toy if you do something stupid.

Then there's the rollicking soundtrack.

And golden examples of how optimism inspires crime.  Pessimists just stay home because, y'know, things are only going to get worse no matter what.  Every single criminal in this film is an optimist (and by the end of it, there must be at least 15 optimists trying to kill each other under the naive misimpression that life can get better if you just try harder).

1043107,4,6305492247,"I'd like to start off saying that Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is the film that convinced me to watch the films of Guy Ritchie and is still by far my favorite.  Unfortunately, the Director's Cut is a bit cluttered for me to enjoy it to the greatest degree.
Now, the changes are not deal breakers in any way, and for someone new to the film perhaps even welcome.  However, in my opinion all the changes serve one of two purposes: changing the pace and clarifying the story.
In the case of the first, these edits, however small, almost always serve the purpose of slowing the film down and calming the overall tone of the film.  The original is incredibly fast paced, with solid characters and an almost manic pace.  Sure there are some moments to breathe and the first two acts of the film remain fairly calm, they're still extremely tight, showing to the second what we must see, shortchanging nothing, and moving on.  The 13 extra minutes in the directors' cut just seem to fall down in the middle of this and hang the movie for a minute or two in about a dozen places.
As far as clarity: The movie is confusing.  Maybe it's the thick accents, maybe it's the aforementioned tight editing, maybe it's because they don't simply spell every letter of what's going on out to you.  However, for me, the confusion was the joy in seeing the movie, I was sure I had all the basic details the first time I viewed it, but small twists and turns of the narrative were lost in the blur of the constant mayhem and double/triple crosses.  It only helped convey the right tone for the film as you're left in awe of the final 20 minutes or so.  Maybe other people would prefer it spelled out but I just thought the scenes for clarification only helped ""dumb"" down the experience.

Either way, if you haven't seen the movie I still recommend seeing it in its original form, if you're a big fan, I'd recommend seeing this to find out the difference.  I personally was not on board with Guy Ritchie's alterations to the film and maybe even suspect they weren't entirely his, but that's another discussion.",1296259200,,2094,4.484210526315789

1043197,3,6305492247,"K, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS was Guy Ritche's first major film, using a fairly small budget and a cast of unknowns to create an epic dramatic arc. Four young fellows in London find themselves half a million in debt after the card shark of the bunch loses a rigged poker game. Their own conundrum turns out to fit into a wider pattern of underworld antics, ranging from a crime lord's theft of antique rifles to the pot growing operation of three stoners. The amusing criminal personalities Ritchie came up with, from enforcer ""Barry the Baptist"" to debt-collector Big Chris (who bring his little son along on his rounds) are some of the most memorable film characters around.

Ritche's next film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snatch/dp/B000093FLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snatch</a>&nbsp;wove the same sort of grandiose story out of disparate criminal strands, with a bigger budget and some Hollywood actors, though still employing Jason Statham and some East End legends.

At the time of its release, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was billed as ""the British `Pulp Fiction'"", but that is a poor description of this film, and in fact, does it a disservice. Although both films are humourous crime/gangster films, ""Lock, Stock..."" is quite different in both style and content from ""Pulp Fiction"". These differences led to me being somewhat disappointed when I first saw ""Lock, Stock..."" (I expected to see ""Pulp Fiction"" and that's not what I got), but rewatching it 10 years later, I now realize what an incredibly good film, in its own right, ""Lock, Stock..."" truly is. In fact, it is now my favourite of the two. Guy Richie's script beautifully sets up a wide array of comical criminals, each with their own unique story and personality, and then pays off these set ups in one of the most audacious endings of all time.

""Lock, Stock..."" was the film debut of both Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones. Although present in about 75% of all scenes, Statham barely says anything and his character seems a far cry from Frank Martin of ""The Transporter"", the character which made him famous. Jones, on the other hand, plays the same thuggish character that he has played in every movie he has appeared in since and is the stand-out actor of the entire film.

Finally, viewers who like this film should also see the Australian movie ""Two Hands"" (an early Heath Ledger film). Unlike ""Pulp Fiction"", this film is very similar in style and content to ""Lock, Stock..."" and fans of one are almost certain to also be fans of the other.",1234396800,,1756,4.658064516129032
1043199,4,6305492247,"The Bottom Line:

American audiences may have trouble with the thick accents, but this movie is a treat; though I think it's a little less accomplished than Snatch, it's still clever and funny (with a great ending) and showcases Ritchie at the top of his form.",1232323200,,260,4.6521739130434785

1043281,5,6305492247,"Okay, so my title is taken from a movie that has no relation whatsoever to this British gem (`Paris When is Sizzles') but it was that movie that really explains well why this movie is so amazing.  In `Paris When is Sizzles', Hepburn and Holden are constantly talking about the importance of the switch in filmmaking, that is a plot twist that catches the audience off guard and captures the attention.  They go back and forth about switches on switches on switches.  `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' has switches in spades.  Yes, if any movie can captivate you with its numerous plot shifts and character developments, it is this wildly entertaining British masterpiece.

The film follows four friends, Tom, Soap, Eddie and Bacon, as they attempt to get themselves out of the seriously deep whole they've dug for themselves.  You see, they owe a large sum of money to some very dangerous people and it seems that no matter how much progress they make there is always yet another snag for them to overcome.  Yes, to list all the characters and their involvement in this crime thriller would be pointless for not only would it take far too long but it would ultimately take away from the end result of the film (thus your enjoyment) and so technically all I want to say about the plot is what I have said; namely that these four men owe one man a lot of money.

And thus begins this very thrilling rollercoaster ride.

Guy Ritchie (more famous for his iconic bride than anything else) really should be more famous by now.  I've seen a few of his films, this being the best I think, but his style is very impressive all the way around.  He has a sort of cult status at this point, but honestly, he should be much more successful than he is.  The way he perfectly constructs this film is just brilliant, delivering a non-stop thrill ride that can wage battle with the best of Tarantino.

Yes, `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is Tarantino good.

The acting is impressive across the board; Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran and Jason Stathum delivering solid performances as the four men in question.  But it's not only these four stars that deliver.  Everyone involved is fully invested and wholly convincing in their respective roles (Vinnie Jones and Vas Blackwood are major standouts).  It's these performances that elevate the film even higher than the magnificent script and brilliant directing already take it.

In the end I must say that `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is a definite must see; one of the greatest films of 1998 and a true eye opener at that.  It is funny, exciting, thrilling and from start to finish it is nothing short of entertaining.  Guy Ritchie has continued to produce this very same breed of British gangster film, but I'm not sure that any have really reached the level of perfection that this film has achieved (I admit to not having seen all of Ritchie's work, although I must say that everything I have seen has visually been stunning).

For those who've seen 'Snatch' (many of us have been riveted to the screen for multiple viewings), this earlier release is as satisfying as a mountain of buttery mashed-potatoes at Thanksgiving.  Ritchie cleverly uses some of the same talented actors (in completely different roles) to prepare this buffet of violence and brilliant acting.  Multiple precarious and fast-paced scenarios inevitably run head-on at eachother as if drawn by the power of giant magnet.  Upon meeting in a clash, the chaos and irony is unmatched.  Action and violence are pushed to the limits and those left standing are our heroes...yes, even the bad guys.  For lovers of action films, this movie should be in your library.

The boys attempt to raise the money and the world in the form of various crooks and ganja dealers tries to take it from them.
the dialog is crisp and ironic. unfortunately, it's masked by the unfortunate tendency of the english to speak, well, english and the wise american viewer will take advantage of the subtitles which appear in unmistakable english-i mean, american.
this variant on the classic caper movie depends on almost every single character being to vile to be tolerated. the denouement is a jolly cathartic bloodbath in which hardly anyone is left standing.

1043289,4,6305492247,"Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels still remains as Guy Ritchie's best accomplishment. There is no shortage of humor to be found in this twisted tale of cunning, bafoonery and highly coincidental plot twists. Guy Ritchie manages to weave multiple characters through seemingly implausible plot twists (much like Snatch) and still manages to edge-out a story that isn't far from believable. The style of film is rather dull  but it has a quality to it that sets it apart from it's descendant ""Snatch"" which is no better or worst in terms of camera and lighting when compared to most mainstream films. The dull facade of Lock, Stock gives the film a less mainstream but more authentic (local) look. It feels more like London than Snatch does.

The dialogue is both witty and smart and all the main characters are funny. The movie has a great ending that leaves you well satisfied,not craving for more. Lock, Stock doesn't get as much praise as Snatch does but Snatch made no great leaps and bounds over Lock Stock either. In fact, you could call it Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels 1.2. Not to say that it's a bad film but It doesn't get better on subsequent viewings as LOCK does. The characters in LOCK are way more like able and far more interesting and even if one were missing it would still make a great film.

Back to Lock: it is still Ritchie's best film and the reason why many first sighted him as the english Tarantino. Certainly not as good as Tarentino (not nearly as good actually) but perhaps very promising. If Lock Stock and Snatch are any indication, Guy Ritchie has the potential to be a great films.

What an assortment of creeps and misfits. Some sport unforgettable mugs, while others are entirely forgettable but totally necessary to the plot, which features the goings-on of a bunch of nobodies. The dialog is at times incomprehensible to Americans, but nobody says anything worth hearing; it's all in the action: guns, guns, guns. This should be required viewing for those Masterpiece Theatre buffs; in fact I would recommend selling this in a boxed-set with ""Sense and Sensibility.""

I won't belabor the plot--four Cockney lads get into trouble when they think they can win a high-stakes card game and turn out to be 'out-sharked' when the game is rigged. Harry, who is not to be messed with, lends them the half a million to get them out of the spot they're in, but they've got to pay it back--in a week, or Harry is going to forfeit body parts from each of them.  So--they get involved deeper in crime and drugs and introduce us to a cast of characters from London's seedy underbelly that are both fascinating and frightening at the same time.

I avoided this film because of the ""Pulp Fiction"" comparisons, but ""Lock"" was much easier to watch and for me, much more entertaining.  I'll probably go find ""Snatch"" just to see if I like it near as well.

Watching it again recently on The Sundance Channel, it's really a vain, shallow film, with very predictable dialogue that sounds Tarantinoesque, except with Cockney accents.

1043387,4,6305492247,"Looking back on ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels,"" it's not hard to see why Director Guy Ritchie became one of the hottest directors around. It's a rollicking joyride of a film that delivers non-stop action, head-spinning plot twists and plenty of laughs.

The movie centers around four young punks who chip in some money so Eddy (Nick Moran), the master card player of the group, can enter a high-stakes card game with Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarity), a local gang boss whose specialties include gambling and porn. Unfortunately for Eddy, he's in way over his head, and ends up owing Harry a cool 500,000 pounds. His penalty if he doesn't come up with the money in a week? Having his fingers cut off one by one by Harry's mammoth enforcer, Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean).

Eddy and his friends Soap, Tom and Bacon are understandably distraught at this turn of events. As they rack their brains to come up with a plan to scratch together the money, they overhear their neighbors discussing plans to rob a wealthy group of drug dealers. A plan is quickly hatched to ambush the theives and steal the drug money that they stole. And did I mention that a seemingly unrelated pair of antique shotguns manages to work its way into the picture?

Needless to say, when Eddy & Co. put their plan into action, glorious mayhem ensues. The cast, which includes European soccer star Vinnie Jones as Harry's collector Big Chris, is a likeable bunch all around. But the film's real star is director Ritchie, who pulls out all the stops to command our attention, from freeze frames to slo-mo to speed-up and everything in between.

Naysayers call the plot ridiculous and lament the film's lack of substance. Come to think of it, the police do seem conspicuously absent considering all the gunplay, drug dealing and theivery that's going on. And even diehard fans of ""Lock"" will likely admit that it's ultimately a triumph of attitude & style over substance.

In spite of its shortcomings, though, ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" feels blisteringly alive from start to finish, a thrilling rollercoaster of a movie that's well worth the price of admission.",1180137600,,2145,4.817934782608695
1043388,5,6305492247,"Director Guy Ritchie expertly concocted an amusing crime thriller replete with crosses and double crosses among various criminal groups in London's underworld.  The plot surrounds a group of 4 low level criminals played by Jason Statham, Nick Moran, Jason Flemyng and Dexter Fletcher who pool their resources to sit in at a high stakes card game with a 100,000 pound admission. Nick Moran playing Eddie is a card shark but the game run by porn king Harry ""Hatchet"" Lonsdale played by P.J. Moriarty is fixed.  He loses the 100,000 and an aditional 500,000 which must be paid within a week or else.

The band of 4 friends contrive to recoup the stolen funds by ripping off a marijuana growing cartel that conveniently live next door.  That group had already been targeted by other group of robbers and things as a result get predictably muddled.

Meanwhile The ""Hatchet"" has commissioned the theft of a pair of antique shotguns worth a small fortune that bizarrely wind up in the hands of Moran and his friends.  The various groups begin exchanging both the money and the shotguns among them leaving behind a trail of bloodied corpses in this farcical romp.

Ritchie concludes this well contrived comedic thriller, which includes a plethora of tough looking British thugs, with a touch of irony that effectively caps this winning film.",1176595200,2,1333,4.924107142857143

1043392,4,6305492247,"A friend of mine suggested that I watch 1998's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels...""It's the British version of Pulp Fiction,"" he proclaimed.

There is the similarity that characters unaware of each other's presence are ultimately all connected by the closing credits in both Pulp Fiction (1994) and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. There is a lot of shooting. But otherwise, there were not a lot of plot similarities. And Pulp Fiction is much more of a violence R-rated film than the mainly language R-rating slapped on Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.

So, I'm glad that my friend recommended Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to me, but I'd mostly disagree about his summation of the film. This movie absolutely stands on it's own as a good, suspenseful action flick with some terrific twists. It's funny when it wants to be. It's serious. It's thrilling...a thoroughly enjoyable movie from the late 90s.

I don't know why I'd never taken the time before yesterday to watch Director Guy Ritchie's story of 4 guys that get themselves in deep with a local kingpin. But I can tell you that Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was sure good enough to have me add Ritchie's 2000 follow-on Snatch (aka Lock, Stock and Six Stolen Diamonds) to my Ready-to-View queue; I understand that several of the actors are back, but all playing unrelated characters along side Brad Pitt. But that's another review entirely.

Check out Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.",1170806400,,1468,4.883534136546185
1043393,5,6305492247,"I've owned Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) on DVD for a few years now and I've watched it about three or four times so far mainly due to the fact it's extremely entertaining and engaging, but also because it's one of those films that actually gets a little better each time it's viewed, in my opinion.  Written and directed by Guy Ritchie (Snatch, Swept Away), the film features Jason Flemyng (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen), Dexter Fletcher (Tristan + Isolde), Nick Moran (The Rules of Engagement), and Jason Statham (Snatch, The Transporter, Crank), in his first, feature film.  Also appearing is P.H. Moriarty (Jaws 3-D), Vinnie Jones (Snatch), Lenny McLean (The Fifth Element), Frank Harper (Bend It Like Beckham), Steven Mackintosh (Underworld: Evolution), Nicholas Rowe (Young Sherlock Holmes), Stephen Marcus (Quills), Vas Blackwood (Mean Machine), and Sting (Dune) aka Gordon Sumner, former frontman of the band The Police.

The story, set in London's seedy East End, involves four friends named Eddie (Moran), Bacon (Statham), Tom (Flemyng), and Soap (Fletcher) who find themselves in deep with a local criminal boss after Eddie loses big during a poker game.  Here's the deal...a scary fellow named 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale (Moriarty), who operates an adult novelty shop as a front, has a running card game, one in which the buy in is 100 thousand pounds.  Seems Eddie's specialty is not so much in cards, but the ability to read his opponents, so Eddie and his friends come up with the dough in the hopes of turning around a quick profit.  Thing is, Harry cheats, so subsequently Eddie loses, and loses big, to the point where he's a half million in the hole to Harry.  Harry knows Eddie's buy in money came from a collective pool, so he now holds them all responsible for the debt, and has given them approximately a week to pony up, or else he'll have his collector, a seriously scary individual named Big Chris (Jones), come around to start removing body parts.  The situation seems bleak but hope does arrive in the form of a plan, one in which involves Eddie and his friends putting it to Eddie's neighbor, a man named Dog (Harper), who, along with his crew, are planning to rip off a group of local weed dealers.  As the various plans come together (along with various comical complications tied to each), Eddie and crew successfully heist Dog's score, but even more complications arise as various players get involved, resulting in an extraordinary amount twists and turns, so much so you just may need a scorecard to keep track of all the action...

One should know I barely scratched the surface of the story above, as there's a great many interesting characters running about this film, along with a large number of varied plot elements which don't seem all that related at first, but eventually do tie together well as the film careens towards its conclusion.  The story is very complicated, but I think Ritchie does an excellent job in keeping things orderly and moving along at a solid pace.  Ritchie uses a decent amount of techniques to forward the story, including voice overs, slow motion, still frames, flashbacks, odd shooting angles, etc., all of which are utilized in such a way to enhance the story.  All the performances are solid, bolstered by a lot of great dialog awash with cockney slang.  At first some of the language may seem odd, but after awhile the viewer doesn't notice it as much as they're engrossed in the activity on the screen and certain things not understood through dialog alone become apparent from the inflection of speech and the action of the characters.  The first quarter or so of the film sets up most of the characters, while the second quarter presents the dilemma, and then the rest involves Eddie and friends trying to extricate themselves from a very deep hole.  As I mentioned earlier, there's a large number of characters introduced throughout, but know each has a specific role in the overall scheme of things, and is presented with the appropriate amount of screen time in terms of their importance to the story.  Given this was Ritchie's first film, I was amazed at how well he managed to present as much as he did with the ease in which he did it, as everything clicked her for me.  I should also mention the eclectic choice of tunes used throughout worked very well, as there's songs by The Stooges, James Brown, Dusty Springfield, Robbie Williams, The Stone Roses, among others.  My favorite character in the film was Big Chris, a no nonsense enforcer/collector played by Vinnie Jones (he was `Big' Chris, as his young son, who could often be found at his side, was `Little' Chris).  There's a great scene near the end where Big Chris deals with a threat to his son by utilizing a car door on the head on the one who made the threat.  There is a copious amount of violence throughout this comical crime caper, but most of it, in terms of the actual visceral displays, isn't shown.  An example of this is you'll see someone shooting a gun at someone else, but you don't necessarily see the person being shot at during impact.  The trick here is what you don't see you fill in with your mind, given the detailed events just prior, so there's a perception of violence, rather than the actual depiction, which can be just as effective.  All in all this is a highly entertaining film, capped off by a great ending.  If you've seen this film and are interested in others like it, I'd highly recommend Ritchie's next film entitled Snatch (2000), as they're very similar, the main difference being the latter has a larger budget and features a slew of recognizable faces such as Brad Pitt (Mr. & Mrs. Smith), Dennis Farina (""Law & Order""), and Benicio Del Toro (Traffic), along with a number of performers from this film.

The DVD I own is the initial release, and not the `Lock N' Loaded' director's cut which was released later.  In terms of the version I own, the picture, available in both widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1) and fullscreen format (1.33:1), looks clean, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio comes across very well.  In terms of extras there are production notes, cast and crew biographies, a production featurette, trailers for both the U.S. and U.K. release, an informative cockney rhyming slang dictionary, and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.

We start with the four mates Eddy (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), Bacon (Jason Statham) and Soap (Dexter Fletcher).  They all hustle for their living - Bacon sells knockoffs on the street corners, Tom sells ""lost"" electronics, Eddy is a cardshark and Soap is a chef at a restaurant.  The lads each put in 25,000 each as a stake in a high stakes poker game.

Next we have Willie, Charles and Winston.  These are dilettante marijuana growers and dealers.  And then there is Big Chris and Little Chris, a father and son collection team.  The heavy is Harry who owns the local sex shop and is the head gangster of the area.

Eddy goes to the poker game.  The thing is the game is rigged.  Eddy loses the stake and an additional 500,000.  Since the four of them were in on the original stake, Eddy is told that the four jointly owe the debt.  Plus if they don't pay it one week, each will lose one finger each day thereafter.  The only way out is for Eddy's dad (Sting) to give his bar to Harry - who's been his rival since childhood.

In the second story line, two hapless goons are sent to steal two antique muskets.  They do but sell them to someone else, not knowing that they are the antique ones.

But Eddy has come up with a plan of his own.  Next to his flat is a minicab operation which is actually a front for drug traffickers.  Through his closet he hears they are going to rip off Willie, Charles and Winston.  Eddy gets the boys and they decide to do a rip off the traffickers.

In this film nothing ever goes as planned and the ending is a great series of mistakes that compile on each other to a frenetic finale.

This is a great film with so much style that some people get lost in it but just keep your eye on the main characters and you will never get lost.  This has a lot of plot twists and contrivances but the story is really simple.  The characters are plenty and every one has character.  This film is loaded from start to finish.

Eddie(Nick Moran) want's to get chash quick with his ability to gamble, but he needs buy money of 100,000 pounds.  He has 1/4 so he gets the other 3/4 from his friends, Tom(Jason Flemyng), Bacon(Jason Statham), and Soap(Dexter Fletcher).  So all that's left to do is now, is to steal the game like a show, and he and his frieds get to live on sugar hill.  But his toughest opponent Hatchet Harry(P.H. Moriarty)  Had plans on putting Ed in a situation he can't handle.  And believe me this guy will go to any level to get big cash, and if you're on his side, and try to snatch and run with his money, you can hide in the deepest butthole of the city, he'll find you, and your @$$ is his.  Well anyway, he want's to do this to Ed so he can take his father JD's(Sting) bar cuz it has no morgage.  So he gets his friend Barry the Baptist(Lenny McLean) to watch over the game via camera.  Well it doesn't take alot to guess what happens after that.

This movie does a real good job with it's storytelling, and it's kind of a british style pulp fiction.  But unlike Pulp fiction it doesn't have a load of diolauge that gets boring after the first couple of viewings.  This movie has tons of laughable diolauge, thus making it much more lastable than Pulp Fiction.  Altho Pulp Fiction was a better movie after I watched it for the first time, Lock Stock has a boatload of comedy that makes it enjoyable to watch over and over again.  Rory Breaker(Vas Blackwood) is definitly the showstealer with his hillarious quotes.  And it has a superb soundtrack that I believe is worth buying.(The UK version)

Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is definitly a excellent crime capper that is a great movie for thrills and laughes.  Anyone who loves crime movies comedies, Pulp Fiction, or Snatch should definitly check out Guy Ritchie's outstanding debut.

1043541,5,6305492247,"Four lesser thieves from the East End of London find themselves dangerously in debt to a local smut peddler - the result of a fixed poker game. The consequence being that until they repay the money owed, each one will lose a finger for each day the payment is late.

While trying to figure their desperate predicament, they overhear their gangster neighbors setting up a score from some slumberous marijuana dealers and decide that knocking over the neighbours is their only way out.

After the triumphant thievery, they discover that the pot belongs to the same menacing individual they want to fence it through - a black psychopath whose history reads like the Anti-Christ's resume. Enter a miscellany of desperadoes and hoodlums who target our four lads.

For the first time since 'Pulp Fiction', a movie comes along that breaks the shackles of tedious cloning. This film is entertaining and moves along at a cracking pace. Guy Ritchie's script is a tapestry of well-written characters, sharp dialogue that says what needs to be said and leaves the unsaid as food for thought, and a mesh of sub-plots that interlace together with imagination and expertise.

His direction is crisp and inventive allowing the cast of eccentric characters to move about freely while maintaining that erratic edge. In this slick piece of film making, Guy Ritchie denies hackneyed Hollywood trends by scripting no true good-guys just varying degrees of bad ones.

This is a terrific movie. It is violent but not extreme considering the subject matter and cast of cut-throat characters. The language is strong and the humor is black where you'll find yourself belly laughing at the brutal misfortune of others. If this makes you uncomfortable, then this film is not for you. It is also not for those who have been trained by television sit-coms to laugh on cue.

Broadminds are required to enjoy this fine British film where it will definitely add some zing to your day. So stick your tongues firmly in your cheeks and hop on the thrill a minute ride that is 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'.",1110672000,3,2078,4.889204545454546

Also, I loved the ending; in my opinion there really could not have been a much better way to end this movie.

It follows the scams and troubles of three criminal friends as they try to navigate their way through London's criminal underground.  Along the way, they encounter a cast of colourful characters and not so pleasant individuals.  At times its a bit difficult to see how everything fits together, however, it all makes sense soon enough.

For those who have complained that the lingo in this movie is difficult to understand, you need to work on your Britspeak.  The Cockney slang at times is hard but everything else sounds pretty good to me(but then again, I am British.)

I was totally blown away by this high energy caper film.  My first reaction was to compare Ritchie's style with that of Quentin Tarantino.  On subsequent reflection,no, director Guy Ritchie with this film and the subsequent ""Snatch"" has a style all of his own.  What impresses is the way Ritchie handles all of the storylines in this densely plotted story.  He also does it in such a quick-cutting, high-energy style that you have to stop and catch your breath.  Ritchie also gets the most out of a mostly unknown cast.  Most impressive is Vinnie Jones, a former rugby player known for his agressive play on the field, as a formidable debt collector.  It's a shame that the best he could do in American films was that lame remake of ""Gone in 60 Seconds"".  My understanding is that Ritchie populated the film with alot of underworld types and that may account for the realism.  Here's hoping that Ritchie gets back to his roots with his upcoming feature after the misfire that was ""Swept Away"".",1104537600,26,1126,4.67005076142132

1043591,5,6305492247,"I honestly don't remember the last time I laughed so hard. This is a movie which will leave you sore for days afterwards. A complicated tale, which actually improves with re-telling, ""Lock, Stock"" has more quoteable quotes than Shakespeare and is ten times more violent.

Featuring a mix of rising stars, old stars and even some genuine villains, ""Lock, Stock"" is the tale of a bunch of small-time crooks braced against the might of ""Hatchet Harry"", a big wheel in the London underworld. Four young hustlers go after the big time in a game of cards and find themselves in debt to the big man to the tune of half a million pounds. They have a week to pay or they start losing fingers...

A chance crossing of paths with several rival gangs finds our heroes with the opportunity to get themselves out of debt in the allotted time but also finds them in a world of trouble. Clever crafting of the script, with its bewildering array of entirely plausible sub-plots, leave the film with a final body count akin to ""Where Eagles Dare""...but without any Clint Eastwood characters.

A word of warning though: many people, particularly those unfamiliar with the intricacies of irony and rhyming slang, will find this film extremely difficult to comprehend. This is British comedy at its best and it is really refreshing to see that the genre has survived the Trans-Atlantic kow-towing of attempts such as ""A Fish Called Wanda"".

The central four characters work best as an ensemble, which Ritchie realized, so the Gang of Four (as I like to call them) are pretty much together throughout the film when they are featured. Much of the acting is ensemble. There are individual performances that stand out to me, though, such as Jason Statham's rowdily uproarious portrayal of Bacon, Dexter Fletcher's finicky, knife-obsessed Soap, Vinnie Jones's brutal, yet extremely whimsical Big Chris, and Sting's cold and calculated JD. In particular, I love Vas Blackwood's hilariously nasty performance as ""that madman with an Afro"", Rory Breaker, as well as Frank Harper's ultimately terrifying and likely psychotic Dog, Steve Sweeney's vocally-sprained, to-the-hilt Cockneyisms as Plank, and an emaciated Steven Mackintosh's acidic, yet finally naive Winston.

1043625,5,6305492247,"""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" weaves a complicated but compelling where you get caught up in the craziness and want to see how it all comes out in the end.  The salient background information from which we begin is that once upon a time Hatchet Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty) lost a bar in a card game to JD (Sting), and he wants the bar back.  JD's son Eddy (Nick Moran), who is an expert at reading the reactions of other players, scrapes together $25 grand from his con-artist friends to get a seat at Hatchet Harry's big game.  The problem is that the game is rigged and Eddy loses half a million pounds.  This becomes the problem of not only Eddy but his friends, Tom (Jason Flemyng), Bacon (Jason Statham), and Soap (Dexter Fletcher), because Hatchet Harry says they are responsible for the debt as well and they have seven days to make good or his right arm, Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean) will start removing a finger a day.  What Harry really wants is his bar back, and he sends a hit man, Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) and his son, Little Chris (Peter McNicholl), to offer to spare Eddy's life if JD gives him back the bar.  But JD insists his son can take care of his own problem.

From there things get only more complicated.  The four friends decide the only way to come up with the money is to steal it from the other criminals in the neighborhood.  The local drug lord, Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood), has plenty of cash from selling marijuana, but the local tough guy, Dog (Frank Harper) and his crew (and golf clubs) are after the money as well.  Eddy and his desperate friends have no choice but to get in the middle of that one and hope for the best.  Meanwhile, Barry the Baptist has ordered a couple of stupid thieves, Lenny (Stephen Callender-Ferrier) and Gary (Victor McGuire), to rob a house in order to get a pair of antique guns that Harry the Hatchet wants (hence the ""Two Smoking Barrels"" in the title).  To say that these various plots and plans are going to collide is an understatement, because once they start intersecting they do not end.  In fact, I can say that this film literally leaves you hanging as to how it all ends.

Many of the characters are quite colorful, with the gravelly voice Barry the Baptist, the imposing Big Chris, the violent Dog, and the creative con-artist Tom standing out (if only his great ideas would pay off in three days instead of a month).  But there are about twice as many characters running around here as in ""Oceans Eleven.""  Our sympathies are definitely with Eddy and his mates because Hatchet Harry cheated and as things get more and more complicated we think that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and they might get out of this alive, not only with all of their digits intact but perhaps with something else.  There is a lot of violence in this film, but it is the character and the convoluted plot that matter, not the blood and gore, so most of the violence is off screen.

Writer-Director Guy Ritchie is becoming quite an auteur, with this and ""Snatch"" (forget ""Swept Away,"" most people have).  The DVD contains a lexicon for Cockney Rhyming Slang so that you can help decipher what is being said.  Keeping up with the plot complications is a bit tricky, but even if the particulars get beyond you there is still a general sense of where ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is going and you can decide to just hang on and enjoy the ride.  This is not quite a black comedy, but it is certainly cheeky enough to have its own kind of charm.",1098230400,3,3528,4.447204968944099

Unless you're unable to cope with the English accent, make SURE you comedy & action fans watch this movie.  I'd say that each and every performance is also fully fleshed-out and well done, but the cameo by ""Sting"" as a pub-owner & father of one of the main characters was a bit unbelievable.

Notably, it's got a distinctly non-hollywood, almost independent-film feel about it.

The plot has more than enough twists to keep you entertained.  Peripheral characters and subplots abound, and each one works like part of a jigsaw puzzle to make the whole film work perfectly.

1043628,5,6305492247,"Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels is a fantastic british crime drama that has more the disposition of a black comedy than anything else. in the Tradition of quinton tarintino films, this movie is stylish and compelling. With a character driven story and a long convoluted plot. The story follows a group of small time thieves who get way into deep in a game of cards. This sets of an INSANE chain reaction of events, all centered somehow around 2 antique shotguns worth a half million pounds - of course no one knows how much they're worth!!
This is one of the most ironic movies of it's type you'll find. The way all the shiesty characters are brought together in the film is brilliant and entertaining. You've got crosses and double crosses and triple crosses, and in the climax you have the stage set for a major disaster as everyone is killing everyone else, with thanks to great confusion and mistaken identity.
The actual plot twists turns are far too complex to go over in this review just suffiuce it to say that you'll be watching the movie laughing to yourself at the unbelievable turns of fate that unfold on the screen. The wild web of relationships between the characters is simply hilarious. There are chracters working for people they don't even know they are working for who end up killing their own boss unkowingly in the confusion. The camera style is excellent and the english flair is a nice component to the overall feel of the movie in comparison to typical american crime culture flicks.

1043671,4,6305492247,"Hopefully, Guy Ritchie will stop making movies with his wife and go back to what he is a master of: the British small-time crook flick. While not quite as clever as ""Snatch,"" this movie is aprecurrsor of everything that made ""Snatch"" great: widely disparate small time crooks who somehow all become entangled with one another.
Some of the same actors, notably the great Jeremy Statham, who appear in ""Snatch"" are present here, to great effect.
The plot: four buddies suddenly find themselves owing a local gambler known as Hatchet Harry $500,000.00. To pay him back, they concoct a plot to rip off some crooks who plan to rip off the local pot growers. Basically, everyone is trying to rip everyone else off. Playing into this are two antique shotguns, which Hatchet Harry covets (they would be the two smoking barrels of the title) and the buddies come into possession of, totally oblivious to the fact that Harry wants the guns.
What develops is a throwback to the old screwball comedies of the thirties and forties (albeit a very violent throwback), where surprises await as different scenes are viewed from different points of view.

I guess its strengths come from the mood it projects. One of carefree killing and jolly violence. The viewer is left in no doubt that his is fantasy land, so there's no need to moralise over the thefts and killings that take place here. A worthy successor to Get Carter, The Sweeney, and The Long Good Friday, this film draws on elements of all those and adds extras of its own. It even uses several of the Long Good Friday Actors (Dexter Fletcher featured as a boy in the former film, and is one of the four co-stars in this). The film is teeming with cameos, stereotypes, and vignettes, and these only serve to highlight the comedy aspect of this film. Cleverly plotted, its story is  more reminiscent of an Ealing Comedy than a gangster film, despite its less gentle tone. The camera work is innovative, seemingly using a lot of hand held and sped up sequences to give an unique look and feel.
The film is not overlong, and is thoroughly recommended to anyone who likes a good laugh and doesn't mind a few swear words.
The DVD is good, but the lack of extra features (and specifically the lack of a commentary) mean there is no real benefit over the VHS copy unless you want to save shelf space.",1047945600,,1260,4.407725321888412

It is not just a British version of Pulp Fiction, although the story runs along similar crime comedy lines.  Guy Ritchie's debut movie smacks of quick-witted talent and an innate knowledge of his subject - no doubt why second movie Snatch turns out to be more of the same.
The premise of four lads with a get rich quick scheme that goes wrong is basic enough, and so is the impossibly large sum of money that they end up owing a predictably mercenary crime boss.  However, all of this is sharply conveyed in inventive and riotously funny scenes using a cast sprinkled with bona fide criminals.
One thing, as an ex-pat Brit, that I adore Guy Ritchie for is including the making of a cup of tea in each of his movies.  It doesn't get more convincing than that.
This nifty film proves that you don't need a big budget, you don't need big name actors, and you don't need an exotic location to create a classic - but you DO need to be as clever as Guy Ritchie.

1043783,4,6305492247,"When ""Pulp Fiction"" came out, it sent giant waves through pop culture. Suddenly, everyone wanted to emulate Quentin Tarantino's dialogue, direction, worldview and characters. A score of poorly conceived knockoffs flooded the marketplace.
Happily, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" isn't one of them. Although it dwells in the shadow of ""Pulp Fiction,"" Guy Ritchie's film is a work that stands on its own, without a single snickering reference to Tarantino's work. Only the age of the cast and the director form the basis for any real comparisons. Ritchie's film has more heart, no particular interest in popular culture, is even more of a character study and, at its heart, is intensely English.
The trouble begins when four friends pool a substantial sum (100,000 pounds) to get their cardshark friend into a high stakes poker game. Unfortunately, the mobster wants the bar owned by the cardshark's father (wonderfully portrayed by Sting, in a performance fans of his hard-nosed Police days will cheer), and rigs the game. Suddenly, the boys have to come up with half a million pounds in a week, or lose digits off their hands as well as the bar. Living in a shady area of London's East End, opportunities for a criminal enterprise present themselves, and suddenly we're off, peeking into the world of one criminal after another, all of whom seem set to rob, beat or kill one another, and all of whom are more enmesshed in each others' business than they realize. The extended climax throws around more bullets than ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Wild Bunch"" combined, and somehow, out of all the chaos and bloodshed, manages to find real humor and a surprising sweetness even in the most hardened of mobsters.

1043844,5,6305492247,"In baseball they talk about the best all-around players as being ""5-tooled"": they hit for average, hit for power, run, play defense, and throw.  To become a 5-tooled filmmaker, one would have to: present stunning and effective visuals, control a propulsive story, create indelible characters, write smart and important dialogue, and select a fitting and articulate soundtrack.  In contemporary cinema only two American auteurs, Wes Anderson and the Coen Brothers, come even close to filling out all five criterion.  You have to cross the pond and get a Brit, Guy Ritchie, to find my choice as today's only 5-tooled filmmaker.  With his debut movie, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", he proves why.
Visually, ""Lock, Stock..."" is a stunner.  Ritchie's camera is free and expressive and full of energy, while never relying on the tired and the cliched to make a point.  Two sequences quickly come to mind.  The first, which I call the ""I can't believe I lost it all"" scene, displays Eddie's dismay after [losing] out in a high-stakes poker game.  The woozy, punched-in-the-gut feeling that we all can relate to in moments like this is stunningly captured by an array of subtle camera tricks.  No words are spoken, but Eddie's anguish is palpable.  The second sequence, which I call the ""let's celebrate by getting [blind drunk]"" scene, details the cathartic elements of consuming massive amount of alcohol.  It begins with wretched excess, and ends with sloppy sleep.  Anyone familiar with a night of drunken revelry will have it immediately called to mind in this, another wordless sequence.  Throughout the entire film, Ritchie doesn't spare any part of his visual palette, always in a tasteful and significant way.
The story he's come up with is just delightful.  It's infinitely more complicated than most contemporary gangster films, weaving a labyrinthine path from start to finish that always has the audience guessing.  That is until the key moments when it wants the audience to know exactly where it's heading.  It then telegraphs, most amusingly, the next plot point.  One such moment sees a gang driving back home after a job.  The audience has just seen a bloodbath at their destination, and can't wait to see what the characters' reaction will be when they arrive.  Ritchie's command of dramatic irony is astounding in these moments, as is his ability to keep clear several dozen parallel plots.  It all leads up to an ambiguous ending that reminded me a lot of John Sayles' ""Limbo"".  You don't necessarily know what happens after the credits have rolled, but it doesn't really hurt your enjoyment of the story (in fact, it helps.  A lot).
Patrolling this story is a vast army of characters, none coming close to a third dimension, but all somehow fully drawn anyway.  Ritchie gives us clueless would-be cons, ganja growing private school boys, aggressive and unpredictable black gangsters, a sadistic card sharp, and a paternal debt collector.  All are skillfully portrayed, funny, and believable.  Ritchie wastes little time developing character, but manages to anyway.  Clever shortcuts, such as the names he gives them speak, volumes without saying much at all.  A ruthless gang leader is appropriately named Dog.  The moneylender's muscle is named Barry the Baptist, for his predilection towards drowning his victims.  And in one of the film's most curious running jokes, a skinny member of Eddie's gang is nicknamed ""Fat"" Tom, a sobriquet even he doesn't understand.  All of these characters are skillfully acted, more often than not by credible non-actors.  Notorious footballer Vinnie Jones is the best of the bunch, as Big Chris (who squires around his son, Little Chris, to jobs).  Jones shows true menace under Chris' relaxed exterior.  Jason Statham and Lenny McLean are the other amateurs who bring real life grit to their roles.
North American audiences may have a tough time chopping their way through the jungle of Cockney accents, but if they can they'll find that Ritchie's dialogue is stylish and sublime.  One of my favourite irritated monologues, in a film full of them, is this gem spoken by Rory Breaker, the aforementioned unpredictable black gangster:
""If you hold back anything, I'll kill ya. If you bend the truth or I think your bending the truth, I'll kill ya. If you forget anything I'll kill ya. In fact, you're gonna have to work very hard to stay alive, Nick. Now do you understand everything I've said? Because if you don't, I'll kill ya.""
It's stylized, true.  And funny as heck.  But as written, and especially as delivered, it's a menacing little bit of theatre.  Furthermore, Ritchie's reliance on Cockney rhyming slang gives the film an authentic and puzzling tone.  Thankfully, the DVD comes complete with a rhyming slang dictionary, so it's ham and cheesy to get a translation in no bird.
The soundtrack holds a mix of songs from many disparate styles.  But they always manage to provide relevant commentary on the action, and they always make the action, and sometimes the audience, move.  We've got a couple of James Brown tunes, a track by the Stone Roses, the Stooges doing ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" in one hilarious moment, and Robbie Williams (!) punching up the action in another.  The punkier elements mix perfectly with the funkier ones, creating a unified message where I'd thought one couldn't ever exist.
After the first time I saw ""Lock, Stock..."" in theatres, I made it my mission to create a good word-of-mouth buzz about this film.  I wouldn't shut up about this fantastic little movie.  It's the kind of edgy, addictive cinema that should be more common and more popular.  I'm doing my best to spread the word.  Won't you follow me?",1022025600,11,5702,4.974656810982048
1043845,4,6305492247,"Most of the British movies that make it to America are either historical epics [Sense and Sensibility, The English Patient] or frothy comedies [Notting Hill, The Full Monty]. The truth is that, while their output is much smaller than ours, our Brit cousins make all sorts of movies. Most of them do not travel well. Some are about things that don't interest us. Others employ dialects we simply don't understand.
Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels concerns subjects dear to the hearts of many Americans - crime, gangsters and the male obsession with guns. Some viewers will want to avoid it because these things do not interest them. The lingo of the British lower middle-class will turn others off. I found it to be a wicked and inventive black comedy. While I did not understand every word of dialog, the very contemporary visual style got the point across. I didn't miss a thing.
We meet four young men who are close friends. Tom is a card shark, Eddy and Bacon are con artists and fences, and the fourth wants nothing to do with criminal activity, which is why they call him Soap. Tom knows of a high stakes card game put on by the local porn king. Hoping to make a lot of money, each of the lads puts up 25,000 pounds. Tom winds up losing 500,000 pounds in one of the cleverest card games ever filmed. They have one week to repay the debt. This sets off a maniacal set of events, ruled by double-dealing and crossed signals.
A fine set of eccentric characters inhabit the movie. There is the porn king, whose passion in life is collecting antique guns, two of which are of great importance to the plot. One of his henchmen spends as much time scolding his young son as he does beating people up. He's a ganster with a code of ethics, no less. There are the pot dealers who use so much of their product that they have no idea how much money they have. They keep it in shoe boxes, which proves to be unwise. The boys trying to find the half-million pounds are madly clever and clueless at the same time.
Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is extremely violent at times. There is a reason that it succeeds in spite of this, and that is because every single character is a criminal in one way or another. Since there are no innocent victims involved, it's all bad guys versus bad guys. While this does not make the violence okay, it does allow the movie to be free of the cynicism prevalent in most such films today. Because it shows only crooks who seem to relish their work, it is no more real than Batman. These made up characters in a made up story inhabit a London which does not really exist. This is nothing more than a yarn, but what a good one it is. It's a delight for those with a sense of the ridiculous.",1016755200,2,2719,4.3861386138613865

1043847,5,6305492247,"Guy Ritchie has certainly excelled and done himself proud in making Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.  In a decade of more stylised films, thanks to the likes of Tarantino, Lock Stock stands as one of the finest ""art house"" films ever.  The strength of the film lies in the dialogue of the four main characters, and is exemplified right from the word go.  The opening scene in which we see Jason Stratham hawking goods on London's Petticoat Lane is so marvellously accurate (not to mention brilliantly funny) that it could have been taken with a camcorder on the actual street.  Ritchie has an unreal knack for capturing not only the accents but the dialogue of real Londoners (being one, I have never seen a more accurate depiction in film.)  In addition to his remarkably witty dialogue, his camera movements are magnificant, such as the scene were the protagonist leaves a rigged card game feeling drunk and disoriented.  The filming is so good it makes yo ufeel as if you are right along with him.

1043851,4,6305492247,"Anyone who after seeing this film and doesn't admit they enjoyed it, is a lier. While definately not a great film by any standard, the dialog, colourful characters, and clever story make this film very entertaining:
Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels successfully achieves a bizarre cross between traditional heist/gangstar movie( ala Resevoir Dogs) and traditional British non-romatic comedy ( ala 'Nuns on the Run').
As a comedy containing plenty of enjoyable action, it can in no way be interpreted as a serious or intelligent film. The flaws in this film are clearly evident; Firstly, the location of this film is dubious, although supposedly set in East London, it was obviously not actually filmed there as the location in the film looks more like Portsmouth. Secondly, apparently the film takes place in the side of town where there are no women- -the film has no female characters. Thirdly, Guy richie's direction can at certain times be nausia inducing: as a former pop video director he retains an annoying tendancy for 'flash' camera angles and over cutting.
However a combination of an excellent storyline; full of twists and meaningfull coinsidences, very very colourful characters and the novelty of seeing Football's least talented but most violent thug in his acting debut, not only keep the film afloat but make all the films aformetioned flaws forgiven.
To conclude, this is a deeply flawed but still very very enjoyable film. Worth watching just to see Vinnie Jones in his first role since leaving Wimbledon where he along with John Fashnu and Dennis Wise once terrorised football. He is wholly convincing and scary mainly because he is playing himself! And that is not a testament to his acting ability but to his character.
 I'm sure Gary Lineker can't dare to watch any of the scenes starring Vinnie, With Vinnies infamous death threat's to him after Lineker dived, and got him sent off when they played each other in 1995/96 season.",1009324800,,1955,5.015384615384615

Well I can give you a few good reasons:
First of all, every time you watch the movie you discover things you weren't aware of, such as Phrases, Camera tricks, Soundtrack, etc.
Second of all, The movie is very funny, has great actors that feet right in to their characters. The Soundtrack is great. The filming is very special, and the story goes into the point where the audience is very sympathetic with the characters.

1043897,5,6305492247,"It's hard to believe this was Guy Ritchie's first film. A cavalcade of characters with intertwining plot twists and laced with dark humour and a cockney accent to boot. The accent ofcourse adds to the atmosphere of the film ... East London, Drugs, Punk rock and of course the quirky characters thrown into the mix, partly because of the circumstances and mostly because of their stupidity.
A permanently stoned set of ganja cultivators, two dumb robbers, 'Nick' the pawnbroker, Rory Breaker ""madman"" with an afro gang, and a ruthless band of drug dealers and you have an absolutely original movie called Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.
""Eddy"" and his gang rustle up a 100 grand which would allow them to play a game of poker with the local high stakes player ... he reckons his chances are good as he is very good at cards and reading people's reactions.
""Bacon"" part of Eddy's gang hustles stolen goods selling them out of his suitcase on a street corner.
""Soap"" the chef also helps finance the gang's plans and also likes to keep his hands clean.
""Tom"" Entrepreneur among the 4 friend gang of thieves who gets attached to the antique guns later in the movie.
""Dog"" a ruthless gangster who steals from other drug dealers is also a neighbour of ""Eddy"" and his gang.
""Plank"" part of the ""Dog"" gang who masterminds the caper to rob the ""ganja growers"" of their shoe boxes full of money and their weed.
""Nick the greek "" - The pawnbroker who deals with Eddy's gang, Rory Breaker and the dumb thieves.
""Rory breaker"" - A ruthless drug dealer
""Big Chris"" a debt collector for Hatchet Harry who also takes his son along everywhere
""Hatchet Harry Porn King"" - A compulsive high stakes gambler who doesn't take ""No"" for an answer. Loses his bar to Sting in a game of poker and wants it back at all costs.
""Barry the baptist"" - Runs the business smoothly for Hatchet Harry by taking care of minor details like people who stand in his way.
Harry the Hatchet rigs a game of Poker he is playing with Eddy and gives him a week to pay off his debt of 500 grand or he and each member of his gang will lose a finger for every day that passes after the deadline and eventually his DAD's bar. What happens after this makes up for a very watchable film full of amazing twists and turns. The innovative camerawork, the sepia toned film and the amazing soundtrack complement this film splendidly giving birth to a whole new style of film making. This is a must-have for DVD collectors and even first time watchers of the film.

This film is very well writen and very well made and is enjoyable for many future viewings.
The DVD:  This is  such a great, great film but the DVD is terrible! First of all, the DVD has barely any extra features. Sure, it has more then some DVD's on the market but when you compare it to 'Snatch' amoung many, it is low. My least favorite part is the documentary. It is pathetic. You wonder why they even threw it in there. It's a seven minute interview with the cast members repeating the plot over and over again. Now the lack of extra features wouldn't make it so bad but then you have the film. The sound is off! This ruins everything! This is especially evident in the scene in which Soap says, ""Guns for show, knives for a pro."" Terrible.

The movie is confusing, the dialogue is difficult to understand, and there are too many coincidences to even think that this movie is relatively realistic.  Unfortunately the movie just forgot to do anything special.

Granted, I'm not saying the movies should win an Oscar, but they deserve a degree of respect. And this business of calling Lock, Stock a ""sequel"" to Pulp Fiction is ridiculous.  The only thing similar about the movies is Jules' and Rory Breaker's hairstyle (bad move I guess Guy). And try to find a movie that hasn't been influenced in some way by another.

Things seem disastrous for the four boys when the week is up and their neighbors, Harry, as well as the drug dealers are after them.  This movie is a funny and clever thrill ride that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat until the very end. The storyline, at first, seems to be four or five separate stories, but they tie-in nicely as the film progresses.

Guy Ritchie (a.k.a Mr. Madonna) has a knack for semi-nonlinear filmmaking (although this is a tad more prevalent in ""Snatch,"" but I digress), and although at times it may seem like you're watching an hour and a half long music video, it's engrossing nonetheless.  I've felt that my generation (born in 1976, thank you) hasn't had its' fair share of media attention, being sort of in the middle of Generation X and whatever you want to call the Britney Spears fans out there, but even though I'm from across the pond, and have (luckily) never been involved in such shennanigans, I think this movie really speaks to me and mine.  Bacon, Soap, Fatman, and Eddy are so conflicted, so human, that I can almost envision myself and my roomies in a similar situation. The humour is dry, the wit razor sharp, and any movie with Sting in it is A-Okay with me.  My only major critique is with the so-called ""interactive"" menus.

Guy  Ritchie has a masterpiece here. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a  brilliantly woven together jumble of plot twists within plot twists all  culminating at the end in a perfectly neat and tidy package.
Ritchie  brought music video cinematography to this movie and it could not have  worked better. Each and every scene is portrayed perfectly by the toned  down colors and hyper-frenetic camera play. The acting is perfect, clearly  bringing across the cleverness, brutality, or sheer stupidity of the  characters.
Ritchie et al. have brought the gangster film into the 90's  and done an impeccable job of it. While the movie plays loudly and  outrageously, there are constant subtle undercurrents and great  implications concerning everyone involved.

Lock, Stock... is a brilliant tale centering on the  story of 4 close friends who, after unfairly losing a poker game to a  cheating porn-king, find themselves needing to come up with a lot of money,  very fast, or else it's off with all of their favorite appendages.  However, just one plot is too bland, so the writer does an amazing job of  intertwining the plots and people of no less than 5 different, completely  unique sets of characters.

The stories are Brilliant.  The characters are Brilliant.  The  dialogue is Brilliant.  The story-line is Brilliant.  The plot twists are  Brilliant.  And by the end, when it's all tied together?  BRILLIANT!  And  just wait till you get to the very end....wow, definitely one of the most  brilliant endings I've seen in years!

All in all I  think this movie is just a very well written and acted piece of work, and a  good piece of work will transcend borders, as this movie has.

1044100,4,6305492247,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a Tarantino-like tale of four London rogues who pool their money on a high-stakes card game, only to have them lose it all and end up owing half a million dollars.  Witty dialogue  and memorable characters make it a notable release from newcomer Guy  Ritchie.
In a nutshell, ""Lock"" is a British smash hit that debuted at  the Edinburgh film festival in the summer of '98 and did not open in  America until the spring of this year.  It tells the story of a poker shark  named Eddy (Nick Moran) and his three mates who bankroll his effort to beat  a porn magnate named Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarity).  This is high stakes  poker (ala Rounders) and it takes all four of them to gather the $250,000  to even enter the game with Harry.  Harry ends up as a cheat though and  Eddy leaves the game ending up owing twice what he came in with, as well as  explanations to his friends, and his Dad (Sting).  Harry's  bouncer/collector explains to Eddy that the total is due in a week, and if  it is not paid pronto he will start maiming people and repossess his  father's bar.
What to do now?  Eavesdrop on the neighbors who are  planning a robbery of some drug dealers with whom they are friendly.  The  drug dealers get crossed up with a hilarious local hood named Rory (Vas  Blackwood) and eventually all of the multi-layered plans intersect as  Ritchie shows us all periphery players heading towards the same point.  He  exposes it in a stylish form that matches slo-motion, time plays, and the  like, all while trying to keep coherence of a plot denser than The Matrix.  And while the dialogue is easier to understand than many British invasion  movies, it is still difficult to make out words and sentences at times.  You'll have to see the movie to find out how the guys do and see who wins  in the end, but if you like this genre, you'll have fun with this one.",955929600,2,1897,4.4273255813953485

I call it Action X (typified by Pulp Fiction) because it is a  genre unto itself loved by Generation X. It is a combination of  Action/Adventure, Film Noir, and Horror laced with bizarre characters,  offbeat themes, sick humor and lots of irony. Personally, I don't find it  very entertaining, but I have to give it credit for creativity and  boldness.
If there is one area I have to compliment in this film it is  the direction. Excellent, daring photography, scenes well thought out, lots  of interesting stuff happening on the screen. I gave this a 6/10 only  because it was so well directed. The script was clever, but pointless and  if there was any theme to the story it was that stupid people tend to do  stupid things and end up dead, except our heroes who do stupid things and  are just lucky enough to get away with it.
Though I understand the film's  appeal, I guess I just can't appreciate a film that uses excellent  filmmaking technique to produce a product so unrefined.",955929600,2,1135,4.64321608040201
1044130,3,6305492247,"Here is another ""this isn't for everyone"" movie. ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a stylish, contemporary production set in London's East End, a place known for its ""difficulties.""  It was successful in the UK, and Americans ought to find the British twist  on ""Reservoir Dogs"" inspired movies somewhat appealing. The film  boasts imaginative camerawork, unpredictable turns (I rather liked the  ending), and a great soundtrack. Most of the actors are unknowns with  little feature-film experience, but they mostly do a good job; the rock  star Sting plays a minor but acceptably performed role in the picture, as  the father of one of the ""heroes."" (According to the  ""featurette"" the movie employs ""real villains,"" a  revelation that doesn't seem very surprising.)
While this film isn't of  the most original caliber, the young, up and coming artists managed to  impart a distinguishable flavor that makes their effort worth viewing. The  movie is comical, although one might say that it's more humorous than  funny. It also contains some graphic violence -- a fact that caught me  off-guard, as I expected the bloodshed to be implied. ""Lock, Stock and  Two Smoking Barrels would've been a better picture without the shocking  effect of unnecessarily HEAVY on-screen bleeding. (I'm not averse to strong  violence in movies, but it seemed so incongruous to the spirit of THIS work  that it nearly put me off.) Nevertheless, if you like films such as  ""Trainspotting"" or ""Reservoir Dogs,"" you should enjoy  this one...but that's not a promise.
The DVD picture quality is mediocre,  but the sound is slightly better in comparison. The special features  include a ""featurette"" that amounts to some brief interviews with  the actors describing their characters in the production; an inclusion  that's practically useless once you've seen the movie. There's an uncommon  feature, ""Cockney Rhyming Slang,"" that I found amusing and  useful, it's a glossary of street lingo used in London.

THis is the first time I'm glad I was wrong.  Although a little  more action might have helped a bit more.  This flick is thoroughly  enjoyable and a very respectable flick for the rookie director.  I wont'  delve into the plot much.  There is a group of four boys who owe a local  crime lord and porn king half a million dollars, for every day they don't  pay they lose a finger each.

  Well if not,  then don't lose hope, because their plans of action are absolutely  hilarious! The humour and the different characters focused on in this flick  will make you want to see it again.

I'd say the only downer about this flick is that it  takes a while to get to the action, but the slick wit and humour do a good  job of not making it unbearable.  Also, there is way too much cussin in  this flick, so if it offends you, you might wanna think twice about this  flick.  STing is also part of the cast, but he's in it for five  minutes....
  Well what can I tell you, it's funny, it's got  action, I'm sure it will be a cult classic very soon.  If not already.  It's relatable to OUt OF sight by Elmore Leonard and Reservoir Dogs by  Tarantino, and the story flows similar to Payback, except that it's not  about revenge.

1044193,2,6305492247,"Lock, Stock, and... should be filed under that great pantheon of obvious and too inspired films. A modern, hip gangster film crammed with all the prerequisite underdeveloped stock characters and plot that  ""surprisingly"" converges in the finale. Its not like we haven't  seen this sort of thing before, so Guy Ritchie ends up making a film that  feels like pieces of other, better, movies. A glorified clone.
That is  not to say it isn't okay. Despite all the flaws in predictable characters  and plotting (not to mention events lifted from other movies), it is still  interesting enough to make you want to see how it ends. It is tolerable,  but, for myself, just in that one viewing.
The cast of characters is way  too large for any of them to really develop beyond caricature. Most are  strictly defined by cool sounding names like Hatchet Harry, Rory Breaker,  Barry the Babtist, and Jimmy the Saint (oh, sorry, Jimmy the Saint was from  that other over-inspired hipster gangster film Things to do in Denver when  You're Dead. Funny how they all run together) And, whether menacing or  likable, or likably menacing, all of characters are laced with humor, and  quips abound. But, it feels strained, with nearly every character speaking  with fast, silver tongued ribbings (as in Bringing up Baby, Hudsucker  Proxy,...Jackie Brown). Instead of being natural, it feels like a  contrivance.
So too, is the directing too reliant on devices. It is fine  to have a technique you like, such as the slow motion montage, but if  executed too glaringly and often it becomes tiresome. Guy Ritchies  direction, the slow motion effects, the loopy or dead straight steadycam  shots, just never struck me as being very individual or unique. Once again,  it looks like a pale imitation of others, not quite original enough.  Personally, the harsh lighting on the indoor scenes was hideous to look at,  and the music seemed punched in, too loud, and not smoothly worked in at  all.
Vinnie Jones was very commanding as Big Chris. Val Blackwwod was  completely unintimidating as Rory Breaker. And, Sting was completely Sting  (hate when a celebrity shows up for five seconds in a movie, never  establishing a character).
If Guy Ritchie could escape the stranglehold  of his peers, and find at least one original bone in his body, he may,  someday, create something worthwhile.",950918400,,2361,4.933842239185751

There's a great line of surrealism to  everything in the movie - the bungling Scousers, the bickering gang of  four, the casual violence of Big Chris, the absurd menace of Mr. Breaker.  The script is tailored perfectly, timed to confuse and yet resulting in a  wonderful mix of humour and coincidence. And the casting is first-rate.
Those unable to expand their minds beyond Hollywood may have trouble  with the style, and those looking for crystal-clear visuals will have to  put up with the washed-out look.

1044243,5,6305492247,"This has got to be the most beautiful fiasco I have ever seen.  I loved the fact that it was very difficult to follow at first, and that I was kept in the dark about many things (i.e. burning man exits a pub.)  It's the  funniest what-the-hell-is-going-on film I have seen in years.  Clever  camera work also.",942105600,,309,4.350877192982456

1044336,5,6305492247,"I debated whether or not to rent this movie for a couple weeks (looked like Reservoir Dogs).  Then a friend said it was worth checking out, so I did. I was not disappointed!  This is not only the best British movie I've  ever seen, but one of the best movies I've seen in quite a while.  The  action is nonstop, the humor is right on, and the cinematography is great.  This flick grabs you from the opening scene and never lets up.  Though some  of the dialogue is hard to follow for us Yanks, it's worth watching again  to try and figure out.  Constant plot twists, great soundtrack, superb  acting- I can't say enough!  Everyone must see it now!",937440000,,647,4.34453781512605

1044411,4,6305492247,"Fast talking cockney lines fired at you so fast it's hard to keep up(and I'm English!)  Excellent plot, lots of fun and humor (humour?), nicely shot and Vinni Jones finds life after football (soccer!)  Americans beware -  believe it or not these characters are speaking English - be patient and  you'll get it sure enough.",934761600,,322,4.8
1044412,4,6305492247,"I was hooked from from the first digit change on my DVD player! The plot is very well executed and slick. The actors are well known and not known which helps as you sit and think....""I know that guy, from  somewhere!"" If you have a Dolby Digital amp, crank it up and listen to  a cracking sound track which mixes with the action so well (as well as the  golfing scene!) If you wish to know the true life of London's east end,  watch this. Us English don't all drink tea and watch our football team  struggle!",932947200,,508,4.195876288659794
