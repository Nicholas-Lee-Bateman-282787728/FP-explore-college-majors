The film is slightly over one hour long, but I think the writers could have expanded this excellent plot into a longer movie. There are a couple scenes where information was given to the viewer a little too quickly and in a vague way. However, William Boyd makes up for any flaws you can find. Hopalong Cassidy fans are in for a treat - this is a gem in his career that you'll definately want to see.
As for this DVD release, I must say I was expecting better quality since it said 'remastered'. The picture is sharp enough, but there are frequent black lines on the screen and the sound quality isn't the best. BUT it's still good enough to enjoy and I'm sure this DVD is superior quality to a five dollar version I've seen on Amazon.",1427328000,,927,4.364161849710983
8051827,5,B0007UNUBE,"I'm always amazed at how Hollywood in the 1930s were able to crank out dozens of formula pictures a year and still have almost all of them stand the test of time.

This is one of the oldest formulas in the book. People are trapped on a boat and there is a killer on board.

Can they find him?

Will he kill again?

Why is he killing?

You get the drill. Yet even though I've seen at least a dozen variations on this theme it still made me smile to watch this version.

Rock on!",1146700800,,477,3.968421052631579
