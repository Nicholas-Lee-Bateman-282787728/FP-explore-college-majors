8355075,5,B0027RH2FK,"Jason Gibson is a genius!! I ordered all of his chemistry, his calculus and all of his physics!! So far I have just completed the chemistry and I have such a greater understanding because of this man.  He breaks everything down to such a simple easy to understand format. Please, Jason Gibson, come out with an organic chemistry tutor DVD set!!",1423008000,,344,4.639344262295082

8355077,5,B0027RH2FK,"If you look at my profile you will see I have reviewed many of Jason's DVDs.  I try to review things that are not completely subjective to taste like DVDs (movies), music and novels, although whether someone is going to like any product or find it useful is always going to have an element of subjectivity in it.  I have bought many of Jason's tutorial videos as I have been working my way through math and physics classes.  I use them to prepare for the class ahead of time, as a refresher during the semester (depending on how good my teacher that semester happens to be), and to get ready for finals.

What this is:

It is a DVD LECTURE.  It is a replacement for a tutor, not a substitute for class, or as the reviewer who gave it two stars seemed to expect, a rah-rah physics is great DVD.  The whole point is to give you exposure to physics problems, and strategies for how to solve them.  It is a guy in front of a white board doing problems.  Plain and simple, if that does not sound like something that would be a useful learning tool for you, do not waste your money.

It is not like a typical college lecture however (especially the lecture from a physics with calculus class).  Jason does not do a lot of deriving the formulas (although he does do some derivation because it is not unheard of to get a quiz or test question asking you to do so).  For the most part however, he just presents the formula, gives a little background on the subject and launches in to doing problems.

There is not much calculus used in the set.  Because he does not do much derivation, most of the math is just algebra.  The same way even in a calculus based physics class, when you do the actual problems you are using algebra, the lecture is going to look a lot different that the lecture you are going to see in class if you are taking physics with calculus, but the problem solving principles will be the same.

The problems range in varying degree of difficulty.  Jason does work some problems that have multiple sub-parts to them, just like you will get on an exam, but he generally does not put the hardest possible questions on the DVDs.  He tends to put the foundation material that you have to get down in order to understand anything else in the topic.  But don't expect that these will be the exact same problems you are going to get in homework and on exams.  They will be very similar, but you have to work more than just the problems on the DVD to learn the material well.  Plus, it is your teacher who will be picking problems, not Jason, so this should not, and is not intended to be, a replacement for class and homework.",1342828800,4,2630,4.315682281059063
8355078,5,B0027RH2FK,"I bought this for the MRS as she has had to teach herself many times since she went back to the University of Texas. She said that the guy explaining the material in this series is very good when one cannot understand a professor in college, and he is even better when the professor offers nothing to understand.",1329955200,4,312,4.396551724137931
8355079,2,B0027RH2FK,"I had the pleasure of reading reviews of this title before buying the product. Unfortunately the reviews I read did not clarify my mind about the product and I ordered it anyway,  I was under the wrong impression that this dvd will create interest in various topics of physics among my students.  However, to my utter dismay, the video is for those students who want to learn the subject without a teacher and to me it looks like a dry presentation of a very interesting subject.  I would be useful only for those who wish to study the subject of physics at home without the help or guidance of a teacher.
