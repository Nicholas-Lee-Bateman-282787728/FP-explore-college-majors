7856830,1,6303934811,The video was very poor quality....couldn't view it.  Too bad because it's a great film noir when movies were just developing and improving.  Wish they could improve the quality and transfer I to a DVD.,1490486400,,202,4.742857142857143
7856831,5,6303934811,The Night Has Eyes is a good  suspense filled movie. Good for a rainy day or any time during Halloween. James Mason brings his usual fine acting to the role as the troubled young man. Well worth watching.,1443398400,,204,4.368421052631579
7856832,1,6303934811,dreadful transfer. unwatchable. SinisterCinema defective transfer--they refuse to correct/upgrade...There is a brand-new PAL restored from original 35mm! THE FILM ITSELF gets *****...,1440806400,,183,7.363636363636363

7856834,5,6303934811,"I first saw this on TV in about 1953 as a young child and it left me with a life-long impression = FRIGHT. I was pleased to find it again here and relive the excitement. For the most part, it is a darn good mystery, but when some ""kind"" characters are revealed to be dangerously evil, things start to get downright scary. The last scene is totally horrific and the last spoken line will haunt your thoughts as you remember it -- the rest of the week.",1385596800,,450,4.183908045977011
7856835,4,6303934811,There is no need to buy the Dvd of The Night has Eyes. The picture quality of this vhs tape is same as dvd quality.,1372377600,3,115,3.64
7856836,5,6303934811,"Tho' dark during the night scenes, you can still make out all that is going on on this DVD - and by the end, it really adds to the atmosphere!  This is one of those afternoon film noir thrillers that I enjoyed so much as a kid - glad to have it available to watch again, with great performances by a young James Mason & the wonderful Mary Clare as the kindly old housekeeper ... or IS she?  (Duh-Duh-Duhhhh!) Until Criterion decides this one needs salvaging, this DVD is the best so far.",1342915200,3,487,4.225806451612903
7856837,5,6303934811,"Oh, this is exactly what a spooky, suspense-filled movie should be!  Why can't they make movies like this anymore? Everything is perfect in this overly darkly-lit movie. The old house, the actors are great in all their parts, even the monkey deserves an Oscar. Two young school teachers (Mary Clare and Joyce Howard) traverse the Yorkshire Moors looking for the dead body of a friend, foolishly. They are almost swallowed up by the bog in the drenching rain when they find refuge in the castle-ly home of James Mason's character. They learn that he is a war-scarred pianist with a mysterious past and there are two loyal household employees filling out this macabre soup. The home contains a forboding secret room which one of the houseguests must get into. Also there is the strange request that everyone in the household must lock themselves in their rooms at night--especially when there is a full moon. One of the school teachers stays behind in the home when an opportunity comes for a ride back to civilization. She has fallen in love with the pianist and must find out more. She does discover a dead body--but whose? This movie is so dark that I feel it is a disguise for some of the low-budget special effects used. The girls on the moor is probably produced by a giant wind fan in the studio and all of the backgroud scenery, including the first view of the house are probably black cardboard cutouts that are just displayed by occasional flashes of backlighting (lightning). There is also a very fake looking lightning bolt that just appears for a split second on screen--looks like it is hand-drawn with white paint. These ""flaws"" are entertaining, rather than distracting, as we admire the creativity of the art department. Bravo, for a great movie and James Mason as an actor, especially when he utters the almost evil sounding command to the arriving women, ""You'd better get DRY.""",1275177600,3,1895,4.795107033639144
7856838,5,6303934811,"I am now 70 - and still remember this film vividly after 56 years.
I was 14 when I saw it (illegally) at a smelly Sunday cinema fleapit in my hometown of Northampton UK (in the 'Temperance Hall' where they never asked whether we were 16, and the only place where we could smoke our lungs to death without worrying).
I remember every moment of that film, the finale in particular, and came out from the cinema terrified - and have been terrified ever since of swampy looking land. Being a frequent visitor to Bangladesh, this has been a handicap!
Seeing this well-made superb thriller again - and I'd love to get a DVD of it - has brought back so many memories.
I thoroughly recommend it.",1257465600,4,687,4.417322834645669
7856839,1,6303934811,I purchase this from tcm website.  The movie came from sinister cinema and was shipped seperately from my other movie i purchased.  Its a dvd-r which they do not tell you at the tcm movie website.  Very poor quality and the picture is just as bad as the video was.  At least the video was legitimate.,1250121600,2,300,4.303571428571429
