It's one thing to tell someone the consequences of drunk/distracted, (etc) driving and an altogether different thing to see the bloody, real life corpses of drivers that made poor choices and it cost them their lives!. Really drives the point home!!! Highly recommend along with latest version, Red Asphalt V located at https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000N8P8DS",1491350400,,546,7.287878787878788
8365254,5,B002DJJC7I,Very informative and helpful,1438128000,2,28,6.25
8365255,5,B002DJJC7I,Very effective to show my teen the dangers of driving irresponsibly.. Also got Red Asphalt V which is the newest version!,1432771200,,121,4.809523809523809
8365256,1,B002DJJC7I,This was way too old. I got it for my teenager daughters that will start driving soon and some of these videos were made before I was born! Way too old. Should state that these videos are over 20 years old! I was disappointed and we didn't continue watching. Need more updated videos with teens drinking/texting while driving so it will be more relatable for teens who are getting licensed now in 2014...,1394755200,,404,4.5479452054794525
8365257,3,B002DJJC7I,I thought it would help show my kid how you must take driving seriously time will tell. they don't teach drivers Ed in school anymore.,1390435200,,134,4.4
8365258,5,B002DJJC7I,It starts with older version and goes up to newer versions. Positive about how alcohol and driving relates to crashes.,1386460800,,118,4.95
8365259,4,B002DJJC7I,I donated this copy to the Los Angeles Corners office. They are currently using it in their educational programs. Remember to buckle up!,1380672000,,136,4.956521739130435
8365260,3,B002DJJC7I,"This is a kind of cheesy video.  Old and outdated.  It is a little hard to take the video seriously because of the way it was put together.  The only reason I'd show it, is to see some gory scenes to scare people into driving more carefully.  Some of the scenes are graphic and have some effect on watchers.",1373500800,3,307,4.1525423728813555
