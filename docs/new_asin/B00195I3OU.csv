3423359,5,B00195I3OU,"MGM presents ""MANY RIVERS TO CROSS"" (23 February 1955) (95 mins/Color) (Dolby digitally remastered) -- Our story line and plot, Bushrod Gentry (Robert Taylor) is the freelance fur trapper who is passing through --- On his way he is rescued by Mary Stuart Cherne (Eleanor Parker) --- Following this, the battle of the sexes begins --- It is frontier wits versus feminine charm, and guile --- Victor McLaughlin is himself (but that's just fine by me), James Arness plays a mountain man and a young Alan Hale Jr. (before Gilligan's Island) combine with the perennially juvenile antics of Russ Tamblyn to provide and hour and a half plus of escapist entertainment and downright good old fashioned laughter --- The final scene of Parker moaning over Taylor to attract the Indians to the scene and kill them, very funny and neatly done, easily worth the price of the ticket, or what must have been for those that saw it in the theater.

3423378,5,B00195I3OU,"Unfortunately, comedies made today, for the most part, don't even provoke this film commentator to a half a grin. You almost expect some ""canned laughter"" to emit from the soundtrack, and I feel obligated for some reason to issue a half a chuckle. Clearly, ""Many Rivers to Cross"" is not one of these modern day comedies.

Two of Hollywood's most acclaimed dramatic stars turn to light comedy in this 1955 MGM frontier adventure, circa early pre-Revolutionary era. The utter surprise is that both actors proved themselves not only capable comedic actors, but their overall romantic appeal enhanced itself on the screen in an unexpected way. Their timing was flawless and priceless as well.

The stunningly handsome matinee idol going by the name of Robert Taylor matches wits with the most tomboy-like, man-crazy, gorgeous frontier woman that there ever was, Eleanor Parker.

Well-written, witty and fast-paced as well, you'll sit back and slap your knees in glee as the chemistry between both stars mesmerizes and ignites. Eleanor Parker is not only an intense dramatic actress when the part calls for it, but she's an extremely physical comedy actress as well with impeccable timing that's so vital in making a comedy film.

She swims better than does Robert Taylor, fights, shoots and snaps a bull whip with precision, rolls in the dirt, gets dunked in a horse trough and so much more--all for the sake of trapping the man that she loves. She somehow manages to pull it off with a touch of class that's unimaginable for a frontier woman. Bravo Parker! You should have gotten another Oscar nomination, if not the Oscar, in addition to ""Interrupted Melody"" that same year.",1474329600,,1672,4.982078853046595

3423407,4,B00195I3OU,"In the 1790's, Kentucky is still ""the frontier"": people still live in log cabins (albeit often quite commodious), men still fight to maim and kill, and Shawnee war parties still quarter across the land.  But to Bushrod Gentry (Robert Taylor), it's getting too civilized.  Bushrod is a trapper, a brawler, an Indian fighter, and a long-travelling, lone-wandering looker over vast expanses; he says he hopes to one day find a place to settle down and plant the gourd seeds he always carries, but he also has a way of attracting female attention (not, apparently, by any overt action) and then leaving a broken heart behind him.  He's made up his mind that the Northwest Territory is the place for him.  But on his way there he falls afoul of a small Shawnee party and sustains a deep stab wound in his right arm--before his assailant is driven off by Mary Stuart Cherne (Eleanor Parker), a redheaded tomboy who can shoot, swim, and track as well as most men, and her Delaware friend and mentor, Sandak (Ralph Moody), who calls her ""Stepping Woman"" from her ability to keep up on the trail.  Mary Stuart takes Bushrod home for medical attention, and her father Cadmus (Victor McLaglen), mother, and four brothers accept him as a guest and friend.  Unable to go on till his shooting arm heals, he finds, as so often before, that she's more or less throwing herself at his head.  But he also finds much to respect in her--such as the time she wins a rifle-shooting contest against men--and helps her to trick her father into buying the spectacles he badly needs but is too proud to admit to.  Then she maneuvers him into what's essentially a shotgun wedding, and he's furious.  Resolved to go on to the Northwest Territory without even consummating their union, he meets Esau Hamilton (James Arness), a fellow-frontiersman of whom he has often heard, and begins to realize that settling down and starting a farm and a family doesn't make a man any less than what he's always been.  When Mary Stuart pursues him and finds herself fleeing from another Shawnee party, Bushrod doesn't hesitate to go to the rescue.

Taylor was what was known in his time as a ""matinee idol,"" but in this seriocomic film he proves that, like John Wayne, he could handle humorous situations too.  There's plenty of frontier action and a surprise twist at the end.  Viewers who've enjoyed movies like ""Rooster Cogburn"" or the ""screwball comedies"" of the 30s might find ""Many Rivers"" quite to their taste.",1437523200,,2475,4.741258741258742
3423408,5,B00195I3OU,"When Robert Taylor made this film he had not been in a comedy in 12 years and would never do a comedy again. He is quite funny in this film in which he plays a southerner with an accent for the only time in his life. Eleanor Parker matches him wit for wit with an equally amusing southern accent. This would be their third and final film together and the tabloids had a field day with it since he had just married his second wife, Ursula Thiess, days before filming and was having his honeymoon in the evenings in a cabin nearby while filming during the daytime. The fact that Parker and Taylor had been romantically involved less than a year earlier made this situation irresistible to reporters. (this is all mentioned in the first biography written about Taylor in 1973)  Needless to say, this circumstance brought people to this film when it was released. The chemistry between Taylor and Parker was real. The film that resulted is fun and filled with future television stars like James Arness, Alan Hale Jr., Russell Johnson, Darryl Hickman and Betty Lynn. There are some great fight scenes and delicious humor. It is wholesome and a good distraction from modern television.",1436745600,,1179,4.695652173913044

3423452,5,B00195I3OU,"I liked a lot this very silly, EXTREMELY entertaining, merry and cheerful 1955 western comedy. Below, more of my impressions, with some very limited SPOILERS.

IMPORTANT PRECISION: the title of this review is NOT a quote from the film - although it could be...)))

Somewhere just before year 1800, in Kentucky, a certain Bushrod Gentry (Robert Taylor), a real bear of a man, trapper by trade and eternal bachelor by conviction, meets a young, fierce maiden named Mary Stuart Cherne (Eleanor Parker). For reasons which cannot and will not be explained, Mary Stuart Cherne decides IMMEDIATELY that Bushrod Gentry will marry her and whatever may be his opinion on that matter - well, it doesn't matter! That is the beginning of the film and for the remaining 90 minutes Bushrod Gentry will learn IN THE HARDEST POSSIBLE WAY all the potential meanings of this old French saying: ""Ce que femme veut, Dieu le veut...""...))) And I am not saying anything more about the story...

Although in principle this is a western, in fact this film is much more a ""romantic comedy"" quite exactly like those played in XVII and XVIII century theatres across Europe. The scenario of this film would be easily recognized and maybe even claimed as one of theirs by both Pierre Beaumarchais (the author of the play ""Marriage of Figaro"") and Pierre Marivaux, author of so many merry, popular ""romantic comedies"", that even today, when the French want to describe games of love and seduction, they talk of ""marivaudages"".

OK, I may push here the things a little bit far, but I think even Shakespeare and Moliere could like this story and would probably not mind at all producing it in their theatres in London or Paris - and I can totally see Gogol seating amongst the public and taking notes for his, by moments slightly similar in its general lines, immortal mastepiece ""Marriage""...))) All those authors indeed explored to the bottom the various possible developments in the immortal battle of sexes between men and women - a fight which, unlike real war, doesn't have for ultimate purpose to kill but precisely the contrary, to create new life... And in this story we have a particularly amusing variation of this ancient, never ending monumental clash...

The situation in which a VERY reluctant bachelor is mercilessly, relentlessly pursued, even hounded by a determined, clever, cunning, resourceful (and not half-bad looking by the way) young woman who is hell-bent on getting married, come damnation, high water or both, is indeed full of possibilities for a GREAT comedy - and this film seized quite a lot of them...))) What makes things even better is that, being a daughter of XVIII century pioneers, Mary Stuart Cherne has at her disposition some special weapons and tactics, usually not available to Sheakespeare, Moliere, Beaumarchais and Marivaux characters, including but not limited to, Kentucky rifles, tomahawks, scalping knives, bear traps, frontier justice and whole tribes of blood-thirsty Indian warriors on murderous rampage...)))

Although this is mostly a long fight of wills, wits and wily tricks (and occasionally bullets) between Mary Stuart Cherne and Bushrod Gentry, there is place to some secondary characters, like Mary's father Cadmus Cherne (Victor McLaglen, excellent as always), Mary's unfortunate suitor Luke Radford (Alan Hale Jr.), Cherne's family old Indian servant Sandak (Ralph Moody) and last but not least Essau Hamilton, a very famous trapper and Indian fighter who is a kind of hero and role model for Bushrod Gentry (he is played by the gigantic actor James Arness, older brother of Peter Graves).

The film is very pleasantly rhytmed by the ""Berry Tree"" song:

""The higher up the berry tree
The sweeter grow the berries
The more you hug and kiss a girl
The more she'll want to marry!""

Now, granted, this is not some kind of immortal masterpiece, but this is nevertheless a really, REALLY ENTERTAINING, lighthearted, merry, cheerful film which doesn't take itself seriously even for one minute but instead offers tons of humour (some of it of slightly slapstick burlesque style - but mostly not) and a nice ending - and leaves us with a warm heart.

3423479,3,B00195I3OU,"Saul Chaplin's infectiously enjoyable title song for backwoods comedy Western Many Rivers to Cross - The Berry Tree, sung by Sheb Wooley, Mr Wilhelm Scream himself - sets you up for rollicking good time that the film doesn't quite deliver, yet the film doesn't disappoint despite starring Robert Taylor, who was probably about as well known for his comic talents as Lionel Barrymore was for tap dancing. In the same vein as 7 Brides for 7 Brothers - it even co-stars two of the Brothers, Russ Tamblyn and Jeff Richards - but without the songs (well, apart from that title number) and a dozen fewer suitors, it matches frontiersman Taylor with settler Eleanor Parker, who's intent on matrimony and has him in her sights after saving his life from a Shawnee raiding party. Much of it is more gentle and laidback, with Taylor's Bushrod Gentry coming across as something of a dry run for Glenn Ford's resourceful and independent character in The Sheepman without having quite as clever and subversive a script, yet there are more than enough laughs - especially in the two cave scenes - to keep things fun and friendly. And that song will be stuck in your head for weeks after.

3423500,5,B00195I3OU,"This movie is quite likeable, despite some major casting flaws.  Eleanor Parker as the leading lady is beautiful, but has an exaggerated accent that makes her acting seem completely fake.  Also, at times she has a most frighteningly deep voice, along the lines of Katherine Hepburn, except worse even.  The leading gentleman, in the form of Robert Taylor, is way past his prime.  And so to cast him as this man that the women of rural Kentucky find irresistable, requires quite a suspension of disbelief, even if he is the only new face in town.  However, overall, the storyline is a cute one.  The preacher only comes around once a year and so everybody has to get married when he comes, or else wait a whole more year.  Mary Stuart Cherne (Eleanor Parker) has her eyes set on Robert Taylor, except he wants to still lead a Bachelor man's carefree life, wandering the countryside trapping wild game.  She connives different ways to force his hand and none of them work.  Until he meets another fellow with a kindred spirit and starts to think twice about things.  The movie also features two cameos from cast members of Gilligan's Island, the skipper as Mary's local boyfriend, and the Professor as one of Mary's many brothers.

Although I am usually a huge Eleanor Parker fan (The Woman in White, etc) this film is just not superior  in any way. The cast is actually amazing, with Victor McLaglen, Rhys Williams, Sig Ruman, Josephine Hutchison, Russ Tamblyn and the uber handsome Robert Taylor, but the comedy is played much too broadly, the accents are not good, and the jokes are not very funny. The director is to blame for the problems in my opinion. It is obvious that he encouraged his cast to adopt  faux hillbilly accents which are uneven in delivery. The plot is not well executed either, and the pacing is choppy. Eleanor Parker states she has a plan to capture reluctant trapper Robert Taylor who clearly knows how to avoid being trapped himself. Her plans are not charming, coherent, or endearing, and she only attracts him when he works to save a toddler from the croup. Huh? As a curiosity, lots of '60s televison stars also wind up in the cast: James Arness (Matt Dillon from Gunsmoke), Alan Hale Jr(the skipper from Gilligan's Island), and Russell Johnson (the Professor from Gilligan's Island). Everyone has a bad day, and this was it for the cast and crew of this film. While I would recommend viewing it if it was on television just so one could see for oneself, I don't recommend buying it.

I adore Eleanor Powell & she is one of the most beautiful actresses I ever saw. Her acting ability is top-notch (watch The Detective Story and you will agree.) I also enjoyed watching her in Scaramouche and The Naked Jungle (kind of a hokey story, but entertaining, nonetheless). Robert Taylor - well, he was always quite a handsome guy, made some really great movies. But in this one, they didn't seem to have the spark between them they had before (like in Valley of the Kings!) They did have a fling in real life, so maybe this film was toward the end of their relationship. I don't know - they just didn't fit right - neither one of them.

MANY RIVERS TO CROSS (1955) is a lighthearted western comedy romp, which allowed the versatile Eleanor Parker to show yet another side of her amazing acting range.  She is very much one of the leading actors of her generation, yet criminally underrated because, as opposed to other stars of the period, she wanted to be an actress, instead of merely a personality--a big difference!  During her career, Parker built up an impressive gallery of characters, and earned Academy Award nominations for her work in ""Caged!"", ""Detective Story"" and ""Interrupted Melody"".  Most people sadly only know Parker from her role as the Baroness in ""The Sound of Music""; and while that's also one of her finer portrayals--and probably her most accessible movie--I'd urge people who haven't already to start their own journey of discovery in the films of Eleanor Parker.

Warner's DVD print for MANY RIVERS TO CROSS comes from the original Eastman Color filmstocks, and whilst the image is a little faded and fuzzy in spots (most Eastman and Ansco Color-processed titles sadly haven't aged as gracefully as Technicolor ones), it's still very watchable.  The only extra is the trailer.  Recommended.

This title is also available as part of Warner's Western Classics boxset collection, which also boasts another Eleanor Parker gem (""Escape from Fort Bravo""), in addition to ""The Law and Jake Wade"", ""Saddle the Wind"", ""The Stalking Moon"", and the 1960 remake of ""Cimarron"".",1246665600,5,1807,5.160958904109589

3423514,4,B00195I3OU,"So many good movies were made during the golden age of hollywood that some very good ones, such as this one, seem to have slipped through the cracks. Many Rivers to Cross is a fun movie featuring Robert Taylor as a determinedly bachelor woodsman who is pursued by Eleanor Parker's character who is determined to marry him. There is lots of adventure and romance with a happy ending -- all very well done and thankfully now available on DVD.",1228262400,,440,4.582278481012659

3423518,5,B00195I3OU,"I waited a long time for this movie to come out in DVD.  It was so worth the wait. Wonderfully written and acted.  I loved the way Eleanor Parker says, ""Bushrod"".  Robert Taylor is a good choice to play love 'em and leave 'em trapper ""Bushrod Gentry"" who tries to keep from getting ""trapped"" himself by a female who could have been Sarah Palin's great,great, great, great grandma.  Even the minor characters are fun and important to the story.  I watched this movie with my two grown daughters who had never heard of this movie.  They laughed all the way through it. It is a timeless, well-done film that the whole family can watch. Let me put it this way, if you liked ""The Quiet Man"" you'll like ""Many Rivers To Cross"".",1224028800,18,721,4.424242424242424

Bushrod Gentry, played by Robert Taylor, is excellent in fighting any opponent be it Indians or other foe.  But when Eleanor Powell comes along with marriage on her mind, she breaks down all his defenses. Although he does put up a mighty fight.  Hilarious and very entertaining.",1223164800,37,359,4.852459016393443
