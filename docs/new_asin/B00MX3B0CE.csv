6603859,5,B00MX3B0CE,"Dragon Ball Z Battle of Gods is here!
This movie has seen a theatrical release in both Japan and USA and has earned a lot of money in both areas.
And now for those who couldn't go to the theatre here is Dragon Ball Z English Dub version with the extended version of the movie which aired on FujiTV in Japan.

About: (Contains Spoilers)
This movie is set after the Majin Buu Arc. Beerus - the God of Destruction awakes after 39 years to find that the tyrannical almighty and all powerful Frieza was defeated by a Super Saiyan - Son Goku. He also had a vision that he would fight a 'Super Saiyan God' who would actually match his strength in battle. He sets of to find the Saiyans and ends up defeating Goku easily. He then targets Earth but stops due to Goku's request. Goku achieves Super Saiyan God level with the help of Shenron and his friends and the battle between Beerus Goku ends in a draw and in the end the fact was revealed that Beerus used only 70% of his power.

This movie has amazing picture quality and has been a thrill ride from beginning to end. This movie is a must watch for all DBZ fans and I am eagerly waiting to see the movie in English. I hope FUNimation has done a good job in dubbing it!",1408838400,2,1214,4.183760683760684

6603861,5,B00MX3B0CE,"Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods is the best Dragon Ball movie that I've ever seen.  If you didn't see it in US theaters, know that it holds up to the rest of the franchise, but on top of that there is an additional 20 minutes of extended scenes in this blu-ray that was not shown in theaters.  I liked it so much that I had to see it a second time.  DBZ Battle of Gods has a little bit of everything, so the best way to describe ""Battle of Gods"" is that it has the humor of Dragon Ball with the action of Dragon Ball Z.  It's also a very fun film that feels very nostalgic the entire way though, especially if you have been watching DBZ since it originally aired on Cartoon Network.
Also includes the Uncut Version and Theatrical Versions of the Movie.

6603868,1,B00MX3B0CE,"Great movies but if you're gonna watch the series, you're gonna have a bad time
some shows pick up and continue where the last ended, not here, the anime series repeats everything for twenty episodes.

6603871,4,B00MX3B0CE,"I'll keep it brief. The animations themselves are wonderful. Some really sequences in here. I really enjoyed the comedy of Beerus and Whis. They aren't typical DB baddies. In fact, they're not really evil at all. More neutral than anything. This movie is light years better than GT and the end of Z. I can see why they're basing the beginning of Super around this plot.",1507852800,,369,4.606060606060606

6603873,5,B00MX3B0CE,"I really needed to write a review of this movie.

Okay so pretty much this movie is about Vegeta on the verge of an anxiety attack about a cat god and his boyfriend who are obsessed with the food and tryna ruin Bulma's 38th birthday party and distroy the planet over a cup of pudding. There's really no good story flow, it's totally all over the place. And I'm pretty sure an abridged version happens in the series on a boat or something. That all being said it's one of the best dubbed animes I've ever seen. Flawlessly dubbed. Includes one liners such as: ""What's up your butt?"" said by Bulma to Vegeta. The amazing thing about Dragon Ball is that people who were fans as kids are now the ones working on it. And they are doing a fantastic job. It's perfect. If you're looking for a good hard core Dragon Ball action movie this isn't for you. But it's funny af and a totally satire of itself. I really enjoyed it and the ending has pretty good pay off. 10/10 would Dragon Ball again.",1506124800,,985,4.295698924731183

6603878,5,B00MX3B0CE,This is another great DBZ movie. I bought ti because it is broadcast in short 30 minute segments on Cartoon Network. I did find that Funamation did a big story redevelopment and what is on TV is different from the original movie.,1499040000,,229,4.476190476190476

6603882,5,B00MX3B0CE,"This new installment in a beloved anime has it all. Great art, fun character moments, awesome fights, and a great conclusion. Watch this before DB Super. It's really cool to see my introduction to anime making a comeback. If you liked DBZ, you will like this. Vegeta plays an AWESOME role in this story, showing just how far he's come since the old days. Just watch it. Seriously. WATCH IT!",1494633600,,390,4.585714285714285
6603883,3,B00MX3B0CE,"i was expecting more from this movie. while the action was good, it suffered from the same issue the original DBZ series had, which was too much talking! the action was in very small bursts which just kill it for me. while it was awesome to see and hear so many returning characters, only 2 had a chance to shine. those two were goku and vegeta. like the other z fighters were just useless. they didn't even really fight. in the end i think my review is fair, 3 stars for an ok movie. there was just too much comedy in this, it takes away from some of the seriousness in the film.",1493337600,,580,4.1415929203539825

6603889,4,B00MX3B0CE,"This movie is hilarious! It's the best DBZ movie made up to when this came out, but overall it is okay. None of the movies are ever that great. But it certainly is nice to see everyone back together battling to save the earth again and with 98% of the original english voice actors. That are some neat special features too, such as a segment where you watch the voice actors doing there thing while the movie plays in one corner of the screen. It is pretty funny to watch.

6603899,5,B00MX3B0CE,"DRAGONBALL Z
BATTLE OF GODS

I have always been a huge fan of Dragonball Z ever since its very first airing on Toonami way back in the day in like 1997 along with Mobile Suit: Gundam Wing. I of course always loved the films as well, well at least the animated ones. So when this was released I was so excited along with my brother. We both went out and bought it immediately. We then invited all of the homies and went to my brothers house for the viewing party. Of course we were all excited and ended up really enjoying it.

The story follows Beerus, the God of Destruction, who has been awakened to find out that Freeza was defeated by a Saiyan. He finds this very intriguing and decides to head to Earth to challenge this Saiyan himself. Once there he easily defeats Goku as well as the other Z fighters of Earth. It seems like there is nothing that can stop this being from destroying the Earth, well unless a legendary figure known as the Super Saiyan God can show up.

I really enjoyed this film as it was a super fun flick that really showed how great my favorite character is, Vegeta. It is in this film that his character is really shown, and I mean character of the man. He recognizes who  this creature is and puts all of that pride aside to make sure that Beerus does not get put in a bad mood. He wants to keep his family safe [especially since this is during his wifes birthday] and keep the planet he calls home safe. But even more than that when Goku powers up to a level 3 Super Saiyan he is defeated in a few blows by Beerus after hi cocky attempt to think he was on that level. But when Beerus slaps Bulma Vegta goes crazy and for a moment he takes it to the God of Destruction like nobody ever has. Is it short, sure, but for that short time I may have never been happier watching DBZ.

You get some great behind the scenes features on the Blu-Ray/DVD combo and like I said the film is a fun one. It also leads into the next film that would bring back one of the most popular villains the franchise has ever seen. I would highly recommend this film to any DBZ fan or even anime fan out there.",1471392000,,2113,4.156479217603912
6603900,4,B00MX3B0CE,This wasn't my favorite DBZ move but I'll give it four stars because it sets up the scene for Resurrection F.  The pacing felt more like some of the filler show that we are used to seeing rather than a dedicated movie.  It didn't do a good job of holding my attention but I am glad I watched it so that I understood what happens in the next movie.,1470960000,,347,4.0144927536231885

They have the extended version and theatrical version and both Japanese and English languages but the subtitles seem to be for Japanese only, while I usually like English [CC] options.

Overall as someone who does not really buy many Blu Ray movies, I am happy with this purchase.",1470268800,,444,4.414634146341464

What is so insulting is that they draw blue hair on ss1 and call it God? There is no secret that dbz has satan as earths hero and champion...but now playing with religious beliefs is not dbz. How do we go from a saiyan raised on earth to now he's god...its distasteful. And the movie sucks. Vegeta is never victorious and goku once again killed frieza with a kamehamea wave...just like the 1st time. Its lazy unoriginal and no amount of time travel or playing God will make this matter. Plus GT DID happen so ssj4 is the highest power not this trash..in fact this whole new approach is trash and they need to just make dragonball AF with ssj5. If you're a Godless person you won't be bothered by this..but the rest of us not liking the satanic trend of idol worship.

The character Beerus, Destroyer of Worlds, is an interesting character that only becomes fleshed out toward the end. However, the movie sets up some interesting threads for the future.",1450483200,,294,5.020408163265306
6603953,3,B00MX3B0CE,"Here's my movie review of the Extended Edition of Battle of Godz.

The intro is okay but a bit too long and a bit boring. Thus, it remains true to DBZ filler fashion. (At least we get to see Goku show off his SSJ forms).

The short fights everyone has with Beers are okay but Vegeta definitely has his moment. (Vegeta fans be warned, you will like his part in the movie. Some of you may see a new side of him).

Lastly, the Battle of Godz parts.
The transformation is good for movie standards, however, the fight that ensues with Goku a Saiyan God is rather disappointing. The only good thing about the Saiyan God battle is the change of sceneries. The settings are fantastic. But the movie does get better: the Goku SuperSaiyan fight is phenomenal.

Hope this has been helpful for you.

Have a great day.",1450224000,,805,4.375838926174497

6603957,1,B00MX3B0CE,"This movie was absolutely terrible. I love the series and most of the movies, but this was just plain awful. The storyline was unbelievable and difficult to watch. The characters were unbelievable and could not be taken seriously. And whoever did the math in this movie cannot count because the ages of the characters mentioned in the film have to be at least ten years off if you follow the timeline from Dragonball to current and consider how old Gohan and Videl have to be in the film. On another point, Funimation has had an issue for years with brand new discs being scratched right out of the box. This was no exception.

Now if any of you have seen any of those movies i'm sure you can agree they're all, ""okay"" they're Dragon Ball Z and thats about it no real point. Well this movie stands completely alone compared to all the other movies, its by far series quality. It was just amazing. You could feel the feeling that this was a little bit of a ""reunion"" movie as it was like catching up with old friends who you haven't seen in years, which is nice for returning fans. This movie had alot of humor, action and awesome animation, it literally lacked nothing! It was just great through and through but towards the end it kinda felt like they were pushing fighting because ""because fighting!! GAHH"" but none the less it was absolutely awesome! 100% worth the buy for any even slight fan of the DBZ franchise, even if you haven't seen DBZ in 10 years and this will be the first thing your watching you'll slip right back into this show with no problems at all!",1445299200,,1049,4.357142857142857

6603982,5,B00MX3B0CE,"I loved this movie.  I hadn't watched any Dragonball Z since the 90's when I was younger.  I recently was reminded of my times with it, and bought this blindly to have a taste of the old days.  It was even better than it was back then.

Compared to the Z series, this movie employs a lot more humor.  The light silliness was a pleasant surprise in contrast to the seriousness I remember the series somewhat carried itself with.  The action is still present, and better than ever.  I remember the movies generally keeping things moving, avoiding that trademark DBZ drawn out feel, and this one was paced perfectly for me.  It starts out making fun jokes of characters old and new, and then gets into the action DBZ is known for (sans the staring and breathing heavily).  It is also proper film length, unlike my recent re-watching of Dead Zone.  I didn't recall that one being under an hour from when I was younger.

Beerus and Whis are just great.",1441670400,,947,4.47953216374269

6603998,5,B00MX3B0CE,"It's been a long time sense any new ""Dragon Ball"" lore material has come out but Akira Toriyama certainly hasn't lost his talent. ""Battle of the Gods"" takes place after the defeat of Majin Buu at the end of ""Dragon Ball Z"" and introduces a far more interesting set of events then ""GT"" did which many, including myself, pretend never happens.

The new antagonist, Beerus, isn't really as much of a villain as he is simply a guy with a different perspective on how the universe should be run which introduces an interesting new perspective  and just goes to show the series doesn't always need all out corrupt, power hungry villains the heroes have to reach new levels to defeat. Unlike many previous DBZ movies that weren't done by Akira Toriyama, this one focuses more on just the fighting as you get to see a lot more social events and interaction taking place and nearly every side charter of ""Dragon Ball"" makes a returning appearance and have their moments. Rather it's Puar, Oolong, Ox King, Mr. Satan, Videl, exc. They're all in it along with the main cast of fighters, even that blue imp, Emperor Pilaf, along with his gang show up again. If you loved ""Dragon Ball"" back when it was big in America and want to revisit those nostalgic moments with new material, ""Battle of the Gods"" is worth seeing and has opened a new, exciting\ chapter to the lore.

The movie arrived faster than expected and was packaged effectively. The discs also have a fair share of side content worth seeing.",1438300800,,1490,4.636363636363637

6604050,5,B00MX3B0CE,"This is an awesome film that I watched since I watched Broly the Legendary Super Sayian. This film had an awesome fight and the same comedy from the series. This film takes place after the destruction of Kid Buu and years before Dragon Ball GT, Beerus, a lazy, gluttony, laidback, polite, and mischievous, but powerful cat alien from Vegeta's past aka the God of Destruction is awaken and he had one objective and that is to destroy. Beerus shows up to Earth and he wants to destroy it on one condition if he is not angered or annoyed. But, on one simple occasion, he is angered and he wants to destroy Earth and it is up to Goku to save Earth, but the only way to stop Beerus is the power of the legendary Super Sayian God. I gave this film a 5 star rating and I can't wait for the second Battle of the Gods film about Frieza's revenge in summer 2015.",1427155200,,852,4.233128834355829

Along with Shenron freaking the heck out.  When the movie gets serious though its done well the fights are well handled and though the heavy cgi for backgrounds is off putting its very well done.  They also call Hercule by his proper Mr Satan name in the movie.

6604073,5,B00MX3B0CE,"Just finished watching ""Dragon Ball Z - Battle of Gods"" released by Funimation through 20th Century Fox.
Now I am not a diehard ""Dragon Ball Z"" fan; yet I have seen several episodes from the various Dragon Ball Z series over the years and I did enjoy them for the lighthearted approach they took over serious life and death struggles.
I found myself enjoying  ""Dragon Ball Z - Battle of Gods"" because it contained on in the same vein as the various anime television series.
Beerus - the God of Destruction - awakens from one of his extremely LONG naps to check on a prophecy told to him by the seer fish about a being known as the Super Saiyan God who pocesses the power to defeat him in combat.
Naturally being curious, because Beerus is a cat-like diety, Beerus leaves his nap planet to seek out this Super Saiyan God - and runs into Goku - who just happens to be training off a a miniature planet far, far away from Earth.
Unfortunately for Earth, Beerus has been told by the Seer Fish that the Super Saiyan God who can defeat him can be found on - yep, you guessed it - Earth.
After giving Goku a through pounding, at his own request, Beerus heads for Earth where he promises to destroy Earth unless he is bested in combat.
Unfortunately for Earth, nobody knows anything about a Super Saiyan God, except for...now that would be giving away a SPOILER....;)
Great Fun!

6604079,5,B00MX3B0CE,"Initially when I heard there would be a new DBZ movie out I was indifferent; having been a hardcore fan of DBZ and being completely disgusted with GT I didn't have high expectations for the fresh movie...And then Toriyama happened this is by far the best DBZ movie to date and in my personal opinion is the right way to stray away from GT... SSJ God> SSJ4 I'm sorry I'm just going to say it. Going into this movie I  had no idea that I was going to love it so much and that if feel it would be a 10/10 I literally watch it for bed every night ... Now Ive watched all of Dragonball Z about 3-4 times over in the past 4 years... Having said that when I hear complaints about the movie;  all the time people say there wasn't enough action in it. Whilst this can be perceived as true for a film with DBZ in the title.. When watching the movie  I never notice any problem with the action(I've watched fully through about 8 times), also I see all the nostalgia that this movie provides.. In my mind from a 17 YEAR BREAK its a perfect return yes 17 YEARS!!! Sometimes when Im watch this movie I like imagining I'm seeing it 17 years after the end of Z. Some of the moments can bring a tear of joy to your eye...For instance a moment that always makes me happy is when Goku looks at King Kai and tells him ""Well I heard the part of him being the strongest, and I can't wait""! And he gets a big grin on his face. This movie is the start of something fantastic Toriyama has so much to build on now that he has made himself a brick foundation. With Fukkatsu No F right around the corner(Frieza's my fav villain;)) I am completely confident the movie will be impressive With AT at the helm..

In conclusion this movie is a 10/10 if you loved DBZ you will watch this movie mouth watering and all... In fact if you like a Dragon Ball even a little give this movie a try, doubt you will regret it:). Thank you for reading my review",1424822400,,1916,4.114973262032086

And in that time, I have seen a lot of releases for this series come and go, some that were successful, some that failed, but this one is definitely among the best that I have seen. Dragon Ball Z: Battle of the Gods is by far, in my opinion, the best Dragon Ball Z movie to date. It had everything that you could ask for. A good storyline, great characters, humor and epic fight scenes! What more could you ask for? I won't lie, there is a lot of talking and humor in this and the fight scenes are minimal but when they come they as I said epic and memorable. =)",1423612800,,717,3.9178082191780823

6604135,5,B00MX3B0CE,"Okay, let me just start by saying that considering that this movie came out 19 years AFTER the last one (Wrath of The Dragon), it holds up to be one of the best in the entire movie series. This movie has the perfect blend of action & comedy and includes practically every main character from the Dragon Ball Z franchise AS WELL as a few from Dragon Ball.  The animation and blend of 2d and 3d were phenomenal. The action was top notch, and although I'm a huge fan of original voice acting, the english dub was better IMO just because of the delivery of the jokes and how amazing the voice acting was in this movie. Sean Shemmel & Chris Sabot definitely earned their keep in it. The storyline of the movie was also very well done. The incorporation of the events that happened in the series was put in just enough to give you a brief reminder of what happened if you haven't watched the series since it ended many moons ago. That being said, this movie is definitely one for the fans. The additional footage was mainly in the beginning to describe what Dragon Ball/Dragon Ball Z is, which if you're not a fan then you wouldn't be watching this, and if you are, then you've seen the entire series which would make the majority of the additional footage redundant. Also, it doesn't do THAT great of a job describing who/what each character is, and like I mentioned earlier, they're all there - even the Kai's & Mr. Satan. There are also a lot of references to the series which  makes the movie THAT much better. On that note, this does not follow the GT series (something that was done intentionally), so there is no SSJ 4 (something that I am also thankful for). With all of that being said, and without giving out any spoilers, this movie is definitely worth the purchase.

6604141,5,B00MX3B0CE,"It was awesome too see something new from DBZ. Its been a while. It felt like when I was a kid. Great to hear all the original Funimation voice actors got on board again. The movie was great. The vibe is still the same even though its been a while. The chemistry is still the same. There was not so much fighting in this movie because I think this movie was more of an intro for brand new movies and other things, but it was still just great to see something brand new from DBZ. You can tell just by watching the film and hearing the dialogue, DBZ is back and they got brand things cooked up. Highly recommended if you are a diehard DBZ fan.",1419465600,,641,4.095238095238095

6604145,5,B00MX3B0CE,"I like the movie, but there is an overuse of CGI. It's incredibly distracting, and does not blend it at all with the 2D animation. Other than that, this feels more like a shortened season than it does a movie. Nothing really ""movie worthy"" happens in this movie we haven't seen before. We have the Earth threatened to get destroyed a million times before. You could easily break this up into 4 episodes, and it would have been an entire shortened season. But the movie was fun. Not one I would watch over and over, but a good, enjoyable 100 minutes. And that's all I can ask for in a movie. So far that, I give it 5 stars.",1419292800,,622,4.235294117647059

6604155,5,B00MX3B0CE,"Really enjoyed this movie! Funny and action packed just like the Dragonball series is known for. It's great for real DBZ fans to re introduce everyone to the series. It's more of a reunion with a touch of the usual DBZ action. I recommend this movie only to people who truly know DBZ. Others may say ""not enough fighting"" ""a lot of filler scenes"" but that's not what it's about. It's them bringing back the series and with a bang. Maybe not even with a new season but just by movies like Neon Genesis: Evangelion is doing. I have no problem with it. Really looking forward to the next movie.",1418774400,,591,4.381818181818182
6604156,4,B00MX3B0CE,"The bluray is great but super saiyan god is just glorified kaio-ken...most disappointing. The original god form was like ss4 but with golden fur. I would of prefered that. I hope this forces a reboot for gt. I can't wait for the next movie, I hear vegeta will have more of a roll. This movie is a must see proving DragonBallz is back and at full power.",1418688000,,352,4.268656716417911

6604159,4,B00MX3B0CE,"I enjoyed this movie. The fighting scene was a bit of a let down. I thought the Frieza fight was way better than this fight. Overall, it is a good movie, but too much hype for something that doesn't give much when compared to other fights in the series. Also, this is more of a packaging review, but the DVD box was damaged at the back top-end of the movie. I want my movies to be in top notch condition.",1418515200,,404,4.0625
6604160,5,B00MX3B0CE,"Dragon ball z Battle of the Gods movie takes place after the defeat of Kid BUU. This is not a made up story, this story actually fits in the DBZ storyline 100%. Akira Toriyama did a fantastic job on this film. This film was actually released in U.S theaters across the nation. This was my first anime I ever watched on the big screen and I am proud it was DBZ! This filmed was the highest grossed theatrical anime in japan of all time, it was also the very first full length anime feature film to be released in theaters. Way to go DBZ, it sold really well in japan and did pretty well here since it was only release for 1 week only in U.S(Aug 5th,6th,7th, & 9th and only had one showing each, most were not good times either) Dbz fans can rejoice and join again on an exciting new Dragon ball Adventure. The sequel comes out 2015 in japan. This is a must watch. This Extended edition comes with a jam packed 20mins of extended footage, that is extremely rare. Most films that come out with extended only add a few mins to the Home video Release. It almost feels like a Directors cut in a way. It comes with the theatrical trailer as well. This is a region 1 funimation blu ray dub. This item shipped in brand new condition and arrived on time.",1418428800,,1244,4.23109243697479

6604163,4,B00MX3B0CE,This movie is wacky. I understand they were trying to make this a funny movie and it was. I just wish this was a more serious movie. Also the way goku becomes ssg is weird. Besides that the graphics are awsome and its nice to see the dbz family again. I thinks its awsome that they are adding more to the amazing story of Dragonball z.,1418342400,,335,4.090909090909091

6604165,4,B00MX3B0CE,"The animation and voice-acting are superb, but the story falls flat on its face compared to the previous 13 DBZ movies (excluding the Trunks and Bardock movies).  Still, it's a great twist in the character's development and fun to watch.",1418256000,,237,4.925

6604167,5,B00MX3B0CE,"The best DBZ movie that has ever come out, this movie is one of the longest as well. While most other DBZ movies are about 60 minutes, I felt like this one was close to 2 hours, and I enjoyed every second of it. The Blue Ray also looks and sounds great, it has a very modern feel. Also, they got a really good blend of action and humor. There's enough fighting going on to keep you interested, and the humor helps break the tension.",1417996800,,432,4.094117647058823

6604169,1,B00MX3B0CE,"I am a huge dbz fan.  I'm not one of those fan boys who criticizes the edits, the dubbing, aspect ratios, etc.  I'm a fan of the epic fights.  I read the original manga, so I appreciated the recent kai series for cutting out all the filler that dbz is notorious for.  This movie is straight filler.

The positives are that the voice acting and actors are pretty much in tact with some changes in the cast that might annoy long time fans.  The animation is top notch as well.

The negatives are that this is pretty much a filler you're movie.  Bad comedy, weak story, with a cop out resolution and very minimal action.  Very.  Minimal. Action.  I'm very disappointed in myself for buying this before reading reviews.

This movie might appeal to fans who just love all things Dragon ball, but to those who love the struggle for power and the ridiculous fights, this movie is not for you.  Or for me.",1417910400,6,897,4.396341463414634
6604170,3,B00MX3B0CE,"If you are a DBZ fan.  Buy it.  You will accept the story and move on.  Not much action.  Story was a little like some of the ""filler"" in the complete DBZ series.

Vegeta singing and dancing was the worst part. I just wished they would stop with filler and spend more time being serious. Anyway, I'm still a fan and love the fight scene's so I will continue watching the movies as long as they make them.

For those who never accepted goku as there personal Lord and savior than they need to go to the church of goku and repent for there sins and ask goku to mold them into a better being.

For those who don't know but Akira toriyama is the creator of Dragon ball z and he is currently making a sequel to battle of gods and if the sequel does good he may continue the manga that's why we got to support Dragon ball to the fullest.",1416700800,,495,3.98989898989899
6604195,5,B00MX3B0CE,"I remember waking up at six o'clock in the morning to watch Dragon Ball Z back in the 90s. Those thirty minute episodes were like gold to me. I played the video games and watched the movies. When Z ended, I tuned into GT. Today I saw Battle of Gods and felt like I got sent back through time. I laughed like a kid, rewound the film on my DVR several times, and plan on watching it again tonight. This movie was the best 85 minutes of TV I watched this week and well worth my $4.95. All that nostalgia in something new can't be matched. I'm so glad Akira Toriyama is back on to make some more Dragon Ball stuff, and I can't wait for what's next. I'm so upset I was so late to the party. This was released in 2013 and 2014 is nearly over. Yet, I'm happy that even though I don't watch many cartoons in my adulthood, I always search and re-watch the old shows that made me happy as a kid--act like a dork-- and imagine I was a Super Saiyan etc, etc, etc... And since there's more planned for Dragon Ball, I'll keep an eye on it.

Battle of Gods was flat out funny. Beerus was hilarious as the God of Destruction. He and Whis, his attendant, who is later revealed to be his master, liked food as much as Goku did. Like Goku, Beerus was looking to finally face a strong opponent. One strong enough to challenge his godly powers. He had a vision and it was Goku, or someone who looked like him. Fun stuff. To think, he had a vision of a Super Saiyan God had me on the edge of my seat. Well I was actually under my blanket on the couch, wondering how Super Saiyan God would play out. I held on to my blanket as I laughed like a little kid and said ""holy crap,"" as Beerus beat the crap outta Goku with two blows. Sue me. I'm a dork. I don't have a bad thing to say about this awesome anime. Full of laughs, my favorite characters, and some kick ass action. Any Dragon Ball fan will love this film. Anyone who loves anime will get a kick out of this. Literally.",1416700800,,1952,4.05699481865285

6604202,5,B00MX3B0CE,"It's pretty good! The Bluray visuals were awesome and the subs were spot on. I haven't gotten the chance to see the extended edition, but I had fun watching the xtras.

I will make this warning though, if you're into the beat em up, power levels, mode changing Dragonball Z, you might have a harder time getting through this movie being that it takes time explaining whats going on and introducing the characters. That's how Akira Toriyama wanted it to be and I think that's a good thing. Sometimes you need to just sit back and enjoy the ride. The comedy is funny, storyline is built well, and fight scenes are phenomenal. I recommend finding 2 hrs and grabbing a bucket of popcorn or Pocky (your choice) and enjoy the movie.

Summary:

Lord Beerus has awaken from his slumber and with his friend/attendant Whis, they talk about the events that went on. Beerus finds out that one of the evil overlords that he was betting on becoming the strongest was beaten by a Saiyan, lol a supposedly low level one no less. So he decides to check out this guy that took out his #1 pick. After that, it's all fun and games, well until Beerus decides to test this Saiyan or else he'll blow up the planet. And being that he's a being higher than the Supreme Kai, the Z fighters better be on their A game cause even Shenron won't be able to save them this time!",1416441600,,1346,4.397590361445783

6604214,3,B00MX3B0CE,"I'm 30 now and I've followed Dragon Ball from the very beginning. It's been a while since they've made any new episodes or movies, so when I saw the trailer for this, I was pretty pumped. I saw Goku hit super saiyan 4 in Dragon Ball GT, so when I heard that he was going to become a super saiyan god, I had to see it. I thought it had the potential to be the best Dragon Ball story yet. However...I ended up having mixed feelings. I'll start with the positives. The animation is beautiful. All of the saiyans get in on the fight, even the kids. The bad guy, Lord Beerus, is by far the most powerful foe they've ever encountered. Goku goes super sayian 3 and Beerus basically destoys him in seconds without even trying. On to the negatives. This movie was borderline boring. The entire thing is full of stupid stupid comedy. Even Shenron was acting like an idiot. The whole movie feels very lighthearted. Beerus is literally on the verge of destroying Earth multiple times, but it never feels that serious. It seems like they're all just playing around the whole time. I remember times on Dragon Ball when I was on the edge of my seat with my eyes wide open. Like when Goku went super saiyan for the first time. He screams at Freeza, ""ally to good! Nightmare to you!"" And then pounds his face in. Or when Gohan blows cell away. Battle of the Gods has none of that. It's very toned down. One other thing that annoyed me is that they totally disregard Dragon Ball GT. They act like it never happened. Super saiyan 4 doesn't exist in this movie. If you're a Dragon Ball fan, you still have to watch this movie, just don't get your hopes up.",1416009600,3,1636,4.3322475570032575

6604227,5,B00MX3B0CE,"DBZ returns baby! It also does so with something extra sweet and satisfying, and that is this movie is from Akira Toriyama, and its canon to the manga series negating GT. Lord Beerus is a welcomed edition to the Dragon Ball cast! In fact I like him more than Goku himself. If you are a fan of Z for nostalgia and some great animations along with some superb voice acting get this edition of the movie. It also came in quickly for me.

However if you are hoping for planetary destruction, don't like much talking, and comedy this is not for you. You might as well go watch the anime which tends to drag out its fights with the same scenes over and over again.

This movie is a great addition and is now my all time favorite. I cannot wait for the sequel coming Spring 2015! Dragon Ball Z is back and Z forever!",1415577600,,809,4.212903225806452

6604231,3,B00MX3B0CE,"Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods was released in Japanese theaters in 2013. The film had a brief American theatrical run in August of 2014 through FUNimation and Twentieth Century Fox, and was subsequently given a home video release in October of 2014. The film is available as a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack (reviewed here), and a standalone DVD set.

In the mid 1990s and early 2000s, there was a major boom in the interest in Japanese anime and manga in the United States. It can be argued that the series that spearheaded this movement was Dragon Ball. Based on a manga written by Akira Toriyama that began in 1984, the series was massively popular in Japan, with the original manga running for over a decade! When the Dragon Ball Z anime series aired on Cartoon Network in the late 90s and for several years thereafter as a part of the Toonami block, much of that popularity and enthusiasm the series had enjoyed in Japan came over to America, with the show finding a new and diverse fanbase.

For the unfamiliar, Dragon Ball is the story of Son Goku, initially a young boy living alone in the woods, raised by his grandfather, who taught him martial arts. A few years following his grandfathers death, he meets a girl named Bulma who comes to him, searching for something called the Dragon Balls  mystical items that can grant the user any wish they desire if they bring all seven together. Goku leaves his home behind, having never known anything else of the world. Over time he goes on adventures, searching for the Dragon Balls, but despite the title of the series, it is not long before the emphasis tends to change. Over the years Goku grows up, fighting numerous enemies, making new friends, and even eventually starting a family of his own. Threats Goku battles initially range from earthbound foes like pests with dreams of world domination and armies that want to conquer and kill anyone in their way, to extraterrestrial and genetically engineered beings that serve as even larger menaces.

The appeal of the Dragon Ball franchise is universal for a number of reasons. You have interesting, three-dimensional characters, action scenes that are amongst the best of any animated series, and gripping, involving storylines that will often leave you wondering what is coming next. Children love the show for the colorful characters, humor, and animation, while adult fans find themselves drawn in by the depth and character evolution over the course of time. The series is not perfect and does have its share of flaws (it does feel severely dated in places), but as a whole it has stood the test of time better than many other anime series.

When the show was still in production, Toei Animation (the company responsible for adapting Toriyamas manga to television) also created a number of Dragon Ball Z movies on the side. These are essentially side stories that deviate from the main plot, but contain their share of interesting tales, battles, and characters that are not a part of the main series (and in some cases, had nothing to do with Toriyama at all). In recent years a few new ones have been made. Battle of Gods, the latest film in the world of Dragon Ball, is a major exception to this rule, because not only was Toriyama directly involved in its creation, but it is intended to fit in the series timeline, following the final major manga battle of the Z series.

Battle of Gods picks up a few years after the ultimate battle that concluded the last major story arc in Dragon Ball Z (but takes place before the ten years later coda that actually ends the series). Beerus, the God of Destruction, a celestial being who maintains order by destroying worlds around the universe when necessary, has awakened from a lengthy slumber, with premonitions that he will be fighting someone known as a Super Saiyan God. Naturally, he and his attendant Whis visit Earth, to see if any of the surviving Saiyans know anything about this mysterious being. It quickly becomes clear that Beerus, who has his desires set on destroying the planet to restore balance, far outclasses any of the Z Fighters  even Goku in his Super Saiyan 3 form is swiftly defeated without a challenge! Will they discover the mystery of the Super Saiyan God, or is Earth once more doomed for the inevitable?

No one is a bigger fan of the Dragon Ball franchise than this fan right here, however I will be the first to admit that the new movies/specials/etc. that have been coming out have been fairly lackluster and feel more like fan service pieces than coherent, decent standalone movies. When I heard Akira Toriyama was coming on board to create a new movie that was actually meant to be a part of the official series continuity, though, I naturally hoped for the best. Unfortunately, Battle of Gods, despite being a well intentioned piece of Dragon Ball cinema, ultimately falls flat. The film is not without its redeeming qualities, but as a whole it is something only the biggest Dragon Ball fans will enjoy.

Let me start by saying, if you have never seen Dragon Ball in any shape or form and are not familiar with the franchise in the least, DO NOT START HERE. The movie expects you to know who the characters are and what they have been through, leading up to the events of this film. Someone who has never seen Dragon Ball before is going to be left tilting their head in confusion. A certain scene of a character humiliating and embarrassing himself on a stage to amuse Beerus during his visit to Earth will be laugh out loud hilarious and unexpected to fans of the franchise but not to anyone else.

This Dragon Ball fan also cannot help but feel that the filmmakers went a little overboard with the humor here. Dragon Ball Z was the sequel to the original Dragon Ball, and it generally continues in the same, more serious and dire direction that the original Dragon Ball took on near the end. While I would not say that this movie quite reaches the sheer ridiculousness of the first saga of the original Dragon Ball, some moments come close. In the original series this would have been a good, laugh worthy time. But in a movie meant to serve as something of a coda to Dragon Ball Z, it just feels inappropriate and out of place.

The movie suffers from pacing problems galore. At 85 minutes, and 105 minutes in its extended form, it is far longer than any other Dragon Ball movie or special. The problem here is that it did not need to be! Many Dragon Ball movies are roughly half this length and tell a far more compelling story that combines action, drama, and humor alike. The first half of the movie drags needlessly, and not much happens. There are also far too many subplots and secondary characters on the side that get wasted, hardly put to use at all (even the older side story movies would generally not throw every single character into one movie). One subplot in particular, involving a return of some of the villains from the very first Dragon Ball saga, results in a few laughs, but ultimately just ends up feeling like filler to pad out the run time. Once the big battle gets going in the latter half of the movie, we definitely see some exciting stuff. The problem is you have to sit through a lot of padding to get there. The extended cut really adds nothing of substance to the movie; most of the extra scenes aside from the extended introduction are just further humorous, comic relief scenes, which the movie had enough of already. Naturally, I prefer the more concise theatrical cut.

That said, you may be wondering if I actually LIKED anything about this movie. Perhaps as a Dragon Ball fan I am being a bit too harsh here. The action is fantastic once it gets underway, and the conclusion to it all is certainly satisfying, with a few things you might not even be expecting here and there! Its a Dragon Ball movie through and through, and the die-hards will love getting to reconnect with all of their favorite characters. That said though, despite the redeeming qualities and the more positive attributes of the movie, I can still recommend Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods to the most established of Dragon Ball fans only. If you are new to the franchise or curious, go buy the Season Sets instead (you can actually get those for pretty good prices on sites like Amazon).

The animation quality, for the most part, is pretty smooth, colorful, and well detailed, but almost feels a little too gimmicky at times. At times it feels like the filmmakers are throwing in computer aided 3D animation and effects just for the sake of putting them on screen. Fortunately, this translates well to the Blu-ray Disc, and throughout the movie, you will generally be impressed by the image quality, aside from the few of the effects shots that look a bit fuzzy or murky.

Like most FUNimation Dragon Ball DVDs, this one includes an English language audio track, as well as a Japanese language audio track that has English subtitles. Initially, after being introduced to the native language version of Dragon Ball, I grew to hate the juvenile, often inaccurate dialogue of the dubbed version and many of the inappropriate voice actors. Fortunately, in recent years, FUNimation seems to have rectified many of their past wrongs. The English voice cast and the script writers have really stepped up their game, as you likely saw on the Dragon Ball Z Kai Blu-rays if you are already a fan. That holds true with Battle of Gods; the English voice cast gives what may be their best performance yet, even if a number of characters are largely relegated to the sidelines. I still tend to gravitate towards the original Japanese voice cast, but if you cannot stand to read subtitles you will be more than satisfied with the dubbed version here. The sound effects and everything else come through crystal clear, and my subwoofer even got a little bit more of a punch that I have experienced from any Dragon Ball related DVD or Blu-ray before.

FUNimation has even included a few bonus features, but these are mostly throwaways. The bulk of the extras let you view the English voice cast behind the scenes, and you also get a textless version of the end credits music, and an English language trailer for the movie. There are also assorted trailers for other FUNimation anime titles.

The problem I have with the bonus features is that this is a WASTED OPPORTUNITY. There are likely a ton of JAPANESE trailers for the movie that would have been nice to have on here as extras. And why no interviews with the original Japanese crew, or memorials/remembrance featurettes for the members of the Japanese cast who have passed away? (Im sad to say there are quite a few.) The biggest offender here, however, is that the movies/specials unreleased on an American DVD/Blu-ray, are not included here as bonus features. Namely, I am referring to Goku and His Friends Return, Episode of Bardock, and Plan to Eradicate the Super Saiyans. This would have been the perfect opportunity to give them a release in an American package (their exclusion here may be due to the fact that no English dubs exist, but I would have settled for Japanese voices with subtitles only.) Even the latter special was included on a recent video game release with subs only, and no English audio. I like that FUNimation did include some supplements here, but there was so much more that could have been included. Omitting these three specials which have yet to see the light of day in America is a disappointment, but does leave me optimistic that we may be getting a proper FUNimation release for them eventually.

Usually, this is the part of the review where someone would make an Over 9000 joke, but I will just recap the obvious. If you are a die-hard Dragon Ball fan already in love with the series, this package is a no brainer, even if the film itself is a little underwhelming and the supplements are weak. If you are a new fan or curious about the series, though, go buy the season sets; Battle of Gods is definitely NOT the place to start your Dragon Ball journey. In the simplest terms possible, this release comes recommended for established fans only.",1415232000,10,12119,4.676829268292683

6604264,3,B00MX3B0CE,"Remember ""Dragon Ball Z?""  Of course you do.  ""GT"" was a rushed flop, ""Kai"" was an attempt to bastardize the franchise even more, and ""Dragon Ball"" was less than ""Z"" in every aspect.  So we've returned to what works... more ""Z.""

Unfortunately it's just another installment in their films.  A new villain, a new level of power, each character getting a cameo-assist, the same fights, same build up, etc.  I'm a DBZ fan so that's ok.  I can watch them regurgitate the sane formula forever.  But with such a long hiatus, enduring years of crappy versions of Dragon Ball, I set my hopes a little too high.

The CG integration did some good and did some harm.  One of the great things about DBZ was that the fireballs, planet-eating-blast-what-have-you, were drawn and the line quality increased the drama of the movements and explosions (like Manga).  Now, they are lineless, oversaturated polygons that resemble a Playstation 3 game.

The backgrounds, however, look rich and offer a 3-D version of the nostalgic world you know so well.  This also allowed the battles to spin and arc in ways it hadn't before.

All in all, if you're a long time ""Dragon Ball Z"" fan, reviews are irrelevant... you'll watch it anyways.  If you're tight on cash though, you might want to save yourself the purchase.  This isn't even close to a next chapter, just another fun romp with the ""Z"" gang.

6604279,3,B00MX3B0CE,"The blu ray quality and English Voice acting is awesome and crystal clear. Awesome animation. Comes with 3 discs total in a slip in case. The extra 20 minutes is over hyped. You could barely notice the extra scenes from the theatrical version. The extra features were few (30 minutes) but entertaining. First DVD is the Theatrical Version, Second DVD is uncut version, and 3rd disc is the Blu Ray with both Uncut and Theatrical on one bluray disc. BUT...the film itself is okay. Just too much needless comedy and not enough action. Mostly all the characters except for Goku were neglected. The action picks up towards the very end. I suppose this film is meant to be more nostalgic than anything else but still... was a bit of a let down.",1412985600,,738,4.598484848484849

When the main antagonist,  Birus,  showed up,  I was very interested in how the movie would progress with this odd new character.  Numerous times during the movie I wanted to just cut it off.
  Yes,  it has a some comedy,  the art is good,  and it's fun seeing the old characters.  However,  it was so very boring.  It picked up just a bit near the end,  but overall it was a drag.  The characters seemed quite a bit more stupid than ever before. Also,  in this movie it's Goku, Goku,  Goku.  The other fighters' fights barely lasted longer than a blink of the eye.  I'd still buy it and watch it because it's Dbz,  but don't expect to be blown away.",1412985600,,753,4.090277777777778

If you're looking for super action packed, this movie will hold a little of those expectations, but if you're looking for the old comedic adventure of the old gang/characters, then this is the movie for you. I've loved Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z since I was little, so this brought me a lot of laughs and old memories. Worth the buy, LOVE IT!!",1412985600,,588,4.4036697247706424

6604292,5,B00MX3B0CE,"A great birthday present, and it lived up to most of the hype. A shame it was released in theatres in America for only a few days. The basic plot is that due to a dream, Lord Beerus, the odious God Of Destruction, awakens. He's disturbed and worried that an opponent of massive strength rivals that of his own and he begins searching the Universe for the one he dreamed of, the Super Saiyan God. Along with his partner, Whis, they eventually pinpoint the source of the legend and the adventure begins!

The movie is a blast from the past, basically mixing the new style of intensity of the Dragonball Z series and mixing it harmoniously with the comical whiles of the original Dragonball. The bad news is that if you're expecting a fight that lasts for many episodes you may be disappointed. But the good news is far greater! You get to see most of the original characters at least at some point in the show which allows the show to score rather big on the nostalgia scale. I've seen the film in Japanese subtitles and have now seen it in English. The voice acting is HILARIOUSLY done for Beerus in any language while the calm and subtle Whis tsakes a few comical jabs as well. Let me describe the new characters below...

Beerus. Obviously the main antagonist, he's different from the others who fight Goku in that for all his power, he's not evil in the slightest. As a destroyer of worlds in charge of maintaining the Universe he basically views the extermination of a planet as little more than a job. He's a large anthropomorphic purple cat resembling a cross between a Cornish Rex and an ancient Egyptian deity! Personality wise, he gets angry almost randomly at the slightest thing such as not getting a pudding cake, yet when Vegeta hits him with everything he's got Beerus calmly flies away as if nothing were amiss. Go figure. He's charming, strong willed, and even playful and friendly and has a great deal of respect for those beneath him and enjoys a good joke or a gag. Relaxed and even humorously cranky at times, he's generally hard to peg as a true 'villain'. A large amount of the humor in this movie is derived from the sheer number of odd facial expressions Beerus makes. From going to mind blowing furious to going bug-eyed from consuming a hot wasabi roll, these are but two of the myriad ways Beerus expresses himself! Oh, I won't spoil the movie by writing too much about the ending! let's just say that it appears Beerus and Whis have a bit more in mind for Goku than a fight. Hopefully all will be revealed in Dragonball Z, Battle Of God's 2 which is currently in production!

Whis is a tall, mostly human-like person with a calm, polite butler-like personality who's always cheery and nothing seems to bother him. He's got light blue skin, an almost effeminate face, white hair that stands almost straight up, and he wears a multicolored robe and sports a magic wand endowed with many unusual powers. Whis is about as carefree a character you could ever imagine. At first he seems to merely be a servant/friend of Beerus, but later in the film he's revealed as being almost twice as powerful as Beerus and serves as a full-time body guard. The slight implication is this. If Beerus needs a body guard THAT powerful he either has enemies after him or has a weakness someone wants to exploit. It's even implied ever so subtly that both are looking for someone to take over being the God Of Destruction which leaves new ground to explore in the film currently in production.

As for the movie, it's stunning visuals and animation are almost flawless. The only complaint is that during the final battle things are moving by so fast it makes it hard to see what's going on! The animators truly made it appear as if the fighters were moving at incalculable speeds and made it to where every single frame looked great!

I should also point out that the Super Saiyan God was a bit of a disappointment. Normally when Goku reaches another level his overall appearance changes in a big way. More muscular, longer hair, linear face, blue eyes. The Super Saiyan God sports red hair, red eyes and gives goku a much smaller and sleeker look than previous models. One of the few flaws of this film.

I wouldn't give the move a solid 10 out of 10, but an 8.5 out of 10",1412812800,,4278,4.527813712807244
6604293,5,B00MX3B0CE,"I've been a fan of dragonball z for as long as I can remember. I grew up on it and I still enjoy it. I got my copy today and just got done watching it. I thought it was great! I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has all the characters in it.. alot of interesting dialogue that adds to the legends of the saiyans..i thought it was hilarious at times.. i read a review that said it wasn't very action packed and he was dissapointed..... I can KINDOF see why he said that but that's only because the villain is so strong the fights don't last long until the last one, lol. This movie has great action but so much more is included...  If you're like me you will appreciate and love this movie because it brings you back to your childhood with NEW dbz! The animation looks amazing and there's some great effects.. you will love learning more history and seeing more things ""connect"" to each other. If you are a dbz fan you will enjoy this..

Get this movie I got Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods (Extended Edition) (Blu-ray/DVD Combo) on the day it came out on Amazon.

6604295,5,B00MX3B0CE,"Even after a decade or so, Dragon Ball Z is still capable of punching you in the face and reminding you why it is easily one of the most popular Anime/Cartoon in existence.

The story is nothing different than what you would expect. New super powerful enemy, Goku gets his ass beat by said enemy, and then proceeds to push himself beyond the limits to save the world. The difference here is that Beerus the Destroyer is an excellent antagonist. He dominates the movie with his sheer personality.

The writing itself goes out of its way to make a near parody style storytelling. Conveying that the writers realize that when restarting a decade old series, people MIGHT not take it seriously. Best way to counter that? ROLL WITH IT. And my god do they roll with it. I absolutely love this direction they decided to take.

If you like Dragon Ball Z, I see no reason why you will not enjoy this movie.",1412726400,11,897,4.49079754601227
6604296,5,B00MX3B0CE,"Firstly, I'd like to address some common questions.

1. Yes, this movie is dubbed in English with the original TV cast of Dragon Ball Z.

2. Yes, if you prefer the original subbed Japanese version it's also included in this release.

3. The extended ""uncut"" version adds a whole 20 minutes of footage to the film and runs 1 hour and 45 minutes.

Now for the actual review; I saw this film twice in theaters during it's theatrical run and bought the Blu-ray day one.

Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods is the first new Dragon Ball Z film in over 17 years. The story and characters within the film were created by the creator of the series, Akira Toriyama. This is by far the best Dragon Ball Z film yet and is honestly a love letter to fans. I won't spoil the story, but I will say this film takes place a few months after the Buu saga of DBZ. The main antagonist of the film is named Lord Beerus and he's the God of Destruction. The film is canon with the series, so you can take everything as a whole when watching the movie.

It's obvious that Mr. Toriyama wrote this film, because it surprisingly has a lot of humor in it, which I absolutely loved. While there are subtle nods to the series' history, charming humor, and overall great pacing in the film there are only a few fights, which is a good thing. The fights that are in the film are spectacular, fast paced, accompanied with great music, and last as long as you'd want them to be. Especially the finale confrontation at the end of the film. Funimation did a great job translating the original Japanese script as well as the actual dubbing. Everyone's voice is top notch and represents each character perfectly.

I'm glad to see Toriyama adding more to the Dragon Ball mythology with this film and the up in coming new Dragon Ball 2015 movie for next year. If you love Dragon Ball don't hesitate to purchase this movie. It's pure fan service to the highest degree with amazing production value. The animation is amazing, the English dub is the best Funimation has done yet, a good chunk of the soundtrack gets your blood flowing for the action, the fight scenes are some of the most developmental in the series, and it's just an overall great movie for old and new Dragon Ball fans to enjoy.",1412726400,118,2248,4.415458937198068

This story take place after the Buu Sage, but before the ending of Dragon ball Z in the original anime/Manga. All of the voice acting is great both the Japanese and English Dub give their best.
