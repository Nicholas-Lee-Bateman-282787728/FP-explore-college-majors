8311088,5,B001ILHYIQ,"Paid nothing close to this...way cheaper than the ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" DVD all by itself at one time.  Tossed ""Mystery Date"" in the trash.  ""Desperately"" is so worth your time if you've not seen it.  An exciting young cast in a rather a ""Keystone Cops"" setting.  Rosanna/always the best of the Arquette siblings.  Madonna/perfect in this i.e. pretty w/out being bony.  Aidan was still so pretty & John Turruro simply has to be in anything so NYC!  Seriously looked into having a replica made of the fabulous ""pyramid"" jacket at any price...it's beyond hard to come by.",1490227200,,575,4.865979381443299
