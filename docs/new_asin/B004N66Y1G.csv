4435557,5,B004N66Y1G,"""Farewell"" (L'affaire Farewell) is a Cold War espionage thriller inspired by the real-life case of Vladmir Vetrov, a KGB officer who, in the 1980s, gave the French domestic intelligence agency DST the names of KGB agents in the West who were involved in industrial and technological espionage. While there are obvious similarities in Vetrov's story and that of the characters in the film (e.g. Vetrov passed information through a French engineer of his acquaintance), Vetrov was a good deal more careless, and drunk, than his likeness in the film, which was a fatal flaw. Director Christian Carion adapted the screenplay from Serguei Kostine's nonfiction book ""Bonjour Farewell: La verit de la taupe franaise du KGB.""

In 1981, a French engineer working in Moscow, Pierre Froment (Guillaume Canet), gets deeper into the espionage business than he intended when a favor for the French security agency DST puts him in contact with a high-ranking KGB officer who wants to pass secrets. Col. Sergei Grigoriev (Emir Kusturica) thinks the Soviet Union needs a new revolution and that it will only have one if the supply of pilfered technology from the West is cut off. He intends to expose the network of Soviet spies called Line X. Pierre is uneasy in his role but can't bring himself to quit. French President Mitterand (Phillipe Magnan) receives regular reports on the project, as does US President Ronald Reagan (Fred Ward), who is surprised to learn that the US space and air defense programs were an open book.

Most of ""Farewell"" takes place in Moscow in the early to mid-1980s. The period detail is interesting in itself. It's a character drama with tension but without suspense until the final act. Pierre Froment is an anxious man, Grigoriev a disillusioned dreamer. ""I can change the world,"" he says. Maybe he could. Vladamir Vetrov cut off the Soviet Union's supply of new technologies just as the empire was buckling under financial pressures, hastening the USSR's demise. But ""Farewell"" is mostly quiet, carried by the performances of Kusturica and Canet. Pierre is an everyman, while Grigoriev is a sympathetic, if flawed, hero. There is a lot to like in this trip back to the Cold War. In French and Russian with English subtitles that cannot be turned off. The DVD (Neoclassics Films 2011) includes a US theatrical trailer (2 min) and a Photo Gallery of behind-the-scenes and production stills.",1306454400,22,2405,5.025062656641604
4435558,5,B004N66Y1G,"This powerful, troubled and disturbing historical period mirrors with accurate vision, the unavoidable fall of this opressive regime in which Grigoriev was totally convinced. Note how he employs the poem ""The death of wolf"" as a foreseeing metaphor (we are in 1981, i.e. eight years before the final curtain). He decides to accelerate the dramatic fall working as spy with a French contact.

The decadent atmosphere you breath all the way through, the technological advances at the front of the hackeneyed formulas of opression of the Soviets, who were uncapable to anticipate this regime was walking toward a deep end.

Emir Kusturica really chews the stage as the Soviet spy who bets all his cards. But the film revelas these behind camera positions of Reagan and his visible discrepancies with Mitterand around this torny issue.

Wilhelm Dafoe as C.I.A.'s chief commander is towering too. Christian Carion surprised the entire world with his bold, couaregous and brave adaptation of one of the most transcendental events into the convulted decade of the eighties, the crucial decade that began to show the first signs of breakthough of the abominable soviet regime.

Memorable and formidable film that must be watched without concesions.

Go for it!!!",1304640000,4,1254,5.218905472636816
4435559,4,B004N66Y1G,"A good if a bit talky spy thriller from France that fictionalizes the real case of Vladimir Vetrov, a high ranking spy from the KGB who in the early 1980s and under the code name Farewell gave to the DST, the French internal security service, a massive dossier of files that showed how the Soviets were stealing massively Western technology. The French decided to pass the files to the United States, a convenient thing to do since the Reagan Administration was very suspicious of president Franois Mitterrand having several communist ministers in his cabinet (Fred Ward has a funny cameo in the movie as Ronald Reagan; Willem Dafoe appears as the CIA director).

In the movie Vetrov is called Grigoriev and is played by the famous Serbian director Emir Kusturica. For dramatic reasons, the importance of these files is exaggerated in the movie; they are said to include all sort of things, even diplomatic codes which they did not and the dossier is somehow connected with the decision to announce the Star Wars weapons program. In the film, and since embassy personnel was under surveillance from the KGB, the DST decides to use as a contact with Grigoriev a French engineer working in Moscow for the Thomson firm (who is played by Guillaume Canet as a nervous Woody Allen type guy; Alexandra Maria Lara plays his wife who is obviously shocked when she learns her nerdy husband moonlights as a spy).

Directed by Christian Carion, who made the very good World War I drama Joyeux Noel the film is especially fine in the reconstruction of the early 1980s and especially the Soviet Union at the time (Moscow is shown here as surprisingly sunny; if a movie based on this case have been made during the Cold War, Moscow would have looked surely much more gloomy and sinister). A good effort.",1304035200,2,1788,4.764516129032258
4435560,5,B004N66Y1G,"Serguei Kostine's book 'Bonjour Farewell' serves as the source of the historical moments of one of the most important fractures in the Cold War in 1981 - the act of valor of Sergei Gregoriev - and the script for this very important and controversial film was written by Eric Reynaud and Christian Carion who also directed this stunning film (he is best remembered for his brilliant 'Joyeux Nol' which incidentally starred many of the actors in this film).  It is a disturbing movie to watch, a film that was condemned by the Russian government, disallowing filming in Moscow - except for some undercover camera work for an apparent Coca-Cola commercial, and refusing to allow Russian actors to take part in the project.  It reveals the brutality of the Communist regime of the time, a period Russia would prefer to remain occult

The story is somewhat convoluted, a fact that makes it even more revealing of the nature of espionage work at the time.  Sergei Gregoriev (Emir Kusturica) passes secret documents to French spy Pierre Froment (Guillaume Canet) living in Moscow with his wife (Alexandra Maria Lara), documents so important that Froment must take extraordinary risks to pass them to the US Government.  In the US President Reagan (Fred Ward) must balance the importance of these documents with the balance of relationships with the French government under Franois Mitterrand (Philippe Magnan)  it is a tense struggle for power and at the crux of it is Froment and the ultimately captured Gregoriev who is tortured to reveal his French espionage contact.  The rush to finish at the end of the film is breathtaking and heartbreaking. There is a conversation between Froment and the US Feeney (Willem Dafoe) that places the soul of the Cold War years in perspective.

Every aspect of this film is involving - the acting is first rate from everyone involved, the pacing is in the fashion edge of the seat direction, and the sharing of the innermost secrets of espionage is information we all should study.  A reenactment of the Reagan/Gorbachev era as well defined as any film has dared to show us.  Not only is this excellent filmmaking, but it is also information about a man's (Sergei Gregoriev) sacrifice that deserve honor.  Grady Harp, April 11",1303257600,11,2256,4.926121372031663

Tension builds as the authorities close in.  Will the Frenchman and his family make it out of Russia in time?

I am an avid film goer and my background is political science, with a Ph. D. in sociology. I want you to know that this is one of the best movies about the cold war period that I have seen. Based on a true story, this brilliant French movie gives voices (with unforgettable images and consequent sentiments)to the epionage events of the 80's SOVIET/CIA spy networks. It is easy to understand why people who liked the 2009 Oscar winner for best Foreign Film- ""El Secreto de tus Ojos-"" liked Farewell.

4435563,5,B004N66Y1G,"Farewell is a very empowering, true-story about one man, Sergei Gregoriev, who probably did more to bring down the Communist government in Russia - and end the cold war - than any other person who ever lived! This man should be honored by a postage stamp in every Western country in the world and in every high school history textbook! What an incredibly brave human being!

I gained a lot of insights from watching this amazing film. The Russians lost an estimated 26 million people during World War 2. That's 1 in 3 people that died in all of World War 2 did so within the borders of the Soviet Union! I can only imagine the trauma and paranoia that was inflicted on the survivors who later then came to power. It didn't help either that a monster was at the head of government (Stalin) from 1924 to 1953. And, you wonder why the Soviets had a such a mind-boggling intelligence apparatus established throughout the United States? Once this network of spies was dismantled, the Soviet leadership was blind! Out of fear they bankrupted themselves on military spending because they could no longer accurately assess what actual threats the United States posed to them!

Sergei Gregoriev knew how his government would react to such a threat and he sacrificed everything to make it happen. I don't think he would be happy with the gangster capitalism that took Communism's place. But at least there are no more brutal wars fought in desperately poor countries - which have cost millions of lives - because of the Cold War! Future generations will thank you for your sacrifice, Sergei Gregoriev!",1296518400,,1591,4.760869565217392

4435567,4,B004N66Y1G,"Farwell is a great spy film. It packs in some drama, some thrills, and is mostly entertaining. It's not an action film so don't go into this expecting a James Bond flick, you may be disappointed. Instead of over-the-top action, Farwell uses immersive dialogue to create suspense and thrills and it works very well. The acting was great, it build a tense atmosphere, and has some decent storytelling. I REALLY enjoyed the music. I felt it was a bit underwhelming overall though and it can get confusing if you drift away.

Overall, I highly recommend Farwell, and you must check out the music! If you're interested, Farwell is available on Netflix Streaming as of 7/4/12.

4435568,4,B004N66Y1G,"I was recently browsing at the foreign movie section of my local library, and fell upon this. Took a look at the jacket, and not knowing much more about the movie, I picked it up. Boy, am I glad I did!

""Farewell"" (2009 movie from France; original title ""L'affaire Farewell""; 118 min.) starts off with telling us that this will bring us the roots off the fall of the Soviet Union, and my initial reaction was ""sure..."" but not ready to believe it. Then I watched the movie. The basic premise is that a Soviet guy in the know, Grigoriev (nicknamed ""Farewell"" by the French intelligence agency), leaks significant state secrets to a young French engineer who is totally off the radar screen of the Soviets. Many nail-biting scenes ensue, and I don't want to give much more away of the plot, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

This is an outstanding spy thriller. It reminded me again how good this genre can be, or how bad when not done well (last year's disastrous remake of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" immediately comes to mind). The movie is just done right, period. Props to director Christian Carion for pulling it all together. William Defoe is billed prominently for this US release, but truth be told, he has a minor role, 5 min. max, towards the end of the movie. But it doesn't matter. This is a terrific movie, and HIGHLY RECOMMENED for any fan of the spy thriller genre.",1335657600,,1405,4.52755905511811
4435569,5,B004N66Y1G,Sorry but got to this review late....about a year or so. Any how this was a good book and worth getting.,1328227200,,104,4.0
4435570,4,B004N66Y1G,"Although real-life players are either fictionalized or combined for dramatic effect, ""Farewell"" still paints an emotionally honest picture of Cold War intrigue and the cost of idealism, and treason.  First and foremost this is story well told, and not a documentary-like recounting of historical events.  The performances from leads Canet and Kusterica are particularly moving.  Where the film falters is in tone.  Opportunities for suspense (no spoilers -- but a subway station sequence is an example) are handled in a rather on-the-nose fashion.  And as this is a French production I suppose the temptation to portray all Frenchmen as noble, sophisticated, and wise was too irresistible.  But the portrayal of some of the American players really breaks the verisimilitude -- Reagan's White House becomes something out of ""Dr. Strangelove.""  Granted the whole idea of mutually destroyed destruction is absurd, but Reagan actually understood the moral vulgarity of the constant threat of nuclear annihilation.  See the Pulitzer Prize-winning book ""The Dead Hand"" for a recounting of Reagan's visceral reaction to the TV movie ""The Day After,"" for example.)

Had ""Farewell"" treated all its characters with the same attention to the complexities of human motivation, the film would have made its point in a much more credible way.  Yes, Reagan was forgetful, and yes, he liked cowboy movies, but the history I've read suggests there was actually a lot more nuance in the White House's world view than this film allows.  Kudos for the clever use of clips from ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" however.

And it was the Americans, not the French, who best exploited the Farewell Dossier by planting defective high-tech gear in the Soviet's stolen technology pipeline (including, literally, into a pipeline that ended up exploding in Siberia).

Nevertheless, I highly recommend ""Farewell"" to fans of spy movies and students of Cold War espionage.  It's a good conversation starter -- and anyone who wants to check out the real story will find even more shades of gray, more darkness in the heart of double agent Vetrov (Gregoriev in the movie), and more tragedy in the Tolkachev character.  For a more accurate portrayal of KGB tradecraft, and a more suspenseful piece of cinema, see Frankenheimer's ""The Falcon and the Snowman."")",1318291200,,2327,5.234501347708895
4435571,5,B004N66Y1G,"As in his Oscar-nominated war drama ""Joyeux Noel"" (2006), French director Christian Carion has made a film inspired by intriguing, but little-known real-life events. Set in 1981, ""Farewell"" (original title ""L'affaire Farewell"") follows the fascinating story of Sergei Grigoriev (Emir Kusturica), a disillusioned Soviet high-rank officer, who passed on the nation's top secrets to a French businessman Pierre Froment (Guillaume Canet).

Pierre, a family man living in Moscow with his wife and son, doesn't want to be involved with the espionage stuff, especially when there might be someone spying on them even in his home. But French Secret Service (DST) would not let go of this opportunity, and somehow Pierre is attracted to the KGB lieutenant colonel, who demands no money in return, but a few bottles of liquor and a cassette tape of rock band Queen.

The spy thriller works most effectively when suggesting the presence of the ""system"" looming over the daily life of ordinary people. It is a highly complicated network run by the Soviet regime, which even extends outside the country. Just like people living in the West, Grigoriev and other Soviet citizens are good and decent people, but they are crushed by the ever-present system, the system that is about to collapse.

The political thriller is based on Serguei Kostine's book ""Bonjour, Farewell."" I haven't read the book, but it seems characters' names have been changed from those of the real-life counterparts, and I suspect the KGB officer's motive for passing on the information is not exactly what is suggested here. But we should know Christian Carion is not making a documentary. What he wants is a political thriller with believable characters (including Ronald Reagan played by Fred Ward and Franois Mitterrand by Philippe Magnan) against the background of Cold War international relations.

And it is a success, though not completely free from spy movie clich. ""Farewell"" is a gripping spy thriller with some very chilling moments, enough convincing to bring back the memories of the Cold War era.

Alex Ferns, Benno Frmann, Diane Kruger, Gary Lewis and Thomas Schmauser from Carion's ""Joyeux Noel"" briefly appear in the film.",1317945600,2,2198,5.19774011299435
4435572,5,B004N66Y1G,"I always hesitate to give a film 5 stars because I might get wrapped up in to a point I don't see it's faults, but I can't see that as being the case here. This is not the kind of movie to wow you and slap you around or bludgeon your senses. This is a very well written, acted and directed spy flick without all the histrionics usually associated with the genre.

This owes a lot more to ""The Spy Who Came in From the"" Cold"" than it does to James Bond or even Jason Bourne (as much as I do enjoy those films). It involves a Russian agent (Grigori) who feels the Soviet Union has lost its way and has not lived up to the promises it's made to its people. He passes sensitive information to a French go-between living in Russia, who in turn, funnels it to those who can get them into CIA hands. Things get shaky but they pull it off and the Soviet Union falls.

If you're looking for action, things that blow up real good and high tension, give this a pass. This is, as they say, a thinking person's spy film. Those involved are human with all the inherent frailties. And one gets to see how American culture is slipping under the Soviet foundation and begins to erode things. The Soviet infrastructure is beginning to fail and our spy hero is hammering in the final nails just by getting the right info to the right people. There are some tense moments but they're genuine, not trumped up. And you like these people. Grigori looks like a tired dog. As a Soviet spy, he's been at it too long and grown tired of it all. He is actually selfless in that he knows he probably won't make it through all this but it's still worth it all.

There is nothing here I didn't like. I liked they use American actors to play the American parts. It's just all around a great effort and well worth the time for anyone predisposed to this sort of film.",1313107200,,1833,4.216524216524217
4435573,5,B004N66Y1G,"Farewell

Movies about the fall of Communism are quickly becoming their own genre.  In this sense, Farewell is linked to the hip with The Lives Of Others, which depicted human rights abuse and state surveilance of individuals by the East German secret police known as the Stazi.  Despite its fascinating plot, its real and harrowing exploration of family ties, a supurb cast and great acting, the film is likely to join The Lives Of Others in another category: polite applause and prompt oblivion.  An article in Esquire magazine voiced the belief it was too embarassing to the political left to have films like this around.

The film chronicles real life events centering on the end of the Cold War as a top level Soviet technocrat decides to pass state secrets to someone he thinks is a French commercial attach, but is really an agent for French intelligence.  The French agent thinks he's getting garbage input from a rank amateur until his superiors tell him he's been handed Level 1 information that includes the names of Soviet spies within the American intelligence community.

It gets worse.  The French operative is also handed protocols for U.S.air defenses, including ""all radar positions installed on your territory since 1976...  I also have the digicode numbers to get into the White House, the schedules of companies that deliver your laundry and food supplies.  And the codes American embassies have used to communicate with each other around the world.""  Your basic Soviet style stakeout.

Actor Fred Ward bears a striking physical resemblance to Ronald Reagan and delivers an  appropriately curt response: ""I see."" he says.  American intelligence takes steps to plug the leaks although its plans don't include saving the main Soviet turncoat, Sergei Grigoriev, played brilliantly by film director Emir Kusturica.  Another film director, Guillaume Canet, plays Grigoriev's French connection, Pierre Froment.

The film is gripping in its exploration of the family ties that bind as individuals get caught up in state level issues. At first glance, Grigoriev seems to have a recalcitrant punk style son, Igor, (Evgenie Kharlanov) who lambastes Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev in public, then retreats to his school homework and the tirades of Queen in his room. He is pointedly appalled by his father's extra marital affair, but after his father's arrest and a prison room visit, it takes 6 bulldog policemen to pull father and son apart.

Even if they do explore interpersonal relationships fully, many films of this ilk then skimp at the head of state level, showing behind the head shots of leaders in tall upholstered chairs, for example.  All head of state actors in this picture appear in robust form and all have suitable dialog to round out their characters.  This film's musical score is so taut and the plot so tightly wound, you'll be forgiven the impression you should have a security clearance to watch it.",1310342400,3,2934,5.075

Also, all Russian actors declined to play the protagonist since Vetrov is viewed as a traitor in Russia, so Vetrov is played by a Serbian actor, Emir Kusturica whose speaks Russian with a heavy accent.

It has received excellent reviews, featuring Guillaume Canet (playing Patrick Ferrant, as ""Pierre Fremont"") and Emir Kusturica (playing Vladimir Vetrov, as ""Gregoriev"").

The disintegration of the USSR is inextricably entwined with the life of the courageous Russian who is the subject of this film -- a man with tenacious clarity of purpose and the steely determination to carry on through and accomplish his goal at any price. We are speaking of KGB officer and Russian patriot, Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Ippolitovich Vetrov (1932-1985; code name Farewell).

Vetrov crossed over to the West as a defector-in-place and spied against the KGB and his former Soviet comrades. Why? Because he was sickened by the nepotism of the apparatchiks, the abuses, corruption, and injustice plaguing the KGB specifically, and the lack of individual freedom, hypocrisy of the nomenklatura, inequalities and abuses sustained by the citizens in the entire Soviet system where family connections were more important than merit and hard work. What was his goal? To break the machinery of repression of the corrupt KGB and bring down the Soviet system, even if this task would ultimately lead to his personal destruction and death.

During his active espionage career that lasted less than a year (from March 1981 to January 1982) but was longer than that of most agents operating in a communist police state, Vladimir (Volodia) Vetrov identified and neutralized 422 KGB officers and 54 Western agents (Soviet moles) working for the KGB and the USSR bloc.

Volodia had been placed at a key nexus point of scientific and technological information collation of the KGB, an excellent place for a French spy. And so when he decided to spy for the West and became agent Farewell, Vetrov was privy to the family jewels and needs of the Soviet state as to technologic, electronic, and scientific secrets stolen or needed from the West, including the U.S. and France. He also exposed the vast network of Soviet and Eastern Bloc organizations, which with innocuous names were front organizations also involved in pilfering science and technology from the West for the VPK.

The film also avoids making a psychological profile of the hero or interjecting itself in Gregoriev's mental state and speculating ulterior motives. Gregoriev, correctly, is simply an educated Russian patriot, who fears for the growing might of the Soviet state, feels he has the means to contribute to its destruction, and as a devoted father wants a better future of freedom for his son. The movie recounts the story with dramatic flare and novelistic license, omitting some other details in the interest of time and simplicity, but it nevertheless encapsulates the story well -- that is, until the final denouement, where is flaps badly.

In the film Vetrov (Gregoriev) and his son are not close. In reality they were very closed. His son Igor, whose real name is Vladik, was privy to Vetrov's espionage and aware of Gregoriev's affair with his mistress. Likewise for the sake of family conflict, in the film, Pierre and his wife argue a lot; in fact they collaborated in the espionage for the sake of France, although Pierre's wife was indeed fearful of getting caught spying in the crutches of a police state like the USSR. Most inexplicably, the film omits the poignant story of how Gregoriev was really caught in the end by the KGB and how his espionage career ended; as I wrote in a previous review of the book:

""By January 1982, Vetrov (photo, right) was psychologically exhausted by the risk he was taking and his double existence, his personal life in shambles. On the night of February 22, 1982, Volodia and his mistress, Ludmilla Ochikina, were parked off a major Moscow highway in his Lada drinking champagne. He had been estranged from his mistress, a KGB translator, with whom he worked at Yasenevo. Apparently by a slip of his tongue due to the champagne, Volodia must have revealed he was a double agent spying for the West. He panicked, lost control, and furiously stabbed his mistress. An off-duty policeman came to the window of his Lada, and Volodia got out of his car and stabbed him too, killing the man. Vetrov was arrested for killing the policeman and attempting to kill his mistress. He was sent to the gulag, but it was a matter of time, as the KGB was suspicious of the strange circumstances of the crime and continued to investigate. The KGB's suspicion grew as stool pigeons in the prison and gulag system reported on Vetrov's unguarded political remarks.""

So the producers sadly chose to use the final moments of the film as left-wing propaganda, a club to beat the United States, suppressing the truth and omitting the most dramatic episode of the Vetrov saga.

The film was well done, and for the most part it encapsulates the substance of the Farewell Dossier, that is, until truth and content were subordinated to bashing the United States; for toward the end, the film the producers mar the film with a totally fabricated ending, in which the CIA (represented in a rare appearance by Willem Dafoe playing the CIA Director), the U.S., and the American President (Fred Ward playing President Reagan) are slandered and smeared by betraying Farewell!  This is a very mendacious ending of U.S. betrayal (with no basis at all in fact) for an otherwise very good film.
