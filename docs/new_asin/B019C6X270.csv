7569799,3,B019C6X270,"A.R.C.H.I.E is the second robodog movie I've seen that was released on DVD in 2016.  This one has Michael J Fox as the voice of the robotic canine which is nice to hear as you watch the film as he does it in the fun cheeky style of Alex Keaton and Marty McFly.  So it does give you that pleasant nostalgic vibe as your watching it, which distracts from the fact it's a pretty average movie.  The movie is a pretty basic and simple script, low budget one.  Fox is likely the only actor you'll have heard of in this one.  It's not that the actors in this one do a bad job, it's more the script they are performing from doesn't give their characters much depth or substance to work with.  Basically most characters as is the case in a lot of kids movies, aren't the brightest people in the world, so it will be up to a new teen girl in town and the local boy who is being nice to her, to save the day with the assistance of the robot dog type of plot.  With this sort of movie you are never in any doubt how it will turn out for the characters (both good and bad ones) and aren't at any time concerned for the welfare of any of them either.

So basically A.R.C.H.I.E (or Artificial Robotic Canine Hyper- Intelligence Unit) was stolen from the lab by a janitor who was supposed to sell it to its inventor who didn't want it used for military purposes.  Instead he decides to go on a cross country crime trip, but A.R.C.H.I.E falls out the back of his van near a small town.  In that small town a teen girl after the death of her parents has just been sent to live with her uncle who is the town mayor and town's only takeaway shop owner.  A franchise chain rep who the mayor refused to take to the prom back in his high school days is determined to make him sell his takeaway shop to the franchise.  She has a plan of running for mayor and using the town's two superficial mean girl types as minions who of course hate the new girl at first sight because the boy who they like talks to her.

Some spoilers follow  - For me the plans of the villains and the hero teens which includes A.R.C.H.I.E are pretty lame and lack much substance.  I mean you've got a robotic dog with superpowers like X-Ray vision yet you don't use those powers, but do something you could have done with a hidden phone or Gopro camera or something. Likewise the vengeance on the teen mean girls was pretty lame. The janitor who is prepared to see teens perhaps die locked away (although granted one kick would probably have knocked a wall let alone the door down), but on an isolated road with no one around just gives back the dog to a small woman in her 20's because she has a USB stick?  He's got a van, you were waiting for him to at least overpower her and tie her up and A.R.C.H.I.E to save the day before he murders her, but no he just pouts at the loss of his millions and drives off.  It also made no sense that the town would just turn on the bad fringe haircut woman after such a lame busting her video.  Nor why a franchise would bother buying a pretty empty customer wise business rather than just building a new store.  If there was some reason like a secret recipe was buried under the building before it was constructed or something might have made some sense.

Why didn't A.R.C.H.I.E just run away from the janitor during his initial crime spree since he has super speed?  Why would you make a robot that needed to eat?  Why have X-ray vision and not use it in your plans?

If you like kid aimed dog movies, this is as watchable as any of them.  Although the plot lacks substance you will enjoy hearing a full of life Michael J Fox again.  Refreshingly the teen characters are played by actors who, well I don't know if they are still or not but they look like teens and not actors in their mid twenties.  It's a film that is enjoyable enough but just could have been so much better!",1466380800,2,3870,4.195945945945946

7569801,2,B019C6X270,"Stilted and boring. Filled with fart jokes not even my 6 year old found funny. My children love dog movies but this was one of the worst they have seen. They barely sat for the whole movie. A movie that insults the intelligence of a 6 and 8 year old is not worth watching. The behavior of the adult characters in the movie were stereo typical and mean, diminishing people to caricatures of bad behavior that even my pre teen daughters know is wrong.  Skip this one.",1462320000,,465,4.344827586206897
7569802,5,B019C6X270,"Great family fun movie. We really enjoyed it, yes even us adults! Was very surprised to hear Michael J Fox as a talking dog but it worked really well. It's not going to win any Oscars but was a lot of fun and is well made and acted. If you have kids up to 12 or so it is worth watching.",1462233600,2,286,3.7049180327868854
7569803,5,B019C6X270,"It didn't take us long into the terrific film to realize that Michael J. Fox lends the perfect voice and character to the cybernetic dog known as A.R.C.H.I.E. Our entire family enjoyed this and a few members have watched it several times! (O.K., O.K, they should have left out the ""farting"" scene, as it was a little low-brow for an otherwise great film, but I'm willing to overlook that small faux pas.)

Never a dull moment in this film, recommended for everyone!",1462147200,2,465,4.670731707317073

Here's his picture for proof!  [...]
You could tell I thought it was weird when I saw the title alone, but when it's an identical twin- voiced by Michael J. Fox- that I knew something was up. Who knows, maybe it's just someone who knows about my dog who thought it would make a good premise for a movie. You never know.",1461628800,2,413,4.434210526315789
