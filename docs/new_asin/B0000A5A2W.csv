7996451,4,B0000A5A2W,"There are 5 stories on this Scholastic Video (listed below).  Each is well narrated and illustrated in the style of the original books.

Click Clack Moo

The Day Jimmy's Boa Ate the Wash

The Pig's Wedding

The Cow Who Fell into the Canal

Charlie Needs a Cloak

Click Clack Moo tells the story of how the sudden ability to communicate can make for contention.  As soon as Farmer Brown's cows discovered a typewriter, and subsequently that cows can type, they begin to leave notes demanding blankets to keep them warm.  And when Farmer Brown refuses to give in, they go on strike.

The Day Jimmy's Boa Ate the Wash is about a school trip that turns into a riotous day at the farm.  It is particularly funny because it parodies the conversations that we parents sometimes have with our children where they slowly unfold the story of what is going on in their lives.  In this case, the story unfolds backwards when a mom asks her daughter how the field trip to a farm went and she answers `okay, I guess'"" when in fact it was total chaos.

The Pig's Wedding was originally printed in German, but its silliness could not be contained within one country's boundaries.  In the translated story, Porker and Curlytail decide to wed and come to some very unusual solutions to making their special day complete.

The Cow Who Fell into the Canal is about the adventures of a bovine with wanderlust.

And finally, Charlie Needs a Cloak, by Tomie DePoala, tells the story, from start to finish, of how Charlie goes about making a red cloak.  From shearing the sheep to finding chokeberries to make the dye, this interesting story shows children that clothes don't just magically appear on store shelves.

 This is definitely a keeper, four stars, though perhaps not our favorite of the Scholastic's.",1118016000,6,1787,4.688102893890675

7996455,1,B0000A5A2W,"This is a very cute book, but the video is not worth the money.  It's very short and there's really not much too it.  The second cartoon on the tape isn't very good either.  Save the cash and just stick with the book.  Or if you really want it, let me know.  I'll sell mine cheap.  :)",1073347200,13,284,3.8947368421052633
