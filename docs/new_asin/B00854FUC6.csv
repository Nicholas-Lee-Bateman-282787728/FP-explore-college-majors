5132074,5,B00854FUC6,"Love this movie not so much for the story, it's alright, but the photography of the area is fantastic and I gave it 5 stars for that reason. I do live here and have hiked on the trail shown in the movie, and been to a lot of the other places in it. You don't really run into the people shown in the movie but understand they had to add some character to them to make the story more entertaining. I bought a Blue Ray copy and plan on showing it to family and friends visiting us in the future.",1345680000,,492,3.93
5132075,5,B00854FUC6,"I live here, and I get tired of people calling this the woo-woo capital of the world.  There is more woo-woo going on in California than this little slice of heaven.  People who actually live here have an afinity for the gorgeous red mountains, Oak Creek Canyon, zillions of stars at night,the lack of walled-in housing tracks and malls, the wildlife, the plethora of art, and the sound of wind in the trees at night along the canyon.  We do have folks from the New Age community who try to explain all this beauty with the latest mumbo-jumbo du jour, but just watch the opening scenes from Sedona The Movie, and it will take your breath away. It does that every day when you live here.  The movie was charming at first viewing, but much deeper and satisfying when you watch it again.  My office is the building that was used as the salon where Frances has her Spiritual Pedicure, and I was expecting the movie to dissolve into Heebee JeeBee hijinks and farce after that, but it takes a turn into real human angst: how to balance the realities of life with the deeper yearnings of the soul.  Of course a story like that had to be in Sedona.  The beauty that surrounds us up here refuses to be ignored, and it turns the staunchist skeptic into considering something beyond our daily grind.  This movie does that brilliantly, and uses an amazing cast and a handful of locals to get that message across without being preachy or woo-woo.  Hollywood take note: we're sick of your formula films.",1345593600,29,1489,4.526119402985074
5132076,5,B00854FUC6,"I saw 'Sedona The Motion Picture' a when it first opened, and being a huge film buff and movie fan, I thought (before seeing it) that it would be cute, possibly quirky and probably have some kind of slant on spirituality (being set in Sedona). Well, I laughed in unexpected places--Beth Grant is a natural. I cried-Lin Shaye is amazing! I felt transported by the film score. Wow! I was so taken with the little boy in the movie (what a natural someone get this kid another movie role!) and the rental car guy was hysterical! (I also saw him in some commercials and on a soap), as was Barry Corbin (whom I used to adore in 'Northern Exposure').

I was equally grateful that nothing 'blew up' or exploded in the film (so tired of action without purpose in films), yet there were exciting 'mini action' scenes.

Watching very talented actors bring a very refreshing perspective to spirituality--and how it's grounded in who we are and the choices we make...(and how it can all unravel when we least expect it) I applaud this new director/writer for telling a story that speaks to the human heart on so many levels.

Sedona-The Motion Picture, although most likely viewed as an 'indie' or a small film, is actually epic in how it unfolds and the magic that happens in day-to-day ways...(without the typical 'psychic-other worldly' attachments you might expect in a movie set in a spiritual town like Sedona--where I live and practice as an intuitive channel!).

Speaking of Northern Exposure, Sedona the motion picture would make a GREAT tv series or episodic with so many unique characters! I'll be looking for that! Well done Tommy Stovall!",1344211200,5,1638,4.757042253521127
5132077,5,B00854FUC6,"Charming independent film by Tommy Stovall, a talented writer and director who lives in Sedona and has artfully expressed the quirky yet mystical qualities of this incomparable place on earth. Excellent acting, scenery, music. A feel good story that you will enjoy and that will make you want to visit Sedona, if you have not already done so!",1343692800,3,342,4.913793103448276
5132078,5,B00854FUC6,"Saw the Sedona movie on opening night in Sedona and loved it. The story was fun, had elements of drama, comedy, and a bit of mystery. Acting was excellent, music was terrific (done by local artists), and the filming of the scenery will take your breath away. I understand that the characters were based on real people who live and work in Sedona, and in some cases, the actual residents were the actors.
The movie portrays some un-grounded, lovable, happy folks in an affectionate way, which will make you smile and chuckle, and the fun part is, many folks in Sedona are that way! And it has a unique ending. You will watch this feel-good movie over and over and never tire of it.",1340323200,5,680,4.491935483870968
5132079,5,B00854FUC6,"Sedona was a wonderful movie to watch. It's a great feel-good movie. Rightly so, they acknowledge the gay community by placing it in the main plot. Frances was wonderful to watch on-screen. It is a shame she has not been recognized at awards ceremonies. Beth is fun to watch. She's light hearted, quirky and care-free. Seth had a demanding presence when he was in a scene. He is truly a great actor. Trevor was simply awesome. He's very good for being so young! This movie leaves you feeling good when it ends. Even if you ONLY love the breathtaking, panoramic vistas of Sedona, you owe it to yourself to get this movie...on Blu-Ray! They've done a great job on this movie, especially for a low-budget indie film! Enjoy it! I know I did.",1339718400,3,737,4.548872180451128
5132080,5,B00854FUC6,Viewed this movie with friends We're all very impressed with the quility of this film.  I especially liked the young boy in the film.  I think he is a up and coming star..(Trevor) very talented. Like all of the actors and the story line. Very simple but really deep when you think it through. Very thought provoking well after the movie is over.  The views of Sedona we're worth the DVD all by itself.  I think from what I've heard of Sedona it captured it perfectly.  I look forwad to seeing more from these movie makers.,1339632000,,522,4.395833333333333
5132081,5,B00854FUC6,"If you are looking for a film for pure entertainment, this film won't fulfill that completely because it is filled with so many other ways of watching a film.  It is a film for those who are needing to be healed from wounds that have gone deep in us and have left one scarred for life.  One also must watch this with an open mind and get over any of the notions that Sedona is a place of woo-woo vortex science or prejudice towards any person no matter what their behavior may seem to be, publicly.  The producers and director of this film have done a beautiful job in reflecting such sensitive issues in our present day society throughout the film with great sublety, humor and playfulness.  There are several wonderful actors and actresses playing a splendid role, one of which is my favorite, Claire De Lune, in a heartfelt scene dancing in a pond.  Frances Fisher plays her part so fabulously expressing so much anger, resentment, and blaming everything and everyone that showed so well the absurdity of it all in a way that becomes a healing moment for viewers showing us how to just laugh at ourselves.  Then when Christopher Atkins comes on the scene whom I have come to know through many friends who call him the heart-throb of earlier times in films such as Blue Lagoon, I can see how one can't help loving him irresistibly.
Therefore, this film as I have tried to describe here is not just a film to watch for pure entertainment although it has that element because of how it is filled with as many different ways one can find something meaningful for each individual person. I have watched this twice now since I purchased it and both times, I discovered something to take away with me to help make my life just a little better. What seems to be the most outstanding for me is not to judge another person's behavior whether they seem to be gay, lesbian, pregnant and unwed, religious or not religious, black or white, etc. etc.  I love the way the director and producer handled all of these things in the film.",1339632000,2,2021,4.505464480874317
5132082,5,B00854FUC6,"SEDONA IS A MOVIE STAR IN 2012.  2012 is the year Sedona The Movie is being distributed.  I first thrilled to the film at the Sedona International Film Festival last year.  After more editing and showings at other film festivals, I saw the final cut when it hit the theatres in March. Oh, my, God!  I can't imagine a person not thoroughly taken for one of the best rides through a movie.  Laughing, awed constantly, moved emotionally, even skeptics embracing life's mysteries of the esoteric as well as natural synchronicities.  The scenic views of Sedona's world-famous red rocks laced throughout, is like your favorite music playing under a fantastic story being seductively revealed. I wanted to stay in the movie, be with it beyond the thought-provoking ending, and hope there will be more coming in the future.  I've spoken to residents and visitors who have traveled the world, seen the most popular lands of beauty and magic, and say colorful Sedona tops them, including our state's Grand Canyon just a couple of hours from here.  I call Sedona a most near-perfect place on earth and I'm not alone. Beauty-wise the media have even referred to Sedona as having the most scenic drive in our country.  I feel that Sedona is my Shangri-La from the movie Lost Horizon, for those of you who remember that movie, also set in the mountains, considered a paradise with magical properties known for healing lives.  Is it really only the famous vortexes why Sedona could be an unmatched therapeutic current evoking empowering modifications personally and in the world?  Is it synchronicity that Sedona the Movie is released in 2012?  Many people globally, of course, know about Sedona, yet I love knowing that when Sedona The Movie gets distributed further, so many more will feel the reality of its soothing and powerfully enchanting magnetism that stirs their soul.  As an intuitive Reader with countless clients passing through my office in Sedona, they describe feeling positively altered by being here.  Often it takes getting away from the usual grind, rat race, or daily habits to become inspired to higher choices, lifestyle, values and standards to put in place back at home.  Each one of us on this planet are a necessary piece of the puzzle, connected to and influencing others.  Sedona The Movie is a thrilling vacation that you will probably take again and again, ultimately taking everyone you know with you!  And footing the bill one time only for the price of a DVD!  Many here do make a living with gifts of emotional, spiritual and physical healing, some are artistans, guides of the land, or serving sweetly to us all, providing crucial services that make community.  The film captivates the charm and fascination while grounding it in beautiful reality, opening and fulfilling hearts.  Sedona The Movie is a Shining Star which can envelop the world in its en'light'enment.  Love from Rachel Star of Sedona",1339545600,,2921,4.932515337423313
5132083,5,B00854FUC6,"Being one of those killjoy skeptics, I mostly went to snicker -- I mean, this is SEDONA, Arizona, woo-woo capital of the known universe and parts beyond. C'mon now!

I am so very glad I did.

Was there woo-wooery?  Some, and mostly played for fun, as our harried, no-nonsense heroine is confronted by one .... um,  ""colorful"" character after another.  And of course there are there-is-no-such-thing-as-coincidence coincidences, but without those, would there be any movies at all?

The script was fun, the direction spot-on, the actors well-cast and charming, and the cinematography...well, this is SEDONA Arizona after all.  The visuals are just stunning.

5132085,5,B00854FUC6,"Ok, I'll admit right up front that I actually worked on this film (I think I'm listed as assistant still photographer). Used to live in Sedona but have since moved to Maui.

The movie isn't a blockbuster, but overall well written in my opinion. Cinematography is really nice, and editing is nicely done. I think the acting is very good, even if a few characters are a bit over the top, even for Sedona.

I made several great friends during filming, and watching the movie again brings back fond memories. So, while biased, I still think it's a fun film. Enjoy!",1500422400,2,560,4.534653465346534

What on earth does anyone think this conveys about a place or any meaningful self discovery?  I'll grant that the gay couple's  experience was the type of event that would provide new perspective, but this film was otherwise insipid.  The  couple  seemed about as involved with each other as college roommates. And the whole mystical vortex thing is just stupid.

It was very cool to see the cast act in the very spot I have been before, in a diner, on a balcony, even in the wilderness. If anyone want's to see what Sedona is like, I suggest this movie.

I'm definitely into these types of stories involving fate or synchronicity, and I do wish there were more of them. But it certainly doesn't mean that any story involving fate or mystical vortices or synchronicity is automatically a good story.

5132112,5,B00854FUC6,"I'm a former resident of Sedona.  Sedona is a magical, momentously gorgeous, comforting and inspiring place.  It's a place to refill with blessings.  It's a place to meet, experience and deepen in one's true being and nature.  It's a multidimensional place that brings us obviously or not so obviously in contact with the Mystery.  That mystery is the presence and intelligence of Spirit.  Great Mystery is one of the names Native Americans have for the Creator.  Sedona is a place to experience the Mystery, to attune to it, be awed by it and revel in it, at least that's how I walked my Sacred Time on the Path while living there and visiting there.

Sedona is a place to visit often, is a place one can experience the Wonder of Life and to be Nourished and fed deeply from its artful Richness.  Go get fed.  Visit.  And when you're missing it and wanting Connection, pop this movie in.

This story is the screenwriter's story.  Each person's experience is unique and Designed especially for them.

The acting is lovely.  The story is heartwarming and becomes charming.  The folks who wrote this have a deep respect and love for Sedona as well as their craft.  They chose wonderful actors and everyone involved made a wonderful movie.  I've seen it five times now.  (Please make more movies.)

I just want to say we can live from Sedona wherever we are, Receive her and Share her with all. I wish you all aquaintance with her, with her Magnificence, her Enchantment and her Spiritual Ecstasy ~ Great Spirit's Gifts to all.  Tend to her carefully and thoughtfully so she is in good shape and healthy for all of creation and for those that will come after us.  I look forward to seeing you on her Red Rock Earth.

This is definitely more of a ladies film or ""men in touch with their feminine side"" if you will. I've been to Sedona a couple of times and have even considered retiring there so the setting already had a special place in my heart. The reason I liked this movie is because whether you're a man or woman we are all stressed out these days to the max. This movie addresses the feeling we all have on occasion when you just can't hold it together any longer and could just cry. This movie reminds us all to slow down and appreciate the beauty that surrounds us everyday.

5132126,4,B00854FUC6,Planning a family trip to Sedona this summer. We wanted to watch this as we get excited for out trip.... The movie is about synchronicity and its a pretty good watch. Love the references to the vortexes and spiritual stuff. We enjoyed it.,1369872000,,238,4.558139534883721
5132127,3,B00854FUC6,This was a fun movie. I liked the cast and the story. I always love seeing Sedona scenery. Plot was a little predictable but I enjoyed the acting.,1369440000,2,146,4.25

5132129,5,B00854FUC6,"I used to live in Sedona, so watching this movie was a treat for me in many ways. The scenery was breath taking, I'm so pleased the movie showed aerial views of this majestic magical vista. The story line was touching and humorous as well with some charming over-the-top ""woo-woo"" characters that truly do exist and makes Sedona, Sedona! I watched this movie an embarrassing amount of times, and each time I caught something I missed prior, like Robert Shields! (remember Shields and Yarnell) I also loved Frances Fisher in this movie and when the movie ends I was left wishing it would go on...and it easily could have! Beth Grant played a wonderful Deb Lovejoy, (who is a real person in Sedona.) It was funny to hear some characters talk about the energy of the ""vortexes"" ...you ask 12 different people about a vortex and you get 12 different answers, I know this because I was a (semi woo-woo) jeep tour driver when I lived there. Love diversity! I think one would enjoy this movie even if you've never lived there, the gorgeous red rocks alone are major eye candy. And if you've never been there, this movie may very well call you (in the vortex) for a visit! ;) Enjoy.",1366761600,2,1174,4.5424528301886795
5132130,3,B00854FUC6,"I'm surprised that this film was rated so highly.  I found the film watchable but not great.  A couple of the main characters, a young man and a middle-aged woman (I forget their names) are anxious and driven, respectively, until the latter quarter of the show.  Their uniform reactions to events, especially on the part of the man, seem one-dimensional and monotonous.  Later, the middle-aged woman's character exhibits a bit of a transformation, which is acted well (in my opinion).  The plot has a resolution but it doesn't seem fulfilling somehow.",1366588800,2,551,5.010989010989011

5132133,3,B00854FUC6,"Beautiful scenery! Entertaining script. Good characters, even if a little extreme. Sweet ending. A movie about accepting our differences - as opposed to judging those not just like us. I enjoyed it. Thanks Tommy Stovall and Frances Fisher !!!",1363910400,,242,5.230769230769231
5132134,4,B00854FUC6,Cute movie and a great story about a world much larger than we could ever imagine.  Really enjoyed it and my husband did too.  I would recommend it.,1363046400,,148,4.25
5132135,1,B00854FUC6,"I first went to Sedona 50 years ago, before it was famous or had as much notoriety. It was a wonderful Spiritual place. For the past 40 years my wife and I have gone there for a week every year. It is still one of the most wonderful places on the planet, and I understand that more visitors come there each year than go to The Grand Canyon.  There really is something very special there, whether you think the Vortexes have anything to do with it or not.

There is a museum in town that shows all the films that have been made there over the years. The current film ""Sedona"" ought to be dubbed the worst film ever made in Sedona.

To begin, the roles that Francis Fisher and Seth Peterson are saddled with have to be two of the most accurate portraits of the most self-centered characters in many a moon. Who on the planet would want to have any type of relationship with them. Nasty, angry, hostile, demanding, childish, obnoxious...... the list just goes on and on.  And even the magic of Sedona couldn't realistically work on them.

None of the other characters in the film seem like real people. Its true that there are some spaced out folks in Sedona. But not any more than anywhere else. And the character played by Lin Shaye is downright embarrassing. She even gives Mentally Ill folks a bad name!

This film is a story waiting somewhere in a writers lair, to be told. Why not a long time resident of Sedona? The way it is presented in it's current form is a road that leads to nowhere. No real story or conclusion, no real people as characters, no point.

However, a person still could not go wrong visiting  the town of Sedona and seeing for yourself what a great place it is.  And with a little luck, you would not meet any of the characters presented in this pointless exercise in wasted film.",1362960000,2,1804,4.377245508982036
5132136,2,B00854FUC6,I wouldn't recommend this movie. Well known people but the acting was bad. The story seemed silly the way it was handled.,1362787200,,121,4.545454545454546
5132137,5,B00854FUC6,"This movie really introduces the viewer to the incredible beauty of Sedona. Not just the scenic beauty, but the beauty Sedona helps you find in yourself. You will feel better about yourself and life in general after watching this movie.",1362528000,2,236,4.925

5132143,5,B00854FUC6,"We bought this movie after having seen it so that we could share it with guests. This is a very fun and poignant movie. Of course, we laugh at many inside jokes as we recognize the minor actors and locations along with remembering some very real stories that were interwoven into the plot.

Great, fun movie that gives an insight into what Sedona is as a very unique destination city.",1358208000,2,384,4.485714285714286
5132144,5,B00854FUC6,"The movie is corny/schmaltzy.  If you live in Sedona or have spent some time there, the movie is fun.  Local people were used as extras and it's fun to see the actual places there.  If you look at it as a just-for-fun movie, it will be.  If you are looking for a strong plot and great acting, you may want to pass on this one.  By the way, this is loosely based on a true story.",1357430400,4,378,3.9210526315789473
5132145,5,B00854FUC6,"Movie with Heart.  Movie that whole family can watch together.  Movie that shows we are all interconnected. Movie that shows the majesty of Sedona. Movie that shows there are no coincidences.  Movie you can relate to, with laughter & a few tears. Movie that address, gay marriage, workaholics, psychics, non mainstream perspectives, teen pregnancy, and so so much more. Lots of special Features...I love Special Features!
Lastly, Tommy Stovall is a wonderful writer/director, who captured SEDONA's essence, her uniqueness as well as the people who live & visit here.  Hollywood we want more films like this.  It would make a great TV series!

Then again, I'm bias.  A character in movie was based on me, Deb Lovejoy.  I'm honored to be portrayed.
Don't take my word.  Watch it today for yourself.  You won't be sorry!",1356825600,2,817,4.985185185185185

5132150,2,B00854FUC6,I love Sedona which is why I watched this movie. It was a sweet simple story with lessons in what is important in life. It sounds better than it is. The scenery is why I stuck it out and watched the whole thing. I didn't see the ending coming though.,1353715200,,250,4.02
5132151,3,B00854FUC6,I was all excited to watch this movie cuz we plan to make a trip to Sedona soon.  Argh!  This move may have ruined the surprise for us and the storyline was pretty lame.  :-(,1353715200,,174,3.914285714285714
5132152,5,B00854FUC6,"Sedona caught me a little off guard not so much in terms of the main core of the story--i.e., stressed-out city dwellers needing to refocus on the true meaning of why they do what they do, with whom and for whom. But its whimsical and magical way of pulling-off this rather hackneyed theme with humor, great acting and rich characters, was a little surprising and in a very good way. I watch a lot of indy films and often see where the story is going, but not so much in this one. The parents of the two young boys are so normal, you forget they're gay. The towns people are so quirky, but believeable and authentic. We forget that in some parts of the country, there really are people who really, REALLY care about how you feel...no, really! Collectively, they work at not making you sweat the small stuff. This is done quite well in the film, I did not dectect a false moment.",1352764800,5,878,4.359756097560975
5132153,4,B00854FUC6,"The Hub + I both watched sedona.  We both enJoyed it. Was somewhat slow and filmtography a bit quirky.  The ending alone was well worth the watch

5132154,5,B00854FUC6,I really like this movie! It is about a small town in Arizona with breathtaking views and eccentric personalities. It centers around events that happen to a gay couple on vacation with their son and and a business woman just passing through. The story was wonderfully done and in its conclusion left me feeling warm and fuzzy. A good family movie! The actors were really awesome for an indie movie. I especially enjoyed the performance of Seth Peterson! He is a fine talented young man who deserves an award for this performance!,1350864000,8,529,4.760869565217392

5132156,3,B00854FUC6,"It's a well written low-budget movie. It's good for what it is, the idea works, Frances Fisher is awesome in it, she's perfect. The photography's OK, it's not exactly epic, some of the street scenes in the local places could have been photographed better, but I know they couldn't just take over the town to film it so they had to do some of it very quickly without getting in the way of the tourists, so it is what it is.",1347148800,,422,4.222222222222222
5132157,1,B00854FUC6,"I can't believe the 17 5-star reviews that have preceded my review.

Sedona is a terrible movie no matter how you judge it.  To say that the story is weak is charitable.  The acting was mostly poor.  The characters had no depth.  The interactions were unrealistic.  The dialog was feeble.  And it was boring except for the red rocks.

I live in Sedona.  I first visited here 22 years ago and have loved it ever since.  It was my favorite vacation spot before moving here.  There was nothing in this movie that reflected any of the things that I love about living or visiting here.  I have never met anyone like the local characters in the movie.  No one just sits on their butt at any business in town or ignores customers.

If you have ever been to the Red Planet Diner, it is an experience in itself.  It can be a fun place to just look around and read the signs and observe the ET decor.  None of that character came out in the movie and the fact that most of the employees are hispanic was also not apparent.  Cultural diversity is one of the things that I love most about Sedona.  Not only do we have Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American residents, but we have a constant influx of international visitors.  The population ranges from the rich and famous to starving artists and new age groupies.  Diverse music and cultural events are commonplace and the art galleries are reminiscent of Santa Fe.  There are great restaurants and fine resorts.  Public art is everywhere.  Housing ranges from vulgar displaces of wealth to mobile homes.  None of this diversity was reflected in the movie.

The only thing that I could relate to was the fact that residents would jump in and help to look for a lost child.

After reading 17 5-star reviews, I was looking forward to buying extra copies of this movie to send to family and friends so that they could see why I love it here so much.  After watching this film, I just hope that it fizzles out before anybody I know sees it.

I couldn't be more disappointed or embarrassed.",1347062400,2,2029,4.455040871934605
5132158,5,B00854FUC6,"I ordered this movie right after I saw the trailer for the first time. It arrived last Friday and I couldn't have wished for a better start of my weekend. This movie made me enjoy my home entertainment system to the max. I watched it on my Philips HD Ambi-light TV, on Blueray with 5.1 surround sound and the visual experience is just fantastic. The music and audio mix also contributed to the best cinematic experience I have ever seen!

The story is just one that stays on your mind and feels good! I can not think of a better cast then the actors we see in Sedona and I love the way humor, coincidence and emotions followed each other up in perfect order. I am very impressed. It makes me want to visit Sedona!

After watching the movie, I watched all the Special Features that are on the disk. Very nice to see the Behind-the-scenes, deleted scenes and gag reel. It even includes an interview with ""the real Deb Lovejoy"", where one of the characters was based on.

Highly recommended!",1346716800,12,988,4.447513812154696
