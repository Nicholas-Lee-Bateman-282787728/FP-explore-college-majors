4961525,5,B0065WELMU,"I was training for a half marathon as an avid runner when I discovered that I was expecting.  I knew that I would need to cut back on my running, but still thought I'd be able to swing a few miles a week in my first trimester.  After becoming seriously winded one day & realizing that I wouldn't be able to run like I had planned throughout my pregnancy, I became overly discouraged and desperate for some sort of aerobic activity that I was use to.  I purchased Expecting More and could not be more pleased with the program.  This is not your average ""workout"" tape.  It is a program that challenges you with cardio & strength training, all the while conscious of what is safe for you and your baby.  I found that I was working the same muscles, just as hard, as I would at the gym pre-pregnancy.  Furthermore, some of the more cardio focused workouts left me just as sweaty as a long- run would, however also feeling strong and empowered.  My favorite of all 6 workouts is the Sweat Sport.  This is just the kind of aerobic activity that I've been craving.  Pregnant and active????  Buy this DVD.  You will not be dissappointed.",1330992000,49,1130,4.405797101449275
4961526,5,B0065WELMU,"This is my wife's second pregnancy and - this time around - she's in much better shape and spirits.  While I wish I could take some credit for her improved mood, I gotta admit it's pretty much about this DVD.  She swam during the end of her last pregnancy, but it wasn't inspiring or satisfying enough for her.  This time around, the little spunky red head on the screen has gotten my wife motivated and moving every single day!  As a husband, I've certainly benefitted from her fitness ;)",1321056000,,489,4.46067415730337
4961527,5,B0065WELMU,"All I have to say is, WOW.  There is nothing else like it!! This video has it ALL!! I've been looking for an exciting energizing all-inclusive pregnancy dvd to keep me motivated, and this is the only one that gives you options.  SO MANY OPTIONS! A calendar with workout for each trimester, cardio, weights, even a yoga/dance element!  There are yoga/pilates/wellness vids up the yin yang, but I don't want to go to sleep or baby myself, I want a workout that's going to make me feel alive, and THIS IS IT!!  To all the expecting moms out there, I HIGHLY recommend this video.  It gives you everything all in one.  And she's so cute and personable. I LOVE Sara! I feel so lucky to have this for my pregnancy!!",1321056000,8,708,4.407692307692308
4961528,2,B0065WELMU,Like workouts but cardio cd came scratched. Just used it as I am on my 2nd trimester and was running previously and I was informed I can't return it. Disappointed,1466985600,,162,4.433333333333334
4961529,3,B0065WELMU,"I found reviews really helpful when selecting an exercise DVD while pregnant. Now that I'm 11 weeks post c-section I thought I would share my thoughts. This review is coming from a non runner and a non gym member. I would do Jillian Michaels 30 day shred or some cardio kettlebell a few times a week prior to pregnancy.

SUZANNE BOWEN'S SLIM & TONED - This was my favorite of the DVDs I bought. I didn't really feel like it was difficult until around 28 weeks but I think it did a good job keeping me toned and strong. The first section of lower body I usually skipped because it didn't feel like it was doing much but the other sections were great. Suzanne is a good instructor and not overly peppy or irritating. I would suggest skipping the plank portion of the arm/upper body workout after 25 weeks or so if you're worried about diastasis recti (I was). It has been a great postpartum workout and I think it will help me transition back to the harder DVDs I was doing pre pregnancy.

PRENATAL FITNESS FIX - All the reviews are right, the production quality of this DVD is amateur. However, it does kind of give an intimate, non intimidating approach to working out. Sometimes it nice when you're pregnant and feeling a little lumpy in your workout gear to look at another woman who is very pregnant and not looking glamourous. She is also very funny in a goofy way which is good when you're not in the mood to workout. She gets you going even if you are laughing through it. I had trouble with the squat portions when she does them very quickly. It would make my knees sore the next day. Besides that it was a good, quick workout.

JENNIFER WOLFE'S PRENATAL VINYASA YOGA: SHORT FORMS - I HATED this DVD. I wish I wouldn't have bought it. Again, the production quality is bad. Maybe I'm too used to the GAIAM yoga DVDS but this was terrible. The instructor reminded me of a new age librarian and the Shavasana was impossible to do with the grating acoustic guitar. The main reason I bought a yoga DVD was to relax and stretch during pregnancy and this was a mega fail. Also, it heavily features downward dog, which if you're worried about diastasis recti then you won't want to do this DVD.

EXPECTING MORE: SARA HALEY - I wish I would have found this DVD earlier in my pregnancy. I didn't buy it until week 33. It has a plan included to help you make the most of the different sections at different stages of your pregnancy. I didn't get to explore the other sections as much as I would have if I started this earlier. Some routines require more space than I had in my living room to move around and some would be great while your belly is smaller but in later stages of your pregnancy it might not be a great idea. She does do some kinda cheesy things like naming moves after baby things and stressing how sexy she wants you to feel in pregnancy. The cardio was great though and the best you'll find in a prenatal DVD. The hip hop dance was too stupid for me to spend time on but if you like dance maybe you'll like it. Now that I'm postpartum I may try portions of this DVD again.",1464998400,8,3086,4.31551724137931
4961530,2,B0065WELMU,"Pre-pregnancy, I was a routine Jillian Michaels & Autumn Calabrese video user. I like a challenging workout in a compact amount of time. This set didn't really offer that for me. I found most of the workouts too easy throughout my first and second trimester, with the exception of the ""sport"" video which did a good job of getting my heart rate up as you are bouncing around constantly for 30mins. I wouldn't recommend this video for anyone who is a veteran of challenging videos or is very fit. This is ideally for an exercise newbie or best saved for the third trimester at which point EVERYTHING feels challenging.",1462924800,,617,4.669724770642202

4961532,5,B0065WELMU,I ran and did Insanity prior to pregnancy. I ordered several pre-natal DVDs and felt like most of them were too easy.  I started doing this DVD at 20 weeks and am now 26. This DVD offers a variety and the work-outs have options for making them more/less challenging which I love.,1455148800,,279,4.365384615384615
4961533,5,B0065WELMU,"I absolutely love this workout series because she has a great personality and the exercises are fun she helps you connect with your baby and still really focus on tough exercise..

The toughest exercise workout in the series is sweat sport it is super challenging and you will sweat your rear end off literally it feels like in advanced metcon workout that you would do before you were pregnant but for pregnant women lol so you can move.

The sweat sport while only in the schedule for the last trimester once per month I do it 3 times per week and I'll do that up through week 32 I am currently week 28.

My next favorite is synergy where you alternate cardio and strength although she recommends up to five pounds I used 8 pounds to really get a nice pump because I usually lift very heavy weights.

My least favorites are the salutations because it's really not stretching yoga it's more standing yoga and if you have swollen feet frankly it might cause a little pain so you'd be better off doing something that is stretching and relieving of the fluid buildup.

Frank's up is a standing strength exercise combo it's just too easy if you're already used to weight lifting so I'd recommend anything up the wait in order to get that as a workout or just use it as a burnout to another workout. All in all a great series with great personalities and if you're tired from a heavy day you could always use the ones I think are light as recovery days.",1453420800,,1449,4.411985018726591

4961535,5,B0065WELMU,"I walked occasionally during my first trimester, but morning sickness coupled with winter weather has kept me far less active than I would have liked. One way to keep the nausea at bay has been eating almost constantly, which has resulted in gaining more weight than I should. I've felt like an ever-expanding slug. During my first pregnancy (10 years ago when I was 24), I was too afraid to workout, gained over 50 lbs, and felt terrible. I am deteremined that this time, now aged 34, I won't put on as much and be as sedentary.

I am now 15 weeks and have just finished this workout. I love it! I have a dance background, and I prefer workouts that are more dancy and choreographed to keep my mind busy. I hate running or walking on a treadmill or strength training because I get too bored. This has just enough choreography to keep me interested, but not so much that it's difficult to learn or follow along. There are three different cardio workouts and three different strength training workouts, each about 50 minutes long, so it offers good variety. This is a good workout and can be modified in intensity. The continual references to baby are a little annoying, but they do help to keep you focused on not over-taxing yourself.

If you're like me and you prefer dancy workout classes like zumba or step, I definitely recommend you purchase this DVD.",1452297600,,1357,4.580246913580247
4961536,3,B0065WELMU,"This video is supposed to be designed for moms who are already fit before pregnancy and I wouldn't really say that's true. The workouts are very padded in lots of chatting and 'dance routines' and she's almost in costume for some of them. I take working out seriously and I felt like this was geared towards someone who needed to be motivated and promised a good time to keep working out. The workouts themselves have a much more aerobic, dance/zumba vibe than I expected which is also just not my taste. I felt like I had gotten a workout at the end but not that I had been challenged- I was basically dry at the end of every workout which is not my expectation after 45 minutes.  If you're used to working out hardcore and like a down to business workout routine this is not for you.",1450051200,2,785,4.340136054421769

4961539,3,B0065WELMU,"I do like it, I feel like generally the workouts are pretty good, I took a star away because all the baby references for moves are very annoying. Like passing the bottle instead of saying row or pushing the stroller instead of push up- its too cutesy. Those who are doing this workout know they are pregnant, and don't need a constant baby reminder. Its just annoying",1435622400,,367,4.492537313432836
4961540,4,B0065WELMU,"Started at the close of my second trimester because I needed a workout that took my pregnancy into consideration. I found there were too many plank exercises included within Sara Haley's workouts (which would have been fine had I started in my first trimester...but later in pregnancy a no-no considering I had developed diastasis recti).  Nevertheless, Expecting More is worth the cash- I've been using it at least 4 times a week since purchasing.  Only bugger is avoiding the planks in the workouts.",1432425600,,501,5.024096385542169
4961541,5,B0065WELMU,"I have bought about 12 workout videos since being pregnant. I had a really difficult time finding workouts that were challenging enough since there weren't may reviews online, so here is my review. I hope you find it helpful!

Pre-pregnancy I ran around 20 miles a week, and did an addition 2-4 strength days a week. I am very active and in good shape. However, After my first two months of pregnancy I couldn't run anymore, so I started looking for ways to build muscle safely and effectively as well as find alternative cardio routines. I am 38 weeks pregnant, and can still perform all of these videos. I have seen muscle gain (as has my husband and mid-wives who compliment how well I've stayed in shape!), and I can't wait until I loose this bit of baby fat to really see the definition! The following are my favorite 4 videos that I really found challenging and effective, as well as great for times I have had more or less energy throughout pregnancy. They have really helped keep me in shape when I couldn't run or do military-like workouts anymore!

1. Fit+Sleek Prenatal Physique with Leah Sarago. Moderate/difficult. The weight portions allow you to add additional weight so you can continue to challenge yourself. Easy to mix and match and repeat sections for more reps. My favorite on this video is the upper body and ab portions. I usually do two workouts twice per per day when doing this video. The lower body is also very good. It's also a nice video for when you don't have a lot of time or energy to have the option of doing a 15-30 minute workout since each section is just 15 minutes. Has a good workout suggestion guide. Also, the pre-natal stretch is AMAZING!

2. Expecting More with Sara Haley: Moderate/Difficult. Okay, so this one I have mixed feelings. Over all, I do love it since the workouts are longer (Around an hour, depending) and they are very effective. She just kind of gets on my nerves sometimes with her silly dance moves and the tone she uses. You do have to be careful and be sure to follow moderation's if you aren't as fit--some of the jumping and twisting around can be scary if you don't know how to do it right. She is good at her instructions and making sure you and baby stay safe. Over all, some of these are very challenging, and some are easier. I love the cardio portions, though her strength portions are great, and you will want bumb-bells. Also is a fun video if you like to dance!

3. Long and Lean prenatal Workout with Suzanne Bowen: Easy/Moderate. This was one of my first prenatal videos, and still one of my favorites. I do this one on the days where I have no energy. It does a good job working shoulders and your lower body groups. In the past couple months I have added light weights (3-5lbs) to some of the arm and squat portions to challenge myself more. There is no cardio, really, but is a nice, effective Pilates style workout. My sister, who is a Marine, did this one with me some months after having her 3rd child and felt a little sore the next day. This is one that will def get easier pretty quick if you are moderately to in good shape. But it is effective enough, and more relaxing on those super sleepy, growing a baby days :)

4. The Perfect Pregnancy Workout with Karyne Steben. Moderate/Difficult. LOVE this workout! Karyne is a world class athlete and this video shows that. This chick is buff! I have been doing this video for about 6 months, and still find it a little challenging. She covers all main muscle groups, lower body, abs, back, side-body, in very safe and effective ways. I do feel most of the focus is in the upper back and arms, so you will def be feeling this the next day! You will want dumb-bells this one. This video is a bit relaxing in style, and it is a bit on the old fashion side (as far as music and quality), but it is really great and one of my favorites.

All of these videos have great stretch portions that I feel are very effective in getting baby where he/she needs to be for delivery, and really helps get your body get into optimal shape for delivery as well. Like I said, my mid-wives have complimented me on how well I have stayed in shape, and my husband has taken lots of notice, too. He thinks I have more muscle on me now than I did pre-pregnancy! I do these videos about 5 times a week and have felt healthy and good throughout my pregnancy. I hope my review helps you!",1432339200,27,4393,4.397293972939729
4961542,3,B0065WELMU,I really tried to like this workout. If you like dancing and choreographed steps this program is for you. Great pregnancy workout... just not my style.,1430265600,,151,4.846153846153846
4961543,5,B0065WELMU,"I loved this video for keeping fit during my pregnancy. I consider myself ""in shape"" and found other prenatal workout videos too slow or too easy. I had transitioned from doing the Jillian Michaels videos in the first tri to this one once those were too difficult. These videos gave me a push so I broke a sweat while still feeling great and not over-extending my body. I also enjoyed her muscle building exercises. The only drawback I found was that, at times, the workout seemed too intense, despite me thinking I was in good shape. She moves fast, so perhaps that is part of the challenge. There are many options with this video to keep your work-outs interesting and fun. In fact, I wish Sara had a good post natal video because I really liked her production and her teaching style. If you're pregnant and want to stay fit, I highly recommend this video.",1429056000,,858,4.541935483870968

4961545,2,B0065WELMU,"Let me preface by saying I did only do 1 of the workouts.  However, that one workout was not for me!  First, it was 1:10 long!  I do not have time for that with a 2 year old running around.  Second, I wasn't aware I would need a very specific chair for support... knee height seat with raised back... Third, the workout required a lot of room to grapevine and dance around said chair.

I will say that the workout did make we sweat a little and I did feel it in my glutes and quads the next day, but I would rather go back to T25 with the low impact modifications.",1428796800,,564,4.0
4961546,3,B0065WELMU,"I haven't done all the workouts on this yet but I did do 1. I found the cardio to be too complicated. I am really not that coordinated nor am I a dancer. Maybe it would get easier the more you do it but incorporating arms and legs together, back and forth, turning around and cha's cha's for cardio was just too much. I'd rather have it simple but effective- getting my heart rate up. I get that she wants you to have fun with it but I was more frustrated than anything which took away from my workout.

It is a detailed workout with a calendar which is also good. She tries to make it fun, calling a lot of her moves by names that a mommy would understand.",1426377600,,657,4.053846153846154
4961547,5,B0065WELMU,"These DVD's are a great workout. I like the variety of cardio, strength, and stretching. I definitely break out in a sweat and hard breathing when I work out.

I'm pregnant in winter so walking outside is no longer an option because it's either too cold or too dark. I feel that this program helps me feel better. You don't over do it but work out enough that you feel good after your done! I would recommend this to other pregnant women who are looking for a safe workout during pregnancy. I hope to be able to keep it up until at least 36 weeks. 40 if I'm lucky!! :),1420588800,,485,3.9591836734693877

4961553,4,B0065WELMU,Sara is fun and upbeat.  Sometimes the baby references are a little overkill.  Daily Sweat is her motto and that definitely happens in every workout.  I like the chances that she gives you to bump it up a notch.,1409356800,,211,4.358974358974359
4961554,2,B0065WELMU,"I noticed some of the most recent reviews are similar to how I feel about this dvd. I hesitated buying it during my first pregnancy because I had time for the gym but I splurged on the $40 (regret spending that much) for my second pregnancy because I wanted an option to exercise at home. From reading the good reviews this dvd seems really appreciated by women who were fit and active before pregnancy and that it gave them a good workout. However I am totally disappointed and do not recommend it. I was a runner and doing mostly Les Mills gym stuff as well as Insanity and Turbofire at home.
This dvd is just ridiculous.... The cardio is not challenging at all and it is just ridiculously cheesy, it is insufferable! The weights is tolerable and the Sweat Down core portion is actually decent but it's not worth the money just for that. Also the Salutations which I thought would be yoga-based was not at all. I think what really got me also is that she cues terribly I feel like I was always one step behind and I never have issues like that at the gym or with other dvds. And finally the whole ""be sexy"" thing is just irritating. Do not buy this, there are much better free workouts for pregnancy on youtube and better dvds. I enjoy the 10min pilates for a light workout and for a tough yoga session try Prenatal Vinyassa with Jennifer Wofle it's amazing and I never get bored of it.",1407888000,2,1388,4.362934362934363

4961556,3,B0065WELMU,"The strength ones are fine, but the cardio ones are not my style. I initially stumbled upon this DVD after searching for replacements for my Jilliam Michaels DVDs and P90X program upon becoming pregnant. Anyone who does either or both knows that it's straight forwards and mainly about strength. No silly dancing or ""you're so sexy"" garbage. I am not a dancer and am not into building dance-like routines because I'm just not good at it. Well, the cardio segments of this DVD are ridiculous if the silliness is something you hate (like me!). In the ""Funk"" one, I just about died when she came out with flat bottom high tops on. The Sweat Sport one is better and has decent exercises, but does have ""hip slaps"" and then at the end ""It's Performance Time"" and you're doing your ""routine"" all assembled. Just really not in tune with the types of DVDs and workouts I was used to, so if you're similar to me, you might want to avoid this.",1407196800,7,933,4.4941176470588236
4961557,5,B0065WELMU,"When you're pregnant, working out just doesn't work out so well some days. This series gives you your choice of warmup, main exercise, and cool-down, so on days when I'm ready to burn some calories, I go for it, but on days when I go from the porcelain bowl back to the living room before I've even started, I choose an easier track.

You'll have to get over the cheesiness (though this one isn't as bad as some others), with exercises such as the ""carseat lift"" and the ""show your baby.""

4961562,3,B0065WELMU,"I purchased this DVD set after reading reviews by women who sounded similar to me (active, athletic girls who were struggling to find appropriate workouts during pregnancy). I felt like I had the wind knocked out of me 1st trimester so this workout regimen seemed like it would get me motivated and back on the horse...well, not quite. I think at least half the workouts (there are 6) take an hour and many of the segments are quite repetitive, which can get old really fast--especially since the idea of this DVD set is to do one of the workouts every day, five days a week. If I followed that regimen initally, I would have thrown the DVD out the window. It's too repetitive and the baby-themed moves can be annoying.  So instead I would recommend using these workouts to supplement a weekly workout regimen; I pick maybe two of these per week to mix in with yoga, weight training and walking outdoors. I do feel that the exercises are appropriate for most women active before pregnancy,  and are particularly effective later in pregnancy. You could definitely do worse than this DVD when it comes to prenatal exercise videos, but I guess I was ""expecting more"" based on the glowing reviews.",1393372800,,1193,4.6761904761904765
4961563,3,B0065WELMU,"Before pregnancy I was doing Insanity and TurboFire, so I was looking for a workout program that was somewhat comparable.  The workouts are decent, if you follow the schedule you get each part of the body during the week.  The first trimester (""Sexy""...??) workout plan is alright but you barely break a sweat, so I just went right into the second trimester schedule so I felt like I was actually working out.  Overall a pretty good workout.

The bad: I find it really annoying that Sara Haley renames almost every workout with some variation of the word ""baby"" or something to do with babies.  So you're ""saying goodbye to baby"" and ""peek-a-boo"" and all kinds of weird stuff.  Yes, I'm having a baby, but I don't need every movement I make to have a baby reference.  Secondly, Sara Haley is a bit creepy.  While doing hip sways she has this weird look to her face that looks a bit suggestive and porn-star, and some of her comments are just plain strange.  The music is pretty awful, but I just turn it off and play my own music so I don't hear the comments or the music.",1392854400,9,1072,4.428571428571429
4961564,3,B0065WELMU,"Sara Haley puts in too many dance-like moves that make it difficult to follow along. The moves change fast and the step work can be abrupt. I do like the strength segments. There are different workouts to choose from that make it less repetitive. Does challenge you especially if you were working out before pregnancy. Working out during pregancy is a must! Don't worry about miscarriange, be more concerned with gestational diabetes and hypertension. The workouts helped diminish morning sickness. What better than adrenaline and endorphins to help erase it?",1391385600,2,559,5.222222222222222

It's way more challenging than all the prenatal yoga videos you see.  I was actually surprised at how hard it was, which made me feel good about spending the money.  I do kind of wish there wasn't routines for everything.  I'd rather lift some weights and check it off on my list than learn a bunch of dance moves and have ""fun"".  And... she's a little too cheery about us having babies inside our bellies and feeling sexy.  At the same time.  It creeps me out.",1385337600,2,605,4.292035398230088

I prefer a higher intensity work out.  This is for all levels of fitness (there are options for slowing down or speeding up), and I feel like I've had an amazing work out every time.  It gives you 6 different workouts, so I never get bored.  (if you are feeling a little blah, there's an option for a slower paced exercise regimen you can mainly do while laying on the floor) Well worth spending a little more $.",1383004800,3,576,4.296296296296297

I tried to continue it, but I became winded far too quickly so I searched for a pregnancy dvd that would still be challenging to me. This one fits the bill.  I have tried all three strength workouts and the first cardio workout.  I loved them all. I was sweating pretty well, yet not completely out of breath so I still felt like I got a good workout, yet I knew I was safe for my growing baby.  My only complaint is that there is something wrong with my cardio dvd. There is no menu option. When I put the dvd in, it just starts to play the first cardio set.  Obviously there is supposed to be a menu option since the calendar shows 3 different workouts. Oh well...luckily it does allow me to skip ahead, but its super annoying.",1377043200,,807,4.220779220779221
4961570,4,B0065WELMU,"The highlights of this workout
1) The variety!  6 work-outs keeps things fresh.  My last pregnancy I only had the Perfect Pregnancy Workout and South Beach Prenatal yoga (both of which are great) and I got bored after many months of the same thing.
2) Her knowledge.  I completely trust that I am safe while doing these work-outs.  Many pre-natal workouts are simply fit women who are pregnant.  It is extremely obvious that Sara is well-educated in pre-natal fitness.  The work-outs, warm-ups and cool downs are extremely focused on what problems you may have in pregnancy that differ from your regular work-out life.  ie. fluid retention in wrists and ankles, strengthening joints that will become weak from relaxin.
3) The Calandar is fantastic.  With 6 work-outs to choose from, it may be hard to know where to start or what to do on each day.  THere is a calendar that breaks down a 4 week schedule for each trimester.
4) Legs!  Finally a prenatal workout that knows women do not want to get fat thighs!

What you'll Need
a mat, 3 and 5 lb weights.

The small negatives
1) Although clearly coming from a dance background Sara is often off with the music. I""m not sure if this is because the music was dubbed in later or not.  It is only really maddening during the sweat sport, and sweat funk.  But if you learn the routine's quickly you can tune out the off time instructions and timing and do it in time with the music yourself
2) I was hoping that Salutations would be more yoga based.  It feels rather pointless, although there are some great parts in it for a third trimester, but i will likely use my South Beach PreNatal Yoga on most Salutation days in the schedule.
3) the work-outs are rather long for a busy Mom.  Some are over an hour with warm-up and cool-down.  It usually takes up my sons entire nap to do them, but worth it.

Altogether, I really enjoy the work-outs.  I have gotten much stronger in my upper body already (have completed one month of the workouts) Yes, it's cheesy, but I think I read so many reviews saying this, that it was not nearly as bad as I expected.  She uses a lot of baby terms for exercises, but she is great at using them to create imagery to help engage your muscles correctly (hug your baby to your spine).  She is energetic, fit and fun.  I look forward to my work-out every day.",1376611200,,2332,4.4504716981132075
4961571,4,B0065WELMU,"I was looking for something that was challenging.  Prior to pregnancy, I was an avid CrossFitter.  I tried to continue but I was really concerned about my heart rate the entire time thus I didn't think that I was getting an effective workout.  My gym wasn't really equipped to coach pregnant woman so I stopped going...mentally, it was the better choice for me (even if they could give me appropriate modifications).

Expecting More is challenging (not as challenging as CrossFit but I wasn't looking for that type of intensity either).  I maintained a good heart rate throughout the workout and worked up a good sweat. The ONLY thing that is distracting in the video is that Sara Haley doesn't seem to have good rhythm.  There's this generic background music that feels like it was added after the video was shot.  I tend to enjoy videos that have more upbeat and engaging music than this one contains.  Once I started to ignore her cues and the music though (and just listen to her instructions) I was fine.",1376611200,,1009,4.693181818181818
4961572,4,B0065WELMU,"If you are like me, then you are a woman who works out regularly, likes a challenge,....and just found out you are pregnant.  I think this DVD series is for you.

The workouts are definitely a challenge during pregnancy, as your muscles are wanting to turn to mush from all the hormones, you get winded for no apparent reason, and well, you just don't feel like you. Sara has you bouncing around during cardio, doing planks, push ups, and even burpees with the assistance of a chair, and has you ""pulling baby close"" aka sucking in your abs throughout each workout. What I find most impressive is she is in her third trimester and does the advanced versions of each move herself (one can dream!).

She does regularly emphasize listening to your body...as I am discovering...every day is different. Many of the moves are geared towards strengthening and stretching those areas that will be worked during labor and child birth (hips, inner thighs, core), or are getting tight throughout pregnancy (back, shoulders, ankles). All the while, you do sweat and feel challenged even if a lot of it feels silly.

I personally can't get into the hair tossing ""be sexy"" parts of some of the workouts. I feel anything but that right now.  I also find the use of baby related names for some of the moves a bit over the top (for example, she calls a row ""Get the car seat"" or something like that). Secondly, if you are on carpet, you can't really do a lot of the add-ons she puts into her cardio routines as I can't quite move my feet that quick (good for her that she can) on carpet. Lastly...some of the workouts will take up a full hour of your day...which I personally don't have.

In the end, it does what it's designed to do; it gives you great tips on how to exercise safely while still challenging the more fit mother to be.",1373328000,,1818,4.493939393939394

It is really comprehensive and makes me feel good afterwards.  I am 7 month pregnant and I just started with this DVD a month ago and so far, I am really impressed with the DVD's content and Sara's teaching style.  As a physiotherapist and Pilates instructor, I am very picky when it comes to exercise safety, appropriate cuing, and instructor body mechanics and so far, Sara's DVD exceeded my expectations.

Prior to doing Sara's DVD, I did group classes at the gym too and even though I did get a workout, I feel much more refreshed but challenged after doing the different workouts on this DVD.

I've had a lot of trouble finding prenatal workout dvds that are actually somewhat challenging (I was very fit before pregnancy and wanted to maintain that level of fitness), but this one does the trick. With the 6 different workouts, Sara makes everything fun and keeps your body strong and healthy with cardio, sculpting, dancing, stretching and more. Though she can seem a bit cheesy at times, I kind of enjoy it - it's fun to let loose and break a sweat (safely) with your baby. :) I really like that she shows modifications for people of all fitness levels too, so if you're not feeling very good a certain day you can tone it down a bit. If you're feeling energetic, though, she encourages you to bump it up!

4961589,5,B0065WELMU,"This is an excellent DVD and in my opinion, all you need for the entire pregnancy.  I used to run, lift, and do vinyasa yoga.  This is my first pregnancy, and I thought keeping up my running routine would cut it, but it didn't.  I was putting on too much weight and getting de-conditioned.  This DVD fixed everything.  Here are my pros and cons

Pros:
1. Many different workouts to chose from based on how you're feeling that day.  There is also a calendar for the whole 9 months if you want that choice made for you.  Each 'workout' is truly a workout and you don't have to do multiple a day.

2. Throughout the workout, Sara shows and talks you through how to 'step it up' if you want more of a challenge.  During aerobic workouts, there are two pregnant guides being her: one who keeps it at a basic level and one who is doing the more challenging move.  I had no idea how my body would vary day to day and this is very helpful

3. Graphics tell you when it's a good time to do a kegel or take a water break- I found this a nice added benefit

4. She is super motivating throughout the workout.

Cons:
1. You need small free weights for some of the workouts, although I imagine you can do it without them
2.  Some of the moves are a little racy for pregnancy.  I found this a pro, because I feel less than sexy pregnant, and this helped me embrace it, but I imagine some women would blush doing some of the stretches.

4961593,4,B0065WELMU,"My baseline level of fitness was decent- I worked out 3 - 4 days per week doing Jillian/ some P90x/ yoga/ boot camp style with a personal trainer. Sacroiliac pain during this pregnancy has made running painful. I found these workouts to be helpful for cardio training- more interesting than a stair stepper to me. It would be accurate to say that she is cheesy at times, but I found it to be so ridiculous that it made me laugh. Who names a dance move ""Don't touch my baby?"" I am not really into music so the lack of interesting music didn't bother me, but one of my pregnant friends found the dance video to be too boring because of it. I felt that the videos held my attention and I got a good workout (sweaty, heart rate up, time went by fast). My three favorite workouts are the weight/aerobic combo, dance video, and sporty aerobic video. Otherwise, the salutation video is a little slow and I just felt neither relaxed nor that I had a good workout with it. The weight training videos were fine, but not as challenging as other videos. The weight videos may be appropriate if you want a light weight workout or are further on in your 3rd trimester.

I looked at a lot of options, but most seemed geared towards women who weren't active prior to pregnancy.

4961595,5,B0065WELMU,"There has been a real revolution in workout videos over the last 10 years but good options for prenatal workouts really lagged.  Most of the ""workouts"" available were a joke for any woman who was already in shape and wanted to maintain their fitness.  Thankfully, this has started to change over the last couple of years and this is one of two recent (and excellent) additions that truly provide REAL workouts for those of us who are preggers and fit.

This program comes with 6 different workouts that can be performed through all 3 trimesters.  There are 3 strength training and 3 cardio workouts that range from 35 minutes to just over an hour.  For the strength training workouts, one is a more conventional  workout with hand weights that targets mostly upper body with some lower body work (Sweat Strong Up).  There is a mat-based workout that focuses on the core (Sweat Strong Down) and one yoga-based workout (Salutations).  For the cardio, there is a strength-training cardio fusion (synergy), a hip hop zumba stule dance mix (Sweat Funk), and a more athletic program (Swat Sport).  This also comes with a calendar of suggested workouts for each week of your pregnancy.

This workout requires hand weights (3-8 lbs), a chair, and a mat.  This has some pretty good core work in the Sweat Strong Down portion.  Sara Haley is definitely knowledgable and provides good demonstration of form.  While Sara looks to be in her second trimester, some of the workouts have a woman in her first trimester and one in her third to demonstrate modifications.  This has some nice plyometrics and balance work.

There are some minor cons to this set.  Sara can get a little too cutesy with the names of her moves and the music is rather uninspiring.  However, the breadth of the workouts and the all-in-one quality easily make this a 5 star product.

She does a great job explaining each move; sometimes the camera angle cuts off the footwork, but after a couple of times doing each workout, it's easy to follow along anyway.  I bought this along with Karyne Steben's ""Perfect Pregnancy Workout.""  This one is a lot more fun, but I'm glad to have the other one, too.

It has high and low impact options and encourages you to listen to your body and decide what's right for you. There are several great cardio and strength segments so you can tailor your workout according to how much time/energy you have. I don't think this would be a great choice for beginning exercisers during pregnancy (I am fairly fit, still able to run 6 - 7 miles in less than an hour), but otherwise I definitely recommend it - even over the The Perfect Pregnancy Workout which I know ladies also love.

I think they are all great excersises, especially during the winter when it becomes too cold to exercise outside.  The only drawback I have is that I think after 9 monthes of the same limited number of workouts, this will start to get VERY old.  I wish she had more workouts on the DVD.  I will probably supplement this DVD with another so that I don't get so bored of them all.  These are great workouts for the moderate exerciser.",1351382400,,517,4.34375
4961604,5,B0065WELMU,I can't say enough about how much I loved this workout program. I worked out while pregnant with all 3 of my kiddos (all 3 & under now) & own more workout DVDs than I care to admit. THIS IS THE BEST.  Sara...will you release a post-baby workout series?!? These workouts were fun & tough & challenged me all the way through my pregnancy.,1350864000,,336,4.25
4961605,5,B0065WELMU,"I'm 14 weeks into my second pregnancy and wanted a DVD workout that was going to challenge me.  Pre-pregnancy I've done everything from P90X, insanity, turbo jam, Chalene Extreme, Jillian Michael's Body Revolution...During my first pregnancy I found and enjoyed Summer Sanders' DVD, but I felt that I could still do more and wasn't working hard enough.  I wanted something easy that I could just push play and be on my way without coming up with my own modifications.  Sara Haley's EXPECTING MORE is fantastic.  She is inspirational (she filmed the workouts while she was 7 months pregnant).  I find the workouts to be challenging, interesting, and just the right amount of time at 30 min to 40 min long.  This is by far the best DVD workout for pregnancy that I've found so far (and I have several others).  It's worth the price for 3 trimesters of motivating workouts.  Thank you, Sara!",1350259200,,888,4.758169934640523
4961606,5,B0065WELMU,"When I found out I was expecting, one of the first things I did was order Expecting More.  Leading up to my pregnancy, I was running regularly and taking various classes at my gym and I knew I wanted to maintain the level of fitness I was used to as this baby grew.  I also knew I was going to need to alter my workout habits a bit to keep both of us healthy.  Sara Haley's Expecting More seemed like the perfect way to reach both of these goals.  And it has been!  I started doing the Expecting More program my sixth week of pregnancy and now I'm at my 20th week and still going strong.  I love that there is a weekly workout schedule for each trimester because it keeps me on track and motivated - just like having my own personal trainer.  Plus, since there are six different workouts and different combinations of each during the week, I haven't gotten bored yet!  That is a huge advantage to this program.  I look forward to ""getting my daily sweat on"" (as Sara says) because there is variety to the workout.  Sara Haley is a great motivator and I love that she is pregnant throughout the series.  The fact that she is in her final trimester as she taped this makes me feel more secure in the safety and efficiency of the program.  I also love that she encourages you to modify based on how you're feeling daily - because the way you feel changes throughout your pregnancy.  I've felt great this entire pregnancy and think that has a lot to do with Expecting More.  I plan on continuing using Expecting More until the end.  And the next time around too!  I'd recommend this program to any woman who wants to feel fit and healthy throughout their pregnancy!  It's fun, it has variety and it is effective!",1349395200,,1708,4.337539432176656

It is worth the higher price because you are getting 6 great workouts that can be done on different levels. I never have to worry if the exercises are safe because Sara is pregnant and doing them too. If you are desperately searching for a workout to help you stay in shape and feel sexy then this video is for you. It is especially great for women who have been physically active before. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this exercise DVD and would recommend it to anyone!",1347321600,,599,4.357142857142857
4961608,5,B0065WELMU,For my first pregnancy I had about 4 different DVD workouts that I used. They were good but I always felt that they lacked in the cardio area (tons directed towards yoga). This DVD set tops the lot. Firstly Sara is not annoying (in fact I actually like her!)...a great factor when you use it as often as you should. Second- she is working out with you while heavily pregnant (very motivating) and thirdly it really really gets you sweating and has plenty of workouts so you don't get bored with the repetition. I am 22 weeks pregnant and feel very happy with the energy this DVD gives me. I use it when my 18 month old is napping and you don't need a tons of space (we live in a small apartment). I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to stay fit and healthy during pregnancy! I was worried about the fact that it was more expensive but it's worth every penny (you don't need to buy 4 different DVDs because this has plenty of diversity).,1346976000,,947,4.29608938547486

There are tailored work outs for each trimester and the host is really good at pointing out that some days you'll be able to do a lot and other days you may not, so listen to what your body tells you.  She good at reminding you of that throughout the workouts as well as to take breaks and drink water when needed.  This just seems to be a good realistic work out dvd for expecting moms.",1346457600,,449,4.137931034482759
4961610,5,B0065WELMU,"My first pregnancy I had not been working out much before getting pregnant, well not in a long while at least.  I loved the Summer Saunders DVD back then.

4961611,5,B0065WELMU,"""Expecting More"", was released at the perfect time for my pregnancy.  Before finding out I was pregnant, I was busy working out to Barre 3, Tracy Anderson, and kickboxing dvd's. My goal for the new year was to get fit and lose a few lbs.  But, in late January, I was pleasantly surprised I was expecting, and tried to continue with my normal dvd's.  But, when the first trimester pregnancy fatigue kicked in, I was out of commission for a long time... I knew, I would get back to fitness (someday), but I had to have a different approach... Something, safe for baby, but that offered variety.  That's how I discovered ""Expecting More""!  Once I was feeling back to my old self, during the second trimester, this dvd made me feel challenged, energized, and confident.  Sara is an amazing trainer.  She keeps it real and you can relate to her.  I think one of the things I appreciate the most, is she's pregnant (she gained 30lbs.) and sweating as much as me!  She's great with how she involves baby and her cueing is amazing.  I never feel behind or off with the moves she uses.  I really enjoy segments: synergy, salutations, and sweat sport.  Even though, my third trimester has been a roller coaster of high and low energy, I do my best to get fitness in at least 3-4x's a week.  This far along, my goal is to just feel good and hope baby feels good too!  I care about my weight, but I feel ""Expecting More"" has helped me keep my weight in check without stressing too much.  Overall, ""Expecting More"" is a great dvd to own.  It gives you variety, a challenge, good guidance, you feel empowered and strong, boost energy, and is fun for baby too!  So worth the money!  I hope Sara releases more dvd's like it (something for new mom's hopefully) and I plan to include it in my early, post-natal fitness regimen.",1344816000,,1809,4.446808510638298
4961612,5,B0065WELMU,"I was in the habit of working out 4-5 times a week when I got pregnant.  For the first trimester, I was able to keep up my normal routine with some simple modifications, but once the second trimester started I needed something more geared toward the changes happening to my body.  I'm almost 8 months pregnant and after using this program for a month, I am very pleased at how challenging it is, yet I don't feel like I'm abusing my body.  Great purchase, well worth it!",1344384000,,470,4.379310344827586
4961613,5,B0065WELMU,"I love this workout video. I am 24 weeks pregnant and was diligent in working out pretty vigorously prior to pregnancy. All of the pregnancy workouts I came across were highly focused on yoga and/or were not much of a physical challenge. I didn't feel like I was getting a workout. So I continued to use my P90X videos and Jillian Michaels workouts but would modify them greatly of course. Frustrated and tired of having to modify, I did a search again and came across Expecting More. I absolutely love the variety of the workouts, the intensity is just right and you get a great workout in a decent amount of time. On average, each workout is about 35-50 minutes. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to continue to workout while pregnant and be safe for baby and effective for you!",1344297600,,791,4.538461538461538
4961614,5,B0065WELMU,"I am pregnant with my second child and needed a way to work out at home while my first child was napping. (With my first pregnancy, I worked out with a trainer at the gym) I found this video to be flexible yet challenging and fun too. I highly recommend it!!!",1342483200,,259,4.098039215686274
4961615,5,B0065WELMU,"I would like to echo the praise of other reviewers for Sara Haley's Expecting More workout series. I am pregnant with our 4th and this is the first time I have found a prenatal workout program where I actually still feel like I am exercising. I have found since having children that I'm so much more successful when I can go downstairs to the basement to exercise or outside to run than trying to work in time to get to a gym. What I've been missing is the strength training (and I cannot bring myself to run with my expanding belly), and these workouts have been really ideal for that too!

Aside from the normal part of having to lose post-pregnancy lbs, I may even be in better shape for muscle tone after my pregnancy than before from the sculpting/strength segments. And I will definitely be on the lookout for other workout programs from Sara to help get my pre-baby body back!

As a side note: My son is 3  years old and he has been in the room on multiple occasions when I've been working out. The first time I did the warm up he asked, ""Why did she say sexy and strong?"" Since then, if he sees me doing it he'll say, ""I want her to say `sexy and strong!'"" It cracks me up.  Thank you, Sara!!",1342224000,,1200,4.22707423580786
4961616,5,B0065WELMU,"I take fitness, or living a fit lifestyle, pretty seriously. Plain and simple, it makes me feel good. I've worked out 5-6x a week my entire pregnancy and I haven't ""taken it easy"". I'm doing what I was doing before I got pregnant with modifications (more now than ever). I listen to my body and I do what I can for that particular day. Most importantly, whatever I'm doing, it's safe for me and safe for baby.

I am late in my third trimester and working out at the gym isn't working for me anymore (especially when you look like you're going to pop). I can usually blow off impulsive comments but in the gym it's different. The comments like ""be careful"" and ""are you sure you should be doing that?"" are too much for me to take anymore.

So I have taken my workout routine to my living room.
I'm lucky to live in a place where I be outdoors year round, but I also like to lift and do bouts of cardio so I picked up Sara's DVD and I think it's amazing! I get my liting fix so I can feel strong without having to put up with the comments. I think my next pregnancy I will follow her calendar, but since I'm so late in my pregnancy I've been doing the workouts that feel suitable for me that day. I especially love the salutations. We all need a down day. :)

I think the DVD is suitable for anyone, beginner or someone who has been working out for a while. Sara challenges you, but most important makes it fun and safe.",1341792000,,1418,4.149090909090909
4961617,5,B0065WELMU,"This is an amazing video!! I love it because not only is it a wonderful workout, but because it is a wonderful workout for the pregnant woman!  I consider myself very fit: I did a triathlon and 30 day power yoga challenge in my first trimester and a half marathon in my second.  However, by the third trimester I had to shorten the duration of my running and biking workouts, but not only that- they were making my hips so sore and I was waddling in pain!  Even power yoga was not relieving my pain.  So I bought this workout video and tried it one night, doing the easiest workout (salutations, because I had already worked out that day), and ended up not only getting a great workout but experiencing relief of my hip pain!  I have just tried one other workout so far, but because I loved that so much I wanted to write a review immediately!  With my second workout I was again challenged, and I feel both strong and limber afterward!  In addition, the instructor is great!  She developed this workout for herself and has so many great tips- as she is a soon to be mother trying to stay in great shape too.  I wish I would have bought this video earlier. I could have worked out the muscles that would make me feel stronger as a pregnant woman, instead of pushing myself through the workouts that I thought were rigorous as a nonpregnant woman; which were only cut short because of my failing energy levels and were ultimately making my hip/back pain worse!

Update: I continued to work out with these DVDs almost exclusively throughout the rest of my pregnancy (8 weeks).  The work outs never got old or boring.  I found myself feeling more energetic because I was able to work out intensely, in a safe way.  To my pleasant surprise I noticed that I was developing more definition in my arms and I actually felt athletic despite being 9 months pregnant.  My hip pain went away and stayed away soon after starting this series.  I am a huge, huge fan and I am looking forward to working out with these DVDs when (if) I am pregnant again!",1341705600,17,2038,4.411764705882353
4961618,5,B0065WELMU,"I am giving the product 5 starts so far, even though I have only done 4 of the workouts. This is the best pre-natal work out video I have EVER seen. It is slick, good production value, not cheesy, difficult but with plenty of modifications, and fun. Sara is professional, confident, and a great teacher. The way this is set up as a whole work-out system like P90X is great for people who have been working out for a while before pregnancy (I've been an avid exerciser for 12 years). The balance between focusing on your baby, and your pregnant body, and also getting a really great workout is amazing. Seriously...check this out, it is totally worth it and you will not be disappointed.

4961619,5,B0065WELMU,"I was searching for a DVD which was moderate intensity. Most prenatal DVD's are very short, low intensity with no modification options and a little cheesy. This DVD is great. It takes out the guess work because it includes cardio, strength and stretching. It also offers modifications for low to high intensity, while still working out safe. It's so good that I could see my self doing it post natal. You will not regret buying this DVD.",1340755200,,437,4.688311688311688
4961620,5,B0065WELMU,"I ordered this DVD in my first trimester when I had absolutely no motivation to work out.  Feeling tired and nauseous was hardly a recipe for wanting to get off the couch!  Even though I felt terrible, I wanted so badly to be healthy and remain active throughout my pregnancy - of course, while being mindful that I couldn't do the workouts I used to.  ""Expecting More"" allowed me to feel energized and healthy, all while making me feel confident that I wasn't overexerting myself and putting my baby or my health in danger.  My husband even noticed a difference on days that I worked out using ""Expecting More"" - he always said I was happier and had more energy on those days than on the days I didn't use it.

In my second trimester, the stress of a move made it easy for me to put working out on the back burner.  I so regret that decision!  A few weeks ago (I'm now in my 33 week), I started up with the program again and am so happy I did.  I now recommend it to all of my pregnant friends and family!!

My advice to pregnant moms is to purchase this DVD and use it as often as you feel comfortable doing so.  Before you begin, definitely watch Sara's introduction - it was so helpful and made you feel like you had a friend going through this with you!",1340582400,,1258,4.204166666666667

The 6 different workouts really help to keep the variety and the enclosed calendar means I don't have to think about which to do.  I will admit I started with the lowest impact moves but I continue to add more ""bump-it-up"" moves. Now I feel really great and I have a lot of energy during the day.  Of course the best part of the workout is Sara. She is so personable and encouraging. It is like spending an hour a morning with a good friend.

Once morning sickness and fatigue hit, I really struggled with what types of workouts to do and how to tailor them so I wasn't to the point of exertion.

I was a little leary at the price tag of this DVD, since there are others that are cheaper. But, I bought a couple others and found them to be extremely light workouts that weren't challenging at all. This DVD is well worth it! Highly recommend! I love that there are 6 workouts and I pretty much do them in order, popping a different one in almost daily. I also like that there's a little clock in the corner of the screen telling you how long the workout is and counting down throughout it. Before I'd spend up to 2 hours at the gym with commuting there, waiting to get into class and the actual workout. Now, 30-40 minutes in my basement and I get a fantastic workout in.

4961626,5,B0065WELMU,"I'm in my second trimester of my first pregnancy and I am so happy I discovered this workout DVD when I did! I had already bought several pregnancy workout DVDs and was largely disappointed in these workouts (with the exception of Lindsay Brin's Pregnancy Fitness; I would recommend that DVD as well).  I would not necessarily consider myself an ""avid"" exerciser but I am generally fit.  Pre-pregnancy, I worked out about 3 times a week with exercise DVDs such as Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner, so I was accustomed to fast paced, high energy work outs that pushed me hard and didn't waste my time.  Despite their good reviews, several of the pregnancy workout DVDs I bought were ridiculously slow paced and easy. I'm pregnant, not disabled!

Sara Haley strikes a perfect balance for the mom-to-be who is in shape and wants to stay active throughout her pregnancy.  There are plenty of modifications so you can choose how hard to go, but Sara gives you the option of definitely pushing yourself if you want to, while making sure that you're staying safe for your baby. I genuinely have fun when I do these workouts! The videos have a lot of variety so it keeps the workout interesting and Sara is one of my favorite instructors out of my vast collection of exercise DVDs.  She's great at giving cues and motivating you without being overly aggressive or cheesy.  I also think each workout is the perfect length (about 30-40 minutes each plus warm up and cool down).

It is the only workout I've found besides The Perfect Pregnancy Workout that is well-suited to pregnant women who were active before being pregnant.

This definitely isn't the program for me and Ive gone back to P90X3 and am just modifying some of the moves now.

I feel that these workouts were extremely repetitive and I was very bored 10 minutes into each one. Another reviewer commented on the individual exercise names as they are all babycentric. Personally I found that to be annoying but that is just my take.
