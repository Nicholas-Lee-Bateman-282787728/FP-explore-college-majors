I did however enjoy the movies a lot. I would have given a higher rating if the movies were to come in more crisp. I would recommend the seller to others.",1365033600,2,295,4.103448275862069
7951185,1,B00005QW4X,"DVD quality this is not.  This is some of the worst video and worst sound I have ever experienced in a DVD.  These movies look like old 70s TV shows.  I would not be surprised if someone actually recorded these movies on their VCR off of TV, then transferred them to DVD.  All three movies are low budget, mostly bad acting, and horrible story lines.
The first movie, ""Hustling"", is about a reporter that befriends a prostitute.  She travels around with the prostitute to learn about her experiences.  The movie failed miserably to show how the life of a prostitute really is.  The second movie, ""Little Ladies of the Night"", is about a runaway girl who turns to prostitution and tries to get help from the police.  The last movie, ""Portrait of a Showgirl"", is about a Vegas Showgirl who tries to make it big.
Another big problem these movies had were that they were all ""PG rated"".  Although I don't mind PG movies, I found it very difficult for these movies to get across their point with holding back.  The movies are supposed to be about prostitution which is an adult theme.",1024790400,20,1079,4.544041450777202
