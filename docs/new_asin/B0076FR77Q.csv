I am pre-ordering now and can't wait to see it again!  Such a beautiful and poetic piece of film making and story telling.  Great acting, great writing, great directing.  You just have to see it to know how beautifully it unfolds and what a rich reward it is to see.
So excited to get to finally own it!!",1331596800,2,449,4.247058823529412
5057491,5,B0076FR77Q,"This film is a revelation...I have wondered for years what it must be like to experience memory loss and still live in a world that very much centers around what you are learning, what you have learned and what you remember. Alison Mason has managed to show nuances of this terrifying condition that make me believe there is hope, and quite a bit of beauty, in the struggle to maintain some sense of order, continuity and attachment in each single day's worth of living. Sensitive actors, realistic setting and interesting use of flashback.  Let this film find its way to your heart. You won't regret it.",1331510400,2,604,4.69811320754717
5057492,5,B0076FR77Q,This film is full of wonderful surprises.  The story is touching and it unfolds in a smart and perfectly timed presentation of the characters.

5057501,5,B0076FR77Q,"I saw this film at the Sagatuck, MI. Film Festival.  It was by far the best film I have seen at a Festival.  Alison Mason wrote a beautiful story and she did a wonderful job of directing it also.  Leigh Rose was amazing in her role and the entire story of two people's lives intersecting at a time when without knowing it each needed the other was beautifully done.  FINDING JENUA was a very moving story and brought me to tears on many levels.  This is a must see film.",1331769600,3,470,4.177777777777778

5057503,5,B0076FR77Q,"Finding Jenua is the kind of film that is so well crafted, it's depth seems to sneak up on you in a very good way.  The characters are people you feel comfortable with immediately and before you know it, you're invested in their lives and their emotions.  The subtlety and realism of the acting and direction really hit the mark for me.  I consider myself a pretty tough customer and I'm truly impressed with this piece.  You'll be glad you took the time to see it.",1331683200,2,465,4.372093023255814

5057507,5,B0076FR77Q,I saw this film about a year ago. It was very well done. Great acting and direction along with slick editing allowed this gem of a story to shine.,1331596800,3,146,4.068965517241379

Breathtakingly brave performances, an evocative, wistful score, and understated, sure-handed direction from newcomer Alison Mason make FINDING JENUA a quiet, humble masterpiece...

8510904,5,B0076FR77Q,"This is a beautiful movie that moves slowly but deliberately into the heart's territory. Loss, love, loneliness, connection, healing, nature, and redemption.

A gem.

Paul Paige's music at the end is an added bonus.",1374019200,,215,5.294117647058823
8510905,5,B0076FR77Q,"Well written and directed. The story depicts believable situations in life today that never make the daily news. They do exist and, in life, it is not what you do per se, it is how well you deal with it and the personal growth from the experience.",1348704000,,247,4.276595744680851
8510906,5,B0076FR77Q,"Allison Mason does a wonderful job of telling the story, adeptly weaving the past and present in a way that makes each character's story unfold seamlessly and glues you to the screen. I was particularly taken by Gayle James' ""Edie"" who says little ( e.g. to Cal -- ""You talk to much."") when she speaks aloud, but communicates loudly with her eyes and expressions. Leigh Rose is superb as well. It is a truly touching film of love & loss ( of both relationship and memory; survival & strength; and of character and compassion.",1345507200,,525,4.595744680851064
8510907,5,B0076FR77Q,"This film was a nice departure from the normal Hollywood fare. No explosions, no car chases, just a great presentation of an original script. Multi-dimensional characters and a helm well manned by Alison Mason make this a very rewarding view.",1343433600,,242,5.075
8510908,5,B0076FR77Q,"I have seen a lot of independent films and this has got to be the best by far! Alison Mason has a brillant talent for writing and directing! Having experienced my grandmother in various states of Alzheimer's before her death, this movie really hit home with me. It is beautifully written to really touch the core of the disease and the effects it can have on the loved ones that we care so much for. Thank you Alison for your insight, thank you to the wonderful actors and actresses and I look forward to more from this very very talented women!!! 5 Stars all the way across the board!!! Simply Amazing!!!",1341014400,,605,4.45945945945946

8510910,5,B0076FR77Q,"It's rare to find good storytelling in the movies these days. Big production leads to slick movies that often leave us longing for a better plot/dialogue. I had the privilege to see this movie at an international film festival, which it took home the top prize, and LOVED this story. I highly recommend checking this film out.",1333756800,,326,4.7368421052631575

8510912,5,B0076FR77Q,"I had the pleasure of viewing this film at the Riversedge Film Festival.  WOW! This is an incredibly moving film.  Bravo, Alison Mason for tackling a story that is often left untold. It is not often that a film puts you in such a vulnerable state that leaves you begging for more when the credits roll.  The acting and directing is absolutely superb, you won't want the film to end!",1333756800,,382,4.428571428571429
