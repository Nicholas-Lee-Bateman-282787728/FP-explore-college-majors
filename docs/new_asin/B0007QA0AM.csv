8350280,5,B0007QA0AM,"I've had this DVD since major spinal cord injury (and subsequent permanent ankle paralysis) temporarily sidelined my running pursuits. By following this workout I was able to run the Boston Marathon in under 4 hours despite only doing 1 road run in those 4 months and despite the spinal injury. Since that time I've had 3 fusion surgeries and used the Water Running workouts as a rehab path each time. I continue to substitute my road workouts with this program and feel spectacular with the results. I have foot drop for life now and must use a special brace to run, but thanks to that technology and this DVD I've been able to maximize my running success while minimizing spine and joint stress. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!",1394409600,,720,4.722222222222222
8350281,5,B0007QA0AM,"I bought this last summer.  I was looking to add to my exercise routine, and this tape was very helpful.  It shows views of the different exercises above and below the water.  I was able to put into practice the various exercises and get an awesome workout in the pool.  I over did it the first time because I didn't feel like I pushed myself that hard, but I did feel it the next day:).  It was well worth the price.",1296518400,,417,4.098765432098766
