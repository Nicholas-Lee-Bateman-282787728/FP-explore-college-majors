1851078,4,B00008MHAG,"A good watch with friends but they must have a sense of humor and should be knowledgeable of the east coast flava. I enjoyed it although it had gratuitous use of the ""N"" word (as if Oriental people would call each other that but that is part of what makes it funny). Being from the east coast myself it was nice to get back up on the flava and the slang of home. ""Boxcutta style baby, blade it up."" To all who watch it ""enjoy it son"".",1080864000,,434,4.0
1851079,4,B00008MHAG,This has to be one of the funniest shows out there. Unfortunately this DVD suffers from having only the first two episodes (23 minutes a piece?) for a retail price of 20 bucks. AND what is the deal with having commercials included in each episode just like we were watching it on TV? Extras? Not. It really comes down to how much you like the show and if your willing to be overcharged. Personally I'll do it because the show is so good. Maybe Tommy Boy should just stick to CD's and leave the DVD's to other competent companies.,1063670400,4,529,4.353535353535354
1851080,5,B00008MHAG,"Kung Faux is great mix of east/west.  It's like two great tastes that taste great together.  I used to be a big fan of the old kung fu movies, & to see what they're making by mixing them with hip hop music & talent, as well as video game & comic book stylings is awesome.
Each major fight scene has well chosen music & great comic book and video game effects & editing to make for something that's a great DVD. I also like the old Batman style ""POW!"" & ""BAM!"" graphics done in the tagger stylee.  The eletricity special effect that they add on is also a favorite.

I guess my biggest complaint is that there's only 1 DVD available....  They should start selling Season 1 DVDs & start making Season 2.
With so many cable channels syndicating the show(AZN TV in US), I'm surprised there's not a Season 2 already.
I hope this catches on overseas as it makes a great cultural export :D",1062460800,3,881,4.283132530120482
1851081,3,B00008MHAG,Kung Faux is Five Star entertainment but it's only about 3/5 of whast you get. The rest is ads. You also get cheated on time - there should be twice as many episodes for the money. Buy it used.,1059523200,2,193,3.9743589743589745
1851082,4,B00008MHAG,THIS MOVIE IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL HIP HOP AND KUNG FU FANS ALIKE.LOTS OF UNDERGROUND VOICE TALENT SURE TO MAKE YOU LAUGH!...,1052870400,,124,4.208333333333333
1851083,5,B00008MHAG,"Kung Faux Rocks! Lightening fast action, Hilarious one liners, Bugged out visuals, Slammin' music from the past & present, cameos from such artists as Biz Markie, Guru from GangStarr, Sadat-X, & Roc Raida from the X-ecutioners.
A ""karaoke"" funtion that lets me wild out my own dialogue, man this is some Mad Old School flavor with a visionary New Jack twist. I love it! Nuff said.",1048896000,2,380,4.7727272727272725
1851084,5,B00008MHAG,"John Newlin, Editor-in-Chief of the coolest entertainment news magazine in San Francisco called the ""Kung Faux"" DVD series,"" the best thing ever!"", and I would have to agree. This DVD is like nothing I have ever seen and I can't begin to explain it, it's totally unique! I cant wait for the next one in the series. ""It rhymes with Gung-Ho, so act like you know!""",1048291200,,362,4.5
7985360,5,B00008MHAG,"IT RHYMES WITH GUNG HO! SO ACT LIKE YA KNO! The SECOND I bought Kung Faux I knew had to buy some mo! So I bought volumes 1 through 5 to keep this series alive! If you love old Spike shows like MXC or other old school Kung Fu flicks then you'll find this series hilarious. The editing and voice acting is all originally done by members of various east coast rap groups as well as Queen Latifah herself! I'd recommend this series to anyone with a sense of humor and an attention span longer then 5 seconds.

7985362,4,B00008MHAG,"This is one of the greatest TV shows I have ever seen. Totally funky fresh to the limit, worth the purchase. However, these DVDs do include commercials. You literally have to fast forward through ads on your own DVD. Other than that, an awesome show. Proud to have it on my shelf.",1143244800,,280,4.403846153846154
7985363,5,B00008MHAG,"Please release more Kung Faux dvds!

I have been waiting so long for ""Volume 2"" to come out that I made the mistake of buying another dvd that someone said might quench my thirst for ""Kung Faux"".

Amazon recommended something called ""Volcano High"" that was a complete piece of trash and a total rip off & let down.

And, it made me realize even how much more I love ""Kung Faux"" and will likely never be able to replace it with something else.

So, please, please, please! Release more episodes on dvd before i  have an anxiety attack!-I am not kidding.

You guys have created a monster!- Now Feed Me!

7985364,4,B00008MHAG,"I first saw Kung Faux about a year ago, perhaps longer.  I just NOW got the DVD for it...I will tell anyone who hasn't seen it yet that it's absolutely rediculous, but just as entertaining.  If you have a good sense of humor and can laugh at the word ""Nikka,"" when it's used that the end of a sentence, then go buy this movie.  I just wish volume 2-6 were released, i can seem to find them anywhere

The only draw backs is the commercials that appear while you are watching the episodes.  Other than that it's all worth it...",1122163200,,525,4.21
7985365,5,B00008MHAG,"The Miami Herald says Kung Faux is ""possibly the greatest tv show ever!"" and I couldn't agree more.

My TIVO is full of the censored epiosdes from the FUSE and AZN tv channels and I love that I can now get them uncensored on dvd then put them on my new PSP.

I also love all of the little surprises that they drop in between the episodes on dvd like the hip hop music video from Sweden and hot girls from GAME. They are like the surprises you get in a box of Cracker Jacks or something.

I have already signed up to the email list at [...]for the rest of the dvds in the series. I wish more TV was like this.",1121731200,,608,3.926829268292683
7985366,5,B00008MHAG,"For some people, hip hop slang sounds like a foreign language,...like when they here someone say ""he done messed up my doobie dun"" or "" i gots to get my shape up yo""...all they hear is are a bunch of words that make no sense to them,... and for others kung fu films are only good to them if they are seeing exactly what they have seen a thousand times before with a overly carbon copied soundtrack and 80 minutes of filler spread out between a few minutes of fight scenes here and there.

If this sounds like you then don't get this dvd, just order yourself another scoop of vanilla ice cream from somewhere else.

But if you love comic book style video game graphic effects, the wordplay of Rap lyrics, the subversive intelligent humor found in the brains of hip hop music artists from around the world & can understand what they are saying or at least mean, as well as wall to wall fight scenes but not the boring parts of old kung fu movies, then this is the dvd for you.

This is the realist, funniest thing that I have seen in a long long time, and the music is incredible...the fight scenes alone scored to thumping tracks from De La Soul, Naughty By Nature, & Queen Latifah or worth the price...They have a ""karaoke"" game function on the dvd that allows you to mute the dialogue but keep the music and I find myself playing this all of the time as booming background music while I am working it is that good.

It should be noted that this is not an entire season of episodes on one dvd,...it is actually two ""uncensored"" episodes from the first season plus a bunch of short movies, promo trailers, and music videos that are also pretty interesting, which make it run around 90 minutes long very much like an ""Anime"" DVD.

I have to say that I think ""Anime"" is more like what this ""Kung Faux"" dvd should be compared to, not a classic kung fu movie or some throw away hip hop gimmick.

It requires a certain amount of willingness for the viewer to give into this new environment infused with fast paced color and music and expanded vocabulary, and I don't know about you, but I enjoyed the challenge and experience of learning and discovering something new while being entertained, and I was almost glad that there wasn't a whole bunch of episodes on one disc, because with so much to take in on this dvd, I think I might have gotten a brain overload if I watched too many of them in a row.

I pity the clueless & close minded of you who chose to (...) rather than enjoy this dvd because like most things in your life...it is all probably just too far over your head to comprehend and requires more knowledge of pop culture and brain power than you can muster, so you will never have the opportunity to laugh and enjoy this dvd like I have, but like they say...""ignorance is bliss"", and the world needs dumbos like you to keep the crap flowing, because god forbid a mass majority demand intelligent humor , because that would kill off the vast majority of brain dead nuggets being pooped out by the majority of entertainment companies in the world today and sink it for everyone...so you keep hating kids, while others like me find salvation in our little boxes of goodness like ""Kung Faux"".",1120694400,5,3196,4.397631133671743
7985367,5,B00008MHAG,"i caught an episode of ""kung faux"" on tv last night after blending up a smoothie and when the shake came out of my nose from laughing so hard, i knew i had to by this dvd. the tv show had bleeps over the curse words which was funny, but i can't wait to hear it all uncensored on the dvd...theez nuckas iz crazy!",1112572800,2,311,3.875
7985368,5,B00008MHAG,"This is the third copy of ""Kung Faux"" that I have had to buy because of my so called friends who borrowed it and never gave it back.
