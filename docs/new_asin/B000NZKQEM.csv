8182473,3,B000NZKQEM,"Good overview of the tactical shotgun but tries to cover too much territory in such a short video. The first few minutes are a discussion of the Gunsite preferred shotgun configuration; stock, sling and sights.  Other topics include: loading/unloading, mounting, carrying, patterning, types of ammunition, tactical considerations and dry fire practice.

Jack Furr and Bill Jeans are the primary instructors.  There are 34 minutes of instruction followed by a short dry fire practice session and closing comments for a total of 47 minutes.",1216425600,,538,5.457831325301205
