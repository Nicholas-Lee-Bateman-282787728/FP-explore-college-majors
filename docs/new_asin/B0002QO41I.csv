8030705,5,B0002QO41I,Not much needs to be said about a Bette Davis film.  She is the epitomy of what an actress should be - perfection!  She gives her all in every performance.  I never tire of watching any of her movies over and over again.  I own almost all of her movies - over 100 of them.  There will never be another one like her.  To say I admire the talent of this outstanding woman would be a severe understatement.,1217548800,,403,4.102564102564102
