8552825,5,B0016QCBLS,"I saw this movie a the HIFF and it was a favorite.  This moving story portrayed the relationship between a mother and her son over the span of many years.  Well written and directed, viewers will relate to the storyline as we are all not perfect beings as a mother, a father, or as a son.  It is a beautiful story of relationships, of a mother's absolute unconditional love for her son, an unappreciative son who comes of age, an absent father who is abusive and an alcoholic, of redemption, all told against the background of Tokyo and Japan's countryside.  It is an emotional masterpiece of a family's journey!  I can easily place this movie in my top ten favorites of all time.",1322352000,,680,4.495934959349594
