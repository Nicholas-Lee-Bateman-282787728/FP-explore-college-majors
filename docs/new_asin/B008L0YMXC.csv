5169034,4,B008L0YMXC,"Devil in the Flesh-Debbie Strand is the new girl in class. At the moment she arrives, Debbie sets her sights on her teacher, Peter, the high school heartthrob. However, her seductive advances don't win Peter until she threatens him with blackmail. What Debbie wants, Debbie gets, no matter what's standing in her way. As a checkered past of unsolved murders catches up with her, Debbie's games threaten to turn deadly again.
My review:Pretty good film. Kinda reminds me of the Poison Ivy films, honestly. Having been a fan of Rose McGowan from her Charmed days, this one was a real treat for me. Loved it!

Devil in the Flesh 2-After escaping from a mental institution, Debbie Strong steals the car, money and identity of a college co-ed & heads off to college where she becomes obsessed with Sam, a handsome writing teacher. When her roommate discovers Debbie's true identity and horrifying past, her wicked web of deception is threatened, sending murder and seduction to higher and more terrifying levels than ever before.
My review: I used to think it was true what they say about sequels(that they're not as good as the original) but, thankfully, Devil in the Flesh 2 was just as the original..if not better. My only gripe was that the plot was alot like the original. The only difference being that this story takes place at a college. Really enjoyed this one.

Diary of a Serial Killer-A reporter witnesses a serial killer doing what he does best. When the serial killer finds out that he was witnessed doing his nasty work, he confronts him. When he does, he finds out that the man is a reporter. For the reporter to get the serial killer to spare his life, he offers to do a story on him. When the serial killer agrees, Things start to turn horribly wrong for the reporter.
My review:Quite possibly the weakest film in the whole collection. Even so, though, Diary of a Serial Killer is still a good watch.

Evil Behind You- Lisa Williams and Debra Reynolds are both enjoying evenings out when something goes terribly wrong. Neither girl can recall what has happened as they awake locked in a dark observation room. Debra's husband, Tony, and Lisa's boyfriend David are both handcuffed to operating tables and there is no explanation. No one will respond to their calls for help and there is no way out of the room. The abducted couples are unwilling victims of a scientific experiment.
My review:Decent film despite the fact it took a little while to get rollin' for me. Enjoyed it.

The Fear:Halloween Night- Morty, the menacing creature who scared audiences worldwide in ""The Fear"", is back for more! Mike brings his friends together for a Halloween party where everyone will dress up as their innermost fears. Everything gets rolling when Morty comes to life and gives Mike and his friends a Halloween rendezvous they'll never forget!
My review:The sequel to one of my favorite horror films of all-time is, actually, a good followup. However, even though it's a good followup, it doesn't pack quite the punch the original had I'm afraid. While Morty is still a downright creepy horror baddie, he doesn't get the screen time he deserves to be the best that he can be...and, in my opinion,that's what truly brings the film down. Other than that, I loved The Fear: Halloween Night!! Definitely one of my top favorites out of this collection.

Ice Cream Man-After witnessing the murder of his friend The Ice Cream King, Gregory Tudor grows up to become a demented ice cream man with mysterious frozen treats. No one is safe from the ice cream man in this pulse-pounding nightmare that's sure to leave you chilled to the bone.
My review:Clint Howard really makes this role his own, honestly, and that's what makes this film so special. It's a great film, I enjoyed it. I'm surprised, though, that we hadn't seen a sequel.

Jack Frost 2- Jack, the chiller killer is back and he's mad as hell. An accidental lab experiment resurrected the evil snowman, but this time, the crystal killer can't be stopped by fire, bullets or even his worst enemy, chemical anti-freeze. With revenge on his mind, Jack sets out to finish off his nemesis, Sheriff Sam, who is vacationing on a Caribbean island. Sam's balmy paradise turns into a Winter Terrorland when Jack freezes the island and quickly ices everyone around him. No one can stop the chilling killing spree when Jack can travel as lethal liquid or fatal, frosty flakes. Just when you thawed it was safe to go back in the fridge...
My review: Fun followup to the original film. Loved it despite it being downright campy!

The Killing Grounds- After the fatal crash of a small airplane in the high Sierras, six greedy strangers clash over a fortune in stolen gold. When four hikers stumble on the treasure and begin hauling it away, two drug dealing thugs come to claim the loot, regardless of who gets hurt. The torturous trip down the mountainside becomes a frightening ordeal as each has his own plans for the gold. No one hears their bloodcurdling cries as they cross the killing grounds at the bottom of the mountain.
My review:To me, the highlight of this film is seeing two Children of the Corn Alumni acting together in the film. Of course, the film itself is good despite the acting is a little over-the-top. Enjoyed this one as well.
Naina- On the day of solar eclipse, 5-year-old Naina loses her parents and her eyesight in a freak car accident. 20 years later, she undergoes a cornea transplant and regains her sight - only to experience a darkness far graver than any she has ever known.
My review:For a foreign film, Naina had alot of thrill and chills. I really enjoyed it very much. Reminded me alot of American film, The Eye.

Night Feeders- In the remote Southern wilderness a fiery meteor crashes to Earth and forever changes Mankind's view of the Universe. For this meteor unleashes an infestation of nocturnal alien creatures with just one intention: To devour every warm-blooded life form on our planet. When night falls four hapless deer hunters in search of some weekend fun and sport are about to discover how it feels to be the prey!
My review:Underrated redneck fun is all I can say about this sci-fi horror film. One that shouldn't be missed...

The Other Side-On the night Sam North plans to reunite with the girl he loves, he's mysteriously murdered and sent to the horrific realm of the damned. With the help of two other denizens of The Pit he somehow escapes back into the world of the living. But now there's Hell to pay. Three invincible bounty hunters called Reapers are determined to drag him back to the Netherworld where he'll writhe in torment... forever!
My review:This thriller is impressive...especially to have been made on a budget of $15,000 and being shot in Atlanta, GA. What I liked most about it was that it gave you a new twist on an old(often overly used) subject for horror films.

Within the Rock-The countdown to the end of the world has begun. As a runaway moon hurtles through space on a collision course with Earth, only a small team of interplanetary miners stands in its way. Their mission to alter the moon's course is halted when a fossilized alien is unleashed from its subterranean hibernation. The indestructible creature now stands between them and their determination to save humankind from certain extinction.
My review:Not too shabby. Reminded me of a cross between Armageddon and Alien.

Overall review: For the asking price, Fright Fest is a great buy. Not a dull film in the bunch. While I would have preferred the original Fear film and its' sequel over Devil in the Flesh and its' followup, I'm still satisfied. Definitely a good collection to watch when you're in the spookin' mood!!",1379894400,20,7705,4.764044943820225
5169035,4,B008L0YMXC,"A mixed bag, as all these collections are.  But I found the creature feature Night Feeders quite entertaining with a good ending.  Within the Rock is a predictable astronauts-release-killer-monster story.  Some I have no plans to watch, but others I will and so far, they've been fine...a cut above the ScyFy-funded cheapies.  Worth getting.",1378771200,2,341,5.2592592592592595

5169037,2,B008L0YMXC,"These are loooooooow budget cheesy horror flicks released between the late 90s through the mid 2000s. Sadly, these are mostly not ""so bad it's good"" entertaining horror. These are generally ""so bad, they put me to sleep"" horror flicks. They have some notable 80s-2000s b-movie actors like Gary Busey, Rose McGowan, and Anthony Michael Hall. But, unfortunately, these stars couldn't end up saving these boring movies.

The characters in all these movie are cardboard and mostly unlikable. In most movies, the horror, killing, and suspense don't start til halfway through. Too much time is spent on these pointless subplots. The acting was really terrible. So many people seemed as if they were reading from a cue card or as if they had just read the script the day before filming began. I could have liked these movies but most of them had an irritatingly slow pace. Thank God, I watched these movies on DVD so I could fast forward through some of the nonsense. I wouldn't have the patience to withstand this stuff in theaters.

However, I won't completely write this entire horror collection off. Some movies had redeeming values. I've checked reviews on imdb.com for these movies and some have their share of fans such as the Rose McGowan flick ""Devil in the Flesh"". I personally like ""the Fear"" and ""Within the Rock"". These two flicks fall into the so bad it's good category due to their nonsensical cheesiness. The only problem is they took a long time to pick up.

To sum up: these movies are mainly quite boring. There might be a few okay gems in this collection. I'd recommend this to diehard horror fans. However, I'd only recommend buying these flicks for $5 or less. Even with 12 movies, more than $5 if too much to spend for these flicks.",1356393600,12,1748,4.743421052631579
