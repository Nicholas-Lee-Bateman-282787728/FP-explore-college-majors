980160,4,6305196141,"This was a wonderful medium to share the life of Martin Luther King, Jr. with my children.  It encouraged thoughtful discussion about the ignorance and danger of racism.  It was also a tremendous demonstration of how 'one'  person CAN make a difference.  I am going to order a copy to go in my  children's school library. God Bless Martin Luther King, Jr. and may his  dream continue.",950313600,6,384,4.656716417910448

I must admit with such a wide age span it's not always easy  to keep everyone's attention.

980329,5,6305196141,"I'd like to start by saying that this movie is a gem.  It's interesting enough to hold kids' attention, and the dialogue is clearly spoken and well-paced.  It's shameful that we can't find it in affordable DVD format, but that's another issue...

Having said that, I don't think this movie should be shown in any school where people of color are not the majority.  I sat next to my 7-yr.-old and watched this with lots of pauses and explanations.  Several times I checked with her to make sure she wasn't afraid, remembering how I felt watching documentaries re the Civil Rights Movement and the KKK as a child.  The last thing I would want is for a well-meaning teacher to show this to her in a setting where she's a minority (I'm AA, my husband is Caucasian), and have a class discussion that makes my precious girl feel self-conscious about her skin color, and isolated. I have my child's emotional best interest in mind in a way that too many socially conscious people don't.  It's not enough to just educate about Civil Rights.  We have to have empathy for the tender hearts of children who are learning for the first time not only about segregation, but about how they, themselves would have been hated and discriminated against.  My suggestion is to watch this movie with your children, and discuss it, thus inoculating them against the time they'll have to review the information in a more public setting.",1390176000,,1413,4.6882591093117405
980509,5,6305196141,"We bought this for our 4th grade nephew.  Although it's clearly from the 90's, he enjoyed the film.  I like the combination of animation and actual historical footage.

And, the seller is excellent.  We ordered this vhs tape on a Monday. It arrived 2 days later. Seller also included another kids DVD and a $5 starbucks gift card free of charge! Wonderful!",1389916800,,356,4.693548387096774
980510,5,6305196141,"As a newly retired school library/media specialist, I used this video as the centerpiece for a 6 week literature/research/technology unit (Jan-Feb) celebrating MLK Day and leading into Black History Month, taught to every grade level, once per week... every other year...  in which we discussed the life of Dr King, the family values of compassion and hard work, etc. and the history and value of the civil rights movement as a process begun long ago and continuing today... The time-travel episodes made clear break-points, creating openings for discussion... and most segments are suitable for all ages... the more intense scenes are handled with accuracy and restraint... but younger children should not be exposed to those segments... so it is up to the teacher and school admin to make the proper curriculum decisions about what to teach and what resources to use... that said, the exceptional cast and attention to historic detail makes this one of the best curriculum tools available... enjoyed and loved by the kids... especially the older kids of various minorities, who saw our history come alive and be connected with our present reality...  I received much praise from kids and parents and never one complaint... (...why show it every-other year?  As the kids mature, they have greater insight... and are amazed at what new insights they have that they missed when they were younger...)",1389916800,,1398,5.149779735682819

980512,5,6305196141,This is another movie that teachers should show.  You can write a lesson plan to help students understand the movie.

980517,1,6305196141,"Why anyone in an educational setting would choose to show this video is beyond me.
While it condemns stereotyping of blacks, it is rife with stereotypes of Southern whites.  Come on teachers - preview what you intend to show and then suck it up if it isn't worth showing and you don't have an easy planning period.  You can always read them a good book instead.",1326153600,3,361,4.454545454545454

980689,4,6305196141,This is a cartoon version of Martin Luther King Jr. specifically for elementary age children.  It is interspursed with real footage of his life and the important events that happened in the Civil Rights movement.  The children in the video take trips into the past and future to learn the impact of Martin's work.  It is fast-moving and child-centered.  My students and grandchildren loved it and want to view it again and again.,1316217600,,429,4.835616438356165
980690,2,6305196141,"My school uses this as part of the curriculum for the first graders.  I am referencing 6 year olds in my review here.  I am at a loss as to why my children, at the age of 6, need to learn about bigotry and hate and riots and firebombing.  To a child, they all come out of viewing the video noticing one another's skin color.  For the first time, by and large.  My children are mixed race, and they have come home terrified that their father will be assassinated and wondering why their white mommy hates their black daddy.  All they remember is that MLK Jr get's his head blown off by a white man.

Teach my children how to spell, play dodgeball and basic math skills.  Leave it to me to determine when they are old enough to learn that there are people who will judge them based upon the most superficial things, and that prior to 40 years ago, it was legal to do so.  They have a lifetime to learn about hatred and such a short time to enjoy being a child.  Head shaking.",1316217600,16,973,4.1550802139037435

980692,1,6305196141,My school district professional library had this in VHS form.  The classrooms are moving toward Smart Boards and I didn't have the equipment to play it.  We had to move to the library where they had a duel machine.  My first graders LOVED this movie. We also happened to be studying Fantasy and Fact that week.  I would recommend this movie to anyone teaching about the Civil Rights Movement and Dr. King for K-12.,1301788800,3,414,4.554054054054054

If my son had not made a special birthday request for this video, which he had viewed in school, I would have never paid $79.00. Half this price would be more more reasonable. My only consolation is that the historical content of the movie makes it a keepsake item.",1267401600,2,473,4.511627906976744

980698,5,6305196141,This DVD tells about the life of Dr. Martin Luther King in a way that spans several age groups.  I purchased the video cassette about 9 years ago for my daughter's K4 class.  I have since purchased additional copies and donated to teachers and libraries in my community.  The material even appeals to the upper elementary grade students.

It is a great mix of animation and actual footage.  My friend teaches in the primary grades and we both felt additional instruction and explanation might be necessary for that audience.  I teach upper elementary and the DVD will support a basal reader selection quite nicely and without additional instruction.  Highly recommend.",1217635200,,468,4.961538461538462

Did you really see this?"" etc. It is interesting to see that where as I lived a lot of this, these students only heard about it. The fact that it was low key and annimated let these students feel comfortable with their discussions. Unfortunately, they don't have an complete understanding of how much Mr. King did for us.

980824,2,6305196141,"I have just withstood this movie, with a group of confused and bored, 1st graders, in the school I substitute teach in. Our lesson plans this week have included a broad range of activities and simplistic essays on getting along with others, diversity, tolerance and doing our part to make the world a better place, in honor of the work of Dr. Martin Luther King. The grand finale was the gathering of all of the classes to watch this educational video.

ANIMATION QUALITY: Poor. Think Josie and the Pussycats or Scooby Doo.

LANGUAGE: Degrading, tense scenes of whites calling children ""colored"" or ""negroes"".  Children using inappropriate slang, ""butthead"",""stupid idiot"", ""dumb"" and other words we are instructed to tell our students are ""bad words"".

VIOLENCE: Think of the classic black and white imagery during the horrible struggle of the 60's: cross burning, KKK, vicious police dogs attacking young men, fire hoses blasting protesters, police clubbing men and women, Dr. King's house burned by arsonists. Also in the movie: a morbidly obese white child physically assaulting an african american child, a school bus driver intentionally trying to run down a child, physical threats of violence between characters.

CHARACTERIZATION: I do not recall any white characters with redeeming values. The main character who is african american has a white best friend, who has an exagerated Forest Gump-type accent and I.Q. All others are bigots, with the exception of the aforementioned, incompetent school bus driver. The main antagonist, the obese, white, bully, wears a heavy-giggle evoking midriff cut tee shirt, that exposes his bosom and pants that expose his derriere. His offensive behavior was enough, without these visuals.

CONTINUITY: The storyline involved time travel, a clever device when done well. With all of the big names in the credits, they would have done well to be consulted by Spielberg. There is one critical jump that utterly confused most of the children; especially when the characters who transported changed their personality, in Jekyl and Hyde style.

I wish this had been a better movie, though I believe it might have some merit with an older, more prepared group, perhaps 5th or 6th graders. It's unfortunate that a better storyline could not have been worked out, considering all of the star power that was cast as voice talent. The end of the movie shows sweet images of diverse groups hugging and playing; this would have been much more appropriate for the young group I was in charge of today. My heart sunk, when a diminutive,young girl came up to me when we were getting ready to go home, and asked me,""Why are white people so mean?""",1200614400,9,2674,5.0636363636363635
980825,5,6305196141,My kindergardener watched this in class and loved it. He begged the teacher to play it on multiple days. I purchased this for him and he watched it twice in one night. A great way to help children learn! What a great all-star cast!,1173312000,,231,4.2727272727272725

I, in highschool, am ordering this movie to show my little sister who hasn't seen it and hasn't appreciated MLK. It's a must for people OF ALL AGES to see the world through MLK's eyes and what it would be without him. It allows people to connect with MLK and to see what he really strove for.

980902,5,6305196141,"I bought this movie for an after school program of 4-6 graders, based on high recomendations from several people.  The film starts out quite cheesy and the kids were a little dubious, especially the older ones, but within a very short time they were entranced.  I chose to show it in two half hours over two days due to our schedule.  I turned off the first half to much protest.  By the end, it was all I could do not to cry watching some of the live footage scenes mixed with animation, and all the children were i tears with me.

  I belive, and it has been very well proven with our kids, that they need to know about what went on in our history.  Some feel it is too disturbing, but adults now were once children that age and actually experienced the atrocities of segregation.

  I highly recomend this movie as part of a large discussion for this age group, discussions that include not only Martin Luther King Jr. but Rosa Parks, Malcolm X and other leaders of civil rights movement.  You will be amazed at some of the enlightened comments that they will make.  I was extremely moved by how far we as a society have come.  We still have a long way to go but, we are so much more advanced and the next generation behind us is, to my relief, one of tremendous compassion.",1140652800,6,1277,4.310924369747899

My son also did his report on Martin Luther King and used the video for a source. His teacher plans to show the video to his class for Black History Month.,1140652800,,409,3.788235294117647

981024,2,6305196141,"Although this movie had a couple deep and emotional moments, the hokey nature of the rest of it bled all over that.  The characters were horrible: the kids came off as somewhat mentally handicapped, with the exception of maybe the Mexican girl, whom on a side-note looks as if she's 21, not a sixth grader.  The obese kid and the blond skateboarder had no redeeming qualities to them whatsoever on the account of their ignorance and sheer stupidity.  Because of this, the most disturbing points in the movie didn't deal with the mistreating of the African Americans, it was more as a result of the skateboarder's slow, sluggish manner of speaking and the obese kid's being topless at the March In Washington. And the running gag with the bad bus driver: first off it was inconsistent; second off: it's scary to show kids that a school district would allow a bus driver who can't stay on the road keep his job driving children to school. The celebrity voices only left me playing a game of 'yeah, that voice sounds familiar,' which I guess was a good distraction from the before-mentioned disturbing aspects of the film. In a closing synopsis:  'Our Friend Martin' does somewhat achieve it's goal of delivering the historic aspects of the story, but it falls short on the account of poor writing decisions and being dumbed down for children; and believe me, their minds need to be as sharpened as they could be nowadays.",1112313600,13,1419,4.732793522267206

981026,5,6305196141,"I watched this on DVD with my 4 yr old son.  He was VERY interested and really liked the movie.  He understood immediately that the show was NOT saying that all White people are bad, that in fact skin color is a very silly thing to judge people by.
It was refreshing to see a show on the Civil Rights movement that did not show The Selfless and Heroic White Man coming in to save and protect the apathetic and helpless minorities, but instead portrayed the courage and determination of the people who had engaged in the struggle for freedom for years... centuries.
It gave was a good portrayal of the attitudes and realities that made the Civil Rights struggle so difficult, desperate, and dangerous.",1076025600,8,700,4.592

My students always have questions and I find that if I stop the film and discuss what we have just seen, they can understand the concepts presented.

They had so many questions after showing it and they could not believe that people were once treated like that in our country. One of them when prompted by a journal starter that asked them if they could go backwards in time, what time would they want to go to said she would like to go back to that time to tell Dr. King to be carefull before his assasination. I hightly recommend it even for high school students.",1011830400,9,485,4.225806451612903

7884656,5,6305196141,This was one of the most important movies that I ever watched as a child. It showed me the inequality that existed in the past and allowed me to see the difference one man could make. It also holds the attention of a child very well. It is extremely informative and doesn't leave too much out; the content could be handled well by someone in the 3rd grade or up. I will one day show this movie to my kids as it was so important to me growing up.,1436486400,,445,4.01123595505618
