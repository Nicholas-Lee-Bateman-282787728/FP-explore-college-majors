8414801,3,B000CPKE36,"I saw this DVD with a group of people and my review is a summary of what everyone thought including myself (of course).

The Documentary has 4 characters. The teacher, the friend, the ""perverted wizard"" and the Origami monster.  (The monster was a 3 yr old girl, who behaved well for a three year old. It's just that she was far too young for this DVD. The reason I call her ""Origami monster"" will be evident soon and is purely for dramatic effect)

The DVD starts with the teacher Kayo, teaching how to make a crane, while the 3 year old Origami monster keeps disturbing her. Her greatest joy is to try to unfold, destroy and open/rip any Origami model she can lay her hands on. The teacher is completely out of control and even answers the cell phone in the middle of teaching, completely on camera. Not to mention, speaking in Japanese during the teaching and phone call. Her friend, Mayumi, visits her and demonstrates how to make a not so basic Sonobe type module and eventually makes the 12 piece pointed ball star. What beginners DVD begins with cranes and Sonobe modulars modules?? To add insult to injury, the ""perverted wizard,"" Sam makes a brief appearance where he sits next to friend and kisses her and is all very touchy and obvious in his affection for his teacher wife's friend. We all had flashes of some reality TV while watching this.

Part two of the DVD is a more formal teaching of origami. I use the word teaching quiet liberally in this review. The formal teaching is also short lived as after teaching 4 models ; crane, waterbomb, purse and pigeon, the three year old monster resurrects and starts her demolition.

To top it all, the teacher even does some cloth/scarf folding and actually makes a bra.

This DVD can be summed up in the teachers own words (pronounced with her accent),  ""This is origami 'sheet'"".

If you want to teach origami and give more than this, this video is great !

8414803,1,B000CPKE36,"The whole program is a fiasco from the begining. From answering the phone during teaching, speaking japanese to friend to even some lewdness on the cameraman/producer/director's part. THe whole thing is a big NO for anybody especially for children. This is C grade cheap film with poor choice of models, bad teaching style and awful camerawork. This can be aptly called ""Origami by dummies.""",1153008000,6,391,5.125
8414804,1,B000CPKE36,"There is a director who's named Sam,

He has no skills at all with a cam.

  To list all that's done wrong,

  It would take much too long,

Suffice it to say it's a sham.

Save your money. Save your time. Consider root canal or childbirth as less painful alternatives.",1152489600,6,269,4.22
