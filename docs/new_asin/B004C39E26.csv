4324508,1,B004C39E26,"Oct. 1st, 2014  11:23am  I am not yelling when you come upon Capital Letters, as so people mistake it to be, But for me I capitalize ANYTHING WITH GOD'S NAME, LAWS AND HOLINESS and TRUTHS!!!!  I can not recommend this movie to anyone and I am sure many would disagree with me, but  THE ALMIGHTY GODHEAD TOLD Noah How To Build The Ark, see Genesis 6:14 -8:22!!!!!  It makes me so sad when people want to make a film about Stories in GOD'S HOLY WORD, but  they do not want to stay with in the CONTEXT OF THE BIBLE, but add to IT Want IT Does Not Say!!!! GOD IS A HOLY LOVING GOD, and NOT A GOD Of Confusion and lies!!!! I would not buy, nor recommend this movie to anyone, Accept Those who had their BIBLES Open To Read before or after they watched it to see The TRUE Context of what is being shown or said!!!! So many BIBLICAL movies that are made are not always strictly To THE  WORD OF THE BIBLE!!!! And if a person does not read Their BIBLES PRAYERFULLY would think they are learning TRUTHS Strictly From THE BIBLE!  So if I said this movie was good, in my heart I would be a liar!!!! I wanted to stop it all together, and I wasted money paying for it!!!! Many people watch BIBLICAL Movies to enjoy watching THE BIBLE Live Action!!!

4324510,2,B004C39E26,It was boring and hard to follow and not scriptural. Example: Noahs grandkids were on the ark also........I would not buy it again!!!,1397520000,5,133,4.826086956521739
4324511,1,B004C39E26,"Unlike most of the other ""Bible Stories"" DVDs, this one doesn't follow the Biblical account of story lines at all.",1378857600,5,114,4.75
4324512,1,B004C39E26,the book was in a story form.  I wanted the real thing.  I ended up just throw it away.  Still looking for a real Genisis,1377216000,5,121,3.76

4324514,2,B004C39E26,"I'm a Sunday School teacher and was looking for something to supplement a lesson on Noah's Ark.  This looked interesting, so I bought it without review.  The cinematography is nice, yet if you're looking for a good re-enactment of the three Genesis stories you should look elsewhere.  I gave it two stars as it does stay close to Scripture.

The story is narrated with brief and ""low budget"" portrayals of the three stories.  Much of the film shows a nomad (Beduoin?) family seemingly from the time the stories were actually written.  Seeing people sitting in tents or around a campfire while an old man narrated was not compelling.  Wife was snoozing after ten minutes, while husband had to fight gamely to make it to the end, though there's a good probability some portions were missed.",1299888000,17,788,4.792592592592593

8422702,4,B004C39E26,"I bought the revamped TNT Bible Collection, which included this film. I was expecting a visual story of the first chapters of the Book of Genesis. Much to my surprise, the film is a series of landscapes, animals, people, and occasionally, an actor speaking.

Most of the speaking parts are one actor narrating the book of Genesis, with a few exceptions. Notably, the writer included quotes from other parts of the Bible, such as the Song of Solomon, Psalms, and possibly Ecclesiastes. These excerpts weave into the Genesis narrative in a way that helps the viewer understand the futility of wealth and power, and God's frustration with a corrupt humanity that oppresses the poor, before the Flood. Some of the dialogue is not from the Bible, but is used to introduce the main character (an elderly man's young relative asks a question, and the main character introduces the story from there). It does not impede the story and is not heretical.

Overall, it was a pleasant surprise, as most Bible films are told as a visual story. The film feels like a piece of art - the Creation story through the Flood narrated over nice cinematography.",1510185600,,1138,4.801020408163265
8422703,3,B004C39E26,its ok,1509408000,,6,2.5
8422704,1,B004C39E26,"I have many Bible movies which I thoroughly enjoy, but this one is terrible. A man tells a story. None of the ""characters"" in the movie speak. Between the man's few sentences here and there, there are LONG periods of nothing happening. For example, there are 5 minutes of close ups of rain drops, frogs, leaves, etc., with very strange music playing.  There are long periods of random people's faces (and this occurs before God creates Adam, there are people just standing looking around, they are clothed and are wearing jewelry.  ???).  There are at least 5 minutes of a line of people riding camels and there's never an explanation of who they are.  During the part about Noah, the movie drags on and on with nothing but close ups of people's faces and the sound of rain in the background. No animals (except a baby chick, a horse and a dove), no dialog, just long long long periods of looking at people's faces (this seriously goes on for close to a half an hour). This is not a movie portraying the Book of Genesis, which is what I thought I was buying. It is incredibly boring because of the LONG periods of nothing, with strange music and long scenes of people's faces or close ups of animals or plants, in between the man's telling of the story.  It is a complete waste of money, and a huge disappointment. I suffered through the entire thing only because I wanted to be completely informed of its quality (or lack thereof) before I wrote a review.",1502928000,2,1456,4.5

8422707,4,B004C39E26,"I thought the movie to be good. I didn't mind the fact that it was a narrated movie. However it was confusing in some places when the story of Adam was being told and the 'people' were in tents etc. The facts of the Ark were not consistent with Scripture. Scripture states that there were 8 people that entered the ark. Noah, his wife, his 3 sons and their wives. In the movie portion it showed about 4 children that I could count. I did not realize that I ordered from the 'Bible Stories' series. I always find them inconsistent with Scripture. But I will give it a 4 star rating.",1491004800,2,581,4.243243243243243
