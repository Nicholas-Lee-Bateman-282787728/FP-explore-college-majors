1410257,3,B00005A07A,"These performances all come from '80s basic cable, so there's no really blue material here. There are some funny sets on this disk (Brad Garrett, Drew Carey and Ellen DeGeneres are standouts, as you might expect), along with a few clunkers (a young Adam Sandler's terrible and Unknown Comic Murray Langston's bit is shockingly terrible once he takes the bag off). Bob Zany is nowhere to be found even though he's supposed to be on disc 4, bay-bee. Bruce Baum is introduced as Bruce ""Bannin"". Kelsey Grammer is no stand-up comic, and it shows. Jerry Seinfeld's bit is literally a minute long. The extras are beyond worthless. I checked this out from the library and recommend you do the same, or rent: your enjoyment of the good stuff will be tempered by your overall buyer's remorse.",1183507200,,783,4.764705882352941

1410270,3,B00005A07A,"I bought this set of comfy movies from walmart, I love dumb sports comedies like the Benchwarmers, and Dana Carvey's ""Master of disguise"" also brings back fond memories of the year it came out and the bizarre product tie-ins.  I spent a lot of time at Taco Bell and I think they were involved somehow.
 Joe Dirt is the rare David Spade role where he's not a smarmy woman chaser and is pretty sweet and positive. I can kill a boring day programming my own basic cable day with these fun staples.",1452124800,,494,4.358695652173913

7934804,4,B00005A07A,"Very solid collection for stand-up fans due to not having over-done transitions, being well remastered quality and being reasonable picks. Some of the comedians will be obscure for those who weren't in the 80s/90s and the set is rated PG since it was network talkshow level so aside from mildly risqu or over-the-top material described, there is plenty of cleverly thought out stuff and not anything foul-mouthed that you'll have to shoe out a kid for, this is reasonable for people ages 13 and up. Some of the comedians I have never been a fan of (Carrot Top for sure!) but their comedy sets don't last long and you can always fast-forward past them.

Originally released in 2003, this 2006 updated version is as pictured above on Amazon and comes with a cool booklet that described each of the comedians' careers, appeal and status in pop culture. Other reviewers have complained in an overtly subjective by going ""This isn't their best material!"" but that's fine as this is when these comedians which we adore were first taking off career-wise. I'm just happy that nothing here is irrelevant or terribly outdated, and that this set can be given to a friend or fun to have playing at a friend's party on the television.",1505952000,,1221,4.759433962264151
