2785988,5,B000NVT0PM,"This is perhaps one of the better anime to come out in recent years. I honestly did not like it very much when I first saw it, and I watched it in chronological order instead of broadcast order. After telling a friend about it who wanted to see it, we watched it in broadcast order, and it was like a whole different show. I liked the show way more after seeing it in this order, and the characters grew on me too. The characters at first glance are rather cliche and stereotypes, but they manage to really break the bounds. The story is also quite fantastic and humorous. The show also contains many hidden references and funny little parodies that only certain fans may get or appreciate.

Now on to the box set: this is one of the most beautiful and nicely done special editions, definately worth the money. Also, the order of episodes for the special edition discs is similar to the broadcast order, so I highly reccomend this ordering. The stuff you get with the box set (and the design of the box itself) are above and beyond usual special edition boxes. Just look at the picture.",1181520000,,1086,4.457286432160804
2785989,4,B000NVT0PM,"I really enjoyed this title in Japanese, but as one of those who saw the series fansubbed first, a couple of things grated:

- Bandai is apparently changing the episode order from that in which the TV series was shown. The fourth episode in the original series was the baseball episode, which is neither on this disc nor first on the next one. The Japanese TV series was shown out of chronological sequence, to put the climax of the series at the end. If Bandai continues to follow chronological order, the climax will come somewhere in the middle. Can't tell, as the episode order on the second disc isn't available.

- There is something slightly wrong about the English voices, especially Haruhi and Kyon. I can't put my finger on what exactly I don't like about Haruhi's, but Kyon doesn't sound puzzled or jaded enough, I think.

So I give the American sequencing and translation three stars.

But the deluxe box for the series is excellent, as are the extras. Packaging five stars. Average of four.",1181001600,5,1003,4.681818181818182
2785990,2,B000NVT0PM,"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an excellent series, one of the best to come out of Japan in quite some time, and a personal favorite. And the extras in the box set are impressive. So why am I giving it such a low rating? Because Bandai and Kadokawa Pictures USA have made what I consider a rather poor decision in the English release. The episodes are presented IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER!!! Why is this a problem? Because Haruhi is told out of order intentionally. This significantly adds to the mystery of the show, and gives it quite a powerful ending (as compared to the chronological end of the series, which appears mid series in broadcast form, and is rather dull). Each episode beyond the first ends with the two main characters, Kyon and Haruhi, vocally battling over the next episode's number; which makes for a humorous, if initially confusing, preview. This is all gone! Most fans of the show saw it first in fansub form in the original broadcast order. These DVDs are presented in chronological order like the Japanese DVD release. That release was heavily criticized by the show's very large fan base (Haruhi was one of Japan's two biggest Anime releases last year, deservedly so). I don't know what they were thinking then or now.

To make matters worse, the encoding quality is poor.  It is noticeably worse than the fansubs I have (and planned to delete as soon as I received the box - glad I checked first). And the subtitle text is unnecessarily, annoyingly large. You'll see every line of duologue clearly, but not much of the animation behind it.  I can't tell you how disappointed I am.

I'm seriously tempted to return the DVD, wire money to the artists in Japan, and just keep my fansubs.

If you're a fan of the series you're going to be disappointed with this release. If you haven't seen the series before, I'm very sorry that you won't get to see the Haruhi everyone is talking about. I can't imagine it will have the same magic the way it is presented here.",1181001600,15,1988,4.620396600566572
2785991,5,B000NVT0PM,"This is probably the most deluxe set I've seen for any series. All the little extras are great.

I was surprised by the English version of the series. To be honest, I think all of the voices are pretty fitting, with the exception of Kyon's. The English voice actor just doesn't carry the same tone of righteous anger the original Kyon had.

That being said, if you enjoyed the Japanese version, you will enjoy the English version.",1180396800,3,430,4.571428571428571
2785992,5,B000NVT0PM,"About the show: first of all I would like to say that this is one of my all time favorite shows to watch. I watched the fansubs before it was licensed in the US and I can say that this is definitely one of the best animes out there. It's got it all: action, comedy, drama, romance, and even sci-fi stuff.

About the DVD: I am not one to usually like the English dubs of anime but this is one that is actually pretty good. I still prefer the subtitles and Japanese audio but its not a big deal with this one. The special features on the disc are great. The first 4 episodes of the Adventures of the ASOS brigade and some commercials for the show and the making of those commercials. The CD of the TV show and radio show's EDs is great too. You also get a cool Haruhi head band, a double sided pencil board, a Haruhism iron on, and a cool box to put it all in (and the following volumes).

Overall anyone that is a big fan of the series should pick this up and anyone that is just a regular fan should still get it because you really get a lot for your money! Shop around and get the best price you can!",1180396800,5,1101,4.0
2785993,5,B000NVT0PM,"For once, I agree that a ""popular"" show is good. Probably a lot of the people who like this show like it for different reasons than I, although I'm sure there are also people who like it for the same reasons I do.

The best thing about this show is the animation. Kyoto Animation is by far the highest quality animation studio currently in existence in Japan. They haven't done many things yet though, so there's no need to go looking for all things they've done. I think the only other released show they've done with animation quality at this level is Full Metal Panic:2nd Raid and Fumoffu (not the 1st season). Before that they mostly did Inuyasha which was a super long TV series so the animation can't be as high-quality.

The story seems kind of interesting, and is deeper than most might realize. However the comedy elements aren't as funny to me as they are to other people. I don't really find this show funny at all, and I wasn't impressed with Episode ""00"". I strongly recommend watching Episodes 1-3 first. Unfortunately that's not what I did, and I think my enjoyment of this series might be forever tarnished by that. The idea behind Episode 00 was good but I don't think it was done well enough, it wasn't as funny as it should have been.

To me, the main reason to watch this show is to watch a funny-looking girl constantly make strange motions with her body in ultra high-quality animation. I don't think Haruhi is a funny person. It is just her appearance that is funny. Even though the story is interesting, I don't get into it very much. I mostly end up watching the funny-looking girl make her strange motions. Fortunately, to me that is enough to give a show a 5-star rating, since drawing quality, style, and animation quality are my primary criteria for good anime.

Directing: 4 of 5 stars. Much better than I expected after seeing the Haruhi trailer on the FMP:2nd Raid DVD.
Story: 4 of 5 stars. This show comes from Japanese novels originally. I think a lot of thought was put into engineering the Haruhi character and the premise behind this show. But most of the time I forget about the story. Haruhi's actions make me forget.
Drawing Style: 5 of 5 stars. Noizi Ito style, which is excellent. Melancholy of Haruhi is more faithful to the original Noizi Ito style than Shakugan no Shana (the other major anime drawn in this style) is, but both shows have excellent drawings.
Drawing Quality: 5 of 5 stars. So far, anyway. I can see a little bit of variance from episode to episode but not too much.
Animation Quality: 5+ of 5 stars. Possibly the best animation I've ever seen, definitely in top 3. Only rivals: FMP:2nd Raid also by this studio, and Godannar!! a robot fighting anime (which is generally underappreciated by anime ""fans""....oh well).
Music: 3 of 5 stars. It is not terrific but sufficient. It's not a hindrance. A lot of people seem to think the music is awesome, but I don't agree. I think people get blinded by the awesome animations in the opening and ending sequences, and think the songs are awesome too, but the songs alone are only okay songs.

Now for a review of the DVD itself. Despite being released through Bandai Entertainment, this DVD is essentially like a Geneon DVD. The dubbing studio and VAs are what Geneon usually employs. The DVD authoring studio is what Geneon usually employs. Therefore the quality of the video, menus, and the appearance of the subtitles is identical to Geneon stuff. There's nothing Bandai about this release except for the name stamped on the cover. There are more extras than normal for a Geneon release though. Technically Kadokawa USA (a new company, I think) licensed this show...therefore it's packed with live-action (ohno) extras just like their other releases (FMP:2nd Raid).

But about the extras, I have some issues with the inclusion of the ""USA fan-made"" live-action videos in this. I recommend they not be watched. There are some good things in them, but also some bad things. The ""fan"" extras make multiple statements which indirectly advocate the common practice of fansubbing. There are some good things about fansubbing, but there are bad things also. In the end, people should know that fansubbing in any form is technically illegal. Even fansubbing something unlicensed is still technically illegal. Downloading is illegal. Openly saying that downloading fansubs is okay as long as you buy a domestic Haruhi DVD afterwards, is not wise. I am not trying to preach that fansubbing is a bad practice. But it is not smart to put a video that advocates fansubbing (even with ""conditions"") on a COMMERCIAL DVD release. This directly contradicts that WARNING message you get when you first put any commercial DVD into a DVD player.

I wonder if the executives at Kadokawa pictures, and Kyoto Animation, know that the USA ""fan-made"" extras have this sort of content in them? In particular I refer to the fan-made Episode ""001"" and the credits at the end of every ""episode"". The extras in the FMP:2nd Raid DVD had the Japanese producers at Kyoto Animation stating some slightly negative things about fansubs...I think if they knew what has snuck into the official USA Haruhi DVDs they might object.",1180051200,7,5196,4.753880266075388
2785994,4,B000NVT0PM,"This is a very orginal and creative title. When I watched the imports, it gave me a fresh interest in old steriotypes. You got the logical alien, the sexy timetraveler, the omipotent being who can destroy the universe, and the annoying esper who knows everything that you want to punch in the face. All this amazing adventures takes place in a high school drama setting.

Basically a guy nicknamed as Kyon just recently matured enough to relise there is nothing special about his life, a completely normal boy who goes to school. This all changes when he meets Haruhi Suzumiya, who is obessed with the paranormal and everything else you find in a Otaku(crazy fan), and utterly bored with her life in general. Because of certain series of events, Kyon is conscripted in start a club with Suzumiya called the SOS brigade. The club is has no real purpose except to solve mysteries and discover paranormal activities. Ironiclly an alien, timetravler, and a esper join the group in disguise revealling there nature and motive to Kyon; the only normal person in the club. All three of them inform Kyon that Suzumiay unknowingly is the a powerful being that can reshape reality to her will. Their mission to keep Suzumiya occupied with fun activities, with the alternative being the destruction of autoevolution/time line/universe.

The main story arc actally takes a back seat, with mainly just drama/comedy antics you find in many anime. there was no real action for the most part, but I couldn't stop watching until I finished it in one day. The main character Kyon with is pessimistic outlook on life, and is tentency to notice plot holes, and maintain a dry sense of humor; made me identiy with him easilly. The animation is high quality in my opinion, and the music.....is abolutely amazing! I spent half the day just listening to the ending credits!

So in short the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a good well rounded title that has everything a anime newbie would like, but still give someing new for those long time otakus.",1178928000,14,2027,4.818965517241379

2786046,5,B000NVT0PM,"Haruhi Suzumiya is a new arrival in high school and even the kids who went to Middle School with her consider her odd.  Her announcement the first day of school that she's not interested in anyone unless he's an alien, a time traveler or an Esper, sets the tone for the episodes in which narrator, Kyon, gets involved in Haruhi's adventures, most of which are invented in her mind and are disasters.  And then...it turns out Haruhi may be right. There are definitely strange goings-on at the school, and a couple of rather odd new student arrivals, too. Then Kyon finds out that Haruhi is very important to the future of the world...and so is he...

Once I got past some of the high-pitched voices and the fact that Haruhi and a couple of the other female characters never talk but always shout at ear-deafening levels, I enjoyed this series.  Kyon's narration is hilarious as well as snarky and sarcastic. He's the perfect foil for Haruhi's super-enthusiasm. The stories are a combination of adventure, satire, and comedy with a little sci-fi thrown in.  This particular bundle only had 3 episodes but I had seen the entire series already so I went into  it knowing what to expect. Now I'm on the hunt for the others so I can follow Haruhi's adventures to their ultimate conclusion.",1396656000,,1283,4.68

2786049,5,B000NVT0PM,"FYI, Limited Edition sets 2, 3, and 4 contain the complete anime in original broadcast viewing order (the best way to watch the series). If you're uninterested in the box, special features, or any of the extras, you don't need set 1 at all.

Regardless it is a very nice box and I do enjoy the extras. This set also contains the first DVD of the anime in chronological order, but again I don't recommend watching it that way.

For those who may be confused, once you have all of the limited edition sets, you will have two complete DVD collections of this series, in two different episode orders. It works like this:

Set Chronological DVD  Broadcast DVD
1     episodes 0 - 3       N/A
2     episodes 4 - 7       episodes 0 - 4
3     episodes 8 - 10      episodes 5 - 9
4     episodes 11 - 13   episodes 10 - 13

When discussing this series with other fans, beware that episodes of this series do not have unambiguous episode numbers, so stick to using the titles instead.",1388793600,2,972,4.271186440677966
2786050,5,B000NVT0PM,"When I purchased this item, the price was around five dollars. I see the seller changed the price. I am glad I got such a bargain for a limited edition bundle!

Onto the item itself. The bundle or box set comes with everything that is shown in the picture. Kyon and Kyon's Sister character CDs include four songs. One an original pertaining to the character's personality and their version of the closing song ""Hare Hare Yukai."" The other two are just karaoke versions of the first two songs. The DVD itself contains four episodes: ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 00-3."" The first episode might confuse you if you're new to the series, but it surprisingly introduces the characters somewhat well. To this day, 00 is still my favorite episode. Please don't judge the voice acting on that episode! They're doing poorly on purpose.

If you're the type that only likes Japanese dubs, it is also included on the DVD. There's also plenty of extras to watch as well. I'm looking forward to owning the rest of the volumes of my favorite anime series.",1373414400,,1045,4.704918032786885

2786052,4,B000NVT0PM,"(This review is for the 4 individual volumes as a whole)

The selling point for these DVDs is having to pay only a fraction for the set (Volumes 1, 2, 3 & 4) than what the single package costs AND coming with awesome keepsakes (including CDs!).  There is extra content but it's not that entertaining (behind the scenes live-action/American S.O.S. Brigade fan thing).  There's about 3 episodes per disc, with the second disc containing the original broadcast order in Japanese with English subtitles.

Also note - this is only season 1 - there is a season 2 that happens simultaneously among these episodes that you should also check out (just mind the infamous 'Endless Eight' section :P)",1357516800,3,688,4.854700854700854

2786054,5,B000NVT0PM,"I must say that this was one of the first anime series I ever watched after I got into anime (sometime last summer, I can't exactly remember now) and even though I have seen many anime since then, Haruhi has always remained on my top 5 list, because of the really unique characters and storyline. The music from the series is also very enjoyable to me. I must give props to Bandai for this release, as this first box is simply amazing. All of the artwork is great, and the extras are very entertaining. ""Hare Hare Yukai"" is still one of my favorite Japanese songs of all time, so owning a copy of the CD was well worth it for me.
If you're starting out with this series, I would highly advise that you watch it in the broadcast order instead of the chronological order. The first broadcast episode does a good job of explaining the characters in the first episode, and leaves ""the best for last"", as in the 8th episode, which is built up to throughout the whole series.
If you're a Haruhi fan, this Bandai release is an absolute must have.",1353888000,,1039,4.360824742268041

You do, however, receive what is shown in the picture above. You get the Volume 1 DVD containing episodes 1-3 as well as episode 0. You also get the Kyon and Kyon's Sister Character CDs. I was a little bummed that it didn't come with what everyone was saying, but at about $5, I can't complain. Also, the series is great and you should all watch it.",1353283200,19,671,4.419354838709677
2786076,5,B000NVT0PM,"If you're an Anime Otaku (and you understand what an Anime Otaku is) then this series is for you. This review concerns Volume 1 of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (Limited Edition).

BLUF: Worth every penny

Details: If you're reading this - then you already know the story behind this anime. (If not, I won't spoil the series here.) Watching this series in Broadcast Order is essential to appreciating it.  Volume 1 of the Limited Edition box set includes a gorgeous art box for the DVDs and CDs associated with this season of the show.  It also includes a CD with Music from the series that is actually an imported version of a CD sold on the open market in Japan - and if you like the music in this show, you'll want this CD. Finally, there's beautifully drawn insert that has the show's characters in various poses on both sides that's printed on plastic (the pencil board mentioned in the description and it's actually very nice) and other goodies in the box.

So is it worth paying extra for this version versus the Regular Edition? ABSOLUTELY. It's actually a great value:
-Same DVD you get with the regular edition (price varies - but $9 as of this writing)
-A Gorgeous Art Box
-Hare Hare Yukai CD Single (about $25 from Amazon Japan depending on the Dollar/Yen rate)
-Other goodies thrown in for good measure

First time viewers need to know, that you will also want to invest in the other Limited Edition volumes of this series.  Each includes the Regular Edition DVD + an English Subtitled DVD of the show in Broadcast Order (very important) + a US release of the Japanese CDs associated with this season of the show (big value) + other goodies.  The Limited Edition is worth it for the CDs and the Broadcast Order DVDs alone.  The Goodies are what make this a very special Limited Edition release that is well worth the extra money.

Also, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that people who watch this show view it in Broadcast Order the First Time.  If you do this with the English Dub, you'll actually lose part of the story (while this is minor with most anime, but it is particularly true for this series).  Dub Fans, bear with me - you'll appreciate why I tell you that after you've seen it through.

The Hare Hare Yukai CD Single contains:
-Hare Hare Yukai - the full version of the (pleasantly addictive) ending song used in the Anime Series
-Welcome Unknown - the full version of the ending song for the radio drama series broadcast in Japan
-Karaoke Versions (No Vocals) of the above songs - so you can embarass yourself in the privacy of your car

Finally, if you haven't watched this series yet - there's enough depth to this show that you'll get something different out of every viewing.

This series has my strongest recommendation.",1315785600,,2743,4.580777096114519
2786077,1,B000NVT0PM,"The price is too high, for nearly the same price you can get all of the first season, which includes these episodes",1294876800,,115,4.2727272727272725
2786078,4,B000NVT0PM,"The first episode of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is actually a so-bad-it's-good video created by the cast later in the show's timeline, featuring a Battle Waitress from the future, in a Bunny Suit, defending an Esper who is unaware of his powers from an Evil Witch from Space. It is directed by the main character and narrated by the show's narrator, and is chock-full of obviously-drawn-in special effects and wooden student acting, among other things. Near the end of the episode, a cat clinging to the Witch inexplicably begins to speak; the Witch bops it on the head with her wand before the director notices, saying that as well as being a witch, ""she is also a ventriloquist."" But is she really?

Though the next episode is Melancholy's ""proper"" beginning, what's so remarkable about Episode 00 is that it perfectly summarizes nearly everything in the show.

About the show itself--the narrator is Kyon, a student who has recently given up dreams of aliens, espers and time-travelers for high-school life. But when he meets Haruhi Suzumiya (the Director), an eccentric transfer student who longs to meet aliens, espers and time-travelers, he is literally dragged (by his shirtcollar) into the Spreading Excitement All Over the World with Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade, or S.O.S. Brigade for short. Other inductees include Nagato (the Witch), who uses the clubroom as a reading room, Koizumi (the Esper), a mysterious transfer student, and Mikuru (the Battle Waitress from the Future), who Haruhi just grabs out of the hallway so she can exploit otaku fetishes to raise club awareness. Yes, really.

But Kyon quickly discovers that in her search for aliens, time-travelers, and espers, Haruhi has unwittingly gathered together a group of none other than aliens (with magical powers), time travelers (who enjoy dressing up as waitresses) and espers (who are only useful some of the time.) What is even more worrisome, though, is that Haruhi is quite literally Director--and if she ever gets bored of Spreading Excitement All Over the World, she could easily abandon it and everything in it...

Besides the absolutely bizzare first episode, the others are business as usual--establishing exposition, etc. They are, however, pretty funny. Most people seem like the love-her-or-hate-her, unknowingly all-powerful high-school student Haruhi the best, but though she often overpowers everybody else through sheer force of personality, Kyon still holds his own, possibly because he has most of the best lines. The other characters hold their own too, but they don't really come into their own until later episodes. While there's plenty of reasons to watch the Japanese dub--the person who voiced Haruhi is supposedly now legendary--the English dub is pretty good too, with Crispin Freeman nailing Kyon and Wendee Lee holding her own against the Japanese seiyuu with Haruhi.

It's certainly not perfect, but at any rate, this is probably the best high-school comedy drama parodying anime stereotypes while exploiting fetishes and featuring questionable science fiction and crazy battle sequences while presenting metaphysical questions about the nature of reality ever, though admittedly most of the latter come up in the next disc. Reccomended! Also stay for the closer.",1212019200,,3268,5.289017341040463
2786079,4,B000NVT0PM,"i bought this mainly because a coworker of mine recommended it and i figured why the heck not.  I'll give just about any anime series that has some substance to it a shot.  With this one at first watching episode 00, it made me want to just lose all control and just freak out. I am sure that it was well thought out but after watching that.  I just wanted to move on and try to get the story advanced somewhat.  It does that in episode 1 enought to get me slightly interested and the 2nd episode was cool as well.  Episode 3 however didn't really do anything for me at all, it was just kind of a seen it and want to move on episode.

It's something that's a little different.  I didn't care for Haruhi forcing the other member into wearing a bunny costume.  Why not just go out and hand out fliers like everyone else instead of dressing up like an extra from the Pussycat Dolls.  I know the girl is one screw loose from being sent to the funny farm for life.

Sometimes i thought she was cool and others.  I wanted to kick her in the head for being some freakin annoying and bossy.  Its crazy that the other members of the ""SOS Brigade"" put up with her.  I know she's important for various reasons, but come on anyone ever hear of the word NO.  There's some comedy and fun parts to this first volume.

I just hope the 2nd Volume kicks it up a notch for me, some action maybe.  I know everyone won't agree on this and thats okay.  I just wanted to get this out there.  Melancholy of Haruhi has promise and i hope to be there enjoying it with everyone else.",1207094400,,1556,4.13

2786081,5,B000NVT0PM,"So I bought this set, and it's awesome. It's just plain awesome to actually have these episodes on DVD. The box is awesome too. As far as the review of the DVD goes, buy it. If you're an anime fan, or even if you're a non-anime fan living in a sea of fans of something else (video games, etc.) you'll enjoy this and find a real character connection with the narrator, Kyon.

But the packaging is where this set's all at. Great box with high-quality art on every side, even the inside, the doors to the front are magnetic, and there's places for the other DVDs and CDs from the other limited edition volumes. Getting the CD drawer out was a bit of a hassle. When I finally got it out, I put a loose piece of tape on the bottom of it to use as a pully to get it out easier next time. There's also a box holding the extra goodies that is holding space next to the dvd, where the others should go if you collect 'em all. This is where I get a little confused. It seems like they want you to buy the other dvds, and put them in this box. That presents a few problems. The first, being if you copped out and got the dvd only editions, is that now you have to take that box of goodies out and throw it somewhere. I guess if you actually used them for stuff then they'd already be gone, but collectors try to keep it all together and can't in this situation. The other issue involves the CDs.

Still, I gave this one a try - and am SO GLAD I DID! Aside from being hilarious(I hurt myself laughing), the story evolves into some very deep(existential?) ideas. What IF a girl came along, who through some cosmic quirk, affected major events in the world/universe/existence as we know it? And what if she also happened to be bi-polar/manic-depressive(more than most teen girls!), and quite bright, curious, easily bored, and the most bossy, demanding imperious child EVER??? You'd try to keep her happy, wouldn't you? Even if it meant putting up with the most outrageous scemes ever concocted? AND the bunny costume??? DO NOT pre-judge this. It is totally unique.

The extra stuff is nice, it includes a haruhi T-shirt iron-on, the box, a music cd (unluckily missing the incredible opening), Haruhi's hair-piece and the actual dvd. My only complain about the series would be the sometimes rather unsavory fan-service and the insane idea of actually puttig the episodes in chronological order which completly throws off some of the magic in the Melancholy of Harhi Suzuyima. Luckilly for us, people complained so much that the next edition of the special edition actually include the episodes in the original broadcast order which is what i wanted in the first place in adition to the ones in chronological order for the few who actually liked that version better. This bundle actually gets 4 and a half stars for the ""lacking"" extras (namely the cd and dvd's since they only contain 5 episodes one of which may throw off a bunch of people, and the cd lacks the opening which is just a sin) Overrall great series, can't wait for the next edition, nice start for the series and I expect some serious delivering from the next season.",1189555200,,1279,4.818181818181818

2786097,5,B000NVT0PM,"This is one of the few anime series out there which is booking to be a true classic in the world of anime. It has gained popularity in Japan and North America since it aired on Japanese TV in 2006. I have been watching this seires from when it was a fan sub and now I own the DVDs. The plot twists are many and it has many eliments of fan service and even mecha. The story dares to be diffrent becouse its shown and told from the third persons view point and leaves you guessing till the end.  This is NOT a anime serries for KIDs it has many parts that are mature! This serries takes all the classic anime plots we know and love and put them into a understandable context very well. Its a sure hit for any Anime Otaku however the way the episodes are shown on the english DVDs are rather strange.

Bandai did a good job on the dub for the most part. I found no real weakness with the english voices. BangZoom did a decent job with the voices and the dub scored a A- on the review from [...]

I perfer the orginal broadcast versions of the episodes to the mix up order on the dubed DVDs. But worrie not they have even included the original TV version in the second and third DVDs as a bonus.

The extas that come with the Box set are top notch. Not many Anime series come with so many extras and even a CD! Dont let the price put you off from buying the box set its well worth it! Bandai has said that all of the stuff that comes with the box sets are limited edition and will not be sold on there own.

2786098,5,B000NVT0PM,"The first disc of this series sets up all the characters...even from episode 00, which is Haruhi's insane little anime-style movie (commented upon constantly by Kyon, the cynic).  As we watch, and listen, from Kyon's point of view, Haruhi appears in school and starts her own club, dragging in apparently innocent members into the SOS Brigade as she searches for X-Files level oddities in her own world...Of course, she cannot see the forest for the trees; as her club grows, each member reveals him/herself to Kyon, who sees Kyon as a Key of some sort.  There is an esper, a time traveller, and a alien, all there to watch Haruhi, who did something three years ago that has troubled different organizations, so they are researching her.  What does Kyon have to do with any of this?  Simply because he is the only normal human that Haruhi has paid any attention to.

A must-watch, with giggles and a bit of fan-service (no nudity, just panty shots) and a lot of odd-ball entertainment.

Definitely far, far above the caliber of Excel Saga, so don't expect that level of insanity.",1184025600,3,1079,4.74331550802139

It comes with the first dvd, a soundtrack and a hilarious Haruhi headband. It also has more space for (i presume) the rest of the series and soundtracks. Great stuff!",1183593600,,392,4.695652173913044
2786100,4,B000NVT0PM,"As Amazon says, despite the title, the series is anything but melancholy. The melancholy of Haruhi is that the world isn't nearly as exciting and full of adventure as she would like - a fact that she is hell-bent on changing.

When I first heard about this series about a year ago, I had no interest in it. Time travelers? Magic girls? Aliens? ESPers? Hyper hijinks? Sounded like every other cliche school comedy out there. I'm glad that I caught this by accident now, because I immediately sought out the rest. A clear parody of anime and sci-fi cliches, this series manages to be both cliche and original, and always entertaining. Haruhi wants to live the life you see in manga, encountering mysterious exchange students and aliens and time travelers. Since none of the school clubs cater to her way of thinking, she forms the S.O.S. Brigade in order to search out life's mysteries, with her classmate Kyon dragged along to do all the heavy lifting.

Kyon is the narrator, and is about half responsible for the unique presentation of the shows themes. His Japanese VA caught my attention immediately; I find half of what Kyon says hilarious due to the deadpan yet ridiculous way he says it. Kyon spends the series following Haruhi, for reasons even he's not sure why, as she barrels headfirst into the world looking for adventure (even though everything she's looking for is ironically among her own club members).

The special editions of this series are pricey, but you're getting a lot for your money. The only serious complaint I had was the decision on both sides to release the episodes in chronological order, rather than broadcast order. Originally they were shown on Japanese TV in scrambled order. The preview trailers (with Kyon and Haruhi arguing about which episode was next) told you what number episode the next would be. These previews have been replaced by Nagano giving a humorously repetitious tagline. Due to fan request, starting with set two, extras will include an extra dvd with all the episodes in original broadcast order.

To some this may not seem like a big deal, but the original broadcast order, while hard for some to follow, gave the series a unique spin, as well as unfolding the characters in an interesting fashion. Also, the helped the series to uphold a certain amount of tension, and allowed for a dramatic ending (which is now episode 6 instead of 14) that hit all the major points of the show.

This is ultimately a series made for fans (it is a parody of manga/anime after all), so the releases are made for fans. If you have only a casual interst in new series, then the regular release with the chronological order is probably fine for you. For people who are already fans of the show, or just big anime fans, the special editions are great sets that are nicely packaged and full of great extras. I only wish they'd made episodes of what happens in the drama cds too! (Which probably shows what a hopeless fan I am.)",1183507200,,2962,4.699421965317919
2786101,5,B000NVT0PM,"While not all popular shows are great, ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"" goes beyond my expectations. The story focuses on Kyon and his adventures with Haruhi Suzumiya, a girl in his homeroom high school class. The two become good friends at first, but Kyon eventually regrets becoming friends after Haruhi pushes him into starting a club for Haruhi, named the S.O.S. Brigade. Leader Suzumiya formed the group to find aliens, espers and time travelers and play with them.

Although the concept seems childish, the aliens, espers and time travelers are ironically right under Haruhi's nose. The dialogue takes a fascinating turn into science-fiction as S.O.S. Brigade's members Yuki, Mikuru and Itsuki explain their purpose in joining Haruhi in her exploits. Yuki is an alien, Mukuru is a time traveler and Itsuki is an esper (psychic), and Haruhi may be a god.

This is a silly comedy that will entertain anyone, as long as they're willing to accept some fan service (partial nudity) from the characters. Haruhi's abuse of Mikuru as the moe (cute girl) fantasy of guys is hilarious in a naughty way. Haruhi strips her and dresses her up in bunny costumes and blackmail the computer club president to get equipment. It's a little cruel, but the abuse actually become more hilarious as the series continues.

I like the dialogue in this series. The characters make it very memorable, and their science fiction dialogue makes the series sound so cool and intelligent in an absurd way. Their science fiction origins also makes for great side stories, especially with Yuki, the alien who lives alone and wants a friend. Just be prepared for the unexpected violence in episode 5 on the next DVD.",1183334400,,1691,4.968197879858657
2786102,2,B000NVT0PM,"i'm sorry, but i'm going to have to say that i really wasn't impressed with this show.

well, hang on, i'll start positively as opposed to being 100% negative.

the animation quality is superb... it's rare to see shows made with the same type of quality animation in todays world of 'mass produced' anime.

the opening ending music is outstanding also... i must have watched the full ending credits 100 times on youtube.

those 2 factors, plus it's over the top popularity are what made me get volume 1. but, actually watching the show, i was nothing but disapointed...

aside from episode 0, which is out of place (and boring if you ask me) the other 3 episodes on this disc didn't do well at all in convincing me to keep watching. i realise that it's ""not in the correct order"" as so many haruhi fans have already said, but honestly, if the revelation in episode 3/4 hadn't come then, i would have thought there was nothing to this show at all.

haruhi herself was my chief complaint. as main character i certainly didn't warm up to her at all. aside from stopping her from getting bored so she doesn't 'reset the world', i can't understand why anyone would want to be around her. her tactics for getting what she wants, her constant sexual abuse towards mikuru and the 0 character development for her in volume 1, left me not caring if she destroyed the world, i just wanted to get away from her.

so be fair warned, as this show may be overwhelmingly popular at the moment, but it certainly isn't for everyone.",1183161600,11,1514,4.5036496350364965

The DVD is chalk-full of delightful extras to expand upon the experience of Haruhi's universe. The extras beyond the DVD are well received: the music CD, the iron-on design, and pencil board are something to display. Sadly, the hair band was rather small. The special edition box itself is well-designed with the opening flaps and the hidden magnet to close it shut. The ribbon inside for easy pullout of the DVDs is a nice touch.",1182816000,,590,4.728155339805825
2786104,5,B000NVT0PM,"As one of my first real dips into the world of expensive limited special edition releases... I have to say this is a quality release. Probably one of the most ridiculously complex boxes I've ever seen, and full of useless yet cool goodies.
Anyway, Haruhi has been very popular in the fansub world since its airing last year, and it is definitely worth seeing, at least to see what all the hype is about. It's a quality piece of work, with beautiful animation from Kyoto Animation.
Bandai's DVD release does present the episodes in a different order from the Japanese broadcast, as the broadcast was not in chronological order. While some might be disappointed by this, the Japanese DVD release was the same way, and for the completists (which I confess includes me), the second, third and fourth volumes of the special edition will include bonus DVDs with the episodes in broadcast order.
On a technical note, the video quality is generally very good, but the opening credits sequence seems to have an unusual amount of compression artifacts. However the show itself is not affected. Also, the subtitles are unusually large, and make some odd choices of phrasing, using ""future man"" instead of ""time traveller"". Bandai would do well to address these issues in future volumes, which luckily do not detract too much from this release.
In any case, this series has had quite an impact on anime fans, and is well worth checking out. This DVD, while not perfect, is generally quite good and worth a purchase (although the more budget oriented might go for the regular edition).",1181692800,5,1572,4.847583643122676
