8238937,4,B0010X746Y,"I had ""The Horror Of Party Beach"" on VHS that I purchased 5 years ago from a website that sells horror movies that have been out of circulation for years. I paid $20 for it.  It was not a very good copy, but I bought it just the same because I couldn't find it anywhere else.  When I found out about this collection I put it immediately on my wish list.  I purchased it when it was on sale for $12.99. It sought of made up for the VHS copy.  In this collection the video and audio transfer is of much better quality.  On the VHS copy, on some frames, you couldn't see some of the actors faces. I'm not just talking about the shots that were filmed in the dark.  The scene from the beach party had the same problem.  You couldn't see some of the actor's faces.  I resent the fact that I paid $20 for it.

Now I put the VHS copy  away  in my closet, hoping some day that I could sell it for half the price I paid for.  As for ""Curse Of The Living Corpse"", it's an ok film if you like movies that show people that rise from the dead and plot revenge on those who did them wrong when they were alive.  ""Violent Midnight"" has more or less the same atmosphere. With this collection you get 3 movies at a good price.
