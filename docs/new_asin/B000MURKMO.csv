8172471,3,B000MURKMO,"Bizarre movie...very slow build-up, no over-the-top gore, or muchof it at all for that matter. Some decent action sequences, but overall very dragged out, I found myself FF to scenes with any action potential..when you start doing that, you know the movie ain't goin' your way. Recommended for Horror completists, but don't be too sorry that it isn't in your collection, there are lots better.",1524355200,,393,5.061538461538461
8172472,5,B000MURKMO,great for horror movie collectors.  one of the biggest cult classics from the 80's horror genere.  the fact that it is on vhs makes it more retro,1353715200,,145,4.333333333333333
