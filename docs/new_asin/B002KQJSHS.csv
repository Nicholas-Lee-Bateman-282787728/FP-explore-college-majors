8372186,5,B002KQJSHS,Great for the new quilter. But for me was a refresher course.,1405728000,,61,4.166666666666667
8372187,3,B002KQJSHS,"This is a magnificient dvd for learning how to quilt like your grandmother, etc. but I was deeply disappointed that I paid twice as much as what JoAnn Fabrics price was and that was without a coupon.  So pay attention.  You can find it for $20 at JoAnn Fabric without a coupon and I paid $31 because I thought I would not find it anywhere else.",1362873600,2,344,4.196969696969697
8372188,5,B002KQJSHS,"Wow, this is the perfect product.  All you ever want or need to know about thread, material, needles, thimbles and then detailed instructions via close up video for hand quilting.  Every quilter should purchase this DVD.  She shows her thimble during the demonstration....buy one.  You will not be sorry.",1325203200,7,304,5.142857142857143
8372189,5,B002KQJSHS,"This DVD should be on every quilter's must have list!  Techniques to improve your hand quilting are thoroughly explained and demonstrated. She also rates needles, batting, etc. and is not afraid to name manufacturer's and give reasons for her ratings. Has lowered my hand stitching from 7 stitches per inch to a consistent 9 stitches per inch. And, I was using her technique prior to viewing the DVD. Something about have it demonstrated that really helps!",1291248000,8,456,5.0
8372190,5,B002KQJSHS,"This is absolutely the best instructional video I've ever seen!  The information that DD gives is so amazing.  She has done so much research for quilters.
Perfect video for anyone who wants to know the facts behind what works and what doesn't in quilting and why.
Thank you DD!!",1285718400,7,278,4.653061224489796
