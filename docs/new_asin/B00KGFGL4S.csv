8658367,4,B00KGFGL4S,"Great compilation with a variety of segments from other recordings and video comps with Devo...great for completists (sic). ""The Story of De-evolution"" and the ""1980 Flipside"" dvd are more focused on the ealier 'hardcore Devo' years-when the band was actually young!",1440720000,2,266,5.512195121951219
8658368,5,B00KGFGL4S,I am a fan going back to their 2nd release after seeing them on SNL as a kid. This is a great DVD.  I was not surprised that it stood the test of time and the picture was great.  the extras were very good as well. a must for a fan.,1417392000,7,231,3.5098039215686274
8658369,3,B00KGFGL4S,"I found this DVD to be somewhat disappointing. It had quite a bit of live material from early in their career but the quality looked like a VHS dupe. Still, there were some parts that were pretty good.",1412812800,4,201,4.315789473684211
8658370,5,B00KGFGL4S,"Arrived in great condition...and it's DEVO!! If you're a fan, this is an absolute must. If you don't like it, you don't get it.",1409356800,2,127,4.333333333333333
8658371,5,B00KGFGL4S,"This, the re-release of The Men Who Make The Music, is probably one of the single most important pieces of videography in Devo's history. The content in this documentary (predating the traditional ""home video"" that would become ubiquitous in the 80's), is focused on Devo as they rode the coattails of success during their first two records (1978-1979). While most people tend to remember them from their iconic Freedom of Choice era and onward, here was a time when Devo were truly high concept, weird synth punk, and even with decent acting chops.

In fact, that is the highlight of this release - the mini episodic skits Devo does with General & Booji Boy. You'll see scenes of Devo hanging out in strip clubs with synthesizers, and Devo wearing chrome ski makes discussing business with their managers. The other huge bonus is the live footage from their first major label tour in '78. If you loved the previous DVD for the Freedom Of Choice tour, then you're going to love this. This is prime Devo: Fast, bouncy, and tight as a knot. They sound youthful and vibrant here.

Plus they throw in a show from 1996 ( similar set up as the previous lollapalooza show DVD from the same year). Only here they play in prison suits and grunge out their set a bit with mostly their guitar driven work and a few left field acoustic renditions.

This release is really a no brainer for Devo fans.

Cheers.",1407974400,22,1396,4.616935483870968
