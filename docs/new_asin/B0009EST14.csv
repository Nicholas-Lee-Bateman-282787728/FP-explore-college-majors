8059529,4,B0009EST14,Good fights but like the other felony fights videos there is always some annoying chick and too much talking. Turn the volume down and it's great.,1294358400,,146,4.653846153846154
8059530,3,B0009EST14,"At the outset I'll say this is a horrible DVD. It may be among consenting adults but it is human cockfighting nonetheless. Ex-cons and losers who'd do anything to be on TV egged on by the annoying guy from your high school who encouraged fights among other people (never himself). Once someone is knocked out, the ""referee"" actually allows the punching to continue for a bit longer before he calls the fight off. Is this ""no-rules"" fighting? Not entirely, one guy bites his way to victory yet others are told not to choke or groin grab, yet it is as real a fighting DVD as it gets.

There's the almost inescapable shadenfreude for the all-talk guys who are only good at talking thrash. One guy talks on and on about how ruthless a fighter he is (""I'll bite"") and when he is bitten himself he cries uncle immediately. At the end of every fight a bimbo in a dominatrix suit comments half-witted, tired cliches about the fights. This DVD epitomizes tacky and base.

In spite of that, in my opinion, this is a must for martial artists interested in confronting real aggressors and who've become too accustomed to complacent dojo techniques. A good tool to reference and adapt your game to in the -hopefully- unlikely case you're involved in a street fight. It showcases, realistically, the old but true assumptions of real combat: How character and aggressiveness (""killer instinct"") most often define the outcome, how BADLY most people actually fight, the myth of the ""professional street fighter"" (only one guy -the ""biter""- seems to know his way through a fight... by biting; a totally legitimate technique in the streets), how short most fights are and how cardio often trumps muscle if a fighter can take a punch (it may be three minutes or less but you got to have stamina!). These are things most martial artists know but seeing them happen drives the point home.

Ironically, the one ""uplifting"" (for lack of a better word) thing to watch was neo-nazis and Latin kids actually shake hands and respectfully congratulate each other after a fight; a feeling most fighters can identify with. Building better community relations through fighting? That's probably a stretch, but I had never seen a white supremacist and a gang banger hugging.

If you study the reality of street combat, this is the worst video you should probably watch.",1206748800,2,2335,4.815461346633416
8059531,5,B0009EST14,"This DVD was great. The only problem was it was too short,only about 10 fights. Some good Skinhead fights, the broad is kinda cute but you just wanna smack her. I reccomend buying it",1139788800,4,182,4.382352941176471

8059533,2,B0009EST14,"This fight video wasn't as good as what i heard. Its a bunch of skin heads getting beat down, I think thats the only good thing about the video(thats the reason for 2 stars). Also there's this nasty WT female on there walking around naked. This DVD is not worth buying!!",1133568000,,270,4.313725490196078
