8425786,5,B004DOTKCS,"I recently realized that some of my favorite tv shows from the past are out on DVD. I loved this show. Never understood why it cancelled after three seasons. I've come to realize that some shows are better from a memory/nostalgia perspective, BUT, this show is not one of them.

My Two Dads is so good. Greg Evigan and Paul Riser are a brilliant combination. I have laughed up a storm watching these. Not to mention, the writing is so creative. If you are looking for lots of laughs, you won't be disappointed. I LOVE THIS SHOW! I hope they put the 3rd season on DVD soon. I would love to see it in reruns on one of the nostalgia stations.

I now have this in my collection and can watch this anytime I want. I will be watching this over and over again.",1383782400,,753,4.222222222222222
8425787,3,B004DOTKCS,"I was and still am a big fan of ""My Two Dads"".  I had great writers and great actors, making for a great show.  Being a big fan I purchased Season One and Season Two on DVD.  I am hopefully awaiting for the remaining seasons to be released.  I was hoping that ""You Can Count On Me"" would have some episodes from the later seasons, that were not on the first two seasons.  No such luck.  However, it was very cheap so it is no big loss.  If you like the show, and don't own the first two seasons, it a good DVD.  Go ahead and  buy it, as it contains some real good episodes. However, for a huge fan of the show, that already owns the first two seasons, it is just not worth it, even at the cheap price/",1369785600,4,701,3.9148936170212765
