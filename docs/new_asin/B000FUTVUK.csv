2590328,5,B000FUTVUK,"I think everyone who said this movie was awful was wrong.  This movie is SUPERB for a mini series.  Also for a Hallmark movie this movie had AWESOME special effects, a great cast, and even included a great deal of comedy.  I actually prefer the longer movies, and if you don't like them then DON'T buy them!!  It's fun getting lost in these fantasy worlds, and I really enjoy the genre of The Mummy meets Indiana Jones!!  For 7.99 I highly recommend this movie, it was worth the buy.",1183852800,19,483,4.382022471910112

2590331,3,B000FUTVUK,"This was originally a Hallmark channel mini-series and it's not that bad,but it was broken up over two nights and played well in that format. If you watch it like that , with a break in between , you might be better off than watching it in one setting. Watching the whole three hours at one time really shows the hole in the plot and wares on the nerves. A special mention needs to be made about the fact that some of the F/X's are not kid friendly , even though this is a T.V. mini-series.

2590333,3,B000FUTVUK,"Hallmark Entertainment produced this film for television as a two part miniseries, thereby it sometimes is a little too long, but once the action kicks in, it's one of those cheesy B movie actioners with pretty good special effects.

Casper van Dien, as usual, is heroic and tries to infuse a Harrison Fordish style of action hero, but doesn't quite have the charisma Ford had.  The plot centers on the discovery of King Tut's tomb and the missing fourth of a tablet that will release evil demons imprisoned by Tut himself thousands of years before.  Malcolm McDowell shows up as the head of the Hellfire Counsel, a group of businessmen who want the tablet to rule the world whereas chief baddie Jonathan Hyde wants the tablet to recall the evil demon Set(sp?).  The movie is your usual comic book style adventure with improbable events and corny dialogue but it's fun in its own expected way.",1155859200,37,893,4.741935483870968
2590334,4,B000FUTVUK,A fun experience.  As a mini-series it has choppy breaks where commercials are meant to be placed.  Fun for the entire family (if the young kids are not bothered by some images to effect thier dreams).,1155600000,4,201,4.555555555555555
2590335,4,B000FUTVUK,"This movie is bad in that yummy, did-that-just-happen way that guarantees a good time and alot of laughs. I loved it.

There's solid acting here, in a cheesy kind of way. Casper Van Dien gives it his all. His all isn't much, granted, but he has heart. The main villain...sorry, pal, forgot your name...emotes with all he's got. Our heroine has an accent that comes and goes but, b'gum, she's trying her best. And, in a movie like this, her best is good enough.

Malcolm McDowell? He mostly sits around a table and acts grumpy. Does a grumpilicious job of it, though.

There are huge plot holes in the storyline, sure. What plot there is appears to have been...um, borrowed...from THE MUMMY (the recent one, not the b&w one) with MUMMY-ish music to match. The special effects are B-level all the way -- but perfect, PERFECT, for this kind of movie. To my surprise, the flick showed some decent production values and I was never bored.

For a few bucks, you get almost three hours of cheesefest that I absolutely recommend.",1155513600,37,1021,4.624309392265193

2590351,2,B000FUTVUK,"Damn this thing is long! VERY long!
WAY too long for the amount of material, and subject to the most bizarre ""editing""...and I use that term loosely. (Did they use a lawn-mower?)
The first half seems okay, but from about half way through it then just consists of a series of short, self contained scenes linked together in NO PARTICULAR order by a blacked out screen. There's little to no effort at all to preserve continuity of narrative or tension.
Its as if a series of different units each made a little bit like a class project and then those efforts were all just arbitrarily tacked together.
This results in some very strange changes of mood and interruptions to what has just preceded.

Its all shot entirely in India...(and it shows!), the architecture and locations never looking anything at all like ""Egypt"", and full of hundreds of Punjabi extras who look nothing like Egyptians.

The lead actors(?) are mostly new faces, although the astute will notice Simon Callow and Malcolm McDowell in minor roles that I'm sure they are now quite embarrassed about.

Everybody tries very hard with what they are given, but this time its the stock characters that are all VERY familiar in this genre.
There's the Indiana Jones bloke of course complete with THE hat and the outfit, .....together the intelligent female archaeologist....(you can tell she's really bright because they have her wearing glasses!), and of course a secret society of stock villainous types who want to rule the world by using the black magical powers held by an emerald tablet that has, (naturally) been broken into four parts that must be found and re-united to summon a demon, right?
You can no doubt see where this is going...
Everybody chews the scenery for all it's worth, mugging shamelessly. There are gratuitous nude scenes for the good-looking male lead, and the leading lady affects such a bizarre and hitherto unknown accent that half the time she's almost impossible to understand, but happily she falls out of it often enough to allow you to follow the plot....such as it is!
And sure theres the usual sexual tension between the two of them. Did you ever imagine that would be left out?

The special effects here are okay for the most part, ....with the emphasis on ""okay"". Nothing really great but serviceable enough for a cheapie.

Those familiar with the REAL Egypt may be surprised to see that the Valley of the Kings seems to have once been right next to the Pyramids of Giza, and Tut's tomb looks nothing like the real thing either! (If that's what anyone was expecting.)
And its discovered...well blown open with the aid of dynamite in fact way before Howard Carter gets there too. (So much for the careful archaeological excavation and conservation of artefacts!)

That famous mask is found not in the sarcophagus on Tuts mummified body, but OUTSIDE the tomb buried in the sand for some unfathomable reason, and although a few King Tut repro-artifacts have been borrowed from somewhere, the interior of the tomb is just pure Neo-Egyptoid hokum.

Everybody of no importance dies, and most horribly .....but in one of the strangest plot developments, ....all the goodies are somehow magically restored to life at the end, and know nothing of their painful demise earlier on!
The villains don't seem to have been resurrected though for some unknown reason.

Quite ridiculous in concept and execution, its not bad enough to be in the so-bad-its-good enjoyable category; nor quite campy enough to qualify on that account either.
Just.....well, just bad really!
And even if you can be amused at its inept clich deliveries and stock plot, it overstays its welcome FAR too long to keep your interest.
Yes theres a climactic battle between good and evil...as if you didn't see THAT coming?
But the demon is dispatched relatively easily, and peace is magically restored to the Punjab,......sorry, make that Egypt.

Now I freely admit I will watch just about  anything even vaguely Ancient Egyptian, but if you have any interest at all in Egypt, my advice here would be to re-watch Joan Collins in purple make-up and orange lipstick vamping it up in Land of the Pharaohs rather than sit through this Indian Indiana Jones wannabee.",1446508800,,4217,4.885314685314685

2590386,1,B000FUTVUK,"As soon as this movie started I realized that it was just trash about demons and has nothing to do with the actual story of The Curse of King Tut's Tomb. I turned it off and put it back in the box. I only paid 3.33 for it and it's worth nothing.  I'll take it to the Half Price Book store and sell it for maybe 25cents and it's not even worth that.  Buyer Beware, this is not the movie I've always known as The Curse of King Tut's Tomb. I should have paid more attention when I ordered it.",1369008000,,489,3.88
2590387,2,B000FUTVUK,"I purchased The Curse of King Tut's Tomb DVD as a gift for my wife who is a big fan of movies like The Mummy, The Mummy Returns and The Scorpion King.  We watched The Curse and sadly it is nothing like the popular Mummy series.  The Curse of King Tut's Tomb stars Casper Van Dien, Jonathan Hyde and beautiful Leonor Varela.  The stars made me think this would be a movie worth watching.

Van Dien plays archaeologist Danny Fremont searching for King Tut's Emerald Tablet that allegedly holds the power to control the world.  Hyde plays Van Dien's nemesis archaeologist Morgan Sinclair, a member of a secret society who wants the tablet to harness unspeakable evil.  Van Dien is helped in his quest by Varela as Egyptologist Dr. Barakat.  I will not spoil the ending for those who decide to watch this film.  The dialogue was extended and dragged out to fill up time.  I guess they needed to avoid expensive action scenes or scenes requiring special effects.  Talk is cheap!  The cast appears to walk back and forth through the same two sets over and over and over like a Hanna Barbera cartoon background.  My wife and I found ourselves fast-forwarding to get to the end.  We tossed this movie in a our pile of DVD's to give away.

I believe this could have been much better if it had a bigger budget with real action and improved script, because the plot is generally good.  Maybe it'll be re-made into a better film in the future.  As it is now, this film is a 2 - compared to The Mummy, which is a 10.",1368316800,,1503,4.391304347826087
2590388,1,B000FUTVUK,The DVD does not meet the usual high standards of documentaries other DVDs give on such an important topic. It was disappointing.

2590389,1,B000FUTVUK,"Mini Series?  The other versions of this aren't called a mini series.  If it actually was a mini-series on some channel it's good that it ended after 170 minutes, because this is 170 minutes of pure misery!.

I don't mind watching a B movie here or there, but WHO IN THE WORLD WANTS TO WATCH ALMOST 3 HOURS OF CRAP??!!!  This movie would have been much easier to tolerate if it were 1 1/2 hours or less, like a typical B movie.

I couldn't make it through this movie; I had to escape from hell.  The plot is repetitive to much better movies, the acting is OK at best and once again, it's WAY TOO LONG!

Don't trust this review?  Look at how many reviews there are as compared to a well liked movie.  Very few reviews means BAD.",1341878400,2,727,4.172661870503597
2590390,2,B000FUTVUK,"I almost decided to keep this one. I like Egyptian stuff. The acting is good, the sfx are passable, and the music is tasty. However, the whole film feels like it's been borrowed. The plot hobbles along on hokey devices just to keep the story going. Danny ""just happens"" to know which Frenchman has the map, ""just happens"" to know the card game will get down to just the two of them, and ""just happens"" to know the Frenchman will offer up the map when he runs out of money. This mini series is basically a string of coincidences. Too bad, really, it could have been good with better plotting. Jonathan Hyde makes such a great bad guy. Why he only ends up in second-rate films I can't understand. Oh yeah, and parents beware. Scenes of torture and demon possession are splattered throughout the film.",1316131200,,798,4.510344827586207
2590391,3,B000FUTVUK,"King Tut was not who we thought he was, according to this miniseries.  He was a super duper gold winged guardian of goodness for all mankind....or, something like that.  It lost a little in the translation.  At any rate, he flew!
Meanwhile, eons later, another super duper hero appears to champion the cause of goodness....or, something like that.  Casper Van Dien, as Professor Danny Freemont, is the only one who stands between us and the abyss of darkness that looms large, thanks in part to an EVIL group known as The Hellfire Council!  Poor Danny Freemont (I loved how they had to use his full name all the time, like it was a brand name), is hardworking but bested at every turn by an old geezer, Professor Sinclair (Jonathan Hyde).  Danny Freemont might be young, handsome, and enthusiastic but he's no match for the EVIL Professor Sinclair, who dispatches people left and right, sometimes in full view of witnesses!
Yeah, this was your typical race against time to find the 4th piece of an ancient emerald doodad type of flick.  Said doodad has great POWERS!  And it's pretty.  The Hellfire Council thinks it's their ticket to worldwide domination but the EVIL Professor Sinclair knows better.  Danny Freemont doesn't know a damn thing but he keeps trying because he's plucky.  Oh yeah, there's also a soothsayer whose premonitions look like a bad LSD trip.
That pretty much sums up the plot.  Plus....there's a lot of digging perfectly round holes, time for gambling, a ton of phony treasure maps, a spy, Danny Freemont's reputation is ruined, and there's a real snarky doctor of something or other (Leonor Varela).  There's also CGI winged monsters that may or may not be real, depending on the POV.
Casper plays Danny Freemont like he's a used car salesman....HAVE I GOT A DEAL FOR YOU!  As an actor, Casper is functional, he gets the job done but he's not memorable.  Jonathan Hyde, as the truly EVIL Professor Sinclair, looks like he missed an open casting call for The Matrix.  His performance as the villain probably kept his Shakespearian colleagues in stitches.  He sneered a lot.  He sneers well.  But there needs to be more to villainy than bugging out your eyes and sneering.  As for poor Malcolm McDowell, who has not aged well, he sits a fine seat and would be great for ads about constipation.  Not a happy face.
As adventure films go, this one went on for a very long time before it got to its Oz-like ending.  The climactic battle sequence lasted about two blinks.  Best part of the experience, the dynamite guy with little patience for those who can't make up their minds.  I know just how he felt.

2590408,3,B000FUTVUK,"I expect some unifying theme in a double feature but when I ordered this none was apparent.  Now I see that these are a pair HallMark mini-series. Each is a two part minseries with both parts included here.  They were made by the same production company.  As I wateched them I noticed the points intended as commercial breaks.  This often is the case with movies intended for TV but these films actually suffered fromthe lack of the commercials.  The continuty shifted so very abruptly that an intervening commercial might have softened the blow.  There are different editors and directors listed so the production company seemed to lend a heavy hand in the overall look of the films.  Another unifying theme is that both films deal with actual historic events and neither film valued historic accuracy.  There are two blu-ray discs in this set, one for each film in case this is important to someone.

Blackbeard was very predictable.  Viewing the first 10 minutes I knew what the last 10 minutes would bring.  This really dragged on in places.  The ships looked vey authentic but I'm no expert.  The sea-going photography was actually quite good.  Angus MacFadyen was hamming it up a bit, but not to the point of comedy.  I would object to his performance in a great movie but here he providing something fun to watch.  Stacy Keach was sleep walking through his minor role. I forgive him... he probably fell asleep reading the script.  Richard Chamberlain was trying but he didn't have much to work with.  Still I like both of these actors and it was good to see them again.  This movie really should have been edited down into a shorter DVD movie.

The Curse of King Tut's Tomb was certainly not so predictable.  In fact, it was a little bizarre.  Casper Van Dien plays a archaeologist.  I will be very charitable and say that this character was influenced by Indiana Jones.  He has to save the world from the Hell Fire Club and their CGI demons. He enlists the aid of King Tut who is trapped in another dimension.  Or something like that.

Both movies seem to have had adequate budgets...  these are not quick and dirty TV movies.  They do not fit together very well. I find this double feature to be an odd couple.  I think that two costume dramas or two horror fantasies might find a larger audience.  But I think these double features are a good deal.  My blu-ray collection is a little top heavy with the horror genre.  So I didn't mind getting one movie in this set that lies outside my usual area of interest.

+ Great effects for a TV movie/miniseries.

+ Good enough story

- Sometimes campy, clunky dialogue
- No depth to the cliche evil council
- Sometimes unbelievable character motivations, actions (female archaeologist screws over entire dig team of their shares/pay by persuading local military into taking over site. Soon after the same workers are totally cool with her)
- Hallmark tried too hard to make Casper look like Indiana Jones, each piece of costume, from the hat to the man-purse. Classroom instruction. Whip.

2590426,4,B000FUTVUK,"Directed by Russell Mulcahy, The Curse of King Tut's Tomb tells the story of Danny Freemont who searches for the tomb of King Tut and the four pieces of an ancient tablet rumored to possess great occult powers. His academic rival, Morgan Sinclair, has stolen three of those four pieces from him on behalf of the Hellfire Council(a secret group of men who pan to use the tablets for world domination). What neither side realizes is that once the pieces have been rejoined, the tablet will open the portal to hell, unleashing the demons of the underworld and eventually releasing King Tut as well bringing ultimate chaos to the world. The movie stars Casper Van Dien, Leonor Varela, Jonathan Hyde, Steven Waddington, and Malcolm McDowell.

In my honest opinion of the movie, it is an entertaining fantasy movie that combines elements of The Mummy and Indiana Jones in a(as others have mentioned) 'cheesy B-movie' kind of way. If I had any gripes with the movie, it would be that it was abit slow in some areas of the movie. The fact that it was such a chessy B-movie was what made it so fun for me to watch. Sure, there are historical inaccuracies everywhere in this movie but who cares? Movies are meant to be fun to watch and this one achieves that quite well. I've seen worser movies in my time, some that were downright horrible. It makes me wonder why everyone is ragging on this movie so much. It isn't that bad, folks. Going into it, you can tell that this isn't a direct remake to Boris Karloff's movie. If it were, things would be played more seriously.

Despite everyone else's feelings on the movie, I liked it myself. Would I spend full price for this movie just to have it? No but not for the reasons you'd expect. How about if it were in a reasonably priced movie bin? Definitely.

If I had any advice or recommendations, I'd say rent before you buy  and make up your own mind.",1226880000,6,1889,4.514619883040936
2590427,3,B000FUTVUK,"This is one of those movies made to entice children and ease the minds of the parents. It has a known scary plot, scary premise, scary special effects (although they don't come into play until the last 30 minutes) and no bad language or gory scenes. All the makings of a child's scary movie. Except for the fact that it clocks in at 4 hours! I don't know many children with the patience to sit that long.
If this were intended for adults, I would have given it one star. For children, I would chop away and refine the plot to about 1.5 hours. The special effects would have been greatly improved for adults, as well as making the plot make more sense.
However... for kids I think it's fine except for the length.
It does drag in spots. And the ending just doesn't fit no matter how much they dress it up with special effects.
The acting, sets and background music are definitely grade B and that's ok... that's what was intended. But as a grade B it won't have a life beyond the first viewing because it's too long, too dry.
Most classic grade B's are much shorter, more entertaining and memorable and get really campy at times to increase the entertainment value. This doesn't fit there.
So... If you have children who can sit still for 4 hours, or watch a movie in increments, this is for you. Otherwise I'd pass it up for the Brendan Frasier 'Mummy' movies.",1226880000,2,1360,4.400793650793651
2590428,4,B000FUTVUK,Hallmark produced this movie for television. It is set just prior to the historical discovery of King Tut's tomb. The movie is a mixture of Indiana Jones and pulp fiction. It has a slow start but really gets going during the second half. Overall this is a movie worth watching.,1226275200,2,277,4.56
2590429,3,B000FUTVUK,"With all the finesse and depth of an after school movie we are treated to an Indiana Jones knock-off.

Long before the Egyptian dynasties, the world was in a struggle between good and evil.  A jade plaque that when assembled lets them there evil critters in from another world.

Archeologist/teacher Danny Freemont (Casper Van Dien) is in the process of finding the plaque quadrants from the far corners of the earth.

Morgan Sinclair (Jonathan Hyde) competing archeologist/teacher and member of that popular cabal ""Hell Fire"" is in the process of pilfering jade plaque pieces from never learning and unsuspecting Danny Freemont.

Now here comes the Hallmark part. Danny loves Dr. Azelia Barakat (Leonor Varela), who loves Government Official Yunan Heikal (Parvin Dabas) who is in love with Egypt. Will anyone get together?

Will the bad guys finally win or is this just another save the world at the last minute movie?

This is supposed to be Egypt however, it is filmed in India. Strangely, enough all the Egyptians look Indian.
This animal even looks fuzzy in Blu-ray.

2590430,3,B000FUTVUK,"Curse of Tut starts out rather follish  gets better then kind is fades again. I must say that the special effects and scenery is excepitional and worth the three hours viewing. Malcomb McDowell & Jonathan Hyde give this movie a big boost. They play he parts to the fullest& meanest. Unfortunately thats were it stops. Casper wants so much too be Harrison Ford, but comes up on the short end. Really short! Everyone else cuold be replaced and never missed. But again,its worth it just for a visual experience and something to watch with older grand kids.",1207353600,4,553,4.701030927835052

8126847,1,B000FUTVUK,"A square jaw and decent torso do not make a good actor. Not being familiar with Mr. Van Dien, I cannot compare him to his other roles, so I have to go with his performance here.  Granted the material he's working with is terrible. To be a good parody, there has to be some comedy and there is none. The other characters don't add anything to mix. Standard bad guys doing their standard jobs. I didn't watch the whole movie. Does Malcomb McD ever get out of his chair.

I agree with other reviewers that the special effects were fine. The demons were great. As far as real excavation of a site, the job here is terrible. If you've going to sift thru sand/dirt you don't shift over the area you just took the dirt out of. That just puts the same dirt right back where you got it. The Egyptian relics are nice but you can find them in any Hollywood store room.

All in all, the story and characters are nothing unusual, Because I didn't watch the whole movie the end might have been unexpected. To get to the end, though, there has to be enough interest created to warrant watching the whole program. I'm afraid I lost interest 10 minutes in and hung on for as long as I could.",1525824000,,1174,4.255605381165919

This item is three incredibly bad rip-offs of actual movies.

Never ending cacophony of cliches.  The only original content is giggle-worthy.  The Indiana Jones rip-off opens with a winged, flying Tutankhamen.

All actors are forced to speak in poorly executed accents.  An egyptologist's attempt to sound Egyptian only succeeds at a poor imitation of Salma Hayek.

Not worth a rent, and certainly not worth a purchase.",1481328000,,654,7.1
