Closet thing I can say to what it reminded me of was the ending of Kingdom of Heaven! The Zhao army is en route to conquer some large city or province, can't recall, and has to first take over a smaller city that stands it it's way. The majority of the movie is the army besieging the smaller city! I enjoy those ancient warfare flicks so this was right up my alley!",1261094400,3,476,4.074468085106383

The exaggerated way the king walks funny on every scene he's in so as to tell the audience ""look kids he's evil and tyrannical!"" The shoehorned-in romance?

The poorly-explained Mohism ideology which makes it look like Ge Li is a Chinese hippy? The completely non-existent and dry ""rivalry"" between Ge Li and the main enemy general?

This was different, technically it was done very well.  Good cinematography very good acting, for me though the story just ran on and on and everybody dies.  At the end I just didn't understand it.

However its based on Chinese history. The main character is a Mozi - a follower of Mo Di, an actual philosopher and leader from the Warring States period. His school centered their beliefs on universal brotherly love.  Instead of just proselytizing  the Moists suited their deeds to their words. Their armies defended weaker city-states against unjust invasions by others in a policy of militant pacifism that might be unique in history.

The greatest surprise to me was when the opposing Generals sat down to play a game of Go.  I wish they had spent more time on the game itself than just using it as a plot point but it was still extremely cool to see it there.

To sum up, as good as this movie was the only part I really enjoyed was the Go game.  Again this seemed like more of a love story to me than an action movie.",1397001600,,1119,4.436274509803922

3904410,4,B002C6VMIY,"This is a war film that tends to focus on the strategy side of things rather than big battles. It's based on a Japanese manga series. Andy Lau stars as a Mozi warrior who attempts to bring leadership in the buffer state city of Liang. They lie in the path of a massive Zhao army.

The directing and story telling keep you engrossed, and the characters are likable. The camera work is good, and the action sequences are well filmed. It was also not too extreme on the violence. It's noticable that there was a lower budget, but they didn't fail to get the most out of it. With a good amount of anti-war message in the film, you get an idea for Mohist beliefs. The score was done by Kenji Kawai also responsible for the 'Seven Swords' score.

3904411,5,B002C6VMIY,"This is easily the worst titled movie of any I have seen. I bought it in order to be mildly entertained by a silly plot and some action scenes. Instead, I found an excellently written, excellently directed movie with fine actors and a thought provoking plot. It flirts with historical accuracy, in that it portrays the actions of a follower of a Chinese philosopher , Mo Di or Mo Tzu, who is little known in the West. In part this is because his arguments against offensive warfare and his political thoughts have generally been met with disfavor by both the Chinese communists and the Nationalists. The philosophy of Mo Tzu and his followers is in sharp contrast to Confucianism and Daoism, and offers some interesting comments about topics in today's world.

The movie portrays the hero's knowledge of defensive tactics and manages to insert a love story as well. There are action scenes, but it really isn't about action. It is a statement about war. If you are looking for continuous action with little or no dialogue, skip this movie. If, on the other hand, you want to learn more about classical Chinese culture, buy it and keep it. It really is a gem.",1377993600,3,1158,4.676470588235294

3904416,3,B002C6VMIY,I've recently got hooked on watching foreign epics/martial/war films and have to say out of all the ones I have watched so far this film was a little lack luster.  The battle scenes seemed poor quality like something was missing when I compare it to movies like Redcliff or Three Kingdoms.  As far as plot goes it is pretty well done but in my opinion The Warlords does everything this movie tries to do but better.  Overall I give this movie 3/5 and out of similar genre movies would only recommend this movie if you are out of better movies to watch.,1359676800,,552,4.392156862745098

3904419,3,B002C6VMIY,Good movie.  Once again the Chinese show the side of war that most movies do not like - senseless and futile.,1354147200,,109,4.190476190476191
3904420,5,B002C6VMIY,"In Ancient China, war looms between two major kingdoms.  As the more aggressive of the two begins to sweep down toward its rival, a much smaller kingdom stands squarely in the path of the invading army.  With that army decided that it'll simply steamroll this smaller, weaker kingdom while it's at it, the small kingdom puts out a call for help, desperately hoping that someone - anyone - will come to its aid before it's pulverized.  And answering that call comes forth, not an army like hoped for, but a lone Mozi warrior (Ge Li, played by Andy Lau).  That's the setup for Battle Of The Warriors (Mandarin title - Mo Gong; also known internationally as ""A Battle Of Wits"").

This is based on actual events, as are quite a few of the big Chinese epics, but this one is apparantly a bit closer to what historians figure really happened than some.  Of course, going back this far it's hard to be certain about all the particulars, and there Is room in movies for artistic licence.  But, even without knowing as much about Asian history as I maybe should, it makes the movie all the more interesting knowing that the Mozi (also called Mohi - a dialect difference, I think) were for a time a real force in the ancient East.  They were basically this brotherhood of philosopher/warriors who would try and come to the aid of anyone in need, whether from bandits and criminals or from invading aggressors.  (I'm basing this primarily on the movie, although I have heard the name 'Mozi' elsewhere)  They would naturally be received well by the besieged party, but in addition to their stance against aggressors, there were other parts of their beliefs that got them in trouble with a lot of powerholders.  They believed in things like equality and 'universal love' and weren't big fans of the feudal system that has a ruler at the top of a land, then a small group of nobles, then citizens and finally a lot of peasants or even slaves.  So this wasn't received that well by some of the rulers, especially the more tyrannical ones who ruled over the less benevolent set-ups.  The central kingdom the lone warrior comes to aid is itself eager for Mozi assistance, but its rulers are disturbed by some of the Mozi creeds, and rather uncomfortable with the abrupt popularity of the Mozi among the general population of the kingdom.

Along the spectrum of the Asian historical epics, there are highly stlized ones with lots of fantasy flourishes and almost superhuman warriors (like the great&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Flying-Daggers/dp/B0007Q6VXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Flying Daggers</a>) and then there are ones where the combat is much more geared toward realism, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Warlords/dp/B003DVB7F0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Warlords</a>&nbsp;(also great).  Battle Of The Warriors is much closer to the latter, so there's no way that one lone warrior is going to stand against an entire invading army.  But that's not what Lau's character brings to the table.  Although a great fighter, what he really brings is a master's flair for tactics and longterm strategy, and the intention to train and lead an entire city in how to turn back a vastly more numerous force.

The movie really goes into all the strategy, the shifting alliances, the motivations - both honorable and dishonarable - of various characters (and sometimes both within the same character), and the large backdrop of different kingdoms's bids for power.  When it does get into the battles themselves, it certainly doesn't skimp there either.  Great production and visual imagery, in-depth plot, tremendous action sequences, and Lau's Ge Li character makes an ideal protagonist for this type of movie.  A must see for fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Cliff-International-Version-Part-I-Part-II/dp/B0030A6ICG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Cliff International Version - Part I & Part II</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Vengeance/dp/B008FIPRGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Vengeance</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-of-the-Arrows/dp/B006C1S1DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War of the Arrows</a>&nbsp;and the like.",1348963200,5,4365,5.778471138845553
3904421,2,B002C6VMIY,"Well, unfortunately this was a disappointment. It may be popular to folks that follow, mesmerized by Mr. Andy Lau, Hong Kong Superstar, but this movie was terribly terribly pieced together. I wonder whether the production crew/director was in such awe of Mr. Andy Lau, that they were afraid to tell him the truth.

I knew this was going to be a so-so movie with the opening scene, which even now I wonder what it was all about. IMHO, the opening scene should of drawn you into the picture and made you want to see more, not make you scratch your head as to what was that all about. Granted there are a few moments in the movie in some of the scene that were shot okay but for the most part, it was dark and dimmly lit, sort of far away and as if the director was limited to just one camera to shoot each scene of the movie. There was no real close up shots or switching angles from a second camera. There was no real development of the characters and the situations.

I laughed so hard as it was so predictable, when you watched Fan Bing Bing character, go from all covered up in a sort of over-sized for her, full military uniform outfit in the beginning of the movie to eventually the scene where she is trying to seduce Mr. Andy Lau, and she has progressively in the movie, less clothing attire and gets more prettier as she is then portrayed more feminine.

I'm a fan of big battlefield type movies, but this movie just doesn't make you feel like its a big army of men. Felt more like a low budget field of folks with the cinematography of far away. This was similar problem with the Ang Lee version of ""the Hulk"" (aka watching a movie from a distance...).

Overall the movie is like a big miss mosh of scenes that were shot and pieced together incoherently, it could of been done better and more intense. The title of the movie is ""Battle of the Warriors"" but which warriors?

The bonus portion shows interview with Mr. Andy Lau, and another was of the Director with clips of production etc. You know this film is in trouble where you see Mr. Andy Lau in the bonus portion, and you look at the expression of his face that even he was disappointed in the movie but his words need to speak otherwise. I'll go with the body language.

To top that off, here you have the Director also stating this was his first big production and that there were many accidents during production, folks getting hurt and even a fire on the set that he didn't expect the fire trucks to be out on another call? What does that tell you about the movie? These commentaries ran very long that I ended it before it finished. Next you hear Mr. Andy Lau explains that the director has a unique style of shooting movies, (i.e from beginning to end). IMHO that give you a clue that the director is inexperienced and it shows in this movie. Sorry, alot of folks rated this 4 or 5 stars, but for me its only 2 stars. There are much better battlefield movies out there...",1335571200,,2942,4.320652173913044

Anyway, I bought this DVD at a Pawn Shop for $2. What a great deal.

This is a great release by Dragon Dynasty. I have yet to have a problem with the fantastic company. I currently own about 4 of their DVD's. The Picture and sound quality of this DVD is top notch. Especially If upscaled to HD. The 5.1 mix has some pretty decent separation. Not only this, but the acting is also pretty good. There where a couple times where some of the actors where overacting a little bit...But this does not ruin the movie at all.

Also, I would like to say that this was NOT directed by the directer of Hero (2002). The directer of Hero was Yimou Zhang. The directer of this film was Jacob Cheung. I don't know what the DVD is talking bout when it says ""From The Action Directer of Hero"".  So, I think they lied to sell this film.

Mozi was a Warring States philosopher whose school influenced argumentation, science, and a few other things and because it taught universal brotherhood, unlike many of the other ""hundred schools"" of that time, completely disappeared.

One of the oddities of his philosophy was that his followers became masters of defensive warfare and would be dispatched to threatened cities and states.

This is the story of one such man.  It is one of the best films of the last several years because it has a good story and requires you to think about war.

If you find Kurosawa's epics too preachy, this is not the film for you.

This movie will refresh those tired of totally dull and totally superficial war stories that based their script on individual soldier histories that are somehow obligated to fight because they had nothing else productive to do somewhere else in the first place. Instead, you will see how straight and fair war morality collides against politics and selfishness.

3904439,4,B002C6VMIY,"A martial arts movie that is more battle epic than hand-to-hand combat, Battle of the Warriors takes place in China almost 2500 years ago. My Chinese history is a bit - er - dusty, but the movie does a great job of laying out the background. This is a wartorn time, and the city of Liang is about to be besieged by an army that has to steamroll through it to get to their real military target. Raw deal.

Enter Ge Li (the amazing Andy Lau), a Mozi that the slimy king of Liang has begged to come protect the city. How can one man defend a city against an army? With brains, strategy, and cunning psychology. While there are plenty of battles in this movie, the real core of Battle of the Warriors is the planning - the game of chess - that takes place between the invaders and Li as each side plots their next move or parries that of the opponent. I've never seen a war movie that is so much about the tactical planning of war, and it was fascinating. Of course this focus means the movie is a little slow at times, but I was never not interested. The battle scenes are really creative and the tactics devised by each side to attain their objectives are amazing. I even recognized tenets I remember reading in The Art of War surface in Ge Li and his adversaries' thinking, which was awesome!

In addition to masterful battle scenes, Battle of the Warriors also has tremendous cinematography, wonderful acting, and great costumes and sets. There's even a tragic love story thrown in. As affecting as the love story was, I'm glad they kept it at the subplot level. I generally find it a weakness when a martial arts film lets a love story get too front and center; this one is kept on the backburner where it belongs and it adds spice rather than getting in the way of what the movie is really about.

The main theme of the film is how war only creates more and deeper conflict, a sentiment Andy Lau's Li actually verbalizes in one of the final scenes. This theme is illustrated very effectively in the way different characters become mistrustful, turn on one another, and backstab or even destroy each other (sometimes unintentionally) as a result of the conflict they are trying to win. This theme is also given life by the fact that Ge Li is a Mohist/Mozi. Of course, this piece of the story will be a bit unclear for some viewers. For example, about half way through the movie a character accuses Ge Li of always talking about 'universal love'. Huh? The guy never said a word about it up to that point! As far as I recall, anyway.

This piece of the movie relies on a bit of historical backstory that is probably obvious to Chinese audiences. I had to look it up. The Mohists apparently were militant pacifists during this wartorn time. They were master strategists who defended people from large armies as a means of thwarting military ambitions, and there's some religious/philosophical underpinnings to their beliefs that are generally distasteful to anyone in a position of power. As such, to defend the city Li does not launch attacks. His work is all defensive, yet very much aimed at prevailing. In this case, the goal is outlasting an army that can't afford the effort and losses of a long siege. Li's defenses are cunning, powerful, and deadly enough to daunt even a battle-hardened army. In short, he's not the kind of pacifist who gets his way by sticking flowers in the barrels of guns. He's someone you do NOT want to be stuck attacking!

I enjoyed Battle of the Warriors, and I'd recommend it to martial arts buffs who are okay with no hand-to-hand combat epic flicks and will have some patience for the few times the plot demands it. And thanks to Dragon Dynasty for bringing another great martial arts movie to US audiences!",1291939200,21,3742,4.513274336283186

I have always been a fan of the epic battle movies from medieval times to the classic Asian battles like the one in this film. This film now called ""Battle of Warriors"" is one really good movie, it has all any one could want in a film. The epic battles and fights, romance, political thriller, and strong characters are all wrapped into one. The movie originally titled ""Battle of Wits"" is based on a novel of the same name, and a Manga series, which had been based on the novel. Starring the ever great Andy Lau and directed by Jacob Cheung this equals out to be one good flick.

In 370 B.C. China was in turmoil being split into seven nations and such, also known as China's Warring States Period. One of the smaller states is being attacked and that is Liang, The nation of Zhao is trying to invade them with an overwhelming amount of solider, classic outnumbered Alamo like story. Faced with this impossible task Liang decides to send for the help of a Mozi or Mohist [look em up]. Known for their defensive and tactical skills one man is sent and his name was Ge Li [Lau], at first the King of Liang is upset that only one man was sent but soon he realizes that this one man is more than worthy of the job.

Has the battle draws closer Ge Li not only is given full control of the military but he starts to win over the people. Of course in doing this he is only doing his job but the King starts to think otherwise. Someone gets in his ear and lets the King know that the people are putting all their faith into Ge Li, taking influence away from the King. What is a King to do when he is falsely lead to think one thing over the other, take action of course.

Andy Lau leads an excellent cast in this wonderful film with a great performance, not only does he make the man more than likable but he also makes you believe that this character can win a war. Fan Bingbing plays his romantic interest in the film and does a great job as well. Siu Ho Chin is great here as well as a general that takes Li's side over the King, the King of course is played wonderfully by Zhiwen Wang. Si Won Choi [also a Korean pop star] plays the King's son in this film and does a great job. Of course from the other side is the invading Zhao commander Xiang Yan-zhong played perfectly by Sung-kee Ahn. I love the chess match here in this film between his and Lau's characters, the meeting was a favorite moment of mine.

Director Jacob Cheung and DP Yoshitaka Sakamoto did a great job with this film as the camera keeps moving and the shots are excellent. The story is great and full of actual characters and the battles are fun as one would expect. As I am sure you can tell that I enjoyed this film, I always have. I always loved the film and then Dragon Dynasty released here in the states in a special edition, I love it even more. The making of feature is excellent and shows a lot of behind the scenes and as always the commentary from Bey Logan is really insightful.",1291766400,5,2982,4.224561403508772
3904441,4,B002C6VMIY,"Oddly, this movie was based on a Japanese graphic novel that bases its story on the ancient Chinese Zhou dynasty about 2300 years ago.  The author of the graphic novel apparently knows a lot of about ancient Chinese history because many reviewers and Chinese scholars think this novel is accurate in depicting the period in China.  So historically speaking, this movie is also historically accurate, for the most part.  A bit of background first.  When the Zhou dynasty was first established, the emperor wanted to thank those who contributed so much to the cause by awarding land to various generals and also to his own family members.  As time goes, these ""land lords"" became more and more independent and the land they ruled became ""states"".  They all had their own courts and armies.  So initial political struggle aimed to gain favors from the Emperor eventually became an arms race and then civil war, which lasted about 400 years.  During this time, various states fought each other and allied with others.  The alliance was broken and new ones formed.  The whole thing went on and on until one finally finished off all the others and became the ultimate ruler of all China.  This guy would be Shi Huang Di, the guy who built the Great Walls of China and gave China its name (his state was Chin).

At the time, the size of a state can range from Texas-like to city-states.  The size depends on the size of the land that was originally assigned to the land lord based on his contribution in the war that established the Zhou dynasty, as well as how successful the follow lords were in annexing lands.  At the beginning the dynasty, there were hundreds of states.  Eventually, most was annexed by powerful states.  At the end, there were only six left and they fought to become the one and only.  So the movie is actually depicting a period when the bigger states were still in the process of eating up all the small ones.  In the movie, the attacking army is from a state the size of California and the city depicted in the movie is the only property of the defending state.  So you can imagine why the defenders panic so much.

I like this movie because it is one of the few that actually shows wars as an intelligent event.  While most of the war movies we watch these days, namely Hollywood blockbusters, depict wars like a bunch of savages hacking each other to death, this movie shows how both sides form strategies and counter their opponents' strategies.  I also like it because this movie keeps the romance to the absolute minimum.",1290988800,4,2545,4.621380846325167
3904442,5,B002C6VMIY,"Excelente ! Desde todo punto de vista. La historia demuestra como el ser humano es desagradecido, envidioso, soberbio e imbecil ya desde el 370 D.C. (y antes tambien) por lo que no creo que cambiemos mas. Basada en una historia real, narra como una pacifica ciudad, que tiene la mala fortuna de quedar en el camino de una tropa invasora de 100.000 soldados que van a atacar a otro reino, piden ayuda a un clan vecino, al saber que van a ser atacados, como simple entrenamiento. Y, al igual que acostumbraban a hacer los espartanos, estos envian a un ejercito de un soldado (Andy Lau). Un elenco muy parejo, y las escenas de batallas con el despliegue y efectos acostumbrados. Basada en una manga japonesa, es altamente recomendable. Especialmente por la actuacion de Andy Lau, que vuelve a demostrar que es un referente a nivel mundial en este genero.",1276041600,3,851,4.718120805369128

All told, this is the best Asian historical drama/action motion picture I've seen since buying
A BATTLE OF WITS at Amazon in 2007; which was, surprisingly, the very same movie, only now re-titled, re-packaged, re-described and re-released with a new title<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-of-Wits/dp/B000W1V574/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle of Wits</a>. (Don't snicker, I've got a big collection)

I'm sure this is just a glitch in Amazon's otherwise perfect customer-orientation. Amazon ID's remakes; it makes good sense to make note of re-packaged/re-titled products rather than implying they're new and letting customers stumble into double-buys. I've saved a lot thanks to 'you purchased this' alerts on product pages. A similar service could apply.",1271894400,4,1049,6.432624113475177
3904444,4,B002C6VMIY,"this is a downright decent movie this is more about strategy then actual fighting, the relationships being the characters are easy to read and the story is quite enjoyable, without revealing too much it involves a stratgist and how he goes about helping out this fort, your find yourself drawn in by the fantastic camera work one of those rare gems if you will it has a nice combination of both action and drama not very fast paced but not slow either, considering this is more around the intellect of mozi and the application of his plans its pretty understandable a good plan times time to execute and it allows you to see the plan from start to finish and understand and appreciate the intellect of mozi",1269820800,2,706,4.566929133858268

3904446,5,B002C6VMIY,"I started watching this one expecting a historical military drama. 'Battle of the Warriors' delivered that beautifully. It centers on the mysterious stranger who arrives just as the city is about to be over-run, and rallies a defense against a marauding army tens of times their size - a trope that works as well in classical China as in the American Wild West. Starting there, it offers exciting battles, humble heroism, intrigue, and all the rest that makes for quality entertainment of this kind. All of that comes through in sets and costuming with historical credibility, even though I can't vouch for literal accuracy. This isn't in the ""flying swordsmen"" genre, but a brilliant one of its kind.

This movie's pleasant surprise comes its major premise, an actual bit of Chinese history that many Westerners might not know. The mysterious stranger is a Mozi - a follower of Mo Di, an actual philosopher and leader from the Warring States period. His school centered their beliefs on universal brotherly love, something  subversive in a Confucian society with rigid hierarchies of loyalty and affiliation. Rather than simply preach this doctrine, Moists fought for it. Their armies defended weaker city-states against unjust invasions by others in a policy of militant pacifism that might be unique in history. I know of no other movie that mentions Mo at all, so this one performs the worthwhile service of bringing this sage to Western attention.

If you want costume drama with plains darkened by swarming armies, with dramatic sieges and flaming attacks, with effete rulers undermining the commanders in the trenches, and with a near-subliminal hint of romantic interest, give this one a shot. But, while you're at it, remember that Mo was real even if this story's events weren't, and is well worth knowing.

3904447,4,B002C6VMIY,"I like some of the more recent warfare/martial arts foreign movies as much for the cinematography as I do for a good storyline. After all, it's nice to experience the imagery and action of a beautiful film to go along with processing the information of the story from the English subtitles. (Note: As a rule, I don't watch foreign movies with the English overdub turned on. I prefer to read the subtitles.) Movies that come to mind are Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon, House of Flying Daggers, Hero and The Warrior. This movie, Battle of the Warriors looked really good from the stills that I had seen and the story concept of countering a siege with wits and savvy appealed to me. In it's basic essence, thats what this movie is about, a kind of thinking-man's warfare from the point of view of both the beseiged and the invaders. Additionally, there are a few subplots involving 1) choosing to love, 2)  the high human cost of war and 3) the ignorance/arrogance of the ruling class.

And at the end of the movie, I was very pleased with the story, probably even more than the cinematography. Don't expect non-stop action as there are several interludes that deal with setting up the armies/defenses and the strategies involved.  Also, this movie isn't over-the-top in it's brutality, despite the eventual battle scenes. Overall, my opinion is that this is pretty solid movie and I would recommend it to intelligent audiences.",1262131200,57,1425,4.831967213114754
3904448,5,B002C6VMIY,"If you're into Oriental art flicks, I would recommend a DVD called ""Battle of the Warriers""
""Battle"" certainly ranks, in my opinion, right up there with ""Ran"" or any of Kurosawa's or Ichikawa's films. Although lacking Kurosawa's camera work, I would have mistaken it for his if it had been in black & white. It's made in Hong Kong but much more western in style (more Japanese??) than most of the stuff coming out of Hong Kong or Beijing.
The movie is in Chinese but subtitled in English.
The story takes place in China 2300 years ago & is about a city that is the way of a large advancing army. The Army must take the city in order to proceed. The city hasn't much in defense & asks a clan of defense specialists, the Mozi, for help. They send one little guy. This guy, Ge Li, puts a whole new spin on being an army of one. Not because he's a killer but because he's a professional, knows what he's doing, & understands all of the consequences. If we had this guy in Afganistan, the war would have been over long ago.
The story is taken from a video game. Probably the only good conversion of a video game to full blown movie I've ever seen. The first half is battle and the preparations for them. The 2nd half has as much action but gets pretty heavy into the philosophy of war as well. One of those ""Gotcha"" movies that makes ya stop & think later about what was said.
This movie is excellent at all levels and would be enjoyable for just about every one although the violence might be a bit much for the younger kids. But not overboard with the blood & guts as so many movies are these days.
I recommend this movie enough I'm gonna buy a copy & add it to my collect. Well worth a watch.",1261267200,50,1690,4.219135802469136
