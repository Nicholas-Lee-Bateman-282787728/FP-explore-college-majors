2102795,3,B0002KWSJ4,This DVD is good but the songs are played through way too fast and the tablature that comes with it is different from what they teach you in the DVD. It's kind of frustrating because you will learn something off of the tablature at your own pace and think to yourself that it doesn't sound quite right. Then when you play the DVD you realize that it sounds like that because it isn't right. You end up having to rewind the DVD and play it back to yourself over and over and it's difficult to fidget with the DVD remote controll and play your guitar at the same time or go back and forth. You'll suddenly need to drop the remote to play guitar and then be able to grab the remote and hit pause and rewind at the drop of a hat too.,1200528000,9,729,4.069444444444445
2102796,5,B0002KWSJ4,"Happy Traum is a wonderful guitar teacher via DVD.  In his well produced and easy to follow  DVDs, you get personal, in depth, and talented instruction for just about every aspect of the guitar, often in split screen.

This DVD is no exception.  If you wish to learn the blues on the acoustic guitar, the purpose of this DVD is not simply to teach you the songs of the great Mississippi John Hurt, but to help you develop your own style.  It is very exciting to learn the song, but Happy pushes the student to develop a style unique to the student, allowing the student to have subtle changes...these changes will end up showing up in other songs as they become part of the students 'bag of tricks'.

If you know some fingerpicking and some blues, you are ready to dive in and learn the songs.  This DVD is for the Intermediate player, rather than the beginner.  Be prepared to push the pause button, practice, practice, practice, and then go back.  As the weeks go by, you will be very pleased with your progress.

If you do not know fingerpicking, and alternate bass, don't despair!  Or, if you are a beginner, you can still  learn the songs of John Hurt, but do it right by first building a solid guitar foundation from which to work off of:

If you are just a beginner learning to play the guitar, see ""The Acoustic Guitar Method"" by David Hamburger (2 part DVD that takes you through learning your first chords (DVD1) to learning some fingerpickig songs (DVD2).

But, if you already play chords, but do not know fingerpicking:  start with ""Easy Steps to Guitar Fingerpicking"" Volume 1 (you'll be hooked and end up getting vol 2 as well.)

  Next, if you are not familiar with acoustic blues, get ""Easy Steps to Acoustic Blues"" volumes 1 and 2.  Volume 1 of ""Acoustic blues"" is very simple (beginner) but fun and should not be by-passed if you are past the beginner stage on the guitar.  By the end of the DVD, you have gone past beginner.  ""Easy Steps to Guitar Fingerpicking"" on just one DVD will provide weeks/months of guitar lessons, if you practice properly, carefully, with the eye on the prize of building a solid foudation.  After completing these two ""courses"" of study, you are ready for the songs of John Hurt.  (note that in the recommended DVDs by Happy Traum, you will be learning some of these songs, but not in such detail, so it is a very nice way to getting used to playing fingerpicking style while learning the songs).

Songs: ""Spike Driver's Blues,"" ""Got The Blues (Can''t Be Satisfied),"" ""Coffee Blues,"" ""Richland Woman Blues,"" ""My Creole Belle,"" ""Monday Morning Blues,"" ""I'm Satisfied,"" ""Stack O''Lee,"" ""Candy Man,"" ""Avalon Blues"" and ""Make Me A Pallet on Your Floor.""

It is also helpful to pick up the CDs of these songs....Taj Mahal has recorded ""Candy Man"" and his own version of ""Stack O Lee"" along with other greats (Bob Dylan, Happy Traum, etc).

Having John Sebastian along in the DVD is a lot of fun.  His DVD on teaching the songs of the Lovin' Spoonful is a must, as John's warm, humorous personality comes across (even in his DVD on blues harmonica!).

Homespun has put out some really great material for the guitar student.  This old style of blues guitar will never go out of fashion---it is a lot of fun to play.  See also Roy Book Binder's DVDs ""Blues by the Book"" and Happy Traum's ""Bag of Blues"" as solid recommendations to learning and enjoying acoustic blues.

Set up an entire Library of Homespun DVDs for your lessons.  You could easily map out  a strategy for a year's worth of lessons on just a few DVDs.  You can focus in upon one particular area, (like the blues) or branch out learning flatpicking, blues, bluegrass, and so on.  You can even learn Holiday classics from the DVD ""teachers"" at Homespun.",1180310400,13,3756,4.588588588588588
2102797,4,B0002KWSJ4,"This is not a note-for-note transcription of John Hurt's songs.  Rather, Sebastian and Traum try to convey the feel of Hurt's style as they have come to interpret it.  Not to say that they've changed the songs much -- they will get you very close, and then the finer details can be picked up by listening to the records.  Also it becomes quite easy to figure out songs not included in the DVD once you have gotten the hang of it.

It's worth mentioning that they do not teach you how to fingerpick, so it would be helpful to have a little experience with that style. (don't worry -- the only ""fingerpicking"" song I knew before the DVD was Paul McCartney's much simpler ""Blackbird,"" and I was able to pick up the basics of John Hurt in a few weeks.) The songs are nonetheless difficult to master, especially if you plan on sometimes singing along with them, as everyone should.

Finally, the conversation between Traum and Sebastian and the interview with Sam Hood are warm and fascinating.  4 stars because they could have included more of John's songs and definitely could have discussed more about his life in Greenwich Village.",1130630400,18,1130,4.625

8028759,4,B0002KWSJ4,"I am having so much fun with this.  It's probably not for beginners.  Even with the enclosed guitar tablature, I probably would have given up --  picking it out one string/one note at a time (like reading War and Peace before you've got the alphabet down --  if not for the accompanying translation into standard music notation --- I can hear the tune in my head and know where my fingers are supposed to be -- and why.  That notation is my Rosetta stone to the excellent instructions on the DVD and the tablature on the sheet.  I may have been too ambitious in attempting to twist and stretch my short little fingers into those Yoga asana chords (yes, I feel it!)  But I've only been practicing a couple of days, and things can only get better.  (Unless I strain something hah-ha )

On behalf of all us musicians who are a little out of shape on the guitar, thank you, thank you, John and Happy, for a transcription I can READ!",1458691200,,928,4.348837209302325

8028761,5,B0002KWSJ4,"Happy Traum and John Sebastian combine in this great DVD to teach the fingerpicking style of Mississippi John Hurt, the father of our blues tradition. Both of them are warm, knowledgeable, and great at teaching fingerpicking blues. Thanks to them!",1391644800,,247,5.2

8028763,5,B0002KWSJ4,"It was fun learning from two very important people in the music world. i like the formate layed back, easy to follow but very informitive. I enjoyed hearing the stories of knowing John Hurt . Really injoyed this dvd.",1358208000,,216,4.564102564102564
8028764,5,B0002KWSJ4,"I'll start out by saying that this DVD is not for a beginning guitar player, but it is a good place to start for the beginning picker -- someone who has just gotten the grasp of playing an alternating bass with the thumb.

As Traum and Sebastian say over and over in the DVD (and it is apparent if you've listened to much John Hurt at all), Mississippi John Hurt did not play these tunes the same each time he played them. He didn't play the verses or choruses the same within a performance and the songs weren't the same from performance to performance. So, while you could try to make a ""note-for-note"" transcription, it would be accurate only for a single performance and you'd have to transcribe each and every verse and chorus because of the variations.

The transcriptions are accurate to what is played on the DVD and what is taught is a good representation of what Hurt plays on the recordings. Some variations are given so that you can understand what ideas he used and what ideas could be applied -- I think the teachers did a good job of not leaving too much out and not becoming too pedantic. When Traum and Sebastian are getting away from the original Hurt riffs, they tell you. It is much more in the spirit of this type of music to learn some ideas, create some of your own, and improvise on these ideas as you play the songs. This is where the magic comes in.

More songs? Maybe it would've been nice, but with the limitations of the media it is quite understandable that there aren't more, and with Hurt using a lot of the same riffs/patterns in different songs, it could become redundant. Some bonus transcriptions might have been nice and a sequel could be okay if it included more biographical info and more detail on Hurt's methods. But what is on this DVD is gold  and for a beginning picker that wants to learn a Piedmont blues repertoire, this is a great place to start.",1280793600,5,1894,4.433908045977011
8028765,5,B0002KWSJ4,"As simple as Hurt's style may seem (it's not flashy, but not as hard as say, Rev. Davis), it's really not all that easy.  This DVD, along with Hurt's recordings (if you get one, get the 1928 sessions.  ""Complete Recordings"" is good along with any Vanguard recordings) will help you recreate the signature sound of Mississippi John Hurt.
Also, I found watching him play Lonesome Valley and Spike Drivers Blues on YouTube recordings w/Pete Seeger are quite helpful in getting his flavor (watch the right hand and how he uses each finger to strike certain notes---it's the essence of his three-finger style---the thumb is pretty self-evidient).  If you're really into this stuff, get more info and support the Mississippi John Hurt museum ([...]).
It still takes a lot work, but it's also fun if you get go with it, take your time, and get in the swing of it. Note-for-note isn't so improtant as creating that wonderful bounce.",1265673600,3,924,4.8354430379746836
8028766,3,B0002KWSJ4,"The only thing you really learn from this DVD is how to read tablature.  Happy Traum and John Sebastian are excellent fingerpickers and give you some very helpful pointers on how to play the songs of Mississippi John Hurt, but that is about it.  The versions they teach are close to what Mississippi John Hurt played, but not the exact versions.  This DVD would be good for someone who already knows how to play these songs and need some more tips and tricks to further their skills.  If you want a more note for note lesson, John Miller's Mississippi John Hurt DVDs are a better place to start.",1247961600,2,595,4.481481481481482
8028767,5,B0002KWSJ4,"Love the fingerstyle Delta blues...and John Hurt is my favorite.  A must for fingerstyle fans...some tunes are tough on me, but love the way the guys break it down...sometimes they give you two ways to play the tunes...

Nice work and a wonderful DVD.",1231804800,,251,4.681818181818182
