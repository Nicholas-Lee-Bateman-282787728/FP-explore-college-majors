8295533,4,B001DZCZOU,It's adorable. Great product. Shipped when it was supposed to.,1434412800,,62,5.3
8295534,5,B001DZCZOU,"I have no idea if my 10-month-old son will actually pick up French from this, but it holds his attention and it's been a great refresher for me. I took French in high school and college and spoke it fairly well when I visited in '99. I hope to take the kiddo there someday, and with any luck, we'll both be able to get around.",1415750400,,326,4.030769230769231
8295535,1,B001DZCZOU,I speak French I thought it would be a good idea to teach my baby some basics French before I move to France. This DVD does not worth it don't care it it cost $12 less or more point is it doesn't suit the age mean beginners.,1361318400,,224,3.7872340425531914
8295536,5,B001DZCZOU,"Got it for my brother and sister-in-law as part of their French themed baby shower gift.  Don't know if they've started using it yet, but it served my purpose well!",1358640000,,164,4.466666666666667
8295537,2,B001DZCZOU,"As a native speaker, I expected this DVD to feature a French voice. The female voice in the DVD is certainly NOT the voice of a native speaker. Her pronunciation and overall accent simply do not sound good. In that case how can anyone expect their kids to pronounce properly? It would be like using a French accent to teach english. As for the content, it does not look professional, almost as if it had been shot with a personal camera then edited on iMovies. Definitely not worth the price, I don't recommend buying this product.",1325980800,14,531,4.541666666666667
8295538,5,B001DZCZOU,"This reminds me so much of all those Baby Einstein. It's like baby crack, it's so entertaining. My son sits down and watches the whole things. What's even better is that I hear him using French from time to time so some of it is sticking. Really a great starter.",1309219200,,262,4.26
8295539,5,B001DZCZOU,this is wonderful...a great way to show a good start of a language to a child. i actually play it for my 7 month old and he loves it!,1295222400,,133,3.6206896551724137
