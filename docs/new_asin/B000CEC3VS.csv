2459974,5,B000CEC3VS,"This is a great dramatic historical series that covers a Cossack community on the Don River as it lives through the tumultuous times of WW1 and the Russian Revolution and post revolutionary era. It has a bit of something for everyone including battle scenes, romance, history, and wonderful costuming and scenery. You really get immersed in the times and culure of these people by watching this series.",1286496000,6,402,5.014925373134329
2459975,5,B000CEC3VS,"I did not think it would be possible to make Mikhail Sholokhov's great novel into a movie, but I was very wrong. The movie is very moving and outstandingly deep. It is an absolutely engrossing production with wonderful acting and production values. I recommend this film without reservation, It is one of the finest films of the Soviet era.",1239840000,29,340,4.779661016949152
2459976,4,B000CEC3VS,"A digital remastering of the 1957 epic film, with English subtitles. The original international release of the film cut it to just over 100 minutes. This is the full director's cut: 330 minutes. As rich and multi-storied as the novel, this is the Russian Gone with the Wind, a tale of love and civil war, pride and deceit. Filmed on location, it has an authentic feel and many memorable scenes. A must see.

2459978,5,B000CEC3VS,I  first saw this 3 part  epic film  when I was  kid and never forgot it. The  film was made in 1958 not  1960 as listed by Amazon.  This film was  stunningly restored in Russia  a few years ago and the  Russian import from Rusico  is the  version to buy. It  has  subtitles in 13  languages as well as  discs of  extras.,1404086400,3,321,3.9193548387096775
2459979,4,B000CEC3VS,Great to watch. It helps if you understand the Russian language. The Movie is very entertaining .I will keep it in my movie library.,1391904000,,132,4.541666666666667
2459980,5,B000CEC3VS,Brillant film in a splendid DVD boxset. Quiet Flows the Don was based on a heart-throbbing epic story and this Russian classic won't dissapoint any of the fans fro the novel.,1367971200,,174,4.645161290322581
2459981,4,B000CEC3VS,A good rendering of Sholokov's epic novel. Very even-handed in depicting the Russian Revolution and civil war. No propaganda here.,1362096000,2,130,5.55
2459982,5,B000CEC3VS,"While the ideology has restrictions, the beauty does not have. It was a real privilege for me to see this film. It is a work of art, the spectator is moving continuously in a table of painting, where the painter changes places and angles of view. Masterpiece, landmark of the moving picture. It re-defines the word ""lyricism"" in the cinema.
Of course the aesthetics is subjective affair and I speak for my personal impression.
As per the story? Greatly improves the comprehension of book, for those of us who had read the book. Extents the limits of imagination which the book generates to the reader.
Result? We have many things to learn studiing the old Soviet cinema, today that finished the cold war.",1359849600,3,704,4.7317073170731705
2459983,5,B000CEC3VS,"""Quiet Flows the Don"" (""The Quiet Don"") is a three-part film (from 1957 and 1958) based on the novel of the same name by Mikhail Sholokhov (who won 1965 Nobel Prize for Literature). The novel was originally translated in two parts: ""The Quiet Don"" and ""The Don Flows Home to the Sea."" This restored version of the film runs approximately 5.5 hours.

There are four DVDs in this set with one DVD for each of the three parts and one DVD for the ""bonus"" material. The film follows the lives of Cossacks living in a small village near the Don River during part of World War I and the Russian Revolution. The film is mostly realistic, although sprinkled with moments of exaggeration. The movie was shot on location and looks entirely authentic. The acting, cinematography, art direction, production values, and action sequences are excellent. The World War I scenes are realistic and chilling. The scenes of brutality, murder, and execution as Red and White clash during the civil war are quite disturbing. Watching the Soviet propaganda in this film gave me a flashback to days of yore. This is a great movie.

This DVD set has excellent English subtitles. The film also has subtitles in many other languages (including French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Dutch, and more). Each DVD also has English audio tracks (in other words, you may select to turn on English dubbing). I hate the English dubbing: it is as if emotionless narrators (instead of voice actors) are merely reading the script, without any effort to synchronize with lip movements. In sharp contrast, when you listen to the original Russian soundtrack, you gain a whole new dimension in understanding the characters and plot (since the actors' voices convey great emotion). I highly recommend watching this movie with the original Russian audio with the appropriate subtitle selected.",1339632000,18,1866,5.016129032258065
2459984,5,B000CEC3VS,"Having read the book some years ago, I finally got around to seeing the film over the course of three nights. It's rather long, and episodically paced like a miniseries rather than the epic feature films we're use to. Still, I enjoyed it immensely. It's difficult to pinpoint why. At first, the acting plays rather broadly, with the leads seeming a bit too old for the roles they're  playing. Eventually you come to accept them as the characters they were meant to be. There are many twists and turns to the story. It doesn't have a mighty climax; it just ends. But when it's over, it's quite satisfying in its own way. What's amazing is that the book was published, and the film was allowed to be made in the first place. The added featurettes are interesting and do an excellent job of putting the entire project into perspective. If you like the film, you should definitely watch the short film commentaries. I recommend it for viewers who have an interest in Slavic history in general and Russian ""Kino"" in particular. It's also evident that the sections of the film were used as templates for sections of Warren Beatty's REDS. All in all, a fine choice for discerning viewers with an interest in the subject matter.",1291075200,10,1220,4.648148148148148
2459985,4,B000CEC3VS,"As I had read the books; 'And quiet flows the Don' and 'The Don flows home to the Sea' , I was keen to buy this attempt at filming both of them. It does the job well enough, though suffers from the usual 'Russian problem' of over dramatic acting, occasionally launching into slapstick. As a fan of Russian Cinema, and owner of many Russian films,I feelthat it is always this aspect that lets them down. Even transferred to the most recent productions from Russia, this need for larger than life characters, boisterous fight scenes, and lots of shouting, often takes away from excellent cinematography and serious issues. There are some standout films that do not fall into this trap, namely 'Come and See', and the superb 'Burnt by the Sun'. However, if you are a fan of films portraying recent history, the Russian revolution and civil war, then this is well worth buying, if you can live with the dated feel, and what seems to be a straight transfer from VHS..",1290124800,4,962,4.631578947368421
2459986,5,B000CEC3VS,"Excellent movie based on the famous novel of Russia,filmed on the land of Russia with spectacular scenes. Four DVD of this very good movie with a low price.",1287878400,7,156,4.607142857142857
8098058,3,B000CEC3VS,"This isn't actually a review; it's just the only way I can find to ask a question about the movie. I've started watching the version available through Prime and it has an English soundtrack overlaid atop the Russian one. Is there a version available anywhere that has English subtitles but not an English soundtrack (or allows one to disable the English soundtrack)? One of my objects in watching this is to work on my Russian language studies, and I can't do that if I can't hear the Russian clearly because it's obscured by English.

One reviewer said it helped him in learning Russian, which makes me think there must be such an English-free version available somewhere...

Thank you.",1511136000,,687,4.813559322033898
8098059,5,B000CEC3VS,"A Russian Classic. Starts slow in Part 1 and is a little hard to follow at 1st, but if you keep with it you will be rewarded. And, if you get a chance read the book, 4 volumes, explains why movie is so long - but one of the great books of 20thCentury.",1503964800,,251,3.7547169811320753

It shows the strife between the Red and White Armies during the Russian Revolution. The acting is sometimes comical and overly dramatic but this movie was made in the 50s.",1418083200,2,331,4.442622950819672
