7816258,5,6301882520,"This powerful tape programs both the conscious and the subconscious mind with new beliefs. Beliefs generate thoughts and emotions, which in turn create experiences. Change those beliefs and you change your life. Dick Sutphen instructs medical professionals in how to use these safe, powerful reprogramming techniques. The video generates an eyes-open dreamy state of consciousness in which you are receptive to properly phrased suggestions. Two kinds of hypnosis (verbal and visual) are combined with two kinds of subliminal programming (suggestions flashed on the screen and embedded into the background music). This incredible four-way combination makes this video the most powerful self-programming video in the world! Animation effects will turn you inward, generatiing an eyes-open alpha level. Your mind will be open to the acceptance of suggestion. At this inward alpha level, suggestions are 25 to 100 times more effective--and they are accepted by your subconscious mind as new beliefs. You will also receive post-hypnotic key words for conditioned response. Your mind becomes more limber and agile every day. Your learning abilities and performance increase every day. There is no limit to what your mind can do. Every day, you realize more of your brain's potential. You now think more clearly and creatively. You breathe deeply and exercise regularly. You remain physically relaxed and emotionally at ease. You eat a healthy diet and sleep soundly at night. ""Boost brainpower"" are your key words for conditioned response.",1136678400,2,1533,5.527659574468085
