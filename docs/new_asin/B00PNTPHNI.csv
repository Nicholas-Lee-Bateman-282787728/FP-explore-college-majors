Besides not being very accessible to those outside of Calvinism, and using many of the man-blaming themes that you'd find in worldly women's magazines, many of the experts interviewed have a really pollyanna attitude about marital difficulties and the benefits thereof, as if we still live in the days prior to no-fault divorce.  While it may be true that the challenges of being married can* foster maturity and wisdom, that works for an argument for people getting married as young as possible if and only if marriage is not easily dissolved.  The likelihood and ease of divorce  especially within these Protestant denominations  is something that the message in the film seems to turn a blind eye to; the young people who are the target of this message, on the other hand, are not turning a blind eye to it.  That better explains the delay of marriage than do things like selfishness and laziness.  Especially for men, when it comes to having the onus of sweeping women off their feet and into marriage placed on them, and then being held responsible for the marriage staying together, that responsibility has to be balanced with some ability and authority to make it happen; if you consider the fact that some 70% of divorces are brought by the woman, it's easy for young men to see that they aren't exactly in the driver's seat.

It also doesn't dig deep enough into the reasons why there are so many approach barriers between men and women.  They do touch on the problem of the man not approaching until he gets and indicator of interest, and the woman not giving an indicator of interest until he approaches (or talks to her father, which I'll bet is a rarity in any community), but the simple solution that men should just suck it up and risk rejection is not only easier said than done, but again, it doesn't try hard enough to answer the question as to where these obscene psychological barriers come from.  Time would be better spent digging into that root problem.

Another thing that we see in the film is a fairly explicit refusal of support for those who are called to singleness.  Granted, this may be the dogma of the interviewees' denomination(s), but in any case, they don't seem to leave much of any room for the possibility of living as a devoted single.  They also make quite a jump in how they come to this conclusion: one of them cites Genesis, saying that ""It is not good that [the]** man be alone"", and another will address the passages in 1Cor 7 as being more applicable to people of a different time and situation.  Maybe this is just me, but cherry-picking passages from the Old Testament (especially the creation account) and suggesting that they are more applicable to Christian life than Paul's letters seems like a stretch.

The film does make a few good points about some of the ridiculous reasons for avoiding or delaying marriage and the flawed logic behind them, as well as a lack of support and guidance from a person's parents and elders.  I can see that their concern is also in the right place when it comes to the importance of reproduction and the transmission of culture via a stable family unit.  They know there is a problem, and that we are headed for bad things if we don't right it, but I think they need to dig deeper into what's causing all of this, and then go back to the drawing board on how to respond to it.

It's also worth mentioning that this documentary does have very good production quality.

*Marriage certainly does not guarantee maturity, nor does singleness guarantee immaturity.
**Most versions of the Bible that I have seen have ""the"" in there which, depending on interpretation, could be taken as a reference to Adam himself; but the interviewee omits this, which seems to suggest that it's applicable to men generally.",1466208000,,3909,4.68859649122807
8688905,4,B00PNTPHNI,"Family Vision Films has come out with their long awaited movie Unmarried : The Rise of Singleness. This is a fantastically important film that everyone in the church should watch. It brings forward a huge problem in the church. Brings it forward and hammers it home, again and again.
Everyone should watch this film. The entire church, from the most frenetic liberals to the most staid conservatives; from the wildest charismatics to the chilliest of the reformed. The issue raised is a vital one.
The problem this film brings forward is real. The Christian blogosphere exploded this month with two issues: Thomas Umstaddt rejecting courtship in favor of fifties style dating,[1] and Michael Farris [2] rejecting God the Father in favor of God the marriage counselor. Both of these rejections were, at their heart, rejections of the sufficiency of Scripture because of the fallacies of men.
Similar fallacies of men have produced the problems that this film brings forward. Make no mistake, both the liberal church (which hates marriage and children) and the conservative church (who are the ones being accused in the film) will and should hate this movie. It is an attack on values they hold dear, and a call away from their own worldly wisdom back to the crude, Earthy, unbelievably archaic answers of Scripture.
But this film fundamentally flawed. We cant stop with having merely spoken of the symptoms of a disease and ignore the cause of the disease. And the cause of this disease was evident in the very speakers of the film, and clearly spoken between the lines. The problem is the modern paths to marriage: dating but especially courtship.
Anyone that has read books on courtship could not help but notice that the sections of this movie could have been lifted whole cloth from a book on courtship: Financial Security, High expectations, College and Feminism, Immaturity, Called to Singleness, Soulmates, Content in Singleness, Waiting, Flirting, Desireable Qualities, Guidelines those are some of the sections of this film and Im willing to bet you can find these same sections, or stuff pretty close to them, in lots of courtship books.
The symptoms are clearly laid out in this movie: delayed and denied marriage, a generation of frustrated youth, a missing generation in the church. But the cause was ignored, or even promoted: the false and unBiblical systems of courtship and dating. The solution to the problems of courting and dating is not more and better courting, or more and better dating. Adding flirting to courting will not make it any more Biblical although, I admit, it might result in more marriages.
And the solution is not a return to dating. A return to ignoring Scripture even more completely, to literally promoting dozens of entertaining relationships between our young men and women, relationships that are sexual to their core and often sexual in their habitual practice. A return to issues of first base, second base, and home run. And, too, putting off marriage, sometimes forever, sometimes merely for years.
Hopefully this movie, by helping us examine the symptoms, will also help point to the cause, and to how we should fix it. When Christians see this movie they will, Lord willing, turn away from the worldly wisdom of some of the presenters, and the worldly wisdom of so many modern Christian authors and speakers, and turn back to Gods Wisdom, expressed in His book, the Bible. Who knows, it may even wake up people who have managed to stumble through the last twenty years not even noticing that the church faces an UnMarriage crisis!
May God bless those who see this film to go beyond the film and back to His Word.",1429660800,2,3661,4.93517017828201
