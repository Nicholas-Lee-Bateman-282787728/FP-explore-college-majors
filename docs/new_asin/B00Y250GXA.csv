8717428,5,B00Y250GXA,Outstanding crystal clear blu ray print/transfer. Nice little black and white adventure/noir. Perfect for a Saturday afternoon and a bowl of popcorn- if you like these 1950's movies like I do.,1533081600,,192,5.225806451612903
8717429,4,B00Y250GXA,Looking into Vic Morrow's projects fairly regularly now . I was most recently watching color episodes from the last season of the highly successful television program Combat ! . I was grabbed by the cover art and premise of a disgruntled guy threatening an industrial rocket fuel plant with destruction . The notion that he'd wire himself up as a human bomb seemed frightening as well . The action and film is well done with Morrow's character taking the plant manager's (Stephen McNally) wife and son hostage and causing all manner of concern and several deaths on route to his objective . Different environs and stuff that all add up to good viewing .,1518912000,2,653,4.7368421052631575
8717430,3,B00Y250GXA,Low budget thriller. Worth seeing for the beautiful Ms. Gray in her prime,1445212800,3,73,4.6923076923076925
8717431,4,B00Y250GXA,This is worthwhile because of great early work from  Vic Morrow as a psycho human bomber and Colleen Gray who really shines in her scenes with Morrow in the second half of the film. Only decreased rating to 4 because there is entirely too much use of stock footage that slows the pace and poorly matches Ernest Haller's great as usual cinematography and the barely listenable music score by Nicholas Carras.,1437177600,7,407,4.732394366197183
