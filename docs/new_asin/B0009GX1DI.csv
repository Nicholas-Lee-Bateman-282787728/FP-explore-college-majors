2289985,5,B0009GX1DI,Saw a write-up about this film in the back of my newspaper's weekend TV magazine.  So glad I ordered it.  No doubt one of the finest films I have ever seen or will ever see.  Film arrived in a timely manner and was in Just Like New condition.  Sorry for the delayed input of feedback.,1233964800,,284,4.109090909090909
2289986,5,B0009GX1DI,I started watching this movie on Lifetime & ended up taping it and finishing it later. I'm glad I did. I finished watching the movie on Jan. 16. I noticed from the tombstone shown in the movie;a day before what should have been another birthday for Lauren. This movie is beautiful and sad and inspirational. I watched it thinking it was a movie about a mother and her illness. It was only when she dropped her daughter off at high school and it showed the name of the school that my heart dropped. God Bless this strong beautiful family!,1200528000,,537,4.434343434343434
2289987,5,B0009GX1DI,"As well as Human Trafficking, Dawn Anna is a very well-done Lifetime movie, and its emotional gamut is both wide and varied.  From the beginning of this story, I was impressed to watch a strong, single mother of four manage to raise truly good and cooperative children while getting by with very little money as a school teacher.  Loved by both her own kids and students alike, this really is a case of bad things happening to good people.

The brain tumor seems so incredibly unfair, but I think that both the network of support and her own resiliency to recover paved the way for her to cope with the upcoming tragedy of losing her youngest daughter Lauren, a sweet, bright, and talented girl during the massacre of Columbine High back in 1999.

Dawn Anna and her kids are likable and admirable, proving that you don't have to be financially endowed to be rich.  Bravo, Lifetime, and it would be fantastic if you would give us more movies of this quality!",1151539200,2,957,4.573099415204679
2289988,5,B0009GX1DI,"Since the tragedy which happened on April 20, 1999, this film centers on Dawn Anna's personal struggle with brain cancer and then, the tragic death of her daughter from the Columbine  High School massacre. Taking place in Littleton, Colorado,  the film revolves around a tender relationship between mother and daughter. Then fate took over and changed everything. Fortunately the intense shootout was omitted due its incredible violence.  Beautifully acted by Debra Winger who mirrored Dawn Anna's incredible courage and then, facing the pain in the loss of her beloved daughter. Incredible acting resembling real-life events at and around Columbine is noted. Due to the disturbing contents of the film, it is not recommended for children under the age of 17. Other than that, It is a film well worth seeing; though you may need a box of kleenex handy.",1151452800,5,852,5.115107913669065
2289989,5,B0009GX1DI,This story struck close to home as I have lived in Denver for 28 years and all the storyline is a great memory in my heart. Everyone did an outstanding job bringing the life of this women and the courage she felt. I feel it would be an honor to know her. I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they are having a tough time and see how actually well they do have it.,1128816000,10,370,3.9466666666666668
2289990,5,B0009GX1DI,"Dawn Anna was a tear Jerker.  It brought a lot of things in to perspective as a parent.  The family over came a mother's illness to postively making sense of a sensless High School shooting.  You could feel the pain that they went through.  2 parents raising Children in this day and time is not easy! But it is even harder for a ""SINGLE PARENT"".  She showed that with love disclipline and determination that it can be done.  True stories are so much better than fiction.  If you have not watched this watch it with your children, Youth groups etc.  Talk to your children, Notice your children, take interest so we can stop the jonesboro and other High School and senless killings among teens.  Prayer, Love and disclipline is the key..... Wonderful movie.  I hope that a documentary or movie will be done soon to let us know how all the victims and surviors and their families are doing.",1120780800,11,888,4.528301886792453
2289991,5,B0009GX1DI,"Dawn Anna is one of the best made-for-television movies I have seen.  The movie centers around single-mom Dawn Anna, a subsitute teacher who struggles to support her family financially.  She finally lands a wonderful teaching job at a local school.  In order to make ends meet, she agrees to coach the girl's volleyball team as well (her two daughters played on Dawn's team at different periods of time).  Dawn meets ""Bink""-a nice gentlemen that she met at the school.  They date, and fall in love.  Dawn discovers she has a brain disorder, and with the support of her kids and Bink, she recovers as best as she can.  Although she will have lingering effects of the disorder, she continued to coach the volleyball team.  The end of the movie shifts it's focus slightly-to Dawn's youngest daughter, Lauren Townsend.  Lauren is now in high school, and is captain of the volleyball team.  She's a straight A student at the local high school.  I would tell you more, but I don't want to spoil the ending for you!",1119657600,12,1008,4.670454545454546

8060416,3,B0009GX1DI,"Debra Winger is great in all her movies and her acting talent is decided. The subject matter of this film is a bit uneven. It is hard to decide,if the action centers on a teacher's physical difficulties or loss,of,a loved one in the Columbine tragedy. This story could be two movies--a great physical struggle to get well and another that chronicles the beginning stages and final tragedy of the school shooting. Two stories here are like pieces from two different puzzles.",1488931200,,473,4.851851851851852
