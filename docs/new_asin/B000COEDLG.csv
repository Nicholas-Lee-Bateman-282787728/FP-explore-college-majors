2467590,4,B000COEDLG,"This DVD is well done.  We are a hearing family. My daughter is going for her certification in ASL and watched it with me.  She liked the way the woman in the DVD signed the carols.  It is not pure ASL; there are also Home signs thrown in there to make it fit with the music.  My younger daughters are learning ASL, but the songs in this DVD are too difficult for them.  I was hoping they could learn a few carols in Sign for Christmas.  I will keep it on hand, though.  Maybe they will be ready by next Christmas! I appreciated that the songs she chose were actual Christmas carols, and not just ""holiday"" music.  It was a little pricey for a 15 minute DVD, though, but there are not many DVD's around like this, so I think it was worth it.",1291420800,7,741,4.097222222222222

8099866,4,B000COEDLG,"Hayden Riley performed beautifully her interpretation of these Christmas songs done to music. This DVD features five popular carols plus We Wish You a Merry Christmas, and Ave Maria (sung by a trained vocalist in the background).  English subtitles are shown for all the songs.  There is a main menu to either ""Play All"" or select a particular song. The signing speed of the songs are often slow enough for beginners like me to follow along. This was produced and directed in 2005 by Tim Riley.  Running time is about 15 minutes.

I took off one star in the rating because there were a couple of glitches/scratches in the ""used--very good""-condition DVD/video I purchased.",1503705600,,672,4.868421052631579
8099867,5,B000COEDLG,This DVD was everything I expected and more. Beautifully signed by Ms Riley and brought the songs to life. The other bonus is the ability to see the songs signed in slow motion. Great tool for the beginning signer. I highly recommend it!,1483056000,,237,4.534883720930233
8099868,5,B000COEDLG,I can't wait to have this playing on a loop during the holidays. It is lovely to have playing in the background for the gorgeous music but also visually romantic. Turning off the sound to learn the movements is just as appealing to the viewer.,1478390400,,243,4.4222222222222225

8099872,5,B000COEDLG,This DVD has these great songs in slow motion as well as regular which makes it really easy to follow and learn. I will be ordering the rest of the set because of this!!,1392249600,5,169,4.0
8099873,5,B000COEDLG,"This DVD is fantastic, and has put me in the Christmas spirit even in April! Learning to sign watching Christmas Carols is a brilliant fun way to learn. I already bought Praising Spirit Vol. 1 & Vol. 2; and The Patriotic Spirit by the same producers & performer (who I absolutely love). This DVD is also charming, well produced, and everything I could ask for. The Christmas songs are performed lovingly and with grace, and slow enough to learn by watching and imitating. I don't need a manual to tell me how to move my hands, all I need to do is watch the DVD and see how it is done by the performer, and then imitate. Watching it over and over couldn't be more fun or easy. This is a must have DVD for every signing student. The sign language performer (Hayden Riley) is outstanding! I am so impressed, I am buying more DVDs to give as gifts, because even for those friends not interested in learning sign, it is a great Christmas Carols music DVD to play during the Christmas holidays.",1365120000,7,988,4.404371584699454
8099874,3,B000COEDLG,"I had assumed that the sign movements would be shown, not just done with the song; I'm not that advanced to learn just by them doing it; and, it's backwards when you're trying to learn it from watching the DVD.  I need instruction with it; and, I didn't review it before I ordered to see that there was no instructions.",1357084800,4,319,4.316666666666666
