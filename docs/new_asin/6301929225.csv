380951,4,6301929225,Good Movie and I hope that others enjoy this movie as well. I enjoy Amazon Prime very much it is a great service.,1396396800,3,113,3.9565217391304346
380952,1,6301929225,The acting is well really bad. Nichols' Cages brother should not try an act because that all the attempt was. Story line is just as bad.  If you like cheesy movies go for it it might be worth a laugh even though its not a comedy.,1392249600,,229,3.9782608695652173
380953,2,6301929225,Didn't expect it to be blockbuster. Was okay for B movie.  Acting wasn't superb. Will not recommend unless you are vampire fanatic.,1383523200,,131,4.954545454545454
380954,5,6301929225,if you like cheesey flicks this one is top notch the acting is pefect the lighting for each scene is what makes the movie and draculas widow comes off like nosferatu on crack,1382054400,2,174,4.303030303030303
380955,3,6301929225,it was interesting to see MRS. Dracula taking the lead this time I'm so glad they didn't do the Bram Stalker Dracula for the billonth time.,1373414400,,139,4.384615384615385
380956,5,6301929225,"Here is a great film in the Hammer Horror tradition that`s WELL DONE WITH GOOD TASTE!  Not just gory with no story or too much slash for my cash.  I`m sick of graphic slasher movies.  This one has blood and guts, but just enough camp and humor to let the audience know not to take it too seriously. Highly recommended in German or English on a great quality REGION 2 DVD transfer. The VHS (which I also have)doesn`t do it justice. A FEAST FOR SORE EYES!",1358121600,8,453,4.244186046511628
380957,5,6301929225,"In this cult vampire film Sylvia Kristel manages to be sexy in an unexplainable way. Wearing a non-revealing outfit she manages to pull off a dark, mysterious, hypnotic sensuality all her own. I guess the movie wasn't a hit because people were disappointed by a non-nude female vampire, and of course who would they expect to bare it all more than Sylvia? I personally like this film alot. There's lots of good scenes and not alot of slow moments like in those cheesy horror flicks. If you want to see an unusually sexy vampire with a vengeance you should buy this one!",1336780800,7,569,4.588235294117647
380958,1,6301929225,"This movie not only has a cover creepy enough to turn anybody off, but the movie plot line really sucks. This movie doesnt even deserve 1 star. Dracula's widow is really ugly also, which in old legends she was supposed to be beautiful. Dont waste your money on this peace of crap.",1085875200,,280,4.403846153846154
380959,5,6301929225,"A Hollywood Waxworks owner accidentally brings Dracula's Widow, Countess Vanessa (Sylvia Kristel), to Hollywood. Using his weak Vanessa makes him her slave and sets out to have herself returned to her husband the Count Dracula who she has a hard time understanding has been distroyed.  Countess Vanessa is hardly the beauty she is made out to be, unless you like that expressionist look. But she is truly vicious and totally amoral like a good vampire should be. Nothing concerns her but her own desires and she satisfies them with brutal effientcy. For example Van Hessian's ancestor appears and sets out to destroy her, so she goes to his place and turns him into another bloodsucker. This film has more gore then say most Hammer films but less then most slasher films. There is no nudity or lesbianism, more the pity. If you like your vampires truly evil and vicious this one is for you, no slopping around in sentimentality for the poor creatures of the night.",983491200,3,964,4.807228915662651
380994,3,6301929225,I want to give this 3-and-a-half stars because Sylvia Kristel is so mesmerizing in this movie. Just watching her makes this movie worth it!,1436832000,,139,4.833333333333333

380997,2,6301929225,"Not the greatest, and low budget.",1426723200,,33,4.666666666666667
380998,3,6301929225,"This would be just another B vampire flick if it wasn't for Sylvia Kristel's vicious portrayal of Dracula's wife who is accidentally sent to the US by mistake and is ripping up everyone she comes across as she is trying to get back to her beloved.  Then she discovers that he has been killed by the current Van Hesling's grandfather.  Not sexy like Emmanuelle and with no nudity, she doesn't walk around, she stalks with her fingers curled for action.  This was the way vampires use to be presented before they started to ""sparkle"".  A B flick, but worth a watch.",1416528000,,563,4.544554455445544
380999,1,6301929225,the digial didn't work right and never saw the movie,1414368000,,52,4.3
381000,2,6301929225,"I'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about.  Sylvia Kristel was neither sexy nor good in the part she played in this movie.  Granted, I knew it was a ""B"" movie when I decided to watch it, but it was a low ""B"" at that.  The effects were pretty bad and the story line non-existent.  I can see why Sylvia Kristel's movies have mainly consisted of softcore porn (e.g. the Emanuel movies) - that kinda sums up her acting ability in a nutshell (no pun intended).",1412726400,,465,4.310344827586207
381001,1,6301929225,Another crappy movie. I'm Tired of such a bad selection of movies.,1412121600,2,66,4.583333333333333

Don't waste either your time or money on this one. Simply pass it by!",1404259200,,94,4.277777777777778
381003,2,6301929225,"Really bad acting, no real story line.  Wouldn't even qualify as a grade ""B""...don't waste your time or money -- it was free to me through Prime, and I'm still sad.",1401235200,2,164,4.290322580645161
