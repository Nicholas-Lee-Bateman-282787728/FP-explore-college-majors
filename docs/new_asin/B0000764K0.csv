My son could barely finish watching it. The plot is too difficult for kids to follow and the great gadgets from the first film are gone. Do not waste your time or money on this one.",1047686400,3,358,3.986111111111111
1800917,5,B0000764K0,"With bold cartoon colors and gadgets and gizmos a plenty, this will keep the kids entertained for hours and hours as they play it over and over again. This time round Inspector Gadget is played by French Stewart - he's just perfect for this role - he's boldly cartoonish and so clumsy you just can't help but love him. His antics and gadget 'glitches' will make you laugh and the special effects really bring it to life. With everything from eye-popping spring loading gadgets to the return of the much loved wise-talking Gadgetmobile.
This one is especially for the kids - with a very welcomed 'G' rating - The DVD is packed with extras that even the Mum's and Dad's will enjoy, such as the bloopers and deleted scenes. I've already preorderd one for my niece's  birthday - she's 7 and a big fan of the Inspector Gadget cartoons. - I know this won't disappoint.",1047168000,10,862,4.561290322580645

1800920,5,B0000764K0,"The first Inspector Gadget movie was such a slap in the face to the good inspector that I shunned it's sequel from the day it came out untill just today.  After hearing that it was closer to the cartoon series I decided to check it out for myself.  I'm very glad I did.
Don't get me wrong, the movie's not perfect by any means. In fact I may have given it one star more than it deserves, but I'm greatly impressed that studio executives actually listened to fan's complaints about the first and did something about it. Nearly everything that hurt in the first movie has been adressed. French Stewart makes a better Gadget than Matt B. could ever hope to. Claw, while still not as menacing as his cartoon counterpart, at least keeps his face hidden and has Madcat constantly at his side. There's even a very nice MAD logo seen several times in the film! Penny and Brain help solve the case this time, and even the newly added G2 feels like she would have been at home in an episode of the original series.
There are some isues here, though. The CGI looks pretty bad in spots, like hand drawn effects. Gadgetmobile returns, but with a smaller role than before, thankfully. Chief Quimby is still more anti Gadget than I'd like, but all in all it's clear this movie was made to give the fans what they wanted from a live action Inspector Gadget movie the first time around. You can probably get one here for pennys plus shipping, and you'll likely be glad you did.",1396828800,,1460,4.4237918215613385

Unlike ""The Lion King II: Simba's Pride"" and ""Beauty And The Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" (which at least brought back the original actors, but had less-than-impressive storylines), this film for some reason does not feature any of the actors from the first movie (with the exception of D.L. Hughley, who plays the Gadgetmobile) which is a really bad move on the studio's part. Great storyline, but should have brought back Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Michelle Trachtenberg, Joely Fisher (if she didn't want to come back, then kill her off), Dabney Coleman AND D.L. Hughley. I gotta admit though, I loved Elaine Hendrix as Gadget 2. Really solid work. SPOILER ALERT!!! Door is open for a third movie. SPOILER ALERT OVER!!!

D.L. Hughley is hilarious as the voice of the Gadgetmobile and the CGI special effects was cool and enjoyable to watch.

1800929,1,B0000764K0,"I have hit an all-time low.  I have rebooted my film lifestyle.  Prior to watching ""Inspector Gadget 2"", I was willing and absolutely able to watching anything that came through the system.  I was up for any low-budget feature, no matter what country of origin, I was up for good, the bad, and the ugly, AND I was even up for those direct-to-home features that make nearly every cineophile shudder.  This was my life, up until about a week ago.  I found myself trudging through both ""Inspector Gadget"" as well as the cartoon voiced by Don Adams, and the direct-to-Disney sequel, ""Inspector Gadget 2"".  It was after this viewing that I eliminated all the upcoming films in my list, opened a fresh page, and started from scratch.  I am going to begin (after I finish watching ""The Longest Yard"" remake and original) watching more classic, foreign, and contemporary independent films.  I want to bring the level of control back and impress those with more of a knowledge than whom was a better Inspector Gadget, Mathew Broderick or French Stewart - alas, friends, I do know the answer to that, and I am not proud enough to shout it on the highest mountain.  It is embarrassing that I have to nominate one ""Inspector Gadget"" film over the other, but a critics work is never done.  I have no favorite when it comes to this franchise, I have no favorite when it comes to stories that completely demolish the structure of the cartoon of which it is based.  In closing, I have no favorite at all when you have two films that are only connected by the titles they share.

""Inspector Gadget 2"" is possibly one of the worst sequels to dawn the direct-to-DVD call tag at the bottom of the box.  Using nothings from the original film (not the same characters, not the same style, not the same comic timing), this film is one that you have to watch alone, not standing right next to the original Broderick vehicle.  French Stewart (he is always squinting ... why?), with the aid of director Alex Zamm try to bring the original concept back the the series without any known budget.  Stewart brings a new Inspector to the film, a more arrogant, snobbish, seems to be tormented by life, protagonist that cares nothing for those surrounding him.  He is a character that we cannot love, no matter how many times we have to sit through one viewing of this film.  What is interesting about Stewart is that he is actually closer to the the animated Gadget than the original.  Zamm also tries to create a Dr. Claw that is closer to the original - but the trouble occurs with the fact that the two share very little screen time and thus there is no real chemistry between the two.  Claw used to always monitor Gadget's doings, in this one, there seems to be a haphazard care as to what either is doing.  Penny still doesn't have her book and Brain still isn't getting anyone out of trouble.  Where is the consistency here?  Too add to the mix, we are introduced to a new character ""G2"", the newest upgrade to the Gadget line.  Like anything this riddled with clich&eacute;s, there is an initial problem with the two of them, but eventually a spark misfires and Gadget is introduced to yet another love interest.  Considering the problems anatomically with this couple, there is no further spark between them.  The only reason the two are put in a this film are to be together, not for any other purpose.  There is no sense of individualism, just flimsy cause followed by an effect that could have been predicted before the opening credits ended.

""Inspector Gadget 2"" has not seen the best reviews, nor will it get a good one from me - it tried, but ultimately it failed.  There was no purpose to create this erroneous sequel.  Disney was hoping to cash in on the Broderick fan base, the younger generation that knows no better , or just to make some extra dollars to pad their bottom line, but there was no reason to resurrect this already problematic series.  I hated Elaine Hendrix's mesh between ""Robocop"" and ""Judge Dredd"".  She was funny at parts that were not meant to be funny, and chokingly bad at parts that were meant to draw sympathy from the audience.  Perhaps it was the writing, or the campy way that it was filmed, or the cheesy ploy to get audiences to laugh, but this sequel just left me out to dry.  If I had to speak positively about this film in any way, I would have to comment on the CGI which did improve a bit with this lower-budget film.  I thought the idea of ""freezing-time"" was a fun concept equal to what Claw would do, but again, we seemed to lack the spunk and originality of the cartoon.  I would never consider this franchise a remake of the cartoon, but instead their own unoriginal spin-off.

I blame Disney a bit for this film because cutting corners and cost is not an excuse for making poor films.  If Broderick or even the horrid Everett could not reprise their roles for this sequel, it should have just stopped there.  Don't push a circular peg into a square hole, but instead we continued to push and found cheap replacements for the original.  This is a very kid friendly moment that if I were 3, would probably find visually entertaining, but from a company that prides itself on making Oscar-worthy animation, I expect a higher level of distrobution.  French Stewart should stop working while he still is remembered for his humorous work on ""Third Rock from the Sun"", while the rest of this cast shouldn't even bother with another feature.  I think it is bad enough that they couldn't even get Cheri Oteri back, cause, you know, she's expensive.

Overall, I have to say that ""Inspector Gadget 2"" is a blunderment of a film, and the one star review that I am giving it is generous.  There is no need for these types of films to enter into mainstream cinema.  It dulls the senses for those hoping to find engrossing cinema out there, and proves that a mind isn't necessary to watch French in action.  As a cinematic community, we have to put a stop to this.  Zamm attempted to retain some of the originality of the cartoon, but couldn't compile a cast good enough to bring the humor, form, grace, and talent of the animated series to light.  There was no chemistry between anyone, and when the clich&eacute;s began to cause a horrid avalanche, I was caught with nowhere to hide.  As I attempt to think of another film that likens to how poor this film was, nothing comes to mind.  So, with that said, I have restarted.  You will see me soon reviewing better films where my mind can be used, instead of trash like this were jell-o sliding on a stick would be more entertaining.  If I had to end with a thought in mind, it would be this - Claw never showed his face, this can be learned from watching the pilot ""Inspector Gadget"" where he had a mustache, so you shouldn't be able to see his face in the films.  It is simple.  It would be like creating the Smurfs live-action where they were a shade of orange instead of blue.  You just don't do it.  So, when it comes to this film - just don't do it.  You will be happier, and no so bitter like myself.

1800930,4,B0000764K0,"I've seen both the first and second Inspector Gadget movies. I was (and still am) a huge fan of the Inspector Gadget cartoon show (one of my all time favorites, actually), so I was really looking forward to when the first one came out. I was sorely disappointed in it. I found this one to be better. Here are some of my reasons:

1. My favorite character from the cartoon is Penny. I'm glad to see she got more screen time in this movie than in the first one.

2. I found French Stewart's Gadget to be more of a bumbling doofus than Matthew Broderick. Stewart's Gadget, to me, was a lot more like the Gadget in the original cartoon.

3. The biggest mistake they made in the first one: Dr. Claw. You are NOT SUPPOSED TO SEE HIS FACE!!!!! Adding an actual claw for a hand is a nice touch, though. Also, in the first one, Rupert Everett was too young to play Claw. I don't know who played him in this one, but the voice was better as well. It was raspier than what Rupert Everett did in the first one.

All in all, I felt this movie was more like the cartoon than the first one. I'm not a fan of live action movies based on cartoons, but I found this to be a good remake.",1145404800,,1168,4.0873362445414845

1800932,1,B0000764K0,"A little known tidbit about the history of Philadelphia: Channel 48, once known under the call letters WKBS, liquidated their assets in 1983 due to increasing problems with their transmitter lease.  The station signed off on August 29 -- but not before going out with a bang.  Using the last of their resources, their final half-hour was used to broadcast the first episode of a never-before-seen cartoon, one that would serve to change, in it's own small way, the cultural landscape of America.
That cartoon was Inspector Gadget.  (Incidentally, a Google search of the program's airdates lists the earliest known broadcast of the series as September 5, 1983.  Channel 48 may not have bothered to log it's final program to the FCC -- but trust me, I was there.  They had it first.)
The continuing adventures of the bumbling cybernetic detective hold a special place in my heart because of this strange and fateful day.  Channel 48 was a beloved station -- for many of my school years they broadcast Pink Panther for two hours every day(!) as well as such wonderous cult 'toons as Tenessee Tuxedo.  It was a crushing blow to my young heart to bid farewell to that old, treasured friend, but their maverick decision to end with the very first broadcast of Gadget was an fond, fitting tribute.
I watched Gadget on Channel 17, who picked it up the following year, religiously.  Often I would rush home from school, determined not to miss the antics of the robotic constable, the case-cracking skills of his behind-the-scenes niece Penny and her dog Brain, and the sinister growl of the menacing Doctor Claw: ""I'LL GET YOU NEXT TIME, GADGET!""
So it was with a deep and abiding love that, when I spotted this film on the used DVD rack at my local record shop, I gladly forked over the twelve bucks to revisit my childhood one last time.
But instead, I ended up feeling like my inner child had been spanked and sent to bed without dinner.  Dear Lord, this movie is terrible.  Really, truly, terrible.  Not a single redeeming quality about it.  French Stewart may be the worst comedic actor known to humanity, accurately desribed by a friend of mine as ""Like Kramer from Seinfeld, except not funny"" -- I honestly think Carrot Top would have been a better choice, and I HATE Carrot Top.  And though Eliane Hendrix provides that safe Disney level of mildly enticing sex appeal, her patently robotic acting is only barely forgiven by the fact that, well, she's LITERALLY playing a robot.  And that incessantly unfunny car!  Can we please have a modern comedy which doesn't try to infect some form of satirically cliched, urbanized Chris Rock Lite stupidity into it?  Tupac is rolling over in his grave right now!
It's terrible.  Disney has once again ruined the beloved characters of literary history, as they did with Hercules, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, and the Little Mermaid.  Maybe I'm reaching a little there by putting Gadget in such notable, royal company, but if in my passion I take such liberties, I beg you all to forgive me my indulgence -- certainly it's not nearly as insulting as the liberty that Eisner and company have taken in turning our favorite stories into Technicolored tripe.",1087171200,6,3191,4.7709090909090905
1800933,3,B0000764K0,"A straight to video live-action movie based on a cartoon?  It sounds like a forgettable idea, but ""Inspector Gadget"" is actually masterful for its harmlessness - no gadgets or people were harmed in this flick.  Here, the glitch-ridden Gadget inexplicably manages to keep Riverton so safe, that he's got nothing to do.  With the evil Dr. Claw behind bars, Gadget is stuck pulling over speeders - including one who (of course) turns out to be Chief Quimby's mom.  When Claw escapes - leaving hints that he's got a big job planned - Gadget goes on the case.  Unfortunately, the Chief gives the job to Gadget's replacement - an all-woman, all-robot enforcer called ""G2"".  For Gadget, it's love at first scan, but G2 has no interest.  Gadget manages to only get in the way while Claw grows ever nearer to his goal of robbing the federal gold supply locked away in Riverton.
If it's not a laugh a minute, it's still fun for your kids, and it won't put you to sleep either.  The FX aren't quite cutting edge, but they're not horrible either.  In short, ""Gadget 2"" looks like it was more fun to make than to watch, but still fun to watch anyway.",1073174400,2,1137,4.534313725490196
1800934,4,B0000764K0,"Inspector Gadget is bored.  He's been so effective at fighting crime, there's no more crime for him to fight in the city of Riverton.  He's been so effective, that the police department is proud to unleash G2, a new, all robot upgrade in the form of a female detective.  While smitten with love at first sight, Gadget is crushed when G2 is assigned the case of the escaped Dr. Claw.  With Penny's prodding's, he conducts his own investigation, but his glitches keep ruining the day.  Will he keep his job?  Will anyone ever catch Dr. Claw?
With all new actors (except D. L. Hughley as the voice of the Gadetmobile), this movie feels completely different from the first live action movie.  On the plus side, they stuck more to the conventions of the cartoon series, such as hiding Dr. Claw's face.  However, this movie doesn't have the humor of the original, relying mostly on slapstick to get laughs.  While it works, adult fans of the original will be disappointed.  The villain's plan is one of the most original means of committing a crime, and I loved watching the results once I finally figured out what they were up to.
Kids were obviously the target audience of this film, and they'll love watching Gadget bumble into one mess after another.  Adults will be entertained as well, even if not to the extent that the first film led us to hope for.",1067817600,5,1351,4.5875
1800935,3,B0000764K0,"I saw this for the first time on the weekend, and while it's not really as bad as some would have you believe, it isn't that great, either.
To start with, it's hard to equate Matthew Broderick's Gadget, with the character played by French Stewart. Broderick put real life into Gadget, where Stewart played Gadget purely as a 2 dimensional cartoon character for 90% of the movie. The only time he came to life was near to the end, when Claw kidnapped Penny.
Just for the record, I thought that was a nice throw-back to the original cartoon. Penny was forever getting caught by MAD agents, though she was usually rescued by Brain, and not Gadget.
The emphasis on the glitches in Gadget's circuitry was a little confusing. In the cartoon, the so-called glitches were usually his gadgets doing the thinking for him. The Inspector was such a lame-brain (and I mean that in the fondest way) that he inevitably called on the wrong gadget for whatever situation he was in. So whenever a gadget popped out that was different to the one he called for, you could be fairly sure it was the right one to do the job.
In this movie, the glitches were just that - glitches.
And then, there's Claw. Rupert Everett did a fantastic job of playing Claw in the first film. It didn't matter that his face wasn't hidden, as was the case in the cartoon. It was pointless that they tried to do that in the second film. Aside from the shockingly awful voice, what they ended up with was an 'evil' version of Wilson from Home Improvement. It was just plain sad, given Everett's deliciously wicked performance in the original.
I'm not totally sure what to think of Elaine Hendrix's performance as G2. I suppose it was fine when you consider that she is basically supposed to be an emotionless android who slowly comes alive as the film progresses, but how can you feel anything for a character that is little more than a piece of wood for most of the movie? Like French Stewart's Gadget, she only came alive towards the end of the film, and by then it was too late.
There are positives to the movie. Unfortunately, there just aren't enough.
One is the fact that Penny is given considerably more importance in this movie. In the first, she was more of a sidekick than anything else, and that rankled the hardcore fans quite a bit.
The special effects were okay, but I'm afraid that's all I can say.
As an Aussie, it was interesting to see two Aussie actors hamming up the roles of Chief Quimby and the Mayor (Mark Mitchell and Sigrid Thornton, respectively), but even they didn't give the film much of a lift.
As another reviewer commented, one blessing was that the voice of the Gadgetmobile was the same. Unfortunately there just aren't enough other redeeming features to save what could have been a wonderful movie.",1064188800,2,2789,4.568862275449102
1800936,2,B0000764K0,"Another direct-to-video sequel to the original ""Inspector Gadget"" is exactly what you expect.  We have no Matthew Broderick, but French Stewart (imagine young Nathan Lane) as Inspector, and another one, a female version ""G2"" is added now.  The concept of police detective with cartoonish gadgets to solve the case is not changed, and the story is again as corny and non-existent as before, but that we don't care.
I liked the first one, but not this one.  One of the reasons is that in this sequel Inspector becomes the ""last-year's model"" which means here that he suffers humiliation because of many ""glitches.""  That is, when he says, ""Go go Gadget, Helicopter,"" something differnet appears from the top of his head.  And the film seems to believe that it can make us laugh.  We may if we are all very small kids.
To make matters worse, parents beware, some scenes are very annoying.  Just one example.  Somehow one famous fast-food compamy agreed with production placement, and at some party sequence this unlucky Inspector again and again experiences silly mulfunction (manupulated by the villain The Clow), and he sprinkles the fried potatoes all over the floor, and moreover, stomps on them spilling yellow mastard all over the place.  Now if that's your idea of funny, see this one.
In short, besides the conventional ideas you have seen in this kind of films such as Nancy Drew-like girl or fast-talking car, the film only offers the tired ideas of comedy that was used in the silent film era, like the Keystone Cops.  The difference is, THEY are funny.
The CGIs are suitably cartoon-like, I don't know whether its cheezy effects are intentional or not.  (I see the name of Stan Winston in the end credit.)  Some effects are certainly great, like the Matrix-like ""freeze"" shots, which is used in last year's ""Clockstoppers"" in which, by the way, the star of this film French Stewart can be seen.
Finally, G2, the female Gadget.  I don't know what they wanted to do with this idea, because what she does is nothing remarkable.  Actions are introduced, but badly shot with undoubtedly bad CGIs) and badly edited, killing any moments that could be interesting with her presence.
The film's ending suggests another sequel, which I politely decline to see.  So, what's next?  ""G3: Gadget Kids""?",1063411200,,2297,4.881443298969073

1800940,4,B0000764K0,"I like many was disappointed with this movie. First off French- I MEAN FREE Stewart is not the kind of actor who should play IG. Matt Broderick was a perfect fit, he gave energy to the role, Stewart acts like wood. So does Elaine Hendrix who is supposed to be the COOL Gadget, instead both her and Stewart slump into The Home Depot and slack off because they are bored. That's my ... joke for today. Anyway, the movie is slightly ..., but I found some good in it. It was funny at some parts, but another thing I didn't enjoy was that you never saw Claw's face in IG2, but in IG1, Rupert Everett played him magnificently without a flaw as Claw. But now the guy that plays him was taken out of the BAD ACTORS OF ALL TIME Hall of Fame, and we get stuck with a bad Claw. There were only two actors that played their parts good and that was Caitlin Wachs who played Penny and D.L. Hughley (THE ONLY RETURNING MEMBER FROM THE FIRST MOVIE) as the Gadgetmobile. But in other words, the movie is good at most areas and it is good for all audiences and should be viewed as fluff, not an epic motion picture like Braveheart. Watch it with an open mind and enjoy!",1049846400,,1151,4.1891891891891895
1800941,4,B0000764K0,"I have to tell you, I don't understand anyone wanting matthew broderick back as inspector gadget!  I thought the first movie was terrible and that he was so unconvincing and wooden in the role!  French Stewart, on the other hand, hits just the right balance of robotic-ness and humanity and imbues the character with much more heart AND light-heartedness.  Gadget and his bumbling through life are quickly endearing.  His dexterity with physical humour shines brightly (and i don't think we've seen the last of it from this actor).
Elaine Hendrix (""The Parent Trap"", ""Superstar"", etc.) does a wonderful job here as the new, improved, Gadget on the block, G2, who gets her ""heart"" from Gadget Version 1.0.  her customing is brilliant with her electric blue eyes being brought out by her metallic blue leather gadget-suit.
The movie really MOVES, sounds and looks like a comic book come to life and, therefore, it's quite successful.  A fun ride parents will enjoy taking with their kids.  i know that we have enjoyed it more than once already!  : )",1048291200,3,1047,4.875706214689266
1800942,1,B0000764K0,"this frankly smelled... but it would've been ok under a few conditions. (and not to mention consistent with the first one)
1) inspector gagdet should have been played by matthew broderick, in my opinion, he was and always will be the perfect gadget.
2) they should have had the lady whose father created him in the first movie, ig was supposed to fall in love with her, but they conpletely left her out in this movie!!!!
3) the special effects are TERRIBLE!!!!!!
4) dr. claw really bothered me in this one...
in short, ladies and gentlemen, this is, yet again, proof of how really desperate disney is.",1047859200,2,601,4.626168224299065

7974065,3,B0000764K0,"Inspector Gadget 2 is a film that had many reasons to fail on all cylinders , but it didn't, Inspector Gadget 2 unlike it's horrendous predecessor does a very good job in adapting the cartoon it is based on. Now I'm going to get the flaws out of the way, some of burdens that were present in the first film are present here, along with it's quirks,some of jokes fall flat at times, and there are few glaring plot-holes. the flaws are present, but this film has a lot of good things in this, for one it sticks closer to the cartoon, French Stewart is very enjoyable lead, the acting all around very solid,and enjoyable. Some of the works do work really well, has a silly plot, but works in tongue and cheek style, and the story is good Overall it is very decent flick, and something that I'll pop in the DVD every once and while.",1431043200,,828,4.280254777070064
