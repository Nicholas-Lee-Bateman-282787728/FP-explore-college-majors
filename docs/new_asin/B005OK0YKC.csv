8481425,4,B005OK0YKC,"This movie is Britain's answer to It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.  Terry-Thomas is the English comedian in the latter, and Michael Callan is the American equivalent in You Must Be Joking. Denholm Elliot is perfect as a James Bond spoof, and Lionel Jeffries steals the movie as a ""Mad"" Scottish Sergeant Major.  Wilfred Hyde White is his usual calm unflappable self, Bernard Cribbins is hilarious as well. Both movies have a similar plot: a treasure hunt is involved, and there is plenty of slapstick included. There are some weaker scenes in the script, probably included so  as to give the audience a chance to catch their breaths.",1423267200,,633,4.7889908256880735
8481426,2,B005OK0YKC,"In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the British film industry produced some of the best comedies in movie history.  The Boulting Brothers were especially notable for producing hilarious films starring the likes of Ian Carmichael, Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Alistair Sim, and Alec Guinness.  So when I looked at the cast of You Must Be Joking, I rushed to buy it.  Don't.  It's a stinker, in large part because of a faulty and wholly unamusing script by a well-known Punch magazine writer.  Terry-Thomas and the others do their best, but there just isn't anything to work with.",1356652800,,577,4.907216494845361
