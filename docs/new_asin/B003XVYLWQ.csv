8408548,5,B003XVYLWQ,"Jenny Sieck did a wonderful job of sharing her insight around the use of the Tarot. This DVD is set in a classroom setting that allows you to feel a part of the lecture. Her confidence and knowledge of the use of the Tarot was very impressive especially her suggestion to recognize how an image of a card is speaking to you by your body's response to the image, or a portion therein.

Jenny's method teaches you to address the fear around an image and notice where it is speaking to you. By acknowledging the sensation and facing it, therefore healing it, you then realize the lesson the card is offering. You are encouraged to 'feel' what the image is saying and the story it has to share with you. This process is by far best over trying to memorize the meaning of each card of a Tarot Deck. You are learning to allow each card to speak to you of its purpose and embrace the lesson and its guidance.

As the editor and owner of Bellesprit Magazine, I find Jenny's work of great value not only for our readers of the magazine, but in her own personal work as well.",1458259200,,1065,4.293532338308458
8408549,4,B003XVYLWQ,"I was excited to find TAROT: Intuition & The Living Image - A Jungian Approach video. It is not difficult to find videos and books on how to read the Tarot, but what caught my eye was that this teaching uses the Jungian modality rather than the memorize this and be a tarot expert instantly.
As a tarot reader, I was pleased with the additional insight that the video offered. The speaker was knowledgeable and the teaching offered valuable tools to add to what I already knew.
She explains things like the Jungian term collective unconsciousness and how it applies to Tarot. I found especially useful how she delved into discussion on the Archetypes. I found the whole presentation to be information packed with something for someone at any stage of learning. The best part of owning the material is that I can come back to it, study some of the new concepts, and have some valuable reference material as I delve into deeper study.
I love the encouragement to listen to our intuition, how to listen and watch our own reactions that the cards bring to us as we use them. The principles in this video will enhance the readings of someone who is already a tarot reader or someone who is new to the tarot. It shows how to find the nuances, facets, and shading that is already there that may go unnoticed. I found it very helpful and recommend it.
The video was recorded in a classroom setting and the few later comers were a tiny bit distracting, HOWEVER it is an easy tradeoff for this valuable empowering tool and the solid information that I received from this video.",1449705600,,1567,4.560283687943262
8408550,1,B003XVYLWQ,"Very amateur video and not very informative, at least I didn't get anything out of it.  Seemed like she was giving a casual talk to a group of her students.  Bad audio also and no camera technique... people talk and you never see there face.",1324944000,4,241,4.333333333333333
8408551,2,B003XVYLWQ,"This is like a homemade movie.  Just filming a person in a very casual classroom.  People didn't even respect the speaker enough to show up on time.  They keep coming in after she started speaking.  She didn't make sure her props were even the right size before filming, like the table she is using is a TV tray table.  Then she doesn't do the layout she chose correctly and has to readjust (confusing if you're a beginner).  I still was trying to get something from the ""fluff"" she is saying and I ended up falling asleep.  The only thing I got from the first 20-30 minutes was ""see what the cards mean to you"".  I will try watching again and maybe it gets better.",1300233600,4,665,4.306451612903226
8408552,5,B003XVYLWQ,"I have always been intrigued by the Tarot and have read considerably on the topic, but never felt I had a solid sense of how to interpret the method. This DVD has solved that dilemma for me. Tarot: Intuition & the Living Image A Jungian Approach is a must-see for anyone with an interest in the Tarot, and anyone who seeks to understand the deck- and life- with more clarity, awareness and depth. Reverend Jennifer Sieck offers a clear version of how the classical teachings of world-renowned psychologist Carl Jung interlace with the Tarot images and how these approaches can help us understand the symbols and stories we are destined to tell. Rev. Sieck gently encourages the viewer to ask important questions, such as: ""Where can we find our power?"" ""Where is the energy in your life?"" ""Where do you hold the energy in your experience?"" and ""What is the story you are meant to tell?"" When we can better understand each symbol or archetype, we can see how it embodies itself within the potential stories we tell in our lives.

The archetypal influence in our lives is present in everything, and we can experience them with all six of our senses. Rev. Sieck explains the Tarot's traditional depictions and encourages us to pay attention to what we are instinctively drawn to; and, equally important, what we instinctively shy away from. Acknowledging these intuitive nudges helps us weigh the expression of energy while doing a reading. Rev. Sieck emphasizes that this interpretation is best done with a client-driven focus, or the practice of ""mirroring."" As a result of understanding this we are better able to accurately interpret the subtle nuances of each individual's story, and thus is the essence of an effective, clear and successful reading with the Tarot.

This video, with its clear images and depictions of the four sacred elements, is perfect for self-reading and learning to read for others. It is helpful for both novices & seasoned readers. This presentation shows how the major symbols of our lives have always been present, and Rev. Siecks video provides a beautiful framework to work with these symbols, so that we may tell the story we are destined to tell.",1284854400,6,2179,4.886486486486486
8408553,5,B003XVYLWQ,"For seasoned tarot readers and beginners alike; this video is particularly good at calling out attention to the layers and lenses that make up the archetypical images that come alive in the cards.

unlike most other tarot teaching models, Jennifer Sieck takes things a step further  and helps us decode the visceral connection we feel when we come upon these images.  As tarot is a language of symbols, learning from a book may be possible, but is often not enough to help students make personal and lasting connections with the images. Where books fall short, Jennifer Sieck shows us how the integration of these images reveals a hidden world inside ourselves. Once we understand the meaning of the cards in the organic way that she explains them, it becomes much easier to define the unconscious content that is expressed in the reading.  Sieck is a pleasure to watch and listen to, and is knowledgeable, and easy to understand at the same time.  There is no way to listen to Jennifer and not become better at understanding the language of tarot. I highly recommend this video.",1281916800,6,1079,4.8108108108108105
