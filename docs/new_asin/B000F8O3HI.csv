8119101,5,B000F8O3HI,This Scooby Doo vhs has 2 episodes on it. A clue for scooby doo and hassle in the castle. They did a great job making this tape because it is its originality. The theme song is in its original way and they didn't change up any of the episode airing. 5 stars.,1442707200,,258,3.980769230769231
