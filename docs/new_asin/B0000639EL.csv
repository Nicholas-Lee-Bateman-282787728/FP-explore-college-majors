1687886,5,B0000639EL,"This is a wonderful movie.  There are 9 total tapes (3 for Woman of Substance, 3 for Hold the Dream and 3 for To Be the Best). Amazon has the information wrong on this product.",1185062400,,176,4.0285714285714285
1687887,2,B0000639EL,disc #1 was wonderful ... I started disc #2 the same night and was THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED.... this #2 started out about 30 yrs ahead..  There was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ON THE DISC ABOUT EMMA'S LOVER PAUL AND THEY STORY TOGETHER... i watched #3 just because I had it... I WROTE TO THE AUTHOR MRS BRADFORD AND THE COMPANY THAT MADE THE CD... I WANTED A REFUND....  If there is a complete disc 2 out there I never saw it :(,1126656000,15,418,4.2784810126582276
1687888,3,B0000639EL,"I bought this trilogy on the strength of the 5 star review I had read.  To save someone else the disappointment I received, I am writing my first review.

  The first of the 3, the title piece, was worth watching and on it's own might rate 4 stars.  But the quality of the other two fell off dramaticly and I wouldn't give either of them more than 2 stars.  Have our standards changed so much in the last 14-20 years since these were made and first broadcast, or would they have seemed just as insipid to me if I had seen them then, I wonder?  I suppose if you have read and enjoyed the books (which I have not) you might have a different opinion.  But I found the story rather contrived, the acting mediocre, and the characters underdeveloped and unappealing.  Even the love scenes were uninspiring.  The worst part, though, I think would have to be the cheesy background music which made it impossible to forget that I was watching a repackaged 80's miniseries.

  So buy it only if you are a big Barbara Taylor Bradford fan and can overlook some major shortcomings.  This trilogy has certainly not made a fan of me.",1112659200,74,1118,4.416666666666667
1687889,5,B0000639EL,"I was so happy when I learn that ""A Woman of Substance"" series was coming to DVD. These are two great DVD's(while Hold the Dream is okay)The picture and sound on all three movie's is great. My only complaint is why was Lindsey Wagner casted for ""Hold the Dream?"" The change in the cast hurts this movie. Overall, ""The woman of substance"" trilogy is must for any fan of the books.",1040515200,29,379,4.352112676056338

1687911,3,B0000639EL,"I was excited to get this mini series because I had just gotten through reading the first 3 books again (there r 6 books in the series, on the last one now.)
But I digress....I was disappointed in the mini series because the casting was not true to the characters in the book...Jenny Seagrave is a very good actress, but Emma in the book had red hair and green eyes! And the husbands and kids didn't match up to the books! Edwina is a blonde in the book but in the mini series shes a brunette, and Emmas husbands were not as good looking as described in the books. And Shane was supposed to have black hair! Emily is a blonde in the book, but brunette in the series. Come on people, u couldn't find anyone close to what was in the books?
As for To Be The Best....I love, love, love, Lindsay Wagner, always have and always will, but I didn't like her in this story. And the story was taken from the end of the book. Very little of the first of the book was used and only 1 of Paula and Shane's kids were in this story-Patrick. Where did the other kids go? And where were Emily and Winston and their kids?
I loved the books and have read the first 3 until ragged. The last 3 are so very good and carry on the series admirably. If a mini series is ever made of the last 3 books, please stay true to the characters, please!!!
Ok, rant over....for now!",1471651200,,1347,4.1254752851711025

1687920,3,B0000639EL,"I related quite well to the first two of the trilogy, A Woman of Substance and Hold the Dream. Although I realize that not all of the books characters and contents can ""fit"" into a mini series, of what I did view, the story and characters were true. Also in my opinion, without having read the books, the story line would have been hard to follow. The third of the trilogy, To Be the Best, was hugely a disappointment to me. Too much emphasis was put on only sections of the novel. The main characters were given complete different personalities, and there was almost no indication of all the children and grandchildren of Emma Harte. I did enjoy the landscapes, homes, cities and countries that were presented through the series. Glad that I had recently read the complete series of ""A Woman of Substance"" the Emma Harte Saga. Otherwise if I had first watched the trilogy mini series, I may have never read the books. Loved the books, and thank you Barbara Taylor Bradford, they were perfect!!!",1463443200,2,995,4.627118644067797

But, overall, the heroine was too cold, focused, and money driven for my taste. Other than when she was young and in love, she failed to capture my heart or evoke any emotion in me until (near the end of the series) she softened as an older women.

1688017,2,B0000639EL,"This movie in my opinion was a big disappointment !  The movie is no where near as good as the book was.  The movie starts out not too bad, but it jumps ahead too far, then it starts from the beginning when she is a maid.  I thought at the beginning well maybe this will be good, then after she leaves to go on her own, it went downhill, as it again jumps ahead too far, leaving out what happens while she is on her own.  In the book it tells how she builds her empire on her own, but not in the movie, just a brief flashback; this was the best parts of the book.  I did however like the part where she finds out her son's are rotten and gets even.  Liam's role was rather corny later on when he becomes successful.  The love story was also a lot better in the book too.  Over all, I was disappointed in this movie.  Rebecca",1388966400,2,824,3.9454545454545453

Unfortunately, Ms. Bradford's husband did not do the writings justice in the film versions....and there wasn't a very good job of editing and sound production...the third and final episodes were not as ""English"" as the first two versions...much more ""Hollywood""......the musical sounds backgrounds were grossly intrusive....not enhancing at all....very loud...used too much as a tool to depict drama.
I was very disappointed in the quality of the production of the films......
Her books were so popular, and rightly so...it is too bad they were compromised by this poor fillm adaptation.
Viewing the films would not entice anyone to read the books, and that is a shame....
The books are rich with characters and detailed in the ties that bind.....which is difficult to adapt in a film because of time restraints...so  I am sorry that there will be a lot of readers who will never enjoy the story of the Harte family....",1339804800,9,1013,5.102409638554217
1688182,5,B0000639EL,"This is a wonderful series.
It is indeed a rags to riches.... In reference to the previous review: when did pulling oneself up by the bootstraps not involve some serious sacrifice & hard work?

My Mother recorded this on VHS years ago & I can hardly wait for it to arrive on DVD. ----------- I found it inspiring, motivating & most entertaining.",1338854400,27,345,4.564516129032258
1688183,3,B0000639EL,"After reading the reviews, I thought this sounded like an enjoyable trilogy - a 'rags to riches' story, which can sometimes be enjoyable.

I found the overall negativity - while probably very true to human nature - unappealing. Too much vengence, too much hate, and no real happy moments to balance.

It was more a story about a woman who gave up 'living' to prove she was as good as those she hated, than someone who overcame all odds to make a place for herself and her children in a world dominated (at the time she began) by men. She becomes just as ruthless and uncaring as the ones she's trying to prove her worth to, simply 'proving' to the viewer that you can't win by being a different type of person than the 'examples' you have been shown.

Maybe I'm too Pollyanna, but I feel we can all WIN, and still stay true to our values - we don't have to become even worse than those we see around us who have apparently succeeded - if only by amassing a lot of money.",1338768000,29,970,4.260869565217392
1688184,5,B0000639EL,"A trilogy of substance. 3 Barbara Taylor Bradford books adapted to mini-series, now a complete epic. In bonus film of the author, she praises adaptations, she always influenced content, and her husband produced 2 & 3. ""It was faithful to the book.""--BTB. Bradford said Jenny Seagrove was indeed the young Emma she envisioned. Long novels, therefore some cutting. What's left is great British drama of not a women's libber, but a driven woman successful in a man's business world.

Cast is stellar. Jenny Seagrove is flawless as young Emma in #1, then Gr-daughter Paula in #2. Deborah Kerr is 1980s Emma in #1 & #2 (her last performance ever). Diane Baker played Laura, but was the force behind the series' start. Biggest surprise is Liam Neeson a new face in his 30s, as Blackie, lifetime lover/friend to Emma. He was as good then as he is today. Meg Wynn Owen (Upstairs, Downstairs), Peter Chelsom, Steven Collins, James Brolin, Claire Bloom (King's Speech), Christopher Cazenove, Julian Fellowes (Downton Abbey, Monarch of the Glen), Bionic Lindsay Wagner, Anthony Hopkins...well, many & more.

SUBTITLED. My wife and I enjoyed all 3 series. #1 `A WOMAN OF SUBSTANCE' best, #2 `HOLD THE DREAM' almost equally but you do have to get used to the lead actress changing roles, & #3 `TO BE THE BEST' perhaps not the best, but a modern finish to the saga. Comparisons one to the other can/& are written, but it's best to simply enjoy the DVDs, not as the novels, but as video entertainment well worth the price.

A WOMAN OF SUBSTANCE-3 episodes In 1905 young Emma is maid at Fairley Hall, Squire (Peter Egan), alcoholic Mrs (Nicola Pagett) & 1 good son (Chelsom), 1 bad (Christopher Gable). Builder Blackie (Leeson) arrives for repairs meeting Emma, who's Ma (Meg Wynn Owen) is seriously ill. There are secrets, ambition and love to encounter.
In ep 2 Emma leaves facing problems & new beginning. 1906 moves through arson, a rapid business climb, WWI and Emma makes a shrewd mill purchase for war garments.
Ep 3 Widow Emma inherits more property as wounded brother (Mick Ford) returns. Death, financial gain, remarriage, & Emma's hatred of Fairley's cultivates in surprises in lusts of love, money, & power. War ends. Personal battles grow. Love rendezvous, disaster, WW2 and a 1980s attempted business takeover.

HOLD THE DREAM-2 episodes Kerr in a larger role, Seagrove in a new, with other family returning but played by new actors. Neeson is an older Blackie, still perfection in the role. He competes with Kerr & Seagrove as show anchors. A new generation of affairs, business tycoons, Harte-Fairley feud. 1980s loves lost as fast as new lusts begin. Worldwide business managed by Emma's grands. Gran-Paula (Seagrove) becomes an Emma clone, including marital issues. Matriarch Emma mellows. Who can hold another's dream? Business gets physically rougher.

TO BE THE BEST-2 episodes Paula (now Lindsay Wagner) continues taking on a modern business world. Competition becomes violent and deadly. Players in this game are in London, Hong Kong, NY, & Indiana (rudely misrepresented as a mix of a southern/Country Western state) about 1990. International intrigue within family lines, high finance garnished w2ith adultery. A dramatic contemporary change from Emma's quaint beginning.

This is a wonderful story. There is good acting and character development, as well as a good plot, and beautiful location photography. There is authenticity of scenery, sets, etc., and the characters are very believable.  I had not seen the 3rd installment and I could hardly wait for it to arrive!
