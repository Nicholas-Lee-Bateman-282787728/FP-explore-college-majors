8241426,5,B0011DGFQS,"I purchased this video for my kids back in the 90's when they were young and they loved it, especially the music. Now perhaps the other reviewers have a point that the animation may be dated but the story is timeless and these are really appropriate for kids under 10.",1368144000,2,268,4.38
8241427,1,B0011DGFQS,"This dvd is HORRIBLY animated. My kids literally laughed at how poorly the dvd's are done. I would assume they were made in the 80's. I did some research and found that the company is NOT a Christian company. It was founded and is now run by a Mormon. Despite that fact, they are just very painful to watch. Save yourself the money.",1308355200,,332,4.285714285714286
8241428,1,B0011DGFQS,"Unbelievable. Even with fast-forwarding past Charleton Heston, this video is painful to watch. The kids in my class declared the songs ""cheesy"" - a generous assessment if you ask me. They dubbed the young narrator ""that freak with the camel"". One viewing and it was off to the thrift store.",1252108800,,290,4.82
