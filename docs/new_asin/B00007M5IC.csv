1822849,4,B00007M5IC,"Do you enjoy films so poor they become unintentional comedies? Do you find yourself delivering running commentaries during movies like the cast of Mystery Science Theater 3000? Then this little stinker is perfect for you!
While the film's producers likely had loftier aspirations, Max Magician is one of the funniest fantasy films ever made. From actors who play multiple parts to wonderfully corny dialog to the unintentionally hilarious character foibles, this film is worth every penny if you enjoy ""bad"" movies.
The movie is chocked full of contradictions and plot holes--Max, for instance, should be the butt of every bully at school; he nearly goes to class wearing a stage magician's cape, and his parents constantly complain about his lack of friends--but he seems rather popular with the girls when he does a ""trick"" that ends up covering a bully's face with egg. Still, when your best friend is a talking mouse with attitude and you look up to ""tough"" elderly gardeners, maybe you've got worse problems than bullies.
That Max's gardening pal receives a warning of great danger from a man killed delivering it doesn't stop him from sending poor Max off with nary a word of caution into a world of poorly-made-up elves (or should they be fairies based on their hodgepodge mythological references?) and sneering, laughable bad guys off doing their ""kingly things."" The plot thickens about as much as water from there...
The DVD version includes a number of ""special"" (like the short bus) features, including a documentary that features the curator of Natural Bridge droning on about how wonderful it was for a movie to actually film inside caves; the gung-ho armorer demonstrating ""realistic"" war hammers looking more like croquet mallets; and repeated rehearsals of one of Max's friends cracking an egg on a bully's head.  These are nearly as funny as the film itself!
The name and cover alone would disuade the fan of more serious fantasy, yet don't let that disuade you from picking this title up. If you want a great laugh at a great price, take Max Magician for a ride.",1047427200,32,2081,4.945714285714286

1822863,1,B00007M5IC,"I have long been a fan of fantasy films (more than 50 years worth), and since this genre has limited appeal it draws very little production money.  Hence, there are a lot of bad fantasy films. This movie easily finds its way into my list of the top ten worst fantasy films of all time. It simply lacks anything to recommend it, except possibly for some 8 to 12 year old children. Most of what the other one star votes have said is true. My only disagreement would be with the idea that it is so bad that it is good.  I didn't find it so.",1335139200,2,537,4.056603773584905
1822864,5,B00007M5IC,IF you want a good time with your friends this is a movie to see.  It falls in the category so bad that it's so awesome!  Everytime my friends and I get together to watch this film we are teary-eyed with laughter.  The movie is about a kid named Max who is given a magical book to another world.  The film is so low budget it appears to be shot in someone's backyard throughout the entire movie.  The director also reuses actors in several roles.  All in all this movie is hysterical with the low budget quality. It's a great film to watch and laugh at.,1329004800,4,553,4.169811320754717
1822865,5,B00007M5IC,"This movie is amazing.  If you want a brainless multi million dollar production, look elsewhere.  This is honestly the most intelligent movie that I have ever seen.  I own this movie and all the lord of the rings movies.  I have watched this one more then all three of them put together, it is that good.

The director didn't have a lot of money when he made it so there are some production value errors that other reviewers seem to look at with an unbalanced look against the movie.  I have showed this movie to over 20 people and not one of them hated watching it with me.  If you have a group of friends and want to sit around and drink while talking about a movie while watching it, this is the best.  If you have good friends this will be an amazing watch.

The scenery in the movie is beautiful and the soundtrack is very nice.  I am not sure if I can find it but I will be looking after I make this post.  I was unable to find it earlier.",1327449600,,945,4.081521739130435
1822866,3,B00007M5IC,"When I was a kid, this was one of my favorite movies ever. I could go straight from watching Labyrinth to this. I just recently got to watch it again, and I can say: Childhood was jaded, but this was hilariously bad. If you want a good laugh, get it. It's cheap (a little under $5 at the time of this review) and will deliver a good laugh.",1320624000,,339,4.0
1822867,2,B00007M5IC,"While I was wandering through Walmart one day, I became introduced to this movie while exploring the $5.00 bin of either old movies or rejects.  Curious, I rushed home and decided to purchase it.  My, my was I in for a surprise!

First of all, the movie description states ""in the spirit of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings"".  This wasn't far from the mark as it was certainly in the spirit of these classics, just not up to their excellence level as this movie falls far, far below the mark.  Almost an insult to Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings is more of a realistic attribute as this movie has no real flavor and while it could have just the hint of a potential, never really lives up to it's expectations.

While the movie attempts to be a serious magical adventure film, it comes off as more of a comedy than anything else.  The acting is atrocious, watching people spew out their lines as if the director hired them straight off the street.  No real expression, no real movement, and an overly simplified dialogue, making this almost hilarious to watch as the actors either over do it or just give up trying.

Possibly one of the more humorous scenes is the main bad guy, sitting in his cave fortress as he consistently says ""Bahhh"" after every line- giving the impression that he's more of a dying, disgruntled goat than anything else.  Not only that, but his army of rushing madmen takes on the appearance of a mix between a biker gang and rejected viking warriors, complete with obvious foam hammers that pound cardboard doors to splinters!  Lead by their insidious leader who constantly argues with the main villian on how to execute plans.

To further add to this awesome adventure gone terribly wrong, the door keeper to the city is an older woman/ man type thing who constantly rhymes everything they say.  Honestly, I have not felt as much need to conduct physical violence on a movie character before until they stepped onto the screen, spewing the useless and unwitty dialogue in an attempt to make the movie appear childlike and enjoyable.  Oh it certainly was enjoyable all right, just not in the way it was intended.

The film was clearly low budget as the same woman plays two different characters: the mom and the elf queen.  The relationships between the characters were shabby to say the least and the filming was pretty much done with a normal camera.  In fact the disappearance of this grand army of knights in the end, which by the way turned out to be about 4, was using the age old trick of stopping the film with them in it, then shooting a picture with them not in it next.  A tactic that any person with a video camera can conduct.

So, all in all, a very tactless movie.  I gave it two stars since they tried and made it more humorous than what it was intended to be.  Also, the elf king in the movie wasn't an overly terrible actor.  Not an oscar winner by any means but still better than practically all of the cast in this movie.  So, if you want a heroic fantasy movie that you and your friends can laugh at as you watch the poor acting and filming, this movie is for you!  If not, then I would invest in the actual Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings movies.",1314144000,2,3199,4.429059829059829
1822868,4,B00007M5IC,"This movie is so bad... I can't believe it exists!

A good prank to torture your friends with though.

I told my boyfriend to come home and watch this ""super awesome all-time movie!"" and he came over hoping to see something that had a nice combination of ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord of the rings"" As claimed by the film!

hehe, poor dude ended up having to buy some beer in order to have higher tolerance over this crappiness.. xD

This movie, in a way, is all about tolerance...  it's like... one reviewer stopped ""Watching this garbage"" as soon as the king--or whoever the heck that is 'cuts a fart' ...yeah, the movie is THAT cheesy. I on the other hand watched further from there --faulty judgment on my behalf.

Cause frankly, it's nothing to brag about if you make it all the way to the end.. =/ the movie drags on to the point where it loses it's ""lame awesomeness!"" it truly becomes awful and completely irrelevant to the title..

I wish it could've been short and crappy. then there'd be a better chance of my watching it again.

I was going to give it a 5 star... but it loses a star because they over did their lameness... =(",1249776000,2,1133,4.3619047619047615
1822869,1,B00007M5IC,"I wish Mystery Science Theater 3000 was still around; it would have had a field day with this. As it was, I laughed out loud the entire way through. Check out the elf wearing tennis shoes! The top henchman who ogles everyone he talks to! The villain farting and being dissolved by mice! Elves armed with breadsticks! The foley work for people running, which consisted of hitting a bag of raw rice against a wall! The special effects done via PowerPoint! The people Max keeps in his closet! The ""army"" of FOUR PEOPLE! Everything, everything is unintentionally hilarious. In fact, I debated whether I should give this movie one star for failing as a movie or five stars for being one of the best worst movies ever made.

Your kids will not be fooled. They will wander off, completely bored. The only way they might like it is if they are young... the 4-7-years-old kind of young. And frankly, that's too young for them to see this, since they'll become upset at all the lame elves getting lamely whacked in the back with lame foam hammers.

This movie has a Special Features and Commentary section, which makes it all the stranger. How could anyone make this and not know how beyond salvageable it was? Acting, costumes, script, story, and sets were past poor. The only excellent elements were the false faces, and even those had aesthetics that screamed, ""I was stolen from the set of Lord of the Rings!""

You're going to hate this movie. If you're a bad movie aficionado, however, this will be one of the stars of your collection. It's really one of those stinkers that must be seen to be believed.",1226707200,3,1598,4.6

Hi,
I watched the movie and fell in love with it. Max is a little wimpy boy but then he gets magic powers and kicks [...]. In one scene Max fell down the stairs!!

If you like adventure then rent this movie and hold on to your seat. Elf babes are in this movie but they do not expose sexual organs, nor do they consummate relationships until marriage.

Max not only thrills us with cool tricks, he also shows us how to believe in ourselves, especially when life seems hard. Sometimes my life is hard, sometimes I don't know how to keep on living. That's when I put on Max Magician and find hope.

There is no cussin' in this movie so you can watch it with the whole family. I don't have a family but I wish I did.

1822882,1,B00007M5IC,"The ""let's make a cheap (CHEAP) fantasy film"" industry has over the years managed to generate at least as much bad acting as old westerns, 1930s-40s serials, Ed Wood films, and porn that aspires to plot lines.  And it must be observed that Charles Middleton and Harry Reems (e.g.) could display some slight modicum of the thespian muse -- of which in this mutt of a film there isn't the slightest trace.

Imagine an average High School English class, slogging through a Shakespeare play by reading the parts and hating them.  No, the acting here isn't that bad -- it's worse.  The impression can't be avoided that that --um, ""performers"" in this film were selected based precisely on their inability to register emotion.  We will dispense with the usual listing of the (understandably unknown) names in order to protect the guilty.

Overall, ""Max Magician"" is unusually derivative, unimaginative, and overwritten, even for a 3-day-wonder very-low-budget fantasy film.  The situations that occur are frequently contrived to the point of absurdity and with an eye toward cheap melodrama.

The plot, such as it is, involves a kid named Max who has difficulties with a school bully (how original!) and is a not untalented amateur magician.  He's given an obviously ancient book of (real) magic spells by an elderly neighbor, with the advice to ""believe in yourself"".  Nobody ever explains what this means, but in every crisis the kid has somebody (a mouse or a hawk or whatever) yelling this generic bit of street-corner philosophy at him.

Max uses the book to enter a fantasy world in which there is a developing struggle between elves, trolls, and other inmates of your usual $5-per-CD role-playing game.  A deus-ex-machina wizard shows up to teach him to use the spells in his book whilst dispensing platitudinous advice that makes Polonius look like a sage.

Max uses his newfound magic to assist the elves and their friends against the evil troll king (or whatever he is with the ostentatious horns on his head).  Max's late confrontation with the latter doesn't amount to much but is nonetheless decisive.  The ""rings"" of the title are a direct steal in basic concept from Tolkien, but have neither a legend nor a significant role to play in the film.  In the end there is another confrontation between Max and the bully -- which, however, is unsatisfactorily indecisive.

I wish I could tell you that ""Max Magician"" has some redeeming feature or features.  Alas.  While the print used on the DVD is quite clear, it only serves to emphasize how cheesy the ""magic"" effects (such as they are) appear.  Oddly, the makeup isn't all that bad, although elf ears are no more convincing than convention-issue Spock ears.  Special effects are minimal and are generally foggy and sparkly effects superimposed on the film.  The script, including the mandatory bwa-ha-ha-has from the chief bad guy, lurches from banality to banality.

I don't recommend this film, even for children.  We have to maintain some sort of minimum quality standard insofar as they're concerned.  Besides, anybody over the age of 5 (if not younger) will watch this with the constant thought that, ""Gee, I could be watching mud wrestling instead.""

It's instructive to note that prices for used copies on Amazon have plummeted to $0.01 (yep, 1 cent) ... although some idiot thinks he's going to get $50 for it.  Probably from some other idiot.",1149638400,12,3409,4.945518453427065

1822886,1,B00007M5IC,"This movie is sure to be among the world's worst children's films ever.  As a children's theater director, I never would have cast this sorry group of performers who looked the part but were outclassed by the scenery in terms of their delivery of lines.  (Except for the title character, Max who seemed to try.)
I watched this turkey in growing disbelief that it could get any worse....but it did!  The videography was straight out of home movie production with a large reliance on diagonal wipes in scene changes, and about one overused special effect that was used for everything ""magical.""  The plot was almost non-existent and combined with the actor's sterling delivery managed to bore everyone present at my god-daughters birthday party.
Bottom line -- the six year old lost interest after ten minutes and the nine year old lasted a half hour (but it was her present from Grandma so she made the effort).

The wretched facial expressions and disjointed dialog are effervescent of one take only production. Pure gold!

7978389,1,B00007M5IC,"One day I was at a Christmas party.  I was sitting at a table with an older friend of mine, when white elephant gifts were being opened.  Someone opened a gift containing this movie.  My friend asks me what it is.  I say, ""That is quite possibly the worst movie ever made.""  As soon as I finished saying that, we overheard another friend at the table beside us tell those he was sitting with, ""That is the worst movie ever made.""

When we watched this movie for the first time, my dad came into the room to get something.  He stopped to watch it.  After about a minute, he told us it was so terrible that he could not watch anymore, and he left the room.

My brother told a friend about this movie.  His friend said, ""It can't be that bad.""  So he loaned it to his friend.  Before watching it, he told his family what my brother had said, and they expressed the same opinion that it ""can't be that bad.""  They watched it together, but only for about 5 minutes, after which they politely asked him to turn it off.

I would love to make fun of this movie, except that when I even think about it, it feels like making fun of a kid with a mental disability.  The movie comes with a ""making of"" commentary, in which the creators make it painfully (literally) clear that they think they have made a truly good movie.  They are utterly oblivious to the fact that what they have made is an abomination.  It is difficult and somewhat embarrassing to listen to their excitement over what they have created.  The movie itself is hard enough to watch, but the commentary is just plain tragic.

As far as the movie itself goes, the makeup is actually decent, and there are a few places where it pans across what is almost certainly stock landscape footage that is decent as well.  The acting is abysmal, aside, perhaps, from the elf queen, who could be good with a bit more experience.  The foam weapons are swung around exactly like you would expect foam weapons to be.  The combat scenes are terribly choreographed (or, very possibly, not choreographed at all).  Several of the characters are just plain embarrassing.  If you care about manners, then this is probably not even an appropriate movie for children, as the villain loudly passes gas at one point.  The story is also terrible, with elements clearly ripped off from other things and enough cliches to make you sick.  In summary, decent makeup, decent stock footage, terrible acting, terrible props, bad choreography, bad/stolen story, frequent cliches, crude humor, and no redeeming value.  Unless you like making fun of retarded kids, it is not even ""so bad its good"".  It is just straight up embarrassing.

In my opinion, and the opinions of most of the people I know who have seen it, this is The Worst Movie Ever Made.  If you have a twisted sense of humor and enjoy watching people embarrass themselves, it might be worth spending $5 on (we found it in the WalMart $5 bin), but even a lottery ticked might be a better investment.  Give the $5 to a homeless man, and it will be far more fulfilling than having this movie in your collection.",1507334400,,3093,4.489247311827957
