2891762,5,B000T28C8Q,I love this show and have bought every box season from amazon!! I love each season more and more!! They truly don't try and fool you! They are real people with a mission. I have gotten so many of my friends and family hooked on the show just by borrowing my box sets!! A must have for any true fan!!,1193702400,,299,4.0
2891763,5,B000T28C8Q,"I was very disappointed that two of the season's episodes, USS Lexinton and Manson Murders, were not on this set.  Otherwise, the three DVDs are lots of fun to view.  The three episodes in Ireland/England are the most entertaining, being an exploration of mythology of hauntings as well as a search for ghosts.  As usual, nothing much is documented, but the activities of the team in such places as Leap Castle or the Hellfire caves is very entertaining, as is the presence of an Irish counterpart, Barry, who is very emotional and at times, almost hysterical.  He adds a lot of drama to the episodes, although not in a tense way but sort of comical.  Brian Harnois is here as well, and my opinion is that he's the best of the team since he is so enthusiastic as well as being a nice guy, unlike Steve, who is his usual nasty self.  I am sorry to hear that Brian has moved on, since episodes that lacked him were always dull, although it is understandable since he was consistently the target of Jason's anger management problem.  He will be hard to replace, and as of the current shows running on cable, the second half of season 3, they aren't doing a good job of finding his or Donna's replacement.  Nor are they getting themselves any scientific credibility, which the team seems to want, by not having scientists (e.g., first season's Paula) on the team.  The quality of the DVDs in this set is better than the past -- the sound is very good, although at a few times, slightly fuzzy. Picture is good, and the stacking tray packaging is convenient.",1193529600,,1552,4.534050179211469

2891765,5,B000T28C8Q,"This is a really good season.  Every episode seemed to have some type of evidence.  Cases in Ireland and England were pretty cool, even though Steve didn't go!  Can't wait for part 2.",1192320000,,183,4.484848484848484
2891766,4,B000T28C8Q,"Big Vision's remark in the replacement offer statement about switching to an all digital process must be true because this season's audio/video is crisp and clear!  It is just the way a dvd set should be; however, they are still using the old cases that stack the dvds on top of each other.  That was never really a problem for me, but the replacement set they sent me for season 2 had a new case with the dvds seperated from each other so I thought they would do the same for the new season sets. Also, on the cover the Big Vision logo now says ""Digital"" underneath it confirming that they use a digital process.

Anyway, this season is one of my favorites, although short, most of the episodes are more exciting than the previous seasons. My favorites episodes include the Bird Cage Theater, West Virginia Penitentiary, Hellfire Caves, and the Leap and Lisheen Castles. I just like how they investigated more unique places and traveled overseas instead of sticking to just the states.

The St. Augustine Lighthouse episode from season 2 will always be my favorite episode and has made me a believer, but this season still holds just as much excitement and will not disappoint true ghost hunter fans.",1192060800,4,1201,4.677725118483412

GHOST HUNTERS APPROACH EACH CASE WITH AN OPEN MIND, BUT ALSO TAKE EVERYTHING THEY ARE TOLD ABOUT EACH CASE WITH ""A GRAIN OF SALT"" THEY MUST HAVE DEFINITE PROOF OF A HAUNTING BEFORE THEY ADMIT THAT THE PLACE IN FACT IS HAUNTED. THAT'S WHY THEY ARE SO GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO.

HOWEVER IF I MAY MAKE A SUGGESTION, I WILL LIKE TO SEE THE ""INVESTIGATORS"" DO A LOT MORE INVESTIGATING, AND LESS TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INVESTIGATION. THERE IS TOO MUCH OF THIS GOING ON. LETS CONCENTRATE ON WHAT WE ARE DOING!!

2891769,5,B000T28C8Q,"I just want to write a review because I've noticed nobody has really done one. These guys are great, the shows are amazing and entertaining and I just love it. They are credible. Most of the time they go into a place and find nothing.. it doesn't matter because it's fun to watch.. but they go into a place trying to figure out other reasons for the things that people experience. When they catch something, it's really exciting because you can tell they're not making anything up.
This might be the best season yet. The first reviewer was right.. there are some crazy, crazy things going on in some of these places. I have become addicted to Ghost Hunters and I pray that it continues to be picked up season after season. Very very good show. Absolutely pick it up. You will love it.",1185321600,13,784,4.451388888888889
2891770,5,B000T28C8Q,"Unlike the other ""Paranormal"" shows out there, I still find TAPS to be the most credible of them all. The investigation at The Birdcage in Tombstone was awesome, and the USS Lexington episode was fantastic. But, to me, the investigation that involved the Manson Murders, and the tortured sounds of those EVPs really shook me, I have to admit.
That one stuck with me, and I would have to say that was the most gut and heart-wrenching of any episode of Ghost Hunters I've seen.
I write horror, and I don't shake easily, but remembering how beautiful Sharon Tate was and hearing those EVPs really got to me.
That has to be one of their best investigations yet.
EDIT:
When this review was written, the product information was not yet up. As the Manson episode was the last episode of Part One of Season Three, I assumed it would be on Part One of Season Three's DVD set. Apparently it is not.
But, Tombstone, The Stanley, and Nightmare Noises are, and they are definitely worth checking out.
GH has come to my town for Eastern State Penitentiary, I wish they would come back and do Fort Mifflin (a supposedly VERY active fort that was used in the Revolutionary War where hundreds died battling the British Navy as they pushed their way up the Delaware giving Washington time to regroup at Valley Forge, and later became a prison during the Civil War).",1184803200,21,1347,4.593360995850622

2891786,4,B000T28C8Q,"Ah Ghost Hunters, you keep getting better and better.  That or I'm just easily entertained.  Maybe a little of both.  But really, it's quite an entertaining show and they get more polished as time goes along.

Ghost Hunters is about The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS).  Created by Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, plumbers, it groups together a bunch of like-minded people for paranormal investigations.  What makes TAPS different though is that they try to disprove hauntings.  That way, when theyr'e left with evidence they can't explain, it seems more legitimate.  And they use a variety of tools to help them in these investigations.  EMF detectors, video, audio and thermal devices.  All of these are in an effort to have tangible proof that other people can see rather than relying on eye-witness accounts.

They have a pretty solid group of people they work with too.  Jason and Grant are the leaders of course, and almost always pair together when investigating.  But even though they are polar opposites they still work together quite well.  Steve is the tech manager and he is endearing and serious all at the same time.  He's also dropped some of his girl-craziness from the first season.  Brian is still a little flighty, but he's not as distracting in this season as he is in the others.  And Tango is just adorable and fun to watch as an Investigator in Training.  They all seem to have a real passion for what they're doing which is refreshing.

They investigate several different types of places in this half season.  The Bird Cage Theatre (great episode with great evidence), OK Corral, Copper Queen Hotel, West Virginia Penitentiary, Bucksteep Manor, Stanley Hotel, General Stanton Inn, and private residences.  But then they also go to Ireland and England to investigate some hauntings over there and that was quite interesting as well.  Although I wasn't as fond of the European investigator who kept taking them away from the Hauntings in apparent concern for their safety.  Personally I think if it meant good evidence they would have gladly taken a blow for the team so he shouldn't have interfered.  It was frustrating.

The film is the same as it was in the 2nd season.  Better than the first season but still not great.  They're equipment is a little better and some of the video is quite clear.  But some of it still has some fuzziness.  And the sound is good, except for when they're constantly playing the special effects and music, which is distracting.

I really enjoy watching this series.  It provides a lot of unknown and interesting evidence but they don't find something in every episode.  So it makes it believable.  If you have any interest in the paranormal this is a good series to watch.

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.

All it shows is an image that's highlighted in a nasty pink color.

The sound quality is MUCH better than previous seasons, but aside from that, I would rather watch this on TV.  The quality seems to be a bit better.

I like that they have fun while investigating and still maintain a professional image. I like their style where they try to dismiss a haunting, but if they can't, you are left with some pretty good evidence.

2891865,5,B000T28C8Q,"Of all of Big Vision's DVD releases of the wonderful series ""Ghost Hunters,"" Part One of Season Three is their best effort.  The video quality is excellent and the audio is ten times better than all of their previous efforts.  I own all of the ""Ghost Hunters"" series DVDs and am very happy that Big Vision finally got it right.

As for the actual shows in this set, all of them are excellent.  Sure, the results of some of the investigations are a letdown, but that's what makes this show so believable.  If Jason, Grant and the gang always found evidence of a haunting, I'd become suspicious of them.  Instead, the viewer is given an insightful look at the ups and downs of paranormal investigations.  Sometimes it's a goosechase.  Sometimes it's amazing.  Every once in awhile, the TAPS run into something they can't explain.

All of the episodes are excellent, but my personal favorites are ""Leap Castle,"" ""Lisheen Ruins & Viaduct Tavern,"" and ""OK Corral & Copper Queen Hotel.""

**Potential Spoilers**
As with the other series sets, there is bonus footage and deleted/extended scenes.  One of the best deleted scenes involves Tango and Jason after an attack at Leap Castle on Dustin.  It shows a very upset Tango intent on facing the elemental that attacked his teammate and a very concerned Jay explaining to him to calm down and hold back.  We get great insight on both of them from this interaction and I actually like them even more after all is said and done.

**End Spoilers**

If you're already a fan of the series, I'm wasting my breath with you.  You already know how great this show is.  If you've never watched ""Ghost Hunters"" before, you're in for a real treat.  This group seeks out to disprove as much phenomena as they can and even when the unexplainable occurs, they're still hesitant to label a place as haunted.

This is the best DVD transfer of the show so far and the best season they've ever had.  Highly recommended.",1202515200,9,1941,4.666666666666667
2891866,5,B000T28C8Q,"I'll keep this brief.

This DVD for 'Season 3 - part 1' is easily the best so far.  The investigations yield the most interesting results, and the overall DVD technical quality is excellent (Season 2 had terrible crunchy sound).

There are some great moments including:

* A demonic attack on a TAPS member who is reduced to tears
* A moment where three unkown entities stalk the team - caught on the thermal imaging camera
* A hilarious Irish investigator who is incredibly over dramatic and runs away / backs off everytime they might be catching something on camera or having an encounter.  On seeing Brian's shadow move the chap - Barry Fitgerald - proclaims: ""it is getting ready to attack"".  The bloke is clearly desperate for his own show, hence his constant stressing of the 'european method' but in the end he amounts to a slightly less annoying verion of Yvette Fielding from 'Most Haunted' here in the UK.

It goes without saying that this show is as much about the personalities as it is the investigations, and season 3 part 1 gets 10/10 for me on both counts.

Well done to the TAPS guys!",1199145600,,1101,4.581632653061225
2891867,5,B000T28C8Q,"I am a huge fan of the show Ghost Hunters, and have all of the other seasons on DVD. Season Three, Part One is probably my favorite out of all of them, especially the episodes where TAPS is in London and Ireland. I can't wait for the second part of Season Three to be out on DVD.",1198972800,,279,3.912280701754386
2891868,5,B000T28C8Q,"I have all the Ghost Hunters seasons yet available on DVD, and Season Three: Part 1 just adds to the library of great stuff!

I'm certain that what you see is what you get from TAPS and Ghost Hunters. This set is not my first pick out of the four sets available so far, but it's excellent all the same. If you're a first time watcher, I'd either get Seaon Two: Part 2 or the complete Season One set to get acquainted with the show and all the people on it.

What's particularly awesome about this set is that TAPS goes to Europe for the first time, and they get to see that the locations are much older and often much more active than those in the United States. They had such luck, in fact, that a new GH International show begins airing in January of 2008.

I really like Gary, the investigator and member of the TAPS family who joins them in Ireland. He's got some different methods and appears to be quite a bit more superstitious, respectful and maybe fearful of the spirit world, but his different viewpoint adds a new layer to the show's standard formula. Let's hope he's part of the Ghost Hunters International crew!

Highlights in this set are definitely Leap Castle--one of the most haunted locations on the planet--and Lisheen Ruins, both places are in Ireland. Also, the best of the Stanley Hotel show is fantastic, as is the Bird Cage Theater, though some of that isn't on camera as much as it is just exciting to hear what they saw.

Sue me, I believe them.

I'm a mega GH fan, so I recommend all of the seasons, and this one has some really great stuff on it.

BELOW IS WHAT I'VE PASTED IN ALL MY GH REVIEWS:

Whether you're a believer, a skeptic or on the fence, do yourself a favor and watch this show. Some say it's boring in certain episodes, but I think the fact that they don't always get mindblowing evidence, or any for that matter, adds credibility to TAPS. There is no doubt in my mind that what you see is what you get with these guys, though I will warn that the producers/editors/whatever of this show do their best to keep it exciting by adding spooky music sometimes and very often cut in quick flashes of creepy and/or gruesome imagery. Sometimes this annoys me, but I suppose it would be a slow show without it in places.
