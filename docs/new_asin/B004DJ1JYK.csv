4332607,5,B004DJ1JYK,"The master of the Full Moon Cut returns in this wonderful volume 2 containing 4 films.  This set includes # 5 Sword of fire, # 6 Sword of Satan, # 7 The mask of the princess and # 8 Sword of villainy.  The anamorphic widescreen picture is crisp and clean and also looks great on a HD screen.  Not much in extras though, the usual trailers, notes, bios and image galleries.  Raizo is in top form here playing a rogue samurai who's as much a lover as he is a fighter.  If you loved volume 1 then you'll love this one too.",1297641600,4,519,4.049019607843137
4332608,5,B004DJ1JYK,"These four films are going to be quite appreciated by those of us who've been waiting years for these films to finally be remastered and released on DVD format!  If you've ever seen and appreciated japanese cinema from the early 1960s to 1970s and appreciate period samurai films of the japanese culture you will love these DVDs.  AnimEigo has done an outstanding job remastering these films.  Right up there in quality of storyline, cinematography, acting, choreographing, and pacing with the Zatoichi series of samurai films.  Ichikawa Raizo, Misumi Kenji and company always deliver extremely high quality veiwing entertainment.  AnimEigo told me they were going to release the last four films of this twelve film series.  That is great news!",1291593600,3,744,5.2100840336134455

The lead character becoming increasingly debauched, and further cornered by the greatness of his sword skill. A really good samurai sword fight series.

8425402,5,B004DJ1JYK,"I really enjoyed the Sleepy Eyes series.  It's a character driven movie (drama) than it is an action movie.  The fights are few and usually short, no fancy sword work or gratuitous gore (check out the Lone Wolf Cub series if that is what you're looking for).  Raizo Ichikawa also stars in Shinobo no Mono and it's almost the same, except he's a ninja.  Great movies but may not be for everyone.  Can't wait for the final 3rd collection to come out.",1309910400,,448,4.414634146341464
8425403,4,B004DJ1JYK,"This second Sleepy Eyes of Death AnimEigo box set contains movies 5-8 of the 'Nemuri Kyoshiro' series, out of a total of 12 that Raizo Ichikawa made from 1963 until his early death in 1969. The films are:

5. Sword of Fire (1965) - 83'
  Directed by: Kenji Misumi
  Written by: Seiji Hoshikawa
6. Sword of Satan (1965) - 75'
  Directed by: Kimiyoshi Yasuda
  Written by: Seiji Hoshikawa
7. The Mask of the Princess (1966) - 84'
  Directed by: Akira Inoue
  Written by: Seiji Hoshikawa
8. Sword of Villainy (1966) - 79'
  Directed by: Kenji Misumi
  Written by: Daisuke Ito

They are all in color and presented in it's original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, enhanced for 16/9 TVs. The one audio track is Japanese, with optional English subtitles. As usual in AnimEigo, you can choose to have the subtitles with or without translation notes, as well as in two color schemes: plain white or in colors (which would help hearing impaired audiences to tell which character is speaking, but yet they are not proper captions). The only extras are some trailers, image galleries and text screens (bios, program notes). The program notes are informative, better than your average something-to-fill-up-the-extras-section-in-the-cover screen text fare. It would be nicer to have those 'program notes' in a booklet instead. Guess it's cheaper this way.

The transfers are all quite good (not Criterion-good, but mere-mortals quite good). Remastered and progressive. The disc are all DVD-5, but this does not affect the quality of the transfers, given how short the movies are (the longest is 1h 24') and how scarce the extras are. The look quite beautiful, actually.

So, the movies. Why only four stars? 5-stars would go to Yojimbo, or Gojokin, that kind of stuff. Although this movies are very good, they don't reach the levels of those masterpieces by Akira Kurosawa and Hideo Gosha, to name just two. Don't get me wrong, this is studio-era genre film making at its very best. Really talented and skillful directors, technicians and actors churning out two Sleepy Eyes of Death movies each year, plus many of the same people was also involved in making the Zatoichi and Shinobi no Mono and Daimajin series, too. Daiei sure didn't like to waste human capital. Kenji Misumi himself directed 30 movies in the 1960s, including some minor (and not so minor) classic samurai films such as the first Zatoichi or Kiru (both 1962!) or the first two of the Satan's Sword trilogy. Can you imagine some modern day action ""auteur"" *cough, cough, Tarantino, cough* doing that? Those were the days.

I won't go into details about the plots. They all involve some high-ranking, scheming, evil, corrupt, greedy, cruel, and/or sadistic individuals finally getting what they deserve, in a dark world were the poor and innocent get daily trampled upon, ruthlessly killed, raped and exploited, and gold and privilege can buy anything. Ah! if Kyoshiro were to live today, perhaps he would be displaying his full moon cut somewhere near the southern tip of Manhattan Island instead of Tokugawa era Edo. He is kind of a Philip Marlowe style character. A cynic, with quite a weakness for the ladies (not the guy to say no to a payment in kind) and world weary. Initially he doesn't want to get involved in whatever mess he stumbles upon ('I'm just a customer'), but sometimes enough is enough. A man gotta do what a man gotta do, and for this man, a 50 against 1 swordfight is an unfair fight ... for the 50 minions that will get sliced and diced. In the second movie (or 6th), the one about the little bastard boy who is the only heir to a recently deceased dainyo, the body count skyrockets. If you were to have a shot of tequila every time an enemy samurai is mowed down, you would be comatose on the floor 2o minutes into the movie. Of course, yes, eventually he will face the most skilled samurai in the movie's villain's payroll in a duel. The minions will try to step in. The other guy, who is the only one with some residual traces of honor, will tell them to back off, this is him and me. 'I want to see that famous full moon cut of yours', 'Very well, that will be the last thing you will see' It's only chambara, but I like it!",1302220800,13,4194,4.702185792349726
8425404,5,B004DJ1JYK,"AnimeEigo (sp?) did a fantastic job of remastering these films into dvd format.  I have finished watching discs 5 & 6 and am amazed at the clarity of the film.  (I am watching the films on a Panasonic 46"" Plasma HD tv using a Sony blu-ray S770 player.)  The transfer of these films is absolutely wonderful!!!

The ""Sleepy Eyes of Death"" films are, in my opinion, in the same league with the Zatoichi and ""Baby Cart from Hell"" series.  Samurai film making at its best!!!

If you are a Samurai fan, then this series needs to be in your collection.

Thank AnimeEigo!!!",1301788800,,565,4.480392156862745
8425405,5,B004DJ1JYK,"Can a man conceived from the rape of a Japanese woman by a crazed Christian missionary during a Black Mass find true happiness?  Or is Nemuri Kyoshiro doomed to wander forever, with no direction of his own?

Sword of Fire: Nemuri comes upon a woman being chased by a man wielding a sword. She begs him to come to her assistance, as she is justly avenging her husband's death. The man warns Nemuri that if he helps her, he will only disgrace himself, but what does that mean? Afterwards, she takes him to meet the Chief Retainer, Atobe Shogen, who shows him the Execution License. All seems to be in order, but is it really? It seems that Atobe is in cahoots with the local merchants, one in particular being Narumi, the rice merchant. And they have a secret involving  a group of pirates known as the Toba Suigun, whom the Shogun has ordered the Todo clan to completely destroy. Unbeknownst to him, Atobe diverted half of the pirate's confiscated treasure to himself. But it seems that not all the pirates' families have been killed; a few have ended up in Edo. Nemuri finds himself in the thick of things as he contends with the widow Nui, who is not what she appears to be, and the remaining survivors of the pirates. He has to decide when and how to intervene, and he has to figure out just who is telling the truth

Sword of Satan: On a rainy night, Nemuri is approached by a woman who requests that he purchase her for the night. He goes to her home, where he discovers she wears a Noh masks; he demands she remove it. He pays her but leaves rather than sleep with her, not moved by her story. When she kills herself, he wonders if it is some fault of his. He runs into a woman named Orin, whose brother, Banzo the Flying Squirrel, was killed by Nemuri in a fair fight. Orin is determined to get revenge. Nemuri learns that he is mentioned in the dead girl's will--she left him the money he gave her, and her mask. It seems that she always leaves behind a five year old boy who is not her son, but whom she loved like one. His name is Tsurumatsu, and he says he hates samurai. Meanwhile, we learn that the Iwashiro clan is in trouble; if the heir is not in the fief, the clan will be disbanded by the shogunate. Elder Mizuno and chamberlain Kikimura are hardly innocent in this arrangement, and have less than unselfish motives for wanting the boy returned to the clan. Nemuri has sworn to help the boy in any way he can, now his challenge is to go to the fief where he is being held, and return him to Edo, so that he can live as a carpenter, as he desires. It won't be easy - Orin is determined to stop him, and he must contend with the Elder and the fighting men of the clan, not to mention the wiles of women who are determined to waylay him from his true path. Can he reach Iwashiro and rescue the imprisoned youngster?

Mask of the Princess: Remember a crazed daughter of the Shogun who caused a lot of death and mayhem in the first Sleepy Eyes of Death series? Well, she's back and as determined as ever to get her revenge on Nemuri Kyroshiro--she wants his head! As Nemuri seeks the Izutsu's household, he is accosted by a group of men who offer him a fifteen year old virgin! Interestingly, this virgin is in the household he seeks, so he goes along with them, and once there he reveals that he has been invited there by someone named ""Kiku"". As he is being shown the young virgin, who claims to hate samurai, the true purpose of his being lured there is revealed when Nemuri is attacked! His attackers turn out to be the Bushu Hayate group, protectors of Kiku, who is the Shogun's daughter. Nemuri also meets a man named Ten'ma, who says he seeks vengeance and wishes to learn the Full Moon Cut from him, but Nemuri refuses. Nemuri buys the young girl out of her contract, and helps her find a job. In the meantime, a second woman's body has been found, murdered, with a black cross drawn on her lower abdomen, beside a message which reads, ""Nemuri Kyoshiro molested her!"". Nemuri finds himself the object of interest of Constable Heihachi, but he isn't arrested. In order to clear himself, Nemuri goes to Hanjo, to the dojo of the husband of the murdered woman. His name is Akamatsu Kanbei. Kanbei accuses Nemuri of killing his wife and prepares to face Nemuri's Full Moon Cut. But Kanbei has the advantage--he understands how Nemuri's signature style works! When the young girl, Haru, is kidnapped by the crazy princess, it is up to Nemuri to save the day.

Sword of Villainy: What do a child at play, a hairdresser, a dancer, stinky water and a dead sensei all have in common?  They are all elements of the complicated plot facing Nemuri Kyoshiro in this eighth episode of Sleepy Eyes of Death! Nemuri's man Tetsu is a hairdresser who knows how to be in the right place at the right time, telling his friend the tale of a merchant and his family who are tied up while a stranger plays hide and seek with a young girl and searches for something. How does Tetsu know this? Well, he was doing some research of his own, and came away from the storeroom with what he hopes is ""prolonging longevity sake"". He offers Nemuri a cup, but when he pours it for him - phew! It smells awful so he throws it on the ground. Nemuri uses an em ber from his pipe and the liquid flares up! The men try to put it out with water, but it only grows hotter! A quick thinking dancer smothers the flames because she knows the secret - this is no sake, it's stink water from Echigo, and quite combustible! In this episode are wheels within wheels, plots within plots. A group of rebels seeking to gain revenge on behalf of their late sensei, killed in an uprising. Greedy merchants. A woman scorned seeking to get even with the man who used her. Yojimbo with minds of their own. A mad plot to burn Edo to the ground. What can one man--ie Nemuri Kyoshiro--do to avert disaster to over a million people?

Sword of Fire: It's interesting to note how much of an anti-hero Nemuri can be, because at times he can be rather self-serving, only getting involved with something if it suits his own purposes. At other times, he displays a great deal of heart and gentleness. I loved when he told the persistent Narumi (played by the same actor that played Magobei SnakeOnishi in the Hanzo films) that if he persisted in talking to him and ruining his good mood, he'd kill him. I also love the way that women willingly throw themselves at him, even if they do intend him harm afterward. Well, some of them. As for the apparent non-con sen in this one, I have to assume that he realized she wasn't really unwilling, as later events certainly testify. An interesting tale of intrigue and backstabbing. The only thing you can count on is that Nemuri will come out on top.

Sword of Satan: This episode had decided eerie and mysterious overtones, not the least of which was the Black Mass, which Nemuri interrupts. Orin and her shurikens, snakes, sneaky priestesses and an explosives expert - these are just a few of the things in store for him. He is at times a very tortured soul for all his pretended toughness, and the mask of the dead girl haunts him; he wears it on his belt as a reminder of his mission.  One of my favorite lines is when he explains why he wears it: ""The mask is a testament to my twisted and profound karma."" There is nothing simple about Nemuri. This was a good addition to the saga, with an interesting twist at the end. I wonder if that twist will continue into the next episode?

Mask of the Princess: First, regarding the twist of which I spoke in the film before this: there is no evidence of it anywhere in the film. That being said, Kiku is back and determined to defeat Nemuri. It isn't hard to tell why--there is such a thin line between love and hate, and she crosses back and forth across that line at will. The scars on her face are only the outward manifestations of the scars she carries inside, the ones that have made her the crazed, unfeeling person she is now. As one would put down a mad dog, so is this mad woman unable to function with any legitimate purpose in the real world. As usual, women are simply throwing themselves at Nemuri, though not always with pleasant intent. I found his treatment of Haru endearing, despite his appearances to the contrary. But when the chips are down, his first move is to ensure her safety. Some interesting twists in the plot make this an interesting and exciting addition to the series.

Sword of Villainy: Pay particular attention to this one. The shifting POV's and the convoluted plots will confuse you if you don't. There are several threads going on here, plots within plots. The merchants, the yojimbo, the rebels, the dancer. Why is Nemuri mistaken for someone named Sir Kakanosuke? Will Nemuri do the honorable thing? In his own words, he says, ""I am not a respectable man."" And he means it. And yet he takes the time to walk a young child to his home, to make sure he arrives safely. And he expresses the desire that a young lady not stain her hands with blood. Aiken, the handsome leader of the rebels who are determined to avenge Oshio, calls Nemuri a dolt, and adds, ""After all, I'm warped to the core, just like you are."" This is a very complicated but very interesting addition to the series, and only adds more facets to the multi-layered personality of Nemuri. I can understand the multiple POV's - the story couldn't be told coherently otherwise. The question of Nemuri's resemblance is never satisfactorily answered, though.  Hopefully it will be in a different episode.",1298160000,15,9548,4.430523917995444
