3515943,5,B001CQONNG,THIS is one of the best family shows to ever come on television. I absolutely love it. You can watch it with your children and not have to worry about their being ANY inappropriate content. I was soooooooooooooo excited when I saw that they released this on DVD however I was very upset that they have not released the rest of the seasons. PLease hurry and release the rest of the show so i can finish my collection.,1387497600,,416,4.346153846153846
3515944,5,B001CQONNG,"I love twins and these girls are the cutest.  Plus the show is really funny and it really good family entertainment.  And all the co-stars Jackee Harry, Tim Reidare and the one that plays Roger are really fun and hilarious.  I truly hope the remaining season will be published.  I would buy them in a heartbeat.",1382486400,,311,4.5

3515946,5,B001CQONNG,"I have the entire series and I love it. This is a pretty clean show and the humor is great, the acting is fine and the interaction between Ray and Lisa is really funny. Plus Marques as the always trying Roger who never succeeds but never quits trying to hit up either one of the twins is so funny.",1367884800,,297,4.0508474576271185
3515947,5,B001CQONNG,"The interaction  between the adults is just as big a part of this series as the interaction between the kids. Often, there are situations in both of those dynamics in an episode.",1357430400,,178,4.5625
3515948,4,B001CQONNG,"Sister, Sister is one of my favorite shows. I heard that alot of the youtube videos of the series were taken down. I have the 1st and 2nd seasons and they are great and came earlier than expected. I only rated the 1st season 4 stars because I like the later seasons better...4th-6th. Hope this helps.",1354233600,,300,4.375
3515949,5,B001CQONNG,"From the opening scene of the series premiere when Tia, Tamera, Ray, and Lisa first meet in ""The Meeting"", to the Four Tops-Motown tribute (a recurring theme throughout much of the first season of Sister Sister) at the end of ""The Concert"", laughter is a guarantee for everybody in the house!

Much of Season 1 focuses on twins-separated-at-birth-adopted-by-single-parents-then-reunited-by-coincidence, Tia and Tamera getting to know each other as people, and becoming awestruck at their profound differences and similarities.  Much of the former can be said about the girls' adoptive parents, Ray Campbell (Tim Reid) and Lisa Landry (Jackee Harry).  The best episode exemplifying this conflict is ""The Birthday""--when Lisa feels inferior to Ray due to his extravagant birthday treat to the girls and their friend, Sarah (the late Brittney Murphy), in the city of Chicago, and the two parents being forced to share a single hotel room.  Another recurring theme throughout the entire series that begins in ""Cheater Cheater"" and ""The Pimple"" involves the twins switching places (usually at Tamera's insistence) to avoid an unpleasant reality on one or both of their parts.  While this does prove comedic, it also instills an important life lesson about honesty and hard work.

As does the entire premiere season of Sister Sister!  Whether you watched the show when it was on the air or not, you will definitely find yourself a charming, heartwarming, endearing experience in this DVD set.",1339027200,,1486,5.297872340425532
3515960,5,B001CQONNG,"I've been collecting TV shows on dvd lately, mainly shows from my childhood and so fourth. I had tried finding Sister, Sister in local stores but no one even knew that it existed on DVD or where to find it if it was. Im always a little weary about buying stuff online because you never know what condition things may be in but I decided to order it anyway. I received the item in a timely matter. It was new and I watched it as soon as I got in the mail. If you loved Sister, Sister as a kid and would like to have it in your collection I'd suggest you buy it. It was worth it for me.",1313193600,,584,3.875
3515961,4,B001CQONNG,I will always enjoy storylines that have family values and impart character and morals in their children and correct their mistakes with love.,1280016000,,142,5.217391304347826
3515962,1,B001CQONNG,The case this dvd came in was broken and the dvd's weren't in the slots so they were scratched.,1264896000,,95,4.052631578947368

3515964,5,B001CQONNG,"I looked for 13 years, trying to find Sister Sister on DVD for my wife. I even paid a lot of money to a company that was a scam. Now that she has it, things couldn't be better. The warm and loving atmosphere of this sitcom, is perfect for any family. It is not just a ""Black"" program. It is a family program that breaks the color barrier! I recommend Sister Sister for every family out there. I pray that Amazon gets the remaining seasons.

Thank you Amazon.com for making my wife's dream come true!",1232841600,16,499,4.252631578947368

Update: It is now 1/5/09 and I already have it. I got it the other day. I'm glad I got it and I hope more come out soon. I wish it didn't have to cost so much for something that isn't even 5 hours. Oh well it doesn't really matter anyway I got it 30%.",1222560000,2,329,3.445945945945946

8288747,4,B001CQONNG,"While this is a great show, unfortunately it is out of print which is why its being sold for so much money. Luckily, sometime soon the complete series will be released on dvd.",1452038400,,175,4.333333333333333
8288748,5,B001CQONNG,"I love it, this is a great television show, I was really looking for it and found it amazon, however I refuse to pay 30 dollars for a 2 disc season.  There are several popular television shows that are not at all expensive.  Why is it so expensive?",1438992000,,248,4.145833333333333
8288749,5,B001CQONNG,I loved the show when it originally aired on television and I am happy to find it at such a good FAIR price! The one thing I think is pretty sad about this is the third party sellers that inflated the price of this awesome show and a few others beyond reason! $199.00 for a 2 disc DVD is crazy and I feel like the sellers that do this should be banded or items should be block from view. I have been an Amazon buyer for more than a few years now and I hope Amazon one day takes some type of action to help keep the customers to seller market place clear of the scammers and fair to both parties. Don't pay good money to bad DEALERS! Let their items rot on the shelf!!!!,1436918400,,669,3.962962962962963
