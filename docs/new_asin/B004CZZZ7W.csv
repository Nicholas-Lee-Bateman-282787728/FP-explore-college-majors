4331031,5,B004CZZZ7W,Just feeling as a child again.....when I used to spend several hours in front of TV watching 60s movies. Amazing.,1366848000,,113,4.7

4331033,5,B004CZZZ7W,"This is a DVD- R, that means it is a burn of the movie on to a DVD R. It will play on any DVD player. A DVR is what you use to record a movie from your cable provider, nothing to do with this product. Again this movie"" winter a go go""  will play on any DVD player, it is a DVD! This is a great movie by the way with a great theme song, enjoy!",1334966400,3,342,3.4415584415584415
4331034,5,B004CZZZ7W,"This 1965 go-go ski movie set in beautiful lake tahoe was really,cute and fun. The women were beautiful and there was plenty of fun dancing and music scores. Not the greatest movie in the world but just a fun,happy era movie to watch curling up with a cup of hot chocolate!!",1327449600,2,274,4.392156862745098
4331035,3,B004CZZZ7W,"I HAVE BEEN WAITING IN EXCESS OF OVER 20 YEARS TO GET MY HANDS ON A COPY OF THIS MOVIE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO BUY ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT TO GET ONE. I DON'T OWN A DVR. AND I DON'T  KNOW OF ANYONE ELSE WHO DOES EITHER. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS MOVIE IS NOT BEING OFFERED ON DVD, AT THIS TIME, IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM READING. WHAT WERE THE MANUFACTURERS THINKING ABOUT?! OBVIOUSLY NOT THE CONSUMERS. MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A DVR YET. JUST LIKE MOST PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE A DVD PLAYER WHEN DVD'S FIRST CAME ON THE MARKET. I RESISTED BUYING DVD'S AT FIRST BECAUSE I HAD BOUGHT SO MANY MOVIES ON VHS, I FINALLY RELENTED AFTER I GOT WIND OF THE FACT THAT DVD'S HAVE EXTRAS ON THEM AND CAN BE SET UP TO CONTINUOUSLY PLAY. NOT TO MENTION THAT THEY LAST ALOT LONGER THAN VHS TAPES. AND THERE ISN'T THE WORRY OF THEM TANGLING UP IN THE PLAYER. NOW US DVD PLAYER OWNERS CAN ONLY HOPE THAT COPIES ON DVD WILL BECOME AVAILABLE TO US SO THAT WE CAN ENJOY THIS MOVIE TOO. NOW, ON TO THE MOVIE ITSELF, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BEACH MOVIES SET IN THE WINTER TIME. THERE ARE 2 OTHERS: ""SKI PARTY"" AND ""WILD WILD WINTER"". THIS IS THE ONLY ONE BETWEEN THE 3 THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN IN IT'S ENTIRETY. THOUGH WHAT I SAW I ENJOYED AND IT INSTANTLY TOOK ME BACK TO THE BEACH MOVIES OF THE ""60'S"". I AM AN AVID COLLECTOR AND FAN OF ALL OF THOSE SUN, SAND AND SURF MOVIES, HOWEVER I ENJOYED THE ONE'S SET DURING THE WINTER TIME MORE. PROBABLY BECAUSE I ENJOY SNOW. I REALLY WISH I CAN SAY MORE ABOUT THIS MOVIE, BUT DUE TO THE FACT THAT I HAVE ONLY SEEN THE VERY END OF IT, BY CHANCE, I CAN'T HONESTLY GIVE MY OPINION ABOUT THIS MOVIE, EXCEPT THAT THE ENDING IS ENJOYABLE, IF YOU ARE INTO THESE SORTS OF MOVIES. I GAVE THIS MOVIE 3 STARS BECAUSE I LOVE BEACH MOVIES REGARDLESS OF WHAT SEASON THEY ARE SET IN. SO WHEN YOU GET YOUR COPY, CURL UP WITH SOME HOT COFFEE, OR HOT COCOA AND ENJOY.",1311465600,2,1872,4.018766756032171
