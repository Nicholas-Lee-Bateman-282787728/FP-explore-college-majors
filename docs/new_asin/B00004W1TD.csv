8376113,3,B00004W1TD,"A Lone Star John Wayne and two Republics (without gunfighters, famous or otherwise).THE DESERT TRAIL (1935): Cowboy Wayne and his equally womanizing tinhorn gambler friend are wanted for a rodeo robbery/murder actually committed by the weak-willed brother (Paul Fix) of the pretty proprietress (original Our Gang kid Mary Kornman) for whom both men are competing. RIDE RANGER RIDE (1936): It's the Texas Rangers vs. the US Army when cavalry Lt. Gene Autry is courtmartialed, immediately bouncing back in the Rangers where he's framed for the murders of two renegade Comanche prisoners. Comedy relief by Max Terhune, whose continual racist pronouncements are never disputed by friend Autry, and by Smiley Burnette: a hairbrained running gag has Burnette perpetually fleeing--to everyone's amusement--from knife-wielding Chief Thundercloud after Terhune wagers Smiley's scalp on the outcome of a horserace! ROLL ON TEXAS MOON (1946): In the contempory West, Roy Rogers--portraying not himself, but a character with that name--investigates attacks on Dale Evans' sheep ranch to avert a bloody feud with cattle ranchers. Too cloying is Dale's pet lamb's attachment to annoyed, but softhearted Gabby Hayes.",990057600,9,1201,5.677777777777778
