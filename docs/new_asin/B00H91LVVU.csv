6141707,1,B00H91LVVU,Good plot but bad acting. Waste of my monies.  I am finding that the ratings for the movies on amazon are not to be believed.  I don't know what show the rest of you saw but this was a lousy movie.,1397260800,2,197,3.7804878048780486
6141708,1,B00H91LVVU,Getting through the first minute was a struggle. The music was trite beyond belief. The direction was noticeably boring. At the ten minute mark I did something I've never done before. I called Amazon and asked for a refund.,1396742400,,223,4.743589743589744
6141709,4,B00H91LVVU,Enjoyed the movie.  Uncomplicated plot...reminded me of Taken.  English accent was understandable and that was a plus for me.  Good with a bowl of popcorn!,1394582400,6,155,5.12
6141710,4,B00H91LVVU,"Very interesting.

Love movie surprises - in my experience they're uncommon. And it's been nearly a year since my last sip of cool water across the parched retread-filled desert called modern entertainment.

Rented this in the thought that, since the cover art showcased a pair of actors that I generally enjoy, Jason Patric and the legendary James Caan - I would find a halfway decent B-movie boilerplate to pass the night. But surprise, surprise - neither are the star of this vehicle.

No, that falls to UK actor Craig Fairbrass. And he was actually pretty good in the lead. No, I take that back, he was very good. Never heard of the actor prior to screening this flick - now I'm going to be searching out his other projects.

Tells the story of Lex Walker, formerly of the British Army, now currently employed as a private contractor posted to the middle east. And Walker has just received the worst kind of news - his only child has died from a drug overdose. Quickly followed by heartless company orders to continue his current assignment. His ""personal issues"" aren't their problem.

Stunned at their callousness, he gives notice by way of a verbal resignation with the emphasis on the fornication of his superior and their employer, preferably one with the other. He's going home to put his little girl to rest. But sadly, even more grief is laid upon his broad shoulders. Upon his return to England, Walker learns that her remains never arrived home - they're still in Los Angeles.

Dad is through messing about - he's going to personally bring her home. And maybe knock-in some heads for good measure.

But he soon discovers not everything is as it seems.

First, the remains tagged with his girl's name aren't hers. Second, her employer is altogether too wired to be a straight businessman; Walker can smell the stink of death emanating from the slick polished exterior. And third, it turns out his daughter was involved in some serious black market naughtiness.

Tight, if predictable, action flick with Fairbrass bruising his way into and across the American landscape.

A solid and enjoyable lower tier four.

Movie Note:

- Director Brian A. Miller is a talented filmmaker. Hope someone with serious fiscal means sees the potential and gives him a chance to work on a larger stage. Ditto praise goes to the eternal James Caan who, in my opinion, cannot deliver a poor performance. Add Jason Patric, Shannon Elizabeth, and Johnny Messner providing outstanding supporting roles; each possessing the right kind of quality cinematic presence.

Credit goes to both performers and director for this fun flick.

Personal Note:

- My single gripe would be with Melissa Ordway as Samantha. Drop-dead gorgeous, no question. But why in the world does she have an American accent? <smh>

It's a B-Movie.

Right, almost forgot that for a second while enjoying Fairbrass kicking ass across L.A. <g>",1392508800,13,2899,4.883673469387755
6141711,2,B00H91LVVU,Craig Fairbrass is pretty good and definitely a screen presence. The script was laughable and as a cop it was really absurd to me.,1416268800,,130,4.458333333333333

6141714,2,B00H91LVVU,I'm glad I didn't have to pay more than 2.99 for this movie.  The estranged father received word that his daughter was killed. Upon reviewing a body he learns that the person on the slab is not his daughter. He goes to the local police and they are refusing to help. He goes on his own and search and finds his daughter and in doing so destroys the bad guys.  The action was mediocre the acting was terrible. I think Jason Patric could use another vampire movie,1411689600,,461,4.287356321839081

8631030,3,B00H91LVVU,"Some Writer/Directors prefer to use the same actors in their films. You can't blame them for wanting to work with people they're comfortable with, but not many Writer/Directors, remake the exact same movie with a slightly different twist. Brian A. Miller came out of relative obscurity to produce the hit action thriller, The Prince, starring Bruce Willis. Less than a year later, he followed it up with The Outsider, which is basically the exact same film! The Prince featured a former mafia turncoat, going to the city he once owned, in order to find his missing daughter. The Outsider features a former member of British Special Ops, coming to America, to find his missing daughter. Both films have similar endings, mafia bosses that are played by legendary action stars, and oddly enough, both films have a cameo by 50 cent. These two films are literally so similar to one another, that aside from the British accent, and Jason Patric in the role of the cop, nothing has really changed. As a fan of action film, I realize there aren't many different directions these films can go in, but to release what amounts to the exact same film, a year later, with several of the same actors, is just bizarre. The Outsider wasn't a bad film, and I did enjoy Craig Fairbrass, he was a beast, who I was previously unfamilar with, but aside from that, this is the exact same story as seen in The Prince. Wheather you chose to sit through this one or that one, really depends on who you like better, James Caan or Bruce Willis.",1449360000,,1517,4.643122676579925
8631031,4,B00H91LVVU,"This movie was neither brilliant not horrible.  Sam, daughter of British mercenary soldier Walker, finds out the company she works for is involved with identity theft.

Walker, while on assignment on the Sandbox, is told his daughter is dead.  When the body is shipped back to the UK, Walker finds that the body is not that is his daughter.

Walker comes to the Los Angeles to figure out what happened to his daughter.  Using phone records, Walker traces his daughter's last calls to her former place of business headed by Mr. Schuuster, played by James Caan.  Schuuster and his goons want Sam dead.

The big scene happens when Dad, Sam and Sam's boyfriend head to Schuuster's Beverly Hills home to kick butt, take names and rip him off.  To say how would be to spoil the ending.

Overall, the acting was mediocre but the story and action kept things going.",1422662400,,857,4.66

8631035,1,B00H91LVVU,"Man. I was lured in by the James Caan name. Boy, was i disappointed. lousy DP, not so great editing, and story was zzzzzzz not super-disappointed, but .. just nearly just under super disappointed. If I'd not been invested  $3.99 i would have click out 20 minutes in.

Sadly, not what i was hoping for.

I'd watch ""The Way of the Gun"" if you've not seen it, instead time much better spent, and a performance worthy of the James Caan name.",1420070400,,437,4.37037037037037
