If you grew up on  Scooby-Doo every Saturday morning for years like I did, you owe it to yourself to get these videos. They are all classic, no Scrappy or  any other stuff. These are the real videos. Also, if you have a dvd player,  Amazon is offering the first 5 episodes on dvd as well. Long live Scooby  -Doo.......",951955200,10,387,4.260273972602739

7862601,4,6304140762,"I will begin by saying a whole box of Scooby snakcs for Shaggy, Scooby Doo, and Scooby Dum! That's how good this tape is. The 1st episode has the luxury of being based on a classic horror. Like good horror, it starts normal, but there are incidents on the sooner side. There is some wonderful chemistry between Velmah, Scooby Doo, Scooby Dum, and Shaggy. Shaggy's comical and famous lines from his fear are there: ""I'll remember this Halloween for the rest of my life....That is...if I have a rest of my life."" The scene with Scooby Doo, Shaggy, and Scooby Dum and the 'Headless Horseman' is hilarious: ""This head hasn't worker right since the day I got it.  Mr. Headless Horseman, you'd be very unhappy with this head."" The mislead is well placed, as well as the 'bad guy's' slips. There is also a good alternation between normal scenes and creepy scenes. Some other good humor is Shaggy's possible useful clue: ""Aliens land at convention. The headless horseman is from outerspace."" Finally, the solution and motive is on the plausible side. As good as this 1st episode is, the 2nd follows it quite well. It starts normal enough, but an eerie presence is there. The misleads are well done. We are also given time to wonder what the 'bad guy's' motives are. We are made nervous around innocent characters while we are relaxed around potentially dangerous characters. The chases are suspenseful as well as comical. And ofcourse Shaggy's one liners are there: ""I gave at the blood bank."" The solution is plausible and a little stronger than other episodes. Rather than just saying to ourselves: ""The bad guy is found out and going to jail,"" we should at times feel a little upset when we discover who the villain is. True horror exists when not from a stranger wearing a mask, but being betrayed by someone we really we felt we could trust. Since vampires are in this episode (in a way) I can use this example. The Gary Oldman ""Dracula"" tries (AND FAILS) to be scary by making him a grotesque monster. The Frank Langella ""Dracula"" tries and (SUCCEEDS) to be scary by making him very human. REALITY CHECK! The more human and plausible something is, the more scary it is. This is one of Scooby's best tapes. Don't miss it.",1005436800,11,2218,4.658163265306122
7862602,5,6304140762,"This has to be the BEST Scooby episode ever made.  The writing is superb.  You feel like you are actually there experiencing the fear along with Shaggy and Scooby.
The most amazing part of all is the uncanny resemblance of Ichabod Crane and John.  You almost can't tell them apart.  If it wasn't for this episode being a cartoon, you wouldn't be able to!
The artist must have used a picture of John to create the physical character.  They look like twins.
Amazeing, simply amazeing.
We now thrilled to have a new nickname for John.  Thanks Scooby creators!",1001289600,5,556,4.622448979591836
