A young man begins acting in violent manners and, in turn, comes under the care of a  psychologist and the suspicion of the cops. His mothering sister tries to  find an explanation for his behavior but isn't quite willing to except the  one she is given, that her brother has been possessed by the spirit of a  serial killer.

Maclaine is fantastic in her role, bringing complexity to a part that could easily have been played as an over-the-top snob. JOEL DELANEY is an example of 1970s cinema at its dark, politically incorrect best! Made at a time when it seemed like all directors were taking risks and trying new things, this movie takes horror in a direction that few would attempt today.

452718,4,6302287413,"If you're on this page, you pretty much know what the plot is all about, but the movie is still worth seeing for its slow pace and uncomfortable atmosphere. You may have to enjoy the old 70s movie feel in order to fully appreciate this one. I always find it interesting that Shirley MacClaine was going to star in ""The Exorcist"" but that did not pan out. Anyway, this is a much more subtle kind of movie that people remember nowadays mostly for that horrific dance number near the end (which, by the merciful grace of God, has been panned and scanned out on this new DVD issue). The picture is quite good, and I detected no trouble with the sound presentation...it is a bit deplorable that these classic films are arriving without any extras because quite frankly there should be something available to offer DVD consumers in terms of this content; I would even welcome a commentary track by a film historian, something. Other than that, though, this is your chance to own this rare, subtle horror film on a quality DVD format.",1355097600,,1027,4.586956521739131
452719,5,6302287413,"This movie should have cult viewing status. It is wonderful in the way it slowly but surely cranks up the tension, and keeps the viewer rivetted to their seats. It is obviously a little dated, but so many modern horror movies could learn so much from the psychological terror that builds in this one, without relying on gratuitous gore.

Sadly this movie seems all but forgotten. A few reviewers here raise issues of whether it is cut or not (this is the full, uncut movie. It may be that scenes have been cropped, but if they have, few people will notice or care). Other than that there is not nearly enough discussion of how good this movie is.",1340841600,,646,4.47457627118644
452720,5,6302287413,"Great movie, a classic horror film. it is about a man Joel Delaney who becomes possessed by the spirit of a brutal serial killer. His
sister watches as he goes from being mild mannered, kind, and fun loving and becomes something dark, sinister, and sadistically cruel
and brutal. The killer who's spirit now possesses Joel in life would cut a womens head off and hang it from it's hair. This film is
mild compared to the exorcist but has it's level of scaryness in a classic way",1324944000,,478,4.505747126436781
452721,3,6302287413,"Having seen this film when it first came out, I remembered being thoroughly upset by it, and being impressed by Shirley Maclaine's and debutant Perry King's acting. What I hadn't remembered were any of the details. Seeing it again thirty-nine years later, my memory of strong acting proves accurate, but this film takes an extremely long time to build, finally focusing only about three fourths of the way through with an intense Santoria exorcism ritual and culminating in a final scene of the most lacerating emotional and physical violence. (Certainly the most disturbing scene of its type in American film up to that time.)The film contains many sequences that were to become cliches of the genre over many years, but in many of them it can claim to be the first exemplar. THE EXORCIST, THE FAN(The Lauren Bacall, James Garner one) and even JURASSIC PARK (Has there ever been a scene in another film where children are kept in danger for such a long time ?) come most immediately to mind.
This film is a cautious recommend. It is way too slow, and the Santoria scene and the final scene may prove too intense for many viewers.
Violence, nudity , profanity and sexual situations.",1305590400,,1182,4.799019607843137
452722,4,6302287413,"Between the more well-known early years of Shirley MacLaine's career and the latter middle-aged-oscar winning period, there were a few smaller films that fell through the cracks of the early seventies. This being one of them. Shirl was in full dramaturge mode at this time, leaving behind the kooky-comedienne she had become known for. Which might explain the less popular response to this period. Of course they were mostly small fims at this time with obtuse, or genre based stories and plots. TPOJD shows a haughty,society dame type portrayl by the actress. And with a very young Perry King playing her MUCH loved wastrel brother. Without too much plot detail Perry/Joel gets possessed by a dead Puerto Rican pal, and it's left to Shirley to get him the help he needs to banish the bad spirit. Suffice to say Hi-Jinks ensue! After much Santaria voodoo mumbo-jumbo(actually the scariest scene!)...well, and a few lopped off noggins,(BAAAD Special effects there!), Shirl and her brats are held hostage at her beach house by a PR spouting Joel. Ooooo scary!!Predictable ending reminded me of the last scene in Trilogy of Terror ep. with Karen Black and the Zuni fetish doll. only THAT was scarier!
Meh.

452723,2,6302287413,"I had read this book when it was originally published many years ago and quite enjoyed it.  Just recently rented the DVD and was not too happy with it, even though it does stick pretty closely to the original storyline.

As I recall, the main character was more sympathetic and likeable than as played by Shirley MacLaine.  The book also did a much better job of explaining how Joel became possessed.  But the main problem with this movie is the last third or so.  The abuse of the children was stomach-turning and much more extreme and dragged-out than I remembered in the book.  I almost felt as if I were watching child pornography.  Or perhaps reading about this part did not make as big an impact as seeing it acted out.  As far as the ending, that is totally, totally different.

452724,3,6302287413,"Before THE EXORCIST there was Joel Delaney.  Steeped in early 70s psychedelia, this meandering tale features an unexpected Shirley MacLaine as a snooty New Yorker whose hippie brother Perry King (in his film debut) starts exhibiting bizarre violent behavior.
The movie examines clashing cultures prevalent then and features a controversial climax featuring Shirley's 13 year old son.

452737,2,6302287413,"The Possession of Joel Delaney (Waris Hussein, 1972)

I find it somewhat odd that of Ramona Stewart's extensive library, only two novels have ever been adapted into film. Her 1946 novel Desert Town was made into the Burt Lancaster vehicle Desert Fury the year afterwards, and 1970's The Possession of Joel Delaney was hustled into theaters in 1972. Banned in Finland and rated X in Britain (both for one fraction-of-a-second shot, but it points out the difference between 1972 and now, when filmmakers will think nothing of shaving twenty minutes from a movie in order to get an R rating), the movie gained instant notoriety, but when it comes right down to it, this is pretty much a standard possession flick that probably would have faded into obscurity quickly were it not for that fraction of a second. Who said Hussein didn't know what he was up to?

The title character (The Day After Tomorrow's Perry King in his first film role) comes from serious money, but after a trip abroad has decided to live the bohemian lifestyle, getting himself an apartment in the East Village and hanging out with folks his uptight sister Norah (Shirley MacLaine) would certainly consider undesirables. She's right in at least one case, a chap named Tonio Perez, who's definitely involved with the darker side of the spirit world. (I'm pretty sure the title tells you all you need to know from here.) When Joel starts changing, and a friend of his ends up dead and decapitated like three women who died the year before in Central Park (when Joel was overseas), Norah starts to get with the idea that perhaps Joel is, in fact, possessed, and has to figure out what to do about it.

I still can't get over the fact that that's Shirley MacLaine. Seriously? Tremendous job by make-up, costuming, etc. And kudos to Hussein for not cutting that fraction of a second that caused such controversy (and so many critical brickbats) at the time of its release. Stephen King famously said in 1994 that were this movie released today, it would be slapped with an NC-17, and he's probably right. In fact, I'm kind of surprised no one got arrested. But when it comes right down to it, the scene in question is cemented by its context, and could be easily passed off as an editorial slip. There's no denying the power of the context (as the scene comes within the final fifteen minutes, I can't say much about it without major spoilers), and in fact that final fifteen minutes is the best part of the film, which is otherwise rather dull. The Possession of Joel Delaney may have been the first major Hollywood film to have possession as its central theme, but The Exorcist, which appeared a few months later, was the first film to really do it right. The acting is decent, naturally, given the caliber of the cast, but when it comes right down to it, there's not much about Joel Delaney that's all that scary. Nice twist at the end, and while it's about as graceful as a mallet to the back of the skull, for Hollywood it's subtly-done. Worth seeing at this late date as more a curiosity than anything else, and a must-see for anyone interested in the history of Hollywood horror films, but casual fright-flick fiends aren't missing much if they pass it over for something meatier. **",1252540800,2,3254,4.665505226480836

452739,5,6302287413,"Predating ""The Exorcist"", ""Joel Delaney"" is the story of wealthy, grating Manhattan socialite Norah Benson (Shirley MacLaine), whose relationship with her brither Joel Delaney (Perry King) is a mite too close.  When not busy treating her maid like the furniture and attending the sort of party where someone exclaims that her butler was simply appalled she had taken the bus, Norah start to notice that Joel is acting strangely.  Soon after, heads start to roll.

MacLaine is brilliant in this, forcing the audience to care for what is in essence a very unlikeable heroine: Norah is an inveterate snob, an egomaniac (she seems to think that everyone from her ex-husband to her ex-maid should drop everything to come to her aid immediately) and has a relationship with her brother that borders on incestuous.  Shirley still draws you in, showing the basic goodness and humanity in Norah.  A very young Perry King is also very good here, flitting from sweetness to madness in a blink.

Almost more of a paen to mid-seventies urban paranoia than a straight thriller, ""PoJD"" makes good use of New York of the era.  Never before or since has the city looked more threatening, from the tony Upper East Side to the East Village and Spanish Harlem, this New York fairly drips with menace.  This is the Anti- ""Manhattan""",1212537600,11,1311,4.873873873873874
452740,5,6302287413,"Shirley MacLaine plays Nora, an aloof, privileged, divorced mother of two living in Manhattan. She's kept herself emotionally and socially distant from people and things she considers beneath her status. But when her beloved younger brother Joel (Perry King) begins having a severe and frightening personality change after moving into an apartment previously inhabited by a now deceased young serial killer, she's forced to confront realities she's hardly prepared to deal with. Then murders similar to the serial killer's occur. Racial undertones (the killer was Puerto Rican) and the occult blend somewhat uneasily in the film, but this is balanced by the truly creepy atmosphere, the acting and some disturbing sequences that made my skin crawl. The final sequence at the beach house is shocking. This is a horror film that is not for all tastes. For instance, there's a hint or two that Nora's feelings for Joel may go beyond just brother & sister. Also Nora's character is not your usual horror film heroine. She isn't very sympathetic. She's spoiled, indifferent and used to getting her way. So it's no surprise to find she's way in over her head right off the bat. MacLaine and King are good and make the often questionable material engrossing to watch. All in all, an interesting adult horror film from 1972 with potent social and supernatural themes. Definitely worth a look.",1207958400,8,1384,5.074561403508772
452741,4,6302287413,"Shirley MacLaine in one of her scariest (and compelling) roles. She's a Manhattan socialite and single mom living with her two kids. Her brother (played by Perry King) moves into an apartment once rented by a Puerto Rican teen murderer, and suddenly he begins acting as if possessed by the dead murderer. Things become unbearable for MacLaine as she tries to protect her kids (and herself) while trying to figure out what's going on with King. It's made even scarier because MacLaine has lived a sheltered, pampered life - up to then. The ending takes place in a deserted beach house, and it's one not to be forgotten soon after seeing it. Lots of people object to the gross-out final scenes (myself included), but the build-up to them is done grippingly and with a great deal of suspense. A fine thriller, and it's surprising to see it's not on DVD yet.",1147737600,6,854,4.662251655629139

452744,4,6302287413,"As a fan of horror, I figured I would give this movie a viewing.  As you guessed it, the movie concerns possession, but also goes into the 70s culture and seems to pass judgment on the rich.  How's that for a horror film?
Shirley MacLaine plays a New York socialite who raises her two children and looks after her brother.  Both come from a rich background.  Her brother, Joel Delaney, tries to attack his landlord and is taken away raving like a madman.  MacLaine, not understanding, proceeds to the psychiatric hospital and starts throwing her ex-husband's name around.  After pulling some strings, the brother is released.  The rest of the movie brings the gruesome murders for which her brother is now a suspect.  He also begins speaking dreadful things in Spanish, but no one remembers him learning fluent Spanish.
The movie is set in the 70s, and the movie tries to show the collision between the Puerto Rican culture and the rich socialite culture.  The possession happens when a strong-minded personality takes control of the weak-minded.  The movie seems to say that the rich, who did not make the money themselves, are not strong-minded because everything has been given to them.  The other issue is that Western science cannot understand something like this.  We need the help of a culture older than ours.
Shirley MacLaine is infuriating and frustrating.  My first reaction was that I couldn't watch this movie because her character grated on my nerves.  After reflecting, I realized that that is exactly what she was trying to do with her role.  I have to tip my hat to her performance.
Although not a horror classic like Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist, this is an interesting movie.  I would recommend it for horror fans.",1053475200,31,1736,4.8338983050847455

7824224,3,6302287413,"When the doll Chucky becomes possessed in the Childs Play movie series  the results are sometimes frightening and suspenseful. Ironically, when a similar thing happens to the human in this movie  the results are illogical. Worse than illogical, the proceedings sometimes become downright silly.

Worse than silly, the outcome of this possession is tinged with racism. This movie was made in 1972. Its unlikely that it could be made with the same plot and characters today. Theres just too much ethnic stereotyping that pops up in the course of the action. Theres also a gratuitous, unlikely, and disturbing, later scene that was controversial and almost got the movie a prohibitive rating when it first came out.

Shirley MacClaine does a good job portraying a woman who is slipping into becoming a self-absorbed Park Avenue matron  except for her somewhat incestuous love for her brother. Perry King, in his first starring role, does project a menacing cruelty. But they just don't have much to work with in this unprepossessing film.",1464307200,,1035,5.100591715976331

I saw it in the theater when it first appeared in the early 1970's and picked up a videotape version of it once it made it into the Video rental shops.  I always hoped it would eventually be released on DVD -- and voila! it finally did.  On the plus side, the film offers a couple of the most shocking moments I've ever seen on film (and I've seen them all!) -- and, overall, the acting, the setting, the whole atmosphere is close to perfect. The horror aspects and the accompanying shocks are particularly intense due to the very mature storyline, adult-like setting, and intelligent dialog that characterizes the early part of the film and sets us somewhat at ease -- and not prepared for the sudden onset of horror.  This is in opposition to the common teenage slasher flick nonsense which tries to shock with non-stop bloodletting.  The only complaint I have is the sequence depicting the removal of the voodoo curse. This sequence is far too long and actually becomes boring after several minutes of mumbo-jumbo incantations.  But aside from that one criticism, the remainder of the film is about as scary & shocking as anything I've ever seen.  Also ""Possesion of Joel Delaney"" is reminiscent of ""The Believers"", another Santeria based horror film set in New York -- and offering a very similar atmosphere centered around modern voodoo practice and its destructive affects on a family.",1429747200,,1434,4.781376518218623
