2436477,5,B000BQ5IXC,I personally got to view the movie way before its release and quite proud of Mr. Irving (Pookie). From beginning to end the documentary is riveting and makes you feel as if you yourself know the inmates personally. It's definitely a must have. Job well done!,1130803200,11,258,4.630434782608695
2436478,5,B000BQ5IXC,"Excellent documentary. I was especially moved by the realism of the film. And I have to say I am proud to be a colleague of Daniel Jensen (one of the featured chain gang members) having worked in the same communities with him in the field of addiction.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a real world view of prison, addiction, and how rehabilitation does and does not work.",1507593600,3,384,4.485714285714286
2436479,5,B000BQ5IXC,"Even though it is twenty years old, the problems addressed have survived and gotten worse. A great look into the US prison system.",1507593600,3,130,4.695652173913044
2436480,5,B000BQ5IXC,"10 out of 10 would recommend to someone who wants to watch a great documentary. It really shows how ineffective using punishment is. It sends home a great message that rehabilitation and help will always be a better route to take, in efforts of keeping people from returning to institutions.",1507593600,3,291,4.84
2436481,4,B000BQ5IXC,"This award-winning documentary profiles the experiences of the prisoners and officers of the recently revived male chain gang and the world's first female chain gang. It examines the conditions of these people as they participate in these intense and highly controversial programs and the impact of chaining inmates during forced labor. Irving's camera's follow two officers and five prisoners before, during and after their release from the chain gang. This insightful reveal of what goes on in our modern-day prison system with the reinstatement of the chain gang is brutal, honest and eye-opening.",1370822400,3,600,5.462365591397849
2436482,3,B000BQ5IXC,"Perhaps I've spent too much time watching true crime, but I didn't think that ""American Chain Gang"" was all that great. It's not a bad way to spend an hour, but I felt that others covered these issues in the past.

American Chain Gang focuses on the prison ""chain gangs"" in Alabama and Arizona during the 1990s. The Alabama chain gang members are male, while those in Arizona are female. The filmmakers use their time to tell the stories of the inmates on the chain gangs; the issue of whether chain gangs are effective as a deterrent to crime is a secondary issue.

I thought the lack of focus on the chain gangs was a major drawback in this film. While the interviews with the prisoners were interesting, none of the prisoners had any great insights. The filmmakers updated what had happened to the inmates at the end of the film; I don't want to include any spoilers, but few of the inmates had seen the light and gone into living productive lives. The film also includes a number of interviews with guards who work on the chain gangs. Some of the guards have interesting insights and they tell some frightening anecdotes about prison life.

I would rate American Chain Gang above average. The other Amazon reviewers seem to think that it is a terrific film - judge for yourself.",1259539200,,1282,4.565217391304348
2436483,5,B000BQ5IXC,"Amazing view of the life behind bars and on the chain.  I didn't know that prisons still did this.  Whatever your view of this issue, this film will grip you from the moment you meet the prisoners.  I agree, the ending is very strong.  The officers are remarkably articulate and carry you through this film.  See it after Cool Hand Luke.",1151539200,4,337,4.459016393442623
2436484,5,B000BQ5IXC,"Amazing what we do in this country. Inmates are aware of what we are doing to them - warehousing them and letting them out with no job training, counseling, or education. Chain Gangs are meant to make us feel good about punishing these people, but this film shows what those types of programs are really about. Wanted to see more.  Loved the letters from prison.",1138147200,7,362,4.569230769230769
2436485,5,B000BQ5IXC,"This documentary tells the story of re-instituted chain gangs  simply and with compassion. All parties are given a chance to express their viewpoints - with some surprising results. The film is gritty and engrossing, but never preachy. Guaranteed to make you think again about what we as a society hope to accomplish when we send men and women to prison.",1138060800,8,354,4.9
2436486,5,B000BQ5IXC,"Been looking for this one for years.  Great access to inmates and prison guards.  We get to know these young adults as they go through the humiliation of this 'alternative thinking unit.'  The women in the Arizona chain gang are a great compliment to the hardened men in Alabama.  This issue has faded from the news, but the film really gives you the big picture.  The ending is a real eye-openner.  GREAT FILM!",1132617600,10,411,4.561643835616438
2436487,5,B000BQ5IXC,"No matter what your political or personal affiliation, you will find something that you love and something that will challenge you in this film.  Taking you from the formidable living conditions of the prisoners in chain gang to the fear and frustration of prison guards, this film covers the complexity of the american prison systems and our controversial approach to dealing with recidivism.  The ending will astound everyone.  Be sure to check out the letters from the inmates to the filmmaker that illustrate their desperation and unwavering hope (you will need to put the dvd into your pc in order to view letters).",1132444800,12,620,5.0
8090804,5,B000BQ5IXC,"This is a somewhat boring liberal biased documentary attempting to disparage the use of chain gangs, of which they make a very weak case. I gave the film 5 stars for one reason - I was stunned by a segment near the end of the film by one particular update on one of the featured inmates, and I am not stunned very easily. You will see a 180 degree change by this person, including demeanor, temperament, even vocabulary. It's rare to see this type of change, but it does happen as witnessed in this film. Good luck young man.
They need to do an hour documentary on Daniel's life and exactly how he was able to make this extraordinary transition. It might be of great value to modeling a rehab system.",1524528000,,700,4.351145038167939
8090805,5,B000BQ5IXC,"This is a great 1999 documentary about prison chain gangs that's made even more satisfying by the addition of new (2017) footage that follows up on the lives of some of the inmates. I'd seen the film many years ago, and I was interested to re-watch it and see the new footage.

The opening scene, in which the inmates are chained up at the start of a work day, immediately sucks you in. Then I remembered why I liked the film so much the first time: the filmmakers have a knack for picking the most interesting and compelling inmates & guards and eliciting thoughtful interviews from them. The film is also expertly edited so that you stay sucked in for the entire hour.

I thought following home one of the guards was an especially smart move from the filmmakers -- a great example of how they worked to give a very thorough portrait of the chain gangs.

The hour running time goes by fast -- the sign of a well-made, compelling documentary -- and the film stays with you.",1520467200,2,973,4.424581005586592
8090806,5,B000BQ5IXC,Wow. Such a powerful story. I never knew that there were female chain gangs existing in the US and the entire back story of how it came to be. I feel like I've been living on another planet... This Film really stirs up so many emotions and begs questions that need to be answered. Its very sad that this is happening but thanks to the filmmaker for shedding a beacon of light on this issue. Very well done. Totally recommend watching it. You won't be disappointed.,1518048000,,464,4.406976744186046
8090807,4,B000BQ5IXC,"Wow. Low budget, yes -- but extremely well done despite budgetary limitations. Some interesting images like a grasshopper resting on a bullet cartridge. Almost like a nature documentary -- the chain gang in its unnatural habitat.",1516147200,2,229,5.388888888888889
8090808,5,B000BQ5IXC,As one of those patients it speaks about in the end of the movie I for one can attest to the strength and resilience of Daniel Jensen. If not for him and the program he is affiliated with there is no doubt I would be incarcerated right now. Instead I owe this man much gratitude for the blessings I have in my life today. Today I am a father a husband a co worker and this film really reminds me why. Thank you Xackery Irving for making this film and thank you Daniel Jensen for being a part of the documentary and a part of my story as well.,1508630400,5,542,3.981651376146789
8090809,5,B000BQ5IXC,"Amazing film by Xackery Irving!  This is an important documentary about the revival of Chain Gangs, which were originally created to replace slave labor lost after emancipation.  Honest, provocative and insightful look at our prison system.  It's a must see for anyone wanting a deeper understanding of the failures of incarceration in the U.S.",1508025600,2,344,5.333333333333333
8090810,5,B000BQ5IXC,"Poignant. Clear and cutting portrayal of the issues surrounding the re-institution of the chaingang in Alabama and Arizona. I would recommend this film to anyone, especially teachers, looking to explore the complexities of incarceration in our country. As a rabbi I would show it in my synagogue, and would encourage other of my clergy colleagues to do the same. Well done!",1508025600,2,373,5.131147540983607
8090811,5,B000BQ5IXC,"WOW. So moving!! Thrilled to say I know Daniel Jensen! I felt really bad for those on the chain gang. I really think Daniel Jensen expressed it best when he said that it made him worse. While I believe there should be ""time for the crime"" ... I don't believe this kind of punishment would ever have any lasting value or change in a person's life.",1507852800,3,346,4.257575757575758
8090812,5,B000BQ5IXC,"I know Daniel Jenson personally and I must say, he has come a long way in his life. I've known this man for about 9 years. Met him when I worked for the sheriff's office. Became great friends and we talk to this very day. When I first met him and he told me what all he has done my mind was blown. But as our friendship grew, I have had the privilege of watching him improve his life and reaching goals that he shared with me when he was incarcerated. Proud to call this dude my friend! Great documentary highly recommend!!!",1507593600,3,524,4.147058823529412
8090813,5,B000BQ5IXC,"A special thanks to Xackery and his amazing team for putting together such a great ""re-release"" to this film. 20 yrs later, I'm a regional director of a business development team in TN and along the South Atlantic Coast for a treatment facility that helps individuals obtain help for addiction treatment and co-occurring disorders. Just as challenging as it is to truly connect with the ""20 years ago me"" in the original documentary, I'm very thankful for the people who've invested in my life, as well as the numerous opportunities I've had over the years to offer help to individuals in active addiction and struggling with mental health disorders (I always feel like I'm helping the 19 yr old me).  I am a firm believer (based upon experience) that tactics such as chain gangs do not offer reform or rehabilitation for individuals caught up in criminal activity (especially when there are addiction and/or mental health issues associated with their criminality).  I am a firm believer in treatment and rehabilitation (as I am a successful product), as an alternate approach to incarceration and/or punishment (not taking away from the fact there are times that incarceration is the best move for the person and society; with the insight that reform and rehabilitation should be included in the process).  Again: amazing job, Xackery and Chain Gang productions.",1507593600,5,1363,5.075892857142857
