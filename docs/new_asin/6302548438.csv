485601,3,6302548438,"The sisters was an interesting film and is worth a watch.

The film begins when a group of musicans from a rock band stay at a motel after one of their concerts.  Unaware of the room's history, each band member is drawn to an air conditioning vent on the ceiling.  The image they see both horrifies and curses them at the same time.  A ghostly female figure, who had been murdered and beheaded in the room two years earlier, is seen moving down through the vent towards them.

The group vacates the room in a hurry, but finds that the ghost is following them.  She appears to them both alone and in a  group at times, but never leaves their presence totally.  Her haunting image terrifies some of the band members into killing themselves, while others are scared into killing themselves by accident.  The few members who remain towards the end seek help from a buddist monk.  He gives them the solution on how to rid themselves of the spirit,(they are instructed to sleep in a coffin of a person who died a violent death) but they are not succesful.  Two of the members track down the ghost's mother and discover that the spirit has had a long, hard life.  Both as a prostitute, and while living at home. (before she ran away)

The film ends with one member remaining, but does not give the viewer a concrete answer as to why she has been spared. I have my idea of why she remains alive, but I don't want to spoil the film for you so I'll leave the rest for you to see.

The Sisters had a decent story behind it, and included some true elements which helps the plot.  The Ghostly lady did jump me a few times when she appeared, and the music was helpful at times in creating a creepy atmosphere.

I could only give the film a 3 however, becuase I felt it relied to heavily on the ghost's makeup to jump the viewer, instead of using special effects, or even crafty film angels.  The film also  appears to be low budgeted, and some of the actors did not give quality performances.

The release company for the film is tokyo shock.  THey include the original THai language, and an English dubbed soundtrack.  They could have picked better voice actors to dub some of the characters voices though.(a regular problem with Tokyo SHock releases)  As a result, I think the English dubbed version appears less creepy than it could have been due to the voices.

Overall I found the film interesting, and am glad to see Thai films making it to the American video rental market.  It's worth a rental if you like ghost stories.  Particularly Asain ghost stories like the Grudge, or RIngu.  Just make sure all the lights are out when you view it so you can get the maxium jump value out of it. It might give you a bad dream or two.",1125619200,7,2717,4.384
485602,4,6302548438,"Three sisters face maritals problems in this film that features one of the most subdued performances by Bette Davis you will find.  Davis is the oldest sister, and the one with biggest marital problems, since she is married to a drinking, unfocused sportswriter played competently by Errol Flynn.  Anita Louise is very good as the flighty middle sister, who marries a wealthy older man (Alan Hale) for security and a chance to see the world.  Jane Bryan is also effective as the younger sister who marries a very stable and boring Dick Foran for love, and seems to have it all.  Besides troubles with her husband, Davis also has to contend with the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906, re-enacted fairly well.  Davis usually displayed more fireworks in other melodramas, but her performance matches the tone of this film.  The Sisters isn't particularly exciting or surprising, but it is well made and well acted by the stars and a great supporting cast that includes Beulah Bondi, Henry Travers, Donald Crisp, and Lee Patrick.  It's a classy effort.",1019865600,37,1053,4.915254237288136
485603,4,6302548438,"This is the story of three sisters at the turn of the century and their marital woes, with the focus on the eldest sister, Louise, played by an uncharacteristically demure Bette Davis, who falls in love at first sight with Frank, a rascally sports reporter, played by the ever handsome Errol Flynn. He, too, is smitten at first sight.
Louise and Frank elope and move to San Francisco. At first, all seems right with the world. Louise concentrates on making a home, while Frank works to support them and tries to write the great American novel in his spare time. Soon, their honeymoon comes to an end, as Frank returns to his dissolute ways, drinking heavily. When he loses his job and the bills pile up, Louise gets a job. This ends up putting somewhat of a kibbosh on the relationship, and Frank leaves.
Right after he abandons his wife, she is caught up in the San Francisco earthquake. Rescued, she recovers from her physical injuries, but is still traumatized by Frank's abandonment. Slowly she begins to recover under the attentive ministrations of her employer who cares for her. She makes herself into a success on the job, but still longs for Frank. What happens to Louise, makes for an entertaining melodrama.
The sets and costumes are wonderful in the film. Ms. Davis and Mr. Flynn are excellent in their respective roles, as is the strong supporting cast. The earthquake scenes alone are worth the price of the video. Bette Davis fans will not be disappointed.",1005350400,33,1471,4.75

485605,3,6302548438,"Based on a forgotten piece of women's book club fiction, this dated little soap opera would be totally forgotten if it weren't for the first teaming of Errol Flynn and Bette Davis. She plays a long-suffering ""nice""  woman who marries Flynn, an unreliable scamp with a penchant for drink;  their relationship goes downhill in a sort of weak version of ""Sister  Carrie."" Censorship and commercialism keep the film from exploring the  true horror of this relationship, and Flynn looks far too fit and glamorous  for his role as a dissolute, self-loathing loser... rather ironic since  that's exactly what he became in life. The two stars shone much brighter in  their rematch the next year in the Technicolor ""Private Lives of  Elizabeth and Essex"" -- unfortunately no longer on video.",964137600,9,782,5.007751937984496

Flynn flees leaving the pregnant Davis heartbroken; there is the expected happy ending only after Davis surviving the Great Quake. Stock Footage from Warner's 1927 film IN OLD SAN FRANCISCO was used and it's more than adequate. Look closely for Susan Hayward in a bit.  This picture was directed by the respected Anatole Litvak, who, at the time was married to Bette's nemesis - Miriam Hopkins.  Davis admitted that she felt that Flynn's performance here was better than that of his Essex in their next picture THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX.  Lee Patrick is outstanding as the Madam at an Oakland brothel with a heart of gold - she helps the pregnant Davis get through the Quake!  During the making of this film, Helen Hayes, fresh from her stage hit VICTORIA REGINA paid Davis a visit on the set and paid her a compliment on her work; they would work together only once - in Agatha Christie's MURDER WITH MIRRORS (1985) along with John Mills.  Mills commented about working with the feisty 77 year-old Davis ""I was never so scared in my life. And I was in the war!""

This movie, however, is unlike many of Davis' other vehicles in that her character is sympathetic instead of the usual, in-your-face, chew up the scenery, typical Davis film.

It is an historical melodrama that is very well done.  Errol Flynn is a ne'er-do-well alcoholic in this film who Davis' character accidentally married.  I felt the story was very well done and ahead of its time for its portrayal of a woman trying to survive several tragedies on her own.

485681,2,6302548438,"""The Sisters"" is a romantic drama set in the early 20th Century starring Bette Davis, Anita Louise, and Jane Bryan as the sisters with Errol Flynn, Alan Hale, and Dick Foran as their respective spouses. It was based on the best selling 1937 novel by Myron Brinig. The film was originally to be advertised as ""Errol Flynn in the Sisters"", but Bette Davis demanded equal billing and also objected to the obvious sexual innuendo.

Bette Davis (1908-89) is a film icon. She appeared in nearly 100 films, was nominated for an Oscar 11 times and won twice (""Dangerous"" in 1935 and ""Jezebel""  in 1939), nominated for an Emmy 4 times and won once (""Strangers"" in 1979), 3 Golden Globe Nominations, and for ""All About Eve"" (1950) she won awards at Cannes, in Italy,  and the New York Film Critics. According to AFI she is the #2 female screen legend .

Errol Flynn (1909-59) got his break out role as ""Captain Blood"" (1935) and the rest is history. By 1938 Flynn was a top star with such films as ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936), ""The Prince and the Pauper"" (1936), and ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938). He is listed #35 by AFI in the 100 greatest actors of all time.

This was the first film for Flynn and Davis, who didn't get along (partly because Flynn got top billing). They worked together again in 1939 on ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"", but never again. In this film their onscreen chemistry is much better than it was in ""Elizabeth and Essex"", where, at one point, Davis smacked Flynn so hard in the face his ears were ringing.

Flynn was unabashed in his praise for Davis' acting skills. He called her ""the greatest thing in movies"" and said ""she was a far better actress than I could ever hope to be an actor.""

Beulah Bondi (1888-1981) was nominated twice for Best Supporting Actress (""Of Human Hearts"" in 1938 and ""The Gorgeous Hussy"" in 1936) and won an Emmy in 1977 for ""The Waltons"". She is best remembered for playing Granny in 1948s ""So Dear to My Heart"".  Bondi plays the Davis' mother.

Alan Hale Sr. (1892-1950) marries Anita Louise, the youngest sister. Hale was part of Flynn's ""Corps of Actors"" and a frequent sidekick to Flynn in films such as ""Robin Hood"" (1938), ""Virginia City"" (1940), ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940), ""Santa Fe Trail"" (1940), and ""Gentleman Jim"" (1942).

Donald Crisp (1882-1974) appeared in more than 150 films from 1908 through 1963. He won Best Supporting Actor for ""How Green was My Valley"" (1941) and gave memorable performances in films such as ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935), ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936), ""Jezebel"" (1938), ""National Velvet"" (1944), and ""The Long Gray Line"" (1955). Crisp plays a family friend.

The film was directed by Anatole Litvak, a Ukranian born Jew. Litvak is best known for his work on ""The Snake Pit"" (1948) for which he was nominated for an Oscar and a DGA (he lost to John Huston for ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre""). He was nominated for a second time for ""Decision Before Dawn"" (1951). Given his background Litvak liked to make anti-Nazi films (e.g., ""Divide and Conquer"", ""The Nazis Strike"", ""The Battle of Russia"", ""War Comes to America"", ""Night of the Generals""). This was Litvak's first film upon moving to the U.S.

Austrian composer Max Steiner (1888-1971) does a great job. Between 1935 and 1956 he was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), ""Now Voyager"" (1942), and ""The Informer"" (1935). He was so well known that he appeared on a 33 cent stamp (1999) along with Dimitri Tiomkin and Alfred Newman.
The San Francisco earthquake scenes use footage from ""Old San Francisco"" (1927)

Variety said the film was ""a virtual cavalcade of early 20th-century American history"" and added, ""Davis turns in one of her most scintillating performances"" and said that ""Flynn's happy-go-lucky reporter is a vivid portrayal."" Life Magazine said ""Bette Davis acts with such extraordinary grace, sensitivity, and distinction that hers is already being acclaimed the movie performance of the year.""

1938 was a pretty good year for films. The top grossing films were ""You Can't Take it With You"", ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", `Boys Town"", ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"", ""Sweethearts"", and ""Marie Antoinette"". The Oscars were to ""You Can't Take it With You"" (Picture, Director), ""Boys Town"" (Actor), and ""Jezebel"" (Actress). Other notable films released that year were ""Algiers"", Cagney and O'Brien in ""Angels with Dirty Faces"", John Garfield's film debut in ""Four Daughters"" and Gable and Tracey in ""Test Pilot"".

If you like 30s romantic dramas, this film will appeal to you. It's also a nice peek at turn of the century small town America. That being said, personally, I find it funny when Bette Davis took a role as a ""beautiful"" women, which she clearly was not. And I never cared for Errol Flynn sans moustache, nor in this type of film. Nor do I care for Alan Hale and Errol Flynn playing independently of each other - they were a great team, but in this film they rarely share any scenes. And Bette Davis is pretty demure in this film, something that really doesn't cater to her remarkable gifts.",1305158400,,5128,4.772009029345372

485684,5,6302548438,"Bette Davis and Errol Flynn star in this rather undervalued 1930s drama called Sisters. The plot moves along at a good pace and the convincing acting had me every step of the way. This is one Better Davis movie that is truly worth watching; and Errol Flynn fans will want this one as well!

The action starts at a ball in Silver Bow, Montana, to celebrate the election of Teddy Roosevelt to the presidency in 1904. We meet the Elliott sisters and their parents. Helen Elliott (Anita Louise) marries a rich older man in a marriage of convenience while Grace (Jane Bryan) marries Tom Knivel (Dick Foran). Louise (Bette Davis), however, falls in love at first sight with Frank Medlin (Errol Flynn) and elopes with him just one week later; Louis and Frank head for San Francisco where Frank lives to live a happily married life.

Or so they planned. It's not long after that Frank begins to drink more and more, much to Louise's disappointment. Frank's attempt to write a novel stalls; and Louise suffers a miscarriage after an exhaustion collapse. Frank soon wonders if Louise would be better of without him when he gets fired and can no longer find a job.

Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. The sisters took a vow to help each other no matter what: Will Grace and Helen be able to help Louise forget Frank even though Louise still loves him? What happens to Frank after he leaves Louise--will he ever come back to her? What about the San Francisco earthquake--how will this affect Louise and Frank? No spoilers here--you'll have to watch the movie to find out!

The movie attempts to be faithful to the theme of the three Elliott sisters always being there for one another. However, make no mistake about it--this movie belongs to Bette Davis. Even Errol Flynn supports Davis despite the fact that he got top billing. Bette Davis turns in a remarkably fine performance as a young Louise Elliott who marries Frank Medlin for better or for worse.

The cinematography really shows its force in scenes like the ball and the aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake; and the choreography shines just as strong throughout the film.

In short, Bette Davis fans will consider this a must have for their collections; and Errol Flynn fans will not be disappointed, either. Sisters is a fine vehicle for both Davis and Flynn; and I highly recommend it for people who enjoy classic movies from the 1930s.",1193270400,14,2404,4.69833729216152
485685,1,6302548438,"Unfortunately I had bought this movie because it sounded like an interesting and creepy movie. The back of the movie gave a summary that seemed promising but upon watching the movie, I found myself either falling asleep or wandering off to check other things, or check the back of the box to find out how long the movie was. Finally, defeated I turned it off.

Normally I give low budget horror movies a chance but this one just bored me to tears. Not once, when the ghost showed up, was I frightened or even startled. In fact I was able to predict exactly when and how she would make her appearance. This automatically takes me out of my suspension of belief and I start to just watch the movie without enjoying it, or feeling the emotions that the movie wants me to feel.

I am a huge fan of asian horror and I constantly rent or buy asian horror films when i can and I have seen some really creepy ones as well as some pretty bad ones but this one took the cake. It felt way too formulaic and predictable. Anyone who is familiar with the genre will be able to predict everything in the movie which is a shame.

some great horror movies are low budget but this felt like it wasn't trying for any depth or psychological scares, it just assumed that putting a girl with long black hair and cheap make-up in a scene would equal scares but that is the worst thing to do as there is no reason to fear this person.

If you are looking for a good asian horror film, I would recommend look elsewhere. this is not worth the time, the money, or even a second glance.

If you want something better, check out: A Tale of Two Sisters, The japanese version of the Ring, and Juon, The Eye, and the Japanese version of Dark Water and Kairo. Those are some of the best of the bunch. The Sisters belongs in the trash heap.",1179878400,3,1806,4.253644314868804

I will admit that the flynn-davis storyline far dominates the film to a degree that the other ""sisters"" are just context. Not having read the book I do not know how much the changes the original narrative.

7827963,4,6302548438,"Who can complain about Erroll Flynn and Bette Davis, ably supported by an excellent supporting cast?  Not me. The story itself is one of those worn-out melodramas where woman throws her life away on an alcoholic, a sort of martyrdom that seems to have been much in vogue in early Hollywood. Overall, fine production and, if you're a huge Davis fan (as I am), by all means add it to your library.",1453334400,3,395,4.486111111111111
