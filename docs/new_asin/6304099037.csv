796176,5,6304099037,"The best movie is Tenchi Muyo in Love. To sum up quickly. Tenchi Masaki is the heir to the Jurai royal family which members are inhereted to an incredible power. Tenchi's Grandfather,Yosho, left the planet Jurai to a peaceful life. Their, Yosho had a only daughter who died after a few years when Tenchi was born.  The story of TMIL is about a great evil called Kain that escapes from the Galaxy Police HQ. Kain Travels back in time to destroy Tenchi's Mother and Grandfather. Now Tenchi and his friends: Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami, Kiyone, Mihoshi, Washu and Ryo-oki must deguise themselves as students, Teachers and Janitors to help save Tenchi's mother. Tenchi Muyo in love is emotional powerhouse, We see a great concern for Tenchi's mother and father in their teenage years. We also see how Tenchi's freinds truly care for him.  Why Tenchi Muyo is like Star Wars is because the movie focuses on the true story rather than the cool special effects. All characters have true personalities to them and we seem with great concern (Plus, Tenchi has a lightsaber like weapon). I can't stress enough how fantasic this movie is. In my opinion, Tenchi Muyo ending will have you in pure emotional shock because of its sensitivity.  It is true movie magic.  END",903830400,17,1249,4.768518518518518

796259,5,6304099037,"Tenchi Muyo is one of the best anime franchises out there, with fantastic characters, fun comedy, breathtaking battles and some brilliant music, and Tenchi Muyo! in Love puts all that together in one amazing, swift, 95-minute package. Everybody else here has pretty much voiced my thoughts about the film itself, so let's move on to the real meat of the review: the DVD design.

The packaging is pretty good overall. While the case the film came in is a fairly thin, flimsy piece of plastic, this is made up for with the insert design and packaged goods. The design of the outer cover looks great, with great formatting and vibrant colors. Inside the DVD case is an open-up pamphlet with the DVD cover art on one side, the film chapter names on the other side, and it opens up to reveal some fantastic official artwork signed by both the English and Japanese voice cast. I love how Kate T. Vogt (voice of Washu Hakubi in English) put down a little cartoony Washu pic followed by her signature. It's adorable.

The picture and sound quality is fantastic, as it features digital mastering and cleanup provided by THX. The film transfer looks great, with vibrant colors and impressive detail, with no aliasing or frame ghosting to speak of. Truly, a top-quality transfer. The Japanese audio track is similarly amazing, with full 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound with amazing use of bass making the more intense scenes really pop. The English dub track sounds kinda flat, though, and the voice acting and casting isn't too good either. Stick to the Japanese version.

The extras on this DVD are really good. You have the original Japanese TV spots and trailers for the film, director and staff notes, a lyrics sheet for the ending theme (""Alchemy of Love"" by Nina Hagen and Rick Jude), and an insightful interview with composer and Babylon 5-alumni Christopher Franke. Unfortunately, the menus look AWFUL, with blurry images, hard-to-read fonts and poor formatting choices. The menus make the DVD resemble a bootleg as opposed to an official release from a professional company.

Regardless, however, this is a fantastic release. I highly recommend it.",1359849600,,2148,4.909090909090909
796260,5,6304099037,"The evil space criminal, Kain, travels to the past to kill Tenchi's mother who is in high school. Tenchi and the girls travel back to 1970 to stop the demon before he kills Tenchi's mother and erases his existence.

This movie is simply amazing. It follows the Tenchi Universe season in chronological order. So it has a very similar atmosphere to it. It fits in very smoothly. All of the voice actors are back so that also makes it seem like it's the real part to the Universe series. I have always thought that Tenchi Universe was the best Tenchi series, and this is a great follow up. Whether you've seen the series or not, you can find a lot to love about this movie.",1350691200,,670,4.36
796261,5,6304099037,"It is common for people now days to enjoy anime as many have for decades.  I, myself, have loved anime since I was a child and attribute that to the same anime that most people do, Dragon Ball Z.  Towards the end of the nineties I found myself introduced to what would become my favorite television series of all time and best animated series to come from Japan, in my opinion.  Tenchi is more than an anime it is a legend and of the movies this is by far their greatest achievement.  Animated as well as the OVA for this series and with a story that only helps to further the love of these characters ""Tenchi the Movie"" earns its five star rating because of what it brings to the series.  Both action packed and well written the Japanese version of this movie is unrivaled by its predecessors.
So sit back, relax, and dig in deep for this movie, if you are already a fan, and if not do yourself the favor of watching this zany and exciting series from beginning to end.",1325808000,,970,4.278688524590164

796263,5,6304099037,"Hi ,

I'm writing this as a fan who loves the tenchi show's so much , they got me into anime .

This film is apart of the ""Tenchi universe continuity"" and not the o.v.a. (video pilot series) and so is Daughter of Darkness and Tenchi Forever . Though I love the o.v.a. , Tenchi Universe is the main series and this film is a great spin off of a fun and honorable expantion of the o.v.a.

The film introduces a new villian named KAIN who can time travel and do almost anything (take that american comic book super-villians!) He's mad at the galactic royalty for Imprisoning him in sub-space and now that he's busted out , he wants revenge on all of the descendants of the people who locked him away ! He travles back to 1970 to kill Tenchi's mother and grandfather because they're descendants of the House of JURAI who are the royal family who , with the Galaxy Police , trapped him in sub-space 100 years ago !
Tenchi in current time starts to disappeares and Washu has to send the ""team"" back in time to stop him !

This is a great storie and it's a gem in my anime collection .

Lastly , I'd like to point out how the sub-titles don't match the english dub. and it's strange how different the storie ( or at least the dialogue is ) and how much better the english voice acting is compaired to the sub-titled storie which was writen buy the japanese . Thankfully you can turn of the sub-titles in the menu .

ALSO , IF YOU LIKE STAR WARS , YOU'LL LOVE THIS FILM AND SERIES !",1149811200,,1474,4.172535211267606
796294,2,6304099037,"""Tenchi Muyo! in Love"" (aka ""Tenchi: The Movie""), while not a total disaster, is a pretty disappointing entry in the ""Tenchi Muyo!"" franchise.

The movie's biggest weakness is its plot. The totally uninteresting Kain never becomes anything more than a cackling villain-of-the-week. The writers seem to be making up the story as they go along, with holes, dead ends, and deus ex machinas all over the place. The pace varies wildly, with some scenes galloping so fast it's hard to digest what's happening, and other sections taking forever to make simple points.

On the plus side, the animation is impressive, and Tenchi's mother Achika is a charming, intriguing character. Ryoko and Ayeka's squabbling is entertaining as always, but with no real character development to speak of, it comes off as a little tired.

I would really only recommend this movie to a Tenchi completist. The sequel ""Tenchi Muyo! in Love 2"" (aka ""Tenchi Forever!"") is a vast improvement.",1146441600,2,961,5.069620253164557
796295,3,6304099037,"Ehhh... it was ok, ok is all. I like the Tenchi franchise, but this movie left me high and dry, only one scene of real action, even though the Tenchi series isn't known for having the greatest action in the anime world, I for some reason was expecting a better fight than what I saw.

Its still an ok movie, but I only suggest buying it if you like to collect anime of the Tenchi franchise.",1137888000,2,390,4.131578947368421

796298,5,6304099037,"This is a magnificent movie with the classic ""Drastic Showdown""  at the end. I am a Serra Muun fan, and when I saw this I found it dubbed MUCH better than the english Serra Muun.

796299,5,6304099037,"One word can describe this anime. WOW!. This is one of my favorite anime movies of all time. I recently started watching tenchi muyo and it was one of the best. This movie has it all, a great story line, great characters and great music. In the series it didn't tell us much about tenchi's mother and this movie just says it all. His mom has got to be by far one of the best characters that I've seen so far. So if your a tenchi muyo fan and you don't own this movie: WHATS WRONG WITH YOU!!!!",1107302400,,492,4.030612244897959

He had been put there by the combined forces of the Galaxy Police and the Jurai Royal Family.  Now to get back at them he will travel back in time, to 1970, to kill Tenchi's mother!  Does that make sense?  No?  Well, don't worry about it, because this is TENCHI: The Movie, also known as Tenchi Muyo In Love.
Tenchi and the gang, including Kiyone, go back to stop Kain from killing his mom and erasing him from history forever.  This seems to be a normal Tenchi adventure, with a tad more blood than normal.  And I'm not sure who Tench is in love with, but lets not go there.  Just enjoy the time travel and the combat.
Kain, on the other hand, could of used more help as a character.  That's why it has only four stars.",1079222400,3,812,4.324503311258278
796301,2,6304099037,"I have to disagree with most, I found this movie very boring. The plot, at first interesting, became flat rather quickly. I thought this movie had a lot of potential in the first few moments. The problem is the conflict in this movie just takes way too long to resolve. It's not a particularly long movie, but when the space between conflict creation and resolving is filled mostly with dull, flat moments, it just feels so tedious. I was truly bored watching this movie.
Great animation and artwork, there the movie definitely does not disappoint. If you're a hardcore Tenchi fan then obviously this review will fail to convince you. For the Tenchi casuals, I say look elsewhere, as Tenchi in general is actually pretty cool stuff.",1072742400,,732,4.771653543307087
796370,5,6304099037,"Usally, I'm the guy that watches the Godfather, Scarface, Hard Boiled, and New Jack City style movies, but after watching the Tenchi series on Toonami, and enjoyed them(Except for Tenchi in Tokyo).
I brought the movie, and see what it was all about.  Just like the Series(except for Tenchi in Tokyo) it didn't dissapoint, and the storyline is just genius.  The story is very moving, and it also has comedy in it, as always; and it kept my eyes glued to the TV to screene until the end.
I haven't seene the last 2 movies, but I'm sure I'll see them real soon.  So if you love the Tenchi series, you should have this by now.  If you love anime, and don't have this, go check this out, and the 3 Series.

796371,5,6304099037,"Out of all the three Tenchi films, this is my favorite. Though it seems to borrow it's plot from Back to the Future, the movie is touching, while being frantic at times. There's enough action here to please those who liked the fights in the first two Tenchi series, and there's quite a bit of emotionally charged scenes as well.
The Sci-Fi elements of the movie are abundant too, even though the majority of this film takes place in 1971. The tone of the movie is more serious than the comical hijinks of the Tenchi Universe series, but the familiar cast of characters still retain their trademark personalities. Aeka still acts a bit snobbish, Ryoko still is a sarcastic woman who sometimes needs some anger management classes, Sasami and Ryo-Oki are still as cute as buttons, Kiyone still gets fed up with Mihoshi, Washu's #1-scientist-in-the-world ego is still intact, and Mihoshi STILL is a clumsy ditz. One thing's different though; Nobuyuki strangely wasn't a [deviate] as a teenager. What happened here? >:)
 The DVD comes with a nice supply of extras, though most of them are just text-based info pages and facts. The main menu is sluggish, because Pioneer decided to make every selectable item animated. But thats just a minor gripe. There are two versions of the movie present here; The english and Japanese versions. The English dub's actors are mostly good, except for a few parts where their lines felt stressed(Like when Sasami exclaims that she's put one of the power generators in place, a little too giddy-like). The japanese version's actors are superb, as usual.
 I didn't like the movie's music; Christopher Franke's 'Hollywood' inspired score was a bit cheesy and sounded like bad MIDI in parts. I missed the orchestral feel of the TV series' music.
 The animation was a bit better than Tenchi Universe's, so it looked okay.
 The only thing that made me feel uncomfortable during the film was the strange similarities to Back to the Future; Washu even mentioned the whole Time Paradox thing if Tenchi ever encountered his mother! I almost expected Washu to send Tenchi and the gang in a time-travelling car! But nonetheless, this movie is a great film to show anyone new to anime,or Tenchi fans, or anime fans in general, or even regular movie watchers.",1052611200,,2274,4.868217054263566
796372,5,6304099037,"Three words: Buy anything that says ""Tenchi"" or ""Tenchi Muyo!"" on it. period. Ok. that was 11 woeds but hey, who's counting? The Entire line of Tenchi movies and TV shows are some of the funniest things I've ever seen-Japan or anywhere. Good times with the OVA series as well.",1050710400,,276,4.54
796373,4,6304099037,"I would always suggest the DVD version of any Anime over the VHS, as you can really tell the difference in quality.  This fact is the only thing keeping this video from being 5 stars in my book.
This first movie in the Tenchi series is a masterpiece.  Not only do we get an hour and a half version of the TV series (which is great in its own right), but we get to see Tenchi's mom and dad as teenagers.  Achika is everything you would think the mother of Tenchi would be: Strong, serious, independent, and capable of incredible power.  We also get an answer to why Achika, the daughter of Yosho, and presumably a powerful Jurai, died when Tenchi was a boy.
Normally, I cringe watching dubbed Anime.  Many times American localization: translation and voice casting, results in a horrible piece of work.  But with Tenchi there is both a decent translation and fabulous voicework.  They say their lines with the right tone, pitch and inflections, and they are just the right kinds of voices for the roles they play (KT Vogt as Washu is one of my favorites).  So don't even listen to people when they tell you Tenchi Dubbed is bad.
The only confusion of the story is the title.  The movie revolves around Tenchi's parents as teenagers, and saving Tenchi's mother from being killed by a great evil.  THEY are the ones who fall in love, not Tenchi, but no matter, it's still a great movie.",1042070400,2,1383,4.47410358565737
796374,5,6304099037,"My good Lord, I love this movie. The animation is beautiful, and the plot, while predictable to a certain point, is still great. The characters aren't OCC, and are likeable (even if you aren't a Tenchi fan), especially Achika.
**Spoiler for non-Tenchi fans** As Tenchi fans will know, Tenchi's mother, Achika, dies when he is still little. Despite being well-aware of this fact, after getting to know Achika and seeing the ending (which was bitter-sweet) always, always makes me cry. Maybe it's because I'm a softy. Maybe it's because everything, the music, the voice acting, the animation, is wonderful. Maybe it's a bit of both.
I saw the 2nd movie before this one and wasn't exactly fond of it. Then I rented this one day and instantly fell in love with it. It was the #1 thing on my wish list last year, and I am forever in debt to my parents for getting it for me.
I highly recommend this movie; rent it if you're not sure you'll like it. If you like it, buy it.",1038441600,,967,4.468926553672317

I bought this one for a friend of mine who isn't typically an anime fan but, through the superb animation accompanied by an outstanding storyline....his interest was held from beginning to end and then some.  If you've never watched a tenchi episode or have little knoweledge of the whole tenchi concept, still get this dvd.  You shouldn't be confused by tie-ins with other tenchi shows and the story is relatively easy to follow.  This dvd gets a high ranking from me for rewatchability.

Anyone who loves Tenchi or just loves action/romance/comedy anime will love this movie. It is wonderful to get to meet Tenchi's mom and see what she was like.

Besides the title, this Tenchi movie has to be the best one there is. I mean, I have seen it dubbed and subbed in English, but I prefer the subbed. The seiyu is all screwed in the dub.

796410,5,6304099037,"When I got hold of this DVD, I already knew a lot about the story from reading up on the Internet. Still, the real thing was a pleasant surprise. The title may be a bit misleading as the movie concentrates on the growing relationship between Achika and Nobuyuki: Tenchi's parents. But it shows Tenchi's devotion towards his mother, who he can hardly remember. The emotional aspect is very poignant; although the end fight with Kain is rather gruesome, I find these scenes very moving. The plot is deep and has a quality more akin to the OVA series than Tenchi Universe in my opinion. There are of course the inevitabley funny fights between Ryoko and Ayeka, and Mihoshi really makes a mess of things. I was only disappointed that Washu didn't appear more often, she's my favourite character. In order to understand the movie fully, you should have watched Tenchi Universe or the OVA (there are few differences between these universes, although Kiyone only appeared in the Mihoshi Special during the OVA). I would not show this film to children younger than 12, it's certainly one to talk about afterwards.
I can't really say there is much to criticise with this edition, the video and sound quality are excellent. I watch my region code 1 DVDs on my computer and with some animated films the graphics suffer from being blown up to full screen at 1024 x 768. However, this hasn't been a problem with Tenchi Muyo! In Love. I have to admit I was a bit annoyed that the menu came after the film had finished, which makes it more problematic to adjust the audio and subtitles. I don't know how it would work on an ordinary DVD player, though. I prefer watching the dubbed version, there are differences between this and the subtitled one and in many cases I think the translation makes more sense or is funnier with the dubb.

796411,5,6304099037,"As the title states I do not like the Tenchi Muyo series.  The comedy doesn't seem to catch on right and the plot is very dull.  However this movie is an incredible piece of work.  Combining awsome Fantasy style action, some pretty decent comedy and a helluva a story, this is an anime that every fan should have in their collection.
The story revolves around Tenchi and the Gang traveling back to 1970 to save Tenchis mother from being murdered by the evil Kain.  Kain is an energy type monster with incredible power, to the lengths that he can destroy planets in the blink of an eye if he wishes.  Tenchi and his family are decendents of the man who imprisoned him some 200 years earlier.  Tenchi and the rest travel back to save her and the results are amazing.
This is one of those that has no real connection to the series (Like the Dragon ball Z Films, Transformers the Movie) yet really does a great job of telling a story.  I would highly recomend this to any casual anime fan, or for someone just getting into anime.  It's an easier start than something like Akira or Vampire Hunter D, but is effective in the same manner.",1019347200,,1131,4.403846153846154

So, Washu sends the gang back to 1970 to stop Tenchi from disappearing and to save Tenchi's mother.

First off I would like to praise its wonderful animation on the characters and the extremely well done backgrounds, but this does not give a movie 5 stars. I did like the characters, heck I watch the show when I can, the reason I gave it 3 stars is because I wanted more from it, a deeper plot line, I guess because I have been watching Escaflowne. I wanted the criminal to not be that, just a criminal. I wanted him to have a good reason of an abscure thought process for his actions. I didn't want the story to be just good vs. evil, it is just to flat like that. I recomend renting this movie first before buying it, it may not be what your looking for and you, like myself might want a more sophisicated criminal and plot for a movie.",1016755200,,795,4.102564102564102

  Something is happening to Achika, Tenchi's mother in the past and they have to go back in time to save her before it's too late, and Tenchi dissapears.  The person behind it all - Kain, a Galaxy Polices' most wanted criminal who has escaped from his prison after 100 years. Now he is out to destroy what is left of the Royal Jurain Masaki family.
  Washu has to transport Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, Kiyone, Mihoshi, Sasami and Ryo-ohki into the past to save her mother, and prepare for the fight and the moment of their lives.

But the reason I am rating this a 4 is because #1 the story moves SLOWLY! It takes a good half hour to get into the main plot line. #2 Unless you REALLY care about the mushy, in depth character development of the story of Tenchi's mother and the story of how Tenchi's parents came to love each other, this whole movie will bore the pants off you. The humor we normally get in a Tenchi flick just isn't here to support this.
I understand that the director and screen writers were going for a serious, and meaningful anime movie, and I don't have a problem with that, and to any Tenchi fan - you will need to see this at least once. Maybe not own it, but definitely see it. The story DOES get moving towards the last part, and surprise surprise for a Tenchi story, the plot line does have closure.

796520,5,6304099037,"Three words describe this movie: BEST OF CLASS
Tenchi Muyo in Love is one of my favorite movies. I don't remember how many times I have seen it, but it is more than a few. The Tenchi franchise is a hallmark in anime and it deserves its place in fandom as one of the finest examples of that particular genre.
This story recounts the efforts of the entire Tenchi group to save Tenchi Masaki's mother and father in the past. A terrible criminal with the ability to manipulate space and time escapes from prison and decides to get revenge on Tenchi for a past wrong done to him by Tenchi's family. There is more to it than that, but I don't want to give away everything ^_^. This revenge centers around changing the past to effect the future so off the gang must go to try and stop Tenchi from disappearing forever in our world.
This movie hits pretty hard at times with a message that many should see and hear. It is a fight of good vs. evil and though sacrifices are made we know who will win. It is a good movie to watch with your children (perhaps not too young, but I know some 10 year olds who love it) and then talk about it with them afterwords.
It is hard to have a dry eye at the end of this movie. The ending is beautiful. The Japanese seem to know how to write love stories very well. They hit the mark true with this one.
As far as disc quality goes an A rating in all departments. It is THX and shows it. The video is quite good with wonderful color and motion in nearly every scene. I often pull out this title to show friends who have never seen anime to show them a best of class production.
The soundtrack by Christopher Franke (from Tangerine Dream and did the music for Babylon 5) is wonderful. ""Alchemy of Love"", the main title piece, is a great song and one that leaves people humming it days after.
In summation, this is a great, great movie with a wonderful and engaging story. It has some violence so I don't know how good it is for kids, but I would definately want my kids to watch it just so I could talk with them afterwords about it.

They talk to Washu and find out that the criminal KAIN has escaped from the Galaxy Police prison. He is able to travel through time and change the world. KAIN is seeking revenge on the House of Jurai. KAIN decides to end the Jurain line by killing Achika. So, Tenchi and the gang embark on a journey to the 1970's, where Achika is attending high school. Also to note, you will see Tenchi's father, Noboyuki, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Tenchi. The hilarious parts include fights between Aeka and Ryoko, who pose as Achika's students when they are supposed to be bodyguards if KAIN attacks. If KAIN kills Achika, Tenchi will never exist.

796584,5,6304099037,"""Tenchi Muyo in Love"" is yet another great Tenchi film product.  For those familiar with the Tenchi television series, as seen on the Cartoon Network, the characters, their relationships, and situations are a combination of both ""Tenchi Muyo!"" and ""Tenchi Universe,"" which means that all the gang is present, including the irrepressible Kiyone.  The plot of ""Tenchi Muyo in Love"" is compelling and character driven.  Watching old home movies taken by his father, Nobuyuki, in 1970, Tenchi's mother, the subject of the movie, begins to fade and disappear.
Concurrently, Kiyone and Mihoshi are out on patrol for the Galaxy Police when they get a communique from headquarters about the extremely dangerous criminal Kain, who has escaped from his subspace prison.  Somehow, the diappearance of Achika and the escape of Kain are related...
Little Washu, as usual, comes to the rescue - her assessment is that something has happened to Tenchi's mother, Achika, in 1970.  Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami, Kiyone, and Mihoshi must travel back to 1970 to protect Achika, and assure that Tenchi himself does not disappear.  While the movie has an overall melancholic and bittersweet tone, the comic scenes are typical Tenchi hilarity.  As Tenchi and his clique take their positions around Achika, repeated in-jokes and references to episodes of ""Tenchi Universe"" are scattered throughout.
The story of Tenchi's immediate family is one which is rarely touched on in any of the television series.  The writers, animators, and English voice talent do an excellent job conveying the pathos of Nobuyuki and Achika's relationship, and the complex ways that Tenchi deals with his family history and heritage.  By far the most interesting thing about the movie is the 'presence-in-absence' of present-day Nobuyuki.  What does present-day Nobuyuki think of the whole situation that his family is exposed to during the movie, and the very precariousness of existence?  The questions raised by Nobuyuki's absence are fascinating to ponder.

Which is the best Tenchi Muyo movie?
-- Sorry fans of TMiL ... but Daughter of Darkness (Manatsu no Eve) tops Tenchi Muyo in Love.
The animation is still up to expectations, but the story isn't. It follows the Universe (TV) plotline, and we follow Tenchi's mother Achika, and watch as Tenchi and the gang battle Kain, the wimpiest and most pathetic villian ever.
The characters all seem a little out of tune, and the main saving grace is the excellent voice acting, and the fact that we all can't help but love the Tenchi series.",986428800,,571,4.5

All the characters from Tenchi Universe are here in this one. The animation remains some of the best in any Tenchi movie with vibrant colors and full motion animation. One thing you may find strange about the title is that its called Tenchi Muyo in Love and there is almost no romantic quarels between Aeka and Ryoko in the film. Oh well, it doesn't bother me. I actually loved the movie. The DVD does justice as well. The overall best part is the 4 TV spots\theatrical trailers. The first one is a theatrical trailer thats about 30 seconds. The second one is a special report on the film that was shown in Japan right after the last episode of Tenchi Universe. The third trailer is a TV spot which is exactly like the theatrical trailer. The last one is a quick 15 second TV spots. Pretty sweet. Even more is the interview with the music composer, Chris Franke, speaking English with Japanese subtitles. There is also some interesting text to read on the director, music compuser and singers. Even a section on Tenchi Universe. The Audio is great with Japanese and English in brilliant THX Dolby 5.1.

The movie, I think, would be suited for many tastes, with many humorous moments but a lot of action as well. The only downside is that one would probably be better off watching this after one has been acquainted with the characters, so I'd recommend seeing some episodes first.

In the movie, an ""A-1 Class Criminal"" named Kain does something weird to subspace to break out of prison. He is sent back in time, and decides to go to Earth to kill Achika, Tenchi's mother. Washu, using her strange scientific magic, finds out what happened and informs Tenchi and The Girls that Tenchi will dissapear. so it's back to 1970.

796622,4,6304099037,"this movie is based on the first TV series, Tenchi Universe. like Tenchi Universe, it is entertaining, but not fantastic the way the original Tenchi Muyo was. first of all, they could have made an effort to make the title make sense. See, Tenchi Muyo is popularly translated as No Need for Tenchi. But it can also mean Useless Tenchi, which is basically the same, but i think thats what they had in mind when they named this movie, cause No Need for Tenchi in Love doesnt make as much sense as Useless Tenchi in Love. One problem. TENCHI DOESNT FALL IN LOVE WITH ANYONE IN THIS MOVIE!!! the only developing relationships in this movie are those of Tenchi's parents, Tenchi falls in love with nobody he doesnt already know, and while Ayeka and Ryoko fight just as much as usual, neither of them get any farther with Tenchi. Anyway, now that thats out of the way, this movie is fantastically animated. This is the way the OVA series should have been done. cool stuff like rotating camera angles and smooth-as-butter animation (at least sometimes) make this movie a technical achivement. the comedy remains as great as ever. It's even widescreen, which is more than most anime movies can say. Pioneer and AIC obviously cared about this release. (It even has some product placement-see if u cant spot it near the end). So what's wrong? I actually couldn't say. I guess Kain wasn't cool enough. C'mon, this guy can, and does, destroy planets, and Tenchi's mom can stand up to him. Sure she's super strong as a member of the House of Jurai, but even so...By the way, parents, the cover is total B.S. it has more nudity than the movie. the only nudity consists of seeing Kiyone fall 10 feet naked, which is only onscreen for about 15 seconds before she puts a towel on, and most of what you see is her shocked face (long story), and seeing Achika's butt for literally about 2 or 3 seconds.

  From what I can see there are two kinds of tenchi fans.  The ones who watch tenchi muyo For the pure feeling of love and friendship.. And the ones who love the action and character devolpment not to mention the characters. This has a little for everyone. Not to mention Incredibly well directed. And animated with some beautiful shots in it.
  If you want to see Tenchis mom Make the sword 25 feet long and slice kain into little tiny specs This movie is for you. Or if you want to see kiyone shoot a ""galaxy cannon"" capable of wiping out Entire galaxys in one shot. Again this is for you.  but if you Love the characters And just the general good feeling of the love between tenchi and his mom. which alot of us watch this for( youd be surprised...)( take me for example )  Youll love this movie too.
  It is HIGHLY recommended For any tenchi fans. And if you even don't know who tenchi is you might want to try it out anyway. (sure youll be thoroughly confused ..but Youll have a blast) All the characters are there. ryoko. Ayeka Tenchi mihoshi kiyone washu sasami and Achika( tenchis mom)
  The story takes place 100 years in the past where the king of jurai with the GP (galaxy police) Took control of KAIN. The universes Worst criminal. The king of jurai Died trapping kain in a Galaxy police head quarters in another dimension. but Kain Escaped and he wanted revenge so he went back in time to Take care of all the jurai power in the universe.. To kill tenchis mother  (!!!!). While in the present tenchi is slowly fading away And the whole gang has to go back in time to protect Achika(tenchis mom if you havnt figured it out yet) without his mom Seeing tenchi or he might not be born.  I won't give away the story or the ending.. and Nobuleyuki Seems very kind. Opposed to his present Nasty self,  But it has a great blend of action and some comedy mixed in.  A must buy for any tenchi fan. And if you havnt seen tenchi, You might wanna try it out anyway, You might like it!.",981072000,,2225,4.2894736842105265
796667,5,6304099037,"This is most likly the best Tenchi movie of all.  It has all the things Tenchi fans have grown to love.  Though dubbed movies tend to loose stuff in the translation, this movie is just as good as the subtitled.  So if you like Tenchi or whant to see what is about this is the movie to get.",980208000,,289,3.9482758620689653
796668,5,6304099037,"Blalantly put the Tenchi series is flat out incredible.  It has a perfect blend of romance, humor, action, and storyline.  This movie is a bit more on the serious side compared to the others.  But it is still very impressive.
There isn't a boring part in the movie.  Ryoko and Ayeka's feud is hilarious.  Mihoshi as a teacher......what else needs to be said.
KAIN kinda reminds me of Zerim from Iria........",978393600,,407,4.676056338028169
796669,5,6304099037,"Simply put--Tenchi The Movie 1: Tenchi Muyo In Love is one of my all-time favorite Anime movies. I love everything about Tenchi (the comedy, the characters, the battle scenes--everything), and I was not disappointed with this movie. First, the animation. It's beautiful. Flawless. Everything is so well drawn--very nice. You just HAVE to see it to know what I'm talking about. Second, the dubbing. Dubbing is a big problem with most anime, but not Tenchi. It just never has been. ALL the characters have AMAZING voice actors (especially Petrea Burchard who does Ryoko). But what's a movie without a great story? Tenchi The Movie delivers a rock-solid story. It may be a little simple, but it delivers nonetheless. Evil force Kain has escaped from his prison and destroys Galaxy Police HQ, then goes to earth and back in time to eliminate Achika Masaki, Tenchi's mom. If Kain were to succeed, there would be no Tenchi, no Kasami family line, and none of Tenchi's friends would have met. Knowing this, scientific genius Washu sends Tenchi, Ryoko (my favorite female anime character of all time, by the way), Ayeka, Sasami, Mihoshi, Kiyone, and Ryo-Ohki back in time to put a stop to Kain. Thankfully, none of the characters lose their charm in this film--Ryoko and Ayeka are constantly bickering, Kiyone is still frustrated and all too serious, Sasami and Ryo-Ohki are still adorable, and Mihoshi is still an airhead. It was also a nice treat to see what Achika was really like, as well as Nobuyuki (Tenchi's dad) as a shy dreamer (!) instead of his usual comedic self. If I did have one complaint, however, it's that I felt that the movie could have had more humor to it. The series is hilarious (to say the very least), but the humor is substituted for a more serious tone. That's not to say Tenchi The Movie doesn't have its moments though--Ryoko and Ayeka have a hilarious scene in a train, and Mihoshi is, well, still Mihoshi (four words: Mihoshi as a teacher!). And that's not to say its serious tone is a bad thing, as you'll find out, the story is very good. All in all, you cannot miss this if you're a Tenchi fan or just a fan of anime in general, as Tenchi The Movie 1: Tenchi Muyo In Love is one of the best Anime movies I have ever seen.",977356800,6,2248,4.6084788029925186
796670,5,6304099037,"I've never really been totally in Love with the Tenchi series, the stories never seemed serious enough for me. Of course I liked it, and watched it whenever I could, but it was never like an obsession. Then I saw this moive. I can honestly say that this is one of the best anime movies I have ever seen. The musical scores in this movie were absolutly wonderful, making you feel the movie deeply. The plot was fantastic, and the animation was some of the best I've seen.  Though the main plot line was very deep and serious, the characters were there to balance it out with comedy.(Poor Kiyona...)  Probably what made this movie the best was Atchika. She is now one of my all time favorite anime girls! Not only is she hilarious when she wants to be, but she is also loving and mature, and she really knows how to use a sword! ^_^  I wouldn't recommend this film for younger audiences, but only becuase the plot may be a little hard to follow. (oh yeah, and pieces of GP special aggents get to be a little sickening.)  Watch out for the tear jerker at the end if you're an emotional person, keep a box of tissues handy!  Even if you're not a diehard Tenchi fan, you should still get this movie. You more then likely won't regret it.",976924800,3,1232,4.316017316017316

However, I was conned into watching this horrible video, which I am proud to say I burned afterwards.  Anything with the Tenchi name upon it needs to be thrown into a pit and burned for being an offense to writers everywhere.

796673,5,6304099037,"Tenchi Muyo in Love, aside from being the best all-around production of the Tenchi line of anime, rivals even the best anime classics of all time. It is a story told with all the elements otakus have come to expect from good anime plot construct - visual and semantic humor, romance, science fiction, character development, and the embodiment of the classical struggle between good and evil in man's free will.
Specifically to Tenchi fans, this movie offers a solid, satisfying glimpse into the life of Tenchi's mother, Achika Masaki, and his father Nobuyuki when they were Tenchi's age. Upon realizing that Achika has started to disappear in all the old films made by Nobuyuki 26 years ago, galaxy-class genius Washu discovers that an evil force code-named KAIN was responsible for wiping out the Masaki family in the past. Thus, Tenchi and his entire harem embark on a mission to save the past - and in turn preserve their own existences. The movie presents mature content without sacrificing the jovial traits fans have come to expect from Tenchi and the girls. Ryoko and Ayeka's bickering over Tenchi, Mihoshi's bubbleheadedness, Kiyone's exaggerated seriousness, and Sasami/Ryo-ohki's plain-and-simple cuteness are just a few things that are kept very much intact. The gradual development of the relationship between Achika and Nobuyuki, while corny at times, succeeds ultimately to paint a picture of their innocent love. The simple but solid plot twists carries the story to a very Jurai-esque climax and bittersweet resolution. It ends with Nobuyuki taking a group shot of the Tenchi family (it is only natural that he employs a Pioneer videocamera, perfectly drawn, to do this.) Tenchi the Movie provides a refreshingly new aspect of ""love"" in Tenchi for the audience, his love for his mother.
You get all this and still can expect to laugh your head off!
From the surprisingly unique introduction sequence that sets the scene (expect time travel to be confusing), to the smooth transition to the main plot, to the clever ways in which some events are revealed in achronological order, the concept of the non-linearity of time is sustained. Some very interesting techniques to look out for: the black-and-white film at the beginning of the movie that forms the complication of the plot is re-enacted in color when the team goes back to the past, Washu's occasional messages are broken up into chunks of audio flashback, the scrambling of past and present in the last moments brings the whole to a finality.
The wide spectrum of plots, themes, and cinematic techniques in this movie will appeal to a universal audience - diehard Muyoite, animation aesthete, or otherwise. Without a doubt, it numbers among the best in classic modern Japanese animation.",973468800,16,2760,5.081497797356828

Many of the  characters fall in love with Tenchi and end up fighting over him; which is  what you will see in Tenchi Muyo In Love.

Character designs are the same as in the TV and OVA  series, however the animation, as with most anime titles which make the  transistion to film, is much better and fluid. Not as humerous as the TV or  OVA's, but there are still a few laughs to be had. Ryoko and Ayeka can  always be depended on for that.

The smart one sure sounds smart as the ditzy blond sound like  a ditsy blond, but it all actually helps the movie rather than dumbs it  down.  Also, the plotline is rather interesting and diversified.  Time  travel, train travel, space travel, and dimension travel.  Tragedy,  happiness, comedy and action.  Plus it is a decent length.  I recommend  this movie to anyone, anywhere, anyhow.  Unless of course your mother just  died.  Then you shouldn't see it.",944524800,6,899,4.814569536423841
796850,5,6304099037,This is one of the saddest anime movies I have ever seen.  I love the Tenchi series and this film solidifies my appriciation for the series. This is a must see for all anime fans.,943228800,,179,4.114285714285714
796851,4,6304099037,"Tenchi Muyo! in Love is an excellent way to get in to Japanese animation.  The plot is not too obscure, the animation is gorgeous, the English dubbing is some of the best you'll see for anime, and the characters are all great.  The only real turn-off (unless you are one of those Disney wierdos who  things animation is just for kids) is some wierd flaws or lack of  explanation in the translation.  For example, when Ryoko goes to get Kiyone  and Mihoshi, she says, ""it's time to go, Kiyone,"" and, for some  reason Kiyone gets this odd ""I'm freaking out and look, one of my  teeth is a fang"" smile and screams....WHAT????  There are only a  couple of places like this, but it disturbs the flow of the movie a bit.  All in all, a great movie, but I'd like to see if in the original Japanese  version those little things become a bit more clear.",932342400,,844,4.339743589743589
796913,5,6304099037,I really enjoyied this movie. This is a must-see for children between the ages of 11-adult. Tenchi was my second expierience in Anime. My friend and I really enjoyied Tenchi Muyo in love and we hope you will to!,930182400,,211,4.435897435897436
796914,5,6304099037,"Tenchi the movie was such a pure entertaining film with the elements what make a film worth seeing. It doesn't have to be a motion picture that can be good.  It proves animation can be good as a motion picture.  Why?  It  has elements that no other animation I've ever seen when I was growing up  watching Saturday morning cartoons.  First, with very detailed and  vivid animation that looked like the best and talented Japanese animators  has worked on.  Second, the score for the film plays a part with what  happens. By listening to the music, it brings the film to a full circle by  it lush and symphonic sound that has come to composer Christopher Franke's  work in this genre.  Music that punches through every explosion without  losing it Melodic track.  Third, the characters in the film basicly bring  it to life. By knowing these characters, I feel this adds more depth to the  film and background of the characters who I could really relate to.  This movie overall ment something to me personally.  When I was growing up,  I really intruiged by Japan.  And by watching this movie as well as the  second one, I get a taste of Japan that really intriges me.  So this is one  of the best animation film I've ever seen as well as the second one.",927849600,,1252,4.486607142857143
796915,5,6304099037,"For an avid fan of anime, Tenchi the Movie sends me into orbit. Switching from the depths of space, to present-day Japan, to the 1970's,with such fluidity is no small feat. This film tells the true story of Tenchi's  mother and her importance to his life. With memorable characters, flawless  art work, and an intense plot: this movie rocks!",927590400,,341,4.762711864406779

Travel back in time with Tenchi and the gang as Tenchi tries to save his mother in the past to keep him from disappearing.  Really nice film! I prefer this one to the second Tenchi Muyo film!,924048000,,287,4.314814814814815
796917,4,6304099037,"This movie has an intriuging story line and is well animated. The first 5-10 minutes have some crazy animation, and the rest of the movie is smooth as well. It was also good to see an engaging story for a change. I think  it's one of the better movies to come out in a while. It's not a classic,  but definitly worth checking out.",921888000,,330,4.140625

Worth watching even if you are not a full blown Tenchi fan, the story can carry its own weight. Losses a star because its not existential or life questioning, just a really nice anime to watch and kill time.",1485561600,,381,4.380281690140845
