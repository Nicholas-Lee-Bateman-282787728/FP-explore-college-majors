8044204,4,B0006Z2NRW,"When I was little, long before Saturday Night Live, there was crap like this on TV every Saturday night. We'd make a big pan of popcorn while the news was still on, and then watch whatever crap they were screening, because Sunday School is a lot more fun when you're bleery-eyed and half-asleep. What I'm getting at here is that any old piece of crap is entertaining enough in the right circumstance. I only have two complaints with this collection.  First, it should include ""Planet of Storms"" since that's the original Soviet movie from which both ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" and ""Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women"" were cobbled together (with additional footage). And ""Embryo"" is just too awful.  Period.  The high points, IMO, are ""Rocket Ship"" (A Flash Gordon amalgam), ""Killers From Space"" (With Peter Graves driving a '53 Studebaker!), and ""Attack From Space"" (Japenese camp sci-fi at its campiest).",1406851200,,921,5.006535947712418

8044207,5,B0006Z2NRW,"Classics From Outer Space is a collection of ten science fiction movies that have only one thing in common: they are all public domain and as such it is possible for them to be presented in highly affordable collections. I paid $9.98 for my set and that comes down to about a dollar per movie. The way that movie tickets cost nowadays, you really cannot complain about this collection.

An added bonus of this collection is the fact that many of these movies are not available on other public domain collections. A further bonus is a chapter from the Radar Men From the Moon serial.

Anyways, here is how I rate the movies in Classics From Outer Space:

Great:

Flash Gordon:  Rocketship (1936)
Phantom From Space (1953)
The Day the Sky Exploded (1957)

Good:

Attack From Space (1959)
Killers From Space (1954)
Night of the Blood Beast (1958)

Average:

Assignment: Outer Space (1961)
Embryo (1976)

Bad:

Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women (1968)
Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet (1965)",1212278400,10,995,4.794117647058823
8044208,1,B0006Z2NRW,"A wretched collection of poor acting, bad set design and miserable direction, some of these mutations actually rise to some semblance of artfulness. Don't think for an instant that these even merit the Mystery Science Theatre treatment: they don't. They ended up on these bargain discs only because the licensing was a give away, and no one made the slightest effort to clean up the transfers. So don't be surprised if the Technicolor is black and white, or some color blind intermediate form. I have looked at the discs once so far, with the high point being the old Saturday morning cliff hanger bits. There are better copies on Amazon, which I would encourage you to purchase, should the desire emplore you to do so.",1192233600,2,719,4.76
8044209,3,B0006Z2NRW,"The titles should tell you enough about the movies to know what you're getting into: b-movies from the 30's (Flash Gordon) to the '70's (Embryo).

Be warned, the transfers vary from tolerable to awful.  Nothing here is in good condition:  ""Assignment Outer Space"", ""Attack From Space""; ""Voyage To The Prehistoric Planet"" and ""Voyage To the Planet Of Prehistoric women"" (the last two are re-edits and redubs of the same Russian SF film) are all the same quality as their stand alone DVDs (I suspect they are from the same masters) -- any colors have faded (yeah yeah, I know most of them are black and white, but in 2004 I saw excepts from the original footage used for the two Russian films and the color was wonderful).

""Embryo"" looks like a VHS dub (seriously), and the other films are all in various states of decay.

My guess is the distributor aquired a series of TV video masters and made a fast compilation.  Unfortunately it's unlikely these films will ever be presented in anything like their original condition.

So until someone retransfers and remasters these films into DVD resolution this collection is probably the best value for money you will find.",1175990400,24,1166,4.8
8044210,3,B0006Z2NRW,"the person i gave this to has really liked this set and has asked if they make more of them. i only gave it a 3 because, well,the transfers are good but face it,none of these would win oscars.",1146268800,6,192,3.948717948717949
8044211,5,B0006Z2NRW,"I've never liked buying a DVD with just one movie on it. Guess what -- my prayers were answered, in the form of Classics from Outer Space. Three DVDs, for about $10 depending on where you buy them, with 10 movies! Fourteen hours! Woo hoo! I swoon! This particular set of discs contains:

""Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women""
""Flash Gordon: Rocketship""
""Phantom from Space""
""Embryo""
""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet""
""Killers from Space""
""Night of the Blood Beast""
""The Day the Sky Exploded""
""Attack from Space""
""Assignment: Outer Space""

I am raptured! And there are other sets like these!

P.S. The movies range from ""suck"" to ""not bad at all."" The impressive ""Flash Gordon"" is the best, and worth the price of the DVD.",1111795200,66,728,4.761904761904762
