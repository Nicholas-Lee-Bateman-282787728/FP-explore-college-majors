7983254,1,B00008G8HX,i do like the music video at the end. Not very helpful if you've already had some singing lessons.,1424304000,,98,4.2105263157894735
7983255,5,B00008G8HX,I took singing lessons during the '90s. I paid $50.00 for each session. This DVD has all the singing exercises I learned for fraction of the cost. It is worth it!,1349654400,,162,4.258064516129032
7983256,2,B00008G8HX,"Observations:
1) DVD obviously copied from a VHS or other low quality medium, with occasional tracking problems.
2) Buddy Mix has a Ziggy Stardust hair cut.
3) The two main portions of this DVD are nearly identical. Singing for Girls is just Singing for Guys but a different octave. Not much talk about the different theories behind each.
4) The last section is a cheesy music video from the 80's of pure Buddy Mix propaganda.
5) I would have liked a discussion on the soft palate.
Conclusion:
Excellent for getting your friends together and having a sing along / comedy hour. Wouldn't agree that it is the ""complete how to sing"" dvd... maybe some good pointers that could be worth paying less than $20.",1083974400,8,703,4.67741935483871
7983257,5,B00008G8HX,"Hi, I'm only 14, but this DVD is the best! I always knew how to sing, at least I tought so, but was always shy, because I was afraid that people would think that I wasn't any good. After I watch this singing video I immediatly had an outstanding singing voice! I'm no longer shy because I know that I have a good singing voice. It's works immedeiatly,I should know becasue I just got it today which is 1-8-2004.",1073520000,,411,4.215189873417722
