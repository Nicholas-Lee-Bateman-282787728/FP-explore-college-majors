8531845,5,B008XAT10E,"I highly recommend this choice ....

The actors are new in their professions and surprised me with their grasp of the characters and depth of the story...

Great job and the selections are well chosen for many re viewing for years to come...

Thank you Amazon for this selection made available...

8531847,5,B008XAT10E,"Okay. The item here, I did NOT receive. They sent me the wrong disc. It was 3 movies, but NOT this one. So I wrote several times, I tried to get a refund or exchange. No luck. So I chalked it up as money down the drain. However, I ordered LOVE SONG FOR BOBBY LONG as a stand alone from another Amazon vendor and it is just a great southern movie, based on a great southern novel John Travolta and Scarlett Johansen are both at the top of their games.",1382227200,3,450,4.011111111111111
