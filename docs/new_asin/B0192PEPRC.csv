7561921,5,B0192PEPRC,"Looking for something that the entire family can watch that has a great lesson, keeps to moral integrity and is a fun way to spend the evening as a family? Then look no further than When Calls the Heart, a series based on the novel by Janette Oke and produced by Michael Landon Jr. for the Hallmark Channel. Now in its third season, this series follows the life of Elizabeth Thatcher, a school teacher for Hope Valley that leaves her life in Hamilton to help teach the children of a mining town that there is hope for a better life out west.

In the DVD, When Calls the Heart: It Begins With Heart, this opens Season 3 with some changes for the towns residents of Hope Valley as they are beginning plans for the New Year's Eve celebration. For cafe owner Abigail Stanton(Lori Loughlin, Full House), she plans on investigating who is stealing the food from her kitchen and winds up with two orphan children in need of a family. Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow) vows to prove herself worthy of earning the trust of Rip, a dog owned by Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing), who comes between her and Jack as he is jealous of their romantic relationship. Sometimes the best way to a dog's heart is through his stomach, but unfortunately Elizabeth is not the best cook in Hope Valley.

Rosemary is bound and determined to use her literary skills to win a contest about real life on the frontier with the San Francisco Herald and it seems she has managed to fabricate things a bit which will pose as Lee Colter's wife when they come to see things in person. Bill Avery (Jack Wagner) is still trying to convince Jack that he is innocent in the counterfeiting ring and two visitors arrive in town to cause problems for both Jack and Pastor Frank just as he is beginning to start building a relationship with the town as pastor and win the heart of Abigail.

I received When Calls the Heart: It Begins with Heart compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation aside from a free copy of the DVD in exchange for my honest and personal opinion. I only wish there were more shows like this on television especially for the entire family to enjoy. This is truly a great series that every single member will enjoy and for fans of the television show Little House on the Prairie, this one will make you feel right at home. It will make you laugh, cry and cheer for your favorite Hope Valley residents and well worth 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion. This is Dove Family approved for all ages!",1459123200,3,2533,4.454741379310345
7561922,5,B0192PEPRC,"Just when you think something cant get any better, you are greatly surprised. When Calls the Heart-It Begins with Heart, Season 3, Episode 1 is such a special, tender story. It is full of suspense, action, but also love, compassion and forgiveness.
  We see our favorites returning, also a few new characters and new plot lines. The actors and actresses are very good at what they do and are very believable in their roles.
  This is a continuing story from episode to episode. Some people have called it like unto Downton Abbey. It is, but a series the whole family can watch without worrying what might come next. When Calls the Heart is a very wholesome, family-oriented series.
  Not only does this show have funny, quirky parts, but parts of great severity and things to make us think.
  When Calls the Heart-It Begins with Heart is such a wonderful, wonderful entertaining show. Sesaon 3 is starting with a bang. Watch all of the Seasons if you haven't yet. Each one is full of many great teaching moments. So thankful to be able to watch an entertaining, wholesome, exciting series.
  Highly recommended. It Begins with Heart is full of surprises. Watch and see for yourself.

7561927,5,B0192PEPRC,"My Thoughts
What a terrific beginning of Season Three on When Calls the Heart, a made for television series on Hallmark Channel. It Begins with Heart  is movie length and combines the first two episodes. My girls, Emily, Amy, and I really enjoy this series. It's always exciting when a new DVD is available. One of the things I like is that this series is not just about Jack and Elizabeth. There are multiple storylines occurring simultaneously. I guess it's a little like a Christian old-time frontier soap opera. ~grin~

Finallywe get some resolution in a couple of long pressing matters. There were some definite changes in a couple of the storylines. I felt like Jack and Elizabeth finally started listening to each other. That's a big change. I liked that. Abigail faced a bit of a mystery in the cafe that will spell change for her. The acting is superb as usual. I have to say that I really enjoy the sparkle that Rosemary brings to the show. Oh, I just want to tell you everything, but it would spoil it all!

Emily: It was good. They wrapped up a lot of loose ends. They did it neatly.
Amy: It was a good movie. It makes you want to know what happened.

Suffice it to say that this gets five stars from the Lane Ladies!

7561929,5,B0192PEPRC,"If you love shows like Highway to Heaven, Little House and the Prairie and even Downtown Abbey you will love this show. It is a reminder of a time when community mattered and helping others took precedence over having everything for yourself. A time when life meant hard work and diligence. Friends and family. A time before the internet took over our lives and keeps us from getting together in person with the people that matter to us most.

The actors are wonderful in their character roles, the set and clothes are perfect and even the new characters fit in beautifully with the addition of Cody played by Carter Ryan Evanic a little Macaulay Caulkin look alike without the precocious attitude.

This show has a lot of familiar faces, check it out! You won't be disappointed.
