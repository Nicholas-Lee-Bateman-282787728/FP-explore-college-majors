7898020,2,6305908710,"This is a minimalist staging, bare to the point of being almost an oratorio/concert performance.  There are costumes, but almost zero scenery.  It is ""so"" bare ... (HOW BARE IS IT??)  It's so bare, they don't even have the three oranges on stage for the Prince and Truffaldino cut open to discover the princesses inside.  (""HEH?"", I hear you exclaim, ""then how do they handle that scene??"")

Well, you see, the Prince and Truffaldino are shown pulling on the rope which is supposedly dragging the oranges (the rope just leads offstage).  Our two heroes collapse from exhaustion, and then the princesses just come walking out onstage.

I suppose it would have been far too difficult to stage as the composer specifed.  Although for the life of me I can't understand, if a podunk organization like the Arizona Opera could do it so effectively in 1982, how the French National Opera of Lyon could not also do it some years later ... that is a mystery.",1431561600,,948,4.703030303030303
7898021,1,6305908710,"even if you're offered it at 0.01 don't buy it:  I'm not a traditionalist, love modern interpretations (Salzburg's modern dress 'Cosi' and 'Giovanni', Birtwhistle's The Minotaur) - but this!!!!!!!  nicely sung, Nagano's conducting rather insipid, but the staging (assuming there was some thought behind it) truly dreadful:  clumsy, unfunny, maladroit, the worst set of 'comedians' ever and no focus or pacing - no wonder it was filmed sans audience and there were no curtain calls

how this ever made it to DVD I'll never know, especially when there's little enough of Prokofiev's splendid operatic works available:  I believe the Pelly version of this opera is wonderful, and I look forward to seeing it

in the mean time for excellently directed and conducted Prokofiev there's the amazingly powerful The Gambler (Barenboim conducting) and the two Gergiev conducted operas, Betrothal in a Monastery and War and Peace (especially Brian Large's magnificently staged 2nd act)",1411603200,,974,5.375
7898022,4,6305908710,"This is an odd production of an odd opera. Still, it's enjoyable and I'm glad to have it in my collection. The singing is good, the acting is very good, the staging is about as good as it gets for this opera short of doing a high budget movie version.

The story is strange but it is almost a modern update or parody of Die Meistersinger. You have groups---which I suppose represent the unwashed masses of opera attendees---crying for more comedy! Make us laugh! Other groups call for drama. So the opera is trying to please these clamoring masses while delivering artistic excellence. Operas are somewhat known for nearly corny plots so Prokofiev takes that to extremes and still stays just inside of coherent. That's actually pretty masterful.

I won't say that I was engrossed by this opera so I'll give it 4 stars. But I have mixed feelings about that and perhaps it deserves 5. I struggle because it does brilliantly make the composer's points about much of the absurdity around art and the public's demand for what they want. Again, think about Meistersinger. Wagner makes a similar statement but does so in all seriousness to ""preserve the German art form!"" Here Prokofiev uses a kingdom run by a clown king who hires a real clown to cure the heir of hypochondria who then falls in love with three oranges, one of which turns into a princess. The prince is cured and the kingdom saved. In the end, the crowds are pleased. Hum?

Give it a chance. It's worth a venture out to something very different. I would sure appreciate your comments.",1405209600,,1545,4.652014652014652
7898023,4,6305908710,"This staging of ""LfTO"" is spare and modernistic, with minimal (but often inventive) sets and costumes, but the singing is first-rate and Nagano's conducting makes for an excellent handling of the music.  The cast is young and vibrant (and even a bit sexy!) and the camera work helps keep you involved.  A must if you are a Prokofiev fan; but it might be an eye-roller for someone looking for more traditional opera.",1168300800,2,415,4.75
7898024,4,6305908710,There is no way to turn the subtitles on and I have bought 2 DVDs at this point and neither of them have working subtitles.  Outside of that is a suberb performance.  No company is better than Opera Lyon's at this type of production.,1080000000,4,233,4.2727272727272725
7898025,5,6305908710,"This Opera National de Lyon production is simply delightful.  The singing is excellent and the audio quality of the DVD is as good.  The video is of an equal quality.
The staging is unusual but comes off brilliantly.  The use of the minimalist sets works very well and I wouldn't have expected it to do so.  It is slightly surreal but this is a slightly (?) surreal opera.  The sets work with the opera and never detract from the opera or become intrusive.
The singers seem to be enjoying themselves and inviting you to enjoy it with them.  In fact, joy might be a good one-word description of the entire opera.
There is some slapstick in it but never at the cost of the opera.  Instead, it seems to enhance it.  The scene with the cook and her ""deadly"" ladle is delightful but only slightly better than the other scenes.
This is my first experience with an Opera National de Lyon production and I throughly enjoyed it.  I got the opera several months ago and find I watch it about once a month.",1011484800,17,995,4.39344262295082
7898026,5,6305908710,"After I bought ""Des Contes d'Hoffman"" (DVD, 1993, Dir. Pierre  Cavassilas), I was so disappointed and reluctant to buy any unorthodox  opera staging. However, I am happy to have this copy. The audio and visual  effects are very good. The stagings are un-traditional yet logical and  powerful. Even my 8 year-old watched the most part of it with me.",969235200,4,348,4.8474576271186445
7898027,4,6305908710,"If the Marx Brothers were to write an opera it might come out like this one.  Prokofiev's wacky, quirky Love of Three Oranges is a strange trip into something between a fairy tale, satire and farce.  The L'Opera de  Lyon's production gives this tale of the hypochodriac Prince and his  triple-citrus curse a sort of ""twenties chic"" look.  Despite its  silliness there is at least one truly chilling moment when Fata Morgana,  the witch fresh from Hell, gives the Prince the curse of the three oranges.  Biting, acid music, a bizzare story and the most slapstick you've ever seen  in an opera make this a totally unique and entertaining experience.",952732800,9,647,4.8090909090909095
