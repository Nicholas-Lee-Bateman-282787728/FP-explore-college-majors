Yes the queen does act a little ditzy but its a
childs movie the kids love it. I couldn't tell a
whole lot of difference in the barney voice. I enjoy
watching this movie with my daughter and son.",1072742400,4,250,4.02
7799497,4,1586683799,"Barney has been a household word for our family for the ten plus years of his existence.  This not a great Barney video, but I do hope that the producers will consider using the ""Queen of Hearts"" in other episodes.  She is terrific, and utterly charming.  Once again, however, Barney forgot to take his allergy medication, as he sounds too nasal.  Bring back Bob West as the voice of Barney!!!!",982108800,4,394,4.585714285714285
7799498,1,1586683799,"Some Barney videos are good, and I had even been thinking that they were getting more and more clever.  But this latest one really stinks!  There's no plot at all, and the way to celebrate Valentine's Day is with a party that might as well be in a gymnasium with pink decorations instead of the Queen of Heart's castle.  Very little thought and effort went into this one.  Most of the songs are repeats of old songs.  I think the writers had a hard time stretching it out!  Also, the new Barney voice is more difficult to hear and understand and doesn't sound as ""fun.""
Don't give up on Barney, but do pass up this video!",979862400,10,621,4.310344827586207
