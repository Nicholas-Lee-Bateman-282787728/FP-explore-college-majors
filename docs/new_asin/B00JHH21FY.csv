6358766,5,B00JHH21FY,"The features are fantastic and the remastered shows are stunning. This is definitely an upgrade from the DVDs released in 2004. The bonus materials tell the behind the scenes story of Pee-Wee's Playhouse through interviews.

A 4 disk set, ""Seasons 1 & 2 Pee-Wee's Playhouse Special Edition"" is available on DVD. It includes the re-mastered episodes and bonus features. Shout Factory hasn't announced the release date for Seasons 3, 4 & 5, but it's coming!

6358767,4,B00JHH21FY,"Great set, but the box is wrong about the video. It is NOT presented in 1080p, but rather 1080i. Some sets (and PCs especially) may not look as great with this interlaced picture as they would the progressive scan you get with 1080p/24. It is however a great set, and looks great on the right equipment. I just wish manufacturers would check with the encoders (who they paid tons of money to for the job I'm sure) before slapping some random information about the video on the box. They got the aspect ratios right, not sure why they got the encoding wrong.

1080i is a 60hz interlaced signal, while 1080p is a 24hz progressive signal. While this show was shot on film at 24 frames/sec, it was edited in standard def (480i 60hz). Since it probably used some footage from 480i sources, they probably went with 1080i to preserve the faster frame rate and not make those things look weird.",1413936000,59,886,4.5375
6358768,5,B00JHH21FY,"I grew up knowing this series with all it quirks and eccentricities. While this series was definitely cutting edge and something that always brought a smile on my face, my kids had never heard of this series at all. With that in mind we sat down to watch this and at first I think my girls did not know what to think of Pee Wee, but as the show continued they were laughing continuously. There is something unique about what Paul Reubens did with this character and this is why he became such a favorite of so many. In watching this again the one thing that I was struck by were the number of people that got their start on this show as I just did not remember this from before. SOme of the people that I saw included people like: S. Epatha Merkerson, Laurence Fishburne, Natasha Lyonne, the late Phil Hartman, Jimmy Smits, Sandra Bernhard, Dweezil Zappa (wrote the music for one of the episodes), John Singleton (PA), Rob Zombie (PA) and it had musicians like: Mark Mothersbaugh, Todd Rundgren, Herbie Hancock, Danny Elfman, George Clinton and more.

The show was also forward thinking and had a number of technological marvels of the day that were not even thought of back then. Things like the Magic Screen which is equivalent of a giant tablet or todays smart TV; Picturephone which is equivalent to video conferencing today, etc.

This show was and is a show that will last a long time in the cultural history of our nation and I am glad that I was able to share this with my kids too!

6358782,5,B00JHH21FY,"One of the best blu ray collections I've come across. I can tell Shout Factory did a lot of work to produce this. Pee-wee's Playhouse is one of the most creative television shows, period. I've never come across a show with live action character, stop motion, clay mation,  old classic animation, 2-d animation, puppetry, the list goes on. I play this in my PS4 and it has true aspect ratio and good high definition.
Whether it's nostalgia (as it is for me) or loving creative television/movies (as it is for me), this won't let you down. Pee-wee Herman is quite an ingenious character. I recommend this and Pee-wee's Big Adventure only.
I didn't really care for his new movie on Netflix, to me, wouldn't he be upset his beloved car went missing? It wasn't as innocent and creative as his first movie and this television series.",1493337600,,827,4.664383561643835

My 17 year old was as excited for it arrive as I was and my 3 year old doesn't want to watch anything else. Its singlehandedly taken down PBS, Sprout and Nick Jr for his viewing time. Everything is perfect about this set down to the most amazing, durable and colorful disc cases that I've ever seen.

6358796,5,B00JHH21FY,"Having not seen this show since it aired on TV, I wasn't sure how well it would hold up over the years (a lot of shows don't). I decided to take a chance and pick  up the box set, hoping for the best but not having the highest expectations.

Shout Factory, the company releasing this product, has had some problems over the years with their releases - even some of their bigger titles haven't had the greatest video presentation. For them to release a full 5 seasons of a show from the 80's,  I was expecting it to be a release to get the content out and not much else.

Fortunately, I was wrong -- they did a great job on this release!

The set comes in a very sturdy matte-box package (much sturdier than other releases I own which use a flimsy box). This is both nice (sturdy!) but also a bit of an issue as the cases are very hard to remove since it's such a tight-fit. Inside the box are 2 large blu-ray cases (each holding 4 discs -- seasons 1 & 2 on the first case, seasons 3, 4, 5 on the second case, a total of 8 discs)
The discs are listed as Region A only

You can get  a full listing of whats on each  disc by looking behind the discs inside the case (the case is a transparent blue, so you can view the disc listing). I would have liked a paper insert with this content, but this still works fine!

Content: The content holds up surprisingly well. I know a lot of kids' shows don't hold up over the years, but this one is still entertaining today. It definitely requires you to be able to stand the randomness, but if you do you'll love it. Included are 45 episodes, including the Christmas Special

Video: This is where my big concern was going to be. This show started in 1986 and was a TV show. Fortunately, it was shot on film and was kept safe over the years..Shout Factory did a complete restoration, scanning and cleaning up the original film content. I believe it was mentioned that while the show was shot on film, it was finalized in Standard Definition with the completed effects. Shout Factory went in and re-created some of these (such as the word of the day) to present the entire show in High Definition. They did a very faithful job on this, and I don't think anyone will be upset. It's presented in 1080i (despite what the box says, its not 1080p), 4:3 ratio (meaning black bars on the left/right)
The detail is incredible -- you can see strings on the puppets and the detail on pee-wee's jacket (it's actual a striped black/white very close together, not a solid grey). There is a noticeable grain, and it appears to be sharpened, but the detail seen is well worth it (especially when you compare it to the way it originally looked). Colors are bright and vibrant.

Audio: I'm listening on a soundbar and didn't notice any issues. Box stated it's in Stereo/Mono english. English subtitles are included.

Extras: The set has a nice set of extras! The Christmas Special includes an audio commentary.  There are a number of (newly produced) extras, including interviews and featurettes. Very interesting to watch now, 30 years later!

Overall, highly recommended. The price is a bit high, but considering the content I'm completely satisfied with it. Great job on this release!",1437868800,19,3205,4.447098976109215

6358799,5,B00JHH21FY,"I love the BluRay version, however the cardboard box that holds the DVDs ripped right away. When I opened the package,  I noticed the box set looked like it was torn on all edges, but I thought it may have been part of the box design because it didn't look too prominent. But then it ripped apart as soon as I picked it up. It didn't happen in shipping because it was packaged and protected well it looked like. I spent a lot of money on this so I'm pretty upset with the box ripping like that. It must have been torn before they sent it to me. I'm pretty upset with that because this was expensive, and I wanted to display it in my room. I am a ""completest""collector which means I like to collect every version of a show that I like as it comes out. I really wanted this version to last, and to display it in my room...
I watched a few episodes though, and the restoration is incredible. I can't believe all the details I never noticed because the DVD and VHS versions are just so blurry and grainy. With a show with such high production design, it's so incredible to finally see the background in high sharpness! I'm going to have so much fun re-watching these and checking out the bonus features.

6358804,5,B00JHH21FY,"This set is great and I think the price point is very reasonable. The image quality for being a children's television series filmed in the 1980s is unbelievable, and there are plenty of extras that will show you exactly how they painstakingly created this blu-ray edition, as well how the show was conceived and brought to life along with cast and crew interviews. There is a noticeable lack of commentaries on this set as I think everyone would have enjoyed more of Paul Reubens' perspective. There is one episode that does contain commentary which is the holiday special, and I believe it is the same as was included on the original stand alone DVD of that episode. This is still a great set and anyone who chooses not to add it to their collection is missing out on something awesome.",1428105600,4,787,4.628571428571429

It's every bit as weird and annoying and fun as I remember it being when I used to watch it as a kid, and it's good clean fun. A lot of good moral values when it comes to kids learning to use their imaginations as well as accepting those around them (i.e. being friendly to the bully despite his abuse, putting up with needy and or manipulative people, etc). On the surface it appears to be just a random weird show, but there really are some good social lessons that are taught at a children's level of understanding.",1424131200,,613,4.247863247863248

6358815,3,B00JHH21FY,"My biggest problem with this set is that the only way to get the cases out of the box, is to destroy the box, which was very offensive considering I paid a hundred dollars for the set. Maybe mine was defected and extra tight but no matter what I did I could not remove the cases any other way. Aside from that very obnoxious issue, if you're watching Pee-Wee's Playhouse for the first time ever then it might as well be in HD, I guess, but if you're watching this for nostalgic purposes, it'll look much more like it did in your childhood in lower resolution SD on an old tube TV, like it was back in the day, so I actually prefer the DVD set put out by Image Entertainment than this Blu-Ray set. I'm a huge advocate of Blu-Ray and HD, but for Pee-Wee, for some reason I almost rather have this on a VHS. Seeing all of the stage props and wires/strings for the puppets so crystal clear actually ruins the experience for me a little tiny bit. Despite being a kid's show, something about this show is really cult, and psychedelic, and I'm honestly just not feeling it very much seeing it polished up so much. Usually blu-ray preserves things that I WANT to see, like film grain, but I swear to God this somehow managed to make some of the claymation look reminiscent of CGI to me, but these restorations were done in the presence of Paul Reubens himself, so I don't want to second guess the genius himself. Part of me likes this release but a big part of me feels resentment towards Shout Factory for releasing this the way they did and making it as expensive as they did. The picture quality is obviously of stunning quality and if that's how you want to view Pee-Wee, then this set is for you.  However, some of the motions seem questionable to me, and remind me of ""Soap Opera Effect"" (Google that if you don't know what that is). If the set were 30 bucks I wouldn't nitpick all the flaws, it's just a show, but for that kind of money that they charged, everytime I see this on my shelf I want to throw it up against a wall.",1423180800,,2025,4.259740259740259

6358832,5,B00JHH21FY,"This is wonderful! Pee-Wee's playhouse was a favorite of my children.  Now, it is a favorite of my grandchildren.
My kids love sharing and laughing with their kids as they once again watch the shows they enjoyed.  Pee-Wee was
way ahead of his time - the material still holds up decades after it was first seen.  The re-mastering of the shows is
amazing.  If you missed the series when it was originally aired, I strongly suggest you watch it's.  It's great!",1419724800,,457,4.592592592592593

This is the first time I pay so much for a bluray set (normally get them on sale for half of release price), but it was worth every penny!  Great job!",1416614400,2,257,4.204081632653061

6358850,5,B00JHH21FY,"Peee-Wee is always awesome but, this remastered set is unbelievably great! Compared to what we originally saw on TV, this is like seeing it in person. His suit is a plaid not just grey. The effects are crisp, the color is vibrant and the shows are, of course, still hilarious for kids and adults. If you love Pee-Wee, this is a do not miss!!!",1415836800,5,342,4.359375
6358851,2,B00JHH21FY,Disappointing. This is NOT 1080p as stated on the box. Furthest from bluesy quality as you can get. Stereo sound and 4:3 aspect ratio. Would recommend saving money and just getting the DVD version.,1415059200,5,197,4.823529411764706
6358852,5,B00JHH21FY,"I cant believe how great this look! The original film they shot on was used for this transfer and it truly looks like it was made yesterday. The special features are really well produced and entertaining. This set is a little pricey, but it's truly worth it. I sit in my lonely little bedroom watching episode after episode and I almost forget that I long for death.",1414800000,22,366,4.477611940298507
6358853,5,B00JHH21FY,"These new discs are much, much better than I anticipated.  I directly compared episode on the old dvds to the new blu ray and the differences were staggering.  Much better focus (the dvd looks almost as bad as a VHS tape), more natural colors, better sound.  The bonus documentaries are also very interesting.

My only real complaint is that it took me several minutes just to get the disc cases out of the outer box.  I'm not sure why they made the box fit so snugly, but I've never struggled so much just to extract a disc's case from an outer box.  I surely didn't want to damage a new item this expensive, so I took my time inserting a credit card between the disc cases and the inside of the box, slowly loosening things up.  I'm now afraid to put the discs back in the outer case since I don't want to deal with that hassle every time I want to watch a show.

As to the show, I assume that if you're looking at the reviews for this set that you're already a fan.  For me, Pee Wee's Playhouse is one of a very few shows that is entertaining for children of all ages.  It's as fun to watch today as it was back in the late '80s when I was in my twenties.",1414281600,31,1158,4.084070796460177
6358854,4,B00JHH21FY,"I've had this set on VHS, then on DVD, and now on Blu-ray.  There is no doubt the quality is MUCH better on this new set of Blu-ray discs.  BUT, this is not in HD format as they say.  At least it is not in HD aspect ratio.  It is in the standard 4:3 like it was when it first came out.  Not a big deal to me overall, but buyer beware.  Still worth getting if you are a fan of the show.",1414281600,4,385,3.5783132530120483
