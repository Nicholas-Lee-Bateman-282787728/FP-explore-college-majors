1881764,5,B000099T4E,"In one sentence, the ""Local Boys"" DVD movie is excellent!
Whether you're looking for a few laughs, action, or a little drama, I highly recommend this movie.
Skeet is your typical all-American kid with an interest in any extreme sport you could imagine, but, like his older brother Randy, their's one sport he's itching to get involved in...surfing.
When Skeet's birthday arrives, Randy and his closest buddies pitch in to buy Skeet a surfboard (even though their boards where stolen by a local surf group called ""The Cleaning Crew""). Randy takes Skeet out to the beach to learn to surf with a board twice the size of the kid, only to run into a beautiful girl he'd met the day before when The Cleaning Crew swiped his board. Skeet's left to struggle with his oversized board, until he runs into a mysterious stranger who seems intent to help him out. The stranger turns out to be Jim Wesley, a local surfing legend rumored to live a hermit-lifestyle after his return from the slammer. When Jim offers to teach Skeet the laws of surfing, Randy (who's been the man of the house for some time) tries to stop his widowed mother from going out with Jim.
I don't want to ruin it for you, but if there's one movie you watch this summer, make ""Local Boys"" a selection. Why it wasn't as commercialized as it should have been is a mystery...",1058918400,6,1331,4.55

1881784,5,B000099T4E,Wonderful film.  The most natural teen movie I've seen in a long time.  The kids were real and so were the adults.  I enjoyed the interaction of the characters.

1881853,5,B000099T4E,"Loved watching Mark Harmon!  story was good, not fantastic, just a period piece if you were into surfing during that time period.  Times have changed, so some might not be able to relate to the characters or the story.",1403136000,,218,4.564102564102564

1881855,4,B000099T4E,"If you want a feel good surfer's movie this is it. Some reference to sex, violence and drugs but not overly pushing it. Families might want to edit some of that stuff out, but for us oldies it is ok. I like Mark Harmon as the widower who decides to re-engage with life after the tragic death of his family.",1393286400,,306,4.116666666666666
1881856,4,B000099T4E,"This is a good movie. I would actually put this at a 4.5 stars if I could. As noted by other viewers, this won't win any awards and is pretty predictable, but for a feel-good movie that revolves around families and surfing, it is a solid film. The acting is wonderful, especially Jeremy Sumpter. He is amazing in this movie. His performance really drives the film, and he is an young actor to watch for. I am a Mark Harmon fan and tuned into this flick because of his work on NCIS. He does not disappoint. All in all, a nice feel-good movie!",1392076800,,541,4.262135922330097

1881859,4,B000099T4E,"The movie was fun,  The kids were appropriately awkward and typical - loved watching them in the water.  Simple surfing moves but still nice to see.  Mark Harmon was handsome as ever and it was fun to see him in the water.  Olsen was awesome.  He looked more buff as a teen than he does now as an adult!  The script is OK, somewhat predictable and simple.  Thought it was ironic that Harmon's character in this movie lost his wife and child in a car accident, considering Gibbs in NCIS lost his family in a car crash as well.  This character also struggled with intimacy and expressing his emotions.  I chose this movie to watch Harmon and was pleasantly surprised by the supporting players and the quality of the movie.",1389312000,,720,4.476923076923077

1881862,5,B000099T4E,"This movie is on my top 20 favorite movies, Why? Well mostly because I could relate to Skeet when I was young, Now that I'm 24 I can relate more to His older brother. My step dad died in 2012 and I had to take care of my family, so in a way I felt for the older brother when he broke down. I also loved the movie because it has surfing in it, and I love surfing as well as sidewalk surfing! The movie does have sad parts, but it is about a young boy learning to surf and his mentor and friend. A great family Movie!!",1382400000,,516,3.787037037037037
1881883,5,B000099T4E,I loved it. You must watch this. It has alot of great beach seans in it. And I love all the characters,1378166400,,102,3.6818181818181817
1881884,5,B000099T4E,Surfing is just the backdrop for a touching story about 2 brothers coping with the loss of their father.  I heartily recommend this movie.,1377475200,,138,4.75
1881885,3,B000099T4E,"Local Boys was a simple movie with a well written script. The actors (especially the young kids) were very good and presented their characters in a very realistic, natural manner (unlike other ""surfer-based"" movies where Keaneau Reeves runs around saying ""duuuuude"" all day). The subject matter is somewhat heavy but very important to the message of the film. Simply put, you have a mother and her 2 young sons (they being the main focus) who are dealing with the loss (death) of their father, and an older ex-surf pro who is dealing with the loss of his wife and daughter. Surfing brings them all together and thus the movie begins to unfold.

I think this would make a good family movie as it teaches a few life lessons and shows, in a realistic way, how difficult relationships and allowing oneself to get close to other people can be. I'd give it 3+ stars if I could, 4-stars for not being over-the-top gushy.",1376352000,,913,4.635802469135802

1881887,5,B000099T4E,"Love Mark Harmon! Mark Harmon's character is Jim Wesley a once famed surfer, who now finds himself being a mentor to a little guy who just loves the sport of surfing in it's purist form, unlike, his older brother who surfs for the chicks and quest for being the best. It's a really great family film, which is hard to find, unless it's animated. This movie is worth purchasing, it will surprise you, especially if you're now an NCIS fan. This film surprised me with how many of the actors have now crossed over to playing on NCIS. Mark's love interest in Local Boys also played Ducky's love interest doctor on NCIS until he found that she tried to ""blow up"" her patient on oxygen using a cigarette as the ignitor. The older brother in this film is Eric Christian Olson who now plays Marty Deeks on NCIS LA.",1369526400,,806,4.416107382550336

1881890,5,B000099T4E,"LOVED this movie.  I confess to being a fan of Mark Harmon since the '70s.  This movie has the elements that should make it a great coming of age movie set against the world of California surfing.  Easy plot, Mark Harmon is a retired world class surfer (trying to cope with personal tragedy) who befriends a young boy just learning to surf.  In the process he becomes involved with the boy's mother and works to win over the older brother.  This films moves at an easy pace and will leave you smiling when all is said and done.  I consider it an underrated gem like Mark Harmon's ""Stealing Home,"" and Bruce Willis' ""Sunset.""  Do yourself a favor and spend the $8 for a great time.",1335225600,,680,4.392

One that seems so realistic in todays world.  The songs and surfing atmosphere was great! There are some really funny parts.  Some of the top selling movies of today I must admit suck.  But when you find movies like this one that probably barely made it to the movies deserve more credit.  Great movie over all. Great music. :]",1190160000,,484,4.370786516853933
1881926,2,B000099T4E,"This film could have benefited from judicious editing. I'll use one example rather than list all. Randy is on the beach at night, by a fire, kissing his very new girlfriend. His friend (I don't remember his friend's name) rushes up spurting sand all around exclaiming his need to talk to Randy right away - ""it's important"". He tells Randy that his mother found his ""stash"", told his Dad, and he would probably have to go into the Marines when his Dad came home. Then he gets up and leaves. ?? That scene made no sense. Why interrupt Randy's ""fun"" with a dire emergency that isn't dire, only to leave fifteen seconds later? It doesn't make sense. That's something I harp on: if something doesn't make sense, either excise it or find a more appropriate place for it where it will make sense. There was a scene further in the film where Randy and his friend were discussing this same topic. Given that, I say the firelight interruption should have been excised.

Another problem was that nobody seemed to care about Jim Wesley (Mark Harmon's much older character) buddying up with 12-year old Skeet for the right reasons. We live in a rather unfortunate age where people cannot leave their children with people they don't know - we all know what I mean. Randy protested Skeet hanging out with Jim, but only for the wrong reasons.

Even with judicious editing, however, I don't feel that this film would have risen to great heights. There were problems with dialogue and interaction as well.

Fixing all of that could have made this mildly entertaining, but we'll never know.",1157500800,2,1572,4.688405797101449
1881927,4,B000099T4E,"I first rented this movie and didn't expect it to be very good because I had never heard of it. However, once I started watching it, I was pleasantly surprised. The story is a coming-of-age adventure where 12-year-old Skeet is interested in nothing more than surfing and hanging with his older brother, Randy. When Randy seems more interested in hanging with beach babes and his friends than teaching Skeet how to surf, the young lad must persue other learning avenues. That's when he meets Jim Wesley, who was a surfing icon back in his day. Skeet and Jim become fast friends and the young boy finds the father figure he so desperatly needs. When Randy discovers his kid brother is hanging out with an older man, he becomes concered and immediatly is very protective of his family. After losing his father and having to deal with his mother's less than stellar boyfriends, Randy isn't taking any more chances with other men hanging around his family. But Jim proves he is kind, worthy of respect, and in it for the long haul despite the pain and pressures Randy and Skeet have on their shoulders.

This is a wonderful movie. I found the story to be a little inconsistent in places, but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film. Jeremy Sumpter, who plays the character of Skeet, proves to be an awesome young actor and I hope we see more of him in coming years (check him out in the newest Peter Pan movie). This film also has some great surfing footage although probably not enough to appease you hard-core surfers out there. But as a surfer myself, I found it to be lots of fun to watch. Check out Local Boys! You won't regret it.",1151193600,4,1643,4.531986531986532
1881928,5,B000099T4E,"from start to finish this movie was excellent. Jeremy Sumpter was best actor thru the entire movie, all others had a good supporting role and the story line was great thru-out the movie. Very good surfing movie. Mark Harmon was a great dad in the end of the movie. A very good ending. Great family move to watch over and over.

1881929,4,B000099T4E,"I like surf movies but find very few of good quality. If you want great surf scenes, watch the documentaries like Step into Liquid.  But this movie combines an easy to follow plot with exceptional Southern California surfing.  For the hard core surfers there won't be enough surf scenes.  But for movie viewers who want surf action, you'll be quite pleased.  A vast improvement over Big Wednesday IMO but not up to Blue Crush which I think has the greatest scenes from a nondocumentary.

But this is a movie with quality actors that is story driven and reminded me of growing up near the ocean with my brother that is the real treat here.  Yes, they have more problems with tragic deaths in two families but they also have plenty of attractive people to fill the screen.  In particular, the love interest of Randy adds quite a bit to the scenery.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie even though the plot is predictable.  The actors are fine and it's a great story with a great conclusion.  I recommend it for light family fare and for those looking for quality surf action.",1093392000,9,1075,4.5811518324607325
1881930,4,B000099T4E,"I had to take off one point for amateurish photography and videotaping. There was a lot of good surfing, but I think a better beach with bigger waves could of been chosen.

If you're just curious, then rent the movie before choosing to buy it.",1090540800,5,380,4.219178082191781
1881931,4,B000099T4E,"""Local Boys"" is a perfect example of what DVD does best:  providing a showcase for a minor-league delight that had no chance at a big-screen release but deserves more than to be dumped on cable TV for just a few lucky insomniacs to catch on the late show.  In short, it is a small gem of a film with a fine cast and promising director that tells a familiar, though moving and involving story.  It also showcases a pair of promising young actors who appear on the brink of stardom and gives a couple of solid pros (and former ""Chicago Hope"" costars) a chance to stretch their acting chops and exhibit their own undeniable chemistry.  And it may be the first surfing movie I have ever seen that actually deals with the teen surfing crowd in a realistic and non-exploitative manner by making its kids more than just brain-dead stoners obsessed with riding waves that would kill the world's best surfers.
Eric Christian Olsen and Jeremy Sumpter star as Randy and Skeet, brothers whose policeman father ""died a hero"" (as Randy likes to say) in the line of duty.  Skeet wants to learn to surf, so Randy buys him a surfboard for his twelfth birthday. But like so many other well-meaning though self-centered older brothers, he buys one that is too big (that way he'll have a spare) and then leaves Skeet to learn on his own.  When legendary surfer Jim Wesley (Mark Harmon) sees Skeet's pitiful attempts at riding a wave, he befriends the boy, buys him a suitable board, and offers to teach him the proper way to surf.  Skeet and Jim become fast friends and Jim even begins a tentative relationship with the boys' mother (Stacey Edwards), much to Randy's displeasure.  (Randy loathes Jim, sees him as a threat to his status as ""man of the house"" and refuses to cut him any slack.)  But Jim has issues of his own to deal with, since his own wife and daughter were killed in a car crash a couple of years before.  And then there's Skeet's unresolved emotional problems surrounding the death of his father to deal with as well--
""Local Boys"" isn't exactly loaded with surprises since you can tell where everything is headed almost before the film starts. But it is done with taste and restraint and a refreshing lack of melodrama, except for a ridiculous suicide attempt late in the film by one of Randy's surfer buds (Guiseppe Andrews), whose father thinks is a lazy, pothead loser (which, incidentally, he is) and is forcing to join the Marines.
As for the brothers' relationship, it is tender and sweetly rendered, yet combative and utterly believable, thanks to the terrific performances of Olsen and Sumpter.  Olsen, who bombed badly in the ""Dumb and Dumber"" sequel ""When Harry Met Lloyd,"" makes Randy likeable even when he's acting like a spoiled jerk, mainly because he never lets the audience lose sight of how much he loves his brother and mother.  He's convinced he's trying to protect them from being hurt by Jim, but in reality, he's protecting himself.  As for Sumpter, he is simply amazing as Skeet, creating a character who is not a mini-adult but a believable, emotionally fragile pre-teen who idolizes his older brother, yet occasionally finds him a major league pain in the you-know-where.  Couple this with his fine performance in Bill Paxton's ""Frailty,"" and the result is a young actor of exceptional promise.
In addition, Harmon and Edwards, who co-starred as lovers on TV's ""Chicago Hope,"" also score solidly and once again make a believable couple.  Harmon, in fact, has developed into a reliable and solid character actor who manages to elevate every scene he's in, no matter how pedestrian.  And he's 100% believable as a surfing legend.  Unfortunately, Edwards, who was magnificent as the deaf ""victim"" in Neal LaBute's ""In the Company of Men,"" is given little to do as the mother, but what she is given she does extremely well.  And Andrews offers amusing support as the pothead friend.
Give credit to director Ron Moler, who does a creditable job on both the character-driven scenes and the surfing sequences, which are refreshingly believable in that they concentrate on surfers riding real waves instead of the ridiculous tidal waves of ""Big Wednesday"" and other recent surfing films.  How refreshing that the director doesn't feel the need to thrill the audience with laughable computer-generated surfing sequences in which normal surfers become superhuman thrill-seekers.  Moler also successfully captures the ""look"" of the Southern California beach scene and it's surrounding neighborhoods.  As for the DVD itself, the presentation is crisp, the sound excellent and is presented in the original aspect ratio of 1:85:1.
In all, this one's a winner.  Surfers can watch it without groaning, and non-surfers will find the story touching and the performances refreshingly good for a direct-to-video release.
Congratulations to one and all.",1089763200,44,4857,4.904761904761905
1881952,5,B000099T4E,"Local Boys was a brilliant film. Having watched it for the first time at home,the start of the film was really good and made me excited to see how it ended.
It is about a family of three whos husband/father died and a mother of two boys who coped well but feels lonely. The older brother has a passion for surfing and his little brother is influenced by this so decides to learn how to tackle the waves!
his big brother wants him to follow his footsteps and doesnt like anyone else taking his place after his father died and is the man of the house. Unfortunately for the older brother , Jim Wesley, a famous surfer meets the little boy when surfing. His older brother disapproves of their bond and because his little brother gets attached, so does the mother. Conflicts around the household takes up but ends very clever as it wasn't what i predicted! It is the type of film that gets you thinking, what will happen next? The boys show their caring side which was emotional. I felt sorry for the older brother as all he wanted to do is protect his family and want to still believe that his father can not be replaced. He is right, though Jim has lost a loved one and does not want any trouble. I thought Jim was going to leave them in the end, as the film cleverly makes the audience believe. However, he sticks around and helps the two boys whilst now having a relationship with their mum. Its a happy ending and a well worth seeing film! I can see it over and over as sometimes you can watch a film and not have seen a part if you get me!!lol
Take the time to review the Local Boys, trust me its excellant. I now own the DVD of it!",1077580800,,1634,4.207006369426751

1881955,5,B000099T4E,"aloha, this isn't a review,but just wanting to say mahalo to all the fine folks out there, especially RICHMOND,VA and ECHOING TWINS on amazon.com who gave us such ""rave"" reviews on our film ""LOCAL BOYS""...first of all, it was an honor to work with such a great director, ron moler...he has been an avid surfer from the south-bay, malibu area for years...he knows what appeals to surfers as a life-style,(ENDLESS SUMMER 2) but he also integrated a great family atmosphere with the script of ""LOCAL BOYS""...our 2nd unit did all the surf footage and we worked under  director rick murray, and director of photograpy, scott dittrich, who between the two of them have at least 75 years in the surfing industry... steve spaulding and i  did all the water cinematography...in the beginning we  had thought about going on ""location"" to exotic islands (tahiti, fiji etc)to get ""perfect surf"", but in the end it was decided too keep it real and just shoot all california locations...that in itself kept it real as far as the california surf families, which is 3-4 generations old...the whole premise and genre of the script...we also wanted to keep the surfers real and in audtioning for the parts we used guys who are some of california's greatest ""under-ground""stars...except for the part of willy the ""k"" who's double was surfed by the great david ""davy-boy"" gonsalves of hawaii, the other great surfers were jonathon pickle, matt king, john roberson,and rick massey...once again thank you richmond, va for your review,(outer banks rock!!!)...and too the echoing twin, thanks for understanding that we ARE NOT taylor steele!!! but we do things with more of a full feature, and in 35mm,not video...forever alooooha, james abubo...capstone pictures,santa monica,ca...",1073088000,4,1758,5.13986013986014
1881956,5,B000099T4E,"Yesterday I puchased a DVD copy of one of the best progressive surf flixz ever made from my local surf shop: ""Momentum I and II"" and I knew that I would get my money's worth because ""Momentum..."" keeps it real. I came across this movie and thought ""another corny surf film about posers and grommets"". I rented it first and upon viewing it, I enjoyed so much, I went out and bought it! Though it may not please the hard-core surf film enthusiast where all that is wanted is frame after frame of surf godz shredding with 3 chord punk rock on the soundtrack, this little surprise has a very good storyboard and surprisingly some really tight frames of wave action. It has a story that not only gravitates around a surf theme, but has emotion that those who may have had heartbreak at home can reflect on. If I want to see some good surf action along with a story that leaves me appreciating family and friends, this little gem gets the ticket.",1071878400,4,940,4.408045977011494
1881957,5,B000099T4E,"Okay, it's admittedly (in some ways) predictable, contrived, & cheesey enough to need a second box of crackers, but it WORKS. It shouldn't, at least on some levels, but it manages to come through on all. I blame the acting. A pretty believeable ensomble even though a couple of the sceans are over the top. Great cast. Excessive praise for Jeremy Sumpter, who plays the easily likeable Skeeter & who was also quite likeable, despite his evil crazed beliefs, in Frailty. I look forward to future endevors by this very talented young actor. His acting ability was crucial to this film, as his character should have (would have) been unbelieveable if not for his talents. & if there's an occassional flaw in the acting or the script, you can easily forgive him due to his likeability. The entire cast comes off as quite likeable, (except of course for the evil surfers) a group you wouldn't mind hanging out with. This is a movie that makes you happy you watched it. It's got some very good surfing footage, a little bit of everything (humor, action, conflict, romance, storyline, etc.) & just the right amount of exactly what it needs. I like this movie all the better because I'd never heard of it before I accidently stumbled upon it as a rental one day. Now I own it. I reccomend that you see it. Surf setting aside, it's just a great movie, you don't have to like surfing to enjoy this film. BTW: Some swearing, but not overmuch of that. Also a bit of dope smoking, but this isn't presented in a positive way, so it remains family friendly. Nothing offensive beyond that. Suitable for the entire family, & likely enjoyed by all.",1067385600,9,1630,4.6048109965635735
1881958,5,B000099T4E,"Two boys upset when their cop-dad gets killed. Older brother over-protective of the younger.  In comes a famous surfer(Mark Harmon) and teaches the younger kid(Jeremey Sumpter) to surf after the older bro finds a girlfriend and ignores lil' bro.
I really liked this movie.  Great surfing and superb acting combined with the breath taking scenery.  I think Jemery Sumpter did a great job as a mentally troubled kid. His brother protected him as best he could even from someone he didn't need protecting from.(Mark Harmon as a widower and I think his part was a little weak).",1065484800,6,573,4.88659793814433
1881959,5,B000099T4E,"This movie was an excellent movie.  It contained all the elements of a good movie about a young boy and his brother and single parent mother struggling to keep up in today's world.
The surfing was a good extra!  Showed a positive and yet some negative(drug use) surrounding the surfing environment.  As a family of surfers, I found the movie to be somewhat on target with surfing and hopefully movies of this type can inspire others to surfing and help clean up the stigma of negative behavior that sometimes go with surfing.
This movie should have received more advertising.  It is well worth the time to watch!",1059868800,6,612,4.691588785046729
1881960,4,B000099T4E,"Surfing is a metaphor for conflict in life, wrestling with nature, trying to control one's destiny amid the ebb and flow of turbulence...
Okay, that's heavy-handed hogwash. This movie isn't profound, and that's why I enjoyed it. The plot is generic, the dramatic events by-the-numbers, but the details are perfect. In a movie like this, you either get the chracters right or the film sinks into melodramatic contrivances that carry the emotional weight of a gulp of diet cola. This movie has a motherlode of engaging characters who add clout to a basic script. Mark Harmon's tormented widower is remote and unwilling to commit, the desire to care struggling to break through his pall of uncertainty. The older sibling conveys anger over the men who enter his mother's life, leave a trail of [stuff], and then disappear like last night's hangover. His performance is an endearing mixture of love, control, and insecurity. Skeeter, as played by Jeremy Sumpter, does an excellent job portraying a boy who wrestles with damaging feelings, desperately hungering for a father figure. He's the type of kid everyone would want as a son, thoughtful, perky, and good-humored. Sumpter is a natural here, outplaying even the veterans. The circle of friends manage to become distinct entities, caring for each other but making mistakes that we can relate to. There are no vulgar jokes or cruelty to others that seem to dominate idiot teen movies, yet I found myself laughing at humor that arises from the chracter's personalities. The dramatic parts work because I liked the people in the movie. They make great company. The script is subtle and sneaks up on you emotionally. Even though issues of depression, abusive adults, and paternal death are addressed, I never felt manipulated. The dialogue is well-handled abd enlightened. And the surfing scenes are intense, showing tricks I didn't think possible. Overall I would recommend this movie based on its sincerity and the good example is sets for human beings who are unsure about how decent humans should act and communicate with one another.",1059264000,8,2084,5.078717201166181
