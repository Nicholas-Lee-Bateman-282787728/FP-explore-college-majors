8296516,2,B00004UDZT,"I saw the trailer for this movie a long time ago and it made it look like the most violent, bloody war movie ever made. Well, it`s not. To make a convoluted story short: three soldiers find some gold and kidnap a vietnamese family to carry it for them while they walk to... someplace. All this is padded with footage from some ""command center"" and ""the present"" where some guy is researching a book. They walk into some boobytraps along the way but apart from three guys setting yet another trap, no vietcong`s, so don`t expect any action. It has a few good moments, the traps, a leg amputation and a ""sort of"" sex scene, but if you want jungle action, WARBUS, THE LAST HUNTER and EASTERN CONDORS are a lot better.",1252108800,,714,4.416666666666667
