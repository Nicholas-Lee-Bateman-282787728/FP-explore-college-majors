8365072,5,B002DFQQBW,Bought this for my husband (the man who has everything) for Christmas.  The family watched the first two cd's together on Christmas Eve and laughed till we cried.  It was nice to share a piece of TV history with the younger generation.  This can be watched over and over without tiring of the humor.  Thanks for the great value.,1328313600,,328,4.508474576271187
