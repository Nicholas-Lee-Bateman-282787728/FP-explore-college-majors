8297498,5,B001EBIRCC,It is one of my favorite most challenging Cathe workouts from back in the day. The last section is really tough but that's why I love it. Killer workout  with interesting moves. You need to take your time learning the choreography but that keeps you focused while exercising. I have been doing this routine almost 20 years and still love it!,1401408000,,341,4.590163934426229
