7817212,5,6301933451,"I was a little disappointed when I discovered that this VHS was available only in NTSC format (I have been informed it is available on Region 2 DVD), though I do have a VHS machine that can playback NTSC on a PAL system.
Starring the lead voice-talent of British comedy great, David Jason (Only Fools and Horses, Open All Hours, Darling Buds of May, The BFG), Danger Mouse depicts a childish yet wildly amusing array of wit, charisma, classic slapstick and a satirical view on secret agents.
I especially loved this series as a child and I enjoy it just as much as an adult.",1026864000,2,574,4.476190476190476
7817213,4,6301933451,"I just love this cartoon!  I'm not a big fan of British comedy, either.  I used to watch it with my mom when I was little.  This show beats out Mighty Mouse any day.",1024099200,,165,3.7941176470588234
7817214,5,6301933451,I just love Danger Mouse cartoons all of them. I haven't seen them since i was a child. I't a good little flick that is very funnie and entertaining. It was on Nickoldeons early years. It also made a spin-off show called Count Duckcula. That was very hilarious to watch.,1016064000,,270,4.42
7817215,4,6301933451,Danger mouse is one of my all-time favorite old cartoons.  It's like british humor in a cartoon.  I remember watching it as a child and now that I've grown I realize that there is so much more to Danger Mouse than I remembered.  There's a lot of hidden inuendo in here. (Like the clouds shaped like various parts of the human annatomy.)  Very funny.  I wish they still aired this show.  It's a classic.  -(V)az,1007164800,,410,4.386666666666667
7817216,3,6301933451,"I just purchased the first 2 volumes of this collection from Amazon, mainly because I was a big fan of DM when the show ran on Nickelodeon back in the 1980s, and also because I thought my partner Greg (who enjoys British humour) might get a kick out of it. If you were ever a fan of Danger Mouse, I would recommend you get these tapes because I think it rather unlikely they'll ever be released on DVD.
HOWEVER: I have some mixed feelings about these collections. My main beef is that instead of simply giving us the cartoons individually (opening titles, then cartoon, then closing credits), the 3 or 4 cartoons on each tape are linked with a segues in which the ""DM"" logo is frozen onscreen while the narrator or various other characters do some ostensibly humorous ""backstage"" commentary and ... stuff. It's actually kind of annoying, and while watching the 2nd volume Greg & I ended up fast-forwarding past it to the next episode.
ALSO: Fans of Danger Mouse who only remember the show from Nickelodeon may find themselves a bit confused by the voice of Stiletto, the incompetent trench-coated henchman (or should I say ""hench-crow"") for Baron Silas Greenback. Watching DM on Nickelodeon back in 80s, I distinctly remember Stiletto having a Cockney accent ... but on these tapes he speaks like a ""paisano"" Italian stereotype. This leads me to believe that Nickelodeon, concerned that Italian-Americans might be offended by the Italian mafioso ster, sought changes in Stiletto's voice after they secured the rights to broadcast Danger Mouse in the U.S.
That having been said, these cartoons are still a lot of fun to watch, with their awful puns and wacky yet dry British humour. Penfold (DM's hamster assistant) still cracks me up, and of course everyone loves Greenback's caterpillar pet, Nero.",974073600,13,1798,4.879084967320262
7817217,5,6301933451,"Absolutely essential viewing for any self respecting Dangermouse fan, or for anybody who hasn't yet experienced this the finest cartoon ever made.  DM and Penfold get up to all sorts of jiggery pokery - all over the  universe. Worth buying for the 'Womablid Custard Mite of Glut' alone, oh  how we laughed...",953769600,4,308,4.884615384615385
