2810836,5,B000P5FH2Q,"This box set looks cool, but you would really really have to be a fan to fork out $150 for this.

I picked up the first season for about $25 at a sci-fi convention, which if you are looking for obscure things on DVD, that is the place to go. I know it was not an ""official"" release, but the quality and packaging was top rate.

Bottom line, if you look around at conventions or Ebay, you can get the same thing for way under a $100.",1180483200,4,432,3.954022988505747

2810843,5,B000P5FH2Q,"HOORAY Land of the Giants will finnally be on DVD. It was one of my favorite Irwin Allen sereies it had great special effects for its time and some interesting stories and great actors such as Kurt Kazenar (Fitsugh) who is like their version of Lost in Space's Dr Smith and actors such as Kevin Hagen who would later become Doc. Baker in Little House on the Prarie played the Inspector in this series.

I am looking forward to it being released on DVD , the only problem I have is that it will be released on Double Sided discs  and there will be two episodes on one side and four on another which dosn't make sense but I will enjoy them just the same.

It is a must for all Irwin Allen fans.  So definately 5 out of 5 for them",1177718400,9,727,4.098591549295775

2810855,4,B000P5FH2Q,"Would someone please explaln to me why this DVD set is still (in my view) ridiculously overpriced even though it's been out now for over nine years ?
One would think that the initial demand would have cooled down by now, but thus the price would have dropped.
As for own personal views on this series, I was a big fan of it back when it was in prime-time.  Granted, it was rather silly, but it was quite watchable.",1474243200,,414,4.2405063291139244
2810856,2,B000P5FH2Q,"As others have said, the price is outrageous.  Not Amazon's fault, but all I wanted to see is this series that I remember liking as a kid in the 70's and haven't seen since.  I can buy a region 2 set from the UK for under $25 - even linked to from Amazon.

I was under 10 when I first watched these and I liked them.  But, I was just a kid and I haven't seen them since.  All I have is this fond memory of this world where the people were toy-sized.  I have no idea whether the adult me will even like the show.  And I'm not going to pay over $200 to satisfy my curiosity.  I don't need all the extras, which are always just a gimick anyways.  Oh, a book of pictures, a keychain, a patch, and a toy?  Well gee whiz, charge me another $150 for that!  No thanks, just the DVDs please.  IMO, this is an obscure series.  I have not seen it in reruns that I know of.  And for something this old, don't price it out of the price range of the curious.  I can find many other old TV series for a LOT cheaper.  I think I just picked up season 1 of Batman 66 for $15.  And that was WAY more popular.

And that brings me to the content.  Since they were so enormously priced, I watched some of these on the internet and I was absolutely right for not buying these.  The quality is poor (hopefully the DVDs aren't), but even so, I got to see the stories and they are horrible.  I'm at the point of hoping they get captured and dissected by the giants because I can't stand them.  They have no survival instincts whatsoever and are so mind-numbingly stupid.

And some of that I can forgive.  That's the way shows were in the '60s.  You have one character who's especially annoying analogous to Dr. Smith on Lost in Space.  You have a boy, a couple of girls, and your young handsome adventure type guy.  This is almost exactly the Lost in Space demographics without the family aspect.  And people over-reacted because that's what they thought people had to act.

The impossible feats keep gnawing at me.  Like moving around their little forest faster than the giants.  In the third episode, they manage to follow a giant home.  How?  For every step a giant takes, they should have to make what?  12 steps?  They'd better be Olympic quality sprinters to keep up.  If he walks a mile to his house, that's 12 miles for the little people.  What takes 20(?) minutes for him would be like doing a half marathon for the little people.  It's like saying you're going to follow a car on foot.  There of course are the changing sizes.  At one point, they look like they're maybe 6 inches, but at other times they seem either smaller or larger.  In the 3rd episode two of them fit inside a camera.

In one episode, they wander into a miniature model town which turns out to be their size, built for previous Earth visitors.  Kind of like one of the Twilight Zone episodes.  They go into the one building that apparently doesn't have a roof and they don't seem to realize that.  How can you not?  You should be able to recognize real sunlight from above.  And then they're worried the giants will find them.  How about going to a building WITH a roof?

It just drives me nuts every episode of how utterly stupid they are.  Maybe other seasons are better.  Though I'm hesitant to watch.

Of course I know now that the whole concept of giants that look like us is impossible due to the square/cube rules.  That they may be 12 times taller, but they'd weigh 1,728 times as much with the cross-sectional area of their bones being only 144 times as much.  They'd have a very difficult time moving and probably break limbs constantly.  Unless there's less gravity.  But that would also mean the little people would be able to jump about like Superman.  Why climb to a table-top when they can jump?  But it's still a fun idea.  Though impossible.

I do give them credit for coming up with props week after week.  And doing what they did to film it all.  Even so, the special effects are evident which takes away from watching the story.  I'd like to see it done today with writers who would make the characters and plots smarter and with green screen effects for today's audiences.

Maybe someday I'll find a cheap copy at a used DVD store.",1473811200,,4207,4.29923273657289
2810857,5,B000P5FH2Q,"One of my favorite tv series ever.  Great adventure premise, good likable cast, excellent special effects, and the sight of Deanna Lund and Heather Young in short skirts and boots courtesy of costume designer Paul Zastupnevich in every episode made it worthy.  The little people had the resourcefulness and determination to survive their giant-sized predicament even if they can be rendered helpless very easily when grabbed by giant hands or taped down by scotch tape...which gave them a great sympathetic underdog interest for root for.  The stories could have used some character development but Irwin Allen wanted ""all action, all the time""....which was done well.

The box set is pricey but the collectible extras and seeing all 51 episodes plus the rare pilot with different scenes all in pristine premiere broadcast condition are worth it.",1470355200,,846,5.2444444444444445

It was so interesting that sometimes I thought it was real and the actors were reduced in size to fit the film.

But just from the box and the way it is packaged it blew me away. In my opinion if your a fan of the series it is well worth the price just from a collectable stand point. I never thought I was going to be able to get this because at one point all I could find was priced at $300.00 plus. I have yet to watch any of the series yet but I expect the picture quality will be on par as what I rented from Netflix a few years ago.,1452470400,3,576,3.889830508474576

Great special features too - I love the audio commentary from the cast. Stefan Arngrim steals the show with his vast knowledge of film history and his slightly skewed sense of humor - he amazes his fellow cast members with cool trivia about the show and his commentary rocks! Nice to have the entire cast together again (except for Kurt Kasznar unfortunately) to reminisce about the show - everyone sounds great and is having such a good time they make you feel like you're part of the conversation.

2810910,3,B000P5FH2Q,"The set is a great idea, well thought of, except that the discs are all double-sided. Double-sided discs are thankfully now almost been relegated to history, but they were used when this set was produced. Usually I don't have many problems with them, except that here they are housed in SLIM dvd cases, so the discs have very little between each other.
The sets were produced in 2007, so that is a whole 5 years the discs have had time to spin in the cases and get scratched between each other and the dirt that comes from the wooden box and dust.
The result in my case was that all discs (except disc 9, housed alone in the last case) are very very scratched.
Very. They look horrible. Be warned.
Also be informed that now the set has been issued in the UK and amazon carries it. It is much cheaper and it is recorded on 14 discs, double-layered, so it means single-sided.
Your decision. I am not asking Amazon for a replacement, because I would have to pay custom taxes again given the high set price.

On the other hand, the show looks pristine and complete. Of course all the episodes are out of chronological order, as originally aired. A google search will lead you to several fan sites giving you the correct production order.",1355184000,4,1233,4.45575221238938

2810913,4,B000P5FH2Q,"The ""Land of the Giants"" TV series ran for two seasons, from September 1968 to September 1970. It was set in the then-future of 1983 telling the tale of a crew and passengers in a sub-orbital transport spaceship (the Spindrift) which was en route from Los Angeles to London via an ultra-fast parabolic trajectory that would take the ship temporarily into space. But when the spaceship encounters a strange space storm they are transported to a mysterious planet where everything is much larger than on earth, where the civilization is run by a totalitarian government with inhabitants that look humanoid. This was one of the most interesting TV series from the 1960s and was produced by Irwin Allen (Lost in Space).

The ""Land of the Giants"" limited edition set comes in a sturdy wooden cage that resembles a mice cage. The 9 DVDs are in 5 slim dvd cases that slip easily into wooden slots so they ship fully protected. Each DVD is secured into each side of its slim plastic DVD case so none of the discs touch. The discs are double sided. Included are all 51 episodes as well as the unaired pilot episode. The episodes look very good as they are crisp and clean with deep blacks, and have apparently been remastered. Also included is a miniature reproduction of the original comic book, a cast interview booklet, a crew patch, postcards, and a keychain. Special features include cast interviews.

However, today it dropped 60 do11ars to 121 so I did order it. Much more reasonable. As long as it has dropped to this rate, I recommend buying this set. I just received it so I can only describe the unique packaging as I looked through this limited collectors edition. I now understand why the prices were so far out of whack with other DVD sets.

This is the most unusual DVD packaging I have ever seen. A real wood box with a sliding front with wire and what looks like a pressed tin lunch box image of the cast behind the wire to look like they are trapped inside the box. The set includes a shoulder patch, Key chain, photos and a mini comic book. The DVD cases are slid into slots inside the wood box. This is where the problem is. The plastic cases warp without support in the middle, thus the DVD's pop out and the package won't stay closed as the warping increases. The cover and photos are all artificially distressed to look like this is a very old antique. It was very convincing design... but not practical... however, it isn't uncomon to see these types of plastic cases for DVD's. Especially for TV series. Nearly all of this type of cases had the same problem of the DVD's popping loose and allowing them to slide around inside the case and become damaged.

...but if they jack the price back up again to the outrageous level it was... then you should boycott it until reason has been restored. This packaging may look antique but it is only a 2007 release and the packaging is not conducive to protecting the DVD's from damage. As customers, you do have the power to pressure outrageous pricing by refusing to buy. If they can't sell it at those prices... then they accomplish nothing by trying to pillage the public.

Don't let shill commenters affect your purchasing either. Sellers, including Amaz0n themselves, will have employees, friends and relatives place ""staged"" commentaries to alter your purchasing habits... especially when they try to make you feel like it is your last chance to get something... the sellers do NOT control manufacturing or quantity of product availability.

Be especially suspicious of any commenters who attack another reviewer for warning about crooked dealings from sellers such as price jacking and other underhanded tricks. It is usually the seller behind attacks on reviewers who are trying to warn the public...

However, at the current 121, it is a good time to buy the Land of the Giants. Get it while you can at this lower price... but be careful on checkout to make sure the price has not increased between the time you placed it in your cart and the time you check out. I had Amaz0n pull this on me on another TV series... by 75 dollars in less than an hour. It was deliberate but I caught it at the last minute and cancelled it. So, be careful and doublecheck all prices before you click that final purchase confirmation.",1291075200,5,3008,4.571428571428571
2810943,5,B000P5FH2Q,"I had put off buying this product, but finally caved.

I'm so glad I did. I'm a dedicated LOTG fan so this was a much anticipated gift to myself. It is impressively packaged and put together, the extras are both fun and great nostalgia, all 'aged' in keeping with the vintage nature of this 40 year old series.  I immediately watched the last disc with all the interviews and the behind the scenes extras and enjoyed them all hugely, (despite the 'behind the scenes' not having any sound). It was just a buzz to be able to see Irwin Allen's home movies at all!
I also watched a couple of my favourite episodes in season two and was instantly impressed with the quality of the images, not only crisp, clear and colorful, but so much better lit than the recent off-air copies available. With the improved quality you can see so much more of the action and interaction between the actors and the props, it was like someone shining a torch on the scenes, or having someone finally washing the lens between you and the scene playing out. Magic.
I would love to buy another set just to keep it in it's boxed condition, but that will have to wait for me to win lotto. For me, this boxed set was worth every penny, and to have this series available in all its original perfection, and for any fan of the series, it's a 'must have'.",1288915200,3,1323,4.373983739837398
2810944,5,B000P5FH2Q,"The quality of audio and image here is amazing. The restoration job was evidently made with great care (the same goes for the ""Time Tunnel"" sets).

Seeing it now, I realized how amazing this show really was for its time. The episodes are 50 minutes-long. Special effects were the best of the Irwin Allen shows. And boy, the cast really works here! Always running, climbing, dodging.

Of course, this is a typical action show of the 60s. Character development is close to zero. Once the heroes fall on the other dimension, each episode is an action-paced feast. You'll never see on of them longing for a relative from Earth, or parents, wives, whatever. And, unfortuantely, like many old shows, it was cancelled abruptely, so there is no closure. Poor Captain Burton and friends must be trapped in the other dimension until today...

Acting is top notch, both by the ensemble cast or the giants.

As for the release of this show only in this limited edition form, I don't care. I paid for it with a smile on my face. It was a show I was hoping they would release some day.",1280275200,4,1071,4.5625
2810945,1,B000P5FH2Q,"Land of the Giants was a great part of growing up for those of us of a certain vintage! All of Irwin Allen's series from that era had their merits, and when you consider some of the garbage fed to kids today we should consider ourselves lucky.  Here comes the BUT.  This price tag is ludicrous!!  Why can't someone bring out a basic set which we fans can enjoy?  Or a middle range set with some of the extras, say the interviews and commentaries.  It really is crazy that this hasn't happened already.  Time Tunnel, Lost in Space and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea aren't priced this way.  Even if you consider this the best of the four it's still baffling, not to say down right annoying.  Sort it out someone please!

2810946,5,B000P5FH2Q,Undoubtedly one of the best series produced by Irwin Allen to the TV!!! A series that should not miss on the shelves of collectors of classic TV series!!!! Highly recommended!!!!,1271894400,2,178,4.966666666666667
2810947,2,B000P5FH2Q,"I am a huge fan of 60's television, and would love to add Land Of The Giants to my collection.  I saw it as a kid, during its original run, and it was an extremely entertaining, and compelling show that I never forgot.  In the science fiction genre, it ranks with Star Trek, The Time Tunnel, and The Invaders, as one of my favorites from the 1960's.  Science fantasy master Irwin's Allen's creation had a terrific cast, good stories, and very believable cutting edge special effects.  Being a fan of the crew of the Spindrift, the main reason that this classic show is not in my collection is because the price is too high, and I refuse to support releases that gouge loyal fans.

Initially, Get Smart (138 episodes on 25 single sided discs), and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (105 episodes on 41 single sided discs), were exclusively being sold by Time Life, for $199.95 and 249.95 respectively.  When these sets were first released to the general public, they were often available on sale at Amazon as Deals of the Day, at great savings.  The Get Smart set currently sells for $86.99 and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. set is currently $139.90.  Like The Land of the Giants, both Get Smart, and The Man From U.N.C.L.E., had special packaging and extensive extras.

Unlike the series sited above, which have dropped in price at least 40%, the price for the Land of the Giants has remained high since its initial release.  For $187.49 you are getting 51 episodes, on nine double sided discs.  That's right, that big huge box, contains just nine disks!  Compare that to the 41 disks in the less expensive U.N.C.L.E. set.  Just as a rough comparison, at current regular prices, an episode of Land of the Giants costs about $3.68, versus $1.33 for an episode of The Man From U.N.C.L.E.  While the price has come down slightly, the Land of the Giants set was grossly overpriced from the start, and double sided discs just do not belong in a premium quality release.

Land of the Giants, was a fun series.  Kurt Kazsnar was fabulous, and Gary Conway and Don Marshall made a great team.  I would greatly enjoy seeing the program again, but unfortunately it probably  won't happen, unless the price comes way down, or I can get the set used for much.  Instead of buying The Land of the Giants, for the same money, I can get a big stack of DVD's of other television shows.",1269043200,6,2351,4.5680190930787585
2810948,4,B000P5FH2Q,"I have thus far watched a disc or two of this classic show. This was a show that I had remembered from my youth. As an adult the show is hardly as exciting but still it provides some campy entertainment. The quality of the video seems to be pretty high. The show though is rather dumb. The passengers of the Spindrift encounter someone every week in the middle of some forest. Still the group is never to far to venture into some urban setting.

Anyway, the packaging is BAD. I say this because the plastic cases are not able to secure the double sided discs from being damaged. The cases are separated by a wooden slat. There is no pressure on the plastic cases and so the discs fall off of the retainer rings. The first thing I did was to put each disc in a paper sleeve to protect each one from damage. Through two discs thus far all of the shows play just fine. One piece of wood that holds the screen in the front of the package is coming loose. I need to tack a brad into the frame to hold that piece of wood together. All in all I think the CONCEPT of the PACKAGE was quite GOOD. Somebody surely MEANT well but in reality the dvds are in very real danger of being damaged.

Anyway, I have been pleased to see this very old show once again. It brings back some very EARLY childhood memories of watching television.",1268265600,3,1320,4.213438735177865

I love to display the Little People Trap (which you will see in the episodes!), its a great conversation piece and a neat little replica prop from the series.  The video quality is about as good on dvd as I have seen, the menus and disc startup is not a hassle (which makes a difference when you are watching hours and hours of a series like this and will load these discs countless times).  The only negative I have experienced is the dvd cases are warped.  This is due to the fact this set is about 3 years old now and the packaging had it so the slim line dvd cases were suspended and they sagged in the middle over time.

2810954,3,B000P5FH2Q,"Loved the show as a kid, still think it is fun today.  My kids seem to enjoy it too.  I'm not going to be critical of the show.

However, this package disappoints.  It is far less than I expected.  The box is cool.  And the way the DVDs are stored inside is cool too.  The extras were worth about $5.  And the most disappointing thing was that the DVD folders were all seriously warped in the box when I got it.  It seemed that the package I received had been stored in an unacceptably hot area for some prolonged period of time.  I don't know how the disks themselves escaped damage, though there was some minor scarring on a few.  And I haven't been able to find suitable replacement disk folders either.

This is worth some extra than a basic set of the whole series alone would be, but not what I paid.  Wait until it is under $100 or they release just the series at a more reasonable price.

2810955,4,B000P5FH2Q,"This is the only ""Complete"" Irwin Allen series I have bought.  The box is kind of funky until I watched the WHOLE series again.  Now the box makes sense.

The only complaint I have is there is no real indication that there is a 2nd side to the DVDs.  I watched all the DVDs and thought? ""Hey didn't I miss an episode or two?""  Looking on the box I figured it out that I had to turn OVER the DVDs.  Duh.. but once again.  There should have been a SIDE II printed on the DVD.

The Extras are pretty lame.  I do like the ""Patch"" but the comix is small.

The real disappointment with this collection is the video extras.  If all they had was a few interviews.. they should have included a large paperback book that explains everything.  I don't think as a ""Fan"" or ""filmmaker"" I have to scrounge Amazon to find ""Land of the Giants the real story"" to go beyond the extras presented on the DVD. This set was lacking.  Nice ideas.. but this could have easily been a 5 stars in my book.

Albeit, this set is way too expensive, it was well worth the wait, as from what I have heard, the prints are in great shape, and are far more watchable than any of the past Irwin Allen Fox DVD releases to date.

It also helps that LOTG was Irwin Allen's best effort to date, being overall less silly than some of his past efforts.  LOTG has to be my favorite Irwin Allen show of all, due to the fact that most of the plots were far less childish than some of his past efforts, each episode concentrating more on belivable characters and much more action/adventure filled plotlines.

It is a bit on the expensive side but you do get what you pay for & as I live in the UK it was cheaper for me to import than get on ebay or through a UK website. Brilliant.",1202601600,5,763,3.7160493827160495

2810982,5,B000P5FH2Q,"I LOVE THIS SERIES but then again, I already OWN just about all the other Irwin Allen DVD sets in full (and I've just about gotten my Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea set now complete).  As many have said, yes the nostalgia element for those of us in the 40 something range who remember this as a first run series will probably love to have this item.  Sure it's a bit campy but ALL Irwin Allen is campy, that's why many of us love them.  I actually have only viewed the first side of the first DVD in the set (and I must admit I had to jump to the unaired pilot, which I actually liked hearing the Lost in Space music, even though I really do love Johnny Williams as he was known back then music) this one seems to be of excellent quality.

Now on to the packaging -- in a word STINKS!!!
The added extras, well I could probably live without the patch, the keychain, the postcards and the comic book NICE TO HAVE but not necessary, maybe it did help to sell to some people but I purchased the set only to have the DVD's.  The worst thing, however, about the packaging has again been said by others.  When the DVD's get shipped, they don't stay in the DVD jewel cases and this can cause damage to the discs even though the wooden box is still SHRINK WRAP SEALED!!!  I believe there should be better quality controls at the FACTORY before shipping the product out.  The Amazon Marketplace Vendor who shipped me this item was MOST careful to include LOT'S of bubblewrap and peanuts in the packing so that wasn't where the fault lies.  The DVD jewel cases aren't made very well and they allow the discs to come loose during shipment NOT necessarily from your vendor.  Since they are still shrinkwrapped, how's the vendor going to know if there is a problem or not?

I also have a beef with a company who charges this much and then skimps on materials, especially using double sided DVD's instead of the industry standard single sided ones.  THIS PART IS RIDICULOUS!!!!  In the early days of DVD production when costs were relatively high, it was understandable WHY this was done.  Now with the advent of home DVR's where making DVD's from broadcast TV or your own home movies has become relatively commonplace (and by its very nature affordable) paying this much for a double sided edition of ANYTHING is price gouging!!!!!

OK I've had my say, all in all I do like the series, I just wish that more care would be taken when going into production.  Even though it's a ""Limited Edition"" that should make the product be of BETTER quality, not less.",1198368000,13,2541,4.397435897435898

I wasn't interested in most of the extras in the collectors' set, though the coupon for discounts on other volumes of Irwin Allen series will be helpful.

2810997,4,B000P5FH2Q,"Irwin Allen was a man before his time. He knew what the public wanted to see on televison and on film and, say what you will about his productions, he gave the viewers what they wanted for many years. His final successful TV sci fi effort was Land of the Giants, which lasted two seasons and 51 episodes and boasted some of the most amazing special effects of its time (1968-1970).
  When 20th Century-Fox released the complete set of episodes on DVD this year I was like a kid a Christmas. The set comes in an attractive carrying case made of wood that resembles a trap the giants often used on the unsuspecting ""little people"" as well as a keychain, mini-comic book reprint, postcards and a spiffy Spindrft crew patch to sew on that bright red uniform you've been hiding in your closet all these years.
  But of course the best part of the package is the 51 episodes in all their unedited glory and in full color, many of which I hadn't seen in over thirty years. Sure, some if not most of the plots were corny and dated but it's evident that Allen and his talentd staff put a lot of time and effort into the sets, (giant) props and special effects and they stand up well even to today's CGI extravaganzas and are still fun to watch.
  So pop some popcorn, open a big bottle of soda, shut off your phone and be ready to be entertained in a GIANT way! This set is well worth the  price tag and the interviews alone will keep you watching for months to come.",1191974400,6,1458,4.299270072992701

Sure, the price tag is hefty, but if you wait for one of Amazon's frequent sales on TV sets, you'll get hours of enjoyment and a big bargain all in one fell swoop.",1191974400,,409,3.9397590361445785
2810999,4,B000P5FH2Q,"The year was 1968 and producer Irwin Allen had already taken TV viewers on a ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,"" gotten them ""Lost in Space,"" and thrown them through ""The Time Tunnel.""  He decided that it was time now to go a journey to a ""Land of the Giants.""

Fans and critics alike feel that Allen was influenced by the respective films ""Dr. Cyclops"" (1940) and ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" (1957) and that is a fair assessment.  The show deals with the crew and passengers of a suborbital flight in the year 1983 that is somehow transported to a realm where they are ""six inch oddities"" in a land of gargantuan proportions.  The setting allowed the creative staff to place the seven principal cast members in all sorts of situations/dangers, making for possibly Allen's most visually striking and ""serious"" endeavor.  Though geared toward a young audience, the show occasionally showcased more adult themes than either of the producer's other three television efforts.  Such change may have been the result of the influence of NBC's ""Star Trek"" which was in the last season of its three-year run when ""Land of the Giants"" debuted.

It also appears that some aspects of the show were more innovative than it was then perceived.  One is in the casting.  Don Marshall, who played co-pilot ""Dan Erickson,"" was one of the few black Americans on network television with a pivotal role.  The character was sometimes allowed to be the decision maker and shared close quarters with white female co-stars Deanna Lund (""Valerie"") and Heather Young (""Betty""), something that was revolutionary in the late sixties-early seventies.  Allen may not have considered that in his hiring of Marshall but it does elevate the actor to ""trailblazer status.""

Also, Young's real-life pregnancy was obvious in the second season, leading to speculation that her character and one of the male characters may have been doing more than just ""struggling to survive.""  She was conveniently filmed standing behind other characters or with some prop hiding her ""development"" or she was conveniently absent from the story line altogether.

The ""little people,"" as they were referred to by the inhabitants of this unusual realm, encountered friendly giants, sadistic giants, life-threatening balloon rides, hallucination-inducing mushrooms, mad scientists, diamond/jewelry thieves, as well as the usual assortment of ""silver-suited"" aliens common to Allen productions.  The land in which the Earthlings found themselves was a police state, of sorts, and they found themselves relentlessly pursued by Inspector Kobick, well played by Kevin Hagen, a frequent performer in Allen productions.

Not only did the seven principals have to make their situation believable, they had to endure the physical challenge of running, climbing, and handling giant props and impressive set designs...and did the creative staff give them a lot with which to work.  Some oversized objects included hydrants, cameras, a dog's leash, a menacing mop, test tubes, a hungry chicken, drains, a horse's rein, anything that the storyline imagined.

It is obvious that each of them, including the fifty-something Kurt Kaszner (""Commander Fitzhugh""), was in pretty good shape.

The show's production values included inspired casting in most episodes.  There were actors that were in Allen's ""repertory company"" and they could be seen in all of the producer's series.  These included John Carradine, Lee Meriwether, John Crawford, Warren Stevens, Nehemiah Persoff, Malachi Throne, Michael Ansara, Paul Fix, Jonathan Harris, and the producer's future wife Sheila Matthews. In addition to those familiar faces, Oscar winners Broderick Crawford and Jack Albertson appear in one installment, respectively.

Boxers-turned-occasional actors Sugar Ray Robinson and Jerry Quarry find themselves featured as giants on the show, too.

Also, years before they hit it big in their signature roles, ""Land of the Giants"" showcased the efforts of future stars Susan Howard (""Dallas""), Vic Tayback (""Alice""), and Sam Elliott (""Lifeguard,"" ""The Hulk,"" and the upcoming ""The Golden Compass"").

Even a certain Oscar-winning director by the name of Ron Howard pops up as a ""special guest star"" in one episode!

The nine-disc (four two-sided and a single) showcases the fifty-one installments with much better sound and picture than their original airings, a plus for an almost forty-year-old show.  On the ninth disc are found insightful reflections from stars Gary Conway (""Steve""), Don Matheson (""Mark""), Lund, Marshall, and Stefan Arngrim (""Barry"").

The Gold Key comic is a great addition, especially for those of us fortunate to have read one during its publication.

Besides the nifty carrying case, a true bonus is the addition of the UNAIRED original pilot, minus John William's outstanding score.  Though the pilot featured the composer's music written for ""Lost in Space,"" the revamped pilot, ""The Crash,"" takes on a much more exciting dynamic with the music that he composed for the actual premiere episode.

Though it may not go down as one of the great shows of all time, ""Land of the Giants"" is still a remarkable bit of television production and this GIGANTIC compilation set does it justice.",1191110400,61,5227,5.300606060606061
2811000,4,B000P5FH2Q,"I've been watching this series through Netflix.  I started only because I wanted to see the first episode, since I missed that one when the show was briefly syndicated back in the mid-seventies.  I'm continuing because, to my surprise, the show is quite good.  Unlike Lost In Space, LOTG quickly establishes the personalities of the characters.  As the series progresses, the characters show at least a bit of depth and complexity.  Fitzhugh is craven and self-centered, but he is, at times, altruistic and faithful to his companions.  Betty is a nurturing peacekeeper (good in a stewardess), but she is quite ready and able to kick the crap out of a punk captor when necessary.  There is a strong component of volatile character interaction that was dreadfully weak and altogether too predictable in other Irwin Allen shows.  In fact, I think that the acting and writing in LOTG can better be compared to the disaster films that Allen did so successfully in the mid-seventies.  While I'd not classify this show as a classic (heck, for me, all Irwin Allen sci-fi/fantasy shows amount to guilty pleasures), I do think that it was surprisingly well done and is on a level footing with most of VTTBOTS.  When the price comes down, I'll buy it.",1190937600,5,1240,4.834123222748815

The last disk has a set of extras including interviews with Deanna Lund, Don Matheson, Don Marshall, Gary Conway and Stefan Arngrim.
The prints are perfect.

Fox's use of double-sided discs and the poorly designed box almost guarantee the discs will come loose and risk damage.  After two trys I just decided to give up and get my money back.  I am very disappointed...not in the show but in the packaging of this edition.

To add to this, now that I have returned this twice defective product for a refund Amazon charged me for the shipping label!

2811017,5,B000P5FH2Q,"This long-awaited release of Irwin Allen's last TV show of the 1960's,
does not disappoint! It was the most expensive show on Television at the
time of it's initial airing and is, what seems to be the most expensive
TV show released on DVD thus far! This is an ultra-nice special edition,
though! The extras are very nice, very well done. The most important thing
to me is the quality of the episodes themselves, though.
As another reviewer noted, these are superior to the
Columbia House DVD releases of a couple years ago.
I can tell you it is far superior!!!
The visual image quality makes this show so riveting, I can't turn away
from the it! This show should definitely be watched at night to appreciate
it in the best way. The earliest episodes(probably #'s 1-19, or thereabouts),
best showcase the strange planet's atmosphere and the environment that the
seven castaways of the Spindrift find themselves within. The forest that they
have landed in has a strange, enchanting, magical feeling to it-very dark and
mysterious. The vivid, bright colors of the outfits that the cast wear(and their
spaceship, the Spindrift), stand out intensely amid the dark surroundings.
As stated in an earlier review, the episodes make the most sense when watched
in the production order they were originally made in. These are as follows
(for the first 19 episodes):
01. The Crash
02. The Weird World
03. The Trap
04. The Bounty Hunter
05. The Golden Cage
06. The Lost Ones
07. Manhunt
08. Framed
09. The Creed
10. The Flight Plan
11. Underground
12. Double Cross
13. On A Clear Night-You Can See Earth
14. Ghost Town
15. Brainwash
16. Terror-Go-Round
17. Sabotage
18. Genius At Work
19. Deadly Lodestone(sequel to The Creed).
The ABC network/and or 20th Century Fox, made a tremendous mistake in not airing
these episodes in the proper sequence, as there is important character develop-
ment in so many of these(""The Bounty Hunter"" was the 15th episode shown
and doesn't make a whole lot of sense that far in, when it was the 4th
episode filmed!""The Trap"", is another obviously early entry).
The second season of Giants(filmed on a somewhat decreased budget), although
done in a different way, is still very fascinating.
There are alot of the kind of the same sort of stories
about helping various giants out of fixes(like in the first season),
but more interestingly than that, a more science fiction, technologically
oriented approach with some fantastic entries:(""A Place Called Earth"",
""Land Of The Lost"",""The Secret City Of Limbo"" and ""Graveyard Of Fools"" come to
 mind most strongly), that advance the geography and weird possibilities that are
to be found on this strange planet. It doesn't seem to be just a repeat of what
 went before in the first season and that in itself is a good thing.
Of the filmed extras on the set, the interviews(from the time of the filming of
""The Fantasy Worlds Of Irwin Allen""), are more expansive and encompassing than
what was seen in that previous documentary. Gary Conway's,Deanna Lund's and
particularlly, Stefen Arngrim's are the most insightful and revealing,
with Arngrim's being especially hysterical at times and his reflections
on what he thought this weird planet and the themes of the show, were supposed
 to be about(for example: a parallel world much like earth, only bigger).Gary
Conway is very earnest and serious about the show, which I think has always been
 evident, and his comments are very much appreciative of the show. One of the best
 things about this set, in my opinion,are the silent home movies on Irwin Allen's
 direction of the filming of ""The Crash"".After a rather flat opening sequence with
 many of Irwin's(unidentified) crew sitting around in Allen's Production room,
things get decidely more interesting and revealing. There is an extended sequence,
of the filming of an ending for ""The Crash"",
that was clipped from the final version of the aired episode,
in which the men are busying themselves trying to repair the ship's
radio,as the rest of the cast
sit nearby. It seems to involve a gag where Chipper
(Barry's dog), has a wad of cash from Fitzhugh's briefcase that was filled with an
ill-gotten million dollars and is trotting around with it in his mouth. There are
scenes of men pouring out fog from machines into the atmospheric forest set and
scenes of various cast members going through dress rehearsals and discussion of
their scenes to be filmed. I really love the way they show the forest set,which looks
 like it is bathed in black-lights and everything that is in color looks like it is
standing out in a sort of day-glo, dream-like manner.....too cool!
Great scenes of the Spindrift there, too. An odd, but funny thing, is the goofy looking
green planet(with a patch on it in the bottom corner),which was fortunately, optically
altered to look like a pulsating, shifting other-dimensional transparent green mist that
the Spindrift passes through in the finished pilot. The final scene on the home movies,
is a bizarre shot of a mock-up of the interior of the cockpit of the Spindrift being
pushed through the fog-filled set by about a half-dozen men(detailed in the rare and
out-of-print 1969 book by John Gregory Dunne, ""The Studio"", where in 19 pages within
 the book, he relates the behind-the-scenes filming of Land Of The Giants pilot
""The Crash"" and other Irwin Allen sroductions, being filmed and in the planning stages.
In the book, this particular scene is related as such:
""The shot was finally ready, and Allen, still drinking orange juice, checked the camera.
A cut-out of the spacecraft's cockpit was canted on a platform that the crew would roll
forward through the giant-sized underbrush, simulating the crash landing. Allen's camera
was placed to the rear of the platform and would photograph the crash over the space
ship's control panel and out of the cockpit window. Allen was in good humor and began
feeling the muscles of the crew members who would push the platform.'Okay fellows',
he said, 'When I say go, shake, rock, roll and return. This is jiffy productions,
instant crashes of ultramodern space ships.'He yelled for some fog and a prop man
laid a coverlet of artificial fog over the set.'Action', Allen shouted.
Shake, Rock, Roll ,Return.'The crew pushed the platform, their muscles straining.
the spacecraft scuttled through the underbrush and the fog.'Cut', Allen said.
he stood with his hands on his hips, a look of displeasure on his face.'Fellows',
he said deliberately, 'it wasn't fast enough. This is a spaceship. It is not a Spad.
You remember the Spad. It's an old World War I airplane. A Spad is not supposed to go
faster than a spaceship. But it just did'.He beamed.'You've got to push, fellows.
you've got to put your hearts into it'The cockpit was rolled back and the greenery
replaced. The old fog was blown away and new fog laid down. The bell rang and the stage
went silent. Allen called for action and the platform moved slowly forward,
the crew straining, the ship gathering speed.'Push', Allen shouted.'Push, put your
heart into it, think of the beer tonight, push, push'.The platform ground to a halt.
Beautiful', Allen said.'Print it. One spaceship crash'.
Another great scene detailed in the book is where Allen is directing Conway and
Lund in the laboratory scene when they are about to be captured by the giants and
scotch-taped to some glass slides to be dissected. The scene where they are up on the
counter-top with the needle and thread, about to
shimmy down the side of the table to make their escape goes like this:
'Let's run through this from the top',Allen shouted down.
Conway and Deanna Lund started across the desk top. It was so large that it took up
nearly a third of the sound stage.'Good,good',Allen said.'Now up on the drawers.
Good. Start knotting the thread. Deanna- now! You hear the giant. Hide,hide,hide.
Beautiful, beautiful. Behind the jar now'.Allen was peering through the camera.
I'm picking up your fanny, Gary. Move in farther. Deanna, I've got your fanny now.
It's lovely, but not for home consumption. Beautiful, we get this in the master,
we're a bunch of geniuses'.
priceless!
Unfortunately, this scene is not in the home movies. How cool would that be, to see
Irwin mouthing the words to all of this and being able to know exactly what was being
said?Also, in the book, there is a part where the casting director has found 'a man
with a pipe and a boy with a toy gun', and they say that they will be 'using them
later'.They are referring to the opening scenes of ""The Weird World"", the next episode
to be filmed. Very fascinating stuff).
Needless to say, the also included 'unseen pilot', has some revealing things in it also
at the beginning and end - scenes that were not used in the final version of the pilot,
including some hysterically funny things with Deanna Lund).Though, the majority of it
is seen in the later(better, tighter)finished version. It is still worth having - and
it looks absolutely flawless! The theme song is completely different, very low-key and
 sort of beatnik-y. The later themes that they used are much more dynamic and exciting,
conveying a magnificent scope of gigantic-ness. The music within each episode of the series is sometimes jazzy,
 many times forlorn and at times,lumbering, moody and somnambulent....which moves things
at a sometimes slow-moving pace, at other times,
with a faster-moving, dynamic, exciting thrust to it,
propelling things forward. The music seems to play a strong part
in the series, enhancing the atmosphere. After not seeing this series
for 17 years and having fond memories of it visually, I finally saw it in 1987 and
was really surprised at how good the show actually was and how well it was written. I was
very surprised by it. Not that every episode is great, because they are not all.
But in what TV show is every single episode great?
To sum things up, all in all, a very worthwhile and lovingly well- produced set. Worth it to
every true fan of the series. I paid $150.00 for it. I know that it is expensive, but I think
Worth it. If you download this show from an on-line source, such as Amazon, you will not get this kind of visual quality, depth and brilliance.
Hopefully in the  near future, Fox will re-release Lost In Space in
a re-mastered, restored format with(thus so far unseen)color home movies from that series pilot,also!
Happy future viewings to all!",1188259200,11,10403,4.867871259175607
2811018,4,B000P5FH2Q,"As a french admirer of Irwin Allen's TV shows (especially ""Time Tunnel""), I was eagerly waiting for the DVD release of ""Land of the Giants"", a show that, oddly enough, was never widely broadcast here.
At first, I suspected that such an expensive and fancy boxed set was a way to overcome the low commercial potential of the show for DVD. ""Lost in Space"", it isn't ! Too bad I get to buy such an expensive product. A usual set should have been enough for me.
But as I finally get it, I revised my opinion. The set is well worth the money you put in it, in every aspect.
First, al the episodes are remastered, with a perfect picture quality obviously from brand new prints.
The series is complete and the bonus are great, althought many of the interview, behind the scene footage and added promo seems to be lifted from the documentary made about Allen's work some years ago, ""the fantastic world of Irwin Allen"". Nethertheless, they are complete ! The long-form pilot is here too.
But everything goes to the boxed set itself. it's a great, fun presentation, a wood box (real wood) with the little people trapped inside ! DVD's and brochures are inside the box, and that include a patch, some postcards and, my favorite irem, a (smaller) reproduction of Gold Key Comics' Land of the Giant issue 1 !
Well, there is some miss up too : the brochure is a transcript of some of the interviews already included in video in the DVD bonus.
But this is only nitpicking. The idea is great, the execution is original and fine in every aspect. I don't feel cheated in any way and I must add that,now, I regret others shows like ""Voyage..."" or ""Tunnel"" didn't get the same over-the-top treatment ! To get a boxed set of Time Tunnel with some small reproduction of the Tunnel itself, or DVD inside the hull of a miniature Seaview... Well, maybe I'm giving ideas to Fox !

By the time I do have the money, I worry that there will be no more copies available. This is also the problem with lesser know sci fi movies and other old TV series from when I was a child.  It is bad enough that current popular series prices for CSI, all the Law & Order versions, etc. are fairly high.  When my disabled, teen son requested a copy of the second season of 7th Heaven, the store wanted over $50!  I am also a single, disabled mom--short on an entertainment budget, so I'm concerned that large price tag items such as these may spoil the market to enthusiastic viewers--not heavy duty collectors.",1187568000,11,766,4.366197183098592
2811021,1,B000P5FH2Q,"Yes, this place is for reviews about the product but with this price nobody is gonna buy it. And then they are going to say no more future releases because of poor sales. With these prices!!!!! Remember what happened to Mary Tyler Moore show......it costed almost 54$ aprox, after poor sales and thousands of fan mails they dropped the price to 24$ and second season came to light.
  So I love this show but I'm not gonna pay almost 200$ for it. Ok, it's a Limited Edition but it's also a robbery!!!!!!",1187568000,9,502,4.445652173913044
2811022,5,B000P5FH2Q,"I pre-ordered this set with some trepidation - after all, the price tag is very steep! I am pleased to say that I am absolutely delighted with it. I hadn't seen ""Land of the Giants"" for many years, so I was relying on a memory that I was afraid was seriously marred by rose-coloured glasses! I've now watched 6 of the episodes, and if anything this series is better that I remembered! Add to this a pristine picture quality, the like of which has probably never been seen in this series, and you are onto a winner. The extras are also great. I haven't watched all of them yet, but I've seen the interviews with the actors (my only quibble here is that Heather Young is missing from the line-up) & the original network presentation. They are really terrific. If I'm going to be picky it would have been nice to have included a retrospective documentary bringing many of the extra features together, but this was not to be. Also, all of Irwin Allen's work is discussed in some detail in the wonderful ""Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen"" disc, a good point of reference for this and other Allen series.

The thing which I am most impressed with is the presentation of the whole package. The ""cage"" which the dvds, comic book, etc. are in is beautifully done - it's like having your own cage of little people (albeit 2-dimensional ones)!

In summing up I would say that this set is definitely for die-hard fans, but for such people the expensive price is well worth the money!",1186358400,9,1468,4.49438202247191
2811023,5,B000P5FH2Q,"this is a classic, a must have for collectors, once upon a time, billions of years ago during the caveman age, you could only get this on ebay for cheaper. but still i am glad they release it. when this generation is gone, no one will buy it. so they better hurry up and put the classics out. and remaster them also, this save the movies, tv series for generations to come. they already lost the avengers 1st season forever, i think that was 1962, the little racasls, only 40 possible availible out of 200. NOW, my dream before i past away, is to see a RE-MAKE of land of thr giants tv series, with tons of jaw dropping special effects, incredible dts surround sound, cliff hangers to make you run home, i mean run like hell to see the next episodes, witty humor, and what was missing, i think,  was that since they are on another planet, they should more strange creatures, advance weapons, time travel, moving from one spot to another in their ship, a 2 parter, where they find another ship like them lost-(a rescuse military battle ship), in an utimate battle, some will die, aome will live on, a new crew is formed.  how about an attempted to get back home with a device on broad that goes wrong, and they get smaller and finds the incredible shrinking man, who now becomes a cast member, they try again, but this time ends up in a human body like fantastic voyage, which now they must fix the device to return to normal size before the alien antibodys and nano's destroy them. oh there is so much more. well at best, i hope at least to see a motion picture of land of the giants before i past away. happy viewing. :)",1185926400,2,1621,4.328947368421052
2811024,5,B000P5FH2Q,"Well, my set finally arrived in the mail last weekend and I can only
say that I am totally thrilled with this fantastic limited edition
set
of LOTG!
Before receiving it, I admit that I feared that I had paid too steep
a
price for this set, but the extras such as the LOTG-themed wooden
cage for
the DVD case, the reprinted Gold Key LOTG comic, the star interviews
(how
come Deanna Lund looks even BETTER 40 years later???), the IA home
movies, the flight 612 airline patch, etc. all make this a set well
worth getting for any serious LOTG fan.
If I were the film editor who compiled this set, about the only thing
that I would've done differently would've been to get a voice-over
narration
during the IA home movies, perhaps introducing the writers who were
sitting around the conference table.
Even though these are 2-sided DVD's, the visual and audio quality of
these episodes are crisp and comparable to broadcast quality!
I will finally be conveniently able to view all of these episodes in
the original production order, instead of the initial US broadcast
order.  In this way, I'll be able to see how the characters of
Valerie
and Fitzhugh slowly but surely develop during their stay on the un-
named Giant planet, such as when she transforms from spoiled
troublemaker to team-player and when he quits carrying around his
million dollar briefcase and becomes a team-player as well.
I have no regrets in getting this set, and I'm certain none of you
will, either.",1185753600,5,1469,4.671814671814672
2811025,5,B000P5FH2Q,"As a die-hard fan of LAND OF THE GIANTS, I'm not going to complain about the price of this set because I'm just glad it's finally out and looking better than ever, transferred from sharp, 35mm prints with beautiful color saturation. In addition to the pristine looking episodes, the extras include cast interviews, a network sales pitch, behind the scenes footage, publicity photos, photo cards, a comic book repro, mini booklet, spaceship key chain, and a crew patch. To top it off, everything comes housed in a cool box cage that captures the spirit of the show. I can ony give this DVD set the highest recommendation to all serious GIANTS devotees.

For those unfamiliar with the show, here's the lowdown:

A sub-orbital spaceflight en-route from Los Angeles to London passes through a dimensional space warp and crash lands on a planet inhabited by giants. The crew and passengers must work together if they hope to survive, repair their spaceship, and someday return to Earth. In the process they learn that the giants have a totalitarian form of government in which the Earthlings are sought out as enemy aliens whose advanced technology poses a threat to the giants.

LAND OF THE GIANTS is a classic that holds up extremely well today. Among the popular Irwin Allen T.V. shows of the 60's - VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, LOST IN SPACE, and THE TIME TUNNEL - GIANTS was the most ambitious and stands out as the best of the lot. It was the most expensive series up to that time, employing production values and special effects usually reserved for feature films. The high cost was the reason it was cancelled after its initial 1968-70 run, but the show remained popular in syndication over the years and has gained new generations of fans. It all speaks for the high quality of GIANTS.

The attractive cast performs engagingly; each actor approaches his/her role with a sincere earnestness that makes them easily likable. There is also a lot more ad-libbing than in Allen's other shows, which makes the dialog delivery feel natural and spontaneous. The characters contain an adequate measure of depth that is in keeping within the framework of what is essentially an action based show. Throughout the various episodes, each cast member is given their chance to dominate the plot.

Obviously in a science fiction show, the special effects play a prominent role and LAND OF THE GIANTS provided an elaborate showcase for them. GIANTS is a veritable visual feast with lush, Technicolor photography and expertly constructed props that are twelve times larger than normal. The extreme low angle shots of the giants required that the sets have ceilings built into them, something other shows didn't have to bother with. On the other hand, the extreme high angle shots of the ""little people"" needed a very wide soundstage that was often an artificial, oversized forest or the bottom portion of an office room furnished with enormous props. To further simulate gigantic proportions, various in-camera techniques were utilized such as large and miniature rear projection, split screen photography, travelling mattes, and forced perspective. Even in our CGI era the expertise of 20th Century Fox's special effects department still impresses, especially since such high standards had to be maintained on a weekly basis.

Music was always a major contributing factor to the quality of Irwin Allen's T.V. shows, and the score for GIANTS is exemplary. Full bodied and vibrant, the music matches the impact of the visuals and heightens the feeling of suspense and impending danger. The powerful brass section gives the show a genuine, giant-like atmosphere. This comes off particularly well in the opening title theme for the first season and in the pilot episode, THE CRASH.

Something else that greatly works to LAND OF THE GIANTS' advantage is that it sticks to its basic premise and doesn't try to copy STAR TREK. It also never resorts to silliness like LOST IN SPACE often does. GIANTS is a bit darker in tone with a distinctly paranoid feel. There's also a certain eerieness, particularly in some of the first season episodes where the giants move lethargically and scarcely talk. Whenever the show addresses an ""issue"" it is never in an overt or pretentious way. Science fiction themes that deal with time travel or cloning are always handled intelligently. Mostly though, the episodes are about the difficulties and dangers one would encounter in a hostile world of giants. This served the show well, giving it a universal appeal that hasn't dated. Indeed, LAND OF THE GIANTS is a cult favorite in several European countries with a substantial fanbase in England.

As a six year old, I was lucky enough to see it when it made its debut in 1968 and I was immediately captivated and enthralled by it. It had aspects that were familiar as I've seen and loved Irwin Allen's other shows, but there was also something excitingly fresh and different - it was a show that just looked, sounded, and felt BIG. I have to say that after all these years none of that has diminished, and now with DVD, LAND OF THE GIANTS is still a terrifically fun place to visit over and over again.",1185753600,5,5170,4.900571428571428
2811026,5,B000P5FH2Q,"The price is steep, but if you are a LAND OF THE GIANTS fan, you will agree it is worth it.  I picked it up at Best Buy for $169.99 like others have done.  I have viewed the entire collection.  The editing on the commercial breaks of ""The Weird World"" was unsettling, but overall this collection has beautiful picture and sound quality.  I also wish that double sided discs were not used.  I noticed the first season theme on the first three second season episodes also, as well as ""Giants And All That Jazz.""  I wonder if they were originally broadcast that way, or if this was just a poor job of last minute editing when putting the collection together.  Either way, it is great fun watching the series in this DVD format.",1185753600,4,724,4.398496240601504

2811029,5,B000P5FH2Q,"Yes, I would tend to agree that a SRP of 229.95 is a bit high, yet I have seen this series sell for as much as 525.00 on VHS. I myself am so glad that I recorded the series years ago, as the price on this set is out of my reach. As far as the show itself: The quality and originality as well as the sets and effects are indeed well done. As a person of middle age, I appreciate the series very much indeed because I grew up watching Irwin Allen shows. One can not rate this product on price alone until a more condensed DVD set is released. Amazon`s price of 170.00 is a value if you are a fan of the show. I am sure that there will be a different set released soon as to cater to the majority of the public. Blockbuster has this set for rent at a fraction of what it costs to own. Perhaps some of you negative reviewers should view the discs before rating them.",1185494400,5,862,3.9314285714285715
2811030,5,B000P5FH2Q,"Picked up the LAND OF THE GIANTS collector's set at Best Buy on Tuesday. It was kind of steep, about $170 on sale, but I had birthday gift certificates so I guess somebody figures I'm worth it. The box is really cool, constructed of sturdy wood with a rope handle top and wire mesh door over a 3-D picture of the little people (looks like tin). The wire-mesh door slides up to reveal the contents: 5 DVD cases which fit nicely in slots cut in the wood, and the extras - A little packet containing a Spindrift keychain and LOTG crew patch, postcards with a weathered look (Deanna Lund's is a knockout), a little colector's book, a really cool miniature comic book, and a coupon for $ off on other Irwin Allen DVDs.
Yeah, it's pricey and the discs are double-sided as countless people have pointed out. But I'm not getting any younger and could get run over by a bus tomorrow, so I will enjoy watching my favorite show of all time for the remainder of my years.
In addition to the cast interviews, one of the extra features is the unaired pilot of ""The Crash"". It looked great to me, the colors are crisp and clear, bold and bright. You could see the beads of sweat on the Captain's and Co-Pilot's faces, and the 2 women never looked more beautiful. The differences I noticed in the unaired pilot were the music and some extra scenes. They used a lot of LOST IN SPACE music (I thought the GIANTS music/theme song featured in the aired pilot and series was better), and there was a lot of extra footage before the actual crash of the Spindrift. I guess these scenes were cut or shortened to get to the crash and the action quicker.
This is an outstanding set and collector's item. I only hope the same will be done for LOST IN SPACE someday, during my lifetime.",1185408000,31,1758,4.379204892966361
2811031,4,B000P5FH2Q,"I'm reading the reviews about people complaining about the price and I won't dissagree that it is too high. However the package is stamped as a limited edition which means that the series might be re-issued in individual packages like the other Irwin Allen shows after a while, but who knows. My guess is that a good part of the price is simply the packaging. The extra's are not a big deal, but this is the stuff you get with limited editions, so if you think it's to high you may want to wait it out and one of two things can happen. Either they re-issue it later at a lower price or not at all. It's anyone's guess.

I've checked some of the discs and I own the original Columbia House DVD's as well, and these look better than what Columbia released. The picture quality is excellent! That said there is a problem that another reviewer mentioned, and that is the first 3 episodes of the second season have the wrong theme music on them. 'The Mechanical Man' 'Six Hours to Live' and 'The Inside Rail' all have 2nd season intro's with the 1st season music. These episodes are available on the Columbia House versions and the intro's on those discs are correct.

Except for that, I've found that these discs play well and look good, but I've still to see the entire run. Except for the price, this is not a bad set and if you can get it cheap I recommend it.

Note: Land of the Giants is best enjoyed in production order rather than broadcast order. These discs as well as others always list the shows in broadcast order and often the network that originally aired the show (abc) screwed up the order terribly. I'm a long time Irwin Allen fan and I know he is not the best at character development or continuity, but what little there is is lost when the episodes are run out of order.

Try this: The first 5 episodes should run like this - 'The Crash' 'The Weird-World' 'The Trip' 'The Bounty Hunter' and 'The Golden Cage.' The character of Mark especially changes gradually and you see them slowly adapting to there new surroundings. Because the series was originally aired out of order the second episode 'Ghost Town' is way out of place. It is actually the 14th episode!

If you are a die hard fan this doesn't matter, but if you only marginally like the show try watching it in production order. It will make a difference!",1185408000,128,2328,4.429906542056075
2811032,5,B000P5FH2Q,"As like many Giant fans when this set was announced we all had July 24, 2007 circled on our calendars.  I bought this set today (came to over $180 with tax)  I probably would have paid anything to have this series complete and on dvd quality.

The Pros:  The episodes are clear. Its like watching the series over again picking up the finest details.  The Unaired Pilot which alot of us obtained from conventions with a horrible picture is here in all its glory.  The actual box set is cool as its a wooden cage.

The Cons:  The extras are not as good as I hoped. All of the cast interviews are extended ones done during 1995's The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen.  The Irwin Allen Home movies are good but aren't that long and are mostly of The Crash.  The picture galleries are nothing that hasn't been seen before.  Not toally bad but not as I had hoped.

Overall I am glad to finally have this on dvd -- even though I do have all 10 Columbia House discs--but they stopped making them after 32 episodes.

Fox does not even put out their product in a proper way they make the discs with material on both sides which is the cheap way to do it as when you lift the discs they end up getting finger prints and scratches on them all of which deteriorate the products future use. Studios like image do things the right way they produce the product on one side with label on the other,fOX ON THE OTHER HAND uses the cheap way to produce discs and ends up charging a fortune. This has nothing to do with Amazon which i love,but I,m asking everyone out there even though you like the series as I do DONT BUY this set,hopefully when 20th century fox sees its not selling they will do what they should have done in the first place by selling it in season sets at like 24.00 to 29.00.

I decided to pass on pre-ordering at the time, then, two days ago, I thought, well, lets go ahead and bite the bullet.  Imagine my surprise then when, on logging in, I now see the price has been ratcheted up yet another $30.  Comprehend that a minute:  for a full season of a comedy like, say, Frazier, All in the Family, or Mary Tyler Moore, you would spend as much as the price of LOTG WENT UP in just a few short weeks.  This is corporate greed at its absolute worst.  Fox clearly is NOT trying to mass-market this product.  Rather, they feel they have a captive audience, namely, the few buyers out there who constitute the show's cult following.

2811068,5,B000P5FH2Q,"I am violating a reviewer's rule, writing about what I have not read or seen. I have reviewed over a hundred projects on Amazon and am a regular book reviewer for our local paper so I am aware that the reader (or in this case the viewer) should really have seen the book or DVD set from beginning to end before making a judgement. Therefore I feel guilty about making a commentary so early in the game.

However, the three star rating listed with this product on Amazon may seem to some like an indictment of the show.  Not the price.  I have seen all the episodes many times and love the show.  One who has not seen the show could be turned off once they see that three star rating and not bother with reading the reasons for the rating.

Most reviewers have so far dealt with the price, which is high I agree.  That didn't prevent me from ordering it as I considered it a great series, better than any of the others by Irwin and one of the best all time shows on television.  Sadly none of the original cast gets a dime for this.  I don't want to take a chance on Fox pulling the product due to criticism and selling only what they have on hand.

While the price is high, I also know there are collectors who will pay any price for something they really want.  I recently returned from AdventureCon, a large toy and comic show in Tennessee.  I saw collector cards going for three and four hundred dollars each from various TV shows.  People  were buying them.  I also feel lucky I found my Giants lunch box for fifteen dollars in a flea market as I have seen them priced for $200.00 to $400.00. And they do sell at that price.  I confess I have too often paid more for things than I should.

I am puzzled by the price on the Giants set just as so many of you are.  I just paid much less for the first two seasons of Veronica Mars with extras.  Many of you have bought whole season sets for less I know.  I have complete sets of several shows, Sliders, Smallville, Wonder Woman, Home Improvement etc..  Land of the Giants is the one I have wanted most.  So I had to budget my fan buying for this set, it will be worth it to me.

The reason I sound off like this is because the star system runs one to five and there is no indication whether that rating is for the product, the show or the price.  LOTG has only three and to the new buyer on Amazon this could imply the quality of the show.  I gave it five stars because of the series and what it meant to me.",1181692800,25,2459,4.117647058823529

2811070,2,B000P5FH2Q,"Maybe $179 a pop for Land of the Giants on DVD is to help pay for someone's drug habit at Fox - that's the only reason that make sense as to why they would charge so d*mn much!  The first season was the best one...and it went down hill from there!  I have all seasons of Lost in Space, which was way better than Land of the Giants, and I'm pretty frickin' sure I didn't pay $180 for them!  C'mon, man....",1181260800,10,404,3.962962962962963
2811071,1,B000P5FH2Q,I was just about to pre-order this for $149.00 which I thought was a fair price but now still 5 full weeks before release and Amazon increases it to $179.00?  I can go anyway and get it get it for that price.  Why bother with pre-ordering.,1181260800,13,239,4.173913043478261
