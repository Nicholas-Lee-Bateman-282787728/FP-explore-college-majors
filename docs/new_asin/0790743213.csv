111909,5,0790743213,"Supposedly, Cary Grant, aged 54, was contemplating retirement until Alfred Hitchcock asked a fourth role of him. Thank goodness he went for it! As good as Psycho is, it should never have eclipsed North By Northwest as  Hitchcocks most famous film. This is his masterwork, (in my opinion one of  the top three best films EVER), and for innumerable reasons the end result  is just an astonishing accomplishment. Justifiably famous for those two  scenes, (and the cropduster sequence is totally thrilling, though I always  wondered why the pilot decided to go kamikaze and plough into the petrol  tanker!), it has so much more to recommend it. Grant, present in virtually  every scene, is superb, and the Academy should forever hang their heads in  shame for ignoring this actor. He is matched, however, by Jessie Royce  Landis,(funny already in as much that she was also 54 yet plays his  mother!), who is utterly hilarious in her role. Everyone infact is good  form, and its a pity that James Mason, in his only Hitchcock performance,  is offscreen for an eternity after an impressive initial scene opposite  Grant. Alfred Hitchcock simply couldn't have paced this film better, and  what a wild ride it is, though if forced to pick a favourite moment it  would probably be in the auction room. I can never forget the lady turning  to call Grant a ""genuine idiot"" and him thanking her for it! This  is simply scintilating entertainment of the very highest order, I defy any  reasonably minded person to weary of it, because the second you see the  M.G.M. lion in green, and hear Bernard Herrmans brilliant score, you know  your in for one of the biggest treats of your life! Yes it really is THAT  good, even after a dozen viewings. If you don't own this, you cant be a  serious film fan. PERFECT!",929232000,11,1795,4.741100323624596
111910,5,0790743213,One of my favorite Hitchcock/Cary Grant films.  Eve Marie Saint (who was on the 2018 Oscar's last night) was also outstanding.

All his movies are great, he was a ground breaker for young directors to learn from, and I am not a professional in movies making or critic, just like his suspense ! He has made some timeless movies without the excessive BLOOD and SKIN of today, which goes to show you that Talent and good content can make a movie not cheap thrills from seeing someones body.",1514246400,2,534,4.297029702970297

111925,3,0790743213,"It was a decent movie for its time. I didn't see it when it was released. Actually the only reason I purchased and watched it was the appearance of the New York-to-Chicago train, ""20th Century Limited"". As a model railroader and frequent passenger of New York Central trains back in the 1950's, I try to get every glimpse I can of that marvelous luxury passenger train.",1513468800,,369,4.606060606060606

I have watched this movie at least a minimum of 30 times, over a 50 year span. And not once has it ever showed signs of aging that is if you don't include the 55+ year old cars. Cary Grant, James Mason, Eva Marie Saint., and Leo G Carroll are simply on top of their game as is Hitchcock in this thriller based on a case of mistaken identity. This movie is in almost everyone's top 100 list worldwide. Find one with the bonus features if you can it's the best.",1507507200,,570,4.1441441441441444

111950,5,0790743213,"Although the film is from a by-gone age, it is still great today. Many consider it Hitchcocks greatest film and are convinced that he and Cary Grant should have gotten an Academy Award for their work. Others, rightly so, say that this is the epitome of a chase film, and there is none better.
What is also striking about the film is that virtually everything about it is not clear. The film is filled with ambiguities and obscurities. But rather than diminishing the value and excitement and suspense in the film, it adds to our enjoyment of the film. It is much like the biblical tales in this respect. The Bible also is filled with ambiguities and obscurities. We do not know why people and God do what they do and what they are thinking. We enjoy the tales and make up our own mind, using our own imagination, to fill in the empty spaces.
For example: We do not know what precisely the criminal James mason does wrong. We are told that he is engaged in buying and selling secrets, but not what secrets. It is unclear exactly why the criminals want to kidnap Cary Grant. Why play cat and mouse with him, why not simply kill him? It is strange why the criminals try to kill him using an airplane when they could have done so simply. Why do the criminals go to Mount Rushmore?",1503273600,2,1276,4.3881856540084385

Yet the well-paced action, dialogue, and overall look of the film is completely betrayed by the ending, which I found to be out of joint with the rest of the movie.

112078,2,0790743213,"While I enjoyed the visuals in the movie purely for escapist reasons and also watching the coolness of the late 1950's (looks a lot like the 1960's to me) I kept thinking, ""How plausible is this really?"" and if one is constantly thinking that despite a desire to have fun watching, that's not a good thing.

Basically, my problem is, ""Why is everyone behaving that way?""  I just can't picture many things that happen in the movie... and I know one shouldn't take scene by scene apart, but yes the movie comes apart easily upon examination of one thing after the other.  For example, the bad guys going after Thornhill at first instance just on the basis of a very flimsy move--just standing up really at the wrong time. You'd think experienced spies would look for far more clues, like following him home, checking his statistics in official records, etc. I know there was a paging at the time, but still.... I think in real life, the bad guys would have let him go after just a few minutes after realizing they were acting incredulously.

Secondly, there was no reason for the femme fatale Kendall to be so friendly to Thornhill... okay, maybe she's attracted to him regardless, but a lot of the time she helps him and at other times she totally forgets him, even sends him to certain death (by the crop duster plane).  What? There wasn't consistency. It was hard to believe she worried about him at all, and at the end she loves him?  Please.

Thirdly, it was so complicated for the bad guys to send Thornhill in the middle of barren countryside. Huh? Just gun him down in a dark alley, why go to such trouble. It seemed the entire movie was written just for visual effects, not on the basis of reality. Yeah, yeah, I know movies aren't reality, but still, this was so unbelievable that it left a hollow feeling inside me, wondering why it couldn't at least make sense. Another problem with sending Thornhill so far out in the middle of nowhere... the female agent Kendall tells him to go, right? Obviously the bad guys want him to go there to meet his end (complicated way of doing it, but anyway...).  But at the same time, (spoiler, but it's been decades since this movie was out) she's a double agent, so why would under her ""government agent role"" she send him to his doom? She would at least pretend to fumble the instructions, but no, she cruelly and callously sends him to certain death (does anyone really think he would have escaped if this wasn't a movie?).  And why wouldn't the government, if it wants to keep Thornhill alive, know of (through Kendall) or instruct Kendall to not send Thornhill to a fight he can't win?  Baffling.

Fourthly, I know security was far less in the ol' days, but Thornhill could go inside a United Nations building and meet a diplomat there, and the diplomat says yes right away instead of channeling through staff? Surely in the history of diplomacy in hundreds of years were far more professional and sensible than that.  And the diplomats would stick around in waiting rooms where there's a crowd and anyone could have emerged from the gritty streets? They work in offices, and they're very busy, usually with weeks booked in advance.

Fifthly, why did Thornhill keep going and seek the answer to all this?  I know without Thornhill, the movie would have ended right there, but he doesn't have any personal stake in the outcome (true, he becomes attached to the safety of the female Kendall near the end, but that comes in pretty late in the movie) so I felt as if he was detached from what was really at stake in the movie.  He doesn't passionately believe in saving America from secrets, nor is anyone in his family threatened, nor is he seeking fortune, so what was his motivation for hanging in so long at great danger? With him going through so many situations, with so much danger already happening in different ways, I couldn't understand why he kept going. All he had to do was hide out and stay with family or something. Yeah I know, it's a movie, so he has to keep going.  That's the plot problem of using a main character as disinterested bystander who still discovers no personal stake as the movie drags on (as opposed to other movies where the unwitting hero starts to learn about and feel strongly about an injustice against a person or a group, or finds out secrets that could lead to personal fortune, or avenges someone close to him).

Okay, so the scenes in the barren farmland and at Mount Rushmore, (Really? You can own a property on top of Mount Rushmore, just a ten minute run away from the famous faces!) okay, they don't make sense, but I think people like the movie because of these two scenes, without them, I think this movie would not be as famous today.  I agree these scenes are exciting and original, and fresh to watch, but I have to cast aside disbelief to enjoy these (and I do enjoy).  The problem is I can't cast aside my disbelief for the other scenes of the movie, about 90% of it in fact.

Well, there's more, and I could go on and on, but those are the things at the top of my head. And why in some scenes do the bad guys hold back (crowds sometimes stop them, sometimes the crowds still don't stop the bad guys from extracting Thornhill away) and in other scenes do the bad guys act foolishly in eagerness.  Very selective motives if you ask me. To please the writers.

The movie was written for its visual effects and to make the story continue no matter what to make sure it was slightly over two hours.  That's all I think it was.  Excellent visuals at times (and the 1960's colour and ""cool"" styles and historical reference) and thrilling showcases of famous landmarks that aren't overused in other movies, though.",1472774400,,5707,4.529182879377432

Expect no less, and this outing with James Mason (perennial favorite since first seeing his 'Nemo' in 20,000 Leagues ... and why isn't JJAbrams or Christopher Nolan doing a remake of that - without the pointlessly corny Kirk Douglas character, of course?) scores well.

112130,2,0790743213,"Hitchcock is a master no doubt and his visual skills shine in this film as in his others but don't waste any time on this plot because the improbabilities are too numerous to overlook. I think people are too swept away by Hitchcock's reputation to look at this film critically. I'm a screenwriter and I watched it with an eye to the writing because I heard about the great auction scene. There are a few creative twists in this thriller but there are also some horrible gaffes.

(Spoiler alert) Why doesn't Cary Grant's character pick up the phone in the room he's been kidnapped to and call the police? Would he have a jokey relationship with his mother in the face of a kidnapping? Would a woman who is not a hooker basically ask to sleep with a stranger in 1959? Were these people passionately in love? (I didn't buy it.) Would the FBI lock a guy in a room and leave the window open? Would bad guys live in a house on top of Mt. Rushmore? The silliness just goes on and on.

If you have to watch this for a class, I hope you can watch it with a critical eye and not drink the Hitchcock kool-aid or at least think of it as a period piece from a much simpler, more naive time. I can't believe this script was nominated for an Academy Award. I hope that means screenwriting in general has improved exponentially since then. If you're looking for a great Hitchcock film, try Rear Window or Vertigo.",1464566400,,1397,4.32824427480916

(spoiler alert) It begins as Grant is kidnapped by ""bad guys"" who inexplicably believe he is an agent yet this man has never been seen and no explanation was given as to how attention was drawn to him in the first place. Said bad guys forcibly get Grant drunk and what follows is a horrific sequence of comedic and stereotypical drunken silliness culminating with a call to his mother for rescue at the police station.  The scenes to follow were completely irritating as Grant drags his mother along in his quest to find his captors while she hurls comedic insults at him.  How can anyone be expected to take the suspense of this movie seriously when it starts off in such a quirky way?  It sinks to even lower levels as a supposed undercover agent engages in a one night stand and falls weak from Grant's charming ways.  Hitchcock's pairing of a couple once again with a father-daughter age gap shows strong sexist undertones.

112175,5,0790743213,"- That observant dude waiting for the bus: ""That's funny. That plane's dusting crops where there ain't no crops.""

The studio wanted to crop the movie shorter but old Hitch wouldn't have it, and since his contract allowed him full creative control, Hitch got his way. North by Northwest runs at a briskly paced 136 minutes, and every moment in it well worth the watch.

Here's a wee list: The 39 Steps, The Girl Was Young, Saboteur, To Catch a Thief, Stage Fright, Frenzy, North by Northwest. Point being, you have to be in tip top physical shape to be the male lead in a Hitchcock movie. One of Hitch's most favorite choices for a plot point is the man wrongly accused and on the run. It's inarguable that the most iconic scene of many in North by Northwest is Cary Grant's being harried by that bullet-spewing crop duster. Good old Archie Leach, former acrobat and pantomime, then 55 years old or thereabouts, was in tip top shape.

He plays Roger O. Thornhill, Madison Avenue ad executive who, by calling that bell boy at the worst possible moment, gets mistaken for an elusive master spy. In short order, Thornhill is abducted, force-guzzled with booze, and implicated in a horrid murder at the United Nations.

North by Northwest happens to be the most exhilarating of Grant's four collaborations with Hitchcock. It's a masterclass in constructing plot. Hitch squeezes his audience with pressures brought about by an acute ramping of suspense and by immaculate staging. There is giddy anticipation. In North by Northwest can be found the gestation of the elements that made up Hitch's brilliant craftsmanship and that made his motion pictures still very much ""the measuring stick for chase thrillers."" Present is the urbane humor that sometimes wanders into macabre - yet still playful - territory. And the deft character work. As is the glamorous blonde of shaky allegiance and the repressed sexual tension her presence generates. And as mentioned, the fugitive on the run, but, also, the fugitive compelled to create a stir in a public venue so as to evade capture. The auction hall sequence in which Thornhill undermines the auctineer is massively entertaining. And, of course, Bernard Herrmann's riveting jittery score.

It's a spectacular roster of actors, fronted by possibly the greatest movie star in history. Cary Grant, incomparable reactor, brings a genuine sense of bafflement and a dawning horror as Thornhill only ever gets deeper in his nightmarish predicament. He and Eva Marie Saint - her character accused by Thornhill as someone who ""uses sex like a flyswatter"" -strike a combustible chemistry. You could practically observe the heat they generate in their shared scenes, and old Hitch must've wallowed in all the erotic innuendos he got away with.

It's a sprawling narrative - and a flattering travelogue - that locomotes from New York to Chicago to South Dakota. Come to think of it, it is also a spectacular train thriller. Along the way, stops are warranted for a series of crescendo moments: a drunken Thornhill almost careening off the cliff; the murderous crop duster scene that runs an indulgent seven minutes and is absent of dialogue and shot in broad daylight and in wide open spaces, these the antithesis of how a suspenseful sequence is traditionally shot; the aforementioned auction scene; Eve Kendall's finding out that the jig is up; and, of course, the pursuit across Mt. Rushmore. Whew!

The movie underwent several incarnations in terms of its title. Before latching onto North by Northwest, it was, at times, during script development, referred to as Breathless, The Man in Lincoln's Nose, and In a Northwesterly Direction. Hitch supposedly was keen on having Grant enact a sneezing attack inside Lincoln's nostril. Except the Dept. of Interior - they run the monument - not only denied permission for Hitch to shoot on the actual location, they wouldn't even allow Grant and company to scrabble over a reproduced model. Instead, the actors had to navigate their way between and along the edges of the mammoth faces.

Did you know that Jessie Royce, who plays Thornhill's disbelieving mother, was in the neighborhood of Cary Grant's age?

There's a McGuffin, naturally, some nonsense about hidden microfilm. It's super-cheeky of Hitch to not even bother to explain what's on it. It's what the villains have, it's what the FBI wants, it's what the hero must get his mitts on. More detail would be superfluous. And that's the thing about Hitchcock, isn't it? He's all about the grandiose scale and the big, showy moments, but not so much with the tedious detail.",1455667200,2,4605,4.977893368010403

112196,5,0790743213,"BOTTOM LINE: This terrific film is Alfred Hitchcock at the absolute pinnacle of his game. And that's saying something! The plot is full of inspiring twists & turns, the action & adventure are over the top, and the film never lets up until the final fade-out. If you've never seen a Hitchcock film before, this is a great one to get your feet wet with. 5 STAR film, 4 STAR Blu-ray.

THE STORY: An unassuming advertising executive is mistaken for an undercover government operative by some very unsavory characters. In less than 24 hours his entire, comfortably predictable routine world is completely destroyed and he himself is in mortal danger. It will take all of his fast-thinking ""baffle them with BS"" advertising skills, some stealthy assistance from mysterious double agent, and more than a little luck... if he hopes to stay a step ahead of the ruthless criminals intent on rubbing him out.

THOUGHTS (contains minor spoilers): One of my favorite Hitchcock films. Everyone is perfectly cast. Super suave acting legend Cary Grant was never better than here, as delightfully dapper (and rather daft) New York ad exec Roger Thornhill. Eva-Maire Saint is terrific, smart and smoldering; one of the sexiest women to ever cross paths with Grant. Their chemistry is terrific. Leo G. Carroll is wonderful as the crafty government head honcho who seems indifferent to whether or not the innocent Thornhill will survive the nightmarish web into which he's become accidentally entangled. Of course any hero is only as good as his nemesis. Here, the classy, always unflappable James Mason is in top form as the sophisticated traitor who has secrets to sell. A young Martin Landau is disturbingly evil as one of Mason's high-strung, coldly-cunning henchmen. The film takes us from one great set-up to another - including the deservedly legendary crop duster sequence - all culminating in a breathless chase across the presidential faces on Mount Rushmore. It's equal parts tension & fun. A thoroughly entertaining motion picture experience; a masterpiece that is equal parts style & suspense, by one of the medium's true all-time masters. NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a genuine classic that belongs in every movie fan's collection, no doubt about it.

THE BLU-RAY: Sadly, I was not as impressed by the remastered Blu-ray as I had hoped to be.  Don't misunderstand me. The remaster is a fine one, but NORTH BY NORTHWEST doesn't look anywhere near as amazing as the recent remaster of Hitchcock's THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY. That film looks absolutely astonishing. NBNW looks good, but not great. There are several excellent bonus features included, which increases the collectability if you're a film buff. Even if you're not, the upgraded picture and improved sound are worth a double-dip if you already own the film in DVD format.",1449360000,12,2814,5.04516129032258

112230,5,0790743213,"While not quite Hitchcock's best, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is nevertheless one of his most thrilling, and funny, motion pictures. It stars Cary Grant as an ad executive who gets mistaken for a government agent and has to go on the run in order to survive. Sound familiar? That's because the plot is kind of similar to Hitchcock's own SABOTEUR and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (although you can be certain that Cary Grant's character didn't; the bad guys just think he does). This simple premise provided for a myriad of exciting set-pieces that exemplify the kind of suspense-building and thrills that Hitch's audience were most certainly used to by this point in his career. Cary Grant is quite a good replacement for the everyman character that James Stewart played so well, and Eva Marie Saint plays a nice twist on the femme fatale as this film's Hitchcock blonde. Still, what struck me so much was how funny this film was. At certain points, it was like watching a comedy of errors combined with a spy thriller. There was also a lot more obvious sexual innuendo than in any Hitchcock picture I've seen before. Signs of the changing times, maybe? Moving on, even though it wasn't as tightly written as some of Hitchcock's other films, being essentially a bunch of action set-pieces strung together, it was still rather inventive and the momentum was kept going at a pretty good pace throughout. In particular, the crop-dusting scene and the climactic sequence on Mount Rushmore stand out from the rest, as I'm sure they do to many others who've seen the film. However, what made this not quite as perfect as could have been has a lot do with Hitchcock's tendency to do a lot of shooting on sound stages. As a result, a car chase that takes place early on (with a drunk Cary Grant) was less thrilling and believable than it could have been, and Bernard Herrmann's score had to compensate (a little too much, perhaps). And, the villains this time around weren't as memorable, mostly because we don't really see them do anything villainous. Still, James Mason was a pleasure to watch, and we get to see Martin Landau play a heavy. Overall, I do think this is better than the previous Hitchcock films I mentioned, if for no other reason than that there's more of what worked in those films. Still, at 136 minutes, it is a little too long and, like many other of Hitchcock's movies I've seen, the ending was too abrupt and a little bit of a cheat. So, while its reach does somewhat exceed its grasp in terms of the action, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is still a suitably thrilling action/adventure that ranks among the most entertaining that Hitchcock ever made.",1439683200,2,2643,4.67381974248927

112251,5,0790743213,"A Hitchcock, masterpiece, North by Northwest featured at the Nova, a Melbourne Art House cinema over the weekend; testimony to its timeless quality. I didn't need to venture out on a typical cold and wet winters day; instead, I pulled out my DVD to re-watch the film again. With skill and style, Alfred Hitchcock fuses disparate themes: thriller, noir, comedy and romance to deliver a classy and compelling story. North by Northwest is dramatic and exciting in its exploration of theme; the most prominent being the mutability of identity. As Hitchcock zeros in on the ambivalent hero whose character is indeterminate, in true noir style, his spins a story of mystery and suspense that keeps the viewer on edge until its famous climax.
To those reviewers here who have suggested that the plot lacks credibility it would be wise to check on what is important about Hitchcocks work. His tongue-in-cheek plotting is part of the fun and he enjoys cutting the ground from beneath us, and from beneath his characters. As another reviewer has remarked, a crop duster is not the best way to eliminate an enemy. But the scene has become iconic for its outrageous imaginativeness. Look at it again, especially the moments leading up to the attack  isolation, vulnerability, loneliness, confusion; Hitchcock is so economic and yet so profound. To criticise the plot shape of this marvellous film is like saying that Romeo and Juliet is ruined by all those far-fetched coincidences. Like Shakespeares play, this is Art.",1436140800,3,1507,5.028

Alfred Hitchcock offers a spy thriller type of film sandwiched between Vertigo from 1958 and Psycho from 1960. This movie is definitely a change of pace from his earlier works. The cast of this movie is a who's who of actors (Cary Grant and James Mason), and also includes the up and coming Eva Marie Saint, who's sleek and seductive in her role, and her acting is near perfect. The great Hitch films always seem to have the unforgettable lady, whether it's Kim Novak, Janet Leigh or whoever, and this one is no exception. North by Northwest has it all- suspense, drama, action, etc. The special features are very good too, and features a segment with Saint describing her time in making the film.

112267,5,0790743213,"It had been fifty years, and in celebration of the event, Warner Bros. presented ""North by Northwest"" in a restored and remastered 50th Anniversary, high-definition Blu-ray Book Edition.  Things couldn't be better.

With this movie, we find director Alfred Hitchcock at his most playful and Cary Grant at his most debonair.  It's a potent combination for one of the screen's choicest comedy thrillers, ""North By Northwest.""

Actually, I suppose one might best describe ""North by Northwest"" as a romantic adventure comedy thriller.  It is quintessential Hitchcock, containing every ingredient the old master had perfected up to that point, 1959.  The two films that came directly after would follow different paths, ""Psycho"" in 1960 and ""The Birds"" in 1963 adding outright shock and a little fantasy to the mystery.  But ""North by Northwest"" stays clear of too many scary episodes, and when things do get tense for a few minutes they are sure to lighten up before long.

What we have here is the innocent bystander caught up in extraordinary events, believed by no one and pursued by everyone.  If that sounds like ""The 39 Steps"" or ""The Wrong Man"" or ""The Man Who Knew Too Much,"" you'll already have the idea of Grant's predicament.  He plays a Madison Avenue advertising executive, Roger Thornhill, whom a gang of international spies mistake for a secret agent named George Kaplan.  They kidnap Thornhill and attempt to make him talk; they never mention what they want him to talk about, nor should they.  It is, in fact, what Hitchcock called a McGuffin, a plot gimmick that moves the story along but, otherwise, has no real purpose.  Therefore, we don't need to know what the bad guys want from Kaplan, only that they're after him and they think Thornhill is their man.

Anyway, Thornhill gets away from them and in the process manages to appear as though he's killed a man, right in the middle of the U.N. Building in full view of witnesses and a photographer!  Now, he figures the only way to prove his innocence is to find the real murderers, which leads to a cross-country romp, a romance, and at least two of the most celebrated chase sequences ever filmed.

Don't even begin to figure out the reason behind it all.  In Ernest Lehman's blithely illogical plot, the spies are after Thornhill, the police are after him, his picture is in all the newspapers, so he hides out on a train, where he meets a young woman named Eve Kendall, played by Eva Marie Saint.  Ms. Saint is in the mold of many Hitchcock heroines--Grace Kelly, Kim Novak, Janet Leigh, Tippi Hedren--blond, beautiful, seemingly harmless, but harboring more secrets than she lets on.

James Mason plays the chief scoundrel, Phillip Vandamm, with roguish charm.  I mean, men with British accents make for such wonderful heavies, don't they?  One can't help thinking of Basil Rathbone, Alan Rickman, Jeremy Irons, and the rest.  Maybe it's the something about the pompous precision of the scoundrels' enunciation that makes us long to see them get their comeuppance.  In any event, Mason makes a strong, menacing, gentleman villain, ordering about several henchmen, including Martin Landau as the sinister and enigmatic Leonard.  Leo J. Carroll, a reliable staple of Hitchcock films, plays the Professor, a CIA operative we're never too sure about until the very end.

Indeed, nothing in Lehman's script is quite what it appears to be.  For instance, Grant is almost too handsome, too fit, too elegant, too suave, too refined for anyone to trust.  Remember, as an ad man, his business is duplicity; he lies for a living.  Then, too, his middle initial is O, as in zero, because it stands for nothing except to give him the acronym ROT.  Nothing but rot?  Curious, no?  As a piece of further mischief, Jessie Royce Landis plays his mother in the film, yet she was in reality only seven or eight years older than Grant.  Well, it does tend to make Grant seem younger than his actual mid-fiftyish age and helps us to accept his romance easier with the much-younger Eva Marie Saint.

Finally, you may wonder, where is Hitchcock's famous cameo in all of this?  Audiences would sometimes spend as much energy looking for Hitch's appearance as they did following the plot.  As in most of his later films, the director gets it over with early on, playing a fellow trying to catch a bus and being shut out.

Trivia note:  ""North by Northwest"" made such an impression on the producers of the first Bond film in the early Sixties, they tried to recreate the movie's substance and style in their own picture.  Not only that, they even tried to hire Cary Grant for the part of 007.  Grant declined because he wanted too much money and because he wouldn't do more than one film.  Grant would go on, though, to reprise much the same tone and material as here several years later for director Stanley Donen in ""Charade,"" both films providing romance, excitement, suspense, and humor in equal measure.

Video:
Heading vaguely northwest from New York via Northwest Airlines, Thornhill winds up dodging a biplane in a Midwestern cornfield and later hanging from the face of Mt. Rushmore.  And here's where Warner Brothers' fully restored and remastered, high-definition, 1.85:1 ratio widescreen transfer comes into its own.  Using a dual-layer BD50 and a VC-1 1080p encode (reduced from an 8K image scan), the engineers ensure that the movie's Technicolor VistaVision image (from a 1.50:1 ratio negative) never looked better.  With tints and hues very deep and vivid, the corn stalks were never more distinct nor the Presidents' faces more realistically represented on the home screen.  Which is somewhat ironic since Hitchcock faked the cornfield in the Southern California area near Bakersfield, and because the National Park Service wouldn't let him film on Mt. Rushmore, he built the whole Mt. Rushmore set in Hollywood.

Nevertheless, through the magic of movies, everything looks authentic, and the Blu-ray disc's excellent visual qualities reproduce every nuance in gleaming clarity.  About the only things I can fault are minor:  The definition varies somewhat from scene to scene and shot to shot, and the picture quality never gleams or glistens but seems a bit reserved, with surfaces just slightly veiled.  Fortunately, the image's clean screen and excellent dimensionality more than make up for it.

Audio:
As important, the audio engineers remixed and transferred the film's audio in lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 to good advantage.  It's not state-of-the-art 5.1, certainly, but it acquits itself well enough. The crop-duster plane flies over the audience in surround sound, and when it does, several times, it makes a vigorous impression.  Underscored by Bernard Herrmann's riveting musical track, the whole film is a delight to look at, listen to, and enjoy.  What the TrueHD reproduction brings to the equation is its rock-solid stability and smoothness, making the regular, lossy Dolby Digital track seem more forward and lightweight.

Extras:
Appropriate to a film of this caliber, Warner Brothers offer ""North by Northwest"" in a 50th Anniversary Blu-ray Book Edition, with several new bonuses.  The newly made items include a 2009 documentary called ""The Master's Touch:  Hitchcock's Signature Style,"" fifty-seven minutes on Hitchcock's influence on the mystery-suspense genre; followed by ""North By Northwest:  One for the Ages,"" also from 2009, twenty-five minutes on the making of the film with comments from fellow filmmakers, actors, and writers.

The rest of the items are a little older.  There's an audio commentary by the film's screenwriter, Ernest Lehman; an eighty-seven minute career profile, ""Cary Grant:  A Class Apart,"" made in 2004 and hosted by Helen Mirren and Jeremy Northam; and a thirty-nine minute documentary, ""Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North By Northwest,"" produced in 2000 and hosted by Eva Marie Saint that provides background information, interviews, and behind-the-scenes footage on the filmmaking.

In addition, you'll find a stills gallery; a music-only audio track for those who just want to highlight Herrmann's notable score; theatrical trailers and TV spots, including a wonderfully droll trailer hosted by Hitchcock himself; forty-six scene selections; English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, Danish, Italian, Finnish, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish subtitles; and English and German captions for the hearing impaired.

The disc comes housed in the back of a forty-four page, hardbound Blu-ray Book with pictures and text covering numerous aspects of the film and filmmaking.  Very nice.

Parting Thoughts:
As the movie goes on, misunderstandings, irony, and deception build on more misunderstandings, irony, and deception.  The last twenty minutes of ""North by Northwest"" abandon whimsy altogether and turn into genuine tension and thrills.  This movie never lets us go in peace until the final fade-out.  But we wouldn't have it any other way.  It's classic Hitchcock.

112272,5,0790743213,"North by Northwest is a thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint and James Mason. The screenplay was written by Ernest Lehman, who wanted to write ""the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures"".

North by Northwest is a tale of mistaken identity, with an innocent man pursued across the United States by agents of a mysterious organization who want to stop his interference in their plans to smuggle out microfilm containing government secrets. Author and journalist Nick Clooney praised Lehman's original story and sophisticated dialogue, calling the film ""certainly Alfred Hitchcock's most stylish thriller, if not his best"".This is one of several Hitchcock movies with a music score by Bernard Herrmann and features a memorable opening title sequence by graphic designer Saul Bass. This film is generally cited as the first to feature extended use of kinetic typography in its opening credits.

While having lunch at the Plaza Hotel in New York, advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill has the bad luck to call for a messenger just as a page goes out for a ""George Kaplan."" From that moment, Thornhill finds that he has stepped into a nightmare -- he is quietly abducted by a pair of armed men out of the hotel's famous Oak Room and transported to a Long Island estate; there, he is interrogated by a mysterious man who, believing that Roger is George Kaplan, demands to know what he knows about his business and how he has come to acquire this knowledge. Roger, who knows nothing about who any of these people are, can do nothing but deny that he is Kaplan or that he knows what they're talking about. Finally, his captors force a bottle of bourbon into Roger and put him behind the wheel of a car on a dangerous downhill stretch. Through sheer luck and the intervention of a police patrol car and its driver (John Beradino), Roger survives the ride and evades his captors, and is booked for drunk driving. He's unable to persuade the court, the county detectives, or even his own mother of the truth of his story, however -- Thornhill returns with them to the mansion where he was held, only to find any incriminating evidence cleaned up and to learn that the owner of the house is a diplomat, Lester Townsend, assigned to the United Nations. He backtracks to the hotel to find the room of the real George Kaplan, only to discover that no one at the hotel has ever actually seen the man. With his kidnappers once again pursuing him, Thornhill decides to confront Townsend at the United Nations, only to discover that he knows nothing of the events on Long Island, or his house being occupied -- but before he can learn more, Townsend gets a knife in his back in full view of 50 witnesses who believe that Roger did it. Now on the run from a murder charge, complete with a photograph of him holding the weapon plastered on the front page of every newspaper in the country, Thornhill tries to escape via train -- there he meets the coolly beautiful Eve Kendall, who twice hides him from the police, once spontaneously and a second time in a more calculated rendezvous in her compartment that gets the two of them together romantically, at least for the night. By the next day, he's off following a clue to a remote rural highway, where he is attacked by an armed crop-dusting plane, one of the most famous scenes in Hitchcock's entire film output. Thornhill barely survives, but he does manage to learn that his mysterious tormentor/interrogator is named Phillip Vandamm, and that he goes under the cover of being an art dealer and importer/exporter, and that Eve is in bed with him in every sense of the phrase -- or is she?

This is a great film, and certainly one of the most entertaining movies ever made, directed by Alfred Hitchcock at his peak. It has all the classic elements of a Hitchcock film - well timed suspense, an overall mystery, a compelling cast and some brilliantly conceived scenes. Finally,it has stood the test of time as a gripping, suspenseful, and visually iconic, this late-period Hitchcock classic laid the groundwork for countless action thrillers to follow for many years to come.",1433635200,,4161,4.760387811634349

Alfred Hitchcock made this gem back in the late 50's and today it still resonates with quality film making from acting to the editing.

It's a great fun story to watch in a time not too many of us are familiar with anymore. When you watch it pay close attention to the clothes they wore to the cars they drove back then. To see the contrast of America back in the 50's to how we live now is very interesting.

Cary Grant is funny and James Mason is great as the calm and sophisticated villain. The story opens up by grabbing your attention and leading you along with Grant as he tries to out wit his crafty oppressors. This is an awesome suspense thriller at it best.",1424044800,,733,4.2214285714285715

If the story is not remembered or commented on, everyone is familiar with the scene where Grant is getting attacked by a crop duster while standing in the middle of nowhere ""North by Northwest"".

Roger O. Thornhill <R.O.T> (Cary Grant), mild mannered advertising executive, raises his hand at the wrong time to send a telegram. The page boy is paging George Kaplan so Roger is mistaken for Kaplan (a shorter man with dandruff) and the fun begins. Turns out that Townsend/ Vandamm (James Mason) the bad guy  is being dogged by Kaplan so Vandamm must do away with Kaplan.

Meanwhile back at the train Roger meats a cutie Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) that is apparently set on helping him.

I will not go into details as surprise and plot twisting is part of the suspense.

Will Roger get the girl?
Will Vandamm get Roger?
What is this all about?
Who is George Kaplan?",1421452800,,952,4.642857142857143
112336,4,0790743213,"Gizli Teskilat / North by Northwest, 1958 film

The film starts in late 1950s Manhattan, showing an ""advertising executive"" Roger Thornhill who is skilled in lying to the public as part of his employment by corporations. Roger attends a meeting, calls for a pageboy, and winds up being abducted in plain view of the public! (Danger in public is a common theme in thrillers, as is mistaken identification.) Roger cannot tell his captors what they want to hear (even if they used torture), so they fill him with bourbon and take him for a ride. This provides an entertaining interlude until Roger stops for the police and is arrested by Sgt. Emil Klinger. The Judge orders an investigation, but they find nothing amiss at the borrowed estate. [No check with the local police?] Roger discovers that no one has actually seen George Kaplan. The abductors show up at the hotel, but Roger escapes one again. [No back-up?] When Roger meets Lester Townsend at the UN, a knife silences Townsend permanently, and Roger is blamed for it.

The ""Professor"" discusses this at the Agency in Washington, where we learn what is really going on - decoy spy. Roger must become his own detective to solve this mystery. The film shows travel on the famous New York Central railroad to Chicago, a bit of history long gone. Roger meets a woman, Eve Kendall, who helps and befriends him. [Was this a theme in the old E. Philip Oppenheim stories?] But we soon learn she is working for Van Dam! Roger arrives in Chicago, then travels to a spot in a flat prairie, and waits. Could there be any danger in the wide open spaces? A crop duster appears to answer this question; there seems to be no escape. The plane crashes (!) and Roger escapes once again. [Wily Coyote could take lessons from him.]

Roger meets Eve but is told to go away and never return. There is something mysterious about Eve. Note how Hitchcock was able to create suspense and tension from ordinary life. Roger follows Eve, meets Van Dam and his flunky Leonard, but escapes again. Now the ""Professor"" meets Roger and takes him to Rapid City SD. There is yet another meeting with Van Dam, Leonard, and Eve. Eve shoots Roger, who is carried away by the ""Professor"". More events follow as the details of the spy ring are brought out. Eve and Roger make a getaway by climbing down the sculptures of Mount Rushmore. They escape from their pursuers who are caught by the authorities. And so the film has a happy ending, if forced.

This was a top film in its day, but now it seems terribly out of date. Films such as ""From Russia With Love"" or ""Goldfinger"" are better and less dated than what was Hitchcock's best film. Roger complains against the ""Professor"" for sacrificing people like pawns, although we learned more in future years. [The ""Professor"" was a fictionalized version of Allen Dulles, some say.] This film is an updated version of ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"".

One of the problems in this film is the crop-duster plane. It would be more probable to send out a car with two men to take Roger for a ride, but less spectacular. This comment also applies to the helicopter in ""From Russia With Love"". Do they copy each other's mistakes?",1421452800,,3178,4.647686832740214

112359,5,0790743213,"I hate to admit it, but had North by Northwest not been a required movie for my film studies class, I would likely have gone my whole life without seeing it.  That being said, I am so glad that I did see it.

Most movies I see are exceptionally predictable.  So many directors an screen writers seem to have such a low opinion of viewers that they telegraph major plot points ahead of time as if to prepare the viewer to a plot twist that is coming.  The effect is to remove all surprise from the movie.  In North by Northwest Hitchcock rarely did this.

The cinematography in North by Northwest is excellent.  The film is not pretty by today's standards, but for the technology of the time it is great.  The acting is top notch and the casting superb.  The casting of Martin Landau as Leonard was perfect.  The man oozes sinister.  Grant and Saint were also great casting choices for the lovers.  Grant, despite being 55 years old, was still debonair and attractive.  Saint was gorgeous and at 35 was still able to play a 26 year old sex interest.  Their chemistry was believable and their performances were exceptional.

Overall the only thing negative I can think to say about the film is that the volume of the dialogue is low compared to the rest of the movie.  I had to have the television up loud in order to fully hear all of the dialogue.  The score is obviously dated, but still highly effective.

I ended up completely drawn into the story and even watched it twice.  The only other movie I have watched twice in short order was Avatar when I took my wife to go see it after I had already watched it with a buddy.  I didn't even watch The Godfather a second time. This is now one of my favorite movies and I will be recommending it to my friends.  I give it 5 / 5 (Must see).",1417737600,,1786,4.287425149700598

112386,5,0790743213,"A Gibson and other Libations still come to mind when I think of NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Released in 1959, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is and remains a brilliant piece of filmmaking from Alfred Hitchcock, but really so much more than that. Bernard Herrmann's magnificent groundbreaking score truly stands out in this film and has become legendary in many ways as so many of the images have become in the film. To watch it again and enjoy like never before is to realize just how entertaining this film is and how it has stood the test of time. They really do not make them like this anymore. Cary Grant inimitably is Roger Thornhill. I like his personal book of cigarette matches monogrammed with R.O.T. The O stands for nothing so he tells Eva Marie Saint on the dinning car of the 20th Century Limited. You know, I have been drinking Gibsons ever since Cary Grant ordered one in that scene.

Even a great Bond-redolent femme fatale is there too with the incredible Eva Marie Saint giving a striking, over-the-top performance.  With his incredible acting style and screen persona it's not surprising that the first pick of producers Broccoli and Saltzman to play Bond was Cary Grant (Sean Connery was down the list).

A masterful mix of comedy and suspense from Alfred Hitchcock. Advertising executive Roger Thornhill [Cary Grant] is lunching in a restaurant with his mother when he mistakenly answers a page for one George Kaplan. He soon finds himself on the run across the country, being pursued by enemies of the government who are convinced that he is a secret agent. He finds a friend in Eve Kendall [Eve Marie Saint], who helps conceal him during a perilous train journey, but soon discovers that she is not all she seems.

FILM FACT: `North by Northwest' was nominated for three awards at the 32nd Academy Awards Ceremony for Best Film Editing for George Tomasini. Best Production Design for William A. Horning, Robert F. Boyle, Merrill Pye, Henry Grace, Frank McKelvy. Best Original Screenplay for Ernest Lehman. This is one of several Alfred Hitchcock films with a music score by Bernard Herrmann and features a memorable opening title sequence by graphic designer Saul Bass. This film is generally cited as the first to feature extended use of kinetic typography [the technical name for ""moving text""] in its opening credits. Alfred Hitchcock's cameo appearances are a signature occurrence in most of his films.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: ""I want to do a Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures"" is the comment screenwriter Ernest Lehman made to Alfred Hitchcock one day in 1957. With North by Northwest [1959] the ultimate Alfred Hitchcock picture is exactly what they produced. All of Alfred Hitchcock's trademark themes are here in the story of an everyday man [Cary Grant] caught up in a swirl of mysterious events like spies and chasing microfilm, while being helped by a beautiful blonde [Eva Marie Saint]. There's a gripping, imaginative chase scene and the entire film wraps up at an unexpected public landmark like Mount Rushmore.

North by Northwest came into existence when Alfred Hitchcock and writer Ernest Lehman hit a brick wall while working on the nautical thriller, The Wreck of the Mary Deare [1959] [Metrocolor and in CinemaScope]. They messed around for a few weeks while telling the studio the project was going great until one day Lehman thought of creating a pure Alfred Hitchcock film. The director could never resist a challenge and immediately clicked with the idea, especially since he'd longed to use Mount Rushmore as a location but never had an appropriate project. So while Alfred Hitchcock was filming Vertigo [1958] the two would get together and thrash out the script and further plans for a film that was then called In a Northwesterly Direction. Oddly enough it was also briefly entitled Breathless which a year later would be the English title of the debut feature from Jean-Luc Godard, a massive Alfred Hitchcock fan. The resulting screenplay was tight, balanced and intricate; Alfred Hitchcock later told Francois Truffaut that ""In this picture nothing was left to chance."" The script also made liberal use of the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock's name for a device that keeps the story in motion even though in itself it's practically meaningless. The key MacGuffin in North by Northwest is the secret information sought by James Mason's sinister operation even though we never learn why it matters. This was Alfred Hitchcock's personal favourite, one he said had ""been boiled down to its purest expression: nothing at all!""

From the beginning, Alfred Hitchcock and Ernest Lehman planned on casting Cary Grant as their innocent leading man even though James Stewart showed extreme interest in the project despite his ignorance of the plot. Thanks to Cary Grant's contractual percentages and a daily pay rate that kicked in when the film took longer than expected for completion, the actor made quite a bit of money from his participation in North by Northwest. It was his fourth and final Hitchcock film and Cary Grant brought his usual debonair charm and a genuine sense of confusion and bewilderment to the part. During shooting Cary Grant said to Alfred Hitchcock, ""It's a terrible script. We've already done a third of the picture and I still can't make head or tail of it."" The comment greatly amused Alfred Hitchcock because, far from being a flaw, that exactly mirrored what Cary Grant's character was feeling as well.

For the role of the woman spy there was some minor conflict. Cary Grant pushed to have Sophia Loren because he at one time had romantic interest in her but she left to film Two Women in Italy, but the studio wanted Cyd Charisse. Alfred Hitchcock of course preferred one of his trademark blondes and gave the part to Eva Marie Saint On the Waterfront, even personally picking out most of her on-screen wardrobe. By the way, see if you can read Eva Marie Saint's lips during her line ""I never discuss love on an empty stomach"" since the audio was supposedly dubbed over the original line ""I never make love on an empty stomach.""

While the story covers a wide span of the United States, filming was mostly brief location shots and extensive studio work. Alfred Hitchcock and cast started in New York in August 1958. A hidden camera was used to film Grant entering the United Nations building but they weren't able to film in the real UN lobby because it had been used somewhat inappropriately in an earlier film so all films were forbidden there. Instead they filmed on a studio set that had been recreated as accurately as possible. Alfred Hitchcock had gone through the real lobby with a still photographer while pretending to be a tourist and getting numerous snapshots. The director ran into a similar problem at Mount Rushmore. The Department of Interior, which operates the monument and not only wouldn't allow filming on the actual sculpture but they also wouldn't give permission for actors to crawl over a reproduction either. A compromise was reached where the actors went between the faces instead of over them, but except for a few exteriors the whole Mount Rushmore scene was filmed at the M-G-M studios. Perhaps it's a good thing that Alfred Hitchcock gave up his plan to have one of the characters erupt in a sneezing fit while hiding in a statue nose.

The famous scene where Cary Grant being chased through a cornfield by a crop duster is an example of Hitchcock at his best. It came about because he had noticed that when most directors try to make a suspenseful scene they use tight alleyways, shadows barely visible through the gloom and the slow building tension of the approaching menace. So Alfred Hitchcock did exactly the opposite, filming in full daylight, completely open space and a very fast machine. Similarly, most directors gradually shorten each individual shot in such a scene as a way of increasing the tension, but Hitchcock kept his shots fairly uniform so that a viewer gets a better idea of how far and where Cary Grant is running. The finished scene lasts around seven minutes with no dialogue and is as remarkable as the shower scene he devised for Psycho a year later. The studio, however, wasn't quite so appreciative. They wanted to cut the film thinking that at 136 minutes it was too long. But Alfred Hitchcock's contract prevented that, and he insisted that some of what they were trying to cut was in fact vital to the film.

Cary Grant, a veteran member of the Alfred Hitchcock acting varsity, was never more at home than in this role of the advertising-man-on-the-lam. He handles the grimaces, the surprised look, the quick smile, the aforementioned spooning and all the derring-do with professional aplomb and grace. In casting Eva Marie Saint as his romantic vis-&agrave;-vis, and Alfred Hitchcock has plumbed some talents not shown by the actress here before. Although she is seemingly a hard, designing type, she also emerges both the sweet heroine and a glamorous charmer. Jessie Royce Landis contributes a few genuinely humorous scenes as Mr. Grant's slightly addle-pated mother. James Mason is properly sinister as the leader at the spy ring, as are Martin Landau, Adam Williams, Robert Ellenstein and Josephine Hutchinson, as members of his malevolent troupe. And Leo G. Carroll is satisfyingly bland and calm as the studious intelligence chief.

Overall, North by Northwest receives my high marks in numerous ways and gives us a colourful and exciting route for spies, counterspies and lovers. Part of this colourful and exciting route can be explained through the cross-cutting technique. In nearly all of the suspenseful scenes, including the drunken car chase, the police chase in the train station, and the climatic Mount Rushmore scene, the rapid scene change from Mr. Roger Thornhill to those in pursuit creates a heightened level of suspense. I also found the rapid pace of North by Northwest to be extremely engaging. Nearly every scene, the viewer is learning more about the truth behind Roger Thornhill. Each scene provides a small piece of evidence and the pace of the film made me eager to learn about the next clue. North by Northwest is an engaging film that combines a wide range of genres ranging from suspense to humour. The continuity techniques of establishing shots, reverse shots, and match editing allows the viewers to experience a suspenseful, yet smooth story. The importance of each scene keeps the viewer engaged in all of the details. The constant feeling of suspense, as well as using both continuity and discontinuity techniques made North by Northwest is an extremely suspenseful and worthwhile experience.

Blu-ray Video Quality  When Warner Home Video released 'North by Northwest' on the inferior DVD format in 2000, it instantly became one of the preeminent classic film transfers of the digital age, so expectations were understandably sky-high when the company announced a Blu-ray edition of Alfred Hitchcock's iconic chase film earlier this year. The restoration price tag reportedly topped $1 million, but it was money very well spent, as 'North by Northwest' comes closer to achieving perfection than any other 1080p classic film transfer I've seen. The 50-year-old film looks so good; in fact, it puts many recent Blu-ray releases to shame. Shot in VistaVision, which was a short-lived, higher resolution widescreen process developed by Paramount in the mid-1950s. 'North by Northwest' is a natural for a Blu-ray makeover, and its exquisitely balanced colour and contrast, along with its fine grain structure, which is a VistaVision staple, produces a very crisp, dimensional, utterly pleasing viewing experience. Grain-haters will no doubt rhapsodise over the picture's sleek appearance, but the 1080p encoded image never looks processed or digitally smoothed. A palpable filmic feel still prevails, and though a few brief scenes sport a hint more grain than most, the levels never seem out of whack. The transfer's quality is evident from the film's opening frames. The fluorescent green background, over which the credits roll, is solid and vibrant, and as it gradually dissolves into the glass faade of a skyscraper reflecting Manhattan's teeming cityscape, the level of detail is striking. It is a very tricky shot, and flawlessly rendered. Background accents are always razor sharp, so whether Cary Grant is navigating the Big Apple's jammed sidewalks, a dense Indiana cornfield, or the face of Mount Rushmore, the image is always packed with information, and its depth and dimension easily immerse us in the on-screen action. Alfred Hitchcock also employs a hefty amount of rear projection work, one of his few shortcomings, in my opinion, and though it's always apparent, it's well integrated into the whole. Colour-wise, primaries pop, but never look synthetic or overly saturated, and though the film's palette often emits a sterile coolness, enough warmth permeates the picture to keep its temperature in check. Cary Grant's heavily tanned skin rivals that of George Hamilton, yet it still appears natural, as do all flesh tones. Blacks are deliciously inky, but no incidents of crush drown out shadow detail. Close-ups are strong, despite the stylistic use of filters to shave a few years off Cary Grant's age and soften Eva Marie Saint's facial features and textures, such as the weave of various suits, wall coverings, leather upholstery, even the coarse hair on Cary Grant's knuckles, are clearly discernible. Simply put, this is a stunning gorgeous 100% effort that perfectly represents this Alfred Hitchcock masterwork. Once again, Warner Bros. proves just how brilliant classic films can look on Blu-ray, and this impeccable transfer more than whets our appetite for the riches yet to come.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack is a fine upgrade from the DVD's previous 5.1 Dolby Digital audio, but doesn't quite achieve the same wow factor as the video. First of all, don't be afraid to pump up the volume; I found the track to be surprisingly quiet at first, yet after two or three sizeable increases above my normal settings, I finally reached a comfortable listening level. Warner Bros. TrueHD classic film tracks always seem to be mixed a little on the soft side, but handle augmented volume extremely well. Surround sound elements are understandably faint throughout most of the film, but boy do those rears come alive during the crop-dusting sequence, as the plane makes its dipping and diving passes over Cary Grant, the cornfield, and my living room sofa. (It's hard to imagine a 50-year-old film competing sonically with today's action epics, but 'North by Northwest' tries its best during this one classic scene.) When the surrounds are silent, the front channels pick up the slack with some distinct stereo separation that lends the audio welcome scope. Dialogue is well prioritised and always easy to understand, even when spoken in hushed tones, and Bernard Herrmann's highly recognizable score sounds terrific. Though it doesn't wrap around us as much as we'd like, its fullness of tone and enhanced fidelity make almost every instrument distinguishable. The screeching strings always resist distortion, and the low-end horns and percussion lend great weight to select scenes. For those who truly want to experience and revel in Bernard Herrmann's marvellous score, a music-only track can be accessed through the disc's special features. Details are always crisply rendered, from the subtle use of hedge-clippers early in the film to the gravel beneath Cary Grant's shoes as he shuffles his feet while awaiting the crop-duster's surprise attack. And the one big bass moment doesn't disappoint, as the subwoofer pumps out a hefty rumble during a memorable crash and subsequent explosion. Best of all, the track is as clean as a whistle, with no errant pops, static, or hiss betraying the film's advanced age and of course sound is an essential Hitchcockian element, and the superior audio on this disc does the film proud. So all in all Warner Home Video have done a sterling work all round.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Screenwriter Ernest Lehman: The late screenwriter Ernest Lehman was a very sprightly 84 years old when he sat down to record this commentary in 2000, and his crystal clear memories of his close collaboration with Hitchcock and detailed chronicle of the creative process behind penning the 'North by Northwest' script make for a fascinating listen. He also recalls how composer Bernard Herrmann introduced him to Hitchcock, how he and the director hoodwinked M-G-M into letting them develop 'North by Northwest' instead of work on a previously arranged project, and how he visited all the various locales prior to writing and that included climbing halfway up the face of Mount Rushmore! Ernest Lehman starts slowly, but after 20 minutes or so picks up steam, and his insights will enlighten even diehard Alfred Hitchcock fans.

Special Feature Documentary: Cary Grant: A Class Apart [2004] [480i] [87:12] This was originally broadcast on the PBS channel in America, as part of the network's acclaimed 'American Masters' series, this incisive and interesting documentary and previously included in the Cary Grant NTSC DVD Box Set that contains the film 'North by Northwest,' and takes an in-depth look at Cary Grant's screen persona and how it shaped and affected his private life. Reminiscences from close friends, two wives, and noted critics provide fascinating perspective on the actor's professional and personal relationships, his difficult upbringing, stellar work ethic, and underrated talent. Film clips galore, from Cary Grant's first role in 1931 to his last in 1966; illustrate his versatility, magnetism, and iconic style. Though his contributions to cinema dominate this excellent profile, Cary Grant's five marriages, his controversial relationship with fellow actor Randolph Scott, experimentation with LSD, affair with Sophia Loren, and lifelong struggles with intimacy are also explored with integrity and good taste. This is required viewing for anyone with even a passing interest in this beloved Hollywood legend.

Special Feature Documentary: The Master's Touch: Hitchcock's Signature Style [2009] [480i] [57:32] This is a myriad aspects of Alfred Hitchcock's inimitable technique are scrutinised in this probing, well-produced piece that shows how the director's personal idiosyncrasies influenced his work. A host of fellow directors, from Martin Scorsese to John Carpenter, as well as Hitchcock himself, which via an archival interview, with comments on such topics as visual storytelling, subjective point of view, editing, and building suspense. We also learn about the fascinating villains Hitchcock often employed, the sense of humour that pervades his films, his selective use of sound, impeccable sense of style, and, of course, his penchant for blonde heroines. Clips from such classics as 'Dial M for Murder,' 'Strangers on a Train,' 'Stage Fright,' 'The Wrong Man,' 'I Confess,' and 'North by Northwest' illustrate the various points. This top-notch documentary is another must-view that will captivate Alfred Hitchcock junkies and those just discovering the master's work.

Special Feature Documentary: Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North by Northwest [2000] [480i] [39:27] Eva Marie Saint hosts this thoughtful look back at the film's production, which was included on the previous DVD release. Eva Marie Saint takes us through the film's shooting chronologically, and along the way relates personal anecdotes, spills secrets, identifies one notable gaffe, and recalls some on-set buffoonery. Martin Landau, Ernest Lehman, whose remarks on the commentary track were largely, if not totally lifted from his interview here, and Alfred Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, also share their memories of the director and his technique.

Special Feature Documentary: North by Northwest: One for the Ages [2009] [480i] [25:29] This all-new, absorbing documentary allows directors Curtis Hanson, Francis Lawrence, Guillermo Del Toro, and William Friedkin, along with screenwriter Christopher McQuerrie, the chance to honour, analyse, and dissect this Alfred Hitchcock masterwork. Among other things, the quintet identifies the various classic Alfred Hitchcock elements present in the film, discusses the script's surprising depth, and provides an in-depth examination of the crop-dusting scene.

Special Feature: Stills Gallery [2000] [1080p] [5:52] Forty-three stills in both black-and-white and colour are included in this gallery, which features on-set production shots, a selection of poster art, and photos of notable personalities like Eva Marie Saint, Ernest Lehman, and Patricia Hitchcock, during the shooting of interviews for the NTSC DVD's special feature package.

Special Feature: Theatrical Trailers [480i] [6:00] Includes a TV Spot [480i] [1:02] Plus, in addition to a black-and-white re-release TV spot and full colour re-release trailer, there's this amusing theatrical preview, plus again 'A Guided Tour with Alfred Hitchcock,' in which the master himself hypes 'North by Northwest' as if he were a travel agent hawking a cross-country vacation.

Special Feature: Music-only Track: Presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital, the switch to the track is apparent, lacking much of the sound options smoothness and dynamic range. Though it's somewhat disappointing, the score is such a strong component of the film that in this case there's really not much benefit to the isolated track. Forced to choose between isolation and higher resolution, I recommend the latter.

BONUS: Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook: This stunning 43-page full-colour DigiBook, contains two short essays, actor, director and screenwriter bios, and lots of great publicity stills, behind-the-scenes photos, and one-sheets.

Finally, Alfred Hitchcock fans rejoice! The master's first American high-definition release hits the ball out of the park. 'North by Northwest' may be 50, but this immortal action-comedy thriller doesn't look or sound anywhere near that old on Blu-ray. Superb video and audio immerse us in Roger Thornhill's desperate, madcap plight, while a fantastic array of extras puts Alfred Hitchcock and Cary Grant, and this wildly entertaining film in their proper perspective. The attractive Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook packaging adds an extra bit of panache to one of the year's classiest classic releases. One to own and replay it often, as one never gets tired of this Alfred Hitchcock stunning masterpiece. I know a lot of people hate the actor Cary Grant, well I find that totally negative outlook, as he is absolutely superb in this film especially and again this stunning Blu-ray package is outstanding and cannot be beaten and I am so proud to add it is to my Alfred Hitchcock Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

112476,5,0790743213,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 thriller was such a one-of-a-kind movie when I saw it in its initial release that I was starving for repeat viewings in the next few years, during which the movie had yet to be shown on television and watching movies at home was limited to catching TV broadcasts. I did manage to see the movie in seven theatrical screenings during those years, marveling at how repeat viewings remained a roller coaster ride that left my legs wobbling!

A strong component of this movie experience, for me, was Bernard Herrmann's music score, which was not available on a soundtrack album, and the only piece of music I knew that could remotely reflect the impact of Bernard Herrmann's symphonic Main Title was, believe it or not, Falla's Ritual Fire Dance. Years later, I learned why: Herrmann's Main Title is a fandango--dance music usually performed by guitars and castanets. It has been said that you can't hum or whistle the Main Title theme from North by Northwest, but I submit that it could be played on guitars and castanets.

Nowadays, I have two recordings of Herrmann's fantastic score, including an original soundtrack recording, and now the Blu-Ray edition of this movie. I've lost count of how many times I've previously seen North by Northwest, but watching the Blu-Ray edition on my big new TV screen was a riveting experience. Not like watching the movie on TV or in an old print at a theater that shows classic movies. This viewing reminded me of seeing the movie in 1959.

The Blu-Ray book package is slim and handsome, and the special features on the single disk include three documentaries in addition to features on the earlier DVD version. But the main reason to get the Blu-Ray is to see the movie more clearly than we could ever see it at home before. You may have to hold onto your seat in the hair-raising climax.

112492,5,0790743213,"Although I have seen this movie 2-3 times I am looking forward to viewing it again.  Cary Grant was always great-looking and charming, a treat to watch even if he had been reading a cookbook to his audience.  This movie keeps the viewer in suspense from the very beginning.  Even though I am obviously showing my age with this review I cannot imagine that much younger people would not enjoy it.  No blood and guts spattered across the screen - just suspense and sophistication.",1397520000,,478,4.654761904761905

112494,1,0790743213,"I intended to show this to friends with dinner. Took a quick look at the beginning and changed my mind. Grant's dialogue is so juvenile, not at all funny, just stupid. Hard to believe a movie that got such good ratings back when it came out has such a stupid beginning. Don't buy this movie; you will be disappointed. I doubt it gets much better; dialogue is just too clever and silly. Real disappointment but keep in mind there are a lot of people who like this movie big time. I just couldn't watch Grant's acting and dialogue in the beginning.",1397174400,2,546,4.415841584158416
112495,5,0790743213,"North by Northwest is Hitchcock at his finest.  It combines a bit of humor, espionage, train escapades and love to create a thoroughly entertaining movie that can be watched again and again.  Calling upon a familiar Hitchcock theme of the ""wrong man"", Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), a simple ad executive, is mistaken for a CIA agent.  The plot thickens as Roger tries to clear up this misunderstanding.  Along the way he meets a beautiful girl (Eve Marie Saint), who is really a double agent.  Preposterous as the plot sounds, it is all woven together to create a believeable tale of the time period.  In addition to entertainment value, North by Northwest is a testament to fashion of the late fifties and the golden age of train travel.",1397088000,,738,4.771653543307087

112509,4,0790743213,"In the style of Alfred Hitchcock, the plot twists and turns through the story line.  There were a few questions though.  How much money did he normally carry with him?  How did he get past armed station security guards and board the train?  The station personnel really weren't aggressive enough and seemed to allow him to pass.  The genius of Hitchcock shows through in another escape, in dressing him as a 'red cap' and walking him past the security guards.  The following scene showing security guards accosting every red cap in the station while our hero R.O.T. walked away was priceless.  I would watch this movie again when I'm in the mood for a romantic adventure that succeeds against all odds.",1395878400,,702,4.75206611570248

This was one of Hitchcock's best and took him into what I would suggest his best period, just as some were suggesting he was too old. Perhaps the start of the period was with Vertigo in 1958 and followed by a string of great films - Psycho, The Birds, and Marnie.

The plot is the oft used wrong man story but supported by a great cast - Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Leo g. Carroll and Martin Landau.

112610,5,0790743213,"Was there ever a hero as perfect as Cary Grant in ""North by Northwest?"" Not for my money. In the classic tradition, Grant plays a slightly tarnished advertising man who gets swept into a deadly international conspiracy in which it's a little hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Along the way he becomes involved with the beautiful Eva Marie Saint, who is ""sleeping with the enemy"" while working undercover for American intelligence and while I am a big fan of Grace Kelly, Ms. Saint has that smokey kind of sexiness that set all our young male hearts afire back in the days when cars were a block long, had fins and were all made in Detroit. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is flawless and even though, by today's standards, the special effects are a little less than awe-inspiring, they still hold up all these years later. If you haven't seen this movie, by all means watch it. If you have then do what I have done: Watch it again and again. It really is that good.",1391040000,,974,4.477528089887641

112630,5,0790743213,"Another masterful Hitchcock.  The initial situation that the lead character, played by Cary Grant, finds himself in is believable and somewhat hazardous.

112631,5,0790743213,"N x NW is one of my favorites; I've probably watched it at least 5 tines. It took a director with Hitchcock's genius to create the cornfield scene, several minutes long with no dialog whatsoever. An added advantage is that you don't have to wait long to see Hitchcock's cameo role. Lastly, Hitchcock's bawdy joke at the end is a hoot!",1390867200,,334,4.491803278688525
112632,4,0790743213,I selected this film primarily because Cary Grant played in it.  I felt that any film with Grant in it would be worthwhile.  The story was both serious and entertaining.,1390867200,2,169,4.6
112633,4,0790743213,"Like all really good movies, the story is solid and the acting is great.  Hitchcock, again, uses an innocent and ""holy"" image...this time Mount Rushmore...being the backdrop of dastardly deeds.  It's a case of mistaken identity, spies, and, of course, a lovely damsel in distress.

As is typical in Hitchcock movies, the colors are grand and every scene is integral to the story.  Often in Hitchcock movies there is the ""one scene"".  In Psycho, it's obviously the shower scene.  In North by Northwest, it's the crop-duster scene.  Overall, one of Hitchcock's best and, in HD, really beautiful to watch.

If you've never seen this movie, it's worth a look.  Good stories and good cinema-photography never go out of style and this certainly fits the bill.  The HD transfer is great in blue-ray.  Grab some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy.",1390867200,2,833,4.920863309352518

112637,5,0790743213,"Of all of the Hitchcock films I've seen, ""North by Northwest"" is the most enjoyable. Cary Grant is in top form and delivers some hilarious lines.  The innocent man, the cross country chase, the crop duster, Mount Rushmore and the train going through the tunnel. What's not to like? ""Vertigo"" might be his best film, but ""North by Northwest"" is the most fun to watch again and again.",1390435200,,382,4.617647058823529

112767,4,0790743213,"It is a movie worthy of being watched again now and then as I have over the years.

Even if one has not watched the movie there are parts of it most people have seen such as the scramble down the face of Mt Rushmore or the crop duster scene.

Cary Grant plays an advertising executive who is mistaken for some kind of international criminal/spy. Real criminals/spies go after him. He eventually gets charged with a murder actually committed by one of the real criminals and has to go on the lam. Eva Marie Saint plays a character who helps him escape from the police.

It is a little risque, especially for the time, which may help explain some of its popularity at the time. There are slices of Americana that are forever gone such as train travel that are interesting by themselves.

The story is not real high on the plausibility scale, but it moves along fast enough that one does not have a whole lot of time to dwell on that.",1388534400,,931,4.364161849710983

112835,3,0790743213,"[This review is for the Blu-ray + Ultraviolet version released by Warner 2013]

I won't bother with commenting on the merits of the film itself - as already attested by other reviewers, it is an excellent Hitchcock film for the period, originally shot on 65mm emulsion, and with a memorable musical score.

Also, we are dealing with a film produced in 1958, but this is actually where my issue is: If we look at comparable VistaVision material of the era eg To Catch a Thief (1954) or The Searchers (1956), I think that this Warner 2013 release is merely a 'tweek' of the 2006 DVD master - and an indifferent one at that - an upscaling which actually has lost discernible colour saturation and depth from the std 2006 DVD - which is/was surprisingly good. Thus Warner's claim of 'State-of-the-Art Restoration' must be viewed with some disbelief, and probably applies to the std DVD (which as stated already is impressive for 576p)

By contrast, Paramount's 2012 Blu-ray treatment of 'To Catch a Thief' or Warner's own 'The Searchers' are veritable benchmarks in quality, especially the latter which Warner describes as 'New Digital High-Definition Transfer'. I believe this.

Given that Blu-ray is in a death struggle with HD on demand, it perhaps behoves their principals to keep a tighter rein on the quality. If they allow studios to simply upscale the std DVD stock without any attempt at meaningful re-mastering, they could find they are doing themselves a disservice in the long run.

In summary: Great movie, mediocre Blu-ray",1386633600,2,1532,4.922480620155039
112836,5,0790743213,"A great movie that holds up against today's thrillers.  It shows how a movie does not need excessive violence to succeed. One of Hitchcock's  best, but how can you miss with Gary Grant.",1386547200,,185,4.575757575757576

112862,4,0790743213,"Love the film but feel like the presentation of this set for a 50th anniversary package could have been better.  Why?  There are a few extras, there's a nice book built in to the set and the film looks good.  It just seems like one of Hitchcock's better films (not his best) deserved better treatment.  Not knowing what might be available for other extras makes it difficult to say what else should be here.  Maybe a more formal package with a separate booklet (sort of like the Criterion Collections series of films).  Maybe  a few outtakes if available.

The movie itself, while not my personal favorite Hitchcock, holds up nicely because it looks so good.  Cary Grant is excellent in his role as the ad man suddenly faced with disaster due to a case of mistaken identity.  The crop dusting sequence is top notch and the fight at Mt. Rushmore is well done though the segment still remains, to me at least, not the best use of effects.

A set worth buying, especially if you haven't experienced North by Northwest yet.",1386115200,2,1019,4.574585635359116

The sound has been remastered in stereo and sounds incredible compared to the VHS copies that were only available before this. Bernard Herrmann's magnificent groundbreaking score truly stands out. This DVD print is brilliantly sharp and exceptionally colorful. To watch it again and enjoy like never before is to realize just how entertaining this film is and how it has stood the test of time. They really do not make them like this anymore. Cary Grant inimitably is Roger Thornhill. I like his personal book of cigarette matches monogrammed with R.O.T.

The casting is brilliant.  For those of us old enough to remember Leo G. Carroll as the fussy, put-upon home owner in the TV series TOPPER, Carroll was the perfect Hitchcock character--seemingly innocuous and yet always with a great secret of one kind or another.  Cary Grant is ideal in his role, using his comic talents to play against the slightly one-note character he's given (""I'm not the man you think I am"" could have easily been his only line in the film as it's repeated in numerous variations--and Grant may well have found it pretty delicious, given that he always knew he was the Archie Leach of his birth and not the virtually mythical Cary Grant).  It's a great film, full of astonishing camera work and tongue-in-cheek sexuality.

112963,5,0790743213,"VistaVision was Paramount's widescreen process. The film frame was about 4 times the area of regular 35mm. That's why you can hardly see any grain. Paramount first used VistaVision on their 1954 release of WHITE CHRISTMAS and all of their bigger pictures through the early 60's. Paramount's opening credit on these films proclaimed ""VistaVision, Motion Picture High Fidelity"". And it was SHARP, SHARP, SHARP! Hitchcock had been doing his films for Paramount in the mid 50's and used VistaVision for all of them including TO CATCH A THIEF, THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY and VERTIGO among others. He evidently liked it so much that he probably insisted that MGM used it on NORTHWEST. Of course the transfer has to be good also to wind up with the superior quality seen on this disc. Want to show off your system...use this disc. The Blu Ray is out now and I can't begin to wonder how great the quality of that must be!

""Are you jealous?""  VanDamm responds. True, I never noticed that homoerotic angle until I watched the movie a second time. Although NORTH BY NORTHWEST is ostensibly a ""wrong man"" chase thriller,  Hitchcock is a master of telling good stories laced with an undercurrent of sex and desire...second to none. How the director suggests ... rather than spell it out explicitly...has always made him a superior director than just about anyone today.

And the Bernard Hermann score is heart-stopping - one of the best fusions of music to film in the business.  Just minor alterations of tone, pacing, and volume changes moods from mysterious to romantic to dangerous and back again. The music can make you grip your seat.

In the last 50 years, no action movie has topped the desperate escape attempt on top of Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock captures the scene as if the very souls of the Great Presidents were helping Cary Grant in his patriotic mission.

*some spoilers*

I watched this on Turner Classic's television channel (TCM). All their movies aired yesterday (Sunday) was all Hitchcock. And then Robert Osborne would comment about each movie before and after it's shown on their show. Like the interesting fact that Hitchcock was working on films since the 1920's. I didn't know that. He's also helped changed suspense movies from all being a B-movie to a Must-See movie. That seems about right.

I've seen only snip-its of this movie before watching it straight through. Like the famous scenes of the crop-duster airplane trying to kill Grant, as well as the very popular scene on the Mount Rushmore Monument. Seeing this entirely, I found it to be a really good spy suspense movie. The acting was really well done. And there was a lot of plot twists. So I felt - like Thornhill (Cary Grant), that there wasn't that many people to trust. There was of course some scenes where I wanted to throttle Grant - like taking a knife out of a dead guy's back at the U.N. building with loads of witnesses to see him do that. I would definitely call him a murderer before learning of his innocence because that's just plain stupid to take the knife. There was some new scenes that I really liked. The scene where Grant drives drunk down Long Island (which I learned was actually by the Californian coast and in Griffith Park - according to Wikipedia). The camera lense being obscured just so to make two things: 1) a night time illusion, and 2) a perspective look at what Thornhill saw while driving intoxicated. And the ending! This suspense building and then bam! Grant and Eva are on the train. That was nice to see their happy ending, but I think it could've been a better transfer between the two scenes.

So after the movie was over on Turner Classic channel, Robert Osborne began telling some fun facts about the movie. The first fun fact was that Hitchcock was at first thinking of having Jimmy Stewart play Roger Thornhill. But then changed his mind and chose Cary Grant. Grant then tried to persuade Hitchcock to cast Sophia Loren as Eve Kendall. But Hitchcock chose Eva Marie Saint instead because he wanted a blond.",1378684800,2,2191,4.668393782383419

112977,5,0790743213,"I decided to rewatch this for the first time since I saw it in the theater more than fifty years ago.  It has stood the test of time very well.  It has the classic Hitchcock tropes - the innocent man thrust into mortal peril, the femme fatale with a gradually revealed back story, the cliff-hanging (literally in this case) finale, the cameo of the rotund director.  All of this embodied in the suavity of Cary Grant and the cool beauty of Eva Marie Saint, and shot in spectacular locales, makes for welcome entertainment.

The transfer to hi-def TV was gorgeous, much better than I expected.  The Amazon servers and my high-speed Comcast internet connection provided uninterrupted viewing from beginning to end.  Highly recommended.",1378166400,,733,4.91869918699187

112981,5,0790743213,"One of the best films by Hitchcock, and one of the most popular films ever, North By Northwest is also one of those rare films that is even loved by people who are normally sticklers for detail. No matter that most of the incidents, most of the situations, and of course Hitchcock's beloved ""MacGuffin"" plot device do not make sense. Every element, however unbelievable, is so well done and so entertaining that we forgive the nonsense.

Cary Grant is New York advertizing executive Roger O. Thornhill, or ROT as it says on his personalized matchbooks. He is mistaken for a government agent by foreign spies and kidnapped with the intent of murder. He narrowly escapes, and in an attempt to find out why he was targeted he goes to the U. N. building to question the owner of the house where he was held captive, only to have the man murdered before his eyes by a thrown knife, a knife that naturally ends up in Thornhill's hand. Now on the run, he heads north by northwest for Chicago, then Rapid City South Dakota, following clues to clear his name.

Eventually Thornhill and Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a member of the spy ring, end up running for their lives atop Mt. Rushmore, leading to the famous scene where they are chased across the face of George Washington while Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt and Lincoln look on.

This is a marvelous film, mixing murder and humor as only Hitchcock could do it. The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is a classic, and fits Hitchcock's implausibly clockwork plot like a glove. A tiny aside: watch the little boy at the table in the background of the Mt. Rushmore cafeteria scene, as pistol-packing Eve Kendall confronts Roger Thornhill. Obviously they had rehearsed this scene a few times, and this kid was prepared.

And you should be prepared too, prepared to enjoy a fine evening of entertainment with the Master of Suspense and his talented crew: Cary Grant, Eve Marie Saint, James Mason as Vandamm the spy master, Leo G. Carroll as ""the Professor"" at the CIA, and Martin Landau as a spy henchman. Pure entertainment, and now available in high definition on Blu-ray.  And all those things you don't know about the top of Mount Rushmore, like the road, the luxury home and the airstrip? The film will reveal them all to you.

But I am here to say this is a superb Blu-ray edition. My all time favorite Grant/Hitchcock film is actually To Catch A Thief but NBNW comes in a very close second and both films are excellently remastered on Blu-ray. I own the UK edition of the Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection and for whatever reason it does not include North By Northwest of To Catch a Thief so to add to my personal Hitchcock Blu-ray film collection I had to purchase NBNW and TCAT as well as Strangers On A Train and Dial M For Murder which is slightly blurry due to the 3D tech at the time but is still a great film. Especially if you are a completest like me and want to round out your Grace Kelly and Cary Grant Hitchcock films in your collection. Kelly did three films for Hitch: Dial M For Murder, Rear Window and To Catch A Thief while personally my three favorite Cary Grant films are North By Northwest, To Catch A Thief and Charade. All available as exquisite remastered editions on Blu-ray. Charade available as a Criterion Collection edition. I originally owned a Criterion Laserdisc of NBNW but this Warner Digibook Edition blows that out of the water, it's a shame that Criterion lost the rights to so many titles like 2001, North By Northwest, The Fisher King and Time Bandits but they have found renewed life on Blu-ray. I only really mourn for The Fisher King because only the Criterion Collection Laserdisc had commentary and deleted scenes and so many special features that do not accompany any other video version of the film.
But North By Northwest either as a stand alone digibook by WB or in the Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection is in itself a masterpiece of a movie.",1377648000,,1914,4.518731988472623

It might be a little long for some people' but I can appreciate an old movie despite the length. Just think of it as A LOT of character development.

113003,5,0790743213,"I have always liked this film.  Hitchcock's script is deliciously written with Grant's character Roger O. Thornhill being mistaken for an undercover agent named George Kaplan.  Given Thornhill's position as an executive one would think that the sinister James Mason and his equally sinister aide Martin Landau would check into Thornhill's claim that he is not George Kaplan, but I guess they figured ""bird in hand""...  Jessie Royce Landis role as Grant's mother is lovely and amazing given that she and Grant were about the same age at the time this film was made.  I am not sure which scene I find most breathtaking and heart stopping - when Grant is chased by a crop duster plane on open fields or when he is trying to make his way across and upon Mount Rushmore with Eva Marie Saint.  I have been to Mount Rushmore and know that I would not want to make an attempt to climb it and especially at night.  I confess that I am surprised that the National Parks Service would allow anyone to climb Mount Rushmore, but this scene adds hugely to the suspense.  The musical score adds to the atmosphere of the cat and mouse game being played.  I own a copy of this film on DVD, but it wasn't until the 1990's that I finally could place part of the score.  I kept thinking that part of the musical score had been reused for another film.  Then when I purchased a copy of ""V"" {the first miniseries} I made the connection.  The part of the score used in the crop dusting scene was reused in part of this science fiction miniseries and was just as suspenseful as in ""North By Northwest"".  This film is one of Hitchcock's greatest achievements in movie making.  I have to admit that his ""Rear Window"" is my most favorite of Hitchcock's films, but ""North By Northwest is next in line.  Grant manages to inject his own zany humor when he talks about his various ex-wives who depend upon his earnings and when he is trying to convince the police that he was not drunk, but taken to a big house only to discover that the staff at the big house has changed and no one remembers seeing Grant.  I have always wondered if the police were in on this deal or if the 'respectable' people at the house were so convincing that it was thought that Grant had been drunk instead of drugged.  The scenes between Grant and Eva Marie Saint on the train are delightful.  This is a film that calls for the phone being turned off, the door bell ignored and home made popcorn.",1376870400,3,2443,4.429530201342282

113014,5,0790743213,"Fans of NXNW who have not seen this blu-ray version should DEFINITELY make the effort to do so.  The clarity of the blu-ray picture and sound surpass the high standard already set by the excellent DVD version and more than justify buying this pioneering spy caper anew.

NXNW is rightly acclaimed as a classic and most definitely still delivers as an engaging and fun relic of its time, abundant in 1959 elegance, style, droll wit, & class.  In many ways this (and its Hitchcock/Cary Grant predecessor&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Catch-a-Thief-Blu-ray/dp/B00AEBB8H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Catch a Thief [Blu-ray</a>]) were truly the first James Bond movies, as becomes glaringly apparent after even casual comparison.  Sean Connery's Bond was monumental, but it's just hard to imagine how the entire Bond series would have fared without having the suave, debonair Cary Grant there to blaze the trail as ""The Cat"" John Robbie in ""TCAT"" and of course as Roger Thornhill in ""NXNW"".

Now let's concede up front: you MUST disconnect your plausibility radar and just go along for the ride with NXNW and all its howling impossibilities.  Let's not even dig into them too much EXCEPT TO suggest that if you're looking to bump off a rival spy, are you REALLY going to try to lure him onto a dusty Indiana highway and try to puree him with the propeller of a biplane?  How does it happen that Thornhill (Grant) and the rival agents (James Mason, Martin Landau, Eva Marie Saint) all wind up on the 20th Century Limited after Thornhill goes on the lam from the UN?  For that matter, how likely is it that Thornhill even gets OUT of the UN after getting framed for the murder there?  --NEVER MIND!  You simply have to surrender to the night-at-the-movies popcorn FUN of it, and enjoy the rollercoaster of thrills, chills, romance & spy intrigue Hitchcock serves up here.  Sure, it's easy to chuckle at the stratospheric ""suspension of disbelief"" necessary to properly enjoy NXNW but really I think it's a deliberate part of the fun and not meant to stand up to serious scrutiny.

Cary Grant, in his fourth and final outing with Hitchcock delivers a knockout performance as the Madison Avenue adman on the run Roger Thornhill.  James Mason shines here also as the oh-so-elegant (but deadly) ""enemy agent"" Phillip Van Damme, with outstanding support from his menacing secretary Leonard, played with beady-eyed malice by Martin Landau.  Eva Marie Saint obviously owns the role of Eve Kendall, glamorous double-agent torn between her duty to maintain her cover and her growing love for Roger, but I personally still can't fully ""buy"" Eva as a ""femme fatale"" as depicted in NXNW. No complaints about her performance--she's excellent, and again, her name goes into immortality for this role, BUT I still think another actress would have been more credible as the ""morally flexible"" Eve Kendall than Eva Marie was able to project.  By her appearance and temperament, I think Eva was much better matched to her ""good girl"" roles, as in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Waterfront-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B00A8QDIMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Waterfront (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>]"", which played to her strengths much more than NXNW would allow.  Hitch already had two better qualified actresses ""in his company"" already in Ingrid Bergman (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Notorious-Blu-ray/dp/B0065N6K9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Notorious [Blu-ray</a>]"") and obviously Grace Kelly (""To Catch a Thief"").  STILL--I'm just offering my opinion here; Eva was great and more than nailed the part.

As other reviewers affirm, in many ways ""NXNW"" was the pinnacle of Hitchcock's career.  All the stars converged for this one; OUTSTANDING cast, script, cinematography, locations and all those intangibles necessary to create a CLASSIC which no one can deliberately conjure into being.  Let me pay special tribute here to that high-style Frank Lloyd Wright/""Mid-Century Modern"" style chateau all the principals converge on prior to their ""face-off"" grand finale on Mt Rushmore!  If such a house doesn't actually exist, well, it should!  I'm willing to cast my vote for NXNW as Hitchcock's greatest film, but I respect anyone who prefers ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vertigo/dp/B000I9YLXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vertigo</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho-1960/dp/B000I9YLWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho (1960)</a>"" or maybe even another.  No one's personal favorite is ever ""wrong"".

HOWEVER--here, in this luxuriant 50th Anniversary blu-ray, we're privileged to enjoy what may prove to be the BEST restoration & presentation of this classic movie EVER.  The colors, picture and sound are all STUNNING and exceed the already high standard set by the previous DVD release of NXNW.  I see this as an absolute ""demo quality"" blu-ray disc, a tour-de-force of what the format can deliver to re-ignite our appreciation of these old movies through OBSESSIVELY fastidious restoration and renewal.  (Another knockout example of classic movie restoration that will scorch your eyeballs with its beauty:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pillow-Talk-Blu-ray-DVD-Digital-Copy/dp/B0076I6242/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pillow Talk (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy)</a>.)

Blu ray EXTRAS abound here as well, including a fascinating documentary on the life & career of Cary Grant; obviously relevant and well worth viewer's time & interest.  The NXNW documentary hosted by Eva Marie is the same one provided on the original DVD, but it is likewise a worthy and a great bonus feature to enjoy after seeing the movie again.  My only gripe is that the sole commentary track, by writer Ernest Lehman, while certainly worthy of inclusion, isn't enough by itself.  A film of the stature of NXNW deserves one or more commentary tracks by some historians or directors who can offer insight into the historical context of the Cold War, Hitchcock's intentions/techniques, NXNW's influence on its times and later films, etc.  Stay tuned to see whether a 4K ""Special Sixtieth Anniversary Edition"" doesn't hit the Amazon pre-orders in 2019 to pick our pockets anew!

Until such a re-release appears on the horizon, THIS 50th Anniversary Edition certainly remains the ABSOLUTE ""Gold Standard"" for seeing and re-discovering the excellence and fun of NXNW.  If you've never seen NXNW before, maybe watch a Netflix or Amazon download (or check out a DVD from your local library); established fans of NXNW however, MUST see this exquisite blu-ray reissue to be awed by just what the blu-ray format is capable of with a movie you THINK you've already fully experienced and appreciated.

Finally: in a world overrun with movie kitsch and ""Gone With The Wind"" Barbies, and other assorted junk, there are only TWO movie props I would like to have for myself: FIRST (and most essential) the gold phone in the lobby of the Plaza Hotel Cary uses to call up to George Kaplan's room.  Second (and something I WOULD actually wear), how about one of the ""red caps"", the scarlet cabbie-style hats scurrying in herds in the Chicago train station where Cary & EMS disembark from the 20th Century.  WHERE can I find either (or both) of those for my personal ""NXNW"" appreciation shrine?",1376179200,2,7512,5.63943161634103

Looking for a safer location,he runs into a building where there are people, so that he is safe for now. When he finds himself catching a man who is falling toward him, he discovers there is a knife in the man's  back. In his efforts to try to save the guy, he pulls the knife out, thereby giving the people around him, the idea..wonders of wonders, he had put it there. Now he is on the run as  murderer. Keeping all the players separated, and putting them into 'Good guys.gals' and Bad guys/gals, crosses many roads, and states, when he boards a train going 'away from here'. With no ticket, now he is eluding the conductors. Saved by a gracious lady, who shares her dinner table and then her room with him, puzzles him to ask, what she has to gain by helping him. Eventually they also share bad guys, guns, and a hazardous mountain climb.

It's also Hitchcock's ultimate ""wrong man chased by both bad guys and good guys"" scenario - and defined the modern spy thriller as a roller-coaster thrill ride. It predated - and heavily influenced - the James Bond films starting with ""Dr. No,"" which came out three years later.

Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a dapper Manhattan advertising executive (the suit Grant wears has been called the greatest movie suit ever) who through a series of terrible misunderstandings becomes pursued by both a nest of enemy spies and the police. As he struggles to solve the mystery and clear his name, he meets Eve Kendall, an alluring woman (Eva Marie Saint at the peak of her beauty) who figures to be either his undoing or his salvation. Ernest Lehman's script provides wonderful dialogue, and the scene in the train's dining car where Kendall lures Thornhill into her berth is electric.

113061,5,0790743213,"North by Northwest is a film to be enjoyed over and over again, as is much of Hitchcock's work. From the first scene, the story moves as fast as its protagonist talks. Rushing from his office to a cocktail lounge, Roger O. Thornhill (ROT), fires off witty, risqu lines to his unfazed secretary, rushing her into a cab only to rush her back to the office the very same way as he walks fast as he can to get to that waiting martini. This is a warning of sorts, from Hitchcock to the viewer: Pay close attention or you're going to miss something important. There are conspicuous individuals in the lobby watching everyone and no one in particular. ROT joins his party, but his mind is still racing, going over what he'd told his secretary. He'd made an error that needs correcting. He decides to send her a message. A bellhop trots through shouting for George Kaplan, message for Mr. George Kaplan. Just then ROT raises a finger to get the bellhop's attention. The conspicuous men zero in on ROT, mistaking him for the mysterious George Kaplan. And that, plain and simple, is what we'd call the point of no return. In the minds of the conspicuous men, ROT is George Kaplan, international spy, and they're going to take him out. ROT follows the bellhop so he can get a message to his secretary, but suddenly he's got a henchman on each elbow, shoving him into a strange car and whisking him off to a mansion outside the city. Much as some lesser filmmakers might allow the story to slow down at this point, Hitchcock does not. ROT goes from kidnapping to car chase to murder witness (mistaken for murderer) to escape on a train, where he meets the eternally lovely Eve Kendall, a woman whose words would make a lesser man blush, but not ROT, and certainly not Cary Grant. The chemistry is electric and the tight story is as engaging as every action/adventure/thriller should be. You will not be disappointed in North by Northwest.",1373932800,,1926,4.569364161849711

113063,5,0790743213,"I always liked Hitchcock's older stuff, before he got obsessed with violence. NxNW is obviously of its era. The whole mix up starts with the arrival of a telegram, but the movie holds up well. It's still full of suspense, some dry comedy and a bit of romance. Cary Grant plays the innocent man thrown into the deep end of a pool where there's a mean game of water polo being played. Eva Marie Saint plays a typical Hitchcock heroine, a woman with a past who is maybe in a bit deeper than she expected. NxNW is a real tour of its times, from Madison Avenue, to stately Jay Gatsby country, to Chicago, to South Dakota and the Mount Rushmore monument. I'm not giving anything away. You've probably seen some of the now legendary scenes on Youtube. So, give NxNW a try. There are no neckties, killer birds or shower stabbing scenes.

113065,5,0790743213,"[Thornhill is wearing sunglasses to hide his identity]
Ticket Seller: Something wrong with your eyes?
Roger Thornhill: Yes, they're sensitive to questions.

Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a glib advertising executive who becomes involved in a dangerous game of mistaken identity. Eva Marie Saint is the perfect Ice Queen. The dialog sparkles and the plot is rich and twisted. Produced in 1959, this is a beautiful example of Hitchcock's best, a the balanced mystery- suspense- humor concoction. There are shots and scenes which are so classic they will remain with you long after you view it. And probably bring you back for repeated showings. The supporting cast is a great collection of character performers too.
A personal preference: I like viewing this one with Stanley Donen's 1963 film ""Charade"" (starring Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau.) This is the best Hitchcock style film never made by Hitchcock but Donen's homage. It features another fine assortment of supporting players.

113121,5,0790743213,"Not only is this a thoroughly brilliant motion picture with many famous sequences, but it's perhaps the least disturbing and most entertaining of Hitchcock's films. Cary Grant is at the apogee of his off-kilter coolness, and one scene after another demonstrates the powers of the master artist Hitchcock in complete command of his medium. The Ernest Lehman script is outstanding. Even the Saul Bass title sequence is ""iconic,"" to employ a now-ubiquitous word. The pic hurtles into motion with amazing swiftness, through a Byzantine sequence of events which sweep Grant into a world of narrative he does not comprehend, directed by a group of mysterious government agents who contemplate his fate like Olympian gods. Don't forget Bernard Herrmann's great score here, and Eva Marie Saint, though scarcely memorable as the romantic foil, serves her purposes well as one of Hitchcock's blonde placeholders and pawns. James Mason is fine. There really is--for the viewer who wants an introduction to what makes Hitchcock tick, and yet what makes the cinema a collaborative medium--no better place to start than North by Northwest. And although the plot is complex, it's so much so that it approaches the comically inscrutable, and the minimal doses of violence and Hitchcockian neuroses make this, as the phrase goes, fine family viewing--of what just happens to be a deathless and hyperkinetic masterwork of the talking cinema.",1370736000,,1423,5.273127753303965

113130,5,0790743213,"As the last collaboration between Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock, they came together to make the ultimate thriller in North by Northwest. Grant plays a common business man named Roger Thorndike who is framed as a killer in a very public place. All of the sudden he has become a fugitive on the run for a crime he never even committed. Along the way he meets a government agent (Eve Marie Sainte) while dodging the authorities. Trying to clear his name, Grant finds himself fleeing the actual killers. His adventures include a run-in with a crop dusting plane and eventually find him hanging for dear life.  However, he comes out on top in the end and he slowly falls in love too (of course). From the beginning when you see the opening credits and hear the score, you gear up for adventure and that is exactly what you get. It follows the wonderful tradition of Hitchcock films and it does not fail to entertain. Besides great locations, a memorable score, and interesting camera work, the story is wonderful.",1370044800,,1010,4.674157303370786

Cary Grant is mistaken for 'George Kaplan' and kidnapped by workers for spy James Mason. When Grant refuses to cooperate (he can't - knows nothing) they try to kill him and make it look like a drunken driving accident.

An actual and an attempted murder later, Grant ends up in Rapid City, South Dakota with Mason and government agent Eva Marie Saint, with whom he's fallen in love with. The movie ends with a chase scene on Mt. Rushmore, followed by the shot of a train speeding into a tunnel.

Cary Grant really took the roll of Roger Thornhill and made it what I would had imagined it in today's society if it would had been made by a wonderful director with a good cast and a wonderful script.  The acting was taken a step further by Grant and Saint.  They made this movie their own.  Love the cameo by Alfred!  I just hope they never remake this movie.

113144,5,0790743213,"Hands down on of Hitchcock's best and my favorite of his films. First let me say that this 50th anniversary looks AMAZING on blu-ray. I never would have guessed that a film this old could look this incredible!! It was literally like rediscovering an old favorite a film I have loves since I was a kid. The famous crop duster and Mount Rushmore scenes a breathtaking, Hitch himself would have been stunned I think with the depth of the visuals.

Now for those of you who have never seen this master piece (#40 on AFI's top 100 films list, and #4 among thrillers) then you need to make a point to see it, soon. A masterful use of Hitchcock's MacGuffin, or a device that drives the plot but either is never fully revealed or does not exist. Akin to the contents of the briefcase in Pulp Fiction or the ""Secret Plans""--but of what we are never told- in more films than can be named. I won't say more for the sake of those who have never seen the film but suffice to say that everything in this film is smartly and tightly done, from the performances, to the cinematography and as goes with out saying the direction of one of the, if not the greatest director Hollywood has ever seen. Do yourself a huge favor and don't miss out on this one, it should be on every bucket list.",1366848000,,1271,4.317991631799163

The storyline, cast, special effects, sets, and scenery are fine but I don't think the movie overall is quite as good as ""Vertigo.""  That film I regard as Hitchcock's masterpiece and it wouldn't be right to give ""North by Northwest"" the same rating.

As to the quality of the video and audio transfer, those are also topnotch in ""North by Northwest.""  The scene in the open prairie with a crop duster chasing Cary Grant has to be one of the most memorable and well-done special effects in cinematic history.  Never mind that it doesn't make a lot of sense to the plot to have such a deadly scene in the middle of nowhere.

Climbing around on facsimile faces of Mt. Rushmore is also very well done, but again implausible anyone could be allowed access.  As with other of Hitchcock's movies, we must learn to suspend logic and plausibility and just enjoy the ride.

He encounters a counterspy, Eve, played by Eva Maria Saint. Roger is chased from NY to Mount Rushmore trying to find the truth;  is he on the right side and who should he trust.

NORTH BY NORTHWEST is by far my favorite Hitchcock thriller. It's a genuine nail biter throughout, with several excellent action sequences, a wonderful cast, superb story and a climax that remains 50 years later one of the greatest of all time! This film belongs in all home video libraries.

SYNOPSIS--
Advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Grant) is mistaken for CIA agent George Kaplan by a gang of spies headed by the evil Phillip Vandamm (Mason). He's captured, almost killed and barely escapes. To clear himself of a murder charge, Thornhill tries to locate the real Kaplan, with the aid of beautiful Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). After just missing Kaplan in Chicago, the search continues. Thornhill has no idea of the many dangers ahead!

There are much worse movies, that is for sure.
This one did not age well though. LOTS of emphasis is put on what they considered ""clever"" dialog of the day I guess. It all gets kind of boring, amateurish, and long winded at times.
A Lot of the scenes are just kind of stupid and do not hold water by todays standards. Like sending a guy out to the middle of nowhere, and then trying to kill him with a crop duster.?
They could have just drove up and shut the Mother F'er.
It all gets kind of trite and ridiculous. Worth buying used for as cheap as you can find it. NOT one of Hitchcock's best.
Martin Landau and James Mason parts could have been played by first year drama students. What a waste of talent.

Hitchcock is at the top of his form here not only in direction, casting, and pacing, but also with his classic 'wrong man accused' motif, first seen in The 39 Steps.  Here it is played to perfection by Cary Grant, who is magnificent throughout as the man in a situation not of his making. Eva Marie Saint is also superb here; her repartee with Cary Grant comes off very polished and sophisticated, and her character's transformation through the movie is quite convincing.  James Mason too plays his archetypical villain character here with great aplomb and style.  Martin Landau also comes off very well as his particularly nasty henchman.

The concept that powers the whole bag is astonishingly simple, and once it's knocked out of the way in the first act, the picture is then perfectly happy to gradually up the stakes and riff on the premise for the rest of its allotted time. It's a testament to the creativity of the filmmakers that it still feels so fresh and untainted today, in the era of the derivative knock-off, with only a few dated automobiles and touches of public etiquette reminding us it's actually closing in on sixty years of age.

Roger O. Thornhill, an advertising executive, is mistaken for George Kaplan and is kidnapped by two men who take him to a house in Long Island to be interrogated by a man claiming to be Lester Townsend, when he is actually a foreign spy Phillip Vandamm. Roger keeps telling him that he has the wrong person, but Vandamm doesn't believe him and order his men to get rid of Roger. They force him to drink bourbon and put him behind the wheel of a car. Then the men chase after him, hoping that Roger will crash the car, but to their surprise, he gets away.

Knowing that he had no prove of what had happened, Roger decides to stop Vandamm from doing whatever he has planned to do. Roger had overheard that Vandamm was going to Chicago, so he hops on a train where he meets a lovely young woman, Eve Kendal, who turns out to be Vandamm's girlfriend.

After getting off the train, Roger needs to travel by bus, but he first has to wait for one to appear along a countryside road. That's when the famous crop-duster scene occurs; diving down toward the very road Roger is on. It seems that no matter where he goes there are people after him.

This thrilling adventure has lots of action, romance, the beautiful blonde (Eve Marie Saint), and lots of humor. I always remember Thornhill (Grant) telling the thugs who leave him at the library ""I'll catch on my reading."" Thornhill's relationship with his mother (played by Jesse Royce Landis) is quite amusing. There's a scene at the elevator that involves Thornhill, his mother, and the two hired assassins pursuing Thornhill that is quite hilarious and a stroke of genius. And there is one piece of dialogue that i simply can't forget:

Thornhill: Tell me, why are you so good to me?
Eve: Shall I climb up and tell you why?

And the way Eve Marie says this strikes a chord in me. She's ""a looker"" and pretty sensuous. I also fell in lover with her. In addition, Hermann's score accompanies the viewer throughout the film, adding tension to each scene. Interestingly enough, the ending scene does remind you of the typical conclusion of a James Bond film (this franchise hadn't started yet) although it is done in a very creative manner.

I don't think that Hitchcock meant this film to be taken seriously. My impression is that he was aiming at sheer fun, and I simply followed, or have followed several times already, Cary Grant on the run, and all the twists and turns he goes through (I've seen this at least six times already). I suspended my disbelief in the plausibility of its events and enjoyed it.",1342742400,,2219,4.684615384615385

113428,5,0790743213,"Roger O. Thornhill is a busy New York City advertising executive who loves his mother and loves his women. He's having an after-work drink with three buddies when he's abducted at gunpoint. They take him to a mansion in the country, and their boss, Lester Townsend, scrutinizes his captive: ""Not what I expected. A little taller. A little more polished than the others.""

Thornhill replies, ""Not that I mind a slight case of abduction now and then, but I have tickets to the theater this evening. To a show I was looking forward to!""  And that sets the pace for the whole movie. Politely sinister. Classy humor. Thornhill is played with panache and great comic touch by Cary Grant. Townsend is played with sly menace by James Mason. The lovely Eva Marie Saint doesn't even appear in the 1st half of the movie, then her Eve Kendall takes over the screen and Thornhill's heart - but it costs her.

""North by Northwest"" has a couple of the most recognized and parodied scenes in films. The cropduster chasing Cary Grant in the middle of nowhere never loses its fear factor. And who can forget Roger Thornhill and Eve Kendall climbing down Mt. Rushmore?

I'm writing this review to let you know that the extras on the 50th Anniversary Edition, 2 DVD's, are simply excellent

1.  ""Cary Grant: A Class Apart"". First airing in 2004, this is an 87 minute episode of PBS's ""American Masters"" TV series. It is narrated by Helen Mirren and Jeremy Northam, with many movie clips and contributing commenters. Cary Grant was in 72 films, including 4 directed by Alfred Hitchcock. He ended his film career voluntarily, quitting while he was at the top. He passed away in 1986 of a stroke. Look at this list of interviewees for this special! I found this extra in-depth and interesting.
- Barbara Grant, his wife from 1981-1986
- Jeanine Basinger, film historian
- Roderick Mann, friend
- Nancy Nelson, author of ""Evenings with Cary Grant""
- Betsy Drake, actor, his wife from 1949-1962 and an outspoken pistol!
- Elvis Mitchell, film critic for the ""New York Times""
- Peter Bogdanovich, director (he knew Hitchcock and Grant personally, and he participates on the movie commentary track for the DVD Collector's Edition of ""To Catch a Thief"")
- Martin Landau, actor, who plays James Mason's secretary, Leonard, in ""North by Northwest""
- James Harvey, film historian
- Ralph Bellamy, actor, from a 1988 interview (he's not in this film)
- Todd McCarthy, author ""Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood""
- David Denby, film critic for ""The New Yorker""
- Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., actor, from a 1988 interview
- Howard Hawks, director, from 1967 interview. He directed Grant in ""His Girl Friday"" (1940) and ""Bringing Up Baby"" (1938)
- Dina Merrill, actor
- Jill St. John, actor
- Sidney Sheldon, writer
- Ralph Laren, designer, friend
- Eva Marie Saint, actor
- Mel Shavelson, director, he directed Grant in ""Houseboat"" (1958)
- Deborah Kerr, actor, from 1988 interview
- Ernest Lehman, screenwriter for ""North by Northwest""
- Alfred Hitchcock, director, from 1966 interview
- Stanley Donen, directed Grant in ""Charade"" (1963, with Audrey Hepburn)
- George Kennedy, actor, from 2003 interview
- Samantha Eggar, actor
- and, last but not least, Cary Grant, in that they read excerpts from a series of autobiographical essays that were published in 1963. Grant gave few interviews, but he did open up in these essays.

2.  ""The Master's Touch: Hitchcock's Signature Style"". This is a 57 minute documentary from 2009. This was also fascinating to watch. It starts with Alfred himself saying, ""It may be that I was born with the sense of drama""!
  A little bit of everything is covered in this extra, from costumes to music, to Hitchcock's preference for cool blonde leading ladies. Most of the comments, however, and not unexpectedly, have to do with his direction. How he made the angles, light, composition, point of view and camera tell the story and paint the mood. An impressive list of directors talk about Hitchcock's genius:
- Francis Lawrence, director of ""I Am Legend"" and ""Constantine""
- William Friedkin, director of ""The Exorcist"" and ""The French Connection""
- Guillermo del Toro, director of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""Hellboy""
- John Carpenter, director of ""Halloween"" and ""Escape From New York""
- Richard Loncraine, director of ""Firewall""
- Martin Scorsese, director of ""Goodfellas""
- Curtis Hanson, director of ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle""
- Joe Carnahan, director of ""Smokin' Aces""

3.  ""The Making of North by Northwest"", hosted by Eva Marie Saint. Interesting stories are told by several people, including Pat Hitchcock, the director's daughter, and Ernest Lehman, writer for ""North by Northwest"". Lehman talks about the genesis of the plot, when Hitchcock tells him: ""I've always wanted to do a chase across the faces of Mount Rushmore.""

4.  ""North by Northwest: One for the Ages"", a short. This looks like it is made up of unused material from extra #2, ""The Master's Touch"". Also interesting.

113429,4,0790743213,"Cary Grant certainly was sexy when he was young! Actually, as I recall he was also pretty sexy when he got old, too . . .

This is one of Hitchcock's best films. Grant plays a playboy advertising executive who gets mistaken for a spy. James Mason plays a real spy. Eva Marie Saint plays a counterspy. And you will recognize a lot of other faces, too. It all starts when Grant is kidnapped by the ""other side"" (presumably communist) spies because they think he is Mr. Kaplan, the spy who is trailing them. He's not, but they don't believe him. They pour a whole bottle of bourbon into him and put him behind the wheel of a ""stolen"" sports car, to go off a cliff. But he doesn't go off the cliff, drunk as he is. Instead, he does one of the best chase down a mountain road scenes I have ever seen.

The spy who kidnapped him used someone else's house and name, and so when Grant goes to the house to try to clear himself of the DUI and the grand theft auto, he encounters a woman who is supposedly the wife of the man who kidnapped him the night before, who is addressing the United Nations general assembly. He goes to the UN, and has the guy paged, but it's not the same guy. It's the real owner of the house. So who were all those other people at the party where he was shanghaied? As he is talking to the owner of the house to try to explain what was going on there while he was in New York, someone throws a knife into the back of the man, and Grant, like an idiot, grabs the knife to pull it out. Of course, this puts his fingerprints all over the knife, and he runs.

Oh, that's very much only the beginning. There are some marvelously complex plot developments, culminating in one of the most intriguing scenes in movie history, where several people climb down (and fall from) the giant heads of Mount Rushmore. This is a real classic of the unexpected twist and twist again.",1337126400,,1881,4.219444444444444

In addition to being a classic thriller, this movie has an outstanding music score. In every way it is one of the best movies ever made. If you haven't yet seen it, you should.

At the end of his career Grant received an Academy Award for lifetime achievement, but it amazes me that he was nominated only once for a best actor Academy Award when year after year he gave outstanding performances of various kinds which merited recognition. In my opinion, Cary Grant was the best performer of the Golden age of Hollywood -- as he shows again in this all time classic.",1331596800,,793,4.506944444444445

113435,4,0790743213,"Made 3 years before James Bond made spy movies extremely popular, North by Northwest sometimes comes across as a bit of a caper instead of something more serious, but it has enough going on to keep you interested, even over 136 minutes, a running time few Bond films have exceeded.

Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, an NY adman who lives a fast and loose lifestyle. When he's mistaken for an enigmatic spy called George Kaplan his is hurled into a partially confusing plot involving cold war traitors, secret agents and double agents. Thornhill travels up and down and across the country trying to outwit his pursuers and find out what the hell is going on, all while romancing Eva Marie Saint, with Bernard Herrmann boisterous score propelling him along.

It's another one of Hitchcock's 'wrong man' thrillers, and probably the best (however, I do rate Saboteur highly). But it IS still a bit overrated. It's shot very well, in many different locations, and there's little, if anything, to dislike about it. But like many early Bond movies there are many scenes where you can easily tell that the characters are just walking on a treadmill with a rear-projection behind them instead of physically being in actual locations. It doesn't spoil anything, though it is always noticeable.

The Blu Ray looks absolutely stunning in 1.78:1 1080p, with hardly a scratch or a speck of dust to mar the presentation. Warner did an amazing job restoring this film, which looks just as good, if not better, than many modern films on the format. The sound Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and there are numerous extras. Definitely worth getting.",1330819200,3,1613,4.87956204379562

Too bad regular TV with so much promise when it came out has ended in reality shows and other stupid games. All that's left is Public tv with their countless cooking shows and antique road shows. I miss the hosts and old movies where I watched this movie first with my Mom.

113475,1,0790743213,"Is this movie exciting? Yes. But if you, like my wife and I, like to watch old Hitchcock movies because they are usually clean and wholesome, this film will very much disappoint you because of one scene. Following such strained script lines that you will want to cringe, which no woman in her right mind would ever utter, the primary female character brazenly states lustful intentions for a total stranger, whom she obviously knows is wanted by the police. Next, the two hop in bed together. Though nothing is graphically shown, it is quite obvious what has happened. She does it to seduce him as a spy, and to neatly arrange his death, and he willingly accepts like a dumb animal being led to the slaughter.  He narrowly escapes death as a result, bringing to my mind the words of wise old King Solomon:

""Do not lust in your heart after her beauty
or let her captivate you with her eyes,
for the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread,
and the adulteress preys upon your very life.
Can a man scoop fire into his lap
without his clothes being burned?
Can a man walk on hot coals
without his feet being scorched?""

Perhaps that embarrassing scene was an effort on the part of Hitchcock to appear as  part of the trendy new sexual revolution. I am glad that most of his films are not like that! 4 points for an otherwise exciting and well crafted film. Three points off for the unrealistic dialogue of that very strained scene, which for us, ruined what would have otherwise been a good movie.",1330819200,6,1496,4.488970588235294

I had not seen this in years, and I had forgotten most of the plot. But seeing it again I could not but wonder how well this story is told.  Hitchcock is a master storyteller.  Even my 8-year old understood and enjoyed the ""plot"" and the ""mix-up"".  That aside, the blu-ray presents a 16:9 image (1.78:1) of great clarity, with a wonderful color palette, and clear sound.  The ""restoration"" (it is a 50-year old movie) is of exceptional quality.  And the ""digibook"" art work is also quite a nice touch.

It's a genuine nail biter throughout, with several excellent action sequences, a wonderful cast, superb story and a climax that remains 50 years later one of the greatest of all time! This film belongs in all home video libraries.

SYNOPSIS--
Advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Grant) is mistaken for CIA agent George Kaplan by a gang of spies headed by the evil Phillip Vandamm (Mason). He's captured, almost killed and barely escapes. To clear himself of a murder charge, Thornhill tries to locate the real Kaplan, with the aid of beautiful Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). After just missing Kaplan in Chicago, the search continues. Thornhill has no idea of the many dangers ahead!

(8.4)  North by Northwest (1959) - Cary Grant/Eva Marie Saint/James Mason/Jessie Royce Landis/Leo G. Carroll/Josephine Hutchinson/Philip Ober/Martin Landau/Edward Platt (uncredited: Stanley Adams/Ned Glass/Tom Greenway)",1327968000,,1561,7.370967741935484
113482,5,0790743213,"This new 50th anniversary restoration on blu-ray is spectacular.

One of the disadvantages of living with a beloved movie for 4 decades, in the movie theater and on home video, is that it becomes so familiar that you know everything by heart and anticipate every next step. The script is brilliant, so, like most Hitchcock, it is enjoyable to watch repeatedly, even if familiar with the story. The great thing with Hitchcock is, that the suspense and excitement of the story have nothing to do with the revelation of a twist.

Were I new to this film, I would be ecstatic with the previous DVD, which remains excellent.

But such is the new clarity in this new restoration, that to me it was  like seeing a  different film, because I saw so many details that I had overlooked before, as in the interior of the dining car, or the lobby of the Plaza Hotel. It was, as if I were transported into the 1950s, being present in the very locations, not just watching them in a film. Textures become tactile, I can feel the cold of the steel fixtures in the dining car, the warmth of velvet, the surface of the rose patterned taffeta dress. For the first time, the metallic telephones at the lobby of the Plaza Hotel felt appropriately rich, crafted of real metal, befitting the exclusive surroundings. Before I always thought they looked out of place, common plastic phones covered with cheap metallic paint. It makes much more sense now.

This newfound immediacy went so far, that sometimes I had the feeling of being on the set while this movie was being filmed. Being present with the actors. However I didn't find it distracting, but let me enjoy the movie in a new dimension.

In this (and only this) film, Eva Marie Saint always reminded me of a stunningly beautiful pure-bred creature,  desireable and expensive,  and too synthetic to be a real woman, which I'm sure was intended by the director and appropriate to the story. Actually that look is not unlike Kim Kardashian's look today, a beautiful, perfect but synthetic mask.

In this new 50th anniversary restoration, the character Eva Marie Saint plays is suddenly a woman of flesh and blood. The  mask of  concealer makeup which Hitchcock placed over her face is still extreme, but no longer opaque enough to cover the freshness and human warmth, sensitivity and  vulnerability  I normally connect this favorite actress with. It is a revelation to now be able to see the subtle emotions in her face, like in the scene when she sends Cary Grant to the his doom in the crop fields. Her emotional conflict is very moving.

The love scene in the train compartment is stylized as ever; they kiss, but their embrace feels synthetic, with her barely touching his neck and his hands strangely hovering behind her hair, not lovingly, nor careful of messing up her superb hair (which gets messed up nonetheless by the wall), but as if something unappealing were back there. Her featherlight hesitant  tenderness is appropriate to the story --- but his hand's gestures have always irritated me. I'm sure both actors were following Hitchock's exact directions. And maybe it was Cary Grant's own style of touching his partner during romantic moments, because I've seen him do it in other films as well.

However, this new transfer with its focus on light and dark, makes this love scene much more intimate, by partially obscuring graphic details, which the previous transfer offered --- dvdbeaver.com (*) link below)  did  a comparison of the previous dvd with the blu-ray, and in the screenshot of this love scene,  you can see every detail in Cary Grant's hair on the dvd, whereas the blu-ray bathes it in shadow. I'm not sure why this happened, and I read that some reviewers were bothered by the darker image because it dampens the romantic mood. I like the new transfer better, because it makes the scene more convincing and natural, and appropriately ominous.

In any case, the sublime music which underscores this scene is the loveliest music I've ever heard in any film, and what the lovers avoid doing, the music does for them: it touches and embraces them (and us) with supreme tenderness and longing.

I very much recommend you watch this classic movie in this stunning new restauration; it's likely you will experience it anew, as I did.

My guess is, the new DVD edition of this 50th anniversary restoration will also be excellent, giving similar improvements over the previous DVD. I think the revelation lies in the restauration itself.

The muted color palate, which I always wondered about when seeing this film on video, is as detailed and accurate as has ever been reproduced in a video transfer.  The biggest disappointment for me, as a film student, was the Ernest Lehman commentary.  Granted he did write North by Northwest and its very valuable to have his commentary. But he offers little or no insight into the making of the film.  He tends to repeat himself and talks extensively about the working relationship between himself and Hitchcock, but his observations about the film are for the most part obvious plot points that anyone can glean simply from viewing the picture.

The loudness setting on my Denon AV receiver is normally set at -17 DB, but for this movie I had to crank up the loudness to ZERO DB in order to hear properly. After the movie when I go to the extra features, the sound level comes on blasting and I had to scramble to lower the volume.

I will not take away any stars from my review and hope others will not get their ear drums blasted like I did. So remember to turn the volume back down immediately after the movie.",1322697600,,635,4.0

The video quality was great.  I didn't notice any grain.  I give it a 9.2 on a 10.0 scale.  The Dolbe TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack was good.  There wasn't a whole lot of surround sound, but the airplane scene did have good surround, with sub-woofer bass during the crash.

The aspect ratio was a disappointing 1.85:1, which filled my LCD screen.  I wish it was 2.4:1.

113517,5,0790743213,"Without a shadow of a doubt ""North by Northwest"" is the most interesting film I have ever tried to figure out.

After viewing this film thirty or thirty-five times, I am astounded that the story line and action sequences even work at all, but they do. So many things come together in an irrational way, yet are so believable.

The story is about a small piece of microfilm that the audience is completely unaware of until the last five minutes of the film. However, they are all after it, and meanwhile, the bad guys have mistaken Roger O. Thornhill, played by Cary Grant as a government man out to get them. Determined to straighten out the entire mess, Thornhill follows the trail of the man he is mistaken for, without realizing this man does not even exist. He meets a beautiful but mysterious woman played by Eva Marie Saint, gets run down by a low flying crop dusting airplane, and is arrested for disrupting an auction where the bad guys are gathered and bidding on a vase.

Top shelf actors, Alfred Hitchcock in his prime, and the DRIVING music of Bernard Hermann combine with this mysterious story line that could have been thrown together by no one but Alfred Hitchcock. ""Why can't I craft something like this? It's so simple."" But as of yet, I really do not understand exactly what makes it so-o-o entertaining?""

This film represents the magic of Hollywood and of the craft and art of film making.

This two disc set belongs in every DVD collection. Buy it, watch it over and over, study the simplicity and ask the question yourself, ""What makes it work?""

I WILL FOREVER MISS ALFRED HITCHCOCK!",1320883200,3,1606,4.617543859649123
113538,4,0790743213,A little bit of railroad history was cut from the movie in the BluRay release. I do not know why such a brief scene was deleted except the editor of the BluRay thought something was amiss and jarring. The New York Central 20th Century Limited had an agreement with the Santa Fe Super Chief to attach a Pullman first class sleeper car from the arriving Super Chief in Chicago and take it in to New York City. Thus the passengers on the Super Chief did not need to transfer with their luggage from Dearborn Station to LaSalle Street Station. The whole car was switched over to the 20th Century. The reverse was true for Super Chief through passengers from NYC to L.A. In the the newly released BluRay version a brief scene which showed the silver Santa Fe car in the middle of the NY Central 20th Century Limited gray consist exiting a tunnel in New York City heading north was deleted. A bit of the original was therefore cut.,1318636800,10,925,4.447058823529412
113539,5,0790743213,"Hitchock's ultimate Hitchcock film. Too often is the English director Alfred Hitchcock compared to French director Henri Clouzot. This one will remind you that they lived in very different worlds. ""North by Northwest"" might be the wildest, biggest, and most American film Hitchcock ever did. Carey Grant's undeniable snark and charm elevate the story and heighten the suspense. James Mason's oiliness is perfect and Eva Marie Saint is lovely and strong as the woman you're never sure you can trust. Then there's young Martin Landau's piercing blue eyes. In many ways ""North by Northwest"" is more of a James Bond action flick than a classic Hitchcock mystery/suspense. And it might be better at being a Bond film than most Bond films. The DVD restores the picture and all that, but it also includes some very nice documentaries and making-of features (and Eva Marie Saint hosts). It's an economical single disc that measures up without busting your wallet.",1318377600,,955,5.089171974522293
113540,5,0790743213,"""North by Northwest"" (1959) is one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest films, and I think it's his most sophisticated, sharp, classy thriller. It's actually very light and comedic, not dark and serious, which makes it very entertaining. It's considered the fourth most thrilling film of all time on AFI's ""100 Years...100 Movies"" list, and it very much deserves it.
  The film is about a Madison Avenue advertising executive named Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) who gets mistaken for being a man named George Kaplan, and after that suddenly gets caught up in a web of murder, abduction, and romance, which takes him to the United Nations (where Hitch wasn't supposed to film in but snuck a camera in to film) to Chicago to a countryside in a famous sequence where Cary Grant gets attacked by a cropduster all the way to Mount Rushmore, with the suspensful and classic ending. James Mason perfectly plays the villain, Philip Vandamm. Eva Marie Saint plays the typical Hitchcock blonde, Eve Kendall, a counterspy who falls in love with Roger, and Jessie Royce Landis plays Roger's mother, who just happened to be the same age as Cary Grant.
  This has to be Hitch's most entertaining film with top-notch acting from Cary Crant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Martin Landau, and Leo G. Carroll. It also has a fast pace, great Hitchcockian humor, an amazing plot, wonderful sets, and witty dialouge.
  The special features here are absolutely incredible. The Disc 1 has a commentary by screenwriter, Ernest Lehman and a music only audio track. The Disc 2 is special features galore. It comes with a 1 1/2 hour documentary ""Cary Grant: A Class Apart"", which chronicles Cary Grant's life and legendary film career, all the way to his death. It shows a lot of film clips all the way from ""She Done Him Wrong"" to ""Walk, Don't Run"". It's phenomenal. ""The Master's Touch: Hitchcock's Signature Style"" is an interesting hour long documentary about Hitch's legendary filming style, showing film clips from different films like ""Dial M for Murder"", ""Strangers on a Train"", and ""North by Northwest"". The other 2 special features are about the making of the film: ""North by Northwest: One for the Ages"" and ""Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North by Northwest. The rest are production photos and theatrical trailers, which are pretty fun to see.
  ""North by Northwest"" is no doubt one of Hitch's best films, and some even consider it his best. It definitely is one of my favorites. It has everything that a Hitchcock film should have: suspense, humor, sharp acting/actors, witty dialouge, and a classic MacGuffin.

In fact, I was surprised at how blatantly sexy and forward Eva Marie Saint's character was ... this is after all 1959, deep in the Eisenhower erea.

Sure, there's no blood and gore and no gratuitous sex, but with Hithcock's mastery of the camera, the undercurrents in the dialogue, and the twists and turns in the plot, who needs them?

The is a review of the single disc edition 0-7907-9993-6.  My copy played fine with no problems with audio or video.
The most outrageous scene, of course, involved the now famous crop duster.  How one could get a hold of an antique plane with a working machine gun is beyond me, but nothing, apparently, was impossible with the evil Red Menace. Don't get me wrong.  It was a great scene, except for the fakey crash. However, it would have been easier to have stepped from the cornfield with a 12 gauge Winchester 1897 and done the job expeditiously. The movie would have been shorter though.
If you do not know the plot, read Wikipedia.  The title was a puzzler, either from Shakespeare or Northwest Airlines, or, as suggested, nobody thought up a better title. The only thing that really bothered me was the old coot ""making love"" to a girl young enough to be his granddaughter.  Then, there is Hitchcock's final impudent scene.

The dialogue is witty and laced with mildly risque double entendres.  Classic Hitchcock set pieces (the crop duster sequence, the climb on Mt. Rushmore) add to the genuine suspense of the film.

113570,5,0790743213,"This is one of my all-time favorites. This is one of the best movies that actually defined the whole ""thriller"" genre: an innocent layperson gets sucked into a plot and has difficulty in understanding what's happening to him. Cary Grant, playing a smug Madison Avenue ad executive, is swept into an international intrigue when he is mistaken for George Kaplan, a spy who is chased by the bad guys.

The film is full of iconic images like the dust-cropper scene or the final battle on Mount Rushmore. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the film has its number of flaws -- the most famous being a kid in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria closing his ears before a gun is fired :-) However, the narrative thread is so strong, the plot and the characters sweep us along while we suspend all judgement and enjoy the ride.

Cary Grant offers one of his top-notch performances as a handsome leading man on the run who always has time for a wisecrack or two. A MUST see film for movie fans of all ages. Highly recommended.

113577,5,0790743213,"I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...

I would rank North By Northwest (1959) as one of the great movies from Alfred Hitchcock's prime, which, in my opinion, was the period from 1951-1964.  This movie was sandwiched between two of his greatest movies, Vertigo (1958) and Psycho (1960).  Basically the plot involves an innocent man who is chased from New York to Chicago to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota by agents who want to stop the man's interference in their plans to smuggle microfilm that contains government secrets.  It's a case of mistaken identity.  He's abducted, chased by these agents, and framed for murder.  Cary Grant gives a great performance in the role of Roger Thornhill, the innocent man being mistaken for somebody else.  James Mason plays the villain Phillip Vandamm, one of the agents in pursuit of Thornhill.  Mason was always great playing villains (think Salem's Lot 1979).

Hitchcock always liked to use good looking blonde women in his movies.  Think of Grace Kelly, Kim Novak, 'Tippi' Hedren, etc.  Eva Marie Saint fits this mold perfectly.  Her acting and screen presence are good in the role of Eve Kendall, a counterspy who is working with the agents, but assists Thornhill by hiding him in her cabin on a train heading for Chicago.  That's all I want to say.  Watch to find out what happens.

The opening credit sequence is a classic.  The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is excellent and matches up well with the action on the screen.  The movie has a lot of action.  Some of the scenes have become iconic through the years.  The movie of course has a lot of suspense (as you would expect from Hitchcock).  The DVD's clarity is excellent.  Disc 2 contains over three hours of extras, including documentaries on Cary Grant, Alfred Hitchcock's style of movie making and directing, the movie's iconic status, and the making of the movie.

Overall, this is one of the best Hitchcock movies ever and I highly recommend it.",1300492800,,1965,4.785714285714286

RoT, the normal man played by Cary Grant, is one of Hitch's greatest creations.  He is naive about the situation he has fallen into, but turns out to be resourceful and intelligent enough to stay alive through the most daunting of threats.  In the beginning, his skeptical mother is there making sarcastic comments about his explanations with a low key matronly scorn.  But RoT is also full of dark humor, even in the ruses he employs to escape or save his skin.  The disorderly scene in the auction house, for example, is absolutely classic and we laugh at it every time.  Grant's timing is perfect.  Then, when he buys in to what is happening, he takes the initiative with admirable cunning.  Even the love scenes and the exquisite chemistry between Grant and Eva Marie Saint are believable.  The other actors, such as Landau, are first rate.

Though produced at a more innocent time when the CIA was generally in a more positive light than it is today, Hitch's touch makes it instantly suspect to the point that the viewer will question its competence and motives.  In a way, the spy they are chasing is more sympathetic, and certainly has more style.

He gets the lion's share of the credit for this well-crafted classic but you also have to give credit to Ernest Lehman, the screenwriter. Anybody ever read what William Goldman said about this movie in ""Which Lie Did I Tell?""? He was very complimentary of the screenplay, pointing out that about a dozen plot points are all tied up in the last minute or so of the film.
  And how can you go wrong with Cary Grant? The great thing about Grant was that unlike most freakishly beautiful movie stars, he always came across as self-deprecating & not especially impressed with his own good looks. I think that's what made him so endearing. Never more so than in this masterpiece.",1285804800,2,735,4.595419847328245

I'll focus more on the picture quality of the Blu-ray for those trying to decide whether or not it is worth the upgrade from the DVD. The answer is YES. The restoration done for this film reportedly cost in excess of 1 million dollars, and it shows. The picture is flawless, and rivals even newer movies. I've seen movies released this year that don't have a gorgeous transfer like this. You'll probably have to turn your volume up a little higher than normal to find the right volume, but the sound is also excellent.

North by Northwest is a cinematic masterpiece, and I'm thrilled to see it get the treatment it deserves on Blu-Ray. A gorgeous transfer that is well worth the upgrade from DVD. No collection should be without this movie!",1284422400,7,978,4.4581005586592175

But I do believe that I've come to consider it my favorite, after many viewings going back almost three decades. If I had to recommend one Hitchcock film to some poor unfortunate that had never been privledged to see one, this would be it.

Some complain that it doesn't make much logical sense,and I won't gainsay that. I do say that most people that watch it end up not caring a jot. It moves with breakneck pace from the first few seconds and never slows down. Along the way you get action,suspense,mystery,humor,romance,and some unforgetable dialogue. It's almost worth the purchase price just to listen as two of the greatest voices in movies history,Cary Grant and James Mason, share the screen. Sheer magic.

As far as the extras go I think as with the film itself you are getting the appropriate bang for your buck. There are two features on the movie itself and one each on Cary Grant and Hitchcock.

Even though it was made back in 1959, it still has high tension all over it even today. It's an interesting premise: a man is wrongfully accused and is being pursued all around the country. It might be simple enough, but it's much more complicated than it seems. Here, we get a romantic subplot, a government conspiracy, several chase sequences, clever dialogue, perfectly-timed humor, brilliant performances by Cary Grant & Eva Maria Saint, etc. Basically, you get a whole lot from this film, but it's not overstuffed. Hitchcock, one of the finest directors in the 20th Century, has given us a marvel. It's a definite classic among top thrillers.

113688,5,0790743213,"No Blu-Ray collection is complete without a well-transfered vintage movie, and I'm happy to say that Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 masterpiece 'North by Northwest' is a worthy choice for that movie.

The film itself needs no introduction.  It's a classic, pure and simple.  From the wonderful performances by Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint to the jaw-dropping Mount Rushmore and (my personal favorite) crop duster sequences, 'North by Northwest' is a high-caliber suspense film, through and through.

One aspect that sets it apart from many other movies of its day is the test of time.  Even though it hit movie theaters more than 50 years ago, the action and humor in 'North by Northwest' have aged very well.  I still laugh out loud when I watch it, and the suspense is still just as nail-biting.

As for the Blu-Ray transfer, I don't think we could've asked for a better one.  As far as I'm concerned, the purpose behind the Blu-Ray format is to make the home viewing experience as close to the theatrical experience as possible.  This beautifully-produced Blu-Ray does just that.  The incredibly sharp picture effectively transports the viewer back in time to a theater seat in 1959, right down to the old-school film grain.

The special features here are very impressive, including a standout documentary hosted by Eva Marie Saint.  If you appreciate extras, you won't be disappointed.  My favorite, for some reason, is the featurette titled ""A Guided Tour with Alfred Hitchcock.""  It's a genuinely funny and witty look at the movie, and shouldn't be missed.

Additionally, the Blu-Ray comes packaged with a 44-page Digibook, which is a very appreciated addition.  It includes facts about the production as well as profiles of the actors.  Very cool packaging.

Classic movies like this are a treat to behold on the Blu-Ray format.  'North by Northwest' is no exception.  If you're looking for a wonderful piece of cinematic history that showcases the format beautifully, then look no further than 'North by Northwest.'  It's absolutely a must-buy.",1271116800,37,2047,5.050746268656717

113691,5,0790743213,"This is probably in my top 3 for Hitchcock films for many reasons. The best that I can think if is that it is perhaps the best example of cinematic drama. For those not familiar with the plot, the story is a gripping mistaken-identity thriller: advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken as a government agent by the sinister Philip Vandamm (the ever-amazing James Mason). Vandamm is convinced Thornhill is after him, and tries to dispose of the strawman. Thornill eventually finds himself at the center of a complicated espionage plot which takes him across the country, ending with a spectacular climax atop the Mt. Rushmore.

What makes this film nearly perfect for me is the way it's paced. It's a study in economy, since we're told very little at the beginning (parallel to Thornhill's ignorance), and more is revealed slowly over time. Hitchcock and screenwriter Ernst Lehman weave a carefully crafted tale, and Hitch's fluid direction is superb as Thornhill is placed in increasingly dangerous situations. Punctuating this danger is Bernard Hermann's tense and frightful score, and the blu-ray audio mix does it justice.

The film may very well be Grant's best performance -- certainly his best in a Hitchcock film (his 3rd or 4th collaboration w/ Hitchcock, I believe.) He is his rakish, humorous self, but in N/NW he displays a certain physicality (Grant was a circus performer before becoming an actor) that makes him somewhat of an action hero. (Grant also has the greatest business suit of all time, which somehow survives all his encounters with little more than a dusty lapel.)

I appreciated how well the film was transferred to blu-ray, with very rich colors, nice deep blacks and sharp images. Some flaws are to be expected since the film is over 50 years old. My only complaint is the cardboard keep-case -- I really wish studios would dispense with ""fancy"" cases and just put use good old plastic snap cases instead. The supplements seem fairly well rounded, but are in standard def. I'm looking forward to hearing the commentary by Lehmann, although I wish there were more commentary tracks available, perhaps from a learned critic such as Roger Ebert. (Ebert's commentary on ""Citizen Kane"", for instance, is excellent.)

In all, this is an exceptional classic film that deserves to be in any collection, and now in a blu-ray format that doesn't disappoint.",1267228800,5,2397,5.015075376884422

113693,5,0790743213,"With a classy Bernard Hermann score, Hitchcock lets us in on the story of an advertising exec, Mr. Thornhill, who likes his job, considering advertising as exaggerating the facts for the public.

(Hitch makes one of his famous on screen appearances, and doesn't quite make the bus!)

It's fun, though a bit unrealistic, that an advertising man who was just kidnapped would then follow up on the guys who tried to kidnap him, investigate the hotel room of the ""real"" Kaplan and go through these adventures. But that's fine, it's still a lot of fun.

Each scene has him take a step closer to finding out more about the kidnappers, narrow escapes, chase scenes and thrilling near-misses.

The cinematography is superb. The 30th floor view as Thornhill runs out -- the unusual perspective shots, the mistaken identifies and mistaken situations -- the logical illogic, the puzzles and the plots and plans -- All doves together in a crescendo of simple if deadly delights for the viewer.

But not for Thornhill.

[Some minor plot reveals here]

A blonde on the train (but who is she, really?) a little romance & comedy adds to the grim specter of a very long jail sentence or the bad spies rub him out!

Best scenes of course include:

The biplane scene that sprays bullets rather than insecticide on our poor Mr. Thornhill.

The Mt. Rushmore scene that has lots of near misses and very tall heights to climb and nearly be killed by, especially with Martin Landau chasing you down!

There's a double-cross, there's James Mason (as actually the evil spy Van Damme), lots of near misses -- I keep saying that but it's true. The film is full of near misses!

113696,5,0790743213,"People. This will be my 200th review. You would think it a cause for celebration, however, things are not always what they seem to be. And do remember this because it is a motif of this selection, which we will discuss later. Anyway, after a little over 4 years, I find myself struggling to be upwardly mobile in rank. I was just about to give up and work towards last place when I met this man who said he had a way to ""fix"" the system (as if this system hasn't been ""fixed"" enough). He said ""Don't you worry Metamorpho, you will be in first place within a month"". Well people, your Metamorpho wasn't born yesterday, but desperation makes you do strange things (like believe a total stranger). So, it was arranged to meet him in a field in the midwest whereby he will give me the total success (I deserve so much) amongst my peers.

Well I took a bus to meet him in some barren field. Nobody was around. He did say 2 o'clock, didn't he? Then, all of a sudden, I saw a crop duster appear out of the horizon. But, instead of stopping, it came right at me, diving at me, almost sawing off my Seers cap! It circled around and started to spray negative vote dust at your poor Metamorpho. I had to run, just like Cary Grant in....oh, what's that movie's name? Luckily, I threw a pebble into the engine motor, which crashed the plane. And, I was able to make my escape in a checkered cab I had arranged to meet me there. Very upsetting. So I made my way back to Chicago and stayed in George Kaplan's hotel room. Never met the man, but I pretended I was him since I had no money. So, I relaxed with a bubble bath and my trusty rubber duck. That guy in the crop duster must have been a quack! My rubber duck agreed.

I finally emerged to check the in-room bar, pour myself a brandy, and recline on the king sized bed with my laptop to bring you, yet, another fine review from the feathered pen of Metamorpho! I know my fan base will be elated. Others will still need to buy tickets to my lectures. Do not worry. Special discount rates will apply. But enough of this - you did tune in to hear about this movie- didn't you?

This is one of my all-time favorites. The genius of Hitchcock was never more in ample supply. Intiguing, engaging, the master gives you a ride you'll want to revisit time and time again. All the elements of suspense are present. The good guys, the bad guys, and the femme fatale who connects the dots, or possibly is the puzzle once removed from the puzzle. Knowing Hitchcock, it will all be perceived in his own good time.

Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue executive who is accustomed to a finer reality in life. Inavertently, he is mistaken for someone else. A spy whom certain other spys are after. From there, all sorts of devious things begin to happen. They attempt to murder him, frame him for murder, and the police, as well as the spys chase him from state to state. From that point on it is a roller coaster of events that get him into even deeper hot water. Within this scenario, Hitchcock tears down the curtain sheltering American complacency, or human complacency as it were. Like Alice, Roger Thornhill is exposed to the other side of the mirror, and this ain't no wonderland folks.

Hithcock keeps the action moving. And, that is one of the very things I like about this movie. There is always some new aspect and new reaction contributing to the journey. Cary (Roger Thornhill) is like a deer in headlights, having to adjust his position for every new nuance that comes up. Eva Marie Saint (who plays Eve Kendall) the elusive, but soon to be love interest of Roger Thornhill, is sheer perfection. Spy, double spy, or lover? The woven tapestry Hitchcock weaves is very dense indeed. It's akin to being an all-knowing Seer or poseur? You will figure out Eve, but never ME my babies!

The espionage in this movie reigns supreme. Nothing is given away. The audience is drawn into Roger's world and, as such, become just as puzzled by the events. The action moves from town to townsend, and we are caught in a web of confusion and are off balance time and time again. The bad guys are out to get Roger, the F.B.I. are out to use Roger, and Roger is out to get the girl. All these plots and subplots could make one very dizzy. Not for me though. Metamorpho carries with him a supply of Bonine. Very good for twists of plot.

Nothing seems to be what it is. And, even the ending, in movies terms, is not what it appears to be. However, Hitchcock is such a master that it might as well be. I am constantly enamoured of what this man has done with the art of cinema. And, remember people, he did not have the advantage of CGI technology and digital maneuvers. This makes the movie all the more remarkable. Also, I forgot the motif of chance and the balance thereof. This movie is filled with the motif that, regardless of how much we feel are lives are set and controlled, a chance happening could come along to change all we have known. Fortunately, Hitchcock balances it all out. The pain and craziness that Roger endured resulted in a true love of his life. A happy ending? Yes, maybe. But look at all it took to get there.

A true classic? Yes. And it still astounds me that Hitchcock never won an Oscar for Best Director. The man was a virtual genius in my eyes. So many movies. So many memorable scenes in many movies. His legacy lives and, Oscar or not, this movie is definitely one of his finest.

Now, somebody PLEASE give me a hankerchief! I am hanging on Mt. Rushmore and George Washington is about to sneeze!!!

113722,5,0790743213,"Many Blu-ray releases are slipshod, lazy affairs designed to cash in on great films. But when the big studios make a concerted effort to get it right, pull out all the stops, and go to town on making the best high definition transfers possible, then Blu-ray shines: ""North By Northwest"" is one of those examples (another recent release, ""Gone With The Wind"", is another fantastic example). The fantastic full-screen transfer offers a spotless print, with wonderfully intense blacks and rich and vivid colour.

In many ways ""North By Northwest"" needs no introduction. It is quintessential Hitchcock: the ever suave Cary Grant is pursued by sinister and yet urbane James Mason and hooks up with Eve Marie Saint in a slickly paced thriller with brilliant set-pieces in a cornfield and atop Mount Rushmore. It's possibly Hitchcock's best film (although critics would have you believe that's ""Vertigo""), and in any case deserves the blu ribband treatment. This is one of the few really great older films to be on Blu-ray, and you need to own it if you have a Blu-ray player. It's that simple.",1262304000,7,1087,4.939890710382514
113723,4,0790743213,"One of the most interesting elements I found in ""North by Northwest"" was the way that Alfred Hitchcock toyed with the audience with the role of Eve Kendall. Here is a strong, sophisticated, and independent young woman that is neither played as a bitch nor merely eye candy for the hungry male audience. I have found that the crucial weakness of many movies of the 1950's and 60's is the fact that the strong woman must be punished for her independent instincts. In fact, this could easily be argued of many films today. A strong leading female character is just as rare in Hollywood today as it was fifty years ago. If the times have changed, many of the movies surely haven't.

One of the many things that I found intriguing by the character of Eve Kendall was her ability to show empathy while, as the same time, staying true to herself. For example, take a look at the scene in which Roger Thornhill tells Eve, in a heartbreakingly real speech, just how much her deception has betrayed him. Even in this scene, where Eve is the ""bad guy"", she is able to show just how much she deeply cares for this man. Maybe it's a sign of great acting or exceptional directing (the close up shot of her just as he leaves is incredible) but, either way, this is a character that we rarely see in movies today.

Here is a character that is not only sexual but innocent. She is neither exploited for her actions nor is she looked down on for being a female of carnal needs. If Roger is unsure and wary about sex, Eve knows exactly what she wants and what she shall get. In this aspect alone, ""North by Northwest"" was a movie years ahead of its time.",1262131200,2,1635,4.375

If that is not the case, I envy you since you are in for a first-time treat. If you have a blu ray player stop reading this and just buy it!! Most people reading this are looking for information on how good it looks on blu-ray so I'll skip the plot synopsis and further accolades for the movie itself.

The transfer is far better than any I have seen for this movie. I have seen it before on Laserdisc (both the old diamond stylus and the ""modern"" Laserdisc from the 1990s) as well as DVD and I always felt that the colors were muddy / degraded on those versions. The blu-ray is well worth owning and provides a level of detail I had never before seen. It is possible to read signs in places like the airport and train station, the detail is that good. The colors seem much less muted though they do not rival a modern film or even the eye-popping color seen in 1960s vintage film/TV shows like The Prisoner and Star Trek which I also own and highly recommend. Another reviewer noted this film was done in Metrocolor (which I am not familiar with but which is likely why colors not so bold). There are a few spots in the film, one reaction take of Martin Landau's character, for example, which seem to be of much lower quality - but it is clear this is a problem with source material and not an issue with the transfer.

Overall, I feel this is a great buy for anyone who knows and loves this movie - and come to think of it I don't think I know anyone who has seen it who is not a fan!

I've always felt disappointed by the other videos  because they never seemed to get the color exactly right. Well. this one certainly does it up big. It's Metrocolor, which is no three strip process to begin with, but this disc really improves it by really escalating the color values.

The commentary by Lehman is the same one from the last MGM dvd and several other items are duplicated, too. But there is a great new documentary, THE MASTER'S TOUCH, and the excellent AMERICAN EXPERIENCE biography of Grant.

The movie remains the same whirlwind cross-country chase, hodgepodge of THE THIRTY NINE STEPS and SABOTEUR as it alway was. Saw it in '59, and have been a major fan ever since.

113750,5,0790743213,"I was introduced to this movie for a classroom exercise nearly 40 years ago. I became a Hitchcock fan for life. That ""movie"" print I saw back then was a 4x3 ""pan and scan"" version which was still great. Since then, I must have seen this movie 30-40 times, and most recently, always in its intended aspect ratio - although usually in a televised ""letterbox"" format.

I've owned it on videotape but, as it wasn't included in the Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection, never on dvd. I always intended to purchase it separately, but never wanted to pay big $ to do it. I even ordered it once from Amazon, only to find it sold out a few years back.

I jumped at the chance to order this new 50th Anniversary edition on blu-ray, and I was blown away. I've never seen a print with this clarity. Every scene looks like it was filmed yesterday. With a decent player and tv, this is one of the absolute best transfers I have ever seen. This disc is a bargain at twice the price (I got it for $20).

If you are a fan of this film (and you should be), it's almost a crime not to own it in this format. I've seen dozens of films that did not impress from the Blu upgrade, but this is not one of them. I can't say enough. Spectacular. You won't be disappointed.",1260748800,6,1242,4.232067510548523

I can only hope that this release may have some sort of influence on Universal, to do the same. Most of Hitchcock's catalogue belongs to Universal, including those films whose negatives have already been restored. These are films that any movie buff will miss, in hi-def format.

The work on the restoration and on the blu-ray edition is fabulous! It's like if it had been filmed last year! Picture and sound have been improved at their best. I've only given 4 stars because the special features section has no foreign subtitles. Warner haven't done a good job with the subtitles on the bonus features. The back cover says ""French, Spanish, German, Italian and Portuguese"" but NO, there are only English subtitles. It's a deceptive advertising, a big mistake and a total disappointment because the special features section contains many interesting documents.

For example, two men, standing next to each other in one scene, both have dark suits. Previously they both looked like black suits, but now I can see that one was a charcoal/black suit while the other was a very dark navy suit. It's incredible. Even the sound has received great improvement. Although most of the sound tends to come from your center speaker, there is now true surround sound, and I have noticed some very well done spatial balancing in my home theater -- remarkable considering when the original audio track was laid down and what technology they were using at the time.

113778,5,0790743213,"In November 2009, Warner Home Video released the 50th Anniversary 2 disc edition of Alfred Hitchcock's splendid 1959 thriller ""North by Northwest"".  The film stars Cary Grant, Eva Marie  and James Mason and proves to be just the right blend of wit, sophistication, glamour and action.  Many critics consider ""North By Northwest"" to be the finest picture Hitchcock ever made.

Beginning with the clever title sequence that opens with lines crisscrossing the screen like railroad tracks ""North by Northwest"" is one of those films that grabs your undivided attention from the very outset and simply never lets go.  Our hero Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) finds himself unwittingly caught up in a case of international intrigue when foreign agents mistakenly identify him as a CIA operative named George Kaplan and abduct him.  He is taken to a compound on Long Island where heavy Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) gives him the third degree.  Thornhill desperately tries to convince his captors that they have made a mistake but they were simply having none of it.  Subsequently Thornhill manages to escape and in a desperate effort to get to the bottom of all of this he once again finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time and is accused of the murder of a diplomat at the United Nations.  Now to further complicate matters we subsequently learn that there is no such person as George Kaplan!  Rather,  Kaplan is merely a non-existent operative created by U.S. Intelligence to draw attention away from the real operative in this melodrama Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).  Once again Roger Thornhill is on the lam but this time he is not only being pursued by foreign agents but the the FBI and the police as well.  The plot thickens when Thornhill and Kendall meet on a westbound train.  The interplay between Cary Grant and Eva Saint Marie in this film is priceless.  Thornhill subsequently learns that George Kaplan does not even exist and agrees to help a spymaster Professor (Leo G. Carroll) in his pursuit of the bad guys.  Quite the experience for a New York advertising executive who was twice divorced because his ex-wives thought he lived a very dull life.

When all is said and done I find there is little not to like about ""North By Northwest"".  Ernest Lehman's screenplay is simply brilliant with painstaking attention paid to even the smallest of details.  The photography is stunning and Bernard Herrmann's compelling musical score strikes just the right note at several key points in this motion picture.  And as usual Alfred Htichcock's direction proves to be virtually flawless.  ""North By Northwest'  offers two of the most memorable scenes in the history of the movies.  Who can ever forget the cropduster sequence where a pilot attempts to run down Thornhill in an open field in the middle of nowhere.  And then there is the climatic scene on the face of Mount Rushmore.  Simply spectacular!  Both of these scenes were the result of ideas that Alfred Hitchcock had been tossing around in this head for years!

As I mentioned at the top the deluxe 50th Anniversary edition of ""North by Northwest"" was just been released by Warner Home Video.  What a great package!  The ""bonus"" disc features extensive and incisive commentary by the film's screenwriter Ernest Lehman.  Numerous other features are also included on this disc that I have not yet had the time to sample.  The 50th Anniversary Edition of ""North by Northwest"" would be an awesome gift for just about any classic film buff.  Five decades later ""North by Northwest"" remains a fast paced thriller that will keep you on your toes from start to finish.  If you have never had an opportunity to see this film I urge you to grab yourself a copy.  Very highly recommended!",1260230400,2,3746,4.856466876971608
113779,5,0790743213,"One of Hitchcock's masterpieces made between Vertigo and Psycho, this is the master of suspense at his best.

Every frame of this film shows loving attention to detail, when films were made for grown-ups and not just males aged 18-24.

Comparing this to the special edition DVD I purchased a few years ago, the colour is the thing that strikes the most.  Skin tones are more natural and other colours just pop from the screen.  The extras are largely the same as the DVD, however the packaging is the standout thing for me.

How can those who are responsible ruin such an important film while promising to improve on DVD?  The old DVD was slightly too light but it was not ugly and its definition was much as we see in the Blu-Ray. Clearly Warners have simply transfered the master of the old DVD (which was indeed good) to Blu-Ray without going back to the  celluloid master (a pointless exercise if you are making a Blu-Ray from VistaVision) and then they overdid the darkening. They must put unqualified people in charge of these crucial tasks.

113796,5,0790743213,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2009 50th Anniversary ""BLU RAY"" VERSION ***

As you watch the title credits of Hitch's 1959 masterpiece ""North By Northwest"" roll up on screen in all their resplendent VistaVision Technicolor - the shiny, cold and aloof glass panelling of a New York skyscraper act as their backdrop.

It's a brilliant touch, because combined with Bernard Herrmann's staccato score it ratchets up the tension and also subliminally suggests to the viewer that some poor John Doe is about to get rightly and royally screwed by big business and big Government - or both. And of course, mistaken for a UN diplomat called George Caplin - our hapless hero George Thornhill (played by Cary Grant) - does just that.

Then when the credits end and Cary exits the lift with his secretary (Doreen Lang), all suited-n-booted and looking dapper enough to lick - another element kicks in - the picture quality...

The print is just BEAUTIFUL - featuring as it does state-of-the art frame-by-frame restoration. In fact, I raved in an Amazon UK Listmania list some 3 years ago about how good the DVD looked - well this BLU RAY is better - and at times just jaw dropping to look at.

Icing on the cake is that this 50th Anniversary BLU RAY reissue also adds on some superlative new features which are just as good as the film itself (nearly 3 hours of viewable features).

Here's the full list:

1. Commentary by Ernest Lehman (Original Script-Writer)
2. New 2009 Documentary ""The Master's Touch: Hitchcock's Signature Style"" (over 50 minutes - featuring comments from directors Martin Scorsese, Curtis Hanson, Francis Lawrence, Guillermo del Toro and many more)
3. Previously seen, but superlative feature-length profile ""Cary Grant: A Class Apart"" (over 1 1/2 hours)
4. New 2009 feature called ""North By Northwest: One For The Ages"" examining the movies innovations and influences
5. Feature called ""The Making Of North By Northwest"" from 2000 hosted by Eva Marie Saint
6. Music Only Audio Track
7. Stills Gallery  (black & white stills of the stars and Hitchcock - both on set and on location)
8. Theatrical Trailers & TV Spots
9. Internet link to Warner Brothers

A whole bunch of things combine to make NBN work - a great story by Ernest Lehman, superb night and day locations, immaculate period clothes, the bulbous gas-guzzling cars, the art-deco buildings, the interiors of wealthy homes and the deeply luxurious dining cars of long-distance 1950's trains. And to top all of that, you get genuine old-school Hollywood star power in the form of James Mason, Martin Landau, Leo Carroll and the luminous love interest Eva Marie Saint. And of course the effortlessly suave and charming Cary Grant - arguably the best leading man Tinseltown ever produced. Throw in the tension, wit and camera angles of Hitchcock at the helm - and you're on a winner.

But your eyes keep coming back to how this BLU RAY shines. There are so many little scenes that now look sumptuous - Alfred missing the bus just at the end of the opening credits in his famous cameo scene - the garish colors of Fifties New York taxis, the marble of the Plaza hotel lobby as Cary walks through to meet clients in in the bar. Then there's the Townsend home and gardens as the villains motor up the gravel driveway to the front door, the three dapper suits of the boys as they parry in the library room inside (Mason, Landau and Grant) and the clarity of the night scene where they put a drunk Cary in a stolen car and try to drive him off a cliff. Further on there's the color of the fields in the legendary crop-duster scene, hanging off the Mount Rushmore monument by your fingernails - even Eva Saint Marie's beautiful red dress in the hotel room as she stands by the door while Cary showers in the bathroom... I could go on!

If I was to point out one genuine downside, it's the focus. Some scenes quite deliberately have Grant and Saint with an almost halo-like shine around them (soft focus to make them look better) and can at times make the print look just a teeny bit soft, but other than that the whole shebang is a joy to behold...

Up there with ""The Italian Job"", ""Zulu"",  ""Goldfinger"", ""Saturday Night, Sunday Morning"", ""2001"" A Space Odyssey"" and ""The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner"" in terms of top quality restoration (see my reviews for each) - ""North By Northwest"" is a triumph on BLU RAY. And the superb additional extras only make you feel that Warners are to be praised for a job well done...

Roll on ""To Catch A Thief"" on the BLU RAY format - another beautiful Hitchcock/Grant restoration currently being raved about (the ""Centennial Collection"" double DVD set)...",1258416000,9,4659,4.714637146371464

The Hitchcock  documentary contains only limited clips from only certain movies and if you can imagine a documentary on Hitchcock with no clips from Psycho, Vertigo, The Birds, Rear Window, Rope, etc., then you might actually enjoy it. While interesting, I kept getting hit over the head with the fact that whomever did the documentary only had access to certain Hitchcock movies -- more than likely those that were probably available through the same seller as the 50th Anniversary DVD of North by Northwest.

I purchased the 50th anniversary edition film at Target for 15.99, came home and watched it and loved every minute of it. Hitch's play of the every man's sense of fear is played out in nearly every scene. The man knew what scared people and preyed upon them with celluloid. His techniques in this movie are masterful including the giant mattes that included Mt. Rushmore (after the national park service prohibited the film makers from having actors crawl on the president's faces) in Hollywood to the famous crop dusting scene that included one of the top film explosions of its day.

113799,5,0790743213,"""NORTH BY NORTHWEST"" (1959)

It's hard to believe that this is the 50th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's great romantic thriller starring a perfectly cast Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint and marvelous supporting work by a ""jealous"" James Mason, a ""gay"" Martin Landau and an always droll Leo G. Carroll as a cynical and unflappable government agent.
But at the heart of this terrific film that never seems old lies the brilliant ""double-chase"" original screenplay by the late Ernest Lehman.
Inspired by a notion Hitchcock expressed to Lehman that he always wanted to direct a movie that included a chase across the faces of Mt. Rushmore, the two film geniuses slowly built a story from that lowly beginning.

Lehman was inspired to maintain a tone of a sometimes funny but always thrilling and finally romantic plot that never lags and ends with the iconic climax that Hitchcock initially ordered.
In preproduction it was called ""The Man in Lincoln's Nose.""  The idea of the main character running from and to something and keeping him almost as confused as the audience about what was really going on has now connected in a direct way to three generations of movie lovers.  By identifying with our on-screen hero, we can be brave, witty, loyal to something noble and be rewarded with true love.

Lehman's great creation of a dapper movie hero who remains confident, debonair and witty is the model for the cinematic transition of James Bond from a lesser literary figure to a screen personae.

Hitchcock was trained as an artist and his films are composed with an efficient eye to visualizing the emotion of the story with images first and dialogue second.  He worked out everything - all the shots -- on note cards.  He said that when he was done with his story-board, he felt he had already directed the film.  When he was actually shooting scenes, he rarely exposed film that could be edited in any way other than what he had already determined.
Bernard Herrmann's memorable score, certainly among his best, adds immensely to the tone of the film; never forecasting events but always supporting the tension or romance.  For many, recalling certain films, it's Hermann's score that first comes to mind.  (Try thinking of ""Psycho"" without the screeching violins.)

This week (as of this writing) Warner Bros. is releasing new editions of a restored ""North By Northwest"" on DVD and Blu-ray.  The extras include commentary by writer Lehman, a making-of documentary and a two fine new featurette that examines the cinema art of Hitchcock.

One's contemporary cultural education is not complete without experiencing this iconic film.  (Not rated, widescreen, 137 minutes)",1257465600,3,2668,4.99097065462754
113800,5,0790743213,"WOW... Simply Stunning! As much as I do admittedly love many of today's special effects, there is something even more impressive about the stunning picture and sound quality of the Blu-ray editions of the classic films from decades past that are coming out now. Take this jaw-dropping Blu-ray of North by Northwest... At 37, I've actually never seen this film before, but since starting my Blu-ray collection, I have been re-acquainitng myself with classic films from the 70s, 60s, 50s, and before... what an engaging and amazing film Mr. Hitchcock made indeed! Blu-ray seems to make every movie that much better in my humble opinion, and the Blu-ray version of this 50 year-old masterpiece had me hooked form the first frames! The detail, depth and color purity and quality are simply stunning for a film of any age, to say nothing of one 50 years old. This film looks better than several more recent Blu-ray releases I've seen. And the 5.1 sound mix from the orginal mono audio is one of the best I've heard for a mono-to-stereo mix. Listening carefully to the mix with headphones, I heard alot of pleasant spatiality that's not often present in some 5.1 remixes from films of this vintage.... Superlative film. Superlative Blu-ray!",1257379200,5,1234,4.909090909090909
113801,5,0790743213,"I love this film and have seen it many times.  Not only has it stood the test of time, it actually improves with repeated viewings.  The first few times you see it, you're so swept up in the non-stop action and the plot twists that you may not fully appreciate the imagery of the perfectly composed scenes and the powerful score that adds so much. The acting, the screenplay, and iconic scenes like the crop duster attack and the chase on Mt. Rushmore all combine to make this a great movie. It's not only one of my favorite Hitchcock films, it's one of my favorite films of all times by any director.  It's the first Hitchcock film to be issued as a Blu-Ray, so news of its release caused a great deal of interest among fans.  The initial reviews gave the Blu-Ray transfer high marks, and I'm pleased to report that the positive reviews are accurate. The remastering was done with great care and with impressive results.

The video corrects the orange skin tones that characterized the earlier standard definition DVD as well as eliminating virtually all dust, scratches, and other surface defects.  Especially when you consider that this film is 50 years old, the high-def transfer is very effective at revealing details and adding a greatly improved sense of depth and dimensionality.

The audio is also excellent, with the soundtrack coming alive in a way that it never has before.  The original mono source isn't overly processed, but instead elements are highlighted in a way that opens up the sound.  Bernard Herrmann's score is such an integral part of the film that it's good to hear it more fully.

There's a very good set of extras, two of them new for this release.  My favorite is ""'North by Northest': One For The Ages"", which features five directors commenting on the film as scenes are shown.

This movie combines the best of everyone's talents; Grant, Mason, Hitch, Hermann, the screenwriters, the editing, the wonderful late 50's icons such as the Plaza hotel, the Phipps mansion in Long Island, the New York Central's luxury 20th Century Limited, the Ambassador Hotel, and finally Mount Rushmore. And lets not forget all those wonderful big gas guzzling Lincolns and Cadillacs.

It is no surprise that this movie was a box office mega hit when it came out and has been in continuous availability ever since and one of the five most popular movies on Turner network. And now it's on BluRay. I just love it !!",1257292800,2,759,4.8307692307692305
113803,5,0790743213,"Wow! The Blu-ray is the transfer we've been waiting for. It eclipses all previous ones (at least, those I've seen), including the well-done LV.

""NbNW"" has never been a particularly ""good-looking"" film. Projection prints were grainy and contrasty, with vivid, vulgar colors. This transfer -- made from the camera negatives, or something close -- corrects these problems.

For the first time, we can see just how /beautiful/ ""NbNW"" is, and the outstanding quality of the cinematography. The scene in which Mason closes the drapes and turns on the lights, while he and Grant eye each other and waltz around the room, has a sense of depth and ""tonality"" I've ever seen before. Even better is the scene on the train where Grant and Saint engage in ""intercourse"" while clothed and standing up (Hitchcock knew how to get around the censors! *). It's soft and romantic, a quality quite lost in previous transfers.

Interestingly, the matte paintings, rear projection, and static mattes are /less/ obvious than they were in previous versions. The scene in which Thornhill and the Professor walk toward the plane is perhaps the finest example of rear projection you'll ever see. You have to look closely to realize they're /not/ at an airport. **

""NbNW"" was shot in VistaVision (""Motion-Picture High Fidelty""). It uses what still photographers would call a full 35mm frame (rather than the half frame used for movies), and therefore runs horizontally through the camera. Of all 35mm formats, VistaVision was /made/ for high-definition video. Its basic aspect ratio is 5:3 (within the 3:2 film frame), and it can be matted to wider aspect ratios in the camera or during projection. ***

""NbNW"" was probably intended to be projected at 1.85:1. This transfer is at the slightly less-wide 16:9 (1.77:1), an excellent choice that fills the HD screen. Nothing is lost, and there are no distracting borders (for those bothered by such things).

And let's not forget the sound, because this is a Bernard Herrmann score. As far as I know, this is the first transfer to present all the music in stereo (ditto for sound effects). (The LV had only the overture in stereo.) The sound is fantastically good -- if you're so young you think ""digital good, analog not-so-good"", you need to hear this. ****

I have some gripes. Several shots in the crop-duster sequence have a ""splotch"" near the center, likely due to a water droplet that dried on the lens. And the brightness of some of the static mattes in the Mount Rushmore sequence flickers quite obviously. These would not have required a lot of work to correct.

Another reviewer has criticized the color, and I'm inclined to agree. Male skin tones are excessively warm, even yellowish. This is fine for Cary Grant -- who sported a perpetual Douglas Fairbanks tan -- but most of the male actors look as if they've spent too much time under a sun lamp. Now, get this... excerpts from this transfer used in the supplemental material have more-natural skin tones! Why this is, I don't know, but I've seen it on several recent Blu-rays -- the image quality in the supplements is better than that of the film itself.

As is becoming increasingly common for ""important"" movies, the disk is encased in a souvenir book. It's nice, but substance-free. You'll read it once, then put it aside. (It's a shame such books don't attempt to duplicate the contents of road-show souvenir booklets, but the format doesn't lend itself to it.)

As for the film itself, what is there to say? A classic, a perfect example of how Hitch was able to ""play"" the audience like an organ. In my ""Snow White"" review, I suggest that it is possibly the most consciously ingenuous film ever made. Hitchcock's films are the polar opposite -- consciously disingenuous. He's not just telling a story, but deliberately manipulating the audience. The audience knows it, but loves it anyhow.

Perhaps the most-amazing thing about ""NbNW"" is the way Hitchcock seamlessly melds humor, suspense, and action. (Grant's ability to switch instantly between restrained-ironic and dead-serious helps.) Only Steven Spielberg has come close. But he'll never be a Hitchcock.

* Thematically, ""NbNW"" is much like ""Notorious"" -- Ingrid Bergman is a ""loose"" woman coerced into marrying Claude Rains so she can spy on him for the government. In a famous scene, Hitchcock got around the Code's restriction on how long a man and woman can kiss by repeatedly having Grant and Bergman break the kiss, then start over -- which makes the scene even more sensual.

** MGM probably realized that VistaVision would reveal problems not visible in a smaller format, and spent the money for better effects shots.

*** Given the high cost of VistaVision prints and the need for a special projector, few theaters were able to project VistaVision as it was meant to be seen. Most VistaVision prints are half-frame reductions, which lose most of the original quality.

**** I used to do live recording, and digital comes closer to live sound. But... in the late 50s and early 60s, analog tape recording had reached a level of transparency, ""immediacy"", realism, and just plain ""euphony"" you rarely hear today. Simply in terms of ""sounding good"", this 50-year-old soundtrack is state-of-the-art. (If you want to hear a modern recording that's better -- that is, coming significantly closer to live sound -- try the Rilling performance of Britten's ""War Requien"".)",1257292800,19,5420,4.953744493392071

If I had nothing to compare with, I probably would have been more pleased. I'm sorry to say this, but I find the colors extremely dull and ugly, and the image quite a bit too dark. Please take a look at the old DVD if you can. It is much brighter (maybe even a bit too much so), but the color palette is definitely much, much warmer in every scene. Just look at Cary Grant's famous tan. On the DVD it looks like a tan, but on the Blu-Ray, his face looks dirty. And daylight scenes have natural looking blue skies on the DVD; on the Blu-Ray they're often dark turquoise. Hey, this film is a comedy thriller, not a gloomy drama. I cannot imagine that this Blu-Ray exhibits the hues that Hitchcock wanted. No other color film of his has this murky look, so why should ""North by Northwest"" be an exception? Better luck next time, Warner.

the film is iconic for it's one scene involving the airplane and crop field, but overall, the film is a tribute to one of film's greatest directors, Alfred Hitchock.

North by Northwest is a film about mistaken identity, where Cary Grant gets mistaken as an undercover spy agent, and what follows, is a series of one suspense after another.

i don't want to go to deep into the movie, but i will say this. Unlike the films of today which are big budget, big bombs, sex scene, nude part, etc, North by Northwest is a great film of story making that will have you entrenched from beginning to end.

113809,5,0790743213,"The scene remains embedded deep into every movie maven's mind: Man and woman fighting for their lives while straddling the faces of four presidents at Mt. Rushmore.
  North By Northwest: Film frenzy indeed.
  Leave it to Alfred Hitchcock to come up with such a brilliant bit of motion-picture making.
  For those who watch too much Fox News: Cary Grant, in his fourth outing with Hitchcock, plays Manhattan ad man Roger Thornhill, who is abducted, plunged into the world of spies and counterspies, framed for murder and chased in the famous crop-duster sequence. Eva Marie Saint plays his love interest Eve Kendall, and yes, the final train-plunging-through-the-tunnel scene is a visual metaphor for exactly what you think.
  Quite the fashion. By the way, the tailored gray, ventless, three-button suit  Grant wears in the 1959 film was named by GQ as the best suit in film history. The mag gushed that the suit was ""arguably the most legendary in the history of American cinema.""
  Suits us.
  But one of Eva's lines during the film's dining car seduction scene did not suit censors and was redubbed. She originally said ""I never make love on an empty stomach,"", but it was changed in post-production to ""I never discuss love on an empty stomach"" because censors felt the original version was too risqu.
  And even know we know the final chase was not actually filmed at South Dakota's Mt. Rushmore---Hitchcock couldn't get permission to shoot an attempted murder on a national monument---we suspend disbelieve, with a rush for more action. That final scene was actually filmed on a studio replica of Mt. Rushmore; watch it again and note that everything is shot carefully, and the faces of George, Teddy, Thomas and Abe linked with violence. (No wonder one of the film's original working titles was The Man on Lincoln's Nose.)
  By the way, another pivotal scene takes place at the United nations, but Hitchcock couldn't get permission to film near the UN, so he filmed footage of the building using a camera hidden in a parked van; the rooms were later recreated on a soundstage.
  Bless such sneakiness.
  And when you watch North By Northwest again, you can do it to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Hitchcock's sleek masterwork in a spectacularly restored Blu-ray edition---the first of the famed director's films to become available on this state-of-the-art format. Warner Home Video has done us all a welcome pleasure by meticulously restoring and remastering the flick, scanning the original VistaVision production elements in 8K resolution so, they promise, ""the resulting presentation reveals a depth of field and clarity never before possible, only serving to heighten every thrill-packed moment of this beloved classic.""
  Bless their greedy little money-making hearts.
  The film, starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Jessie Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll and Martin Landau, is a stylish, action-packed espionage caper written by Ernest Lehman, with music by that genius known as Bernard Herrmann. The film, alas, was only nominated for three Academy Awards (Best Writing, Film Editing and Art Direction) and won none, though it did rank in the No. 4  spot on the American Film Institute's ""100 Years...100 Thrills,"" a compilation of the top 100 thrilling movies in American cinema. In 1995, North by Northwest was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.""
  Oh yes. The crop duster sequence. It was set in northern Indiana (the square Indiana highway signs were replicas placed in view by Hitchcock), but was shot on location near the towns of Wasco and Delano, north of Bakersfield, California, just east of the intersection of Corcoran Road and Garces Highway 155.
  The plane flying in the scene is a N3N, a World War II Navy pilot trainer that had been converted for crop dusting. The plane that hits the truck and explodes is a wartime Boeing Model 75. Hitchcock bought the worn-out plane for the explosion for a few hundred dollars.
  We'll end with a quiz. Why were Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Lincoln chose to be chiseled in stone?  Washington is on there because he commanded the Revolutionary War and was the first president; Jefferson fought for westward expansion and authored the Declaration of Independence; Roosevelt promoted conservation; Lincoln restored the Union and ended Slavery. The carving of Mt. Rushmore took place between October 4, 1927, and October 31, 1941, under the direction of Gutzon Borglum, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the United States of America.",1251849600,5,4652,5.127320954907161

Incidentally, some Blu-Ray players, when playing standard DVDs, take a little longer to negotiate the layer transition point than many late-model standard DVD players.

James Mason is excellent as the suave villain and fine support comes from Landau and Carroll. The story moves at a very brisk pace and there are some justifyably famous scenes in the movie.

The comedy is sub-par, Cary Grant is given inane and foppish dialogue as he tries to woo Eva Marie Saint's character, and the intrigue is nonexistent; you can get much more adventure out of the worst of the James Bond films.

113825,5,0790743213,"A case of mistaken identity sends a charming advertising executive on a cross country adventure filled with terror, murder and, believe it or not, love.  Yes, `North by Northwest' is Alfred Hitchcock at his finest.  Engrossing, deceptive and visually stunning; this is the type of `no holds bar' entertainment that keeps you glued to your seat throughout and begging for more upon the roll of the credits.

The ever so dapper Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a man mistaken to be a undercover agent by enemy spies.  When they fail to kill him he winds up getting himself in deep with the feds as his story about kidnapping and spies seems as preposterous as it is convoluted.  Roger has to then take maters into his own hands in order to save his own life.  This is when he meets the beautiful Eve Kendall, and as soon as sparks begin to fly his whole world gets flipped upside down.

I don't want to give away too much, but the great thing about Hitchcock is being able to experience it the way he intended; knowing very little.  The more you know the less you can truly be surprised by everything that Hitchcock has in store for you; and believe me, he has a lot in store with this one.

From the stunning sets to the brilliantly choreographed stunts, this is a complete package; a marvelously crafted action thriller that actually has substance.  It doesn't trim away the intelligence to deliver a half hearted spectacle but balances the two brilliantly, as do most of Hitchcock's films.  The film is clever as all get out, which makes watching Roger get himself in and then out of trouble so much fun.  The performances are also very good here.  Cary Grant is an actor I am not very familiar with, but general consensus of his work is that he is more charm than depth.  I found him a perfect balance of both here, able to fluctuate effortlessly between his emotions and his characters grasp of his situation.  James Mason is amazing as the sinister Phillip Vandamm and Eva Marie Saint is stellar as Roger's love interest Eve.  She has this sensuality that permeates her scenes and draws us into her mystery.

LOVE IT!

Anyways, I totally recommend this one.  Like I said, I fear for saying too much so I'm cutting this one short.  It is totally worth it though, for any film fan.

When you first watch North By Northwest you may think, it's a very entertaining movie and nothing beyond that. Actually it is an extremely entertaining story and nothing beyond that. And it is one of the greatest examples of the genius of Hitchcock! He's the only director I know who could take a story as trivial and create such a mood of place and character, that every scene is successful in tone, mood and creative scene development. I feel like I've been put in a slight hypnotic state every time I see it. It is the bible of narrative for the action and spy genre.

Movie`s hero:  ""My wives divorced me.""
Movie's heroine: ""Why?""
Hero: ""They said I lived too dull a life.""

The above dialogue is found near the end of this classic suspense movie that is even today unparalleled in producing an optimal combination of plot, humour, action, mystery, and intrigue without resorting to clichs.  It was directed by ""The Master of Suspense,"" the great Alfred Hitchcock.

Look for Hitchcock's characteristic brief cameo appearance after the opening credits.  Some say that there is a second cameo.

Briefly, our hero in this movie, mid-mannered advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), is plunged into the bizarre world of spy (James Mason), counterspy (the heroine in this movie played by Eva Marie Saint), is kidnapped, framed for murder, chased, and even crop-dusted.  I should also mention that he ""visits"" Mount Rushmore and gets up-close to the faces of former U.S. presidents (Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Lincoln) carved on the mountain.

The debonair Cary Grant effectively carries this movie.  (This was Grants fourth and final teaming with Hitchcock.)  Kudos must also go to the terrific supporting cast of Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Martin Landau (who plays the spy's main henchman), Jesse Royce Landis (who plays Thornhill's mother where in real-life Landis was only eight years older than Grant) and Leo G. Carroll (who plays the head of the C.I.A.).

Another key ingredient of this movie is its background music.  This fantastic orchestral score was composed by Bernard Herrmann.  It effectively adds to each scene.

Where does the movie's title come from?  There are actually many theories for its origin.  Personally, I think it comes from the fact that as the movie proceeds, Thornhill travels north on Northwest Airlines.  (One of the original titles for this movie was ""The Man in Lincoln's Nose."")

Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has eight interesting extras.

In conclusion, this is one of those movie gems that, in my opinion, deserves to be called a ""classic.""  Roger Thornhill's ex-wives were wrong.  He definitely does not have a dull life!!

Recommendation: watch this movie on as large of a screen as possible.

113833,3,0790743213,"The addition of pretense can be a killer in a film. It is precisely the lack of such a quality that makes Alfred Hitchcock's two and a quarter hour long 1959 color thriller North By Northwest a better and more enjoyable film than his preceding film, Vertigo, even if the film comes nowhere near the excellence of his following film, Psycho. Whereas the two films that end in -o attempt to impose a deeper psychology into their screenplays, North By Northwest is a popcorn eaters gala pre-James Bondian Cold War thriller. It's no wonder the film was a popular smash while Vertigo was a financial flop.
  On a strictly logical level, little of the film makes much sense, but it's Hitchcock, after all. As example, what is contained on the microfilm that is the film's MacGuffin- inside the statuette, is meaningless and beside the point- which is action and thrills. That there is no logical reason for Cary Grant's character, Roger Thornhill- another Hitchcockian wrongly accused man, a Madison Avenue advertising executive, to be mistaken for the non-existent spy George Kaplan, is another problem. Yet, even though it is done in a rather unconvincing fashion- Thornhill summons a hotel attendant who is paging Kaplan, and the chase is on- few people will debate cause and effect in a film like this. The dopey bad guys see this brief moment and assume everything- a perfect example of the dumbest possible action propelling the plot, which is usually an artistic killer. However, on the plus side, this is one of Cary Grant's best and Cary Grantiest roles. He is charming, delightful, suave, and the fact that he never seems to get a hair out of place in assorted acts of derring-do, even when chased and dusted by that crop duster, in one of the film's most famed scenes, is not a problem, unless one just cannot let the formula silliness wash over them.
  On the negative side is the performance of Eva Marie Saint, as Eve Kendall- the lover/counterspy of James Mason's Soviet mole character, Phillip Vandamm. Saint is stiff and wooden, and even less convincing as a romantic lead than many of the other icy blonds that inhabit the Hitchcock universe. Yes, she's beautiful; second perhaps only to Grace Kelly in the Hitchcockian blond goddess pantheon, but she has absolutely no chemistry with Grant.... Technically, the film holds up much better than many of Hitchcock's other efforts, for the process screens are not always readily detectable, as they are in other of his films- save for the scene where Thornhill does not drive his car off a cliff that the bad guys want him to, and the sets constructed for some of the big chase scenes- especially the Mount Rushmore set, are fabulous, even by modern standards. While the cinematography by Robert Burks is solid, there are no eyepopping moments, and the score by Bernard Herrmann is one of his least memorable, especially considering what was just around the corner in Psycho.
  North By Northwest, whose title is both manifest- given the film's final setting, and obscure and of unknown provenance- although oddly linked to a supposed quote from William Shakespeare's Hamlet, is not a great film, but it is a terrific movie, and because it is such utter and unrepentant fluff it holds up much better than many other 1950s vintage films, including many of Hitchcock's own overrated `masterpieces', such as Rear Window and Vertigo. Yes, if you are the type who must go over everything with even a coarse toothcomb, the film simply will not work, but if you trust that the fun will leave your mind as unmussed as Cary Grant's coiffure, then watch it. After all, the perfect hair of Cary Grant is never something to be diminished.",1221436800,7,3684,4.830427892234549
113834,5,0790743213,"This 1959 Alfred Hitchcock film was the fourth and last ""spy"" film that he did with Cary Grant.  The others are Suspicion (1941), Notorious (1946), and To Catch a Thief (1955).

I realize that Hitchcock was a close friend of Albert Broccoli (James Bond films)and Cary Grant was the original pick by Albert Broccoli to play James Bond, but the character in this film, Roger Thornhill, reminded so much of James Bond, that I had a hard time trying to convince myself that this isn't a ""Bond"" film.  I realize that Dr. No (the first Bond film) came out in 1962.  BUT, was Bond's film character patterned on this wonderful movie?  The resemblance is so great, Thornhill even had a martini!

Briefly, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a U.S. undercover agent, abducted, framed for murder, nobody believes his story so he's on the run.  He meets a counter spy (Eva Marie Saint) and has one of the longest on-screen kisses with her.

This movie has so many great scenes.  Among them are the stabbing at the United Nations (where Thornhill was framed for murder), A crop dusting plane that attacked our running hero (which incidently was the influence for the helicopter scene in From Russia With Love---again, Bond) and the great chase around the presidents' faces at Mt. Rushmore.

This film also starred James Mason and Martin Landau.

Somewhere in between is the sophisticated, glamorous and mysterious femme fatale Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), whose unpredictable devotions tremble between the extremes of good and evil...

Will Grant slip away from his would-be killers? Does he clear his name after falsely being accused?

This mistaken identity (a favorite plot point for Hitch) leads Cary Grant on a cross country journey that culminates in one of the most unforgettable cinematic scenes at Mt. Rushmore.

Eva Marie Saint is splendid as the double agent helping and bumbling Grant along the way.

This is a truly great film: filled with comedy and mayhem, as well as murder and political intrigue.  Anyone could fall in love with this movie.",1211846400,4,610,4.771428571428571

The Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound quality as well as the picture quality of my dvd is excellent too.

People have to recognise that most of Hitch's films combine elements of humour together with suspense and thrills and what makes this film great is the nice balance of these that's apparent.  The witty dialogue and snappy one-liner jokes delivered by the brilliant Cary Grant still hold up well today.  The Kafka-esque storyline is meant to be so outrageous as to be funny and if taken in that spirit many of the scenes are very entertaining indeed.  The ludicrousness of trying to kill ""George Kaplan"" by filling him with alcohol and then helping him drive off a mountain's edge, being chased by a crop-duster in the middle of nowhere, etc make fans of Kafka's works like ""The Trial"" and ""Metamorphosis"" who can appreciate the genre truly appreciate and enjoy this film masterpiece.

Granted some of the scenes do not make much logical sense such as when Eve Kendell talks to Martin Landau's character from a phone booth while he is doing so from another phone in the same line of booths and the strange way the crop duster slams into the oil tanker but that's just the point with Kafka-esques situations in that they are supposed to be ridiculous.  Despite these screenplay ""shortcomings"" the acting is very good and I liked the camera angles very much for an overall very good film.  Great combination of humour, thrills and spills, tension and drama makes this a classic film for the ages.

Highly recommended!

Updated 11 May 2011:

Amazon will not let me review the 50th Anniversary Blu-Ray Book Edition separately and so I'll have to append it here.  This film does benefit from the 1080p treatment picture quality-wise although the improvement is not a vast one as compared with the DVD release that I wrote about before.  There are also a few frames interspersed here and there which are poor but overall it is still an improvement albeit not massively so over the DVD.  The sound quality however is an improvement worth shouting about coming in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround sound although there are some weak audio spots at certain parts especially when it comes to dialogue.  The picture book is nice to behold and will please collectors and fans alike.  The special features are what really make this reissue worth shouting about as we have various directors like Friedkin, Scorcese and Spielberg talking about how Hitchcock influenced them and you even see spots in their movies where they borrowed from elements of Hitch's work.

Overall, this is a worthy upgrade of the film more so for the great special feature documentaries than for the picture and sound quality which despite being still better in 1080p than the dvd release is not a great leap better in my opinion.

Intrigued, I bought a new R2 PAL DVD of the film at a local store. Sure enough, the exact same thing happened at the same place in DVD playback.

My favorite thing in the film, is Cary Grant, who is at his most splendid, elegant, funny best.  Just watching this man for two hours is sheer pleasure.

The rest of the cast is good.  James Mason gives his usual expert performance as the bad guy who is just charming enough to have won the beautiful blond, for a while.  I usually love Eva Marie Saint but I think that she was not well cast here.  Hitchcok adores his pale blonds but she shines better as a sincere, vulnerable sweetie and doesn't quite pull off the sophisticated double agent role.  I found her attempts at being seductive on the train forced and unattractive. When she shows her true feelings towards the end, she warms up and her real beauty shows.  She looks good, though and there are some great costumes, which apparently Hitchcock picked out for her personally on a shopping trip to Bergdorf's.

The woman cast as Grant's mother was only a year older than he was, which seems to be another big mistake.  She is good (reminds me of Stockard Channing) but not at all convincing as his mom.  Also, Grant is just too gorgeous to be going to the theatre with his mother!

The most amusing feature of the film, is Mount Rushmore!  Just the idea of having people scrambling for their lives over the faces of our venerable presidents stikes me as very funny--pure Hitchcock.

""North by Northwest"" begins when a man is mistaken for a CIA agent. He  is soon caught up in deadly chase all over the country. It ends, of course, with the famous scenes on Mount Rushmore.

I'll keep my review short. Longer reviews are best read after seeing the movie. Nevertheless, I would note that I was surprised at all the sexual innuendo in this movie. I wasn't offended, but Hitchcock was way ahead of its time on that score. The two lovers were really hot.

I think we show too much nowadays and loose some of the mystery of sexual encounters. Just talking around a subject can be very sensual.

I would also recommend ""Vertigo,"" by Alfred Hitchcock. This is one of the ten best movies ever made--very compelling.

When he arrives at a country estate, his kidnappers start calling him George Kaplan.  Roger has no clue who Kaplan is and says so quite forcefully.  Whether they believe him or not, he is forced to drink bourbon and left alone in a car to die.

The only problem for them is he survives.  Determined to find out what the heck is going on, he sets out trying to track down Kaplan.  His efforts land him as the prime suspect in a diplomat's murder.

With his only lead being a hotel room in Chicago, Roger sets out cross country by train.  It is there he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a beautiful woman with a secret of her own.  Can Roger find the truth?  Maybe, but he will have to face low flying crop dusters and a chase across Mount Rushmore to do it.

This is my fourth Hitchcock film, and the first one I enjoyed.  The story starts rather quickly and is confusing enough that it held my interest the entire time.  Yet is also has some very witty banter and a great romance between the two leads.  The acting is superb, easily drawing me into the story.

Unfortunately, it suffers from a common curse of movies from that era, pacing.  While I found parts of it rather gripping, I found the parts on the train dull and slow.  Yes, it was developing character and building the romance.  But I still found my mind starting to wander.

113860,4,0790743213,"Ernest Lehman's screenplay for 'North by Northwest' must have caught Hitch's eye from the start--it's so typical of the kind of film he loved to make (a man on the run from unseen or unknown enemies). He milks every drop of suspense and along the way injects a lot of humor and sexual innuendo with the usual blonde femme fatale (Eva Marie Saint) providing a good number of delightful moments. Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are perfect in the leads and James Mason and Martin Landau are highly satisfactory villains.

It's all great fun, with Grant mistaken in the opening scene for a Federal Intelligence agent who doesn't really exist. He is soon swept up in a an amusing and suspenseful twist of plot complications involving spies and counterspies with an unpredictable series of nail-biting scenes that never let up until the smashing climax at Mount Rushmore. The dust-cropping scene is a highlight, skillfully edited and photographed for maximum effect.

As usual, the suspense begins with the opening credits as Bernard Herrmann's staccato notes of music prepare us for what follows. An all-time great that has to rank as one of Grant's and Hitchcock's best films.

I wandered into a neighborhood theatre one afternoon and saw this picture, probably lured by the poster showing Cary Grant being chased by a biplane.  This was when neighborhood movie houses showed big-screen movies on a big screen.  It was real moviegoing then.  The screens have gotten smaller and so have the movies.

I was enthralled from start to finished.  I resolved to be suave & debonaire like Grant when I grew up.  I missed the mark, by just a little.  I thought Eva Marie Saint was the most beautiful creature I had ever laid eyes on.  The scene where they meet in the dining car is amazing.  Any fan of movie romance shouldn't miss it.

This is why so many young people have never seen an Alfred Hitchcock movie.  For the longest time, I was one of the ignorant masses, until my mother told me about this great movie-maker.  I picked this up at the local library and watched it, and was amazed.  This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.

We watch and see who can spot his cameo appearances... my favorite is when Mr. Hitchcock is part of a portrait... so we had a devil of a time finding him during the movie.

North by Northwest was produced in 1959 and it has a recipe of romance, intrigue, thrilling action, and mystery that produces a brilliant performance by Cary Grant.

Cary Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill, an advertising executive who is erroneously kidnapped by enemies of a certain George Kaplan, supposedly a United States undercover agent. Mr. Thornhill is drugged but escapes and a fascinating series of events start to shape the plot. During this film, we see the appearance of great actors from Mission Impossible, the Man from Uncle, and other shows, which keep us at the edge of our seat with their mystery, thrilling action, and romance.

Eva Marie Saint plays the part of the woman Cary Grant falls for. She is sexy, elegant, poised... and the two engage in some of the most interesting dialogue, which at some point, culminates in the most interesting of romantic kisses ever produced by Hollywood.

The filming in New York City allows the audience to travel through Manhattan in the 50's and it is amazing how it all remains the same, and yet due to security... it is all so very different, especially with regards to visiting the United Nations, where there is a stabbing not to be missed for it is something that could not take place in today's terms.

Alfred Hitchcock knew a recipe for a perfect thriller because he had made many but among his films, ""North by Northwest"" (1959) stands out as a great combination of suspense, sex, and humor. The film is based on a case of mistaken identity that in a course of a few days makes a likable (even if slightly arrogant) Manhattan ad-man Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) the object of a cross country spy hunt. Having no clue what is happening to him, Thornhill will be kidnapped by the spies, brought to an unknown mansion and after the questioning forced to get drunk. He will get arrested for a stealing a car and drunk driving of which he has no recollection. It is just the beginning. Next, he finds himself in the UN building talking to a man who drops dead in the middle of the conversation in front of hundreds of people. The worst part - the man is murdered and Thornhill has the murder weapon, the knife in his hand. Both, the police and the spies are on his trail and his only hope is to escape NYC by train where a very sexy blonde named Eve (Eva Marie Saint) is ready to help him. Their encounter leads to one of the sexiest scenes ever filmed without any sexual act involved.

The film is packed with the witty and funny dialogs and one- liners as well as with artful and imaginative set pieces including Grant running for his life across the prairie from an evil crop-duster and the climatic chase on Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock who always wanted to make a film with two scenes - a chase on the face of a president and the attempt to wake up the Peru Ambassador during the assembly in UN who turned to be dead, had his dreams fulfilled with ""North by Northwest"" which he suggested should be called ""The Man Who Sneezed in Lincoln's Nose"". Among many of film's pleasures are Eva Marie Saint as sexy stranger on a train and James Mason and young Martin Landau as a duet of villains with a complicated relationship.",1175212800,3,1961,4.429362880886426

There are great 'one-liners' and an unforgettable plane/human chase that helps this movie stand out as one of Hitchcock's greatest thrillers.

Do you want to know more? Well, the main character is Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant), an advertising executive that is mistaken for George Kaplan, a spy that supposedly works for the USA government. The problem is that he is wrongly identified by foreign spies working in America, who are extremely eager to kill him and not particularly predisposed to believe that he is, in fact, Roger O. Thornhill. That is the reason why Roger faces two choices: to run or to be killed. Needless to say, he embraces the first choice, running for his life whilst attempting to learn more about the real Mr. Kaplan. Roger will get unexpected help from a beautiful and mysterious woman, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). But is she with or against him?. And where on earth is George Kaplan?

The answers to those questions are likely to keep the spectator enthralled. Of course, the fact that ""North by Northwest""  has a great director, an outstanding cast, excellent musical score (Bernard Herrmann) and a fluid script (Ernest Lehman) doesn't hurt, either  :)  All in all, highly recommended!

A film by Alfred Hitchcock. It stars Cary Grant who is one of my favourite actors and Eva Marie

Saint. Grant plays the part of Robert  Thornhill who is an advertising executive in New York.

One day while waiting for a meeting he is mistaken by some people who  are in the smuggling

and spy game, headed by Phillip VanDamm played  nicely by James Mason.

Then starts a 3000 mile chase across the United States with Grant  trying to figure out the puzzle

he has found himself in mistaken for  a Mr.. Kaplin who was a fictitious character created by US

intelligence  agents to trap VanDamm.

He meets up with double agent Eve Kendall played by Eva Marie Saint  and falls head over heels

for her. They begin their ""affair"" on a train  of all places where Grant does his best to hide from

the train conductor  while still traveling and a really nice conversation over a dinner scene.

The movie then goes to various locations including a road in the country where Grant is crop

dusted by a crop duster plane. He steals a car to get back to the city when the plane crashes

into a truck while trying to attack him on the ground. He does so because when the crash

happens some spectators stop by to have a look.

Back in the city he manages to find Eve Kendall again and then resume his adventure,

mainly to find out what is going on. The next big set piece is a precarious climb up to

a house on the top of Mount Rushmore. It's a great scene and concludes the movie

WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT - - THE $4,000,000 BARGAIN OF 1959!

Mistaken identity is taken about as far afield as it can go, with some wrinkles thrown in, like murder, attempted murder, love, betrayal, and plot twists on plot twists. Add to this, the pace of this film really books!

THE HITCHCOCK TRADEMARK TAKES CENTER-STAGE: GOOD GUY WITH A FLAW - ENTER R.O.T.

Just like Janet Leigh's character in ""Psycho"" and James Stewart's character in ""Vertigo"", the hero in ""North-By-Northwest"" has a character flaw that's going to cost him big. In Roger O. Thornhill's case he makes a living by capricious, harmless ""exaggeration"". He is in advertising and in this movie everything that happens to him seems like sensationalism, hyperbole, misrepresentation, stretching the truth, a whopper, overkill, and a lot of bull. All of which are synonyms for ""exaggeration"", how R.O.T. describes his occupation to put a fine point on it. The effect of this kind of literary justice is to put R.O.T. in a position where he must examine his soul and decide to take a position rather than a viewpoint. In doing this, he reaches a well-earned epiphany for both himself and his patient audience. In the end, his life is not only restored but is new and improved, as they say in advertising, with Eva Marie Saint becoming Mrs. Thornhill as his reward for sincere caring and many unselfish acts. In the end, goodness becomes more than its own reward as it can only be counted on in fiction: ah, but such good fiction was this.

THE SETS - -

North-By-Northwest was filmed on many locations in the United States and made to look like many more. There are memorable scenes in the United Nations in New York, Chicago, Mount Rushmore and even on Long Island, not to mention on the train with Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant from New York to Chicago. There are On-Location shots and matte backgrounds depicting outdoor sets filmed in Hollywood at MGM. Many of the interesting and unusual sets are explained in the featurette, all of which are well done and are very useful and important to the film's realism, which remains surprisingly intact throughout all the permutations in the plot and scenery.

NICE SOUNDTRACK - -

LET'S NOT FORGET THE MARVELOUSLY DARK SOUNDTRACK by Bernard Herrmann which made long scenes like Grant's drunk-driving fiasco seem tense rather than tedious.

THE ACTORS - -

Cary Grant is Roger O. Thornhill, or is that George Kaplan? You'll have to see the film to know for sure. His mother, Clara Thornhill, played by Jesse Royce Landis, isn't even sure, it seems, when Grant's life has been hijacked apparently without cause. James Mason as Phillip Vandamm is the unconventional leader of an international spy ring that has just marked Cary Grant for death. Unfortunately for Grant, but fortunately for us, he has little in common with most action heros so his solutions are also a little unconventional and more sophisticated than the usual Hollywood hero's.

The result is fast-paced action entertainment that keeps the large, experienced cast of Hollywood veterans quite busy and the audience guessing.

IN THE END - -

Without a doubt, ""North-By-Northwest"" is my favorite Hitchcock film. For me, it is the Hitchcock film that stands up best to nearly a half century of repeated viewings. ""NORTH BY NORTHWEST"" is a case of the right men [Hitchcock & Grant] making a most entertaining 'Wrong Man' film.",1149465600,5,5309,5.079584775086505
113893,5,0790743213,"Movie buffs look for attractive leading ladies, handsome gentlemen, unpredictable suspense, or witty humor. Hitchcock makes no compromises in NORTH BY NORTHWEST.

Mistaken identity leads to life-threatening consequences as criminals seek to kill a government agent. Most people would be content to escape with their life but Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) wants justice. His tenaciousness leads to his being framed for murder. Fortunately the government is well aware of the facts. The solution, of course, is to hire him as the unwilling government agent he is assumed to be.

Sultry Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) is a trophy of conflicting agendas and men's desires. Dangerous Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) is not willing to share her and for the sake of Roger's life she tries not to be shared though the latter is her romance preference. Eve therefore becomes incentive for Roger to become an earnest agent on a mission to rescue the desire of his heart.

113894,4,0790743213,"Starting with a pale-green Leo the Lion (the trademark of MGM), Saul Bass creates a vibrant title sequence, seamlessly transitioning from an animated crisscrossing of animated black lines to a real-life skyscraper reflecting the bustling traffic of New York City below, all accompanied by Bernard Herrmann's most underrated musical score. This splendidly sets the stage for the fast-paced action of the film set to follow. It is here we meet Roger Thornhill, the protagonist of our story, played charismatically by Cary Grant, as he rushes to a business luncheon, dictating his memos to his secretary who is feverishly trying to keep up with him. Even from this brief encounter we can sense that Thornhill has an air of confidence about him (too much perhaps) and acts frivolously and boorish to anyone other then himself. To his loyal secretary he sums up the seemingly unethical life he leads, ""Ah, Maggie, in the world of advertising, there's no such thing as a lie. There's only the expedient exaggeration. You ought to know that"". It is ironic therefore that he should later be so trusting of Eve who in turn deceives him through `false advertising' and leaves him betrayed by her `expedient exaggerations'.

As Thornhill arrives for his business luncheon at the famous Plaza Hotel, he remembers that his mother is playing bridge at a friend's house at that very moment and she can not be contacted at home as he has instructed his secretary to do (to reminder of a play they are attending that evening at the Winter Garden Theatre). Unfortunately he remembers this small detail just as the taxi carrying her pulls away. A little annoyed, he shrugs it off and goes inside. It is however this minor detail that will set off a chain of events which will ultimately lead him to a ledge on Mount Rushmore, far from his laidback world in New York City. Before he conducts business with his clients at lunch, he calls for a busboy the precise moment a page for a Mr. `George Kaplan' is announced over the hotel's PA system. Two henchmen laying in wait for this `Kaplan' assume Thornhill is the man they are looking for and as soon as he walks away from his table to send a telegram to his mother, they grab him and take him off in a car to their boss's headquarters.

Grant's dry wit and acid humor is the driving force of this picture and it works expediently well. Upon hearing of a dinner party at the Townsend residence as he is dragged by the two henchmen to their boss's office he exclaims, ""By the way, what are we having for dessert?"" And when he is confronted by a man who claims to be Lester Townsend (later we learn that he is actually a foreign spy named Philip Vandamm who has taken up residence at the UN diplomat's home for the time being) about what he, or rather what Mr. Kaplan, knows he replies, ""Not that I mind a slight case of abduction now and then, but I have tickets for the theatre this evening, to a show I was looking forward to and I get, well, kind of unreasonable about things like that"". A tall glass of bourbon is then forced upon, making him entirely bombed. The two henchmen then plan to place him in a car and have Mr. `Kaplan' drive himself off a cliff. Things don't go quite as planned and somehow Thornhill is able to grab control of the wheel and drive manically through oncoming traffic. This as well as the booking scene which soon follows are classic. Seeing Grant, an actor notorious for his serious demeanor, pretend he's drunk is priceless.

Hitchcock manages to truly put himself into the mindset of his audience. Having just watched Thornhill weave intoxicated in and out of traffic, the precise moment we query to ourselves as to where a police officer is during all of this, a police car's sirens blare as he is in pursuit of Thornhill.

Having been made a fool of by his abductors (when Thornhill returns to the Townsend residence with his lawyer, mother, and two police detectives in tow to investigate his claim, Mrs. Townsend - in reality Vandamm's sister - greets Roger Thornhill as Mr. Kaplan and coyly insists that Kaplan became quite drunk at their little dinner party the other night), he returns to the Plaza Hotel and breaks into Mr. Kaplan's hotel room to see who this man truly is. He is then chased by the same two henchmen who abducted him the night before from the hotel to the United Nations Assembly Building where Lester Townsend works. However the man he meets is not the same man who had him abducted at the Plaza Hotel. Suddenly, a knife is thrown into the back of Mr. Townsend (presumably aimed for Roger Thornhill but missed) and coincidently (wink-wink) a photographer is right there in the Assembly Building to `capture' Thornhill holding the murder weapon in his hand and standing over the victim's body. Not only does Thornhill have to track down this George Kaplan and figure out why these foreign spies want him disposed of, he must also clear his name of a murder he did not commit, all while avoiding the detection of either the police or the foreign assassins.

After learning that Kaplan is headed for the Hotel Ambassador East in Chicago, Illinois, Thornhill decides to pursue this mysterious man and clear him name. In a quick call to his mother Thornhill tries to convince her that for a man on the run from the law traveling by train is safer then flying. ""Well, because there's no place to hide on a plane if anyone should recognize me...oh, you want me to jump off a moving plane?"" which is of course a foreshadowing of the famous crop-dusting sequence later on. Recognized by the sales clerk working at the ticket counter booth, he successfully sneaks aboard the train destined for Chicago and is concealed from detection by the police by a platinum blonde bombshell named Eve Kendell, played scintillatingly by Eva Marie Saint, who he bumps into on his way aboard the train.

The two meet again a few moments later at dinner (we later learn that Eve tipped the waiter five dollars to seat him with her if he entered the dining car). Roger and Eve, perceptibly attracted to one another, exchange sexual innuendos over dinner. She reveals to Thornhill that she knows exactly who he is and what he is accused of, but she doesn't care. He asks her why. She responds, ""It's going to be a long night"" and that she doesn't ""particularly like the book"" she's started. Inquiring as to whether he has picked up on her sexual proposition, he replies, ""Uh, let me think. Yes, I know exactly what you mean..."" She then invites him to her drawing room in Car 3901 (a reference of course to Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps which this film is modeled after) where further double entendres are made by the two lovers to make the censors squirm. As they kiss passionately, she lets him know that she's `a big girl' to which he responds, ""Yeah, and in all the right places too"". Wanting to know more about him, acknowledging his taste in clothes and food, he quickly retorts, ""...and taste in women. I like your flavor"". However, Hitchcock bows to the censors and forces Thornhill to sleep on the floor.

Easily one of the most identifiable sequences not only of director Alfred Hitchcock's career but in all of motion picture history, the crop-dusting scene in North-by-Northwest is magnificently choreographed to the hilt. Roger Thornhill, traveling by bus so as to ensure that he is alone, is led to a desolate cornfield in Illinois under the pretext that he will be Kaplan. In reality this is merely a bluff, a plot by the foreign spy organization to lure Thornhill into a false sense of security and eliminate him with the least amount of witnesses as possible. However, Hitchcock does not simply deliver the sequence to the audience, Heaven no. He builds us up with excitement and anticipation when the moment finally arrives. He does so by having Cary Grant stand alone on a deserted dirt road while cars pass by occasionally. Does Kaplan actually exist? If so, will he show? And then what? The tension builds. Suddenly a car drops a man off on the other side of the dirt road and takes off. Is this Kaplan? Hitchcock couldn't make it that easy, could he? He must be an assassin then. But before we even have time to query our suspicions, the man points out to Thornhill that the crop-duster across the way is dusting a field with no crops. As soon as the man boards a bus and is out of sight, the crop-duster proceeds to terrorize Thornhill by running him down. He hides in the cornfield to no avail; the plane sprays the crops with poisonous pesticides, forcing Thornhill out into the open. Thornhill successfully flags down a gasoline truck just in the nick of time, causing the crop-duster to swerve out of control and crash head-on into the gasoline truck, creating a marvelous explosion.

After tracking down Eve at the Hotel Ambassador East, the same hotel George Kaplan was suppose to be staying at (`Kaplan' supposedly checked out a full two hours before Eve called his hotel room and claimed that she had arranged a meeting between him and Thornhill - the encounter with the crop-duster in the cornfield), he pursues her to an auction where he is confronted by Vandamm and his two henchmen. He provokes a fight and uses the police escort to escape Vandamm's henchmen who were lying in wait for him. He is then taken to an airport where a kindly ol' man referred to as the Professor brings him up-to-date on the situation (Eve, Vandamm's lover, was recruited by the C.I.A. to spy on Vandamm who in reality is a foreign spy trafficking government secrets in and out of the country - `importer/exporter' as the Professor refers to his occupation as which is a coy reference to `The Man Who Knew Too Much'). Realizing Eve may be exposed and presumably killed by Vandamm, he flies out to Rapid City, confront Eve, and pretends to be critically wounded by her (a gun loaded with blanks) so as to convince Vandamm Eve is still on his side.

Leonard, one of Vandamm's henchmen, doesn't trust Eve and for good reason. Vandamm on the other hand believes him to be jealous of his mistress, clearly a homosexual allusion. ""You know what I think? I think you're jealous. No, I mean it. I'm very touched, very"". Leonard then exposes Eve for the fraud she is, firing her gun with blanks straight at Vandamm. He is of course left unharmed but stunned and (emotionally) hurt. He knows what he must do, choosing to throw her off the plane as soon as they are over water.

The crescendo of crescendos in North-by-Northwest is the chase scene on top of (what appears to be) Mount Rushmore (but because the government would not allow the famous director to shoot such a sequence on top of a national monument, gigantic busts created on a soundstage out in California and rear projections were used instead). The film ends with a scene in which Eve, dangling dangerously over the edge of Mount Rushmore, struggling to hold on to Thornhill's hand transitions immediately to him pulling her up to their compartment bed aboard a train heading east after they are married. It properly sums up the entire atmosphere of the film - sadly and deliciously absurd (to quote the federal agent earlier in the film, ""It's so horribly sad. How is it I feel like laughing?"").",1146096000,3,11227,4.651385390428212
113895,4,0790743213,"Starting with a pale-green Leo the Lion (the trademark of MGM), Saul Bass creates a vibrant title sequence, seamlessly transitioning from an animated crisscrossing of animated black lines to a real-life skyscraper reflecting the bustling traffic of New York City below, all accompanied by Bernard Herrmann's most underrated musical score. This splendidly sets the stage for the fast-paced action of the film set to follow. It is here we meet Roger Thornhill, the protagonist of our story, played charismatically by Cary Grant, as he rushes to a business luncheon, dictating his memos to his secretary who is feverishly trying to keep up with him. Even from this brief encounter we can sense that Thornhill has an air of confidence about him (too much perhaps) and acts frivolously and boorish to anyone other then himself. To his loyal secretary he sums up the seemingly unethical life he leads, ""Ah, Maggie, in the world of advertising, there's no such thing as a lie. There's only the expedient exaggeration. You ought to know that"". It is ironic therefore that he should later be so trusting of Eve who in turn deceives him through `false advertising' and leaves him betrayed by her `expedient exaggerations'.

As Thornhill arrives for his business luncheon at the famous Plaza Hotel, he remembers that his mother is playing bridge at a friend's house at that very moment and she can not be contacted at home as he has instructed his secretary to do (to reminder of a play they are attending that evening at the Winter Garden Theatre). Unfortunately he remembers this small detail just as the taxi carrying her pulls away. A little annoyed, he shrugs it off and goes inside. It is however this minor detail that will set off a chain of events which will ultimately lead him to a ledge on Mount Rushmore, far from his laidback world in New York City. Before he conducts business with his clients at lunch, he calls for a busboy the precise moment a page for a Mr. `George Kaplan' is announced over the hotel's PA system. Two henchmen laying in wait for this `Kaplan' assume Thornhill is the man they are looking for and as soon as he walks away from his table to send a telegram to his mother, they grab him and take him off in a car to their boss's headquarters.

Grant's dry wit and acid humor is the driving force of this picture and it works expediently well. Upon hearing of a dinner party at the Townsend residence as he is dragged by the two henchmen to their boss's office he exclaims, ""By the way, what are we having for dessert?"" And when he is confronted by a man who claims to be Lester Townsend (later we learn that he is actually a foreign spy named Philip Vandamm who has taken up residence at the UN diplomat's home for the time being) about what he, or rather what Mr. Kaplan, knows he replies, ""Not that I mind a slight case of abduction now and then, but I have tickets for the theatre this evening, to a show I was looking forward to and I get, well, kind of unreasonable about things like that"".

I won't summarize the plot of this one.  I will say though that the pacing is leisurely, the story interesting, the performances all strong.  I particularly liked Martin Landau.  And James Mason has a voice that makes everything he say sound like Shakespeare.

But who I really love is Cary Grant.  Man, that guy was one cool cat.  Even when he's being hunted by spies, he's still relaxed and continental and witty.  I would've given the movie 4 stars but Landau, Mason, and Grant push it easily into five.

If you don't need a car chase or gun fight every five minutes then this is a very good movie.  It doesn't always make sense.  I mean, who would use a cropduster-mounted machine gun to kill a guy when you could just drive by and shoot him?  But who cares.  It's got style, class, and some very witty dialogue.

This is an Alfred Hitchcock movie. Hitchcock is regarded by many as the best movie-maker of the twentieth century. Furthermore, NBNW is is not just any Hitchcock movie, it's generally considered one of his best.

The story begins with a classic case of mistaken identity in which our hero (played by Cary Grant) gets caught up in a case of international espionage. As the story unfolds, it's hard to be sure who can be trusted and who can't. The plot twists and turns, carrying the viewer on a roller-coaster ride from city to countryside and from the east coast to the Dakotas. The cast is excellent, several of the scenes are among the most memorable in cinematic history, the background scenery is often spectacular, and the music builds on the story's shifting moods extremely well.

NBNW is a genuine Hollywood classic. The American Film Institute currently has in the fortieth position on its list of the 100 greatest movies and it's in the fourth spot in the sub-category of the 100 greatest movie thrillers.

Alfred Hitchcock made a slew of great movies. While a few (i.e. PSYCHO, THE BIRDS) are probably better known, NBNW and REAR WINDOW are my personal favorites. Both are simply excellent. Coincidentally, the proprietors of this web page are currently offering NBNW and REAR WINDOW together as a package deal. If I didn't already own both flicks, I'd be all over that. So, this is your chance to pick up two great movies in one quick purchase. My advice? Don't miss out. Get both. You won't be sorry.",1129766400,,1709,4.724832214765101
113922,5,0790743213,"If you were going to leave ten movies in a time capsule for future generations to see what movies were all about (I know you've played this game before) ""North by Northwest"" should be somewhere near the top.

I forget where I read this but Hitchcock's resume for films goes back to the 20's when he was one of the early craftsman who worked with a moving camera. You know they did have talkies at that time and drama but up to that point it was all done with a stationary camera.

So the old professor really had done it all when he came upon the series of movies which made him famous. This was preceded with the sexy, scary-as-hell ""Rear Window"" with Jimmy Stewart, who along with Grant might have been Hitchcock's other favorite leading man. While Stewart (very courageous man but that's another story) lacked Grant's debonaire good looks and savoir faire, he was (Stewart) ordinary looking and Grant on the other hand could play ordinary.

Here in NBNW Grant as Roger Thornhill, just on the wagon, obedient to his Mom even though he's in his 40's, gets mistaken for a double agent by the ever sinister James Mason and we're off to the races. We see the old airports, Love Field and the old American Airlines Eagle as Roger and Eve Marie Saint and Mason and Martin Landau chase each other over the 1950 terrain of the USA.

The remarkable thing about Hitchcock is his relentless presentation of the average guy caught in events way, way over his head. Brilliant movie. Brilliant cast. Brilliant Director, really, never to be replaced. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1128988800,4,1564,4.635379061371841
113923,5,0790743213,"The period betweeen 1958 and 1963 was perhaps the most productive time in Alfred Hitchcock's career. In those five years, he made what are arguably his four greatest films: ""Vertigo"", ""North By Northwest"", ""Pyscho"" and ""The Birds"". It's hard tp pick which one of those films is THE best, but I think those are his four best films.

The second movie in that quartet, ""North By Northwest"" is the subject of this review. Cary Grant reteams with Hitchcock for his fourth and last film with the Master of Suspense to play Roger Thornhill, a Manhattan advertising exec who is mistaken for a spy and is kidnapped by an organization trying to shut him up. Their leader (a menacing James Mason) as well as his ruthless henchmen (includign a young Martin Landou) will stop at nothing to see Thornhill out of the way, as he frames him for murder, chased across the country, and in one of the finest and most parodied scenes in motion picture history, nearly mowed down by a crop duster. To elude from harm, he enlists the help of beautiful counterspy Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). However, the enemies get wind of this, and now are more forceful than ever. This leads to an unforgettable climax atop Mount Rushmore.

Well, wow. This film is incredible. Cary Grant's performance in this film may well be the best of his career. The same can be said for Eva Marie Saint and James Mason. Hitchcock's work behind the camera is very creative. His directing for the crop duster scene is, shot for shot, perfect. The extras are excellent.

113926,5,0790743213,"The review is for the Warner Brothers DVD released in 2004.

North by Northwest is a timeless classic involving action, adventure, drama, suspense and even some well-timed comedy, all rooted from a simple case of mistaken identity.  Cary Grant stars as Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue executive, who is accidentally mistaken for a secret government agent named George Kaplan.  Thornhill's main adversary is a spy for a foreign government named Phillip Vandamm (James Mason).  Along the way, Thornhill meets a beautiful blond named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who adds a lot of sex appeal along with several surprises to this wild and wonderful plot.

The movie is masterpiece for numerous reasons.  The first reason is because of the some of the unforgettable action shots including Grant being attacked by a crop dusting plane in a remote cornfield and then being chased across the face of Mount Rushmore.  But beyond just the action, there many brilliant scenes where Grant either alludes the people tracking him or simply just outsmarts them and does some impressive detective work on his own.  The script oozes with witty and clever lines with many visually memorable scenes as well.  Another strength of the movie is a powerful music score that accentuates every crucial moment in the film.  Furthermore, Grant and Mason give outstanding performances, perhaps their best.  The movie also breaks out of the old Hollywood overly restrained romance situations with some very forward dialogue and some sexually suggestive scenes between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint (but still extremely tame by today's standards).  Finally, the widescreen color presentation is nothing short of spectacular.  Not only is this Hitchcock's best, but from my personal viewpoint, it ranks #4 on my list of the greatest movies ever made behind Casablanca and The Godfather I & II.  I have watched this movie at least six times over the past 25 years (now for the first time on DVD) and it still hasn't lost its edge.

As mentioned, the DVD quality is utterly fantastic for a film this old.  The widescreen color transfer is completely immaculate, and rich in color and sharpness - rivaling movies made today.  The sound is also outstanding for a film this old.  There many bonuses, but the best is the making of the film with a cross the country diary of how and where the movie was shot.  There is also a very good commentary by the Earnest Lehman who wrote the screenplay.

113928,3,0790743213,"I've watched Hitchcock's Rope, Rear Window, Psycho and Vertigo. Honestly, North by Northwest is perhaps the least bright among all. It doesn't have the suspense of Psycho, camera-work of Vertigo, smart setup as Rear Window and witty banter as Rope. In fact, with the blockbuster movie like that, I'm surprised at the slow moving storyline, even the explosion of the airplane was not thrilling.

I'm not going to give a summary of the movie since others have done it aptly, but there are flaws in the movies which they fail to point out; the most obvious one is that the movie did not once attempt to explain why the thugs think that Cary Grant is an FBI agent. Sure, it was a case of mistaken identity, but why him in particular?

Also, there were some parts, which are unneccessary at all, and would not suffer if they were edited out; all the better they should be edited out because it would only slow the pace of the over-2-hour movie. Such scenes, I can easily think of, are the scenes with Cary Grant waiting in the open fields, as if he was cruising.

Hitchcock seems to want to play with the Oedipal relationship between Cary Grant's character and his mother but this doesn't seem to work out. The relationship has only slight undertones of Oedipal, yet it offers no insight to Grant's character development and it doesn't carry through the movie. The mother disappears 1/3 through the movie, as if there wasn't such a character at all. The Oedipal relationship is, in another words, quite useless to the development of the plot.

Not Hitchcock's finest.",1122422400,5,1562,4.689781021897811
113929,5,0790743213,"Common language philosophers talk about ""operant definitions"" in that something is as it operates. While on the outset I never thought of North by Northwest earth-shattering by any means, it must be one of my favorites as I have seen it more often than any other movie I can think of, barring my known favorite - Being There.

Since the movie really snuck up on me as one of my all time favorites it is hard to say just what I like about it. It is a fast paced thriller, sure, but so are many other movies that don't qualify. It is alternatively funny, thrilling, suspenseful, and has good acting and, of course, excellent directing and artful cinematography.

Maybe it's all in a nutshell. The period of Hitchcock from Rope to N by NW all have worlds I'd like to live in, despite whatever ""bad"" thing is going on. I would just love to be in any one of the worlds created, the coloring, the pacing, the people - I'd love to be ROT, subtracting the spies. I'd love to live in the house on the cliff side, I'd love to ""ride the train"" with Eva Marie Saint. Similarly I'd love to be independently wealthy and living in the penthouse in Rope, or the curious tableau created for Rear Window, or on the Riviera in To Catch a Thief.

So I get drawn in every time. To be witty and urbane and bag hot babes is paid for with some spies and more spies. Hmmmmmm....maybe it is an even trade....",1121644800,,1382,4.3076923076923075
113930,5,0790743213,"I hold this to be Alfred Hitchcock's finest film, but to say that rather shortchanges the British genius as it happens to be one of the greatest movies of all time.  North by Northwest is what I would call ""old school cool,"" and there has never been, before or since, a more charming or likeable actor than Cary Grant.  I dare anybody to take their eyes off this one--even to go to the bathroom.  This marks the third time I've seen it and I found it just as fulfilling as the two before it.

James Mason was an amazing actor and I'd place him just below Olivier on the talent meter.  Here he plays a perfect nemesis for Grant as a foreign agent who ""imports/exports"" information to the east during The Cold War.  In this role, Mason is quite believeable.

Eva Marie Saint is exceptional and the love that develops between herself and Grant is something that the audience readily buys into.  There's nothing contrived about their relationship.  It makes the movie just as much a romance as a thriller.

Unlike the movies fabricated today, there is no sex or nudity to be seen here, but we are made to fully understand the emotions of the characters.  The dialogue between Grant and Saint is absolutely precious, particularly when they meet on the train and speak in the dining car.  Words like these are seldom heard in the movies of the present: ""How does a girl like you get to be a girl like you?""  And my favorite:

""Men like you don't believe in marriage.""

""But I've been married twice.""

""See what I mean.""

One wishes that some of these exchanges were examined before screenplays were stamped out in this new century.

The entire movie is shot in the ""man alone"" motif as Grant, ala Gary Cooper, stands up to forces far superior than himself.  His resourcefulness is the glue that binds the plot together. This advertising executive is quite successful in outpacing East German (presumably) agents and the police who are out to hang him. The ending is marvelous but, of course, in case you're one of the rare people who has never seen it, I will not give the climax away.",1118880000,2,2079,4.540322580645161

113942,4,0790743213,"It's one of Hitchcock's later movies. He puts his signature cameo in the first few minutes of the movie, so people will get on with watching it instead of playing the ""where's Waldo"" game of finding him.

It's also an American classic. Some of the scenes have truly become part of the culture's visual memory: the crop-duster chase, climbing across Mt. Rushmore, and of course the train and tunnel. It's a good action movie, 1950s style, with Cary Grant - what more needs to be said?

Here in the next century, perhaps a few more things. This is remarkable as an artifact of the cold war, which provided entire basis for the plot. It's also noteworthy as a snapshot of 1950s style. I don't just mean clothes, though the women's styles have a quaint look now. I mean the railroad sleeper cars (do they even exist now?), the Prairie School architecture as the height of sophistication, and the morals of a simpler era. I'm also interested in that chase across that most reconizable of American monuments, as if the gunfire represented an attack on all of America's citizens at once. Well, I guess that's how the Cold War eye really saw the world.

Among Hitchcock's movies, it's not the one that builds tension the best - ""The Birds"" is a lot more nerve-wracking, for example. It's still a good one, for itself and for the 1950s sensibility that it has frozen in time.

113945,5,0790743213,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"" is simply one of the finest American films ever made. It is a great example of the skill and mastery that Hitchcock exhibited throughout his career. If you think back, there are few directors that have had as much success as Hitch did throughout his career.

Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is involved in the Madison Avenue ad business. What does he do? It's unimportant, so we don't find out if he is President, an Ad Executive or in the mail room. He is quickly mistaken for George Kaplan, a man that some spies would like to have a word with. Forcibly transported to the estate of Lester Townsend, he is questioned by a man (James Mason). When Thornhill refuses to admit that he is Kaplan and tell them everything he knows, he is dispatched. He escapes and then sets out to figure out who George Kaplan is. Along the way, he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a beautiful blond, and she becomes his ally. Thornhill's journey takes him from New York, to Chicago, to a desolate corn field, to an art auction, to Rapid City, South Dakota, to the face of Mount Rushmore.

Simplicity is the key to this film and its extraordinary success. The story is convoluted and may be considered improbable, but who is to say it wouldn't happen? I can't say that, especially as it is set during the Cold War and I have heard of many stranger things happening. The story is also very simplistic. We don't learn anything we don't need to know, and, frankly, it is most refreshing. I mentioned that we don't really learn what Thornhill does. He is involved in the Advertising industry, that much is clear, and it helps set up his lifestyle and his character quickly and plainly.

As I watched the film again last night, another thing struck me. In many films today, the filmmaker treats the audience as though they have no attention span and little ability to think. They show us a key piece of evidence, show the character looking at it, show it going into a pocket, later show the character pulling it out of the pocket, looking at it again, getting someone else to look at it again, and then getting some feedback. Each of these acts produces a view of the item in question for the audience. There is a sequence in ""North By Northwest"" which I want to use to illustrate how Hitchcock did this very differently. Thornhill and his mother (the very funny Jessie Royce Landis, actually only a year older than Grant), visit Kaplan's hotel room at the Plaza. There, Thornhill spots a picture of a group of men which includes the man he thinks is Townsend (Mason), he points it out to his mother and the audience gets to see it. He puts it back on the desk and goes about his business. Later, as he is rushing out, he grabs the picture. Outside the hotel room, he slides it in his coat pocket. We don't see the picture again, but we know it is the same picture. Later at the United Nations, he pulls the picture out and shows it to someone else. Again, we know which picture it is, not because we have seen it again and again, but because Hitch has allowed us to see it once and we are intelligent enough to know what they are talking about.

""North By Northwest"" was made after ""Vertigo"" and before ""Psycho"". It makes perfect sense. ""Vertigo"" was reportedly a very personal film for Hitchcock. He put a lot of energy into the film was disconcerted when it did not receive the critical praise or box office that he felt it deserved. This is the first time that Hitchcock took the emphasis away from thrills and went for a more cerebral kind of suspense. He really delves into Scotty's obsessions and paranoia. It is a beautiful film and one of his best, but I can imagine that he was exhausted. It is pretty clear that Hitchcock was at the stage where he wanted to experiment a little. I can imagine that he probably felt that he should return to something that would help him get another hit. MGM purchased a book called ""The Wreck of The Mary Deare"". Hitch asked Ernest Lehman to adapt it for him. Lehman tried, but a few weeks later, he said he didn't know what to do with it. They talked a bit and then Hitchcock remarked that he always wanted to make a film with a chase across Mt. Rushmore. This single idea prompted Lehman to come up with, as he puts it, ""The Hitchcock film to end all Hitchcock films"". ""NbNW"" certainly explores territory that the director traveled before, but he brings a mastery to the work that sets this film head and shoulders above the rest. It certainly helps that Lehman created some of the best dialogue ever written. More on that later. So, while ""NbNW"" doesn't exactly push the boundaries of obsession that he was trying to reach with ""Vertigo"" or the psycho-sexual babble he tried to explore in ""Marnie"", it does examine the relationship of Thornhill and Kendall. In fact, the entire film is about relationships. The relationship between Thornhill and his mother leads him further into the mystery. Her mocking seems to make him more determined to prove he was abducted, pushing him further into the mystery. Thornhill's relationship with Kendall is erotic, intense and takes many turns, some of which take the story in new directions. Kendall's relationship with Vandamm is threatened by her relationship with Thornhill, causing Vandamm to doubt her sincerity. Vandamm and his henchman, Leonard, have a relationship that causes more friction between Vandamm and Kendall. The relationships in the film are the most intricately plotted part of the production.

Cary Grant has always been one of my favorite actors. He accomplished in his career what people like Schwarzenneger and Stallone are trying to do today. No, I am not comparing the two action stars to Cary Grant, but they are trying to break out of the action molds that they have created for themselves and lengthen their careers by trying other genres. Grant had great success in many genres. Of course, he was a handsome leading man in many romantic films. He also had great success in screwball comedies (""Arsenic and Old Lace"" and ""Bringing Up Baby""), War films (both serious and comedic) and thrillers (primarily, films he made with Hitchcock, but also notably ""Charade"", one of his last films). He was versatile and enjoyed a long career. If Lehman set out to make `The Hitchcock Film To End All Hitchcock Films', Hitchcock almost robbed Grant of one of his more memorable roles. They originally considered Jimmy Stewart. Someone suggested Grant and Grant received The Cary Grant Role to End All Cary Grant Roles. Grant is known for his great looks, his sexy accent, his suave character. These all fit perfectly in the role of Roger Thornhill.

Eva Marie Saint is one of the sexiest Hitchcock blondes, perhaps eclipsed only by Grace Kelly. Saint's portrayal of Eve Kendall pretty much defines what this type of character would be in hundreds of other films. She has to play both sides, never revealing too much to anyone, keeping her cool, trying not to fall in love. It is a difficult balance and Saint achieves it beautifully. She and Grant are so sexy together that it makes the films produced today look tame. In every one of their scenes, they are fully clothed, yet manage to create more sparks than any scene in which the actors are partially naked and simulating actual sex. In a couple of scenes, they spar verbally, flirting with each other. One of the sexiest kisses ever is captured in this film. They are kissing in Eve's train compartment and they move around each other, Thornhill's hands roaming all over Kendall.

As much as Saint creates a character that defines the role, Mason creates a villain that is very scary without ever using physical force. His voice is so rich and full of character that pretty much anything he says can be viewed as threatening and menacing. He seems the perfect characterization of a spy about to sell government secrets.

Martin Landau, in one of his first film roles, creates the role of Leonard, Vandamm's sidekick. Leonard is very devoted to his employer and dislikes Eve Kendall. There are slight homosexual overtones to the character which fit beautifully and help to further complicate the relationships in the film.

Hitchcock is a masterful director, but in the case of ""NbNW"", he had three very notable contributors. Ernest Lehman created a screenplay that is masterful in its simplicity. He created a story that is suspenseful, memorable and efficient. It moves from one point to the next, never boring us with details that we don't need to know. The dialogue in the film is perhaps the most memorable. Everything is slightly veiled. When Kendall and Thornhill are talking in the dining car, everything they say will eventually lead to their romantic evening. The dialogue is rich and entertaining. More importantly it is not cloying and sentimental. The dialogue also becomes threatening at the drop of a pin, as voice by Vandamm and Leonard.

Frequent Hitchcock contributor Bernard Hermann created one of his most rousing scores for ""North By Northwest"". What struck me when watching the film again is that there are very long passages with no music. You don't hear that in films produced today. John Williams and Ennio Morricone seem determined to prove their worth, overlaying every frame of film with music that is sure to evoke an emotion. In ""NbNW"", Hermann uses his music to accentuate the suspense or romance, not to substitute it.

The other contributor that deserves mention is Bob Boyle, the production designer. He and his team recreated Mount Rushmore in a studio and did a very good job. Just a few brief moments of the chase reveal that it is shot on a sound stage, remarkable really when you consider that none of it was actually shot on the monument.

The documentary included with the film is a treat in some ways and disappointing in others. It is great to see Eva Marie Saint again, very beautiful, narrating the documentary. It takes us step by step through the film and the sequence in which it was made. Some great production photos are used to illustrate. I found it disappointing that the documentary made various statements, but then provided no examples. For instance, at one point someone says that they felt tension between Hitch and Grant. Why?

""North By Northwest"" is my favorite Hitchcock film and certainly my favorite film. It is the first film I remember seeing in a movie theater, on the big screen. It is a perfect example of the magic that Hollywood can create. It is the perfect example of what Hitchcock could create, frightening us, thrilling us, captivating us.",1111622400,12,10587,4.719307733910222

113948,5,0790743213,"A sublime, suspenseful confection from Alfred Hitchcock, 1959's ""North by Northwest"" has become a classic addition to the master's canon even though it lacks the risk-taking gravity of his then-just-released ""Vertigo"" or the blood-curdling thrills of his next classic film, ""Psycho"". This stands the test of time as a sophisticated thriller that is alternately clever and contrived, fast-paced and glamorous.

It is the ideal showcase for the debonair but innately accessible Cary Grant, starring as the prototypical wronged man who unwillingly embarks on a perilous odyssey away from the comfortably insulated life he led. Grant seems to thrive best when his character, a successful Madison Avenue advertising executive named Roger Thornhill, is put in inexplicable situations that build into a series of unforeseen events leading ultimately to a seemingly conspiratorial group of spies and assassins by way of a variety of locales that includes Grand Central Station, the United Nations building and Mount Rushmore. For someone used to making up the ""truth"" in advertising copy for marketing purposes, Thornhill is vulnerable to his own medicine at a much higher cost...his life. After getting abducted by a pair of thugs, he is forced to drink a pint of bourbon under the mistaken assumption that he is a government undercover Federal agent. A murder frame-up follows, and then he is on the run as an implicated suspect. He takes on yet another identity while confronted with even more mayhem and a world of espionage, an unbelieving mother, and Eve Kendall, a mysterious blonde, played with surprising elan by Eva Marie Saint. One wonders why she didn't play more femme fatales during her career...she seems a natural at it. Is it all a little too far-fetched? You bet. But under Hitchcock's sure direction and recognizable visual style, it is also one of the most supremely entertaining of movies.

There are a plethora of memorable scenes, set pieces really for Hitchcock to concoct some suspense in order to showcase his unique visual style. These include the wonderful crop-dusting sequence where Thornhill tries to outrun a nefarious biplane into a dried-up cornfield, the knifing of the real Lester Townsend at the UN and the final scaling of Mount Rushmore's Presidential faces to escape the villains. That's where appropriately the final salvation occurs, and Thornhill and Kendall then end up in the upper berth of a Pullman car just as they started. The film is filled with many humorous touches such as Thornhill's drunken scene at the police station (preceded by a rather politically incorrect drunk driving chase sequence), the extended seduction scenes between Thornhill and Kendall on the train, the auction scene where Thornhill is trying to get captured by the police to avoid the spies, and his unexpected marriage proposal as the lovers hang precariously between Washington's and Jefferson's foreheads. James Mason lends his particular savoir faire to the role of duplicitous foreign spy Phillip Vandamm, and a young Martin Landau is appropriately sinister as the sexually questionable henchman, Leonard. Much of the credit for the film's success belongs to Ernest Lehman, who penned the original screenplay, and Bernard Herrmann for his atmospheric score.

113949,5,0790743213,"Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest is by far his best film.  The production, screenwriting, and musical score made this classic what it is after 45 years.  This film has indeed deserves its coveted place among the American Film Institute's 100 all-time best films.

The actors along with the plotline pulled the film off with flying colors.  However, Hitchcock uses the same cat and mouse espionage that he used in his earlier film, Saboteur,, which captured the fear and paranoia of World War II.  Despite that somewhat unoriginal film idea, Cary Grant, Eve Marie Saint, James Mason, and Martin Landau were quite convincing in this thriller of a film full of suspense and intrigue.  And the romance between marketing advertising executive,Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant),  and stranger on the train, Eve Kendall (Eve Marie Saint) did not hurt the film at all. What would a Hitchcock film be without that tinge of femininity and Eve Marie Saint's glowing profile?

This is one of those films where you're rooting for the ""good guy"" over the ""bad guys"".  Indeed, this film has political overtones of the Cold War and McCarthyism.  Could this be a film with nationalistic fervor?  Could this have been a film about US consumerism and the sinister USSR?  Possibly, but it's a ""hot"" picture amongst the ""coldness"" of the period.  It captures the American landscape with New York's metropolis, which includes the UN building.  In addition, the wheat fields of the Midwest to Mount Rushmore keeps you hanging at the edge of your seat; Cary Grant holds on to dear life both from a crazed-out cropdusting plane to the heads of Jefferson, T. Roosevelt, Lincoln,and Washington.

This film is perfect for the movie buff or anyone who enjoys watching a well-crafted film.  Indeed, the 1950s had not been all about the neat fixings of suburbia and ""Leave it to Beaver.""

113950,5,0790743213,"Many feel this is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest American movie, and I agree! NORTH BY NORTHWEST (NbyNW) is the Hitchcock film to end all Hitch films, with all his pet themes covered with maximum wit, panache, and suspense, as well as a romance between Cary Grant and a soigne Eva Marie Saint that's as tender as it is sexy. Grant has never been more engaging and dashing (literally and figuratively :-), though the smoothly villainous James Mason nearly out-suaves him. My hubby and I have joked that if Mason had played Thornhill, the film would have been over in mere moments; if the imperious, unshakably confident Mason asked the Glen Cove police, ""Do you honestly believe that this happened the way you think it did?"" they would immediately reply, ""No, sir, you must be right, you're free to go, sorry we bothered you."" :-) NbyNW also boasts a great early performance by a reptilian young Martin Landau as Mason's possessive henchman, as well as one of Oscar nominee Ernest Lehman's best screenplays (in fact, he borrowed liberally from it for his script for the film version of THE PRIZE starring Paul Newman) and one of Bernard Herrmann's finest scores. Anybody who wants to write or direct a chase thriller should watch NbyNW first to see how it's done, and the DVD is a great place to start with its superb extras, like the documentary and Lehman's commentary track!

113973,5,0790743213,"Alfred Hitchcock has thrown sarcasm, comedy, irony, romance, suspense, and an ingenious series of unfortunate events into a can, shook it up, and successfully came out with something that isn't fertilizer.  Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is one of the most clever movies I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.  Made in 1959, North by Northwest has yet to become out-dated.  It's full of action from start to finish, rivaling any modern movie.

 North by Northwest was truly ahead of its time.  Taking place in New York, Chicago, and South Dakota 1959, the movie is about Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant) whom is mistaken for a government agent who falls between investigations of U.S. intelligence traders.  A series of unfortunate events causes Thornhill to be set up for murder.  Now on the run from spies, counterspies, and the police, Thornhill falls for the very lustful Eve Candle (played by Eva Marie Saint) who is very questionable as to what intentions she has in store for Thornhill.  The movie is full of elaborate schemes, twists, and surprises.

 Roger Thornhill is the depiction of what every adolescent boy wants to grow up to be: confident, cocky, fearless, and un-shaken, with witty sarcastic one-liners that are even recognized by his own mother.  Cary Grant plays the hero of the film perfectly.  Eva Marie Saint's character plays the very flirtatious spy very well and looks even better.  The acting is very impressive in this film.  They all find subtleties to bring out the character's personality.  All the characters are unique and bring an individual presence to the movie.

 Adding to the actor's performances, the cinematography is also quite an advantage to make this movie great.  Most movie-goers are familiar with Alfred Hitchcock's style in camera angles, music, and the new features he brings to bring the full effect to life.  Comically, Hitchcock even put himself in the movie in the beginning shots of New York.  The music is fantastic and elevates the suspense for specific scenes.  Although most action scenes include the ol' blue screen, they don't seem all that cheesy and do not take away from the effect the scene is to bring.

 The movie has all the ingredients for a great action comedy.  The plot seems to come together so seamlessly that it appears almost ridiculous.  Ultimately the movie is quite brilliant to keep the audience on their feet and always second guessing.  A great script, great director, and wonderful acting have made this movie a must see.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys an action comedy.",1098316800,2,2583,4.958041958041958
113974,5,0790743213,"Some suspense movies you see just once, and once you know how it ends, never see it again.  Not so with ""North by Northwest"".  I have seen it countless times and know the whole script/lines (almost) by heart, yet I am sure I will see it again and again in the future.  This is the mark of a truly GREAT film. The action starts almost immediately as the bad guys page a Mr. Kaplan in the bar of the Plaza Hotel. Coincidentally, Cary Grant gets up from his table at the same time to make a phone call to his mother. He is escorted out by the bad guys who mistakenly think he is Mr. Kaplan, and the fun begins.  The action is non-stop until the end of the film, with the now famous scene atop Mt. Rushmore.  The scene where the crop duster ... oops, I don't want to give it away!

But even if I did, I'm sure you'd want to see this film over and over, just like me.  The cast is outstanding: Eva Marie Saint, Leo G. Carroll (perfectly droll in this role), Martin Landau in an early appearance, and of course, the menacing, but ever so sophisticated, bad guy, James Mason.  The two English accents in this film give it a special panache and international intrigueness (is that a word?), that just adds to the fun.  The script by Ernest Lehman and the sensationally suspenseful music by Bernard Hermann just add to the the edge of your seat suspense.

And last but not least, Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, has definitely not directed a better film.  Cary Grant standing by the side of the road in his gray suit in the middle of the prairie is one of the great shots in film history.

113975,5,0790743213,"Hitchcock liked working with Cary Grant and James Stewart. Any of his movies that have either of these stars were exceptional and could be viewed by the whole family. These movies always dealt more with suspense than showing blood and gore. North By Northwest is one of the most suspenseful of his movies and it has a good romance story to boot. Cary Grant is magnificent playing the innocent bystander caught up in a grand scheme of espionage.

Eva Marie Saint is wonderful as the romantic interest that is a unknown factor. Is she a spy for the bad guys or is she on the side of justice? This movie also contained some wonderful scenery and sets. The Biplane and Mt. Rushmore scenes have some of his greatest camera work ever. The angles used are extremely effective in making you feel you are there. Bernard Herrman's beautiful haunting music adds to the suspense and helps to make this movie a classic Hitchcock.",1096588800,,916,4.654320987654321

Couple that with a terrific cast, dynamite story, immortal one-liners, some great scenes in actual locations, and classic Hitchcock editing and you have a shoe-in on any ""best of all time list"". This movie was made in 1958 and although it was current in it's day, it now is just as current as a period film set in 1958, keeping in mind of the political climate and cold war attitudes of the time. The costumes are very natural, having been bought in actual New York stores, and the set designs are beautifully designed. The set decoration is also first rate.
This DVD is a superb transfer. The color looks perfectly natural, the sound is full, low noise stereo and the widescreen is anamorphic. There is hardly any flaw in the print. Amazing. The menu is also animated to match the Saul Bass opening title and is wonderful. The ""making of"" film (30 minutes long) is superb and hosted by beautiful leading lady ""Eve Marie Saint"".
Finally, the score by Bernard Hermann adds to the high tension of the action. The orchestration and performance on this film is one of the very best of all time.

He gets mistaken for a spy and is sent on a chase accross the country to 1.) avoid being caught 2.) Find out what the heck is going on and 3.) Fix what is going on.  There are many classic scenes like the crop dusting plane not dusting any crops but chasing after him.  And the Mount Rushmore chase scene.

A good cast, with veteran actors and a compelling story.  A young advertising executive (Grant) gets caught up in a case of mistaken identity, and is forced to go on the run with his life threatened in the process.  The police are after him, and a spy (Mason)and his friends are trying to kill him.

There are some good twists in the plot, and some great shots of South Dakota's famous monument, carved out of Mount Rushmore by Gutzon Borglund with dynamite.  Lots of suspense, entertaining adventure (airplane shots) in the corn fields of Iowa (apparently).  Eva Marie Saint provides a good love interest.

A very entertaining film about cold war spies, well acted, plotted, and directed.  Easy five stars.

The sublime confluence of Hitch's masterful directing, Cary Grant's suave (and humorous) acting, the beautiful and charming (and not to mention smoothly debonair) Eva Marie Saint, the cunningly clever screenplay, singularly superb setting (including the thrilling climax at Mt. Rushmore as well as the iconic scene of the cropduster buzzing Grant in the middle of nowhere), and, of course, the exceptional music score all help immeasurably in molding the aesthetic dynamic and, in essence, make the film what it is - a certifiable masterpiece.
One note of interest: on the train ride when they first meet, Eva Marie Saint's line to Cary Grant of ""I never discuss love on an empty stomach"" is actually dubbed over the originally spoken line of ""I never make love on an empty stomach"" in acquiescence to the studio suits.",1086048000,,878,5.013698630136986

BUT THEN, I saw it on the new DVD version and the beautiful scenes were back and the splendid background music by Bernard Herrmann that Hitchcock used so perfectly in many of his best films was back in abundance.

This movie has so many twists and turns, you don't know what you're going to get yourself into next.
Filmed in different locations throughout the country, the story takes the audience on a ride of comedy, mystery, and suspense.  Cinematography doesn't get any better than this film.  Several scenes use wonderful camera angles and cuts to enhance the feeling of suspense.
The movie also has some very memorable characters, such as Cary Grant's character, Thornhill, Eva St. Marie's Eva Kendall, and my favorite, the evil Leonard played by Martin Landau (He is so creepy in this).

Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant in his final Hitchcock movie)is a New York businessman with the most boring life in the world. That all changes when he is mistaken for a spy named George Kaplan and kidnapped bya much of gun - toting henchmen working for a delightfully devillish James Mason. He esacpes, and is soon framed for murder at the UN. He avoids the law by travelling cross - country on a train, during which he meets a sexy stranger (Eva Marie Saint).

Romance ensues amid continuing skullduggery. There are several unforgettable scary thriller scenes, including the chase by a plane in the middle of a cornfield and the final beauty on the face of Mt.

The storyline was great. The jokes were funny. And the romance was believable. I'm not used to seeing Cary Grant so taken with the lead actresses. He usually seems so aloof and indifferent to their advances. But the chemistry in North by Northwest was good between Grant and Eva Marie Saint.
The story line was fun. This is one of Grant's better ones. And one of Hitchcock's better ones, too. The bad guys were excellent as well.",1068076800,,443,4.6923076923076925
114011,5,0790743213,"One of Hitch's best and most effortless suspense movies has the benefit of a brilliant, witty script by the late Ernest Lehman and star performances by Cary Grant as the put upon Thornhill (whose initials are R.O.T. a nice representation of what's happened to his world), the sexy Eva Maire Saint, the menacing Martin Landau (in his first film role)and the charming but deadly James Mason.

Grant plays Thornhill an advertising executive who, through a case of mistaken identity (he raises his hand calling for someone to come take a telegram at the exact moment that a telegram is announced for Mr. Kaplan). As a result, he's kidnapped, taken to the country retreat of a diplomat by the name of Vandamm. Vandamm (Mason)believes that undercover agent Kaplan has too much information about his spy ring and plans.

He has his men get Thornhill drunk and they put him behind the wheel so he can have a fatal auto accident. Fortunately, Thornhill survives. He's determined to find out who Kaplan is and what Vandamm really wants. From there Thornhill's life spirals out of control as Vandamm tries to have him killed during the famous cropdusting sequence and convince his lover Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint)to become involved with him and, later, betray him. There's so many twists and turns in this hairraising classic that you have to see the film to appreciate the beauty of the direction, writing and performances.

This new spruced up digital transfer looks terrific. Warner evidently had the film digitally restored (not quite as painstaking as the restoration for Vertigo, Rear Window and Lawrence of Arabia but considerably less expensive)so that the colors are closer to the original release prints from 1959. The soundtrack has been beautifully remixed for 5.1 Dolby Digital. While the soundtrack can't completely take advantage of the remix, it sounds terrific. There's also a really good feaurette on the making of the film featuring Landau, Saint, Lehman and Patricia Hitchcock.

The inclusion of Ernest Lehman's nicely detailed audio commentary is a nice extra as well although it's clear that some of the same comments show up again in the documentary.  Bernard Herrmann's marvelous music score is isolated on one track so that music fans can hear the original score in all its glory.

North by Northwest was the next to last in a string of classics directed by Hitch during the 60's (Hitch only made one movie in the 60's that comes close to his best films and that's the brilliant, dark The Birds). After a string of great movies and box office smashes including Rear Window, To Catch A Thief, Vertigo, The Trouble With Harry, Strangers On A Train and other lesser known works, North By Northwest was a brilliant conclusion to a decade that showed enormous growth in Hitch's directing ability and style. Psycho which would come out the following year would continue Hitch's groundbreaking approach to cinema as well but North by Northwest was the last of Hitch's complex thrillers to capture the public's attention.",1067731200,2,3030,4.99009900990099
114042,5,0790743213,"Isn't it interesting that the two best movies made by the great Alfred Hitchcock both starred Cary Grant?  He plays completely different roles in the two films.  In Notorious (Hitchcock's best movie) he is a sullen, lovestruck, jealous fiend who drives Ingrid Bergman into the arms of another man, using the love she feels for him and not confessing his love for her until it is almost too late and she is almost dead.
However, in North by Northwest, he plays a funny, completely clueless advertising man who gets caught up in espionage within the first five minutes of the movie.  He is mistaken for a spy who is trailing a man named Van Damme (James Mason)  Grant is not a spy at all, but Van Damme won't hear any of that and attempts to kill him.
Grant gets away, of course and then the fun begins.  He tries to figure out what's going on and who the spy really is and Mason tries to get rid of him.  The ride takes you from Manhattan on a 2,000 mile trip to the face of Mount Rushmore.  Along the way, Grant meets a woman (Eva Marie Saint) who may not be who she seems to be, even when you think you have it figured out.
The film is littered with reliable supporting actors including the hilarious Jessie Royce Landis as Grant's mother.  She absolutely steals her scenes early in the movie.  Leo G. Carroll, a Hitchcock regular, shows up to provide the movie's most critical information, and finally, a very young Martin Landau is James Mason's second hand henchman.
The famous scenes from this movie are the crop dusting scene featured on the cover of the DVD and the final chase on the Mt Rushmore face.  However, the whole movie is great to watch.  The story is just unbelievable enough to laugh at, but realistic enough to take seriously as well.  Grant is fabulous here, having lots of fun with the situations presented.
This movie is really atypical for Hitchcock, who was more about what happens in the mind than action on the screen. (See Notorious or Vertigo, possibly his most cerebral film)  Even movies like Psycho were more inside the head than the physical action (save the two gruesome murders)  But not North by Northwest.  There really isn't anything to figure out, it's just great actors going at breakneck speed for two hours and 16 minutes to duke it out on the face of Mount Rushmore.  What more can you ask for?",1063756800,3,2337,4.502369668246446
114043,4,0790743213,"Cary Grant did well in Hitchcock's thrillers as his usual suave self, that playing himself to perfection.  North By Northwest makes Grant's fourth and last Hitchcock film, the others being Suspicion, Notorious, and To Catch A Thief.  In this one, he plays Roger Thornhill, who early in the film is mistaken by some sinister men for a certain George Caplan, a double agent.  He is unexpectedly hijacked and taken to a manor house, and interrogated by two men, a Mr. Townsend (James Mason) and his assistant Leonard (Martin Landau).
Before long, Thornhill is falsely accused of murdering a UN official and goes on the lam.  Fortunately, he gains an ally in Eve Kendall (Eve Marie Saint), a slender, sophisticated-looking blonde, who conceals him aboard a train, and all because he has a nice face.  However, she seems to be playing more than just one side, as he discovers later.  Things build to a point when Thornhill says, ""I'm an advertising man. ... I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives, and several bartenders dependent upon me, and I don't want to disappoint them all by getting slightly killed.""
The U.S. Intelligence Agency is aware of Thornhill's innocence, but decides to use him as a decoy to protect their double agent, now infiltrating Van Dam, the villain of this movie.
There are lots of innuendos in this film that are pretty risque for 1959.  Eve tells Roger, ""I'm a big girl.""  He says, ""And in all the right places too.""  In fact the seduction scene in Eve's sleeping car is steamy for the era, but the Hays Code rears it head at the last moment when at the mention of one bed, she makes it clear Thornhill will sleep on the floor.  However, Hitchcock uses Freudian dream symbolism to thumb his nose at the Hays Code when in one scene, he has a train going into a tunnel.  Figure that one out!
The suspense element involving Thornhill escaping one situation after another, having a brief pause, only to have to hide or face some new danger keeps this film going.  And the climactic scene at Mount Rushmore is a classic, as is that now-famous scene that innocuously begins when a man waiting at the same bus stop as Thornhill remarks ""that plane is dusting crops where there ain't no crops.""  Hold on to your hats!  Oh, and the auction scene is both humorous but clever, once one realizes the motive for Thornhill's actions.
One funny scene involves a familiar portly older man missing the bus after the opening credits.  Guess who that is?  And Thornhill's lie to Eve on why the police are chasing him:  ""Seven parking tickets.""  However, I've observed some ridiculous things.  One, the best way to conceal yourslf if you're a wanted murder is to wear dark glasses.  Uh-huh, right!  Another is, if the person you're talking to suddenly gets killed by a thrown knife, don't touch the knife--you'll be blamed for the murder.
Other assets here include Bernard Herrman's music score.  I wonder if Phillip Glass got some inspiration here for Koyaanisqatsi, as some of the frantic violins in NbNW echo that over movie.  Herrman's score at the beginning has echoes of Stravinsky, matching the drawn grid patterns that gradually turn to the glass windows of a New York skyscraper.  A lengthy thriller with some slow pauses inbetween.",1063411200,2,3258,4.746003552397869

I won't rehash the plot here, so I won't reveal anything to the newcomer to this film. The first time I saw it I wondered ""What could possibly be going on here?"" The extras on the DVD really explain how this all came about, and I am glad that  director Alfred Hitchcock and screenwriter Ernest Lehman were able to brainstorm out this spellbinding thriller, based on a bunch of ideas they had thought up.

Roger O. Thornhill (Grant) is the aforementioned innocent man. Hitchcock delineates consequences of mistaken identity, misplaced trust, being somewhere ""at the wrong time,"" acting on assumptions that later prove false, etc. These are devices which Hitchcock uses skillfully throughout many of his films. Who is ""George Kaplan""? Whom does he threaten? Why? No brief commentary such as this can possibly do full justice to this film's immensely complicated plot. The acting is superb. Grant and Saint develop a unique on-screen chemistry which seems natural. I especially appreciate several of the scenes, notably when Thornhill is attacked by a crop-duster plane in a rural area in which there are no crops, and, the film's conclusion among (of all places) the faces of the Presidents on Mount Rushmore. The plot's pace is brisk but unhurried as Thornhill pursues understanding while fleeing from real or imagined dangers. Hitchcock allows Thornhill little of the self-assurance we associate with Grant's characters in other films. We share his confusion and frustration as he muddles through in one of Hitchcock's most entertaining films. Given the circumstances, perhaps survival is the best Thornhill can hope for.",1059004800,,1528,5.397489539748954
114047,5,0790743213,"In a way, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a glorious remake.  Although he hadn't filmed this particular story before, Hitchcock had often told the story of a man falsely accused of a murder he did not commit forced to travel long distances in search of the real murderer and the proof of his own innocence.  Both THE 39 STEPS and YOUNG AND INNOCENT in his English period featured such a hero, and he continued this in his Hollywood film SABOTEUR, with Robert Cummings traveling all the way from the West Coast to the Statue of Liberty.  But NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a remake as well in that in this film he pulled out all the tricks he had honed and mastered over the years.  After this film, he would actually invent new forms of shocking and surprising his viewers.
Bernard Hermann is almost without debate the greatest film composer.  Which film features his greatest work, however, is open to debate.  Probably most would give the nod to his extraordinary score for PSYCHO, but my own vote would go for NORTH BY NORTHWEST.  This music is so extraordinary that it has actually been assembled into a suite that is sometimes performed by symphony orchestras.  Although Hermann could vary dramatically from score to score (compare his work on VERTIGO with that on CITIZEN KANE or PSYCHO), here he can vary sharply from scene to scene.  I know of no more exhilarating score in film.
Nonetheless, when Hitchcock filmed the most famous scene in the film, he used no music at all.  What makes the classic crop duster scene work so magnificently is the silence in which he embeds it.  This is one of the most influential scenes in the history of film, not least because of the patience he displays in allowing it to unfold.  Compare this scene with the beginning of Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, and you find the same kind of patience in allowing the action to take place at a snail's pace.  I'm not aware of any director who took such time to wait on things to unfold so gradually for an action scene before NORTH BY NORTHWEST.  It becomes common afterwards.
Hitchcock was truly one of the great cultural wonders of the modern world.  When he made this film, he had been turning out great classic films for over thirty years.  Yet, he would go on to make even more classics like PSYCHO, THE BIRDS, and FRENZY.  I personally like NORTH BY NORTHWEST as much as any of his films (though several manage to tie it in my affections, like NOTORIOUS and THE 39 STEPS).  It has all his trademarks, from suspense to humor to hairbreadth escapes to the mild dirty jokes he was fond of (see the film's final shot).",1053648000,,2600,4.5310492505353315

So, it's good Hitchcock is not a horror director. Just a supense man with horror elements. In what maybe his best American movie (and yes, better than Vertigo and rear Window), Hitchcock uses his arsenal of trademarks (an exciting score for Hermann, romance, spy thriller motifs, and exotic locales) to assembly the best man who knows too much (or little) movie.

114050,5,0790743213,"""North by Northwest"" (1959) is Hitchcock's slick and polished cross country adventure meets `the wrong man' scenario. When advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for an American CIA agent by the man he is supposed to be tailing, Mr. Van Damme (James Mason), Roger finds himself the victim of multiple attempted assassinations and a harried chase to unravel the mystery behind the insidious girl with whom he's suddenly fallen in love - Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). Fueled by an unmitigated desire to make ""the"" Hitchcock picture to top all others, screenwriter Ernest Lehman creates two of the most memorable set pieces in film history: Roger's frantic escape on foot from a marauding bi-plane, and, the magnificent climax - fleeing across the faces of Mt. Rushmore. Naturally, park officials would not permit this latter scenario to be played out hence MGM recreated the famed landmark on a soundstage using full scale sets combined with matte paintings and rear projection. The results are flawless and thrilling. The film also contains one of the all time blooper shots in cinema: seconds before Eve shoots Roger with a fake gun in the commissary a small child can be seen in the background clutching his eardrums in anticipation of the bang.

* This is the same transfer as was made previously available on the single disc of ""North by Northwest.""  Through a meticulous frame by frame restoration effort, ""North by Northwest"" looks better than it ever has on home video. Colors are rich, bold and vibrant. Contrast levels are bang on. Blacks are deep and solid. Whites are remarkably clean. There are NO age related artifacts and NO digital anomalies for an image that is positively stunning from start to finish. Truly, this is one of the best examples of a classic restored to its original brilliance for the digital format. Certainly it is the finest example of a Vista-Vision film restoration out on the home video market to date! The audio has been remixed to stereo with a spatial spread that is engaging and does not betray its 50 year plus vintage. Extras include a very benign documentary hosted by Eva Marie Saint. It is incredibly long on personal thoughts and terribly short on detailing the production schedule.

My only complaint is the disappointing commentary that you can choose to run while watching the DVD.  Having found that the commentary by Maureen O'Hara on the DVD ""The Quiet Man"" greatly enhanced my appreciation of that picture, I expected similar on the DVD of North by Northwest. In this case the commentary was provided by the scriptwriter, Ernest Lehman.  Unlike the Maureen O'Hara commentary it is rambling and often has little to do with the scene currently on-screen, detracting from the scene.  Very disappointing that Eva Marie Saint did not provide the commentary, especially since she did narrate an interesting documentary about this film that is also included on the disc.
My advice is to skip the commentary and enjoy the film with the original sound track as well as the documentary and original movie trailers.  Well worth buying.",1046563200,,1076,4.8469945355191255

There is a good documentary called ""Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North By Northwest"" hosted by Eva Marie Saint.  Also on this DVD is the Hitchcock trailers and the tv spot.

114073,4,0790743213,"Perhaps Hitchcock's most acclaimed work, ""North by Northwest"" is an entertaining adventure of espionage, mistaken identity, and a typical 50's romance.  Cary Grant plays the unpresuming Roger Thornhill, and advertising executive who inadvertently gets sucked into a ring of spies who believe he is a man named George Kaplan.
Not knowing who Kaplan is, Thornhill tries to escape the spies and find out the truth.  In doing so, he is framed for murder, and his flight across the country begins!  On his way, he meets the mysterious Eve Kendall (played exquisitely by Eva Marie Saint), a glamorous blond who tries to set Thornhill up and then falls for him.
The entire story is one big chase, leading to the infamous ""face-off"" on scenic Mount Rushmore.  The story by Lehmann and the direction by Hitchcock make this movie a true masterpiece.  The DVD features an interesting commentary, theatrical trailer, and featurette about the making of ""North by Northwest"" hosted by Eva Marie Saint herself.

114074,5,0790743213,"Many people in my generation think that movie-history began with ""Back to the future"" and ended in ""Titanic"". Don't get me wrong, I like both of them, but, really, cinema is way more than that. When I ask information about older movies to older people they seem to loose focus, their eyes become lost in the far horizon, and they say ""Yes, this is a great movie"". But the problem is, they say that to EVERY old movie. I once tried to watch Casablanca; in fact, I watched the whole movie, but I didn't really like it. Casablanca is not an ageless movie, so I think it meant more to people who saw it when it was released than to me, watching it forty five years later.
With ""North by northwest"", however, the situation was completely different. First of all, it is listed number 18 on imdb's top 250 films of all time. Second, I have watched the more famous Hitchcock movies, like ""Rear window"", ""Psycho"", ""Vertigo"", etc, and I find Hitchcock an amazing director. His techniques, his directing style, are very similar to what we see in movies today, to what I'm used to expect in a movie. And I think his films deal with subjects that don't seem to get old.
In ""North by northwest"", Cary Grant is the man on the run for being mistaken for an agent he is not. During all the movie, he has to escape his nemesis, in famous and unforgettable scenes like the plane-man walking chase and the final pursuit on top of Mount Rushmore. When there is no action scene, there is the BEST dialogue I've ever seen on screen (very funny, fast and intelligent), between (mostly) Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, the beautiful double-agent who falls in love with Grant.
This is really one of the most enterteining movies I've ever seen. I'm not going to say things like ""Nowadays, we don't have movies like that anymore"" because it's not true. People used to make good movies, and they're still making it today. You just have to have the capacity to know what is good from what is bad.

114078,4,0790743213,"Nominated for several Academy Awards, this 1959 film by Alfred Hitchcock lives in my memory because of several memorable scenes.  There's a scene where Cary Grant is being chased by an crop duster airplane.  And then there's another scene where killers are chasing Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint on Mount Rushmore.  I remember Cary Grant being suave.  And I remember Eva Marie Saint as being beautiful.
Forty-three years have passed since then.  It's time to take another look at this classic.
Well, Cary Grant is still suave.  Eva Marie Saint is still beautiful.  The two memorable scenes are still tense with action.  And the Hitchcock style of suspense is there too.
But it's no wonder I don't remember the plot, which revolves around Cary Grant being mistaken for an international spy, Eva Marie Saint being a double agent and James Mason and Martin Landau being the bad guys.  That's because, like some of today's technological wonders, the plot is an afterthought, pulled together for the purpose of showing off the ""good scenes"".
My opinion on this was borne out by the special features on the DVD, which described the making of the film.  The action scenes were thought up first, and then the story was fitted around them.
O.K.  The film is a classic and will remain so no matter what I say.  And memories of those several scenes will live long into the future.
But I yearn for a story I can sink my teeth into.  I want to care about the characters.  I want to believe that the action they are going through is possible.  I feel this about films of today.  And I feel this about North By Northwest.
High-tech aficionados will enjoy this flick as a great achievement for Hitchcock given the era he worked in.  I can appreciate it for its historical significance, but certainly not for anything else.  I therefore can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.",1036886400,3,1863,4.697530864197531

And all the performances are memorable- from Grant's cynical executive to Eva Marie Saint's beautiful, smoldering agent, to James Mason's urbane, silky, villain. It comes right at the end of probably the director's greatest period of films- his 50's carousel of hits, including STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, TO CATCH A THIEF, REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, and the redux MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.

In another review, I stated that ""Vertigo"" is the only film by Hitch available in 5.1 surround sound.  I was wrong!  ""N by NW"" is also in 5.1, and while the sound won't necessarily rock your system, it's a pretty decent soundtrack for a movie this old.  So, what are you waiting for?

It is thrilling, exciting and at times totally hilarious. Essentially, it's about Roger O. Thornhill, a confident and charming advertising executive, who is mistaken for a government agent and is consequently chased across the country. He is set on the road drunk, forced to hide in train compartments, crop-dusted (a classic sequence), trapped in auction, and finally chased across Mount Rushmore. Movies don't get any better than this.
As for the cast, it is excellent! Cary Grant gives a perfect performance as Roger O. Thornhill - and he is hilarious and charming, as ever! Eva Marie Saint is also very good, as the mysterious and glamorous girl Cary meets on the train. James Mason does a wonderful job playing the debonair but evil villian.
Directed by Hitchcock, this is a great comedy/thriller - in my opinion, it is Hitchcock's best movie! Additionally, it is a good idea to get the DVD, because the movie is astonishingly sharp and clear and there are plenty of special features. 100% worth your money!

114106,5,0790743213,"When you look at North By Northwest closely, you see many parts from Alfred Hitchcock's other films. The premise, a man accused of a crime he didn't commit, was used in The 39 Steps, Strangers on a Train, To Catch a Thief and The Wrong Man, to name a few. Eva Marie Saint, not known as a glamour girl, was remade by Hitchcock to mimic Grace Kelly's cool, blonde beauty. Cary Grant's escape in the auction scene recalls Robert Donat's similar scene in The 39 Steps. The climax on Mount Rushmore recalls the fight on The Statue of Liberty in Saboteur. Even Cary Grant is, in a way, a ""retread,"" having appeared in Suspicion, Notorious and To Catch a Thief. As one film critic put it, North By Northwest is a summation of Hitchcock's work.
However, to simply dismiss North By Northwest as a retread would be like calling Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band just another Beatles album. EVERYTHING works perfectly in this movie with memorable scene after memorable scene (Grant's drunk driving escape, the murder at the U.N., the cropduster attack, Mount Rushmore, etc., etc., etc.). Robert Burks' terrific photography greatly enhances the actors and the locations. George Tomasini's editing maintains a crisp pace. Bernard Herrmann's score is a standout, even when compared to his large body of great work (that's really saying something considering his great scores for Citizen Kane, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Vertigo, Psycho and Taxi Driver, among others). And Ernest Lehman's script is one of the wittiest and most entertaining screenplays in film history. Add to that the great locations like New York City, Chicago and Mount Rushmore and you've got the elements of a classic.
However, the film's greatest strength lies in its casting and performances, especially by Grant. Grant, Saint, James Mason, Leo G. Carroll, Martin Landau and Jessie Royce Landis form a terrific ensemble. Grant's performance, in particular, is wonderful. Present in almost every scene, Grant is the glue that holds the film together. With a weaker actor in the role, the film would have fallen apart. Like Hitchcock himself, Cary Grant wasn't truly appreciated during his career and was more than the one-dimensional charmer many people took him for. Grant perfectly conveys the situation of a confident Madison Avenue ad man who quickly loses control over his life. He has to express confidence, bewilderment, sadness, panic, lust, betrayal and triumph and does so magnificently. It's a shining moment in Grant's great career.
The DVD is terrific, the best feature of which is a great documentary hosted by Eva Marie Saint. (Among other facts revealed, the original title of the film was ""The Man in Lincoln's Nose). It's a fitting presentation for a great film. Along with Vertigo and Psycho, North By Northwest marks the absolute best of Alfred Hitchcock's work.

""North by Northwest"" can be enjoyed for the same reasons as virtually ever other Hitchcock film, particularly because they keep the viewer guessing until the very end.
However, ""North by Northwest"" adds another dimension for your viewing interest. It is perhaps the worst-edited movie of its quality that I've ever seen. There are hanging boom mikes, reflections in mirrors, and visible scenery curtains. Two things to particularly look for: the missing roof on Cary Grant's cab near the beginning of the film, and a little boy with his hands on his ears BEFORE Eva Marie Saint even produces her pistol in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria. The missing roof might not be visible in some prints, especially those which have been modified for TV screens, but the boy is evident in every version and is always a howl for those who know he's there.

114108,5,0790743213,"...  two ex-wives, and several bartenders dependent on me. (Carey Grant)
This movie has it all. A great (original) script by Ernest Lehman. One of Bernard Hermanns scores. James Mason playing a sinister villain.  Martin Landau and even more chilling villain and in his strongest performance in a supporting role. Eva Marie Saint (who I wouldnt have picked for the female lead, but then thats why Im not the one making movies this good) at her sultry best. Carey Grant, always debonair, the very picture of suave, in the best role he ever had. And the best filmmaker ever: Alfred Hitchcock. Theres the one-liners that only Grant can deliver. Humor. Drama. Suspense. Theres a murder in the UN. A chase in a cornfield by a bi-plane, which is one of the most famous chase scenes. And a fight across Mount Rushmore. The Hitchcock film to end all Hitchcock films.
Ive seen DVDs that contain more extras and Ive seen DVDs that contain less. This has some 50 production stills, the tv trailer, the theatrical trailer, and the Hitchcock trailer. There is a 40 minute documentary on the making of the movie. The documentary just covers the basics, so don't expect all the hard details, but its worth watching. Unfortunately neither Hitch nor Carey Grant were around to do a commentary, so the next best thing, Ernest Lehman, did the commentary. Actually, it turns out that his interview for the making of documentary (in its less edited form)  is whats laid out over the movie. Which might explain why there are large gaps of no commentary and why there aren't as many insights as to why he wrote a scene one way versus another. You do get some colorful stories about Hitch and the making of this movie, and at one point Lehman goes into detail about the writing of the script. Its not the best commentary Ive seen, but worthwhile. There is also a music only track for the serious student of Hitchcock. Its probably not something anyone other than a film student is going to watch (over two hours with no dialogue and at times no music takes a certain level of commitment). But if you want to see just how effective Hermanns score is, there is no better way to do it.
North By Northwest is one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies ever made. The DVD isn't spectacular but it does contain a few perks.",1018656000,8,2302,4.58252427184466
114109,5,0790743213,"I am only 23 years old.  I am not enough to have been around in the Hollywood Heyday where the stars were bigger than life and the studios ran like well oiled machines, cranking out one star after another.  That is why I love movies like this because it allows the younger generation a glimpse into the past where the stars were relatively well behaved and free from addictions.  Perhaps this is a romanticized view that Hollywood wants my generation to believe, but I believe it to be true.
In North by Northwest, Cary Grant is a blatant stud.  He has the nice clothes, gets all of the pretty girls and has that smooth talking manner about him.  Lets not forget about Eva Marie Saint.  In my opinion she must have embodied the definition of ""Blonde Bombshell.""  Both give great performances as Roger Thornhill and Eve Kendall, their respective characters.
The plot revolves around Thornhill, an advertising executive who encounters a case of mistaken identity.  It becomes clear that he is being used as some sort of pawn in a game of chess between US and foreign agents.  Thornhill is mistaken for George Kaplan and then framed for murder.  This series of events leads him to try to escape the whole situation.  Along the way he encounters a beautiful Eve Kendell and we are not sure what her motives are.
Again, I was not around in Hitchcock's time, but he is known as a master of suspense and North by Northwest does not disappoint.  This movie was listed in the top 25 of the greatest movies of the 20th century by the American Film Institute and rightfully so.  North by Northwest is an exciting thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie.  It has more ups and downs than a San Francisco avenue.  I would highly recommend it for any avid movie buff, but especially for those Gen. Xers who have no idea what the `50's were like.",1018483200,,1860,4.526946107784431
114110,4,0790743213,"Imagine you're a businessman abducted by the Soviets because you're thought to be an American secret agent.  This nightmare is exactly what happens to Manhattan advertising executive Roger Thornhill (acted by Cary Grant).  Once he is mistaken for the spy George Kaplan, the action never lets up.  Thornhill is thoroughly perplexed, and even his mother thinks his story is completely disbelievable: ""I think I'd like to meet these killers.""  But the Soviets, led by Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), really are killers because they are convinced that Thornhill is about to expose them.  As it turns out, secret agent George Caplan, the man whom the Soviets mistake Thornhill to be, is a fictional creation of the Americans to take the heat off their real secret agent.  And so the Americans are eager to convince Thornhill to continue the charade, life-threatening as it is.  Along the way, Thornhill gets involved with the beautiful Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).  Or is she a Russian spy herself?  Or perhaps a counter-spy?  It is this combination of romance and intrigue that sets the tone for the rest of the movie.
Personally I found the romance rather overdone, particularly the extended and passionate kisses.  Although there is the implied suggestion that the two spend the night together (the trivilization of both casual sex and divorce is a remarkable laxity in morals that was very bold for 1959!), thankfully we are spared any footage more intimate than the kissing.  Thornhill & Kendall's mutual feelings of ""love"" are pure infatuation based on physical attraction at first sight.  The mention of making love in the first minute of their first conversation is rather absurd and certainly outrageous at the time of production.  Nonetheless, these ""offensive"" elements are rather tame alongside what most modern movies deliver.  And they are not the focus of attention, since it is really the suspense of the espionage and intrigue that carries the plot and the drama.
Of course there are many espionage movies with wonderful suspense.  But Hitchcock's 1959 production delivers suspense without extensive violence, profanity and sex.  The focus is on the suspense and intrigue with numerous plot twists, accompanied throughout by wonderfully dry humor (For instance, Thornhill expressing his reluctance to participate in a charade that could threaten his life: ""I have two ex-wives, a mother and several bartenders depending on me!  They would be most disappointed if I got slightly killed."")  There is beautiful scenery and filming throughout - the memorable cinematography of the crop duster attack and the final chase scenes on the faces at Mount Rushmore is superb!  Unlike most modern thrillers, there are times where the action is slow, such as when Thornhill waits alone alongside a desolate road in the middle of nowhere - effectively building up suspense and tension all the more.  As far as cold-war thrillers go, this is a worthy classic of the genre!  Hitchcock serves up delightful humor, spine-tingling suspense, and delightful cinematography, without marring it with much of the moral filth that pollutes contemporary movies.  It's one of the master Hitchcock's best, and is certainly worth a look.",1018310400,,3221,5.199612403100775
114138,5,0790743213,"Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill has one of those in Alfred Hitchcock's renowned thriller. In twenty-four hours, he has been kidnapped, mistaken for another man, intoxicated with alcohol and arrested for drunk driving and assaulting an officer. To top it off, he is framed for murder, which leads to a nationwide search. Let's also not forget when he is attacked by a cropdusting plane. Throw in a dangerous villain (James Mason) and his mistress (Eva Marie Saint), superb direction from Hitchcock (Who makes a brief cameo in the film's beginning) and an exciting Bernard Hermann music score, you have yourself quite a ride. The movie has several clichs that were later exhausted in other movies, but that doesn't detract from the fun.
Considering that it is bargain priced, the DVD of ""North by Northwest"" is a great buy. The film is presented in a Widescreen Anamorphic transfer that's so well done its almost impossible to tell that it is over forty years old. But the extras are really what set this above. ""Destination Hitchcock"", hosted by Eva Marie Saint, is a documentary about the making of this movie featuring interviews with Hitchcock's daughter Patricia and screen writer Ernest Lehman (Who also does an audio commentary). A theatrical trailer, a ""Hitchcock Trailer"", a TV spot, a photo gallery, cast and crew bios and an isolated version of Hermann's music score complete this excellent package.
Whether you are a fan of one of the stars or of Hitchcock, admire great films or just like entertaining movies, ""North by Northwest"" should be added to your personal library.

114139,5,0790743213,"Most of Hitchcock's films deal with the notion of identity, whether it be mistaken identity or the pathological desire of a person to make someone into someone else. In Vertigo, obsessive love (and desire to be loved) led to the loss of a woman's identity with disastrous consequences.
In North By Northwest, the twist is not someone who turns out to be someone else, but someone who has no identity except that which is adventageous to him. ""Maggie,"" as Thornhill (Grant) puts it, ""in advertising there is no such thing as a lie; only the expedient exaggeration"". This is the crux of the story and before the first 15 minutes of the picture is over, Thornhill will become a man (who never existed) in order to establish that he is not that man. Ironically, and unbeknowst to him, by doing this he is simply undercutting what could have been his sole defense.
In essence, Thornhill is doing what children will often do (after making a similar misjudgement) which is to lie rather than own up to the truth because (as Grant will say in 'Charade') ""they want something and they are afraid that the truth won't get it for them."" The mistake children make is not understanding the more advanced real world experience of their parents that make the flaws in the story immediately apparent.
Thornhill makes the same misjudgement.
Most of us don't really believe that prentending to be someone else is the way to achieve a desirable end. But Hitchock creates a situation in which we find ourselves accepting it, as improbably as it may seem. After all, doesn't Thornhill have friends who can vouch for his identity? Wouldn't the proper investigation of the death of Townsend (and the identifty of Kaplan) ultimately reveal the complicity of the housekeeper and the gardener? Of course. In the real world, the absurdity of the events would have become apparent in a matter of days, without the need for Thornhill to ever leave New York.
But, in fact, he does leave (and, in so doing, undercuts his own defense). His motivation is derived from his experience as an advertiser (illusionist). If he can make ""people buy things they don't need"" then, he is arguing, the public could very well be duped by someone with a more sinister motive. In essence, Thornhill has come to distrust his fellow man precisely because he realizes how easy it is to lie to them. His experience in the courtroom when he tries to tell the truth only reinforces this view. His only weapon is his ability to lie, so much so that he is actually able to dupe the Professor, who created the entire scenario (not for ""our amusement"" the Professor protests), by pretending to be honest.
Authors have argued that Hitchock was a misogynist, but North By Northwest is more than misogynistic. It is cunningly misanthropic. As Van Dam's character says, ""you make this very room a theatre"". In North By Northwest, most people are fools, blindly accepting what they see at face value, while all around them is actually being played out a sinister battle between good and evil. The ""truth"" is nothing more than what it is these players want us to believe. If Hitchcock had tried to make that point in a serious movie (like ""Manchurian Candidate"") it would have likely been dismissed. How much cleverer to play it as ironic humor.",1013817600,,3282,4.749562171628722

114144,5,0790743213,"I was fortunate to have studied this movie in detail during a college film class, and 20 years later, it remains my favorite all time Alfred Hitchcock flick (and the master justifies many of my favorites over time.)  Very few films are able to retain the one-two punch of being classics within a genre and remain remarkably fresh, accessible and fun (yes, even fun!)  Cary Grant is amazing throughout as the executive mistaken for someone else by both criminals and the authorities.  Few of his contemporaries (or even actors since Grant's glory days) ever mastered the dual qualities of being both manly and approachable which Grant offers in spades.  He is the everyday simple man, on the order of a James Stewart, and yet, a leading man matinee idol that has charmed viewers for decades.  He lures you with his affect, but never in a way that feels tired or condescending, always with good nature and a crooked eyebrow that knows more about life than most full fledged characters ever placed on screen.
The movie moves from New York through the Heartland, to fields of corn, to a climax that is visually and emotionally stunning.  The supporting characters all lend crediblity to the zig zag tale that rarely allows the viewer to catch his or her breath.  Eva Marie Saint and James Mason are especially delicious, and the viewer is forced repeatedly to question whether they are good guys, bad guys or neither, which only adds to the fun.
Great actors and filmmaking aside, what makes ""North By Northwest"" especially important in today's world are its still-vital themes and how these relate to the ever-changing world we live in.  Cases of mistaken identity are more present now than before, as Muslims and Arab Americans confront the spectacle of being reduced to second class citizens despite their long, proud history and embrace of American values, and the American Dream itself.  Grant's character is literally hounded by both good and evil, but retains intact his inner virtues, and knows deep inside where he stands, like our Muslim and Arab countrymen, and most of the world's human population.
In addition, Grant's ""everyman"" could be any one of us which adds to the suspense and allows us to feel a bond with this character that is rare among Hitchcock leads.  In fact, Hitchcock seems to have originated ""racial profiling"" here - albeit for the omnipresent ""white man.""  If you think about it, mistaken identities are often the driving force behind racial profiling and the Master truly drives this point home.  Again, knowing this only makes the film more impoactful and adds to its universality today.
Finally, in an era of bioterrorism and unprecendented disasters like the attacks on the World Trade Centers of 9-11, ""North by Northwest"" seems more contemporary now than even 30+ years ago.  The cropduster scene takes on new resonance given what we're witnessing at the moment with anthrax, and the days immediately following the terrorist events, when cropdusters and other small planes were forced to suspend operation.
Plus, the events of September 11th appear supremely tied to what transpires at Mt Rushmore during near the end of the film.  Think about it - like the hijacker's destruction of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, beloved icons for modern Americans, the Presidential busts carved into the side of the mountain as used in the film are literally extensions of our pride, patriotism, heritage and history.  They represent all that ""is good"" in America, and applaud the democracy that has led the world for centuries to new, unparalleled glories.  The evil characters in the film are foiled by the mountain, and the all-American Grant endures (as shall we.)  While a mountain can't implode like the Towers themselves, the ground around them can be desacrated by murderers, and Hitchcock foreshadows the tragedies of 9-11 with uncanny vision.  The four Presidents on the mountain seem to stare down at Grant and give him the power to go on, while at the same time toppling the assailants.  Like them, our 6 living Presidents, from Ford to Bush, have crossed party lines and formed unilateral, unprecedented loyalty in the fact of terror.  If only life were fiction like Hitchcock's tale, perhaps the themes he presents would not be as terrifyingly real as they actually feel at this fateful moment in time!  I hate to read into this, but Hitchcock speaks volumes in this film about the nature of our culture, the values that sustain and inspire us, as well as the forces that would prefer to see us destroyed.
On DVD, ""North by Northwest"", reaffirms its status as the Master's truest work of art and renews his position as the greatest filmmaker of his day.  You can escape with this movie, but realize that, more today than ever the film generates a passion and vision that is more real, more intense and far more frieghtening than ever before.  Justice prevails, as it always does, yet Hitchcock makes the viewer go through hell first!  Just like the world's civilized nations are coping with terror  today, so does the Grant character.

This is a suave and intelligently scripted entertainment, although it is quite contrived at times.

And, handsome though he may be, Grant seemed a little old for a hottie like Eva Marie Saint to be throwing herself at him without an ulterior motive.

114171,5,0790743213,"""North By Northwest"" is a film to be seen AND heard.
Much of Hitchcock's reputation as a genius of suspense is due to his brilliant collaboration with Bernard Herrmann, one of the most important composers of the 20th century.  None other than George Martin, legendary producer of the Beatles, has cited Herrmann's ""spikey string arrangements"" as a major influence on recordings such as ""Eleanor Rigby.""  Imagine, for example, the shower scene from ""Psycho"" without the terror-inducing, demonic music that accompanies it.  Or think of the bell-tower scene in ""Vertigo"" without Herrmann's gut-wrenching soundtrack.
""North By Northwest"" is no exception.  Visually, it is colorful, vibrant, and stylish, but I think it's the MUSIC that carries us through the picture emotionally.  The effect of Cary Grant's ""drunk driving"" scene is more than doubled by Herrmann's clever score.  Likewise the Mt. Rushmore scene...the visuals are great, but the actual suspense derives significantly from Herrmann's music.
There is an artistic ""chemistry"" between Hitchcock and Herrmann, as director and composer, rivaled by none save perhaps the partnership of Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone (""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,"" ""Once Upon A Time In The West,"" ""The Mission,"").  Together, these men created works more powerful than anything they created separately.
The DVD release of ""North By Northwest"" is terrific.  The picture is absolutely GORGEOUS, and the soundtrack is crystal clear, allowing Herrmann's score to really stand out.  There is also a fine ""making-of"" documentary, a music-only feature, and a screenwriter's feature-length commentary.  If you are worried because this isn't part of the fine Universal series of DVD releases, don't be.  Everything here is top-notch.",997747200,5,1768,5.511111111111111
114172,5,0790743213,"That's the question the exasperated Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) puts to an Interpol bigwig at the UN before the next shocking turn in Alfred Hitchcock's thrilling ""North by Northwest"". A classic case of mistaken identity takes place when Mr. Van Dam's (James Mason's)henchmen pick up Thornhill by mistake, thinking him to be a superspy on their tail. Wonderful dialogue as Thornhill and Van Dam face off in a well-appointed LI mansion, before Thornhill is consigned to a near fatal attempt on his life by chief goon Leonard (an extremely young and thin Martin Landau).
There's no way I could possibly record all the twists and turn of this plot--and you wouldn't want me to either--but along the way, Thornhill does meet up with a surprisingly sexy Eva Marie Saint playing Eve Kendall, and he faces danger both in a cornfield and on Mount Rushmore before everything gets sorted out.
Cary Grant turns in one of his better late performances, and scampers around pretty well for a man in his 50s--a testament to his acrobat youth, no doubt. James Mason is always a delight to listen to, and Eva Marie Saint turns the voltage on high while being oh so subtle.

114175,5,0790743213,"Alfred Hitchcock's star-studded romantic comedy adventure is the best escapist entertainment there is. It anticipates the thrills of the James Bond genre but recasts the hero as the Hollywood equivalent of an everyman (it's easy for a guy to imagine he's Cary Grant, right?).
Boring old advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) signals a bellman in a hotel lounge to ask where the nearest telephone is. He is mistaken by two henchmen for a fellow named George Kaplan (not to be confused with famous Jazz radio host Michael Kaplan). He rises and walks toward the phone only to be escorted by the thugs to a mysterious mansion.
Examining this initial action sheds light on what's so delightful about the entire movie. The henchmen are trying to track down a man named George Kaplan. They don't know what he looks like but they know he's staying at this specific hotel so they have him paged. Roger Thornhill appears to respond to the page so they nab him. The coincidence seems innocent enough and the action of all parties involved plausible enough that we're never challenged to suspend our disbelief.
At the same time, the underlying story that sets the coincidence in motion is something that could only be cooked up by a wily screenwriter. In this case, Ernest Lehman. It's a shaggy dog story that will cast its unwitting protagonist into a world of international espionage, into the arms of icy blonde du jour Eva Marie Saint, and clambering over Abe Lincoln's nose on Mount Rushmore.
The script, peppered with sexual innuendo, suits Cary Grant's sly, sexy style. James Mason as his sophisticated nemesis is a perfect match. We're asked to believe that Eva Marie Saint's character who falls in love with Grant, once fell in love with Mason. It's not too much of a stretch.
Working on this gorgeous, big budget, big star production must have made Hitchcock yearn for simplicity because he followed it with the $800,000 Psycho.
The road picture aspect of the film allows Alfred Hitchcock to strut his directorial stuff in locations as open as a corn field in Indiana and as tight as a railroad train sleeping compartment.

114176,5,0790743213,"Although Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"" is primarily thought of as a Cary Grant movie, I first saw this movie because I was very interested in Martin Landau.  ""North By Northwest"" is one of the great spy films.
Madison Avenue executive Cary Grant is mistaken for a government agent by a group of communist spies led by James Mason.  Grant ultimately ends up being chased around the United States and meets femme fatale Eva Marie Saint along the way.
""NBN"" features an excellent cast.  The leading players are perfect: Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Martin Landau, Leo G. Carrol, and Jesse Royce Landis.  Mason is excellent as the suave and evil Phillip Vandamm but Martin Landau is particularly creepy as his henchman Leonard.  Nearly forty years later, he would win an Oscar for ""Ed Wood,"" but ""NBN"" is the real film that featured Landau at his finest hour.  There are few actors who look as naturally spooky as Landau.  With his gaunt frame and haunted blue eyes, Landau is the perfect heavy.  If he had not played Rollin Hand on TV's ""Mission: Impossible,"" Landau would have gone on to become one of the greatest villains of the big screen.
The cast is only one of the factors that make ""NBN"" a great movie.  The film offers a perfect blend of comedy and suspense.  The cropduster and Mount Rushmore sequences are awesome.  The photography is perfect.
By almost sheer coincidence, three of the stars would go on to appear in several of the great televison spy shows of the 1960s.  As mentioned above, Landau appeared in ""Mission: Impossible.""  Leo G. Carrol, who played good guy-spy boss Alexander Waverly on ""The Man From UNCLE,"" plays a very similar role in this movie.

At first, I was afraid that the DVD would be less than perfect, but I was very wrong.
The picture quality is outstanding. The colors are dead-on accurate and detail is everywhere. The letterboxing acheives a nice frame, the way the film was intended for. The sound is crystal clear and sounds better than theater quality.
The extras are also excellent. The documentary is very entertaining and informative, as is the commentary by Ernest Lehman. The trailers and TV spots are interesting because of their vintage quality. (The Hitchcock trailer is neat.) The photo gallery offers some neat photographs (nearly 40!). The inclusion of spanish and french audio tracks is great so that more people can be introduced to this excellent film.

As with most Warner DVD's, the movie has a high number of chapter stops, which allows more access to scenes in the movie. The film is also enhanced for widescreen televisions, which makes the quality even better. Warners has a tastefully short and simple DVD intro with their company logo that lets you get to the movie quickly unlike Disney/Touchstone DVD's.
Warners knows that people want the main attraction, the film, and they satisfy that want. Also, the DVD cover is nice and comes in a simple snapper case, which is less likely to damage the disc.

114203,5,0790743213,"A case of mistaken identity leads to kidnapping and more, in the suspenseful ""North by Northwest,"" directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Cary Grant.  Advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Grant) has his lunch interrupted by two men who think he's someone else, a man named Kaplan, and as they escort him from the restaurant at gunpoint to a waiting car, it's only the beginning of an adventure that will take the hapless Thornhill from New York to Mount Rushmore, and introduce him to the kind of intrigue few people experience except in the movies.  And before he's through, Thornhill will have scaled the famous monument, played tag with a crop-dusting airplane and fallen in love with a beautiful woman.  It's a classic case of an ordinary person getting caught up in extraordinary events, and with Hitchcock behind it all, you know it's going to be a thrilling ride.  And it is.
 With this film, Hitchcock proves once again that he is, indeed, the Master of Suspense.  With terrific foreshadowing, he has a way of tipping you off to what is about to happen, without letting you in on what's really behind the mystery.  It's part of that special touch he has that keeps it all exciting and moving along, while allowing the tension to build until the very end.  It's a precision balancing act-- keeping the story right on the wire while refusing to reveal any more than is necessary at any given point in time-- that few directors have managed to achieve so effectively.  Hitchcock has an eye for detail, an innate sense of what works and knows just when to infuse some humor into his story; but a big part of his success is also that he knows how to exact the kind of performances he needs from his actors.
 Grant, as expected, gives a first-rate performance as Thornhill, using his natural charm and style to great effect; It's understated, and entirely credible.  His reaction to being kidnapped is totally honest, as he affects an almost naive sense of well being even with a gun stuck in his ribs.  As you can imagine it would be in a real situation like that, he simply doesn't comprehend what's really happening.  And the transition from that point to when he fully realizes the danger he's in is extremely well handled and developed.  It's a good bit of acting by Grant, and directing by Hitchcock.
 Also turning in notable performances are James Mason, suave and menacing as Phillip Vandamm, Thornhill's adversary, and Eva Marie Saint, as Eve Kendall, the woman Thornhill meets on a train and with whom he becomes quite taken, not only with her beauty, but by her candor, as well.
 The great thing about Hitchcock is that he sets you up so beautifully and never fails to deliver.  He consistently gives you that sense that something is about to happen, and it always does.  When Thornhill is standing out in the middle of nowhere at a crossroads, surrounded by nothing but fields, and you see a crop-dusting plane making a pass in the distance, and then you see it again-- but Thornhill is paying it no attention whatsoever-- you know something is up.  And from that innocuous lead in, Hitchcock develops one of his most memorable scenes ever, brilliantly conceived and realized.  The same thing happens when Thornhill and Eve find themselves at the top of Mount Rushmore; you know they didn't wind up there by accident.
 The supporting cast includes Jessie Royce Landis (Clara Thornhill), Leo G. Carroll (The Professor), Josephine Hutchinson (Mrs. Townsend), Philip Ober (Lester), Martin Landau (Leonard) and Edward Platt (Larrabee).  An exciting story, some engaging performances and the indelible images this film plants in your memory, all make ""North by Northwest"" one of Hitchcock's finest (and that's saying a lot).  Thoroughly entertaining, it's one to which you can return time and again and still be thrilled anew.  You can always rely on Hitchcock to give you a good show, and show you a good time; that's the magic of Hitchcock, and it's the magic of the movies.",989193600,,3990,4.808199121522694
114204,5,0790743213,"Less resonant than ""Vertigo,"" more complex and layered than ""Rear Window,"" ""North by Northwest"" has something for everyone.  The title is from ""Hamlet,"" especially appropriate because of the film's plot movement from NYC to South Dakato and because of the protagonist.  Grant plays a character running from a protective mother, encountering a threatening version of Ophelia, and all the while putting on various ""antic dispositions"" while seeking to claim his own national identity and personal autonomy.  Hitchcock has not only taken his British actor but his own British classic, ""The 39 Steps,"" and transformed them into cinematic icons as recognizably American as Mount Rushmore.  The protagonist's flight starts from the United Nations and threatens to take on an international theme until the thrilling and delightful climactic action sequence.  The dispossessed hero on the run, Archie Leach, instantaneously becomes the American object of desire--Cary Grant--and Hitchcock becomes the consummate exploiter of American moviegoers' fears, dreams, desires in a segue that collapses fear and desire, death and sex into a closing moment as characteristically American as any conclusion in film.  Besides this unforgettable edit, the film contains one of Hitchcock's 3 most celebrated editing sequences: the tennis match from ""Strangers on a Train,"" the shower scene from ""Psycho,"" and in ""North by Northwest"" the low-flying plane that threatens to harvest Gary Grant.",988848000,2,1470,5.659090909090909
114205,5,0790743213,"This is acclaimed by many as one of Hitchcock's best films, but it is also known as one of his biggest blunders.  It is generally agreed that ""The Master of Suspense"" stumbled badly by revealing the identity of George Kaplan early in the film, in the scene where the CIA members discuss what to do about Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant).
Thornhill is a heady advertising executive who is abducted at gunpoint and taken to a man named Vandamm (James Mason) who asks him cryptic questions and keeps calling him George Kaplan.  Thornhill responds that he doesn't know George Kaplan and that they are confusing him with someone else.  Through this entire sequence, we are never sure whether he is Thornhill or Kaplan.  The film would have been far more intriguing if this were left a mystery until the end, rather than having it cleared up twenty minutes into the plot.
It is thought that Hitchcock believed that the introduction of Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) would replace one mystery with an even better one.  However, Eve's motivations are too transparent and even of the dullest of viewers can discern that their meeting on the train is no chance encounter.  Eve is far too forward and obvious, especially for the 1950's.  It is hard to believe there is anyone who wouldn't be a tad suspicious at her behavior.  Though we are left with more than a few questions about Eve after the love scene, imagine how wonderfully confused we would have been if Kaplan's identity weren't revealed so early in the film.  We would know only what Thornhill knew about why he was being pursued and seduced, which is next to nothing.
Despite these flaws, the film is still intriguing, with a number of unpredictable twists.  The second half of the film is much tighter and filled with Hitchcock's trademark suspense scenes.  The crop duster pursuit and the chase scene on the face of Mount Rushmore are classic Hitch.  Hitchcock tried to get permission to shoot the scene on the real Rushmore, but he was refused.  Not to be deterred, he had his own Mount Rushmore set built that was indistinguishable from the original, earning an Oscar nomination for set decoration.
The acting is excellent.  Cary Grant is at his debonair best as the acerbic ad executive who is beguiled by Eve's beauty and charm.  Eva Marie Saint is best known for her movie debut as Edie in ""On The Waterfront"", but she is every bit as good in this film.  Hers is a very complex character, duplicitous and devious, yet vulnerable and torn, and she handles it with facility.  James Mason is enigmatic and elusive as VanDamm and a youthful Martin Landau does a nice job as VanDamm's tough lieutenant.
I enjoyed this film, but I don't believe it attains the level of excellence of Hitchcock's other renowned films (""Psycho"", ""Vertigo"" and ""Rear Window"").  I rated it 9/10 with a point deducted for blowing the Kaplan question.  Even so, a bad day for Hitchcock is like the best day for most directors.",987811200,3,2951,4.728515625
114206,5,0790743213,"This is definitely a DVD to have and to rewatch with friends and family. The story is familiar - a man is mistaken for a spy and has to get out of the mess without dying - but the acting and scenes are fresh and stunning.
It's pretty sexual for a film of its time - Roger has been married many times and has no qualms about seducing the beautiful young woman on the train. Not that she needs seducing - in the original version she meets him while eating, and says that she wants to finish dinner because she doesn't like to make love on an empty stomach. Not too bad for a first date!
The crop-dusting scene is famous and much-copied, as are several other scenes. It's the interpersonal relationships where this movie shines, though. The jealousy of the two men who both love Eva, the way that James' henchman is fond of him (and jealous of Eva) ... there are romantic pentagons in this film, never mind triangles.

114228,5,0790743213,"""North by Northwest"" (1959) was the fourth and final collaboration between director Alfred Hitchcock and actor Cary Grant. Both men were at their artistic zenith when they made this superb comic thriller, which screenwriter Ernest Lehman promised would be ""the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures."" Lehman's script incorporates some brilliant setpieces that the Master of Suspense was unable to work into his previous films, such as the famous crop-dusting chase and the surreal Mount Rushmore climax. However, the highlight remains the Chicago auction sequence. Grant's screwball humor and dark charm make him the ideal Hitchcock leading man - complemented by excellent performances from Eva Marie Saint, James Mason and Martin Landau. ""North by Northwest"" was Hitchcock's sole effort for MGM and he makes the most of the studio gloss. It's a top-notch production in terms of set design and matte work. In fact, author Ian Fleming considered ""North by Northwest"" to be the stylistic prototype for the James Bond series and wanted Hitchcock to direct the first 007 production (he turned down the offer). To fully appreciate this classic film, it should be seen in the letterbox format that Hitchcock intended.  One of the all-time greats.",983491200,29,1250,5.313131313131313
114229,5,0790743213,"After the galloping overture (and a brief glimpse of Cinemaestro Hitchcock missing a bus), we are plunged into the world of adman Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant) working out a last minute itinerary with his girl Friday.  ""In the world of advertising,"" he explains ""there is no such thing as a lie .... only expedient exaggeration.""  He arrives at a dinner meeting with some clients, excuses himself to make a last minute call, and before he knows it is mistaken for a government spy named George Kaplan ..... who doesn't really exist.  Before he can comprehend what is happening, a team of thugs pour a fifth of bourbon into him and put him behind the wheel of a convertible headed down a coastal cliff, which he miraculously survives, but has to somehow explain to the police.  He has even more explaining to do later when, in his attempts to figure out why this has happened to him, he ends up pulling a knife out of the back of a U.N. diplomat in front of hundreds of onlookers and a press photographer.  Expedient exaggeration indeed ....
Hitchcock's North By Northwest basically set the standard for all suspense/action films to come out of Hollywood.  It is the perfect story of a man in an already barely-managable life being thrust into an out-of-control one, just by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Before he knows it, he's a tool of a government agency, being used as a playing piece against espionage kingpin James Mason, along with romance interest Eva Marie Saint, reluctantly caught between two manipulative interests while trying to preserve not only his innocence, but his very identity.  In the course of it all, he has to evade a killer cropdusting plane (""dusting where there ain't no crops"") and high class thugs who chase him and his lady charge down the faces of Mount Rushmore.
If there is a theme, or moral of any sort, to this classic tale of intrigue and misplaced identity, it would have to be: when you are caught in the middle, which side do you choose?  Especially when neither side is overly concerned with your survival?
The digital transfer of this treasure of a film does it proper justice: it is like watching a new film set in the period (early 50's) that it depicts.  The Bernard Herrmann score crackles with energy and sounds best at high volume.  The restoration team is to be applauded for their efforts in maintaining the life of a film that feels still very much alive today, with its plot twists and subtly subversive messages about the manipulative nature of societal forces.  The main thing that set Hitchcock's work apart from other filmmakers of his time was its extremes of entertainment and thought provocation: his attitude, in other words.

114236,5,0790743213,"Alfred Hitchcock goes back to one of his most popular themes: mistaken identity. Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), an advertising executive is used as a pawn in a game between U. S. and foreign agents. Grant is first mistaken for a American agent named George Kaplan and then framed for murder. The latter event convinces Grant that he is in serious danger requiring him to run for his life. Along the way he meets a mysteriously cool blond (another Hitch favorite) named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who may or may not want to do him harm. A wonderful comic romp which has the sophisticated style and polish that you'd expect in the best of Hitchcock films, North By Northwest does not disappoint. Grant is cool and smooth as the ad executive on the run and Saint is terrific as the mysterious blond. As the head of the foreign spy ring, James Mason is properly menacing, as is Martin Landau, his right hand man. Great bits by Jesse Royce Landis as Grant's mother (she played Grace Kelly's mother in To Catch A Thief a few years earlier), a tense Bernard Herrmann score, and enough memorable scenes--the United Nations murder, the plane chase in a field of corn, the Mount Rushmore climax--to fill a dozen films, North is an incredibly fun ride.

Cary Grant's character Roger Thornhill is as clueless about what is happening to him as we are.  We are discovering like he is that all is not as it would seem.

114248,4,0790743213,"I never really appreciated the geniusness of Alfred Hitchcock's work before viewing this film.  However, this film has it all. Hitchcock combines fast-paced non-stop action and suspense, great sound, and exceptional editing to produce this truly classic film.  The acting was also performed well.  Cary Grant (Roger O. Thornhill/George Kaplin) played a cool, calm, and collective, yet suave, innocent victim of mistaken identity.  His counterpart Eva Marie Saint (Eve Kendall), a great looking blond, performed admirably as a seductress and a spy.  As previously mentioned, the film is fast-paced non-stop action.  When the film was over, I could not believe that it was 136 minutes long.  The film was riveting. Hitchcock did a marvelous job of intertwining action and suspense.  A prime example was the scene in which Mr. Thornhill (driving drunk) was being pursued.  The chase scene showed some close ""calls.""  Then, around a curve, it looked as if he was going to drive off the cliff into the water.  Another perfect example of weaving action and suspense was during the final scene of the movie.  But in the spirit of Hitchcock, to keep you in suspense, I refuse to divulge that information.  You will just have to watch the movie yourself!  The use of sound truly enhanced the film.  Sometimes it was used to create suspense, as in the aforementioned scenes, while other times used as a mood setter.  An example of the latter was the soft romantic background music when Mr. Thornhill and Eve Kendall were together in the train cabin room.  Hitchcock also used the sound especially well as a transition between scenes.  Even though I found the acting to be performed well, the pace and action exceptional, and the sound very enhancing, none of these could come close in comparison to the phenomenal job Hitchcock did with the editing.  The crown jewel of the film was the cut from Mt. Rushmore to the train bunk bed.  This was the best-edited film that I have seen.  Some films blend scenes together like mixing oil and water.  Hitchcock's scenes in this film are as ""smooth as silk.""  That was not an easy feat considering the multiple locations and situations portrayed in the film and the equipment that he had to work with back in 1959.  I said that this was a ""great"" movie not a ""perfect"" movie.  I felt that there was a little continuity lost in the scene on the deserted road.  The viewer was given an overview that showed that Mr. Thornhill was out in the middle of ""nowhere,"" and all of a sudden, there were cars and trucks that came from who knows where.  Another scene that I felt lacked continuity was the scene in Eve's hotel room.  A valet was called to clean Mr. Thornhill's suit. He informed Mr. Thornhill that it would take about 25 minutes to clean it.  About five seconds later, we saw Mr. Thornhill leaving the hotel in a clean suit. It just seemed to quick.  Despite these relatively minor flaws, I consider this an excellent film.  I agree with those who say that Alfred Hitchcock was a pioneer in his field.  On a scale of 1-10, I would rate this film an 8.",979862400,,3086,4.710280373831775

I've finally purchased the DVD and, thankfully, the color balances look pretty much as I remember them from the first screenings of the film in theaters in the summer of 1959. Still, this isn't a ""restoration"" in the strict sense; the improvements aren't as major as those on ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo."" But the studio seems to have kept the negative in good shape, unlike Hitchcock, who mostly kept the Paramount films he owned out of release and let them deteriorate for decades.

This role gave Grant the ability to show diversity beyond his usual aplomb.  He plays a clever man accustomed to being in complete control, only to unexpectedly be thrust into life-and-death circumstances with no one to help him.  We are left to discover how clever the character really can be, as well as how well Grant could really act.
There are moments when he evokes genuine feelings.  For example, in a scene when villains force him onto a couch, there is suddenly real fear in Cary Grant's eyes.  It is amazing to watch this film create and maintain this kind of tension.
Aside from excellent performances from a skilled cast, the film also presents an example of Hitchcock at some of his best:  using innovative camera-work without letting it intrude into the flow of the story.

Once again, there is no comparison in richness between this DVD interpretation and the prior VHS version.  Blacks are black here, whites are white, and the full spectrum of color and definition are available.  The quality of the soundtrack almost changes this to an entirely different version than the earlier tape recordings.
As often, I am reminded of the miracle of cinematography, where this movie appears so immediate, yet virtually all of the actors here are long since deceased.  Cary Grant was never more debonaire, James Mason never more diabolical.  Eva Marie Saint is luminescent in her beauty, touching in fifties makeup and fashions.  In this digital version, all the 1950's props look so new!  Shiny new 1958 cars, then-current fashions; no new-old movie can duplicate this.

114253,5,0790743213,"Hitchcock had done similar films to this one  (*The 39 Steps*  immediately comes to mind), but with  *North By Northwest*  he reached the very apogee of the cross-country caper.  This movie falls into a very distinct genre -- it's hard imagining this great entertainment ever being topped within that genre.  For a romantic crime caper it's certainly ambitious:  nothing less than the United Nations building, the vast terrain of the Midwest, and Mount Rushmore will do.  That may say something about America's state of mind in the late 1950's  (literally, The Sky's The Limit), but it says even more about Hitchcock's willingness to pave well-worn paths with imagination and  (dare I say it?)  delight.  Some of the movie's famous set-pieces are now a part of Americana, so there's no need to go over them -- chances are slim indeed if you haven't seen Cary Grant in his humorous Gray Flannel Suit running from the crop-duster.  Speaking of Grant, this may be his best performance.  There were several  ""Cary Grants""  during the course of his long career -- and here he's the epitome of his later urbane and self-deprecating persona.  He's so urbane and self-deprecating in  *North By Northwest*  that this role doubtless stands in people's minds as THE Cary Grant role, subsuming all previous  (and later)  manifestations.  James Mason is somewhat less satisfactory as the Bad Guy  (his cuffs are as well-starched as Grant's, but he lacks the charm).  But perhaps the movie's biggest revelation is Eva Marie Saint, shockingly icy as Grant's love interest.  Hitchcock remade forever the woman who was Brando's dishrag in  *On The Waterfront*; the result is the Master's most startling female character.

114254,5,0790743213,"This Hitchcock film, is not as dark and obsessive as other Hitchcock masterpieces (Vertigo and Rear Window) but is a brilliant paranoid's fantasy which eclipses the ideas of 39th Steps, The Wrong Man and Saboteur into a breezy sexy suspenseful stew of Hitch tics, themes, and style.  Many of the best elements from his past films coalesced into this comedy thriller.  It was nominated for awards and appreciated as an impressive entertainment when it was originally released but it was not immediately recognized as a masterpiece or trend setter.
It's been one heck of a trend-setter too.  Films which consulted with the North by Northwest blue print of mixing set pieces, intrigue, sex, multiple locations, comedy and suspense include the James Bond series, Charade, Mirage and a lesser parade of often over-produced and less then impressive wanna-be's.  Modern action films owe a lot to the film as well.  It also features some very risque sexual banter (a few lines were actually dubbed over in editing to appease the censors), and stirred up tremendous controversy because Hitchcock dared to stage an action sequence having actors run around our beloved President's faces.
Ernest Lehman was originally supposed to work with Hitchcock on the planned filming of The Wreck of the Mary Deere.  Hitch and Ernest got along well, but there was no ship wreck movie being written, so Hitch simply said that Ernest should write something else and he would clear the project with the studio.  Hitch contributed some ideas which Ernest then figured out how to use.  It was like writing an elaborate puzzle with Hitch contributing some important pieces.  The screenplay played right into Hitch's strengths and also included some wonderful witty dialogue.
The casting of Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint (On the Waterfront)  and James Mason (not to mention Martin Landau and several key long time supporting players Hitch liked to rely upon -like Leo G. Carrol) pretty much insured the expensive 4 million dollar film (or so) would create some box office magic.
It's perhaps the last film Hitch really enjoyed making.  The process of making films was always one fraught with much drudgery for Hitchcock because he had planned so meticulously every shot, every angle before the production began, he often felt like an assembly line supervisor while shooting his films.  But there were enough challenges and a bit of improvisation necessary to tackle some production problems which kept Hitchcock very interested in the project.
Cary Grant at his most assuredly debonair plays advertising big wig, Roger O. Thornhill.  What's the O. stand for?  Nothing... but the initials R.O.T. look great on promotional matchbook covers.  When having coffee with some business associates R.O.T. is mistaken by two heavies to be  George Kaplan who is thought to be a government agent on the trail of a master spy (James Mason).  We later learn  Thornhill has been getting microfilm containing U.S. secrets out of the country in some manner and a C.I.A. type organization headed by Uncle(... well Leo G. Carrol anyway,) wants to find out why.  Thornhill is set up and accused of assasinating a U.N. ambassador, he meets sexy Eva Marie Saint on a train and then. . .  Well, of course what follows is a lot of improbably hooey, but it's paced so energetically and delivered with such skill few will care for one moment how likely any of it is.  There's a logic to everything and it sort of makes sense.. so who cares...
 Along the way there's several exciting set pieces, including the crop dusting plane that tries to eliminate Thornhill/Kaplan, and of course the exciting finale at Mount Rushmore which is followed by perhaps my favorite edit in all of movies to quickly wrap up the film.
I can just imagine what a truly exhilarating experience it must have been to movie audiences of the late 50's who first saw the film.  A suspenseful, big budgeted comedy thriller that had a little romance and lots of excitement.
The film would never have been made if it were not for Bernard Herrmann however.  One of his most memorable scores graces the film and adds immeasurably to it's success, but it was Herrmann who introduced writer Lehman to Hitchcock which resulted in North by Northwest being made.
The DVD presentation of the film is superb.  The film has never looked or sounded better.  You will also find a 40 minute documentary hosted by Saint and featuring Lehman, Landau and Hitchcock's daughter, Pat about the making of the film.  There is also a pleasant commentary track featuring writer Ernest Lehman.  You'll want to have this in your collection.

114286,5,0790743213,"I have always been a big Alfred Hitchcock fan and ""North by Northwest"" was in my view his most entertaining and important film. There are so many memorable lines in this movie (brilliantly written by Ernest Lehman) that one doesn't know where to start when recollecting favourite gems. How about Jessie Royce Landis asking the would-be assassins if they plan to kill Cary Grant. Or when Grant meets James Mason for the first time after being kidnapped. Mason: ""Not what I expected - a little taller, a little more polished than the others"". Grant: ""I'm so glad you're pleased Mr Townsend"". Mason: "" ... but I'm afraid just as obvious"". Grant: ""Not that I mind a slight case of abduction now and then, but I do have tickets to the theatre tonight and it was a show I was looking forward to and I get, well, kind of unreasonable about things like that"". Mason: ""With such expert play-acting you make this very room a theatre"". Or Cary Grant trying to explain to Eva Marie Saint why the police are after him: ""Seven parking tickets!"". Grant introducing himself to Saint on the train: ""Jack Phillips. Western sales manager of Kingby Electronics"". Saint: ""No you're not. You're Roger Thornhill of Madison Avenue and you're wanted for murder on every front page in America. Don't be so modest!!"".
Grant to Mason: ""Apparently the only performance that's going to satisfy you is when I play dead"". Mason: ""Your very next role. You will be quite convincing, I assure you"". Grant (to Leo G. Carroll): ""I'm an advertising man, not a red herring. I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives and several bartenders dependent upon me and I don't intend to disappoint them all by getting myself slightly killed. The answer is no"". James Mason discussing how to get rid of Saint: ""This matter is best disposed of from a great height - over water!"". And Mason again to a police officer: ""That wasn't very sporting, using real bullets"".

This is a fast moving witty thriller in magnificent Technicolor with Cary Grant as Roger O. Thornhill giving the performance of a lifetime. Grant is mistaken for government agent George Kaplan and is thrust into one life threatening situation after another on the run from both the police and the bad guys! It's a roller coaster ride of thrills, suspense, comedy and romance skilfully put together with the expert Hitchcock touch.

""North by Northwest"" was Cary Grant's fourth collaboration with legendary director Alfred Hitchcock and in my opinion it was definitely THE BEST! Everything came together in this one - the acting by the principals was first class, the brilliant script by Ernest Lehman was packed with sparkling and witty dialogue and the music score by Bernard Herrmann was outstanding. Cary Grant as Roger O. Thornhill was at his most elegant and although nearly 60 at the time threw himself into this very physical part with the energy and vigour of a much younger man. James Mason as the chief heavy Phillip Vandamm was particularly good in a smooth and menacing portrayal. Eva Marie Saint (Eve Kendall) was the archetypal ice cool blonde favoured by Hitchcock in so many of his films. There were some fine supporting roles of note including that wonderful actress Jessie Royce Landis as Grant's mother (although in reality only a few months older than him!). This actress also appeared with Cary Grant in another Hitchcock film ""To Catch a Thief"" in which she played Grace Kelly's mother. Martin Landau (in his first screen role), Adam Williams and Robert Ellenstein were excellent as Mason's sinister and threatening confederates. Veteran actor Leo G. Carroll was making his sixth appearance for Hitchcock as the CIA/FBI Agent known only as the ""Professor"". One of my favourite actresses Doreen Lang had the small part of Grant's secretary Maggie and can also be seen in other Hitchcock films such as ""The Wrong Man"" and ""The Birds"".

""North by Northwest"" returned to Hitchcock's favourite theme of the innocent man on the run from both the villains and the police and being trapped in one tight corner after another. There were some marvellous and professionally photographed Hitchcock set pieces in unusual locations such as the United Nations Building, New York's Grand Central Station, Mount Rushmore and who can forget the famous crop dusting sequence at Prairie Stop on deserted Highway 41. There was also a long train sequence which is another Hitchcock trademark. Other Alfred Hitchcock films using the ""man on the run"" idea were notably ""The 39 Steps"" (1934) and ""Saboteur"" (1942).

Some favourite lines from the film:

Cary Grant (to group in Townsend's house): ""What a performance!"".

Jessie Royce Landis (to Cary Grant): ""Roger .... pay the two dollars"".

Cary Grant (to Eva Marie Saint): ""Why are you so good to me?"".

Malcolm Atterbury (to Grant): ""That's funny, that plane's dusting crops where there ain't no crops"".

Cary Grant (to Adam Williams): ""Sorry old man. Too bad. Keep trying!"".

It has been suggested that James Stewart constantly pestered Alfred Hitchcock for the lead in this film but Hitchcock held out for his first choice - Cary Grant - who was, in retrospect, the ideal actor for this role. What a fantastic film - a Hitchcock classic - one that can be enjoyed over and over again with increasing pleasure. Surprisingly, ""North by Northwest"" did not win any Oscars that year and Hitchcock, Cary Grant and the film itself were not even nominated which in my opinion was a regrettable oversight.",977184000,,5475,4.90280777537797

114288,5,0790743213,"Warner Bros. has outdone itself with this new, pull-out-the-stops, first-class presentation of one of Hitch's best films.
  When I first read that Warners had rights to the film and would subsequently be releasing the DVD, I was nervous. Though the studio has championed the format from its very inception, I remained concerned that they would simply rehash the laserdisc transfer from a few years back and issue the title in their ""bargain"" DVD line due to the age of the film, and thus consign Hitchcock fans to suffer the ignominy of seeing ""North by Northwest"" denied the top flight treatment lavished by Universal Studios on the Hitchcock titles they control. (Universal's stubborn refusal to re-issue the impressively restored ""Vertigo"" in anamorphic should be a crime, however.)
But what a surprise this disc turned out to be!! Warner Bros. was paying attention, and one-upped Universal with this terrific effort. Simply stated, the picture quality on this disc is ASTONISHING. This is without question the best this film has ever looked - and that has only partly to do with the resolution and stability of digital video. A completely new print has been struck, and cleaned up - indeed, it is doubtful the film looked this good on its opening night premiere. There's hardly a nick or scratch to be seen, and grain is totally absent. It's as if they took a giant sponge and wiped years of age-induced desaturation away.
Anamorphically enhanced, the DVD's compression is excellent - blacks are velvety and rich, color is deep and vibrant, and edge enhancement (which results in unnatural ""shimmer"") is seemingly non-existant. For a film of this vintage, the image is nothing short of eye-popping, especially if the DVD player's component video outputs are used. Hopefully, this should raise the bar for Universal, whose releases (save for ""Vertigo"") of Hitch's films have tended to be grainy and a bit nicked-up in areas, though certainly still bettering any previous video incarnations. All the special features in the world don't make a difference if the print of the movie itself isn't presented in the best way possible. Make no mistake, the Universal releases look good - very good - but not as good as this one does.
  If you're a Hitchcock fan like me, owning this film is a no-brainer. If you're a film fan at all, this classic deserves - no, demands - a place in your collection. That Warner Brothers has paid it proper respect with a DVD of this quality (not only is the transfer sparkling, but the extras are rich in content and well done, too) is something that, like the film, is truly wonderful.",976147200,48,2615,4.8961625282167045
114289,5,0790743213,"This is by far the most purely entertaining of Hitchcock's movies, at least of the ones I've seen. ""Psycho"", while otherwise engrossing, gets bogged down mightily during its middle third. ""Vertigo"" is long and a touch ponderous. ""The Birds"" has flashes of kinetic energy, and then a lot of dreariness. ""North by Northwest"", however, is a complete thriller. Or rather, a Complete Thriller. It never makes any pretensions towards grand statements -- although there is a minor note spoken about the Cold War -- preferring to let its bullet-train of a plot lead the way.
The opening credits are again done wonderfully by Saul Bass, underscored by Bernard Herrmann, whose music is the sheer definition of ""Hitchcockian"" -- melodramatic and menacing in all the right parts. And barely a minute after the credits end, Roger Thornhill is in up to his ears after a brilliant little bit of confusion. Forget about character development and motivation, Hitchcock seems to be saying, let's get this story going. And it never lets up until the glorious end, where it finishes up as quick and neatly as it started. It's a wonderful ride.
All the actors are suitably fun in their parts. Eva Marie Sainte is great as the love interest. It's unfair to classify her as the prototype of the 'Bond girl'. She has too much of a head on her shoulders for that tag (although when talking of her sex appeal it's appropriate). James Mason uses that distinctive voice of his to bring both charm and menace to his role as the villain. And Cary Grant, as Thornhill, is just too cool for school! He delivers the tight, Ernest Lehman-penned script as if he always has a cocktail in one hand and a beautiful woman in the other. And the deeper into the Thornhill's mess he gets, the more fun he seems to be having. The scene where he calls for a valet to clean his suit is the clincher; it strikes me as Hitchcock having some devilish fun with us. For Grant, even after being sprayed by a crop-duster in a cornfield or scaling the faces on Mt. Rushmore, doesn't ever need his suit cleaned. He is never less than dapper and debonair. And that's part of the fun of the movie. It's a big cartoon with cartoon-sized settings, a cartoon-style plot, and cartoon characters running around and chasing each other.

The folks  behind the DVD apparently agree; they take the movie off its pedestal and  have some fun with it.  Running footsteps playfully appear on the menu  screen, then the theme music kicks in as still shots from the famous scenes  move before us behind the menu options.

But that minor  flaw isn't a deal-breaker by any means.  After all, if you're getting a  crisp letterboxed version of ""North by Northwest"" (as you are  here), then the extras can be made up of Brady Bunch reruns and no one  would complain.

114320,5,0790743213,"NORTH BY NORTHWEST was my favorite Hitchcock film for many years.  I was a  teenager and much preferred Hitch's classy, sexy man-on-the-run film to any  of the films of the 80's (besides STAR WARS!)  The just-released DVD of  this 1959 film looks excellent.  The colors and crispness of the picture  are truly extraordinary.  Again, I praise the benefits of DVD!  And this  disc is such a great example of how to do it right, especially with our  older films.
The documentary that accompanies the film is hosted by Eva  Marie Saint (who is still a handsome and classy lady).  Although not as  thorough as the documentaries on recent Hitch DVD releases (MARNIE, THE  BIRDS...) this one will do.  There are some nice behind the scenes photos  and info.  The documentary director seems to skim over everything,  however.
My favorite thing about NORTH BY NORTHWEST (besides all the  obvious Hitch directing embelishments...) is the script by Ernest Lehman.  This is a GREAT script.  And no one writes sexy leading man and leading  lady dialogue like Lehman:  ""I'm a big girl,"" coos Eva Marie  Saint.  ""Yes, and in all the right places,"" responds suave Cary  Grant.  This is just perfect!  And the sex is implied.  I am not a prude --  it is just so smart the way Lehman ""hooks up"" Grant and Saint in  the train scene.  You don't need to show them having sex.  And when we get  to the auction scene later in the film, Saint gives such an emotional  performance that you know is rooted in the train scene.
And the chase at  Mt. Rushmore in the final reel is very exciting and stylistic all at once.  Hitch is a genius.

114321,5,0790743213,"No introduction required for this one: Alfred Hitchcock's is one of the  most popular classic of all time, and it certainly deserves to be so.  Watching NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a pure joy of cinema. It's thrilling,  exciting and hilarious. You just get carried away with the master's perfect  art of storytelling.
Many critics tried to ""decode"" the deeper  meaning of this  film in a vain effort to ""intellectualize""  Hitch's art. But the point is: there are really no serious message or  psychological which understanding is vital to understand the film (which is  quite the contrary from VERTIGO, his previous film, and PSYCHO, the one he  made right after this one).  The best way to understand this particular  film is to just enjoy it. And boy, how enjoyable this movie is!
The new  deluxe collector's edition DVD offers, first of all, a solid good transfer.  I must congratulate MGM for keeping such a good care of the original  elements. Unlike VERTIGO for which a lot of restoration works was required  (and the end result still has some unrepairable deteriorations, even though  it generally looks far better than how VERTIGO used to look for the last 17  years or so), NORTH BY NORTHWEST is preserved very well. This DVD  represents the magnificence of the original VISTAVISON/IB-TECHNICOLOR  images quite faithfully. The images are crisp-sharp  (one great virtue of  this now almost extinct process) and the colors are vibrant, deeply  saturated and very rich. However, some of the rear-projection process shots  (for examples, exteriors seen through a moving car window) look a bit faded  and need a little work to be done. But don't worry, the final Mount  Rushmore is transfered superbly, with all the miniature works, back-drop  paintings, matpaintings  and process shots are intact and are so effective.  In fact, when properly done, the old techniques look as good as the recent  digital CGI effects, maybe better.
I'm not quite sure about the Dolby 5-1  stereo because the film must have been made originally with a Mono  soundtrack (or 3 channels Perspecta stereo), but at least it doesn't have  the awful redone foley job which sounded quite ugly on the restored  VERTIGO, so we can say it stays more faithful to what Hitch intended. Plus,  I have to admit the new soundtrack REALLY brings out the magnificent  orchestration of Bernard Herrmann's beautifully composed score!
Herrmann was one of the very few film composer who did his own  orchestration. He was an uncompromised artist.  By the way, you can enjoy  the richness of the score with the music-only track as well.
An added  enjoyment is the original theatrical trailer featuring Mr. Hitchcock  himself, which was not on the previous LD release.
The DVD also features  a good documentary about the making of the film which, unlike a  conventional featurette where the filmmakers and the actors are just  glorified in a phony promotional manner, really tells you about how a movie  was made in those days. It even tells you how Cary Grant charged 15 cents  to every autograph he gave to the fans! Unfortunately, Hitch himself is no  longer with us to give a commentary for DVD fans, but the writer Ernest  Lehman (also known for the screen adaptations of WEST SIDE STORY and THE  SOUND OF MUSIC) tells about how he wrote this original screenplay and  cleverly points out the subtle intelligence in Hitch's masterful direction.  Critics and scholars (including myself, I must admit) often talk only about  big scenes and flashy camera works which catch your eyes at the first  moment you see them, but Lehman made me think how subtle a director's  genius is, and that makes the whole difference from all the poorly made  films that we see so often in the thriller genre today.",968544000,26,3752,4.907348242811501

Here Sir  Alfred is able to keep the audiance off balance with the fact that Mr.  Grants character Roger Thornhill, is mistaken for American Intelligance Spy  George Kaplin and taken hostage by James Masons (Van Damme) hench men. If  that is not enough to start the ball rolling, just when Thornehill is about  to clear his name he is seen murdering a delagate inside the United  Nations!

114324,5,0790743213,"By the time this film was released in 1959, Alfred Hitchcock had been  honing his classic ""innocent man on the run"" theme for 33 years,  begining with ""The Lodger"" in 1926 and continuing through such  landmarks as ""The 39 Steps,"" ""The Lady Vanishes"" and  ""Saboteur."" Representing the culmination of this fascination with  innocents on the run, this film is one of the finest comic adventure films  of all time, one with the pace of a juggernaught.
The cast is one for the  ages.  Cary Grant (along with Jimmy Stewart, THE great Hitchcock hero) is  superb, especially in his exasperated comic reactions to his rediculous  predicaments (catch his drunken reaction as the wheels of his car slide off  the side of the road!).  Eva Marie Saint is wonderful as this film's  Hitchcock ice princess and James Mason virtually defines the classic urbane  villian.
This is an eye-popping DVD.  As someone who has owned the  earlier VHS and Laserdisc releases of this classic, I can reasonably state  that this film hasn't looked better in forty-one years.  The images are  sharp and clean; the colors are warm and rich.  Bernard Hermann's great  score has never sounded better.
The ""making of"" documentary is  fascinating, especially for those of us who are Hitchcock fanatics.  Hosted  by Eva Marie Saint, it features appearances by Martin Landau and writer  Ernest Lehman, who provide backround on the making of the film.  Interestingly, the first actor considered for the lead was Jimmy Stewart.  One can only wonder what kind of film might have resulted from his  casting!
Simply said, this film is a must have for anyone who cares about  film.",967939200,2,1637,4.915441176470588
114345,5,0790743213,"North by Northwest and Vertigo are tied as my all time favorite movies.  Vertigo is more emotionally moving, while NxNW is simply more fun.  This is the perfect film to show certain members of the younger generation who think the art of movie making began with Star Wars or The Matrix.  Those who have seen it know this film  reaches as close to the pinnacle of perfection as any film ever has - or  probably ever will.  Screenplay, acting, cinematography, score,  editing--they cannot be improved upon.  (The only exception to this is some  of the optical effects during the Mount Rushmore sequence.  Astonishing for 1959, they look rather dated today.)

Warner Brothers, which owns the  rights to this MGM film, is to be commended for the excellent care they have taken with the restoration.  Colors - especially flesh tones - are  deeper and richer without looking ""colorized.""  The image is crisp, the print clean and dazzlingly free of artifacts.  The sound (the  original release was in mono) has been rechanneled for Dolby 5.1, but the  restoration team has shown enough restraint not to create extraneous aural effects for their own sake.

As for the extras, the documentary hosted by the timeless Eva Maria Saint is an insightful and entertaining look at the making of the film.  There are two audio supplements:  a running commentary by Ernest Lehman which occasionally sags (one wonders why Saint and Martin Landau did not participate); the music only audio track  featuring Bernard Herrmann's superb score is a dazzling demonstration of  the importance of film scoring - you can watch this track and understand the film just as well as with the dialogue.  There is also an assortment of trailers, including an amusing one with Hitchcock, and a production still gallery.

This is a must for every DVD collection!

UPDATE, June, 2010:

The above review is for the DVD.  In the years since it was written, my admiration for North by Northwest has only increased, and I have since acquired NxNW on Blu-ray.  I recommend the Blu-ray version for several reasons.

The image quality has been further improved, to the extent that occasional blemishes can be seen on Cary Grant's face.  (Grant had a perpetually tan skin color - which may be why some have claimed the DVD was badly ""color corrected"" - but was in fact caused by spending many hours outdoors.)  Surprisingly, the increased clarity of Blu-ray actually improves the visual effects experience - they look better at high definition.

The sound mix is similar to the DVD: improved over the original film's mono track, but not overdone.  More alternate languages are provided than in the DVD, including Italian and German.

In addition to the screenwriter commentary, isolated score, trailers, and Destination: Hitchcock featurette from the original DVD, the Blu-ray offers The Master's Touch, a one hour retrospective on Hitchcock, a 90 minute bio of Gary Grant, and a 25 minute North by Northwest piece featuring several modern filmmakers' thoughts on the film.

'North By Northwest' is more lighthearted and fun  than those films, less psychologically oriented and more glossy good old  fashioned entertainment. Hitchcock took the 'innocent man on the run'  dilemma he practically invented in 'The 39 Steps' and then further explored  in 'Saboteur, but perfected in this classic film. In one of the definitive  Cary Grant roles, Grant was in peak form and at his most charming. It's  hard to imagine anyone else as Roger Thornhill or any other person who can  melt women with just a look, only Grant can do that. Endlessly entertaining  and sprinkled with wit and intrigue, one of the classic screen  entertainments. This time Eva Marie Saint is the 'icy blonde' a look that  obviously appealed to Hitchcock and a lot of actresses are living proof of  that; Grace Kelly, Kim Novak, Madeleine Carroll, Janet Leigh, etc. There is  an incredibly sexy (and long) kissing sequence that could compare with the  one Grand and Ingrid Bergman had in Hitch's 'Notorious', while not as tense  or as unbearably sexy it's still as memorable. James Mason is excellent as  the villainous Phillip Vandamme and this is one rare occasion when his  voice does not seem distracting in fact it kind of fits appropriately.  Martin Landau is also equally memorable as Vandamme's thug, there are some  homosexual undercurrents to his character. Filled with many memorable  scenes like the assassination in the UN, Cary Grant trying to drive a car  while drunk and of course the now classic crop-dusting sequence that is  pure Hitchcock genius all the way. The cliffhanger ending on Mount Rushmore  is incredibly suspenseful and equally memorable. One of the most constantly  entertaining films of all time, Hitchcock at his peak and at his most  charming. Extras: Hitchcock's usual cameo; this time as the man who barely  misses the bus in the beginning credits. From a scale of 1-10 I give this  film a 10!",965001600,14,2016,5.015105740181269

114354,5,0790743213,"Compare this first-rate romantic comedy-thriller to Hitchcock's more  ""serious"" works, and it might not seem like it amounts to  much...and maybe it doesn't.  For NORTH BY NORTHWEST was built for one  purpose and one purpose alone--to entertain.  But rarely do films entertain  so intelligently, and so economically (even at 136 minutes, there isn't an  unnecessary shot in the entire story).  Beneath the seemingly lightweight  surface bubbles the same craftsmanship, the same rigorous attention to  detail that made such acclaimed masterpieces as VERTIGO and PSYCHO.
The  story, featuring Cary Grant as an innocent man mistaken for a secret agent  and Eva Marie Saint as the seductive blonde with her own mysterious agenda,  is delightfully twisted, yet despite its complexity it's never confusing or  overwrought.  The script is not only perfectly paced but brilliantly witty  (Grant in particular gets the best lines).  Again, not a single shot is  wasted.  Almost every scene is memorable--the hilarious ""drunk  driving"" sequence, the trs risqu dinner chat on the train, the  crop-dusting sequence, the auction, and of course, the chase across Mt.  Rushmore...all this in a magnificent package shot with Hitchcock's  trademark precision and typically warped sense of humor.
This is one of  those movies where every single element works just right--the dialogue, the  acting, the direction, the dazzling visuals, and Bernard Herrmann's  pitch-perfect score.  It's not one of those movies that require the viewer  to sit through hours of boredom for ten minutes of great entertainment.  Every moment of NORTH BY NORTHWEST feels like a separate payoff; every  moment entertains.  Does it have the psychological dimension and disturbing  thematic weightiness of VERTIGO and PSYCHO?  No.  But for my money, it's  the most enjoyable and satisfying movie Hitchcock ever made.",960595200,,1873,5.475352112676056

Rushmore; that  Jessie Royce Landis is old enough to be Cary Grant's mother, etc.)--and  just enjoy this ride.  I've seen this movie several times and tend to  forget the details between viewings--which allows me to be surprised all  over again. And surprise is what North by Northwest is all about.
Casting  James Mason and a young but very creepy Martin Landau as the villains was  sheer genius. Eva Marie Saint is the icy blonde in this one and suggests a  fair amount of fire beneath that ice.  Grant, already in his mid-50s, was  obviously meant to be younger (mid-40s at the most), but you'll find  yourself suspending disbelief about that and everything else and just  allowing yourself to get caught up in this extremely entertaining film.  There is no better example of Hitchcock's cinematic mastery.  Aside from  the aforementioned crop duster pursuit (scarier than any low-flying plane  scene in any WWII movie), there's the classic Rushmore sequence, and, of  course, the tunnel bit at the  end which delighted would-be Freudian  critics with its (daring for the time?) symbolism.  It's as witty as it is  adventurous, with a wonderful Ernest Lehman script, excellent  cinematography by Robert Burks and a great score by Bernard Herrmann.

I understand that the colour in this film is meant to be vivid,Colour is  important in other Hitchcock films such as, Marnie, which I think is far  better than N by NW. In Marnie red is important because of what happened to  her as a child, in N by NW is it really necessary for Cary Grants skin tone  to be so orange? It has no significance to the film what so ever.  After  watching the film repeatedly, much to my distress,a question was brought up  on the relationship between the two villains, Vandam and Lenard. In one  scene Rodger (Grant) and Eve (Saint) are walking along the train platform  and the love music  is on, then the shot switches to the villians and the  music doesn't change could this mean that there is something romantic going  on between them? Even though there is no visual evidence Lenard does say  something about 'his womans intuition'. Do we really care? Some people  might but I'm afraid This film really did disappoint me. The fight scenes  were slow and the love scenes slobbering!

The story is really quite simple; a successful New York ad executive (Cary Grant, in superb form!) is mistaken for an American espionage agent by a group of Soviet spies (led by the ruthlessly suave James Mason, and his aide, a youthful yet sinister Martin Landau! ), and a cat-and-mouse cross-country chase begins, culminating on top of Mount Rushmore. Along the way, Grant is ridiculed by his mother (Jesse Royce Landis, who is hilarious, if actually YOUNGER than Grant!), seduced by double-agent Eva Marie Saint (in the sexiest role of her career!), chased across a cornfield by a lethal cropduster (in one of the greatest scenes in film history!), and recruited into the intelligence community (represented by future 'Man from U.N.C.L.E.' boss, Leo G. Carroll!), while Bernard Herrman's unforgettable music punctuates each scene!

Cary Grant is excellent as  always, James Mason plays one of the most sinister of Hitchcock's villains  (I would LOVE to have this guy's voice) and Eva Marie Saint looks gorgeous  and plays her part well.  I also enjoyed seeing Martin Landau in an early  role as one of James Mason's henchmen and Jessie Royce Landis (the mother  from ""To Catch a Thief"") as Grant's mother (although both were  very near the same age at the time).  And I love any film score by Bernard  Herrmann - this guy should have had a mantle covered with awards, but as  luck would have it, most of his scores went not only un-awarded but  un-nominated (as this one did).

He keeps staring at him, but at first he doesn't really care  about the plane, but when it keeps approching him he starts to wonder, and  after a few moments, it flies right above his head, only about a meter  over.

I imagine that the last time ""North by Northwest looked this good was when it was originally released in 1959. For the first time we get a video transfer that reproduces the rich color and texture of the 1950s Technicolor dye-transfer process -- colors are luxuriously warm. The high definition transfer offers an amazing level of detail -- you can see the fabric texture of Cary Grant's suit. The overall effect, is that it looks like a 35mm film is being projected on my TV screen.

Some people have claimed that the original DVD release looks better. These claims are simply ridiculous. Yes, the DVD version was brighter, but it was too bright. Case and opening is the opening credits. In the DVD release the green is so bright it's almost neon. The DVD was one of the first films that Lowry Digital restored; Lowry admits that their early efforts removed too much grain and and left the image too bright -- they made the restored image look like HD video. The ""Citizen Kane"" DVD is similarly problematic.

The Blu-ray also boats more accurate color than the DVD. In the crop dumpster scene on the DVD you can clearly see that the transfer has too much red -- notice how red the sky is. There have also been complaints that Cary Grant is still too tan. Given that the color is more accurate, and everyone else's skin tones look correct, I suspect he really was that tan and/or wore too much makeup.

Hitchcock proves that flashy special effects are not needed as Grant, while  drugged, drives down a curving, moutain road, and the viewer is taken along  for the ride with a fuzzy point-of-view shot. It makes you squirm right out  of your seat. See this movie if you never have experienced Hitchcock's  psychologocal mind-games or if you haven't yet realized that Cary Grant is  THE leading man of the century.",947030400,,626,5.029126213592233
114418,5,0790743213,"People feel the need to qualify their love of this movie.  ""It is very entertaining,"" I hear.  Or someone will say, ""North by Northwest is one Hitchcock's greatest light films.""  All, of course,  utter rubbish.  North by Northwest is simply one of the greatest films ever  made, period.  No need for qualifiers here.
Cary Grant, an ad man, is  mistaken for a spy and chased around America by both sides in the cold war.  Saint is the mysterious blonde who helps along the way.
People who  minimize this film usually focus on the fact that most of this film's plot  has been summarized in the above paragraph.  This is not a film for your  brain, however (although I still contend your mind will not starve feasting  on this movie), but for your feelings, physical and emotional.  The  suspense (which is greatly enhanced in widescreen) is near maddening, and  the heat and warmth of pure passion (yes, heat AND warmth) is an even more  exhausting rollercoaster ride than the usual thrills.
Listing  highlights is near useless; either you already know them by heart, or they  will look pathetic reduced to the written word.  It is worth pointing out,  however, that for all the attention garnished on the more famous  cropdusting / Mount Rushmore scenes, the best moments here may well be at  the auction toward the end of the film.  Danger, both of life and of the  heart, is extremely palpable here, slithering down your neck, oozing down  your spine, and twisting over to smother your heart, and Hitch still  manages to sneak in some of his best laughs at the very same time!  Amazingly, neither the humor nor suspense is lessened by the other's  prescence.
Hitchcock didn't try to delve into warped psyches in this film  (a la Vertigo) or make any sort of political statement (a la Foreign  Correspondent); he simply wanted to do what he does best:  make a good  suspense film.
He wound up making the best one ever, and one of the five  or ten best films of all time.",945734400,2,1970,4.627906976744186
114419,5,0790743213,I can only hope this movie is released on DVD at some point so it can be viewed as it was originally shown. A remastered 35mm print is currently playing in San Francisco and I saw it today. Incredible! Bernard Hermann's  score is awesome. The dialogue is witty. And the action is breathtaking.,940464000,4,293,4.528301886792453
114420,5,0790743213,"As the first true ""action"" movie, one might argue that ""North by Northwest"" has a lot to answer for.  Let's face it--many of the conventions Hitchcock uses here have been used and re-used  by scores of wannabe directors since the movie's 1958 release.  The  falsely-accused man (""The Fugitive,"" ""The  Negotiator,"").  The mysterious blonde with ambiguous loyalties  (""Into the Night,"" ""Snake Eyes"",  ""Chinatown"").  The lone hero with an incredible serendipity  factor (""Die Hard,"" ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"").  The  famous backdrops (every single James Bond movie except ""License to  Kill"").  Why do we find these old chestnuts so compelling, time after  time?  Perhaps because they were once done so well...
On a side note, I  do believe this movie contains just about the most romantic three minutes  in movie history, during the scene in the train compartment.  Notice how  their hands are always in the shot?
All in all, this movie represents one  of the three best ways you can spend two hours.  I forget what the other  two are.",935366400,4,1032,5.047904191616767
