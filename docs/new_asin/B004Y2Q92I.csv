8447883,5,B004Y2Q92I,"This concert was performed on September 5,2009 at the IZU in Japan. Possibly the closest to this performance time wise would be Rocking out the Bats Spandau Berlin. Sadly,this is currently not available on Amazon. Given the fallout from the SNB abandoning the Euro peg at the time of this writing,it's either this or the solitude of the FTSE 100 summary list. Don't think you have little choice. This is a fine concert selection. Edgar might wax nostalgic about the days going back to their early albums;you must remember that he was playing The Berlin Wall before Dark Side of the Moon was issued. From opening to closing remarks is approximately 104 minutes. The light show and special fx are superb. Normal production values are upheld.",1421539200,,739,4.873015873015873
8447884,5,B004Y2Q92I,"Great concert but only stereo on this Blu Ray due to an obvious pressing fault. Am not sure about the reviews saying it won't play - are they for this Blu Ray or for the DVD version? TD's DVD's are often region free, and I think the blu ray is too. However I think some versions released by other companies rather than Eastgate themselves may be Region 2 and that may be the reason some can't play them. If that is the case then that is nothing to do with TD.",1405641600,,459,4.054945054945055
8447885,5,B004Y2Q92I,"This was a bit hard to come by, I got lucky and happened to see 1 copy available from Germany, usually none are listed even directly from Tangerine Dreams site.
This is the most active audience I have seen in any concert yet, they are really digging it and let that show. The music starts of high energy and keeps going. There are much fewer special effects, light show type things in this concert. I heard several tunes that were new to me, all and all worth waiting for. Linda Spas hat is something else, something of a ""Pied Piper"" look. The audience reacts like a wave throughout the concert. Keep on the lookout if you are wanting this disk, perhaps one will pop up like it did for me. Shipping took a couple of weeks from Germany but the price was good.",1398211200,,759,4.314685314685315
8447886,4,B004Y2Q92I,"If you happen to own one of the newer OPPO DIGITAL Blu Ray players, this disc plays fine which is why I gave the title 4 stars. I understand the frustration of the other reviewers because of this PAL limitation. On my OPPO, the audio, as available on this Blu Ray, is basically older fashioned Dolby Surround but still comes across as pretty fantastic. The images on this on Blu-Ray is quite superior when compared to my other PAL formatted TD DVD's that I own so I have no regrets on buying this from Amazon back in December and if you are a true TD fan, and have the appropriate hardware, then I would still put this on your ""buy"" list.",1340841600,2,638,4.2809917355371905
8447887,1,B004Y2Q92I,"Tangerine Dream: a terrific band with a long track record of great music and great concerts.
So imagine how frustrating it was to have received this much-anticipated DVD and find out it was not compatible with my Blu-Ray player. Not sure why this incompatibility was not included in the product description.
I had heard great things about this concert and thought I was finally able to see it. I guess I will just have to carry the DVD with me next time I visit Europe and watch it then.",1333584000,2,487,4.48314606741573
8447888,1,B004Y2Q92I,"I'm sure this is a wonderful DVD, if you can get it to play. However, I live in the U.S. I tried this DVD on four different DVD players, and it doesn't work on any of them. I get no sound and no video on three of the DVD players. I get sound-only (no video) on the fourth DVD player (which is a Blu-Ray DVD player), except when I press ""Pause,"" and a video frame will show for a second. I put some of my other DVDs in all of the DVD players (to make sure that my DVD players weren't the problem), and my regular DVDs played fine on all of them.
I suspect that this is one of those European-only format DVDs that doesn't play on U.S. DVD players.",1328486400,2,645,3.931297709923664
