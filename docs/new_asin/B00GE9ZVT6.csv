6074204,4,B00GE9ZVT6,"This movie shows the path someone takes when they have a dream they want to follow.  It shows the desperation and lengths people will go to in order to actualize a dream.  The script is moving as you journey with the main character and see her determination and set backs.  Anybody who's ever wanted something badly and decided to give themselves a try, step out on faith should watch the film!",1402444800,2,394,4.52112676056338
6074205,5,B00GE9ZVT6,"An aspiring Berlin actress becomes a medical test subject to pay for acting school, and eventually gets swept-up in the Hollywood sex trade while struggling to realize her dreams of stardom. 25-year-old Ana had almost given up on becoming an actress until she realized she could pay her tuition by selling her body to science. But when things don't go quite as Ana planned, she throws caution to the wind and travels to Hollywood. She's convinced that her big break is just around the corner, but the longer she stays in the city, the more her morals are compromised. Later, by the time Ana has started prostituting herself for cash, her dreams of stardom begin to feel as distant the twinkling lights in the nighttime sky.",1394582400,6,723,4.746031746031746

6074210,4,B00GE9ZVT6,"All the girls are attractive except for the whining lead, who aspires to be thin and rich but is neither.  Maybe in the sequel she gets to look like the come-on cover shot for this movie - unhealthy but alluring - otherwise no one looks like that.  I got a kick out of the bitchy head nurse - the epitome of nasty, arrogant German human relations.  The stereotype is common enough for it to be true, but I can say that when I've been under the authority of Germans I've never encountered it.  On the other hand I've encountered it plenty of times in America.  So part of the fun is imagining the compounded distress of the Heroine after she leaves the drug study and shows up in L.A.  No free medical here, babe.",1445126400,,712,4.276119402985074
6074211,1,B00GE9ZVT6,Pure German language rubbish.  The music and everything else about the premise of this movie is not worth the effort of watching it.,1444694400,2,132,4.739130434782608
6074212,5,B00GE9ZVT6,"A great film written, produced, directed by Carolin Von Petzholdt.  The film is compelling and has a gutsy feel suitable to the grit, determination and passion of a young woman determined to make it to America.  I think we can certainly expect more from Ms. Petzholdt in the years to come as she certainly will not let anything stand in her way.  SeeTESTING LIFE.",1402963200,2,363,4.640625
6074213,5,B00GE9ZVT6,"A real and raw story that brings inspiration to seeing one's dreams come true.  Great acting and cinematography, I would recommend anyone watching to get a dose of what some have to go through in order to see their dreams come to life. Very inspirational",1402876800,,254,4.644444444444445
6074214,5,B00GE9ZVT6,A deeply touching story about fighting for a dream and therefore taking every risk. Almost unknown actors are making this movie beautifully alive and believable in every moment. Quickly soaked into the life of main character Ana Suess it's almost heartbreaking to watch her through her desperate and lonely struggle becoming an actress in Hollywood. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who wants to see a great piece of human will and looking forward to watch more from up and coming filmmaker Carolin v. Petzholdt.,1402790400,,521,5.069767441860465
6074215,5,B00GE9ZVT6,I was really impressed with this movie! Carolin Von Petzholdt's honest depiction of the strange isolating world and shady practices of drug companies was very interesting.  You can't help but relate to the main character as you go with her on a journey to leave her lonely life and travel to the destination of her dreams: Los Angeles.  A great film by an up and coming filmmaker!,1402531200,3,380,4.656716417910448

8622454,1,B00GE9ZVT6,"this movie was absolutely terrible. i have no idea what people are thinking saying that it is some great movie unless they were paid for their review. The main character is painfully ugly to look at, overweight, has no social skills and is pessimistic and allows herself to be made into a victim, and despite isolating herself at parties and never being social, let alone having any semblance of star quality, when other people come up to her, because she never approaches anyone or makes new friends on her own, she tells them she is an actress or going to be one, depending on how ridiculous she wants to sound at the time. There is no possible way that someone who looks like her, with her bone structure and absolutely terrible personality for anything where you even talk to other people could ever land a role let alone make it as an actress, especially a famous one or a movie star. This movie is seriously low budget and obviously they looked for the most average or unattractive girl they could find to play the lead role, but there is no way she will ever star in anything else in her life. dragging her feet making an ugly face with makeup under her eyes as dark circles and breathing heavy is something ANYONE can do. that is not acting. kids do that to get out of school! Honestly she came across as someone with aspbergers and completely delusional thinking she could be a famous celebrity.

I kept hoping the acting would get better so i watched the whole thing, but no one in the entire film was even doing any acting. they just said their lines or ate something or walked from one place to another etc, with absolutely no feeling in it. They were so empty and flat they didn't come across human, and i found myself hoping the girl would die from her stupid decision, because then at least the movie would be dark and it would make more sense- but absolutely NOTHING about this movie made sense.

As I said, unless the positive reviews were by people who got paid, I don't understand it- unless they are biased because they commented saying stuff about the evil pharmaceutical industry and have an axe to grind and would give any movie about that a 5 star rating. This movie was terrible, and they're lying when they say it is good. Even saying it isn't a complete disaster would be lying. It is a complete disaster.",1452556800,,2332,4.484705882352941
8622455,3,B00GE9ZVT6,"Surprisingly pleasant. It actually has a theme, a story to tell and well acted. Unsure what the sarong clad girl on the cover has anything to do with the movie!",1447891200,,160,4.366666666666666

8622457,3,B00GE9ZVT6,"This was a cleverly done film that held my interest for the entire length. It is not what I was expecting, but that is a positive. So many films these days are so drearily predictable. The German drug company study was quite interesting. I must commend Carolin Von Petzholdt on her first effort. She shows distinct promise. If there is a sequel, I would be eager to see it. I hope she doesn't wait 6 years to do it. ((By the way, three stars from me is quite good. I am notoriously stingy in my ratings))",1447459200,,504,4.260416666666667

This tale of an unscrupulous drug company taking advantage of the poor, defenseless hopeful heroine is completely implausible in the setting of 21st century Germany.  I could find no redeeming value at all to this one.",1446076800,,364,5.1525423728813555
