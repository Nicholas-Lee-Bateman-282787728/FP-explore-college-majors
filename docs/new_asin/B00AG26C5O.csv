5424097,2,B00AG26C5O,"I love doing different types of workouts and have used some of the mainstream dvd products (e.g., Insanity and Rushfit).  I like those much, much more than the Skogg at Home Phase I DVD.  I didn't love the workout.  Less important, I thought the production quality was surprisingly basic.  I realized I'd probably never use the DVD again and so I returned it.  For much less money, I did buy Bob Harper: Kettlebell Sculpted Body.  I thought it was not bad, though I would have preferred something more intense.  In summary, I know workout videos and didn't see this one as a keeper.  That said, it appears a lot of other people really love the Skogg line, so I think there's a good chance you'll like it more than I did.  Good luck!",1361491200,3,732,4.443609022556391
5424098,5,B00AG26C5O,"i bought the Skogg Kettlebell system 5 DVD set last year and this year (2013) i bought Michael Skogg at home phase-1 and Phase-2. unbelievable! now i know a reviewer mentioned the production quality of the DVD but you have to remember its recorded live from Skoog on-line classes. all 6 workouts on both DVDs are incredible! i did the Skogg Kettlebell 5-DVD set for almost a year before getting phase 1 & 2. the 5 DVD set is a great way to build a good foundation before hitting phase 1 & 2. definitely recommend to everyone and anyone considering working with kettlebells. ive seen a few other workouts by others and the form is awful, im glad Michael Skogg knows his stuff.",1360886400,7,675,4.495934959349594
5424099,4,B00AG26C5O,"I received this video yesterday, scanned through most of it last night, and did my first workout with it this morning.  I had been using the SKOGG System Kettlebell Workout 5 DVD Set for the past 5-6 months, getting to level 4 with a 16Kg or 20Kg bell (depending on routine) and was looking to add to my kettlebell routine.  If you've been doing kettlebells for a while you might be inclined to skip this and move right to the phase 2 disc as I was, but I chose to give this a try and I'm glad I did.  This disc starts with a level one routine that goes through the same six moves covered on the ""System"" discs.  It's very elementary of course but I did it anyway as a refresher on technique and I think it was worth it, I was reminded of a couple of points I had forgotten.  Next up is level two which is where the workouts really begin on this disc.  It is broken up into three types of workouts: Strength, Conditioning, and Power, each having two classes for a total of six workouts.  Each workout includes a warmup and cool-down.

I did Strength Class 1 this morning and at first I thought it was going to be fairly easy but it turned out to be somewhat challenging.  It wasn't the cardio workout of the ""System"" routine but challenging in a different way.  There are some of the standard six moves included in these workouts but more new and varied moves, both with and without bells.  These videos are more casual than the ""System""; discs with a less formal gym setting and actual gym instructors or members as participants.  It's kind of interesting to see some of the different forms and listen to Michael comment on them as the class progresses.  I had gotten pretty good at the four routines on the previous series so was surprised that I struggled with a couple of the new ones, I think these videos will introduce me to some muscles I forgot or didn't know I had.

I'm only giving this four stars instead of five because the production quality isn't on par with that of the first set, specifically there are no chapters which make is so easy to skip from warm-up to workout to cool-down as there are on the first set.  All in all I'm happy with this disc and am looking forward to getting proficient at it and moving on and try Phase 2, good job team Skogg.

I'll try to provide an update after I've been using this a while and have gone through all the classes.

UPDATE 2/16/13:
I've come to like these routines more now that I've done each several times. There is one or two of them that I wish had more kettlebell but all in all I am very pleased and will definitely be ordering Phase 2.  In response to the second reviewer, it's not the casual live recording that I was referring to above but rather the lack of chapters, the setting is fine.  I would very much prefer to be able to skip past the warm-up and/or workout introduction.  I would up my rating to 4-1/2 stars if I could.",1357344000,25,2898,4.292279411764706
5424100,5,B00AG26C5O,"First, I bought the Skogg System and used those on a consistent basis. To bring in some variety, I joined Virtual Skogg. I LOVED it, but got busy and it just wasn't worth having the membership anymore. I still use the Skogg System DVDs, but I bought this to bring in a little more variety. I was happy to see that the workouts actually came from the Virutal Skogg series. There are 2 strength, 2 power, and 2 conditioning workouts. With the Skogg System DVDs, I can rotate between all of the workouts and get plenty of variety! I love his system.

If you are a member of Virtual Skogg, you don't need this...again, the workouts actually come from VS, so just keep on going with that membership. If you  want some variety in your kettlebell workout routine, I'd definitely get this DVD....but make sure you have done the Skogg System, or already know how to do kettlebells. This is not for someone new to kettlebells.",1419206400,8,916,4.5120481927710845

5424103,5,B00AG26C5O,I got this for my son in law who already was using Skogg's DVD earlier series.  He does this work out several times a week.,1397088000,,123,3.92
5424104,1,B00AG26C5O,"Dear Skogg,

I heard Mr. Skogg speak (halfsizeme.com) and checked out some reviews. After what I thought was enough research I bought cd #1 (level 2 apparantely) and tried to do Skogg at home. I am in the process of losing 100 lbs. I thought this was something I could do and was quite excited. OH MY GOODNESS! ALL THE LUNGES. Great idea, assuming that one can bend her knees. And, so sad that there was not ONE alternative move. I was stuck. And don't even talk to me about the ""conditioning"" segment. There was NOTHING that I could do. My excitment ended in a feeling of total failure.

Please stop marketing this as something that overweight people might be able to do. We don't need to feel more like a failure. We need motivation and encouragement and something that is challenging but doable.

Sad about my purchase.",1381363200,8,822,4.54054054054054
5424105,4,B00AG26C5O,"Very good instruction.  Very thorough in explaining the Basic Moves on the Introductory class portion of the DVD.  With the way Michael talks to the camera, and demonstrates the moves, it is almost like you are getting a private session with him. Of course, the only thing is , you must check yourself for good form, especially during the cleans and snatches.",1377475200,,359,4.774193548387097
5424106,1,B00AG26C5O,I have the original Michael Skogg Kettlebell where he swings the bell the entire video and it's a workout.  This Home Phase 1 was more like lifting weights and lunges.  Too many lunges in the DVD.  I wold like to see Skogg go back to his original DVD set.  I shouldn't need 2 if the same weight kettlebell in my workout.  I may as well picked up regular weights.,1369267200,4,362,4.188405797101449

5424108,5,B00AG26C5O,This disk is a natural progression from the Skogg System 5 DVD set. This disk contains 6 workouts filmed at the Skogg Gym. Two each of Strength/Conditioning/Power......to use Skogg's terminology. The workouts seem to incorporate more Crossfit moves and some do not use the bells. Is more well rounded and a complete workout. I sweat my butt off. Worth $20.......I wish he would produce more.,1365120000,10,391,5.030769230769231

I just wanted to know how reputable someone is when they claim honors and accolades that are befitting of real heros.  Skogg is a Seal, just not of the military kind.  Highly recommend someone research his character before trying to support him financially.",1472860800,2,286,5.195652173913044

8551190,5,B00AG26C5O,"I don't understand the complaints about this DVD. I love working out to this one. It is worth the price just for the first strength workout (and there are 6 workouts total on the disc).

I purchased the original Skogg system DVDs about a year before this one. I would start there if you are new to kettlebell. Phase 1 takes what you learn with the Skogg system and goes further. There are a lot more moves/variations on this one. There are even body weight moves that don't use the kettlebell (like pushups, v-ups, etc...). I like the variation. It never gets boring.

I won't lie, the production and editing are not as slick as the Skogg system DVDs, but who cares? Are you buying this for it to look pretty, or to help you get in shape? I really don't see how that would matter. The workouts are sound.

I am very grateful for this excellent instruction. I hope to see more in the future.",1436832000,2,890,4.349397590361446
