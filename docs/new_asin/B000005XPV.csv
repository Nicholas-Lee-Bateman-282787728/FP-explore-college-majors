1188354,4,B000005XPV,"Douglas Sirk's 1959 remake of ""Imitation of Life"" has become one of the screen's legendary tear-jerkers. The story, from Fannie Hurst's novel, was previously filmed in 1934, starring Claudette Colbert and Louise Beavers. In the 1934 version, the two women (one white, one black) were business partners. In the 1959 version, the black woman is the white woman's maid. So much for racial advancement! However, the 1959 version is one of my guilty pleasures. The film is so OBVIOUSLY ""Hollywood"" and ""Plastic"" that I would have to agree with John Epperson, aka ""Lypsinka"", the hilariously performance artist, that Douglas Sirk was putting his own spin on ""The Hollywood Movie"". Lana Turner's hair is platinum blonde. Her wardrobe is predominantly white and beige. Her house is decorated in white-on-white. Her daughter, played by the very white Sandra Dee, is dressed in fluffy pastels. No wonder poor Sara Jane Johnson was nearly driven mad, to be surrounded by all this in-your-face whiteness. To me, as I'm sure as to many others, that the relationship between Sara Jane and her mother, the grin-and-bear-it Annie, is the core of this film. Yes, African-Americans did NOT have an easy time in a caucasian-dominated society. Inter-relations between whites and blacks was taboo, not to mention marriage. Upward mobility was not impossible, but difficult. I always felt that Lana Turner's character, Lora Meredith, didn't have too many ""problems"". I always felt that her biggest problem was deciding what Jean Louis gown to wear. However, the scenes between Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner are, to me, very heart-wrenching. They are an excellent contrast to all of Lana Turner's scenes, which always make me howl. The lady was a stunner. Her acting, if you want to call it that, left something to be desired. But she was a ""movie star"" in every sense of the word. Even her rather messed-up, scandalous  personal life added a deranged tinge of glamour to her, a sort of wayward Barbie doll. So, get out a big box of Kleenex, make some cocktails, put on your chiffon dress, and enjoy ""Imitation of Life""-accept no imitations!",978912000,16,2119,5.037037037037037
1188355,5,B000005XPV,"I must say that I have never cried as much watching a movie as I did from this one.  This is definitely a tear jerker.  Imitation of Life is an excellent movie, with real life issues.  Wanting to pass for white in the past was something that happened a lot.  It's sad but true.  Juanita Moore (Annie) was the sweetest lady ever.  (She reminds me so much of my late mother).  Annie went through trials and tribulations from her daughter wanting to be white, but she still held everything together for the group.  This movie is a definite must see for anyone who has never experienced what a true classic is like.",978480000,2,611,4.392857142857143
1188356,5,B000005XPV,"A mother(Lana Turner) aspires to an acting career and in the process neglects her emotionally-troubled teenage daughter(Sandra Dee in her first major movie role) who grows to resent her. The definitive version of Fannie Hurst's classic tear-jerker. I defy anyone to watch this film without sheding at least one tear. I'm not by nature a very emotional person who expresses my feelings, but this movie has touched me in a way that no other film has. Lana Turner is always credited as one of classic Hollywood's most beautiful and glamorous leading ladies and she most certainly is, but she was also one heck of an actress and her dramatic skills are in full reign here. Also magnificent is the lovely young Sandra Dee who, like Turner, shows here that she is not only a pretty face, but a strong screen presence as well. I thought Juanita Moore as Turner's friend was also very effective. The film raises many sensitive racial issues that were not commonly discussed in Hollywood films of the 1950's making this motion picture way ahead of its time. Look quick for Troy 'A Summer Place' Donahue in a small role.",972864000,8,1110,4.756476683937824
1188357,1,B000005XPV,This is the absolute worst movie you could ever possibly imagine.  The amount of cheesy over-the-top melodrama in this film is so ridiculous I couldn't help laughing out loud.  Does the main actor have to grab her shoulders every time he has to say something!  Why do I have to watch the intimate scenes through so many light filters it looks like it's been shot through a shower door!  Please don't waste 2 hours of your life watching this joke of a movie.,971740800,6,457,4.469879518072289
1188358,5,B000005XPV,"I saw the original 1930s version of this movie, and I was not very  pleased. It was a bit different than the glamorous 1950s version (with Lana  Turner).
The best part of the 1950s version is during Annie's funeral  when Sarah Jane cried over the casket.",969235200,,254,4.478260869565218
1188359,5,B000005XPV,"This is the story of two single mothers, one white, one black, and how their lives are forever altered once they meet on a beach in 1947. They strike up a friendship, and soon, they are sharing each other's joys and pains. Lana Turner is the struggling actress that turns her back on love and neglects her daughter (Sandra Dee) for a career...Eventually she becomes successful, but there is a price to be paid for it. Juanita Moore is fantastic as the long-suffering domestic  that tries to instill black pride in her angry, light-skinned daughter (Susan Kohner), who despises her race and wants to distance herself from her mother by passing for white. The ending is extremely emotional and be prepared to cry - it's a knockout. It's a movie about race, love, prejudice,  insecurities, family...this movie has it all. Pick this one up!",966902400,3,836,4.798611111111111
1188360,5,B000005XPV,"Since I first saw this movie when I was 13 years old, I fell in love with it. It's the only movie that can make me cry, and it makes me cry every time I see it.",949017600,3,160,3.3513513513513513
1188361,5,B000005XPV,"Hurst's best-selling novel was published in 1933 and Douglas Sirk took a modernized approach in the filming of his 1959 remake of the 1934 Claudette Colbert weeper (which was very close to the book).Lana Turner eventually  becomes movie star Lora Hart in this version and her daughter is played by  Sandra Dee. Memorable seens include Sara Jane (Susan Kohner) getting  smacked by her blond boyfriend (Troy Donahue) when he finds out about her  and magnificent finale whereupon Sara Jane finally realizes what is  important in life as she gets hysterical at her mother's funeral service  (complete with Mahalia Jackson singing ""The Troubles of the  World"" A real tearjerker!",944524800,21,673,5.175925925925926

1188394,5,B000005XPV,I actually saw both versions of this movie and I must say I like the Lana Turner version better Juanita Moore was awesome as well this movie is a tearjerker it will make you cry it would also make you look at life in a different perspective as far as it go about black and white relationships and friendships that daughter was very ungrateful and it took for her mother to die and pass away before she finally got it that all her mother wanted to do was love her but she couldn't accept the fact that her mother was a black woman she wanted to be white so bad that she hurt her mother in the worst way I gave this movie five stars and I would definitely recommend.,1514246400,,664,4.115384615384615

1188546,4,B000005XPV,"I enjoyed this portrayal more  than the  original adaptation. Although I enjoyed both and have viewed  them many times. The one has become  my favorite. I am older now and view the films with a new point of view.  The 1959 perspective allowed me to see a more in-depth aspect of the characters that I missed in the early film.  Although the role of Annie is less integral to Laura's success in business (the concept changed from pancake batter business they started together) to a  more servant role as her maid, the Annie character is presented  less subserviently heee. The interaction between the daughters and mothers is complicated by the limitations of the times as it relates to being a woman and the differences in racial experience. The movie exposes the complicated relationship between mothers raising  girls into women and how each daughter finds the other's mother a better parent for different reasons.  I would love to have an in depth discussion about this book and each film adaptation and how the experience of these characters were affected  by the construct  of  the time period and gender and racial bias. It was a story of courage, unconditional love,  unrequited love, consequences , and of course identity.  How these characters defined self-esteem and how that affected their decisions is a lesson learned. I was moved emotional and intellectually .

But each character also exposes problems that are as fresh today as they were when the script was written! It deals with dying to oneself vs risking everything for a dream. It touches upon the consequences of fame and success. It makes us question in the end which character is most successful the one who lived simply and sacrificed much or one who obtains prestige and glory!

1188622,5,B000005XPV,"I have much enjoyed IMITATION OF LIFE, the '59 Lana Turner version by Douglas Sirk. From the elegant title sequence (could've been for an early Bond or an Audrey Hepburn vehicle) to the glorious funeral procession at the end - which was remarkably grand given that Annie was 'just a maid'. Artistic license, and it suits the splendor of the movie. Based on the eponymous novel by Fannie Hurst, it weaves several narratives together. The racial drama is very poignant and includes threads like the sexualization of the 'exotic' daughter Sarah Jane as a matter of course and the 'natural' self-effacement of her mother Annie, who never, ever wants or demands anything for herself. This self-effacement keeps her and her daughter relatively safe in a racist world, but Sarah Jane is acutely aware of the humiliation and restrictions, and is determined from an early age to escape the horror of Annie's fate. In trying to do so by seeking to pass as white, she can't but deny her mother, which is the tragedy at the heart of the movie.

There's also the story of the 'overriding' ambition of the genteel white woman and the conflicts that ensue with powerful men, love interests and her daughter. Sirk keeps a good and pleasant pace and the acting is altogether solid, even if sometimes a bit big. Lana Turner, whom I only knew from photos, is a revelation and I look forward to seeing more of her work. Here, she displays a slick balance between typical mid-century femininity and a defiant, sturdy quality, that makes her very different from the fragile poo-poo pee doo persona onscreen of Monroe (a comparison evoked by their similar platinum blond hairdos). I was intrigued by Sirk's use of music. It features in many scenes as a background and adds to the 'glamour' of the movie. So do the sophisticated costumes and the art direction overall. I don't think the gloss and the rarefied circles of highly successful and rich theater people undermine the story or make it less real. On the contrary, they help explain the urgency of Sarah Jane's longing. She grew up in between these worlds but got far more of a taste of the 'good life' than her mother - since she, as a child, was not bound by formality and scripts the way 'the maid' was.

This movie is about the parallels between Lana Turner's character with her daughter and Juanita Moore's with hers.  The racial divide is there, but played slowly, until the brutal scene with Sarah Jane and the boy she likes.  The racial divide becomes apparent.  This movie was a stunner to have been made during the 1950's, yet it still mimics what is going on in the world today.  Everyone is to be commended for their performance, living or dead, and a classic is born, to be viewed by those who have not graced it prescence.

1188649,3,B000005XPV,"Directed by Douglas Sirk, IMITATION OF LIFE is another adaptation of the Fannie Hurst novel that was previously made into a 1934 film starring Claudette Colbert. This time, although the names have changed, the story is largely left intact and Lana Turner leads the cast as Lora Meredith, a struggling actress who makes eventually makes it big on the stage and screen. For the most part, the film is watchable. I was less enamored of the melodramatic hijinks this time, having just watched the 1934 original, but also because Douglas Sirk (famous for his Hollywood melodramas) cranks up the hysterics to 11 in this version. In terms of the quality of the film overall, some elements were improved upon while others weren't as good. On the positive side, I thought this film was better directed and had slightly more luxurious production values, aided greatly by this version being in widescreen color. Even though I didn't like how Juanita Moore's character was written anymore than I liked Louise Beaver's (in the previous version), I did like that they didn't play up the ""mammy"" stereotype so much. Regarding the plot, I thought that the different threads were handled a little more deftly in terms of attention paid to them, and transitioning between them. Still, this film tries to do even more narratively than the last and it doesn't quite work out in the end. They still go for the racial themes, but the gender aspect is downplayed a bit in favor of Lora (Lana Turner) being an absent mother (due to being a busy actress). This works thematically but is handled in a rather ham-handed way when they juxtapose Lora with Annie (Juanita Moore). It just seemed really obvious and a little trite. Continuing in a more negative vein, the supporting cast this go-round wasn't nearly as talented. In particular, all four actresses playing the children at different ages gave pretty bad performances, in my opinion. Especially with the child actors, the line delivery was irritating and fake-sounding. Overall, IMITATION OF LIFE delivers the kind of melodrama that you'd expect but this updated version pales slightly in comparison to the 1934 original.",1427760000,,2152,4.980555555555555

1188655,5,B000005XPV,"a very painful and unpleasant look at the issue of race; specifically, ethnic people who can pass for white.

This was VERY cleverly (and liberally) padded by a superb cast headed by Lana Turner who is a vision of staggering, breathtaking beauty.
The gown and jewels are the REAL thing and you can tell, there's no guessing. In between playing a kind hearted guardian angel to the young African Am. woman and her mother, the padding is exquisitely and elegantly quilted in and around a pot boiler romance and all that kind of good stuff.
A stroke of genius in terms of sugar coating life's unpleasantries.

Like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" it addresses, among other things, racial inequality, this time in the late forties through most of the 50's.  Juanita Moore gives the performance of a lifetime as Annie, the gentle, quiet mother whose daughter meets the daughter of Lana Turner (who gives a great performance, too) and they end up staying with them.  The stay is supposed to be overnight, but ends up much longer than that as Annie quietly begins to take all the running of the apartment and household off Turner's hands and becomes indispensable to both mother and daughter.  In no time at all you wish that you had a friend like her.  Not to work, but just to listen to you and be your friend.

Imitation of Life is a 1959 film based on Fannie Hurst's novel of the same name, directed by Douglas Sirk and starring Lana Turner, Sandra Dee, Susan Kohner and Juanita Moore.
 It relates a double story of two single mothers (one widowed and the other divorced) and their daughters (Lora and Susie Meredith and Annie and Sarah Jane Johnson.) Lora is a stage actress who offers Annie a position as a housekeeper since Annie is homeless and going from door to door for a job. They soon become close friends. Rebellious strong willed teenage daughter Sarah Jane is ashamed of being half-black (despite the fact that the white women in the house treat her as an equal) She is sullen, bratty, insecure and tries to fit in with the white folks to feel accepted. She often berates her mother for telling people that they're related and doesn't want to be around her. Towards the climax of the film, she runs away and becomes a dancer at sleazy night clubs. Longsuffering mother Annie gently admonishes her and tries to restore her to the straight and narrow road but when Sarah makes it clear she wants nothing more to do with Annie, Annie says she may go her way but that she will always be ""My beautiful little baby"" and if anything goes wrong she can always come back because her arms will always be open to her. Eventually, Annie becomes sick and dies. At the funeral, Sarah tears through the crowd screaming ""LET ME THROGUH PLEASE! THAT'S MY MOTHER! THAT'S MY MOTHER!"" In one of the most tear-jerking scenes ever filmed (and I don't usually cry on movies) she hugs the coffin and says ""I'm such a dirty, sorry shame! It's all my fault! Please forgive me! Can you hear me up there? Can you? I beg you to forgive me!"" Then she goes back home with Lora and Susie.

One thing I love about this film is how it develops the four main characters. Both mothers and daughters have their strengths and weaknesses and feel like fully three dimensional people. At the end they all learn something. Lora Meredith learns to give up her love for acting to become a stay at home mom and spend more time with her daughter, Suzie. Suzie learns to respect and be grateful to her mother and give up her silly girlish fantasy love for Steve, Lora's fianc. Sarah Jane Johnson learns in the grand scheme of life, it's not about the color of your skin; what matters is the character you show--how you treat the people around you. And Annie learns there comes a time in your child's life where he/she's going to make his/her own decisions and there's nothing you can do about it. If your child is headstrong and stubborn you have to let them go and learn on their own even if means a couple hard knocks to make them see the light.

Douglas Sirk's (director) style is as some have said an acquired taste. The dialogue is occasionally a little corny ""I'm going up, up and up and no one's going to push me down."" ""You're bones are so perfect. My camera could easily have a love affair with you."" and Lora Meredith's episodical acting career with all the men interested in her in the first half of the film is rather soap operatic and cringe inducing but all in all it's an absorbing film with some really great messages and did an outstanding job making me care for the characters, especially Christ-like Annie Johnson. And I don't think Lora was as shallow and air headed as some critics on the IMDB have said. After all, she did offer her home to Annie and Sarah Jane when they were homeless. Even though it was just a small three room apartment, she gave out of her poverty. And when Sarah Jane runs away and Annie is crying she strokes her shoulder and says ""Aw, don't worry Annie. We'll bring her back.""

The cast is uniformly excellent except perhaps the sugary, simpering characterization of Sandra Dee as the older Suzie--her syrupy tone of voice when she says ""Oh look a falling star! Oh Mama, look! It's Annie and Steve!"" is a little irritating. Lana Turner (who looks a little bit like Eleanor Parker) is lovely as the stage actress Miss Lora and does a very good job showing her strengths and weaknesses. My favorite of her scenes are when she scolds Sarah Jane for the crawdads trick and when she's watching over Annie's deathbed. John Gavin (Steve) is solid in a role that doesn't require him to do much more than stand around looking like a pretty boy clothing magazine model. The two child actors (Suzie and Sarah Jane) at the beginning are very good especially Karen Dicker as Sarah in the schoolroom and snowstorm scene.

But this movie unquestionably belongs to Susan Kohner and Juanita Moore as the adult Sarah and Annie who do so much more with one facial expression than I've seen many actresses do with a whole script. They were both nominated for Best Supporting Actress and it's obvious that the Academy split the vote between them because they couldn't decide who was better. The union boss/priest/older brother trio of nominees in On the Waterfront is another perfect example where the judges couldn't decide who to give the trophy to because they all were so darn good. I have nothing against Shelley Winters as the grouchy, cantankerous Mrs. Van Daan in Anne Frank but for my money, Kohner and Moore were the true winners. It's a comparison of Good: Winters versus Spectacular: Kohner and Moore. If I had to split the vote between them, I'd give it to the non-nominated Haya Harareet in Ben-Hur who like Moore gave an equally beautiful portrayal of a strong devoted woman.

I was touched beyond words at Juanita Moore's acting and often wept at her performance. She gives a beautiful, subtle, fully-nuisanced performance as the strong, devout, stoic housekeeper. Her low, rich, creamy voice is always a pleasure to the ears--especially when she's telling the children the story of Mary, Joseph and Jesus. The scene where she goes up to her daughter's hotel room towards the climax and tells her that she'll always be there for her when she's in need never fails to move me. She plays motherly love, care, worry, sorrow, dismay and joy in a manner that is very real. Susan Kohner is likewise is believable at every turn as the bratty, rebellious, prodigal turned penitent especially in the hotel farewell scene and funeral. I challenge anyone not to hold a handkerchief during these two scenes.

The costumes (especially Lana Turner's dresses) sets and cinematography are absolutely gorgeous and should have received Oscar nominations.

Must be some signal, but was new, and I don't know what to do here.  Anything I order lately has these lines in it, even ""remastered"" movies, and it must be some ""do not record"" signal the disc is reading when iti plays.  I don't know what else to call it.

And I'm kind.

Lana Turner was NEVER an actress.  She was a wickedly self-indulgent woman who happened by fame and let all those closest to her fall away and rot and/or sweat.  That's Lana Turner.

Laughably, she plays a Broadway star. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Lana Turner on the stage?  You've got to be kidding.

Oh, but there's tons of fashion.

Of course, there is the black/white angle, the tortured black mother (I forget her name, but she gives a better performance than Lana) and the troubled daughter's and oh poor well dressed Lana just dosen't know what to do.  The child.  The children.  The maid.  The friend.  And it all boils down to: the man.  It's an horrifically dated piece of screen acting; more akin to the silent screen.

Typically Lana.

At the end, we get the resplendent Mahalia Jackson singing at a funeral while Lana cries copious tears and really, Lana......",1368144000,2,930,4.5

1188876,4,B000005XPV,"Imitation of Life, a remake of the 1934 film by the same name, dazzled me. The acting was very convincing; when they say you'll need a few tissues to get through the ending, they mean it! Everyone gives it their all in this film and it shows. The choreography and cinematography shine; the musical score enhances the film as well. Moreover, the plot moves along nicely; I didn't feel like I was watching a two hour movie! My only disappointment is that the quality of the print wasn't that great; this film deserves a proper restoration!

When the film starts, we meet widow and aspiring actress Lora Meredith (Lana Turner) with her daughter Susie (young Susie played by Terry Burnham) at Coney Island; Lora thinks Susie is lost and in possible danger until Lora sees that Susie was safe with a very sweet homeless African-American woman, Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore) and Annie's daughter Sara Jane (young Sara Jane played by Karin Dicker). Lora is grateful to Annie and she even invites Annie and Sara Jane to spend the night in her run-down apartment so they won't be on the street that night. However, Lora and Annie soon make good friends; and Lora agrees to let Annie and Sara Jane stay with her and Susie so Annie can essentially be Lora's maid and assistant and Sara Jane can go home every night after school instead of the street.  Lora trusts Annie to look after Susie and Sara Jane while she desperately searches for jobs as an actress.

But there's more! Enter Steve Archer (John Gavin) who spots Lora on the beach when she was searching for Susie; he is a photographer and takes pictures of Lora, the girls and other people on the beach. Steve falls fast for Lora but Lora isn't sure if she wants to marry Steve; it all happens too fast for Lora. Steve is disappointed but hangs around at least for a while; and Lora tries to scratch her way to the top in the acting world despite a rough start with agent Allen Loomis (Robert Alda) and play write David Edwards (Dan O'Herlihy).

The years fly; we see Lora climbing to the top of her profession as an actress--but there are problems. We see how Lora, the white woman, can climb the ladder while Annie, the black woman, remains the maid. Sixteen year old Susie (Sandra Dee), however, is not too happy about her mother's stardom; she bitterly resents the fact that her mother just doesn't have time for her. At the same time, Annie's now 18 year old daughter Sara Jane (Susan Kohner) wants to be white and since her missing father was ""nearly white"" Sara Jane spends her life trying to ""pass"" for white. Indeed, Sara Jane is so driven to be white that she scorns and rejects her mother Annie which causes trouble in the household, too.

Of course, there's much more to the plot and I've already left out some of the story so you can be captivated and moved by the film just as I was! Suffice it to say that there are many important life lessons concerning a sharp and sorrowful racial divide and the importance of happiness that everyone must learn. The rest of the film shows how all the issues play out.

The only bonus on the DVD is the theatrical trailer; I would have liked more.

Imitation of Life features outstanding acting and a poignant story of its own that does not replicate the plot of the first version of the film. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; people who enjoy dramas with social and cultural themes will not be disappointed.",1362355200,2,3432,4.525806451612903

1188915,4,B000005XPV,"This remake is quite different from the 1934 original in several ways. Bea's character is now named Lora (Lana Turner) and is an aspiring actress in New York City. She meets Delilah's character, now named Annie (Juanita Moore), at the beach on Coney Island. Annie and her daughter Sarah Jane have recently become homeless and Lora agrees to take them in just for the night. Lora is a single mother supporting her daughter Susie and she can't afford to support Annie and Sarah Jane too. Annie gets a job washing shirts and she and her daughter end up staying. Eventually, Lora becomes a successful Broadway actress and is very wealthy. Annie's role in Lora's success is that she takes care of Susie while Lora is working. Lora works a lot so Annie is more of a mother to Susie than Lora is in most ways.

Lora's romance with Steve Archer (John Gavin) is fraught with conflict in this movie. He can only be with her if she prioritizes him over her work and apparently that means not working at all. He's a good guy though; it's clear that this expectation is not unreasonable. It's Lora who is being unreasonable wanting to work when there is a perfectly good man wanting to take care of her. I wasn't expecting to find such a sexist subplot - the 1930s version portrayed women in a way better and stronger light!

Sarah Jane's struggle with being a light-skinned black person has a bigger part in this movie than Peola's struggle in the original. I was disappointed that they did not cast a black person to play Sarah Jane. Susan Kohner did do a fabulous job playing Sarah Jane though and was nominated for both an Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for the role. Sarah Jane is even more of a ""tragic mulatto"" in this movie and has quite a few dramatic scenes in which she talks about why she wants to be white.

This movie address the issues of race in a more direct way than the original which I'm sure is a product of the time in which it was made. When Lora suggests that Annie talk to Sarah Jane about not trying to pass as white, Annie says, ""How do you explain to your child that she was born to be hurt?"" Like Delilah in the original movie, Annie wants a big funeral when she dies. She tells Lora to please invite all of Annie's friends. Lora looks surprised and tells Annie that she didn't know Annie had any friends besides her - very telling of the one-sided nature of their relationship.

Another difference between the two movies that I must note is the heightened drama in the remake. Lana Turner chews the scenery every chance she gets and the score is very heavy handed. The melodramatic background music makes sure that the viewer is not confused when something VERY DRAMATIC is happening.

This movie has all kinds of interesting movie star connections. Alan Alda's dad, Robert Alda, plays an agent. Troy Donahue, who was just starting out, has a small part as a real jerk - he was not dreamy at all in this movie. And Susan Kohler's son is Chris Weitz, the director of The Twilight Saga: New Moon.

It was interesting to watch the two versions of Imitation of Life back to back and see how much (and how little) relationships between black people and white people changed over the twenty-five years between the two movies.",1342137600,9,3264,4.514382402707276
1188916,5,B000005XPV,"This movie is about a woman that hates being who she is because her mother is of a different race and she passes for another.

1188926,5,B000005XPV,"The bond between two single mothers, one black and one white, and their daughters is the subject of this wonderful movie.  Lora Meredith (Lana Turner), a struggling actress, meets homeless and unemployed domestic Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore); moved by Annie's plight and in need of help, Lora takes Annie and her daughter Sarah Jane into her home.  As the years pass, Lora becomes the toast of Broadway while steadfast Annie suffers horribly because Sarah Jane is embarrassed by her mother's dark skin and wants to pass for white.

This 1959 film is full of fine performances and good writing that overcome the occasional clich&eacute;s and soap-opera feel.  Turner does put the 'melo' in this drama with her silly histrionics, but that's how her shallow and conceited character would act.  Sandra Dee is good and perky as always as her teenage daughter, but the film belongs to Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner, who plays Sarah Jane.  Their story line is the more interesting one, fraught with heartache and regrets.  Moore is a wonderful actress and quite often moved me to tears with her quiet, unconditional love in spite of her daughter's rejection.  Sarah Jane should have been played by a black actress, but Kohner is excellent.

This is a movie that can be enjoyed over and over.  The wardrobe is lovely, the sets colorful, and the dialogue is realistic.  Recommended.",1318118400,3,1375,4.960698689956332

1188932,5,B000005XPV,"Lana get to flaunt the fact that she is not just another pretty face but really an amazing actress in this movie. Her ability is played out in the role of an aging actress and mother-trying to balance her boyfriend and daughter with her desire for an illustrious career. The side line is actress Susan Kohner playing the reckless daughter who only wants to be rid of her origin-the fact that she is half black-half white. She breaks her mom's heart a little but still loves her. We feel for Susan's torn character, her mom's patient but heartbreaking rendition, Lora Meredith's fight for the best of both worlds, Sandra Dee's desire for her mother's time and affection, and John Gavin's wait for the love of his life, Lora Meredith (lana).
It is the story of how simple family matters can tear people apart; it is the anatomy of important issues of our world today (or yesterday): racial prejudice, women working, young love, and the hearts of the faithful.
BTW:Mahalia sings like no other at the end of this film, so anticipate hearing some mindblowing singing!

1188941,5,B000005XPV,"This film is completely different in many ways from all the others because it reaches an extremely high level of density, a tremendous depth of compassion and empathy. The film is centered on four women, two mothers and two daughters. One mother is white and an actress with a great career. The other woman is black and a servant to the actress all her life. The drama is double for the four women. The daughter of the white actress falls in love with the man who waited for her mother to be ready to love him and finally gets the prize he had been expecting for so long when the daughter finally lets the world know, discreetly, that she is in love with the man her mother is going to marry. The second drama is that the white daughter of the black mother is ashamed of being black and wants to escape that fate, that ordeal, that curse. She breaks the heart of her mother of course but her mother lets her go and do what she wants, be a chorus line girl in Hollywood. The film is extremely sentimental and effective. It is heart raking, heart breaking and even more than that. Yet the film is cruelly to the point in the present period when the racial question is coming back to the foreground. Can anyone escape one's racial descent? Of course not? Can anyone reject another human being or even judge another human being only because that other human being is black? Of course not. But can anyone aim at being what they are not and behave as white if they are black, and vice versa? Of course not. The question, the very problematic should not even exist in our minds. The closing scenes of the film after the death of the black mother cannot be told in any way. You have to see them. One thing is sure Sirk knows how to stir, move and exacerbate his audience's feelings and the lesson is received one hundred percent. The last ten minutes of that film are just a beauty of cinematographic art.

Once again, Lana Turner gives an outstanding performance along with a great cast to tell the story of friendship between two women of different backgrounds and races, yet the respect and love that they have for one another helps to carry each one through a tumultuous time in their lives.

The movie also covers an issue that black people dealt with back than, and that was the lighter blacks passing as whites.  The thinking behind that mentality was that they could get ahead and be more accepted in society.  This is a movie NOT to be missed.

1188959,5,B000005XPV,"One of the great Hollywood melodramas, IMITATION OF LIFE, the second movie adaptation of the book by Fannie Hurst; is directed with style and emotion by Douglas Sirk.

A chance meeting throws together Lora Meredith (Lana Turner) and Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore), two struggling widows who both have troubled relationships with their daughters. Lora is a Broadway starlet intent on hitting the big time, which will come at the cost of her daughter Susie (Sandra Dee), while Annie's daughter Sarah Jane (Susan Kohner) is a black girl with a pale complexion, who chooses to pass as white in order to avoid the hatred of a prejudiced world.  As years of denial and unawareness pass, the two girls slowly revolt from their mothers, and the story moves to its emotional and tearful conclusion.

Still compelling over 50 years later, IMITATION OF LIFE still has a message for modern audiences, and preserves the tour-de-force performances of Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner. Both were Oscar-nominated for their work here. The performances of Sandra Dee and Lana Turner (and Troy Donahue as Sarah Jane's violent boyfriend) are just as impressive.

The supporting cast includes John Gavin, Dan O'Herlihy, Robert Alda and Mahalia Jackson in a small cameo singing ""Troubles of the World"".",1242259200,5,1277,5.125

1188962,4,B000005XPV,"`Imitation of Life' is quite moving at times despite being `politically incorrect' as some will surely label it.  It has held up over the years and remains poignant even in our modern world  where race relations are no where near as tense or as controversial as they were in the 50's.  With some stellar performances and intricate character detail, `Imitation of Life' is truly an enjoyable film.

The film opens with a beautiful blonde named Lora frantically searching for her daughter on a crowded beach.  Her daughter, Susie, has found a playmate in young Sarah Jane.  As Lora finds her daughter sharing a snack with Sarah Jane and a strange black woman she is come over with relief.  A few candid photos and a subtle, yet desperate, plea later and Lora opens her home to this black woman, Annie, and her daughter Sarah Jane.  What unfolds next is a friendship and a bond that forms between these two women and their two daughters as the years trickle by and their life is filled to the brim with drama and tension.

You see, while Annie may be black, her daughter Sarah Jane is as white as can be (looks like her father, or so we are told) and so Sarah becomes determined to live as a white girl, even if it means destroying her family.

The film tells two stories, one focusing on Lora's acting career and her on-again-off-again romance with photographer Steve Archer; the other focusing on Annie's struggle to get a handle on her daughter.  Lora also has some daughter issues, as Susie grows up and falls in love with Steve while her mother is away shooting a film.  It seems that Lora's career is destroying her relationship with her daughter, as Susie begins to confide in Annie.  Sarah Jane, determined to rid herself of any ties to her black mother, has run away from home and continues to pose as a white girl, hoping and praying for a better life.

But the life she gets is not the one she hoped for.

The performances for the most part are all stunning.  Lana Turner is beying stunning, and she carries her scenes well enough.  The thing is, she is no match for Juanita Moore, who just devours her every line with such authentic realism.  It's a shame that the whole `big white star' syndrome was in effect at the time, since in my opinion Moore is much more a lead than Turner, whose story arc is far less precedent or even poignant than that of Moore's.  As far as the daughters are concerned, Sandra Dee and Susan Kohner both deliver very good performances.  Dee is a little more even than Kohner, but she's less effective.  Kohner is very, very good in some scenes (especially the `don't recognize me' scene) but she is uneven in some of her earlier scenes (and that dance scene is painful to watch).  Dee is much more consistent, but she doesn't have any powerful scenes to make her truly spark.  The male stars take a major backseat in everyway to the female ones, but John Gavin, Robert Alda and Dan O'Herlihy all deliver nicely.

The film may not be as important as it once could have been considered, but it doesn't feel as out of date today as some might think.  This is definitely a film to see, especially for Moore's amazing performance.  Touching and sincere, this is a film that will break your heart; so consider yourself warned.",1240876800,,3258,4.535958904109589

1188971,5,B000005XPV,"Usually, a Hollywood remake of any reasonably good motion picture usually falls flat.  There are only two exceptions -- Judy Garland's A Star is Born and Universal Pictures remake of the Fannie Hurst classic Imitation of Life, a tale of a beautifully bonded friendship between an African-American woman and a Caucasian widow raising their daughters.

Lana Turner, as Lora Meredith, becomes a Broadway success.  Along the way, the demands of the theater wind up taking a toll on her relationship with her teenage daughter Suzy, portrayed by Sandra Dee in one of the few good drama roles of her career.

Annie Johnson, very ably portrayed by Juanita Moore, is an African-American woman who is abandoned by her husband before the birth of their daughter, Sarah Jane -- a daughter whose negro characteristics are not easily distinguished, is played by Susan Kohner.

Lora's issues with Suzy pale in light of the angst Annie has to deal with concerning Sarah Jane.  Annie sadly conveys to Lora that Sarah Jane ""was born to be hurt.""  Annie keeps telling Sarah Jane to stop pretending she is white.  Still, Sarah Jane decides to cross the ""color barrier"" and be white.  She looses a job in a sleazy nightclub and gets beat-up by her white boyfriend when it's discovered that she is a very light skinned negro.",1214179200,8,1303,4.85972850678733

1188975,5,B000005XPV,"************* SPOILER ALERT! DON'T READ BEFORE SEEING THIS FILM! *********
Actually, I envy anyone who hasn't seen this one yet - they get to see it for the 1st time & it is amazing. Guaranteed to make anyone cry like a baby. Its really an unusual film in that its ostensibly a star vehicle for Lana Turner as Lora - & it is. But the centerpiece of the whole movie is the relationship between Annie(Juanita Moore) & Sarah Jane(Susan Kohner). Lora rises to stardom & makes maybe a hundred costume changes along the way. Her acting gets criticized a lot, but she's perfect for this part - a glamorous, self-absorbed but well-intentioned drama queen totally focused on her career & oblivious to all those around her. There's a brief but telling scene when she blurts out that she never realized that Annie had any friends (or by extension a life outside of being her maid). The 2 women lock eyes for an instant but another character interrupts & the moment is lost forever.

Like I said, this film is really about Annie & Sarah Jane & their scenes together (with both versions of Sarah Jane) are literally unbearably painful to watch. Sarah Jane is furious at the cruelty of segregation & prejudice & takes out her resentment at white people on poor Annie. She also has an escape hatch which she discovers early & uses at every opportunity - she can pass as white. But Annie can't & her actual presence repudiates Sarah Jane's lie & her daughter despises her for that fact. So by definition she must also despise herself.

Both women richly deserved their Oscar nominations, & as noted their scenes together are incredibly hurtful to watch. The last 2 scenes are particularly brutal. The 1st one is when Annie catches her daughter dancing at a strip club. Annie begs her to come home & talk to her but Sarah Jane turns her back on her & walks away with no intention of ever seeing her mother again. The 2nd one is the goodbye scene when Annie senses she's going to die soon & goes to LA to see Sarah Jane for one last time & is the ultimate tear-jerker. In the motel room when Sarah Jane refuses to let her mother sit down because she only wants to get rid of her as quickly as possible - & we can see how ill & distraught Annie is - this moment will rip the heart right out of your chest no matter how tough you think you are. The rest of this scene, although brief, is no less painful & will make anyone cry no matter how many times you see it.

It then becomes apparent that Annie's illness is actually her heart having been broken by her daughter's behavior as well as her constant & merciless abuse. So she dies & she's only in her late 30's or so at the most. But she always wanted a special funeral & had saved up for it over the years. And she gets it - Mahalia Jackson giving her all & an elaborate funeral cortege. We also get a glimpse of Annie's life away from Lora's house. Many people are there & they obviously think very highly of Annie. When Sarah Jane shows up & begs forgiveness much too late - this is one of the all-time great movie endings. In fact, the last 30 minutes or so of this film are extremely difficult to take & I know people who have seen this movie once & refuse to watch it again because its so painful. May be the ultimate chick flick - I can't recommend it highly enough in spite of being a man.

The transfer itself is awful. Its apparent that a lot of care went into the colors, set designs, clothes & cinematography but everything just looks washed out. Hopefully this classic will get the restoration it deseves some day.",1202947200,6,3560,4.356927710843373

1188981,5,B000005XPV,"I am in my 50's, and although I first saw this movie while still a teenager, it has remained my favorite movie of all time.  A story of two strong women, one white, one black, who become accidental friends out of compassion and necessity during a racially predjudicial time.  While Lana Turner (Lora) and Sandra Dee (Susie) are the ""stars"" of the movie, in reality it is Juanita Moore (Annie) and Susan Kohner (Sarah Jane)who were rightfully nominated for Academy Awards and have kept me fascinated with the movie for the last 40 years.  These two loving mothers, Lora, a struggling starlet and Annie, an honest homemaker, meet when their young daughters, Susie and Sarah Jane, bond while playing together on the beach. The kind-hearted Lora takes the homeless Annie and Sarah Jane home with her and Susie ""for the night"", but Annie proves invaluable to Lora so that she and her daughter can remain indefinitely, and the four quickly fall into a comfortable dynamic. Lora chases her dreams and supplies a roof over their heads, while Annie does the ""heavy lifting"" by running the household with virtually no money and being primary caregiver to both girls.  As the years pass, these four become a loving, if somewhat unconventional family as Lora reaches her goals of fame and fortune, allbeit sometimes at the expense of her relationship with Susie, and Annie continues to ""work for her keep"" long after the necessity is gone.  As Susie grows to young adulthood with money and privilege, Sarah Jane, unwilling to endure the unfairness of racial predjudice, constantly breaks her mother's heart as she ""passes"" as white and even cuts all ties with her obviously ""not white"" mother.  In my opinion, this is the reason this movie is so compelling and remains timeless.  And, if you do not shed tears at the end of this movie, you're just not human.  This is definitely a classic, and I can't believe anyone would be sorry they purchased it.  In fact, I think I'll go watch it again.",1196985600,4,1980,4.782991202346041

1188983,5,B000005XPV,"""Imitation of Life"" opens with a sweepingly romantic title song sung by Earl Grant which puts the viewer in the perfect mood for the glitzy drama that is about to unfold. Aspiring actress Lora Meredith (Lana Turner) meets Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore) a homeless black woman at Coney Island and soon they share a tiny apartment. Each woman has an intolerable daughter, though Annie's little girl Sarah Jane (Susan Kohner), is by far the worse.  Sarah Jane doesn't like being black; since she's light-skinned (her father was practically white), she spends the rest of the film passing as white, much to her mother's heartache and shame. Lora, meanwhile, virtually ignores her own daughter (Sandra Dee) in a single-minded quest for stardom. Legendary movie director Douglas Sirk's (""Written On The Wind"" (1956), ""All That Heaven Allows"" (1955) last American film.

One of Hollywood's most memorable 4-hankie romantic drama masterpieces stars ultra glamorous Lana Turner in one of the major roles of her career that's she's best remembered for. The other being her prim and proper role as the screen's most notorious single mother in Grace Metalious' controversial ""Peyton Place"" (1957). ""Imitation of Life"" brings so much to the screen in it's story of two single mothers, one white and one black, who see the world in different respects to raising their daughters.  Sandra Dee is her usual sweet and temperamental self as Lana's love starved daughter, and Susan Kohner (a Natalie Wood look-a-like) does a fantastic job as Juanita's light skinned daughter, who wishes Lana were her mother! Hollywood leading men John Gavin and Troy Donahue add some love interests to Lana and Sandra's lives and Gospel great Mahalia Jackson sings at a funeral in the film's grand finale!

I highly recommend ""Imitation of Life"" to classic romantic drama DVD collectors, especially fans of Lana Turner and Sandra Dee. And I also recommend Lana Turner's  ""Peyton Place,"" ""Madame X,"" ""By Love Possessed,"" and ""Portrait in Black,"" with only ""Peyton Place"" currently available on DVD.  Also check out Sandra Dee, with Troy Donahue in ""A Summer Place,"" which is also available on DVD!

Until it was time to go home and the mother told the other mother that they had no home to go to, but they'll be fine. As generious as the other girls mother is, she takes them in. As time goes on the girls grew up and were very close. The byracial girl starts to reject her mother and pass for all white. More time goes by and her mother dies. she then decides to show up at the funeral and make a big mocary of herself. The other girl and her mother reminds her that it is much too late. This is truely an eye watering film and a heart breaker. The main idea of this movie is to be good to your mother and don't try to act like your something your not.",1192492800,,1284,4.059055118110236

1188989,2,B000005XPV,"...bears a striking resemblance to Natalie Wood. Susan is stunning in this and she is the only reason it is even worth watching, and she is not laugable as trying to ""pass for black"", as Jeanne Crain was in ""Pinky"" (which is actually a better movie).

A common theme in these ""passing"" movies made back then (including the original 1934 version) was that passing for white was wrong. How Peola (in the original version) and Sarah Jane (in this version) treated their mother was wrong, but if someone wants to pass for white so they will be treated equally (which they shouldn't have to do), I don't have a problem with that.

Now when it comes to romantic relationships, it's very important to some people to preserve their white heritage, and I don't have a problem with that, just as I don't have a problem with black people wanting to preserve their black heritage, but for those to whom it's not an issue, I don't pass judgement on them. Interracial relationships are not a moral issue, but rather a social and cultural issue, and then what about the children?

That being said, I think Sarah Jane was wrong not to tell her secret boyfriend about her heritage (especially since it was implied they slept together), though I understand why she didn't.

Anyway, John Gavin's character (Steve Archer) as the long-suffering admirer of Lana Turner (Lora Meredith), who really ""acts"" (but she is playing a stage actress, and they are known for over-acting), could have been left out completely, and the crush Sandra Dee (Susie), who plays Lana's very annoying teenage daughter, should have definitely been left out. I always thought this story added nothing to the movie.

When Lora told Susie that she would give Steve up because her daughter was in love with him (and she was like what, fifteen?), all of a sudden, Susie was angry with her mother for never being there for her when she seemed happy before. It was so obvious she was just mad that Steve was in love with her mother, not her. I just rolled my eyes--Sandra Dee was so retarded in this movie.

I'm really not into actresses playing phony actresses, and I could never see what was so great about Lana Turner in this movie that she became such a star. Lana was never really all that pretty to begin with. Glamorous, yes, beautiful, I think not.

As another reviewer stated, the years passing sequence was pretty cheesy. I mean, I think we could have figured out on our own that several years had passed when we saw the girls all grown up.

I liked Annie, but I was annoyed that she just never ""got it"" when it came to her daughter. She kept showing up and embarrassing her, and though I understand how hurtful that can be, I think her mother should have also understood that children can be cruel, and Sarah Jane was passing in school so she could make friends.

I thought Sarah Jane was the only real character in the whole movie.

There were a couple of parts that just didn't click, like when Lora says to Annie (sorry, I can't remember the woman's name) that she didn't know she had any friends (hell, they had lived together for years!), and Annie said she had never asked.

Also, there was hardly any mention of Susie's father (which is why ""The Brady Bunch"" never made any sense to me in that respect).

Then when Lora tells Sarah Jane about the Hawkins boy (I think that was his name--and Hawkins was black), and doesn't get it why Sarah Jane gets upset over this, because it's like she doesn't even have the right to like a white boy. And then when Lora says, ""We've never treated you any differently,"" well, right there, I mean, it's like she had a reason to, but because she's oh-so-kind, she chose not to.

I still have no idea what the significance is with the big funeral. Why not enjoy all that money that was wasted on it while she was alive, not dead?

This movie talked about a touchy subject, but didn't tackle it. Blacks were still supposed to stay in ""their place"" and black girls (no matter how white they appeared) weren't supposed to like white boys, etc.

It's worth watching once, but I couldn't sit through it again.

As for the 1934 version, again, once is enough. It's like ""The Aunt Jemima Story"" and the scenes where Delilah (the black woman) rubs Bea's (Claudette Colbert's) feet feels sort of lesbian-ish.",1182211200,2,4299,4.5708712613784135
1188990,4,B000005XPV,"Imitation of Life is a politically charged movie in the style of a woman's film. Lana Turner stars as an aspiring actress who makes it big in spite of her age and the fact that she has a young daughter (Sandra Dee). In times of poverty, she meets Juanita Moore, a kindly black woman with a daughter of her own (Susan Kohner). This little girl is so light skinned, she could pass as white, and does on many occasions. She is ashamed of her mother and acts out constantly. However, she and Turner's daughter are close friends, and Moore takes care of the family nicely.

We are shown that mothers with careers are almost always doomed to fail. When one is focused on, the other is neglected. Also, race is an important factor; this film was released in the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement.

1188999,3,B000005XPV,"Fannie Hurst's prolific pen has been responsible for over a dozen novels, more than 400 short stories, and other works including a play... Although it is estimated she has been read by a half billion people, an even greater number have seen the movies made from her bestselling novels, which include 'Back Street' (made three times),

'Imitation of Life' (twice), 'Humoresque' (twice), 'Symphony of Six Million,' and 'Lummox.' 'Imitation of Life' marked an important career comeback for Lana Turner whose private life had been engulfed in tragedy one year before... It also enclosed an interesting exploration of race relations given considerable depth and style through Sirk's polished direction...

Impeccably photographed by Russell Metty (Spartacus, 1960), the major script revisions included the change of the central character from the 'Pancake Queen"" business woman of the original to the more characteristic occupation of a resplendent Broadway actress... Her black business partner was transformed into the actress' housekeeper-companion to bring her character out of the outmoded colored 'mammy' stereotype of the original...

Even the credits for 'Imitation of Life' have a different look. As the Universal logo fades, a handful of diamonds slowly fall from the top of the screen in the manner of raindrops... By the time the credits have finished, the entire screen is ready to overflow with them... From this blinding introduction, the film suddenly shifts to the beach at Coney Island where its four chief protagonists meet...

Lora Meredith, an attractive widow with theatrical aspirations, has lost her 6-year-old daughter, Susie, in the crowds... She finally locates her in the company of Annie Johnson, a kind but impoverished black woman, and her light-skinned daughter, Sarah Jane, who had been playing with Susie... Before long Annie goes to work as a housekeeper for Lora and a deep bond of affection develops between them and their children...

Encouraged by an agent (Robert Alda), Lora gets a good role in a play by David Edwards... In the years that follow, she becomes the darling of Broadway and appears in one Edwards smash after another. But success means work... and work means neglecting Susie, now sixteen, who must endure the loneliness of a youngster whose mother is too busy being a star...

A good-looking photographer, Steve Archer (John Gavin), is the determined, admiring love of Lora's life but he too must wait and suffer for her affection... Meanwhile, Annie has her problems as well...

Surrounded by luxury, her daughter, Sarah Jane, is resentful of the segregation and restrictions on her future imposed by her race... She even disclaims her mother to camouflage her ancestry and eventually takes a decision with extremely drastic effect...

'Imitation of Life' is the first of three highly lucrative Lana Turner-Ross Hunter collaborations... It is a marvelous showcase for the talents of Juanita Moore, a self-sacrificing mother so loving, honest and sincere... Susan Kohner is skillful enough to project unafraid sensuality... Both women won Academy Award nominations in the category of Best Supporting Actress...",1167609600,4,3161,5.3717171717171714

Lana Turner's outdated, 'plastic' leading lady ways show that her acting abilities are on the lowest level of anyone except the 'cute and perky' Sandra Dee. Dialogue is dreadful, from the photographer's saying he'll have a 'love affair with Lora's bones' to Lora's telling Annie, whom she had known and shared a residence with for over a decade, that she never thought she had any friends.

I suppose its appeal for me is that, much as my taste is for well acted drama, it belongs to the last days when one could admit to just wanting to be entertained. I shudder to think of how this film, with its ingrained racism (Annie never leaves the back stairs), was progressive for its time - a time I recall all too well.

The story of a struggling widow and aspiring actress trying to raise her young daughter, and the black woman she befriends and the two become close as the years pass and their daughters' problems begin to surface. Lana Turner, as Lora Meredith, is radiant and plays the mixture of glamorous star and a mother trying to be the best she can be, but only complicates matters further by her ambition and work. Juanita Moore is heart-breaking as Annie Johnson, a devoted friend and loving mother whose heart is shattered when her frustrated, hurt and rebellious daughter, Sarah Jane (portrayed by the sultry and splendid Susan Kohner) discovers that her light-colored skin makes it easy for her to pass for white. The late, always lovely and perky Sandra Dee plays Lora's daughter Susie, who is longing for her mother's love and attention. And John Gavin as Lora's on-again, off-again suitor Steve Archer gives a strong, gentle and compassionate performance.

The drama is wonderfully and sensitively presented: this was a time when the issue of racial inequality was a very real one, and many black or people of mixed race did pass for white, because they were ashamed of their background and wanted to fit in. Sarah Jane's attempts at this, which leads, among other things, to a relationship with Frankie (Troy Donahue, playing against type, in a brief but riveting scene), who beats her almost to a pulp when he discovers the truth. After that, she is constantly out searching for another way to escape her mother, her race, and herself. She feels inadequate compared to Susie, who appears to have all the advantages, and to Lora, who is successful and surrounded by the beautiful people. Her poor, ill mother is brought to despair, and finally makes the painful decision to let her daughter go. The scene in the hotel room had me weeping. Sarah Jane stares into the mirror, starting softly but repeats into a painful yell, ""I'm white. White. WHITE!"" When mother and daughter bid each other that heart-wrenching goodbye it was almost too much to bear. No wonder they were both Oscar-nominated. Turner is beautiful, and her realization that her daughter is in love with Steve, whom she is romantically involved with and is planning to marry, really throws her for a loop. When she comes to talk it out with Susie, this is when we see the anguish voiced, and we see Sandra Dee really come to life. Anyone who doubts her acting talent should see this movie. The argument starts out with her being angry and resentful, but then it culminates to her pain and sadness over her mother's neglect. (One can't help but compare the scene to Turner's troubled relationship with her own daughter, Cheryl). Susie calls her mother on ""playing the martyr"" and she confides in her mother that she wants some independence. Tears stream down her equisite, doll-like face.

The climax, with the death of Annie, the grief that follows at her funeral lead by the marvelous Mahalia Jackson, and the poignant, tear-jerking return of Sarah Jane just sums this movie up. It gets me every time. It is now available on DVD, sometimes as a set with the 1934 version. Have fun comparing, but for both, Kleenex is mandatory!

1189007,5,B000005XPV,"With a fabulous cast and well paced direction by Douglas Sirk, this melodrama succeeds on many levels, and surpasses the 1934 version as tear-jerking entertainment. Lana Turner is marvelous as the struggling single mother who becomes a movie star, and leads a stellar cast, which includes a brilliant, moving performance from Juanita Moore, as Lana's servant as well as friend. It's Juanita who will use up most of your hankies, and she was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress for her work in this film (losing to Shelley Winters in ""The Diary of Anne Frank""), and also gets some of the best lines, like ""I'd rather be standin' with the lambs and not the goats on judgement day !""

Also nominated for Best Supporting Actress was Susan Kohner, who plays Juanita's daughter, and gets to play a short but wrenching scene (and quite shocking for its time, as this film deals candidly with racial issues) with Troy Donahue. As Lana's daughter, Sandra Dee is wonderful, and shows how good she was as a dramatic actress in her big scene with Lana.

Others in the cast include John Gavin as the man she loves, Dan O'Herlihy as playwright David Edwards, and Robert Alda as theatrical agent Allen Loomis.

The high point in this film for me comes in one of its final scenes, with Mahalia Jackson's sublime rendition of ""Trouble of the World"".

This adaptation of Fannie Hurst's novel was a huge box office hit, and was Sirk's last film (and one of a handful that he directed that did not star Rock Hudson), and it might also be his best. The cinematography by Russell Metty is rich and colorful, and Lana is gorgeous in a sumptuous array of Jean Louis gowns. This was Lana's first major production after the scandal that rocked Hollywood, the slaying of her lover by her daughter, and it was feared that the infamous event had damaged her career, but this film turned out to be one of her biggest successes, and also made her very wealthy, as she opted for 50% of the profits instead of a salary.

1189009,4,B000005XPV,"It's glossy, punchy and melodramatic. The fact that the women are beautiful is an added bonus! This 1959 remake of the original 1934 version probably appeals more to modern day sensibilities. Comparing both versions is inevitable - there are several differences, though the most obvious being the time.

Hollywood Diva Lana Turner plays Lora, a struggling widowed actress and mother who, by chance, meets up with a fellow struggling widow, Annie, played adeptly by Juanita Moore. By now, the Aunt Jemima domestic ""Mammy"" image portrayed by Louise Beavers in the original version was deemed politically incorrect, but Juanita plays the dutiful housekeeper all the same. The daughters (played by Sandra Dee and Susan Khoner) hit it off straight away, although there's tension from Annie's pass-for-white daughter from the outset.

We advance several years with the girls now in their teens. Lora's now made it as a glittering actress, and can now afford to live in the lap of luxury. Another major difference between this version and the original is that the relationship between the leading ladies is more intertwined. There's an on-screen chemistry that's electric, and it makes for compulsive viewing. Susi and Sarah Jane are like sisters - they practically grew up together. There's also a special bond between Susi and Annie. Indeed, Annie knew that Susi was in love long before her mother did.

Although Lana Turner's the star of this movie, she was eclipsed by Juanita Moore and Susan Khoner, who both gave career-best acting performances. Sandra Dee packs a punch too, as the wide-eyed, but neglected Susie. There are some scenes that are heartbreaking, and you can feel Annie's anguish.  Sarah Jane's confused, restless and downright ungrateful! In the end, the viewer doesn't really care about 'Diva' Lora, and her enormous ego.

There's something not quite right about the movie, though and it has nothing to do with the acting. I felt that Sarah Jane's character could have been explored in much more detail. It's 1959, on the verge of the Civil Rights movements. Sarah Jane's a beautiful and intelligent young woman who runs away from home and rejects her mother. For what?  So that she can become a dancer in some sleazy nightclub. Give me a break! This was a cop-out from the director who obviously had a very limited view on the capabilities of African Americans. Sure, racism was rife, but was dancing the only option for a young woman with Susi's capabilities?

Never mind, what's done is done. I just feel the movie lacks the sincerity of the original in certain parts.

The final scenes, like the original, pull out all the stops. Poor Annie - tired, worn and despairing - dies of a broken heart, and has the grandest of funerals, including a majestic, emotionally charged rendition from Gospel legend, Mahalia Jackson. Sarah Jane turns up and throws herself at the casket - just as Peola had done in the original. This is gripping stuff.

Juanita Moore and Susan Khoner received Best Supporting Actress nominations for their roles - deservedly so. For years, everyone assumed that the role of Sarah Jane went to a white actress. CORRECTION! In reality, Susan Khoner was mixed-raced herself (part Mexican). Her own racial ambiguity no doubt gave her a valuable insight into Sarah Jane's character. Alas, like the beautiful Fredi Washington (who was typecast as the 'Tragic Mulatto'), Khoner had no blooming movie career after Imitation of Life. She will always be remembered for her outstanding performance in this movie.

If you're undecided as to which version to get, I'd say get both and make up your own minds as to which version is better. A note to UK viewers - you'll need a VCR with NTSC playback to watch this movie.",1107820800,3,3744,4.966453674121405
1189010,3,B000005XPV,"So sue me, I didn't cry at the hankie-jerking ending.  I'm just not a fan of melodrama.  However, this film is far from a clunker.  Listed on the NY Times ""1000 best movies ever,"" the material lifts this from being just another unintentionally humorous slice of ham wherein the actors are so stagey that it hurts.

The meat of the story involves two mother-daughter relationships damaged by ambition:  In one, Lana Turner's drive to be a great Broadway actress (which helps dilute the hamminess of her performance) keeps her away from daughter Sandra Dee more than either might like, eventually raising some bitterness toward Mommie Dearie.  In the other, live-in African-American maid Juanita Moore serves Turner's character faithfully but her very light-skinned daughter Susan Kohner aspires to more than the world of the 1940s/50s allows most people of color.  These two lesser-known actresses were in fact nominated for Academy Awards for their work in this film.

The entire story line involving Turner, her daughter, and moon-eyed love interest John Gavin is essentially predictable, and is given center stage.  I would've loved to see more screen time given the other characters.  The real drama of the film isn't the hackneyed story of a struggling actress fighting her way to the top without giving in to the advances of sleazy agents and producers, while sacrificing her romance with Gavin on the altar of career, but the struggle of the oppressed African-American, so little explored in films of this era, to have equal rights with people who happened to have been born with lighter skin.

Kohner's character desires to ""pass,"" as it was once known, to call herself white.  The actress playing the role is actually the daughter of Hispanic and Austrian parents, so it's no stretch that she can ""pass for white,"" but she perfectly embodies the angst of her character, which startlingly mirrors that of her ""mammy's"" white ""owner,"" as she once bitterly accuses.

This film is well worth seeing, for those of us young enough to consider this film almost hopelessly dated, because it paints such a vivid picture of the pre-Civil Rights era.  The ambition just to be considered an equal is here presented as strong enough not only for a young lady to totally reject her heritage, not only to leave home and friends and all she's ever known, but to thoroughly defy and despise a dear mother whose only sin was to be born, unlike herself, with noticeably African-American features.  It's forever to the shame of the prejudices of a bygone era that this actually happened sometimes, a part of our nation's race relations that's rarely discussed any longer because it no longer needs to happen.  For that reason, even surrounded by dreadful sequences like the horrifyingly cliche scene that shows the passage of time with ""1948"" and ""1949"" etc. screens zooming at the viewer, and even with Turner's ridiculous number of costume/jewelry changes, ""Imitation of Life"" is very much worth a peek.",1107388800,6,2993,5.004032258064516

Based on the Fannie Hurst story, it is remake of the original 1934 version that starred Claudette Colbert, as ""the pancake queen."" Well, the pancake queen may be fine for Claudette, but certainly not for Lana Turner, who, in this version, plays a Broadway actress named Lora Meredith. We have to face facts: the star machine made Lana look great, but nothing helped her acting. She was dreadful, and far too mannered ever really become her characters. But she was straw turned into gold - the consummate Hollywood star, completely manufactured, with lush, bosom-heaving vehicles designed especially for her. Though only after Lana's 14 year-old daughter, the notorious Cheryl Crane, stabbed Lana's gangster boyfriend to death, did Lana develop the ability to make the characters become herself. The cannibalistic studios went into overdrive with projects that took advantage of Lana's infamy. *Peyton Place* was still in the theatres, and support for Lana throughout her tragedy was profound.

On the heels of this, came *Imitation of Life*, the story of a struggling young actress single-handedly raising a daughter Susie (Dee). They meet up with a lovely, well-spoken homeless woman, Annie (Moore) who is black, and her two-toned daughter, Sarah Jane (Kohner) who hates her blackness more than anything on earth. Annie, who doesn't know how to take ""no"" for an answer, insinuates the lives of her daughter and herself into those of Lora and Susie, and stays with them through the lean years until Lora's a huge success. The ""young"" part is the most treacherous for Lana - her character ages 20 years by simply removing her bandana, and the strange part is, the fashions never change over the course of those twenty years. Let's do a little movie arithmetic, shall we? At the end of the film, Lana's character, Lora, is a major star with a grown daughter, so we can presume that part takes in the present day of 1959. In theory, most of the early action would occur in the 40s. There is absolutely zero indication of time passing, except when they pull the old switch-a-roo with the daughters, substituting Dee and Kohner for the younger actresses who played them in the opening. But, of course, it would be a number of years in the future (until 1966's *Madame X*) before Lana would be allowed to actually age onscreen.

According to Lana's daughter, Cheryl, Lana instructed her to ""walk as if she had a nickel tucked between her buttocks."" Lana demonstrates this technique throughout out the entire film, and it is this same tight-assed approach to acting that makes Lana one of the most fulfilling bad actresses to watch (my mother once pointed out that Lana Turner's name spelled backward was Anal Renrut). Her acting, or better yet, posturing, is strictly by-the-book, but she gives the viewer everything they could desire from the glamour standpoint. Sandra Dee is her usual bubbly self and the dynamics between her and her mother never raise fireworks until the end, but the Kohner-Moore combination is spectacular. The long-suffering Moore made a career out of parts like this, but nothing surpasses Annie's dedication to the Great White Lady Benefactress, Lora Meredith. Kohner's as Annie's daughter Sarah Jane is fabulous - a trashy, tawdry little ingrate who feels she's entitled to everything Susie has. What she doesn't have, and will never have, is Susie's lily-white skin, but that doesn't stop her from `passing.' Annie confides to Miz Lora, ""How do you explain to your child that she was born to be hurt?"" Sarah Jane's white boyfriend (Troy Donahue) beats her to a pulp when he finds out, and she eventually runs off to be a showgirl. Annie tracks her down, and begs her to come home, but is completely rejected, breaking her heart and returning to Miz Lora's with one foot on the grave. Meanwhile, Miz Lora's been romanced by the handsome Steve Archer (Gavin), but he wants her to settle down and be his wife and give her a home. ""I want more than that,"" she tells him, ""I want everything."" They break-up even though he loves her from afar. She parades around in her Jean Louis gowns, with an array of abusive and manipulative men (this is where it becomes hard to distinguish Lora, the character, from Lana, the actress), all of whom help her up the ladder to the pinnacle of stardom. Years later, Lora runs into Steve again, and their love burns brightly anew. As Susie's graduating from school, Lora's flying off to Italy to make some horrid little film, and appoints Steve as chaperone for Susie while she's gone. In a *Mildred Pierce*-ish turn of events (or better yet, a ""Rikki Lake""-ish turn of events), Susie falls in love with her mother's boyfriend, and there are all kinds of mother/daughter problems. Annie's slipping away quietly, but not without planning the grandest funeral - one rivaled only by that of Princess Diana. With weeping crowds, prancing horses and the incomparable Mahalia Jackson singing ""Trouble of the World"" Annie is dispatched to her great reward, but not before her turncoat daughter shows up and hurls herself on the casket sobbing and wailing. This watershed moment is one of the most well-loved scenes in movie history.

The film is Douglas Sirk's (*Written On The Wind* and *Magnificent Obsession*) appropriately lavish farewell to Hollywood. It is camp at its finest and remained Universal biggest moneymaker until *Jaws* in 1975. Though Leonard Maltin says ""Fine performances and direction overcome possible soapiness to make this quite credible and moving,"" and gives it 3.5 stars, I'd give it 5 stars - but there is no solar system in which this movie could be called credible. Credibility is something we simply do not expect out of Lana Turner.

Director Douglas Sirk and his glamorized movies was the inspiration for the much acclaimed film, ""Far from Heaven.""  One can see why Todd Hayes wanted to venture into this director's turf.

In a comical rendition, Imitation of Life, addresses intersections of race, social and economic class, and gender in the film, as well as existing stereotypes, through the use of Neo-Brechtian gestik acting which means over-the-top, melodramatic and campy acting that is quoting a character and his/her emotions and exaggerates the role of a character in a situation. Sirk deliberately wanted to use gestik acting and avoided method acting (acting out what your emotions would really be, if you were in a certain situation) because he didn't want audiences to think that this film was real and to be taken seriously.
 Two single-parenting mothers, Annie and Lora meet on the beach of Coney Island, in search of Lora's daughter Suzie. When Lora and Suzie find out that Annie and her daughter Sara Jane are homeless, Lora decides to let them live in her apartment as long as Annie agrees to contribute some help around the house, and do the dirty work for Lora. Annie is depicted as a parody for blackness, just because she has typical attributes of any nanny. A loving, nurturing, understanding, and caring mother is the stereotypical mother that society adores which is played out by Annie. On the other hand Lora is a neglecting figure in the eyes of Suzie. Annie is more like the mother for Suzie, but not Sara Jane. Sara Jane refuses to admit that she a daughter to a black woman and passes as a white girl while in school. Sara Jane fires up the racial tension in this film because of her denial and mistreatment towards her mother.
 Lora meets a man named Steve, who almost right away, proposes to her. She denies the proposal in an effort to pursue her dream of becoming a Hollywood actress. Steve tries to make her stay, by telling her that she doesn't have to work, and that he will bring home to money. This shows us how Steve along with the majority of society view women and their roles of life. A women's life should be to stay home, clean, take care of the kids, and put dinner on the table, which is the old fashion way that much of male Americans viewed women to perform in. Opposite roles of gender for the male figure in this film was shown through Steve, who has found a detective out of now where, who has found Sara Jane and her place of refuge from her mother. This situation renders Steve as if he were Superman, the one being able to fix any problem.
 This campy imitation of life is viewed throughout most of the film, except for the scene of Annie's funeral, where Mahalia Jackson sings a gospel song. Eulogy of Annie is brought to her through the singing voice of Mahalia. This scene is supposed to be a serious one among the other witty scenes, because the character of Mahalia is the only realistic one in this film and is not to be criticized. Mahalia does not exemplify the overly dramatic acting.",1084233600,3,2929,4.58587786259542
1189017,4,B000005XPV,"Imitation of Life, a 1959 Film by director Douglas Sirk, is a commentary on the relationship between African Americans and Caucasians, as well as the role of women in society.
  Lana Turner is a single white mother of Susie who is attempting to establish herself as an actress and agrees to house Annie, a single black mother, and her daughter Sarah Jane.
  The intersection of race, class and gender are deceptively obvious in the film. Lana, white and Annie, black serve as focal characters in Sirk's social commentary. The white female Lana betrays her role as mother by acquiring a career, and although this outwardly seems progressive, her career is as an actress. This commodifies Lana, making her the object of vision for consumption. Thus Lana remains in a role acceptable to the patriarchal society. Annie, the black female, is created to be the stereotypical motherly homemaker. Not only does she accede to the racism that keeps her in an ""appropriate"" role (subversive to Lana as her maid), she encourages her daughter Sarah Jane, who is able to ""pass"" for white, to embrace her African heritage and all of the racism she will experience for it. This encourages the audience to sympathize with Annie, who has to deal with a rebellious daughter, and further conforms to the demands of white patriarchy by portraying the person attempting to break free from the chains that limit her as the villian. Annie, like Lana is acceptable to the patriarchy because she stays at home and cares for the house and children. Lana eventually becomes a rich, successful actress and while her daughter Susie is applying to colleges, Annie's daughter Sarah Jane is a dancer in a burlesque show. This has the apparent underlying message that only whites can overcome low-class situations and blacks are doomed to lower-class stature and were it not popularly known that Sirk's film is a parody, one might come to the conclusion that Sirk was aiding and abetting the racist undertones of American culture. However, over-the-top acting aides in shocking a critical analysis out of the viewer. Steve, the white male courting Lana, is the voice of ""reason"" in the movie and thus the patriarchy's representative. Whenever a problem arises, Steve is there to solve it, whether or not the means are plausible or realistic. Although Lana is out of the home and making a living, she needs Steve for support, as do the other females in the film. In the end of the film, after the reunion of Sarah Jane with Lana and Susie, Steve is there to look upon the scene and approve of it.
  These features of the film are meant to allow the viewer to realize and expose the underlying messages that they consume on film and television daily.",1084233600,3,2714,4.838362068965517

widow and aspiring actress with a young daughter named Susie. Buy chance she meets
Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore), also a struggling widow and her daughter Sarah Jane.
Lora employs Annie as a 'housekeeper"" which provides Lora enough time to pursue her
dreams and this gives Annie and Sarah Jane a more permeant home. . Lora goes out and
follows her dreams while Annie, takes care of the home and provides a regular home
life for Susie and Sarah Jane.
After some time, Lora becomes a star on Broadway. Along the way, she acquires a love
interest in a man named Steve (John Gavin), who met Lora earlier in the movie and he
was an aspirering artist with dreams of his own. Once Lora has enough money coming
in, Annie, Susie, and Sarah Jane all move to a large house in the country.
Annie still continues to take care of Susie (Sandra Dee) and Sarah Jane (Susan
Koehner) as they grow up into young women. Throughout the movie, you begin to see
the different relationships that develop between the two mother and two daughters.
Sarah Jane dislikes her mother and constantly tries to act like she is white (due to
the fact that she is very light skinned). However, she looks up to Lora because she
is a successful white woman, which is what Sarah Jane wants to be. Susie on the
other hand, drifts further and further from her mother, because Lora is always away
shooting a movie or on tour with a play. She looks up to Annie because Annie was
around the house more than Susie's mother was. This was an excellent film which
showed some of the hardships that were encountered by African-American, mothers and
daughters, and people who were chasing a dream.
This film somewhat critiques existing stereotypes. Earlier in the movie, Steve
proposed to Lora. She refused, breaking the stereotype that woman are dependent on
men. However, at the end, when the three women are in the funeral car, even though
the women are fine, a shot-reverse-shot is used to show Steve legitimizes the fact
that the women are ok. The film also represents intersections of race, social &
economic class, and gender. For example, in the household there were two lower class
African-American women and two lower-middle class Caucasian women, but they were all
viewed as equals by each other, with the exception of Sarah-Jane (she viewed her
mother as subservient to Lora). Steve (a Caucasian, middle-class male) was also
sometimes a member of the house, and he also saw everyone as equals.",1084233600,3,2538,4.7313769751693
1189019,4,B000005XPV,"Douglas Sirk's 1959 remake of John Stahl's 1934 ""Imitation of Life"" uses a parody-type format to show the intersections of race, social & economic class, and gender in thoughtful way.  What I liked about this movie was the fact that ""over the top"" acting was used.  This basically made the film  seem more ""corny"" and ""fake"" which allows us as viewers to truly sit back and analyze the main themes in this movie.  This is known as a ""Verfremdunseffekt"".  It is a tool used in movies to help make certain parts more distinct, which helps us view a film in a different way then we are generally used to viewing a film.  This difference in viewing makes us think more about what is actually is going on and less on what is being done throughout the movie.
 Lora, the main character in the movie is a beautiful, blond woman who is starving to be famous on the stage.  At the beginning of the film we learn that Lara hasn't worked in quite sometime and is having trouble supporting her daughter, Susie, and herself.  What I found ironic was the fact that although she doesn't have much money she was dressed as though she did.  The opening scene shows her wearing a beautiful summer dress on the beach.  The next scene shows Lora at her house wearing yet another beautiful dress.  How can she afford to look like a million dollars if she has no money?  I believe this shows that she feels as though she is always being watched and it is very important for her to look good at all times even if she seemingly can't afford it.  This presents the bases with 20th century philosopher, Foucault's notion of the Panopticon.  Pan meaning ""all"" and opticon meaning ""seeing.""  She feels as though she has to look ""ideal"" because people are watching.  In the beach scene however, a man named Steve is taking pictures of her while she doesn't realize it.  Steve then tells Lora how beautiful she is and that his camera ""could have a love affair with her.""  Yes, it does sound corny, but it does show the irony that Lora was being watched when she didn't know it much like the panopticon theory states.  This is obviously mocking many things during the 1930's-1950's.  Lora is dressed in a beautiful gown even when she's at home.  Like this actually happens in real life?  It reminded me of the 1950's show ""Leave it to Beaver.""  In ""Leave it to Beaver"" the mother, June, is a stay at home mother who does all the housework and grocery shopping.  The funny thing is she's always dressed in high heals, a nice dress, and an expensive pearl necklace while she's doing such things as vacuuming the floor.  This looks just plain ridicules.  She looks likes she's about to go to the ball with prince-charming but in reality she's just doing house work.  The idea that even when no one can see you, you should still look as though someone does see you is touched upon in ""Imitation of Life"".
 ""Imitation of Life"" plays off of many intersections of race class and gender.  As I had stated Lora the stereotypical beautiful woman, becomes the successful one in the story.  While her maid whom she met on the beach, Annie, represents all the stereotypical 1950's things about a maid.  She is black, southern, willing to do anything for Lora, and nice.  The wonderful thing about the movie is, by using over acting they are mocking these stupid stereotypes.  When Annie and her daughter Sarah Jane move in they are ironically given the backroom, barley big enough to fit two people.  But Annie being the ""obedient"" one thinks it is marvelous. She seems as though she is happy to have anything.  This intersection of races shows the effect that the Jim Crow laws of the time had on the way people thought of blacks and whites.  Laws that legally made it so blacks had to sit in the back of the bus and drink from different fountains.  The movie mocks these laws and shows how stupid they are.
 Another interesting thing the movie did was show the intersection of genders.  When Lora first meets Steve she is trying to start a career in the theater.  When the two of them go out the next day Steve comes to pick Lora up and Lora has to break the date because she has just received a call asking her to come try out for a new play.  Knowing that Steve is the ""man"" and that he refuses to have ""his"" girl outside the home, he says ""no you can't go.""  Lora tells Steve how this is her big chance and she must go.  Steve then uses the ale type and tries to take charge by saying ""I'm not asking, I'm telling.""  This demonstrates that Steve is the ""man"" and that he needs to be the one to support Lora and her family, not the other way around.  This scene in particular was one of my favorites for two reasons.  The first one being the major use of over acting to make fun of the situation made it even more humorous.  The second reason being the fact that Steve had only know Lora for a day and he was already trying to tell her what to do.
 This movie did an excellent job of using over-acting to try to pick on certain 1940's aspects of race, gender, and stereotypes.  This movie was very humorous and yet still made you think about what was going on.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a good laugh and enjoys seeing a movie which allows us to critique such things and gender differences, racial differences, social differences, and the Jim Crow Law's of the time.  Such a unique movie for the time!",1084233600,2,5394,4.429878048780488
1189020,3,B000005XPV,"In 1959 Douglass Sirk directed a parody of the 1934 film, Imitation of Life, and that is truly what it was. By playing on issues in our society such as race, gender, class, and mother-daughter relationships, Imitation provides a unique and comical illustration of society and the stereotypes that exist.

Annie and Lora are two widowed single mothers who meet at the beach when Lora's daughter Suzie is missing. The women decide that Annie and her daughter Sara Jane will live with Lora and Suzie. Lora is white and Annie is black. In somewhat of a fake manner, using Gestik acting that quotes an emotion or character, the film presents the intersection of the two women's race, class, and gender.
 Although Lora makes Annie feel comfortable in her home, there is no escaping the fact that she is of a lower social position. This is presented when Lora says ""Have we ever treated you differently?"" Sirk uses height, such as staircases, or chairs to play on these social positions. Additionally, after living together for ten years, Annie still addresses Lora as ""Miss Lora."" Essentially, Annie parodys blackness, and her daughter Sara Jane is struggling with this. Sara Jane resents the fact that her mother is black. She is light skinned and passes as a white girl, enjoying the privileges that her mother never did. Sara Jane is primarily the source of racial tension in this film, bringing up the issues of race that had never before been spoken of. She wants to escape her mother's heritage and their racist society, and be treated the same way as Suzie and Lora.
Lora Meredith seems in many ways to represent Barbie. ""Barbie is white, blond, slim, sexy, attractive, and a conspicuous consumer"" (Pasoonen). Sirk's presentation of her heterosexual femininity is obvious throughout the film in her encounters with Steve, the clothes she wears, the cigarettes she smokes, her hairstyles, and her behavior. Much like Barbie, Lora is an ""icon of successful womanhood"" (Pasoonen). As a middle aged-single mother, she uses her good looks and her talent to become a successful actress and make her way to the top of the social scale. In her conquest for fame, Lora neglects her daughter Suzie, introducing once again the issue of mother-daughter relationships in this film. Just as Sara Jane wishes to have Lora as her white mother, Suzie yearns for a mother as affectionate and caring as Annie. Throughout the film Lora is away pursuing her career while Annie cares for her Suzie. She knows more about her life than Lora does, and is clearly more of a mother figure than Lora ever was.",1084060800,4,2582,4.865909090909091
1189021,5,B000005XPV,"While most cinematic narratives of passing ""so fully naturalize certain givens that they mask a range of contradictions inherent within them,"" Douglas Sirk's 1959 satiric remake of John Stahl's 1934 Imitation of Life brilliantly denaturalizes the intersections of race, class and gender presented in the film through Brechtian gestik acting-that is melodramatic, over-the-top acting that imitates behaviors rather than truly feeling them (quotation Valerie Smith's).  By pursuing the film in this matter, Sirk produces a wonderful alienation effect (known by film connoisseurs as the ""Verfremdungseffekt"") that distances the filmgoers from the action, allowing them instead to sit back and criticize the main themes of the film.  As the film progresses, we begin to wonder why such unnatural actions are considered perfectly natural by the characters, and consequently we begin to analyze the intersections of race, class and gender in America: Why were such racist and materialistic morals audaciously thought as natural and admirable in pre-Civil Rights America?  Why does America idolize such stereotypical representation of beauty?
Lora Meredith (Lana Turner) is first seen through a male lens-literally, that of Steve's (John Gavin's) camera.  The wind blows through her white dress and perfectly-styled blonde hair as she calls for her daughter whom she's neglectfully lost sight of. The camera (both Steve's and Sirk's) moves slowly up her body, capturing what Michel Foucault has termed the ""microphysics of power""-dissecting her figure into ""spatial, temporal, gestural"" fragments that represent the ideal woman (Ingeborg Majer O'Sickey).  Even while in alleged distress, she walks daintily, smiling and holding her head up high, leaning gracefully over the boardwalk.  Her actions, hair and attire closely resemble those of the 1959 Barbie  ""symbolic of society's ideal of the perfect woman"" (Sage Sohier).  We know little about Lora at this point (and neither does Steve), yet we know just by looking at her that she'll be the ""successful"" person in the story, whatever that means.  It is the materialistic characters that Lora represents that make such lines as ""you're making me feel cheap"" by Lora so comical.
Tall, dark and handsome ""Prince Charming"" Steve suddenly appears at Lora's door shortly after the beach adventure with pictures, finds out she's a widow and quickly moves into her life.  The way the two characters passionately throw themselves at each other during love scenes is laughable, especially when followed by Steve proposing marriage right away, then ordering her in his next breath to not go down to the acting studio ""because [he] says so.""  She won't have to worry about getting a job because he'll be ""the man,"" acting out his role as the money-bringer in the house while Lora stays home and looks pretty.  The scene becomes especially comical watching it in the 21st century, when not too many women will settle for the machismo ""men act, women appear"" attitude (John Berger).
As Lora becomes ""successful,"" we are brought into her spotless house filled with every material luxury in the world-yet even then the African American family of Annie (Juanita Moore) and Sarah Jane still stay in back rooms.  Ironically, both daughters begin to reject their own mothers and practically ""switch"" them.  While Annie and Suzy are sickeningly sweet, Annie's Sarah Jane (Susan Kohner) and Lora are overly dramatic.  Even as a little girl, Sarah Jane (Karin Dicker) rejects her ""blackness,"" and tries to pass for white.  While she asserts: ""I'm white,"" the camera slowly moves in on her wide eyes as dramatic music plays, allowing us to criticize her selfish actions for denying her race, rather than transcending racial boundaries.  Similarly, we criticize Lora's actions as an irresponsible mother as she and Suzy drift further apart.  During this tension, we're presented with a great interlude of levity when Suzy shouts ""STOP ACTING!"" at her mother-we were so used to the overacting to begin with that it became hysterical when another character (who acts over-the-top as well) has picked up on it.
While we're constantly reminded that the film is indeed a parodic imitation, we are brought back to the film's serious issues during Annie's lavish funeral scene when Mikaliah Jackson's character poignantly pours her heart out in a beautiful, eulogistic song.  While many pull out the Kleenex during this scene, we must remember that it's NOT supposed to be cathartic.  Instead, we should step back and think about how realistic it was for an African American female to receive such grand attention at a funeral.  Then, we can sit back and cry for a real reason.

1189023,4,B000005XPV,"On the surface, John Stahl's 1934 version of IMITATION OF LIFE and Douglas Sirk's later adaptation in 1959 appear quite similar. Based on the novel by Fannie Hurst (originally published in 1933), each of the two renditions renders the story of a young woman divided between two worlds and her desperate search for her true identity. While Stahl's rather understated approach accomplishes the translation of Hurst's penetrating tale onto the screen with commendable proficiency, it is Sirk who improves upon it, amplifying the story into a masterful and illuminating social drama by exercising the devices of the melodrama to underscore and mine the significant issues of racial prejudice, fumbled motherhood, and materialism in American society in the 1950s.
Putting the ""direct"" in director, Sirk triumphs with his unabashedly frank portrayal of racial hatred in his adaptation. He also uses color to great and conspicuous advantage to identify the immense social divide between blacks and white in the film. In deep contrast to the white hearse carrying Annie's body, the very white-appearing ""family"" of Lora, Susie, Steve, and Sarah Jane are relegated to follow from behind in a black limousine. The black versus white theme displays the opposing magnetic forces between which the biracial Sarah Jane finds herself caught. She is attracted to the white side of life but is naturally pulled toward the black side despite constant resistance. Ironically, only when she finally gives in to the latter's natural gravitational force is she positioned by default and virtually blended into the white domain, fundamentally due to the loss of her only perceptible black affiliation: her birth mother. (A fascinating point: This daughter's appearance at her mother's funeral is inspired by a similar scene in Stahl's version, but in fact the daughter in Hurst's novel doesn't return for the funeral; she has moved to Bolivia with a white man who has no clue about her black heritage).
Sirk also succeeds at accentuating the momentous tug-of-war between a woman's desire to have a successful career and her domestic accountability in the context of the 1950s. Sarah Jane possesses an ambition to get more out of life than what her hereditary role has assigned her, which makes her a lot like the career-ambitious Lora. Likewise, Susie is just as submissive to the cards life has dealt her as Annie is. Lora becomes an unwitting role model for Sarah Jane, and Annie an equally unwitting surrogate mother for Susie. Like Lora's emotionally empty acting career, Sarah Jane's sham of a white existence fails to provide her with the love she so desperately needs, something she eventually recognizes as something she cannot truly ""live"" without. For Annie, life in this fleshly world is a mere imitation of the real life that awaits her in Heaven. The exorbitance of Annie's funeral testifies to the emotional price paid with the loss of such a benevolent human being.
Because Sirk's production style is so excessively augmented, the messages concerning social issues that 1950s viewers would rather not face directly are discreetly concealed in a fashion that makes such propositions easier for them to swallow. Sirk's interiors are extremely over the top, and his exteriors are so fake one cannot help but know they are not real, providing the film with a sense of ""magical unrealism."" Only in this artificial sense of reality can viewers accept the contrived closure given to the social problems that embody the film's plot.
By riveting viewers' attention to the glamorous lifestyle Lora attains through career ambition, Sirk zeroes in on the genuine desires of women of the 1950s, many of which are housewives or women who retreated from the workforce after WWII ended and their men returned home to resume their roles as the primary breadwinners. Having tasted the rewards of working outside the home, 1950s women dreamed of more than their contemporary home-based existence.
Ultimately, Sirk points out that people in life are forced to make choices based on the situations in which they find themselves. All people are, in some way, like Sarah Jane, stuck in a position wanting or needing more out of life than what has been provided freely. To obtain what they yearn for means sacrificing part of their own needs or wants. No one, he asserts, can realistically have it all, no matter how much they try to overcome the partitions that found the structure of society. Humans make choices in life based on what is most important to them. Annie believes life wasn't much without the giving of love to the people around her. Like the message behind the theme song of Sirk's adaptation, Annie trusted in the notion that ""every day would be gray and incomplete without the one you love."" Lora seems to learn this truth about life near the end of the film, when she puts her career on hold so she can be with Steve and Susie on a full-time basis. (Interestingly, Hurst's novel ends with the white daughter falling in love with her mother's beau.) Sarah Jane, however, learns this lesson too late, never to recover the time she could have spent bonding with her now-deceased mother.
Altogether, through his lavishly synthetic and ornate scenery, Sirk yields a high-pitched melody upon the dramatic canvas of life in his implosive acculturation of Hurst's tale of women struggling to find themselves in a complex world. In the end, he holds up his version of IMITATION OF LIFE as a mirror to his audience, showing them who they are, and perhaps more importantly, who they are not.",1078876800,4,5567,5.032502708559047

1189026,4,B000005XPV,"'Imitation of Life' is the story of Lora Meredith (Lana Turner), a struggling actress who makes it big, her maid/friend Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore), who comes to live with Annie and ends up staying for the rest of her life, and their respective daughters Susie and Sarah Jane.
A remake of the 1934 version of the same name, 'Imitation of Life' is still an excellent testimony to the powers of love and ambition. Lana Turner does a decent job with the role of Lora, playing her hard-nosed ambitious character with a decent amount of flintiness. She never seems to be totally believable as a career-driven working mother, though, and this is due to the fact that her scenes with daughter Susie (played with gusto for the most part by Sandra Dee) are tender and beautifully-portrayed. An underrated actress at the best of times, Ms. Turner turns in a beautifully emotional performance at the end of the picture.
In her role as Annie, Juanita Moore excels. Although the premise of the film is now sorely dated, and much of the early situations are by now, frankly, unbelievable, Moore brings a depth of emotion and realism to the part that was previously unseen. Her love for her troubled, ungrateful daughter Sarah Jane will strike a chord with parents and children alike, and Moore's considerable talent as an actress prevents any of the character's key scenes from becoming sentimental.
Sandra Dee as Susie is decent enough, a somewhat spoiled rich kid with a heart of gold, and she plays the part with an endearing energy and innocence, but it's Susan Kohner as Sarah Jane that is a true revelation. She is a powerful and emotional actress, sultry and seductive with the hallmark of a great talent. Her private exchanges with her Mother in Las Vegas, and her boyfriend in New York, are portrayed with realism and pathos. She's probably one of cinema's early anti-heroes, we can't but help feel sympathy for her at certain points in the picture. It's a rare thing to find such a young actress cast in such a demanding role, and it could so easily have been a monotonous performance (the part of Sarah Jane doesn't really call for a range of emotion) but thanks to Kohner, it becomes something real, something believable.
To note, the extraordinary and unusual Mahalia Jackson, credited on the packaging, only has one tiny cameo, but she's astonishing in her scene.
Overall, 'Imitation of Life' is an excellent movie, but there is something of a disjointed feel to it, too. It moves from corny to real quite often (this is not the fault of the Principles, rather a script that has not aged well) and the unintentional racism that is prevalent throughout. It's not a pro-Slavery storyline at all, but political messages in all films of this era are bound to now be redundant. If you can overlook this fact, however, 'Imitation' is a marvellous film.
Direction is decent enough, the 'plastic-fantastic' feel of the late 1950's-style sets and the sometimes garish technicolour of the movie somewhat detracts from the melodrama, but director Douglas Sirk does a great job in exacting wonderfully photogenic performances from his leading ladies, and this does redress the balance somewhat.
The DVD itself is not loaded with special features, but then again it isn't the sort of movie that needs them. Audio and visual quality is decent enough, but the original print is in desperate need of restoration, but there is only a small amount of moments where this is noticable.
The only drawbacks with 'Imitation of Life' are the premise, and  the racism that it invariably invokes. If you can accept the beginning of the story, and overlook the lack of political correctness so typical of this genre, you'll find a very emotional, beautifully-crafted film that is possibly Ms. Turner's finest hour.

Moore's troubled and resentful daughter (Kohner, also fabulous) passes for white, and it is this aspect of the story that is most powerful.

1189033,5,B000005XPV,"Based upon the best selling, Fannie Hurst novel of the same name, this 1959 remake of the 1934 film starring Claudette Colbert and Louise Deavers is a terrific, well acted, sentimental melodrama that should be viewed with a caveat. While not so politically incorrect as to be nearly astounding, as was the 1934 version, it still presents a stereotypic view of blacks reflective of the time in which this movie was filmed. It is certainly is a view that is jarring in these more enlightened times, as it reflects the nature of the racism that was inherent in our society at that time. Remember, this film was made before the civil rights movement took root. Notwithstanding this, it is still a remarkable film that will hold the viewer in its thrall.
Lana Turner plays the role of Lora Meredith, a struggling widow and aspiring actress with a young daughter named Susie. Juanita Moore plays the part of Annie Johnson, also a struggling widow. Together they join forces, enabling Lora to pursue her dreams and Annie to provide a home for her own young daughter, Sarah Jane. Lora follows her dreams of fame and fortune, with Annie, as Lora's housekeeper, providing the stability of a regular home life for Susie and Sarah Jane.
Before you know it, Lora becomes a star on Broadway. Along the way, she is romanced by Steve (John Gavin), who met Lora when she was still living in a cold water flat and he was a promising artist with dreams of his own. While climbing the rungs of the ladder of success, Lora is propositioned by her agent, Allen Loomis (Robert Alda), who, charmed by her basic decency and refusal to go the casting couch route, takes her on as a client, anyway. She also is romanced by a playwright, David Edwards (Dan O'Herlihy), with whom she forges a successful professional collaboration.
Meanwhile, Annie still keeps the hearth fire burning at home, always the perennial ""mammy"", as Susie (Sandra Dee) and Sarah Jane (Susan Koehner) grow up to be two very attractive young ladies. Moreover, while Lora treats Annie with affection, love, and care, there is not a level playing field between them. Lora and Susie always address Annie by her first name. Yet, Annie always addresses them as Miz Lora and Miz Susie. Moreover, while Annie knows everything about Lora's personal life, Lora knows nothing about Annie's, as she has never even asked about it, something Annie points out to Lora. The racial divide is there for all to see.
Meanwhile, the years have passed and Annie's light skinned daughter, clearly knows the score. Sarah Jane certainly has no intention of being anyone's ""mammy"" and wants to pass for white, as she does not wish to be relegated to second class citizenry. She does not try to do this because she wants to be white, but rather, she wants the advantages associated with being white in that time. Hers is not a decision based upon race self-hate, but upon a realistic assessment of how she could be all she could be. Still, she breaks Annie's heart by doing this, and when Annie dies, a part of Sarah Jane dies with her. Annie's funeral is also a focal cinematic moment due to the spiritual sung by the magnificent Mahalia Jackson.
The film updates the original in a number of ways in order to give the film a more contemporary look. The part of Annie (Delilah in the 1934 version) now calls for less of a stereotypic ""mammy"" look. Annie is more of an black Betty Crocker, finer featured, trim, and a bit stylish. Yet, the very nature of the role is still stereotypic in that Annie is still portrayed as the long suffering, self-sacrificing, religious, black servant who wants nothing more than to make life easier for her white mistress. Annie may have shed the ""mammy"" look, but she is still portrayed as a ""mammy"" at heart. Moreover, Lora's relationship with Annie in this 1959 remake is stuck in time, as it is still the same as Bea's relationship with Delilah in the 1934 version.
Interestingly enough, in this remake Susan Koehner, a white actress, was cast in the role of the light skinned Sarah Jane (Peola in the 1934 version), while bi-racial Fredi Washington played the role of the light skinned Peola in the 1934 version. Although the casting of a white woman for the role of a light skinned black woman may be puzzling to those of us in the twenty first century, I presume that this was done in order to be on the safe side. In the 1934 original, Peola did not have a white boyfriend, while in this remake Sarah Jane has an on screen white boyfriend (Troy Donahue). Although she does not have any love scenes with him, there is still the underlying concept of a black woman having a white boyfriend, and they do have a scene together, though it can hardly be called a love scene. I surmise that the studio chose to play it safe for this reason, casting a white actress in the part rather than a light skinned black one, so as to avoid actual controversy in certain parts of the country. This is, however, pure conjecture on my part.
All in all, this is a mesmerizing film, both cinematically and historically, as it is a reflection of another time in which racial conflict was viewed in such a paternalistic way. Lana Turner, Juanita Moore, and Susan Koehner all give moving, compelling performances, notwithstanding the political incorrectness of the script. Sandra Dee sweetly handles the role of Susie with wide-eyed innocence. John Gavin, Robert Alda, and Dan O'Herlihy all give deft supporting performances as the men in Lora's life. Juanita Moore and Susan Koehner each deservedly won an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. This anachronistic, well directed, sentimental tearjerker is a definite must see by those who enjoy first rate melodramas.",1048982400,59,5729,4.73
1189034,4,B000005XPV,"Although little known today, in her own era author Fannie Hurst was among America's most famous authors, a writer who frequently challenged the status quo in both her life and her literature.  Among her most popular works was the novel IMITATION OF LIFE, which first came to the screen starring Claudette Colbert and Louise Beavers in 1934.  Today both the novel and film would be considered somewhat racist--but at the time both were considered social shockers, dealing frankly with single mothers, rebellious daughters, and racial issues in a way that few novels and fewer still films of the era dared.

The first film version was as faithful to the novel as it dared be, telling the story of two single mothers--one black, one white--who join forces and hit the big time when the white woman successfully markets the black woman's pancake recipe.  But the 1959 film version substituted pancake make-up for pancake batter: the white woman is an actress, and with her black friend behind her she climbs the ladder to Broadway stardom.  Director Douglas Sirk was reknowned for his ability with this sort of material, and although he did better films IMITATION OF LIFE is perhaps his most obvious stylistic statement: gallons of gloss, more soap suds than a sink full of dishes, and enough vulgar melodrama to fuel a thousand 1950s schoolgirl dreams.

This time around our stars are Lana Turner and Juanita Moore, supported by Sandra Dee and Susan Kohner as the respective and rebellious daughters who make their mothers lives a living hell, with Lana's daughter Sandra falling in love with her mother's beau and Juanita's daughter Susan determined to defeat the racist society in which she lives by passing for white.  All four actresses give it everything they've got, which means they all emote to the nth degree as they suffer through every emotional upheaval the screenwriters can devise.

Turner and Dee are essentially Turner and Dee.  The real surprises here are Moore and Kohner. Saddled with a story that still keeps the black woman in the kitchen while the white woman plays, Moore nonetheless gives an outstanding and ultimately heartbreaking performance, and Kohner matches her every bit of the way as the wayward daughter who makes one bad choice after another in her refusal to knuckle under to a repressive society.  It is a tremendous pity that neither actress went on to equally high-profile roles and films, but the times were against them--as the very nature of the film's story should make abundantly clear.

The original novel and film were actually advanced for their time, but by the time this version hit the screen the ""white lady upstairs and the black lady downstairs"" was hardly a rung up the ladder.  Even in 1959 many denounced the film as perpetuating racial stereotypes and class-thinking, and by today's standards it is alternately distasteful and absurd.  But oddly enough, that fact doesn't undercut the incredible watchablity of the film.  We may sneer at some of the values it presents, but it holds our attention all the way, and you'll need at least three hankies for the film's conclusion.  If you are torn between purchasing the DVD or a VHS version, you should know that there is actually little difference between the two.  The film has not been restored for DVD, and the lack of restoration is quite noticeable; moreover, the only bonus material on the DVD is the theatrical trailer.  You might prefer to go with a low cost VHS until a really good DVD is released.

Lora is a Broadway starlet intent on hitting the big time, which will come at the cost of her daughter Susie (Sandra Dee), while Annie's daughter Sarah Jane (Susan Kohner) is a black girl with a pale complexion, who chooses to pass as white in order to avoid the hatred of a prejudiced world.

In Douglas Sirk's Imitation of Life, ""living in the back"" is what blacks must do if they are to be good people.  But Sarah Jane DOESN't want to live in the back and this is what makes her bad.
One thing I could never understand about this movie was why Sirkes seemed to make poor old Sarah Jane the villian.  After watching this film again tonight, I realize that Sarah Jane did not want to be white, but rather, she wanted to have the benifits that white people had; and this, in my opinion, made her ""bad.""
Juanita Moore is wonderful as Annie Johnson but she inhabits a role full of stereotypes and cliches.  She is the good suffering black woman who is the ideal servant to her white mistress.  Thus, she is nonthreatning, unlike Sarah Jane who, because she wants all the things that whites get, is a rebel and a threat to white society.  Thus, Sarah Jane must be punished and ultimately humiliated.
This movie is beautifully filmed and I enjoyed the title song sung by Earl Grant at the beginning.  Sirk does innovative camerawork with mirrors and his colors are very lush.  Sandra Dee as Susie is annoying and while Lana Turner can be over the top, this movie is most notable for the performances by Susan Kohner and especially Juanita Moore, two actresses who earned Best Supporting Oscar Nominations for their performances.
A remake of the Preston Sturges 1930s film with Claudette Colbert, Louise Beavers, and Freddie Washington (who is dynamic) as Sarah Jane, this new Imitation of Life is much more aware of the society it is commenting on than the original could ever be.  In any case, this is a movie that should be applauded for its attempt to address racial inequalities and as a time capsule of its period.
The DVD has nothing new to offer.  But there is a widescreen version of the film so that you can appreciate all the lush colors, and there is also the original theatrical trailer and langauge options.  While two of Sirk's films -- ""All That Heaven Allows"" and ""Magnificent Obsession"" have been released on the Criterion label, I only wish this film had also been issued by it.  Then, I think, we would have had a more polished transfer and commentary.  Still, this is a great DVD if you are a movie buff and want to see an important film in its original aspect ratio.",1044144000,,2371,4.524590163934426
1189040,5,B000005XPV,"My five star rating is for the film itself, not the quality of the DVD transfer.  This film is a true classic and though it has some script and scene flaws it still exemplifies the kind of film that Hollywood ""used"" to make so well:  Strong believabe plot (single mother yearns for success in the theatre and will do just about anything to achieve it), Sudden romance that gets in the way of career goals, sub plot involving a black domestic with a daughter who has serious identity problems, sudden fame and fortune and ever degenerating family problems and finally realization that fame and fortune are empty achievements when family and love is sacrificed.  This film closely parallels star Lana Turner's own private and public life, at the time, and was a  better screenplay than IMITATION.  That fact might be the main reason she was chosen for the role and the film scored so
big at the boxoffice.
In addition to the glitzy cast, Turner, John Gavin, Sandra Dee and Robert Alda, relative newcomers Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner round out an impressive cast.  This undoubtedly was Turner's biggest and most successful role, revitalizing a waning film career.  The film, under Ross Hunter's direction, will show younger audiences what ""real glamour"" and ""star power"" is all about.  Lana was the epitome of the ""star"", always carried herself like a queen and commanded the attention on the screen in every scene she was in (Jennifer Lopez and Cameron Diaz note).  The sets, wardrobe, jewels and makeup are sumptuous.  The romantic interludes suggest rather than hit you in the face, graphically.  The last thirty minutes of the film will leave the most hardened viewer emotionally drained.  My family has seen it countless times, we enjoy it each time and are tear filled at the end.  The lesson it conveys is timeless and the film exemplifies great movie making of a bygone era magnificently.

1189041,5,B000005XPV,"Okay so I haven't seen the DVD specifically but I have seen the film and for a person who thinks filmmaking didn't even exist prior to Star Wars (I'm a 70's baby what can I say), I have to say I found this film both entertaining, thoughtful and downright aggravating. Anything that can make me feel all that is definitely worth recognition.
  Juanita Moore is wonderful as the mother, Annie Johnson, who only wants her daughter to accept her. Susan Kohner portrays the hateful Sarah Jane, a bit too well, as she rejects everything being Black means in 1950's America and tries to pass herself off as White.
  If you don't want to slap Sarah Jane and scream at her at the top of your lungs, then you might want to check your pulse. If Juanita's peformance as the dismissed mother doesn't touch your heart, then you might not have one. Imitation of Life is definitely a misnomer because there is no film out there that is more original.",1043798400,4,934,4.508875739644971
1189042,5,B000005XPV,"Universal Pictures brings us this very controversal 1959 Technicolor picture to Anamorphic WideScreen DVD.  The picture I agree is not the best quality but still delivers an acceptable Widescreen presentation for Home Theatre Systems.
""Imitation of Life"" is an outstanding motion picture with very strong subject matter especially for 1959.  The emotional rollercoaster ride we the audience take with Lana Turner & Juanita Moore two widows with daughters struggle together to find true happiness & over come the worlds racial prejudice.
Homeless Moore is truely outstanding as the Black devoted mother who has an 8 year old very light skinned daughter who is ashamed of being Black & her Black mother.  Turner a struggling actress with a 6 year old daughter befriend Moore, take them in and begin a life long friendship.  The acting of all the stars supports very stongely the emotional journey these characters had to endure.
I guarantee this will bring a tear to many of eyes so keep a box of tissues handy for this very heart filled story.  Enjoy.",1043452800,3,1050,5.011494252873563
1189043,1,B000005XPV,"Thanks, David Durbin.  Your review made me pull this order from my shoppiong cart.  ""Imitation"" is a real ""tear-jerkin'"" classic in the old mold.  I ran it as a Theater Projectionist in it's original 1959 theatrical release.  The last reel was about a 12 minute run.  I could step out of the Projection Booth after the chnage-over, and regular as clockwork it would happen. I would hear the start of a swell of sniffles, and tears come up like a rising tide in theater in that last reel every night.  That was when audiences showed emotion openly.  I won't buy any bad DVD transfers.  I strongly bad-mouth bad transfers to all my film buff friends to also not buy.  With the quality of DVD's, why buy garbage.  Most of my DVD purchases have been with Criterion for that reason.  Sure hope Criterion get their hands on ""Imitation"", and a lot more classics!",1043193600,54,855,4.559210526315789
1189044,5,B000005XPV,"Lana Turner was the reason for this 50's Universal remake of the Fannie Hurst perennial tearjerker, IMITATION OF LIFE.  She was fresh from daughter Cheryl Crane's trial for the murder of thug Johnny Stampanato, and producer Ross Hunter found the prospect of starring Lana in a saga of mother/daughter conflict commercially irresistable.  Ironically, to today's audiences, Lana's the least interesting element of the picture.  She gives her all as the Broadway star who's Too Busy With Her Career to really know daughter Sandra Dee (in a suprisingly fresh and thoughtful performance; Dee, so often better than you think she's going to be, is probably due for a critical reevaulation someday soon).  But Lana's all is too carefully lacquered to be of much interest.  Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner, both supporting-actress Oscar nominees for their work here, are the real deal.  Moore, as the long-suffering, too-good-to-be-true black maid, and Kohner, as her tragic daughter Sarah Jane, determined to ditch her mother and pass as white, take roles conceived (in this version, anyhow) in cardboard and elevate them to art.  Aided by Douglas Sirk's sympathetic direction, the mother/daughter scenes here are primal and heartrending.  Moore's California farewell to her daughter and subsequent death scene, and Kohner's guiltridden reappearance at the picture's end, would move a stone to tears.  Moore's subtle, shattering underplaying on her deathbed stands in sharp contrast to Lana's carefully-filtered histrionics.  Like Sirk's other 50's UI masterpieces, IMITATION is unafraid of melodrama, and its direct emotionalism still packs quite a punch.  Thanks to Lana, not the best of the Sirk bunch, but still essential viewing for students of popular culture or anyone who enjoys a three-hankie movie.",1043107200,2,1799,5.458483754512636

I add my comments to theirs only in the hope that somebody somewhere in a position to do something about it may one day produce as good a transfer as this film deserves. Looking, for the first hour at least, as if it was filmed through a hiking sock, the DVD destroys all Sirk's brilliance with colour and design so that what you end up with is a dull, flatly lit TV soap. Rent it, certainly. Buy it only if you're a genuine Sirk fan.",1043020800,6,572,4.305555555555555
1189046,5,B000005XPV,"It wasn't until recently that I discovered that four of my favorite films (""Psycho"", ""Back Street"", ""Spartacus"", and ""Imitation of Life"") had one thing in common, other than being produced by the same company, Universal, and that is featured player John Gavin. While the actor never achieved stardom as might have been expected by the powers-that-be who thought him to be the next Rock Hudson, Gavin did serviceable ""leading man"" support.
That said, for many African-Americans around during the late 50's and early 60's, Sirk's ""Imitation of Life"" offered, though glamorized, a portrait of the common practice of ""passing"" by lighter-skinned blacks. The fact that the part of the ""yella gal"" was played by white actress Susan Kohner was not detracting from the realism of that particular convention of black life.
Both Kohner and Juanita Moore were nominated for supporting actress Oscars but were not recipients of the much-hallowed honor. However, their work, along with the tremendous guest appearance of gospel legend Mahalia Jackson, is the reason for the film's success and popularity.

It may not rank in that annuls of great American films, but ""Imitation of Life"" is a tear-inducing melodrama that never fails to captivate in all its Technicolor glory.",1042761600,3,1261,5.242574257425742
1189047,5,B000005XPV,"I'm a white man, but I find it appalling that the studio rereleases a movie about the intertwined lives of four women - two black, two white - in a story that's charged with racial issues but IGNORES the black cast members on the DVD cover. What is going on? Both of the black actresses were better than John Gavin, on the left, and who cares who the bland actor is who played the theatrical director? He hardly registers in the film but somehow trumps Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner here. Nevertheless, the film is incredible, especially considering its era, and is far more powerful emotionally than Todd Haynes's brilliant and beautiful 2002 homage to IOL director Douglas Sirk, ""Far From Heaven.""",1041811200,12,700,4.745901639344262
1189048,4,B000005XPV,"This is one of the classic ""three-hankie"" weepers.  A slick, glossy production showcasing the talents of Lana Turner, Juanita Moore, Sandra Dee & Susan Kohner.  Turner stars as an up-and-coming Broadway actress and takes on Moore as a  companion/housekeeper.  Each woman has a daughter, who in turn grow up to have their own set of problems; Turner's daughter (Dee) suffers neglect due to her mother's success and Moore's daughter (Kohner), a light-skinned African American, causes her mother various heartaches by passing herself off as white.  Excellent performances in soap opera-type film by Douglas Sirk.  Touching relationship between Turner & Moore well played.  Kohner's performance is a revelation.  Don't miss the end of the film---a real weeper!",1041638400,,756,5.456896551724138
1189049,3,B000005XPV,"Sure it was but this time, we have Lana Turner poured into a white evening gown, looking like she means business, and she does. The story is basically simple - two single mothers, one white, one black, each with a troubled daughter. Throw in the deadly handsome leading man and a Mahalia Jackson funeral and you have a definite period piece. Sure, it's not a fun movie, but it has it's moments and Sandra Dee could give anyone lessons in overacting. Still, it's a guilty pleasure and don't we all just think Sara Jane got just what she deserved !",1041206400,,546,4.47
1189050,5,B000005XPV,"Imitation of Life was actually quite bold for its time. In a quiet way it made some stinging observations about race and class in America. Lana Turner's character, Julie, calls her black room mate her best friend in private but in public, Annie is clearly the maid. Miss Julie has a child but that child is really being raised by Annie. Annie has a child but that child hates her blackness so much that she abandons her own mother for being too dark skinned to pass for anything else.
Everything that happens in this movie leads up to one powerful scene that still makes me cry to this day. It's Annie's furneral. Unlike Miss Julie, Annie REALLY saved her money and it's a funeral fit for a queen. Mahalia Jackson is singing Troubles of the World and every black person from what looks like the whole of New York is in attendence along with Lana Turner and Sandra Dee who ride in the family(!) car behind the hearse. Suddenly Sarah Jane, Annie's daughter appears crying for her mama--in public. She's admited before all of NYC that she's black and she loves her black mother but it's too late.  Forget the sub plot of the love triangle with Turner and Dee. This movie is all about Annie and Sarah Jane and it's all about race.",1039305600,7,1226,4.473214285714286
1189051,3,B000005XPV,"Essentially the film is a perfect instance of an interesting, even compelling, plotline about racial tensions that I find very hard to stayed focused on and moved by. The embarrassingly clunky dialogue and some grotesquely over-the-top performances (especially Lana Turner's) prove too distracting for me to get past. But the film has one authenic, overpoweringly beautiful element:  Mahalia Jackson, in the funeral scene very near the end of the movie, singing ""Troubles of the World."" Jackson is in magnificent voice and means every word of ""Troubles."" Finally someone makes something believeable of the material she's been given. Unfortunately, it comes too late to redeem what's come before it. But watch the film anyway--for the story and for Jackson's glory. Like me, you can always  fast forward through the cheesy bits and get to the funeral where, ironically, via a few minutes of supreme vocalism about the pain and consolations of death, the imitation of life this picture is suddenly gets real.",1028332800,3,1006,5.24223602484472
1189052,3,B000005XPV,"This film annoys me: The original is about 2 women who work together as a team to try to better themselves, but they are thrown into various ""roles"" by society.  In the remake, Lana Turner is supposed to be this struggling mother, but from the very first scene you see her as the glamorous movie star that she was - and when she befriends Annie, the black women who is also struggling - she immidiately puts her in the back room off the kitchen and keeps her there for the rest of the movie.
While the original had much to say about race relations, this one is basically a vehicle for Lana Turner and Sandra Dee to strut around in designer gowns.  There is even a totally stupid sub-plot where Lana Turner (mother) and Sandra Dee (daugher) are in love with the same man !!  It gets worse, near the end Sandra Dee is getting ready to graduate from her all-white private school. But where is Sara Jane, Annies light skinned daughter?  Presumably at the public school, but this is never even mentioned, and no one sees anything wrong here.  The whole movie is about Lana Turner becoming a famous broadway actress and having glamorous parties while Annie waits on her hand and foot, even giving her foot massages.  When the movie does finally try to get serious and make a point, it falls flat on it's face because they've spent so little time developing any real story or character developement.  It is too bad, because the performance by EVERYONE (with the exception of Lana Turner, who gives overacting a whole new meaning) are deep and good, and could have been so much better if only the writers had bothered to give them a REAL story.  It is worth watching I suppose, but if you're like me, it'll just make you mad because you'll realize how good this film COULD have been with a bit more effort and nerve.",1027814400,6,1808,4.474164133738602

1189055,5,B000005XPV,"This film was extraordinary.  Juanita Moore's role of a black mother raising her half white daughter who was in total denial of her heritage made the movie more than touching.
The mere fact that Juanita Moore's character desired nothing but the best for her daughter and was taken by having a beautiful funeral.  In her words "" The day you get married and the day you die are two of the biggest events in a person's life ..."" and something to the effect that she wanted her funeral to be the biggest and grandest of them all.  I highly recommend this film.

1189056,2,B000005XPV,"Sadly two of the main characters in this movie are nothing more than cardboard.  Sandra Dee gets the worst of but Juanita Moore does not fare much better.
Lora Meredith is woman who knows what she wants.  Success, fame, fortune, and the good life for her daughter, Susie.  Annie Johnson is a woman of much practicality combined with simpler dreams.  A home for her child and spectacular funeral.
Annie knows that the road for black people in her world is harsh.  She asks, ""how do I raise my child to be hurt?""  These are questions that cannot be answered then or now easily, however she is willing to endure the lot that has been given to her with a great deal of stoicism.  The same cannot be said of Annie's daughter, Sara Jane, she has been marked for a much crueler fate.  Sara Jane has skin so light that she is routinely mistaken for white.  Unlike her mother she not only sees how the other half-lives, she often lives it too.  Each time Sara Jane manages to `pass' her mother inevitably shows up to set the record straight and make sure that everyone knows her daughter is really a Negro.  It is not surprising the reaction that Sara Jane has to this interference. This is really the only story than can resonate with contemporary viewers.
Lana Turner IS able to realize her dream of fame and fortune, but at the price of knowing her family.  She sends her daughter to the best schools, and always buys her the nicest things.  Both she and her child are unfailingly polite to the Johnsons and of course the daughters grow up like sisters (except for that whole best schools and nicest things part).  While they do not tolerate any racism, I never fail to notice that both the Johnsons always refer to any of the white characters as ""Miss Susie"" or ""Ms Lora"".

Viewing the movie through the lens of the 1950s era, (this is a remake of the original 1934 movie) when things were very different in America, it addresses multiple issues: Passing - something that could be discussed for hours with no right or wrong conclusion, Single mothers - another huge issue during the post war era, Equality - views changed greatly across the US in one generation, Mothers and Daughters - I found the choices each mother made intriguing as one woman was quite happy to follow a more traditional path, while the other coveted success. The daughters were equally interesting, sisters in all but blood, yet their desires as young women were almost the complete opposite of their own mothers. The beliefs and choices tore at this family unit until it broke. Opposite Sex - What happens when a man comes between a mother and daughter?  Big funerals - quite important during this era, many put their life savings aside for the big event, much different from modern day 'spend it while you have it' philosophy. There's a lot packed into this one, brilliant movie. My favorite scene is the funeral with the grand horse and carriage while the Queen of Gospel, Mahalia Jackson sings.
