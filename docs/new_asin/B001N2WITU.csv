8323064,4,B001N2WITU,"I've been trying to find it ever since. I could only remember the details of ""Tea for Two"" as the code whistle and the ""evade the Nazis"" angle of the adventure. Boy was that tough. This film is not in the same league as Black Book. It is, however, a cute romp that makes fun of the devils that were stomping all over Europe just twenty years prior.",1391904000,,348,4.132352941176471
8323065,5,B001N2WITU,"For a US/British viewer Terry Thomas steals the show but it is just great fun watching the flow of the movie! You don't need to know French for this to work, but it does help.  The visual humor and timing of the international cast makes this a classic for all cultures. Chaplin resisted talkies because he felt they would hinder international understanding.  This film proves Chaplin wrong.",1370908800,,390,4.8059701492537314
8323066,5,B001N2WITU,"Excellent copy and hilarious, as always.  I hadn't seen it for years but it really holds up! Seems like every actor was born to play the character he plays as they fit perfectly and Bourvil vs de Funes is an over the top comic combination.",1361232000,,239,4.311111111111111
8323067,5,B001N2WITU,"I LOVE this movie! Star studded (the actors are famous in Europe but it's about time they become known in USA as well). Louis de Funes and Bourvil at their best! A good movie to watch with the entire family. The DVD is recorded in the European system so it might not work on all DVD players. It didn't work on mine but it worked on my computer so I connected the computer to the TV and watched the movie without a problem. The movie is both French and English, with English subtitles when French is spoken. I highly recommend this movie. It's impossible not to laugh while watching it.",1358121600,3,585,4.327272727272727
8323068,4,B001N2WITU,"The movie is extremely funny, but only if you can understand it.  This version is in French with no subtitles, so don't get it if you don't understand French.  The version with English subtitles is call Don't Look Now, We're Being Shot At.",1353715200,3,239,4.534883720930233
8323069,5,B001N2WITU,"This movie is hilarious.  No wonder it's been a classic that's been watched for many years!  Be aware that there are no subtitles so whoever watches this must be able to understand French, English and probably some German too.  I cannot understand German but can the other two languages.  Other than that, I couldn't stop laughing throughout this movie.  I highly recommend it.",1319500800,2,377,4.920634920634921
8323070,5,B001N2WITU,"Ask any Frenchman what his favourite film is, and chances are this one will come out on top. The film came out in 1966 and it held the French box-office record until Dany Boon's 'Les Ch'tis' in 2008! It stars two of the country's best-loved comic actors, Louis de Funs and Bourvil, in a WW2 comedy also featuring the talents of Terry-Thomas. The original title ""La Grande Vadrouille"" is difficult to render but refers to the mad dash across occupied France. In 1942, an RAF plane is shot down over Paris and the three airmen parachute to safety: one lands on Bourvil's painter's scaffolding, another on the roof of the Opera house where the orchestra (led by de Funs) is rehearsing and Terry-Thomas ends up in the seal's bathing pond at the zoo. Our two heroes somewhat reluctantly join forces to take them under their wing(s) and thwart the occupying German police's efforts to capture them before they can escape to the 'free zone'.

The comic moments from this film by Grard Oury and now firmly engraved in the French people's subconscious are too numerous to mention. Watch it in French with subtitles rather than a dubbed version - there's a fair amount of English in it anyway. You'll find yourself whistling 'Tea for Two' the next time you visit the Turkish baths, that's for sure! It's hard to believe that this film is practically unknown in Britain and America. Don't neglect it any longer. If you like it, give ""Le Corniaud"" a try as well - by the same director and with the same two stars - the scene of the crash with a 2CV at the beginning is THE classic comedy moment in French cinema!",1301270400,8,1600,4.574912891986063
8323071,5,B001N2WITU,"A great dvd in french,that keeps you laughing from beginning till end.
Many famous actors play in this dvd.",1264809600,7,107,4.684210526315789
8323072,5,B001N2WITU,"This is a beloved movie in France where it remained the top grossing film of all times for over 30 years. Louis de Funes and Bourvil share top billing and are true comedic geniuses.

The story takes place during WWII. The crew of a British bomber is forced to parachute over Paris. One crewman lands on the scaffolding of a building painter (Bourvil). Another ends up at the opera, in the office of a short tempered conductor (De Funes). The two Frenchmen are involved against their will in the crew's journey south and their attempt to cross into the free zone (the part of France that wasn't occupied by the Germans).

The trip provides many opportunities for danger, hilarious situations and misunderstandings. This is the perfect ""buddy movie"" where de Funes plays the irascible  and obnoxious member of the Parisian elite while Bourvil is a working class, generous (and often taken advantage of)  average Joe.

The classic nature of ""La Grande Vadrouille"" cannot be overstated. It is required viewing for all students of the French language and culture.",1196985600,14,1058,4.921348314606742
