2562634,5,B000FFJ876,"Compilers of this box of four classic Will Rogers movies did an outstanding job.  The four DVDs come in an attractive & colorful case; a note booklet offers informative summaries and commentary on the films; and each of the four is lovingly remastered with wonderful sound & picture quality.  Films here in volume 1 are, to me at least, a little more entertaining than those in volume 2 -- but all manage to evoke a long-lost, simpler time in small-town or rural America when good will and humor carried the day over selfishness and greed.

I hope that Volumes 3 and beyond will continue this series; still unreleased on DVD as I write are such classics as State Fair, County Chairman, and Connecticut Yankee.",1339372800,5,709,4.701612903225806
2562635,5,B000FFJ876,"This is a great set of Will Rogers films with very good DVD quality.  There is a good commentary on ""Steamboat"" by Scott Eyman.  The other 3 films have commentaries by Anthony Slide which are more annoying than informative.  Perhaps because I love these films so much, I can't listen to someone who keeps talking about how weak a plot or scene is and just being overly critical of the films.  Not to mention having to listen to his PC garbage.  Otherwise, I give this 5 stars.",1223164800,3,476,4.425287356321839
2562636,5,B000FFJ876,"I BELIEVE THE NEW MOSES! ... Get this set for this Movie! Ann Shirley (as cute little FLEETY BELLE), Steppin Fetchit ... (who we finally see in the 21st century), Will Rogers ... (The American Icon closest to Mark Twain), all at their classic best. In the early 60's this movie regularly played on the independent TV channels in Los Angeles, (then, suddenly pulled due to stereotyping). This is the jewel of the Collection for sure! Other movies are really cool too, just see STEAMBOAT ROUND THE BEND and you'll be amazed!

I'm told the actual race was filmed in Sacramento! (REAL STEAMBOATS!)",1169078400,6,593,4.757281553398058
2562637,4,B000FFJ876,"In Old Kentucky was released shortly after Rogers's death, and is his last-released film, though not the last film he starred in.  Steamboat Round the Bend was filmed earlier, but released first, as it was thought to be the stronger work.  Fox Films and 20th Century Fox produced this warm Americana, set in the 1920s.

Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, known for a similar dance performance with Shirley Temple in ""The Little Colonel,"" appears throughout.  His role in was intended for Stepin Fetchit, but that actor was working on another film and his role was rewritten to allow Robinson to show off his famous dancing.

Critical commentary by Anthony Slide is worthwhile, despite his lisp--""I have a bwidge in Bwooklyn,"" reminiscent of ""Life of Brian.""  Slide is more critical than warranted-- for example:  ""another weak sight gag, and equally weak as the first sight gag at the beginning of the film.""  Charlie Chaplin this isn't - if you want brilliant sight gags rent Chaplin or Keaton instead.

Slide's pointing out stunt doubles didn't add to my appreciation of the film, but his commentary on the careers of the players, many from vaudeville, was valuable.  More annoying is Slide's obsession with every instance of perceived racism.  It is difficult to review a film released 72 years ago and not apply today's standards.  Slide gives a good discussion on blackface during the blackface dance scene.

Choose Language Selection > English Stereo as the program defaults to Mono.

Rogers's fly medicine monologue was a high point in the film, as were all the scenes with Rogers dancing.  The second half of the film picks up speed until the end, which had me laughing out loud.  While this may not be Rogers's best work, you will be delighted by his warm wit and wry humor.

Will Rogers has been compared to Mark Twain for his humor.  After Rogers's tragic death in 1935, people in 12,000 theaters observed two minutes of silence.

Steamboat Round the Bend is one of 3 collaborations between director John Ford and actor Will Rogers, and was shot in 6 weeks in the Sacramento River Delta.

The commentary by Scott Eyman, on the 2006 DVD, is worth having apart from the film.  Eyman is author of two books on director John Ford:  Print the Legend, and John Ford:  The Complete Films.  His commentary is among the very best I have ever heard.

Standout scenes:  An exquisite wedding ceremony brings tears even to Will Rogers's eyes, and he is  not acting.  Anne Shirley as Fleety Belle is stunning in her delicate beauty throughout.  The ""New Moses,"" Berton Churchill, is memorable in his role as a full-of-himself blowhard, as he was playing the prosecuting attorney in the 1934 ""Judge Priest,"" another Ford-Rogers collaboration.  Another reprise from Judge Priest is John Ford's brother Francis, again playing a drunk with amazing aim when he spits.  A final highlight is supercharging the Claremore Queen firebox with the Pocahontas Remedy.

Some viewers are disturbed by Lincoln Perry's (Stepin Fetchit) character, but more disturbing to me was the lassoing of Moses!  Scott Eyman gives a superb analysis of the dull and slow character played by Stepin Fetchit--transcending the kneejerk politically-correct reaction of today, and placing Fetchit's characterization (and that of Hattie McDaniel in other films) in a larger context.  He says ""might I offer a modest proposal:  Is it not now time to look past the stereotypes these actors portrayed-- and look at the art, and the warmth, with which they played them.""

Two other films with Rogers have the same charm and image of 19th Century american values; one is the Ford- Rogers collaboration Judge Priest, and the other, also released in 1935, is In Old Kentucky.

Commentator Eyman says ""taken together, the 3 Ford-Rogers films (Judge Priest, Dr. Boles, and Steamboat) rank with Ford's finest achievements.""",1168473600,22,3866,5.003134796238244

These remastered movie DVDs give a brief and welcome glance at what humor was in pre WWII America. Will was probably the second most important figure, after FDR, in America surviving the depression.  His role was wit and compassion.  Both are in evidense in these four films.  More of the same, please.

2562641,5,B000FFJ876,"I can't vouch for two of the films in this set (just ordered it) but Steamboat is worth the money alone.  Absolutely hilarious.  This film is dated obviously, but the humor and sarcasim are spot-on.

I'm thrilled to find Steamboat finally released on DVD.  The others I may have seen years ago also, but they don't ring a bell right off.  I will say that Will Rogers was a very funny comedian and took great strides at knocking the edge off of what today would be the ""Politically Correct"" crowd and social elite.

Update: 2010;  I've watched these classic movies and they are excellent.  The transfer to DVD is good and they are very watchable considering their age.  It's a good set for sure, but worth it completely for Steamboat... my favorite.",1159747200,7,748,4.606060606060606
2562642,5,B000FFJ876,"Will Rogers is finally getting his due after years of very little other than a short-lived VHS series in the early '90s and years of public domain odds and ends, most of it from very faint duped masters.

Apart from his status as a pundit, Rogers was among the greatest of the movie comedians of the '30s, in the same company as Fields, Dressler, Laurel & Hardy, and the Marx Bros. Even in his weaker movies, his performance and personality stand out.

The four comedies will raise some eyebrows: ""Doubting Thomas"" is very sexist, and ""Steamboat 'Round the Bend"" has Stepin Fetchit. But if there's any viciousness in these movies, it's aimed squarely at hypocrisy, petty societal maneuvering, and the status quo. Rogers' movies had some of the most barbed and cynical scripts of the day (as did Marie Dressler's), and it's Rogers' performances that make them watchable, funny, and to a great degree, fascinating. Miss this collection and you're missing the best dollop of humor this side of Mark Twain.",1155945600,12,1002,4.853801169590644
2562643,4,B000FFJ876,"When Will Rogers died in 1935, he was the biggest star in Hollywood.  The films captured in this collection show him as a somewhat wise elder to a nation eager for a little direction.

Life Begins at Forty is an oddly titled film. I was imagining a light comedy. Instead it's about a power struggle between a newspaper publisher (Rogers) and Col. Joseph Abercrombie, the town's banker and political boss. T

Doubting Thomas has Rogers as a husband dealing with his wife wanting to get into showbiz. His wife, Billie Burke, has the lead in a small town play and the female director think she's got star potential.

Steamboat 'Round the Bend was the last film Rogers made. The film starts with him as a medicine man moving his health tonic on the Mississippi River. But gets out of the fake pharmaceutical business and uses his medical profits to fix up a steamboat.

While In Old Kentucky was Rogers' penultimate production, it was his final film released to theaters. Rogers plays a race horse trainer who quits his employers' farm in order to train a single horse for the big race.

The best of the bonus material is the A&E Biography which gives you a great insight as to what Rogers did and how a country cared about his homespun wisdom.",1154822400,37,1240,4.588235294117647

2562670,4,B000FFJ876,"This is a wonderful film for any Will Rogers fan. Also, a great little film to see Richard Cromwell who is not as well known today. Solid supporting cast and story line. The only problem I came across was the commentary by Anthony Slide. When I see Richard Cromwell come on screen the last adjective I would use to describe him would be ""pasty face."" He practically insults every actor on the screen and I found that after twenty minutes I could no longer listen to it. Informative or not there were too many insults to keep my interest. The film is great, and definitely worth a look. Too bad the film reviewer took his job as critic to mean a lack of sensitivity which overshadows any compelling information he may have had about the film.",1394236800,,741,4.455882352941177

8121732,5,B000FFJ876,"The Will Rogers collection,Vol1., features four of the 21 films he made for Fox. All of the films highlight Rogers wit and charm, while his ""aww shucks"" attitude and western drawl are always on hand for some laughs and reassurance.
""Life Begins at 40"" (released Mar/35)stars,among others,Will Rogers,Richard Cromwell,George Barbier,and Jane Darwell. The story finds Rogers as a small town newspaper man. He is in debt to the local banker who is also running for local office. However when Rogers hires an ex con who returns home,the banker forecloses on the paper and takes it over. Rogers gets revenge by starting up a new newspaper. As the film comes to an end, the ex con is found out to be innocent,as it was the bankers son who committed the original crime.
This is a charming and quaint film,done in the typical Rogers easy going style. Commentary and a restoration comparison are the extras. 3 1/2-4 stars.
Steamboat Round the Bend(released Sept/35-a month after his death)stars,among others,Rogers and Anne Shirley. This one finds Rogers taking over an old run down steamboat. His nephew shows up to help but has killed a man in self defense. Rogers implores him to turn himself in. He also has a new spunky wife who isn't as certain that should do so either. Rogers escorts his nephew to jail and sets about trying to clear his name. The only witness to the crime is an evangelist named The New Moses. The rest of the film concerns Rogers attempts to locate the New Moses,see the Governor and stop his nephew from being hung. Which he does.
This was Rogers last movie,and was with director John Ford. I have always thought Ford was better at more serious work than comedies. His direction often gets muddled. Give Ford some funny lines to insert,but not an entire movie to play funny with. This is average fare for Rogers and while it has its moments the pace can be slow at times. Extras include commentary and the trailer. 3 stars.
Doubting Thomas(released June/35)stars,among others,Will Rogers,Billie Burke and Alison Skipworth. This one has Rogers as a sausage baron. His wife gets mixed up with a local theatrical troupe which turns her head. He lets her follow through, but the play she stars in is little more than  a joke,but not to her and the rest of the cast. Rogers hires a local actor to come in and severely critique the entire cast after its over. He deems Rogers however a ""find"",and Rogers pretends he's off to Hollywood. In the end Rogers begs off the trip and his wife agrees to quite ""showbiz"". This is an uneven effort, but it does give a chance for Rogers to send up the then ""crooning""craze,especially one named Crosby. It is not up to Rogers better works. Extras include newsreel footage re Will Rogers,restoration comparison,commentary and a wonderful A&E biography of Will Rogers. The goodies make up for the poor film. 2 1/2-3 stars.
Finally there is In Old Kentucky(released Nov/35-about four months after his death)starring,among others,Will Rogers and Dorothy Wilson. The story finds Rogers as the local vet who owns a prize race horse named Greyboy. However a rival family has been after acquiring the horse for a long time. They try every trick they can think of  and come close,but never succeed. Finally a big race comes and the jockey pulls out,due to pressure from the rival family. The niece herself rides and wins the race.
This film is definitely a step up for Rogers as it highlights some funny fancy foot work of his own, and wonderful co star Bill Bojangles Robinson. It is an interesting story with the concurrent side plot of a grandpa with a shotgun and poor eyesight to liven things up. Extras include Fox newsreel footage and commentary. 4 stars.
The set is a fine intro to a beloved entertainer,writer,comedian and humourist. Rogers may have came on as a country hick, but he had more common sense than most men have money. Rogers was the real deal as far as his horse skills and rodeo career go. He was a people person and most folks at the time saw that genuineness shine through. He was feted by presidents and prime ministers, but never ever once forgot his roots. This set ,while not his consistently best works,is a good start. I hope that,if available,all his films can be released eventually. These films are fit for audiences of any age.",1484697600,,4304,4.752673796791444

Rogers started in film in the silent era but it is sound that really made him because his is a very funny and understated humour that is still very amusing today. I first came across him in some John Ford films, most notably DOCTOR BULL, but essentially Will Rogers plays Will Rogers in all his films. And he plays Will Rogers to perfection! Will Rogers is a humourist in the tradition of Mark Twain, another great American who exemplifies all that is great and inspiring in the American national character. Will Rogers has the same perceptive wit and love of humanity that Mark Twain has. Long may they both be influential because we can still do with them in our lives in this troubled and cynical age we live in. As well as Will Rogers, you will find great character actors in all his films. Well worth watching for their humour and insight into the human condition. These films may be 80 years old but they still speak to us volumes today.",1458432000,4,1059,4.435897435897436
