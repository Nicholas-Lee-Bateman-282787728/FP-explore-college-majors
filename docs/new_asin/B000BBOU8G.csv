8413671,2,B000BBOU8G,"Pretty good movie.  Kinda seems a little thrown together and choppy.  I wish it had more race footage and insight into the sport.  I feel like it was trying to sell me the whole time and never really followed through.  If you are a big fan of supermoto and are very knowledgable of the sport, than this is probably not for you.  If you are new to it and don't really know much, you may like it.  It does have some really good rider interviews, though.",1220227200,2,451,4.186046511627907
