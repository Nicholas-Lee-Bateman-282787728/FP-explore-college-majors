7984697,4,B00008J7OY,"The main part of this DVD is a pretty cheesy tourism piece about what there is to do and see down the Oregon Coast.  You can tell it was shot prior to high definition digital video and has a very early 80s-90s feel to it.  Much of the video footage does come from this period.  ""The Oregon Coast"" does a decent job of introducing viewers to the coastline, although I would argue they spend too much time on those attractions that sponsored them (ex. the Tillamook Cheese Factory) and do not even mention some very important attractions, like the absolutely beautiful Heceta Head Lighthouse.  The main portion of the DVD also has a VERY RUSHED feel.  Some beautiful footage is shown, but typically the screen quickly changes and the narrator doesn't stop talking, driving the viewer to the next point of focus.  The first time I watched the DVD, I was disappointed after viewing this main part.

However, after the main program there appears to be a supplemental piece that was recently digitally shot and added to the older video.  The title of it is a ""Coastal Mediation"" and it makes the DVD worth the price.  It is clearly produced by more modern high definition digital cameras and features beautiful scenes from the coast without any music or narration (just the sounds of the waves and sea gulls).  It must have been added when they updated the DVD in 2005 from the original release date of 1994.  I do wish this mediation was longer, it is about 7 minuets long, but it is the only thing that makes the DVD worth the price.  I would have rather had 43 more minutes of this type of program than the 50 minutes that the main part of the DVD provides.

The footage in the meditation is spectacular, but it is up to you if it is worth the $$$ for 7 minutes of footage and a bad 1980s tourism video.",1340409600,,1800,4.451219512195122

7984699,5,B00008J7OY,"It all starts at the upper most point on the Oregon Coast in Astoria.  From there it goes down the coast visiting cities and towns.  Historic and scenic spots including lighthouses are featured.  The Oregon Coast is so beautiful. Some of the sunsets are remarkable.
I thought the visits to the state parks and many interpretive centers added to the program. It even did a nice job covering the Oregon Coast Aquarium.  The jelly fish were great.  Watching them to music was like a ballet. It was well done. Narration, script and music were all executed well. The DVD menu was great for jumping around too.",1082505600,11,604,4.660377358490566
