Watching Klondike and Snow survive after a very scary first few months, and then romp and play as young adult bears, is uplifting! I never get tired of it. Although it was made in 1994, the story is timeless. I converted the VCR to DVD, and then made copies -- I gave as gifts with Polar Bear cookies hand-painted by my son-in-law the chef. They were a hit. I heartily recommend this sweet story.",1415318400,,446,4.385542168674699
8175519,5,B000N7MJOU,I have to convert this VHS to DVD. I saw Klondike & Snow several years ago and had been hunting for like forever and I finally found through Amozon. Children would really love this tale.,1406851200,,186,4.3428571428571425
8175520,5,B000N7MJOU,I ordered this on Friday afternoon and received it the following Wednesday. The video of Klondike and Snow is amazing.  My pre-kindergarten class and I were introduced to Klondike and Snow in the book Polar Bear Math.  We were so inspired by their story that when I came home that day I googled them and found that a video documenting their first year of life was available and the price was reasonable!  It has been exciting to see live footage of these amazing creatures.,1327536000,,473,4.607142857142857
8175521,5,B000N7MJOU,"Have seen this program numerous times and can assure you that this will literally grab your heartstrings! It is truly a love story: the first being human to animal(s), then animals(s) reciprocating that love. You will laugh often and hard at the romping between Klondike and Snow.  You will immediately fall in love with them; your heart will be captured.  The laughter, however, may (and probably will) turn to tears as the bears mature and are ready to leave the ""nest""; you will be able to relate to the sad, empty feeling of the bears'  keepers when the time comes to say good-bye.  This is a love story not to be missed!",1194652800,4,625,4.553571428571429
