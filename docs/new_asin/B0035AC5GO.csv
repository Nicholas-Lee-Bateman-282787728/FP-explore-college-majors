4070065,5,B0035AC5GO,"Hey, I like these films. Blood, sexy girls and a serious story line leave me feeling like I got my money's worth.

Actually some pretty good talent for a change. Scenes shot nicely.

So pop the corn and load your horn, dig in and enjoy some ""horror"".",1273017600,2,250,4.297872340425532
8388781,2,B0035AC5GO,"Released to video in 2010, ""Vampegeddon"" is raunchy exploitation trash about vampires and youths in the Arizona desert, including a lesbo vamp. If your dark side thinks that makes it worth seeing, think again. The non-special effects are limited to monster make-up that makes the vampires look like Uncle Fester. It comes across as a student film and should've never been released to video -- yes, the filmmaking is THAT bad. The only positives are one or two curvy girls and a great underground metal soundtrack by Glendale, Arizona's Corvus (not to be confused with Germany's Corvus Corax). Corvus is an extremely talented band that successfully mixes styles. They're outstanding. At least the creators did something right.

The ""film"" was shot in Arizona and runs (mercifully) 76 minutes.

GRADE: D- (but the soundtrack by Corvus rates a solid A)",1431907200,,849,5.100719424460432
8388782,2,B0035AC5GO,"Acting?  Horrible.  Make-up?  You can see it rubbing off of the actors!  The women were pretty, and we got nude scenes from each of them.  The only reason I bought this stink-fest was because it was on sale for $3.70 and I wanted to add it to my collection of cringe-worthy movies that my friends and I can make fun of at parties.",1370476800,,330,4.174603174603175
8388783,3,B0035AC5GO,I watched this movie on Netflix. The storyline was ok I guess. The gore really sucked though. The only good things about this movie were the boobs (especially Melissa's) and the Corvus music that played during the vampire lesbian scene and during the credits.,1338768000,,259,4.909090909090909
8388784,1,B0035AC5GO,"I have seen the face of Satan, and he is a really, really bad vampire Z-movie.

Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating. A little. But in all honesty, ""Vampegeddon"" is one of the worst vampire movies ever inflicted on horror fans -- and it has a lot of competition. The plot is goofy, boobs and bad fake blood are everywhere, the annoying characters don't die fast enough, and the acting is worse than that of most first grade plays.

A whiny chubby lesbian goth girl named Melissa apparently wants to summon dark forces so she can... move to a different town. Yeah. So after she gets a very skinny grimoire at a garage sale, she and her friends Mona (who is compensating for her tiny brain with huge pigtails) and Liz (plus two boys who don't really have a reason to be there) go out into the desert to summon demons.

Instead, they summon a goofy-looking vampire named Giovanni and his sidekick (I kid you not) Igor. Giovanni decides to turn Melissa into his undead bride, which will (for some reason) allow him to raise all the vampires in the world. Fortunately, Liz stumbles across the ghost of the vampire-hunter who killed Giovanni, and their battle starts all over again.

""Vampegeddon"" has a smaller budget than most picnics, and was directed and acted by a bunch of total noobs. So unsurprisingly, it is a HOT MESS -- a student film of mediocre quality that somehow ended up being put out on DVD. I will say this for it, though: it is rarely boring, and makes for delightful MST3K snarking.

So what is bad about it? Just check ""all of the above,"" because there isn't anything that ISN'T bad about it. The direction is pretty much on par with a first-year film student who is still figuring out which end of the camera you're supposed to aim at the actors, with grainy confusing cinematography and dubbed-over sound. The vampires are less frightening than Edward Cullen, with their Uncle Fester makeup and big flappy clothes.

What's more, the plot is a DISASTER, a volcanic eruption of oozing ineptitude. Random things happen (the garage sale), random people wander in and out of the story, including two stoners who follow the goths just to make trouble, and the mind-numbing idiocy of the dialogue is unintentionally hilarious (""They're ****ing maniacs!"" ... ""And lesbians too!"").

You may have noticed that I haven't named any of the actors. This is because they're all noobs, and they do a rotten job with the profoundly obnoxious characters -- affected, silly and wooden. I will credit the actress who plays Liz, mainly because she is actually a tolerable actress. But all the rest are really bad, particularly the hilariously bad Giovanni and the annoying Igor. As for Melissa, Idiot Bride of the Vampire, she got on my nerves in her very first scene.

Anyone looking for a decent vampire movie should run far, far away from ""Vampegeddon"" -- it's a steaming, stinking, oozing pile of ineptitude. And boobs.",1295049600,,2912,4.741106719367589
8388785,1,B0035AC5GO,"First and foremost, lets address the two major issues with this ""film"".
#1. On the back cover, in a little tiny box at the bottom, the ratings disclaimer says ""This movie is specifically designed to be viewed by adults"" due to ""graphic violence"" and ""explicit sexual activity"". Ok, we're seemingly off to a good start. The cover features three moderately attractive chicks trying their best to look spooky and alluring. Oh, and some douche in the worst make-up I've ever seen, even by super-low budget indie standards.
 Lets address the ""graphic violence"". The visual effects would've been better if they'd been done by a retarded 1st-grader who just got his first Fisher-Price camcorder. Again, even going by B-movie standards, the gore factor blew. HARD.
 Now, on to the ""explicit sexual activity"". There is none, unless you're using an MPAA ratings scale from 1942. The snaggle-toothed blonde chick gets topless once, the short-haired heroine gets topless once, and the chubby depressed girl gets topless a couple of times, and there's four vamp chicks that have nothing to do with anything that show skin for like, 30 seconds. That's it. NO sex, not even in the softcore, ""Cinemax"" sense of the word.
 The editing is horrible, there is no coherent plot, and the dialogue, costumes , and characters are utterly retarded.
 All in all, this movie is less fun than a chainsaw enema. I bought it on clearance for just a dollar, and I still feel cheated. On the other hand, it still beats the hell out of watching ""Twilight"".",1282953600,13,1523,4.891472868217054
8388786,4,B0035AC5GO,"I had no idea what this movie would be like, my roomate suggested it because im a sucker for vampires, i got together w/some freinds and we watched this movie, it was awesome we had a great time being entertained, Movie starts of with a girl who wants to leave the small town she hates living in, she decides to conjure up some ancient vampires (HAMMER STYLE) And the party begins, i am not very good at explaining movies but , the vampires are bitchin , the chicks are sexy and kick ass, and the gore was good. overall this is a fun flick i reccomend to anyone who love vampires like me.",1276905600,3,588,4.212389380530974
8388787,1,B0035AC5GO,"Here's the straight dope about Vampegeddon:

It was shot for less than $2000 by a bunch of film school kids, based on a throwaway script (literally; the writer was throwing away a bunch of old scripts he wrote and offered them up to anyone who wanted to shoot them before putting them in the shredder), with inexperienced actors (some of whom were cast literally the day before production began, if not the day of), and helmed by a first-time director, who to my knowledge had never so much as directed a 5-minute short, and sure as anything didn't direct this film either, preferring instead to stand on the sidelines while other people on the crew and even cast members did his job for him.

As the budget was so head-spinningly low, almost no one on set was paid a dime (the production could barely even afford to feed us, and more than once a crew or cast member wound up buying food for everyone on set, out of sympathy or necessity), and as far as I know, no one received any kind of back-end compensation, either.  Although many of the cast and crew certainly deserved it, after countless hours of work and investments of time, equipment and skill.  And yes, despite the final quality of the film, many of the people involved in making it (cast and crew both) are quite talented.

Speaking of quality, much of the problems mentioned in other reviews, like graininess, color problems, and sound, are due to a couple of factors.  Mainly that we were short on equipment.  90% of this movie was shot out in the middle of the desert, in the middle of the night, and the whole thing was lit with basically 2 lights and a couple bounces.  So yeah, the lighting usually sucked, and as a result the image quality usually sucked (cameras pretty much just film blackness without proper lighting).  Oh and since there's no power grid out in the desert, they had to use a giant trailer generator to power these lights, so there goes all the production sound (generators are loud, in case you were wondering).  And whoever did film editing like color correction and post-production sound like dialogue and sound effects probably wasn't paid anything either, just like the actors who had to come back in and dub all their lines after they'd already decided this film wasn't worth their time.  You can really tell at least a couple of the actors seem downright tortured by having to sit there and relive the film again.

Basically most people involved with this film seemed to give up after about a week of freezing our butts off in the desert for 16 hours a day and living on 3-4 hours of sleep for zero pay.  Which is why you've got a lot of shoddy makeup, bad camera work, and poor performances from actors.  Yeah, I've worked on movies with worse schedules, in harsher environments, but at least I had a paycheck to justify the torture of going through with it all.  ""Suffering for your art"" only works if that art has some redeeming quality, like being amazingly great or putting food on your table.  Vampegeddon did neither.

So really the bottom line is that this movie was a film school project and nothing more.  I'm sure everyone involved learned a lot (mostly about how NOT to make a movie), but frankly it never should have been released, and the fact it was really speaks to the greed and lack of self-respect of the people who released it, that they were willing to put such a flaming turd out in to the world with their company's name on it, rather than cut their losses and let a couple grand go down the toilet.  And I feel kind of bad for the cast and crew who have their names on it as well, myself included.  I see at least one or two people decided to use stage names.  Good call.

The saddest part is, considering how low the budget was these guys have probably already made back their money, and a profit too.  Yet 99% of the people who put their blood and sweat in to this film will never see a penny.

And in closing I'd just like to say to everyone, please don't think that I'm bashing or blaming anyone in particular for the failing of this film (except the production company who released it, of course, but they're more to blame for stealing money from the consumers by selling a worthless product than for any actual issues with the film), rather note that all of us were victims of circumstance.  As film students, we all just wanted to make a film.  We just had the bad luck to get tied in with one that was doomed to fail from the start.  With a couple script revisions, a MUCH larger budget, more and better equipment, a MUCH better production schedule and more experienced actors and crew, this could actually have been a pretty fun B movie.  But as it is.... don't buy this movie.  Seriously.",1275523200,11,4719,4.480140186915888
8388788,1,B0035AC5GO,"3 reviews.  1, 3 & 5 stars.  I love B-movies, I have over 500 of them.  This movie sucked.  MST3K wouldn't have shown this movie.  Whoever did audio needs to be shot.  Most of the time, the voices don't match the lips.  As in they had to overdub everything & the actors couldn't match up their original performance.  Like watching Ashlee Simpson on SNL.  Very grainy.  Everyone looks to be in the late 30's instead of early college age.  Too many tats for my liking on the actors.  Make-up was horrible.  Acting was even worse.  This doesn't deserve 1 star, but I had to give it something.  PLEASE DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS unless you're buying my copy.",1275177600,2,650,4.435897435897436

8388790,1,B0035AC5GO,"First note is that the make-up of the vamps is not done properly. I'm not complaining about the fact that they all look like Uncle Fester from the Addam's Family, but that each vampire has patches on their head from where the make-up isn't properly put on. This is probably because lead make-up artist Liana Hubbard, is also one of the starring vampire women herself, as well as taking up a third role, in the costuming department!

That's just a minor point. The major one is the plot. Three goth girls and two boys go out into the desert to accidentaly release a long-dead vampire.

The vampire's there because of the stupid plot-point that following the production of Bram Stoker's Dracula, lots of vampires of Europe migrated to America to escape the attention.

So, the lead vampire is killed. But comes back to life. Oddly enough the vampire killer's soul posesses one of the three women, in an effort to re-kill the vampire.

The other two women pose a problem too, in the plot. One, soon to be vampire woman #1 has erotic dreams of the vampire and this seems to poesses her. She kisses soon to be vampire woman #2 who then shares the same vampire dream. Suddenly they both become vampires.

The reincarnated vampire killer poessing woman #3 frees them of this poesession and the vampire has to try to take over them again.

He's after woman #1 again. Woman #2 goes back to the car and sits on the hood with a guy as just yards awary there's a vampire running around after some of them. They just sit there talking.

It got worse. Somehow woman #2 becomes a vampire again, or was never unposesed and she hides in the boot of the car so in the end when the other two women drive off she opens the boot and glares at the camera as if to say ""Ha ha! You missed one vampire!""

Into this are four other vampire women, all topless, raven-haired women who seem to be able to appear in daylight, and have very little to do with the over-all story.",1274054400,7,1946,4.431372549019608
