The episode starts at a science lab. A British scientist explained to Brianna that the lab developed a particle accelerator which is essentially a large camera that explores the particles in the universe. I was totally dumbfounded

She later visited the Charlie Chaplin Museum. That wasn't my cup of tea, but if you're a fan of him then I'm sure you'd enjoy that

She took a tram over the Swiss Alps. The views were breathtaking. She also went on a hike through the Alps.

There was another segment where she participated in a play about the life of William Tell, the famous magician who shot an apple on someone's head. This segment wasn't that interesting

She stopped by the Einstein Museum. The curator explained how he developed his theory of relativity. He also said that many modern devices used today are based on Einstein's research

Brianna interviewed a Swiss soldier. He showed her some of the weapons soldiers carry. She later went to an abandoned fortress full of various weapons, most of which were still operational

Later, she took a high speed train called the Glacier Express through the scenic countryside. Since I'm a train buff, I enjoyed this segment

Towards the end of the episode, she visited Zurich. It was full of upscale shops and restaurants

Some segments were boring, others were very exciting. This episode was a 3.5, but since Brianna is so cute, I'll add an extra 0.5",1448236800,,1628,4.765124555160142

8674351,1,B00MRK76AS,"Since amazon did not have this new DVD on Switzerland in stock, I ordered the DVD on the Globe Trekker Pilot Films website.
I have been to Switzerland several times. I have liked many of the Globe Trekker DVDs. Especially the DVDs hosted by Ian Wright.
I really wanted to like the DVD on Switzerland. I received the DVD in the mail yesterday. And watched it today.
This DVD on Switzerland was a disappointment. And it was expensive.
I think they could have chosen much better places in Switzerland to cover in the DVD than the places they chose.
Over all, the host for this DVD just could not compare to the Globe Trekker DVDs hosted by Ian Wright.
This DVD just gave across as goofy and childish. Very much a disappointment.",1413590400,,725,4.5
