4526467,5,B0051UERBW,"I also ordered the Skilled Photographer and watched it last month.  As a result of watching that DVD I had to order the Ultimate Photographer.  I enjoyed and more importantly, learned from both of these DVDs.  They are easy to understand and gave me just the right information to get me jumped started into my photography again.  New ideas, new methods, the white balance cards work great, the lighting lessons clarified multi-flash techniques and the difference between flash solutions, in studio and out.  I'll probably be watching these many times before I absorb everything.  Thanks.",1311206400,,587,5.126315789473685
4526468,5,B0051UERBW,"Wish I could afford more of this artist work, but no artist is noted so I cant look up their work to learn form .",1356307200,,113,3.56
4526469,5,B0051UERBW,I am a novice to photography and hence thought I would benefit from Manny's lectures. I was not disappointed. All the DVD sets are great and take you through the concepts of photography step-by-step and you are hungry for more after each lesson until the Ultimate Photographer lays out the professional photo studio. I might never go there but even lay photographers will benefit from detailed understanding of lighting and composition and how to control them with the means at your disposal.,1337212800,,492,5.012195121951219
4526470,5,B0051UERBW,"From  a technical,creative, and aesthetic perspective, this is a superb course in the major aspects of photography-light, both indoors and outdoors, composition, lens choice, perspective, depth of field. I enormously enjoyed it and learned much.",1335744000,,245,6.0
4526471,5,B0051UERBW,"Perfect sequel to the Skilled Photographer. By the time you get done watching the DVD's and get to shooting, you should be able to turn out some great stuff. Manny gives you all the tricks and knowledge to become a good photographer. The rest is up to you.
By Manfred Saul.
I give this a 5 star Rating",1331683200,,301,4.206896551724138
4526472,5,B0051UERBW,"Manny explains and demonstrates relevant concepts regarding advanced composition techniques, flash and lighting equipment options and techniques in a concise and well organized 3-DVD set. Manny's style and presentation skills make it very entertaining and easy to understand. I highly recommend this series as well as his other DVDs.",1327190400,,333,5.816326530612245
4526473,5,B0051UERBW,I have ordered the whole series of these DVDs beginning with Jump Start Your Photography and have ordered the Jump Start DVD for a friend because it is so useful.  Manny is a natural when it comes to teaching and the DVD series has been more useful than any book or other instruction I have used.  The DVDs are set up so you can actually see and understand techniques that will help you get photos right the first time. As my skills have increased my enjoyment has increased. The Ultimate Photographer builds on the first two DVDs and will undoubtedly increase my enjoyment even more as I continue to gain valuable and easily applicable information.  Thanks Manny!,1326067200,,664,4.6581196581196584
4526474,5,B0051UERBW,"This is the final set in a series of three, and a necessity for the serious photographer. I highly recommend getting the first two and working your way up, as I have done. This is when all that training starts to come together, and you start to ""feel"" your photography. His style of teaching just makes it come together, you find yourself looking at things like a photographer and are made aware of your environment in a different way. I will continue to refer back to the DVD's, and in just a short time my images have taken a 180 degree turn.",1320451200,3,544,4.3431372549019605
4526475,5,B0051UERBW,"The Ultimate Photographer is the latest addition to an excellent series of educational videos by an exceptional teacher and photographer, Emanuele (Manny) Pontoriero.  While I have encountered a number of excellent photographers over the years in seminars and courses, I have never experienced a better teacher or educational approach.  Manny has a rare talent of presenting concepts in a way that makes you realize that although you may have heard it or read it before, you reall didn't get it.  His explanations are reinforced with well chosen examples and illustrations that help you remember the concept and make it a natural instinct to apply it.  A very effective teaching technique he uses is the ""Manny Cam"".  He videos through his 35mm while he composes the shot.  You can see exactly what he is seeing as he adjusts for composition, lighting, cropping, etc.and explains the changes he is making to improve the photo or to change the mood or feeling it produces.

I recently returned from a trip to the Mediterranean with the best photos I have ever taken.  A friend and fellow photographer who has been looking at my work for years asked me only half in jest if I had photographed some calender pages!  The vast improvement in my photographic skills is a direct result of applying what I have learned from Manny and his instructional DVDs.  It is a sure thing that if you seriously view his DVDs and apply what you learn, you will experience significant improvement regardless of your equipment.  You will also have a lot of fun watching the DVDs; Manny is highly entertaining.",1319500800,3,1587,4.862453531598513
4526476,5,B0051UERBW,Thank you for such a fabulous learning tool. It was so easy to put in to practice the things that were taught and immediately improved my Photography,1318118400,3,149,4.555555555555555
4526477,5,B0051UERBW,"This is by far the best ""How To"" DVD set for the serious Photographer; the professional, semi-pro and advanced amateur alike. Manny has a clear and precise teaching style and his teaching is backed by live photo shoots where you can see him in action as he applies the techniques presented.

The Ultimate Photographer is divided into 3 main sections: Composition, Using Flash and Lighting. The main focus is lighting, and lighting is at the core of great photography. He covers the use of flash (on and off camera) for lighting, as well as, studio lighting. Manny explains the how and why of each lighting scenario in nice easy to understand details. There are couple of spots where he uses advance lighting terms prior to them being explained, make a note of the terms, hang in there, and he will clear it all up by the end of ""The Ultimate Photographer"". However, there are some basic photography concepts, rules and techniques he assumes the viewer has. If your formal photography background is weak then I would recommend you watch Manny's beginning DVD sets: ""Jump Start Your Photography"" and ""The Skilled Photographer"" where these concepts and techniques are explained in detail.

To sum it up, this latest set of DVDs from Manny's ""Get The Picture"" will have you looking at lighting all around you in a whole new dimension, as well as, how to form it and control it to the way you want your clients/viewers to see it in your photographs.

Here are some of the topics covered in ""The Ultimate Photographer""
- Viewers Eye Path
- Rules of Dynamic Symmetry
- Four Points Of Interest
- Emotional Impact of Composition
- Portable Light Kits
- Adding Flash To Existing Light
- Light Ratio and How to Control It
- 6 Core Light Patterns
- Visualizing Light Patterns

Manny has created a series of DVDs to bring you from a ""point and shoot"" picture taker to being a real pro at taking photographs. They are designed to be watched over and over. Once you have watched them all the way through, you will be able to jump right to the section you want to review and brush up on.",1311465600,3,2071,4.6043360433604335
8453305,5,B0051UERBW,I have purchased all 3 of manny's DVD photography courses and recommend them highly. He simplifies composition  and lighting in ways I have never really understood from reading photo books and taking other courses. He also has a very engaging personality and came across as someone you would like to know,1487808000,,304,4.96078431372549
8453306,2,B0051UERBW,No quite good,1469577600,,13,3.6666666666666665
8453307,5,B0051UERBW,It is useful for me to learn photography especially when I only have limited time for it. It supplements my books and practice.,1432771200,,127,4.565217391304348
8453308,5,B0051UERBW,This is the 3rd in the series.  I purchased all three and am not disappointed.  I liked the style on how the information was laid out. Each series dived a little deeper in the same topic.  I learned a lot.  I recommend all 3-DVD sets.  You will not be disappointed.,1396051200,,265,4.22
8453309,5,B0051UERBW,"I am a total novice just getting started in DSLR photography, and I wanted to shorten the learning curve a bit, so I decided to order the ""Jump start your photography"" DVD set. I can honestly say that Manny does a superb job of giving the viewer the ""how and why"" of every aspect that he covers in these DVD's. I was so impressed that I ordered the other two sets ""The Skilled Photographer"" and ""The Ultimate Photographer"" immediately after viewing the first set! I now totally understand the M settings on my camera and am already starting to capture MUCH better pictures through applying what I learned about composition and lighting. Thank you Manny for making such comprehensive and easy to understand instructional videos! I will be buying more of Manny's instructional DVD's once I have practiced and become more proficient in what I have learned so far....

NOTE: It is best to view these in the intended order to avoid getting lost or overwhelmed with what is being taught, especially if you are new to DSLR photography like me. I have watched all 3 sets and feel that Manny has shaved years off of my learning curve to becoming a skilled photographer with an understanding of how to ""get the picture"" that I am trying to capture.",1392595200,,1238,4.65296803652968
8453310,5,B0051UERBW,"Previous reviews sum up this DVD set pretty well.  I have all three sets (""Jump Start Your Photography"", ""The Skilled Photographer"" and now ""The Ultimate Photographer"") plus his DVD on Posing and Landscape.  Please view them in order as they build upon each other and come back to them many times.  I've seen a few other DVD's, but Manny is personable, well organized and shares the information as a friend who is really interested in helping you.  After he presents the material, he then goes out into the field or in his studio and uses a couple of videographers to capture how he actually achieves his results.  That coupled with his usage of Live View make you feel like you are right there looking through his viewfinder as he composes his shots.  I've read many books on photography lighting, posing and composition, but this video really brings it together in a format that is even better. I had a hands on class in studio photography which was very good, but the DVD's were even much more helpful.  In addition, Manny has personally answered a few questions I had sent him through Facebook and he genuinely shows interest in my photography.  Just having good equipment does not produce good pictures; it's all in the composition and how you use lighting. This was the best money spent for me.

I'm a retired geophysicist and now enjoy developing my skills through a local camera club.  I have never given a review before this one as I am totally sold on Manny's work.",1370044800,,1475,4.66023166023166
8453311,3,B0051UERBW,"I wanted to love this, but I could barely stay awake. The instructions are clear but the presenter is so dry and devoid of personality, it's like I'm back in high school calculus. I basically had trouble getting much out of it as a result.",1368144000,2,239,4.333333333333333
8453312,5,B0051UERBW,"I've been working for a few years on becoming a better photographer.  I've read books and tried all the techniques many, many times.  Nothing clicked until I got Manny's DVD sets.  I started with Jump Start, then moved onto The Skilled Photographer and now am watching the Ultimate Photographer and the Lanscape DVD.  He presents everything in a manner that is so easy to learn and you gain so much confidence to go out and start taking shots yourself.  I HIGHLY recommend all of his DVD's.  You will find your skill level will increase greatly!!",1359331200,,546,4.6947368421052635
8453313,5,B0051UERBW,I had considered taking a photography class at the local CC but decided to try these DVDs. I am glad I did. First rate info and tips. I am a better photographer as a result of watching them. His suggestions on composition improved my pics 100%,1359331200,,243,4.304347826086956
8453314,5,B0051UERBW,Manny is great at making Photography fun to learn.  I would recommend to anyone who is a beginner or semi-pro.  I think the best part of the DVD set is how Manny explains how people read a photo!  Very powerful and has improved my pictures.,1358035200,,240,4.288888888888889
