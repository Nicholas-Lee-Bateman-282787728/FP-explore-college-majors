8252495,4,B0013P6TL0,"A cartoon the way they're meant to be. Bravestarr goes back to the days when realistic animation mattered, and is one of the few animated programs featuring a Native American that is not terribly offensive.",1378512000,,206,4.914285714285715

8252498,5,B0013P6TL0,If you're ever interested in how Bravestarr originated then this is the movie to answer that question & a few more!,1240444800,2,115,4.523809523809524
8252499,5,B0013P6TL0,"Some Native Americans have stated that this series is not supportive of their traditions or their culture, however after watching this series I would have to say my opinion of Bravestarr is in direct opposition to that belief.  Granted not all episodes in this series rely heavily on native themes I feel like the two episodes that deal with drugs and racism set higher moral standards than most cartoons of it's time or since.  The lead character as well as the minor characters show a great deal of moral value as well as nobility.  I feel that this is one of the greatest cartoons of alltime even if it has flown under the radar.  What other cartoon have been developed around the theme of Southwest Native Americans, Old Western Ghost Towns, or Futuristic Science Fiction?  I made a purchase of the Best of Bravestarr which included a copy of this movie.  I'm glad that this movie took the time to explain some information about Bravestarrs background I just wish that the Best Of would have included two key episodes, Tex But No Hex(An episode that made a point about the need for the two opposing forces of good and evil) and Strength Of The Bear-The Power Within(An episode about coming into knowledge about the power which exists at our core and takes notice of spiritual vision quests while revealing more about Bravestarrs Origin).",1227225600,5,1341,4.733905579399142
8252500,5,B0013P6TL0,"I grew up watching this stuff. The animation was great in the 80's, better then what you might see today. Story lines are better and BraveStar was great in it's time.",1224547200,2,166,4.387096774193548
8252501,5,B0013P6TL0,"When I was a kid it remember Bravestarr on Saturday morning, but it didn't last long.  When I saw it available I had to get it for a few memories, as it turns out I wasn't disappointed at all.  The Special feature, audio commontary is just as interesting as the picture is and helps give infromation about why this show didn't last.  But first the show begins with a movie that actually was in select theaters for a very short period of time.  Shows what miscommunication can do to a production eh?  Given the time when this movie was done and the intended audience, this is an excellent film with a message.  I recommend it to anybody.",1217894400,,636,4.3931623931623935
