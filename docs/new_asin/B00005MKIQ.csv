7945567,4,B00005MKIQ,"I saw this movie in Catalan (with English subtitles).  As I am familiar with the Castillian spanish (of most Spain and Central & South America) and understood most of the Catalan, I got a much better understanding than just reading the English subtitles.  This is my kind of movie.  It did not expoit characters sexual lives (as many movies do lately), but rather brought out the feelings of the character's lives and what they were going through.  The unfullfilled life of the professor in not having had a child and his wanting to live vicariously throught the lives of the young people's lives in their predicament of an out of wedlock pregnancy.  The writer did a fine job inter-weaving the lives of the characters.  I would like to purchase this for my Catalan collection (but unfortunately the description given only says ""English"" for language).",1359244800,,852,4.881944444444445
