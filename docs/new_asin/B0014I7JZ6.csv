8255792,5,B0014I7JZ6,"If you like either Mr. William ""Count"" Basie or Oscar Peterson, or both; this is your DVD!
These jazzgiants were very close friends, Basie phoned Oscar a lot (he told me), and always forgot the timedifference between California, were Basie was living and the Toronto area in Canada, on the eastcoast, where the Petersons lived.
""Sometimes in the middle of the night he phoned me, and said: O.P. you got to listen to.......and he mentioned a player that was on a radiosation in Hollywood, not thinking, that we were deep asleep, and of course couldn't receive that radiostation on the westcoast in The States at all.
But you forgave Base, always, because he was the kindest man on earth.
Same thing during his concerts: from the moment The Count was on stage, you looked at that friendly, smiling face, and you got to love him, no matter what.
And audiences surrendered, always.""

Okay, there is Oscar the virtuoso, doing incredible things, solo, and with The Viking: Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen on this DVD.
But THE set is when both friends are on stage together, because this is LOVE.
Of course Peterson is holding back, giving Basie room for his genius: saying a lot, by playing almost nothing, using space.

Why can't people read, and listen, why tell there's another drummer around?
Because everything is clear: It's Oscar and Basie, plus NHOP, Freddie Green, guitar (the secret weapon of the Basie Band), and Butch Miles on drums. (it's on the sleeve, so why wonder?)

The showstopper for me is: ""Slow Blues in G"", look and hear how these men enjoy their company, their making music together.
See how they look over the two grands, see all these smiles, because this is what jazz is all about, the essence: A magnificent blues played by two masters, creating not the most spectacular, but boy, what a feeling, what a timing, what a joy and above all: LOVE.
Okay there is this Basie set, and Big ""Joe"" Turner, but ""Slow Blues in G"" is Van Gogh and Rembrandt.
Sit down, relax and enjoy!

8255793,5,B0014I7JZ6,"No words (at least I do not have) can fully describe the performances as captured in this DVD. Mr Oscar Peterson and Mr Count Basie, may their souls rest in peace, are among the greatest jazz artists.

In this DVD you'll find and enjoy single and joint performances by these greats. I was not disappointed by any of the tracks in this DVD and have no doubt if you appreciate some of the works done by any of them, you too will sure enjoy it. For me at least it was worth the money and most importantly the time spent watching.",1265155200,2,526,4.207920792079208

8255795,4,B0014I7JZ6,"This DVD features Oscar Peterson in one solo number and three duets with bassist Niels-Henning rsted-Pedersen, three numbers with Peterson and Basie on two pianos (accompanied by rhythm section), one blues from Joe Turner backed by a combo, and six tunes by Basie's orchestra. The DVD producers have dated the concert (probably incorrectly) as November 8, 1974, and listed musicians who played with Basie in late 1975. I've done my best to identify the musicians correctly, drawing from Chris Sheridan's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Count-Basie-A-Bio-Discography-Discographies/dp/0313249350/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Count Basie: A Bio-Discography (Discographies)</a>&nbsp;(that info follows). Note that Sheridan gives a set list dated October 28 that doesn't match this concert (and identifies Jake Hanna as the drummer for the two-piano combo): this info may simply be misreported, or perhaps it is an accurate set list for one of the other concerts from the same tour, which began in London on September 28 and criss-crossed northern Europe before ending in Prague. Basie's itinerary (given in Sheridan's appendix) says the band performed in Prague on Oct. 26, 1974. I speculate that November 8 may have been the date of TV broadcast.
  The sound is mono and pretty good, although it is hard to make out the two pianos (tracks 5-7). The color image is also in pretty good shape, although there is some distortion (waviness). The camerawork is typical for the period: the camera sits on the soloist for the most part, although there are occasional random cutaways. There's a quick fade-up at the beginning of the Big Band set -- the DVD producers may have edited out an announcer or graphic that indicates the provenance. They've superimposed an ""IJ"" logo in the upper left corner. The packaging is minimal -- they have the wrong title for the Joe Turner blues and for almost all the Big Band numbers.
  For me, this DVD is valuable for the Basie Band. On a good day, Peterson can be a monster, but often his virtuosity seems merely flashy -- he's not very rhythmically interesting in this set. The sound quality of the Basie-Peterson numbers is a bit muddy, but I did enjoy seeing Basie's expressive face (he shoots looks at Peterson that seem to say, ""you didn't just do that"" and ""how do you expect me to keep up with you"").
  Basie's 1970s band may not have the notoriety of the ""Old Testament"" or ""New Testament"" editions, but they had snap and power and made a series of great records for Pablo. This edition has solid soloists in each section. The under-appreciated Minger has a typically quirky solo on ""Mr. Softy,"" and the short-lived Davis-Forrest tenor line-up is one of Basie's best since Lester Young and Herschel Evans. (They both solo on ""Basie Power"" but they don't trade bars; ""Jumpin' at the Woodside"" didn't become a duel until around 1977, too bad for us.) Grey works the plunger on ""I Needs to Be Bee'd With,"" and Peagler takes an extended solo (solid but not exceptional) before the out-chorus of ""Cherry Point.""
  In sum: this is a poorly annotated DVD, valuable mostly because there's not a lot of available footage of Basie's 1970s band. Basie freaks rejoice! If you're interested in Oscar Peterson or Joe Turner, you can probably pass.
