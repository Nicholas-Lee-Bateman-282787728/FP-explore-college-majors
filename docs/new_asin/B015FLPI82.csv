7435547,5,B015FLPI82,"There have been many mixed reviews about the Hindi adaptation of the Malayalam film. I have not seen the original but with Mammooty in the star cast I can safely assume that the original must be very good. However Drishyam starring Ajay Devgan is pretty darn decent copy and I loved every single minute. The film may claim itself to be an original story but it has been inspired by the Devotion of Suspect X by Keigo Hakashino.
Ajay Devgan is Vijay who lives in Goa with his family. He runs a small cable business and is obsessed with films but things take an ugly turn when his daughter goes to a nature camp and she meets Sam, the son of the Inspector General Meera Deshmukh ( Tabu). To say the least Sam is a wicked boy and an unfortunate accident causes Vijays family to get embroiled in a very tragic incident.  The cops try their best to implicate them,
The story of a family trying to defend their turf  and beat the police on their term makes for some very good entertainment. This family thriller is intentionally slow paced at the beginning when the plot focuses more in the family dynamics and there are some forced comedy sequences. Ajay Devgan and Sriya Saran have no chemistry together and in some places their romance looks forced but the director builds the momentum through many story elements that become important as the movie progresses.
There is minimal action and in some cases Ajay Devgan gets beaten up- I was half expecting him to go postal on his attackers.  The acting and the storyline does the trick in the film, Ajay Devgan and Tabu are great, so is Rajat Kapoor who plays the hapless dad and husband of the sometimes evil cop Tabu. The character of Ajay has been well written and Devgan fits the role.  These two alone make up for the somewhat unevenly paced first half. But Drishyam is a must watch - because the story is clever and engaging.  Released on 31st July 2015",1445299200,5,1902,4.501449275362319

8733392,4,B015FLPI82,Wow! I originally saw this in the theater. Ajay and Tabu are not my favorite Bollywood actors by a long shot so I wasn't real excited to watch this. Boy was I wrong. After the first 30 minutes or so setting up the story I was on the edge of my seat until the end. What a fantastic and brilliantly written story! This is what all crime thrillers should strive to be!,1458777600,3,365,4.083333333333333

8733397,5,B015FLPI82,"After the execrable flop of Action Jackson Ajay Devgn returns to the screen with a memorable well acted, well scripted thriller.  It is not for the faint-hearted.  The only weak link is Tabu's overacted performance as the cruel police chief  cum tender mother of her only son (the killed ultra-scoundrel of a teenager).  To see Tabu at her best watch the towering Haider, where she plays the mother to Shahid Kapoor's Hamlet.  A powerful movie laying bare India's bleeding social wounds.",1449014400,4,487,4.962962962962963
