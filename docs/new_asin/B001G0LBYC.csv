8303457,4,B001G0LBYC,"Larry's Christmas Special starts out with Larry in a bar, swiping drinks from midgets dressed like Santa's elves. He realizes that he has a Christmas show to do and decides to call upon some big time star power to co-host the show. He starts out by calling none other than Jay Leno himself. Jay makes up an excuse to beg out on Larry, (because he's Larry) and our friendly neighborhood Cable Guy moves slowly down the celebrity A-list, through the B, C and D lists. Even his own mother won't appear on his show, because, she says, she's now Jewish. Finally Tony Orlando calls Larry looking for work and Larry happily accepts him.

  It's a funny way to start the show and reaffirms Larry's status as an underdog and perhaps a bit of an outcast. But that's part of his appeal.

  Larry does his monologue and there are plenty of funny skits, including a send up of Deal or No Deal called Squeal or No Squeal, where contestants play to win a pig, although other prizes include stretchy-wasted elastic ""eatin pants"", a screen door in pristine condition and an uncracked toilet tank lid.

  A neighborhood choir sings ""redneck"" parodies of old Christmas standards as well as musical numbers by the likes of Blake Shelton and Montgomery Gentry. Ventriloquist Terry Fator does a funny bit and Fred Willard is all over this show like a humorous, red swollen rash (he's his usual funny self). Other stars showing up to wish Larry a Merry Christmas include Toby Keith, Jeff Foxworthy, Joey Fatone, Victoria Jackson, Lewis Black, Terry Bradshaw, Charlie Callas, Jennifer Aspen, Angela Little, and Nadine Velazquez from ""My Name is Earl"" as Santa's sexiest elf.

  I really liked this show. It reminded me of the old Christmas shows that Bob Hope and Johnny Cash used to put on for the holidays. Those guys did a little something extra, a little something special to celebrate the season. They put in some effort and did it up right and Larry does too. And everyone on the old shows seemed to really enjoy themselves, just like they do here. That's something you don't see on too much of today's' savvy, some would say jaded and world-weary TV; people actually just having a good time without snarkiness or irony. Of all the entertainers out there today Larry the Cable Guy has stepped up to fill the Santa boots of the entertainers of the past, and I think he does a great job of...you know I'm gonna say it....GETTIN' HER DONE!!!",1227484800,,2420,4.668235294117647
