We need more women like Ms. Victoria, who can start over life at 50 years old with or without a man, independent, ambitious and plenty of love to give.  Hooray, to all independent women!!!",1297382400,,423,4.6891891891891895
3771178,3,B001QUXNPW,"I can't rate this abridgment since I never saw it (so I put a 3 stars in the middle, because I was forced by this system).  I saw the entire Victoria. It is not a soap opera.  Soap Operas never end.  It is a Spanish language telenovela, which is a long series of shows put out on most week days at the same time, in this case on Telemundo. Telenovelas last generally 6 months to a year and have an ending, for crying out loud.

This was an American remake of (La) Mirada de Mujer (Mexican telenovela), which was a remake of Seora Isabel (Colombian telenovela). As broadcast by Telemundo, the program had captions both in Spanish & in English (CC 1 & CC 3).  It is possible to get the whole telenovela on DVD's by searching the internet.

I found it highly entertaining, at least during about the first 2/3rds.

The story is about a middle aged woman who is deserted by her husband for a younger woman.  Then Victoria becomes enamored of a young man herself. Her children have delightful quarrels & misbehaviors.  Her husband & mother are jerks that you will enjoy despising.

In fact i wrote plot summaries for Victoria which are posted at Telenovela-World.com, forum Victoria.",1273276800,4,1177,4.535545023696683

3771180,3,B001QUXNPW,I loved the soap I saw the version on tv and I feel that there parts that should have been included on the soap and somethings that could have been edited they were not interesting.  But as we all know we can't have it all.,1260316800,3,223,3.9555555555555557
3771181,3,B001QUXNPW,"I was so excited to see this product available for sale since i missed the ending when it was aired on television. Although you at Amazon can do absolutely nothing about my complaint, i am posting it anyway.  Who  ever does the editing for these spanish soaps, are missing the point of why one would want to buy them. We want to relive the experience of a story we have already seen and can't get enough of it or simply because we like to see it again or even see it for the first time. The editing they do is awful. The story line makes no sense and then some of the good stuff they edit it out. I rather pay more for the product and get more of the true product. So, Amazon thanks for offering this opportunity to see these stories again. But to the Editors, or producers or who ever is in charge of putting these DVD's on the market. you are doing a terrible job. Don't even bother.",1406592000,4,885,4.1395348837209305

3771184,2,B001QUXNPW,I bough this for my mom and she told me that the episodes were not complete not only that but one of the dvds was in bad condition,1348531200,,130,3.6785714285714284
3771185,4,B001QUXNPW,"Well, I bought this DVD even if I knew it didn't have English subtitles!! I thought that I would be able to make out one or two things, but BOY, was I wrong!!! The spanish spoken in here flows like a waterfall, but I will soldier on to the finish. My main interest was the storyline, older woman and younger man, and I want to see how that plays out!!

As for the DVD itself, it is a quality package, security sealed. It contains 4 double sided DVD's. I haven't gotten to the end (the spanish is tooooo much!!), but so far, so good.

My only compaint is the subtitles. The production company should put in subtitles, for the sake of non-Spanish speakers, and for those who are deaf!! Surely!! Is that too much to ask????",1321401600,3,720,4.286764705882353

3771187,2,B001QUXNPW,"This is not what I expected.  All the scenes that I liked from the ""Telenovela Victoria"" were deleted.  What made ""Victoria"" a great novela for me was Jeronimo's way of winning Victoria's heart and THAT was missing from this DVD.  You probably will like it if you did not see it on TV.",1309824000,,285,4.339622641509434

3771189,1,B001QUXNPW,"Esta novela me gusto mucho, porque era una historia, en la que no hubo villanos solo situaciones en las que personas tienen que enfrentar. Una mujer abandonada por su esposo por otra y encuentra una 2da oportunidad en un joven 16 anos menor que ella.

La edicion en esta novela fue tan horrible, quien edito esta telenovela realmente no sabia lo que estaba haciendo. No s como telemundo puede vender algo de tan baja calidad.  En esta telenovela tantos conflictos fueron editados, como por ejemplo el conflicto de Jeronimo y su hijo que no acepta a Victoria, el conflicto del la compaera de trabajo de Jeronimo que le desarrolla una atraccin fatal por l. Tambin la discusin entre la otra y Victoria, el cual es un momento climtico en la novela y, en fin,  los problemas  de la hija mayor de Victoria. Este DVD fue tan mal editado que no recomendara que lo compraran.",1307232000,,866,4.603896103896104
3771190,3,B001QUXNPW,"First, I love the show, and I usually do not love (or even like) telenovelas. But I've liked this one since it first ran on Telemundo a few years ago, and I agree with pretty much all the good things the other positive reviewers have said.

However... as some other reviewers have also said, this version is wayyyyyy heavily edited. It moves super fast due to the editing, and I'm not sure I like it quite so much. They edited out a lot (A LOT!) of developmental elements of the storyline and went straight to the bullet points, which makes it a little less interesting than it would otherwise be. But don't get me wrong; it's not like one long trailer. It has some development, just not nearly as much as the TV version. Example of how heavy the editing is; there is not one single full episode in the collection.

Oh, and that brings up another point: the DVDs run as one continuous ""movie"" of the whole novela. It is not divided into episodes. I'm not saying that's good or bad; it's just an FYI if you're considering buying it.

I haven't had any problems with the quality or anything like that, and the main story points are all there. But just be aware that it is heavily edited if you are buying it because you loved the show on TV.

Would I recommend it to someone who never saw the TV version? Yes!
To someone who loves the TV version? Eh... mas o menos. No dira que est MAL, pero... es bastante diferente.

Oh, and if you get this for educational purposes or to share with non-Spanish speakers, be aware that there are no subtitle options. :)",1300579200,13,1552,4.356401384083045
8336482,2,B001QUXNPW,Ok so here it goes. If it weren't for the fact that i have seen this novela already..(its one of my favs) i would be soo ridiculously lost. The editing is so awful!!! Missing MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR important scenes. But like i said thank goodness i have already seen it. So thats my take.,1523750400,,283,4.2592592592592595
8336483,2,B001QUXNPW,Not all the episodes and no English captions :( amazing show though,1499731200,,67,4.666666666666667

8336486,4,B001QUXNPW,"Not as good as the original airing on TV but it the editing will do. Some important scenes are missing and that changes the impact of other scenes but it gets the point across. Still a lovely love story of redemption, never giving up on your dreams and true love does conquer all.",1463529600,,280,4.30188679245283
