I like the show I didn't know he starred in another show before doing his best show of all time (The Cosby Show). Since I wasn't around then when The Bill Cosby Show was aired. I happen to stumble across it on amazon when looking for another show. I thought this show was very good as well, and can't wait to order the final season of The Bill Cosby Show and see how Chet is and what else he gets into; Ohh Lawd, lol.",1376265600,,492,3.93

Video quality is very good.",1363910400,,122,4.857142857142857
2738529,5,B000MQ4WN8,"How could anyone put down this dusty show from the past? It is really good. Way better then the one with him as the head of the household. He is a teacher at school. He does his best to be a good guy and succeeds with humor. Should have been a regular rerun on TV instead of the other boring show he was so successful on. Does anyone remember I SPY? Bill did some really funny comedy albums which you may not remember, but I do. Love to you Bill Cosby! Thank you for your talent.",1363564800,2,479,4.0
2738530,1,B000MQ4WN8,If you are looking for The Bill Cosby Show Season 2 which aired during 1970-1971 don't put this item in your cart.  The picture above is correct for but the description is for The Cosby Show that ran in the 80's.  Once in your cart you will have the 80's show.,1360454400,4,260,4.078431372549019
2738531,5,B000MQ4WN8,Very please with the set. Glad to have both volumes 1 and 2. I have been looking for this set for some time.  Highly recommend!!,1329696000,5,128,4.12
2738532,5,B000MQ4WN8,"I waited five years to get season two. When season one arrived back in 2006, I watched every episode through the week and enjoyed all of them. The series is filmed beautifully and the prints are exceptional. SHOUT has done a remarkable job on this series and the extras with Bill are very informative. The guest stars are amazing and the plots always unique. I like the idea of a sitcom with no laugh track. Bill was wise to film it that way. It is refreshing to watch a show like this being released by a reliable company such as SHOUT.
Add both to your collection today.
Now if only SHOUT would release My World And Welcome To It (1969) William Windom and  The Girl With Something Extra (1973) Sally Field, John Davidson, William Windom, my life would be complete!",1305244800,7,766,4.4714285714285715

8170714,5,B000MQ4WN8,"It's hard to find anything better than this series. No laugh track is one of the best things about this. I was a bit put off when I watched it the first time, but my opinion of it soared with the second viewing.",1413676800,,211,3.9302325581395348

8170716,5,B000MQ4WN8,Definitely one of the best shows to illustrate with good humor the problems and successes that people of all races encounter.  American culture lost a lot when this show ended.,1386460800,,176,4.866666666666666
8170717,5,B000MQ4WN8,This is a must own show if you love Bill Cosby the only downside is he only had two seasons.  This season has Don Notts starring in one wild comedy show that is a must see.,1379030400,,172,3.7777777777777777
