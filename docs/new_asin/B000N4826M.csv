8174690,4,B000N4826M,"I dug this one up out of a box that was laying around post move. This VHS serves as a great refresher for all things WWF that took place from 1970 to 1986, showing a majority of the title changes, big angles, and matches that made those years memorable. Most of the matches and finishes have already shown up on other Coliseum Videos prior to this, but the video is well organized and serves its purpose. It would be great for a younger fan who is curious to see some of the WWF as it was developing into a media powerhouse.

That being said, this tape wouldn't be recommended to the hardcore fans who are familiar with the company's history. Most of the title changes on this tape have made their way to WWE DVD releases and a few of the angles have as well. The tape itself is only one hour in length, mostly due to VHS limitations at the time of its release.

Luckily, this is one of the easier to come by Coliseum Videos and shouldn't cost you an arm and a leg to find. The tough part is finding one with the clamshell fully intact. I give it four out of five stars for its organization and depth, but detract for it lacking rare moments.",1252281600,,1142,4.210045662100456
