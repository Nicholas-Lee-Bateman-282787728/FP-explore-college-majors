2493370,4,B000E5N6MK,"I just watched the DVD.  The main program is great.  It has highlights and chronicles the 2005 campaign with some behind the scenes footage and all that.  Great music, and a nice program.

The bonus features are somewhat lacking.  I couldn't care less about the halftime show, and I don't think anyone is going to buy this because of that.  I'd rather have had the team intros or something.  The SB40 promos?  Eh...  Media is ok as well.  The Game of the Week for the Colts game is good.

My only major complaint is in the product description on this website.  There is no pre-post game analysis, unless you count them saying that Pittsburgh won.  And there is also no ""cut-down"" version of the Super Bowl.  You get the highlights in with the main program.  So the description is very misleading.  But still a worthy purchase, especially for the price.  Steeler fans will enjoy it.",1141689600,7,881,4.580645161290323

2493454,5,B000E5N6MK,"NFL films releases two Great DVDS for every winner - 1st - The Championship DVD with highlight footage of every single game through the postseason to the Superbowl. Its a must have for every fan of the team, its NOT the full broadcasts, thats something else, this is just a 1 hr or so condensed feel good version when you don't have the the time for 2 hour games. Especially good since it comes out only a month or two after the victory. Its the DVD you watch after your team has been eliminated in the following years. Than comes ""America's Game"" in the summer before the season begins. No matter who wins, I always watch both of these releases, and if I liked a team's season enough, I own these DVDs.
  That said, THIS one, is just amazing. Im not even a Steelers fan, IM a Giant fan, but the story of the 2005 Steelers is compelling. Its a season full of smash mouth highlights, its Jerome Bettis blasting through the NFC's top defense that year, the Chicago Bears, at the end of the season when EVERY game was a must win. Its a #6 seed Wildcard sneaking in and going all the way. Defeating their division champs on the road, on the way, TWICE....the second time in the playoffs...by knocking their QB OUT of the game.
  And its all NFL Films cameras, close up slow motion of The Bus flattening Brian Urlacher at the goal line for the game clinching Touchdown. In the Snow. In Pittsburg. With Those hall of fame quality linebackers like James Farrier , Joey Porter all miked up swarming all over the field and on the sidelines going ""Toot ! Toot! Ride the Bus!!"" This isn't what you'll see with the full broadcasts, which is why if your a die hard fan, you need BOTH. But for the casual fan of the Steelers, or even a non fan of the team like myself who just got caught up in cheering for that team at that moment, this is what you need. I may purchase the broadcasts too, its an anachronism now, a smash mouth team going all the way.",1356480000,,1938,4.301369863013699
2493475,1,B000E5N6MK,"I am very disappointed in the DVDs I purchased. 15 different supposed super bowl collection series DVDs. A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD. Very disappointed.

I also like that a lot of time was spent on the Colts playoff game that was the highlight of the Steelers season. The fact that they didn't spend more than 17 minutes on the Superbowl didn't bother me either. If the DVD had shown any more it would have had to include some of those horrible officiating calls against the Seahawks and I don't want to be reminded of that. It would leave viewers wondering why Hines Ward won the MVP award instead of the officials. I prefer to believe we actually won the Superbowl instead of having it handed to us. Great DVD!

2493480,5,B000E5N6MK,"Despite other opinions that were made about the game Steelers deserve to win. Anyone who knows the game or played the game, know that in order to score a touchdown the entire ball has to do is cross the goal line. When Big Ben was in the air the ball was on the goal line and even though he was pushed back. In football, they call that forward progress and that's why the play wasn't over turned. Even if the refs miss a call or two, one call doesn't determine the out come of a football game. The Seattle Seahawks had just as many opportunities to win the game as Pittsburgh. The difference was that the Steelers were able to execute and the Seahawks didn't. You can also add to the fact that Detroit is only 300 miles from Pittsburgh and Seattle is 3000 miles, which made this somewhat a home game for Pittsburgh. The bottom line is that the Refs didn't loose this game for Seattle, the Seahawks loss this game by themselves and they have no one to blame but themselves.",1170028800,,972,4.316939890710382

2493515,4,B000E5N6MK,"This Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XL highlight package is very nicely done and should be a real keepsake for Steelers fans.  In fact, it may be the most well done highlights package I've seen among this video series.  It even evoked emotions in this viewer - and I am a New England Patriots fan.  The biggest disappointment in this DVD however, is that the bonus features are awful.  There really is only one good segment and the rest is just terrible.  And, worst of all, unlike the past two years, it does not include the entire Super Bowl game!  Steelers' fans should be quite disappointed with the bonus features given what was included in the last two Super Bowl videos for the New England Patriots.  More on that later.

The feature of this DVD is about an hour long highlights reel of the Pittsburgh Steelers 2005 season.  It includes highlights of every regular season and playoff game.  The highlights for the playoffs and Super Bowl are quite extensive.  It closely breaks down the crazy, topsy-turvy Pittsburgh victory over the Indianapolis Colts in the divisional round of the playoffs, which featured a dramatic Jerome Bettis fumble at the end of regulation that could have cost the Steelers the game.  The video also contains sound bites from coaches, players, and from the locker room during the course of the season.

Overall this highlights package is very well done.  I especially liked the opening montage showing Pittsburgh Steelers' mistakes and losses in several AFC Championship games (some of which they were heavily favored in) and Super Bowl XXX against Dallas - reminding us just how close this team has come to winning it all the past ten years but fallen just short.  It ends with Hines Ward weeping in front of the camera after last year's loss to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, setting the stage for a season that saw them win it all in tough circumstances.  As noted, special attention is given the Steelers' victory over the Indianapolis Colts in the Divisional Playoff Game, which was quite well done.  I also liked many of the close-up on the field shots that bring that action right into your lap.

The drawbacks to the highlights package, to me, is that for individual games often the drama and key important plays are just not quite brought out enough.  I felt they did a better job with the playoff games than the regular season games, at least better than most previous additions.  Also, a lot, maybe too much, attention is given to Jerome Bettis, who really becomes the central focus and story of the video at times.  I am not sure how Steelers fans will feel about this but I thought it might have been a tad overdone at the expense of other players.  And finally, and this should not surprise anyone given this is an NFL product, there was not much talk about the poor officiating in the playoff games, which was a very large part of the overall tenor of this year's post season play and the Super Bowl.  It is unfortunate that officiating was such as issue, but it was, and that this video mostly ignores the issue makes this an incomplete, maybe even inaccurate, historical record.

Now for the big letdown, the Bonus Features.  The Bonus Features, frankly, are just not very good.  If I weren't spoiled by the Bonus Features of the past two Super Bowls I probably wouldn't have that much of a reaction to them because they are, after all, add-ons.  But I am spoiled.  It does not contain the entire Super Bowl game and it does not contain post game analysis or interviews.  It mostly contains a lot of tripe.

The best, and actually very well done bonus feature, is an even more detailed highlights reel of the Pittsburgh victory over the favored Indianapolis Colts in the playoffs.  It goes through all the drama - to the erroneously overturned interception by Troy Polamalu, Bettis's goal line fumble, and the big choke by kicker Mike Vanderjagt who badly missed a makeable field goal that would have tied the game on the last play or regulation.  It's quite a well done piece.

You also get little snippets of video about Bill Cowher, Jerome Bettis, Willie Parker, and Steelers' history that are very short, and frankly not very good.  There are media day player interviews on the DVD, as well as the entire half time show, which for me I could care less about.  And finally there are Super Bowl promo videos.  Who cares about that!!!

Despite my disappointment in the Bonus Features, overall I give this video a high recommendation for the highlights reel.  If you look at the Bonus Features as freebies, then it's hard to complain too much about it.  But compared to last year's DVD, some will be disappointed.  Congratulations to the Steelers for a great season.",1148083200,5,4740,4.698181818181818
2493516,4,B000E5N6MK,"First of all, When Big Ben was air born there is an angle that shows the tip of the ball crossing the plain. Whinch is the very beginning of the edge of the white chalk. The ball does not have to make it to the green of the endzone or even to the center of the white chalk. Plus, Roethlisberger is 6'5, he was gonna make it on 4th down because he had moved the ball to the half inch line. Small ob's fall over behind center on the same sneak all the time. Cower is recorded saying on the side line that he is gonna go for it.  As well, Jackson pushed off on Chris Hope in the end zone. His wrist was bent, his arm extends and he gains seperation and leverage in order to get to the ball, Hope even leaves his feet from the push. If a defensive back does this same thing for an interception, it's gonna be called interference all day. As far as the hold goes, It's clear that the tackle for Seattle pulls on the top of the shirt of Clark Haggins for a split second and has his fingers closed  the rest of the time. The hands must be opened for them not to call holding. Also, if you watch the play you see that Haggins was not offsides, he moved, which he is allowed to do as a defensive player, before the ball was snapped, but did not cross the line of scrimmage until after th ball was snapped. That's what 3-4 linebackers often do, they antisepate the snap count to gain an advantage, like in a chess match, you antisepate your opponets next move from what you have studied through out, it's called stradagey. It did not help Seattle's  cause that that two holding calls, even more obvious ones, were called on Seahawk linemen against Steelers linebackers earlier in the game. One on Haggins , which Pitt declined due to gaining a sack, and one on Farrior, which was a take down like the one in question I'll give you that the block on Hassleback was an attempt at a tackle, but that was a post possesion foul. Pittsburgh scores on the gaget play on that drive no matter where the start. No one cried when Chris Hope knocked the ball out of Jeramey Stevens possesion after the tight end made a foot ball move and it was obviously a foumble and they called it incomplete and blew the whistle so that Pitt could not recover the ball, or when Ben got blocked in the back during the return on his interception, which happened at the 30 and would have been 15 yds from the spot of the foul so Seattle would have stated that drive grom the 45 and not the sixteen. Anyways, Pittsburgh made the Big Plays and seattle did not, The 37 yarder to Hiens ward on 3rd and 28, the 75 yard run by Parker and the 43 yd gaget paly from Randell Ell to heins Ward. Also, haver driving the ball down Seattle throat on Pitts best drive of the game, If Ben puts a little more air under the 3rda and goal pass attept, it's 21-3 Steelers, so seattle does not get thier only td which was set up on that pick, and Pitt still scores the gaget paly and the final is 28-3 Steelers, a blowout and no one remembers any calls, that were by the way, broken down on NFL Network by thethe Head Ref and stated that ll were text book calls except for the tackle that they called a block. Read the rule book before you complain, you can find it on line. Anyways great teams overcome bad calls even if they do exsist, Pittsburgh got robbed on the overturn of the Polumalo interception against Indy which ended the game at 21-10, and Randell Ell got interfered with so bad int that game on deep route, that even the announcers and halftime show analys were talking about how it could be 21-3 at the half",1145145600,10,3564,4.192419825072887

2493518,5,B000E5N6MK,"For those of us diehard Pittsburgh Steelers fans who have watched year after year and AFC Championship Game after AFC Championship Game lost to breakdowns and mishaps and bad mojo, the 2005 season was the year of redemption.  Ben Roethlisberger comes off his amazing rookie season of 14-1 (remember, he didn't start until week 3 after Tommy Maddox got creamed by Ray Lewis)winning Rookie Of The Year.  The rumors of a Sophmore Slump in the works.  Hines Ward holds out of training camp to get his contract signed.  Jerome Bettis on the verge of retirement.  The begining of the 2005 season was bumpy with the starting offense scoring no touchdowns in the four preseason games the Steelers had.  Midway through the season things started to look bleak and in week 14, the Steelers came out of the tunnel at Heinz Field to face the Chicago Bears at 7-5.  Playoff hopes were dim at best.  Could they break the three game losing streak and save their season?  Dark clouds on the horizon...right?

The Steelers won their final four games to end the regular season with a record of 11-5 and squeaked into the final playoff berth by the hair on Jerome Bettis' chinny-chin-chin.

Take to the road.

There was no way a sixth seed Wild Card team could win all three road games to make it to the Super Bowl.  No way in hell! Bill Cowher go to the Big Game?  Don't be ridiculous!

Cinncinati Bengals?  The third game played between these two teams would decide who owned the AFC North.  The Bengals lose Carson Palmer on the opening drive thanks to a rollup by Kimo Von Olhoffen.  Jon Kitna comes in strong and the Bengals are up 14-0.  The Steelers are done for....right?  Please.  The wheels fall off The Bungle's bus as as Big Ben & The Bus (along with a little help from Cedric Wilson, Antwaan Randle El, Hines Ward, Heath Miller & so many others) roll over the AFC North Division Champions like narcs at a biker rally.

On to Indianapolis.  The Colts are already etched on the Lombardi Trophy for Super Bowl XL.  No contest.  They had already kicked the Steelers asses six weeks before and they were going all the way.  This was their year.  Payton Manning could not be stopped with a 13-0 start. Marvin Harrison was on fire Edgerin James was rolling.  Hell, even the Colts' defense had stepped it up to the nth degree.  The Steelers destruction was assured.  Only one problem....someone forgot to tell the Black & Gold to lay down and die.  The Steelers came out and smashed the favorites in the mouth Pittsburgh style.  Joey Porter and Troy Polamalu owned Payton like a bitch.  Polamalu's key 4th quarter interception was miraculously overturned into an incomplete pass.  Jerome Bettis, Mr. Sure Hands, fumbled the ball on the one yard line.  Nick Harper picked it up and was going back all the way and the game was over and out of nowhere Ben Roethlisberger made ""THE TACKLE"" as it will forever be known.  Big Ben saved the game.  Vanderjagt botched the game-tying field goal.  Jerome Bettis is redeemed.  The Steelers, this fiesty bunch of sixth seed misfit road warriors is on to Denver for the AFC Championship Game....

Denver?  The Steelers?  Denver is undefeated at home.  Denver has never lost an AFC Championship Game at home.  The Steelers are the sixth seed that got lucky in Cinncinati and Indy and are ready to get a dose of Jake ""The Snake"" Plummer.  The Steelers are going down.  Once again....someone forgot to go into the Steelers' locker room and tell Big Ben and Hines Ward and Willie Parker and Jerome Bettis and Joey Porter and all the Black & Gold that they were done for and might as well make their reservations for the return trip to Pittsburgh.  Home field.  Home crowd.  The 13-3 Denver Broncos were about to show the Steelers how football is played in Mile-high Stadium.  Wrong.  Big Ben came out firing and the Steelers' D came out and punched Jake ""The Fake"" right in the mouth and for four agonizing quarters, the Denver Broncos were shown what it's like to play Steelers' Football in Mile-high Stadium.

The Bus is headed back home to Detroit to play in his final NFL game.

On to Super Bowl  XL.  On to the Seattle Seahawks.  On to greatness.

The Steelers took the long road to Super Bowl XL.  The became the first sixth seed to ever make it to the big game.  They became the only team to ever win three straight on the road, get to the Super Bowl, and then win it.  Ben Roethlisberger became the youngest quarterback to ever win a Super Bowl.  Hines Ward was XL's MVP.  Willie Parker set a record for running in a 75-yard touchdown and Antwaan Randle El became the first WR to ever throw a touchdown pass in the Super Bowl.....  And Jerome ""The Bus"" Bettis was able to retire as a Champion.

Storybook endings on a storybook season.  The Pittsburgh Steelers, 2005 World Champions.

I could watch this DVD a thousand times and still not get bored with it.  Great footage of a great season.  Lots of little extras including the Game Of The Week  Steelers@Colts Playoff Game.  Nice little montage of The Bus & Bill Cowher.  If you love the Steelers, this is a must.  If you don't....it's still one hell of an inspirational story.

If you love the NFL, then I'd also pick this up, and if you're a collector of Super Bowl memorabilia, then obviously this isn't something you'd want to miss. Beyond that, this DVD probably won't appeal to you in any way.

With that out of the way, this is a well-produced DVD dedicated solely to the Steelers' 2005 season from their first regular season game to their final Super Bowl victory. And because it was made by the guys at NFL Films, the quality of the camera work and the narration is top notch, and the sound is amazing. You hear the hits you wanted hear during the season. Also contained on this DVD are a few note-worthy extras, including the Game of the Week from the NFL Network ""Steelers at Colts."" This was probably one of the greatest games in playoff history mainly because of all the strange happenings, so it's nice to actually have it contained on this DVD. There are also some wired for sound tracks following some key Steelers players as well as Bill Cowher and the Bus. To add to what I thought was already a heap of extras, there is the half-time show (which was terrible, if you ask me), media day (which is useless, if you ask me), and numerous promos and tv spots to watch.

All in all, this is a solid DVD for Steelers' fan and an excellent addition to a dream season. But as I said, few outside of the collector's circle will find anything worth interest here.

That said, it is very well made and the DVD also includes highlights of the season's games, which would have made the ""Super Bowl Champions"" dvd set so much better.  For some reason, you cannot buy copies of the super bowl broadcasts.  A shame because those would be great to have, and someone would make a lot of money. As someone else said, you can find this at a really good price if you look around and it is defintely worth having if you are a Steeler fan.",1142899200,10,606,4.252173913043478
2493521,5,B000E5N6MK,"Heck, after reading some of the reviews here, you'd think that this DVD is junk.

Yes, there are annoying movie previews that have absolutely nothing to do with football at the beginning of the DVD.

Other than that, I loved it.  This DVD is a game-by-game review of the season that primarily focuses on highlight reel footage with audio from Hilgrove and Tunch dubbed in underneath.  It begins with some footage of past failures and ends with some footage of the post-game trophy ceremony.  Bettis is prominently featured throughout, but it's not all his show.  You get a lot of great clips and bites of Cowher, Roethlisberger, Ward, Parker, Porter, Haggans, Russ Grimm, and Dick Lebeau.

The sideline mikes, locker-room stuff, and behind-the-scenes footage was terrific.  This team is a FUNNY bunch of guys -- without this DVD, I'd never have known it.  This DVD will make you laugh aloud, cringe, tear up, and cheer.  Assuming you do, in fact, love the Steelers.

It's totally worth the twenty bucks.  You'll watch it a dozen times before next season.  How many other movies have that kind of pull?",1142640000,18,1101,4.823529411764706
2493522,3,B000E5N6MK,"I have recorded most of the game on a HDTV recorder. (Power failure in the neighborhood with 2:42 to go in game, power restored with 0:27) Was hoping to recover some of this lost time.  When I opened the DVD, I was greeted with SPAM previews of non related up and comming movies.??? It is NFL type highlights, nothing like live HD content.  Picture quality was standard.  The DVD container says ""STANDARD VERSION presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of its original television exhibition"".  I enjoyed the behind the scene footage and audio from the sidelines and players.  Probably will never watch the half time show?",1142208000,7,631,4.805555555555555
2493523,4,B000E5N6MK,"If you're a long-time Steelers fan and suffered through the mid-`80s, weathering the dissapointments of super bowl interceptions and multiple AFC championship match losses....  well, then, this DVD is for you.

It has the feel of a well-conceived, well-setup, and decently written ""Game of the Week"" episode.  The opening sequence, which sets up the recent losses in order to play up the back-story of Bettis returning for one last season, and rallying the team on to toal victory, is very well done.

The telling is totally Steelers-centric, glossing over every potentially image-tarnishing controversial moment of the playoff games and the superbowl win.  Steelers fans (myself included) will not mind one bit.",1141776000,9,712,5.378378378378378
2493524,3,B000E5N6MK,"The Steelers Super Bowl XL DVD is advertised on this Amazon page and the Steelers website as having ""...a cut-down version of the live Super Bowl XL broadcast..."". Nowhere on this DVD is anything ""live"" except the Rolling Stones. It's all NFL Films footage. If you were expecting to hear John Madden and Al Michaels call actual live plays in real-time as was broadcast on ABC, forget it. The only Super Bowl XL highlights on this DVD are NFL Films style and, for a DVD titled ""Super Bowl XL Steelers"", there really isn't all that much time devoted to the actual Super Bowl. There is more disc space devoted to the Colts-Steelers playoff game than Super Bowl XL Too bad really. The reason I ordered it was because I wanted the live game footage. The description of this product as I've seen here and countless other websites also indicates ""Pre-game predictions and post-game analysis"" are included as well. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is nothing on this disc that could be mistaken for ""predictions and analysis"". I was quite angered about being deceived. It's like Amazon and the other outlets simply took the disc's marketing department's pre-production description (you could order the DVD as soon as an hour after the Super Bowl, several weeks before it's official release) without making sure that these things actually made it onto the disc.

What this DVD is (and actually does quite well as) is a review of the 2005 season. I would call it a deluxe edition of what will probably the Steelers' NFL Yearbook come Summer. As a Steelers fan, I appreciated very much watching highlights and sideline stuff from this past year, quite a bit that I had not seen before and, trust me, I watch a lot of NFL programming.

What is very, very, very (did I say ""very""?) disappointing about this thing is that it could have been so much more. They could have made it a two disc set, included the entire Super Bowl broadcast (without commercials), the deluxe season review (what the disc is now) and a lot more extras. The so-called ""extras"" on this disc are a joke. Very short snippets. It's obvious this DVD was thrown together as fast as possible in order to take advantage of the post-Super Bowl hype.

If you're a Steelers fan, I would recommend buying, if you can get it at a substantial discount. Don't pay the list price. It's simply not worth that amount.

Perhaps, somewhere down the road, they'll put out a deluxe version and get it right. I will certainly come here first to get a review before I send off my money.

Note: A day after I posted this review, Amazon removed the references to ""...a cut-down version of the live Super Bowl XL broadcast..."". I commend them for changing the description. This doesn't help the thousands of people who thought they were getting the live broadcast though.",1141776000,23,2820,4.688888888888889

8106037,1,B000E5N6MK,"The DVD is your typical fare for season retrospects. Nothing really to complain about. However, where there is a problem is how the DVD covers Super Bowl XL.

For those who have not seen the game, Super Bowl XL was mired in controversy for the calls given by the officials towards the Seattle Seahawks. Specifically two blown calls and the spotting of a the ball on a Pittsburgh touchdown. It was so egregious that it made the NFL Network's Top 10 Most Controversial Calls and, years later, the Head Ref Bill Leavy admitted that he and his crew screwed up. Now this is common knowledge among NFL fans, is mentioned any time Super Bowl XL is discussed, and if you buy the 2005 Seattle Seahawks season retrospective, the game itself and the calls are covered in great detail to provide an objective view on what really happened.

In this DVD, the entire discussion of the game is less than five minutes and the officiating is NEVER brought up. The creators of this DVD completely  whitewashes the game and pretends that the Steelers won the game based on talent alone and not with help from the refs. There is absolutely no mention of the bad calls, the DVD outright ignores it. It's a disservice to those who are fans of football or historians of the game. The game can not be talked about without mentioning the blown calls, to do so otherwise is just wrong.

It's been said that the First Duty of a Starfleet officer is to the truth. Wether it is historical, scientific, or personal truth. This DVD ignores the truth and doesn't' care.",1471996800,,1536,4.574545454545454
