3875414,5,B0028ZZDJ8,"I really loved this film, mainly because of Meiko Kaji. Her beauty and screen presence make the film. The special effects are crude by todays standards but never the less fun to watch!! Meiko Kaji is a raven haired beauty who projects a unforgettable memory with these films!!",1369180800,3,276,4.770833333333333
3875415,5,B0028ZZDJ8,"For a 70s movie this still holds up to time even now, its an amazing Japanese movie very beautifully directed and acted in every detail, the story is your typical revenge theme which then was very original and still today has not been done better, kill bill takes nearly all this film even though kill bill is very good for a modern revenge theme retelling it does not come close to snowblood for pure awesomeness, the lead actress as the character Yuki is amazing and one of the most extremely beautiful Japanese actresses ever and she plays such an impressive assassin, there is plentiful amounts of blood and gore all done with a fantastic look for an early 70s movie, the sequel is very good too, it was not necessary for a sequel but it was made anyway probably due to the popularity of the original, the story is still very good and takes it in a different direction, still plenty of blood and violence, not as good as the original but still very well worth watching, these are 2 of the best Japanese movies ever made, if you're a big fan of these type films and have not seen this it's a must, must, must!!",1366675200,2,1113,4.407766990291262

*Plot and ending analyzed*

I guess if you have the brain of a gerbil and chew sugar candy all day, this film should fit your bill just fine. Others might want a little more in the way of a coherent story. There are parts of Lady Snowblood that are atmospheric and colorful, but the idea is not handled with enough competency, or even concern.

Lady Snowblood is some dull, waif of a woman, who has a feeble umbrella sword, whom she uses to chop in half corpulent bodies, hands, limbs and heads. Okay. The enemies are as imbecilic as the premise, even unable to fight such a woman. They just sit by and wait to be ""chopped up"". I must admit that the high reviews made me think these films would rate as high as Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman or Lone Wolf and Cub, but they are nowhere near as great.

Lady Snowblood - Love Song of Vengeance has her doing the same great sweeps of her little, feeble umbrella sword and they added some political rubbish to the play as well.

Still, they are worth a look for the time.",1469059200,,1057,4.318181818181818

8357258,5,B0028ZZDJ8,"this review is for ""Lady Snowblood 1&2 Dbl Feat.""

Great Japanese martial arts revenge movie.
Superstar Meiko Kaji is Lady Snowblood, Killer in a Kimono,
born for vengeance and vengeance she will get.
The woman is focused.

Martial Arts movie fans: these movies are big-time classics
and this double feature DVD is an excellent value and quality production
that ought to be part of your DVD collection.
You get ""Lady Snowblood"" and the sequel ""Lady Snowblood 2: Love Song Of Vengeance""
Purchasing these movies individually on separate available releases
is expensive and I'm sure that you won't get anything more than you get here
with this double feature.",1417996800,2,656,5.064814814814815

8357262,5,B0028ZZDJ8,"I was always curious about these films and i always wanted to own them but was put off by the prices. 30 bucks for each movie was alot. Then one day i watched Lady Snowblood one and two on u-tube and i knew that i had to own them. Then one day i caught a break. I saw both movies on one disc for a special low price. I was a little concerned because Bonzai and not Animeigo released this. But to my surprise, both movies looked and sounded great. The movies star Meiko Kaji as Lady Snowblood. She looks beautiful! Both movies are uncut. Both are in japanese with english subtitles. No trallers!",1375056000,9,594,4.219298245614035
