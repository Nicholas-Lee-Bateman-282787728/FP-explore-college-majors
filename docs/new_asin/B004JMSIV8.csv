8431957,5,B004JMSIV8,"I was disappointed in the 200 Country Licks, but this DVD makes up for it. Great variety of lick styles for the acoustic guitar. Including percussion and other effect styles. Great blues and bluegrass licks also. Very happy with this DVD.",1402790400,,238,4.829268292682927
8431958,4,B004JMSIV8,"Everything worked out great,delivery was as promised,shipped well,and packed well. The  product was as described and expected. A great place to search and fined pretty much anything your looking for.",1395619200,,199,5.633333333333334
8431959,4,B004JMSIV8,"200 riffs expertedly played. That's good value. Yes, only a few might be handy if you're into a a particular style or have preferred tunings, but if only 20 are valuable, that's twenty tunes that can be improved or embellished to make them more interesting in your repertoire and with imagination many more by transferring or making variations on them in the repertoire you have. For a young player, who may develop and delve into different styles and tunings as they mature, it's a valuable resource to tap to dip into for years to come. However, if the tunes were organized into key categories and a tab PDF file on the DVD was available this music resource could have been considerably improved in order to much more easily access the licks away from the computer screen.",1386115200,2,774,4.698529411764706
8431960,5,B004JMSIV8,"Okay I read the opinion of the other guy and it IS valid in the sense of altered tunings etc. I'm an intermediate guitarist that wanted something that inspired me; something fresh, and less ""Here's the detail"", more ""here's some sweet licks"" with just enough info. SCORE!

I can't say how much I dig this video. If I want to learn each lick, there IS enough info for me to master it, and it's not boringly detailed. I like how it moves along to the next lick quickly- keeps it fresh and less technical.

2nd day of owning it and I'm watching it again because the licks are so tasty and fresh (too me).

I'd definitely recommend it. In a few weeks I'll score another of the series.

8431961,1,B004JMSIV8,"This video is  pitiful....save your money!!!!!!!

I previously bought the video, ""200 Blues Licks,"" and I thought it was pretty good, so I was excited to get this one as well.  Big mistake!!!!!!!!!!

A SIGNIFICANT number of the ""licks"" are in alternate tunings.  In addition, a large quantity of the ""licks"" are fingerpicking, chordal arpeggio-type stuff.  If that weren't enough, there are many tapping ""licks"" and harmonic tapping improv sounding junk as well as bottlenck slide.  The style of the licks range from ragtime to early 20th century country to alternative world music.  I don't even know anyone who plays ragtime.  I see maybe 20 licks out of 200 that I am interested in learning.

While some of the techniques presented are worthwhile, there is little that you can take away and use immediately.  The instructors are not very dynamic at all, and a lot of the licks just lack any heart!!!!!!!!  And it's anybody's guess as to the scales these licks are taken from, or how the licks relate to chord changes, or where/how to use them.  Very, very poor instruction!!!!!!!!!!  Even worse production.  I am not sure who their target audience is.

A learning guitarist purchaes an instructional video such as this to obtain a good vocabulary of licks to use in common situations.  If you are going to produce a video where 30% of the phrases are in alternate tunings, slide, and harmonics, don't call it a licks lesson.  Produce a slide guitar lesson, or a licks video featuring alternate tunings exclusively.  I doubt that very many intermediate guitarists use alternate tunings much.  I, for one, want rock solid licks In standard tunings that are very representative of common styles so I can apply it to my playing.

The content of this dvd just falls extrmely short of my expectations.  Without sounding downright disparaging, I am an educator, and my sixth graders have produced videos with better quality, more relevant instruction.

Do yourself a favor and save your money!",1318636800,20,1989,4.924698795180723
