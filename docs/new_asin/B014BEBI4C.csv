8730160,1,B014BEBI4C,"This might have been better if they had managed to focus on other dancers besides the tattooed one.  Yes, she is lovely, but she isn't the instructor, nor is she the modified and she doesn't do all of the moves correctly. (For example she does chest pushes instead of chest lifts).  I have never seen a workout that spent less time showing the instructor.  The workout isn't particularly interesting.  The backup dancers often seem confused and have sloppy form as if this was done unrehearsed.  Not impressed.",1455840000,,510,4.816091954022989
8730161,5,B014BEBI4C,Great for a beginner and it works your booty off! Not literally...,1455753600,,66,4.583333333333333
8730162,5,B014BEBI4C,"I decided to break out of my comfort zone & order the Burlesque workout. I previewed it yesterday when it arrived and worked out to it today and I am so in LOVE with this workout!! Michelle is such a great instructor giving ques that were 'just right' I was able to follow, stiff as I am, I felt allot of tightness busting away with each section. Please put out another workout like this it is so amazing & it made me feel like I had an inner Diva (which I can't believe I have one LOL). I am so thankful to the lady who mentioned your workout to me. I want to praise this workout & beg you to do another it is done with great taste and class. I don't know how many moves there are in Burlesque but you made it come so easy that I felt allot of confidence in what I was doing & what I hope to accomplish after practicing this workout in the coming months... because each move was so approachable broken down just right.  Anyway, I love it!!",1455580800,,940,4.053763440860215
8730163,5,B014BEBI4C,"Having been a dancer my entire life, I am always looking for a new and exciting workout. I bought the DVD expecting to have a great time while I worked out but I was also DRIPPING SWEAT by the time I was finished. Michelle didn't just go through the movements quickly. She explained, in detail, exactly what muscles were supposed to be used and when. It was almost as if she was in the room with me. She kept reminding me to tuck my pelvis and ground myself into the floor. She is also INCREDIBLY MOTIVATING. Her attitude was wonderful and I found myself smiling throughout the entire workout. Also, I've done the video several times and each time I try to do it a bit faster or perform the choreography to a different song. The workout is amazing and Michelle is incredibly encouraging. If you are thinking about purchasing this DVD, just do it. It's definitely a workout (but you also feel incredibly sexy)!!!!",1453248000,3,912,4.533333333333333
8730164,5,B014BEBI4C,"Michelle's instruction is clear, easy to follow and her enthusiasm never drops throughout the entire DVD. The choreography is fun & playful but it still packs in a workout! This DVD is a must for anyone who wants to add a little ""spice"" to their normal workout routine.",1453248000,,269,4.625
8730165,5,B014BEBI4C,Knowing the creator makes this DVD twice as amazing!  Very easy to follow along.  This appeals to any fitness level.  Super fun and a great workout!,1453248000,,148,4.615384615384615
8730166,5,B014BEBI4C,"I love this video. I know Michelle personally and she is a very solid person. She's so creative and energetic but is tough at the same time. Like a lot of us women, we know we've got a lot of challenges, but we also know it's important to stay in good shape. For a lot of reasons!!!!  I practice at home using this video. Maybe someday, I'll take a class, but in the meantime, I feel pretty sexy and super strong working out to the video. You can put on costumes at home, ladies, right? It's safe there. :)",1445558400,,506,4.111111111111111
8730167,5,B014BEBI4C,"What a fun way to get fit! For years I tried aerobics, zumba, yoga, all kinds of fitness classes and videos and plans ripped out of magazines. This is the first workout where I feel challenged and yet confident at the same time. I really feel like the video is designed for you to improve over time, starting small and slow in the beginning and eventually the same moves can gain more difficulty over time as you push yourself a little farther and a little harder each day. That's something the other videos and plans just don't give you - the ability to take the same video and instruction and have it mature in difficulty as you improve your technique, flexibility, and strength.

I tried the video the first time with a friend - I have some dance experience but am on the bigger side. She was super skinny but with no rhythm at all. We both found ourselves giggling at the things that were tricky for one but not the other and applauding each other when we could do the more difficult moves together. Definitely the kind of video that will keep you challenged over time compared to others you outgrow after a few weeks following it.

Plus the music and costumes are a blast! Definitely changed the way I view working out now, and changed the way I view my body. Who knew skinny legs and big curves could feel and look so good! Andy back and legs have never been stronger!

Try Dance Yourself Fit,  no matter your body type or skill level, you'll find this workout fun and challenging!",1444867200,,1487,4.435897435897436
