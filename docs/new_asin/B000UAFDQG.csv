2918067,5,B000UAFDQG,I haven't seen this dvd yet but I really like Donnie from New Kids On The Block. So I am collecting all of his dvds. Price was cool,1328486400,,131,3.7142857142857144
2918068,3,B000UAFDQG,I would watch anything with Donnie wahlberg in it. This had a lot of shooting and killing but it felt exciting to watch.,1308614400,,120,4.260869565217392
2918069,4,B000UAFDQG,"Donnie and Jason are fly, as usual. The movie is not that bad.  However, the music really sucks.  I actually thought it made the whole movie feel worse than it was.",1234310400,,164,4.258064516129032
2918070,5,B000UAFDQG,"This movie had a great start that had you thinking the Donnie Wahlberg's charater was the ""thug"".  The development of the story line kept you wondering what was going to happen next and why each charater was involved in the scene.

I really enjoyed the movie and I had not heard of it until I was searching to purchase Southie and The Righteaous Kill.

2918071,1,B000UAFDQG,"I saw this on a video web site and thought it would be better than the reviews. I like Donny Wahlberg, but in this movie, not so good, frankly, he should have dropped the role. Maybe he's having tough times getting good scripts but this one was a real dog.

Frank John Hughes also was lost in this role. They could have gotten anyone to play this dink of police Lt.

Reunion time for Donny Wahalberg and Frank John Hughes after doing super jobs in ""Band Of Brothers"". Super series. I would love to see more of that type of movie. As for this one, a real snoozer... not worth the price of admission.",1212278400,3,598,4.2368421052631575
2918072,4,B000UAFDQG,"This movie is definitely worth watching because of the following reasons:

- It's based on  a true story.
- It contains colorful and beautiful scenes.
- There are two very suspenseful moments.
- The acting of the two main characters are good too.",1196899200,2,246,4.6976744186046515
2918073,1,B000UAFDQG,"This is on my ""worst videos of all time"" list.  Jason Gedrick should be arrested for homicidal Botox. He's supposed to be a hothead who starts fights at the drop of a hat.  Unfortunately,  he has only one expression: a plastic sneer, and is far too groomed and tanned to be a threat to anyone but the unsuspecting viewers of this lame piece of celluloid.  Donny Wahlberg, a good actor, is wasted here.  There isn't a lick of sense to the entire thing.  I only watched it for laughs.  It really is hilariously awful. At one point Donny says to Jason that he didn't see ""No one and nothin'.""  That should have been the title of this film.  Still - it's funny as heck.  Maybe you should see it, stoned, with like-minded friends.  Worst case scenario: you doze off to the tinny, ditzy disco music, hypnotically-gyrating bimbos and Jason Gedrick saying, for the umpteen-millionth time, ""You goin' soft on me, Andy?""  Or maybe that was just a million other bad actors in a million other bad so-called gangster movies saying the same thing.",1196208000,5,1033,4.584699453551913
