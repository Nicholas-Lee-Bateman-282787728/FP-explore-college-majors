7322755,4,B0112HPWQG,"This won't be your typical review, but hopefully itll be useful. Heres the deal: I happen to love this show, but it isn't perfect. Its flaws need acknowledged as well as its virtues, so Im going to cover both AND give you a parental guide in case you're wondering if the tots ought to watch it.

BASIC PLOT: Pontius Pilate makes the lives of everyone in Jerusalem a living inferno while the events of the first 10 chapters of Acts play out in the background. It opens with Jesus trial before Pilate and ends in chaos after the baptism of the first Roman convert. Roughly half of each episode revolves around a Biblical storyline and the remaining twenty-three minutes are fictional interactions with other characters involving political intrigue and family dynamics. I actually like this formula, and it is so fast-paced that 43 minutes fly by.

THE GOOD: God nailed me with this series. Every week, every episode, hit me hard in some way. I felt convicted A LOT. It wasn't just me, either  not only did I see radical growth in my spiritual life coincide with watching this series (which inspired me to dig into my Bible), I saw it happen in my friends lives as well. We would all commiserate together on Monday morning and say, Man, I want to be more like Peter!

Love is a huge part of this story. It is blatantly contrasted with the bigotry, hatred, back-stabbing, brutality, and scheming that goes on in the Temple and the Palace of Justice. When you watch Mary Magdalene embrace a weeping man, who just confessed to murdering one of her closest friends, and she tells him that all is forgiven because he is a new man in Christ well, it makes being angry about the neighbors dog peeing on your lawn ornaments seem downright childish. If thats not enough, twice Peter is told that he must forgive, or he is not practicing what he preaches. He has to forgive Saul, and then he has to forgive Caiaphas, the High Priest.

The writing, the acting, the music, everything is top quality, and SOME of the characters are incredible. They have done a particularly masterful job with Peter and Saul; the former is a man of incredible passion, warmth and love, whose face illuminates with joyful wonder whenever the Holy Spirit permits him to heal in the name of Jesus. The scene when he called forth Tabitha from the dead actually brought me to tears. In that moment, it resonated with me how much Jesus represents LIFE. Peter is  delightful. I will never look at him the same way again. Sauls shift is also powerful. His transformation is massive, from a bitter, angry, self-righteous Temple thumper into someone so full of love and honest truth that it just blew me away. I actually started missing him when he walked out of the narrative.

The secondary characters range from wonderful (such as Barnabaus, who is often the comic relief, but in a non-offensive way) to tragic (Claudia, who is stuck in a marriage on the fast track to total despair). Caiaphas is also a powerful figure. One moment, you empathize with him  the next, he reveals what a self-serving brutal hypocrite he is. He can be a loving father in one scene, and a religious fanatic in the next. And something this show does powerfully is create a tangible, frightening, almost claustrophobic sense of reality  the crowded narrow streets, the pervasive fear, the melting pot of three factions in one area: the new faith, those that worshiped the temple, and the zealots. I have never seen a faith-based production on this scale before, and that for twelve weeks it was sharing the gospel on primetime television is astounding.

THE BAD: Massive Biblical deviations caused a lot of viewers to tune out, and I get why; I stuck with it, but the show really does itself a disservice by its inaccuracies. These range from black disciples to bigger infractions. The biggest Biblical deviation is Cornelius, who in scripture was a godly and devout man and here undergoes a radical salvation experience after being Pilates brutal and godless right hand man. I don't mind writers mucking about in history, because history was not a living breathing person whose reputation gets dragged through the mud and leaves ignorant audiences confused, but this seems pretty disrespectful to the memory of a man whom God honored in allowing him to be the first convert. And I say that as someone who found his arc ultimately powerful. There are other Biblical discrepancies but in the face of Cornelius, most seem minor and in some instances, stuff is merely fleshed out instead of truly altered.

But this is bad history. And I mean BAD. Those with some basic knowledge of Roman history will scoff; those with more of an intensive knowledge of Roman and Judean history will wind up with a headache. For starters, Pilate is a total psychopath who intends to crucify women and slaughters ten Jews a day until the zealot who tried to assassinate him is found. He butchers men in the temple, forces Caiaphas to eat the ashes of a dead centurion, and generally is an evil Roman archetype, which in my opinion is just plain lazy writing.

The real Pontius Pilate was not a nice fellow, but not nearly the barbarian that this one is; theyve made him the catalyst for everything that stinks in Jerusalem and as a result, hes a one-note stereotypical villain. You are left just waiting for him to do one of the three things he does all the time: a) yell at or threaten his wife / tell her to STOP INTERFERING IN MY AFFAIRS, b) yell at or abuse the high priest, or c) order more executions for no reason other than to prove a point (I will hand it to the actor, though  he sells it and scares the living daylight out of me). Why they did such an excellent job with Caiaphas in making him a complex and interesting villain and such a shoddy job with Pilate is beyond me. Theyve taken as inspiration some of Pilates general abuses of the Jews (including spilling blood in the temple) and then taken it to frankly unbelievable levels (for the record, the Romans did not crucify women and Pilate would have never suggested such a thing).

Regarding the general history... Caligula and Tiberius never visited Jerusalem. Tiberius died far from that toilet bowl of the Roman Empire. Pilate, Caiaphas, and Herod were all removed from their positions before Caligula insisted his statue be installed in Jerusalem. It never made it as far as Judea, and Caligula died before he could retaliate against the new governors refusal to install it. (Those interested can read the Jewish scholar Josephus for more information on Pilate, Herod, Caligula, and Judean history in general.) I could nitpick further about centurions not being permitted to marry but that seems minor at this point. The horrendous history brings it down a notch and makes anyone knowledgeable about the period side-eye the project. Frankly, I wish they hadnt done it, since it destroys some of the credibility.

THE UGLY: Here is where the parental warnings come in. This series is brutal. Knowing that many of these events were standard practices in that period makes it even harder to stomach, but you can belly up to this ancient bar for a grand assortment of regular stonings, floggings, crucifixions, beatings, etc. Pilate even throws in some domestic abuse, in case you forgot that he's mean. Sometimes the camera looks away (when a Christian woman is strangled out of focus in the background) and sometimes it does not (when we get to see and hear every blow against Stephen, including the one that kills him, at which point I cringing and feeling slightly sick). For every wonderful, powerful, inspirational, spiritual moment, theres one of graphic violence. I, personally, found the message worth it, but some of my less desensitized friends quit watching it, and Id honestly be hesitant about recommending it to some people because it IS so brutal.

Most of the un-Biblical violence doesnt need to be there  and people have a point when they say the show looked for ways to inject it. Case in point: Tabitha in the Bible is a seamstress who suddenly dies and is brought back to life. SPOILER. Here, Tabitha is a servant in Herodias household, who is raped off-screen by Caligula (we hear him laughing about it later  I don't think she liked me!), THEN beaten so badly by Cornelius on Pilates orders (because she dared to become a believer of Jesus under his roof) that she dies of her injuries. END SPOILER.

Great back story! Did we need it, though?

QUESTION (since I know some people are wondering):

Is this heavily Catholic?: No. It doesnt adhere to any particular churchs stance on anything, and if anything, devalues Catholicism somewhat in its more blatant assertions about Peter (I am not the rock; Jesus is the rock). So if you're a Protestant shying away from it thinking it has heavily Catholic overtones, there are none.

IN CONCLUSION: Though two chunks of this review could be construed as complaining, it really isn't. I loved this series. I honestly did. It was the bright point of my week. I begged most of my friends into watching it, and then held intense theological discussions with most of them after the effect. These characters are now solidified in my imagination and my heart. I'm actually quite forgiving of Biblical fiction, and that is what this series actually is. I'm inclined to cut it an awful lot of slack, but I also feel that if given more seasons, it could find a better balance between the love of Christ it displays and the brutality of the times. If I don't get to see the rest of Acts unfold in living color on my television screen next year, I might just cry.",1441065600,235,9604,4.714370900417412
7322756,5,B0112HPWQG,I don't know what the previous review is talking about. Where does the shapeshifter come from. I do know one thing whatever bible this genius has been reading is not the true inspired Word of God. God is not evil but He is just. People tend to skip over that fact when they come up with nonsense like the preceding reviewer wrote.,1438905600,4,330,4.338709677419355
7322757,5,B0112HPWQG,"Another Great series about the Book of Acts that shows how tye Great God of Truth Our Lord and God Jesus Christ stood by his disciples with HIS HOLY SPIRIT as tgey were spreading the Good News that there is a powerful Every Living God who grants ud0s forgiveness from our sins is we repent and turn around and accept his Sacrificial death on the Cross to take way our sins and how to rise with him as we enjoy his Glorious Resurrection in a world full of anger, bitterness , immorality and blasphemy, a world that Goodness and Truth and tries to fight those who spread Love instead of hatred, purity instead of sexual immorality, honesty instead of dushonesty , Truth instead of lies, repentance instead instead of wallowing in the filth of sin. The series depicted clearly the amount of hostility that the early Christians had to face as they spread the Truth of Christ instead of the satanic lies of pagan false dieties and How the Love of Our Lord and Gos Jesus Christ was always Victorious over all the hatrec and opposition. The series also represented the Historical Reality of the Book of Acts in an adventure style that captivates thd heart and minds of the viewers. Another excellent work from Roma Downey and her husband in spreading the Truth through quality and first class acting and directing. Great work that is worth the price.",1438732800,11,1343,4.623430962343096
7322758,5,B0112HPWQG,"As with the first series The Bible, the series tells you stories that you have never heard before.  Is it perfect, no but very informative.  I think it is very good for Catholic/Christians kids to watch this series so all those words that they have been hearing about come to a better understanding.  One of a couple of problems though I have with this series is that the husband and wife actors who did the first series and now this one got complaints that there were no black people in the shows, they made John and Mary Magdalene black characters instead of who they truly were.  They also showed Jesus being on the cross with nails in his hand instead of his wrist.  But I've enjoyed the series so far.",1437868800,38,706,4.4
7322759,2,B0112HPWQG,"johnellizz reviews ""A.D. The Bible Continues""
This truly disgraceful piece of Reptilian Hollywood crap attempts to defame Jesus by connecting him (as usual) to cold-blooded murder, torture and, surprisingly, ARMED ROBBERY. If you were allowed to watch the REAL Bible story that matters (the johnellizz ""Space Gods"" version) you'd know that Hollywood is a BioDigital propaganda machine to spread the poisons of hatred and murder to the innocent human species. ""A.D."" is typical Reptilian psychology (MAN, are they little wind-up meat puppets!).
 Just as we see in the Unholy Bible itself, the evil nature of the so-called 'god' in this mini-series is fully revealed. The purpose of this disclosure is to secure the AGREEMENT of religious humans to worship evil knowingly (you see, if the 'god' never clearly did evil, then you wouldn't be knowingly worshipping evil by worshipping it).
 So in this absurd mini-series from Reptilian Shapeshifter Roma Downey, we clearly see 'god' viciously murdering an innocent married couple in the most gruesome way imaginable because they 'came up light' with their money! Let me clue you in: THERE IS NO GOD WHO MURDERS YOU FOR NOT HANDING OVER ALL YOUR MONEY (this is simply the infantile behavior of Reptilian aliens). Interestingly, the need to establish 'Peter' as an 'evil hero' is also present in this scene...for the ghoulish murder of the wife is carefully depicted as Peter's murder - this way, the mini-series main 'good guy' is knowable as an evil protagonist (because if he didn't murder the woman you'd still be able to view Peter as a good guy EVEN if you thought the 'god' was evil...so the Reptilians are very clear to establish Peter as a murderer as well). Always with the Reptilians it's this NEED to establish AGREEMENT that you're choosing evil by clearly SHOWING it to you.
Even more amazingly, we see sycophantic Reptilian celebrities approving of this inexplicable act of murder in the ""Beyond A.D."" talk show...even though it's clear that NONE of these shapeshifting celebrities gave all THEIR money away, EITHER!
 Hollywood is part of this SHAMEFUL agenda. (Roma Downey, please take johnellizz' RED PILL of ABSOLUTE TRUTH and evict that Reptilian from your mind and soul, okay?)  -Johnny",1437868800,2,2249,5.119891008174387

7322799,5,B0112HPWQG,"This series reminds me of the kind of things one comes up with while meditating on the Acts of the Apostles.  The persons who fleshed out the characters in this series have great imaginations. I love that. They do take license with the Scriptures,but it's the kind of license that brings them alive,especially to the uninitiated. If the letter of the Word is not dot by dot here, the Spirit certainly is.  There is some violence. The first century was a violent time. The violence mostly takes the form of beatings, whippings and rough handling of citizens by the Romans, though there are occasional actual stabbings and slashings, too.  I would not have let my children under the age of reasoning watch it. You parents know when your children reach that age each at a time.  Generally psychologists and theologians puts the age of reason between the age of 8 - 10. Before that time, divorcing what is really real, and what is completely acted do not always senque even if on the outside they may seem more mature. Mimicking adult behavior does not make it understood.  I am just particular and would rather follow the Ephesians rule with young eyes and brains and souls: keep it beautiful, pure, holy and good. They have the rest of their lives to watch the rest.  For everyone else, I HIGHLY recommend it.  I hope they do more.",1523750400,,1329,4.629787234042553

The story of the church becomes a minor sub plot. Very little attention is given to the numerous miracles and preaching.

7322821,2,B0112HPWQG,"I was disappointed, but not surprised.  Hollywood NEVER just tells the story just as it was written in the Bible.  Example:  They left out the part of the great commission in Matthew 28:18-20 that commanded baptism.  The accurate quote is:
Mat 28:18  And Jesus came and said to them, ""All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Mat 28:19  Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
Mat 28:20  teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.""

The events of Acts two were not accurate by any stretch.  The Holy Spirit came AS THE SOUND OF (or LIKE-NOT LITERALLY) a mighty rushing wind.  The cloven tongues SIMILAR TO OR LIKE fire rested above each apostle.  Peter's sermon was totally omitted.  I'm referring to:

Act 2:14  But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them: ""Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words.
Act 2:15  For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day.
Act 2:16  But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel:
Act 2:17  ""'And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;
Act 2:18  even on my male servants and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.
Act 2:19  And I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;
Act 2:20  the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day.
Act 2:21  And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.'
Act 2:22  ""Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know
Act 2:23  this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.
Act 2:24  God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.
Act 2:25  For David says concerning him, ""'I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;
Act 2:26  therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope.
Act 2:27  For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One see corruption.
Act 2:28  You have made known to me the paths of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.'
Act 2:29  ""Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
Act 2:30  Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne,
Act 2:31  he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.
Act 2:32  This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses.
Act 2:33  Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing.
Act 2:34  For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, ""'The Lord said to my Lord, ""Sit at my right hand,
Act 2:35  until I make your enemies your footstool.""'
Act 2:36  Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.""
Act 2:37  Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, ""Brothers, what shall we do?""
Act 2:38  And Peter said to them, ""Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
Act 2:39  For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.""
Act 2:40  And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, ""Save yourselves from this crooked generation.""
Act 2:41  So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.

Not only was practically all of the body of Peter's sermon on Pentecost Sunday left out, but again any reference to water immersion for the remission of sins was omitted.  3,000 souls were added to the Church on Pentecost Sunday 30 A.D. and yet there was not the depiction of one person being baptized.

I was disappointed.  My message to Hollywood film makers is this:  If you're not going to depict events EXACTLY AS THE BIBLE RECORDS THEM then don't bother making a movie about the Bible.  The Bible is perfect as is and does NOT need any Hollywood additions or subtractions.",1521417600,3,5134,4.272538860103627

Some of the most engaging and brilliant writings of the last two-thousand years ignored to make up this politically correct account based upon ignorance and lack of study.  An eighth-grade student compiles a synopsis of the New Testament based on not paying attention or never actually reading the assignment of Scripture and makes up a sophomoric account of Christianity, and we have the film to prove it.  My favorite parts are Black African Hebrews tossed in and Mary representing the mother of Martin Luther physically.

7322993,2,B0112HPWQG,"Disappointed. It appears that this movie was written by a kid that read the ""Act of the Apostles"" placed the different chapters on cards, shuffled them and then started the script by the cards appearing to him, and then with his childish imagination, he added on his own. Any person with knowledge of the Bible will know that besides what it's described in the Gospels, there it's almost nothing else to know about Caiaphas, Pilate, Anas, etc. The females have a big place in the movie, something also no where found in the Gospels or in the Act of the Apostles. Jews with green or blue eyes, dark skin? Big disappointment.
Second review. I just saw this mini series again. As mentioned before there are many inaccuracies. Things that are not mentioned in the Act of the Apostles, and certainly neither John or Mary Magdalene were black.  In history, Tiberius and Caligula never went to Judea.",1489708800,,893,4.7243589743589745
7322994,5,B0112HPWQG,"Although one or more quotes seem to be out of established sequential order, this engaging presentation should be seen by all persons who believe the Bible Story of Yeshua of Nazareth - especially all those who descended from Abraham through Ishmael and Isaac.  Consequently, at the outset, I am pleased to review this movie and recommend it for both congregational and communal as well as family viewing.

No doubt, it will be obvious to instructors of the period, bible scholars, and religionists alike that those who have understanding of the Graeco-Roman world of 1st century AD will be drawn to the breath-taking sequences of the various encounters between the powers.  The interplay between Pilate and Caiaphas as well as those between their wives will fuel the imagination of viewers to revel in the back-story portrayal of how it must have been.

Indeed this four disc series is perhaps the best portrayal of the events surrounding the fearful reticence of the Apostles as chronicled in the Bible that I have ever seen; and every effort for a global marketing should be made to every Christian community in every city with free viewing for all - something i am encouraging in my own city.

The first installment you got to know the characters and this one, I felt like I had to get to know them all over again. And I was confused with who was who all the time. One character, forgot the name, he was killed with this girl in the end for attacking the Romans when they rolled in the gold statue. He looked exactly like King Saul from the first one. I had to Google to see if the king survived or not. Lol. Unfortunately this show was cancelled so it sucks that we can't watch anymore. The ending will leave you hanging, unless they come out with more. If the story ends here, I recommend watching only the first installment - The Bible miniseries- at least that one gave a brief summary to what happens to the disciples in he end.",1478476800,,826,4.20125786163522

HOWEVER, I appreciate a movie that had taken such an effort to bring the bible into the homes of people.  In a day and age when so much of the TV and Movies out there are junk.  This is a MUCH welcome change.  As for the incorrect portions.  I say, use those as teaching moments for your family.  Discuss what really did happen .... and explain that the bible also tells us that the TRUTH will get twisted, distorted and shifted as time goes by.  Then how important it is to Keep on track with the actual word of God, not man's interpretation.",1470787200,15,669,4.373983739837398

7323151,5,B0112HPWQG,I'm not sure what to say about. I enjoy the actors but it was confusing that they switched actors on us. I watched the bible first and assumed all the same actors would be in A.D. It was hard for me to get settled in again with who was who. None the less great series and really opens your mind up about the events that probably took place around the city after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.,1462406400,,405,4.139240506329114

The story completely ends with many unresolved issues at the last episode. It ended as though it was a break for a commercial. There were many revelations that happened towards the ending that would need a whole season it seems to resolve, however the shows creators decided to cut it off completely and leave the viewer feeling ""well, so what happened? What happened to Pilate's wife? What happened to Ciapphus? What happened to Cornelius the centurion after his conversion? What became of Paul of Tarsus? Too many ""what happened to's"" to list here.this seems like a complete waste of time"". There would be  redemption however, if they decided to continue on the way they should but I read that the show's completely cancelled - that's why I gave this a poor review.",1462233600,7,919,4.929032258064516

So I wanted this series in my biblical collection.  We just started this as a prayer group study, as a compliment to the continuation of Easter season. We just viewed the 1st episode and everyone loved it.  We are also using the Catholic Study Guide along with it.  It has before watching preparation and after watching questions and discussions for each episode that compliments the series.

So you are left not knowing what happened to Pontius Pilot, the apostles, Cornelius or anyone else. The producers had hoped to have a Season 2, but due to low ratings, they just dropped the entire thing.  So know that you will be left to figure out on your own what happens next. Sad, as I bought the DVD series hoping to find out. I was wrong. And, apparently the series started out pretty accurate but fades into fictional parts as it wears on.  Great acting and I wish they had finished this as accurately as possible.",1460592000,,647,4.295081967213115

He reappears to them several times to tell them of their mission.

What is recorded in a few pages in the Bible on paper really represents months' of happening;  people reading the Bible may not realize that.  The episodes show blood, tear and fear  while black and white on paper the readers may not feel it; Bible readers usually read as though it is a story and of no concern to the self.  Readers should however understand that the episodes were mostly made-up stories, not actually as recorded in Bible.

7323357,2,B0112HPWQG,"I liked The Bible. I thought it was very well done. I anticipated that this would be the same. The problem with A.D. is that it has none of the passion.

You really need to go into this story knowing a lot of background. The film doesn't do a great job of story telling so there could be lots of confusion. I DO know the story and still I was confused. It takes a really long time to develop the characters. It's really an action film stuffed with a lot of supposition. I give it high marks for culture and history, but it also gets high marks for fantasy. That's not really what I was looking for.

The direction seems very modern and western as well. I never felt as though I was looking at ancient, eastern people. It takes more than clothing and make-up to create that.",1449878400,3,773,4.216216216216216

7323360,1,B0112HPWQG,"I concur with many of the positive reviews about the quality of this production and acting. But I strongly disagree with any reviews that suggest the depiction of the First Century is accurate. My primary critique is of the ""inner thought life"" of the characters. The words and attitudes that they display in this series are probably not at all what they really were.

Of course, this critique would apply to many period movies, so I'm not really faulting the producers of this series. I'm was a career military intelligence analyst and I can authoritatively state that Tom Clancy movies don't reflect the reality of the intelligence community. (His books are quite close, however.) I'm also a Biblical scholar (i.e., a pontificating blowhard) and spent much of my long life analyzing life in biblical times, using the original sources and languages. And I can also authoritatively state that this TV series does not reflect the time period with regard to the inner thoughts and attitudes of the major players.

One primary comment that I'd make concerns the way military and/or political command organizations operate. In the Roman Empire they had developed standard procedures that guided their actions. Josephus and Tacitus report how often these standards were violated, yet the ""atmosphere"" of well-oiled organizations should have been the dominant characterization of Pilate and his staff. This ""yes, sir; no, sir; no excuse, sir"" authoritarianism as shown in ""A.D."" is a mythical narrative created for the stage. On the other hand, the bullying of the men by their wives was probably a better reflection of the marriages of the screenwriters than of the time period.

The greatest shortcoming, however, is in the discussions between the Christians and between the Apostles. Christian leaders today have far more fascinating conversations over coffee than these actors portrayed. Paul would go around and ""reason from scriptures"" or persuade from Greek philosophy at the drop of a hat. It didn't matter whether someone was a trained Rabbi or a Greek shopkeeper, he could shape his conversations around his mission of presenting the Truth. How much more would he have eagerly shared new insights and revelations about the Old Testament's foreshadowing of eternal truths. When Paul wanted to discuss and teach about how people should regard each other (i.e., as ""more important than themselves"" in Philippians 2), he did it by revealing one of the greatest Theological and Christological concepts (the ""kenosis""). So a discussion that Paul would have had with Peter about the need to ""accept one another"" as brothers in Christ wouldn't have been done through sullen staring and a sad shaking of the head and muttering, ""you just don't get it, do you...""

In many ways this TV series accurately depicts the ""message"" that can be found in most churches today. Poorly trained and lonely pastors try to entertain congregations with heart-warming and inspiring anecdotes, pleading (hopefully) with people to trust Christ and His sacrifice for them. A look at the most pivotal time in history could have had the power of Daniel's teachings about the march of time and the unfolding of the Plan of God--all leading up to the End Times when death would be swallowed up in victory. Jesus spent his last free afternoon on earth talking about history (the Times of the Gentiles). Eternal themes of God's mysterious plan (and the ""mystery"", as Paul calls the church age) would have dominated the talk among the leaders of the early church.

Now, in contrast, the wimpy, authoritarian, petty and disgusting ""church"" of the Second through Twentieth Centuries was quite accurately portrayed in this series. Jesus prophesied (as did Paul and Peter) that the church would be a time of ""beasts raising themselves up among you"", biting and devouring the faithful in their apostate squabbling. Moses, for his part, prophesied the same thing regarding the Jews, predicting their continual abandoning of the faith and falls under the boots of godless nations.

Ultimately, I recommend fast forwarding through most of this series and catching some of the color and flavor of Jerusalem and various palaces. The ""action"" otherwise just drags through people posturing and strutting and insulting one another with one liners. (Note: This isn't to say that they don't do ""that"" well; the acting is excellenta, given the empty and anachronous lines they are given.)",1448928000,11,4440,5.142659279778393

7323366,2,B0112HPWQG,"It seems that the majority of the reviewers here on Amazon are biblically/historically illiterate. Let me give some examples that are not biblical in this miniseries (Spoiler Alert)...

- Pontius Pilate knows too much about Jesus (prior to his arrest by the Jewish leadership).

- No Barabbas (the actor who played Barabbas in The Bible: The Epic Miniseries is now
  playing a disciple, Simon the zealot,  confusing and weird).

- Caiaphas the High Priest had a nasty, strong-willed wife (not mentioned in the Scriptures).

- Cornelius (Acts 10) participated in the death of Jesus (not biblical).

- Mary Magdalene calls Peter a coward (not biblical).

- Caiaphas the High Priest is clueless about Jewish law and capital punishment.

- Caiaphas orders that the cross be cut up into pieces (a reference to the fake true cross pieces
  that have no firm archaeological connection to Jesus)

- Simon the zealot says that Jesus will not rise from the dead.

- Caiaphas the high priest orders soldiers to guard the tomb of Jesus (it was Pontius Pilate
  not Caiaphas).

- Fictional dialogue between biblical characters and fictional characters.

- Roman guards re-sealed the tomb of Jesus.

- Peter died for Jesus.

- Jesus didn't ascend to heaven but walked up a mountain and joined other saints.

- The disciples did not wait in Jerusalem for the Holy Spirit (they traveled around).

- Peter's daughter joined the disciples.

- Contradictions in between scenes.

- Peter does not preach after the arrival of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:14-40).

- Mary Magdalene snuck food into the jails for the disciples.

- Mary Magdalene worked in the governor's palace as a servant.

- Caiaphas' wife conspired against the disciples.

- Pontius Pilate's wife secretly protected Jews and Christians.

- A little girl is healed ""in the name of Jesus Christ does not work (only when Peter's
  name is added - that he walked and ate with Jesus was she healed).

- Barnabas which means ""son of encouragement"" is portrayed by the actor as fearful, nervous and
  not encouraging.

- Joseph of Arimathea's nephew was crucified by Pontius Pilate

- Caiaphas the High Priest is forced by Pontius Pilate to eat the ashes of a dead Roman soldier.

- Caiaphas' wife threatened to have Joseph of Arimathea arrested.

- Simon the Zealot was drugged by anti-Roman forces.

- Jesus was not found in the temple at the age of 12 by his parents but by his brother James (not
  scriptural).

- Simon the Zealot protected Saul/Paul from getting murdered.

- The Ethiopian Eunuch who was baptized by Philip conspired with zealots against Rome.

- Cornelius (Acts 10) strangled a servant girl from Pontius Pilate's residence.

- Mary Magdalene went with Peter to visit Cornelius in order to baptize him and his family (not
  scriptural).

- The wife of Caiaphas was either murdered or committed suicide.

7323367,5,B0112HPWQG,Wonderful and inspiring miniseries combining Scripture and politics of the time. All the actors give very strong performances. Too bad when aired on NBC it was spread over 12 weeks. That time span required a big commitment which many people could not give to. Perhaps several 3 hr episodes on consecutive nights would have been better. Unfortunate there is much more to the Acts of the Apostles that we are not getting a chance to see because NBC cancelled the series. Hopefully the rest of the series will be produced and shown on cable. The blu ray  is state of the art. Sharp picture quality and dynamic sound.
