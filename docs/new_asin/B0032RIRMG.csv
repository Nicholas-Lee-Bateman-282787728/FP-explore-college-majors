Tender relationships are a part. Continuously changing battle strategies. The outlaws are not a huge group, but win through tricks, strategy, and a strong bond to each other.",1490140800,,320,5.037735849056604

8387646,5,B0032RIRMG,"When you order this set  of 9 DVDs, you will immediately see what an incredibly important work this is.  The cover is a heavy (maybe) cardboard covered with a very fine paper that is covered  front and back with Chinese writing of various sizes and avery detailed pin & ink drawing.  The inside part that holds the DVDs comes out.  Each page is made of some kind of a very special paper with elaborate writings and drawings on each page.  That's all to impress on you the importance of  this work.  It is considered to be one of the four most important pieces of Classical Chinese literature.  It's a complex story covering several generations.  An epic.  The story takes place during the Song dynasty, and the story is written in vernacular Chinese (in contrast to classical Chinese).  I have not watched the entire story yet.  It takes  time.  And obviously most people will have to use the subtitles.  But I think I can say that most of you will never have seen anything like this.  The exquisite, extremely detailed drawings and the singing/music during the credits bring you to realize this is the real thing!  For those of you who are intrigued with and greatly appreciate Chinese art forms, including forms such as this, I encourage you to add this to your collection.  A magnificent piece!",1415836800,,1297,4.65929203539823

8387648,4,B0032RIRMG,"If you are a fan of Asian martials arts and adventure movies, this long-running TV show is just the thing. Its length enables it to delve more deeply into character portrayals and drama, which enhances both the adventure itself and the viewing experience. Despite being well-versed in Hong Kong movies, I have never heard of any of the actors in this (mainland China) series, but most of them are very good, also in terms of martial arts. The storyline concerns the corruption of the Imperial court and its politicians, which leads various honorable men to have to become outlaws, and the plot involves many aspects of this difficult process. Some of the characters want to submit to Imperial rule even when it is corrupt, until they are driven too far beyond their own moral code and have to desert. Problems like power-mongering and status are explored in some detail, and most of the outlaws have to go through gruelling experiences, having their families killed, etc., before they are finally enough to organize into an elite army.

There are 8 DVDs in this set (not 9 as it says on the page), and I haven't seen all of them yet, but they are worth savoring and taking one's time with. There are five 45 min. episodes on each disc. When you get to the menu, there is a ready-made English option you can choose. Yes, the subtitles sometimes disappear too quickly, and aren't generally of high quality, but to someone used to watching a lot of Asian action-adventure movies, this really is neither new nor unexpected. Overall, a great set which is well worth the cost to anyone who appreciates good Asian action-adventure and drama. I plan to get the other TV shows based on the Four Great Chinese Novels as well, when I can afford to.",1360022400,5,1737,4.676470588235294
8387649,5,B0032RIRMG,"This long, classic novel of ancient China has a well-deserved reputation as an excellent piece of historical fiction.  The tale is long, complicated and involves as many characters as ""War and Peace."" Keeping track of them is somewhat of an issue, but I believe that, like ""War and Peace,"" the story becomes more manageable with more exposure.  The production is excellent.  Costuming is wonderful.  The exteriors are magnificent, and the martial arts work is appropriate to the time.  This is a tale of government gone bad, and people who would like to do something to fix is are reviled and (often) punished.  Well worth the investment in time and money.",1357430400,3,656,4.918181818181818
