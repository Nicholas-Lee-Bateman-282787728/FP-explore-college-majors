It's probably cheesy, but they told me it was from the same producers as ""Army of Darkness"", so I said what the hell, I'll do it. My name doesn't come up in the credits on IMDB, but I'm pretty sure it's in the movie credits. Been wanting to see what happened with this.",1367020800,,446,3.966666666666667
8084374,1,B000BB4KLI,"A friend has a relative with an acting (speaking !) part in the movie and wanted to get a copy for the sake of showing it to other family members.

since this was the only goal in obtaining the movie it has to be considered a success.

Expectations were not to be entertained by the movie---and it lived up to that !",1242950400,,316,4.080645161290323
8084375,1,B000BB4KLI,"This can't be the same movie the other reviews are talking about ... or they're all friends of the kids that made it.  Without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen.  Looks like a bunch of college students borrowed a video camera from a parent; the acting is so stiff it can barely be called acting; the sound is horrible ... too loud in some places, then to quiet in others.  Unless you're up for a really good laugh, skip this one.",1179878400,,434,4.204819277108434
8084376,5,B000BB4KLI,"I seek out independent film and music.  I get tired of seeing the same things over and over again from hollywood.  Thank you Back of the House Productions for giving me something original.  The Shane Will and Mark Lowry took concepts we are familiar with and gave them an original spin was more than refreshing.  Also, I must comment that Shane Will's directing is superb, I see a bright future for this guy.  Very good movie with a great soundtrack from Chad Ebbit.  I can't give this movie enough praise, and I can't recomend it enough.  Five stars is not enough, watch this one now.

8084377,5,B000BB4KLI,"Hey guys, I was doing a search for this movie, and I ordered a copy off Customflix.com a few weeks back, and Shane, great job man. I'm really impressed. I love independent horror movies, and you've made a fan out of me. Can't wait to see what you do next. And everyone else on here, check it out, you won't be disappointed.

8084379,5,B000BB4KLI,"I'm always on the lookout for non-studio horror, so I picked up a copy. These guys at Back of the House Productions know how to make a good horror flick. I was blown away by the original script, and how it was all put together. If you are looking for something different then the cookie cutter bull$%&# that studios pump out now a days, and want a great ride, pick this one up. It needs to be seen, and the word needs to spread.",1133740800,3,428,4.107142857142857
