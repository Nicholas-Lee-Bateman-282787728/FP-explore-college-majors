3164292,5,B0016RNLZW,"If British comedy is your cup of tea, this DVD is for you.  It's a nice companion piece for the hilarious show ""Keeping Up Appearances"".  Not only that, it's hosted by the one and only Onslow!  How could this not be a winner?  Buy it!",1263081600,2,234,4.133333333333334

3164295,5,B0016RNLZW,Since I have all the Keeping Up Apperances DVD'S I found this DVD to be a recap and was disappointed.  It was still good though but nothing special.,1237420800,9,148,4.285714285714286
3164296,1,B0016RNLZW,"I bought this from Amazon and was very excited to add this to my growing BBC library and to complete my KUA collection.  The packaging says that the extras include an interview w/ the actor who plays Onslow and ""outtakes"".  Unfortunately the extras included neither.  The included interviews were from Patricia Routledge (Hyacinth) and Judy Cornwell (Daisy).  There are no outtakes at all.  Terribly disappointing as each volume before this one contains at least 5 minutes worth of the most hilarious outtakes I think I have ever seen from any television series.",1229644800,18,562,5.065217391304348
3164297,4,B0016RNLZW,"For those who have the Full Bouquet set of Keeping Up Apperances, you will find no new clips on this. However, you will find an insightful and funny rendition of Onslow introducing some of the show's best moments.

This movie makes a great recap or an ""I don't want to watch every single episode again"" treatise with the good family of Hyacinth. For those who have never seen Keeping Up Appearances, this is an excellent starting point from which to grab interest. If you can't laugh at this, then it is unlikely you'd find anything humorous in the Full Bouquet set, and you'll save yourself some time and money. But in the good chance you do laugh, you'll be well on your way to full social snobbery with the best of them!",1224460800,31,723,4.4772727272727275

I find Onslow to be one of the funniest of them all. Sloppy and care-free, he seems to enjoy life, uncomplicated.  He actually has a certain philosophy if you listen. This is a great CD with scenes from many of the shows. I think it could have been even better had they used outakes, but that wasn't included much years ago.",1337817600,,470,4.465116279069767

episode of any kind on the dvd.  Incerps of Onslow explaining the Onslow character
was not entertaining what so ever.  I am going to ask for my money back. There should have been a better discription of this dvd. It was 100% a disappointment.
