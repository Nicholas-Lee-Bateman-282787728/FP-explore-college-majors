8001858,3,B0000E65XN,"i expected this documentary to feature more facts about the life and ecology of coyote habitat, but it discussed very little that was relevant to solving the problem of predation. if it did, it was a but dated in my eyes. i raise sheep and fight coyotes constantly and am always exploring options and strategies to defend the flock.

 i was hoping to use this as a way to communicate with others who hate/ aggressively hunt them. i don't think it will change anyones mind. it sensationalizes the hunting contest thing to point of distraction from the point trying to be made.",1325808000,,575,4.627450980392157
8001859,5,B0000E65XN,"Let me state right up front that this movie is polarizing.  It is designed to encourage you to think that coyote management is a bad thing, and that coyotes are being persecuted unfairly, inhumanely, and at great ecological cost.

And this movie does this well, hence, the five-star rating.

Now, you may disagree vehemently with the message of this film.  That's okay.  But this film was well produced and directed, from the editing to the photography to the music.  If you love the message, you won't be embarrassed to show it.  If you hate the message, then you'll be happy to show it to demonstrate how the producers and directors got it wrong.

The DVD I have contains four versions, a 19, 28, 57, and a 83 minute version.  I recommend the longer version, but the shorter ones work better at a meeting or in a classroom.  However, the shorter versions do leave out important parts of the ""bigger picture.""  I've probably shown this video to groups over 30 times.  It will stimulate discussion!

I know many of the people featured in this movie.  They are good at what they do.  However, they do different things.

Recommended to stimulate discussion.  Another good, related video is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Varmints/dp/B00015WN2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Varmints</a>.",1263340800,3,1326,5.298076923076923
8001860,3,B0000E65XN,"This movie bills itself as a balanced approach to the coyote contoversy in the west. While bringing many ag issues to the fore front, there is an underling bias as one would expect from the Fund For Animals.  Some of their arguments are valid, but that does not excuse their subtle editorial manipulation of the film focusing on anti-hunting.

As a gov. official who had to deal with the only human death at the ""jaws"" of a coyote in North America I am not comfortable with the approach this film presents.

Does grazing impact our wilderness and wlidlife, absolutely. Does a species that survives under any circumstances, like the cockroach and the feral pig deserve our protection, even inside urban boundries, NO.",1149724800,2,716,4.852459016393443
8001861,4,B0000E65XN,"Somewhere on the fringe of traditional natural history programming, there is a special group of documentary films that deal specifically with the tenuous interaction between man and animal: Cane Toads, Rat, Deep Trouble, to name a few.  Killing Coyote can be added to this list, bringing a lot of bite.  Beautiful images of roaming coyotes are juxtaposed with angry ranchers, zealous hunters and animal rights activists.  The longest version of the film (included with several other shortened versions) centers around a coyote-hunting cash contest controversy.  As the film develops, you can't help but feel involved with all three communities: the hunters who uphold their tradition, the activists who abhor the senseless slaughter and the coyotes who just keep on doing their thing.

If you're wondering if you should take a chance on this one, you should.  The film is independently distributed, it's intelligent and it's reasonably priced.  I tip my hat to the folks at High Plains Film, and I look forward to seeing more of their work.",1105574400,9,1040,5.154761904761905
