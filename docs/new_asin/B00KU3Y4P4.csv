6448509,5,B00KU3Y4P4,"When I picked up Baka & Test I was admittedly skeptical. I have seen more romance comedy anime than I can shake a stick at. I enjoy them but they do wear after awhile, especially after the girls start piling up. I do miss the days where the main hero was interest in only one girl and only had a maximum of five chasing after him. Now it's many many more with terribly indecisive main males.
Fortunately for me Baka & Test season two continues the proud tradition of the first season, there are only two girls pursuing, though the lead remain oblivious. The wacky hijinks continue and the main focus of the show is fun comedy. Honestly this is the funniest series I've seen since My Bride is a Mermaid, the comedy stronger than romance. That being said, there is no real plot advancement, no roman advancement or any real serous story telling here. Just light hearted fun that shouldn't be taken too seriously. That being said by the end of season two the nonstop comedy was getting wearing so try not to watch the series in a marathon like I did. Other than that for less then twenty bucks its hard pressed to find a better buy.

Bare Bones:
Good:
Animation is smooth and solid, does mix in chibis from time to time but nothing annoying
Comedy that is actually harmless and funny.
Excellent voice acting in dubs and good dubs too

Bad:
Is not serious by any measure, nor thoughtful
Lacks closure, it has one of those ""their days go one like this always"" non-endings anime do so often, not annoyingly so but there.

Extra: This does include the two OVAs along with the series for free.",1426636800,3,1585,4.458620689655173

6448512,5,B00KU3Y4P4,"Baka & Test is one of my favorite animes. I am one of those people who has watched enough anime that I categorize my favorite animes by genre; example: comedy, romance, romcom, action, etc. You get it. Anyways, Baka & Test, both seasons 1 + 2 are my favorite anime categorized under comedy.

Baka & Test introduces you to a great set of characters that are within a very fun environment. The English dub for Baka & Test is probably one of the best dubs I've ever watched. The characters act together in a seamless fashion in which you can tell the voice actors had a blast working together to make this. The plot, may seem scattered at times, but turns out to have a rather solid storyline. The comedy aspect of the show itself will, without a doubt, keep almost anyone watching, with exceptions.

I will add that the comedy is a rather... how might i put it, stupid comedy. I personally find Akihisa Yoshi, the main character, to be the most fun and lovable of the characters because his personality is just plain stupid-funny. He's not smart to put it simply, actually, none of the characters are all that bright, being as they are all in Class F. Although, Aki is the dumbest of them all. His comments will make you question if he seriously can't catch on to things. In fact, one of the major factors that isn't so much a spoiler is that he's thrown into a sort of ""love-triangle"" between two girls that are in love with him, yet he somehow manages not to know. It's not that he wants to keep them in the friend zone or anything, he's just two stupid to realize that they like him. I do not wish to write a review taking hours for me to try and explain the comedy other than ""stupid-funny."" It may be stupid, but you can clearly see that the writer to the anime executed jokes perfectly, in which so much humor can be happening at once that you will miss it.

Now, back on track. This is my rating of Baka & Test, although it is obviously biased because we all, as human beings, have different senses of humor. For the fact that this is one of my favorite animes, I rate this as a bullseye. A straight-up 10/10.

Oh, P.S. as for some who may be wondering about packaging or something on those lines, my copies of Baka & Test came in nearly perfect condition. The cases had ever so slight cracks, but there is no way I would pin that on Amazon. It was likely because of UPS handling. Anyways, aside from the minor cracks in the cases, the disks are flawless, so no worries there.

Now, being as this was rather a long and uneventful review that I doubt many people will find helpful, I would like to thank anyone who decided to read it all the way through. As I basically stated earlier, Baka & Test has great humor with a fun setting, but it all depends on an individuals personal preference as to whether you will like it or not. I will make note that Season 1 IS on Netflix, and I do highly recommend watching it. Me, being the person I am, watched it all online then bought it because I knew I would want to rewatch it, time and time again.",1413936000,,3046,4.2904347826086955

6448520,3,B00KU3Y4P4,"This series is funny as hell! one case where the English dub is way better then the original (for me at least). in a scale of 1 to 10 it's an 8.5 (9 for this collection as it includes the two OVA!)

but this DVD transfer is not good - and I don't know why. It's a short series.

I couldn't watch it on my big screen TV, the picture is pix-elated so much its annoying - on the computer it can be viewed just fine + the font for the subtitles is awful - like something out of the 80's

Maybe this is because it's a 'S.A.V.E.' collection but for this series I would gladly paid 10$ more for a better quality product.",1457049600,,613,3.9274193548387095
6448521,4,B00KU3Y4P4,"Baka & Test is like a mix of everything that makes Anime so great. You have a bunch of interesting characters that, even if cliche (tsundere, clumsy girl, quiet girl), feels like they're real people due to some touching backstories and character development. The comedy is top notch and quite different from other Anime series ,cleverly written slapstick due to jealousy, accidents and sights. No bad puns that won't translate here. And the most important thing: the story is actually interesting.

This season doesn't follow the plot as closely as before, though, and leaves the school grounds quite a bit. You get a beach episode as the very first episode (don't know I feel about that), some onsen episodes later on and then sleepovers. It's not too bad though, as the fanservice isn't overplayed like in other Anime. There are a few episodes dedicated to backstories/flashbacks, and they're all great. The series doesn't progress at all, but we never expected that eiher, so it's more of the same. Enjoyed the first season? You'll love this as well.

About the release itself: it's too bad they only released the DVD version of the show when they used to sell the blu-ray version as well. This is probably because Japanese people rather imported this than buying it locally, which isn't a good thing when the JP release is 250$ vs the american 50$ price. Yahoo Auctions Japan was full of this release after it went out of print in the US, to very reasonable prices (Got mine for 40$). I personally have the blu-ray edition and can say the picture is gorgeous and without any faults.

The DVD version, however, do have some common problems other DVDs have: some pixelating from time to time and minimal noise. Still looks good, but looks much better on blu-ray. What's kinda neat, though, is that they decided to include the OVA, but a bunch of the special features got cut on the DVDs. The blu-ray had several special shorts exclusive to blu-ray and even a spin-off series with five minutes long episode (a total of six). This release doesn't.

It's still a good DVD if you don't find video quality that important. The set is cheap, you get a bunch of great episodes and the entertainment value is high. You can always search youtube for the specials as well. I will pull one star because of the specials omitted, though",1449964800,,2324,4.730864197530864
