8279625,5,B001ATIM1E,"Connie clearly demonstrates how to alter a blouse in this dvd, using two very different models. One model is a young lady and the other is a mature woman. This DVD does not cover the lower half of the body,  just the upper. She mentions a flat behind verses a round one a few times but does not go into the detail of pants making, but rather a blouse that covers that area.

She demonstrates how to alter a pattern for different size busts, for sloping shoulders, aging fluffy arms and different figure types, such as an ""apple"" or full figured one but with different weight distribution.

I have never altered a pattern that much, except to make it longer, since I am tall and thought that I didn't really have ""fitting"" issues.
While watching this I began to realize: I am not so much of an out of the envelope pattern fit as I thought.  For example, sometimes the waist isn't quite in the same place on me as it is on the pattern. And I do get a little bit of gap-osis up by the neck..because one shoulder is higher than the other from carrying a back pack one one side.  Sometimes the sleeve does twist a bit on me...I didn't realize this was something I could fix! Even the young girl with the ""perfect figure"" had small alterations that made the fit look so much better.

The only thing is...she says you can do this with a fitting muslin for yourself, but I really think it would be MUCH easier to use a custom dress form, so you can see the back and draw on it.  Taking your muslin off and on repeatedly, I think it would just be easier to use a custom form instead.
Not just for the back, but for the shoulder and armhole. How would you work on your own armhole without moving your arm, with one free arm?

Fortunately, she has a dvd that instructs you how to make your own custom body form. I watched that too, and it doesn't look that difficult or expensive but would be a very useful tool. Although this dvd was geared towards altering a pattern that was already created, I think it would be very useful for those who are learning to draft.

(The dvd did not mention using this to alter men's patterns).",1237334400,14,2115,4.280701754385965
