7897195,2,6305901481,"THOUGH I AM GLAD TO HAVE WATCHED THIS FILM, FOR IT INTRODUCED ME TO A GAY POET I HAD NOT DISCOVERED, THE FILM ITSELF LEAVES QUITE A BIT TO BE DESIRED.
FOR A POET WHOSE LIFE WAS DEEMED SCANDALOUS, THE PORTRAIT IS FAR TOO TAME.  WHAT ONE GETS IS A HIGH CLASS SISSIFIED DANDY WHO APPARENTLY NEVER WORKED A DAY IN HIS LIFE, WAS MAINTAINED BY HIS FAMILY AND WAS FOND OF BORING CONVERSATIONS WITH HIS EQUALLY BORING GAY FRIENDS. HOMOSEXUALITY IS PRESENTED AS A COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION BETWEEN MEN OF THE UPPER CLASSES AND PROLETARIANS--ALL  THE MORE STRANGE GIVEN THE FACT THAT NAPOLEON WAS AN AVOWED COMMUNIST.  THE SLOW PACING CAN MAKE IT SEEM QUITE AS LONG AS IT IS.
HOWEVER, IT MUST BE WATCHED, IF ONLY ONCE.",1218153600,4,705,4.4921875

7897197,5,6305901481,"In Meteor and Shadow Greek director/writer Takis Spetsiotis has avoided the clichs of the typical film biography. Napoleon Lapathiotis is another hero, less popular, could be importnant for the history of Greece and Europe. Amazing photography. I loved it.",1032307200,,256,5.589743589743589
7897198,5,6305901481,"If u r a fun of historical films that involve the local societies in the European area this is certanly a very good film for you... It is a low-budget film and it has a hint of a very good direction, good play, nice music, excellent story and everyone can like something different. Napoleon Lapathiotis is a person that socked the society of Athens with his wild life. Well, nowadays everyone things that modernisation is everywhere and always was like that.... It is not. This is really a picture from the past century society in South Europe, and beautifull seens from Athens. Classic, yet for people who like this kind of movies!",1029715200,3,632,4.651785714285714
7897199,5,6305901481,"One of the best films I ever saw. Excellent cinematographic Material, cast and play. The film is about the rise and fall of the poet Napoleon Lapathiotis, based on a series of authentic documents and set against the background of major historical events of a very important period of political and social developments in Greece, as well as the influences of European cultural events on our culture. His lifestyle was too much for Athens in the beginning of that century....It will really suprise you.",1028592000,3,500,4.964285714285714
