2660864,5,B000ION2HG,"This video has some overlap with the other excellent videos from Illustra Media, ""The Privileged Planet"" and ""The Mystery of Life"". This video is different because of the personal story of Lee Strobel, former atheist and writer for the Chicago Tribune. It starts with Lee's decision for atheism finallized by the Miller experiment in which amino acids were created in a lab. In a section called ""the Negative Evidence"", Lee debunks this and other faulty experiments and evidences that appear to support Darwinism. Lee finds that the reasons that he became an atheist do not stand on a solid foundation.

Then he takes a look at the ""Positive Evidence"", which is used in the Intelligent Design argument to indicate the necessity for a cosmic designer. One memorable example is an illustration that has a ruler spanning the length of the universe. The claim is that atomic gravity is set with such precision that if it were to strengthen or weaken one inch on this ruler (comparing length of the ruler to strength of gravity), the atom would either collapse on itself or split apart. So what made physics like named in this example, so precise? These arguments need more expansion and examination before they can be brought to conclusion. Lee includes the best argument to date for design, which appears to be the existence of cellular function, complexity, specificity and irreducible complexity. (To those unfamiliar with these terms, this video has an introductory use of most of them)

Overall, it is a little less technical that Illustra's other films, but its purpose is to delve into the human side via personal story. Lee Strobel concludes with how these findings in science are significant to each one of us.",1165363200,20,1715,4.951388888888889

2660910,5,B000ION2HG,"After watching this documentary, most people (and even lots of atheists) will inevitably come to the conclusion that there is a Creator. Now I am not saying that it is necessarily the Creator of the Bible, but something or someone did create this universe. This fine documentary features scientists and experts who in simple terms explain that something cannot come from nothing.

Through math, reason and physics, this documentary shows us that it's almost impossible for the universe to appear just like that. One of the most powerful arguments of this documentary is the fine tuning argument. Even Christopher Hitchens noted in his book that the fine tuning argument is definitely the strongest argument of the other side (the theistic side of course).

Example: imagine giving a dozen monkey typewriters and waiting billions of years in order for them to type out a Shakespeare novel. Well, the probability of that happening is probably one in a trillion! Well, it's the same with the probability of the universe appearing out of nothing.",1443916800,,1042,5.087719298245614

2660925,5,B000ION2HG,"This review covers both his book and the DVD under the same title, which I also purchased for the members of my family that don't have time to read.  To the DVD, I would give a five star rating.  The main part of the documentary covers the information in the book in a condensed format, leaving out any religious opinions that Mr. Strobel might have.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to see how science actually points to the need for a Creator in order to explain life.  The book is good too and contains a lot more information which definitely helped bolster my own belief in a creator, and that life was not an accident, but it also had some issues not present in the DVD.  In chapter 3 of his book, concerning ""Haeckel's Embryos"" no visible proofs were shown regarding the accusation that Haeckel's drawings were inaccurate.  It basically stated that Haeckel was biased on the choice of embryos used, and that he doctored his drawings to make them look more similar than they actually were.  If Haeckel had fudged on his drawings as suggested in this book, then it would have been nice to have been shown what the actual differences were with actual embryo pictures, so we could have been shown how the drawings were biased.  Without proof (in this case pictures), validity of the accusation comes into question.  It would be no different than believing in statements made by evolutionists.  I would have liked proof for the statements made. Chapter 10, of his book was not scientific in nature at all, but really only contained a religious ideology that did not help in presenting the case for a Creator. The DVD was excellent, and I enjoyed his book too, and although I don't agree with some of his religious views.  I did feel that he was honestly trying to present how real scientific evidence does point to a Creator.",1426291200,3,1839,4.610429447852761

2660929,2,B000ION2HG,"Strobel's not much of a thinker. He makes some decision as an adolescent based on one scientific error, and when that error is discovered he flip flops and invests in some mythology. Scientists are often wrong. It hardly justifies embracing goof-ball nonsense. If he wants to mock multiverse conjecture, fine. But it's not particularly honest to simultaneously embrace virgins giving birth, talking animals, and anthropomorphic, disembodied minds that devote energy to making distinctions between beef and pork and have an unsavory interest in what you do with your penis.

If you're a ""believer,"" maybe you'll enjoy this stuff. Perhaps it's intended to bolster christians who hope to be thoughtful about their mythology.

If you're looking for a thoughtful argument in favor of christianity or wondering why reasonably intelligent people believe crazy stuff, look elsewhere. (I'd suggest Michael Shermer's ""Why People Believe Weird Things."" No arguments in favor of god belief there, but some interesting information on human thinking and an array of strange beliefs we embrace.)",1418428800,3,1080,5.5

It is completely compelling and filled with evidence that there is a Creator. At times it is visually stunning and the part about the bacterial flagellum will blow your mind. I guess what I find most interesting is the whole concept of irreducible complexity. To me it looks like there was a designer. This DVD also discusses the fine tuning of the laws of physics and chemistry. I've read most of Lee Strobel's books so it was great to see him express his sense of wonder. This DVD will strengthen your faith. While it is very entertaining it will also show you the way to truth.

2660980,5,B000ION2HG,"This is a review of an adaption of a new York times best-selling book by Lee Strobel, who prominently appears in the book as the narrator to an extent.  I haven't read the book (although I will soon) so I will make one thing clear: I will not put Intelligent Design, Creationism, or anything of the such on trial in this review. I am here to review how the movie presented its view and if it was somewhat successful in its attempts to do so, not to critique the movements themselves.

The movie is divided similarly to the book, with parts focusing on cosmological, physics, biochemistry, and other important tenets to ID. There are also parts relating to Strobel's journey from athieism and Darwinism to Christianity and Intelligent Design, although its less of a focus then his conversion story had been in ""the Case for Christ."" Interviews include those with Jonathan Wells, Stephen C. Meyer, William Lane Craig, and (my personal favorite) Robin Collins. Each put their own ways on the table from Craig's use of Kalaam to other claims regarding how finely tuned the world is and how many of don't seem likely from chance.

One big criticism (this goes for the majority of Lee's books/movies as well) regards how only people with backgrounds regarding Intelligent Design and Christianity were interviewed, and there were no Darwinists or atheists interviewed or even really mentioned. This is not a big deal to me as its adapted from a book FOR Intelligent Design, not ON Intelligent Design. If it had been called ""The case of Intelligent Design"" then this complaint would be more valid, but as it stands now, it seems more of a nitpick then anything.

There's little doubt to me about who will like this movie and who will not. The religious and the ID proponents will devour this and praise God for Lee Strobel. The atheistic and the evolutionists will scoff at what they precieve as sheer ignorance. Again, I'm attempting to be an objective bystander, and for what it's worth, it's great. It has great production values, great interviews, and it makes a good attempt at showing ID for what it is. Again, not everyone will like it, but for what it is, this is one of the most accessible ""cases""",1337126400,,2198,4.731070496083551
2660981,5,B000ION2HG,"This is a very solid presentation of the scientific support for the Christian faith.  I have not seen all of Lee Strobel's videos yet, but this is very well done indeed. (I liked it so much, I purchased the 3 pack he has made available.)  The gentleman started out an atheist, as many of us do, but when his wife turned to the faith, he thought he would give it a serious examination.  And what he found out was that the Christian faith is not at all without support; indeed, the more one examines, the less foundation there seems for atheistic theories and perspectives.  So Mr. Strobel became a Christian, as his wife!  So his quest is here presented: we see Lee going to various universities and colleges, interviewing and researching.  Not overly sophisticated, yet not without depth either; this is a video that will please the general audience.  Highly recommended.",1323561600,6,871,4.728476821192053
2660982,5,B000ION2HG,"Looking at some of the ""poor"" reviews given here, it smacks me that they are not critical reviews of the documentary, they are lash-outs against intelligent design from people who are angered by its mere notion.  People of such bias are not going to be convinced of intelligent design no matter what evidence is presented to them. So much for objectivity.

Since when is a documentary required to present opposing view points?  If you watch a National Geographic documentary about zebras, there is no opposing viewpoint. What is wrong with a documentary with the purpose of making a case for the existence of something doing just that- making a case?  If you are looking for countering perspective, there is nothing stopping you from doing so from other resources.  It is not Lee Strobel's burden to do that for you.  He presents his viewpoint, and there is nothing wrong with that.  The title is afterall, ""The CASE for a Creator"".

So, keeping the review objective, this documentary evaluated as any documentary should be without regard to the subject matter, is exemplary.  The points are well thought out, well presented, and convincing.  The format is exceptional, complex thoughts and ideas are easy to follow, and the graphics and videography are state-of-the-art.

Whether or not the viewer has a bias against intelligent design should not be the basis of an objective review.  This video was interesting, informative, and entertaining, and definitely worth the time to watch.

To jump on the subjectivity bandwagon, I will close with this final thought:  It takes as much faith to believe in the absence of an intelligent designer as it does to believe in one.",1313107200,46,1669,4.978339350180505

2661004,5,B000ION2HG,"This is the best collection of arguments supporting a created universe I have read.  Strobel takes a logical and thorough approach to the topic enlisting the expertise of recognised experts in their respective fields.  I have had agnostic friends read this book, and although not agreeing with every statement in it, have conceded it has well positioned arguments with many valid points.  Each chapter requires some knowledge of that topic e.g. Physics, Astronomy; so not really a introduction to the topic.

In my opinion, it is well suited to agnostic  readers with a strong  scientific background who are genuinely interested in the pro-creator argument.",1304208000,4,657,5.269230769230769

2661006,1,B000ION2HG,"I read the book since many christian apologetics had mentioned him as a good author whom they often cite. Luckily, now I know the best arguments for ""I.D."" and it is still unconvincing.

A few thoughts,

1. There are plenty of transitional fossils.

2. The Miller experiment updated to our present understanding of the early earth's atmosphere actually showed more amino acids created than the original.

3. Just because the original 1859 Darwin tree could have been wrong doesn't disprove his theory. The tree has been updated with new discoveries and is just fine.

4. The big bang was rejected by theists for a long time and now finally, some now accept it happened. It is just a matter of time before evolution is accepted and twisted to somehow match the bible. Or preferably people finally look at science without trying to prove an endpoint before evidence is gathered.

5. The IDers accept the big bang 13.5 billion years ago, but reject evolution through natural selection. What was God doing for the past 13.4999 billion years of the universe before he decided to create humans, twiddling his infinity holy thumbs?

6. Evolution was not created to destroy faith, or to promote selfish, godless materialism. The theory is so widespread today because it is true.

7. Irreducibly complexity is an argumentum ad ignorantiam at best. The examples stated have all been shown to be possible by natural selection. Blood clotting in some fish and whales have fewer proteins than other creatures and still work fine, for example. The flagellum argument was disproven in the mid 90's, I guess Behe hasn't got the memo yet.

8. This book has an incorrect subtitle. This approach is not journalistic or scientific.

9. The universe was not fine tuned for life, life adapted to the conditions that the universe had already. Life adopted to physics, not vice versa.

10. Even though life as on the earth is probably rare, doesn't mean that they are not possible elsewhere, given that there are trillion and trillions of planets.

11. Life doesn't have to be carbon based. The idea that it does is commonly called ""carbon chauvinism"". Just because the earth's life forms are carbon based doesn't mean it is the only way to life. Silicone can be used too.

12. Just because the universe was not created for humans does not mean that life is purposeless and void of meaning. Making your own purpose is much more interesting than following what someone else wants you to live for anyway.

13. Christians did think that the earth was the center of the universe, Copernicus' law did deflate egos. Stating a metaphysical idea of earth being promoted to the heavens after Copernicus is not scientific at all. It is dark aged nonsense.

14. Saying that scientists are apart of a conspiracy to promote the idea of a godless universe is absolutely ridiculous. It should be given the same clout as moon landing deniers, holocaust deniers and 9/11 conspiracy theorists (if even that much clout). Also, this does not say much about the IDers who promote creationism for the sole purpose of proving that we need a god to explain the universes' existence.

15. ""ID"" is seen in the scientific community as pseudo-science, on the lines of science fiction's worst moments, except funnier.

16. Most of the people Strobel interviewed did not have their doctoral work in the fields that they talked about. Most were theologians, which isn't really a proper academic field anyway.

17. Some of the interviewees said that this science has shown that the Judeo-christian god is the one who created the universe. I wonder about the other gods who are also said to have created the universe. Couldn't they all have done it just as well as Yahweh?

18. I actually felt physically sick while trying to read this book, and sincerely hope that people will actually read a real science book instead of reading this frustratingly ignorant and nonscientific nonsense.

Well my twin babies are crying. Got to go, I could go on though...

If you want to be fair as I have attempted to do, and hear the other side of the argument, check out ""why evolution is true"" by Jerry Coyne, Bill Brysons ""A short history of nearly everything"" (which Strobel mentions) or Stephen Hawkins new book ""The Grand Design.""

For those readers who do not know who Lee Strobel is, he is a journalist who spent much of his life as an Atheist. After a two year investigation where he looked into evidence for Christ and Christianity, he ended up becoming a Christian.

I won't rewrite the extensive reviews of others but I will say that this is a very well presented documentary. As someone who is interested in cosmology and the science behind things, this really resonated with me. Mr. Strobel presents scientific evidence and study that shoots about a million holes in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and the origin of life. He also presents an interesting look at how perfectly balanced the universe is all of the way down to the atomic level (if you are not into science, don't worry, things are explained quite well). The visuals are great, actually better than the other two Case For documentaries. This is definitely worth watching, at least to get one thinking. There are a lot of resources out there for the scientific ideas that are presented so you can read further and form your own conclusions if you are not convinced.",1287187200,2,1552,5.747826086956522

His testimonial statement on exactly where he was and what seat in the science lab where he absorbed and committed to the teaching about evolution shows the impact that science classes have on nearly all youth.  Lee's academic and acclaimed professional accomplishments in journalism prepared him to seek the truth. His progressive search resulted in a recanting of evolution from the withering of facts that evolution had falsely propported. The overwhelming discoveries of science that extend from microbiology to astrophysics drew him closer to the conclusion of intelligent design.  The other academic and scientific contributors and their explainations of intelligent design pose the same positive approach to seeking academic freedom and thought of all the evidence available for scientific scrutiny.  Closed and open minded watchers will be perplexed at the stale debate for evolution. Intelligent design wins.",1272240000,,1209,5.44385026737968
2661012,4,B000ION2HG,"Very convincing case you make Mr. Strobel!  And although I'm certainly a layperson (like most if not all of us reviewers here are), I liked your scientific approach to explaining a complex issue that most others don't view scientifically.  While viewing for the first time, I did have some expectation that you would mention others' work such as Simcha Jacobovici (eg, The Exodus Decoded), but this wasn't the case.

Anyway, the only major ""leap"" that I'm inclined to find fault with was your (Stobel's) tendency to use ""creator"" and ""God"" interchangeably.  ""Creator"" and ""God"" (or a ""god"") really isn't the same thing.  Although ""God"" may be how WE view a creator through our own eyes, a creator may not view him/herself as a god.  Perhaps one more segment in your documentary would have been sufficient to address this last issue, I guess for those looking for a god instead of just a creator.",1265068800,,895,4.816993464052287
2661013,2,B000ION2HG,"Just like all the followers of the intelligent design theory, who try to search for the presence of God through science; Lee Strobel takes the same approach through a series of interviews with his guests. As the skeptic that Lee Strobel trys to present himself, I assumed that he would interview experts on both sides and compare their observations, but he sticks to ""experts"" who mostly are Christians and strongly disagree with Darwin's theory. This alone made me admire the other documentary ""Expelled:  No Intelligence allowed"" simply for the fact that those with opposing claims were interviewed.

The statement that man had evolved from monkeys; is not a correct interpretation of Darwin's ideas. Darwin's claim is that both modern monkeys and man evolved from a common primate ancestor. Not that I agree or disagree, but here we need to study the details of Darwin's theory before we start to discredit it. This is the minimal requirement for a scholar in the search for truth. I tried to be patient and watch all discussions, and thank ""the creator"" that the document ended. I still can't get over the discussion of the Evidence of Consciousness and how evolution can't explain consciousness or free will. Please keep in mind that consciousness is a relatively new research area and proving or disproving of evolution doesn't mean an intelligent designer is the only answer. If we want to discuss science, the least we can do is provide scientific evidence to substantiate our claim. The lack of evidence doesn't prove much. I guess that's why faith is called faith; you simply can't create enough scientific evidence to make people believe in God.

Even though the arguments simply address the claim that a creator of some sort must exist, but after investigating Mr. Strobel's other work the viewer can safely conclude that the creator that Mr. Strobel is referring to is a Christian God. Man, all other humans who believe in a creator (not a certain religion) are doomed now:( At least we should be very thankful for Mrs. Strobel's conversion to Christianity that enabled this work of rare genius.

I try not to judge based on looks, so I watched the entire DVD and concluded that Mr. Strobel is not smarter than he looks. Don't take my word for it, and watch for yourself.  It is interesting to  see how people with different logic than us operate. Very interesting!",1262304000,8,2378,4.88833746898263

My eye can't function without its lens, but there are more primitive eyes that work without one.  The ""motor"" of a flagellum wouldn't work minus one of its components, but it most likely came from a more primitive organ that served a more primitive purpose.  Just like my eye.

2661026,1,B000ION2HG,"First, of all Strobel attempts to refute Darwin, without properly defining evolution .

""In a world of stable populations where each individual must struggle to survive, those with the ""best"" characteristics will be more likely to survive, and those desirable traits will be passed to their offspring. These advantageous characteristics are inherited by following generations, becoming dominant among the population through time. This is natural selection. It may be further inferred that natural selection, if carried far enough, makes changes in a population, eventually leading to new species. These observations have been amply demonstrated in biology, and even fossils demonstrate the veracity of these observations""

The theory of Evolution cannot not be used to explain phenomena such as the big-bang ( the origin of the universe) or abiogenesis (the origin of life). And while it is true there maybe some point of contention in the scientific community regarding how both the universe started and how life began, it should be understood that there is virtually no dispute among the scientific community regarding theory of evolution. Around 99% of scientists with advanced degrees believes in evolution.

Strobel can sidestep the overwhelming body of evidence that suggests evolution is a fact all he wants, but he pays a price. His argument is a straw man; plain and simple.

if Strobel wants to make ""A Case"" he needs to use some real facts

*Embryology is very powerful evidence for evolution
*The Fossil record is very powerful evidence for evolution
*DNA evidence is very powerful for evolution ( For instance, the DNA evidence that we humans evolved from a primate is overwhelming. Look at the scientific reports that clearly show Human Chromosome 2 is a fusion of two ancestral chromosomes)

And it's the synergy of various disciplines is what makes the theory of evolution so strong. With strobel mainly using his high school biology class as reference--it follows this book does not attempt to generate any real intellectual arguments against the theory of evolution

Funny, how strobel offers no ""Case for a creator"" to explain the best evidence for evolution. So Strobel has no case.

Strobel is a misguided individual, who should understand that evolution does not, by any means, prove or disprove a God. He is by every account an intellectual light weight, a lair ---or most likely he is both a lair and an idoit.

2661029,5,B000ION2HG,"The keys to understanding the Bible are in the first 3 chapters of Genesis. If you don't understand these chapters,you'll never be able to accurately understand the Bible. People today are atheists because they have not understood the Bible or even attempted to read it.

Man was to be God over this earth Genesis 1:26-28..But the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden brought Spiritual and physical death. The moment they ate of the fruit they died of spiritual death separated from God our creator. We were all born to have a relationship with God for all eternity,we were never meant to die. So after fall all future generations would be born into that same sin also separated from God. God couldn't just start over because he had given man dominion over this earth and God is a God of his word he can't take it back or otherwise he wouldn't be a God we could trust. God immediately kicked Adam and Eve out of the Garden otherwise they would had eaten off the Tree of Life and we would of had to live in the state were in without ever dying of physical death and forever separated from God. Satan was trying to get to that tree of life.

See man's body gives him authority on earth. Satan tapped into man's authority by using the body of a serpent. He tempted Eve through the serpent and caused Adam to commit high treason. The only way Satan could get to the tree of life was to get Adam to sin and become subordinate to him, for Adam was the God of this world. After Adam became subordinate to Satan, Satan became his lord. Whatever Adam could tap into naturally, satan could have. Satan was trying to get Adam to tap into the tree of life. But God was smarter than that.! He put Adam out of the Garden to stop that from coming to pass!

God began devising his plan for man's redemption God had to find a way to get back on earth legally unlike Satan who got here illegally.
God started forming covenants with Noah first than Abraham. To make a long story short.... God sent his son to mend that relationship if we only believe in Jesus.

We are spirit beings having a physical experience. But a lot people don't believe it because they died of Spiritual death separated from God. When Jesus came he promised if we believed in him and asked for forgiveness we would have eternal life again and he would send the Holy Spirit to live in our heart and show us how to live the way we were meant to live. That was the main purpose of God sending his son was to buy us back from spiritual death. You can't truly know the depth of this without meditating in Gods word and get and few good Christian Books....

2661055,1,B000ION2HG,"Not only does this DVD contain many factual errors oft repeated in his other works, the author seems unaware of recent science results that answer his questions.

* Strobel says there is no evidence of a common origin of life.  This flies in the face of mounds of evidence from genetics, molecular clocks, fossil morphology, and embryology.
* Michael Behe describes Intelligent Design and the bacterial flagellum (yes, again). The same Behe that was massively discredited in the Dover, PA court case in which the judge described ""breathtaking inanity"" and said defendants ""lied outright under oath on several occasions.""  Ken Miller, an actual scientist, has handily explained the flagellum since then.  Behe is 20th century.
* Strobel trots out a 1953 study by Miller to re-create initial life conditions. Since then, there have been much more accurate and productive versions of this experiment which he ignores.
* Jay Richards trots out the ""Privileged Planet"" bias. He won't ask ""why is the Moon locked so we can't see the back side?"" ""Why are most of the stars so far away that they are not visible w/o very powerful telescopes?""  Why is most of the radiation not in our visible range?""
* Jonathan Wells demonstrates his poor biology understanding by saying if you squish a cell, then put the parts back together and they don't produce a living cell, this discredit's Miller's work. As a member of Sun Myung Moon's cult (a Korean who says he's Jesus), maybe this weak argument shouldn't surprise.
* Stroble references the Scientific Dissent from Darwinism, which has been criticized for being inaccurate, misleading, yet suggests at most 1 out of every 10,000 ""scientists"" don't embrace evolution.
* We are told that since there is a Big Bang (which would seem to conflict with Genesis), it must have a cause, and that cause must be a divine creator, but doesn't say who created the creator. He ignores that the Big Bang might be a ""crunch"" leftover from another universe collapsing; maybe it's not a beginning.
* The ""fine tuning"" issue is mentioned, but not without bias.
* Guillermo Gonzalez explains the Drake Equation, and is evidently unaware of the Anthropic Principle.
* We are told there is ""information"" in DNA, thus a creator. But there is information in snowflakes, and layers of sediment. Do these demand a creator?

It's sad that much of this DVD is presented as ""science"".  The ""science consultant"" listed at the end is not a scientist, but rather has a PhD in theology. No surprise.",1241481600,23,2503,4.9170616113744074

2661057,2,B000ION2HG,"In the DVD, The Case for a Creator, Lee Strobel asserts that recent scientific discoveries now provide impressive new evidence for believing in God. He points to the complexity of our universe; a complexity he believes is best explained by the existence of a divine Creator. He claims that science has led him back to God.

Strobel is a strong supporter of ""intelligent design"" as conceptualized by the Discovery Institute in Seattle, an institution best known for its advocacy of intelligent design and its campaign to teach creationist, anti-evolution beliefs in public high school science classes. He asserts that intelligent design is science.

In this DVD Strobel outlines his case for intelligent design. He is an intelligent and articulate presenter, and the impressive graphics used in this DVD enhance his message. However, the viewer should focus on the merits of his case and remember he is presenting only one side of the intelligent design issue. He is advocating an anti-evolution and pro-intelligent design position and interviewing only individuals who support those views. Before reaching any conclusions about his case for a creator, it would be prudent for the viewer to consider alternative perspectives.

Let's see what happens, for example, when Strobel's ideas are brought into a real courtroom where evidence is presented, expert witnesses are called in support of other viewpoints, and his expert witnesses are subject to cross-examination. How do his ideas hold up under such conditions? Does his case have merit?

Rather than deal with a hypothetical situation, we can deal with a real court case, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District (2005). In this case, the concept of intelligent design as science was put on trial. Here are some of the findings of the judge.

1. Intelligent design is not science, and is grounded in theology, not science.
2. Intelligent design cannot be adjudged a valid, accepted scientific theory as it has failed to publish in peer-reviewed journals, engage in research and testing, and gain acceptance in the scientific community.
3. Professor Behe's (one of Strobel's expert witnesses) claim for ""irreducible complexity"" has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large.
4. The theory of evolution represents good science, is overwhelmingly accepted by the scientific community, and in no way conflicts with, nor denies, the existence of a divine creator.
5. Darwin's theory of evolution is imperfect. However, the fact that a scientific theory cannot yet render an explanation on every point should not be used as a pretext to thrust an untestable alternative hypothesis grounded in religion into the science classroom or to misrepresent well-established scientific propositions.
6. The teaching of intelligent design in public school science courses violates the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

These findings lead to the conclusion that Strobel's anti-evolution and pro-intelligent design claims are not based on sound science but rather on religious dogma.",1238284800,8,3095,5.410788381742739

At first, I realized when watching this that the scientist interviewed were all members of the ""think tank"" known as the Discovery Institute (lost at the Dover trial because Intelligent Design was not considered a legitimate science, but religion disguised as science). Immediately I knew that this video would be less than convincing.

Lee Strobel is a great writer and defender of his faith, but this video was so anti-science it was not even a laughing matter for me. The video tried to refute the theory of evolution (which it failed to do so), demonstrated that the so-called ""scientist"" were not very well aware of current scientific studies or literature, and failed to show any comprehension of basic scientific principles. I sent the video over to a friend of mine with a B.S. in Biology and he agreed that this was Discovery Institute propaganda and mislead the viewer on what science is about. In a time where most children do not fully understand science and America is lagging behind in scientific advancements, I figure Mr. Strobel would be interested in portraying correct science. Unfortunately, I was sadly mistaken. This is a faith suicide video in the fact that if you tie your faith into believing this garbage, your faith will crumble when faced with the facts. In a time where scientific understanding needs to increase, this video will help to keep many Americans tucked away in the dark.

2661059,4,B000ION2HG,"'The Case For A Creator' is an excellent documentary on intelligent design.

It is based upon the book with the same title by investigative journalist Lee Strobel. The road to belief in a Creator for Strobel came the same way that his earlier reliance on evolution/naturalism did - through science.

In his younger years, he was convinced of the truth of Darwinism primarily due to the widely touted (and more recently discredited) Stanley Miller experiment. Some of the things covered here include the more recent discoveries that have debunked Miller. In his search for the truth, Strobel investigated many areas of science and came to the conclusion that intelligent design is supported by lots of science and that many pillars of naturalism are also weakened by science.

Other items that are highlighted include: the Cambrian Explosion, biological machines, cosmology, physics, and DNA. Strobel interviews leading scientists in various fields throughout this film to present his case.

Although this will not convince those who are blinded by a religious fervor for Darwinism, it will provide lots of food for thought for those who have open minds and are willing to challenge some of their assumptions. This does not have all of the answers as it is just 60 minutes long. If it has one weakness it is that it is so short. I hope that Mr. Strobel will consider doing a much longer version.

It creates a powerful case, but doesn't bog you down in the details (which for those interested are available in more depth on Illusta Media's other videos). Very sharp, well-presented, and succinct. I like Steve Meyer's statements and choice of words, which pack a whallop. And he hits the nail on the head by noting the difference between an argument that has a religious motivation, and an argument that has a religious implication in its conclusion. Evolutionists are always confusing the two. The arguments presented in The Case for a Creator are weighty, and only those with an anti-God bias will take exception to the observational evidence presented that strongly implies a creator. The difficulty that evolutionists will have with this video is the temptation of closed-mindedness to new ideas, because change is difficult to accept. It can even be seen in the negative Amazon.com reviews this video has received - how evolutionists must resort to the logical fallacy of ad-hominem attacks, by claiming the video is faith-based, rather than scientifically refuting any of the points presented. But no evolutionist has ever proffered any good observational evidence that proves that life WAS NOT designed. And herein lies the problem: Things really look an awful lot like they were designed. Even the brilliant late Francis Crick stated that biologists must continually remind themselves that what they see was not designed. Why did he say this? Because everything looks like it was designed! Piltdown man is a good example of how the evolutionary paradigm blinds observers to where the evidence is really leading. And just as it took a long time for people to get over their belief that the world was flat or that life can spontaneously spring from rotten meat, this video exposes how evolutionists will go down fighting to the end to prop up their crumbling theory. Even to the point of clinging to logic-defying arguments, such as the concept of multiple universes, which this video exposes as a last-ditch effort to rescue chance from the overwhelming odds against it. True story - a biology prof at Macomb County College in Michigan is currently teaching his malleable freshman class that ""evolution is fact because it has never been disproven,"" and if you don't believe in evolution, then you don't believe in science.

I watched in this video to see the scientific evidence for or against intelligent design and I was amazed how much the scientific evidence supports intelligent design. This video logically discusses how the various fields of science supports and confirms intelligent design. The idea of ""irreducible complexity"" explains how even simple living cells cannot be a result of a random process. There is such beautiful design, complexity and architecture in every aspect of the human body from muscles to blood cells to bone to skin that challenges the theory of a random chance of events. Even something as simple as the disc within the spine has such intricate engineering and perfect architecture that it clearly points to an incredible creator.

I highly recommend this video to anyone- the skeptic, the agnostic, the atheist and also the Christians. I was looking for something scientific and something logical and this video fulfills both. Enjoy.",1210204800,30,1363,5.0265486725663715
2661080,5,B000ION2HG,"What I LOVE about this video is that it provides amazing (and in my view, irrefutable) evidence that points to a Divine Creator.  For so long, it has seemed that the Darwinian theory has been the stronger argument (even though it is erroneous and full of holes, some of which even Darwin himself was aware of)... but this blows the whole thing wide open!

For anyone who is interested in studying Christian apologetics or to just have some solid evidence to support your belief and/or faith in God, please check out this video.  I have been very encouraged by what I learned and the path that led Lee Strobel (a former atheist) to belief in God... to the point that his whole mission in life is now to help others do the same.

This is GREAT video for any of you who are proponents of Darwin's theories... because if you TRULY value keeping an open mind, this is the compelling ""other side of the argument"" that you don't often hear.  I hope that you'll choose to watch this and to come to your own conclusions afterward.",1208908800,21,1021,4.467741935483871

For anyone who doesn't believe in God you have got to see this DVD. Like Lee Strobel said, it actually requires more faith not to believe then to believe in the existence of a creator (Our God). A lot of work and research was put into this work and it's well worth it. All you have to do is see for yourself and decide at the end where you stand. Life changing!",1204243200,4,522,5.5375
2661082,1,B000ION2HG,The only reason I rated this DVD so low is that the person receiving the gift was unable to watch it.  He is hearing impaired.  The DVD does not offer or allow for closed captioning.  The DVD is being returned. It has not been viewed.,1204070400,16,234,4.155555555555556

2661094,4,B000ION2HG,"I enjoyed the information in the video. However, it seemed like an overview of the material in ""The Privelaged Planet"" and ""Unlocking the Mystery of Life"", which both go into greater detail according to their fields. It is worth watching and has been added, along with the others, to my personal library.",1200096000,9,304,4.865384615384615
2661095,5,B000ION2HG,"The Case for a Creator DVD is very informative and a great tool for those who are interested in this Creation VS Darwinian Evolution debate.  This DVD is based off of Lee Strobel's book The Case for a Creator.  This DVD discusses the Stanley Miller experiment, he fossil record, the Kalam Cosmological Argument, the fine tuning of the universe, and Irreducible Complexity.  These are all good arguements for a creator.  Due to the fact that the DVD runs for about 60 min. it only covers each of these arguements rather briefly and at times a bit overly simplistic.  However, it does a great job of getting the point across and  building a great case of the main point which is the evidence of a creator.
It is important that one realizes that this DVD is an I.D.(Intelligent Design) DVD and not a biblical Creationist one.  Therefore, the only knock on the DVD would be that it never identifies who God or the ""Creator"" is.  That being said, I still believe the DVD accomplishes what it was intended to accomplish.
To those who are familiar with the I.D. Movement or Creation Science, this DVD will probably not provide any new arguements that you have not heard before but still provides a great overall summary of some of the more common arguments used.  As for those who are just beginning to study the subject, this is a great introductory tool.  The information presented in this DVD is not difficult to understand and is broken up into parts so that the viewer can take in the information in peices or watch the entire DVD at once.
If one has seen the DVDs put out by the I.D. Movement, A Privledged Planet and Unlocking the Mystery of Life, this is basically a summary of both with a few other key points.  The DVD's just mentioned go into much deeper detail but are also a bit more technical.
Overall this is a great DVD and I recommend it to all.",1198800000,4,1855,4.507462686567164
2661096,5,B000ION2HG,"This book is for those willing to an open minded discussion. It shows how one man went from being an atheist to being a Christian believer. It follows Lee Strobel in his search for truth after being challenged as to the lack of evidence for his atheism.
  It would be very good for high school students taking Biology and questioning what is found in most text books. The book is as good as the DVD and a good companion to the DVD.",1196035200,4,431,4.2439024390243905

2661101,5,B000ION2HG,"Pretty good video.
Lee goes around and interviews various people regarding the arguments for the existence of God. I have to admit that the does good job, and the arguments are short, concise, clear, and convincing. Some philosophical arguments are very old, while scientific (i.e. irreducible complexity) is newer.
I wonder greatly WHY nobody celebrated on the idea of ""irreducible complexity"" before Behe? It seems SO obvious!! When you listen to it, you say... 'it seems like I always knew it, it's so obvious'.

IF you wearing pink glasses of naturalistic dogmatism -
THEN avoid this video, since it may disturb you.

IF you open to see what's up with this ""intelligent design movement"" -
THEN watch it with no preconceived assumptions and you may actually come to know about God.

IF you are a believer -
THEN watch this video to build up your faith.",1187654400,91,855,4.842465753424658
