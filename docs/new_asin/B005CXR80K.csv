He is hired to secure Samson's lost hair brush before its powers are used to carry out a scheme to control both sides of Niagra Falls. His longtime nemesis Professor Ratan is behind this plan and can Cuke learn courage being faced by a bully?

In the Search for Noah's Umbrella Cuke is off in search of a mysterious umbrella that was associated with Noah's Ark. A clever villain wants to steal it and its power for his own selfish gain. Cuke must find the courage to face his fears in order to win!

It's a fun movie and my 4 year old enjoys it. The stories sound silly but it's fun. It's also nice to have one DVD with 2 stories which helps to save some money.",1420675200,,977,4.327868852459017

The shipping was quick and the disc plays great.",1332115200,,293,4.140350877192983
