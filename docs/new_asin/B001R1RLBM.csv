8337143,4,B001R1RLBM,"This miniseries took one of Dominic Dunne's juiciest novels and mounted it with a stellar cast (Rebecca De Mornay, Jason Robards, Peter Gallagher). What happens to the girl the rich man doesn't protect? When she's left at the mercy of his wife? De Mornay, who proved herself a capable actress in 'The Hand that Rocks the Cradle' and a likable comedienne in 'Feds' has  here a sad vulnerability combined with sexiness that marked Marilyn Monroe's best work. The production is sumptuous, Jill Eikenberry is chilling, and Peter Gallagher is an appealing narrator with his own troubles. It doesn't stop him from caring about a friend that the world treats like a toy. Sure, it's soap opera...but it's excellent of its type. Check it out.",1377993600,,733,4.911290322580645
