8085667,5,B000BDHEIM,"The concert is great, but there's tons of bonus features.  Unfortunately some artifacts though due to the DVD compression.  But if you're a fan, it's a must have.  My favorite is either ""The Breakup Of LUZER"" short film or Dan Seeth's ""5 Steps To Stay Home Sick"".  Classic stuff, and a great concert.",1127001600,,300,4.60377358490566
