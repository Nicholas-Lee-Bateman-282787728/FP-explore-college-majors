485785,4,6302610648,"It almost ranks up with ""Jumpin Jacks"" and ""Artists and Models."" I think this movie had a stronger plot then some of their other ones. It's also great hearing Lewis doing his other voices, like when  he's ""talking big"" to Shorty, and when he ""talks to  himself"" with the mirror. I love the Enchilada Man song he does with  Carmen Miranda too!

485822,5,6302610648,"I've searched high and low for this movie for quite sometime and was at my wit end trying to find it. I love all of Jerry Lewis movies. I've been watching his movies since I was knee high to a duck and of all his movies, (solo and with Dean) ""Scared Stiff"" is my all-time funniest favorite. This movie (besides the ""Nutty Professor"") is one of the rare greats of that era and I'm glad to have a copy I can call my own. Excellent movie for a great price.",1375833600,,453,4.044444444444444

The quality of the VHS image was still perfect.  Over all--good buy and good retailer.",1291334400,,366,4.402985074626866
485825,4,6302610648,"This is probably Jerry and Dean's best movie.  The plot was very good and the musical numbers were short but fun.  The final 15-20 minutes in the haunted castle are the funniest, without giving away the scene.  It is a must for any J&D movie buff's.",1229385600,,249,4.369565217391305
485826,3,6302610648,"""Scared Stiff"" is a remake of a 1940s Bob Hope comedy called ""The Ghost Breakers"" which was directed by George Marshall, who also happened to direct this version as well.

 I'm just going to jump right into the flaws of the film. First of all I'd just like to say Bob Hope, was one of my favorite comedians. Hope had a natural gift for comedy. His delivery for handling a one-liner has only only been matched by Groucho Marx. There was something about the sound of his voice, his breezy attitude, his facial expressions that made jokes that were really not that funny work. Only Bob Hope could tell a ""Bob Hope joke"". And in ""Scared Stiff"" the script follows ""The Ghost Breakers"" verbatim. Martin and Lewis shift positions on playing the Bob Hope character. Martin though is given most of the lines Hope delivered in the orginal movie. Now under normal circumstances I would never dream of comparing Dean Martin and Bob Hope. They were two completely different personalities who made people laugh in different ways. But because Martin is taking on a role Hope played comparisons will be made. Especially when Martin delivers the jokes. Martin quite simply can not handle the one-liners the way Hope did. I never thought the original was terribly funny but Hope made it work. Martin, whom we should remember was the straight man of the team, can not deliver these jokes correctly. The best jokes in the film are the ones that were written for the movie because now it is taking advantage of the chemistry between the team. It is playing on their personalities.

 Now I said I don't think the original was very funny, and I'll stand by that. But I think the movie was worth seeing because Hope and Goddard had such a presence to them that they made the movie work. That is exactly way I'm recommending this movie. You should see it because of Martin and Lewis. They make the movie watchable.

 Some connections between these two movies are, in the Hope version his name was Larry L. Lawrence, the L standing for Lawrence. In this movie Dean Martin's name is Larry Todd, but Lewis' name is Myron M. Mertz, the M standing for Myron. Goddard's character name was Mary Carter, in this version Lizabeth Scott plays the part and her name is Mary Carroll.

 I also mentioned the dialogue is verbatim, but some jokes have been changed, sadly they were Hope's best jokes. When a character decsribes what a zombie is, a lifeless person without any thought who doesn't care about his actions, Hope respondes with ""you mean like Democrats?"". It is a classic Hope line. In this movie after the description of a zombie is given Jerry Lewis says ""just like husbands"". I'll let you decide if the joke works.

 ""The Ghost Breakers"" also did a better job of creating atmosphere. ""Scared Stiff"", in the beginning, doesn't make much use of its surroundings and doesn't create any suspense, though I suppose anyone who watches this movie is mainly doing so for the laughs.

 But I'm mostly giving reasons why not to see this movie, so lets talk about why you should see it. As I said Martin and Lewis are fun to watch, at times, and it is because of them people will want to see this movie in the first place. If two unknown actors had appeared in it I doubt there would be any interest at all in this movie. Plus if your a fan of Martin's singing there are a lot of songs in here. I found it odd looking back at the team that so many people felt if they broke up Martin would be finished, that it was Lewis who was the real star of the team. But oh well.

 Bottom-line: Not better than the Bob Hope version but has some good moments. Martin and Lewis are basically both playing the Hope character, but mostly it is Martin. Worth seeing if you are a fan of the team.",1120348800,12,3743,4.501474926253687
485827,4,6302610648,"Martin and Lewis teamed again in 1953 for this fun comedy horror that is somewhat of a remake of Bob Hope's Ghostbreakers.  martin plays nightclub singer Larry Todd and Lewis is busboy Myron Mertz who flee a murder charge to a mysterious caribbean island inherited by wealthy heiress Mary Carroll.  There's some genuinely spooky set pieces and scenes in the film although the horror element fades quickly when Dean stars singing.  It's just not a great mix i guess.  Lewis does well treading on ground set forth by many earlier comedy stars including the Three Stooges and Abbott & Costello and is his usual, manic, slapstick self.  One only wishes there were a bit more horror than song to the film but I guess Dean had to have his requisite numbers in the movie.

Also on the plus side is that it was directed by George Marshall who was the best director that Maring and Lewis had had up until that point and had directed such films as ""Destry Rides Again"", Hold that Blonde"", as well as the film that this was essentially a remake of, ""Ghostbreakers"".  He moves the film along at a nice pace.  Still not Martin and Lewis' best film but really pretty good.",1110499200,4,1158,4.5603864734299515
485828,5,6302610648,"The reason why I found this particular Martin and Lewis film 100% pleasing is because it not only incorporates classic M&L antics, jokes and over-the-top characterizations of both men, it also includes a steady storyline that is easy and entertaining to follow. Although the seldom dull storyline is due to the already established original film ""Ghost Breakers"" the film is quite worth viewing for any M&L fan, especially since most plots of M&L films are slightly less stable. Therefore, along with such M&L films as ""The Stooge"" and ""My Friend Irma"" (which the exception of M&L not being 'headliners' in their first film), ""Scared Stiff"" is a M&L essential. However, for less entusiastic fans of the comedy team, the original ""Ghost Breakers"" release may seem to deserve more credit; personally, having not seen the original film in addition to my neverending admiration for M&L, ""Scared Stiff"" is a wonderful addition to my M&L video collection.",1028419200,7,948,5.122580645161291
485829,1,6302610648,"This movie is a remake of a 1947 Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard movie, Ghost Breakers.  Not only is the plot identical, many of the lines are exactly the same.  What worked with Bob Hope deliviering the one liners and playing off of the attractive and suprisingly stalwart Paulette Goddard does work well with the sophisticated Martin and inane Lewis.
If you are looking for a fun movie to watch with the family, try the original, Ghost Breakers with Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard.  Unless you are a big time Martin & Lewis fan, Scared Stiff is best left on the shelf",1005696000,6,566,4.529411764705882
485830,5,6302610648,"""Scared Stiff"" though less mysterious, when it should be, than ""Ghost Breakers"" is a classic Martin and Lewis Comedy.  Dean Martin is the usual smooth-talking, girl watching, under booked singer Larry Dodd teamed up with his clumsy fried Myron M. Mertz. Larry has a misunderstanding with a mob leader and Myron tries to defend Larry by taking a visit to the ganster's hotel.  When Larry finds out and realizes the danger Myron is in goes to the hotel as well to try to save his friend.  This is when the fun begins.  Murder, mystery, witch craft and zombies all make for a delightfully funny movie.  Be sure to count the many stars who appear in the film.  Earl Haldeman [sic]as the elevator operator, Percy Helton, Carmen Miranda, Dorothy Malone (Peyton Place) and many more.  This is a true value.  Be sure to buy ""Ghost Breakers"" with Bob Hope.",996796800,12,847,4.675675675675675
485831,5,6302610648,"This is a fine piece of entertainment. The family loved this film. Martin and Lewis put their spin on the Bob Hope Ghost Breakers remake called Scared Stiff. It is a pretty good remake but with some differences. Jerry is a hoot as always! The only comparisons I found not to be as good as Ghost Breakers is the zombie, he was not as spooky in Scared Stiff but still it was good! I also preferred Paulette Goddard from Ghost Breakers over Lizabeth Scott (Scared Stiff). Both films are great. Scared Stiff has some things I liked better and so does Ghost Breakers. Get em both, you'll go Bonkers!!  My daughter just laughs and laughs at Jerry Lewis playing Myron Myron as he does all his antics and silly voice. I highly recommend this film (Scared Stiff) as another great Spooky Comedy!! My favorite parts are:  Jerry Lewis shows you how a zombie acts and then when Jerry gets scared it's fun to see his expression on his face. When Jerry does the Carmen Miranda imitation is a Hoot!!  Ah and don't forget the surprise at the end!!",992995200,8,1030,4.468085106382978

7827979,2,6302610648,"Lackluster, overlong remake of Bob Hope's ""The Ghost Breakers"" awkwardly retooled for Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. ""Scared Stiff"" (1953) emerges as one of the duo's lesser comedies  occasionally enlivened by the welcome presence of Carmen Miranda (in her final film) and Dino's memorable rendition of ""I Don't Care If the Sun Don't Shine."" Despite the guiding hand of director George Marshall, most of Dean and Jerry's routines fall surprisingly flat. Sultry co-star Lizabeth Scott is a good sport through it all.",1475020800,,513,5.2560975609756095

It was always in a collection of other Martin and Lewis items, and I wasn't interested in them.  I purchased a combo so I would transfer my VHS tapes onto a DVD and found out when I got this movie that my new combo, the VHS wasn't working correctly.
