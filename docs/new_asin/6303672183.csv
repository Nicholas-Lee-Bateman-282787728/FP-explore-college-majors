Really teaches you that a gift, as they say, is not the size, nor the shape, nor the color, nor the value. It's not what you give, but HOW you give it and when you give it out of love, you're helping that spirit grow. Yes, it's storybook style animation but I don't care, it gives it a charm and most of all, teaches what Christmas is really about and of course a wonderful appreciation to the Poinsettia; the Christmas Flower. Wonderful special and highly recommend it for families, churches, and Catholic schools!",1482710400,,640,4.525862068965517
