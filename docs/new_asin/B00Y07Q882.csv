7204783,5,B00Y07Q882,"Manon Lescaut's production was updated and it worked.  Highly professional production with two of the best performances I've ever witnessed in any opera.  By the end of the third act I was crying and by the end of the fourth act I could not stop the tears.  These two can not only sing up a storm they act one as well.  This is the best Manon Lescaut I've ever seen and hope the upcoming one at the Met is as good.  It truly was thrilling.  Kaufmann and Opolais were unbelievably fantastic and the orchestra was superb.  Pappano is the kind of maestro you want to sing for as he coaches as in the old days of maestros like Levine, etc.  This is highly recommended as a keeper!
I do tend to agree with other comments about the production; especially in Act 2, but the singing and acting overcame the dumb action which the director obviously wanted.  I guess I'm getting so used to lousy productions that I rarely disparage them anymore as Zeffirelli isn't creating any new ones and I'm a fan of all of his old ones.

I approach opera with the following criteria 1) the best singers that I love to hear, see and who can act as well; 2) a favorite opera; 3) great orchestra and conductor 4) costumes 5) production and sets.  Obviously, I'm thrilled with this version of Manon Lescaut as it has my 1-3 priorities, so 4 and 5 can be overlooked and discounted.  Having seen scenes from the Munich version with Opolais and Kaufmann - believe me, this is 100% better.  That production is so gross it was impossible to overlook the absolute junk and obscenities with a concept impossible to even credit with the word ""concept"".  The only other Lescaut worth having (I do have) is the Domingo/TeKanawa which I have loved for years but this is a great addition to my collection due to the outstanding singing and acting of the principals.  The music is glorious throughout.

It now seems that pop culture has invaded the opera world and productions are so lacking all over the world that we are forced to ""overlook"" the vulgarities, lack of class and beauty that made opera the premier entertainment in years gone by.  Classy productions are extremely rare, even at the Met.  Royal Opera, however, does better with their productions.  ""Eurotrash"" seems the order of the day in most opera houses as in the trash heap of American television and movies.  Too bad the singers can't say ""no"" to stupid productions as in days gone by.

7204784,5,B00Y07Q882,"Thrilling performance of Puccini's pot-boiler.
It took me some time to make up my mind should I, or should I not buy this production. I am glad that I did. It is superb, absolutely first rate. The cast could hardly have been bettered; that also goes for the smaller roles. The combination Kaufmann/Opolais is truly unbeatable. They are outstanding as Manon and des Grieux. Their voices blend beautifully, the acting is extraordinary, as is rarely seen in opera. The ROH Orchestra under Antonio Pappano is a joy to listen to. Precise, forceful, tender where required, Maestro Pappano takes great care not to outdrown his singers.

I am not a fan of modern opera stagings, but I must say that Manon is among the few exceptions that lend themselves well to modern interpretation.
Although---- it does skirt the edges of good taste precariously here and there in the second act. No matter, I still love it!",1451260800,4,902,4.819354838709677
7204785,5,B00Y07Q882,"The young Latvian soprano, Kristine Opolais, was a revelation in the opera Rusalka and her performance was rightly hailed by the press as ""one of the most vivid and striking accomplishments seen on an opera stage in a long time"" (Vienna's leading daily Der Standard). She has a supple and velvety voice, a captivating physical beauty and a hauntingly moving stage presence. As for Jonas Kaufmann, in 2013 he won the Opera Award for Best Male Opera Singer and the Gramophone Award for Wagner Arias. In 2014 The New York Times described Kaufmann as ""the most important, versatile tenor of his generation"". Therefore, the presence of these two great singers in the opera Manon Lescaut make this work an incomparable treasure that should be present in the collection of all lovers of enjoyable opera.",1448323200,10,796,4.947761194029851

7204787,3,B00Y07Q882,"These comments are not a review of this release, but relate only to the sound.

In Puccini you expect visceral satisfaction from the singing, which is excellent here. However, when I turn the volume loud enough to get my dose of visceral satisfaction from the voices, particularly Der Jonas, the orchestra blasts way too much. This is a common problem with blu-rays from the ROH. I understand this is a natural representation of the house acoustic, and Der Jonas' voice (gorgeous though it is) does not have much ping (squillo). However, if he can ride over the orchestra easily in blu-rays from the huge MET, then the sound engineers or the set designers should be able to find a solution for the ROH.

One comment about the singing - am I the only one who hears that Der Jonas sounds here at the upper limit of what is advisable vocally? He barely makes it through ""Guardate, Pazzo Io Son"" and sounds over-parted in that piece (frankly, he shouts it).",1445040000,22,953,4.633136094674557

7204815,2,B00Y07Q882,"I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 120"" screen and listen through a 7.2 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart and the surround / surround back speakers are placed where they ought to be. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls and ceiling. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.

My collection includes the Teatro alla Scala production under Muti with Guleghina/Cura from 1998 and I thought it was time to upgrade with a more recent version. I like Kaufmann, so I gave it a chance despite a few negative reviews regarding the sound. Unfortunately, they were right.

Menu allows to choose sound track and subtitles without having to resort to the pop-up key, there is no problem with Region coding with my player.
Picture is fine as usual, lighting could sometimes be better.
Sound is DTS 5.0 HD according to the box, my receiver says 5.1, which it then converts into 7.2.

Orchestra is recorded quite detailed, may be a touch emphasizing the left over the darker instruments on the right. Sound stage is pretty much 180 degrees, no complaint there. Chorus is recorded O.K. when it is on the ground floor, it is a bit under recorded when the members are on one of the higher floor levels. The principals' voices are under-recorded to a varying degree, again somewhat related to how high up they are on the stage constructions. It sounds like a recording without body mics, but you can see sometimes a wire on Kaufmann's neck or what could be 2 microphones under Opolais' wig, if they are not hair clips. Either way, the voices are recorded poorly relative to the orchestra.

At a setting of -9 db on my receiver, the orchestra will reach 90 db at peaks, applause will get there, too, when the principals take their bows. The voices, however, will barely reach 85 db and will be too soft when the orchestra is about right or the orchestra will be too loud when the voices are loud enough to be enjoyed. Radio microphone engineers Tracy Campbell and Christina de Lama and music mix engineer Jonathan Allen could probably tell us what went wrong.

Based on this imbalance between orchestra and voices, I can give it only 2 stars for the surround sound and suggest you wait for another recording of Manon Lescaut.",1455321600,3,2414,4.644028103044496

Had I, Iwould have thought twice about buying it.  Bringing the opera up to today could have worked somewhat, at least the first two acts suck.  Both leads seem to be somewhere else in the first act, totally disinterested.  The first act is so busy  and they are separated so much, it is hard to see them falling in love.  The second act is just gross.  In act three, Kaufman finally comes into his own.  The captain of the ship is absurd in a white dinner jacket, and who would belive that today the French would deport prostitutes.  The setting for the last act by Puccini has always been kind of bumb so it is hard to blame any production for looking silly..The good thing was that our soprano gave all she has, quite admirably, actually grandly.  I hope the new Met production does better by this wonderful opera.  I gave this a three rating only because of the last two acsts.

7204824,2,B00Y07Q882,"Jonathan Kent is an experienced director of non-musical theater, and in the last 15 years he has created operatic productions for Santa Fe, Glyndebourne, and the Mariinsky. He previously gave the Royal Opera House its current TOSCA production. I have not seen that one (available on DVD), but I know it won over a lot of people who had not wanted to part with the ROH's 42-year-old Franco Zeffirelli TOSCA, and a search of reviews from 2006 to 2015 turns up such descriptors as ""lavishly naturalistic,"" ""powerful,"" ""completely straight,"" and ""glorious."" So, the man was qualified; it's not as though the ROH's management gave the new MANON LESCAUT to the winner of a contest. It only seems that way.

Actually, the winner of a contest probably wouldn't make as many clumsy decisions as Kent makes. Des Grieux's great entrance is spoiled, as Kent has Kaufmann sitting on some outdoor steps at a low-end motel from the moment the curtain comes up. The production is updated to the present day. Manon arrives in the first scene in a minivan (on-stage automobiles almost always are a sign of desperation, in my experience). The crowd sings about how beautiful and elegant she is while she's still in the passenger seat of the minivan, dimly lit, and they can't even have a good view of her. Why not time it so they sing that when she gets out? The crowd obligingly leaves and returns for no reason at all, other than to give the leads some stage time alone. The first big loverly exchange is staged with Manon and Des Grieux at different levels of a narrow spiral staircase, so he's pledging his devotion to her knees.

By Act Two, Manon has fallen into the clutches of the pornographer Geronte. The Madrigal Singer is another adult-entertainment performer, and we get some kittenish girl-on-girl action between her and Manon while Geronte watches. It wouldn't even get a ""PG-13"" rating. It's the kind of provocation that an essentially conservative director does, lamely, when he's trying to keep up with the Regietheater crowd but his heart isn't really in it. A row of old bald-headed men files in to watch the filming of Manon's new skin flick, which doesn't have much skin, nor a sexual partner of either gender. She's just arching and posing. All of the old bald-headed men file out. Except one. But he's no old bald-headed man! He rips off his rubbery mask and he's...Des Grieux! This is the one moment in the show that could have been camp fun, but like everything else, it just fizzles. Kent just has Kaufmann take the mask off with no fanfare, while still seated, with his back to us, rather than milking Manon's confusion and the ultimate revelation by having him face Opolais and mime disapproval before ripping it off on the chord. It's that sort of show. Even if you've never directed a third-grade pageant, you get ideas for making it better even on its own wrongheaded terms.

Act Three, the deportation of the strumpets, is re-framed as the world's most boring-looking reality show. The ship's captain becomes an emcee in a white tuxedo. Subtitles are adjusted to remove the part about Des Grieux becoming a cabin boy. The first part of this act is staged in such a way that I can't tell what's preventing Manon and Des Grieux from just walking off. She's not restrained or confined in any way, and no one is watching them.

Act Four takes place high atop what looks like a partially demolished overpass in some desert locale, somewhere. In the house, the singers were invisible to half the audience. At least the cameras allow us to see them.

The scenery for every act is the sort one applauds...when the curtain is coming down on it, and one won't have to look at it anymore.

How's the musical performance? The orchestra (recorded forward; I kept turning it up for the voices and down when the orchestra dominated) plays very well for music director Antonio Pappano, as it usually does. He's very good in this repertoire. He's framing a strong, crisp, pungent MANON LESCAUT; it's a shame about what's in the frame.

Des Grieux is a good role for Jonas Kaufmann, but he's just executing his standard moves as both actor and singer. He's a surprisingly passive Des Grieux on this occasion, and his vocalism is the work of a discerning technician, not a singer fired with inspiration. Kristine Opolais's voice lacks the lushness and bloom one expects to hear in a Puccini heroine. She proves many times over that she can act, with all sorts of convincing cinematic reactions, but it isn't the kind of acting that illuminates this character, and I think it's because she's terribly directed. She and Kent give us such a shrewd, pensive Manon Lescaut in the first two acts that the inevitability goes out of the plot. It's difficult to believe this girl would make the decisions and mistakes that lead to her downfall. There's no avarice in her, no fantasy, and she's less convincing at playing youth than Renata Scotto is on the 1980 Met DVD, when Scotto actually was some years older. Opolais in the first act just seems to be a wary 35-year-old woman in a denim jacket and a floral dress. The mirror taunt of Geronte in Act Two comes out of nowhere. That isn't quite fair. It comes out of a libretto that this staging doesn't dramatize well. Opolais's dramatic performance of the Act Four aria is really harrowing, but that comes very late.

Maurizio Muraro gives the best performance as the nasty old bear Geronte. One misses him when he disappears halfway through; he seems to be having fun with the part. Christopher Maltman is in solid shape as Brother Lescaut. He models clothes and jewelry that are shorthand for ""pimp,"" and does so with an admirable lack of vanity.

There is a four-minute featurette called ""Who Is Manon Lescaut?"" to which everyone involved in the production contributes, but no one says anything of interest. We don't even get Pappano playing themes from the opera on the piano and talking about how great it is.

It's the sort of opera production that makes you think to yourself, ""After this scene, there's that, and there's that, and then I'll be done."" I have not seen the Munich pairing of these same singers in MANON LESCAUT (directed by Hans Neuenfels), and the Met has a new production (Richard Eyre) coming soon at the time of this writing. At least one of those just has to be an improvement on this.

The Royal Opera House had not presented this opera since 1983, a production by Gtz Friedrich (now dead), conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli (also now dead), starring Kiri Te Kanawa (now retired) and Plcido Domingo (now singing baritone roles at an advanced age). Before that, it hadn't been back since the 1960s, with...Marie Collier. For whatever reason, Puccini's first big success has never been embraced in that house as it has been at the Met, where it returns fairly often. So, I hope the London public got something out of seeing this live. My fear is that a production that exacerbates every problem someone could have with MANON LESCAUT, and adds several new ones, would make that audience not want to see it for another 30 years. I could only recommend this to someone who wants a visual souvenir of Kaufmann and Opolais in these roles and does not want to bank on one of the other productions with them being released on DVD/Blu-ray.",1452902400,30,7293,4.721131186174391

7204827,5,B00Y07Q882,"Opera videos nowadays are so common that it's hard to sort what's truly worth buying from the dreck. But this video of Manon Lescaut is a definite must-have for opera lovers. Kristine Opolais and Jonas Kaufmann absolutely sizzle in this production from the Royal Opera House. Director Jonathan Kent set this production in the modern day sex worker industry. The opera starts in a seedy red light hotel. Manon gets a quick initiation into the business before becoming a porn star (Geronte is a porn film maker) and then a character in a degrading reality tv show. She expires on an abandoned highway. The main storyline however is not really changed -- still about prostitution and love, just a different era. I know this production was not popular when it premiered but on video it plays well.

Opolais doesn't have a very conventionally beautiful voice -- it doesn't have the plush or bloom of, say, Anna Netrebko (another contemporary exponent of the role). Occasionally her voice turns hard and metallic. However she's a committed actress who throws herself into the production fearlessly. Not many sopranos are willing to simulate a porn filming onstage. What sets her performance apart is her amazing chemistry with Kaufmann. The two of them interact in a way that makes you almost wonder if there's real-life chemistry there. Of course it is acting but that's how convincing they are.  Kaufmann is a more reserved singer, but vocally this is a great fit for him. His tenor can sound alternately ardent, lyrical, and stentorian enough to ride over the climaxes of Puccini's orchestration. This is maybe one of the best tenor vehicles around -- gorgeous music for the tenor from beginning to end.

Christopher Maltman (Lescaut) and Maurizio Muraro (Geronte) bring an extra sleaze factor to their roles. Pappano is excellent in the pit -- he really revels in the lush orchestration and almost Wagnerian intensity of Puccini's music. Video quality is excellent. Highly recommended.",1452384000,4,1983,5.039634146341464
