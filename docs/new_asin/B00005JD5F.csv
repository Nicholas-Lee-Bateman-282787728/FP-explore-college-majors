1430093,4,B00005JD5F,"This is one of the cheap mini collections of episodes aimed at parents who just buy their kids Scooby-Doo videos w/o paying attention. But this collection is not bad.

So there is only 1 episode here that isn't already on DVD, but it is a good episode and nearly worth the cheap price of the DVD. Yes it would be better if Warner Bros gave us a bunch more season sets of the unreleased, but Vampires, Bats and Scaredy Cats is worth not waiting for.

The DVD also has trailers fro Cyber Chase, Alien Invaders, Witch's Ghost and Zombie Island, but there is also a cool sneak peek trailer for Samurai Jack before the series started airing on Cartoon Network. Jack facing off with giant bugs that shows the style and flavor of that show.

There is a special feature called ""The Gang"" that gives 4 bits of trivia about each member of Mystery Inc. Nothing mind blowing here.

There is a 5 question trivia game called ""Who's Who With Scooby-Doo"" And according to this trivia someone else's dad bought the Mystery Machine for the gang, even though it seems to belong to Fred in nearly every movie and series released in the last decade or two.",1420243200,,2281,6.199367088607595
1430094,5,B00005JD5F,"This is the perfect one--there apparently are other versions of this, which have only about half the episodes (even though they're called the same title, and have the same exact picture on the front), but this is the original, which is what we were hoping.  We had an older copy that was wearing out, and the boys decided they wanted another VHS copy to replace it.  We were really lucky to find this, and everyone is wildly excited to be able to watch it again to their heart's content without any tracking issues.  (Needless to say, our boys are Scooby Doo fans, and we have nearly the entire collection.)",1418428800,,607,4.5504587155963305

1430105,4,B00005JD5F,"If you're one of the more casual Scooby fans (that doesn't care about price), don't bother with these weak compilation sets. Get something like ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! The Complete First and Second Seasons"". DVDs like that will have all you want and more; If you're one of the more hardcore fans (like me), you should be getting this for one specific reason: ""Vampires, Bats, and Scaredy Cats"". It's the only episode of the second season of 'The Scooby-Doo Show' (the 1977 episodes) available on home video. I am kind of ticked off that that season (one of my favorites) isn't on DVD, but what are you gonna do? I take what I can get.",1316304000,,638,4.556521739130435

1430111,5,B00005JD5F,"There are many Scooby-Doo dvds you can buy but overall this one had the best mix of episodes if you were not going to buy the more expensive seasons that are out now. These is a great dvd for Halloween as it has some of the ""spookiest tales"" done for Scooby-Doo. ""Vampires,Bats, And Scaredy Cats"" is really good and features great Shaggy One Liners like when he see's the vampire and says ""Look, it's gramps the vamp"" and ""I already gave at the bloodbank."" You also have ""Witch Witch Is Which"" with it's Zombie and Witch characters with an old boat and swamp for a more scary effect.

""A Gaggle Of Galloping Ghosts"" is on here as well as ""That's Snow Ghost."" These are good but I would probably have put another on here besides ""That's Snow Ghost"" as it fit's better on the dvd ""Winter Wonderdog."" But the main reason to get this dvd is for the episode ""Headless Horseman Of Halloween."" This has everything from a costume Hallowen party,Graveyard,a butler and of course, many one-liners from Shaggy.

Overall this is the best value for a great mix of episodes. The ""Headless Horseman Of Halloween"" is only on the dvd and not the VHS version be sure to get the dvd for this bonus.",1177718400,,1179,4.47906976744186
1430122,5,B00005JD5F,"Zoinks!
This Dvd features 4 classic Scooby Doo Where Are You episodes + 1 bonus halloween day classic episode.
3 of the episodes are the 1969 season for me the best and the two other are from 1976 season where the show is called the Scooby Doo Show and features a new character Scooby Dum brother of Scooby Doo.
It contains the mexican spanish dubbing as they broadcast in Spain.
A classic for any Scub fan.
Scooby Doooooo!!!!",1023494400,,426,4.4743589743589745
1430123,4,B00005JD5F,"I will probably always see ""Scooby Doo On Zombie Island"" as the ultimate Scooby flick. But this video tape is absolutely essential for anyone who is a fan of Scooby Doo. (FIRST EPISODE)  This witch and zombie tale nails down the formula for most of Scooby's episodes. There is a normal start, but yet a creepy setting as well. We meet one of the 'supernatural characters.' Then we are exposed to the possible (or to be more accurate) the official story that supposedly explains the presence of the supernatural. (Granted, we know it probably isn't.) But there are some scenes that allow us for at least a moment or two to accept the possibility of the supernatural. (When the witch travels down the raft with the zombie, the witch's house, etc.) The disappearance of Daphne creates some suspense. Then some clues begin to appear that the supposed supernatural is really linked to some very human criminal activity.  (SECOND EPISODE) The scenery allows for a normal start, but still provides a creepy setting. The 1st sighting of the ghost is comical, and Velmah carries the whole gang. (Not unlike her moment in 'Hassle In the Castle.') Shaggy has a memorable one liner here and there: 'This ski trip has turned into a real scare trip.' Scooby's sudden separation from Shaggy and Velmah creates some suspense. Scooby has a very heroic moment. The recluse is an interesting guest star, and the flashback is well done. (THIRD EPISODE) The story starts normal enough with an adventure trip. Daphne's disappearance creates some suspense. We also have the luxury of being haunted by several monsters in this episode. Scooby and Shaggy come off a little braver than usual, and we get to see their reaction to a bad menu. Scooby and Shaggy also get lost, and we get to see them pass the time. There is even some irony when Scooby and Shaggy unknowingly give the bad guy what he is looking for. Alright. The bad guy's slip seems a little fake, but that's alright seeing what a great episode this is. (FINAL EPISODE) We have the guest star of Scooby Dum which adds some charm. We are given time to wonder what the bad guy's motives are. As in good horror, we are made nervous around characters who aren't really a threat and relaxed around those who we probably should worry about. Without giving away the ending, they nail down a true aspect of horror. (Horror comes not from a bad guy being unmasked, but from realizing that we were betrayed by someone we really thought we could trust.) These 4 episodes show some of Scooby's strongest moments. DO NOT let this video tape get away!",1010448000,,2575,4.6946902654867255
1430124,5,B00005JD5F,"I've seen the other reviews.  I did not purchase this video for me, I purchased it for my 3 year old little boy!  And Scooby-Dum or not, he loves it!  Episode after Episode - any video that has 3 or 4 movie flicks is GREAT for me AND my little guy! These movies are part of the original Scooby-Doo's - not too scary and not too mature for little ones. I've seen the new Scooby-Doo movies and they're NOT Appropriate for children under 5! If you've got a little one- this video is GREAT!",1005091200,,486,4.148936170212766
1430125,3,B00005JD5F,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Scooby-Doo! However, in my humble opinion, the original ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You?"" series is, far and away, the best that Scooby has to offer. So, why on earth did Cartoon Network/Warner Bros. choose to include 2 later episodes featuring Scooby-Dumb? (well, at least it's not Scrappy...) I had high hopes for Scooby on dvd with the appearance of ""Greatest Mysteries"". Now I'm not sure that I trust Warner Bros. to do Scooby justice in his dvd releases... This dvd is not bad, but a true fan of Scooby-Doo will most likely find themselves skipping over the later episodes, and wishing they had gotten their money's worth.",1003881600,,648,4.794642857142857
1430126,3,B00005JD5F,"I'm a Big fan of Scooby Doo. But I wouldn't I repeat wouldn't buy the DVD.
Do not buy the DVD. Order Cartoon Network if you don't already have it. Cartoon Network played Scooby more times than one could keep track of.  IF you pay close attention you'll notice that the same episode is played twice in one day or maybe three of four times. I suggest you record the 13 ghosts of scooby doo instead. The monsters are real at least. Tape Ghoul School, Scooby and Relunctant Werewolf and Boo Brothers. Cartoon network will give more than enough hours of scooby till you're either bored or till you're ready to tape it again.",1002672000,,619,4.4298245614035086
