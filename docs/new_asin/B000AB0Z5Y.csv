8159674,5,B000AB0Z5Y,The guy who made this movie also made little rasclals episodes and several Laurel and Hardy movies and it shows. This is an  hour of old slapstic humor. Either you get it or you don't. I like this type of thing so I was laughing all night while watching two country idiots trying to make sense of the big city. A barell of laughs.,1154044800,,330,4.15625
8159675,5,B000AB0Z5Y,"This is a classic story of country bumpkins who have a good idea but need to go the ""Big City"" in order to get it inot the hands of the right people. Of course, because they don't understand that city at all they make a lot of obvious mistakes that serve as comic fodder and to move the plot along. Like all Hollywood movies of this time there is a happy ending and they are able to get rich while also helping the war effort. There is a lot of silliness, but who needs a serious film all the time?",1148342400,,498,3.99
