8279246,4,B001ARYYMC,Interesting journey as only Francesco could tell.,1461801600,,49,6.142857142857143
8279247,5,B001ARYYMC,"Beautiful, absolutely beautiful. This is a great production, excellent photography. You really feel as though you are being taken on a journey with a knowledgeable native guide, da Mosto! I have been to many of these places, and it is great to see them again with such clarity and yet, through the eyes of this romantic guide. Definitely the Italy I remember. Why in the world has this DVD set not been released for U.S. DVD players? I bought from Amazon a Panasonic multi region DVD player that plays all of my foreign region DVDs perfectly. Just pop them in! Worth every penny. As is this set, Francesco's Italy Top to Toe. Excellent!!!",1460419200,,638,4.654867256637168
8279248,5,B001ARYYMC,"Buon viaggio!  Totally enjoyed this DVD set.  It zooms from one attraction to another, not going into an abundance of detail, but the scenery is breathtaking and helping me to decide where in Italy to go on my next vacation........  Francesco has an engaging personality and keeps it moving in a fun and casual way.  Bellissimo!",1460160000,,328,4.803571428571429
8279249,3,B001ARYYMC,"Da Mosto begins with an interesting premise: following in the wake of an ancestor from the period when Venice was the dominant power in the Adriatic and eastern Mediterranean. Unfortunately, the follow-through on that premise is only sporadic, and all too often Da Mosto descends into pretty run-of-the-mill travelogue. If a travelogue of the region with at least some historical flavor is what you're looking for, you'll probably be happy enough with these discs. If, on the other hand, you already have some knowledge of the historical background and would like to flesh it out with contemporary footage of the sites, you'll likely be disappointed.",1434931200,,650,5.2
8279250,5,B001ARYYMC,Yes it won't play in a USA or Canadian player as it clearly states. I have a region free player and wanted this DVD for a long time after seeing Francesco's Itlay and Venice shows on PBS. I purchased both the Italy and Venice DVD's and sorry to say it's not available for USA players. So I purchased a region free player just so I could enjoy these DVD's...  for a long time.. For me it was well worth the money..Francesco serves up Italy from a insiders point and can't be matched by anyother travel guides Video.. It's a must see.,1382054400,,532,4.267326732673268
8279251,5,B001ARYYMC,"The next best thing to visiting Italy.  A real teaser.  If you love Italy, you'll love this video.  Unfortunately it's formatted in British International code, but I was able to convert it to US format using a free online video conversion AP...",1381622400,3,244,4.761904761904762
8279252,5,B001ARYYMC,"My husband and I loved watching this series on PBS and have wanted to purchase the DVD ever since.  We're hoping that this European version will play on the XBox.  UPDATE:  The DVD will not play on the Xbox BUT it will play on a laptop or desktop computer by changing the region settings.  We put the disc in the laptop, attached it to the TV with a cable and voila!",1372291200,2,366,4.112676056338028
8279253,1,B001ARYYMC,"Ordered it from Amazon, it will NOT work on US players, because it was produced in England.  Amazon/Supplier will not pay postage for return, even thought I already paid postage to receive. So stuck with DVD that will not work!
I loved this program on the Travel Channel.",1362873600,,271,4.645833333333333
8279254,5,B001ARYYMC,"This is an amazing series. Unfortunately, this listing is only for region 2. That means, if you live in the USA, you probably will not be able to play it on your laptop or DVD player. If you are able to play region 2, however, grab it!!! You won't regret the purchase, if your electronics comply, with the DVD settings.",1348185600,,319,4.333333333333333
