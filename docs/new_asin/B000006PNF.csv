7904599,4,B000006PNF,"When I decided to get serious about learning how to play tennis, I found this video and it propelled me from the ranks of people who own a racquet but never took any instruction to someone who could hang with 3.0 to 4.0 players almost overnight. Since then I have taken many group and private lessons that were not nearly as valuable as this video in terms of good solid fundamental stroke production. Look at this video and you will immediately see how different your groundstrokes and volleys are from the solid basics taught in this video.  Its a little old school in appearance, but timeless in its value as a learning tool.",1215475200,,628,4.557522123893805
7904600,4,B000006PNF,"I am a 4.0 tennis player, but ski most weekends in the winter and find that my strokes are inconsistent when I start playing  again regularly in the spring. By reviewing this tape and going back to basics I find that I am easily able to correct my mistakes and find my form again. The format is concise and methodical and most importantly easily translates (visually) into improved stroke production ( or correction as in my case). MY only grievance is that there is no segment on the overhead..or at least a follow up video covering the overhead, lob, return of serve and serve variations.",987379200,4,590,4.619047619047619
7904601,4,B000006PNF,"Could have covered the overhead, lob and return of serve, but does a real good job on the basic stokes. Emphasis is on a good simple, connected, repeatable  stroke.",983491200,,164,4.655172413793103
