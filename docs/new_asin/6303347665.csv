SO many issues brought to the viewer in a smart, funny, thought-provoking package that pulls at your  heart strings again and again.  Just another chance to see Percy and  ""Lois"" may make me view it a 5th time!  The cast and director  have produced a classic.",941587200,3,376,4.3768115942028984

639799,3,6303347665,"A seven year old loses her mother.  The father needs to go to work, so he has to hire someone to be home with the child.

This movie was sweet without being too much.  It was sad, but light.  There was one scene that really touched me, where the little girl asks her nanny when her mother is coming home already, and the nanny has to explain that being dead means that you cannot come home.

This movie takes place in the 1950s, during Segregation.  The movie starts off completely ignoring that, but toward the end, it is more obvious, to the point of too much.

After some sudden strong scenes, there is an abrupt happy ending.",1488326400,,629,4.3247863247863245

I think it's important to note that although Corrina is in the title twice there's only one Whoopie Goldberg in the movie, unlike multiplicity, which had many Whoopies.",1466985600,,302,4.69811320754717

639946,5,6303347665,"I wasn't sure I would like this movie, but it turned out to be tender (BOTH characters were respectful of what the other had gone through) without being sappy, a bit slow-moving so you felt better about the guy falling in love again after losing his wife, and handled the racial tensions quite well, I thought--but I'd be interested to know how a person of color would like this movie.  Whoopi was amazing (and a slightly different character than what I've seen her in other movies--a nice change for me!), and Liotta's interaction with Whoopi was satisfying.  I would have liked to see a little more ""daddy"" behavior--show some real emotion and tenderness with your little girl who is hurting so badly after losing her mom, but the behavior is not totally unbelievable; many men have difficulty dealing with deep emotions outwardly.  I suppose this is somewhat idealistic; it sort of gives the idea that love conquers all, when in real life things don't always work out as well.  (A couple having to deal with the deep-seated prejudices of family and friends can't always make it work--it's not a walk in the park!)  But, I WILL watch this movie again.  Ignore the be-raters and try it, if you enjoy a good romance with some depth to it.  It is definitely a feel-good watch.",1465430400,7,1275,4.690582959641255

640018,5,6303347665,"I love, love, love this movie, have seen it a few times, and ordered it so I could watch it again with a friend who didn't know it.  Whoopi as Corrina is so nuanced in this role as a woman of color in the 60s who refuses to conform or confine herself to the prescribed norms of the times.  The script treats race as incidental, which it never is, and simply tells the story of a widower who is heartbroken by the loss of this wife but also clueless as to how to care for or help his traumatized young daughter.  The direction is bright and full of West Coast technicolor, mid-century whimsy, and the jazzy bluesy soundtrack is the perfect score for Corrina 's hip, smart, approach towards caring for this family. The ending might be predictable, but its the only one that makes sense given how the characters are written.  You'll be smiling from beginning to end with this one, and even find yourself wishing there had been a sequel.  How often can you say that about a movie?",1457913600,,976,4.370165745856354

640093,5,6303347665,"One of my most favorite films. It keeps you interested from beginning to end and tears at your heart in between. After this movie came out, I had a hard time watching Ray Liotta cast as a bad guy in the many other movies he's been in because his character in this movie is so human and charming. Whoopi Goldberg is great as is the supporting cast. When the movie is over, you feel happy that you took the time to watch it. I can't believe it's been over 20 years since it came out. Doesn't matter though as it's timeless. It's 115 minutes but has a nice pace to it. Don't think of it as a ""chick flick"" either because my husband and 17 year old son really enjoy watching it too now that we have it on DVD. I find myself humming ""this little light of mine"" from time to time...",1452038400,,776,4.078431372549019

640100,5,6303347665,"Great movie! I didn't realize just such a short time ago interracial marriage was such a big deal. Sucks that society is the way it is. Come on people haven't you read/heard from the Bible that God made human kind in His image. Different races are still human! We are ALL made in God's image! Besides haven't you also heard that scientifically everyones DNA originates them back to Africa. Darker skin color = more melanin = more protection from the sun and skin cancer, darker eyes = less occurrence of cataracts. So probably light skin and light eye color is a mutation/micro evolution. Just saying'! God bless and embrace every person as God's living child! We are all one body of Christ! I look forward to the day that Jesus restores us all and justice will be had and the least of these will be first! Praise Yeshua for his justice and perfection!",1445904000,,852,4.57516339869281

It is a good family-oriented movie. Whoopi Goldberg portrays a black woman limited by the color of her skin and her time, not by her intelligence, education or talents. She perseveres, she does not give up. She refuses to be defined by what other people think she should be. She meets Manny a Jewish widower who begins to accept her for who she is and the joy she brings to him and his young daughter. A good movie!",1419724800,3,575,4.284403669724771

Not only is Whoopi Goldberg great as the housekeeper who had to find employment far beneath her abilities and aspirations, but her character's genuine care for the father and daughter in light of the mother's recent passing is heart-warming. Many funny, cute moments in this movie, with impeccable acting by all.",1393977600,2,359,4.901639344262295

I love the little girl, the dad, and most of all Corrina. As a girl, of course, I related to the little girl and really liked that part of the story. I thought she was so pretty and sweet. It was easy to relate to her. I was always a shy child. As an adult, i relate more to the parents. I like how they fell in love and continued their relationship even though they were different races. I like how the dad softens to God by the end of the story and knows he really does need God in his life. It is such a sweet, feel good movie that I highly recommend for little girls and their moms to watch together and for older women as well.",1390867200,,754,3.9025974025974026

Several scenes are quite striking and memorable. Character walking into curtains blowing in the wind of an open window black and white projection of a home movie, little girl staring at sky while lying next to mother's dress (with her hand in the pocket of mother's dress) etc..

640805,5,6303347665,"I watched this movie with no expectations and was blown away by its powerful story, social commentary, and heartwarming tale of compassion.

A recently widowed marketing advertiser (Ray Liota) struggles with raising his young daughter until he hires Corrina (Whoopi Goldberg). What he doesn't expect is that Corrina not only helped pull his daughter from the abyss, she saves him too. And they find themselves falling in love, during a time in history where interracial relationships wee taboo.

The social commentary along with the heartwarming love story and Goldberg's stellar performance make Corrina Corrina a must have for any classic movie collector!",1385424000,2,657,5.431372549019608

The author has the sensitivity it takes to get in and heal what our minds can't.  Whoopi seems to bring the best out of her character and those around her in the love story.,1377993600,,318,4.19672131147541

The little girl was adorable and played her part to perfection, as did Whoopi Goldberg and Ray Liotta.  The movie was done with such taste.  As a widow myself, I cried with the loss of a Wife and Mother.  I could relate with all of the emotions.  Whoopi played her part beautifully.  I loved the humor in it.

641012,3,6303347665,"I really, really love this movie...in the beginning. It touched on several unusual topics simultaneously--parent death and subsequent mourning by their child and spouse, atheism, and race relations in 1960s suburbs. But it's almost as though the first half was so good that it could only go downhill from there.

LOVED:
--Depiction of childhood grief
--Strain in parent-child relationship after death of spouse
--Corrina and Molly (every scene)
--Spousal grief and dating pressure
--Race relations between Molly and Corrina's nephew/nieces

HATED:
--Obligatory love connection between Corrina and Manny
--Romantic relationship between Corrina and Manny very unconvincing--like a bowl of warm oatmeal
--Corrina's insistence on pushing her own spiritual views on Molly; Manny's failure to address
--Manny apologizes for (justified) anger over Molly's truancy
--Manny's inexplicable decision to change his fundamental worldview",1368662400,,924,6.0458015267175576

I thought they had chemistry, and i especially loved it when he was sucking and kissing on her neck outside of her sister's house.

I know a lot of people were complaining about Whoopi's casting in this movie because they felt that a perfect specimen like Ray liotta should have been paired up with a prettier actress. They made too much of a big deal about them kissing, but what they seem to forget is that back in slavery times, the Ray Liottas was RAPING the Whoopi Goldbergs! The Ray Liottas was doing all kinds of sexual things to the Whoopi Goldbergs so them going crazy over them kissing in this movie is absurd! Learn your history.",1343520000,,917,4.458333333333333

After interviewing a whole lot of ridiculously wrong candidates for the position, Manny hires Corrina Washington (Whoopi Goldberg) to be his housekeeper and look after Molly.

A rather predictable effect is that Molly promotes a romance between Corrina and her dad. Of course, the neighbors are shocked -- both Corrina's and Manny's.

641380,4,6303347665,"Last night's bargain rack movie was ""Corrina, Corrina"" starring Whoopi Goldberg and Ray Liotta. The story involved a time warp back to the late 50s. Everybody smoked under any and all circumstances. The streets were crowded with late 50s and earlier cars. (Where does Hollywood get them all?) The prevailing racial attitudes of the 50s prevailed. Little bits of 50s and earlier music filled the airwaves and, yes, ""Corrina, Corrina"" was one of the songs.

The story involved a family (Mother, Father, young girl). The mother died leaving the father (Ray Liotta) in need of a house keeper and caretaker of the little girl. In stepped Whoopi (Corrina)i. The story involved the gradual adjustment of this little group into a functioning household. It was funny in places. It was touching in places. It was a feel-good movie that came to a happy ending. No big deal. Just an enjoyable  and well done story. I left it feeling relieved that the 50s were over.

Whoopi Goldberg is so gifted - you can really see her beauty and heart in this. It would feel nice trying on her deep voice and cool, calm manner.

641479,5,6303347665,"""Corrina, Corrina"" is a really wonderful, sweet, from the heart movie that tackles the issue of love between two people from a different angle. It takes place in 1959 America, and thus during segregation and before the Civil Rights Acts. It is about a young white man, Manny Singer (Ray Liotta) who loses his wife and has a 7 year old daughter Molly to take care of. He needs a nanny and so after several interviews with very inappropriate white candidates, he choses Corrina Washginton (Whoopie Goldberg). Corrina is a college graduate and completely overqualified for the job, but because she is black, she has to settle for what she can get. She is repeatedly rejected for jobs and colums she wants to write because of her race and her sister tells her to stop trying. Manny is closed-off and just like anyone who loses a loved-one, he is mostly on auto-pilot: doing what he needs to do every day but finding no joy in it. Molly has stopped speaking ever since her mother passed away and is also closing in on herself. Manny is desperate and sad about his daughter's situation but does not know how to get to her.

All this changes, at least for Molly, when Corrina comes into their lives. Soon she is able to win Molly's trust, who starts speaking again, and she also surprises Manny as she is not only warm, witty, and sensitive but also educated, cultured and well-rounded, able to have the kind of conversation most white folks probably didn't think a black woman could have with her corporate-world boss. A sort of family-dynamic between the three develops, and Corrina even takes Molly to her sister's place and has her play with her nieces and nephews. Over time, Corrina and Manny grow closer but because this is 1950s America and racism pretty much institutionalized, a romantic relationship seems out of the question. This movie explorers these themes of racism, love and romance as well as loss in a very delicate way.

I must say the best part of the movie is toward the end, when Manny just doesnt care anymore about what other people think and hugs Corrina right in front of the house, in public. It is a warm, tight, meaningful hug in which he holds on to her. Their love for one another, or Manny's love for Corrina, is sincere and the fact that she is played by Whoopie Goldberg, as opposed to let's say Halle Berry or Vanessa Williams or Jada Pinkett-Smith, really is what makes Manny's love for Corrina believable. If Manny had fallen in love with some gorgeous ex supermodel turned actress type, no one would be surprised. I mean segregation or not, who WOULDNT fall for Halle Berry, right? But the fact that he falls in love with someone like Whoopie Goldberg, who is not a beauty icon, really is evidence to the fact that he falls in love with her soul as opposed to her looks primarily. And THAT is where the strength of this movie lies. I think the producers and writers did a great job casting Goldberg for this role. Had they casted any other black actress for the role, like those gorgeous types, the story and feel of the movie would just have come out very differently.

Unfortunately they don't make movies with such substance anymore. Most actors casted today, even in genre and time-specific pieces, just are not real anymore. That is why this movie is so special: it draws on and projects real feelings people can identify with as opposed to just coming across as another far-fetched, glamorous and mostly unrealistic Hollywood romance between two pretty, fit, happy people who....surprise, surprise...find each other.",1287705600,5,3554,4.701444622792938
641480,5,6303347665,doesn't matter what your background is. Corrina comes and help Manny who is an athesit raising his daughter. And she shows them how to cope with the death of their love one. Her and Manny fall in love as well. Pure movie magic.,1287705600,,227,4.3023255813953485

He must be a very good actor, because he was totally convincing as a nice quiet widower and father.  Usually he plays a tough guy or some kind of psycho. Whoopi is her usual fabulous self.

641561,5,6303347665,"This  movie  is somethingesle let me tell you. It has a good  combination of  all the things that make life  interesting. I loved all the characters in the movie. You can tell everyone wanted to make this  movie  as real and  enjoyable as possible. There are so many  scenes that  make this movie  a real treasure.

Originally, my mom had rented it on VHS one day and we sat and watched it. We had to stop halfway through  becasue she had to  go to work but when she returned we finished it and  loved it!!!! Later on we got it again on DVD. I was  so overjoyed. Then she let someone  borow it and  we  never  saw it again.

I was so upset. Fast forward a  couple  years later and find it on Amazon and buy a copy for her and myself. The acting is good and  there is a lot of fun to be had. One of my favorite scenes  is when  Molly has to spell out vaccum to her  dad after telling him that  she won the spelling bee. (This was hilarious and  Corrina's reaction is  really funny.)

There is  also another  scene where  they are sitting down to dinner and Molly haphazardly  let's slip some  personal information about  Ms. Washington. Just to see Whoopi's eyes  during this  segment  is hilarious and so  realistic. I have gotten that look from my  mom  a great many times.

It's  scenes like these that make this  movie likable and fun.

Now there are scenes where you may feel sad  for whatever reason. It's just a good mixture. I feel the director  caught the realistic feel of  people living in a time like that. Liotta and  Goldberg  make a  great couple in this  movie and that's kind of surprising.

641566,5,6303347665,"This is a interracial movie that is not heavy handed. Corrina (Whoopi Goldberg) needs a job.  She has a college education, but can't find anything other than domestic work.  Hey, it's the fifties.  Manny (Ray Liotta) has lost his wife and is grieving.  He needs a housekeeper.  In comes Corrina.  There are scenes in this movie that really did it for me.  First Molly the daughter does not talk, unable to understand why her mommy is gone.  She continually plays a portion of a song her mother started teaching her and stares at her mother's picture.  Corrina waits until Manny leaves and sits down and plays the song with Molly.  This is the act that helps Molly to open up.  Manny starts falling for Corrina and isn't even aware of it.  His parents can see it coming and so can her sister.  His mom watches at Molly's party (Jenny not invited) as he takes a cigarette she's smoking and puts it in his mouth. Corrina stays at the Singer household way past what is considered normal and does not even request overtime.  When Corrina becomes jealous when Manny's friend Jenny shows up uninvited, she threatens to quit.
The smirk on Manny's face when she gives her 'time and a half for overtime' speech lets the audience know that there's more feelings between them than just a working relationship.  The kiss under the moonlight as they dance was one of the most romantic I have seen in movies in a long time. It is his father's death that makes him realize how much he misses Corrina and wants her in his life.  When Jenny takes the vase that Corrina had broken and glued back together, Manny protests saying that he likes the cracks.  Unable to convince Jenny and not willing to tell her why he really wants the vase to remain as is (because it reminds him of Corrina) he takes it from her and smashes it.  Manny coming to get Corrina in the end and her letting him know that she would not return as his employee opened the door to the beginning of them publicly acknowledging their relationship first to her family and then to his.  The only downside was the ending.  I wish they had showed the conversation between Corrina, Manny and his mother that was at the end of the credits.",1255910400,4,2183,4.49238578680203

For example, I used to think that Whoopi was a bit of a so-and-so which was confirmed to me when I was at an ALS benefit and met Ted Danson's dry cleaner. He told me that Danson was never really involved with Whoopi because that would violate his religion, but he just used it to promote his screwball comedy ""A Fine Mess.""

641709,5,6303347665,"I had no idea of the storyline, one of my sisters has been raving over this movie for a long time and I thought yea right...

Well....from the 1st scene to the last this movie had me involved, using every emotion. but it was NOT a manipulative phony movie. Far from it. The little girl who played Molly- she was exceptional. She conveyed a child's grief and a child's joy with out being phony. All the kids in the movie were wonderful. Whoopi was amazing and she absolutely shone like a star. Ray Liotta played the father but as a real human who makes mistakes along the way but tries his best. The relationship between he and Corrina ( Whoopi) was real and believable and sincere. The relationship between Corrina and Molly was so heartfelt and touching, I could cry just thinking about it. We were all children once. We all have or had mothers. And we can all feel the emotion of this little child who lost her mother and wants that love in her life again.

Oh and the music! The music was incredibly important to the flow of the story, from the classic jazz to the commercial jingles to the gorgeous gospel.

The underlying heartbreak of racism, bad then in the 50's, still bad now but not quite. Interraccial couples are more and more  ( thankfully) accepted, but how horrible things were then. But the innocence of children... they do not know color, they are taught that. And the movie beautifully expressed that with out being preachy  or heavy handed. We got it. The one scene with Molly and Corrina's niece, when they were sitting outside and Molly asked her if she tasted like chocolate and then the niece asked Molly if she tasted like vanilla, and they licked each other... oh that scene will be with me forever, it was beautiful.

There were other scenes all throughout, on so many levels this was a really perfect movie, with so many issues and lessons and was a  movie that treated its audience as smart and able to read between the lines.

I recommend this movie so much! stand on your chair and cheer...NO I mean,  stand on your chair and sing!!!!

Manny hires Corrina (Goldberg) to take care of Molly while he's away at work.  What he never expected was to fall in love with her in the process.  The fact that Corrina is African American never even feels like a problem or concern to either Corrina or Manny, and especially not to Molly who has become smitten with Corrina and is pushing their relationship, but their family has many concerns.  Corrina's own sister and Manny's parents are both apposed but ultimately it's a decision that only Manny and Corrina can make.

641749,5,6303347665,"I have only seen about 4 or 5 feature movies starring Whoopi Goldberg and even less with Ray Liotta.  Of these few, Corrina, Corrina is my favorite.  Corrina, Corrina is a movie with so many heartwarming moments.  It is also in the rare category of movies made in the last 2 decades which actually teaches a number of lessons. The lessons in Corrina, Corrina deal with loss, love, giving, hope, faith, art, beauty, optimism, racism, and forgiveness.
After Manny Singer's wife's death, he and his young daughter Molly are left alone to cope with their loss.  After interviewing a number of unsuitable and eccentric applicant's as for the job of nanny, he chooses Corrina Washington.  Corrina is far too qualified for the job.  She is a college graduate with dreams of writing liner notes for jazz albums. But she is born too early, for she is an African-American woman, and it is 1950s America.
Being an optimist with a strong faith, Corrina becomes Molly's nanny.  In the process, she changes the lives of both Manny and Molly.  Love blooms effortlessly between the three.  Molly sees  Corrina as a new mother.  Corrina and Manny see beyond one ano-
ther's skin color.  They listen to one another.  Their tastes in music and their outlook are  similar.  They fall in love to Molly's glee.  But their families and 1950s America is not ready for their romance.
All of the actors in this movie were attractive.  Whoopi Goldberg never looked better. Ray Liotta's looks and whole demeanor took my breath away.  I think it was very courageous to cast Goldberg and Liotta together as love interests. Seeing them together in the film, made me wish that they were a couple in real life.  Tina Majorina was precious, and one of the best child actors I have ever seem.  I have been waiting to see her in more films ever since I first saw her in Corrina, Corrina.

Corrina, Corrina is a heartwarming film that's heartbreaking romantic, and all around a joy to watch. Whoopi Goldberg plays a nanny who is hired by an Athiest (Ray Liotta) to look after his 7 year old girl, Molly. It takes some time getting used to Corrina and her religous beliefs (because she'd tell Molly that her mother, who had recently passed away, was in Heaven and the father told Corrina not to be telling Molly such things because he and his deceased wife were Athiest), but in the end, the father comes to accept Corrina's intentions and find what's best for his daughter. There are some heartbreaking moments in the film that will have tears running down your cheeks, but there are also moments where you'll be laughing your sorrow away. This movie is pretty much perfect. When Molly's mother died, she became miserable and wouldn't talk to anyone. She wouldn't say one word.

About half way through the film I was thinking, wait a second, this is 1959 Los Angeles.  We're talking pre-civil rights movement.  Corrina was being treated as an equal and I felt like the past was being whitewashed like looking through rose colored glasses from current viewpoints.  Then all of a sudden they started playing the race card in the latter part of the film and it became evident once Ray Liotta's character became romantically interested in Corrina.  I can understand on a dramatic pacing reason why it works well that way, but from a realism point of view it seems like some foreshadowing might have been in order to remind us that it's not a modern tale.
The film pulls the heart strings in the right places and the initial focus on the mother who has passed is a real emotional hook.  Carrina opening Molly back up after her retreat from life shows the kind of person Carrina is and her zest for life helps bring Molly back out of her shell.",1063065600,5,1171,4.4186046511627906

When you see little Molly's simple adoration of Corrina - if adoration can be defined as simple -it gives me hope that maybe one day people will look past the color of one's skin before they make a judgement call.

641757,5,6303347665,"This movie is beautiful from start to finish.
Whoopi Goldberg is perfectly casted as Corrina, a black (well, duh) nanny who is employed by a white Jew (very well played by Ray Liotta), to take care of his daughter Molly (again excellently played by Tina Majorino).
The plot. Manny Singer's (Ray) wife has just died leaving him and his 7 year old daughter (Tina) behind. Molly is a little lost after this and she doesn't speak a word to her father or anyone else. After employing a plethora of disastrous nannys Manny finally comes to Corrina, who is perfect. One problem: She's black, he's white, and this is 1959 segregated America.
After a little while Molly begins to talk again and is generally uplifted by Corrina, who seems to have this miraculous way of bringing people back to their feet, including Manny. Corrina and Manny fall in love against all odds, and what you get is a beautiful interracial romance that at that time is classed as wrong, even abnormal. No one approves apart from Molly and her Grandfather (Don Ameche).
One down side to this film, and I will add that it is the only down side, is the ending - you don't really know what happens. If I hadn't done a little research then I wouldn't have known that director Jessie Nelson had based this film on her true life story. She's black and her now husband of 40 odd years was white. This story is her story. They got married and lived happily ever after - but we have to guess. So the ending could have used a little bit more work. But that's it!! The movie is just wonderful.

Ray Liotta is wonderful in his role as the jingle-writing dad and brings a depth and a realness to the role.  Tina Majorino, as his daughter, is able to handle the roller-coaster of emotions of a girl who is confused and depressed about the loss of her mother; and yet she retains a spunk and a liveliness that slowly appears thanks to Corrina's understanding and influence.

It endeared itself to me even more after I saw an interview with Jessie Nelson on TBS' Dinner and a Movie.  This story was based on Nelson's real experience in her early life.  The true story happens to be that Corrina was a senion citizen.  Jessie did try to fix her up with dad, but of course, it never succeeded.  And she wrote it just that way, as it happened.  After she was done, however, and was reviewing it, she knew that she had written a fine after-school special, not a full feature movie.  This is one time I'm glad they changed the real life situations!
This movie is seperated into two distinct halves; one where Molly doesn't talk, and the other half where she does.  The first half is very beautiful, artistic, and insightful; approaching masterpiece in my mind.  The second half is wonderful as well, but it just doesn't have the same magical, dreamy feel as the first.  The musical score fits the movie extraordinarily well.  Thomas Newman's hand in the composing is evident.  And the actors' characterizations are just as good as it gets.  Ray Liotta has always been one of my favorite current actors; it's a shame he's made some very bad career decisions.  I didn't know Whoopi Goldberg had it in her, but she's perfect in this movie.  The chemistry between Manny and Corrina is also an unexpected surprise.  Tina Majorino is wonderful as Molly in both halves (two rather different roles to play).  The supporting actors are at their best, not to mention Don Ameche, who has, I think, one word in the whole film.  But what a touching performance in this smaller role!
So, now we know, somebody CAN make 'em like they used to!  I forgive you for THE STORY OF US, Jessie; just please give us another CORRINA, CORRINA!",982886400,5,1836,4.525835866261398

The music is superb (I bought the soundtrack) and always gets me singing and popping my fingers.
Some of my favorite moments are when Whoopi steps off the bus and grinds out her cigarette with her pointy-toed shoe; the scene at the drive-in diner with Patrica Darbo (love her accent); the magic stoplights; Lois and ""Queen for a Day""; the beautiful scene where Corrina and Molly are listening to ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" and Manny is looking out over the city; when Corrina and Percy stick their tongues out at each other; when Corrina dangles a chandelier piece from her ear and tells Molly ""No we can't; we simply can't""; when Manny mistakenly calls Corrina Molly's mother; when Manny wins the Bromide account but Jenny spoils the moment; when Molly calls Corrina and the dog is between Corrina and Anthony; when Manny puts his arm around Corrina while Molly's flying the kite; when Manny and Corrina kiss while dancing; when Manny kisses Corrina outside her sister's house.
Okay, so I liked ALL the moments! Anyway, one final tidbit. When TNN first showed the movie, they interviewed Jessie Nelson, the writer, director, and producer (I think). She said that the story was based on her life. Her widowed father hired a black housekeeper, and young Jessie wished they would get married and the housekeeper would be her new mom.
I wish the romantic storyline had been more developed; but what little was there was done beautifully and tenderly by Liotta and Goldberg. I read somewhere that Whoopi really wanted to play the love interest for Liotta and advised Nelson not to hire a Halle Berry-type (read beautiful black woman). Her reason was because she wanted to show that someone as handsome as Liotta could really fall for a woman who society may not think of as externally beautiful but who is exceptionally beautiful on the inside.",982886400,20,2340,4.837905236907731
641796,3,6303347665,"Corrina, Corrina is a kind of underrated and cute movie with subthemes about race. Whoopi Goldberg plays a college educated woman who has no choice but to work as domestic help. She is hired as a nanny and maid in Ray Liotta's household after his wife dies and he needs help with his daughter (Tina Majorino). The daughter grows extremely depressed and introverted after her mother's death and Goldberg's influence helps to bring the girl out of her shell again. Eventually Liotta and Goldberg begin to talk a lot and begin to learn more about one another, and there is a chemistry between their characters. Meanwhile, Liotta struggles at work (he is an advertising executive, trying to create clever jingles) and Goldberg struggles with her family. Goldberg's family wants her to settle down and be with a black man and to stop harbouring feelings about Liotta's character. Eventually there are conflicts both about their mixed race relations and about how Corrina (Goldberg) is taking care of the daughter and not consulting Liotta about these decisions. However, as you would expect, everything is resolved in the end. This is not at all a bad movie and in fact is relatively delicate with the subject matter as sensitive as it could be.",982800000,7,1240,4.90952380952381
641827,5,6303347665,"This is a fine movie. Nelson, Liotta, Goldberg and Majorino excel themselves with wonderful dry humor, and they are greatly helped by the fine performances in the other roles, particularly Don Ameche. What disturbed me a little was, right at the end where Corinna comes out to find Mannie praying (for the first time), my wife said ""now she'll just give herself into servitude"". I was astonished that she might have that view of marriage.",976665600,,438,4.8533333333333335
641828,5,6303347665,"This is one of the best movies ever.  Like 'House Of Cards' it deals with the childhood loss of a beloved parent with touching depth and gentleness.  Whoopi Goldberg is masterful in her multifaceted inteligence and humor.  She surprises the grieving Dad continiously and is the only thing keeping little Molly from blaming herself for her mothers death.  Ray Liotta is excelent as the grieving father of 6 year old Molly, the only movie i have liked him in since field of dreams(he was a ball player) it was nice to see him play a nice guy for a change. A wonderful example that much breaking down of racial barriers is not nessarily accomplished with bus tours and protest rallies, but with gentle persuasion and subtle strength of character.  this is a touching, sentimental piece easily made fun of by those who balk at that sort of thing.  ignore them and enjoy it anyway.  i wish the writer/director would bring us more, it may be one of those once in a lifetime crowning achievements, i can only hope it will not stand alone.  everytime i see it i find something new to like about it.  i can not say enough good things...  it feels so real, how often can you say that about the latest big budget release?",974937600,5,1210,4.509174311926605

641830,5,6303347665,"""Corrina, Corrina"" is one of the best movies of Whoopi Goldberg. It is  only second to ""Jumpin Jack Flash"".  We can see the whole spectrum of  Whoopi acting abilities in the great movie.  Comedy: She brings Molly (Tina  Majorino) out of her shell by telling her she had magical power to change  the signal lights.  Drama: She dealt with her sister indifference to her  college education and possible romance with Mandy (Ray Liotta). Romance:  When she accepts an invitation to dinner to the slow dance and kiss from  Mandy.  Miss Majorino was wonderful as the little girl that was moved to  silent because of the death of her mother.  Mr. Liotta was very good in the  role as a father that wanted to do what was best for his daughter and also  be happy.  From the moment Mandy decided to cook dinner for Corrina, defend  her at the restaurant, and apologize for not asking Jenny to leave, I  wondered when he would take off of the ring that said that he was married.  I hope to see more work from Jessie Nelson, writer and director of this  great movie for Whoopi.",965692800,2,1064,4.471204188481676
641831,5,6303347665,"I love this movie so much. Though sometimes, after having not viewed it for a couple of months, I may forget to list it as a favourite, it really does touch me somewhere inside. My family (I'm only 15, you know) has tired  of my watching ""Corrina,Corrina"" every time I catch it on TV, but  I don't mind. Those small touches, just things that separate each  director's work from another's, are so soothing to me. I relish the style,  as well as the 50's jazz and culture. When Corrina lays the sheet on the  bed in slow motion,and when Molly sings of pennies from Heaven at the pool,  I smile uncontrollably.  I just Love it.",960940800,6,624,4.373913043478261
641832,5,6303347665,We often forget that Whoopi Goldberg can do drama too. Remember Color Purple ?  This movie is so touching & should give a message & some hope to all of us.  The little girl Tina Marjorino is so cut & sweet  & play so well. As for Ray Liotta ; why don't we see him more often ?  He is a very good actor. Anybody can watch this movie & I especially  recommend it to youngsters &.... to people who have difficulties with  people of another coulour than theirs.,956793600,2,457,4.078651685393258

I don't know how many times I've seen this and still I let all my  feelings go!  I appreciate Ray Liotta'a performance more than any of his  because it's so gentle.  And Tina Marjorino is absolutely precious.  This  movie delves into more than you even realize watching it the first few  times and I think I'll find more and more in the future.  Very few movies  are worth watching so many times--it'll rip at your heart and make you  happy to be alive all at once.  I am thankful for this movie.",943660800,20,651,4.378151260504202
