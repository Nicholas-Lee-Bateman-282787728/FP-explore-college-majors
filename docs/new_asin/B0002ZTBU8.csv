8035403,4,B0002ZTBU8,"This no-budget gem relies on what director/writers rely on when they've got no money: wit, originality, and intelligence.
The film, actually a comedic mystery/drama, uses the mock-documentary format as its framework. Characters are introduced and created with a few quick, deft strokes, with wonderful performances by all (especially a cadre of misfit parking enforcement officers). You really come to care about this odd, self-important little group of oddballs.  Eventually they emerge as more interesting, complex and principled than the condescending ""film-maker"" who initially sets out to mock them in his documentary, but gets drawn into investigating what may or may not turn out to be a peculiar conspiracy involving a mysterious parking-enforcement guru.
Great fun, very deftly done, and a triumph of imagination and wit over big budgets.",1102723200,8,847,5.6171875
