6258719,5,B00ID6UJUO,"YES!!! This is not a copy. The reviews of this before August 28, 2014 are referring to unofficial copy being sold which has been going around the internet for years. This is released by Universal. The picture is great! It's worth every penny. Every Hayley Mills fan should own it. It's about time they released it and I'm very happy!",1410825600,49,333,4.566666666666666
6258720,5,B00ID6UJUO,"Wired, but as this was the only format available in the last five years I will keep it.  This is one of my favorite Haley Mills films.  Thank you.",1405814400,,146,4.0

6258722,2,B00ID6UJUO,This movie has obviously been recorded from some substandard source.  This one needs to be digitally remastered then reissued by the content owners.  I would have enjoyed watching it had it been of better quality.,1403568000,10,213,5.057142857142857
6258723,4,B00ID6UJUO,"This is a lovely and charming movie.  It is silly, but it is very fun.  I would almost risk buying to be what I believe to be a poor quality copy DVD of it, as it is a movie I've searched for for years.  I recall seeing it for the first time very well.  This and a later film Pretty Polly, aka A Matter of Innocence, are well worth searching for and getting.  They are forgotten treasures.",1403395200,,389,4.0
6258724,2,B00ID6UJUO,"If you like Hayley Mills films (my wife and I do), the film was fine, the copy was bad.

The DVD appeared to be copied from Encore cable channel (there was even scheduling information about the next several films on Encore at the end of the movie).

The DVD quality was very poor.  It was grainy, had freeze glitches, and poor sound quality.",1401148800,12,341,4.380952380952381
6258725,5,B00ID6UJUO,"This is a little gem. It's great to see Haley and her great actor father having a bit of fun. The three-way chemistry with James MacArthur is highly entertaining. Warmth, humor, romance and a little excitement make this  a delightful morsel of pure entertainment. I sure wish someone would release it on DVD. I've been looking for it for a long time,",1398643200,6,350,4.645161290322581
6258726,5,B00ID6UJUO,"This is the only film of Hayley Mills that is not available on DVD, and that situation should be amended post haste! It is a charming coming of age love story and mild adventure that also stars Hayley's father Sir John Mills and the late James MacArthur (of Hawaii 5-0 fame).",1393804800,12,275,4.411764705882353

6258741,5,B00ID6UJUO,"I first saw this movie as a teen. Loved it and searched for a DVD for a long time. A few years ago, I saw it for sale on the internet and ordered it. It apparently was a pirated copy, awful in every aspect. Therefore, I was a bit reluctant to order this one. Am I glad I did! This DVD met all my expectations. The sound was great and the quality of the picture was good. Since this is an older movie, the graphics are not as sharp as newer HD movie releases; more like when the movie first came out back in the day. Digital remastering might correct that problem. If you are a Hayley Mills fan, I recommend this particular DVD because it is a copy from the Universal Vault and not a pirated copy from a third-party site.",1490227200,6,720,4.077464788732394

6258770,2,B00ID6UJUO,"I am a very big fan of Hayley Mills (I grew up with her) and this was one of my favorite movies with her as we both ""grew up"" together.  But unfortunately I am unable to hear this.  I am severely hearing impaired.  It does not have closed captioning nor does it have English subtitles.  It is very frustrating.  Too many of the movies I grew up with do not come with closed captions, English subtitles or SDH.  Since my generation often have hearing problems we tend to miss out on enjoying the movies and TV series that finally come to DVD because of this. (Another case in point: the series ""Sisters"")  PLEASE Amazon, include a way for my generation to hear our old favorites.",1462147200,,678,4.376

6258813,5,B00ID6UJUO,"I love this movie from my childhood and have been WAITING for a decent DVD  release. I ordered a DVD a few years ago that was awful. A bad quality copy, obviously from a showing on TV, that never played all the way through. Although I was a little skeptical to order, with Amazon's return policy, I felt comfortable giving it a try. It's perfect!  Good sound. Lovely picture. Everything you expect from a quality studio's DVD release. The fine print on the back of the case says, "" disc is expected to play back in DVD video 'play only' devices, and may not play in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives.""

6258820,5,B00ID6UJUO,"This was one of my ""all-time favorite"" cast with Hayley Mills and her dad John. It takes place on an old sailboat sailing  in the open seas. They run into a yacht with a bored passenger (James McCarthur of Hawaii 5-O fame), he comes aboard and a romance develops with the ship's daughter, Hayley. It is very sweet and wonderful as the daughter is a ""tom-boy""! I found this several years ago and have enjoyed it ever since! It is back when love stories were simple! There is also, some funny scenes with the three of them trying to find treasure and running into some ""old pirates"" ! It is worth the watch! Enjoy!",1422489600,,612,4.368421052631579

Now, as I'm nearing retirement, Amazon finally has it.  Watching it brought back good memories from the 1960's.  I managed to remember most of the plot points, but had a few surprises along the way.  Just one nit:  The cover would lead you to believe that you'll see Hayley Mills in a 2-piece swimsuit.  Nope.",1422144000,,433,4.405063291139241
6258822,5,B00ID6UJUO,"I am a lifelong Haley Mills fan, I grew up with her classic 1960's and Disney films, and this is a missing gem! Too bad it's not available for streaming. I loved it! I'd say one of her most enjoyable movies. She's older (middle-older teen) in this, and it only offers more depth and romantic escapades for her fans! The setting (modern day pirate's boat & cove) and adventure, with her relationship with her old salt dad, and her budding interest in a handsome, young modern man from the city, is refreshing, the 60's appeal is fun, and her character is a rough & tumble tomboy that you'd better not mess with! However, she's feeling soft new feelings she hasn't experienced before, and the coming-of-age conflict is portrayed very well and really fun to watch. This is now one of my very favorite films of hers (along with Gypsy Girl). :) I had never seen this one before, so glad it's available on DVD at least!",1421020800,15,913,4.506024096385542

I hadn't seen it since the 80's but it's still worth while and raises a few smiles along the way.",1419379200,2,300,4.375

6258830,4,B00ID6UJUO,"Funny comedy about a young girl who travels the seas on a large sailboat with her father (John Mills, who has the ability of talking people out of almost anything) and their adventures with two groups of modern day pirates always trying to double cross each other.
Hayley Mills gets to meet her love when rich American James MacArthur, a young lawyer who has just passed the bar, comes aboard to fish for a few weeks with them.  He then finds himself caught up in their adventures.  Nice family comedy with Hayley in her first coming of age film.  Hayley Mills was every young man's girl next door sweetheart in those days.",1417910400,,623,4.544642857142857

6258835,5,B00ID6UJUO,"I saw this movie as a teen for the first time and always wanted to see it again. I was delighted to find it on DVD. I was concerned about what the quality would be like since I have a 65"" HD TV. It was wonderful and not at all grainy in appearance as some old movies are on DVD. It was delightful to watch it again and I chuckled through it many times.  This is one of those movies of a father daughter relationship and of the daughter turning into a young woman. I love her spunky spirit and her tomboy ways and it is fun to watch her slowly change as she is unsure why or if she wants to. Lots of laughs and good hearted fun.  It was even more fun knowing that the father daughter team on film are also father daughter in real life. John and Hayley Mills do a wonderful job of playing off of each other. Spirited and at times very heart touching seeing the love in the father's eyes and not knowing how to really show it. I think many that would like a movie about simpler times would enjoy it. I am so glad to have it. Thank you.",1413417600,31,1032,3.956730769230769
