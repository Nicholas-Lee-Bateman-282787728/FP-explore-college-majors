8374397,5,B002MZZUB0,"I fell in love with this movie when a little girl.  I used to watch it when it came on every couple of months on Saturday afternoon in the late 50's.  She was my heroine.  I wanted to be like her.  She was a strong woman who could take care of herself and didn't need someone to look after her.  She was talented, strong, smart, funny and beautiful.  This movie is very basic, it is true.  The acting in it is not the best but it tells a wonderful story.",1439769600,,454,3.977777777777778

8374401,3,B002MZZUB0,"SINISTER CINEMA is an Oregon-based DVD-R mfr. that specializes in obscure 'B' unit movies. Sinister's dubs are from unrestored 16 and 35mm film stock, thus quality varies with condition of their antique celluloid. None are pristine, yet none are so degraded as to be unviewable. Some Sinister transfers are in fact quite decent.

THE MARSHAL'S DAUGHTER was the second and last film produced by Ken Murray (he appears here as a riverboat gambler). Murray is best remembered as drunken Doc Willoughby in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MAN-WHO-SHOT-LIBERTY-VALANCE/dp/B001TWT0AE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE</a>&nbsp;(1962). Also in a comic card playing cameo are Arkansas-born Jimmy Wakely, one of last in a long line of singing cowboys, former oater star Johnny Mack Brown and super-sized Buddy Baer, younger brother of ex-heavyweight champ Max.

Murray designed this minor western to showcase Miss Anders. She was a regular on Ken's half-hour variety show, and their relationship may have been more than a professional one. In any event, curvaceous Anders has a dual role here. During the day she's retired marshal Hoot Gibson's sweet daughter but at night Laurie is ""El Coyote,"" the fearless scourge of outlaws everywhere!

In flashback we learn that Marshal Ben Dawson (Gibson) is widowed due to an injun attack upon a wagon train he and  his small family were part of, a raid organized by a scarfaced white man. Dawson raises young Laurie alone and teaches her to ride and shoot. When Laurie wants to be a lawman like her dad, he refuses even though she informs him of overheard plans for a bank robbery. Marshal Ben and 'Smiling Billy' (Murray) lay in wait for the robbers and when a shootout results, Laurie and her dead-on aim save the day.

""El Coyote"" is born after the marshal's brother comes home mortally wounded by Trigger Gans (Duncan), the same scarred hombre who organized both the bank job and the long ago raid that claimed Laurie's mom. Incognito, Miss Dawson rides the darkened countryside, defeating or scaring off evildoers.

""Marshal's Daughter"" is often compared to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HIGH-NOON/dp/B0016MLIKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HIGH NOON</a>&nbsp;(1952) due to its many shots of clock faces and a theme song performed by Tex Ritter. That comparison however isn't at all favorable to this slight picture.

8374402,1,B002MZZUB0,"This is an attempt to follow up on ""High Noon"" where Tex Ritter's singing vocals highlight the action on screen very effectively. Here they have built a low budget Western movie around a Western song that Tex Ritter had recorded, the title of the movie. They attempted with an interesting cast to piece together a movie on the theme but it is done dreadfully. Better this movie be forgotten and the song as recorded be remembered.",1279238400,,430,4.671052631578948
