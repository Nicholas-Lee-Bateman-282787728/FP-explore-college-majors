3417487,4,B0018IYTF0,"This movie was beautiful. A bit more on the love scenes than I prefer, but enjoyable none the less. The action scenes were very nice, but I would have preferred more of them. Enjoyed the way the movie was cast as well. I wouldn't pay $15 for it, but if you can grab it for under $10, go for it. That is if you already have a good collection of DVD's and are building.",1227484800,,367,3.972972972972973
3417488,3,B0018IYTF0,"First of all, the DVD I bought does not have English subtitle. It has only Chinese subtitle even though it speaks Mandarin. So, it's very hard for us to completely understand the movie because we know only a little bit of Cantonese.

The fighting scenes are thrilling. The costumes are beautiful. The ending is extremely depressing because the Empress lost all the people she cared for - her lover and loyal followers. There's one scene that is very touching. It's when the Empress let go of her enemies after defeating them. She did not kill them because she wanted to live in peace with them as neighbors. It's an exceptional kindness. It makes this movie different from others of the same kind.

There's one scene that is so illogical that I don't like it. It's when Donnie Yen, all by himself, attacked a group of hundreds soldiers. He tried to kill the general within the group but of course ending up getting killed. A normal general would have run away and took revenge at another time.

It's still worth seeing once for curiosity.",1211328000,,1038,4.66120218579235
3417489,5,B0018IYTF0,"All I can say about this movie is that it was very well done even though the English in the subtitles were not grammatically correct for English. This was a movie and story that Willy S would have loved. I find movies like this trying to capture the essence of times in our history refreshing when the anachronisms are kept to a minimum. The Lantern of Heaven is a metaphor but adds a nice romantic touch to the movie. It had a moment of comedy here and there, a good dose of romance, action galore, and a feel for realism I have not seen in a long time in any new (at least to me) movie release, but this is a classic tragedy with a sort of happy (ironically) ending.
A king dies in battle but he dies from treachery among his own court. Although the king chose another to rule his sword was handed to his daughter who by blood line and possession of the sword becomes the queen. Then the treachery runs really deep. The Princess steps down from the throne only to cause a coup de tat among her ranks. She winds up returning to try to stop the chaos that now consumes her court.
Now I am very draconian and am pretty unsympathetic to a lot and the sight of blood does not rattle me any more. I actually could feel for the princess at the end of the movie which says a lot at least for me. She lost everything in her personal life that mattered to her and still became the empress when really she didn't want to. I could feel how hollow she felt trying to see the bright side of things as ruler. I have found a lot of movies being intentionally made these days to be senselessly violent. This movie had a point and it was about how senseless and tragic the quest for power can be. The movie didn't seem to me to be placed in any geographically specific time or place but it did portray a time when violence rocked the very fabric of a young nation a lot like China's early history. In the past differences between nations usually meant a lot of blood shed. The princess in the movie makes a bold move to try to end a long feud between her neighboring nation by not killing her adversary when she defeats him in battle. This movie also made a very loud statement about neighbors living in peace. If only more would listen to that message...
Do not come to this movie as some sort of purist or ""educated"" critic. You will be disappointed. This movie has heart which a lot of Hollywood has lost. I went into it looking at the elemental values of cinema. It was done with style, realism, excellent battle scenes, nothing was over done, no weak ""touching"" moments and best of all there was romance but no sex! Refreshing viewing! It has class and is well worth the view at least once.
William Shakespeare would have been proud of this one. It was like Hamlet and King Lear crammed together and given a very Asian twist with a squeeze of very tart lemon, Shaken but not stirred, poured over VERY cold ice, and served with a lot of heart.
I had to give it a five star because it really was set against a very biased benchmark. Many do not appreciate foreign cinema unfairly but then again apples and oranges folks. I'm not very giving in my ratings. For example I hated the movie Babel for many reasons. Tripe like that should not pollute the silver screen. (Yes I did write a review of it and I hated it and wished I could give it NEGATIVE FIVE STARS for being such an unworthy pile of anti gun tripe!) This movie on the other hand had honor, betrayal, love (on several levels), sacrifice, treachery, and was not ""Kung-Fu Cinema."" The battles were very well and  realistically done and the acting was not washed out or hokey. In a way it was sort of like Ran by Akira Kurisawa vaguely. If you appreciate good foreign cinema, Samurai classics, or just need to see something that is not like everything else, WATCH THIS!
The Koreans have been coming out swinging fists like nobody's business trying to show their chops at movie making. There is a Korean Animation called Yobi the Nine Tailed Fox (That is the American title. The Korean title is Yeu Woo Bie) which caught my attention with a vengance. Right now it is hard to find but it can be had. If you do not get misty eyes at the end of that one you are a heartless beast! Hang your head in shame! I had to buy it after finding it on accident. I think Korea is coming of age in cinema and look foreword to more from that nation in both movies and Animation!",1210464000,8,4404,4.280575539568345
3417490,3,B0018IYTF0,"Without the benefit of English subtitles, this is how it looks like.  Full costume martial period drama.  Promising beginning with Gladiator type battle sequence.  King of our army gets an arrow into his left chest and is brought out of the battle, leaving warrior generals to complete the battle.  In his tent, King breathes normally as he checks out his sand-pit battlefield mock-up.  King gives detailed instructions to Generals in spite of arrowhead sticking out of his back.  Viewers either buy this or exit the theatre.  One trusted warrior strangles him and twists the arrow during a private conference.  Princess takes over command instead of strangler.  But first, warriors gets to refine her martial arts.  Princess Kelly gets knocked off a stickfight on a floating log, gets thrown into the mud in close quarters swordfight, learns to shoot ""rubber""-tipped dummy arrows in horseback chases through the forest.  That was the entertaining part of the montage which shows a filial princess grow into a warrior Queen (there are too few soldiers in this movie to justify the rank of ""Empress"").  There is a novel ambush by blowpipe darts which looks pretty realistic.  The show degenerates at this point into something mushy which is the obligatory ""plot"".  Finally, there is an all out battle epic.  Great beginning and end, with excellent costumes.  The few hundred armoured horsemen running round in the dust, pennants and all, gives the impression of tens of thousands of people.  Intelligent re-use of faceless soldiers must have dispensed with CGI.

Good points: no kung fu moves.  Sword fights and archery similar in style to that seen in Gladiator.  Medieval armour looks realistic.  No CGI feel (even if they did CGI) to this movie.  It is entirely possible to conscript this kind of army without CGI or to outfit an entire division of the People's Liberation Army.  The transition of the Princess into a full-fedged Mulan type warrior Queen is simpler than the convoluted route Russell Crowe took in Gladiator.

Sucker punches:  King gets killed in private by a Commodus-like character.  Twisting a round shaft of the arrow does not appreciably facilitate death.  Arrow-Shafted king still too talkative to be smothered Richard Harris style.

Verdict: good for Gladiator withdrawal.  Alexander (Colin Farrell) did nothing for Gladiator cold turkey.  Sort of entertaining, but still awaiting Maximus, the prequel to Gladiator.",1209340800,2,2440,5.182051282051282

I will say it does have a fair amount of violence after all it is titled "" The Empress and the Warriors"" it is also fun and exiting ...... I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this film.

3417523,3,B0018IYTF0,"A chick flick.  Sort of.  This seems to be a vehicle for Kelly Chen but what I saw was that it was another Donnie Yen film (he is front & center in the credits.  I liked it, I didn't like it.

WHAT I LIKED:
- Good action
- Decent character development and a story that tied in.
- Good actors
- Story moved along

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:
- Not much action for Donnie Yen.  He is a bonafide star so why use him like he is a mere sidekick?  And even if he is a sidekick, I want to see more of him.  I think he got maybe 20 minutes altogether, it just didn't feel like much and his character was meh .....
- Kung Fu (when there was some) was just ok.  Too much sword fighting.
- Story was not believable.  You can't train someone that quickly to be a warrior.
- Pushing on us the female ""I am woman, hear me roar"".  As a woman I find it insulting and I'm tired of it.  Can't we just all agree that in that era, during that time in history that women just didn't play these roles?  It's really ok!  No need to impose the agenda on us.  Irony:  My husband didn't feel the same way, I could just be more sensitive in this area.

In the end we agreed it felt more like a chick flick.  I heard myself saying more than once ""Yeah, right ..."" or ""Come, on,  that's not believable"".  However, it is fiction.  It is a movie.  It's supposed to entertain.  And it did.  It wasn't all fighting but it did feel more like a love story.  I did appreciate that they did try to tell a story & I was entertained.  Will I watch it again?  Meh ....",1424044800,2,1520,3.914473684210526

So much importance to the leadership of the Empress, however she never was able to deliver , be it leadership, military acumen or inspiration. She was mostly a cry baby or a love bird.

Mix the ingredients well and then add in great action scenes, a love interest, and the death of a central character.  What you get is ""Empress and the Warriors"" as well as most other movies of this type!

3417582,3,B0018IYTF0,"AN EMPRESS AND THE WARRIORS

Let me say from the start of this that this is indeed a good movie, it is far from perfect but it is a good film. ""An Empress and the Warriors"" is a wonderfully done and shot some what epic war film that really is a romance at heart. That is kinda were the flaws are in this film, it did not pick what it wanted to be. Or better yet I feel that it failed in blending the different styles together perfectly. Still there is enough here that will keep you entertained including the always entertaining Donnie Yen. The story is of war, treachery, love, and honor, all things that could make a great film.

Tha Yan Kingdom is in the midst of a civil war between warlords and seems to be at the center of it all as we begin. At the moment the battle is with the Zhao Kingdom and like any good leader the King's are on the battle field as well. But it is in this opening battle that the king of Yan is injured and gives the leader ship reigns over to Murong Xuehu [Donnie Yen]. This angers Hu Ba [Guo Xiaodong] who is actually a blood relative of the king, he in turn kills the king in order to take over. But things get a little crazy in the Hall of Swords and Hu Ba does not agree with Murong being given the role of new king. Why you might ask even when the king gave him the leadership role, well because he has no royal blood. So in order to deflect all of this Murong gives the role as ruler over to Yan Feier [Kelly Chen], she is now the Empress but first she must be trained to do battle.

It is after her training that Hu Ba sends his warriors after her in the forest and is some what successful since she does not return to the kingdom. This of course puts the ruler title up for grabs if she is not found. During this time she is looked after by a mysterious man in the woods, this man is Duan Lanquan [Leon Lai]. This is where a romance starts to simmer underneath everything else and eventually drives the film. So the film kicks into many types of styles from here as the kingdom starts to crumble from betrayal and lack of a pure leader.

Now after reading all that I can assure you that there is even more going on here and that may be what keeps it from being great. Director Ching Siu Tang really knows how to craft a good action film and the camera department really did do an amazing job here. Before we get into anything else I have to say that there are some beautifully amazing shots in this film. Any way I feel like the script and the direction lacked a little when the romantic portions of the film were introduced. The film would have been much stronger as a straight action/drama, or a straight romantic/drama, if it would have made that choice I feel it would have been better. Still it is more than possible that they could have blended all of it together better, other films have, but they didn't.

Another thing I felt need work was the relation ship between Murong Xuehu and Yan Feier as well as Yan Feier and Duan Lanquan. First there is the brother/sister type relationship between Murong Xuehu and Yan Feier, when watching it I could see it was there but by the end it felt like it could have been so much more. Especially the end involving Murong Xuehu, it could have made that moment more powerful in my opinion. Now Yan Feier and Duan Lanquan is explored more since it is the romance in the film, but again it felt like it was not fully developed.

As for the good I have mentioned of course the action and the cinematography but the acting is good in this as well. Donnie Yen is very good in a dramatic role since he usually does not get these types, but I thought he did a great job, especially his characters curtain call. Leon Lai did a good job as the Empress's romantic interest and his character ended up being something special. Guo Xiaodong was particularly good as the evil Hu Ba and well every one was really good in this, elevating the film up with their performance.

In comes the lovely Kelly Chan as our lead Yan Feier, the newly crowned Empress. Now I will say before anything else about her I felt she did a good job with the role as well, but her character was not fully developed at the screenplay stage. I feel she did what she could with what was written, but the character could have been more. I understand she is a character that was not meant to take over as ruler so she should be getting beat down in training by Donnie Yen's character. I understand that I do but she should have been a little tougher or at least tougher looking by the end of it. Now I understand she needs to be the damsel in distress and be taken care of by Duan, but once again a little more toughness would have added to the believability of the character being an Empress.

Also the wonderful underlying story of treachery, betrayal, and conspiracy could have been explored more. But it never really reaches its full potential and once again could have been so much more. But for all you action guys the action in this film is really good and fun, gotta love those battles. This is a good movie regardless of how it sounds from previous statements and is not horrible at all. But you should go in without high expectations and you may enjoy it a little more. I have to admit I like a little more with each viewing. I do recommend this film to any fan of this kind or if you like me are collecting all of the Dragon Dynasty films even if [like me] you own original releases. The Dragon Dynasty release has a great making of and a wonderful commentary by Bey Logan.",1283644800,4,5525,4.230331753554502

Some slightly slow pacing in the middle and the many attempts by the villain to kill the princess can get a bit silly at times, but the ending is spectacular (though not the one I would have chosen myself). Donnie Yen shows that he can really act (as in Yip Man) and is not just kick-butt beef cake.

Maybe people liked it because they felt cool watching it with subtitles? If you have seen ""House of Flying Daggers"" ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and ""Hero"" then you have this movie covered. It is in that same category and dosen't give you anything new. The flow is off too. The big fight scene at the end where the main good general whatever his name is lets his hair down and pulls out this huge sword to take on a small army is horrible. I know the early hong kong movies gave this sort of ""god like"" ability to it's characters but this is now not then. They also left something to the imagination. These fight scenes are just full out 1 man vs 1000 and no class or style in the sequence. ""Hey lets put tons of crap fighting in our movie to wow the stupid predictably easy to please masses.

3417597,3,B0018IYTF0,"2008 seems to be the year for Chinese epic dramas. ""An Empress and the Warriors"" was released before the ""Romance of Three Kingdoms"" related films by Daniel Lee (Three Kingdoms) and John Woo (Red Cliff). The film is helmed by Tony Ching Siu Tang (Naked Weapon) and if you are familiar with this director's past works, you'll know that he is a good action director. However, I do believe the skill of good storytelling eludes him--""An Empress and the Warriors"" is pure brainless fun, with decent production values and may well be a good ""date"" movie.

After the kingdom of Yan is mortally wounded after a battle with the Zhao army, the king chooses to leave command to an orphan, named Muyong Xuehu (Donnie Yen) who is not related to the royal family. This bold decision raises the ire of Hu Ban (Guo Xiao-Dong), the king's nephew who is ready and willing to lead. Yan Feier (Kelly Chen) is the king's daughter and was bestowed the sacred ""Swallow sword"" (I know!) as her father's dying wish, to give to Muyong. However, when the time came to announce Muyong's promotion, Hu Ban and Diao Erbao renounces the claim saying that the king should not be one with no royal blood in his veins. To keep the peace and avoid mutiny, Feier seizes power with Muyong's support--and undergoes military training to prove her worthiness to lead. Hu Ban plots to discredit the princess before she is crowned as the empress, assassination is even an option --a power struggle threatens to weaken the foundations of the Yan Kingdom.

I'm not sure how to begin, the film's plot is so flimsy and uninspired. It abandons the potentials of a conspiracy during a period when leadership is important in favor of a budding romance between Feier and Duan (played by Leon Lai) which makes rather fun but definitely predictable and boring. The character of Feier does look like a princess but the way she is portrayed by the script is rather silly and lacks credibility. Kelly Chen does look like a beautiful princess, but the kind that would act in a disney movie. The script by James Yuen Sai-sang is also very light, the threat of destruction is overshadowed by romance? I'm not sure, Feier and Muyong kept on referring to her as the ""one to unite the country"" but just what is this ""Yan Kingdom""? All that came to view are buildings and shacks and aside from the ninjas and Duan, no common folk is visible. I do feel that the war backdrop is just meant as a plot device to gain sympathy and to set up the scenes of overdone sentimentality.

While I also disliked its use of the usual histrionics, the film does have some charm. However, unbelievable and stylish Kelly Chen's training sequences with Donnie Yen, it has somewhat diverting. However, the film abandons this device rather quickly and falls to the usual romantic gimmicks. The romance between Duan and Feier may be nice to the female species but it just kills the film's overall impact. I thought I was in a dumb teen flick, and while the screenplay has the usual elements of loyalty, sacrifice, duty, compassion and betrayal, it never executed them well enough and opted for a perfunctory romance to add complications to its premise of a ""threatened kingdom"". The storyline just wasn't interesting and lacked inspiration, the film isn't compelling and interesting.

The acting for the most part is a mixed bag. Kelly Chen is very pretty and charismatic but I had some reservations as to how convincing she was as a strong-willed princess. I would give her the benefit of a doubt since the script is so dry that it gave her so little to work with. Her acting is very cute and charming, her interactions with the tree-dwelling Duan may appeal to the female audience, but it suffers from a lack of consistency that doesn't fit into the film's plot. The film does have huge continuity issues and feels undercooked. Donnie Yen will be Donnie Yen--complete with his overacting.

Now as for the action sequences, there are quite a good number of them. Director Tony Ching knows his stuff when shooting action sequences. He uses multiple camera angles and the moves are visually impressive. The ninja-like assassins and the chase sequences were very cool. The assault in the tree-home of Duan is fast-paced and stylish, complete with cool close-ups with attitude. The battle scenes were decent but not in the same caliber as other Chinese epics of this kind. There is some blood as folks are stabbed and impaled in some very sensitive places. The action has a lot of posturing with attitude complete with the wind blowing strands of hair. Donnie Yen is a very showy actor but none can deny that he does have a presence as a martial artist. Yen is complete with bone-crushing machismo as he fights hundreds of Hu Ban's foot soldiers in the final act. Truly exaggerated and unrealistic appeal for an epic but good enough for an action movie.

So what is the final verdict? Well, the usual stereotypical Hong Kong ""cuteness"" just would never match the tone and atmosphere of Mainland China's Epic Wuxia films. You can tell that the film should have a more serious tone and to incorporate a cute romance into its premise just bores the heck out of me. The action choreography does prove diverting and all it all the film is just a practice of a mainstream stylish action flick. The leads are definitely photogenic and the visuals were decent; this film is definitely geared to fans of these performers who would watch anything they appear in. ""An Empress and the Warriors"" is just another of those stupid commercial flicks that should be watched with VERY low expectations. It is watchable for 90 minutes but definitely a forgettable experience; it just fails in comparison to the best China has to offer.

So anyways, yes it is a bootleg, a very high quality one though.  Most of the time the ones I see are in a plastic sleeve, but this one had the dvd cover and it was sealed, and had the security sticker on the top like most real dvds.  But what made me know it was a bootleg is the front cover.  Very cheaply done, its just a cut out of Donnie Yen placed in an action scene background.  The the word warrior was suppose to be plural but it wasn't.  The movie itself had some pixelation and the subtitles I got to give it to them, fairly well done, I've seen worst.
