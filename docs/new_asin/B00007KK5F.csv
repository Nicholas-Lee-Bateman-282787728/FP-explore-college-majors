1818210,1,B00007KK5F,"I cannot believe I actually bought this DVD after reading everyones ratings ! lol
I live in the uk and ordered it from Amazon.com... I put it on last night and fell asleep after 30 mins (can't believe I lasted that long).
If you want a funny film buy Camp Blood or Killjoy (both are really bad films but contain bad acting), this film has good actors and tries to be dung and funny and it does not work, its just boring.
Sorry to seem a bit of a killjoy myself but wouldn't want to see anyone step into the same trap as me, I do enjoy dung films but I have started to try and improve my collection as I have had enough ribbing from my mates for a bad collection, this is bad !
I have Bloody Murder 2 on order ! Didn't realise it was related to Scream Bloody Murder (how thick of me!), can't wait to watch that !!!",1046822400,12,813,3.9938650306748467
1818211,4,B00007KK5F,Infested-A quirkey film about the death of a friend that brings together a group of collage kids. Unfortunately for them (and fortunately for the viewer) there are strange bugs that crawl into your skin and make you their cocoon until they exit the stomach in gory ways. The film stars Amy Jo Johnson and Zach Galligan. It was filmed in the same town that I live in. The sad part of it is: It had great potential but the obvious references to THE BIG CHILL and ALIEN are too obvious to the film-goers mind and eyes to ignore,1039046400,2,524,4.357142857142857
1818212,3,B00007KK5F,"A friend dies and all his old friends who have not seen each other in years go to the funeral, then to stay with each other in a remote house. Yes it has already been done. But in the other movie, how many people where then taken over by bugs and given (almost) eternal life? Bugs that evidently absorb their intelligence. Bugs that allow them to fall off a 2nd story roof without injury. Bugs that give them the power to climb that roof with a broken leg that prevented them from doing more than crawl before the bugs entered them. Bugs that allowed them to barely pause when they are impaled with a tire iron. Bugs that allow them to live on, and apparently see well enough to avoid torches swung at them, after decapitation.

The special effects are nothing to rave about and the blood looks painted on, no body to it and it was too bright a shade of red. The story was fairly predictable, especially the final scene. The scene where a guy who carved his own skinless leg with first a knife, then a razor, then dumped hydrogen peroxide on it and barely grimaced was not particularly believable.

Despite all that, I found it all entertaining and worth a N-flix rental :) Would I ever buy it? Heck no, having seen it once I can't imagine watching it again would cause me to have any sudden revelations.",1100044800,,1304,4.384297520661157
1818213,1,B00007KK5F,"Ha! Ha! Ha! (i'm really laughing, it's not sarcasm!)
Maybe it's because i didn't pay to watch this movie (if that's what you wanna call it..a movie!) and my friend did! Ha! ha! HA!
Okay, i'll try to be serious and tell you what to expect from this piece of garbage film...terrible acting, terrible story, the worst special effects i've seen since the 1980's , and what else...hmm..let me think...oh yes, 1 hour and a half of looking at your tv screen wondering ""What the hell is going on?""
That's all for me, if this review doesn't convince you to not watch this movie, then nothing will..ENJOY this stupid bug film and when it's done, watch it again and again and again and again and....",1090281600,6,688,4.512
1818214,1,B00007KK5F,"Perhaps I might have a high expectation, but correct me if I am wrong, this movie is quite bad. Besides the poor low-tech special effect, those actors and actresses really seem not knowing how to act. The plot doesn't make sense and never explains the cause and effect of the flies. This is a movie will make you shake your head at the end.",1085788800,3,340,4.328125
1818215,3,B00007KK5F,"""Infested"" is not poorly made, although the fly effects are far below today's standards.  It's just that the movie makes no sense.  We never find out why the flies are capable of doing what they do; how do they keep these bodies alive and moving?  And why exactly does the villain do this?  It's all muddled, but a few tense scenes and some good use of social comment (this is a satire on ""The Big Chill"" of course), make this a little better than most.",1072483200,,453,4.294117647058823
1818216,4,B00007KK5F,"Get out your bottle of RAID folks, cause it 'reviewin' time!
When the death of a man brings a group of friends together, they spend the day at the dead man's wie's house. It's an old house but something is lurking around it...killer CGI bugs!
It seems that our group is being attacked by mutant flies that feast on your insides (literally-you see them eat your heart and everything) and stay there as protection. The only way to kill them is by sunlight or one big bottle of RAID. And the bottle's empty....and the sun is setting soon.....
Yes, it was filmed in my home town. A girl or 2 I know are extras in it. No biggie. The film is good, but the terrible CGI effects make it a waste...almost.

1818217,4,B00007KK5F,"well, it's not about to win any oscars, if only because those only go to the mainstream (how boring!), but hey, it was funny. and i think, really, that that was the point. honestly, how many movies are scary enough that they don't even approach laughable? um... none i can think of... if only because laughter is what keeps things from getting too scary.
and that's what makes real horror-satire so difficult, and so wonderful when it's done right. of course, asking me to be objective about anything involving robert duncan mcneill is akin to requesting i cease breathing, but never mind that. rdm aside, the sheer irony of this piece is fantastic, as well as the casual dropping of one-liners, of both biting wit and silly understatement. in short... well... it's FUNNY.
as to the actual flies, i don't know, maybe it's some sort of metaphor. it's really inconsequential. the gore scenes are beautiful in that holy-grail-fruit-punch-blood sort of way; the only one that had me cringing was the scene in the bathroom with the razor and the fly-ridden leg. ouch, as well as yuck.
basically, if you enjoy serious drama and lack a whimsical sense of humor, go elsewhere. likewise if you take everything seriously. if you enjoy being highly amused and cheerfully poke fun at society in general, buy it.",1065398400,2,1299,4.829596412556054
1818218,2,B00007KK5F,"Zach Galligan's acting career peaked with ""Gremlins"" and its sequel. Since then, he's done mostly straight-to-video horror and sci-fi schlock, including getting top billing for ""Infested."" After viewing ""Infested,"" I can definitely say that Zach Galligan's resume is not going to gain any more prestige from this straight-to-video horror-satire fly-zombie flick.
I've read some prior reviews of ""Infested."" Some people absolutely hate the movie, saying it's a horrible excuse for bad CGI work and an inane, boring plot. Other reviews see it as a great example of social satire wrapped in a silly horror movie. I fall somewhere in between.
The first half of the movie is actually fairly entertaining. After a rather amusing graveside service, a group of old college friends gather at the home of their recently deceased former friend. They hang out, talk about the good old 80's (!) and regret their choices in life. It's all very reminiscent of ""The Big Chill.""
To gauge the tone of ""Infested,"" one can reference the scene in which a character proudly holds up a .45 record, saying, ""Does anyone remember these?"" He proceeds to play the record and, instead of a golden oldie, we're treated to ""Da Da Da,"" the song by Trio that gained popularity by its inclusion in a Volkswagen commercial! It's a silly song, a ""classic"" for this group of socially-stunted individuals who pine for their former glory. Dammit, it's funny.
Of course, a movie about killer flies wouldn't be complete without the killer flies. They eventually make their appearance (after a very gratuitous breast shot of a thirtysomething woman) and the fun turns to horror--albeit for about 15 minutes of the movie.
In this 15 minutes or so, we see several nice ""ewwww!"" scenes, including a girl getting blood puked on her, a decapitation after a severe and squirting neck wound, a crowbar through the side and a really nasty leg infection with flies growing in it. There's also a shower scene (sadly, no nudity from cutie Amy Jo Johnson of ""Felicity"" and ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"") replete with a swarm of flies. The dialog is appropriately goofy, including such memorable ones as ""They don't strike me as ordinary flies."" Dammit, it's funny!
So there's the first half of the movie. I was fairly impressed at this point. I mean, sure, I knew it wasn't going to win any awards, but it was cruising along nicely. The direction is serviceable, the acting was pretty darn good (from Galligan, the aforementioned cutie Ms. Johnson and Robert Duncan McNeill of ""Star Trek: Voyager"") and the gore effects were pretty impressive.
However, about 45 minutes in (30 minutes of ""The Big Chill Redux"" plus 15 minutes of the fly attacks), the movie quickly goes downhill. The majority of the last half of the movie involves the surviving characters fending fly-zombies off with torches and running around outside and inside the house trying to decide what to do. There's no suspense, and the comedic element is gone for all practical purposes. The gore is non-existent as well. In addition, there's a ""surprise"" revelation toward the end which is relatively boring and cringe-inducing. I have a pretty good feeling that it was supposed to be played for humor, but it was only worthy of a yawn.
One other note: Zach Galligan is a decent enough actor. In addition, He's a pretty nice guy. I actually talked to him one night in 1986 or so as he was waiting for a cab on 86th and Broadway in New York. So my advice to him is simply this: get a new agent, buddy. You deserve better.
First half of the movie: 4 out of 5 stars. The last half of the movie: 1 out of 5 stars. As a result, my final rating: 2 out of 5 stars. Rent it.",1050796800,17,3680,4.769592476489028

Well, the cover art on the DVD was nice.  It showed great promise...........unfulfilled.

The story is slightly stale; a group of pretentious twits gathers after a funeral and soon find themselves under siege by a never ending supply of killer mutant flies.  How they deal with the problem is less than compelling.  One by one they turn into fly-controlled nitwits given to attacking their friends in hopes of `turning' them.  (Once that's achieved you've got nowhere to go.)

It's pretty basic fare with subpar acting skills displayed.  The main problem is getting beyond the unlikable characters to care what happens to them.

At a sprightly 84 minutes it was 84 minutes too long.",1410825600,,689,4.982456140350878
7977563,2,B00007KK5F,I am a creature feature fanatic.  It was the title that caught my attention and the fact that I have never seen a killer fly movie.  I gave it two stars because the acting was horrible for the most part.  The story line was ridiculous also.  The two stars were given for the laughs it triggered from the shear dumbness of it all.,1360627200,,329,4.174603174603175

Movie starts with a funeral...ug...fast foward. Then we get boring people talking...talking... ug. Then we get the flies and effects and horror........even that is not fun anymore due to the impact of the beginning.... Im shutting  off the DVD..ahhh pain is ended.

7977566,1,B00007KK5F,"Infested (Josh Olson, 2002)

It's really kind of impressive that a movie this bad doesn't get shelved somewhere along the line. And yet here it is, in all its painfully cheesy glory, on my screen, daring me to turn it off. I almost gave in to the temptation, but I kept watching. For you, dear reader, so I can give you a full account of the true horror to be found here-- the ninety minutes of your life that you will never be able to get back if you rent this movie and sit down to watch it.

The story, what there is of it: A number of friends show up at the estate of one of their high-school buddies, who's killed himself. There's all the post-funeral bonding stuff, and everything's looking remarkably Big Chill when things go horribly, horribly wrong thanks to vicious, genetically-altered flies that possess humans and turn them into soulless murderers. Yes, you got that right.

As usual, the only reason to watch a movie like this is the cheesecake factor. Any Jo Johnson plays the dead guy's girlfriend (well, ex, I guess), and there is an obligatory scene where she shows a whole lot of skin. It is not, however, an out-and-out nude scene. Sorry, guys. There is also the gorgeous Lisa Ann Hadley (General Hospital/Port Charles), who's really starting to look like Kate Hodge. (This is a good thing. A very good thing.)

You're certainly not watching for the special effects, (amateur even by microbudget-indie standards), the acting (atrocious), the script (even worse), the direction (competent at best), the cinematography (ditto), the soundtrack (cheesy early eighties pop that should have faded into obscurity years ago), or, really, anything else. So it's gotta be the cheesecake. And that's all well and good, but you can do that on fast-forward. I strongly suggest that route. At least you'll waste less time on this. (half)",1156377600,3,1843,4.786163522012578
