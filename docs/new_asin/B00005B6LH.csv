7937044,1,B00005B6LH,This is one of the worse film I seen and I have seen a LOT.  Lot's of crying' lot's of whinning and the fight scene is about 5 min long but the rest of the movie is terrible.,1008806400,2,174,3.5789473684210527

7937046,1,B00005B6LH,"There must of been something lost in the translation from canton to the english subtitles.  This film made no sense and meant to keep it that way throughout the movie.  I still am not sure why the main character behaves the way he does.  They never reveal it.  Things occur in the movie that contradict the plot.  For example...a legendary warrior in the movie is killed by a small woman.  I'll leave it at that to not ruin the plot for those intent on buying this.  The only fight scene is a brief final battle which looks almost good.  There's a lot of senseless violence in this movie.  Even the psychotic will be asking ""why'd he do that?""  The title also is not fitting.  There IS NO flying swordsman in the movie.  Please, do not buy this movie, it is not worth your money.  Last my biggest gripe (although it's funny and I watch it again with friends because of it) is the soundtrack.  Whoever did the music knew nothing about fading in or fading out the musical score.  Music comes blaring in at dramatic points for no reason and is the wrong type of music.  It's entertaining nonetheless.  You'll laugh as a heart touching moment is ruined by punk music.",1001548800,3,1163,4.436018957345971
