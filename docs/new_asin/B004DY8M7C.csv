4335112,5,B004DY8M7C,"As stated in the title of the review, this is a great, comprehensive look into the multifaceted process of creating a fully fitted, finished Nihonto, or Japanese sword. There are many videos of both Japanese and Western smiths forging Japanese and Japanese-styled blades on YouTube, many of them very good, but this film doesn't rest on its laurels. It includes interviews and footage with all of the craftsmen involved in the task, from tsuka(handle) makers(both those who carve the core and wrap the handle), saya(scabbard) makers, habaki(blade collar) makers, toshigi(blade polishers), horimono(blade carvings) carvers, and of coarse, the smith themselves. They also conduct interviews with noted Kenjutsu(Japanese sword fighting) masters. The quality of the video is very crisp and clear, and most of the major questions are asked/answered. A great film for both the casually interested and ardent students of all things related to Japanese swords.",1351900800,4,952,5.527397260273973
4335113,5,B004DY8M7C,Good DVD giving history and manufacturing techniques of the Japanese Samurai swords.  I just went on a trip to Japan and this DVD gave me a better explanation of Samurai swords and showed how the steel is forged to produce the final sword.,1339891200,,239,4.558139534883721
4335114,4,B004DY8M7C,"If you like to study samurai swords, or if you are a practitioner of martial arts, you will love this DVD! It was done using many of the current smiths and artisans currently working in Japan and the quality of the film, the content, the interviews, and the video of them performing their craft, is truly amazing! One of the best I have seen on this subject and a must have for any nihonto library!",1327708800,,398,4.32
4335115,5,B004DY8M7C,"if you have any interest in Japanese culture or any sort of craft, this is the video for you. the dedication to even the most simplistic task is inspiring. these craftsmen set a standard to follow in their pursuit for perfection. An in depth look at the rare art, history and mythology of Japanese sword making. well worth watching! makes you want to run out and become a craftsman right away!",1327104000,3,393,4.549295774647887
4335116,5,B004DY8M7C,"I like and enjoy many things Japanese.  I was a missionary there as my last job.  Any free time I  had I went out looking for specific Japanese crafts/craftsmen(women). I found a couple of hands full.  Unfortunately, I never found a sword-maker or any of their lot.  I did find a knife and carving tool maker who was most interesting to watch and ask questions of.

Now comes this DVD.... horribly expensive for my poor wallet....but never-the-less... I'm very happy with it.

It is NOT a Japanese product...there you must watch the craft-person's face for 1/2 of the video.  Next, you get to see maybe 10 min. of actual hand/tool work....and the rest is preparing some food for everyone involved.)

So with that relief...I tell you that I got to see much of all that is involved in making all facets of the trade.
(Face and food viewing was minimal or non-existant.) The various parts of construction were great...but WAY to short for my likes.  I like and want to see excessive details in all of this.  Even making the hand grips was just kind of hinted at. Seeing and hearing a knife cut a piece of Magnolia wood is music to my ears....

I realize the blade is the ""soul"" of the warrior, etc.... but there are many parts to the thing and for the price I wished to see so much more.  The hand guard was not even mentioned....I only saw ONE in the whole DVD!

So, I gave the DVD a 5 rating...which it does deserve.  NO doubt.  In spite of not enough detail.... it is a superbly made and assembled flick.  Thank you who done it.!!",1320019200,19,1530,4.4071428571428575
4335117,4,B004DY8M7C,"I really enjoyed Art of the Japanese Sword.  Definitely the best of the western documentaries that I've seen on the subject.  It presents a very good overview, especially if you're a newcomer to the world of Japanese sword making.

As good as it is, I couldn't help but feel that,for the price, it should have been a little longer and more in depth.  I could listen to the sword makers talk about their art all day.  Like most attempts at covering this subject, the blade gets the bulk of the coverage here with the furniture, polishing, and saya getting short shrift at the end.  Again, I can understand this perspective but the documentary is under 90 minutes in length.  There was obviously room for more.",1308441600,13,708,4.616
4335118,5,B004DY8M7C,"The Art Of The Japanese Sword I found both informative and completely memorizing. And quite frankly blew the doors off of the documentary I have seen produced by National Geographic. I found the commentary from the artisans and guildsmen very detailed and informational that was explained in layman's terms that every artist can relate to. I also found these men extremely humble. A honorable trait by far.
For anyone that appreciates culture, history and tradition as well as a western society glimpse into an otherwise previously veiled world this is a MUST see!",1300665600,15,564,5.075268817204301
4335149,5,B004DY8M7C,"Wish it went into greater detail, but many artists work are highlighted and an appreciation of the complexity of this spirit of perfection can be appreciated more. Would watch more on the same topic if executed with the fastidiousness of this feature.",1428451200,,251,5.0
4335150,5,B004DY8M7C,Best non-Youtube documentary around.  Love the passion and dedication the master swordsmith puts into every detail of his work.,1416441600,,127,5.684210526315789

4335153,5,B004DY8M7C,"This DVD does an outstanding job of covering the basis processes involved in making a Japanese sword in one hour and 23 minutes.  Does the video cover every single aspect- no.  I do not believe one video or book could.  I've studying the art of Japanese sword making for several years, read many good books and spent time with a traditional Japanese sword smith in his shop.  The making of a Japanese sword is not a simple process, but take the collaboration of many master artisans.  One thing I liked particularly about this video was the interviews with each of the artists as they worked.  It takes years of hard work before any apprentice is permitted to work on their own.  I didn't realize that saya or scabbard maker requires an 11 year apprenticeship.  I recommend anyone seriously interested in wanting to understand what goes into making a Japanese sword to watch this video.  One item which didn't get much attention was the tsuba, but that is almost an art form in and of itself as is every process involved in making a traditional Japanese sword.  The only thing I can think of that is better than watching this DVD would be to  spending time with a traditional Japanese sword smith as they first make their steel and then transform into a work of art.  That is something I had the opportunity to do and I encourage others to do, but one can save a lot of time and money by simply watching this DVD as it contains things which I had not previously seen before in other videos or books.",1383350400,2,1499,4.490774907749078
4335154,4,B004DY8M7C,I found this to be an amazing and informative film. It gave me a terrific insight about the time and patience that went into making one sword. I would have given it five stars but I didn't care for the subtitles.,1379030400,,212,4.195121951219512

4335156,5,B004DY8M7C,This movie was very informative and great. I would recommend it to anyone that's interested in this topic. Has great instructional value to it.,1368835200,,143,5.0
4335157,5,B004DY8M7C,"Amazing view into the arts of the sword smith, and his life.
This movie, is not just about the making of Japanese swords, it's
about how the man (smith) breaths a life and soul into a non living object.
The time and devotion applied to each of the arts that go into the final product; is just mind blowing.
The spirit of the Samurai continues to live in modern day Japan, through a devout few who still
continue to practise Bushido. And the men who still offer the tools to practise it.
I would encourage all people interested in the classical arts of
Japan to watch this movie.",1368489600,,578,4.361111111111111
4335158,5,B004DY8M7C,"Really liked how this addressed the other areas involved in addition to the art of the sword.  There is a lot of time, effort, art and expertise involved in all of this and it was nice to see more than just the blade addressed here.",1368144000,,232,4.155555555555556
4335169,5,B004DY8M7C,"The quality of this video and its production is simply stellar.  I feel immersed in the program every time I watch it--and I had to watch it at least twice--once to take in the visual part, then again to read the subtitles (I don't speak Japanese).  Normally, I hate subtitled stuff, but here it just didn't bother me at all.  And the actual scene from the cover is REALLY awesome on an HD TV in a dark room!

At the end, I always feel like it should have gone longer, to better cover the other artists' role (especially polishing).  It is indeed an enjoyable study in the art and skills of Japanese swords.",1367625600,,607,4.336283185840708

4335171,5,B004DY8M7C,This film shows the few remaining men who are attempting to sustain the craftsmanship of the making of the Katana.  Absolutely fascinating.  This film is both entertaining and enlightening.,1366070400,,189,5.482758620689655

4335176,5,B004DY8M7C,"Very informative and inspiring.  Made me want a real sword instead of eBay knockoffs.  Maybe someday I will have the money to commission such a work of art.
The documentary first follows a couple blade makers, then shows a sheith maker, handle maker, polisher, and so on.  So much detail and so many months of work go into making one sword... And these days it will most likely be for arts' sake, and not to defend peace or be used to protect, however a properly made sword needs to have the quality that would befit a samurai going into battle.  So cool!",1355875200,,555,4.411764705882353
4335177,3,B004DY8M7C,"I would have appreciated it more if I were a metal worker. I'm not sure what I expected when I bought the video. If you're looking for detail on the manufacture of old Japanese swords, it's a bit superficial. If you have a casual interest in that process, it's okay.",1355875200,,266,4.34
4335178,4,B004DY8M7C,"I found the film to be overall very good. It goes through the process of how the Japanese blades/swords are manufactured from ore to final product with a sprinkle of the history and lore of these unique weapons. Lacking was the visual of the process of shaping an actual sword, they show how the iron is made and how the alloy used has welded but they show it with only 2-4 inch billets and you never see a full length sword manufactured which would have been interesting to see. Since there are probably many secrets to the process that the sword masters wish to maintain and therefore did not want to show how a full length sword is made in detail. Overall though a very good overview and worth renting to see once but probably not worth purchasing to add to your personal library.",1355529600,5,783,4.444444444444445
8426291,5,B004DY8M7C,"Excellent DVD by this movie maker as are all his very authentic and complete.
Shows virtually all the units that make up a sword and not just the blade as in most productions.
The Art of the sword is not in the technique but is in the making but all the various skilled hands required to bring the sword to perfection.
