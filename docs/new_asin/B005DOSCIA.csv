8467299,2,B005DOSCIA,"Bellezza del Somaro (2010) from Sergio Castellitto, is an
invaluable movie in demonstrating the wisdom, maturity and
life-long lessons acquired by people who have aged well, not unlike
a great wine ages well, as the years go. Of course, not all wines
age well, and not all wines are great young, or old. This film also
opens the doors to what goes on behind the scenes, in the lives of
psychotherapists who have been in the business for 10 years or
longer, as professionals.

First, the movie shows the lives of professionals working in the
field of psychotherapy, many who get the bucks rolling in with
incredible easy, from a business model  where the policyholders for
insured medical treatments, get it all for free, in a socialized
medicine environment that is Europe in general, and Italy in
particular.

Tens of thousands of Italians each year, receive unlimited
psychological support and unlimited treatments, from a tight knit
oligarchy of shrinks who make up that medical community, who can't
believe their luck, as the treatments don't hinge on the
hard-earned euros worked by the patients (who for the most part,
are unemployable) but rather, from money-for-nothing billions in
Euros in invoices paid by the state treasury, from taxes and State
borrowing.

This business model results in a massive accumulation of wealth by
those MD's, simply for discussing various Freudian theories with
patients and among themsleves,  and of course, by listening to the
verborrhea  of many patients. With this hedonistic lifestyle comes
all kinds of hangovers, ranging from alcohol to sex, to cultural,
etc. With this cash cow, the protagonists make  the patients
""family"" to keep raking in the dollars and euros, taking them along
on trips, and special events.

Next, the comfort zone of adulthood and maturity, is contrasted
with the insecurity, self-doubt, anguish and stresses of youth and
young adulthood. In fact, in this movie, the parents and children
come short of equaling the judgement and wisdom of the ripe ""guest""
who is given time and again the opportunity, to impart his
personality on everyone else in the household.

Finally, a fair bit of comedy, and nonsense is thrown in for good
measure, including a donkey, and light-taboos of all kinds, (not
raising many eyebrows at this point, in in the 21st century).

Overall, this movie may be compared to the contents of a candy
store, in that the director and writer has attempted to guarantee
that each and every of the 104 minutes are candy-coated, chocolate
moments.

This may please those with a sweet tooth for massive excesses. On
the other hand, for those spectators who are measured, moderate,
and conscious of excesses (and abuse), the film turns out to be
more depressing than exhilarating, more tedious and amusing, not
unlike watching or participating in a binge-eating contest. To
some, that is, it is offensive. For others, it's original.",1313884800,,2914,5.062630480167015
