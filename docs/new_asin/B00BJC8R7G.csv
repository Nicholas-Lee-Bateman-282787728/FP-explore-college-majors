8569535,3,B00BJC8R7G,"Cliff Robertson in two mid-60s British films in which he plays an American who fought for the British before the US entered WW2. Clearly cast to increase the dollar revenue for the British productions. Masquerade (one star at best) belongs to that dire set of movies which took the James Bond formula, reduced the plot credibility even further and attempted to increase the humour element. The same set includes: The Liquidator, Our Man in Marrakesh and Deadlier than the Male from the east side of the Atlantic and Our Man Flint and The Silencers from the west side. 633 Squadron (four stars) is a better than average WW2 movie. The plot is clearly derived from the actual Dambusters mission, and follows the standard formula in presenting the Allies and Norwegian resistance as both talented and valiant, On the upside, the film contains spectacular footage of De Havilland Mosquitos in combat, a great music score and beautiful footage of Norwegian fjords.",1517184000,,959,5.0
8569536,5,B00BJC8R7G,"I looked for the film Masquerade because of the sequences at the beach in Vilajoyossa and Benidorm more than 50 years ago.

This film, which I saw years ago on TV, was not available in Germany.

Agenten lassen bitten - mit Filmszenen in Vilajoyossa und Benidorm vor mehr als 50 Jahren, in denen man sieht, wie Strand und Umgebung vor mehr als 50 Jahren ausgesehen haben. Ich habe lngere Zeit versucht, wegen dieser alten Ansichten von Vilajoyossa und Benidorm an diesen Film zu kommen, den ich vor Jahren im deutschen Fernsehen gesehen hatte. Das ist mir dann nun endlich ber die englische Version geglckt. In Europa war der Film nirgendwo verfgbar.",1467158400,,649,4.837837837837838

8569540,4,B00BJC8R7G,"I bought this for the sake of Masquerade, which is from a novel by Victor Canning, a writer I admire. The film started with some very wordy scene setting, but then went into lively set pieces of action (including a desert kidnapping which must have cost a fortune to film). Plenty of tongue-in-cheek repartee and some literal cliff-hanging suspense.
The companion piece, 633 Squadron, was predictable and included a lot of violent death passed off with unrealistic sang-froid, but it was well made and while airborne quite engrossing and beautiful. The scenes on the ground were less effective.",1399852800,,594,5.071428571428571
8569541,5,B00BJC8R7G,"Probably the best of the non-James Bond spy films of the mid-60s. Cliff Robertson, Marisa Mell, and especially Jack Hawkins are delightful, and the cinematography of the Spanish coast (Alicante) is great.",1382572800,,204,5.40625
8569542,5,B00BJC8R7G,"633 SQUADRON is quite British and a very entertaining World War II action adventure film that focuses both on the RAF pilots and their primary mission to obliterate a German rocket fuel plant located in occupied Norway. Starring Cliff Robertson as Wing Commander Roy Grant he leads an excellent cast that includes Harry Andrews as Air Vice Marshal Davis, Michael Goodliffe as Squadron Leader Frank Adams and George Chakiris as Lt. Erik Bergman. It also features Maria Perschy. Directed by Walter Grauman, this film features brilliant color cinematography by veteran Edward Scaife (KHARTOUM, THE DIRTY DOZEN, DARK OF THE SUN), another outstanding WWII score composed by Ron Goodwin (WHERE EAGLES DARE) and impressive special effects Tom Howard (WHERE EAGLES DARE). Cliff Robertson is a skillful, steadfast and always interesting actor who once again turns in an introspective performance underplaying a role that still commands the focal point of the viewer. It was good to see George Chakiris in another role aside from WESTSIDE STORY but his screen time and overall part seem a bit lacking in 633 SQUADRON. There is a lot of daring do and typical heroics in this film, but the integration of actual air footage by editor Bert Bates really make this film noteworthy. The air scenes in the narrow Norwegian fjord of the squadron under incredible anti-aircraft fire from the Nazi guns is truly exciting. Most effective for me was Ron Goodwin's uplifting and energetic score and main title he composed used throughout. This little gem of a film has been around for some time and it remains endearing to those of us who grew up with it. I highly recommend it.

MASQUERADE directed by Basil Dearden (WOMAN OF STRAW, KHARTOUM, THE MIND BENDERS) stars Cliff Robertson and Jack Hawkins (LAWRENCE OF ARABIA). It features Charles Gray (DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER). It is a lightweight espionage thriller spawned from the 1960's James Bond craze. The American 1-sheet poster even claimed that it outfingered GOLDFINGER! It's not a bad film and Cliff Robertson is likable as the would be hero. The lush cinematography is by Otto Heller (PEEPING TOM, ALFIE, THE IPCRESS FILE). This is an entertaining film.",1378684800,4,2187,5.075
