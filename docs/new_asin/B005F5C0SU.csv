4672989,4,B005F5C0SU,"Despite the luke warm reviews Kurokami is a good series and this Bluray release provides a good 1080p transfer. No it doesn't have the Japanese audio track. However, anybody who has followed this series would know that the English and Japanese dubs for this series premiered on the very same day. Meaning that the English track is the original track, or at least no less legidimate than the Japanese track. My biggest complaint about this release was the print quality of the disc itself, the image on the disc looked Blurry like something you would expect from a bootleg, thats why I knocked off one star.",1277337600,,606,4.726415094339623
4672990,4,B005F5C0SU,"In the world of ""Kurokami"" (""Black God""), one sometimes think they see another person that looks exactly like them (doppelganger) but in reality, there are three (doppeliner) which share the same life force (known as Tera).  If by any chance, one was to see each other, one would die and the others would have that life force equally distributed.  Making sure this ""Coexistence Exquilibrium"" is kept in check are the Tera Guardians.

This is the basis of ""Kurokami"", a 23-episode anime TV series which is an adaptation of a Japanese manga series by Dall-Young Lim and illustrated by Sung-Woo Park and is an ongoing series published in the magazine ""Young Gangan"".

The anime series is directed by Tsuneo Kobayashi (""Glass no Kamen"", ""Midori Days"", ""Twelve Kingdoms"") and features series composition by Reiko Yoshida (""Aria"", ""D.Gray-Man"", ""Kaleido Star"", ""Peach Girl"").  Character designs are by Hiroyuki Nishimura (""Spirit of Wonder"", ""Deltora Quest"") and music composed by Tomohisa Ishikawa (""Appleseed: Ex Machina"", ""Kite Liberator"", ""Innocent Venus"").  And now the first volume of the anime series is released on Blu-ray and includes the first four episodes.

""Kurokami"" revolves around a teenager named Keita Ibuki.  When he was younger, his mother met someone that looked exactly like her and the next day she was hit by a car.  So, the existence of a doppelganger has always been in his mind.

One night when he went out for ramen, he meets a girl named Kuro along with her dog Punipuni, they seem quite hungry.  He offers her his ramen and all seems well until a madman comes out of nowhere and assaults her.

Keita tries to help her but is easily beaten by this madman.  But what he sees is this girl's incredible fighting power.  After all is done and Kuro overcomes her assailant, she tells him that she is out to kill her brother.

The paths of both Keita and Kuro cross again and Kuro explains to her about the doppeliner and that she is a Tera Guardian.  As Keita tries to deal with this and possibly learn why his mother died, his childhood friend Akane (who likes Keita) tries to help both Keita and Kuro as well.

One evening, a group of thugs with extreme power go after her again but this time, Keita tries to help but is mortally wounded.  Kuro manages to escape with him but because he is dying, she decides to exchange hearts with him in order to keep him alive and thus a contract is created.  But she warns him that they must be near each other at all times or her heart will become necrotic if its too far away from her.

Now the two must deal with their new lives together but at the same time knowing that they will be the hunted.

""Kurokami"" vol. 1 features the first four episodes of the TV series.  Here is a brief, spoiler-free synopsis of each episode:

  * EPISODE 1- Doppeliner System - Keita and Kuro meet each other for the first time.
  * EPISODE 2 - Pact - Keita is badly injured while trying to help Kuro and in order to save his life, the Terra Guardian Kuro makes a pact with him.
  * EPISODE 3 - Synchro - Tsubota-sensei tries to help Keita but it appears that Tsubota may be something much more than a teacher.
  * EPISODE 4 - Tracker - Tera Guardian Steiner and Excel start to follow Akane for some reason.

VIDEO:

""Kurokami"" is featured in 1080p High Definition.  I have to say that for a TV series, this is probably one of the most beautiful looking (and more recent) anime to show up on Blu-ray in the U.S.  Artistic backgrounds are highly detailed and for any Japanophile anime fan who is watching this series, can only be happy by seeing so many scenes around in Japan featuring this beautiful artistic backgrounds.  Character animation is also well done especially during the fighting sequences which are well-animated.

Overall, ""Kurokami"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray.  A lot of detail, I didn't notice any edge enhancement nor did I see any more compression artifacts.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Kurokami"" is featured in English Dolby TrueHD Audio 2.0 and is front channel driven.  The lossless audio is enjoyable to listen to but what is surprising is that it is not in 5.1.  Also, this is the first Bandai release where the Blu-ray does not include the lossless Japanese audio while the DVD does include both soundtracks.  It is said that because the series is being released at the same time in Japan, to prevent reverse importation, the lossless Japanese soundtrack was not granted for the U.S. release (note: In Japan, the Blu-ray release costs about three times as more than the U.S. release and to prevent reverse importation over there, they didn't include English subtitles).

Unfortunately with Japan and the U.S. on the same region for Blu-ray releases and people demanding simultaneous or near simultaneous releases, this is easily going to be an issue for American anime fans if more series continue to feature the lack of a Japanese audio track.

As for the English dub, for the most part the English dubbing was well-done.  Jason Griffith (as Keita) known for his work for the character Shadow for ""Sonic X"" does a very good job but anime voice acting veterans Laura Bailey (as Kuro) and Julie Ann Taylor (as Akane) do a solid job as the voice of their characters.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Kurokami"" contains the following special features in 1080p and 480p:

  * Textless Opening - Textless opening for ""Sympathizer"" by Minami Kuribayashi
  * Textless Ending - Textless ending theme for ""Irodori no Nai Sekai"" by Minami Kuribayashi
  * Bandai Entertainment Previews

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Kurokami"" has turned out to be a fantastic series thus far.  The anime is definitely for those who enjoy action, especially fighting-based anime series.  The concept of the ""doppeliner"" is pretty cool but with only four episodes, it will be interesting to see where this series is headed.  But for these first four episodes alone, I was definitely pleased by the series.

As for positives, the major positive aside from the story is this series looks fantastic on Blu-ray.  The detailed artistic backgrounds definitely look beautiful and the fighting sequences look absolutely fluid.  Please note that I haven't seen the DVD version to do any comparisons but with so many anime TV series upconverted for Blu-ray, it was great to see an anime TV series native to HD and look so beautiful.

On the negative side, I think that many anime fans who prefer the Japanese soundtrack let alone lossless Japanese audio soundtrack are reeling of the lack of inclusion of it.  As mentioned, with Japan and U.S. sharing the same region on Blu-ray and with people wanting simultaneous (or near-simultaneous) releases, this is going to be a major issue in the near future.

The other negative that I can think of for anime fans is episodes per volume.  With other anime companies releasing complete series or breaking down their releases by a dozen episodes, ""Kurokami"" which is a 23-episode series features only four episodes per volume.

Overall, ""Kurokami - The Animation"" is an entertaining anime series that so far features a solid storyline, beautiful animation and painted backgrounds and looks great on Blu-ray.  Although not a perfect release especially without the Japanese lossless, definitely a series worth considering for your anime on Blu-ray collection!",1268179200,5,7297,4.839256865912763
4672991,4,B005F5C0SU,"I pre-ordered this and am quite happy with it. Though while pre-ordering nowhere did it say it was volume1, hence I assumed it was an OVA of some sort. Volume 2, which is up for pre-order now actually states that its a vol. 2. I recommend waiting until a boxed set or a complete edition comes out as it'll be cheaper. There's many complete anime on blu0ray now that offer a better deal in terms of $$$.

Other than that little disappointment, the anime is great. I am not sure if I would purchase the second volume after watching only the first five episodes, however since I have seen the whole series before I highly recommend it. It picks up.

Overall a good buy :)",1268092800,,668,4.336
4672992,5,B005F5C0SU,"The other reviewer did state a fact that it is only volume one with four episodes, but honostly [...] for a Blu-Ray it's not that bad. I was mostly frustrated by the fact that it only has Dolby Digital 2 PCM surround sound, but that's a minor complaint since it still sounds really good.

Now as for the anime itself I really enjoyed this first volume and it was so good I pre-ordered volume 2. In the story of Kurokami everybody on the planet has three of themselves. It's to help split up our fate to so kind of like three different paths. This is known as the Doppleliner system and the way it works is there are two subs and one root. If one of the subs dies then the root gains the fate from the dead sub. As they explain in the anime imagine have 100 units of fate, well the root would have about 50% and the other two somewhere around 20% - 30%. Not always split the same I guess, but a good example. If a sub meets another sub, then both subs will die in some way either through an accident or from illness. If a sub meets the root only the sub will die. So if you run into yourself in the streets, be you should feel a little worried.

Now there are Terra Guardians who try to make sure that no one uses the system to their own ends. Since subs and roots hold a certain amount of fate, one can gain more fate by purposely killing off the two subs becoming a master root. This can throw the system off if there are too many master roots in a single area. Terra Guardians have a lot of fate in comparison to humans and have no Doppleliners.

So the main character of this story has a history with this system, but not the full knowledge of it when the series starts. It has caused him to not form friendships and to worry about even hanging out with people. He feels his fate effects the fate of others so he just doesn't want anyone else to get hurt. He also doesn't want anyone elses fate to effect him. However when he runs into a Terra Guardian his life is changed forever. Now they share the same fate and death is the only way to break the bond.

If you like animes with amazing hand to hand combat, this one is at the top of my list. I really enjoyed Cowboy Beebop, but even those fight scenes just can't seem to compare. The animation is about perfect for this anime and the voice acting seems to be on a higher standard from many others I have seen. Most definitly a great Blu-Ray purchase versus DVD. Like I stated above it was good I already pre-ordered volume 2. No real extras, but for the price it is for a Blu-Ray that's understandable. Really I think this is a great buy.",1267574400,2,2594,4.140873015873016
4672993,1,B005F5C0SU,"Take note friends, whenever you see ""vol 1"" in a title you should do some checking. This disc contains ONLY the first four (4) episodes of the series. There are 23 episodes total. Save your money and send the message that we will not be nickle & dimed. With other series releasing box sets of up to 30+ episodes, there is absolutely no excuse for this blatant rip-off.",1267488000,3,368,4.426470588235294

You can get volumes 1,2,3, and 6 for dirt cheap 4-7 dollars each, the frustration part is 4 and 5 for some reason cost 40-60 dollars so if you want the whole series be prepared to shell out some bucks for a couple volumes that aren't worth the price.

8469635,4,B005F5C0SU,Reading the synopsis on this anime - I was hooked. It's a very good anime - but the fact that the Male lead character is so annoying kills this volume. It's one of those anime's where it takes two people to use one power - but the lead character is reluctant to join in. So ... hopefully the other volumes will get rid of this and continue with the badassery that is Kurokami. Great new series - annoying Male Lead - rent.,1289174400,,422,4.158536585365853
