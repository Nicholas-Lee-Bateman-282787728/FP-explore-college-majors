2677699,5,B000JLTSHG,"We've all seen the 3 minute ""human interest"" segments on our local news station touting the healing benefits of human-animal interactions, whether it's pet visits to nursing homes and hospitals, kids reading to dogs to help their stuttering, or prisoners being profoundly affected by working with wild horses or dogs.  It's all good, but ""Green Chimneys"" goes FAR beyond the surface and shows the viewer the day-to-day struggles of residents, staff and their families as they work to heal very troubled young children utilizing animal assisted therapy on a 160 acre farm with 300+ abused/neglected farm animals and wildlife, psychotherapy, special education and millieu treatment.  The film makers shadowed the lives of 3 young boys at the world-renowned residential treatment center in Brewster, NY for nearly 2 years of filming.  Unprecidented personal access was granted by family members and the professionals at Green Chimneys -- ground breaking and not always easy to witness.  This is a very real, sometimes heartbreaking view into what it is to be a child caught up in the foster care/residental treatment system in New York State.  There are moments of great joy and laughter.....as well as dispair and disappointment.  It is real life as it happened.  They don't sugar coat it, nor do they exploit, in any way, what was witnessed by their cameras.  ""Green Chimneys"" is a beautiful film....a must see for anyone believing that there are good people out here doing good work to help children and animals to heal each other.  Dr. Samuel B. Ross, Jr., who founded Green Chimneys in 1947 (when he was only 19!!) still works and lives on campus... going strong in his 70's!

As a former employee and witness to the making of this extraordinary film, I can tell you that what James Miller and Constance Marks have created (along with the rest of their creative team) has become an industry-wide training tool for professionals in the field of juvenile rehabilitation, animal assisted therapy and activities, social work, residental care and a variety of other therapeutic modalities.  I strongly recommend this ground-breaking, sensitive, insightful film.",1167091200,7,2158,5.172413793103448
2677700,5,B000JLTSHG,"A powerful, moving and even redemptive documentary.  The interwoven stories about children at serious risk and the animals who help to heal them are sensitively and beautiully handled.  Not all the stories end happily, but by the film's end,  we come to care deeply about the children, and are profoundly invested in their ultimate fate. I cannot recommend this film highly enough and think it would be suitable it for a wide range of audiences.",1166400000,2,445,4.906666666666666
2677701,5,B000JLTSHG,"Moving and Compassionate. I am making sure my kids watch this to help understand the ""real world"" they don't know about.",1167868800,,120,4.761904761904762
2677702,5,B000JLTSHG,A masterful piece of documentary film making.  I hope there will be a follow up so I can find out how these kids are doing now.,1167782400,,127,3.8846153846153846
2677703,5,B000JLTSHG,"Green Chimneys is one of the most moving documentary films of all time.  Constance Marks weaves a truthful tale of life in the inner city and healing on the farm with dignity, grace and humor.  You get a sense of how healing can happen, how children can blossom when they receive care, attention and direction and how there are real life saints out there who do the hard work so society benefits as a whole.  Marks never shies away from the truth.  This movie is a celebration of life- and goes to the heart of what ails us as a culture.  This movie does not lament- it shows the path to a glorious future.  Watch it today- and see miracles happen.",1167782400,,648,4.31404958677686
2677704,5,B000JLTSHG,"A documentary that touches the heart, mind, and soul. Compelling and moving! A must see in a cynical world!",1167782400,,107,4.684210526315789
2677705,5,B000JLTSHG,"Green Chimneys is an insightful documentary that shows the complexity of the situation for forster care children,their families, and the system. Ultimately the documentary speaks to the triumph of the human spirit and the family. As a social worker in a drug treatment facility I show this film to my clients and then process it with them. It is always powerful and my clients relate to both the parents and the children stimulating memories and meaningful discussions. Important film that anyone in the social service field should see as well as anyone that cares about the children in the system.",1167696000,,598,4.99
2677706,5,B000JLTSHG,"Green Chimneys is that rare breed of filmmaking that is both captivating and enlightening.  With the flourishing of the ""documentary"" film, viewers should enjoy this movie which is a thoughtful and touching look at an amazing community where children learn about themeselves and others by caring for animals. It is a must see!",1167696000,,326,5.150943396226415
2677707,5,B000JLTSHG,"A film that should be shown in every graduate school of Social Work, as it is real!

A learning experience for those who think that ""bad kids"" are  one dimensional.",1167696000,,164,4.433333333333334
2677708,5,B000JLTSHG,"Green Chimneys is a richly woven, intricate story that, as it unfolds, pulls you into the lives of these troubled children so that you become emotionally connected to them.  It is astonishing to see the complexity of their relationships to their (also troubled and often abusive) parents and how the animals and support of the staff help them to heal.  I found it immensely enjoyable and highly recommend it!",1167609600,,408,4.898550724637682
2677709,5,B000JLTSHG,"Green Chimney's is the story of children who had lost hope - and how they found it. It shows how one person - the founder of a non-profit and each child and adult associated with it -- can interconnect and make the world better, stronger, safer and more welcoming. This documentary tells a story about one place and a small group of children - but it speaks a universal language to each of us as someone who can touch another person. Connie Marks and James Miller have made a touching movie that is worth watching again and again!",1167609600,,530,4.418367346938775
2677710,5,B000JLTSHG,This is a story about kids being rescued. About the worst that a family in poverty and drugs could inflict on a child and how a most ingenious school uses animals to turn them around. A beautiful film!,1167523200,,201,4.315789473684211
8152139,5,B000JLTSHG,Heartbreaking and Heartwarming at the same time. There is so much more to this wonderful place. Please make another one!,1465084800,,120,5.05
8152140,5,B000JLTSHG,"Amazing film with so much to enjoy and learn from..a clarion call of our failure as a society to help these young men at Green Chimneys, who are braver at facing their challenges than any adult. A reflection on the invaluable role pets and farm animals, with their unconditional love and vulnerability can teach these boys (and everyone) about commitment, love and nurturing.",1425081600,,375,4.968253968253968
8152141,1,B000JLTSHG,"This might be a moving story, but it's a fictional story, the school is a living hell!!!!!! The kids get beat so bad and Richard King has broken bones on too many children. My brother got beat up by Ross back in 1960 and from the research I've done recently it hasn't changed a bit. Hill is no longer there but King took his place!!!!! Very sad place!!!!!!!! Research people. Facebook - Green Chimmys survivors page and Google green chimneys abuse blog!!!!!! Sad for the children",1424476800,,479,4.5813953488372094
8152142,3,B000JLTSHG,"I purchased this for a class I teach at the University level.  While it was interesting, touching and informative regarding the program and the children, it revealed very little about the actual interactions between the kids and the animals.  The interaction was what I was looking for.  I wanted my students to get a strong sense not just of the program, but the actual daily interactions between the animals and kids.",1386115200,2,419,4.873239436619718
8152143,1,B000JLTSHG,"Green Chimneys is an RTC/abuse mill in Brewster NY. Dr. Samuel B. Ross Jr. made his living by promoting animals. This whole dvd is about lauding him and saying that animals cure every thing. Animals were more important than the kids who were sent to Green Chimneys. Animals were not abused. Kids were.  You can read about Eric Napoletano in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mama-s-Boy-The-True-Story-of-a-Serial-Killer-and-His-Mother/dp/0451407482/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mama's Boy: The True Story of a Serial Killer and His Mother</a>&nbsp;and you can also read a lot about Philip Zagarella and Eric Lau.  You can also read the May 30, 2001 of the Putnam County News & Recorder about how an 8-year-old boy was gang raped by 3 Green Chimneys boys.

I was there and was beaten and battered as were so many others. Staff freely abused kids. There were even public beatings.  Kids were forced to eat cigarettes if Ross thought they smoked.  I never once saw anybody being given reason to feel any animal there belonged to them. Since the place was a farm, kids had to do farm work. Horseback riding was more or less mandatory. Staff could do anything including bringing their pets, so there were always animals around. Green Chimneys survivors are coming forward. I am one of many Green Chimneys survivors. I can tell you that abuse does take place there and there are documented cases. Dr. Ross loves to tell parents/guardians of new arrivals that he'd throw the Pope out of his office if a kid had a problem. That is just PR. No kid who valued his or her life would ever go to Ross for protection - that would be like a mouse calling on a cat to help.  On the Survivors Page, somebody said going to Ross to help you is like Sharon Tate going to Charles Manson for help and that is a very accurate statement.",1331164800,5,1852,4.958064516129032
8152144,1,B000JLTSHG,"For everyone and anyone who is interested in this non-profit organization.  Please continue your research into this org. There is a facebook page ""Green Chimney Survivors"" as well as a Petition online to get Green Chimneys closed for good.  There are multiple accounts from children in the 70's up until the 2000's about massive abuse by Rich King and the founder Mr. Ross as well as many others. We all know after the scandals in the Catholic Church that coming forward after years of abuse is difficult, especially when it took place at an idyllic place like Green Chimneys.  If any of these accounts-if even ONE-is true-Green Chimneys needs to be held accountable.  Unfortunately, very horrible things can happen at places where very wonderful things can occur as well. But people need to start asking questions.

I too loved and love the ideas of this place, however after reading the accounts online, I cannot turn a blind eye.  Eric Lau, Philip Zagarella and Eric Napoletano are 3 dangerous men who raped and killed people and all came from Green Chimneys.

8152145,4,B000JLTSHG,"This is a superb movie chronicling a difficult year in the lives of some young boys at Green Chimneys - but it had very little to say about animal-assisted therapy.  I had expected a lot more about the Green Chimneys approach of pairing children with animals needing rehabilitation.

You see shots of the boys with animals, and watching animals foaling, but that's about it.  Likewise there is a minute or so of the founder of Green Chimneys, Dr. Samuel B. Ross, joking with one of the boys, but no other footage of him or anyone else talking about this.

The only exceptions are that one of the boys is given a rabbit to keep in his dorm, and that he can take with him to school.  When he gets the rabbit, which is slightly distressed, the councilor tells him to stroke the rabbit and explains that the rabbit will be able to sense that the boy is calm and that this will soothe the rabbit; he then goes on to say that it works the other way too, that when the boy is distressed he will be able to calm himself by stroking the rabbit.

And at the end, there is a scene where some of the children release a rehabilitated owl into the wild, symbolic of the forthcoming departure of one of the boys from Green Chimneys.",1227657600,,1217,4.315789473684211
8152146,5,B000JLTSHG,"from 1988 to 1993 i was a resident at green chimneys school.  having been there as a student i have to say that they are very caring individuals working there.  the campus is absoulutely beautiful and the staff members are absolutely fabulous and dedicated. the animal assisted therapy is very helpful.  if u can care for a horse you can care for a human being is the lesson i believe is supposed to be learned. more important it is about carring about yourself.  my creativity was nurtured there. (it was at GCS that i discovered my talent for writing poetry... even won the national peace garden essay contest there.) heck i even picked up the violin there. when i play now it sounds like a dying cat but...  as i ramble..
i doubt anyone from the time i was there is still around and in this picture but i gave it 5 stars because i know what it is about having been there first hand...  glen johnson, gerald weir, steve leezon, linda meile (prob not spelling the names right) and good old Dr. ross and haggus his lil terrier (i used to walk him for the doc) anyways... being ""in the trenches"" as it were it is nice to see a positive piece of my past memorialized on DVD. rest assured i will purchase this and cherish it for years to come. and i wanna personally say to any staff member that may be reading this and remembers me, chris martin, thanks for the life lessons you taught me and i am sorry for being such a terror. lol!",1181952000,4,1431,4.301115241635688
8152147,5,B000JLTSHG,"Constance Marks has created a beautiful documentary film that inspires each of us to be better people.  The foster children and families of Green Chimney's show us what human's are capable of, even under the most challenging of circumstances.",1168992000,,242,5.205128205128205
