8307936,3,B001H5O8RS,"A cable TV show conducts seances using a ""real"" medium Madam Camille (Alicia Petrides). She tolerates the fake effects and knows that her white lies allows people to get closure. After the first seance, a spirit is released as things happen around the studio. The next episode is a set up with a man they plan to expose as a murderer (Del Roy) and a radio preacher ( Ryan Ramos) who is there to expose them. They hope to jack their ratings and get picked up by a network.

39 minutes into the film, things start to happen on their own and a body count mounts.

The film was okay. The acting was about a C- with Ryan Ramos' character needing some help. The production adds some extra eye candy that didn't relate to the events, but I can't complain. Makes for an acceptable rental and is better than a lot of straight to DVD films.

8307937,3,B001H5O8RS,"The plot of DEATH'S DOOR, revolves around the cast and crew of a psychic-medium show called THE SEANCE HOUR, starring the mystical Madame Camille. Everyone involved -except for Camille- believes that it's all phony. It appears that Camille actually ""sees"" into the realm of the invisible. Lately, she's been receiving strange, dark visions that could portend doom for the foolish naysayers! When a mysterious, pompous preacher arrives for the evening's seance, the spirits really hit the fan! The show's special effects are replaced by real specters. Soon, the studio is besieged by deadly ""accidents"", spiritual possession, and other assorted spookiness. A battle between good and eeevil ensues. While this is a low-budget production that has its share of cheeeze, it makes the best of its limited funding. Contains a bit of nudity and gooshy gore. Worth a watch for the lover of the paranormal. Unfortunately, it loses points for the ending! It negates everything that happened! I rolled my eyes and groaned out loud! Ugh!...",1400889600,,1027,5.2303030303030305
