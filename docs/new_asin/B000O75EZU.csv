The docu drama effect with the actor re-enactments ARE GREAT especially in volume one when showing how we recruited former German scientists to help build our program from scratch at the same time the Russians were starting theirs. It comes across in stunning detail the factors that motivated the space race, namely to keep our national pride and achieve superiority over the Russians. Only after the Russians started to kick our butts did we start NASA and get busy. Too bad we are loosing our motivation that we once had.
Also I like to mention I recently purchased the book by Rod Pyle, ""Missions to the Moon"" and I found this book and Space Race compliment each other. As a space buff I find this really fun and cool as well. Space Race is worth owning!!! I give it 6 stars.",1265673600,,889,4.5625

Just don't bother buying it. It is crammed with stuff which has been seen in other venues as well.

The only interesting thing here indeed, is the cover picture. Ed White in his space walk...

One would expect to see it included, if not in its entirety, at least in a more representative way in this bundle of nonsensical cuts from mission to mission.

This is just a good product if you never witnessed those actual missions and know nothing about them.

For for those who were out there at that time and experienced it on Television, through Newspapers and Books, this bunch of over-edited and over-cut bits and pieces are just a very bad example on how to ruin the fascination in space exploration.

The material chosen and included shows its videotape origins and no attempt was made to improve on it, either in sound or in image quality.

There are much better products, and pricey ones at that, such as the Spacecraft Collection that prove themselves for their quality and in-depth look into such fantastic adventures in space.

The only good thing about this one, is its low price. But even if the price is right, more effort could and should have been made to improve at least those very brief interesting moments shown.

Not recommended at all...",1193356800,7,1285,4.650442477876106
