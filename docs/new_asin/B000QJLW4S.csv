8196650,3,B000QJLW4S,"This video will only be of interest to Stowkowski fans. It's black and white and contains one Stokowski's worst Beethoven 7th's. He is clearly in auto pilot mode and pretty bored with the performance. View only for a curiosity. No where near as good as his recording 1975 on Decca. The Romeo and Juliet however is excellent. Even though the videos are in black and white, the quality of this footage is excellent in the Tchaikovsky. Unlike the faded, scratchy look of the Beethoven. And the good news is that sound of the Tchaikovsky is in stereo and sounds very good. So if you love Stoki, get it for the Tchaikovsky. It's nice to see the grand master in action in nice sound.",1341360000,3,677,4.512195121951219
