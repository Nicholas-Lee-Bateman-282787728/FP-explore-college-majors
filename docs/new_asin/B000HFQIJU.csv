Because it's not easy to convert from Low Quality to High Quality, preserving the videos is the essential concept these days...

This is DVD is no exception. This DVD is a complete remake of the original 1994 video called ""Photo Fantasies"". The video is of a ""Back-Stage"" production ""Playboy-esque"" and photo shoot of the girls in the video. The video camera used is obviously a low quality camera based on the quality of the video itself. Seems like it was done on a $500 VHS cam-corder. You can clearly see how ""grainy"" the video is based on the year of the original copyright. Although on a plus side, the sound is not too bad, at least the background music sounds good. The video shows over 15 models, each model getting about 3-5 minutes of ""face"" time with a complete running time of about an hour. There is a scene selection and some bonus footage.

Overall it's not a bad video, considering the time/date it was originally made as well as conversion from VHS to DVD. Although the video shows a lot of nice looking girls, it's actually neat to see how they used to do photoshoots as well as how they set the stage for each model. Back then, they didn't use digital memory cards to store photo's, they used film strips that had to be used just right, or photo's would be ruined and couldn't be fixed. A nice collection of girls on one DVD. FOR ADULTS ONLY!!!",1403136000,2,1559,4.4475524475524475
