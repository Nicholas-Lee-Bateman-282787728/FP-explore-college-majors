5135120,4,B0086IMONE,"Well tailored Ladd adventure film.  No big name costars, no fancy production values, just Ladd doing what his fans wanted him to do - dominate the screen.  He does plenty of that in this one. It has the sharp, tough dialogue and physicality that was expected in his films.  Glad to see it coming out on DVD.  Now if the powers to be would just release his other late 40's - early 50's films.  Beyond Glory, Chicago Deadline, and especially The Great Gatsby deserve to be seen and enjoyed.",1340496000,18,488,4.438202247191011

Good storyline, nice clear picture, great Alan Ladd flick. Movie keeps you interested throughout.  Black & white shades are good.",1394496000,2,131,5.238095238095238
5135125,4,B0086IMONE,"This is a post World War Two drama about who betrays two soldiers that spy on German troup positions from an Itlalian island hideaway. The investigaion reveals a nest of traitors and smugglers. The film is well preserved. The ""Mona Lisa"" love theme made famous by Nat King Cole  was originally introduced in this movie. However, in this movie it was not a love theme, but was used as a warning song that a danger was present in the Italian village. This movie is worth a view.",1370390400,2,476,4.471264367816092
5135126,5,B0086IMONE,"This movie is a nice bit of suspense and mystery.  I saw this movie many years ago (don't ask how many) and is is even better than I remembered it to be. I loved the use of the song ""Mona Lisa"" as a warning device.",1364428800,,214,3.7555555555555555

5135128,3,B0086IMONE,"I love the movies of this time period.  I could picture this made today where the emphasis goes to the psycological rather than the dramatic plot.  It was fun to watch as are most movies made in this time period.  I was ten then.  While it is not ""Indiana Jones"" it was part of the genesis.",1349740800,,290,4.125

Best remembered, if at all, for introducing the song Mona Lisa, 1950's Captain Carey, U.S.A. aka After Midnight is a very decent little thriller that sees Alan Ladd's former O.S.S. agent returning to the small Italian village where he was betrayed, his lover (Wanda Hendrix) killed and 27 villagers massacred by the Germans to find out who was really responsible. It's not a popular return: the villagers blame him for bringing death to their town (so much so they gang up to stone him in the street) and there are more emotionally painful reunions in store before he uncovers the truth. It's not particularly challenging, although surprisingly the most obvious suspects turn out to be innocent, but it's at times surprisingly bitter, with Ladd much better than usual as the disenchanted hero who's been letting his wounds poison him for years.

Although you'll never believe for a moment that you're in Italy rather than Hollywood, it's a solidly produced old-school studio system picture with decent direction by Mitchell Leisen and a half-decent supporting cast including Joseph Calleia, one-time Dracula Francis Lederer, six-times Charlie Chan Roland Winters and a young Russ Tamblyn when he was still billed as Rusty Tamblyn. The use of the Oscar winning Mona Lisa - which doesn't even get a mention in the film's credits - is particularly interesting: rather than the familiar vocal version, we only get a brief rendition in Italian, not as a serenade but as a warning sign of oncoming danger, an idea that's neatly replayed in purely instrumental terms long after the Germans have left.

Sadly Olive Film's region-free US Blu-ray is a disappointment due to the poor master material Paramount provided them with: while it's not disastrous, the film's clearly had no restoration and has a lot of minor contrast issues and is one it's probably best to save a few bucks on by opting for the DVD instead since the higher definition just seems to draw attention to the flaws. No extras either.",1345507200,12,2042,4.9824046920821115
5135130,4,B0086IMONE,"I enjoy OLIVE label DVD. These are old movies and are mostly seen by old people, as me. So why don't put the english subtitles ?
It would help sales. Same problem with Assault on a Queen and Come blow your horn.

8525917,3,B0086IMONE,"I was wondering why I'd never heard of this motion picture; having seen it, now I know why.  I also know why the name Wanda Hendrix is unknown: she looks a bit like a Pekingese--except she has less acting ability.  There is a nostalgic appeal to many old movies, especially ones that capture the atmosphere of war-torn and post-war Europe, in this instance, the lake country of Northern Italy.  But aside from nostalgia, there's a reason Double Indemnity, Casablanca, or Brute Force are well-remembered, and there's a reason films like Captain Carey USA quickly recede into oblivion: the former were well-scripted, well-acted, and well-directed, and the latter isn't.  Bogart's acting skill is often vastly overestimated, but he was fortunate in having very strong supporting casts; Aland Ladd, like Bogart, was also not a great actor, unfortunately, he doesn't have much back up here, and the moon-eyed Hendrix is about as helpful to him as a lead life preserver.",1430524800,,964,5.082278481012659
