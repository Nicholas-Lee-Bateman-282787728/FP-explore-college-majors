8315394,5,B001KK9W26,"I have never forgotten the impact ""Clair de Femme"" (aka ""Womanlight"") had on me way back when I first saw it (in its initial release in art houses in the United States), and I've continually tried to find a way to see it again for years now.  Considering the wide availability of even the worst films these days (on DVD and streaming) it's amazing and sad to note I've yet to find it anywhere, and rarely see it even mentioned despite the fact it was very warmly received and reviewed when it was first released--and the added fact that Yves Montand and Romy Schneider are often cited as two of the best actors (and Costa-Gavras one of our best directors) of our time.  I hope to see it released on DVD/Blu-ray, or at least streaming, at some point in the future.  If you get the chance to see this film it will likely haunt you, too (in a good way), for the rest of your life.  Beautiful, mesmerizing, and beautifully-acted.  I don't often use the term ""exquisite,"" but it is the right term to use for this film.  I'll never forget it, and hope it is rediscovered by Criterion or other film-preservationists and released on DVD/Blu-ray/streaming soon.",1485043200,,1152,4.541062801932367
8315395,5,B001KK9W26,"""Womanlight"" (or ""Clair de Femme"") is possibly one of the best movies ever released, the others are ""The Ballad of Narayama"", ""City of God"" and ""Hiroshima mon amour"", in my humble opinion.
It is a pity that prices of ""Womanlight"" DVD's are unacceptable, as I would like to revive the lessons of a lifetime in my memory. If you have ever the chance to watch it somewhere, you will understand my words.",1323820800,3,400,4.569444444444445
