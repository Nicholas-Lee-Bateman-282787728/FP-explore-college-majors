7923030,5,B00004TQ18,I really enjoyed this workout video. It's a butt kicker. I need a new copy in DVD format.,1467676800,,89,4.0
7923031,5,B00004TQ18,"There is a demonstration of each move which is excellent. The warmup is invigorating. And the workout covers everything. The routine targets posture muscles, balance, flexibility - as well as abs, buns, and back.
  Advanced exercisers may find it slow, but beginners especially will love it. It is very safe and very thorough. I use it quite often.",1241136000,,348,4.982758620689655
7923032,5,B00004TQ18,"This is the ultimate beginner to intermediate Swiss ball traing video. First the videos goes into detail on form and Paul gives an excellent explenation of the general exercise as well as the advanced positions for proper Swiss Ball training. After that, you watch and follow along while Paul counts the reps. You know the video works from day 1. One of Pauls seminars cost hundreds of dollars and you can attain this video for less than 20 bucks, sounds like a deal to me.",1027987200,12,473,4.576470588235294
7923033,3,B00004TQ18,"If you are looking for a workout video with great music and exercise routines that will not only burn calories, strengthen, tone and keep you motivated enough to finish the workout and keep you coming back again and again, this is not the video for you. The instruction on how to do the exercises is very good I must admit, but its so BORING.  The guy talks too much, and the warmup goes forever.  I have only completed the workout twice as its too boring.  I class myself as quite fit, carrying a few extra pounds, slightly impatient, with no more than an hour to spare each day to work out, so I want a workout that does everything, and that is interesting.  This video alas will gather dust.",1002240000,24,694,4.3565891472868215
7923034,5,B00004TQ18,"This video is great.  Paul Chek uses the first 15 minutes of the video to cover all the exercises for abs, buns, and back.  Both the beginners level and advanced level are shown.  With each exercise he covers the Do's and  Don'ts.  He also covers what size ball you should use.  The second half of  the tape goes through a warm-up routine that is different than the  exercises and then regular workout routines.  I would recommend this tape  to anyone starting out with the Swiss Ball!",963187200,35,485,4.534883720930233
