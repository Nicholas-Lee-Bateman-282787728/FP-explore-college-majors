8620415,5,B00G3JCHUI,"I recently started doing Pilates- Just joined a gym and took some
classes there.

I was attracted to pilates after noticing the nice flat tummies all the
girls who took pilates had. Figured it could help me too.

If you're scared to try programs like T25 (like me) this is an awesome
alternative- no time wasted movements.

GET IN, GET OUT, GET TIGHT WITH THIS GREAT HOST!",1399507200,,372,4.522388059701493
8620416,5,B00G3JCHUI,"This is the second UNLEASHED BODY video I have purchased and I like both of them so much that I ordered the other 2 .I like how fast the workouts go. I got results sooner then I expected - and the dvd's were priced right for my budget.
What I found unique was the soundtrack were I could listen to Heidy's motivational cues.
In the past when I worked out at my health club, the class instructor kept our energy up  with encouraging words. I think that's why I haven't enjoyed or had success with other fitness dvd's I've done at home. Taking classes at a health club comes with the energy that the instructor gives you- same idea as with a personal trainer.
I've been combining 3-4 days of this pilates days with alternating days walking 1 1/2 miles, and I can say it's giving me the same level of fitness I was getting at my health club.
I was able to move from the modified level shown by Giselda to the more challenging routine that Ms. Tejeda does.
This is a very economical alternative to health club memberships. I'm also planning to buy my mother the entire series for mothers day this year.
TRY IT!!",1398729600,,1107,4.3478260869565215
8620417,5,B00G3JCHUI,"As someone who's worked out in clubs for many years, I learned the importance of doing Pilates the correct way. It's very easy for beginners to develop bad habits that can prevent results, or even result in injuries. Ms Tejeda's amazing demonstrations of proper technique is superb. Watching her and her partner, you'll soon be a Pilates convert, with the assurance your form is correct.

I'd suggest beginning with the instructional soundtrack before switching over the Heidy's motivational track option, unless you've been practicing Pilates for a while",1397174400,2,555,5.306818181818182
