4492250,3,B004X63SMY,"Another United Artists ""B"" Western of the 50's released on the ""To Order"" from MGM. It's good quality, clear B/W with good sound. Sadly it's by no means the best of this prolific period. Too many studio sets, a creaky plot, and not very inspired acting. However, if, like me, you are a fan of these obscurities you will probably have to get it, and will most likely enjoy it, as I did, most of the time. The good bits are Buster and Neville, with a well known Western support cast-Roy Barcroft,Walter Sande,James Seay, and unbilled Harry Lauter, Lane Bradford and William Tannen. The absolutely gorgeous Lita Milan is the most attractive ""Squaw"" I can remember, but, for me, Anne Robinson doesn't hit the spot, tho she tries hard. It's quite long (79') for this type of film, and in it's favour I wasn't bored. I just would have liked a bit more action. I also, once again, feel the need to grumble about the cost...Together with postage to the U/K it came to just under 30$!! and it's B/W 4.3 Ratio. But, I hear you say, ""Nobody twisted your arm"".! Add it to your collection. Chances are you won't regret it, but, from me, - Only 3 stars (5 for quality)",1349654400,,1154,4.44811320754717
4492251,4,B004X63SMY,"Buster Crabbe has just finished six years in the Army in 1879 in this 1956 black and white western. His plan is accept his brother's offer and join him as a partner in a cattle ranch with a herd of 2,000. He had broken with his brother six years ago when his brother turned to crime. He now hopes that his brother is reformed because there is a close knit relationship between the two of them. Unfortunately, he discovers that talk of the ranch is a lie; his brother is the leader of a gang of vicious robbers who kill people during robberies. He insists that he will not turn his brother in. There are two women in the film attracted to Crabbe, as well as one of the bandits who wants one of these women for himself, who are determined to draw the brothers apart, and the sheriff has set a reward of $5,000 for his brother's capture. While the plot is not unusual and the acting is not spectacular, the film is fun to watch.",1311120000,3,925,4.231638418079096
