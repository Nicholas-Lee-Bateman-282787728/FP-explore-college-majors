8280808,4,B000M5KA5I,"This reasonable priced collection of classic oaters starring iconic Western heroes John Wayne and Roy Rogers probably won't contain anything new for someone who already owns a lot of public domain DVDs; but it does offer a nice sampling of films for the fan just starting his or her collection - at a reasonable price, too, especially if you buy the set used.  There isn't a bad film in the bunch - even the selections from among the earliest B-westerns churned out by Wayne in the early 30s.  The twenty-five films are released on six disks, each one having a nice bonus feature.
