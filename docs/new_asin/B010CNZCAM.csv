7308894,5,B010CNZCAM,What can I say???  I'm a fan of anything done by Dwayne Johnson...so of course I really enjoyed this.  I can see why it's continuing into a new season.  Can't wait to see more.,1466035200,5,176,4.117647058823529

7308896,5,B010CNZCAM,This show is just like true life in the NFL. If you ever wondered what happens behind closed doors this is a show to watch comedy party all night long blow money like you never seen before and broke before your next contract.,1440460800,5,225,4.255813953488372
7308897,4,B010CNZCAM,"I just finished episode 8 and wanted to share with you my thoughts on the show so far. Don't worry, this is a SPOILER-FREE review.

Set in Miami, Ballers tells the story of fictional football stars retired and ongoing as they go through their life. The show uses a blend of humor and real life situations to show you the things that football players go through. They show you the highs and lows in their life and the price they have to pay in order to obtain fame.

Things I liked about the show:
+ The Rock singing Shake It Off
+ Even though it's only 30 minutes long, the show doesn't feel rushed and provides a lot of background content.
+ Whoever picks the music for this show needs a raise! All the songs were great and fits the scene perfectly.
+ Rob Corddry is hilarious in every scene and really brings the show together
+ This show divides aspects of a football player's life into separate characters. Each characters represent a problem in a real football player's life. For example; people smooching off you, contract deals, money problems, the price of fame, retirement, and past traumas.

Things I don't like about the show:
- Reggie. F Reggie. (Actually, now that I think about it, an actor making me hate his character that much is doing a great job)
- There is very little football in this show. It's more centered around the players themselves than actually playing the sport. So if you're going into this thinking that it's going to be like Friday Night Lights, then you will be very disappointed.
- Characters are unbelievably blind to the obvious. They keep making obvious mistakes that viewers know will end terribly, but they just keep doing it and it frustrates me.
- Only 30 minutes long, I wish it was longer.",1439510400,3,1734,4.551282051282051

7308899,5,B010CNZCAM,"I am not a fan of Football, or any over endorsed or over commercialized sport for that matter. So the fact that I find Ballers, a show about current and retired professional NFL players  so enjoyable speaks to the show itself, and the charm of the characters and the actors who play them. This show follows a format that HBO kind of set in place with Entourage, also produced by Mark Wahlberg, and that of their other great show Silicon Valley. That is to say these shows are a bit of a boys club, a bit of a fantasy that is grounded with a bit of reality. Sure, certain aspects of these characters lives seem glamorous and exciting, but you also get to see how having vast amounts of wealth and popularity can be hard to cope with. Or in the case of Dwayne The Rock Johnsons character Spencer, you see the potential physical toll that playing in the NFL can have on players body and damage potentially done to their brain.

Dwayne Johnson (WWE, The Rundown, Hercules) is just charming, I like the dude in basically everything he is in. He just seems like a very real and likeable person, which comes across in his lead role as Spencer Strasmore in Ballers. Working as a financial manager for new and upcoming NFL players, along with Rob Corddry (Community, Hot Tub Time Machine) Dwayne and Rob really bounce well off each other and there are some pretty good comedic moments between the two. I also like how the show balances time showing what its like to be newly signed to the NFL as in John David Washingtons role as Ricky Jerret, a passionate yet wreckless young footballer (played by an actual football player and son of Denzel Washington) juxtaposed with what life in retirement is like. Omar Benson Miller (8 Mile, Miracle at St. Anna) plays Charles Greane, a retired NFL player who is trying to figure out who he is without being on the gridiron, is he a good and happy husband, does he really like working at a car dealership?. Troy Garity, Arielle Kebbel, Jazmyn Simon, and Clifton Collins Jr. round out  a really interesting cast of characters that have funny lines, and add a bit of drama and tension and reality to the show.

This show is equal parts character drama and comedy. You don't have to know anything about football to enjoy this show. Will knowing things about football enhance your viewing experience, absolutely. As much as knowing about foreign politics will enhance your viewing experience of HBOs other great new show The Brink. Ballers is charming and fun and easy to watch at just a half hour per episode. Ballers comes FULLY APPROVED.",1439424000,5,2567,4.598253275109171

7308901,5,B010CNZCAM,"I have liked the Rock since he departed the WWE. I think his acting ability is very smooth, and he never seems nervous. I like his style and his attitude with most roles. I really like him in this series as he mixes comedy, serious, business, and not crap attitudes together to make one convincing character.",1491955200,3,308,4.517857142857143

7308911,5,B010CNZCAM,"Dwayne Johnson is great in this series just like he is in everything else. This series is a good example of what goes on in the world of professional sports, the NFL in particular because that's where it happens most. This series has everything. Sex, drugs and Rock N Roll, and everything else in between. This series even has comedy in it. Absolutely great and entertaining.",1475452800,,375,4.696969696969697

7308921,5,B010CNZCAM,"I have a feeling that this show is as close to reality as it could get.  Dwayne ""THE ROCK"" Johnson is Spencer Strasmore and Rob Coddroy is John, who are partners as financial consultants at ARMSTRONG MANAGEMENT CORPORATION and their job is to get athletes to go in with their company and invest their many millions.  The best part is the cast, which is focused on three, so far.  Ricky is married, but he has a separate love house and is quick to hit a strip club and punch somebody in the face.  Vernon has a best friend in Reggie, who happens to be his mouthpiece.  Every question asked of Vernon, Reggie answers.  Charles has retired from the game, but stirring of what he left behind is drawing him back to the game.  It has humor, drama, and most importantly, Rob, who is the true MVP of this show, cause this fool is HILARIOUS!!!  Can't wait to see what Season 2 has in store!",1469404800,,882,4.335365853658536
7308922,5,B010CNZCAM,The whole cast....... awesome!!!!!!!!!,1469318400,,38,8.75
7308923,5,B010CNZCAM,"This is a must watch for any football fan or not a sports fan at all like myself! Dwayne is obviously good in this series, but he is out charmed in every scene with Ricky Jerret, who is none other than Denzel Washington's son, John! I actually didn't know this the first time I watched it through, but during my second viewing it became so obvious because you can clearly hear his father coming through in certain lines and mannerisms, even though his fresh energy, wit and charisma still forms his own style and swagger.

I have read this series really captures the realism of the players in the NFL, their lives, their expenditures and foolishness. It seemed pretty real life to me, but I'm glad it's backed up elsewhere as well. I enjoyed this ride all the way through and it's difficult not to binge watch it. Robb Corddry is refreshing with his crazy, comedic timing, especially when played against Dwayne's more serious persona in this series. He definitely helps make this series an all around success along with John and Dwayne and I hope to see them in a second season.

It should be no surprise to see Mark Wahlberg as executive producer since it feels like a familiar ride with the Entourage crew with some of the music choices, dialog, parties and whatnot. I'm glad to see a show like this again and look forward to the wild dalliances of Ricky Jerret in subsequent adventures.",1469059200,4,1389,4.596774193548387
7308924,2,B010CNZCAM,"I don't have HBO and I'm missing football (so much so that I'm even looking forward to pre-season), so I ordered Ballers, Season 1.  I watched about ten minutes of the series opener and gave up - I don't speak Ebonics, so could not understand most of it, but the big F word came through loud and clear and frequently - not my idea of entertainment.  It apparently is a popular show (except with Roger Goodell, and I after watching it, I  kind of understand his point of view in this particular case.",1468972800,,499,4.344086021505376

7308926,5,B010CNZCAM,Love it thank you,1468627200,,17,3.5
7308927,5,B010CNZCAM,"I am not an avid Football fan, but for some reason this show just clicks for me. Dwayne Johnson is a stand up guy in real life, and I feel like he put's a lot of himself into his character. I think anyone who has worked hard for a mediocre paycheck will agree the amount that professional footballers are paid is gross. I could care less about dubs on a Ferrari, but there is so much more to this show than that. I compare it Entourage. A group of guys with too much damn money and they need direction to keep their lives and their careers from falling apart. It's definitely worth the watch.",1468540800,,592,4.201754385964913
7308928,5,B010CNZCAM,"Love this series, might subscribe to HBO just to watch season 2. Duane Johnson wears some killer suits and sport coast.

Great series, Duane Johnson shows his acting skills, great casting, plots and situations.",1468368000,2,304,4.735849056603773
