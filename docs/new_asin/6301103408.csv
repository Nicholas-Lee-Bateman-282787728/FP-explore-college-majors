311982,4,6301103408,"So what do I do; I BUY THE MOVIE!!!  Luckily for me, this movie isn't nearly as bad as I had feared.  The prominent feeling surrounding this flick is deception. Heck, even the cover art is misleading; that picture never happens in the film. People who hate ""Bad Dreams"" wanted a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" monster/slasher.  I was open for anything since buying this was an after-thought.  When this finally ended, I was pleasantly surprised.  But before I deceive you into thinking this is cinematic brilliance, we should look deeper...

(I don't know if I can review this without spoiling it in some way, even though I will never say anything specific about anything that happens in the movie)

-AN AMALGAM OF SUB-GENRE
That's my favorite new word; ""amalgam"".  It happens to work well here.  You see, what you see is not exactly what you get, but what you get is worth seeing.  At one point in this film you might sneer at the attempt at a ""Freddy Krueger"" re-hash.  When the various modes of killing start, you might suspect a twist of `The Omen"" has been tossed in.  However, when it's all said and done, you were completely deceived and surprisingly, it all makes sense.

-DEATH BE NOT PROUD.
If that last bit sounds intriguing, don't get too excited.  I'm going to temper things a bit.  Yes, there are some unusual modes of death, but you don't really get to see them all and they aren't particularly creative.  Usually, the gore is saved for the aftermath.  There are some graphic gore moments but they're not what you'd expect or are accustom to.  Regardless, there is a lot of blood and some very uncomfortable violence that is disturbing even if it's not all that realistic.  And as long as we are in the gore mode, I should let you know there is no nudity at all.  You will probably be thankful for this since most of the characters wouldn't do it for you anyway.

-MOSTLY UNREMARKABLE.
The actors in this film are ok.  Nobody stands out.  They dutifully do their jobs without adverse or advantageous affect.  They simply move the plot along in convincing enough fashion.  The camera work is standard fare with no groundbreaking or note worthy shots.  It looks a lot like other movies made in the late 80s; very clean and unremarkable.  Visually, the story is told in a very straightforward way.  I didn't notice the music, which isn't a bad thing.  It mostly stays out of the way while still preserving an uneasy mood.  The story, however, was different and a complete surprise.  I wasn't sure it started that way, but that's where it ended up.

-HANG ON SLOOPY!!
And hang and hang and hang.  Perhaps the thing that bugged me most about ""Bad Dreams"" other than the really bad title was the ending.  Not necessarily how the story played out, but how the action played out.  We get some human stamina and endurance plausibility issues as well as shirking the laws of physics.  As it is done in this film, it has been done in dozens of other films.  I never liked when it happens, ever.  I can only forgive this to a certain level as a bad choice.  An endless number of other scenarios could have put plausibility in a better position without changing the plot at all.  Despite this, the ending is a stunner for those with an open mind and a huge disappointment for those with the wrong expectations.

-WHAT EXPECTATIONS MIGHT THOSE BE, EK?
Don't go into this film looking for a monster/slasher.  This is a psychological mystery in the most literal sense.  It has plenty of creepy moments but is not particularly scary.  The blood and gore is present and a bit overdone at times, but still amps up the fun a little bit since the pace is just a little slow.  Even though it's not a mile-a-minute horror film, ""Bad Dreams"" was always interesting for me.  My recommendations are very specific for this film.
-you're not looking for the typical 80s slasher.
-You don't mind a slightly slow pace and moderate character development.
-You don't expect any ground breaking visuals.
-You like to be surprised by the story.

Though not a great film, the story is unique for the time it was made and may surprise you even today.  A good rental for sure.

311983,5,6301103408,"Well anyone out there who loves a great old horror film need not look further than bad dreams. A well scripted horror film made by great production company and a great director in Andrew flemming.
This is a sleeper of a horror missed by many but a must have in any horror collection along side great horrors such as Near dark, Vamp, the Third Exorcist film, the burning and Rosemarys killer that many horror fans may have missed.
If you liked Elm st 3 you will love this title",1215907200,,476,4.359550561797753
311984,4,6301103408,"For a movie that doesn't have any 'major' stars in it, Bad Dreams is actually quite well acted & made. The storyline is a little more original than most 1980s horror movies; it involves a psychopathic cult leader (played by Richard Lynch) who ordered a suicide by fire. Only one woman - Cynthia (Jennifer Rubin) survives, and 13 years after the suicides she wakes up from a coma. Unfortunately, the ghost of Harris - the cult leader - begins to appear, and several of her fellow patients die terrible deaths. Cynthia must find a way to stop him before he strikes again...

Richard Lynch - known for playing villains - is especially good as the diabolical psychopath Harris, leader of Unity Fields and the monster behind the mass suicide. Jennifer Rubin as sole survivor Cynthia and Harris Yulin as a psychiatrist also turn in fine performances.

In addition to the trailer this DVD also has some interesting behind-the-scenes features. About time this one was released!",1192924800,,969,4.866666666666666
311985,3,6301103408,"I'm a horror buff from way, way back.  And every so often I feel the need to revisit some of the movies from my scare ladden youth, and the film Bad Dreams didn't disappoint.  Okay, because its the early eighties and my memory isn't what it was, I wasn't expecting much. But you know Bad Dreams stacks up pretty well against the over-the-top gore films of today. It has a plot, it has blood, it has your damsel in distress, and it has a very cute doctor.  So yeah, I'm gonna stick my neck out on this one and say see it, its aged well.

P.S.  My three stars is actually three and a half!",1169596800,,587,4.069565217391304
311986,4,6301103408,"I bought this movie after seeing the trailer on another Anchor Bay release, Cemetery Man.  I knew I would have to buy it, just because it looked like it was right up my alley.  After buying and watching it, I was very pleased.  However, I have a feeling that I saw this movie a billion years ago on HBO, but just don't remember it.

As for the movie itself, well I love 80's horror movies.  Which are different than horror movies, a horror movie is creepy, yet timeless and not dated.  Now Bad Dreams has all the wonderful aspects of an 80's horror flick: bloods, dummies, profanity, creepy music, dark elements, questionable editing and dubious acting.  The one keystone aspect missing is nudity, which is a staple in 80's horror.  But in the case of Bad Dreams, I will forgive.  Now is this movie the best movie in the world?  No.  Did the movie run a little too long?  Yes, 15 minutes could have been shaved off.  Is the acting top notch?  No, but it isn't horrible either.  In fact some scenes are pretty good.  The thing about the movie that I enjoyed so much was the smoke screens it put up.  It appears like it is going to be a Nightmare on Elm Street type of movie.  With Richard Lynch's character being another Freddy Kruger.  Now in some ways that is the case, but ultimately it isn't. The story line has a couple of twist, which is what gives this movie some character.  I also liked the fact there was some focus on Borderline Personality Disorder.  Having some experience with BPD, I thought it was interesting that a movie addressed it by its official name.  Even though there were some liberties taken with the Disorder.

I also loved Chainsaw (I believe that was his character's name) from Summer School.  His performance in Bad Dreams was great, in a B movie sort of way.  I also love how the lead female characters in horror movies are always attractive.  Jennifer Rubin fits the paradigm perfectly in this film.  I digress in saying I love 80's horror movies.  Dualism is the notion in describing these flicks, being both precarious and (unintentionally) hilarious.  Bad Dreams is a reminder, for better or worse, they don't make horror movies like they use to.  I personal lean towards the latter.

As for this movie being dated, I would have to say yes.  The main reason was Sweet Child O' Mine by Guns N' Roses was played during the end credits, which seemed totally out of place in this movie.  Also totally dating the movie eternally in the 1980's.",1168992000,,2472,4.520361990950226
311987,5,6301103408,"I suppose this movie would have to be classified as a horror/thriller. It has plenty of thrills and manages to keep one on the edge of his seat. Jennifer Rubin and Bruce Abbott have plenty of onscreen chemistry and both their characters' relationship can be quite touching at times, particularly at the end of the film. Richard Lynch is absolutely perfect as the David Koresh-like Harris, who leads his devout, yet very confused followers, to their flaming deaths. It's the seventies clashing with the eighties as Cynthia (Jennifer Rubin) wakes up from a thirteen year coma in a psychiatric facility she was brought to back in 1973. I won't tell you the rest, I wouldn't want to give the plot away. I'll tell you this, for an eighties flick, Bad Dreams is certainly original. I loved it and I'm sure many of you out there will enjoy this one as well. See it for yourselves, you won't be sorry.",1154995200,,893,4.622641509433962
311988,1,6301103408,"the tone,style,and paceing in this movie makes it look like an atemp to make an ""elm street"" type horror movie,but then they change gears in mid movie and take it down another path alltogether and throw the film out of wack.

  a very young girl in the 70's is at the mass suicide of a cult. hurt she awakes 13 years later in a hospital for people with mental problem. soon after she wakes up she starts to see the cult leader everywhere and the people at the hospital start to kill themselves,or are they? after 10 min. you will not care because the movies is so boring. stick to elm street and skip this turkey",1148342400,,612,4.258620689655173
312001,5,6301103408,"I remember seeing Bad Dreams the moment it hit cable. I have always been captivated by psychological thrillers. I guess that goes with the territory being a psychology major in college. Anyway, this excellent movie is yet another sad reminder of how awful movies have gotten since the 1980's, especially the horror genre.

I'm glad Anchor Bay got a hold of this one. As with all of Anchor Bay's releases, the transfer is excellent. The extras are nothing to write home about, but it was still nice for them to include them here. There are three very short featurettes that don't cover much of anything. The theatrical trailer could have been better, but hey, it's just a trailer.

The commentary by the director was very interesting and informative. Definitely worth a listen.

I was going to get this DVD the day it came out, but I could not find it ANYWHERE! None of the stores are carrying it. But of course the stores will carry ten thousand copies of some crappy Hollywood hit that was recently made. Whatever. So, as usual Amazon.com came to the rescue, and with a very decent price to boot. I am thrilled to now have this in my massive 80's DVD collection.

If you've never seen this, give it a go. If you have this on video? Toss the video and get the DVD.",1145836800,,1264,4.506550218340611
312002,4,6301103408,"Jennifer Rubin, Dean Cameron, and the rest of the cast had amazing chemistry that really came through in the final product.
This movie is, indeed, a cut above the rest as it doesn't explain everything to the letter as other movies do.  For me, that's what ruins the mystery and the chances of me watching it again.
What drew me the most to this movie was the soundtrack.  Nothing like hearing The Chambers Brothers ""Time Has Come Today"" (during the initial suicide scene and when Cynthia revisited the horror awake and alseep) as well as ""I Had Too Much to Dream Last Night"" by The Electric Prunes (played as the ambulance took Cynthia away from the scene at the very beginning of the movie).
This movie is definitely worth watching many times.",1073779200,,744,4.628787878787879
312003,5,6301103408,"I miss this movie.  If there was a film that should be moved up on the list to be transferred to DVD this film would be it.  It's not your typical horror film where there's nothing but mindless slice and dice behind motives of stupidity.  The main character deals with the psychological aspects of something horrible happening to her (which makes sense since it takes place in a mental ward).  But when the bodies start to fall, the ""culprit"" is not so obvious.  No Freddy Kruger or Michael Myers.  This movie also pulls you in through the supporting cast, all interesting and even funny.  I love this movie!  I give it five stars as a contender against other horror films and it rates right up there with the originals like NIGHTMARE AN ELM STREET and HALLOWEEN.  There's death.  There's drugs.  There's comedy, and hey, even a little romance.  Grab some popcorn and spend two hours with BAD DREAMS.  You won't be disappointed!",1070668800,,928,4.654320987654321
312004,4,6301103408,"I can't really find the words to describe this film, but I'll try. :) I like horror flicks as much as the next guy, but this film was a cut above. To be honest the only reason I saw it in the first place was because Dean Cameron was in it, and speaking of DC, his performance is amazing! The small smirk before saying ""Later"" just blew me away. The small details in voice variation and facial expressions..the man is the best. And let's not forget about Jennifer Rubin! Blood, Blood, and more blood, Peter Pans out the window, blood showers, and Ralph's self-stabbing fest makes this film one to watch on an empty stomach. Don't make the same mistake I did by going to ""The Bell"" before watching this. Great film! Richard Lynch is scary, Jennifer Rubin is amazing, and Dean Cameron shows us the meaning of the word 'range'. Great!",1017273600,,830,4.467105263157895
312005,4,6301103408,"The beautiful Jennifer Rubin is back in familiar territory a year on from being drugged to death by Freddy Krueger in 'A Nightmare on Elm St. 3: Dream Warriors'. This film is so very familiar to 'Nightmare 3' with it's hospital setting and Freddy-like Boogeyman. Also eagle-eyed viewers may recognise one doctor in this film who played a dream doctor in the original 'Nightmare On Elm St.
I personally enjoy 80's horrors like this even if they often seem chessy or uber-gruesome. 'Bad Dreams' is an under-rated gem of a horror film and the effects are NOT bad despite what Mr. Professional critic at the top of the page may say. Only you can really judge for yourself. If you're a fan of Freddy, or effects laden horror/suspense then give 'Bad Dreams' a try, it also has a twist at the end which means at least some thought went into this script.",1005436800,,846,4.572368421052632
312006,5,6301103408,"""Bad Dreams"" came out around the same time as Nightmare on Elm Street and is very much a product of the 80s and horror filmmaking style at that time. The film tell the story of the sole survivor of an interesting hippielike commune/cult led by a David Koreshish type leader.
Yet ""Bad Dreams"" is a cut above for many reasons. The first being that the film is filled with surrealistic arresting images-in particular, the house where the mass suicide took place is an intriguing looking building, tragically beautiful.
Secondly, ""Bad Dreams"" encompasses a fascinating character in the African American female mental patient who frequently says mysterious and pseudo religious things and seems to be the only one who knows whats going on.
Thirdly, the acting by all involved is really superior to what you find in most horror films. Rubin is especially good at emoting and I am mystified why I never heard of her before I rented this film.
Lastly, I think most viewers miss an interesting touch in the film, at one point, Cynthia is sitting in the grass turned around in the exact same pose as the painting by Andrew Wyeth ""Christina's World""! It was a really awesome touch that I think may go unappreciated by those not farmiliar with this painting.
In short, ""Bad Dreams"" is a must see, with a great twist ending also. A must for any horror fan or suspense lover.",980208000,,1361,4.722689075630252

I found the plot to be rather impressive and in addition to that, the film makes a statement!
The subject of cults and cult leaders brainwashing people has always been interesting to me. The leader of the cult portrayed in this film is very creepy in his words and in his actions!

7809652,5,6301103408,"I remember seeing this movie on tape in a friend's dorm room in college. I was riveted by the storyline and could not get enough of it. I even stayed to watch it after my buddy Emmanuel left for class.

There were fantastic performances all around in this great film and I could not get enough of it! Jennifer Rubin plays a young woman who survives a horrible trauma from 13 years previously. When she awakens from a coma she realizes things have changed. The slapshot seventies have been replaced by the materialistic eighties. Susan Ruttan (LA Law) says you need an ex-husband and a condo to appreciate the 1980s. Her supporting performance was fantastic as was Dean Cameron's (Ski School) portrayal of a psyched out kid.

This movie was more a psychological thriller than it was a horror yet it had elements of both which is what I like in a movie. I want to be challenged more in my mind than I want to be scared out of my wits. This is why Bad Dreams scores on all fronts. Bruce Abbott does well as the young psychiatrist who counsels his seven patients.

This movie was written, produced and directed well. I can think of no flaws in the movie. The attention to detail was flawless--like when after the blood sprays all over the hospital in later scenes you see workers scrubbing the blood from the floors and walls and ventilation shafts. That was realistic! They did not just assume that the blood was gone.

Jennifer Rubin's portrayal of Cynthia, a nave yet scared girl hit on all cylinders. I so wish that she had not given up acting. She was by far one of the best actresses of her generation. From A Woman Her Men and a Futon to ""Miami Vice,"" she could do it all and she shines bright in this psychological-horror movie. See the movie for her portrayal alone. She carries it and takes it to Four Stars.

Now here is why I give the DVD Five Stars. There are special outtakes on the DVD! I saw deleted scenes and a special making of Bad Dreams. These are things that I never dreamed (No Pun Intended) would be on this DVD! Since it was a smaller budget film I assumed it would be just the movie. Boy was I glad to be wrong on that one. Each extra segment gave me new insights into the movie. See for yourself. Unfortunately this DVD may be out of print. It's selling by itself for $49.95 on Amazon. But it's worth it in my opinion, even if you buy it cheaper used. By the way, I really liked the previews that were in the beginning of the film. This was a 20th Century Fox film gem.
