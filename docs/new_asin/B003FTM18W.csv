4119338,1,B003FTM18W,"I was originally going to give this movie the 5 stars. I saw this movie sometime ago and decided to rent it again because it is such a good movie. I am extremely disappointed in the alternate version of this movie. I am curious as to why they felt the need to change it. This was a fantastic movie and the previous culmination at the end made this movie the great movie it is. This ending is lacking. For those who haven't seen the original, *******SPOILER ALERT********

There was a fourth bomb and it explodes at the end of the movie. This alternate ending was lackluster and shameful. Its like changing the ending of The Departed. Amazon, my advice is for you to air the original. All you have to do is google, Unthinkable alternative and you will see the slew of people who want the original version of this movie. This movie was a good movie that is ruined by ambiguity of the alternate ending.",1513468800,,899,4.4156626506024095

4119376,2,B003FTM18W,"Let me start off by saying that Samuel L. Jackson is a powerful actor. I love the movies that he plays in. The movie is has good acting in it and you will be on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens. But here is the problem that I found with the movie. They brought religion into the movie. I may not quote this correctly, but he makes a statement about almost thinking there is a God. Although the producer may not believe in God do statements need to be made in the movie saying God does not exist? The second problem with the movie is the constant theme of Muslims sacrificing themselves and trying to kill everyone. The whole movie was about Samuel torturing the Muslim and the rest of investigation team wondering if he should have done it. Was a whole movie based on of this and then the movie just ends awkwardly. I believe all the characters played their parts well and the movie was good but I cannot believe production was wasted on this. I hate to compare movies. Each movie is supposed to be different and can have its own twist. A movie can be about anything but it just has to be good and it has to have some plot and resolution in it. When you have just a plot without some kind of redeeming factor that changes a character of makes a difference in the movie to me that makes a movie dull. ""Law Abiding Citizen"" was a great movie. I could see why that movie was made. But this movie had more talking and reasoning in it than it had action. You will not be bored while watching this movie. But by the end of the movie you will be left with a feeling of horror and disbelief. I just didn't believe this movie. The acting was believable but the overall message of the movie just seemed to be a soap opera. You are just left in suspense and that is how the movie ends: good acting without a message or real concrete plot. Just watch Law Abiding Citizen or even Paycheck. I know we have had some Muslims who have sacrificed their lives to do bad things to the country in real life. I get that but making a movie about it to me was unthinkable. This stuff has happened in real life and to re-live it in a movie was just too much for me. There are some Muslims in this country that would never hurt a fly. I think the movie may hipe fear among many Americans toward Muslims as a whole. That is not to say that every American will feel like that. But I just didn't feel good about the movie. That is only my opinion and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If you loved the movie that is nothing wrong with that. But this is just my own opinion about the movie.",1487808000,,2586,4.163672654690619

4119470,4,B003FTM18W,"The gist of many others' reviews is summed up with the following: ""this movie is meant to get people thinking how far they would be willing to go to potentially save lives. Also at stake: how useful is torture in getting the truth out of the tortured?"" That is what many people took from the movie. For myself, I just kept thinking, that this terrorist orchestrated the circumstances in which he finds himself. He has become extremely powerful. The leaders of the United States are desperate enough to do almost anything to stop him. In this movie, U.S. leaders find themselves in a struggle to allow our country to survive as we know it (i.e. without 3 major U.S. cities being wiped from the map, with all of the physical, and economic devastation that would mean for the rest of the country too). All the terrorist has to do, at any point in the movie, is begin earnestly giving information about the whereabouts of his nuclear weapons, and all his torture would stop. His wife would never be killed, and his children never put in harm's way. Yet he persists. He holds all the cards, has all the power, yet he persists. He chooses the torture, in my opinion. I feel exactly zero empathy for him, and exactly zero guilt at the prospect of U.S. government officials torturing him. I just don't care. He orchestrated these death threats of millions of our people, and the destruction of our entire economy, thus the destruction of our entire country as we know it. The whole movie, I'm struck by how I care nothing for what happens to this terrorist, or his family. He organized his own personal living hell, and forced us into it, in the role of his tormentors. The movie shows a profound moral justice carried out almost to perfection. Our failure comes when we refuse to harm two of this murderer's children to save our own. Not to save two of our own, in which case, we would do better to let him be the murderer, and take the moral high ground. No not to save two of our own, but to save millions of our own. In this case, the only moral high ground is to stop this carnage at any substantially lower cost.",1460937600,3,2110,4.4689119170984455

4119624,4,B003FTM18W,"Unthinkable, starring Samuel L Jackson (the black guy in every movie), Carrie-Ann Moss (Trinity from The Matrix Trilogy) and Michael Sheene (Lycan Lucian from the Underworld) is basically a thriller that is a study in just how far a civilized society should or could go in extracting critical time sensitive information in the case of impending catostrophic attacks via torture.  In other words, what techniques would be ""unthinkable"" in terms of brutality before someone says ""Stop"" or ""Don't do it [at all.]""

Sam Jackson plays the hardcore interrogator who will pretty much do anything including cutting off body parts, and Carrie-Anne Moss plays an FBI Agent who would rather play nice and talk the info out of the bad guy.  Kind of a good cop - bad cop scenario if you will.  Michael Sheene plays the bad guy who is ex-US soldier turned Muslim (due to a deployment to Pakistan)  and has planted a number of nuclear bombs in several US cities.

The movie is pretty much a ""bottle show"" as 90% of it takes place inside this interrogation center, with only a few short scenes out and about of authorities looking for the bombs.  But because it's a bottle show, the drama and tension it brings within this interrogation center with panning camera shots and plot devices makes this film different than anything I've ever seen.

Getting back to the main characters a bit here...well, Sam Jackson plays his almost type cast persona of the no BS,  get in your face and get the job done roll.  Carrie-Anne Moss on the other hand is a long way off from her martial arts expert persona from The Matrix.  She plays a straight up FBI agent who would rather play on the villain's personal weaknesses to break him rather than physical injury.  All the cliched anti-torture lines of dialogue are heard in this film, and I'm not sure they are valid given what we know now of the Bin Laden raid in 2011 (this film being a 2010 release), so take from it what you will.  Michael Sheene again a long way off from his Lycan roll in Underworld plays what is no more than a pathetic traitor who is using his manufactured anger to get revenge, but all the while saying that he was trying to restore America's values.  (BS...in my opinion, as it's Islam's intolerance towards anything not Muslim that has driven this conflict).

4119668,5,B003FTM18W,"This is a brilliant film that brings together an explicit scenario where the two options - do we save our soul and possibly let millions die - or do we go to any lengths to prevent the possibility of millions dying.

Personally, I think it is a no-brainer, as the US crossed that line many years ago, without millions being involved. But this movie is the figurative elephant in the living room which has now moved to our big television screen, in an immediacy that can only be called breathtaking.

Brilliant acting, perfect mundane setting, and individual humanity on trial where ""what we know now"" vies against ""what the future might bring"", and how do we reconcile that. A not so hidden message is that we can not only be brutalised by terrorism, but can also be brutalised by the perception of terrorism.

The regular version ending was pathetic, and I am glad I only watched that after I had seen the full extended version - which has one of the most perfect endings in the history of film.

Finally, after reading some more of the comments of other reviewers I have to point out something that the world has apparently forgotten. Either the victims of the Gestapo who were tortured into revealing their secrets were somehow less than today's
 terrorists (which I do not believe), or the Gestapo had some torture secret that the rest of the world has forgotten (which I also do not believe). Torture may not work on everyone, but it obviously does work on some. And if the stakes were as high as in the film,  then what would you do? See if it worked, or just chat to them and give them a cup of tea.

I was surprised that state terrorism did not somehow get into the script, but hopefully that film will be made one day.

As stated before, I don't like harsh movies.  I don't like seeing people hurt or worse.  Man's brutality weighs heavily upon my heart BUT is there a point at which you have to deviate from being ""moral"" or ""doing the right thing"" in order to survive.

ALL governments are brutal.

It's only a matter of time not if but when I can see this happening.  How far would you go to find the hidden nuclear bombs?  At what point does one stop being ""nice"" or ""civilized"" in order to survive?

4119841,4,B003FTM18W,"Unless like me, you are a die hard Samuel L. Jackson fan, this is a film that probably fell way under your radar. Unthinkable begs the question of just how far The United States government is willing to go when the tables are reversed. A former military intelligence officer has planted three nuclear devices in three U.S. cities. He sends a tape to the FBI, proving his claim, and is then quickly captured by the military. The FBI and military question the man, but as time starts winding down, the military calls in a man simply known has H (Jackson), to extract the information any way he can. While this direct-to-video released received almost no attention, Samuel L. Jackson is really amazing as this hardened man, torn between what he must do and what is right. Jackson is paired with Carrie-Ann Moss, who has the exact dilemma as H, but decides to take the opposing position. While she wasn't bad, it's very hard to picture Moss as an FBI agent, even as you're watching this film. Unthinkable is one of these films that presents itself as a question to the audience. When it comes right down to it, how different are we from our enemies? It also asked the question of whether or not torture works. Human rights organizations say no, Dick Cheney says yes, my advice, watch this film and decide for yourself. Samuel L. Jackson is terrific and there is a big twist in the end.

That's where I stand, I've seen this movie twice: once when it first came out and the other time was an hour ago and both it hit home but now I'm old enough to appreciate it.

What do you do in the kind of situation Jackson and company are in? That's the question we are faced with whilst watching this movie. And there really is no answer to that. However I think that, for right now, it's for the best as people who think alike will answer differently.

There really isn't anything else to mention as really everything done in this movie is excellent, well acted, well written, feels very real and hits you all home. You just have to decide if you want to risk being extremely disturbed by the actions taking place in the movie. This is easily one of the top five disturbing movies I've seen so you can tell it affects me. So read up on other reviews and decide if you want to go for it.

Jackson shows up as a private contractor who does not exist working for an agency that does not exist; the compound is under control of the Army and run by Criminal Investigation Division.
The terrorist is former Army EOD, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, of the highest level, and has mailed out photos of what could be three working thermonuclear bombs. He has converted to Islam and changed his name, and there is a deadline to be met for his demands, or the three bombs at widely dispersed locations around the country go off.

But is there really any bombs? Why have Iran and other foreign governments gotten involved? Are there foreign nationals involved or is this a one man crusade? Did his wife leave him, or did he send her away?
What no one seems able to do is this; ask yourself, who is the bad guy-one who tortures one man, or one who conceivably on the surface, might kill millions. Its a very simple answer, but easy to lose sight of, regardless of whether the bombs exist or not-the entire government is paralyzed. But if they do, forget the terrorist's unconstitutional treatment, there is no more Constitution. Were you in charge of the situation, what would you do-obey the laws, or do whatever....? I guarantee this; you won't look at life from the comfort of your recliner without a shadow lurking in your mind. Do you ask why there are 1500 enemy aliens here, and why we have an open southern border-if people [from all over the world] can walk or drive across illegally, they can carry sizable objects or quantities.

The portrayal of the subject matter is perhaps over the top, but comparable things have undoubtedly been done in times of war. (Google the recently deceased serial killer Night Stalker and read what may have influenced him when he was 12.  Granted, that was done by an individual, not an agency.)

I like movies that keep one guessing until the end, but this movie unfortunately keeps you guessing beyond the (none-)ending.

Jackson of course is good as always, but here its a pretty predictable acting job weve some to expect from him, but very respectable. Moss is fairly good as well. But other than that I found this film to be a horrid mess. In fact the entire affair is rediculous. Maybe, just maybe the subject matter in this movie really does happen in America. We already know some of the things the CIA did during the Vietnam war, so anything is possible I geuss. Another thing I found rediculous is comments made in the top review here by another member who seems to suggest the film didn't make it to a major theatrical release because of some distribution issue or what have you. But I firmly dissagree. I think this movie was screened by execs who could see it just wasn't worthy of anything more than a direct to video distribution. Much of what happens in this film will have you thinking things like Oh cmon, this is getting pretty hard to swallow. Also the movie suffers from what I consider a less than respectable budget and production values. Its really a rather typical B-film with a couple of A-list actors who made the mistake of signing on to do it. Most of this film simply doesnt work and its pretty unforgivable at moments. Its not a complete washout but its pathetic seeing jackson play a charater who is pretty much an evil person with no redeaming value.

  Of course, though, I'm biased.  And the twenty people (as of this writing) who gave ""Unthinkable"" a scathing one star review will likely think worse than that of me.
  But what can I say?  I'm a sucker for films that get inside my head and make me think.  Reflect.  Ponder.  Wonder.  And ""Unthinkable"" does all that for me and then some.
  This isn't just a good-or-bad thriller film... a ""24"" wannabe... someone's take on terrorism.  Nor is it -- as one reviewer I came across described it -- ""torture porn.""  This is a cinematic treatise on human nature.  Realpolitik, also.  And it works as that.  Brilliantly, exceptionally well.
  And what acting!  Samuel Jackson has played ""crazy"" before;  ""scary,"" too.  And I've always been a fan of his work.  Here, though?  Wow!  An incredible performance, I thought.  His best, by miles.
  Same for Michael Sheen.  I'm just in awe of what he did here.

4120069,5,B003FTM18W,"Unthinkable Worth your Time?
 You are taken to a school, now turned to a top-secret headquarter buzzing with anxious energy. its location classified, its jurisdiction questionable. You have no clue what's going on, until you're informed that there is a man claiming to have planted three nuclear bombs in three different cities across the U.S. You don't know when they'll go off, where they're located, or how many people could be killed. All you know is that it is your responsibility to get the information on the bombs before they detonate. Unthinkable deals with a real world problem surrounding torture. Saying torture is unethical is easy. But, allowing moral principles dictate whether millions live or die presents a complex problem (that has no ""right"" answer). The C.I.A taking prisoners over seas so they can torture them is a good example. This is the exact problem our characters are faced with.
  Unthinkable follows the plot of a former expert nuclear engineer Youssef (Michael Sheen), turned extremist terrorist. As Youssef willfully allows himself to be taken into custody, it's former Black Ops interrogator H (Samuel L. Jackson) & FBI Counter-Terrorist Special Agent Brody's (Carrie-Ann Moss) job to determine the location of the nukes, and when they'll detonate. As Brody witnesses H's tactics, she's bothered by the laws being broken & moral ""goodness"" surrounding Younger's treatment, versus the possibility of lives lost if the nukes go off. Unthinkable tackles a perplexing question: how far will you go to do the right thing? Do the ends justify the means? Since there is no clear answer, questionable-but necessary-action is up for discussion, and the group struggles to decide what can/can't be done, and where authority lies in decision-making.
The film is an American psychological suspense/thriller. In terms of suspense, Unthinkable does a great job at keeping the audience psychologically stimulated throughout most of the film. Unthinkable forces you to ponder the same question the characters are faced with. The uncertainty portrayed in the movie helps the film's realism, and doesn't allow the audience an easy way out. Since there are opposing views between H & Brody about what should be done, the film explores both sides of moral ethical perspectives. This in turn does not influence the audience to decide on one answer early on in the film. As you follow the story you may begin to sway towards what would seem the obvious choice, but the suspense immerses you in the roles of the characters, and you'll find yourself once again uncertain about what should be done. While Unthinkable does a good job at what it's intended to, the films purpose unfortunately does not appeal to the masses, who've become accustomed to visually enhanced action packed films like Avatar. Because of this, some might find the movie boring if they don't like movies that focus more on symbolism rather than explosions.
While not the most visually appealing or action packed film, the Unthinkable cast portrays their characters extremely well. Samuel L. Jackson does a good job at playing the hard-as-nails role needed for H's personality, and trust me, this is not an easy role to master. Is he tough, but he is the guy that is willing to get the job done, the guy that you hate to think exists, but glad he's on your side. Carry-Ann Moss, contrary to her role in the Matrix, also does a great job portraying her character. You can tell Brody is a collected, level headed, rational thinker under pressure; moreover, she's not willing to give up her humanity as easily as the others, and strongly voices her opinion & objection to H's methods. Here is a snippet from an argument between H & Brody shows their personalities, and sending chills down the audience's spine as the music braces you for the unthinkable,
""Youssef! Do you believe I can do this?"" (Saying he will kill Youssef's children) says H. ""H., he believes it, he believes it!"" Brody replies. ""Faith is not enough, he has to know it!"", ""He knows it!"" Brody screams. ""Knowing is not enough! He has to see it."" H coldly replies.
Unthinkable is directed by Gregor Jordan, and was released June 14th, 2010. The films budget was $15,000,000, and it made $5,483,534 in the box office. The film does a good job at tackling the complex question about morality, given its running time of only 97 minutes. While the numbers suggest my review may be biased, you should take into account that-as I said earlier-the film isn't action packed, and didn't need a massive budget. While the box office may be low, remember that the audience for films like this isn't as broad for those such as action or comedy. All in all, if you can watch a film and pay attention without the need of explosions and bullets flying everywhere, and you don't mind a movie that makes you think, Unthinkable may be worth the watch.",1354752000,2,4877,4.930656934306569

4120075,5,B003FTM18W,"I had several very sad things happen to me so far in this decade. Watching this film was one of them and yet some use can come of this movie ""if"" some of us take action. 90% of the film takes place in a military safehouse while we watch what Samuel L. Jackson does to torture a captured American terrorist, to get him to reveal where he hid the bombs. What is sickening as I actually wanted to vmit several times during the movie is that I realized that this is ""Americas free rights"" completely out of control. In the 70's when curse words and actions were actually taken into account as being of serious impact for the viewer, this film would have been deemed to violent to be released and never would anyone under 21 be sold or rented this movie. How times in America have changed. This leaves us all with many questions that is already negatively impacting this country horribly. Some of them are:

What effect will watching a man being tortured for over 90 minutes have on our children, normal children growing up today?

Even scarier, what imnpact would such a movie have on people who enjoy hurting and killing other people. What effect will such a movie have on THEM!!!?

Do you really think if you are normal you can watch what the US (and especially foreign ) military might actually be doing to suspected terrorists as we speak and not walk out of the theater or finish this movie with depression and a feeling of being sick? Did we all put 9/11 out of our mind so quickly thinking its not happening every day somewhere!?

If they showed some of the most gruesome kinds of torture right to the auience and we all know ""truth is stranger than fiction,"" what really happens to people, both Americans and other people all over the world who are pressed for information but are innocent and know nothing? I say it is in real life unimaginable and unthinkable.

Yet we must use this film to draw the line. See this picture if you must, but then see think what you can ""do"" about it. We are not as helpless as we think. Some truths do not belong in a persons brain. I gave this picture 5 stars not only because it is so shocking, but if enough of us do something, anything!..........from starting blogs, message boards writing their congressman, refusing to watch such violent films we will send a message to film makers and our govt that the ""free"" media needs to be reigned in. Why do you think 20 million people in America are now on anti-depressants and another 20 million on sleeping pills? Watch this movie right before you go to sleep if you want to wake up feeling despair and hopelessness. This is a 5 star movie because it is a wake up call. I do not judge the methods used here or the necessity of them, I just think there are some things people don't need in their psyche and souls to carry around with them forever. And believe me, you will never forget this movie all of your life. Is this the kind of movies we want to blindly walk into? Hollywood had pushed the envelope way to far 15 years ago when movies no longer got an X rating for almost every kind of sadism and sexual act. This is your wake up call people. Either don't see this movie and spare yourself deep depression or be prepared to at least do what I did, and write a critical review telling others you are fed up with these kinds of movies. If you don't think Hollywood writers, producers and filmmakers do not read the reviews right here, you are wrong! Step up to the plate and lets return America to the best place on earth to ""feel good"" as we were before news, media and Hollywood went berserk. If you look at all the greatest movies ever made, why were they all made over 15 years ago? Why did we all feel good after a good film and now we don't ever remember a movie as ""touching"" anymore? Are we so conditioned by Hollywood that we really need something 10 x more shocking and violent than ROCKY and THE GODFATHER to make us enjoy something?

4120077,5,B003FTM18W,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The more I think about it, the more I like it. It was a dark story, with torture and death, but there is more to it. It, as many other reviewers have said, makes you think. It asks the question of ""How far is too far?"" and ""Do the ends justify the means?"". The film is very good and I would suggest it for anyone who enjoys films with deeper meanings, such as No Country for Old Men and others. This is the end of my Spoiler-free review. For more in-depth reflections on the film that might ruin the story, read below.

The story begins with a man introducing himself as Steven Arthur Younger to a video camera. You soon find out that this man is, in fact, the terrorist that pushes the whole plot forward. He claims to have set 3 nuclear bombs in 3 different cities across the United States. Upon receiving this tape, the government goes into a frenzy, trying to find this man and his bombs.

You follow a woman named Helen Brody, a special agent for the FBI. She enters the story with her tracking potential terrorists. She finds out about Younger from the television news that is turned on in her office. She demands to know who authorized it and is told that it is classified, but that she will be briefed about it. The FBI steps up all of its terrorist tracking, and this is when Henry Harold Humphries enters the story. When FBI Agents arrive to question him, he calls a mysterious man, who then calls Agent Brody, ordering her to back off and saying that Humphries is ""extremely dangerous"" and should not be approached. Humphries, later known simply as ""H"", turns out to be a special ""interrogator"" (read torturer) for the government. He is called in to get the bombs' locations from Younger by any means necessary. Agent Brody attempts to help Mr. Younger, who she promises that she will rescue from the ""illegal"" behavior and detention. The deeper part of the film begins to kick in around here. When H first begins to torture him, everyone is up in arms. Up to this point, they have stuck to relatively calm means of interrogation, the worst of which is hosing him with cold water for extended periods of time. The first thing H does is chop off the tip of Younger's pinky finger on his right hand with a small ax.

When he does this, he is promptly pulled from the room by the soldiers near him and verbally reprimanded. He responds by saying that it is the only way that will work and that, since younger doesn't exist, it is legally allowed. When the highest in command available OKs the actions, most of the people back off. Brody, however, still fights for Younger. As the film progresses, the torturing gets worse and wors, but Agent Brody's reaction to it is lessened and lessened. At one point, after a bomb explodes at a shopping mall, killing 53 people, she, albeit briefly, takes a knife to him. After this, H becomes more and more sadistic with his torturing, insisting that it must be taken up several notches to get the information. When torturing him is not enough, he decides that they need to use his wife to try and get to him. Agent Brody begins to interrogate her, but is convinced that it should be done in front of Younger. Under the premise that nothing will happen to the wife, she allows H to take her into the torture room. When this method proves ineffective, they begin to escort her from the room. H, however, wants to torture her in front of him to break him down faster. When they refuse to let him, he quickly spins and slits her throat, killing her for the sole purpose of upsetting Younger.

The torturing continues afterwards, as the information is too important to waste their best interrogator to a murder trial. H begins to talk to Younger about winners and losers. As Humphries sees it, it is not ""H vs. Younger"", but ""Victory and Defeat"". The title of good, however, goes to the victor as they are the ones who write the history books. Specifically, he says ""there's only victory and defeat. The winner gets to take the moral high-ground, because they get to write the history books. The loser... just loses"". This introduces the viewer to the idea that nothing that there is no good, but only winners who wrote that they did the right thing. Another point to consider is the question of ""How far is too far?""... The estimates for casualties is in the millions, so is torturing one man acceptable? If that is, how about his wife? is torturing and/or killing the people he loves, who may or may not have anything to do with the plot, OK because it will save other people's lives?

To further that question, the story takes another, final, sick twist: Younger's children are brought into the equation. Once again under the premise of non-violence, they are put into the torture room while Younger is situated out side to watch. He screams, giving of a stream of expletives but also giving the FBI the locations of the bombs. they knew where one of the bombs is, so they know that he is giving out legitimate addresses. H, however, proposes a new idea: a 4th bomb. This completely unfounded guess brings the question of ""how far is too far"" to the front, as they must decide: torture 2 innocent, small, helpless children in front of their father just to cover their bases, or not and choose to let a 4th bomb detonate, potentially killing millions. In the end, the entire question is dropped on the shoulders of Agent Brody, who has the option of dragging the children in and strapping them down to do ""unthinkable"" things in the name of maybe saving an unknown number of people, or saving the 2 and instead putting the masses at risk. She chooses the latter, walking out with the 2 children in her arms to watch the sky/cityscape as the time counts down to noon (the time the bombs are going to detonate). The film, unfortunately, cuts out before we can know the ending. This was obviously done to underscore the question. by not giving a definite yes or no to whether she made the right decision, we are stuck pondering what we would have done in the same circumstances.

It is a very good movie, and even if you've read this before watching the movie, you still should watch it. It is well worth the couple of dollars to rent, and is a captivating film.",1334016000,3,6235,4.503533568904594

4120079,3,B003FTM18W,"[THIS REVIEW INCLUDES MINOR SPOILERS]

An FBI agent Helen Brody (Carrie-Anne Moss) is called in to interrogate a suspect terrorist named Yusuf (formerly Younger) (Michael Sheen), who claims in a videotaped statement that he placed nuclear bombs in three cities, and that they will detonate in four days. The direct-to-DVD suspense gets intense and interesting when ""H,"" an interrogation specialist hired by CIA, steps in, using the methods that Helen will not approve.

For the most part the story of ""Unthinkable"" (directed by Gregor Jordan, ""Buffalo Soldiers"") unfolds more like a stage drama than an action. Some may call it a psychological thriller, but the director seems more interested in morals and ethics than in logic, with violence and torture scenes that might shock some audiences. The film purports to be a thought-provoking thriller and I respect the decision, but perhaps a more plausible scenario would help.

The culprit is arrested and his statement is verified too quickly. The fast development of the story allows for more time for Jackson's and Moss's characters to debate over means and ends, but we are not sure whether any information gathered is really useful in saving the day (you know, time is ticking and he could lie again and again); or whether a scientist can create home-made nuclear devices in the first place.

""Unthinkable"" is noteworthy for the powerful performance from Samuel L. Jackson. You may not like his character, but his strong acting is something you will not forget.",1327276800,5,1515,5.1214574898785425

4120111,5,B003FTM18W,"This movie gets 4 1/2 stars.

  Ok, long story short: all of the people who gave this movie one star was because: A) They morally object to torture, which this movie shows in graphic detail, PS. you shouldn't watch al-jazeera TV, then, because they regularly show the beheadings of infidels all the time B) They are card carrying members of the ACLU and scream 'muslim xenophobia' every time they turn around - despite justifiable historical and statistical fact to the contrary (when was the last time you saw a bhuddist strap explosives to himself and intentionally blow up women and children?), or C) They are being overly critical of the movies 'realism', but these are the same people who loved Harry Potter and lame tween vampire movies like Twilight.

  The only accurate criticism that I saw was in regards to the (original) ending of the movie. I agree that it certainly should have been concluded better. The alternate ending is the one that should have been, but I think that with a little more time to construct a more compelling conclusion this movie would be exceptionally more impactful.",1322611200,3,1102,4.835106382978723

4120116,4,B003FTM18W,"""Unthinkable"" presents a difficutl situation; what morals and ethics are we willing to violate to find save millions of lives?

When a homegrown terrorist Steven Younger (Michael Sheen)who has converted to Islam the FBI brings in a Black Ops interrogator known as ""H""(Samuel L. Jackson)used by the CIA to help FBI Agent Brody(Carrie Anne-Moss)determine whether or not the three nuclear bombs that Younger claims to have planted in U.S. cities are real. ""H"" will stop at nothing to get the information that he has been charged to pull out of Younger and while Brody recognizes the importance of finding and deactivating the bombs she doesn't believe that torture will give them the truth much less the location of the bombs in time.

The movie which didn't receive a theatrical release (due to one of the production companies going under)is a psychological thriller that brings up a lot of important moral questions on the war on terror. The performances are stellar throughout with British born Sheen giving a brilliant, tortured (pardon the pun)performance as the zealot Younger. Equally as powerful are Jackson and Moss who often go toe-to-toe during their scenes. Written by actor/writer Peter Woodward (as an actor ""Crusade"", ""Babylon 5: A Call to Arms"" and as a writer ""Closing the Ring"" and ""The House of Angelo"")and directed by Gregor Jordan (""Ned Kelly"" and ""The Informers"") the film remains taunt even though most of the action happens at one location.

The Blu-ray looks extremely good with a sharp looking transfer. There's just enough grain evident to make remind us that this was shot on film. Colors are a bit muted but that compliments the sense of ""reality"" of the film.

The Blu-ray has an optional alternate version with a slightly different ending that was shot at the insistence of the production company because preview audiences felt dissatisfied about a question that was raised in the film by ""H"" (they shouldn't have--the original ending works much better and is much more logical if a bit less unsettling)as well a a commentary track by the director. Jordan gives us a lot of detail about how he and writer Woodward strived to stay as realistic as possible and not violate the premise of the film as well as his decisions for camera placement and various shots chosen for the film.

We also get trailers as well as Sony IQ interactive fucntionality and Blu-ray Live connectivity.

A powerful film that raises far more questions than providing answers (I don't think THAT'S the point of the film though--it's to raise these issues within the context of a thriller), ""Unthinkable"" features complex characters and thoughtful performances.

The terrorist would have never revealed his plans if this was a bit more thought out.  The suspect is found too easily. I don't believe for a minute he would reveal himself as the perpetrator.

If you like Samuel Jackson, you'll like this movie just for his scenery chewing moments. This would have been better as an HBO TV movie than a feature film.  It's more like a play. There is not a lot of changes of location. In many Holloywood feature films there's more spectacle and drama.

The unrealistic aspect of this movie is how easily the story unfolds.  The extended version is the better of the two.  The directors commentary offers much more insight into the creation of the film.

4120120,5,B003FTM18W,"Unthinkable has my vote for being one of the greatest terrorist-type suspense films ever made.  At first I didn't believe this was a possibility since the pace moved as such a slow rate and several moments of predictability dominated the storytelling, but the *several* amazing twists and turns had me absolutely pumped up for more and wondering just how things are going to wrap up by the conclusion.

Basically it's about a terrorist who's responsible for three nuclear bombs in three separate cities across America, and if he doesn't get what he wants, the bombs will of course explode.  You've heard this story a thousand times by now. Now here's the interesting aspect to the storyline- the terroist is ALREADY caught.  The entire storyline is about trying to get the guy to talk by threatening and torturing him relentlessly over and *over* again.  Samuel L. Jackson is just awesome in his characer by the way he refuses to give in to the terrorists demands and make his life a total nightmare.

I really don't want to spoil any more of the storyline than that, otherwise I'd spoil the entire movie for you (and trust me, with acting and storytelling this addictingly suspenseful, you certainly don't want that).  I suppose the end is a bit of a disappointment because... I was expecting more to say the least.  But besides that (and perhaps the fact the film is a bit on the short side overall) I was mightily impressed with the suspense factor.  Simply fantastic.",1307664000,,1471,4.782608695652174
4120141,3,B003FTM18W,"It's a bit perplexing.  This is a competent thriller with a top-drawer cast.  Why was it released direct-to-video?

The plot is very simple; a distillation of the ""good-cop, bad-cop"" scenario taken to its logical extreme.  Of course, like Yin and Yang, the Bad Cop (Samuel Jackson's chilling H) has a bit of good in him (weeping at one point when he knows he did a Bad Bad Thing), and Carrie-Anne Moss likewise has a bit of the bad in her when, at one point, she threatens to drive scalpel through the prisoner's heart.  It's all by-the-numbers, but well handled.  The dialogue is not so bad as some would suggest; neither is it going to win any awards.  Clarity is important in a suspense thriller, and while brilliant writing would have better disguised the exposition, neither is it so clumsy as to be distracting.  As opposing doppelgangers, the characters played by Jackson and Moss manage to be somewhat more realistic than the film required.  Critics who think it's in the same territory as Rambo and its sequels really need to get out more.  The acting and writing, while not exquisite, are still multiple notches above.

In case you missed it, the setup is a typical 24 situation: three nuclear bombs are set to go off in secret locations across the fruited plain.  The terrorist is in custody, but he's not talking.  So, ambivalent as the powers-that-be feel about such a thing, they call in a specialist in interrogation (i.e. torture) and uneasily turn a blind eye as he does what he must to save the American way of life.  Queue ominous music and portentous footage of unaware pedestrians in going about their daily lives in large American cities, blissfully unaware of just how close to the precipice they dance, of how forces they know nothing of are violating the very principles they hold dear in order to preserve their ignorance and fragile illusions of democracy.  O the irony!  O the conundrum!  O the contrivance!

There is nothing particularly special about the film, outside of the cast (though I must say Michael Sheen's turn as the terrorist, while quite good, is generally overrated, even by the negative critics), but it's a watchable flick and definitely worth your time, if you want to burn an hour and a half in an entertaining way.  Perhaps even a vaguely thought-provoking way.  On the plus side, it's always engaging and does not run long enough to overstay its welcome.  Writer Peter Woodward has enough skill to avoid the worst traps, and enough care to shoot for a modicum of integrity.  He's one to watch.  The cast brings credibility to keep it all at least plausible enough to go with it, and director Gregor Jordan keeps it all well orchestrated while never, perhaps rising to the level of directorial brilliance that really could have taken it to the next level.  What, for example, would Brian DePalma have been able to do with this material?  That's a film I would really like to see...

So again, I ask the question: since it's not, by any stretch a *bad* film, why was it relegated to the graveyard of direct video release?  The only reason I can come up with is that, while it keeps the tension cranked high enough, Unthinkable lacks the kind of chase scenes, high-concept set pieces, and eye-candy (like the actor running toward the camera while a fireball erupts behind him gag) that seem mandatory for a political thriller these days.  It doesn't even have that loud chucka-chucka music we've all come to expect.

I think that a movie such as this one fails in its mission if it does not provoke questions and thoughts when the film is over.  Some people would say that this movie leaves a negative taste in people's mouths due to its nature and its portrayal of the US government.  I happen to feel the exact opposite.  If you think that this movie makes the US look bad then you went into this movie thinking that the US government doesn't do things of this nature for the sake of the interest of national security.  I happen to feel that the government doesn't tell us everything and that we, the people, are on a need to know basis.  I don't think that is how our founding fathers intended it however, this is the case today.  In our countries beginnings, it was thought that the government works for the people and it a sense by protecting our sensibilities from the atrocities of war, it does.  Our country, America, is in a bit of a bind because most people expect things without repercussions. They, the people, want safety without action.  Not all Americans feel this way and nor do I believe that this is a wrong way of thinking.  It is just the way it is.

  This movie gives you the opportunity to ease your way into the thought process that things come at a price.  Freedom isn't free.  This movie is also about innocence, the Unthinkable or shattering of innocence. How far will we go to protect ourselves?

That is the message this movie wishes to convey.  Beneath all of the dirt and chaos of everything, we are ultimately human and are held to a higher moral standard.  We can't control anything but our own actions and if our actions as human beings result in the taking of innocent life, then we have stepped backwards as a race of humans. The killing of innocence, pure innocence is inexcusable and this is what this movie is about.  There is a line we can't cross and it is very distinct.

Okay, to be fair, I don't like 24 and other cheesy detective/FBI/intelligence ""thrillers"". I like the good ones, but I can't stand the sort of made-for-TV, fake, overly dramatized ones with extraordinarily cliche lines.  This movie is filled with good ol' cliche lines like:

- ""What IS this place?"" when walking into an unknown building.  You know the fake exclamation.

- ""But can I ask what this is reference to?""  <Deepest voice you can muster:> ""That's classified by DIA.""

- ""Who classified this?"" Answer: ""Military intelligence"" in a very important voice. Response: ""That's an oxymoron.""  Hasn't that been in like 20 movies?

- Not a line, but the 3 bombs all have huge LED screens that clearly display ""Hours, Minutes, Seconds"", and then the guy watching the video says in a highly fake annoying voice: ""Geee that's only 3 days from now!""  And the ""nuclear"" cannister with the Russian printed all over it, turned perfectly to the camera - like one of those coke can placements on movies.

- Then there's the ridiculous scene with the washed-up looking 2 star general who says, ""He was one of us... <dramatic pause in a deep voice and a long-drawn face>... Delta Force.""  lol how cliche can you be?  How come Rambo wasn't in this movie?

4120150,1,B003FTM18W,"Do you honestly ""think"" that the producers and scriptwriters of this film were concerned with your ""thoughts""? Well, pardon my cynicism, but I don't think so. If they'd had any intention of provoking thoughts about the moral limits of torture, or about the ethical balance between protecting the Many while respecting the Few, don't you suppose they would have presented a subtler, more plausible scenario? This film was made to exploit a market, people! the proven market of Jack Bauer fans! ... (Poor Samuel Jackson gets to lend new meaning to Black Jack! But he's just an actor, paid by the role, with an extraordinary Screen Actor's Guild union-negotiated pension in his future) ... the market of fear and hate. Did it matter to the makers of this film that it might contribute to America's swelling anti-Muslim xenophobia? I""ll give them the benefit of the doubt and suppose that they didn't think they were hate-mongering. If they did think, if they intended to incite paranoia, then they are in effect social criminals and traitors to the civil rights of all Americas. Also, did it matter to the studio moguls that their film comps to the inflamed rhetoric of the extreme right, by depicting the incompetence and dysfunctionality of the federal government? Oh my, our feeble hopes for security all depend on one Super Rogue, a Jack Bauer, or an Ollie North, or the likes of H, the character played by Jackson! Hey, gimme a break! Whatever happened to the mythical Liberal Establishment in Hollywood? This film is a Tea Party recruiting scam!

Don't imagine for a moment that I'm enamoured of the FBI or CIA! The tale of their misdeeds and their blunders would fill not just one book or film, but a whole library. But this film is all knee-jerk exaggeration and unlaughable comedy of errors. At least the Keystone Cops were funny in their consternation. This is also a rather trite scripting of the old Good Cop, Bad Cop scenario, with Carrie-Anne Moss playing the tight-lipped conscientious FBI agent Helen Brody. I can imagine the scriptwriter Peter Woodward yukking to himself at how many stale formulae he could write into one movie!

Is there any element of truth or realism in this film? Only if you 'think' so ... But torture is real. As H declares, torture has been part of human behavior since the beginning thereof. I've read plenty of documented reports of torture as sadistic and hideous as anything H applies to the American bomb-terrorist in the film. The Christian Churches of Europe -- Catholic and Calvinist -- were highly sophisticated at torture until quite recently. The Mexican drug cartels of today seem to have a knack for gristly mayhem. The administrations of various Presidents, from Truman to George W Bush have been plausibly suspected of condoning torture. I wish I were 100% certain that the Obama administration has renounced all forms of torture ...

Does torture ""work""? Oh, if your purpose is to justify burnings at the stake or to find the keys to the candy cabinet, it probably works fine. The evidence is inconclusive, chiefly dubious, about torture as a means of interrogation when dependable information is the objective. This film, you should be very careful to realize, depicts a nothing-barred torture interrogation that FAILS. Ka-boom! If you choose to imagine that one more act of ruthless cruelty would have saved the day, i.e. that if H had been allowed to torture the children of the terrorist in front of his eyes and that a whole American city was nuked simply because the bleeding heart consciences of a few weaklings interfered with H's objectivist realism, then you surely are part of the market for such callous sensationalism.

But here's my question: Is it totally ""unthinkable"" that humanity might some day unite in regarding torture as ""unthinkable""? If so, I've enlisted in the wrong species and I want a transfer.",1299715200,7,3878,4.916030534351145
4120161,2,B003FTM18W,"NOTE: Initially, this review reflected a positive rating. After many comments here and on other reviews and the intelligent reviews written by Helmut, ginmar, Giordano, I am now declaring I was wrong in assessing the movie so positively. However, I am leaving this review intact to remind myself to think first and write later, not to be so naive in accepting a director's premise but consider all components of the film, then evaluate.

""Unthinkable."" That's the title of Samuel L. Jackson's latest film, a title filled with questions and debate. ""Unthinkable"" is a film about the unthinkable.

The story opens with two important pieces of information: (1) A manhunt has been instigated against one Arthur Younger (Michael Sheen) and (2) ""Henry Humphrey"" or H (S. Jackson) is picked up for questioning amid frantic efforts to keep him off-limits. The viewer is as baffled as Agent Brody (Carrie-Ann Moss) and her staff whose job it is to seek out potential terrorists.

Then they all come together for the unthinkable. However, as the story is presented, the viewer must consider the multiple meanings of this stark, ominous word ""unthinkable.""

1. Let's start with the obvious: Torture as a weapon. As H says, ""Since the beginning of mankind torture has been used in war."" Torture to extract information, torture to weaken defenses, torture to break a man (or woman), torture, a gruesome, unimaginable, unthinkable thing one man does to another in the name of war and captivity and information. Speak and you won't be tortured--or not.

2. Torture as a tool of government, suppressed, heavily classified to the point of ""this room does not exist, H does not exist"" because the United States is a democratic government and does not sanction torture. Or does it? Unthinkable.

3. Torture as an occupation. Does it take a psychologically unhealthy, downright evil or maliciously formed person to inflict torture on another as a job? This film says no, that torture can be reasonably employed by a rational man who understands its needs and necessities. Is this unthinkable?

4. Can the ethically strong person succumb to the ""necessity"" of torture? On several occasions, H tests Agent Brody, a moral, upright person dedicated to the law and to ethical behavior. Is it unthinkable that she might yield to torture's ""necessity?""

5. Is it unthinkable that a man who claims to love his Allah and his country--the U.S.--would plant three nuclear bombs destined to destroy millions and millions of people? Is his claim to right and justice unthinkable? Is his point of proving the military's use of torture to obtain locations of nuclear bombs unthinkable or just?

6. Is it unthinkable that a woman also can murder as calmly and viciously as a man?

7. Can women and children be used as torture's tools? Is this meaning of the title--unthinkable?

Conclusion: No matter how the viewer comes to this highly controversial, difficult film, s/he will find a fair presentation of the unthinkable subject of torture. No conclusion is reached by the director. Instead, he presents a balanced perspective of all sides. I feel a bit creepy using the words ""fair"" and ""balanced"" in the same paragraph with torture, but what unfolds in this particular film, although very disturbing, is informative, scary, and reflective of the nature of drama: to make us think. To think and discuss, to reach a consensus of opinion to act is not unthinkable. And perhaps that is the ultimate meaning of the film.",1298764800,2,3482,5.006920415224913
4120162,4,B003FTM18W,"Whining about the end not being ""happy"" is the opinion of fairy tail reading people with childlike minds that get disturbed by realistic things. Probably robbed of their ability to deal with the real world in their youth by religion inculcating parents; the result of said conditioning is an irrational desire if not outright need for FICTION to disorient them to the point of not being responsible for their actions.

This story is obviously an entertainment fiction in which a homegrown nuclear terrorist is well prepared for his inevitable torture sessions which are illustrated as WAY over the top. I don't know enough about the REAL situations to be critical of what happens during prisoner interrogation. I do believe that for every enemy combatant you torture, you inspire a thousand more to violence against you

I do not at all mean that as a partisan statement.  I say only that the film is a logical extension of what was then.  Other reviewers have dissected what they take to be directoral and other flaws in this movie.  To be sure, this film is not for the squeamish.  Let me just add that the most ""moral"" line in the whole thing is toward the end when the lead FBI character anguishly cries in preference to the proposed logical final unthinkable ""enhanced techniques"" step, ""...let the [eff]ing bomb go off!""",1297036800,,683,4.956140350877193
4120165,1,B003FTM18W,"Topical thrillers like Unthinkable are tough to do. Dealing with complicated, real world issues requires subtlety and intelligence, and the finest films that engage with thorny contemporary topics do so glancingly, whether through satire (Dr. Strangelove) or allegory (High Noon). Unfortunately, Unthinkable is as subtle as a nuclear weapon; it has all the intelligence of a rather slow-minded patch of moss.

Virtually nothing in this movie deserves any sort of praise, but the script is its biggest flaw by far. The direction, from the camera work to the set design, is merely functional; the man behind the camera understands how to point the lens at the actors standing on sets that look like a cubical farm, a high school gym, and an abandoned building. The main actors themselves do the best they can with what they've been given; Jackson throws himself into the role as usual, and would've looked pretty good if what was coming out of his mouth wasn't so dumb, while Moss might've been a bit miscast in this role. The only guy who comes out looking good is Michael Sheen, who plays a pretty decent terrorist.

But god, the writing. Full of cliches, silly plot holes, and dull two-dimensional characters, the script just fails in every single way. In the hands of a thoughtful writer, this plot could be salvaged; as a single-set play, with taut dialogue and a more ambiguous ending, it would've been brilliant. But instead, it chooses to stagger between Saw-style torture porn and philosophy 101, with the Tortured and Sympathetic FBI Agent vs. the Cold-Blooded Torturer, a few dozen Generic G-Men, and a Scary Muslim Terrorist Mastermind. And that's not even taking into account the lousy ending; the original ending feels like tacked-on and unearned ambiguity, while the ""extended"" ending has all of the depth one would expect from such a shallow movie, and I can't really decide which one I hate the most.

And that's the bottom line. It shows no artistry or intellect, but merely the greedy need to rip a story from the headlines and write a pulpy thriller to capitalize on consumer interest. The issue of torture is undoubtedly one of the biggest moral and ethical quandaries of our time, but Unthinkable is just overwrought, pretentious rubbish.",1296950400,6,2258,4.968253968253968
4120166,3,B003FTM18W,This movie was perfect until the last 5 minutes.  There were so many ways it could have went that would have made it a top notch movie.  The writer chose none of them and the movie seemed to end abruptly.,1296864000,3,204,4.075
4120167,2,B003FTM18W,"I recently retired from the US military due to injuries suffered in Iraq. I was an interrogator.

  Several US interrogators visited the set of ""24"" to beg the show to stop doing what it was doing, which was making a mockery of the reality of interrogation.  This movie is pretty much more of the same.

1. The ticking time bomb scenario. Terrorist organizations are not organized in any way that makes this possible. It does, however, justify any number of macho jerkwad fantasies about revenge, gettin' them Mooslims, being a macho guy, delivering a beating to them terrorists, etc., etc,

2. With the ticking time bomb scenario off the table, the rest of the movie becomes preposterous. Torture doesn't work. It will make the guy talk----Oh, yeah, he'll talk. But he'll say anything to get you to stop. And here's the thing that gets me: if the guy's innocent, you might have just CREATED a terrorist. I guarantee you his family or his tribe will not view it kindly. I hate it that these days one cannot simply argue that it's wrong, and have that be the end of it. Torture is wrong. Period. The end.

3. There is no mastermind terrorist with a cunning plan and unlimited amounts of material. Unlike in Iraq, where Rumsfeld's disbanding of the Iraqi Army left munitions dumps wide open for looting, the US features whatever safeguards we can on gun buying that the NRA hasn't managed to destroy.  Gun shows have proven to have about as much security, for example, as any Saturday parking lot flea market.

 You know what works? ""Hey, dude, want a cup of coffee?"" Gummy bears are also good. (You can get halal ones.)  You look them in the eye, ask them how they've been treated, and then you do what you say. It takes time, but it works, because here's the thing: people want to talk about what they've done. They want to brag to their opponents, and maybe it weighs on their soul. Lying is hard. Telling the truth is what people naturally do. When you sit across a desk from a terrorist or an insurgent or whatever you want to call it,  you're confronted with a human being, and Michael Sheen does an excellent job here of portraying this aspect of the reality. In fact, the only reason I didn't give it the one star it deserves is for the excellent cast. The plot, the ideas, are sheer suckitude. Interrogators have committed suicide when ordered to commit torture. Innocent people have been confined at Gitmo for years. The reality is, it takes time and it takes standards.  This movie tries to justify it by making Sheen's character a screwed up fanatic with a clever out, but this is the kind of thinking that serves to justify intrusions on American liberty like the ever-ratcheting up of TSA actions that provide no security whatsoever.  They're always chasing horses that have already left the barn.

 The performances are far better than this crap deserves.  Carrie Anne Moss plays the good cop (what, because she's a woman?), Samuel L. Jackson is the mysterious figure who travels around torturing people---like there aren't a ton of these people willing to do it after a few beers----and Michael Sheen plays the convert. Then of course, there's my favorite: the way the military members are portrayed: officious, non-thinking, apt to run into a situation without any tactical awareness, and finally, so stupid as to go, ""What's this?"" and then----Yeah. No.

The movie's message is muddled.  One the one hand, there's the fact that the scenario is standard Jack Bauer crap. On the other, there's the contempt for the military, which seems to spring from a different viewpoint. With the ending.....Yeah, that ending.  It's almost worse than they didn't go for the CFI effects. By that point, why not? It's not like the movie has ducked any other cliches.",1296864000,14,3765,4.72782874617737

He then allows 'the authorities' to catch him and announces that he will soon make some demands and that he will reveal the location of the bombs if his demands were met. Of course, ""we don't negotiate with terrorists"". Well, sometimes we do but if we catch them we torture them until they tell us what we need to know in order to save our countrymen from mass destruction. And when the torture work gets tough... there is this master torturer so well portrayed by Samuel Jackson who would stop at nothing because he's in this game to win it for our team no mater what it takes.

I am skeptical whenever 'contemporary topics and concerns' get movie treatments. In fact I am skeptical whenever anything having to do with events or ideas from the past few thousand years get a movie or a book treatment but I don't always avoid the book or the movie, just because the author or the maker has some agenda to promote. They always do. After reading the brief synopsis and before watching I expected to see some subtle, veiled variation on the 'us vs. them' theme where 'we' prevail in the end or at least prove ourselves the moral victors, spreaders of freedoms and faithful lovers of liberties. It wasn't that and it wasn't subtle.

'Unthinkable' is a frightening, clearly not subtle but a definitely courageous exploration of our some of the darker aspects of our humanity. For reasons that made the so-called 'tabloids' so successful in the second half of the 20th century, the fiction depicting the horrors of one man being savagely tortured by another is a lot more disturbing and a lot more conducive to 'thought' and thoughtful introspection than the discussion of real events such as the carpet bombing of Dresden or the mass horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki or the Soviet GULAG. And, well aware of what moves us, the makers of 'Unthinkable' are serving us a complete 'food for thought' dinner, the topic: ""how low can we go"" if we 'have to' when it comes to humanity or morality and is there anything we wouldn't do when the alternatives are between our or our team's survival, all 'principles' thrown overboard, or us losing with honor and dignity. I won't reveal the plot or the outcome because it's far from hard to predict. It's quite clear where the story is heading after the first few minutes but let me just say that the unthinkable can be quickly accepted and rationalized.

Except for a few plot twists, there are few surprises here but this movie should be a must watch because it gives us 90 minutes to think about important things such as the meaning and the worth of our 'humanity'. This is a rare movie because, while clearly preachy, blunt and manipulative, it's preaching on topics and from points of view we don't hear too often. It's food for thought prepared by master chefs but the food is unusual and the thoughts it's likely to provoke are not what we are usually encouraged to think. It's all extremely disturbing so, please, please, please, don't keep young children with you while watching but do watch and do think, at least for the 90 minutes the movie plays and maybe for a few minutes after the credits are done rolling.",1294272000,,3331,4.642372881355932

Also, I find torture really counterproductive. Given all historical precedent, it does not work, and just tarnishes those who use it. That having been said, if there was a terrorist who knew where a nuclear bomb was, and I had to choose between him being tortured for 20 minutes, hard, and 20 million people dying, I'd choose torture, and it would work, unlike in the movie.",1294185600,4,544,4.494949494949495
4120182,4,B003FTM18W,"Whether or not you like this movie due to the graphical use of torture to extract information from a terrorist will be whether you are on the side of ""The ends justifies the means"", or the sacrifice the few and save the many, or take a moral high ground and possibly lose everything at all cost, except your humanity.  Depending upon those two things will determine weather or not you like this movie or consider it an abomination.
  The movie poses to the viewer several issues that are pivotal as a reference to the time period that we live in, no doubt 50-60 years from now historians will use this movie as a reference and period piece to understand modes of thinking that were happening when this film was produced.  Issues of torture and self preservation, water boarding to put off the ticking time bomb scenario are just some to say the least.
  In other ways this could be used as an anti-American message to send to Muslims that Americans possibly do not care about them, and even further do not care about their own citizens that are Muslim, and go as far as to do away with their rights and even their very lives if need be, which could not be further from the truth, but it is a radical message that could be used by radical extremist.
  As far as the acting, i feel it was superb from all cast members, a really good action, and suspense movie that may turn you off with the torture aspect however, others will not like the ending.

4120183,1,B003FTM18W,"Not only is this movie unexpectedly grotesque and disgusting, its another shot in fomenting hatred between Muslims and non-Muslim Americans. What makes it worse, the Muslims seen in this film are American citizens which sends the direct message that it doesn't matter if you're American or not...if you're Muslim, you're America's enemy and we will suspend all laws, treaties and conventions.  If the ""villain"" in this plot were Catholic or Mormon, the film would have no point...and that IS my point.

In response to previous reviews that ""it's JUST a movie"" I offer the following.  For most of those in the U.S., it's true that their experience with this film will be nothing more than an entertaining or even controversial movie. However, for the rest of the world it is not JUST a movie. Do none of you realize that American films are seen worldwide and are seen in a different context? As Americans, we need to stop assuming that the rest of the world thinks and acts like we do. Do you really think that if this movie were shown in an Islamic country (doubtful it ever would, but if it were shown...) do you think those folks leaving the theater would say, ""oh those silly Americans. It's just a movie. Now lets go get dinner"". If you think that would be the scenario, then your intelligence is lower than I can comprehend.

This movie isn't about a doomsday bomb scenario. It's not about torture or the killing of a few to save the many. Those are VERY small elements in the greater theme of this movie. This movie does nothing more than to incite hatred against Americans and tells the world that we would even torture our own citizens if they claim to be Muslims, regardless of their crime.  ""You can't try a man with no fingernails"". And no, ""we"" (as US citizens) didn't make the movie, but ""we"" are still responsible in some part for these types of productions.  If we buy them, rave about them, then Hollywood will make more. The film itself should be seen as a national security threat because of the hatred it will now create among non-American Muslims when the film is seen outside of the United States.

Of any time in history, we should not be producing more material and reason for Muslims to hate and despise America, yet this film does just that.  I consider this film to be a voice from American media to Islam that says ""Yes, America hates you even if you are an American citizen, so please continue your terrorism against our nation and people.  The title is entirely accurate because such a poor excuse for entertainment is Unthinkable.",1293494400,5,2560,4.63355408388521

I was emotionally awakened, and...no matter how much I've read and discussed in class the subject of terror and torture, I never fully understood the moral dilemma 'til I watched this movie.
The film moved at a good pace with a phenomenal cast, and the story was told in such a provocative way that I couldn't tear my eyes off the screen half way through.
The anticipation of the torture made me uneasy, but, I felt I had to keep watching to get the point of the movie.

When I simply read about torture, I felt disconnected to it, and was confused as to which side to take (torture/kill a few, save a million, or don't torture/kill at all, but run the risk of killing a million indirectly).
However, now I'm leaning towards the lesser evil, because I couldn't let a million people die if I could help it, even if I have to kill a few.
I'd have to break myself emotionally to do it- and, even if it means children, although I don't know if I could actually do it when the time comes, but I wouldn't stop it if someone else did.

Yeah, torture is wrong, but sometimes questioning/negotiating leads NO WHERE.
Then what? Just let the bomb go off and kill ALL those people?
It doesn't make sense.

""Unthinkable"" puts the viewer in the squirmy frame of mind to start considering how far is too far when trying to save millions of lives from a deranged terrorist bent on nuclear annihilation of millions of innocents.

What I find so brilliant about the film is that it manages to delve deeply into the very controversial issues of torture and interrogation methods for learning information critical to an immediate threat to innocent life without being preachy in either direction or ostensibly taking a side. It's a shame that so many of the previous reviewers of this film lack the ability to review it in such a manner, but this to me illustrates the significance of this film's accomplishment in exploring the issues at length without judgment either way.

Make no mistake; in this film there is graphic depiction of torture, but to my mind it cannot be called gratuitous. For the viewer to really begin pondering the question of abandoning certain values that inevitably make us weaker versus abandoning our humanity, it is necessary, I believe, for us to understand exactly what it is we are condoning when we say ""I think torture is acceptable if...""

Even once we enter sort of a ""comfort zone"" with what we are witnessing, the film delves even further by taking the process into the ""Unthinkable"". Which of course is exactly the point. Can the ""Unthinkable"" suddenly become an option? Without drawing any conclusions, the film draws you along into the dark recesses of the human psyche and makes you inevitably face the question in your own mind as you watch the harrowing drama unfold on the screen. Regardless of what side you fall on, or even if you remain uncertain of *which* side you fall on at all, as I do, the ability of the movie to keep you thinking on the subject long after the credits roll is unquestionable.

Moss and Jackson are positively brilliant, and the odd awkward scene or dialog cannot lessen the impact of this intense, provocative psychological thriller. An absolute must-see.",1289174400,,2185,4.881401617250674

More than anything in the War on Terror - we fight ourselves, our darkness, our secrets, our fears.

This film highlights the slippery moral slope of what we can do in war and what the cost is.  At the end of the film, when you hate Samuel L Jackson's character and he asks ""he killed 68 people and I'm the bad guy?""  you have to examine the question - Is he?

The movie is graphic and disturbing--you can't take your eyes off of it.  The climax is sudden and doesn't answer a pivotal question, but I think this is intentional.  The movie is all about what we will do or shouldn't do.  It's a very well done thriller.",1286496000,3,491,4.821428571428571
4120205,5,B003FTM18W,"Extremely powerful.  I finished watching this movie a few moments ago, and am struggling to come up with the words to describe it.  First I should say that the movie is graphicly violent, as most of it is based on the torture of one suspected terrorist.  The movie generally plays on the what-ifs and what people assume is the worst case scenario to an attack on the United States.  However unlikely we may want to say the story is, those that have researched wartime history know that as humans we have been and can be amazingly cruel.  One of the things that I thought was well done with this movie is that... at least to me... did not seem to tell the story from only one perspective.  Whether it was the conflict between ""suspect"" and government agencies, or the conflict between giving life value or to torture, or whether we would be willing to destroy everything we are in order to save ourselves.  I was hesitant to rent this movie at first simply because I have not been impressed with Samuel Jackson's choices of roles over the past few years... but I think this is the best work he has done in a long time.  Despite that the movie may take some turns the viewer finds unthinkable, they were smart enough to know that not everything has to be shown to be conveyed.  And unfortunately for us as the human race, the reality could be worse than what the movie even implies.  But I believe the movie was made to make the viewer think, because in the end there may be no definitive moment for either side to say ""Aha!  See I was right, and therefore it was all worth it.""",1286409600,23,1576,4.381443298969073

4120207,1,B003FTM18W,"Early on, this film treats you to a visually explicit depiction of a US torturer cutting the fingers off a man; things gradually worsen as the story progresses. Yet this inhuman cruelty pales in comparison with the moral depravity and intellectual sadism of the writer and director.

This film has a realistic veneer but the plot is based upon the most unlikely and ludicrous, not to mention insidious, of conceits. Specifically, there has never been one single verified instance in the whole history of mankind, nor in the 9 year history of the War on Terror, when the fabled 'Ticking Bomb Scenario' has ever existed.

In case you have never had your brain abused by the sound of US lawmakers justifying torture, the Ticking Bomb Scenario is their favorite. This is a fictional scenario wherein US authorities have a verified terrorist in custody and simultaneously happen to know that unless they can squeeze info from said terrorist in a short time span, hundreds, thousands, or millions of people will be killed by that terrorist's plot.

There are multiple problems with the Ticking Bomb Scenario, such as the unlikelihood of authorities simultaneously having a genuine terrorist in custody that they genuinely and verifiably know has the information they want, concurrent with verifiable knowledge that a mass terror act is about to occur. On top of that, you have to be able to verify the info the terrorist tells you, otherwise he could lie when they torture him. And if they can verify that what he confesses is the truth, then why did they need to torture him anyway? The relevancy here is that the writers had to construct a reality in which the Ticking Bomb Scenario is possible. This results in a plot that is ludicrous.

Not to mention, Carrie Ann Moss plays an FBI interrogator who lacks the interviewing skill of even Barney Fife. So obviously, non-torture interrogation will not work in this world.

Worse, the plot serves so as to justify Samuel L. Jackson performing the most odious and vile tortures, with hapless Carrie Ann Moss forced to watch and enable such depravity.

This film is full of damned lies and disinformation that go unchallenged, and these damned lies are too numerous to list in this review. One of the worst lies, however, is when Samuel L. Jackson says that torture has been used effectively throughout history to obtain information.

In fact, torture was invented as method of intimidation, and was not used with the intent of gathering intelligence until the last 200 or so years or so. Moreover, there has not been a single verified instance where any information obtained by torture has saved one single human life.

The Nazis, for example, tortured prisoners extensively in WWII for intelligence, yet were completely surprised by D-Day, even to the extent that General Rommel was far from Normandy, celebrating his wife's birthday when the Allies landed. If torture yielded intel, then nobody should have ever been able to surprise the Nazis. Yet the Allies, did, again and again and again.

The Catholic Church used torture extensively during the inquisition, but what that yielded was false confessions and fables of witches and demons. Nothing in the way of 'actionable intelligence.' The Romans were masters at the art of torture, but they didn't use it for intel. No, they used on rebels such as Sparticus and his slave army, and they left their tortured bodies along the road to discourage others from revolting.

So yes, torture has existed for ever, but it has never saved any lives.

Carrie Ann Moss and Samuel L. Jackson are forced to make heavy-handed and absurd speeches justifying and condemning torture. The filmmakers appear to desire one of two results: 1) Conservative viewers, who already favor torture, will come away from this film secure in their resolve that torture is necessary to protect America from Muslims. (And yes, this is film is sufficiently anti-Muslim for Glen Beck to show it at his next rally.) 2) Liberals viewers will be less secure in their belief that torture is wrong.

As we have seen since 2003, once we began to debate the possibility that torture might be an acceptable tactic, we were lost. Pragmatically, as well as morally.

In an America that is steadily becoming more violent, more murderous, more sadistic, more paranoid, and more bigoted, there is no need for such a movie as this. There are no lessons in this movie, only incitements to and justifications of sadism. This is the most vile piece of cinema I have ever seen.",1285632000,16,4521,4.90956749672346

He gets caught on purpose and is brought to an undisclosed location to be ""interrogated.""  Sam Jackson is brought in to do the dirty work and Carrie Anne Moss is brought in to assist.

So....how do you feel about torture? You see plenty of it here and it's more than gruesome. And that's what the movie is about. The terrorist is going to kill millions of people. We're not supposed to be doing any torturing but we will in this case to save the millions. If we fail, they die. If we succeed we're showing ourselves to be a brutal, uncaring people. As the terrorist (very well acted by Michael Sheen) says, our acts have caused the deaths of countless civilians, so why should it be OK for us and not for him? It's as though we're slogging around in the mud and it just gets deeper and deeper.

The arguments rage on both sides of the issue and everybody is right and everybody is wrong. So I suppose we have to ask ourselves"" 'Why are we in this situation to begin with?'

Carrie Anne Moss does a fine job, but I'd pay to watch her eat corn flakes so don't take my word for it. Sam Jackson is almost scary in his cool resolve. He looks at the entire situation logically and, as a result, is able to emotionally distance himself from the horrible acts he's committing.

The rest of the cast does a decent job and all the production values are professional so there is no distraction to the viewer from what is taking place on screen

This movie puts the viewer in an uncomfortable situation. They're thrown into a room with no exit. The terrorist is an American so racism doesn't enter the picture. He is also a highly skilled special ops guy so he knows the ropes which puts his interrogators at a disadvantage.

4120240,4,B003FTM18W,"The situation: Nuclear bombs are planted in at least three American cities and a terrorist has decided he will endure any torture, if necessary, to stick to his beliefs. Samuel Jackson plays H, a man who is willing to do just about anything to get information from the terrorist. Things become very bloody and very gory quite quickly.

Before describing this movie any further, I need to be clear that if you have ANY difficulty watching graphic portrayals of a man being tortured...you will definitely have issues with this one. Whether you can stand to watch the movie or not, at least think about what levels of torture you would find acceptable to save lives. Not every single detail of the torture is shown but there is enough to be quite graphic, along with the screams of a man in deep pain. It is very easy to imagine exactly what is being done...even when it isn't shown.

Helen Brody, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, balances out H's commitment to full scale torture. She is horrified by how the terrorist is treated but also has to question her values as time goes on.

When the movie ended, I confess that I said, ""Wait! Is that the ending? They left it like THIS?!""That ought to tell you that this isn't one of those movies where every last detail is nicely explained and packed in a fine, neat ending with a moral or message with a capital ""M"". You aren't pounded over the head with any meaning. However, after I got over my initial disappointment (after all, I'd watched all those torture scenes and that is NOT my cup of tea), I started to realize how the ending made sense.

My take is that this movie is meant to get people thinking how far they would be willing to go to potentially save lives. Also at stake: how useful is torture in getting the truth out of the tortured? What toll does it take on those who are torturers? How do people who have a strong distaste of certain types of torture react when they have to question their deepest beliefs?

In spite of my strong reaction to the ending, this movie did leave me thinking about it for days so that could be reason enough to see it. Samuel L. Jackson gives a very strong performance and the woman who plays his wife (can't recall the name of that actress) has one powerful moment where I believe she makes Helen Brody realize that life is far more complex than Brody ever realized. I may not be remembering these words perfectly but Brody doesn't hide her disgust when she asks H's wife something like ""How can you justify what he does? How can you accept him?"" The wife explains her side of things and Brody is forced to think beyond ""good"" and ""evil"" and truly wonder what needs to be done to keep the country safe. At least, she starts down the path of doubt.

I related strongly to the characters and wish I hadn't assumed that the ending would be so pat. If you want a suspense movie that makes you think, try this one. If you like to know exactly ""what happens next?"" the ending may leave you feeling let down. It left me feeling that way. But the movie still haunted me.",1279411200,14,3049,4.42602495543672

This movie examines some of the core issues brought up in the now defunct 24. In fact, I  would venture to say that all 24 fans will like this movie very, very much. This movie is a full examination of the philosophies of using torture on terrorist suspects but unlike 24, the main focus here is clearly the issue.

4120244,4,B003FTM18W,"I usually cringe when I hear the word ""important"" ascribed to a movie.  It sounds like something you'd hear from an affected psuedo-intellectual endorsing a film that pushes his pet social agenda.  But I can't think of a better word to describe this film.

It's easy to forget what a potentially dangerous age this is.  It's theoretically possible for a single person to destroy entire cities and kill millions with weapons that exist today.  That's the very scenario faced by government agents in this film who are tasked with interrogating the one terrorist who can stop it.  Once the scene is set, most of the rest of the film is about the interrogation and the various methods used to try to extract information from the terrorist.

Some of the very important questions this film asks are: How far do you go with your interrogation tactics?  How does the law apply in a case like this?  Where do you draw the line?  Should there even be a line when this much is at stake?  The film doesn't answer these questions, it merely asks them.

The ending of the theatrical version is intentionally ambiguous (I've not seen the extended version on this disc, which I've read adds a couple minutes to the ending).  Some reviewers apparently didn't care for that.  In my opinion, they missed the point of the filmmakers.  This is a movie designed to make viewers think about this topic and decide for themselves what is right.  Answers aren't spoonfed to you.  Ambiguous endings are sometimes frustrating, but I think it was the best way to conclude this film.

Viewers should be warned this is an adult-oriented film that takes a serious look at some of the harshest interrogation tactics that exist in the world.  That said, this isn't like watching some mad-slasher movie where violence is thrown in for horror and shock value.  Some of the worst tactics take place out of view of the camera, but what is implied is pretty horrendous.

To reduce this movie to a simple comment about the ending or the realism of it all is to not know a whole lot of things about story telling. Without revealing too much, the movie is not about whether or not the bombs explode. It's not even about how realistic it all is. It's about morality, values and how far we are willing to loose our humanity in order to save, well... humanity. Or parts of it.

The characters are face with an incredible dilemma. Some will choose one avenue. Others will not. The results could be devastating. Even the character played by Samuel L. Jackson, at some point, cannot proceed without the moral ""go ahead"" of the character played by Carry-Ann Moss (the ever so beautiful Carry-Ann Moss) who is at the center of the story.  If she looses it, then all Hell breaks loose. If she stays focus, then God himself is behind her. When face with the biggest decision of her career (or her life), she finally breaks down and brings everyone to reason.

I believe she is right. But that is the interesting discussion that this incredible movie will raise. How far are we willing to go?

After that, once this is answered, who cares if the bombs explode or not? The bombs were just a motor of the story, something to create an emergency. I don't even want to know if this is how it really would go. The morality stays the same.

It's easy to sit in our living room and go: ""Yeah, I would do it!"" But would you be the one to actually do it? Kill in order to save? And not just kill anyone but... well, I let you see for yourself.

I do think that the character played by Jackson goes too far at some point (with the wife) but again, it will raise questions and create debates. And every actor and actresses in this movie are excellent. Michael Sheen is the new Robert DeNiro of our time. We even get Superman in person (Brandon Routh... Man! Does he look like Christopher Reeve)!

And Carry-Ann Moss. Has God ever created a more perfect woman?

Not only does she bring credibility to every role she plays (if she believes it, we do) but also, she brings such an incredible sexiness to everything she does. A natural, mature and respectful sexiness. I feel like her team, in this movie, would do just about anything - go through a wall, face a bullet - in order to please her.

What a film. Forget those who only care about an Hollywood-like ending and so-called realism (yeah right!). Buy this and make others see it too. Then, have a debate.",1278374400,,2484,4.403930131004367

4120250,5,B003FTM18W,"As stated by many reviewers, this movie is a 5 star ""under the radar"" supernnova! Samuel Jackson portrays a ""non-existent"" terrorist interrogator, who is brought out to save the country from a nuclear Muslim terrorist, Arthur Younger played beautifully by Michael Sheen. Younger is frighteningly convincing with a mysterious conviction, a personal and religious agenda involving at least 3 hidden nuclear bombs of mass destruction, hidden in unknown metropolitan America.

Jackson's character is magnificent, simply known as ""H,"" the silver bullet weapon who is the only chance to extract key information and save millions from an impending holocaust. The movie races under a pressure cooker of time, obstacles of authority, and confusion on how far to go in this unbelievable quandry of intensity and horror. What does ""H"" need to do to uncover and neutralize this madman's design to kill millions of innocents? The military and intelligence teams are portrayed with sublime perfection, especially the supporting actress, Carrie Ann Moss. She is utterly convincing as an icon of righteousness in being Helen Brody, FBI supervisor. Helen is on a rollercoaster of confliction, bound by integrity, ethics, and procedure who undergoes a shattering metamorphasis as the plot unfolds into one of narrowing, ""unthinkable"" choices.

This movie is more than thought provoking...it erupts off the Richter scale with aftershocks of repercussion that stay with the viewer for days! Shameful, painful, but somehow justifiable degradation of civilized behaviors under the duress of mass annihilation. What exactly will we do to protect our own and how will we justify it after the fact? ""All virtue is summed up in dealing justly."" ~Aristotle~  The premise remains as to ""What is justice in certain circumstances...or does it cease to exist?"" How far can we go before we individually and collectively blur the lines of our ethics and morality and revert back to primitive survival instincts? Is survival a matter of virtue or justice? Are basic instincts wrong?

This movie is impossible to watch without churning up inevitable questions of what lies beneath our civilized behaviors. Physical and mental torture are dancing on the razor's edge, the director (Gregor Jordan) is masterful at capturing the hidden, delicate and sledge hammer effects of this incredible and poignant battle. A masterpiece that will haunt our thoughts into analyzing each and every facet in this prescient film. Absolutely unthinkable to miss this one...",1278115200,87,2519,5.402035623409669

That being said I did not see him as SLJ in this movie but as the character he was playing. A surprising bonus. In short I thought the movie was fantastic. The entire time it made you question your own beliefs and what you would be willing to do in the same situation.

4120263,3,B003FTM18W,"A man looks into a video camera, explains that he has changed his name from Steven Arthur Younger to Yusuf Mohammad, and that he has planted three nuclear bombs in the United States.  Unless his demands are met, the bombs will all detonate in a few days.  He then steps aside to reveal what looks like a nuclear device.  By the time Agent Helen Brody (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carrie-Anne-Moss/dp/B001ANQY38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carrie-Anne Moss</a>) of the FBI's Counter Terrorism Unit (why does that sound familiar?) learns the pertinent details she and her team find out that Younger (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Sheen/dp/B00005JPAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Sheen</a>) is already in custody.  Brody is assigned to learn the locations of those three nukes before they go off and kill millions of people, and is put off when her team is sent to a high school gymnasium where Younger is undergoing interrogation by the military.  Such ""interrogation"" means being deprived of sleep, sprayed with cold water, and forced to listen to blaring music.  Brody objects to what is going on and then a man who calls himself ""H"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samuel-L-Jackson/dp/0790739739/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samuel L. Jackson</a>), short for the complete fake name of Henry Herald Humphries shows up and is given carte blanche by the suits running the show to do whatever it takes to get Younger to confess.

Clearly ""H"" has experience, and one assumes notable success, in such endeavors, but the specifics are never provided and we are just suppose to take them as given.  Of course, since ""H"" is played by Samuel L. Jackson, you know he is the baddest mother in the building, and you wonder why it takes everybody else so long to catch up with that fact.  What happens to the terrorist is conveyed as much by suggestion as actual depiction, so do not think that director Gregor Jordan has entered the realm of torture-porn.  But then ""Unthinkable"" different from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>"" not just in the depiction of violence but in that the victim is not an innocent.  Throw into the mix that the intent of Peter Woodward's script is to have you question the morality and the efficacy of torturing people for information (a debate that goes back at least to ancient Rome, where testimony could only be accepted by slaves if they were tortured).

Agent Brody represents the voice of conscience in the proceedings, and I think it is a tad counter-productive to have a woman in the role since pretty much all of the other characters are male, so her arguments sometimes seem more maternal than legal.  While a few evince pangs or make actual protestations at what is going on (and I appreciated seeing some military people be in that number), clearly Brody is the pivotal white piece and in a real sense the big question in this movie is who is going to break first, Younger or Bordy.  From a performance standpoint it is Sheen who stands out and in many ways his is the most interesting character since he makes it easy to be captured because he wants to be in this position, an element of the game that only ""H"" seems to appreciate.  That raises the question of whether Brody is an impediment to the interrogation or part of ""H""'s masterplan.

There is a problem with ""Unthinkable"" being a cinematic case study for what is a real world debate on torture, because it deals with what is the worst case scenario.  I fully believe that in such a circumstance, where weapons of mass destruction are in play, the U.S. government has someone with direct knowledge in custody, and the clock is literally ticking, that they will do anything to try and get the information.  I also think that such efforts will almost certainly fail, but I cannot imagine somebody going over the line, whether such actions are authorized or not, which has been evidence time and again with Jack Bauer on ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B0027CSMWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>.""  That being said, the focus of the debate today is more on the day to day use of waterboarding and other techniques, and it is hard to say that this 2010 film contributes to that discussion.  I fully expect people on both sides to watch this movie and turn to their opponents and say, ""I was right and you were wrong.""

It is hard to believe that a movie starring Samuel L. Jackson would go the direct to DVD route, especially when you throw Moss and Sheen into the mix, but that is what happened with this film.  Speculation about the motive for the studio's decision seems to run towards being afraid of the controversial nature of the storyline (one can imagine liberals and conservatives coming to blows in theatre lobbies across the nation), although it has been noted by many that direct to DVD does not necessarily bear the same sort of stigma that was true back in the direct to video days.  As for the ending of ""Unthinkable,"" I cannot say that it was a surprise to me because I sort of anticipated it given the rhetorical tenor of the film.  Of course, given everything we have seen, this is where ""Unthinkable"" has to fade to black.",1277251200,7,5402,5.211316397228638

4120265,2,B003FTM18W,"Well color me surprised...Another morality play where WE (the USA) are the Bad Guys. You'd think this was written & directed by a terrorist who was detained at Gitmo, then ordered to be released by our new Administration just in time to make a film like this to show us and the world how brutal and terrible Americans are and that we have little or no redeeming value. Just what I wanted to see on a Friday night! [sarcasm]

As usual, Samuel L. pulls his load and that of several other non-memorable characters in the movie. He's the only reason I give Unthinkable 2 stars. There's a part of me that kept watching just to see what means of torture Jackson's character would employ next...And trust me, you won't be disappointed in this area! Carrie-Anne Moss was underwhelming to say the least with her character often looking like someone who can't decide whether to take the backroads or the freeway home...Then whichever way she chose, she turns around halfway there and decides she'd get home sooner if she just went the other way. I hate this for her too since she was always A+ in the Matrix films. She just kept bumping into herself in this one...

None of the other characters even register, and yes, I'm including Michael Sheen. SPOILER: He plants Nukes in 3 US cities, intentionally gets caught so he can be tortured and has B.S. demands that hardly justify such extreme actions. Oh, and did I mention he's an American Citizen? So we have an American Black Ops Interrogator torturing an ""American"" terrorist who is planning to incinerate some 10 million Americans...Hmmmm. Any questions as to WHY this film wasn't released in American theaters? Wouldn't that kind of be, you know, UNTHINKABLE?

SPOILER: What really gets me is the piss-poor ENDING of this movie. I mean, you invest an hour and a half to see if he discloses the location of the 3 bombs. Then in the final 5 minutes you find out there's a FOURTH bomb...Well, probably...Uh, MAYBE. But you're just going to have to figure that one out on your own. The film ends with Carrie-Anne walking outside with the terrorist's 2 children and gazing off into the distance...Roll credits. ARE YOU FREAKIN KIDDING ME?!?! I really HATE films that think they rise above everything to the point that they FAIL to finish the friggin story they pushed on you for an hour and a half! It's like an old Sat morn serial where they give you the cliffhanger so you show up next week to find out what happened. Only THERE'S NO NEXT WEEK with a feature-length film like this!!

I imagine they got such a NEGATIVE focus group response from that cop-out ending that they quickly made an alternate ending for the DVD release - ""The Extended Version"". Well, it did extend the end by about 2 whole minutes so they could put yet another mind-frig on you. So now you're left with not one inconclusive ending to ""contemplate"", but TWO! And that truly is UNTHINKABLE. In fact, by the time I ejected the DVD, I JUST DIDN'T CARE if anyone blew up or not after being fairly engaged for an hour and a half!

4120266,3,B003FTM18W,"UNTHINKABLE is.  A film that must rely on the grisly details of torture methods is bound to miss its point.  Writer Peter Woodward and Director Gregor Jordan probably had in mind a film that would make the audience realize that the methods of destructive forces no matter the side of origin are equal.  Does that make us need to see in a film what we see in the newspaper everyday?

The story focuses on a young American man Stephen Arthur Younger who has become an Islamic terrorist, planting three nuclear bombs in three American cities, setting up his capture, and then resisting revealing the information about his plot as he undergoes torture.  Michael Sheen is the young terrorist and probably accepted the role to test his acting chops.  It is alarming to watch what all he goes thorough at the hands of the very secretive government torturer Henry Herald 'H' Humphries (Samuel L Jackson), only slightly deterred by another US government official Agent Brody (Carrie-Anne Moss).  Younger (his Islamic name is Yusef) struggles to the end as he bears up under mutilation of his physical being and then begins to crack under the introduction of including his wife and children in the scheme.  At this point there are a few twists to the plot that make the film almost gain interest, and the ending is one that thankfully does not sell out to Hollywood style capers.

If there is a reason to endure this film it is to see how broad is Michael Sheen's acting ability (the reason for the three star rating).  But the film does not flesh out any of the characters well enough to make us care about them and in the end it is a rather messy replay of what likely goes on in POW camps around the world - on every side of the concept of who is right and who is wrong.
