395176,5,6301973313,"A beautiful and touching story with Bette Davis, as a young lady who sees her cousin Delia get all the luck, when Margaret starts a home for abandoned children and also her illigimate daughter. But after her foundation is closed she moves in with her Cousin who infatuates the child.

The 31 year old Bette Davis ages thirty years in the part of Charlotte Lowell, an unwed mother who bears a daughter soon after the father is killed in the Civl War. Taken away by Charlotte's treacherous cousin Delia, the child's misguided devotion is won by Delia, while the once lovely Charlotte deteriorates into a sever tight lipped sour old maid.

Great film for the bette Davis fan.",1136851200,6,672,4.686440677966102
395177,3,6301973313,"Considering our perception of those prudish days gone by, this one has a pretty racy storyline rife with infidelity, adultery and illegitimacy.  Bette Davis is great in the first half, even while Miriam Hopkins emotes wildly like a silent movie actress.  Unfortunately, the movie falls apart in the second half and Davis plays everything on one note, with an absurd makeup job that screams out community theatre.  We come to expect a gigantic payoff that is never delivered.  A disappointment, but not bad rainy afternoon matinee fare.",1058745600,4,535,5.114942528735632
395178,4,6301973313,"Bette Davis stars as an unmarried mother in 1870's America who allows her wealthier, widowed cousin Miriam Hopkins to raise her daughter, thus saving the child and herself from any scandal.  The child's father, George Brent, was Hopkins' former fiance, and was killed in the Civil War.  Needless to say, it's a painful thing to watch her daughter calling another woman Mother.  Davis gives a sympathetic, tightly controlled performance that anchors the film.  Hopkins' character isn't well defined, although she manages to give the character some dimension.  Brent, in the presence of these two actresses staking their territories, is his customary non-presence.  Jane Bryan, as the grown up daughter, again shows that it is too bad her career in Hollywood didn't last more than a few years.  She's excellent as the spoiled, headstrong girl.  The film has a number of quiet, moving moments, although I found the pacing a little slow.  Of course, this isn't the ideal subject matter for me in a film, but I do recognize the quality of the film.  I think fans of melodrama and Davis will certainly want to make a point of seeing this movie.  I think there are other better unwed mother films, but this one also delivers.",1021507200,14,1218,4.892682926829268
395179,4,6301973313,"This melodrama / tearjerker is fairly typical of Hollywood from the 1930s to the 1960s - a basically decent woman breaks the moral code of her day and pays dearly for it. The story is interesting, but its biggest asset is Bette Davis' rather subdued performance as Charlotte Lovell, the woman who pays the price. Made in 1939, the film is from Davis' golden period. She was nominated for an Academy Award every year from 1939 to 1943. While her work here is strong, she received no special acclaim for it, possibly because the role is so similar to the one she played in the superior ""Jezebel"", for which she won an Oscar in 1939.
The movie begins during the Civil War. Socialite Delia Lovell [Miriam Hopkins] is about to be wed, and her cousin Charlotte is in attendance. When Delia learns that the man she promised to marry two years earlier is in town, she sends Charlotte to beg him not to make a scene. The guy is one Charlotte is secretly in love with, and she winds up consoling him in a very intimate fashion. Several years pass. The man has been killed in the war, and Charlotte is running a home for war orphans. When Delia learns that one of the children is actually one Charlotte had out of wedlock and that the father was the dead soldier, she destroys Charlotte's chance to marry a very prominent man. In a cruel twist of fate, Charlotte's daughter grows up in Delia's home and is led to believe that her mother is her aunt.
Bette Davis was a rather unusual star for her time because she was also a consummate actress. As such, she demanded roles in which glamour and beauty were often cast aside. Stunningly pretty in the first part of the movie, she spends the rest of it heavily made up to look like a dowdy old maid aunt. It's a startling transformation. By contrast, her co-star, Ms. Hopkins, typical of female stars at the time, barely ages at all. Hopkins actually gives a sensitive, studied performance, but, because of her determination to portray her character as realistically as possible, Davis totally dominates the picture.
The photography and the sets are first-rate. The script seems a little truncated, and I wonder if the print we have today is an edited one that the studio made for second run engagements. [This was a common practice in those days.] The score by Max Steiner is not one of his best and relies heavily on stock music, such as Old My Darling Clementine and Wagner's Wedding March. But when would he have had the time to compose one of his full, lush scores for the movie? He worked on at least a dozen movies that year. One of those was ""Gone With the Wind"".",1021420800,18,2606,4.5
395180,5,6301973313,"Superlative soaper in which two cousins, Charlotte (Bette Davis) and Delia (miriam Hopkins) have the misfortune to love the same man, Clem (George Brent), with lifetime repercussions for both.
The film begins around the time of the Civil War. Clem returns home, only to find that the woman he loves, Delia, is getting married that same day. She is marrying a rich banker and, though she loves Clem, a ne'er do well, she wants security, so she goes through with the marriage. Seeing and seizing an opportunity, Charlotte declares herself to Clem, telling him how she has always loved him, as he goes off to fight in the war.
Duting the war, Charlotte manages to hook up with Clem long enough to get pregnant. While away, ostensibly to recover from an illness, she has Clem's out of wedlock baby, unbeknownst to the very married Delia. Clem, in the meantime is killed in action. When Charlotte returns home, she converts her stables into a foundling home for war orphans. Among them is a special favorite named Tina.
Charlotte decides to marry her cousin's brother-in-law. On the day of her wedding, Charlotte confesses to Delia what happened between her and Clem and tells her the truth about Tina. Delia, insanely jealous over this, puts a crimp in Charlotte's wedding plans. and the wedding never takes place.
Charlotte remains single and becomes a bitter and formidable woman whom Tina knows as Aunt Charlotte. Delia, meanwhile, has Tina call her ""Mummy"", much to Charlotte's chagrin. Delia is having the ultimate revenge, as she has never forgiven Charlotte for her amatory trespass. As Tina grows into womanhood, she speaks disparagingly to Charlotte, saving her love and adoration for ""Mummy"". As Tina approaches the age at which young women marry, Charlotte makes the ultimate sacrifice for her daughter. It is a sacrific that Tina will never know, but one that will allow Tina to have the hapiness that Charlotte never had.
Miriam Hopkins and Bette Davis give wonderful performances, each compelling in its own way. Charlotte's appearance toward the end of the film is a caricature of the proverbial old maid, while Delia remains youthful and vibrant. Undoubtedly, Charlotte's appearance is a result of her suffering, knowing that her own flesh and blood loves another, as a child love's its mother. This is a film that will long be remembered by the viewer for the performances given by these two divas.",1008460800,52,2411,4.955555555555556

Put a little brandy in that  hot chocolate and sit back and enjoy the fine performances of these two  wonderful actresses.  Bette Davis is in top form as the victim in this  ""in the name of love"" story. Whats also surprising and most  enjoyable is Miriam Hopkins ability to not let Bette steal the whole show.

395182,5,6301973313,"This costume picture, taken from the Pulizer Prize play by Zoe Akins (adapted by the Edith Wharton novelette) has Davis playing an unwed mother who's forced to turn over her 5-year-old daughter over to Miriam Hopkins (of all people!) her married cousin, Delia. Bette then must stand by and watch as the daughter grows up treating her contemptuosly as a spinster aunt.  Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins had thier legendary ""feud"" during the making of this highly esteemed yet mostly forgotten Davis vehicle.
In her playing of the sacrificial - mother role of Charlotte Lovell, Bette gives an admirable and creditable performance, but in her playing of this type of part (the sacrificial mother)  - which was meat-and-potatoes to many a trouper - Davis builds her characterisation so painstakingly that she tends to lose her flair and her character turns rather mealy. While this film seems to be a deliberate attempt to play upon the viewer's emotions, it's a superior mother-love story; the entire production has style, which is enhanced by Orry-Kelly's costume designs and Max Steiner's music score. My only real complaint is that the daughter (Jane Bryan) never finds out that Davis (as her ""old maid"" Aunt Charlotte) is indeed her mother and because she never finds out the truth, Bette is made out to be a martyr and the viewer is left more than a trifle unsatisfied. Davis herself never much liked this film for reasons which are unclear. The esteemed film critic Lawrence J.

395375,3,6301973313,"I'm happy enough watching this, but I sure ain't gonna start a parade.

It starts off with Davis as a bridesmaid, ducking out on her duties (that always happens) to do the nasty with Geroge Brent.  Who supposedly is involved with Miriam Hopkins (who phones it in a la Norma Shearer), but Hopkins is marrying Brent's brother, ""A Ralston!"" and Davis winds up having

a baby.

That she hides and he hides and everybody hide hides.  Davis does the only thing she can do: open an orphange.

""Twenty children to hide one!""

The baby grows up and poor Bette is waylaid by so many emotions she becomes an old maid. At 25 or so.  The precise age where every woman becomes an old maid. But it's Davis so we just live with this cinematic fluff.  She will never make love again with any man.  Hopkins, as her cousin, who married the ""Ralston"" of choice,  takes the kid in and raises it as her own.  The great lie begins.

Of course the girl grows up. And, according to the doctor (there was always a doctor hanging around in these parts and times) he diagnoses the girl as being ""too happy"".

WTF?  The girl is ""roo happy"", and so we must MUST reel her in.  And she's in love.

""When she walks, she dances, when she laughs, she sings"" or some such BS.  That's the good doctor's diagnosis.  We, as the audience, can do nothing to sway him.  We sit there and take it. Too happy????  Is there even such a thing?  But the doctor gives his verdict and everyone worries about ""the girl"".  The girl that Davis borned and that Hopkins raises.  How on earth can anyone be too happy?  Obviously, it's a sickness in this 1800 (circa) year or so clap=trap.  Too happy. Please.

I would love to be so happy and not have a doctor tell me that I was ""too happy"".  Happiness as a sickness?  WTF?

Davis is marvelous, and so, sometimes, is Hopkins.  But really: ""too happy?""  Whoever heard of such a thing??????",1336608000,2,1882,4.3497109826589595
395376,5,6301973313,"One of Davis' most overlooked gems, 1939's THE OLD MAID (based on the Zoe Akins play which itself was drawn from the Edith Wharton novel) finds Ms Davis in peak form, playing opposite rival Miriam Hopkins as cousins bound together by a scandalous family secret.

On the day of her marriage into the rich Ralston family, Delia Lovell (Miriam Hopkins) is shocked to welcome a visit from her former beau, Clem Spender (George Brent).  Explaining to him that money and stability mean much more to her than romantic bliss in the long-term, Delia breaks off their relationship for good.  Looming in the wings is Delia's meek cousin Charlotte (Bette Davis), who privately reveals her own feelings for Clem, before he leaves for the Civil War.

Years pass, in which time Clem is revealed to have been killed in battle.  Charlotte opens a home for displaced war orphans, but there's one child amongst the brood that's more special than the others - Tina - her secret lovechild with Clem.  When Charlotte's last hope for marriage is dashed and Delia's husband is killed in an accident, the two women and their respective children all move in together, where the roles of the ""mother"" and ""aunt"" of Tina become blurred for respectability's sake.  Charlotte dutifully assumes the mantle of Tina's fussy, strait-laced aunt, but how long can she keep her silence about Tina's true parentage?

THE OLD MAID is a grand drama, much too refined and accomplished to ever be regarded as ""soap"", despite often being labelled as such.  Bette Davis' softer roles are frequently forgotten in the wake of her ferocious turns in ""All About Eve"", ""Baby Jane"", etc., but let us never forget that she could also underplay her parts when the scripts called for it as well.

It's in THE OLD MAID that the long-standing rivalry between Davis and Miriam Hopkins came to the boil.  Their feud had started in the previous year, when Davis starred (to Oscar-winning effect) in ""Jezebel"", in the same role that Hopkins had played on Broadway in 1933--and no doubt also felt she should have reprised in the film!  Things weren't helped much when Davis insisted on calling Miriam by the sickly-sweet nickname of ""Hoppy"" on the set.  Their feud was in fact largely welcomed by publicists, who used the antagonistic angle to help play up anticipation for the film.  In 1943, Davis and Hopkins teamed for the second (and last) time in ""Old Acquaintance"".

George Brent was a frequent Bette Davis co-star (it's been said that she considered him something of a good luck charm) and could successfully play opposite her without shifting the spotlight.  In the same year, they also starred together in ""Dark Victory"", but the role of Clem in THE OLD MAID had in fact originally been offered to Humphrey Bogart, who spent a few days in the part before leaving the film.

Jane Bryan co-stars as the grown Tina.  If anybody could convincingly play the offspring of Bette Davis it was Ms Bryan, who, in the same year as THE OLD MAID, starred opposite James Cagney in the landmark prison drama ""Each Dawn I Die"".  Donald Crisp, Louise Fazenda, Cecilia Loftus and Jerome Cowan 'round out the cast. Highly recommended.",1315785600,2,3165,4.8277777777777775
395377,5,6301973313,A great movie... Bette Davis shows her strength at being able to show the many different aspects of a character. From a young and amiable women to an older and dour/strict women that has changed because of the circumstances she has endured.,1287446400,2,240,4.738095238095238

395449,5,6301973313,"Lush and yet beautifully quiet, `The Old Maid' is one of those films that you may never see because its stars went on to make more noted films, but that's what makes discovering this beautiful film all the more exciting.  With stellar performances by the entire cast (especially a young and remarkably mature Bette Davis) and a script that will leave you in tears, `The Old Maid' is the definition of a hidden gem.

Coming out in the year of all years (1939), it is easy to see how a film like `The Old Maid' could be overlooked with sweeping Hollywood epics and starry-eyed fairytales devouring the critical bests of the year.  Bette Davis herself starred in a slew of films this very year, and wound up Oscar nominated for her turn in `Dark Victory'.  Despite that, it is a shame that `The Old Maid' walked away without a mere mention at the Academy Awards, for it is a beautifully told and crafted film about love, life and sacrifice.

Charlotte and Delia are cousins.  On the outset of the film, the wealthy and rather spoiled Delia is getting married, only to find that her lover, Clem, has finally returned from war to make her his bride.  She maintains composure and goes through with her wedding, while Charlotte confesses her love for Clem and soon finds herself pregnant with his child, only to hear of his death overseas.  Instead of acknowledge her child, Charlotte lives as if Clementina is just an orphan staying in the orphanage she helps manage.  When Charlotte is about to wed Delia's brother-in-law her secret is revealed and her life is thrust into turmoil.  In order to care for her daughter the best way possible, Charlotte winds up moving in with Delia and soon finds that her own daughter starts gravitating towards Delia and considers her, her mother.

Thus, Charlotte becomes nothing but an old maid.

Davis is spectacular here, for she really understands the heartbreak that her character is undergoing.  She emulates that sheltered love very well, wearing a mask of harshness that is lifted ever so lightly by the devastation and pain in her eyes.  Miriam Hopkins is also quite good here (she reminds me a lot of Lana Turner in her roles in films like `Imitation of Life'), but Davis acts circles around her (Davis does have the meatier role).  I also really adored Donald Crisp here (such a standout supporting player he was) and Jane Bryan's frustrated tantrums were effectively handled without ever straying into that `actorly' territory.

In the end I really, really must recommend this film.  It is such a beautiful portrayal of parental love and sacrifice.  The pre-wedding night scene, where Charlotte enters her daughter's room, is just so heart-swelling; and that final kiss carries such emotional weight.  This film captures the true meaning of parenthood, even if this extreme case is one that hopefully we will never have to endure.",1263254400,5,2871,4.810590631364562
395450,5,6301973313,"THE OLD MAID is one of the most remarkable tearjerkers of all time.  Bette Davis was riding high as Hollywood's elite actress and in this film she shows how she could morph from a kindly and vivacious young woman to one who has aged unmercifully and deliberately all the while showing a mean streak that is mean only on the surface.  Director Edmund Goulding surrounded Miss Davis with a reliable stable of actors who had worked well with her in the past.  George Brent, who had just played her husband in DARK VICTORY, now is in love with Delia (Miriam Hopkins), who jilts him to marry into money.  Delia still loves him but coldly chooses a life of material things over love.  Bette Davis is Charlotte, Delia's cousin, who consoles Clem only too well, winding up in his arms.  She discretely has a baby off screen and chooses to raise her with the child thinking that Delia is the mother and Charlotte is ""Aunt Charlotte.""  Jane Bryan is Trina, who grows up loving Delia as her mother even knowing that she is not her biological daughter. What marks this film as the apex of sudsers is the shedding that each of the three female stars had to undergo relative to their respective motivations.  Bette Davis had to age in a most ungraceful manner in the second half of the film.  She is surprisingly mean to Jane Bryan, explaining her coldness only as a desire to hide the bitter truth.  Miriam Hopkins seemingly ages not at all, but she sheds her original skin of cold-bloodedness to become increasingly more humane and lovable as the film winds down.  As a subtext to the knowledeable theater-goer, in real life Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins were bitter rivals who spoke not a word together off screen.  Yet, their final scenes of reconciliation ring true.  Jane Byran plays against type as one who shouts at Charlotte: ""You are a dried up prune of an old maid.  You hate me because I am young and attractive and you are not.""  In earlier films Miss Bryan had played Miss Davis' love rival (KID GALAHAD) and her sister (MARKED WOMAN). Here as her daughter, Jane Bryan's lashing out at a woman who torments her for no apparent reason (at least to her)is no more than many other young women would have done.  By the last reel, each of the three women have gained at least a partial understanding of their basic drives and needs.  THE OLD MAID is a marvelous film that suggests that oldness need not be a disqualifying factor in determining one's essential goodness.",1260576000,2,2465,4.591324200913242

It may be something for an intelligent teen daughter to watch with her mother. If you like tense films where a lot of the tension is between women, you might like it. It's very much a soap-opera type of movie with drama around female relationships; it's surprising most of the reviewers are men.

The acting is certainly first rate, but at times you may find they lay it on a bit thick. The ending is somewhat surprising, yet not completely satisfying, and somewhat sad.

395454,5,6301973313,"An understated Davis meets up with overcooked Hopkins resulting in a wonderful classic Warner's women's picture.  Much has been written about the rivalry between Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins over the years since they worked together in several films. And each time I see one of their films I look for some hint that they hated each other.  It cannot be found!  These two were professional actress who never disappointed their fans or put anything above the story.

  Hopkins seems to our modern movie going eyes to often be over wrought and stagy. But often that is in fact the character and not her. She seems to be over done here but is in fact quite wonderful. By the end of the film you are aware of her power as a screen actress.  Her later work in such films as ""The Children's Hour"" shows that she was indeed a brilliant and subtle actress.

Bette Davis here gives one of her deepest and most restrained performances and is utterly winning from first frame to the heartbreaking last shot of the film. She shows us just how wide her range is and her understanding of film acting is as she goes from a gorgeous young girl tragically in love with George Brent to a repressed hard old maid who must bare her shame with steely resolve and solitude of soul.

A wonderful film well worth seeing time and again for in the end, it's all about the ladies!",1238716800,4,1354,4.471544715447155
395455,3,6301973313,"""The Old Maid"", based on an Edith Wharton play which was dated even in 1939, is a sturdy old warhorse about 2 cousins who both love George Brent. Miriam Hopkins rejects him for marriage to wealth and position and Bette Davis gives birth to his daughter out of wedlock. The film is a tour-de-force for Davis as she ages into a withered spinster, watching as Hopkins takes over the role of mother of her foundling. This is all pretty melodramatic stuff but Davis has the talent and skill to make her role very moving. Unfortunately, she is paired with that dreadful Miriam Hopkins, an actress who never missed an opportunity to gesture when it wasn't required and manages to foul up the bitterness between the 2 women by playing for sympathy and not ageing at all. No wonder Davis loathed her offscreen. The film is a sumptuous studio product and the DVD print is excellent.

The package comes with a comprehensive set of mainly mediocre extras, part of Warner's Night at the Movies, the best of which are the cartoons. The technicolour short on Abraham Lincoln may be a reasonable history lesson but it is artificial and dull. The trailer for ""Confessions of a Nazi Spy"", another Warner Brother's release of 1939, emphasises the studio's reputation for tackling topical issues.

The DVD is good value if purchased as part of the Davis Collection Volume 3.",1217116800,5,1354,4.757446808510639

Miriam is the beautiful cousin who has it all while Bette walks in the shadows. When Bette confesses that her illegitimate child was fathered by Miriam's old flame, Miriam seeks revenge. One of the most profitable films of 1939, this film has been well-preserved and still packs a thundering punch as one of the greatest cat fights of the silver screen.",1214784000,10,455,4.922077922077922

7818681,5,6301973313,"Having seen this movie recently on TCM, I found it to be captivating, well-acted and I most certainly enjoyed the performances of Mariam Hopkins and Bette Davis .. so, I ordered the DVD.  Ordering and delivery were superb as usual, from Amazon.  The disc is nicely secure in a very attractive case and the video and audio quality were both very, very nice.  But nearly a third of the way through the movie, I started noticing minor anamolies at first which became more numerous and sure as I began to anticipate, playback was going to be problematic.  The movie began stuttering and breaking up.  This only continued throughout no matter what action I took, leaving me very disappointed.  While it is entirely possible that my dvd player may be at the heart of the issue, I find this only happens on select DVDs while the vast majority of my DVDs play just fine without issue.  So, it's difficult to pin down whether my player simply doesn't like the media, the way the movie was recorded or whether it's actually an issue with my player.  Since I don't have another player to test it on, I opted to simply return the DVD for a refund, rather than take a chance on an exchange, since this particular disc was so very problematic.  I certainly don't want to dissuade others from considering purchase however, because I thought this movie was definitely one of those worth enjoying and having (fortunately, I was able to view the entire movie on TV to be able to appreciate that).  Hopefully, others will share their experience.",1512604800,,1526,4.66044776119403

(spoiler alert)
The ladies are in crinolines for this 19th century story (from a tale by Edith Wharton). When Delia Lowell (Miriam Hopkins) learns her old love has returned to town just as she's about to marry another, she sends Charlotte (Bette Davis) to tell him the news. Their assignation results in an illegitimate daughter, born when Charlotte 'has gone west for her health.'
When Delia learns who this 'foundling' really is, she wrecks Charlotte's forthcoming marriage. And when she offers Charlotte and daughter Tina a home in her mansion, Tina turns to Delia with love as 'Mummy' - so much nicer a person than sour 'Aunt Charlotte' ...

It's very dated now, and I have to say I prefer Davis as a villain to a wronged woman",1476662400,,827,4.783216783216783
