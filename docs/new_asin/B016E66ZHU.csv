The relationship between Caine and Keitel is incredibly entertaining and drives this film. Atleast for me. Star studded cast, very little not to like. Beautiful shots, phenomenal music throughout, safe to say I loved it, and it was the surprise film of the year for me. I had very little knowledge going in, outside of actors and director.

7470711,4,B016E66ZHU,"""Youth"" (2015 release from Italy; original title ""La giovinezza""; 124 min.) brings the story of Fred Ballinger (played by Michael Caine), an 80-something retired classical musician and orchestra director. Ballinger is on extended holiday in the Swiss Alps, along with his friend of 60 years, movie director Mick Boyle (played by Harvey Keitel), and Fred's daughter Lena (played by Racheal Weisz). As the movie opens, Fred is in discussion with someone from Buckingham Palace informing him the Queen wants to honor and knight him, if only in return he'll conduct his ""Simple Songs"", which Fred resolutely refuses (we later learn why). Meanwhile, we learn that Fred's daughter Lena and Mick's son Julien are married but divorcing. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Italian director Paolo Sorrentino, who a couple of years ago won the Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar for ""The Great Beauty"" (which in my book was overrated), and before that brought us that weird Sean Penn vehicle ""This Must Be the Place"", among others. Here, Sorrentino goes in a very different direction, brings us two old guys who reflect back on their lives, wondering what is left in store for them. There really is no substantive plot to speak of, just a collection of abstract, if visually gorgeous, tableaus of what is happening at the Swiss Alps spa-resort. The movie's pulse is of course Michael Caine's masterful performance as the retired orchestra conductor, whom we learn (among others from a raging monologue from his daughter Lena) has quite a troubled past as a husband and a father. There are many other noteworthy performances, including from Paul Dano, whom we saw earlier this year as Brian Wilson in ""Love and Mercy"", and here is plays the frustrated actor whom people only remember for one role (as the robot ""Mr. Q""). But wait... there is more! Deep into the second half of the film, Jane Fonda makes a memorable entr&eacute;e (as the old school actress Brenda Morel), and her 10 min. role is already garnering Best Supporting Actress Oscar buzz. Any discussion of ""Youth"" would be incomplete without mentioning the fabulous soundtrack, both the classical score (courtesy of David Lang), and the songs, the best ones being courtesy of Sun Kil Moon's Mark Kozelek. His track ""Ceiling Gazing"" (which also played prominently in the movie's trailer) is the emotional lynchpin of the movie: wistful, but not sentimental. (The soundtrack is available here on Amazon.)

I caught ""Youth"" a couple of days ago in Ft. Myers at what turned out to be its very last screening as the next day the movie was gone. The screening I saw this at was attended okay (mostly by seniors, I might add). This movie is slow-moving (in the best possible way), and as a result I can't see this reaching a large audience in the theater. Perhaps if Caine gets an Oscar nomination (and he certainly deserves one) it is possible that this movie finds a second breath in the theater, perhaps not. Regardless, I found it to be a fantastic movie, and would encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Youth"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1451692800,42,3326,4.864197530864198

7470717,1,B016E66ZHU,"Review of Youth
Hot Toasty Rag, September 26, 2017

I was so excited to see Youth. Michael Caine had been promoting it all year, claiming it was the movie he was most proud of in his career, and everyone hoped hed finally nab the Best Actor Oscar. It didn't make it to any of my local movie theaters, but I rented it the first available weekend. Had I sat through it, it would probably be one of the worst movies Ive ever seen. Thankfully, remotes have a little button called fast-forward so I was only forced to watch about thirty collective minutes.

Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel are on vacation in a spa in the Alps. Michael is a retired composer, and Harvey is a film director. Theyre old friends, and they talk about their work, their families, and getting older. Michaels daughter, Rachel Weisz, shows up because her husband left her, and an aging actress, Jane Fonda, shows up to talk about a role. Thats all I was able to get out of the plot. The disjointed scene transitions, strange music choices, minimalistic script, random nude women, and generally confusing storyline ruined the rest of the film. Unless you love art films and have the absolute opposite taste in movies as I do, I would tell you to stay as far away from Youth as possible.

Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to graphic nudity and confusing content, I wouldn't let my kids watch this movie.",1506384000,,1419,4.600790513833992

7470719,5,B016E66ZHU,"Around the cinema understood as a visual experience hovered of sublime metaphors and well rounded script, one can say there are not so many ones.

But fortunately in this case, we have in Paolo Sorrentino a legitimate inheritor of the unforgettable Federico Fellini, who recreates the painful and awful consequences of the old age; contrasting it with the marvelous (although brief) age of youth.

Well: the script shows us two old friends (Caine and Keitel). Caine is now a retired classical conductor who refuses to accept an Imperial request. On the other hand, we have in Keitel the unsatisfied director who doesn't know how to undertake his swan's song in terms of cinematographic language; obsessed and worried about the construction of the plot (A hearfteflt homage to Fellini's  8 1/2).

Meanwhile, the camera conveys us his points of view about life and common livings. (As a matter of fact Caine's son abandoned his couple (Keitel's daughter). The peaceful rhythm is a feast for our eyes with amazing landscapes from Switzerland.

Crude reflections around the process of deconstruction of the process of irreversible crumbling of the human body as well as the lack of sex-appeal, in front of many adorable women who are hostages on this hotel. Bitterness, visual poetic are awarded by a final which works out as a Greek chorus composed by many women (Another homage to FeFe City of women).

A smart and disturbing film that must be seen with astonishing perceptiveness.

Not for all tastes!!! But extremely rewarding for all those (Like me) who request from the cinema the artistic essence that it can give us!",1496880000,,1620,5.0

7470729,5,B016E66ZHU,"All audiences will not find this film appealing. Nor will they understand it. This film is beautiful; and many times it reminded me of walking through an art gallery looking at the various different paintings of artists. It is both European and very classicist. If you are not into the classics then this movie might not be for you. Those that are wealthy can most appreciate it. But those of us that are not, may not see the worth in the film. Looking at it from a mind of poverty, there may not be any way that one could relate to anything in this film including the dialogue. This is one reason, I could not recommend it for everyone. However, if I have had a decent education and are from the middle to upper class, I would appreciate everything about this film because I could relate to it. I, personally, enjoyed it because in so many ways it played out like a symphony. There were times it languished and at times was exuberant; times you will smile and times you might frown. An excellent example is when Paul Dano who (when practicing for a role to see what was a good character for him) played Hitler that had come to eat breakfast. Amazing and captivating scene. Someone mentioned the scene of Caine directing the cows in the field. Caine visiting his wife in the home. One last remark, is the unabashed shamelessness the Europeans have regarding their bodies. In addition, so many areas of cinematography that was beautiful to the eye. Even women who were heavily made up were both beautiful and ugly within the same moment. Yes, this film was literally a painting. So if you see it, see it with that thought in mind. I am going to see an animated painting.",1484092800,,1669,4.493421052631579

Michael Caine is superb as a famous, retired conductor struggling with personal grief--the real reasons for this are only learnt at the end. Both the scenery and the music are extraordinarily beautiful, and the cinematography is superb. The setting of the film in a hotel/spa in Switzerland, and the life of ""patients""/guests at the hotel reminds us of _The Magic Mountain_ by Thomas Mann, a novel that must have influenced the script.

It's times like this that I can be proud of a few human beings that still believe that we can use the industry to help people and make this a better world rather than simply to brainwash the mass's.
 I loved the film with all it's out-laddish characters and the cerebral incites about growing older or life in general that I smile at with tears running down my face because I thought I was the only one to have those thoughts. The thrust of the movie is about the brutality of looking back on our lives and how easy it would have been to be a kinder more loving human being.
I can't say enough good things about this film but of course in the Unite States it will flop as most all good films do that lack hundreds of explosions and thousands of deaths. This film makes me proud one more time.",1479945600,,952,4.230769230769231

7470744,5,B016E66ZHU,"After seeing Paolo Sorrentino's mesmerizing 2015 film Youth, it became readily apparent that this wonderful film is one of those hidden gems that was euthanized far too early by the timidity of its marketing and the inevitable group-think of critics who always need a ""box"" to deposit any work that boldly draws outside the lines.

Months before Youth's release I had seen the trailer before several features that left me bored and uninterested, offering what I thought was a stillborn re-hash of any number of unambitious ageist crowd-pleasers such as Mr. Holland's Opus and The Bucket List. Not that these film's didn't have their moments but here is the always on-point and peripatetic Michael Caine deposited in a crumbling Alpine resort teaching a central-casting moppet how to play the violin with Harvey Keitel loitering in some sort of free-floating geriatric limbo babbling about his enlarged prostate and urine flow. This sub-plot lasted only 90 seconds in the film and I have no idea why it was chosen to thematically represent Sorrentino's work.

What you really have in this terrific film is the brutal confrontation of aging into obsolescence by two former creative titans and life long friends (Caine as a retired classical composer and conductor, Keitel as a still working film director with his best days long behind him.) who have gone on an extended holiday for decades at an unnamed Swiss ""wellness"" resort that itself has aged into decrepitude with the requisite assortment of colorful staff and mausoleum-ready guests.

Along for the ride is the always excellent Rachel Weisz as Caine's daughter/personal assistant and Paul Dano as a young insecure actor who seeks osmotic wisdom from the surroundings having made his reputation as a Marvel Studio action hero but lacks the validation and self-confidence of a resume filled with important films. Without giving away a pivotal reveal, Dano's unlikely friendship with Caine and Keitel yields what I believe to be one of the great scenes in recent movie history as he continues to make the case that he may be the most important actor working in films today.

Make no mistake this is no warmed over version of Cocoon, Sorrentino's script crackles with prescience and insight making the interplay between Caine and Keitel exactly what you would expect from two consummate professionals who seem excited by the material and the story. What you may not expect from a film of this type is the hard scatological bent to the language and a broader cast that is as comfortable in their clothes as out of them. However, far from being gratuitous both elements propel the story forward even in several places where the film's two hour plus run time seems a bit long.

Finally, a standing ovation to cinematographer Luca Bigazzi who creates a metaphysical dreamscape from the already magical and beatific surroundings. Even if the rest of the film had been horrible (it isn't), his artistry and breathtaking visualizations would make the entire endeavor worthy of your time and attention. Youth is a great and important film that died of marketing malpractice - despite it's premature demise, it is a pleasure in every sense of the word.",1476748800,3,3196,5.045454545454546

The writing and characters, the visual poetry, the music, the cinematography all converge in a very unique way to create one of the best films I have seen in a very long time.",1476662400,,537,4.489795918367347

This could have been an interesting movie if it was not trying to hard to be an artistic film. I normally like artsy films, but I need them to tell a story. The acting was good for what the actors had to work with.

Unless you really just like to watch artistically filmed scenes with very little plot, meaningful dialog or story line I can not recommend this.

There is an interesting mix of characters and it all seems to work well. While so many other movies depend on action, violence, and special effects to redeem the weaknesses of the movie, this movie depends solely on the character play and I enjoyed it immensely.

7470798,5,B016E66ZHU,"This film by Paolo Sorrentino would seem to be a proper extension from his award winning The Great Beauty from 2013.  He continues to explore men easing in to retirement and looking back on their life.  Sometimes fondly but often with regret, missed opportunities and loneliness.  Sorrentino seems to have great admiration for filmmaker Federico Fellini.  While The Great Beauty portends La Dolce Vita in many respects, similarities to Fellinis 8  seem unmistakable here.

Michael Caine is excellent as Fred Ballinger, a retired composer and orchestra conductor.  His longtime friend Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) is an American film director and screenwriter.  Both are in a luxurious spa/resort in the Swiss Alps for a holiday.  Fred, just relaxing with his daughter, Lena (Rachel Weisz) who is also his personal assistant.  Mick is collaborating with a few actors and screenwriters for his next movie.  As is turns out Micks son, Julian (Ed Stoppard) is married to Lena, but their marriage isn't a healthy one, not that either father had a clue.  Paul Dano plays an American actor named Jimmy Tree who thinks of himself as a serious actor but is best known for his role as a robot in a blockbuster film.  And he cant shake the connection.

Fred is approached by a staffer of Queen Elizabeth at the hotel.  The Queen wants Fred to come out of retirement and conduct his most famous work called Simple Songs which is a favorite of Prince Philip.  Fred turns down the request, insisting he has personal reasons for not doing the piece.  Later in the film when the Queens lackey makes another attempt, we find out what those reasons are, much to everyones surprise, including daughter Lena.  It is emotional and Caines delivery is beautiful.

Sorrentinos earlier film had moments of lightheartedness and fantasy and so it is here.  Freds daily massages are given by a young woman (Luna Mijovic) with braces on her teeth.  There is nothing sexual but her hands seem to be a magic elixir.  We see the woman during her off hours exercising/dancing to some program on television.  I didn't get it, but perhaps I shouldnt.  There are a couple of other characters worth mentioning.  One is Jane Fonda who shows up late in the film, for little more than one scene with Harvey Keitel.  She plays his longtime muse and the star of his film about to be shot.  And then there is Miss Universe, played by Madalina Ghenea.  She has one scene where she joins Fred and Mick in the pool and it has forever seared a memory in my brain.

Admittedly the film has more style than real substance, but the beauty of the film is hard to dismiss.  Not only for its visuals which are stunning both at the hotel and surrounds, and the natural environment in which it is setbut then there is the music.  The first thing I did after watching the film was to order the soundtrack.  There are actually two.  One features the songs in the movies and include a combination of David Langs original compositions, and pop-rock songs by David Byrne and Paloma Faith (who also plays the role of Julians new girlfriend.) The second album is a 2-disc set that has more of the same and includes 2 additional songs. Unfortunately the big beat rocker ""Neckbrace"" is missing from both albums.  Perhaps the most stunning song however closes out the film.  It is Simple Song #3 performed by opera singer Sumi jo, as Fred relents to direct the piece for the Queen and Prince.  The film is a winner.  Highly recommended.

It is also a winner on Blu ray which is also highly recommended.  It comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.38:1 aspect ratio.  As mentioned above, the film has a natural palette of colors and they are displayed perfectly.  Yes the film has some plenty of detailed older bodies, but remember Miss Universe.  The audio comes with an equally impressive DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track.  Not knowing a lot about the movie, I remember asking myself why would they put this movie with a 7.1 audio track?  Yeah, now I know why.  The film has some subtle but effective environmental elements that pop up in the surrounds on occasion.  I was impressed.  Subtitles are available in French, Spanish and English SDH.  There are 5 short promo featurettes with Caine, Sorrentino and others.  There is a gallery (auto advanced for 2 minutes total) and a trailer.",1467072000,6,4322,4.713903743315508

7470815,5,B016E66ZHU,"The reviews of this film in The New York Times and The Guardian were negative, filled with adjectives like empty, boring, small, macho-geriatric, and sexist. For me this is conclusive proof of the ineptitude of critics, if anyone still needed that.
Among the many things the reviewers missed was one of the finest performances of Michael Caines career. And that alone would make it a very memorable film.
And although critics have noticed Sorrentinos debt to Fellini, they seem to have missed his affinity with Robert Altmans work in films like Short Cuts and Nashville.
But there is much more here than that. The reviews compare the film unfavorably with Sorrentinos previous one, The Great Beauty. I enjoyed that film, but there is little wisdom to be gained from observing the vast wasteland that is the life of the main character, Jep Gambardella. Like Marcello Rubini in Fellinis Dolce Vita, he has simply wasted his life. So the lesson is simple: Dont waste your life  or, in the worst case, you may end up as a casualty like Steiner or Ramona. The two central characters of Youth are old men like Gambardella, and Sorrentino leaves us in no doubt that they have sown plenty of wild oats, but there is much more to their lives than that: unlike Gambardella, they have been husbands and fathers, and the film is full of reflections on what it means to be a husband and a father.
For me, it is particularly revealing lack of insight that the reviewers missed the theme of fatherhood in the film, and everything that the film has to say about it. I suspect they were also too uninsightful and unreflective to piece together the story of learning to ride a bike that is scattered throughout the film, in Caines remark about how everyone falls off when they suddenly feel so happy about realizing they are able to do it that they then forget to brake, in Harvey Keitels late-night walk, holding hands, with a prostitute, and Caines final conversation with the doctor about Keitels Gilda Black story. This is one of the many gems waiting in this film, slightly hidden  if you know how to look for them.
A film to watch more than once.",1465084800,,2134,4.657824933687003

7470819,5,B016E66ZHU,"Italian writer/director Paolo Sorrentino (Il Divo, The Great Beauty, This Must Be the Place, etc) is known for his wispy, experimental films in which he dissects the concepts of love, beauty, meaning, significance, art and the manner in which they interact and influence each other. One line (of many great lines) from the movie sums up the message of YOUTH: I want to tell about your desire, my desire. So pure, so impossible, so immoral. But it doesn't matter because that's what makes us alive. Filmed in the grandeur of the Swiss Alps, the cinematography by Luca Bigazzi and especially the musical score by David Lang add to the mesmerizing theme of age  youth being attainable only to the dreamers and the young of heart.

A retired orchestra conductor/composer Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) is on holiday with his daughter Lena (Rachael Weisz) and his film director best friend Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) in the Alps when he receives a visit from an Emissary (Alex Macqueen) from Queen Elizabeth II who invites him to perform his Simple Songs at the request of Queen Elizabeth II to perform for Prince Philip's birthday. Fred refuses  he is retired and there are personal reasons for not wanting the Simple Songs performed (one of the many threads that weave the mystery of aging and memory). Mick, on the other hand, is busy writing his testament  his magnum opus of a film, aided by a strange claque of young writers: the films production depends on Micks old friend Brenda Morel (Jane Fonda) starring in the major role. It is the interaction of these two aging artists, observed closely by an actor Jimmy Tree (Paul Dano), and their dissolving into the beauty of the alps scenery that brings surprises an a satisfying conclusion to this daydream of a film

The acting is excellent, the pacing is slow (like aging) and the musical score is stunning. This is a film that appeals to the intellect as well as the eye and is such a refreshing respite from the clangor of the current films before us today. Relax into this dream state and feel refreshed.

Harvey Keitel does a journeyman's job, and Michael Caine is brilliant as ever.
The script sometimes misfires, but is, on the whole quirky AND romantic. And loving (toward its characters and its camera subjects).
There is even a bit of fantasy in the story -- about midway through; it happens quickly, so one must pay attention -- and the cinematography is brilliant!

This one reminded me of both Wes Anderson and Woody Allen.

7470856,5,B016E66ZHU,"In my view, this movie is a wonderfully crafted piece of art. Of course, not everyone will think so, because not everyone has fine and sensible taste. It's a movie that's made more for the trained eye. The eye and mind that's been trained to read into things, see messages that are being sent out. Many people watch movies because of the entertainment they provide, leaving out anything else that implies knowledge, recognition, art, information...

All this said, I've thought just a few movies are what I would describe as majestic. Among them are: Tree of Life; Interstellar... after the last one, I've liked movies but hadn't found another mind-blowing wonder, like Youth.

I absolutely recommend it. I don't want to spoil it, so I'll just leave it at this: Youth is an orchestra, in itself.

We wondered if this was a movie that young people could watch and love. I, as a working 75 year old artist, loved it. My wife, as the wife of an artist who's life was and is dominated by art, also loved it. I think one needs a certain amount of life experience to appreciate the depth of this film but one who is sensitive to the possibilities in life can appreciate it at many levels.

7470859,5,B016E66ZHU,"I originally viewed this film last fall at the Philadelphia Film Festival. I thought it would be difficult to follow up ""The Great Beauty"" with a film equal to  Sorrentino's earlier almost surrealist masterpiece. I was wrong. What most impressed me was not simply the acting by Michael Caine and Harvy Keitel but the wonderful Cinematography and great musical score. Nowadays cudo's are given to films that spend hundreds of millions of dollars on tech. The Academy overlooks films that are shot beautifully. Youth has a near Bergmanesque shooting style. There are wonderful well composed scenes, great photography perspective and just a beautiful sense of film and what a scene should look like. This is not a film for everyone there is  no action, no CGI, just a beautifully constructed slice of life film about a long term friendship and growth. For some, this may seem like watching paint dry but for those who love the finer aspects of Cinema it will not disappoint. Paulo Sorrentino's is on to something, he has developed into a filmmaker that has established his own style, he does not play by the rules, he takes risks especially in the subject matter he covers. I found ""Youth"" to be a layered and deep spiritual film. The acting superb, the characters interesting and again the Cinematograpy beautiful. Several of the scenes are so wonderfully shot that are unforgettable. I recently purchased the Blu Ray of ""Youth"" to revisit the film and share it with others. It is certainly one of my favorites from the 2015 crop of releases.",1459728000,,1540,4.874045801526718

7470862,4,B016E66ZHU,"The film centers around 80 something composer/conductor Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine). He is at an Alps resort spa with his daughter Lena (Rachel Weisz) and long time friend and director Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel). Fred is retired and has refused to conduct for the Queen. Mick is with a group of writers as they are attempting to come up with a script for ""Life's Last Day"" and spend their time attempting to compose final death bed endings for the film. There are a number of minor subplots and players at the resort so you can create whatever theme or metaphor you desire for the film.

The film was very artsy and theme driven. It appeared to focus on dreams and desires which are best left to youth, but I am sure one could get the opposite meaning. The film has a lot of good lines that appear that they tie things together, but then fall short.

""I have to believe everything to make things up.""
""Human beings know how to be pathetic when they try.""
""Emotions are overrated"" contradicted by ""Emotions is all we have.""
""I know you can't levitate.""

Rachel Weisz has a soliloquy where she nails it, but I wasn't sure what she nailed. Paloma Faith plays herself as an oversexed pop star. Madalina Diana Ghenea gets naked, which seems to be an odd sell point for an artsy film, but then again so did Michael Caine, and now I am blind.

One thing I can say for certain is this is not a formula film. It is a series of scenes, many of which are isolated with no real connection to the main plot.

People come to the spa to find themselves, realize their desires, and maybe make their dreams come true...like a fountain of youth. Although I was hoping for more. Oh did I mention Madalina Diana Ghenea gets naked. 3 1/2 STARS",1459641600,2,1725,4.429022082018927

I am glad I watched it, it was thought provoking, and reminded those of us past 60 that life is what we make of it.",1456876800,2,250,4.081632653061225

7470936,5,B016E66ZHU,"The film was absolutely visually incredible and a rare intellectual film in terms of writing, directing, and the acting in the film. It was very deep as a story and was full of absolute genius in terms of the directing and the acting. This film was so magical in how it was so heartfelt that it must be one of the best films of the decade. It is a shame it did not get more awards because it was so beautiful, meaningful, and very humorous. I will admire the film makers of this film for a long time, and I think that it was one of the best films for the lead actors in terms of a film's overall artistic value. I love this movie and cannot say enough for the film's rating and could give it many more stars.",1456876800,25,708,4.064285714285714
7470937,5,B016E66ZHU,"One thing people aren't mentioning here is the wit of the film. It's very funny. There is a bit of a sendup of Fellini spa scenes (8 1/2), and a Thomas Mann Magic Mountain riff. The cameo scene with Jane Fonda and Harvey Keitel is a gem of Hollywood mockery. The ""entertainment"" provided to the spa guests is so bad and random you can't help laughing if you think about what you're actually seeing. People have noted the beautiful scenery, but there is a way in which the beautiful scenery is sweetly hilarious too, since the director so often sets random characters doing amazing things in the middle of it: the masseuse dancing, the obese former soccer star kicking tennis balls high into the air, and a chorus of movie stars the Keitel character has launched--all in terribly ridiculous trite roles. A perfect film with actors at the top of the game, tender satire, full of visual conundrums that parody Fellini at his best. There are no men in tights.",1456790400,6,955,4.623529411764705
7470938,5,B016E66ZHU,Just stunning.  Michael Caine is one of my favorite actors and he delivers a splendid and emotional performance in this film.  NOT a mainstream flick!  Saw it for the first time tonight and want to watch it again.,1456704000,,213,4.552631578947368
7470939,2,B016E66ZHU,"A wordy reflection on getting old.  Beautiful babes, partially dressed, some not dressed at all, come and go.  The old guys take notice.

We rented this because we admire the two stars, Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel.  And it did have its moments.  But generally, it just went on and on, and made facing old age a dreary prospect.",1456704000,2,331,4.5423728813559325
7470940,1,B016E66ZHU,"This is an imaginative film: superb acting, directing, cinematography, cleverly written BUT ABSOLUTELY RUINED BY THE CHOICE OF MUSIC...inappropriate, distracts from everything else, intrudes instead of supports. Ugh!",1456704000,,216,6.75
7470941,5,B016E66ZHU,"Great movie about the reality of aging. You are as young as you want to be. We have to be mature, but we never have to grow up!!!",1456617600,3,129,3.642857142857143

7470945,5,B016E66ZHU,"Ignore the negative reviews. A masterclass in acting, striking cinematography, and an abstract, almost surreal film about the journey away from youth. See it.",1456617600,10,158,5.625

7470947,1,B016E66ZHU,"I would give this zero stars if I could. Empty. Awful.  Boring. Slow moving. I thought this would have some profound thoughts about life, growing old after a distinguished career, etc - with good music at least.  Not! The only thing decent was the lush scenery. The characters were all superficial and selfish and EMPTY shells. If there was a message it seemed to be, ""life is empty and you won't remember any of it when you get old anyway.""",1456531200,5,441,4.5

8736368,5,B016E66ZHU,I loved this movie. The cinematography and backdrop is stunning and added Switzerland to my travel bucket list. The acting was top notch by all. Overall it is a study on aging and how we and our circumstances change and the beauty and challenge of it.  Circumstances change we can take some time to look at it and feel the feelings of it but in the end we have to adapt to survive and thrive.  There are so many poignant scenes that really make you think and enough humor mixed in.  GREAT film.,1533168000,,494,4.290322580645161

Powerful, pitch perfect acting by Michael Caine, Rachel Weiss, Paul Dano, Harvey Kietel and a great Script , Directing and Cinematography ...Musical score and costume design!

8736372,4,B016E66ZHU,"Much of the dialogue in this film feels rather clunky and obvious.  Same goes for some character development, and other dynamics between characters.  However, Sorrentino crafts wonderful picture images throughout the film.  He really shines as a director when there is no dialogue, when the images and the music work an alchemy that at times is rapturously effective.  If you can forgive the elements that fail here, Youth can deliver an ineffable, momentous power.",1526774400,,465,5.243243243243243
