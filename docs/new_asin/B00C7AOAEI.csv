5692600,1,B00C7AOAEI,"I was really disappointed with this series and especially with the ending. It leaves you hanging and the series won't be continued until 2014. I probably won't watch it again. The acting was overly dramatic yet did not have the drama effect expected, in some cases it was ludicrous when it was meant to be serious. DaVinci's character was poorly played but somewhat better than the others. What really disillusioned me about the series was the continuous mysteries with no answers at all. A few tidbits to understand the enigmas would have been welcome.

Some episodes had nudity but it was done simply for effect and was unnecessary and sometimes vulgar. It seriously distracted from the story. Same for the swearing, done for effect but again distracts from the story. And both were inconsistent throughout the episodes. Had there been none of either, the focus would have remained on the story but my guess is the author thought the story too weak to survive without nudity and swearing.

I also was hoping for an adaptation closer to actual history but not even close. The only aspects that resembles history are the names and the architecture. One episode where DaVinci meets Dracula had me laughing at the ludicrousness of this. It was as though the author could not make up his mind on where the story lines should go, have them resemble history? Have the stories mock history or have the stories spoof history? The inconsistency was throughout the series, in once instance it appears the story will attempt to follow history then the next it is like science fiction. It would have been much better to stick to one premise rather than be erratic.

Were there any positives? To me, none that I recall. Overall the series was poorly and overly dramatically acted, the story lines were inconsistent and erratic. The fundamental premise that truth is being denied is never proven, never shown and unsupported. A few morsels of proof to solidify the premise would have made the series more believable but it just remained conjecture.

If you are looking for a disjointed non-historical, fictional account of DaVinci and that era with nudity and swearing then you might like this series. If you prefer that it be closer to actual history, not have gratuitous nudity and swearing and be consistent in its approach, then you will probably not like this series.",1370563200,22,2359,4.875311720698255
5692601,4,B00C7AOAEI,"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:

The ""beard"" referring to Lucrezia Donati and her gay husband!

4* may be generous, though the history is interesting.  Particularly the conflict between Rome (clearly a Papal city) and Florence.  Not being an expert on Italian Renaissance politics and having only a working knowledge of Da Vinci, added to my enjoyment.  For example, I was not aware that Da Vinci was an accomplished swordsman (literally, as well as figuratively).

Laura Jane Haddock (AKA Allison from ""The Inbetweeners Movie"") gives a credible performance as Lucrezia Donati, lover to both Lorenzo Medici and Da Vinci and spy for Rome.

All of the other performances are OK, as is the storyline.  OK is probably the best descriptor that I can offer.  The series it not unpleasant to watch, though there is little to compel thought when it is over.  Take away the MA-13 and I doubt that the production value would be compelling enough for me to watch at all.  YMMV",1368144000,3,954,4.863354037267081
5692602,5,B00C7AOAEI,"Witty, fast paced, riddled with riddles and very clever.
Not as grim as ""Game of Thrones"": it actually reminds me of ""Shakespeare in love"" sometimes, but in a good way.
Don't expect ""History Channel's"" accuracy - this is entertainment around Da Vinci's life and achievements. No more, no less.
Still, I just can't stress how deep and clever this series manages to be.
Expect nudity, erotic moments, gay relationships and violence - a formula Starz is very familiar with (at least) since Spartacus.",1367971200,88,497,5.0
5692603,5,B00C7AOAEI,"If that's not enough to get you interested the mix of history and fiction is excellent.  The use of da Vinci's drawings add to the visual representation.

Word of warning: I recommended this to a coworker who also likes GoT and TrueBlood and he (and his wife) were really turned off by the homosexual plot lines.  For others it may be a selling point.  For historians it simply happened.

Hopefully the set will include a making of 30 min that aired on British TV, it adds some background and perspective (two things da Vinci would have appreciated).  One thing David Goyer noted was an intetional choice to cast British actors who American's may not be as familiar with.",1366675200,75,671,4.6440677966101696
5692604,5,B00C7AOAEI,"And so another extended series based on historical data begins and oddly enough the other series set in the same time frame, THE BORGIAS, is similar to the decadent feeling established by the first episode of DA VINCI'S DEMONS. The writers and directors of this series of eight episodes vary from week to week and so we may have a different opinion with each passing episode. Is the series worth watching? It seems so, if the antics that occur in episode 1 are indicative of the direction.

After a rather hilarious opening with the fully nude Hugh Bonneville and his male consort preparing to face a new day worried about bowels and other matters - a brief setting as Bonnevile is instantly murdered - we move into Renaissance Florence where the 25 year old artist/engineer/wizard genius Leonardo Da Vinci (Tom Riley) is working on yet another amazing use of flight with his friends Nico (Eros Vlahos) and Zoroaster (Gregg Chillin) and the amiable Verrocchio (Alan Corduner). The young Da Vinci is a lover (with the Medici mistress Lucrezia played by Laura Haddock) because of his talents at portraiture and cunning, an idealist who believes anything is possible if you just think of it. He mixes with the court of the Medicis (Elliot Cowan is Lorenzo) and struggles with his sense of dark demons brought into focus by his visit with Al-Rahim (Alexander Siddig), and is always cognizant of the fact that he is tortured by `a gift of superhuman genius, a heretic intent on exposing the lies of religion, an insurgent seeking to subvert an elitist society, a bastard son who yearns for legitimacy with his father. He finds himself in the midst of a storm that has been brewing for centuries - a conflict between truth and lies, religion and reason, past and future. His aspirations are used against him by the opposing forces of the time-luring him into a game of seduction where those who despise his intellect need him most. Leonardo must take up the fight against foes who use history to suppress the truth. A hero armed only with genius, Da Vinci stands alone against the darkness within, and the darkness without. Facing an uncertain future, his quest for knowledge nearly becomes his undoing as he explores the fringes of his own sanity. Da Vinci throws himself into his genius and emerges as an unstoppable force that lifts an entire era out of darkness and propels it into light. His story becomes a mirror into our own world, calling us all to join his fight to Free the Future.' This latter portion is provided by the PR for the series.

The scenery is magnificent, the drawings of Da Vinci come wonderfully to life through this episode, and the innumerable subplots are at times hinted and at other times well started.  It seems as though all this will work for at least 8 episodes! Grady Harp, April 13",1365897600,76,2813,4.725050916496945
5692605,5,B00C7AOAEI,"Possessing neither cable television nor, in fact, a television, I was still able to catch the premiere episode for free on Starz's website.  Unfortunately I won't be able to see anymore until the Blu-ray is released.  Even so, I was able to summon enough of an opinion from several viewings of the first episode to form a sufficient review, which I shall surely update once I've watched the entire season.  For the moment I can write that, initially at least, Da Vinci's Demons is utterly, shockingly, delightfully absorbing.  As a historical fantasy set in Renaissance Italy it is roughly contemporaneous with Showtime's The Borgias, which would seem to make one robust competition for the other.  Rather to my surprise, the debut series puts The Borgias to shame.  This has less to do with differences in budget--while I cannot know which show has the greater and which the lesser, I suspect The Borgias is slightly ahead of Da Vinci's Demons--and more to do with the quality of the scripts.  For all its sumptuous production value The Borgias suffers from writing which, while competent, is decidedly unremarkable, consisting of very spare dialogue which too often the actors, by attempting to make the most of it, stretch painfully thin.  Not so with Da Vinci's Demons.  Here is abundance, exuberance, and wit.  Repartee is fast-paced and charming.  Gravitas is measured without sounding inflated.  The appearance of the dire phrase, ""Believe in yourself,"" was enough to disrupt the harmony.  But, that being the only false note, the writing was, to my ear, uniformly excellent.  And there was nothing in the production which failed to captivate.

These are my impressions, gathered as they are from a mere taste.  And yet, for me, that taste is definitive.",1365897600,20,1761,5.020689655172414

5692607,1,B00C7AOAEI,"it really should be a crime to so utterly falsify a historical figure's life story, and use him as a mere tool for some rather occult and degenerate imaginary fictions. At the least, the series should have a disclaimer stating that it is FICTION. Just in case someone mistakes it for something more than that.",1515888000,,309,4.636363636363637
5692608,1,B00C7AOAEI,Utter garbage. Nothing of the genius of Leonardo is on display here. It's typical made-for-TV nonsense that reduces da Vinci to some kind of rock-'n-roll rebel. When will he set fire to his lute??!!,1510790400,,198,4.852941176470588
5692609,1,B00C7AOAEI,"Let's see.  Within the first 5 minutes of the film, you get to see Hugh Bonneville in the full nude peeing into a large pot.  Then, he walks over to a young boy in his bed and tells him to leave.  When the naked youth gets out of bed with a dumb, but sensual look, Hugh smacks his naked butt and repeats his demand that he leave.  As the young man scampers away, we see Bonneville throw money after him.  Two minutes have passed in this series.  The Bonneville character shows up at some palace and a guy from some weird black secret society stabs him in the neck, squirting blood everywhere.  Another minute has gone by.  Next scene:  Pope Sixtus IV, played by James Faulkner, is naked in a swimming pool cradling the head of a young teen boy (also naked).  Indeed, the boy is sitting on the Pope's lap in the pool.  To make the scene even more bizarre, the Pope has a knife to the boy's throat and is asking him, ""Are you afraid?""  when the boy says no, he presses the knife closer and says, ""Now, that is a lie.  You do want to go to heaven, don't you?""  The kid says he is afraid.  The Pope then says, ""That's a lie too, isn't it?""  Then, men burst into the bath....5 minutes have passed.  I do hope you can see the reason for the one star.  Even if we weren't speaking about the morality of these first 5 minutes, I have to ask you:  who wants to see a grown man's butt while he pees into a jar?  And why must these types of series rely so heavily on sensationalism?  Can it be that there is no actual plot involved?  People aren't stupid and yet, these types of shows treat us that way.  People want plot, action, emotion, drama, meaning, and ultimately want some kind of truth.  About anything, but most especially the human condition.  Who are we?  Why do we exist?  What do we seek?  It is achievable?  Why is there evil?  Who wins: evil or good?  When a series begins this way, you can bet that the makers are aiming at the lowest common denominator in our society.  If you have a brain and love good cinema, don't waste your life.  So many other movies to watch....",1506816000,6,2076,4.201017811704834

5692612,4,B00C7AOAEI,"Great fun, so long as no one mistakes the series protagonist, ""Leonardo da Vinci"" for the historical figure of the same name. There is no evidence that the historical da Vinci was a drug addled mystic accessing higher realms with the pipe.  That's the conceit of this show.  Regrettably, if the show becomes as popular as I suspect it will, within a few years it will widely be believed that the real Leonardo was as described here.  We've become a society that is addicted to conspiracy, mysticism and secret knowledge.  So, doubtless we will translate the figure of Leonardo da Vinci, a man devoted to reason and knowledge gained through observation and experimentation, into another gnostic figurine compatible with our fantasies and addiction.

As to the shows acting, sets and costuming, they are all substantial.  There is a quality of unreality to the larger scenes of early Renaissance Florence.  I suspect this is intentional to help set the mood.  Nonetheless, I find it distracting.  The hard edges of the city, the pain and suffering of ordinary people seems somehow blunted in the imaginary of this show's producers.  The reality of life during the Renaissance was filled with toil, pain and such suffering as to be almost unimaginable today, even in the great cities of Florence, Venice and Rome.  Imagine, if you will, life before the invention of aspirin, Tylenol or any affective pain relief.  Opiates were known, but rare and almost completely unavailable.  Think of the toothache or headache that cannot be relieved.  Think of the allergy untreated.  Think of infections that cannot be cured.  A minor wound from knife or sword cut through unbathed skin is often fatal  tetany and sepsis are common modes of death.

Ordinary life was, by today's standards, extraordinarily hard. Most people worked from dawn to dusk, and slept away the night.  To produce a candle took enormous labour, tending beehives, collecting wax etc. Thus they were very expensive, and often beyond the means of ordinary folk.  Most  people could not afford them.  Instead they used a few flickering oil lamps, or simply slept through the dark. Think of the labour that goes into making a loaf of bread  growing the grain without tractors or milling devices turn the grain to flour, kneading loaf after loaf, maintaining the wood fire ovens with wood felled by axe, and dragged by oxen out of the forest, cut to size and hauled miles to the city in a cart pulled by mules. Common all people could not afford ovens, but rather paid to share in the communal oven or for baker to make their loaf.

The Renaissance was a glorious time in human history, a time when intellect  and exploration of the physical world gave new meaning to life.  But, it was also a time of great labour and great suffering.  This show, with its concentration on the politics of the upper class fails to show the scope of real life those times.  I suppose it's easier to portray the schemes of a dozen characters than the  labour and suffering of thousands.",1500508800,4,3022,4.824902723735408

5692646,5,B00C7AOAEI,"Synopsis:
Set in Renaissance Florence, this follows the life and adventures of a young Leonardo Da Vinci as he defends his beloved Florence and the De Medici family from the intrigues of Rome.

What the series may remind you of:
- I find this show most similar to the Robert Downey Sherlock Holmes movies in that it follows a genius trying to solve mysteries... but instead of the mysteries being murder and theft, it is the mysteries of science. But don't think that the science is too academic - he is usually trying to deal with some sort of political or romantic intrigue. He also has to get out of scrapes by coming up with Macgyver like inventions.
- It is also a bit like the film Shakespeare in Love in terms of the style of the main character, Da Vinci. He also reminds me a bit of Ichabod Crane from Sleepy Hollow
- It is a very tiny bit like Game of Thrones in that there are plenty of political power plays in an early Renaissance setting (close to Medieval) and some significant violence and nudity, although not nearly as severe as Game of Thrones

Positives:
Where do I begin? -The writing, the plots, the characters are all so awesome. The actors are all very good, although the female lead is too similar to Angelina Jolie.

Negatives:
I doubt the history is accurate. But I love it just the same.

Conclusion:
Watch it - you can't go wrong!

Important:
When you watch the first episode, they made a bad decision to make the first few minutes surreal. Most of the series is not like that. Get past the first two minutes and watch the entire first episode, and you will be completely engrossed!",1480291200,3,1610,4.462585034013605

From the beginning to the end, the storyline of Da Vinci's Demon's perpetually develops and sustains more villain's than anything else I've viewed. Just when you think the Bad Guys have reached critical mass, another Bad Guy pops up and is far more surely than the previously introduced. Not another cheap, poorly produced film comes a close to Da Vinci's Demons, rank curt with such a thick competition of demons, villians and outright bad guys and chicks...Good luck to anyone who chooses to sustain any vision of a better world, and people who have the moral compass.",1473984000,2,711,4.836065573770492

5692724,1,B00C7AOAEI,"Terrible. My first complaint is that the actor who has been cast for da Vinci is a horrible choice. At best, he is a handsome model, but his own character does not reflect the profundity of ingenuity and intelligence that was Leonardo da Vinci. During moments in this show, his style of acting reminded me of a soft core porn star. In fact, the entire series has a laxidasical attitude towards the serious nature of the time as well as da Vinci's personality. Da Vinici was a homosexual. This man is not. Da Vinci was not very attractive, as is this actor.

My second complaint: The mysteries this drama (if that's the word I can use) are corny at best. It mixes in hermetic and other esoteric doctrines, but mangles them all together... In short, this series, to me at least, is unwatchable. I stopped several episodes into it and sold it to FYE.

Sad, since I typically love most of Starz costume dramas. Spartacus, for instance, was really fantastic.",1465516800,,953,4.6
5692725,4,B00C7AOAEI,I actually rank this 3.5.  It is pretty good but not enough for me to run out and immediately buy Season 2.  The acting is good and story line decent but I am not 100 percent that they could have chosen a different lead character - DaVinci.,1465430400,,240,4.085106382978723

The effects used to show how the devices work, and DaVinci's mind works add to the theme of the show.  Some lesser known names there that need bigger roles in other productions.  Even the bad guys are well played and complex.

Oh, and this being Starz, lots of nudity and fan service, so don't let your kids watch it, or use it for history.",1465257600,,459,4.2298850574712645

5692744,4,B00C7AOAEI,"I'm really enjoying this series.  It really humanizes someone that, if you've studied DaVinci at all, you thought was an isolated hyper-genius.  This series shows him as a social being that attempts to use his genius for the good of the masses.  If you look closely, it might seem that the series is trying to portray Da Vinci as someone afflicted with Asberger Disorder.  Very interesting.  I will continue to follow this series with extreme interest.",1463788800,,452,4.894736842105263
5692745,3,B00C7AOAEI,"There should have been more of da Vinci actually working instead of screwing around and running from people he'd ticked off.  For example, the first couple of episodes were good set-up: ambidexterity, the setting of Italian politics at the time, the inventions/art, but then it faltered and became a blase series of sexual encounters and evil religion, which has been done to death.  The costumes were fairly well-done in the beginning but then tapered into girls wearing modern sundresses.",1463788800,2,490,5.189873417721519

5692747,1,B00C7AOAEI,"I was expecting something more dramatic/ serious/ authentic- depicting Leonardo DaVinci. The staging, look and feel are intentionally phony and incongruous with the period. The words that come to mind to describe it are ""jaunty cheesy"". The performance of the actor portraying Da Vinci reminded me more of a modern day David Copperfield- nothing remotely approaching an authentic interpretation. Garish, artificial colors, crisp clean, clothes, perfect hair and make-up are so at odds with time period (the tail end of the middle ages just entering the Renaissance) that I found it hard to watch. It was akin to watching the depiction of an artist/inventor from the 16th century being portrayed by 1980's version of Bon Jovi (aka giant hair and black spandex).",1463616000,3,760,5.237704918032787

The attention to physical detail is as charming as the disregard for any kind of reality.  Overnight, it seems, the most outrageous inventions take shape due to the efforts of barely acknowledged studio ""helpers"".  Santa's elves could take lessons.  Still, it's fun.

There is a good deal of very realistic use of the gore of injuries and the brutal and ignorant methods of healing in former times. Rather remarkable special effects, to say the least.

5692809,5,B00C7AOAEI,"I cannot recommend this highly enough. I see some criticisms in regard to historically. I'd say if you wish to know more about DaVinci watch a documentary! This session introduces us to the man and his art. He is a patron of the Medici's in Florence - Italy was a conglomeration of countries at this time. The various families ruled their area with a degree of fear and the Medici's use DaVinci's intellect in designing war machines-rotating cannon and bombs. He receives commissions that he does not always finish! We see the city of Florence and meet its many characters. The underlying theme is that Leo (as he is called by his friends) has an ability to remember (and draw) anything he's ever seen-but can't recall his mother. His quest to find her leads him to a mystic/magician who tells him if he can find the Book of Leaves all will be revealed. Said book is supposed to reveal many mysteries - and Leo is always in search of knowledge. I especially enjoyed how we can ""see"" what Leo is thinking - as he imagines designs/paintings the images appear on the screen as if he is drawing it for you. I knew DaVinci was a master of different arts but had no idea just how much (and that part is historically correct!). The costumes, the music, all the actors are wonderful. Yes there's a fair amount of sex and violence and the series touches on Leo's homosexuality in involving a court case where he is charged with sodomy (though said individual was a prostitute - Leo's sexuality is a matter of public record - he was charged with sodomy and rather disappeared for some time in real life). So if that type of sex scene or gore is objectionable to you-this show is NOT for you! Otherwise, it's a delicious feast",1457395200,2,1715,4.517684887459807
5692810,5,B00C7AOAEI,"For those who wish to delve deeper into this alternate vision of Da Vinci, check out Martin Woodhouse's literary Medici trilogy, The Medici guns, The Medici Emerald, and The Medici Hawk. Reading the descriptions of these books, it's apparent that they were the blueprints for seasons 1-3.
It's a shame that the series gives no credit to this man's work. I realize that no one owns history, but both of these works are more in the realm of alternative history. I thoroughly loved the TV series. I just feel that a small shout out could have been given to this man's vision.",1457308800,,572,4.617647058823529
5692811,4,B00C7AOAEI,"seemed to be ignored like such nuisances as beggars, starvation, and streets overflowing with costume ruining filth, but an otherwise laggard education gave me plenty of coin necessary to buy into a grand suspension of disbelief. Initially hesitant, forgetting how little accuracy is involved in entertainment,  this has become another series of interesting if far fetched postulation, history, and cinematography that to me captures something ineffable, making it necessary viewing.
But I am still looking for someone other than Neal Stephenson who has addressed in print or film how supposedly rampant syphilis in the dawn of medicine didn't depopulate such a randy segment of society. Then again, perhaps well endowed, erudite, fully dentrificed, alpha males who perpetually seem to be humming ""Whang Dang Sweet Poontang"" was never fully realized for that very reason and human history is millenia behind due to that pesky spirochete.",1457222400,,937,5.506944444444445

5692821,5,B00C7AOAEI,"I do not usually review movies , books, or anything at all. However, I loved this series. I understand that after 3 seasons it was cancelled....very well. Here is my review: I love the characters,well defined with room to grow. DaVinci was not one of these overly manly man heroes and not one of these overly in touch with their inner-self, oh-woe-is-me characters. For a change, whomever came up with it, we were not watching a series or a movie that we already knew the end of, but one that was new and interesting. And funny!!! So they may not have been historically accurate, but that's why it is called historic fiction. I don't care that Machiavelli should have been only nine years at the time. I thought it was a stroke of genius to throw him in the mix. It was a great series unlike Spartacus, the brute force without intelligence series. No wonder the porn industries are loosing business.
Back to DaVinci... I loved the series, I will watch it again, and if there does exist a book of this series...I will read it.",1453161600,,1025,4.516129032258065

Within a matter of one episode I was very interested in how the story was to continue.  I found myself thinking about the characters and worrying over their fate.  Leonardo da Vinci is of course a central character but a lot of the characters around him are very complex and intense.  This is a show that I definitely recommend and will probably watch again myself.,1435276800,,467,4.333333333333333
5692840,5,B00C7AOAEI,"I can't believe how good this show is.  I just re-watched season 1, followed by season 2.  So very good, and season 2 was even more adventurous.
Part Macgyver, part Indiana Jones, with other elements that don't fit into easy categories.  Occasional steam-punk feel (the cool inventions and contraptions he comes up with).  Some truly beautiful locations as well.  Not likely to be completely historically accurate, but thematically I would say it's close. Easily among the top 5 tv series running today.

5692852,5,B00C7AOAEI,"LOVE.  There is so much beauty in the presentation of Da Vinci's thought processes.  They use some artistic methods to convey his mind in action- as a mechanism of storytelling, it's ground-breaking and succinct.  I kind of love everything about this show.  It's rare to see a handsome genius as the main character- and Tom Riley plays one that doesn't just sit there, all docile and weak in a lab coat or lethargic in a chair- DaVinci's character is a total badass swordsman as well.  If you like the Doctor (Doctor Who), Da Vinci is not far off from him- down to the little tweaky gestures and movements he busts out while coming up with a plan.
I love all of the characters, the actors, the plot, everything.  And I've never loved an anti-hero more- Blake Ritson plays Count Riario, and he's a wonderful reflection and ambitious counterpart.

5692857,1,B00C7AOAEI,"I rarely give a show 1 star, but this show has so much UNREALIZED potential. I do not have a problem with artistic license vis a vis historical accuracy. The plot jumps around a bit, and as one reviewer noted, the audio mix makes it difficult to understand the dialog in the presence of background noises or music. This is really annoying when the DaVinci character mumbles his supposedly genius ramblings. After much thought about why I found myself choking through the episodes rather than enjoying them, I realized it was the DaVinci actor himself. What's with the 'do? I don't think they had mousse back then so for his hair to do that on its own, it would have to host an entire ecology of creatures. And beyond the makeup, the main character is so poorly cast! He simply does not carry off a medieval genius. He looks like he got lost on his way to the tennis club. The writing, particularly for his part, is also terrible. It seems to have been written by a high school kid who is failing science because he spends too much time playing video games. (The show sometimes has the unreal feel of a video game.) I think if the main character was re-cast and his part re-written, the rest of the show and the cast could be left mostly alone and it would be a good show. And get a new audio guy.",1430956800,5,1296,4.359504132231405
5692858,1,B00C7AOAEI,Unfortunately the sound quality is poor - despite the fact that I have a perfectly adequate sound system which works well with other shows.  We tried using the captioning because it was impossible to follow the audio dialogue but the print on the captioning was too small to read...a convoluted story that becomes impossible to understand unless one can follow the dialogue...we gave up after watching the first episode.

5692906,5,B00C7AOAEI,"This is basically the show I've waited for all my life. David Goyer hits the jackpot here, and the actors who play Da Vinci and Riario are brilliant. Goyer has used what we know about these figure, but he has filled in what we don't know with some marvelous invention.

I first watched the season by buying each episode on Amazon, but I was excited to get the Blu-Ray set to listen to the commentaries, and they do no disappoint. I just wish there were more commentaries and with a wider selection of the actors involved.

I've had a fascination with Da Vinci for a long long time and have often wondered what it might be like to be inside his head for just a few moments to see and feel what the world is like to someone who can see so many of its connections. Ether Goyer felt the same way or it's just a happy coincidence, but he does an excellent job of imagining and illustrating on screen the way Da Vinci's mind might have worked. The seasons are painfully short, but I cannot recommend d this show more highly. We don't know exactly what Da Vinci's life was like, but just maybe he was an Indiana Jones type figure as presented in the show. Even though he likely was not, it's a wonderful ride to imagine that his curiosity took him on these adventures. Come sail away.",1413936000,,1277,4.316666666666666

5692941,3,B00C7AOAEI,"It's an alright series. It's kind of like the main character of Sherlock if he was more autistic and even more of a jerk to his friends had been born in even older times than the original Sherlock Holmes, and then thrown into a conspiracy of magic. The acting is serviceable and even good at times, while the special effects vary between good to terrible. The plot is okay but has serious ups and downs, I found the most enjoyable episodes were the ones not entirely related to the overall plot. The Nunnery one stood out for me as an enjoyable episode for example, in which he investigates a supposed case of possession. ""I could live with it, I could live without it, but I paid 20 bucks for it so I might as well watch it to the end,"" is how I felt watching it most of the time.

The DVD itself if you get the one featured in the image, is pretty trash tier. The voice was out of sync in a few parts, which I would not expect on a professional DVD and had to test it on a different player just to make sure it was in fact the DVD at fault. The packaging is overly bulky, there's no real reason for it. All in all it's a gaudy waste of space, where even the copypasted menu stands out as cheaply done.

I know people feel it's not fair to review the actual hard copy of something when they love the series, so allow me to be clear on this; I feel 3 stars for both the series AND the package. I was none to pleased to have out of sync audio. I could pirate it and then just watch it on VLC to fix that if I wanted to deal with that kind of thing.

The bad: instead of recognizing da Vinci as the great visionary and genius that he was, he comes off as a Pirates of the Carribean/three musketeers swashbuckler who also happens to be a genius. The 'inciting event' is his encounter with a Turkish (presumably Moslem) mystic/magician who gets the hero to smoke from a hookah, mumbles pseudo wisdom and philosophy, then blows some kind of LSD precursor up his nose, which opens the door to a new dimension etc, etc. So, we can have Western civilization being the source of modernity, it has to be some Obama type let's praise the Muslims for bringing light to the ignorant, benighted Christians. Meanwhile, our hero's banging the beautiful wife of his patron Lorenzo Medici, and SPOILER COMING UP - she is a spy for a rival mafiosi family.

5692958,5,B00C7AOAEI,"A wonderfully inventive and imaginative series that will hold your attention and leave you wanting more. I stumbled on to it by chance, since it's not my usual thing--and I was glad I did. The writers blend historical accuracy with adventure and romance worthy of Dumas-along with an esoteric thread involving the retrieval of a magical book that holds the secrets to existence. Along the way you'll be treated to magnificent recreations of Florence at the time of Lorenzo De' Medici -and to his political struggles with his rivals, the Pazzi Family, and with the war pope, Sixtus.

Serving as  Lorenzo's  military engineer Da Vinci ingratiates himself to the Medici with his flying machines and  proto-modern weaponry, which  are shown from their inspiration within Leonardo's imagination to their application in the field [ and things as he imagines them are incredibly well done graphically] . But there is more here--because underlying all his actions are Da Vinci's attitudes to his personal relationships- with his father who despises him for his bastardy, his mentor Verocchio, his lovers, whom he does not love, and mostly his mother, whose disappearance from his life as a small child marks his detachment from others and colors his quest to determine her fate,  which is linked to the magical Book of Leaves.

The quest for the book will involve Da Vinci with the Mithraic Brotherhood, whose maps entice him with the promise of the New World [ and the world beyond the veil]--where he will travel with the aid of Amerigo Vespucci.

Very, very clever, lots of fun and beautifully realized.",1406246400,,1598,5.003773584905661

I hear a lot of complaining by history buffs(I am a history fanatic myself) about how this or that is not authentic, and this didn't happen like that, or they are taking it out of context. Folks, this is entertainment, meant to appeal to a BROAD audience, not to highly focused intellectuals. It is ENTERTAINMENT!!!! I personally love taking time off from a very difficult Masters level program in History to just chill out and enjoy a good yarn.

And it just keeps getting weirder, to where I've caught myself snorting at the screen and going, ""Wha-a-at? Oh, C'MON! Really?""

I am impressed with the possibilities of this series, especially since a lot of Da Vinci's history is murky at best and with the liberties taken in the storylines here the possibilities are endless.  I was a bit surprised that a series with Leonardo Da Vinci as the principal was shot in Wales and not in Italy, by a creator from Michigan who has stirred up some great mysteries to go along with the history of a time and place and person of Da Vinci's stature and with some soft porn thrown in Game of Thrones style has not been more talked and written about.

I think most people would NEVER conceptualize DaVinci in the persona and spirit he's portrayed in this series, much less the people he's surrounded himself with. It's intriguing and rather like eating Cheetos, you just can't stop once you start, even though you know it has zero nutritional value. :) I love that the show writers have built enormous respect for DaVinci's staggering genius, but some of the personal flaws/character traits they assigned him are sour notes and make little sense. Overall, it is a brain-tickling romp and I love it; the intrigue, the mystery, the occult woven in here and there, fascinating and HIGHLY entertaining.

DaVinci really was, in fact, one of the greatest minds of all time. If you mention DaVinci think of Mona Lisa, but he did so much more than that. He was a better inventor than artist. Dont get me wrong he was a great artist, but far from the best. What he was the best at was inventing. Some of his inventions include, the Helicopter, the Tank, the Parachute, but most impressive was the robot currently being pursued by NASA. He was centuries ahead of his time. A 15th century man's ideas, just now being realized in the 20th and 21th centuries. He just might be the greatest mind of all time.

5693033,4,B00C7AOAEI,"How does one even begin to describe this show? Part biography, part historic-political drama, part fabricated conspiracy (cue&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Da-Vinci-Code/dp/0307474275/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Da Vinci Code</a>&nbsp;references), part buddy-comedy, with a smattering of courtroom dramas, supernaturally themed mysteries, and romantic intrigue - heck, there's even room for a guest-starring Vlad epe. Yes, *that* Vlad epe; also known as Count Dracula. In terms of plot, everything but the kitchen sink is packed into ""Da Vinci's Demons"", so much so that it's nearly impossible to keep track of the myriad of subplots that meander throughout the course of the eight-episode first season.

Perhaps it's best described simply as a fictional account of Leonardo da Vinci's youth: his inventions, his associates, his adventures and his participation in various historical events. Set predominantly in 15th century Florence during the Renaissance, da Vinci is already notorious for his artistic skill, wild ideas, and unorthodox sexual practices. Played by Tom Riley as a sort of hyperactive savant, the viewer occasionally gets glimpses into the way his mind works - when a flock of birds is released, he sees them as moving sketches; when a new idea comes to him, we see the outline of his plan drawn in his mind before it's committed to paper.

He's kind of like what would happen if you combined Tony Stark with Sherlock Holmes - rather selfish, intensely intelligent, somewhat anti-social, and yet immensely attractive *because of* rather than *in spite of* how wrapped up he is in his own little world.

He fits into his current surroundings like a spark does with gunpowder. Florence and its de-facto rulers, the Medici family, are currently under immense pressure from Rome to submit to their control. Lorenzo de' Medici (Elliot Cowan), his brother Giuliano (Tom Bateman) and his wife Clarice (Lara Pulver) are all passionately defensive of Florence's beauty and independence, and forge a rather unlikely alliance with di Vinci in the hopes of maintaining its freedom.

But on a more personal note, da Vinci is on a quest of his own. As the illegitimate son of a notary, he's always been an embarrassment to his father, and knows nothing of his mother save her name: Caterina. Over the course of the season he comes to realize that her disappearance may have something to do with a cult called the Sons of Mithras, whose members encourage him to seek out an artefact known as the Book of Leaves. This is where the inevitable resemblance to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Da-Vinci-Code/dp/0307474275/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Da Vinci Code</a>&nbsp;kicks in, for Leonardo's journey is filled with hidden clues strewn throughout various books, paintings, sculptures and architecture.

I think even fans of the show would concede that the balancing act between these two plots is somewhat clumsy. The wider political intrigue and the cult storylines seldom intersect, and since both vie for screen-time it's difficult to decide which of the two should be considered the focus of the show. Furthermore, the two are so different in content and tone that I suspect most viewers will end up preferring one over the other - which means that for those interested in the Medici family's struggle to save Florence, Leonardo's obsession with his own past will seem irrelevant, whereas for those drawn into the mystery of the cult will wonder why so much time is being spend on political matters elsewhere. The cult storyline is embroiled in mysticism that doesn't really mesh with the overarching theme of rationality and science, giving one the feeling that the show wants to cherry-pick the ""exoticism"" of eastern cults but also commend the ""enlightenment"" of western civilization. In other words, it wants to have its cake and eat it too.

That's not even getting into the various subplots involving Leonardo's dalliance with Lorenzo's mistress (Laura Haddock), who has an agenda of her own, but hey - perhaps you'll get lucky and find both plots equally captivating. In its favor, the hectic plots at least ensure that the show is never boring.

As you might have expected from a Starz show, there is plenty of nudity and sex, though in this case male viewers will have more to appreciate - though there is no shortage of young naked women, the men who get their clothes off are invariably not quite as pleasing to the eye. There's also been some controversy concerning da Vinci's sexuality, for although the man himself is strongly believed to have been gay (though there's always room for debate), here he's best described as mildly bi-curious. All his love scenes are with women, and it's easy to feel as though some erasure has gone on - which is a shame. If any channel could have green-lit a program spearheaded by an openly gay main character, surely it would have been Starz.

Finally, be warned that there's hardly any attempt to adhere to history accuracy - though you only need to glimpse the astounding outfits of the women to realize that. Though some famous events are touched upon (and the Pazzi Conspiracy makes up the greater part of the last two episodes), the show is content to work with its own rules and more-or-less make things up as it goes.

So it all adds up to a rather disjointed show - though I'd personally rather watch something that takes risks and tries new things than treads the same familiar paths. I enjoyed da Vinci's little collection of comrades (sardonic Zoroaster, long-suffering Nicco, free-spirited Vanessa), the occasional nod to history, and the creative costumes, set design and general visual style. I mentioned at the start of this review that even Vlad epe pops in for a guest-starring role, but as it happens Paul Rhys puts in a chilling performance as the famous prince, making it one of the best portrayals of the famous figure in recent memory.

One of the central themes is that of reason, logic and light overcoming superstition, but also a celebration of debauchery, creativity and sexual freedom over that which seeks to stifle and control - and in its boundless energy and originality, ""Da Vinci's Demons"" is a pretty perfect encapsulation of both these outlooks.",1394064000,3,6338,5.21099116781158

5693049,4,B00C7AOAEI,"Well acted and beautifully shot but this take on the life of Leonardo Da Vinci may not be for everyone. A lot of artistic license was taken with the storyline, but I found it very entertaining. Like other Starz television series (Spartacus come to mind), it is graphic in language and sexual content but not quite as violent. I never get the feeling the script was written as an accuse to use the graphic content as a way to hook that portion of the viewing audience who likes R rated productions. The storyline keeps the audience wondering if Da Vinci will survive the social and political ordeals he constanly faces, which gave the writters a backdrop for using Da Vinci's genius to get him through impossible situations. My father, who is 94, saw three episodes and found it negative because it didn't always have happy endings. But knowing they can't kill of the main charactor, I found it edgy and creative. Maybe this production will appeal more to an audience expecting a Starz type production.",1390348800,,1001,4.725714285714286

In the game Da Vinci was an ally of the Creed where he made most of Ezio's fantastical weapons.

Now with that said, sadly there is no Ezio Auditore da Firenze, But there is a mysterious Creed that Da Vinci's blood line is part of, and that's all we will tell you about that so no spoilers.

we hope you join us watching even though there is no Ezio or assassin's Creed ""as of yet"" Da Vinci's Demons is around that time period, and it feels and looks like the game, it kind of gives you a feeling of the same Da Vinci that helped Ezio with all of his ingenious devices.",1389052800,4,782,4.23489932885906

These are the same screen writers outside lamenting  with PETA about exploitation to animals?  What about screenwriters exploiting audiences with sex and nudity.  If this is all you have KEEP it. I am tired of watching a movie and it is 95 percent nudity, sexual content and sexual exploitation.  Not to mention, the constant push of someone's agenda or activist plight.  There is no creativity in sex on screen.  I don't care who does it. Get over it.  Grow up and do a movie not porn.  No talent in porn. And keep your activist and political agendas to yourself!

5693082,1,B00C7AOAEI,"First of all, the show is magnificent to behold - the cinematography, the sets, the scenery, are are beautiful. The costumes are appropriate to the period, yet somehow have a contemporary feel and are all regal, elegant, and the women all look lovely. The men are all very sexy in leather. The soundtrack brings glorious drama to all the scenes and is worthy of a show about Leonardo DaVinci. The acting skills of all the actors is consistently excellent. With that said, my issue with the show is how DaVinci is portrayed. He was a true Renaissance man and was a painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer - amazing! But he was and is primarily remembered for being one of the greatest painters of all time. Yet the show portrays him as some kind of superhero who is swinging a sword, rather than showing him as the great intellectual he was. I understand the writers are trying to appeal to a modern audience and want to make the show ""cool"" but it's primary focus is on political intrigue and soap opera sexual relationships. I would like to see the focus move to DaVinci's life as an artist and have him put down the sword and pick up a paint brush. Do the writers think the show would be boring to explore DaVinci's artistic genius so they have to turn him into a superhero fighting with and getting involved with the political problems of the day? Also, DaVinci has often been identified as a homosexual. It is known that he had no close relationships with women during his life and that his intimate relationships are rumored to have been with his pupils. At the age of 24, he and three other young men were charged with sodomy (the charges were dismissed) and since then he kept his private life secret (many speculate that since he was gay he kept his personal secret out of fear of persecution). Both, this show portrays DaVinci having sex and romantic feeling towards women which just is not true. I wish the writers had the guts to portray DaVinci as true to who is really was, gay.  DaVinci had to hide his sexuality in the 1400's, and the writers today are still hiding it because, presumably, they don't think it would be good for ratings, they should be ashamed of themselves! Tell the truth, not what you think will sell best, let's have an accurate picture of the man and please, please let us see DaVinci actually painting and putting his efforts into creating a great masterpiece and what it takes to create a great painting, that would be interesting, not every show has to be filled with non-stop action to be entertaining.",1383782400,20,2634,4.676724137931035

5693100,5,B00C7AOAEI,"I came by this just by accident and decided to buy it sight unseen primarily based on the fact that I love costume dramas and most of the negative reviews I read had to do with the fact that the show is not historically accurate.  And I am so glad that I did!

I am just about finished watching the series for a second time and really found that my opinion of it still held.  It is a very well done and intelligent series.  The show is a combination of The Borgias, Sherlock and Indiana Jones. But most of all it comes across as a live  action Alexander Dumas novel, complete with huge bombastic plot filled with conspiracies, secret societies swashbuckling and historical twists.

 The series involves a young Leonardo Da Vinci who is a genius, artist and inventor.  He's the illegitimate son of  one of Florence's  prominent citizens. However given his illegitimacy it bars him from a social standing to which he smarts against. On the surface Da Vinci's rebellion may seem as if he is just thumbing his nose at society. But as the series progresses you can see that he harbours inner hurt due to the fact that he is not recognized for his talents or for the fact that his parents rejected him (his mother abandoned the family) and the father resents Leo because he reminds him that the mother abandoned him.  I found it very interesting that for most of the show, there is a theme of characters personalities and actions being motivated by wanting to please their father. It was interesting.

Leo manages to get himself a position  with the powerful Medicci family who influence Florence due to their wealth who are in a battle with the corrupt Pope in Rome.  He also gets entangled with Lorenzo's Di Medicci's mistress Lucrezia.

There are also several sub-plots going on at the same time the most prominent one involving a secret society based called `The Sons of Mithras' whose over all goals are not yet revealed  but drives the plot.  But it has something to do with releasing knowledge to mankind which the Catholic Church .

It's a very good show , which I would recommend to those who enjoy costume dramas and mysteries.",1380931200,,2131,4.592592592592593
5693101,5,B00C7AOAEI,"I love everything about this show and hope it gets tons more attention in its second season.  The cast is wonderful--not a weak link in the lot--and the writing is fun and funny and just plain entertaining.  The lead, the lovely Tom Riley, is new to American audiences but I predict he will be a household name in a very short time.  This role will make him a star in the US.  He's the perfect mix of mad genius and vulnerable young man and don't even get me started on the hot. ;)  I look forward to seeing what else he will do in his career.

The DVD could have a lot more special features than it does and I would have preferred commentary on different episodes than the ones they chose (specifically, I was missing commentary on pivotal Ep 4, The Magician).  There are NO outtakes, which was a real disappointment.  I'm sure there were some funny moments they could have shared with the viewers--we love that stuff. :)  Maybe next time.

I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys 'The Tudors', 'The Borgias' or 'Game of Thrones'.  It's whimsical, too, but not so much that you feel manipulated.  Just let your imagination go with this fun, engaging story and you won't be disappointed.",1380499200,,1192,4.493023255813953

5693103,2,B00C7AOAEI,"Certainly good subject matter for a series, considering the success of Rome and The Borgias. However, the creator's preoccupation with sexual encounters (male-female, male-male and male-young male) takes away from the story. While it may be historically accurate, I didn't need or want such graphic illustration. The opening sequence is a good example of getting the message across without resorting to shock and awe.
The weakest link in the cast for me, is the actor playing da Vinci. The rest of the cast seem to fill their roles extremely well. The actor playing da Vinci's father does exceptionally well during the trial. Vlad was also a character/actor highlight.
Probably pass on season two. With such rich material to pull from, it seems a bit lazy to go for nudity and sexual encounters so often. Perhaps if there was more history and less snogging?",1380326400,5,857,5.0

It is sad that Hollywood must reinvent one to excite us when his ideas alone should excite us beyond what any Hollywood hacks can offer.

My approach to this show was within the context of the inventions and DaVinci's genius and artistic talent I saw first-hand in France.  Independent of historical inaccuracy, the story is entertaining and the overall visual effect is stunning in every scene.  The costumes, sets, lighting and props were all excellent, and the graphics were enjoyable.

For the record, I'm put off by Hollywood ramming homosexuality into every program; it really is getting old.  At least they didn't have any Brokeback Mountain scenes, thankfully.  It is a deliberate effort to degrade modern culture, and does nothing for gay rights advocates, in my opinion.

That aside, this series did manage to display a wide range of dramatic themes, romance, action, intrigue, politics, and a bit of the contrast between liberty and tyranny, in its own way.  Overall consider this an entertaining adult program on many levels, and you should not be disappointed.

5693119,4,B00C7AOAEI,"DA VINCI'S DEMONS is an intriguing cable television series; well acted and boasting rich production values that transport viewers back to Italy of the 1400s.

The first season of the series, consisting of eight one-hour episodes, is a portrait of Leonardo Da Vinci (Tom Riley) as a young man, tortured by the gift of superhuman genius.  He lives in an age where he must take up the fight against powerful forces that use history, religion and politics to suppress the truth.  Indeed, his quest for knowledge almost becomes his undoing as he explores the fringes of his own sanity.

 As worthy as DA VINCI'S DEMONS might be, it does have its problems.  Primarily, it deals with a time in European history of which many people, including this writer, are not overly familiar.  Therefore, it would have been quite helpful if, at the start of the series, the producers had included some sort of narration or other device that would have put the story we were about to see into context.  The series also introduces multiple characters and plot lines so quickly and without explanation that much of the enterprise becomes confusing.  One continually wonders who are these characters, what are their relationships and why are they doing what they are doing?

Aside from Riley, the excellent cast of the series includes Laura Haddock, Blake Ritson, Elliot Cowan, Gregg Chillin and Lara Pulver.

DVD extras on the 3-disc set from Anchor Bay Entertainment include audio commentaries by series creator David S. Goyer and several members of the cast, many ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes and deleted scenes.

5693120,3,B00C7AOAEI,"I'm quite conflicted about this show.  I watched it all, and for the most part enjoyed it, but definitely not without reservations.  Let's get to it!

The Good:
- Premise:  Da Vinci is one of history's most interesting characters... and frankly it's a brave choice.  The basic idea is that the Da Vinci we all know from history is indeed an artist/inventor/genius, but also deeply involved in the political intrigue of the day.  Given how little is known about his early day-to-day life, it makes sense that they've expanded his role a bit to incorporate him into known political happenings of late 15-century  Florence. It's an interesting period most people aren't very familiar with, so I'm all about it.

- Over-Arching Plot:  Why not just say ""plot""?  Because sadly plot will be featured in ""The Bad"" section below.  However, the overall plot, the story of what drives Leonardo, I find somewhat compelling.  Leonardo is essentially looking for his long-lost mother, who he can't remember at all.  This search leads him in some super-natural directions and his quest for his mother becomes intertwined with a quest for the ""book of leaves""... which I assume will be explained later.  This is all fantasy of course, but I like it.  No problems at all here.

- Production:  I'm kind of lumping a lot of smaller things in here.  I think the acting was just fine and the casting was well done.  I even like the opening music, which occasionally forces its way into the episode.  When trying to illustrate moments of genius they basically start drawing things on the screen in the style of Leonardo's famous etchings.  This is a little weird, but certainly unique and it grew on me.

The Bad:
- Plot:  I'm referring more to the episode-by-episode plot.  It's very formulaic, especially for the first part of the season.  Some misadventure befalls Florence, commissioner Gordon shines a specially modified spotlight into the night, summoning Da Vinci.  He, of course, see's the Mona Lisa symbol in the sky and quickly invents something outrageous out of a pomegranate, a toothpick and a rotting stump... voila, crisis resolved.  In some ways it's a 15th century MacGyver.  Often episodes focus on these absurd side stories, with little mention of the main plot.  This simply doesn't work in an 8-episode season.  So the last 3 episodes feel like they just said ""oh wow, we should really get on that.""

- History:  Honestly, I'm completely fine with messing with history for entertainment shows, but they try to incorporate known history, and frankly they often do it badly.  They play with time considerably, the show takes place in 1478 (as dated by the historical events in the final episode), or maybe it takes place earlier, as it features Vlad III, who died 4 years earlier than that.  It feels at times like they were sitting in a brainstorming session and saying ""15th century Europe... what you got?""... to which the replies came, ""Um, I don't know much about 15th century Europe... let's see, we got Leonardo, so what else?... OH!... Ferdinand and Isabella, i know Spain isn't really near Italy but we'll work it out... discovery of America, what else?.. Dracula!, that's around then right?  *consults encyclopedia* ... yep, Dracula.  Romania's only a couple days walk from Florence anyway."" This just seems forced to me, and it rubbed me the wrong way.

- The End:  Despite the ominous title, fear not, I won't give away the ending.  But I will say that it's poorly executed.  It's done like a show that planned for 10 episodes but only got 8.  In most well-written shows, each season has an over-arching plot (which it has).  In the season finale, you wrap up some things to give an audience closure, and you usually end with some kind of cliff-hanger so that people keep paying their $13/month for Starz to see next season.  This excels at the latter and utterly fails at the former.  It has literally zero closure.  Nothing is resolved, not one thing.  It's especially surprising given how tidy the individual episodes were.  Frankly it's just very disappointing.

Summary:  One could easily read this review and conclude I hated the show.  Far from it, I liked the characters I was supposed to like and loathed the bad guys.  I got invested in the story, and will definitely watch next season.  For me though, the wild story tangents, absurd inventions (Leonardo was amazing as is, do we really need to give him credit for discovering America and inventing photography?), and absolutely atrocious ending prevent this from being a great show.  It's merely a good show, hovering dangerously-close to mediocre.",1375315200,52,4619,4.870179948586118
