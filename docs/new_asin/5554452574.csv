205936,5,5554452574,"Why do I like this movie?  It had powerful, gutwrenching, disturbing conflict.  Conflict that is created by the development of the main characters. John Ritter suprised the living daylights out of me with his  character portrayal.  Remember Three's Company? Remember those movies he  made about that rotten kid that needed a good slap? I can't even remember  the name of that movie...oh well.  Anyway, John Ritter deserves some kind  of award for making me forget about Jack Tripper. And Dwight Yokam is  pretty terrifying as an abusive boyfriend... actually, I think he should  quit his day job and become like a freaky Leonardo Dicaprio.  Billy Bob  Thornton=my hero...you deserve an oscar...I don't know who won it, Forrest  Gump or English patie...z-z-z-z-z ...whoever, you deserve some kind of  prize for your acting, directing, writing, whatever...anyway, this is not  some kinda bang bang, shootem up, exploding gunfight, with people getting  whacked left and right kinda movie.  Instead, this is a chop chop, cutem  up, chair dragging, window staring, abusive, high pants wearing drama.  I  like it a lot.",912038400,,1113,5.215909090909091

206036,5,5554452574,"Billy Bob Thornton is amazing in every way.  Writer, producer, actor.  This is a very thought producing film.  Treated mental disability in a very sensitive way.  The acting is fantastic, especially that of Billy Bob Thornton who plays Carl in the lead part and of the young boy named Frank he befriends.  Some very tender and touching scenes.

206057,5,5554452574,"This is a masterpiece of a movie, written and directed by Billy Bob Thornton, who transformed his visage, voice, and posture to become the main character, Karl.  This is some of the greatest acting I have ever seen.  Some of Karl's monologues are well-nigh unforgettable.  It is a story of a simple-minded man who was horribly abused until he was 12 years old, then wreaked vengeance on his abusers.  After that he spends about 40 peaceful years in a mental institution.  Upon release, he and an approximately 12-year-old boy develop an innocent love.  When Karl sees and hears the boy (Frank), Frank's mother,  the mother's kindly gay male friend, and Karl himself abused by Doyle, Karl avenges the abuse.  The eclectic musical score is hauntingly effective.  The whole movie is captivating.",1510358400,,792,4.984732824427481

206186,3,5554452574,"Late in the movie, the mentally challenged protagonist, Karl, goes to seek his father in his childhood home, and he finds . . . Boo Radley!  Well, not exactly -- he finds Robert Duvall, in a tiny cameo, but still, it's hard to shake the feeling that this whole movie, ""Sling Blade,"" offers variations on a Radleian theme.  That idea had struck me even before Duvall appeared, so maybe in Billy Bob Thornton's mind, there was a sense of homage being paid.  The more serious question, though, is what to make of the fact, as it seems to me, that such a carefully, thoughtfully put-together movie doesn't quite work.  I say ""doesn't quite"" because a lot of it does, and because one can hardly fault the action and the cinematography.  The pacing is a bit deliberate -- but not even close to the point of ruining the movie.

What worked, I thought, was the representation of the family that took Karl in after he had been released from the mental hospital. Linda Wheatley (Natalie Canerday), a young widow, and her son Frank (Lucas Black) are poor whites in a small Arkansas town, clinging to respectability and both supported and threatened by the unstable and controlling Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam), a local building contractor who is in a relationship with Linda that is abusive, although to the movie's credit, there's nothing melodramatic about the representation of the abuse.  Young Frank hates Doyle, and Doyle makes clear that to him Frank is simply in the way and complicating the control he wants to exert over Linda.  Linda tells her son and Karl, whom young Frank has befriended, that she is ""biding her time"" before making an escape from Doyle (who has threatened to kill her if she tries), but the movie makes very clear, without making an explicit point of it,  that Linda's economic circumstances make any escape unlikely and that her talk of biding her time is just an expedient to keep her son from despair.  Frank and Linda take Karl in, and so Karl becomes privy to the household dynamic and its dangers to people he has come to care about . . .

All that is well set up, as is Linda's acceptance of the friendship of Vaughan, her gay boss at the local store where she works.  The movie's problem, I think, is in the conception of the main character, Karl.  In the conception, I say, because Thornton's acting of the role is impressively focused and detailed.  I know -- good actors playing handicapped people are pure Oscar bait, but Thornton is good here, and if the part isn't totally plausible, it's not the actor's fault.  Thornton also wrote the movie, and maybe the problem lies there.  A mentally challenged person is always going to seem ""flat"" to some extent, no matter what specificity of external gesture or manner the actor brings to bear.  Here, it seems that Karl is reduced to being a moral compass and I think it's hard to put on stage or screen someone who is no more than a moral compass.  Thornton has clearly worked hard to convey Karl's essentially moral outlook without making him implausibly articulate about it -- and there are perhaps only a couple of places where he misjudges -- but still, the effect of what I called the flattening is to turn the story into more of a moral fable than a drama.  This might bother some viewers less than it does me (the ratings suggest as much), and I do applaud the refusal to inflate the moral dilemmas with visual hyperbole or melodramatic action.  Apart from the actors already mentioned, John Ritter is effective as Vaughan, J. T. Walsh is creepy as a fellow-inmate at the mental hospital, and there's a very brief cameo by Jim Jarmusch.  Three stars says ""Okay,"" and it's maybe a bit better than that.",1477958400,,3690,4.637480798771121

206212,5,5554452574,"Ive always liked Billy Bob Thornton. I know that some dismiss him as a weirdo (though his now-infamous interview with Jian Ghomeshi looks way less rude and far more hilarious all these years later), but theres no denying the fact that hes a very talented and versatile artist. He gives great performances in films like A Simple Plan and The Man Who Wasnt There, and even when he assumes the role of actor-for-hire in dismal films like Armageddon and Mr. Woodcock, he brings a certain charm and swagger to his characters that makes those films watchableat least when hes onscreen.

He's also a first-rate writer, as anyone whos seen One False Move or Sling Blade can surely attest to. To be an actor and decide to write and direct your own film is a dangerous featone that often doesn't work. Sure, films like Easy Rider and Ordinary People are excellent, but plenty of actors have dream projects that crash and burn (like Harlem Nights or The Passion of the Christ). In Sling Blade, though, Billy Bob Thornton writes and directs with the confidence and the competence of a seasoned filmmaker. He knows how to use long takes to his advantagelike when his character Karl tells a college newspaper reporter the story of how he became institutionalized during the films chilling opening moments.

In Sling Blade, Billy Bob Thornton creates a very rich set of characters; as Doyle Hargraves, Dwight Yoakam plays a villain who could give Frank Booth (Dennis Hoppers character in Blue Velvet) a run for his money; he's one of the most terrifying villains of this era. As Vaughan Cunningham, John Ritter plays an impossibly decent gay man in an era where most LGBT movie characters were mere caricatures. As Karl Childers, Billy Bob Thornton plays an intellectually disabled murderer, though the film never feels condescending to intellectually disabled people in ways that overrated movies like Rain Man and Forrest Gump sadly do. By the end of the film, Sling Blade becomes a statement against intolerancethough never in a sermonizing or heavy-handed manner. (This script was written by Billy Bob Thornton, not Paul Haggis.)

There are certain implausibilities and contrivances here and there, sure, but the film is so well-written and well-acted that I couldn't help but be deeply moved by the end. A scene where Karl gives his books to a young boy that hes befriended is just amazing; once again, Thornton uses a long take and by the end of the shot, I was sure that I had seen one of the most emotionally devastating scenes that I had ever seen. Sling Blade is not a particularly cheery or pleasant film, but it's an uncommonly powerful work that ranks just behind Fargo as the finest film of 1996; Thorntons win for Best Adapted Screenplay was well-deserved.",1471305600,,2756,4.859574468085106

206217,5,5554452574,"As the movie unfolds, we grow to care about and root for Karl in his new life. even though we know from the beginning why he was institutionalized. This is beautifully written and skillfully acted so that the characters unfold slowly amidst the well crafted script. I cried over Karl and the little boy he befriends and fell in love with the community that embraces Karl and gives him friendship, a home and a job. The horror of his past is never sentimentalized and we are left to ponder how very different his life might have turned out if he had had that kind of love and support all along.

206418,5,5554452574,"What makes this film so memorable is the stunning portrayal of a mentally delayed adult named Karl Childers by Billy Bob Thornton. He's never surpassed this level of acting since. Looking at Billy Bob you would never guess that he had this type of acting ability. It's sad that he hasn't been able to produce something on this level since. All the characters within the film nail their part. From John Ritter playing the mellow ""gay friend"", to Dwight Yoakam as the ruthless adult who's a part of the family Karl is staying with. You will never see Dwight Yoakam this bitter and offensive in his life. He mercifully taunts Karl and John Ritter's character. He's abusive and a drunk.

This film is also home to some of the greatest and memorable quotes known to man. 'The french fried potaters"" scene has been quoted in my life more than I can count, and if you search ""Sling Blade Impersonations"" on Youtube, you're bound to see hundrends. An all around great movie with a seriously dark ending. This one will stick with you many years after you watch it.",1462492800,,1055,4.611702127659575

It is a wonderful movie, a great movie, an uplifting and often sad story that satisfies to the end. The main character Karl Childers (played by B.B. Thornton) is an autistic man, but other than that, no less of a human being, and with all the flaws we possess.  John Ritter's character was fascinating and human. I won't even say who Dwight Yoakam played, as it surprised me when the end credits flashed who he was.  This movie made it to my list of faves.",1454630400,,574,4.256880733944954

Thornton restored scenes that he wanted in the original movie. The anniversary version also includes the original director's commentary with updated commentary on the restored scenes.

206556,5,5554452574,"Sling Blade is a really intriguing movie in that Billy Bob Thornton stars as a mentally challenged man who is released from treatment after twenty five years for killing his mother and her boyfriend/booty call. He subsequently befriends a boy, his mother, and a rather eccentric cast of characters. From this premise, one is expecting a horror movie of sorts to emerge as the deranged killer returns to his evil ways and butchers the entire town or something like that.

What emerges in Sling Blade instead is this very unorthodox story of love and friendship that bends the traditional human conceptions of right and wrong. I think the ultimate sign of a good movie is when they telegraph the ending from virtually the first half hour on, but yet I as the viewer was still thoroughly held spellbound wondering if he was actually going to do it or if some force was going to intercede. That is a hard act to pull off, but Sling Blade pulled it off.

Gotta give a hat tip to Thornton, Dwight Yoakam-who played a drunk you just wanted to get his masterfully and John Ritter playing a gay store clerk was just totally unexpected and awesome. Good flick.",1449705600,5,1150,4.632352941176471

I understand that he studied for the role for a long time and it sure paid off. Though the story could be considered a 'Tragedy', it's not sad. We also get a glimpse  into the life of those secretive institutions that locs people up forever.

206629,2,5554452574,"I didn't hate it but I don't like it.  2 stars is what that means apparently.  I don't think it's worth the time spent watching it.  I was going to give it 1 star just for comedy sake.  The boyfriend that gets killed in the end of the movie is pretty funny just based on how mean he was to his gf's son.  Listening to people bullying one another, when in a fictional movie watched for entertainment is funny to think about because of how silly it is to say those mean things to people.  It reminds me of how I talk to my brother sometimes when we rag on each other for fun.  This movie has a lot of foul language and not much story line.  About 3 or 4 sentences in the summary, which were actually cut short in the app I used to see what the movie was about, is all you need to know about the story.  If you like slow movies where you wonder how much longer the movie will last after you get about 1 hour in, then this one is for you!  It reminded me of Gump.  Not because of the disabilities of the main character but just that it was a series of boring activities that didn't wind up meaning much.  And like I said took way too long to tell the story which could have been one episode of whatever you're favorite killer tv show is.  Alright, I didn't like it, I guess I'm glad that the guy killed the bad guy.  I like it when victims don't stay hurting.  I'm going to go read some of these 5 star reviews to see what was so great about it.  This movie is no star wars, radio, or beauty and the beast and does not deserve anywhere close to the same rating.  March of the penguins was better than this movie and I slept through that one.",1444348800,,1637,3.9876923076923076

In the mental institute Carl listens to horrendous stories from another inmate that didn't really add to the story. Carl's final action when he is out, does not seem as well justified as I expected. The villain is certainly a bad guy but not really to the level you would have expected given Carl's action. I'd pass on this movie.",1444262400,,426,4.618421052631579

John Ritter was so talented.  Both John and Billy Bob had chemistry which made Bad Santa so funny.  You also saw it in this movie too but without the comedy.

206746,5,5554452574,"Sling Blade is a terrific film with a terrific cast. Billy Bob Thornton won an Oscar for original Screenplay but he was also director, producer, and actor. The story of Carl Childers, a mentally challenged middle age man who has been released from a mental hospital after 25 years into small town Arkansas.

Upon his reluctant release, he befriends Frank, a kid whose father has died. Frank's mother Linda has an abusive boyfriend played by Dwight Yoakam. Linda's boss and friend Vaughn is played by John Ritter. Carl moves in with Linda and Frank but mom's boyfriend is trouble.

The film is beautifully done like an understated masterpiece. Billy Bob's Carl is a unique original character rarely seen in film. John Ritter gave a rare performance as a homosexual in small town. Lucas Black was perfect as Frank. Robert Duvall has a short appearance as Carl's father. Dwight Yoakam is better known as a musician and singer than actor. Dwight gives a terrific performance as the abusive boyfriend. J.T. Walsh has a small role as one of the inmates. He was one of the best character actors ever.

There are two DVDS in this package. The first DVD is about the movie. The second DVD features two in depth documentaries about Billy Bob's life. One episode is a Bravo Profiles. There is a round table discussion with Billy Bob, Dwight, Mickey Jones and David Bushell. There is a conversation between Billy Bob and Robert Duvall. They also feature the return of Karl; on the set; and film reviews.

If you loved the movie, you will love this two disc set.",1436745600,,1549,4.725925925925926

I am in agreement with the another review of the film and find it was very accurate,  gives enough of story and details to let others gauge the amount of violence  (movie ratings these days just give you the ratings, but no scale of how bad or drastic). While Billy Bob did an excellent job playing the character of Karl,  it was described accurately that the film never mentions what his illness is, but I would agree with him that he had autism to some extent. The other part is a child brought up institutionalized that maybe some others watching might not pull together to conclude? Overall just a bunch of good reviews of a good movie that is something that should be considered by some high school teachers for use in school compared to other crap they show in the name of ""educational purposes""",1435363200,,878,4.537974683544304

206858,2,5554452574,"Prepare, I will have spoilers in this.  I gave it two starts 'cause at times the acting was decent like when Billy Bob and Dwight made their characters believable.  Sadly, then they break character.  Ugh.  However, the part I have the hardest time with (BIG SPOILER) his how Billy Bob's character went from a version of Lennie Small from Of Mice and Me--crossed with someone who is possibly autistic-- who acted on passion in the past (something that could get the best of some of the greatest humans, which is why it carries a lighter sentence in court) to a premeditated killer.  All of a sudden he was plotting and making eye contact and TOTALLY OUT OF CHARACTER.  Some will argue that his parents' poor treatment from the past and negligence left him prone to violence.  Huh?  I disagree.  If he was truly prone to violence and displays of anger, then the mental hospital would have seen it.  There would be more consistency in his violence...like with Dwight's character.  One could argue that he had been building up his anger inside himself.  In fact, he did talk about wanting his Dad dead...but only to his Dad's face and even that he had let go.  So I say that pent up anger seems too weak of an argument as he is pretty gentle and not looking to hurt humans, animals or himself.  Still, I would accept the plot development (and fully expected it) to all come down to him needing to make another decision in the heat of some big blowup between Dwight's character and the family.  Non-premeditated.  THAT would be believable.  But this?  No way.",1432598400,,1554,4.589090909090909

206866,5,5554452574,Billy Bob Thornton provided an excellent portrayal of a mentally stifled person who has obvious physical and personality flaws. He  views the right or wrong actions of other people in  a very black and white manner. This leads the very bad and violent decisions on his part. The result eventually is his removal from society but he seemingly accepts this very calmly. I am always impressed with the ability of actors to get so 'into'  the role of the character  they portray.,1431734400,,475,4.7560975609756095

206899,4,5554452574,"Back in the 60's, and perhaps into the 70's as well, certain types of psychological phenomena such as co-dependency, battered woman syndrome, and addictive personality disorder were either relatively unknown or nonexistence (had not yet been identified).  Let's assume this movie was released way back then. So when the Billy Bob Thornton character (Karl) murders the Dwight Yoakam character (Doyle), people cheer. The audience believes that Doyle's girlfriend and her earnest young son were saved from walking, talking evil. And the audience believes the girlfriend and her son will go on to live a new life.

Unfortunately this movie was originally released in 1996; and by this time, the aforementioned psychological phenomena were well-known to the audience. So when Karl murders Doyle, the audience is thinking, ""What is the point in that?? Within 6 months or so, Doyle's girlfriend is going to go back out and find another guy just like Doyle, or worse. She'll be right back to square 1 and poor Karl, who murdered Doyle in hopes of saving the lives of the girlfriend and her young son, winds up back in the psycho ward - this time for life!"" And this's what I mean when I say that this movie would have played better way back when. As for the Sling Blade fanatics, and I count myself as one of them, you can't just blow this off. It goes to the question of what was the point of killing Doyle? I dock this film one star on account of this.

Otherwise...terrific script, direction, acting. One of J.T. Walsh's last great roles. (J.T. Walsh, one of the all-time great character actors.)",1429056000,,1591,4.82051282051282

207050,5,5554452574,"This film is superbly written, and all the actors rise to the level of the writing. Billy Bob Thornton has created one of the great characters in cinema. This film has a small town, southern vibe to it and moves at a slow pace, but parts of it are very intense-it has a edge to it and a quirky sense of humor. To me the highlight is the relationship between Karl Childers-a mentally and emotionally challenged adult, and Frank-a child raised by a single Mom with a psychotic boyfriend (chillingly played by Dwight Yoakam). They are two old souls that have experienced too much pain in life, and form a connection that is the heart of the film.
This is a small independent film that relies on a great story and acting, a breath of fresh air from special effects popcorn movies. It plays just as well on a small screen as it did on a theater screen. I highly recommend this film.",1419897600,,877,4.386503067484663

Now that I've seen it I can't agree more. Don't expect any sort of a feel good sensation from this movie; I was quite uncomfortable for much of it.  However, it is all to a good end--no gratuitous weirdness, perversity, violence or ""real"" language.  This movie accurately displays depravity and loveliness existing together in humankind and it hurts to watch it.

This is a great story about a mentally challenged man who is sent to the state hospital for a tragic crime where he killed his mother and her lover (he thought she was being raped and then turned on her when she insulted him) after having grown up in a household with strict biblical rules.  As he is released back into society he is found a job by the state hospital warden, and starts to make it on his own.  He befriends a young boy who is being raised by a single mother who's best friend (played by John Ritter) is a somewhat in the closet homosexual in their small Arkansas town.  The mother has an abusive boyfriend that picks on the son and her best friend and starts to pick on Carl (Billy Bob Thornton).  I don't want to write too much more as I don't want to give everything away.  Watch the movie, it is a great story, with great acting",1416268800,,1063,4.160975609756098

I feel like Billy Bob Thornton did not just act the part of Karl. It seemed like Billy Bob became Karl. This gave Karl a lot more dimension as a character, rather than a flat, retarded caricature. Dwight Yoakum as the anti-hero was easy to hate and pity at the same time, which again demonstrates some good acting on top of good writing and directing.",1415059200,,501,4.516483516483516

It was a late night screening and the only reason I was there was because I was overruled 3 to 1 by the company I was keeping that night. Since we were not in my car and I was not driving, I pretty much got snookered and all I remembered about it after all these years was that it was about a homicidal maniac that mutilated his victims, got sent to a mental hospital, was released and did the same thing again. I thought it was absolutely awful!

Fast forward 18 years, I see this is new to Amazon Prime, I was trying to pass time waiting for the kick off of a football game I was interested in and the running time was perfect to pass the time.  I was floored by the movie and the different characters and how the different actors portrayed them. I wished I had given it a chance 18 years ago.",1414368000,,860,4.023391812865497

207437,5,5554452574,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. Billy Bob Thornton does an outstanding job in the role of Carl. The movie has a great cast in general that work very well together, John Ritter and the little man, Frank. It was in fact, Frank that caused me to watch this again. I just watched the new NCIS New Orleans and the detective in that was so familiar- his drawl and demeanor- sure enough- it is Lucas Black, who I think is excellent in both. In this movie he does a great job of having the insight of a compassionate man, even at his tender age. Sling Blade is a bit on the dark side but will give you a realistic look at the lives some are dealt in this old world. This makes you appreciate what you have, and reminds us that we all don't have the white picket fence and perfect family life, however family does not always have to be blood relatives- they are very much our family ""of the heart"".",1412812800,,901,4.154285714285714

So I finally got around to watching it and was amazed by it.

Billy Bob Thornton is brilliant in all elements of this movie from the writing, to the directing to the acting.  The plot is very simple and it seems to drag slowly to what it's apparent obvious conclusion will be.  Yet, it's the very simply plot and examination of the characters and the revealing of the abuse suffered by the main character combined with his developmental challenges that make the film so powerful.

This is an outstanding and brilliant film that is worth watching more than once.

I'm sorry I waited so long before coming to it.

207555,5,5554452574,"Sling Blade is one of Billy Bob Thornton's best performances!  Sling Blade offers a lot of insight into the many ways that our society brutalizes and torments those who are unable to defend themselves appropriately.  Carl's parents were not representative of what we all believe and expect of parents, and the sad part of this story is that there are still family's and societies in this country and other countries, that still treat children who are different as a target.  To tease and torture these children because they are different.  Carl, who was a victim all his life sees that he must protect and ensure his young friend does not get trampled by the dangers in his life, and wind up a broken person, incapable of succeeding in the complex world we have created.  Carl sacrifices his freedom to save the young boy's future.  In my eyes Carl is not a murderer, but a protector of those who cannot protect themselves, at the current time in their life.  A great movie that is funny, strange at times, and sad with a happy ending.  A happy ending that cannot be seen by some, and so evident to others.  Carl is truly a tool of God's, created and with a purpose that only God can see.  Again, its a great movie, and is another credit to Billy Bob Thornton's career.",1410393600,,1269,4.526315789473684

207558,5,5554452574,"I'm willing to go out on a limb and say Slingblade may be one of the best movies ever made. It's ridiculous that it's been trivialized to people making bad impressions about ""biscuits and mustard, mm-hm"" when it's so much more than that. It has a LOT of heart, drama, and plenty of funny moments (the reactions of Vaughn are absolutely classic).

I'm not sure if BBT meant for Doyle to come across as funny or scary, but my wife and I find him hilarious. Ironically I do not find the impact on those around him as funny (and they add to the escalating tension and inevitable conclusion)... Well, the impact on his drinking buddies is pretty funny, but I digress. Regardless, Dwight Yoakam played this role perfectly.",1410393600,,716,4.59375

207622,2,5554452574,"This might be great acting from Billy Bob, but it is too disturbing a story.  I did not enjoy it.  Watching bully's picking on a mentally challenged person is not entertainment, it's torture.  Maybe it was just my mood.",1400889600,,219,4.564102564102564
207623,5,5554452574,"I read several mixed reviews from some very strange individuals and I must say this movie, Sling Blade, falls into 1 of 2 categories, you either LOVE IT or you HATE IT, there is no room for ANYTHING ELSE.  I loved it.  Billy Bob Thornton is not the first actor that comes to mind when someone asks me ""who is your most favorite Actor"" nor is he the last.  There are many talented actors and actresses so to choose which one is the best is not an easy task as some excel in certain areas where others fail.  If I was asked ""what actor has the most range?"" my reply would be ""Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade and Heath Ledger as the Joker"" because no other actors are able to show more range in character that these two men; well maybe Jack Nicholson but that is another review.  Heath Ledger as the Joker mad the entire movie because without him that Batman movie would have failed, and FAILED EPICALLY.  I say that because the Dork that played ""THE BATMAN"" not even worth mentioning his name, did such a poor job as THE BATMAN that I was about to walk out and DEMAND a REFUND for such a crap movie; but I digress...  I can not think of any other actor that could have pulled off Karl other then Billy Bob Thornton.  The character Karl was so real to life for me that I would swear on a stack of Bibles that Karl is a Real Person and that Billy Bob Thornton was a figment of my imagination.  Obviously that is not the case so Major Kudos to Billy Bob for pulling off the impossible and nailing the part of Karl.  The makeup was such that I spend the entire movie trying to find what is Billy Bob and what part is Makeup and I fail all the time.  If Billy Bob is simply contorting his face the entire movie then Double Major Kudos because that is one hell of a thing to do.  The music was moving as well and I would venture to say that only someone that has had a very troubled childhood could possibly relate.  If you were raised with a silver spoon in your mouth and everyday you woke was Christmas then I would say this movie is NOT FOR YOU as there is no possible way you could relate to the trauma that turned out to be Karl's Life.  If you are like me and every day you woke you NEVER HAD CHRISTMAS, not even on December 25th, then I would say you will probably love this Movie.  This movie is in a class of its own and to compare it to anything else would be an act of desperation, because your life sucks so bad that you have to impose your views on others because you are just so important.  NOT!!!  In closing this movie will go down in time as one of the BEST EVER MADE.  Billy Bob Thornton did something NO ONE ELSE COULD, he made the character Karl BELIEVABLE.",1400457600,,2672,4.115606936416185

207656,5,5554452574,What a fantastic performance by Billy Bob Thorton!.  I was impressed with the level he immersed himself in his character as a mentally ill patient guilty of double murder and being released from an institution.  I was mesmerized by his friendship with a young boy and intrigued by his own backstory.  I found myself rationalizing his actions (as misplaced as they were) and rooting for him.

So I decided to give it a go. Received the Blu Ray in excellent condition (sealed) and no damage. Popped it in and got sucked in all over again. The picture was ten times better and no blurs what so ever! You could see a lot of details. So much that I could see food in Doyel's beard during the dinner table scene. For the sound, outstanding! I could hear so much more than I ever have. Some lines that were whispered (Carl's dad) you could hear and make out. The music is so much more clean and lively! Really nice to have this movie in Blu Ray quality!  Really brings the movie back to life and makes it even better than the original DVD version which was so good to begin with.

207712,5,5554452574,"This movie focuses on an eventful interval in the life of Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton), a man with mental gifts and challenges.  He is a spatial relationship genius who can solve problems related to gasoline engines better than anyone the cast members know about.  He has great respect for decent people and a powerful need to see justice in action.  He can think clearly if given a longer than normal interval to work on it.  He has been called mildly mentally retarded, but his behavior suggests a need to consider that he might be autistic.  At age twelve, Karl discovered a man ""having his way"" with his mother.  He flew into a rage and went for his family's sling blade, a heavy, double-edged and hooked brush-cutting tool.  He used the sling blade to decapitate the man.  This made his mother furious, so Karl used the sling blade again to decapitate her.  This event caused Karl to be moved into a mental institution.  Twenty five years later, he is found harmless to society and is released.  He wanders about and comes across Frank (Lucas Black), a young boy who likes the unique sound of Karl's voice.  Karl and Frank seem to understand each other and they become inseparable friends.  Frank introduces Karl to his mother Linda (Natalie Canerday)and after an adjustment period, Karl begins to live with Linda and Frank.  Linda is a widow with an abusive boyfriend Doyle (Dwight Yoakum) who abuses Linda in bursts of outrage and develops behavior toward Frank that seems life-threatening to Karl.  Karl's strong need to see justice done for decent people competes with his need to avoid what got him into a mental institution many years ago.  After the interval of time needed to think about Frank's home situation, the competition is over and a decision is made.  This movie is a real corker. There is much to laugh at and cheer about.  Thornton's acting as Karl is close to unbelievable.  There is strong, life-and-death action involved that is revealed only in the sound track.",1382918400,8,1995,4.780701754385965

207741,5,5554452574,"This is the independent film that Billy Bob Thornton put together during the darkest years of his quest to become successful. It is the film noir that eventually put him on the Hollywood map. It tells the story of Karl Childers, a moron who thirty years earlier, in a fit of rage, had killed his mother and her lover with a single swing of a sling blade.

As the movie begins, Childers is being released from ""the insane asylum&#34 in a small Arkansas town; and as a result of a chance encounter, befriends a young lad name Frank. They proceed to establish an unbreakable human bond, as Karl in due course moves into Frank's parents house and is slowly force to tell the details and circumstances that led to the murders. Doyle, Frank's mother's boyfriend, is the evil force that animates the movie. That is the context. The subtext, and in my view, the genius of the film is that it depicts ""a true slice of Arkansas, thus American life:&#34. It does so without apologies, without the gaudy but false ""Gone with the wind"" racist sentimentalities, without the normal Hollywood commercial demands -- all given without apologies. It is a melodramatic ""grace note"" about Arkansan life.

Thornton is from Alpine, Arkansas, and grew up around Arkadelphia. The movie is tense, tightly written, honest and has an impending existential absurdity and urgency about it that keeps the audience on its toes. Billy Bob won an Oscar for best Adapted Screenplay; and the movie was also nominated for best film for 1996. It represents the highest level creativity that Hollywood has to offer, and thus is unforgettable artistry. Ten Stars",1369958400,,1622,4.830935251798561

207784,5,5554452574,"I am astounded at the obvious careful research and intense effort made by Billy Bob Thornton in the movie, ""SLING BLADE"".

The portrayal is absolutely and uncannily accurate.

I know, because I've very unfortunately ""been there, done that"".

When I was a boy, my parents couldn't control me, so I was committed to a state mental hospital, where I endured years of horror.

When eventually released as an adult, I was just like the character in the movie, unbelievably awkward and uneducated, with a psyche that was twisted by the influence of close association with criminals, deviants, and perverts.

Fortunately (indeed, VERY fortunately!), I was blessed to become a convert in The Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter-day Saints, where young men literally took me physically by the hand and taught me how to walk like a normal human being, and speak in a normal tone of voice.

Also, because the war in Viet Nam was controversial, and so many guys were refusing to serve in the military, I was able to volunteer to be drafted (something that's no longer done) into the United States Army, which offered previously undreamed of opportunities for personal redemption and advancement.

So, based on my own personal knowledge and experience, I very highly recommend this movie!",1357430400,2,1272,4.971698113207547

207811,3,5554452574,"This is one of those sloooow moving films that would be twice as good if it was half as long. It's an interesting story and the actors do a good job, but the setting -- small town south -- is dark and depressing.

The movie opens on the day Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton) is to be released from the state hospital as ""cured."" He's been there since he was twelve and chopped up his mother and her lover with a sling blade. We learn that he had a perfectly horrible childhood, and is at least mildly retarded. Mostly, he never had a chance to be normal with the parents he had.

But the hospital is letting him out because he's cured, and he has nowhere to go. He returns to his childhood home town, but has no urge to see his abusive and apparently psychotic father. When he finally does go, the father is played by Robert Duvall, and is at least as screwed up as Karl always said he was.

Sitting outside the local laundromat eating some french fried pertaters, he sees little Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) struggling with four laundry bags, and asks him how far he has to go with them. Frank says it's 'bout half a mile, and Karl offers to help him carry the bags. Karl and Frank strike up a rather strange friendship, because Frank is probably smarter than Karl, and certainly more knowledgeable.

Frank, however, has a problem. His mother, Linda Wheatley (Natalie Canerday) has a boyfriend who is abusive, Doyle Hargreves (Dwight Yoakam). He's especially bad when he gets drunk, and then apologizes and Linda takes him back. A horribly familiar story.

Karl's doctor asked a friend of his to hire Karl to work on machinery, which Karl did at the hospital and had a natural talent. His boss lets him sleep in the shed in the back, but before long Frank and Linda invite him to live in their garage. Doyle, of course, hates the idea. But it's Linda's house, so there's not much he can do except curse out all and sundry.

So that's the set-up. And it plays out much as one could predict not long after seeing Doyle in one of his drunken rages. Like I said, it could be a great deal shorter.",1336694400,,2094,4.397932816537468
207812,4,5554452574,"Only a few films turn their unknown creators into stars with a Hollywood career.  There was Sylvester Stallone, who wrote and played ""Rocky"", 1976 Best Picture Oscar, his star turn a condition for allowing that script to be filmed.  Similar for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, their original screenplay for ""Good Will Hunting"" winning a 1997 Oscar, both of them stars for playing the parts they wrote.  Stallone, Damon and Affleck never insisted upon directing themselves.

Billy Bob Thornton was more ambitious, directing, writing and starring in ""Sling Blade"", winning the 1996 Oscar for Best  Screenplay.

""Sling Blade"" may not be for everyone's taste, irrelevant to me.  I'm here to review the Blu-ray.

If modern film creators wished to intentionally defeat Blu-ray high definition, they have a perfect model in ""Sling Blade"".  The story is about Karl, a mentally challenged murderer being released from state hospital, 25 years after he killed his mother and her lover.

Karl can't stand being in the light, so Director Billy Bob Thornton and other characters do everything possible to accommodate Karl, as played by Billy Bob Thornton.

Lighting goes from poor to even worse, both for interiors and exteriors.  No blue skies ever, entirely appropriate for such a dark story, just what Karl prefers.

Also lacking is ""hard focus"", which brings out the best in Blu-ray close-ups.  ""Sling Blade"" seems entirely shot in ""soft focus"", another blow against Blu-ray high definition.

I make no issue over this ""Sling Blade"" Blu-ray failing to display outstanding color and vividness, normally the mark of any modern Blu-ray in Technicolor.  Obviously Billy Bob Thornton the director filmed himself and his story in the appropriate manner for such a tale.  He couldn't have known his lighting and focus would improve relatively little in Blu-ray, a new format yet to be established when this film came out in 1996.  Doubtful if Thornton would have cared.

So among categories where Blu-ray isn't much of an improvement over standard definition DVDs, there is ""Director's Intent"", as demonstrated by ""Sling Blade"".  I will review films in other categories unfriendly to Blu-ray High Definition, including Black and White, Animation, and early Technicolor.

If you appreciate this marvelous, unique film, please lower your Blu-ray expectations.  I could be proven wrong by other Blu-ray editions of ""Sling Blade"", if brought to my attention as comments.  In that case I will change this review.",1336348800,2,2487,5.209068010075566

207817,4,5554452574,"That Thornton wrote and directed this film proves he has as much going on inside himself as there is inside the so-called retarded main man of Sling Blade, Karl. Karl appears not to have noticed or heard what is said or done but it always comes out later that he heard and saw all. He is obviously autistic, yet to my mind not as impaired as other apparently normal people. I am somewhat dubious that he could have found persons, on his release from the mental hospital, that were sensitive and tolerant of his oddness. The fix-it man who gives him a job, for instance. It is surprising to find such understanding and delicacy in a rural town. We do not see Karl meeting more people than we are shown in the film, and those he does meet takes calmly his admission that he killed his mother and her lover. No one looks at him in suspicion and fear, and in this sense I think Thornton has kept his cast shrunken in order to maintain simplicity. I wanted a better excuse for Frank's mother to allow her abusive boyfriend to keep coming around. Seeing how the boyfriend was scarring her son, whom Karl has befriended or who has befriended him, I wished Thornton had built a sounder reason for the boyfriend's hold. But the boy Frank is a winner. He comes across as sweet, articulate, and one day a worthy adult.",1333411200,,1307,4.427385892116183

207823,4,5554452574,"This movie stars Karl who is a mentally disabled man released from a mental institution after having served some years for killing his mother and her lover. Karl is a genius at fixing small engines so after having been released from the institution, the head of the ward gets Karl a job at a friend's small engine shop fixing up lawnmowers and the likes.

The movie plays out a bit unrealistically in my opinion for various reasons. First off, the entire movie is about Karl who befriends a boy. While that is fine, I don't think any sane parent, especially a single mother who works six days a week, would allow a mentally disabled man, who for reasons unknown to her was just released from an institution. In my opinion, any parent would not trust their child with a complete stranger, much less someone who was just released from a mental institution. After Karl having told the mother why he was released from the institution, she allowed the relationship to continue because she ""knows he won't kill again.""

Of course, this movie is placed in a small town, so perhaps people are forgiving there but I don't think any parent would be so open to allowing such a relationship to occur.

In any event, the movie plays out Karl developing this friendship with this boy. They learn a lot about each other, and a lot about life itself. The one problem in the boy's life is his mother's boyfriend, Doyle. The boys father committed suicide and his mother is left to work a minimum wage job. So they have it hard but get by and what makes it worse is the fact that she has an abusive alcoholic boyfriend.

By the end of the movie, Karl, in his mind, believes that for the boy and mother to be happy, he has to rid of them of this Doyle. The movie ends sort of like Taxi in my opinion. Karl comes in, kills Doyle in a horrific manner, then they never show whether or not the mother is happy or not. However, to Karl, they are and we'll never know other than develop speculations as to whether or not his actions did any good.

The movie was good. However, what really did this movie for me was this scene where Doyle invited all his drunken friends over. About midway through the night after heavy drinking, they're all sitting there in the living room talking about a band song. Suddenly, out of no where, Doyle goes ape. At first he throws a beer out the window, then he goes insane where he's giving this speech about everyone. It's so hilarious that at first it caught me off guard and I had to rewind it to see the full benefit of it. I just couldn't stop laughing and it was the most funniest thing I have ever seen in a movie in a very long time. This scene, while hilarious, also shows the frustration that the mother and boy have and the boy even goes crazy and starts beating on Doyle where he's then throwing things at him. It was hilarious.

If this scene did not occur, I probably give this movie a 3 star, but the scene has certainly increased my likeness of the movie. I would suggest watching this movie solely for that scene cause it's hilarious.",1322265600,,3058,4.393992932862191
207824,5,5554452574,"Billy Bob Thornton's ""Sling Blade"" from 1996 is one of the very best movies I have ever seen (or ever will see). It's a complete treasure from the first scene until the last. The whole cast is simply wonderful, from Mr. Thornton all the way down the line.

Many of the scenes in the movie are filmed by Director Thornton as static shots, with the camera not budging one inch as the actors go about their task of performing the scene, versus cutting back and forth from one camera angle to another.

This type of 'locked down' approach that was utilized in several scenes is a good one too, in my opinion, giving the viewer a chance to see all of the actors in the scene at the same time for an extended period. I wish more movies would employ that same type of shooting technique more often.

By way of its marvelous writing, stellar performances, and its understated and simple musical score, ""Sling Blade"" is probably one of the most powerful and emotionally heart-tugging films ever made. (At least it is for me.) And if you're not choking back tears near the end of this movie, then you must not be human.

207827,5,5554452574,"I don't know how it happened, but I somehow completely missed the previews and reviews for Sling Blade when it was first released back in the mid 90's.  I consider the storytelling right up there with the very best of them including Forest Gump, Castaway, Gran Turino or anything else.  It's extremely compelling and nothing about the pacing or storyline drags or feels awkwardly out of place or anything of that nature.  Truly an original concept too.

It's about a mentally challenged man (Billy Bob Thorton's character) being released from a mental institution after being responsible for a horrific murder, and sets foot in a small town and makes friends with a few of the townspeople.  The one thing that totally blows my mind every time I watch the film is how Billy Bob Thorton absolutely *nails* his performance here.  He's most certainly NOT one of my favorite actors, and I had no idea he had the talent to pull off such a believable character, but... he makes it work.  Nothing else I've ever seen him play in captures the same kind of entertainment either.  If this was his one shining moment of glory, well, it was a darn good one.

The storyline is told brilliantly.  There's never any downtime whatsoever because you're completely attached to the television screen.  Is this film seriously over 2 hours long?  It honestly didn't feel like it.

Some will complain that it doesn't make sense for an unstable man with such a violent history being released into society, and well, I can't blame people for thinking this way.  Truth is, it probably doesn't make sense and I was even thinking about it while watching it this afternoon.  I was thinking ""Alright, he really shouldn't be granted freedom, haha""  but for the sake of an interesting storyline in a movie, I don't mind one bit.

What makes the film so darn irresistible is the way you, the viewer, learns how to understand and rationalize with people who are different from you.  There seems to be a strong moral to the story that you should respect others and try your hardest to get along with them the best you can despite not being able to understand them in the slightest, or agree with their ways.  In this case, a mentally challenged man and a homosexual character (played by John Ritter, ANOTHER big name actor with perhaps the greatest performance of his career).

Anyway, there's an abusive husband who's no good whatsoever- a total scumbag in fact, and he plays a crucial part in the storyline.

I got a lot out of Sling Blade, and I believe you will as well.  It's a simiple story told without any confusion- it flows wonderfully while being extremely easy to grasp.  I highly recommend it.",1311120000,5,2671,4.696774193548387

If you liked that, you may enjoy this.  I just kept yelling ""WHAT?"" at the unmotivated actions of the characters.

From the first incident, in which a middle-aged formerly homicidal mental patient, incarcerated since the age of 12, is released into society with NO placement services and is expected to fend for himself, right through to the signaled-way-ahead-of-time totally predictable ending, this is just an illogical mess.

""Oh, you've just been released from a mental institution, have struck up a friendship with my adolescent son, and need a place to stay?  Well, by all means, move in with US!""

207832,2,5554452574,"Billy Bob Thornton stars as Karl, a man who gets released from a mental institution after being there for 30 years.  Yet... the people in charge don't bother to point him in the right direction by providing living arrangements or a line of work.  Only when Karl comes back to the institution later in the day of his release, saying he wants to return, does the head coordinator ask in bewilderment, ""You mean you have no family to stay with?"" (paraphrasing, of course).  Funny that after spending that much time in confinement, the coordinator is somehow completely in the dark about Karl's [lack of] family ties.  Unsure of what to do, the man takes Karl back to his private home.  Two extremely unrealistic turns of events, and we're only 40 minutes in.

Thornton's acting gets tiring after awhile, and almost seems like a comedy routine.  The acting overall is subpar, with dialogue that comes across as disingenuous.  There are numerous adult roles in this movie, yet the only characters with any sense are Karl and Frank (the young boy).  Attempts at comedy relief end up being contrived. They must have had a limited budget because Thornton wears the same clothing throughout the ENTIRE movie.

*spoiler ahead*

This string of simple and sometimes silly events are told through Karl at his pace and understanding.  This story is about trust and the abuse that does not leave scars.
  In 1955 a retarded adult neighbor named Ike played baseball with us in our small Illinois town.  He lived in a shack with an elderly couple without utilities.  They were not his parents but just some people who took him in.  He was invited to our birthday parties because he never got ice cream.  He was big, scary and drooled but there was a place for him until the old people died.  We had out grown Ike and at my first Thanksgiving home from college I learned that he had gone to an institution and soon died there.  No one knew why.

207856,5,5554452574,"Billy Bob Thornton is a perfect example of a starving actor who came from Arkansas with a friend and despite having a few appearances on television and film, it was not until 1996 when the actor's short film and screenplay known as ""Some Folks Call it a Sling Blade"" was adapted to a full-feature film.  Written and directed by Thornton (""Monster's Ball"", ""Eagle Eye"", ""Mr. Woodcock"", ""The Alamo"", ""Bad Santa"", etc.), ""Sling Blade"" was the film that launched his career and earn him an Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and a nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role and receive critical acclaim.

Shot with a small budget of uner a $1,000,000, the independent film would earn over $24 million domestically at the box office and would become a big hit worldwide.

The film would star John Ritter (""8 Simple Rules...For Dating My Teenage Daughter"", ""Three's Company"", ""Clifford"", etc.),  J.T. Walsh (""The Negotiator"", ""Pleasantville"" and ""Nixon""), Country singer Dwight Yoakam (""Crank"" and ""Panic Room""), Lucas Black (""The Miracle Worker"", ""Friday Night Lights"", ""Jarhead"", etc.), Natalie Canerday (""Walk the Line"" and ""October Sky"") and Robert Duvall (""The Godfather"", Days of Thunder"" and ""Colors"").

VIDEO & AUDIO:

It's important to let people know that this film was an Independent film made for under a million dollars and shot in 24 days.  In fact, during the filming, the producers didn't have all the money set while filming ""Sling Blade"", so this is not exactly a film to expect caliber film material used during filming.

""Sling Blade"" is featured on High Definition for the first time.  The film receives a 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio) transfer and for the most part, the film looks good on Blu-ray.  For a film that is 15 years old, there are parts with occasional dust but for a classic film, Miramax has opted for no DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) and kept the grain intact.  I do feel that Billy Bob Thornton found a very good director with Barry Markowitz to capture the feel of a small town.  Capturing the detail of the shop that Karl works at to the look and feel of the film that makes you wonder if it's late 1950's America or modern America.  Of course, it's the latter but the fact is that Thornton with Markowitz are able to capture look and feel of that small town quite well on film.  Could it have been better if they using high end equipment, possibly.  But for what they had at their disposal with the small budget they had to work with, you can't help but be proud at what this crew was able to accomplish.

As for audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital).  The film is definitely dialogue driven. This is not a film with sound effects or a film that will utilize the entire soundscape.  But what was important for Billy Bob Thornton was to capture the audio and making sure that sound was clear (especially during Robert Duvall's scene) and most of all, the music of Daniel Lanois was used effectively.  There is a featurette dedicated to the use of music in the film but for the most part, this is a front and center channel driven film.

It's important to note that with this Blu-ray release, picture quality is much clearer.  Where the original DVD has its share of digital compression artifacts, it not as prominent on the Blu-ray release.  Also, the lossless soundtrack is clear and pristine and definitely, watching this film on HD was awesome!

Subtitles featured are in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Sling Blade"" comes with the following special features featured in 480i Standard Definition and English 2.0 Dolby Digital:

  *
  * Audio Commentary by Writer/Director/Actor Billy Bob Thornton - A very informative commentary by Billy Bob Thornton.  Who goes into detail of how certain shots were created.  The talents on the film and shooting with a low budget with a tight schedule.  Overall, a very enjoyable commentary.
  * Mr. Thornton Goes To Hollywood - (1:06:51) A featurette about Billy Bob Thornton's rise to fame.  From living in Arkansas and he and a friend moving to California and living with little money, Thornton working odd jobs and eventually getting a job at Shakey's pizza and his struggles as an actor.  Interviews with people close to Thornton including friends, former girlfriend that is a producer and many others who give us an idea of what kind of man Billy Bob Thornton is.
  * Bravo Profiles: Billy Bob Thornton - (43:24) An older featurette that features Billy Bob Thornton during the time he was married with Angelina Jolie.  Interviews with Matt Damon, Angelina and other talents and people who have worked with Billy Bob.  I have to admit, this featurette took place during a time when he and Angelina Jolie were a hot couple and with a really good featurette with ""Mr. Thornton Goes to Hollywood"", this is one featurette I wouldn't mind if it was cut out.  It's more or less a rehash of the previous featurette but with interviews with his now ex-wife and a few other talents.
  * A Roundtable Discussion with Billy Bob Thornton, Dwight Yoakam, Mickey Jones and Producer David Bushell - (1 hr., 15 min.) A very cool roundtable with everyone talking about their memories of the film ten years later.  From how Lucas Black was cast, their memories of John Ritter and J.T. Walsh, shooting on a small budget and in 24-days, hiring his high school buddy Rick Dial for the film and how he has appeared in other films since then, working with Robert Duvall and also discussing about the one person in Hollywood who disliked the film and the script.  An all out, no holds barred roundtable discussion.  Very entertaining to watch.
  * A Conversation with Billy Bob Thornton and Robert Duvall - (8:31) Billy Bob Thornton's movie legends was Robert Duvall and so Billy Bob talked about how he met Robert and how they have enjoyed working with each other.  Robert Duvall remembers working with Thornton especially the place that they ate.
  * A Conversation with Robert Duvall - (7:35) Robert Duvall talks about working with Billy Bob Thornton and why the film worked.
  * A Conversation with Billy Bob Thornton and Composer Daniel Lanois - (22:59) Featuring Daniel Lanois performing ""Omni"" and an interview how Billy Bob Thornton came to select Daniel to create the music for the film, how Daniel enjoyed creating the music for the film and working with Billy Bob and more.  Also, creating music for certain scenes and their favorite musical scene in the film.
  * The Return of Karl - (3:40) A rehearsal of Billy Bob on the set as Karl (improvising with crew).
  * On the Set: There are a total of three small featurettes in this segment.  Billy Bob at Work (4:39) which is behind-the-scenes footage of Billy Bob working with his cinematographer.  Doyle's Bad: The Johnsons (1:44) the filming of that scene when the band is playing.  Doyle Gets Pummeled (1:53) - Watching the filming of the intense scene when Doyle gets drunk and Frank defends his mother.
  * ""Doyle's Dead"" with Introduction by Billy Bob Thornton - (4:23) A scene that was shot with two of the band members from the Johnson's trying to make music after the death of Doyle.  There is an introduction by Billy Bob Thornton and why he did use this segment in the film.

EASTER EGG:

When watching the ""Mr. Thornton Goes to Hollywood"" featurette. About 52:08 minutes into the featurette, a white silhouette featuring Karl sitting in a recliner will show up. Click on that symbol and sure enough a 21: second video features Billy Bob Thornton as Karl and Lucas Black as Frank starts playing.

JUDGMENT CALL:

There is no doubt that ""Sling Blade"" is a powerful and magnificent performance by Billy Bob Thornton.

This was a film that was planned very well and Billy Bob Thornton has discussed shooting the film in 24 days, writing the film in 9 writing days and shooting the film for over $900,000.  This is Independent filmmaking at its finest.  The ability to create a film that feels so natural, to shoot in a town that just feels right for the film and to cast well-known stars that you don't realize who they are until a few minutes later and realize that Doyle is Dwight Yoakam and Vaughan is John Ritter and of course, to see this transformation of Billy Bob Thornton to Karl is amazing.

Needless to say, this film is a true masterpiece and screenwriting at its best.  Rarely do you see a film written, directed and starring an actor that would receive such worldwide critical acclaim, shot on a shoestring budget and to be enjoyed by so many people.

And here we are with the Blu-ray release that pretty much marks nearly the 15th year anniversary of the film.  It's important to note that this release is NOT the same as the 10th Anniversary Original Cut which is about 148 minutes long.  This is the theatrical cut which works perfectly.  The Original Cut just went too long and I'm glad Miramax opted for the theatrical cut.

So, for those who are wondering if it's worth the double dip, especially if you own the 10th Anniversary DVD, my answer is yes.  You get the film in High Definition video and the lossless soundtrack.  Granted, this film was a low-budget independent film but the detail is much more clearer than its DVD counterpart and the lossless soundtrack is much more clearer, especially the music of Daniel Lanois.  For the most part, the same special features from the 10th Anniversary DVD release are included on this Blu-ray.  I would not discard the 10th Anniversary DVD because that version is the ""original cut"" at 148 minutes.  I do prefer the theatrical cut featured on the Blu-ray at 135 minutes.

If there was anything that I wish was included on the Blu-ray is the short film ""Some Folks Call it a Sling Blade"" which stars Billy Bob Thornton and Molly Ringwald.  It would have been nice to see the short film which inspired the adaptation to a full-length film.

Overall, ""SLING BLADE"" is a film that is solidified itself as a movie classic.  A film that will touch people on many different layers due to its brilliant performances from the film's talents, a film that need not be filmed in metropolitan city but capturing the small town Americana feel in Arkansas, showing us that a film does not need a tremendous amount of money to create a major film but that this film is just fresh, unique and for the most part, a brilliant masterpiece from Billy Bob Thornton.

""SLING BLADE"" is highly recommended!",1249430400,11,10505,4.742557883131202
207857,5,5554452574,"I just saw this movie for the first time this afternoon, and I was hooked. Sometimes, I can get distracted and will play around on my ipod touch, or find other things to do while watching television shows or movies, but I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen with this one. From the second the movie started, to the very end, I was totally sucked in.

Billy Bob Thornton as Karl was brilliant as a mentally disabled man. I don't think he was retarded; in fact, some of his behavior reminded me of Aspergers. As he gets out of a mental hospital, after being imprisoned for nearly three decades after killing his mother and her young bed partner, he doesn't exactly want to leave. He doesn't know where to go or what to do. He meets a young, fatherless boy named Frank, played by Lucas Black, and helps him carry home laundry from the laundromat. He and this boy get attached very quickly, and after being introduced to his mother, he is invited to stay with them.

Unfortunately, a horrible man terrorizes Frank and his mother: her boyfriend Doyle, played by Dwight Yoakum. He is abusive, and threatens death if Frank's mother, Linda, leaves him. He is a drunk, who brings his untalented band of yahoos (hilariously played by talented musicians Mickey Jones, Col. Bruce Hampton, Ian Moore and Vic Chestnutt) around in the middle of the night and plays loudly, annoying the neighbors. He breaks things in Linda's house, sleeps with other women, treats Karl, Frank, and Linda's friend Vaughan like they are lower than dirt, and treats Linda even worse. (She has a battered woman complex, for sure.) So, after causing all of this turmoil and pain, when he comes around and apologizes, she just lets him right back into their lives.

After hearing Frank's thoughts that he would like to take Doyle out of the picture, Karl comes to believe that the only way to ensure Frank and his mother's safety and happiness is to kill Doyle himself. He gives all of his books to Frank, and makes him promise that he will take his mother and go to Vaughan's house that evening. He gives all of the money he made at his job to Vaughan, telling him to give it to Frank and Linda to help out, and makes him promise that he will watch over the two and be a good father to Frank. He then sharpens a lawn mower blade, goes to Linda's house, and kills Doyle with it.

It was a wonderful story that you will not stop thinking about for hours after watching it. Heck, I have been all over Amazon and IMDB reading all of the summaries and opinions about it all evening! I could not judge Karl for what he did to Doyle. While that would not have been my course of action, you could see how this is the best he could come up with. Things were black and white, and this was all he knew. He loved Frank so much that he wanted him to be happy and safe, and this is the only way he thought he could do this. Doyle was friends with the police, which put him in a position where the law was on his side. And, as anyone who has dealt with someone even half as bad as Doyle, things like restraining orders just do not work. Karl also seemed very overwhelmed with the outside world, and he really wanted to go back to the hospital where he spent most of his life. The movie ends with Karl back in the asylum, where he will likely spend the rest of his life. But at least now, his life is richer for having found Frank, and being able to give him a better shot at happiness and safety gave Karl a sense of purpose to at least somebody.",1248652800,,3498,4.327743902439025
207858,5,5554452574,"""Sling Blade"" (1996) is an acting tour de force for Billy Bob Thornton who wrote, directed, and starred in this powerful film. Thornton's Karl is an unforgettable character creation with a gangly, sloping walk, head down, almost like a hunchback, make-up that turns the face into a primordial caveman, a jutting chin, a halting voice with constant ""uh-hums,"" and a conversational mode that is simplistic and spare.
 At the beginning of the film Karl is in a mental institution where he has been placed after killing his mother and her lover when he was a twelve-year old. He's mentally retarded and has become a reader (especially of The Bible) while incarcerated. We see him silently listening and tolerating the constant disturbing talk of another inmate, played by J.T. Walsh, who is a psychopath reliving and wallowing in his own crimes.
 When his time is up, and Karl is gauged ""safe,"" he has to face the outside world. He goes back to his town where he befriends a teenage boy, Frank. Karl and the boy bond, and the boy's mother Linda lets Karl sleep in a garage bedroom. Unfortunately the mother has an abusive and nasty boyfriend who hates the boy and Karl. Linda has a supportive gay friend played by John Ritter.
 If a man like Karl showed up at my bedroom door in the middle of the night with a hammer in his hand and asked to be baptized, I would have sent him packing, but the next scene is an under-the-water baptism for Karl.
In talking to the boy Karl reveals something he did at age eight on orders from his mother and father. This and Karl's final action may make the audience uneasy, in an awkward position, a moral dilemma. Are we to view this movie as just a case study, are we to judge Karl's actions by a moral standard, or are we to be sympathetic towards this person? What, indeed, are we to do as audience members? He seems to know right from wrong, but does he really? He seems like a gentle, kindly man, but he's a time bomb set to go off.
It's a brilliant movie, one that will hold your attention even with its melodrama and questionable position or lack of it on Karl's actions.",1247443200,,2108,4.4986945169712795
207859,5,5554452574,"This is a masterpiece that will play with your emotions. This Oscar winner stars Academy Award winning Billy Bob Thornton as `Karl', a grown man that gets discharged from a institution and develops a strong new friendship with a fatherless boy.

Karl learns about the boys family concerns, which leads Karl to help in the only way he has experience with.

This film also has John Ritter, Robert Duvall, J.T. Walsh and Grammy Award winner Dwight Yoakam.

Billy Bob Thornton not only starred in this film, ... he wrote and directed it too. His character as `Karl' was absolutely magnificent.

I highly recommend buying or renting this movie. You won't regret it.

This is one of the DVD's in my personal movie collection. It's a keeper.

When you see it, you'll know what part I was referring to.  It was powerful for me and I believed him.  And that is one of many parts of the film that resonated with me and rang true and believable.

207865,5,5554452574,"Slingblade offers a very touching look at the relationship between a mentally ill man and a young boy who seemingly needs any semblance of a father figure in his life. Billy Bob Thornton acts so well in the film that he physically doesn't resemble himself.  The late great Jon Ritter offers little masculine comfort to the boy as he is gay in the film, but provides priceless moments in his attempts to understand this mentally ill man who has forged a bond with a family he holds dear. All the while, Doyle (the mother's boyfriend) provides some of the funniest and despicable moments in film with his conservative red-neck views on all things. Inevitably Billy Bob Thornton's character callously succumbs to the beckoning of his nature and kills again for what he believes are the right reasons.  His strong sense of misdirected justice draws you in and leaves you to question whether or not he should be blamed. A powerful film that I use for instruction.  It is entertaining from the word go, and a jewel in film seldom discussed.",1239840000,,1034,4.733333333333333

While the film makes an important statement, it certainly should be recognized for the wonderful telling of beautiful story with an unfortunate ending.

207867,5,5554452574,"The film starts with Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton) being released from the State Hospital (a mental ward) and telling his story to two young college student reporters.  Karl is retarded, and spent his childhood in a dirt-floored shed in back of his parents house - they didn't want him in the house and treated him like an animal they'd picked up.  Around the age of ten or twelve he caught his mother having sex with a bully from his school and he mistakenly thought his mother was being raped.  So he killed the boy, Jesse Dickson, with a sling blade.  When he found out his mother ""didn't mind what Jesse was a'doin to her"", he killed her too.

Freshly released from the hospital, Karl returns to his hometown but ""doesn't know how to be a free man"".  He helps a young boy, Frank (Lucas Black) carry his laundry home and the two become fast friends.  He gets a job, with help, working at a small engine repair shop.  Karl is like an idiot-savant, hardly able to live on his own but a genius at fixing small engines.  ""Lawnmowers and whatnot"".  Frank's mother Linda (Natalie Canerday) invites Karl to stay in their garage instead of out in back of the repair shop, so Karl moves in.

There's just one problem.  Linda's boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam) is a mean, intolerant man.  He hates Frank, and abuses Linda and Frank verbally nonstop.  He doesn't like a ""mental retard"" living in Linda's garage.  He also doesn't like Linda's best friend Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), the gay manager of the dollar store Linda works at.  Doyle can't even get along with his own friends.

'Sling Blade' is the story of Karl's ""free"" life and his friendship with Frank.  It's a story of awakenings, one that will leave you breathless with the beauty of it.  It's about the purest form of love, and the ugliest side of domestic abuse.  I was deeply moved by the hidden bravery of Vaughan, who's terrified of Doyle but stands up for Linda and Frank even though he knows he's incapable of physically defending them.  There's the quiet reflectiveness of Karl, who's spent a lifetime inside his own head and now has to deal with people on a daily basis.  You'll see the ""battered women's syndrome"" in Linda, a kind soul who only sees the beauty in every person, even Doyle.  And there's the viciousness of Doyle, from his everyday spoken words to his threats to beat and kill Linda, Frank, and Vaughan.

The acting in this movie is outstanding.  Billy Bob Thornton, who also wrote and directed the movie, is amazing as Karl.  He's honestly captured the motions, speech, and spirit of the mentally challenged Karl.  And where the heck did Dwight Yoakam learn to act so well?  He gives a stunning performance as the sadistic Doyle, he makes the role as real as life, an absolutely amazing performance.  Yoakam's performance and Thornton's writing really captured the unexpected violence of the domestic abuser, the ""walking on eggshells"" routine those around them must live.  Yoakam and Thornton are both naturals in front of the camera.  There's also a short cameo appearance by Robert Duvall as Karl's father.

The question is, can Karl save Linda and Frank from a life of abuse under Doyle's cruel behavior?  In the end, will he sacrifice himself for them?  Just how much love does Karl have for the boy he's become so attached to?

I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  It's a low budget film that introduced Billy Bob Thornton into the filmmaking industry, as a writer, director, and actor.  The talent in this film is astonishing.  It's never dull or slow.  This is a film I believe that everyone should watch, no matter what your genre preferences are.  Ten Stars!

That said; `Sling Blade' broke my heart in many places due to the fact that it is both of those things; depressing and sentimental.  I would be a liar if I didn't say that there were also facets of this film that didn't work so well for me, but in all honestly they are few indeed.

The film starts of extremely strong with one of the most disturbing yet most engaging line readings I have ever seen, as we meet Karl for the first time while he's listening to Charles Bushman, a fellow mental institution inmate, reciting one of his lurid tales.  J.T. Walsh, the actor who plays Bushman, is so convincing that he literally gave me chills.

Hands down one of the best cameo performances by an actor in recent memory.

The film only escalates from there, as Karl is released from his prison after serving many years for murdering his mother and her lover.  He is released into society, back to his home town, amongst people that don't understand him or accept him.  That is until he meets a young boy named Frank; a sweet child who is living under the harsh rule of his mother's boyfriend Doyle.  Frank and Karl instantly bond, and Frank's mother Linda is grateful, offering her garage to Karl and welcoming him into her life.  Doyle is less than enthused and thus begins a stricter more controlling reign of terror on Linda and Frank, imposing as much as possible to drive wedges into their newfound happiness.

I am intrigued by the films approach to the subject of love and loyalty, because when the film shakes down to the last few frames it is really all about the sacrifices we make in order to protect the ones we love; even if it means that we have to destroy ourselves.  By making the lead character mentally handicapped the films proves that love is something innate and human, not something learned and or spawned from education or conditioning.  Love is something that is inside us waiting to come out.  There is no way that one can say Karl's love for Frank is anything but pure, for he has no outside influence manipulating his thinking.

The film has been likened to `To Kill a Mockingbird' in its depiction of murder, just or unjust.  I see the similarities, but I'm not too quick to call them myself.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' in my opinion raised a few more questions and answered them a little smoother, but that isn't to say that `Sling Blade' doesn't do a fine job at what it sets out to do.

When Karl explains where he came from, why he's here, what he remembers about who he is; I mean I don't see how anyone could be anything less than moved with pity.  This brings me to my one major fault with the film; Billy Bob Thornton.  Thornton is a very good actor, I will not take that away from him, but here he falls into `Hanks' territory, delivery a gimmick and relying to heavily on back-story to create his character.  He's unrecognizable in sight and sound, yet I never really saw a real transformation.  It all felt like surface to me.  When he goes into his longwinded speeches of his horrible life I am moved and I almost teared up, but it felt as though I was reading a book, not witnessing the atrocities.

Thornton never truly took me there.

Everything else about the film is stellar to me.  The pacing, the direction, the mood and even the score and soundtrack (which at first was a little off putting) ultimately proves itself strong and engaging.  The balance of the performances are also strong.  Lucas Black is wonderful as Frank.  He beautifully balances his feelings of calm around Karl and then repressed and anxious around Doyle.  Dwight Yoakam is also very effective as the hateful and cruel Doyle, infecting the screen with his detestable nature.  John Ritter has a nice turn (R.I.P.) and Natalie Canerday is heartbreaking as the desperate and ultimately trapped Linda.

In the end I would be lying if I said that `Sling Blade' wasn't moving, for it is.  It takes one to a dark place and allows them to witness ones desperate attempt to remove themselves from it; and we are able to see one trying fervently to save as many as he can from falling into the same trap.  I really wish that I felt a stronger connection to Thornton here, but it's not as if he is drastically detached from the audience.  I'm a little baffled by his Oscar nomination, but then again, they gave Hanks an Oscar.  Thornton does a masterful job directing and writing here, and his success in these two areas help make up for his inability to connect as an actor.",1224460800,,4667,4.514285714285714

I liked the original theatrical release enormously. Yet when I viewed this ""director's cut"" I was disappointed.

207876,5,5554452574,"To me, Sling Blade is byfar Billy Bob Thorton's best performance in a movie to date. Not only did Billy Bob star in it, he also written and directed it as well. Billy Bob has a pretty good set of co-stars staring with him such as John Ritter, a young Lucas Black, Dwight Yoakam, JT Walsh, & Robert Duvall.

Thorton plays a middle aged mental patient named Karl Childers. Early in his childhood, Karl would kill his mother and her lover which would make him to go and live at a mental institution where he stay for the better part of his life. After Karl gets released from the institution, he soon makes his way back to his hometown where he gets a steady job as a mechanic and also befriends Frank (Lucas Black).

Frank is a young boy who lives with his mother and her alcoholic boyfriend named Dole (Dwight Yoakam). Frank soon introduces Karl to his mother and her gay best friend (John Ritter) at her job. Frank's mother would then allow Karl to stay with Frank, Dole, and herself. After meeting Karl, Dole would cause a load of trouble throughout the duration of Karl's stay.

Karl would soon become a regular member of the family after a while. Karl opens up a lot by spending time with this good ol' family. Frank and his mother would do everything to try to get Karl to fit in with them. Frank would take Karl to play football and even settin up a blind date for Karl. Yeah Karl had a pretty good life stay with Frank which made Dole furious hafter seeing all of the attention Frank and his mother was giving Karl.

Throughout Karl's stay with Frank, he soon becomes a father figure for Frank by protecting him and his mother from the evil doings of the abusive Dole.

After a while, Karl ventures out one day and comes across his old house where he confronts his father. Karl asks him a number of things concerning Karl's childhood and his little brother Karl once had.

Dole and Frank's mother would have a fight which would cause Dole to stay out of the picture for a while. Once Dole comes back, he would confront Karl and kick him out of the house and go back to his abusive ways towards Frank and his mother which was a big mistake.

In the end Karl would get the last laugh so a speak after killing Dole with a sling blade which would cause Karl to go back to the mental institution.

The cast, the story, the cinematography and everything else about this film are just tops. John Ritter is INCREDIBLE in this very personal movie.

Don't pass this one by!",1192665600,,432,4.455696202531645
207884,5,5554452574,"Sling Blade is a fantastic movie that you'll never forget.  Billy Bob Thornton wrote, directed and starred in this Oscar-winning movie. Billy Bob was not yet a household name at the time, so he was a relatively unheard of man who created this deeply moving portrait of a simple man with a big heart, logical thinking and a horrible past.

I don't know how Thornton does it, several times I've seen movies and never knew it was him until the credits rolled. He completely morphs into the character he's playing, changing his appearance, size, everything.  Thornton does an INCREDIBLE job of becoming Karl Childers, the main character, complete with a strange voice, twitches, odd mannerism and a shuffling gate.  Equally as great in this movie was Lucas Black, the young boy he befriends. Black has a wonderful Southern accent, (which I'm glad he has not been coached out of even today) and a very natural screen presence. The 2 become fast friends in the movie, and when Childers sees his little friends' plight, he feels forced to make some important life-altering decisions.

Yoakum plays a contemptuos, domineering woman-abuser that no viewer will feel sympathy for. Lucas Black's character's mother is not a very strong character, but perhaps that's intentional. A stronger woman would find her way free from Yoakum.

And then there's John Ritter.  I confess to not having been a Ritter fan from his hideous ""Three's Company"" TV show, but he found his niche in movies. He's great in this as the local gay shopkeeper who is protective and empathetic to the Lucas Black and his mother characters. He teamed up with Thornton in 'Bad Santa' and 'Daddy and Them' as well, they have a great presence together. It's a tragedy we're without Ritter today.

The film is heart-wrenching, full of love and horror, frindship, loyalty, surprise, reality and fantastic acting. Billy Bob Thornton proved early on, in this film, that he's a genius and the finest actor alive. Throw in his directing, his writing, and unrelated to this, his songwriting and singing, and we have our modern day Leonardo DaVinci. What CAN'T he do?

This film should not be missed. I don't know where the idea for the story came from, but it could well be a true story as it seems so real. No wild embellishments, no fantasy, no unbelievable story line, but rather, painful images of child abuse, demented parents (Robert Duvall has a small part as Childers' father, and of course plays it very well), public attitude about other people, the plight of the abused woman, the plight of the abused child and fatherless child, mental illness.. it touches on so many social issues I'd rank it as one of the more important films of the century.

You won't be disappointed (unless you like fluff) in this moving, disturbingly real tale of love, friendship, loyalty, and the simple story of the simple man Karl Childers. Don't miss it.",1191974400,3,2893,4.849898580121704

207886,5,5554452574,"Like Hoffman in Rainman, it's easy to focus on Thornton's Carl Childers in Sling Blade as a stand out performance.  However, this movie wouldn't be nearly as good if the supporting cast weren't so spectacular.  Overlooked in Rainman was the fact that Tom Cruise had to carry the entire film.  Hoffman didn't have a whole lot to say and neither does Thornton's character.  His presance on screen seemingly steals the scenes, but it is the people playing straight around him that makes his character shine.  Billy Bob Thornton obviously obsessed with the small details in this film.  Dwight Yoakam plays a convincingly hateful Doyle Hargraves.  John Ritter plays the best role of his career in a character much more complex than what meets the eye.  Lucas Black is convincing as a young boy living a troubled existance in a small southern town.  If cinema is an art form, then this movie is a masterpiece.  Fantastic story, acting, dialogue, direction, and cinematography.  The subject matter is rather dark.  It's about abuse.  But rather than wallowing in the abyss, the movie manages to entertain with some well placed humor.  I have since become a huge fan of Thornton's work.  He was brilliant in A Simple Plan.  If you like Thornton here, check him out in A Simple Plan.  The man is one of our great actors but somehow doesn't seem to get the credit he deserves.",1190073600,,1366,4.769230769230769

Thornton's cathartic, humane portrayal of Childers--a mild-mannered simpleton who quietly protects and cares for Frank and his mom but is haunted by the past--stirs our deepest sympathies.

207892,5,5554452574,"This is the way classic award winning films should be released on DVD. Billy Bob Thornton's classic triple-threat (starring/writing/directing)debut is an American masterpiece. With portraying life in the South without ever being patronizing or stereotypical, this film about tortured soul Karl Childers, a simple yet disturbed man coming home after 25 years of being hospitalized for the murder of his mother and her lover at the age of 12, is quite frankly one of the last great American film classics of the past fifteen years. There's no denying the acting expertise of Thornton, who worked at his craft for over ten years before finally being given the chance to show his creation to the world with his stunning transformation into the embodiment of Childers, and all without the use of today's special effect makeup or dreaded CGI. It's all Thorton, and played amazingly. It's no wonder then in 1996, he won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay (""adapted"" due to his earlier 1994 short film version of Karl in ""Some Folks Call It A Sling Blade"") as well as being nominated that year for the Best Actor Oscar.

This new 2005 second edition DVD, is packed with mandatory new features. First, the movie itself is now 13 minutes longer (totaling 2 hours and 28 minutes long!) with additional & extended scenes that add to the film without altering the overall feel of the original. Second, the DVD's second disc is jammed packed with Bonus features ranging from a historial view of the career & life of Thornton, roundtable discussions with the majority of the film's cast (including excellent reflections by the late great John Ritter), and behind the scenes featuring Billy Bob directing the film and the amazing physical transformation he did to become Karl Childers.....

....However, that last one isn't so visibly accessible. For it's this Collector Series' DVD Easter Egg! So, I'd like to tell you how you too can access this brief yet interesting Easter Egg, here we go:

Go to Disc Two, and choose the first documentary ""Mr Thornton Goes To Hollywood"". At this point either select Chapter 11 ""Lightnin', You're The Boss"" or ""Play All"" and go to exactly 52:09 into the documentary. Once at that point, wait until you reach the part with John Ritter starting to explain the visual transformation of Billy Bob becoming Karl and you will see in the bottom right hand corner of your screen a silhouette of Karl sitting down facing the left. Quickly press ""ENTER"" on your remote to activate this button (this is the only way to get to this). Once there, you will see what Ritter was talking about, showing footage on the film's set Billy Bob physically changing into Karl right before a few takes each, lasting only about 21 seconds total. After it plays the DVD will automatically take you back to the exact point in the documentary where you left off.

This is an excellent DVD to add to anyone's library, standing proudly by other classics like ""Rain Man"", ""Forrest Gump"", and ""I Am Sam"". Entertaining as well as informative, this film gets better and better with repeated viewings. And this Miramax Collector's Series 2 Disc DVD finally does this film, as well as the talent of Billy Bob Thornton, justice.

207906,3,5554452574,"""Sling Blade"" is an emotionally exhausting picture which establishes Billy Bob Thornton as one of our very best actors, writers, and directors. This story of a mentally handicapped man committed to a mental hospital for a childhood double murder, and his attempt to make it in the outside world, avoids the usual stereotypes about the closed-minded townsfolk and their prejudice against someone like Karl Childers, Thornton's character. Upon his release Childers is given a mechanic's job and befriends a young boy, his widowed mother, and her gay best friend. Unfortunately, the mother's drunken, violent boyfriend - Dwight Yoakam in a dark, effective performance - cannot accept Karl getting in the way of his relationship, and Childers must ultimately defend his new ""family"" the only way he knows how.

The tragedy of ""Sling Blade"" is that Childers is a basically gentle soul whose abusive childhood - his father and mother made him live in a shed behind the house - and marginal intelligence have made him unable to function without violence. More importantly, deep down Childers knows this; he knows he cannot function as a free man, and simply cannot protect the ones he loves without violence. The result is one of the most sympathetic characters I have ever seen in a movie.

Don't read things into a film that aren't there, but don't ignore the interesting elements that are. Get those wheels upstairs turning and start enjoying intelligent filmmaking instead of merely seeking an excitement fix!",1166054400,9,1506,5.117886178861789

207909,5,5554452574,"""That Frank, he lives inside of his own heart. That's an awful big place to live in.""

So gravels Karl, Billy Bob Thornton's unique husky-voiced creation as he describes the inner character of his friend and surrogate son- the innocent and pure Frank. Thornton could easily use this line to describe the broad and embracing spirit of his award-winning 1996 directorial debut, the contemporary classic SLINGBLADE.

Originally released in the halcyon days of independent film-making, the bygone era known as the 90's, SLINGBLADE deftly and eerily combines the wholesome everyman small town ideals of a Norman Rockwell painting with the morbid Southern Gothic tone of William Faulkner's best prose.

Filming in and around his Arkansasian home town, Thornton pulls off a creative hat trick - expanding his one man play and short film into a feature length celebration of salvation through grace and atonement through blood as staged in the backwoods and clapboard houses of rural America.

As a Director, Thornton holds his camera in capricious long shots and expanded takes, allowing his characters to exist in an exaggerated time and space, thereby empowering his actors to explore the nuances of their shadowy lives and share freely of their expansive hearts. Yes all of these people have secrets- Thornton rarely saturates his frame with full light. Bands of shadow wash across every character. Everybody has flaws- potential for good and evil in equal measure- even the villainous Doyle Hargraves (deliciously played by country-western star Dwight Yokum), deserving of Book of Revelation retribution as any character in recent memory, has his moments of vulnerability. The tragic wide-eyed ten year old Frank (played without any cloying sentiment by Lucas Black) too is capable of sudden violence when defending his mother.

Thornton shows he trusts his actors. With his continual use of long unbroken takes, he doesn't artificially create performances through imposed editing. These actors embrace the loud silences and large spaces and time and, as a result, appear to truly and organically erupt in moments of joy, compassion, humor and rage- all in the gentle lilting brogue of a brown water Arkansas drawl. The ensemble cast, made up of professionals (John Ritter in a heart-breakingly humane and admirable performance) and locals (several non-actors appear in effective support), alike never fail to hold the camera's eye.

The film is violent, but tastefully so. The bloodiest moments are reserved for off camera-employing the audience's imaginations to create far more vibrant images than any camera could provide- a lesson too many of Thornton's contemporaries forgot. The most violent and jarring moments occur in Thornton's elliptical dialogue. He understands the power of word pictures. He also displays a brilliant ability to oscillate a scene from chilling to hilarious to tragic on a turn of a phrase.

And at the center of this dark fairy tale is Thornton himself, transformed completely into the character of Karl Childers- a middle aged man recently released from ""the nervous hospital"".  A literary descendent of The Frankenstein Monster, Lennie Small, Forrest Gump and Boo Radley (brilliantly realized in one of filmdom's most obscure ""in jokes""- Robert Duvall appears unbilled as Childers' father), Karl rubs his hands with Lady MacBeth syndrome in guilt. With his high-water pants and hunched-over gait, centering himself from the bottom of his chin and speaking in a growling and grunting exhale Childers lends himself to instant imitation. But what no imitator can ever capture is the calm benevolence lurking behind Thornton's brown eyes.

Thornton's Karl Childers is one of the greatest characters ever created for film. Like the fatherless Frank, the simple minded Childers is pure of heart and in a state of grace and yet he possesses a terrifying capacity for violence. For inside those loving and forgiving eyes lies too a direct portal into what Karl himself would call ""Hades"". He is simple sure. But he is not simplistic. His heart, like the story-world he lives in is ""an awful big place to live in.""

An unforgettable film.",1158019200,22,4159,5.259426847662142

207911,5,5554452574,"Thornton, B. B. (Writer) (1996). Sling Blade. In L. Meistrich (Producer). USA: The Criterion Collection.

 Thornton plays the lead role of Carl, a developmentally disabled (autistic?) man in his 40s who has spent most of his life in small-town Texas as the resident of a psychiatric hospital.  His crime was the double homicide of his mother and her teenaged lover.  We also learn that his father and mother had him bury an infant brother immediately after his birth and while still alive.  Carl, whose heart is seeking purity and justice but whose mind is not equipped to deal well with an evil world, is released from the hospital after 25 years and becomes friends with Frank (Black), a 12-year-old boy whose mother, Linda (Canerday), is hooked up with an abusive and alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle (Yoakam), whom she hopes will go away of his own accord.  Linda's best friend is her grocery store boss, Vaughan (Ritter), who is gay and who stays in the small town that he finds oppressive largely because of his love for Linda and Frank but also because of his own fears and inability to deal with the larger world.

As Carl's relationship as Frank's father-protector figure grows, and as Doyle becomes more threatening to everyone's safety, Carl makes the decision to protect Frank and Linda by murdering Doyle.  When asked by a fellow resident (Walsh) what the world outside is like, Carl says simply that it is too big.

This beautifully made movie of a struggle between good and evil has as its major concern the development and safety of Frank, the young boy.  Carl enters this fallen world to discover a mother who is suffering from the battered wife syndrome and can't act in a way that will protect her son.  Vaughan, the other good adult, is equally incapable of helping Frank.  For his own part, Frank despises Doyle but is too young and helpless to do anything except seek protection from Carl.  Carl, as portrayed by Thornton, an idiot savant who is masterful at repairing small engines, is equally adept at providing shelter for Frank, who comes to rely on Carl as he would his own nurturing father.

Carl displays many of the characteristics of servant leadership delineated by Spears (Greenleaf, Beazley, Beggs, & Spears, 2003, pp. 16-19), notably listening, empathizing, and healing, and his effect on the other players is equally remarkable in servant-leader terms.  For example, one scene portrays a dinner that Vaughan holds at his house with Frank, Linda, and Carl, along with his boyfriend Albert (Tim Holder), and a developmentally disabled grocery store worker Melinda (Christy Ward) whom Vaughan is matchmaking with Carl. The scene is understated and contemplative in its vignette of community building, with wry humor that reveals the fact that everyone at the store knows that Vaughan and Albert are lovers, which Vaughan thought was a secret, echoing the movie's theme of a world that is ""too big"" - too callous and mean-spirited for sensitive people to live unharmed lives.

Carl also displays the qualities of foresight and commitment to the growth of people in his relationship with Frank.  This ultimately leads him to conclude that the only way Frank can grow up undamaged, with the implication that Doyle may actually become drunkenly enraged and kill Linda and Frank.  Carl ends up killing Doyle in an act of premeditated sacrifice that is as dark as it gets.  He acts as Frank's protector but also returns himself to the contrastingly small world of the mental hospital, where he spends most of his time sitting in a chair, looking out the window.

There is much more detail and nuance to this movie that I can't capture in a couple of paragraphs, but the movie is melancholy and deep and well worth watching.  To get some more flavor of it, see [...] for a few pages of dialogue excerpts.",1155686400,,3824,4.861325115562404

207916,5,5554452574,"Set in a small, rural Southern town, Billy Bob Thornton`s ""Sling Blade"" is so flavorful in ambiance and tone, so rich in character and theme that it's hard to believe that its roots are not to be found in any short story or novel.  For while it has all the earmarks of a great work of literature, ""Sling Blade"" is actually an original creation by Thornton, the triple threat talent who wrote, directed and stars in the work.

Karl Childers is a marginally retarded man who's been living in a mental institution ever since, as a child, he accidentally stumbled across his mother and her lover in a compromising position and, in a moment of considerable confusion, hacked the two of them to death.  After being officially declared by the state to be ""rehabilitated"" and ""cured,"" Karl is thrust back out into the world where he forms a bond with a fatherless boy, his hardworking, compassionate mother and a gay storeowner who has long since become a part of their extended family.  Also part of that family is the widow's twisted boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves, who physically and psychologically abuses both mother and son.

Thanks to Carl's ""strangeness"" and homicidal background, as well as the simmering volatility and mercurial temperment of Doyle, there is always the threat of violence hanging ominously over the work.  Yet, in many ways, ""Sling Blade"" is really about the goodness of people in their willingness to overlook external differences and to find the similarities that unite us all in a common bond of humanity.  For the most part, the people in this quiet little community try to reach out and befriend Karl, sensing a decency in him that helps to mitigate any possible fear they might have of him based solely on surface eccentricities.  Even when he is eventually forced into violent action, he does so as an avenging angel bringing swift and righteous justice, not as a murderous demon acting out of hatred or malice.

The acting in the film - beginning with Thornton himself - could not be more brilliant.  With his stooped shoulders, tight-lipped smile, jutting jaw, vacant expression and guttural throat-clearing, Karl became the [...] of so many jokes back when the movie first came out that it's easy to forget what a truly amazing character - and job of acting - Thornton has pulled off here.  The actor we've known from so many other movies is completely invisible in this role, as he literally becomes Karl in every fiber of his being and, in so doing, forces us to see the wisdom and humanity buried deep inside the person.  The performance is such a touchstone of acting for our generation that it is easy to miss all the other great acting in the film, particularly on the part of Natalie Canerday, Lucas Black, John Ritter, J.T. Walsh, Robert Duvall and, most especially, Dwight Yoakam, whose portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of a psychopathic meltdown is bone-chilling and brilliant.

As a writer, Thornton has shaped his film like a modern day parable - simple, symbol-laden and allegorical.  As a director, he proves himself a master of rhythm and pacing, setting the mood and allowing the scenes to play themselves out without recourse to overstatement or melodrama.  In fact, this is one of those rare movies in which every moment feels just right, so confident is Thornton in his ability as a filmmaker to bring his story to life on screen.  He also knows how to make the bucolic setting come across as both stark and sensuous at the same time, a place of quiet stillness that provides the perfect backdrop for the morality tale he is endeavoring to tell.  Finally, Daniel Lanois has provided a haunting musical score that ever so subtly draws us into the disturbingly offbeat world of the drama.

""Sling Blade"" earned a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for Thornton, but he should also have won awards for his directing and his performance as Karl, not to mention the film itself which should have won the honor as Best Picture of 1996 - although Hollywood, in its infinite wisdom, failed even to nominate it.  Ah well, even with that lapse in judgment, ""Sling Blade"" remains one of the great movie dramas of the past decade.",1145836800,9,4166,4.777158774373259

Now middle-aged and released from the state mental hospital, Karl (Billy Bob Thornton) returns to his hometown, completely alone and so helpless that he even tries to go back to the hospital.  But Karl does begin his life on the outside and befriends a boy who is as lonely as he is.  Karl moves in with the boy and his mother, who are abused by her drunken boyfriend (Dwight Yoakum) - a man just as mean as Karl's father was.

I put off seeing this move for years because I thought it would be too depressing.  While it is sad, I'm glad I saw it, because the story was fascinating and all of the actors were extraordinary.  I guessed what the ending would be early on so I didn't feel hopeless watching the story unfold; instead I was caught up in the spell of Billy Bob and the world he created on the screen.  Thornton is unrecognizable as the simple man with a cruel past, and his performance is utterly convincing.  Lucas Black, as the boy, is also excellent and John Ritter has a very good role as a gay shopkeeper.  A thought-provoking movie that takes an unsentimental look at real pain.  Recommended.

""Some Folks Call it a Sling Blade."" Thorton was nominated for Best Actor, but didn't win and instead won the Oscar for best adapted screenplay and rightfully so. The film is powerful, it's got a sacrafice theme to it and the end of the film (if not semi-predictable) is great. Thorton stars as Karl Childers, a man who was recently released from the state hospital after killing his mother and her boyfriend as a child. Karl is a bit slow, but he gets a job fixing small engines and befriends a young boy named Frank (Lucas Black, who would reunite with Thorton in ""Friday Night Lights"") and moves in with the boy and his mother. Problem is, the boy's mother has an abusive boyfriend named Doyle

(country singer Dwight Yoakam who's great) which doesn't sit well with him. Also in the film is John Ritter as Vaughan, a homosexual shop keeper and friend of Frank's mother. Now, I love this movie and almost every thing about it. One thing I did find a bit hard to accept was the fact that when Karl tells Frank's mother that he killed his mother and her boyfriend, the mother just accepts it without a second thought. Would the film have worked if she kicked him out of the house for it? No, but there could've been some way to make it more believable.

This is hands-down the best performance I've seen from Thornton, and I have the utmost repect for him after this movie.  It's even more incredible that he wrote and directed the movie, in adding to his starring performance.

I'll admit that the subject matter and the fact that some people said this was the saddest movie they saw made me hesitant to watch it.  I'm so glad I did.  It is a sadder movie, but it's also a movie about finding friendship in the unlikliest places, and what family means.

For all of you that think that Jamie Foxx was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING in Ray, well, watch this movie because Billy Bob Thorton's performance is 10000000 times better. Just look at his posture, facial expressions, grunts, moans, and his accent. I find his performance in this movie to be the BEST ACTING PERFROMANCE EVER! Thornton wrote, directed and starred in this so just watch it for all of the effort that he put into it. And his performance is absolutely breathtaking. He'll make you laugh and cry your head off. This is a very sad and emotional movie.

The movie is about Karl (Billy Bob Thorton), a man released from a mental institution a long time after he slaughtered his mother and her boyfriend as a child. Now, while, most of the critics call this man a boyfriend, he's not. He's a student abusing her and she's enjoying it. Karl freaks and murders them with a sling blade or as he calls it, a keiser blade. Karl is mentally challenged and now is finally released from the mental institution. By the way, for parents worriedfor their children, the movie doesn't show him kill them. He just tells the story of how and what happened. So for the whole movi, there is no violence that you see. Also, for language, there are literally no cuss words besides one scene of strong nonstop language. The movie is very powerful and emotional and is in my opinion appropriate for 13 years + children or mature children.

Anywhere, from then Karl gets a job and meets a friend, Frank. Frank is a boy who has a nice mother who has an awful boyfriend. The boyfriend is racist and threathens to kill Frank's mom if she ever leaves him. THis boyfriend is masterfully played by Dwight Yoakam. So, this boyfriend is the only mean person in the story. He's the vilain. When Karl moves in with Frank, the boyfriend gets mad and sparks fly. Karl will then have to make a tough decision and will need to confront his past. The movie has amazing performances by everyone including Billy Bob Thorton, Dwight Yoakam, John Ritter and the actor that played Frank.

THe movie is the best when Karl and Frank are together. They love each other and are best friends. They protect each other and they both reveal their secrets. Karl and Frank seem very similiar and you can see many parralels between Karl as a boy and Frank.

The movie is very sad and emotional and will make you cry probably. You love Karl and I wanted to hug him. He is a very kind troubled man and Frank is the loving boy who cares for him. THeir life would be perfect if it weren't for the mean, racist and abusive boyfriend. I recommend this movie to everyone and I will definitely add it to my top 25 movies.

The specific re-relased set of DVDs if really the subject of this review.  Finally...a Special Edition CD that warrants the title ""Special'.  What a wonderful DVD.  Every fan Billy Bob has is going to love it!!!!!!

SHAME ON the decision-makers who deprived the public of Billy Bob's insightful, informative, and very personal 'commentary' on the first DVD release.  I have often pondered purchasing a used laser disc player in order to hear his words.  I didn't ever, but believe me those words were worth waiting for.  I don't usually watch the commentary of a film more than once, but I can say with certainty, I will watch this on a routine basis.

I am often disappointed when a Billy Bob film is released on DVD and he isn't on the commentary and/or featured very much in any of the additional special features.  There was nothing disappointing about this group of special features and particularly about this commentary.

I loved the fact that we were made privy to so much of the behind-the-scenes information and so much of Billy Bob's personal likes, dislikes, goals, and feeling about this movie his fans have so grown to love and associate with his artistic genius.  I was grateful too that he was the only voice on the commentary, because he IS the voice of this film.

The movie was definitely made more special by the additional footage, which was not a great deal more coverage in terms of length, but unlimited in its value of being exposed to more of Karl, and ultimately to the heart and thoughts of Billy Bob himself.

I have lost track of the number of times I have viewed the original film, but I am still blown away by every aspect of the film, and I still cry every time, even when it is separated only by hours in between, as when I watch the film today and then immediately thereafter the commentary.  It was rewarding the me to note that small things I had noticed about the film, (but had no idea if they were my imagination at work, or deliberate or accidental, and if they have been noticed by many, many viewers) were indeed 'there' because of one circumstance or another during the filming.

How I have loved this story, these actors, and the entire beauty of this work and how I love it even more now that I have been given access to Billy Bob's special introspection.

Anyone who had been so kind as to read my reviews amazon.com,  of Billy Bob's films/music, may have noticed, I have never written a review of this movie.  First off, I think the film speaks for itself and for Billy Bob and doesn't really need my humble input.  Second, my feelings about the film are so 'deep and personal to me' and so 'respective and humbled-by-the-genius of Billy Bob', that I could never find the words to review the film in even a semi-objective manner.  This little sound-off about this new DVD is the closest I will ever come to reviewing the film, and it is more about the DVD itself.

If by some unfortunate set of circumstances someone on this site has NOT seen this film, please, please give yourself the greatest gift of entertainment pleasure you ever could and watch the entire DVD set as soon as possible.  For those who have seen the movie and liked it, if you haven't done so yet.....treat yourself to more and watch it again, but this time in all its glory .",1119139200,11,3463,4.541062801932367
207939,4,5554452574,"Miramax isn't making a big deal about it, but ""Sling Blade"" turns 10 somewhere around here. The indie classic hasn't aged a day -- it remains heartfelt, compelling and taut, even with 22 minutes added for the director's cut DVD. The movie tells the tale of Karl, a kind, slow-thinking, slow-talking manchild just released from a mental home, where he was sent for killing his mother and her lover in a fit of confusion.

The film looks great, considering its low budget. The transfer is new, with widescreen images unspooling at 1.85:1. Audio gets an upgrade from the previous DVD to 5.1 surround. The sound is warm and clear but with some boominess.

The improbable success story of writer-director-actor Billy Bob Thornton and ""Sling Blade"" is told and retold in the generous-to-a-fault extras, which add up to something like seven hours. Some folks would call it overkill -- your mileage may vary. Thornton first recorded the commentary for a Criterion laserdisc. He updates it here when the newly inserted footage comes into play. It's a telling contrast. Thornton whispered like a hung-over golf analyst on the older material, but now sounds clear-voiced and engaged. Regardless, admirers will be better served by the profiles and interviews on disc 2. Missing is the original Karl short film, ""Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade,"" directed by George Hickenlooper. Not much mention is made of it, either.

One of the best bits is a roundtable discussion with singer Dwight Yoakam (who turned heads playing a liquored-up bad ass), veteran actor-musician Mickey Jones (""Home Improvement""), producer David Bushnell and Thornton. A lot of the talk is about music, which Thornton insists is at the heart of the movie. Thornton then reunites with scorer Daniel Lanois in a 22-minute segment. Lanois performs Karl's theme music and recalls the score as having ""a nice nave spirit.""

Was I wrong! This performance is unlike any I have ever seen before, and I was riveted from the beginning to the end and was surprised that some people stated it was long; to me, the time flew by because I was so deeply involved with all the characters, espceially Karl (BBT). His WALK, every movement, his speech, his gutteral tones, all are wonderful and mesmerizing; and all the time you wonder that is really going on in his mind, something I never really thought about much before in any other movie with any other character. The boy, Frank, is fantastic, very real and believable, and Dwight Yoakum was so good and scary I didn't even realize I was watching Dwight Yoakum; that is a great performance.

(WARNING:SPOILER)

Toward the end, when Karl came to do what he need to do in order to ensure the safety of the family he had befriended, Doyle was sitting in a chair in the living room, the family safely with Vaughan (John Ritter, in an amazing role with the perfect haircut for his character) and eerily, Doyle seemed to suddenly have a precognitive flash and was real quiet, still obnoxious and bullying but in a much quieter tone, just mouthing the words, as his malice and posturing were suddenly gone, leaving him only with the knowledge that this time he wasn't going to be able to walk away from his just retribution.

Karl also knew what would happen, and honestly, it was like killing 2 birds with one stone; he was able to set his friends free from a terrible and dangerous bully and get himself back inside the safest place he knew, the asylum, where he was most comfortable and at home. All in all, a very satisfactory ending, and a truly original and amazingly well-crafted movie.",1118102400,4,1945,4.648255813953488

Nevertheless, I digress.  Billy Bob Thornton is pure genius here, with a remarkable turn as writer/director/star of Sling Blade.  Carl, the main character, is as fully realized a creation as I've ever seen in a movie, the kind of person that can't be truly invented, but, rather, divinely inspired.  Thornton is channeling this astounding archetype, a character that communicates to us in a profound, emotional level.  He has pieces of all of us inside him, and genuine nobility that defies easy understanding.  Everything about Carl is believable, even though he teeters on the edge of mental retardation and sometimes evinces a savvy that seems inconsistent, but rings true.

John Ritter's performance is also astonishing as a gay store manager.  (Ritter always seemed quite effeminate to me, and those characteristics shine here.)  The young boy who befriends Carl is terrific, too, as is Dwight Yoakum as the drunken loser whose alcohol psychoses is right out of life.

Will Thornton every do anything as good ever again?  Doubt it, but it doesn't matter.  He's left a profound mark.",1117843200,4,1110,5.139664804469274

207943,4,5554452574,"If you are expecting a slow southern drama about a small-town misfit who is released from an asylum and trying to fit in again, then Sling Blade is a ""must see"" movie.  Released by Miramax in 1996 and wrote, directed and starred by Billy Bob Thornton, this fictional drama is set in Arkansas , where a mildly retarded man named Karl Childers played by Thornton is about to be released after 25 years from an asylum for the criminally insane.  This movie has a very slow pace which is in comparison to how Thornton is portraying Karl.  Thornton receives an ""Academy Award winner for Best Adapted Screen Play and for Best Actor in 1996"" in this breath taking performance as Karl Childers.

Karl, played by Thornton, was imprisoned for a youthful act of terrible vengeance. Stumbling upon his mother naked on the floor with one of the towns men on top of her, and believing that she was being raped, he killed the man with a few thrashings of a sling blade. After killing the man and looking at his mother he realized that the man was her lover and Karl, filled with red rage, killed his mother as well.  Now 25 years later he returns to the community where he stumbles upon a young boy named Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) who has lost his father and likes to listen to Karl's rasp voice and  his ""all right then"" phrases that he makes. With both Karl and Frank feeling like outcast they are drawn together and become good friends, and before long Karl moves in with Frank and his mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), and finds a job fixing lawnmowers.  Not to long after Karl moving in with the Wheatley home, he realized that Linda's boyfriend, Doyle (Dwight Yoakam), abuses both her and Frank.  Doyle is always putting Frank down for being different and calls Karl a ""humped-over retard"", between each of the drinks of beer he swigs down.  You also learn about Linda's friend and protector, a gay grocery store manager (John Ritter) whose self appointed goal is to protect the Wheatley family from Doyle's drunken outrages, and to keep his gay life in the closet in this small southern town.

In addition to figures such as Jim Jarmusch showing up in a cameo as a Tastee Cream counter clerk and J.T. Walsh captive role, musicians such as Vic Chesnutt and Ian Moore make appearances as members of Doyle's terrible backyard band. I give this movie 4 stars even though it could be argued that Sling Blade could be taken under the cutting board, but it does not take away from the great performance of the movie which runs approximately 1 hour 34 minutes.",1116547200,,2547,4.590308370044053
207944,4,5554452574,"The film Sling Blade was written, directed, and starred Billy Bob Thornton as a mentally retarded man who was neglected and teased as a child.  Most of Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton) childhood was one of torment at the hands of cruel school children, and neglect from ignorant parents.  Karl thinks his mother is being raped and kills her assailant, only to find that his beloved mother was a willing participant in the encounter.  He becomes enraged and strikes her down with a sling blade.  Karl spends the next two decades in a state institution for the criminally insane.  He has been a model patient, and is eventually deemed fit for release back into society.  Only his body has grown during his incarceration, while his mind has remained that of a child.  His first encounter outside of the hospital is with a young boy Frank (Lucas Black) and his mother Linda (Natalie Canerday), who take him into their home and treat him with dignity and kindness.  Karl instantly loves his new family, but his happiness is quickly extinguished when Doyle (Dwight Yoakam) enters Karl's life.  Doyle is a violent alcoholic redneck who destroys any hope for Carl, Frank and Linda to have any sort of happiness.  These are the main players in this tragic story, but (John Ritter) Vaughn Cunningham plays a supporting role as Linda's homosexual boss and close friend.  We also catch a glimpse of Karl's father Frank Childers (Robert Duval) in a small, mostly insignificant role as well.  The movie starts out slow and really never speeds up as it progresses.  I think that the movie would not work any other way than being slowly told since the main character is slow as well.  Sling Blade ends as it begins, with tragic consequences for everyone involved, and leaves me wondering why people are so cruel to others who are different.  I would definitely recommend the movie.  I enjoyed the movie and I found it worth the time I invested in watching it.  The characters were well developed, and I was able to become emotionally attached to Karl's character as well as Frank, his mother, and Vaughan while they tried in vain to coexist with Doyle and his abusive ways.",1116547200,,2159,4.760752688172043
207945,3,5554452574,"Billy Bob Thornton wrote, directed, and starred in this slow moving drama with scary similarities to the movie To Kill a Mockingbird. Thornton plays Karl, a mentally retarded man who has spent 20 years in a psychiatric hospital for killing his mother and her lover with a sling blade (Thus the name of the movie). Released into the community from which he came, he befriends and protects a lonely boy regularly harassed and abused by his mom's boyfriend Doyle (Dwight Yoakam). The story is ultimately about sacrifice; Karl is forced to make a choice between what he feels in his heart, and what he feels is biblically wrong. Some of the best material involves Karl's no-big-deal efforts to integrate into a ""normal"" life: working, eating fast food (mostly French fries), earning admiration for his handyman skills, and attaining a semblance of community among other damaged souls. John Ritter has a great part as a gay shopkeeper who tries to alleviate his own loneliness by spilling his guts out to Thornton's uncomprehending character. There is also a meaningless scene where Karl confronts his father (Robert Duvall, who is a great actor that must have needed a quick paycheck, as he really played a very insignificant role).

After watching the film, I must admit I felt a little ambivalent about Karl's final decision. Without giving away the ending, I felt that Karl was forced to make a decision because Frank's (Lucas Black) mother refused to make one. She is involved in an abusive relationship and keeps both her and her son's life in peril because she doesn't want to be lonely. The plot is so similar to other movies I've seen, that I knew what the ending was going to be from the beginning.

207946,4,5554452574,"Billy Bob Thornton does an excellent job writing, directing and starring in this movie.  You will not even recognize him as he becomes a retarded southerner, (Carl Childers), just getting out of the State correctional facility.  The way that Thornton explains the childhood of Carl in the beginning of the movie gives the audience a good picture of what he has been through.  He befriends a young boy (JT Walsh) who like himself has struggled through a troublesome childhood.  When Carl gets out of the State Hospital he is introduced into another dysfunctional family.  The boy whom he had befriended invites him to stay with his family so that he does not feel nervous all of the time. The new family consists of the boy's widowed mother, her best friend also her boss who is played by John Ritter and her new boyfriend, Doyle (Dwight Yokam) who is a very mean construction worker.  Yokam and Ritter also do excellent jobs in their roles.  Yokam plays the part of an unstable single alcoholic whom is destined to abuse everyone he is associated with.  Ritter is a local grocery store manager who is trying to hide the fact that he is a homosexual.  Toward the end of the movie you can predict what is going to happen by the turn of events that take place. Carl gets Baptized and then things around the household start to get out of control.  He goes to all of the people who have been straight with him and asked them of favors.  What happens next is quite predictable but the manner in which it takes place is out of the ordinary.  This movie is not a very fast paced movie and there are many slow spots.  The reasoning behind this is the main character is also very slow and he is setting the pace.  I would rate this movie a four out of five and would watch it again due to its incredible acting and excellent screenplay.",1116374400,,1826,4.477341389728097
207947,5,5554452574,"When I first saw Sling Blade back in 1996, I was immensely moved by Thornton's portrayal of a mentally retarded man trying to assimilate into the world from which he was cast years ago for killing his mother and her lover. It was, to me, a perfect movie from beginning to end. The movement was precise; all of the situations (unfortunately) highly believable, and the acting, from Thornton to John Ritter to Lucas Black was terrific. Lucas Black, incidentally, seems to be making the transition from child star to adult actor quite well. So many ""cute kids"" that can act like ""cute kids"" grow into ungainly adults who can't act like adults. He's breaking that mold, and perhaps it's because he was never under the intense scrutiny that others like Macaulay Culkin were.

Anyway, I'm digressing in a huge way.

Having seen this recently on cable, I was surprised at how strongly certain images remained from my first viewing. Frank (Lucas Black) tossing huge bags of laundry out of the Laundromat, the cot that Karl (Thornton) slept on, originally, in the back of the garage he worked at, the horrible scene where Doyle (played to oily perfection by Dwight Yoakam) flew into a drunken rage and shoved Linda (Frank's mom, Natalie Canerday), whereupon Frank viciously attacked Doyle by throwing everything he could get his hands on at him. That was such a brilliant and moving scene. As was the scene where Karl grabbed Doyle's hand and said something like, ""Don't you lay a hand on that boy"".

However, while watching it, I realized that I had missed a rather major plot line, the entire reason that Karl and Frank bonded the way the way they did. I'm chalking it up to being nine years dumber than I am today, but that's just a convenient excuse. I missed it, and, uh, all I can say about that is ""duh!"".

What I missed is rather simple, and may come as no surprise to anyone reading this. Karl, under direction from his parents, drowned his younger brother and buried him alive. Retarded and young as he was, he didn't have a complete grasp on the situation, but over the years, he came to realize that what he did was wrong. On Frank's end, his father killed himself. Rather simple here. Karl found the little brother he wanted as well as his perceptive abilities could grasp, and Frank found the father he desperately missed and needed. Without that core, the movie really lacks coherency. So for me to have missed that and still enjoyed the film immensely - well, like I said earlier, duh. My only complaint about the missing father figure was that John Ritter's character, who was gay, could easily have been a father figure to Frank. Being gay didn't disqualify him. Let's get serious - if being gay disqualifies, even in young Frank's mind, wouldn't a socially inept retarded person be disqualified too? That's a minor problem, though.

Going back to powerful images, anyone who has seen this film is not likely to forget the ending, where Karl calmly goes from place to place, extracting promises from various people so that he and Doyle will be alone later that night. Karl calmly asks Doyle how to reach the police, and once Doyle tells him, Karl calmly stands up, kills him with what I guess is a sling blade (I admit ignorance here), then calls the police, reports a murder, and says that with the second blow he nearly cleaved Doyle's head in two. After reporting the murder, he sits down and finishes eating dinner.

Later, upon being readmitted to the mental institution, we are confronted with the most disgusting of criminals - and I'm not even certain why this particular criminal was institutionalized, unless he had a great lawyer - the child molester. This man is talking to Karl about his ""exploits"", which are revolting, and asks if Karl had met anyone on the ""outside"". Karl says he met a boy, and the molester indicates that he doesn't go that way, but was sure that Karl had a good time with him. Karl replies, and I'm paraphrasing liberally, ""Don't you never say nothin' `bout that boy. As a matter of fact, I'd appreciate it if you don't say `nothing to me at all.""

Retarded, yes. Immoral? That's a more difficult question. The Bible told him that killing was wrong, but obviously he somehow worked out that in certain matters killing was OK (he said to his father that he would kill him where he sat, but he saw that his father was doing a fine job of it himself).

This was the first time I'd seen Billy Bob Thornton, although he'd appeared in and/or written seventeen films prior. Having never seen him, I had no idea how remarkable his acting was. After seeing him in other films, his performance here put Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man to shame.",1112659200,,4674,4.643288996372431
207948,4,5554452574,"The real impact of Sling Blade lies in the way the movie draws the audience into sympathy with Karl, the ""mentally retarded"" protagonist who has spent 20 years in an institution after murdering his mother and her young lover. As the movie opens, Karl is released as ""cured"", and winds up befriending a young boy and  living with the boy and his mother. At the end of the film, Karl coldly and mechanically kills the mother's abusive boyfriend, in order, as he sees it, to save the boy and the woman from eventual harm. Throughout the film, Karl appears to be a figure embodying simple goodness. As a result, there is a temptation to see his final act in the light of self-sacrifice and justice. That is the heart of the matter, because if we do see it that way, we have been seduced into applauding the brutal murder of a man who is clearly not the embodiment of evil that Karl is led to believe. The boyfriend is sinister, hypocritical, and verbally abusive, but we never see him involved in any serious violence - certainly nothing like Karl's total of three dead! We see the boyfriend blustering, insulting, but also apologizing, cowering under a barrage of objects thrown at him by the boy but declining to fight back, and generally presenting the dismaying picture of an oppressive and chaotic future for the family, but he is not the demon we may take him to be if we take our view from Karl and others. The demon lies in Karl, and the boyfriend is there to distract us from that fact. There are delicious clues: e.g., Karl's repeated comment that he has read the Bible and understood a good bit of it, but ""not all of it"". The parts he does not understand point to what is missing in Karl and completely undercut the too-easy assumption that his pre-emptive violence is morally laudable. Karl kills with the blade of a lawnmower - one of the machines that in his ""idiot savant"" mode, he is so expert at repairing - and at that point, we may realize that Karl is himself a machine, defective in moral reasoning, and programmed to kill by many remarks made by the other characters about the victim. Karl's identification with the young boy becomes, in retrospect, another warning. He means the boy no harm; he loves the boy. But it is a boy's imperfect judgment that moves Karl. The boyfriend very obnoxiously puts his lover's son in his place on several occasions (""We are the grownups, you're the child..."", or words to that effect). But there is truth in what he says, and value in being able to distinguish the message from the messenger. This ""irony of moral misdirection"", by tempting us to embrace an attractive moral error and then making us reconsider when we follow the attractive embodiment of that error right into the slaughter house, may serve to clarify our principles. Note the passivity with which the boyfriend faces Karl's announced intention to kill him, note the man's last word, which we hear just before the blade falls (he calls Karl's name, softly, probably a strangely gentle supplication: a chilling contrast to the thunk of the blade), and note Karl, his duty done, calling the police and sitting down to enjoy some biscuits.

No sooner does he return to his hometown than he's befriended by a fatherless local boy with a predicament not very different from his own, years ago.

The tension of his murderous memories is revived over and over again as he pits the harsh but glaringly simple solution to his friend's woes against a sense of right and wrong. The moral dilemma that ensues comes forth at a beautiful pace, lodging Karl's character in our hearts and winning our rapt attention for the length of this engrossing film.

Hunched over and speaking in a monotone husky growl with lots of ""uh huhs"" Thornton's portrayal of the troubled man-child had me in a tweezer grip. Nearly as compelling as Geoffrey Rush's ""Shine"" from the same year. There's a continuous closeup of him at the beginning of the movie that had me utterly galvanized with emotion, about 7-8 minutes of uncut camera focus.

Well, my narrative comes mostly from the Christian perspective.
I saw Jesus Christ quite clearly in the person of Karl. Karl's simple but at the same time deeply loving personality reminded me of Jesus. Just like Jesus, Karl decided to sacrifice his life for others. Also, the movie is full of Christian overtones since Karl appears to be a very strong believer in God.
Also, the theme of broken families/relationships runs deeply through the script. The parental abuse and its implications are shown in a bright light. The band of ""damaged souls"" meet at Vaughn's table...is quite a scene.

OK.  How about the plot?  A mentally retarded man is released from a mental hospital where he was sentenced for killing his mother and the man she was having an affair with.  This mentally retarded man quickly meets a 10 year old boy who asks his mother if it would be all right for this man, just released from a mental hospital where he was serving time for killing two people, if he can stay in there garage.  The mother agrees.  Don't you just love the realism that independent movies give us over standard Hollywood fantasy?

Anyhoo, the ""plot"" continues with mentally retarded man defending this boy and his mother against her abusive boyfriend who, at one point in the movie, becomes the most sympathetic character when he speaks for the audience who has paid good money to watch this tripe by telling the other characters ""If you all don't shut up I'm going to go out of my mind.""  Given all that I have just told you about this plot I'm sure you can easily guess how this movie ends.

But for some reason, back in 1996, critics singled this thing out as the movie to shower with hype and the downright creepy Billy Bob Thornton (remember him?  He's the guy who carried a vial of Anjelina Jolie's blood around his neck for a while) became a media darling praised for his performance in this movie which is nothing but a series of sentences punctuated by ""uh-hums"" enunciated from several octaves lower than a normal human voice.

So the lack of extras is a negative. I would also place Dwight Yoakum's acting in that category (his character is interesting, but his interpretation is weak and wooden). There is also the cringe-inducing line about the small boy living in his own heart, a strange lapse in such an intelligent film.

That being said, this film really sticks with you and easily overcomes the flaws. Thornton completely transforms himself in an astonishing performance. He becomes unrecognizable without putting on or taking off weight, or any other devices-he does it through sheer force of will. Incredible. The boy is engaging and utterly believable.

But my real love for this movie comes from the language. Perhaps you have to come from a rural area to truly appreciate it, but the dialogue is laugh-out-loud funny.  I suppose if you're used to getting your laughs from people being humiliated in reality TV you may not appreciate the VERY quiet humor on display here.

Thornton's Karl Childers became one of the Icons of American cinema, and I still hear people doing Karl's gravel-throated mumble which gets an immediate look of recognition from the people around.
Karl is an essentially good man who is mentally challenged.  He recognizes good and bad in others, and he seems to understand his place in the world, even if the intricacies of complex human relationships pass by him as unnoticed as the ozone layer.
As the movie opens we learn that Karl is being held in a State Mental Hospital many years after he has killed a couple of people he thought were doing wrong.  I'd say more here, but I think it might spoil some of your enjoyment of the movie to learn more - so just watch the movie! We also learn that Karl is being released because they've ""cured him"".
He goes back to his home town with all his worldly belongings in a sack.  A kindly Doctor from the institution gets him a job as a lawn-mower mechanic and he meets a little boy who is friendly to him.
This is a movie of characters, and simply describing them would not do the characters justice.  Karl is a simple man with a pretty well-developed sense of right and wrong.  The little boy has lost his father, and the boy's mother, Linda, (portrayed in a wonderfully understated performance by Natalie Canerday) has taken up with a hard drinking, bad-mouthing redneck played by Dwight Yoakam.  The late John Ritter is almost unrecognizable playing the soft-spoken crew-cut manager of the store where Linda works.  Ritter's Vaughan is devoted to Linda and the little boy, Frank (played by Lucas Black), but Vaughan is also a homosexual in a small town in the south, and his social status is precarious.
There are many serious and tender and hilarious and moving scenes, and most of them involve Billy Bob's Karl.  For example, there is one scene where Vaughan invites Karl to the diner where Vaughan proceeds to pour his heart out to the uncomprehending Karl.  Vaughan goes on about the difficulties he has had in life, and with his father, and being a homosexual.  The entire time Karl sits silently, eating his ""french-fried 'taters"".
Vaughan finally pauses and says ""You always seem to be deep in thought. Tell me, what are you thinking right now?""
Karl replies: ""I was thinkin', I'm gonna take me some of these taters home with me.""
This movie will stick with you long after you have seen it.  Highly recommended.",1089590400,6,2504,4.7070938215102975
207968,5,5554452574,"Sling Blade starts out at a mental home where Karl, played by Thornton, is being released after 25 years. He killed his mother and a boyfriend after he caught them having sex and he didn't think it seemed right. But Karl is deemed to be safe for society and he is also a man with a good heart that when asked if he will do it again replies,""I don't reckon I got no reason to kill nobody."" Karl, by the way is somewhat mentally challenged. So it is time to be released, and Karl returns to the town he used to call home with no place to go and no one to return to (except a father who will not recognize him).
Karl befriends a young boy named Frank, and the two are friends from the start. Both of them share some of the same emotional issues, but in Frank's case it is due to his mother's abusive boyfriend Doyle (played by Dwight Yoakam). Karl gets a job working on small engines at a local garage and lives there for a while, but Frank and his mother agree it would be good for Karl to live with them. From the first time Karl meets Doyle, he begins to see what a terrible person he is. Doyle is constantly belittling Frank and Vaughn (a friend of Frank's mother who is gay), and is verbally and physically abusive to Linda (Frank's mom). Karl appears to be a very simple man, but it is apparent that his mind is always at work analyzing the people around him. Doyle grows worse and worse, and Karl becomes increasingly fed up with him. Karl always remains calm no matter the situation, but we start to see that he is the only one who can make things better for Linda, Frank and Vaughn and that as the movie progresses Karl realizes something must be done. I will spare you the ending, but the final conflict revolves around Karl's love for Frank and Linda and with him making a choice, a choice that could send him back to the mental hospital.
This is an incredible movie that deserves all of the notariety is has collected since its release. It won many awards, and deservingly so. There is a little bit of dark comedy here, some tragedy (like when Karl is talking about his brother he had to bury when he was just born), but most of all it is a disturbing examination of internal conflict in one simple man that really is a good guy at heart. It is pretty disturbing at times, so you have been warned. The movie is nothing short of perfect though and it is definately one that you need to see in your lifetime.",1087689600,4,2415,4.240780911062907

The script is absolutely amazingly written. The dialogue is tremendous and doesn't feel scripted at all.
The direction is extremely well done. No jumpy, trendy camera changes, and beautiful solo shots that really help to develop the characters.
The absolute high point is the acting. Everyone in this movie is tremendous. Thornton does such an amazing job, that it's hard to believe it's him. Which I think is the greatest thing an actor can do, make you forget its them. The young boy (Lucas Black) is unbelievable. Long scenes are usually impossible with children, but there are some very long shots that he comes through without error. Terrific. Yoakam as the abusive boyfriend does an excellent job, second only to Thornton. Ritter(r.i.p.) plays the gay friend of the boy and his mother without a hokey flamboyance or any stereotypical nonsense, great performance. Canerday is great as the boy's mother, she portrays he character with utter realism (a woman that knows her situation is awful, but doesn't know how to deal with it).

207978,5,5554452574,"Sling Blade is an excellent, thought-provoking story about one man's return to society after being released from a mental instituation.
One of the great aspects of the film is simply Billy Bob Thornton's portrayel of Karl. Returning to the town he called home after 25 years in an institution, Karl must start life anew. Karl's simple nature is quite deceptive; althougth he has a calm and monotone manner about him, he is truly a complex individual who contemplates each person and situation from both sides before morally judging it. He is one of the more memorable characters because of his unique mannerisms (trust me, you may find yourself grunting the words ""french fried potaters"") and his plain honesty (he openly tells the boy he befriends exactly why he was locked up). Thornton, who also directed the film, does a masterful job at ""becoming"" the character of Karl.
The film delves into a vas range of issues that pervade our world: physical and psychological abuse, abandonment, acceptability of individualism. What makes the film unique is that these subjects are analyzed both internally (Karl calmly interalizing an argument between Linda, Frank and Doyle; Karl listening to another mental patient describe his crimes) and externally (Vaughan confronting Karl about his sexual orientation and love for Frank's family; Karl telling Vaughan that, despite what the Bible says, he is a good man). We feel the turmoil of vastly different individuals and personalities all trying to live under one roof.
One underlying question that pervades from the film is ""what truly is a good human being?"" That is, what qualities certify a benevolent individual versus, say, a reckless person. While the story has mostly inheritantly good charcters, Karl possesses characteristics that make him both good and bad (he has obviously murdered before, yet he seems to know the difference between good and bad). While Doyle (Linda's boyfriend) is depicted as a relatively abusive and flat character (one stereotype cannot hurt a film that much), Karl becomes a somewhat transformed individual who is symbolically altered due to his new relationship with Frank and his mother.
Overall, this was a quite touching, emotional story from Thornton. Although over 2 hours in length, the story progresses rather rapidly. It is told with a simple intention and premise, yet it is a film that is deeply complex.",1057363200,11,2393,5.170103092783505

Billy Bob Thornton's hero is the symbol of the weakest of the weakest : the children, the women, ...the handicapped people,... and the others.
The first 15 minutes of SLING BLADE are also a lesson of great cinema. Karl, for the first and the last time, will talk freely, in the dark. Let's hear the musical score of Daniel Lanois that goes with this scene. Emotionally perfect.

Karl is a very simple man and keeps to himself but is very eccentric. Shortly after returning home, he makes a few friends and even gets a job. Karl's only desire is to live a very simple and peaceful life, but there are a few things which he did not anticipate which could possibly bring him back to the same place where he spent most of his life.
Just something to ponder on... prisons and hopitals don't rehabilitate. A person who sincerely wishes to change must take a hard and deep look at himself and within himself. This film really got me thinking about how certain things that happened to me as a child still happen to me as an adult. All of us undoubtely have undesirable traits which have gotten us into trouble since we were children and we are destined to repeat the same mistakes over and over unless we get to the root of the problem.

207982,5,5554452574,"This understated masterpiece features a former bit player named Billy Bob Thornton, who had knocked around show biz for a few years in films like ""Chopper Chicks in Zombietown.""  But he had a story he was dying to tell.  He managed to scrape together enough support to make a short version of this film in 1994, and it generated enough attention to be expanded into this full-length feature version.
It's the story of a tremendously unfortunate person whose life fits the kind of horror stories you hear about child abuse.  Raised in a shed separate from his family, who wanted nothing to do with him, Karl is neglected, picked on, and beaten for years, at home and at school.  He ultimately commits a double murder, which he had thought was the right thing to do under the circumstances.  The film opens on the day Karl is released from the institution where he has been treated for understandably serious mental problems, and there's not a cliche in the film from start to finish (unless you count the hard-drinking white trash bad guy).
Thornton wrote, directed, and starred, and he bears no resemblance to the Thornton you may better recognize from films like ""Primary Colors,"" ""Armageddon,"" and ""Bandits.""  This chameleon of an actor loses himself in Karl, and it's indescribably hypnotic to watch the story unfold and to see his character develop, a remarkably closed individual with no context to relate to any human being, who becomes an unlikely father figure to a lonely boy and is ultimately drawn toward an unavoidable ending.
More good news is that in spite of its violent subject matter there is no blood or gore in this film.  All the violence is implied and felt far more keenly by the viewer than any simple-minded splatter film.  This is the story of multiple tragedies:  A human life wasted, leading to the ending of other lives, and several dysfunctional families trying desperately to cope with the weirdness of life....and of Karl.
John Ritter also earns respect for his performance as a gay man living in a small town, and Robert Duvall has an eerie cameo as Karl's nearly-forgotten father, himself descending into madness.  The human tragedy, southern style, has rarely been portrayed with such pathos and authentic feel.",1050883200,2,2245,4.88421052631579

207985,5,5554452574,"This movie won the Academy Award for best screenplay, and it's very easy to see why it was deserving of the acclaim that it received.
The movie centers around Carl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton), a mentally retarded man who has just been released from a mental hospital after spending most of his life there.  He's a convicted murderer who killed his own mother and her lover, but the audience is made to love him from the beginning and feel sympathy for his situation.  He befriends a young boy named Frank who is being raised by a single mother who has an abusive boyfriend.  The movie centers around the growing friendship between Carl and Frank, and how Carl decides to take matters into his own hands in order to protect Frank and his mother from the abusive boyfriend.
The strength of this movie is in the acting job by Thornton.  His character is a cross between Boo Radley from To Kill A Mockingbird (by Harper Lee) and Lenny from Of Mice And Men (by John Steinbeck).  While the audience is suspicious of Carl at the beginning of the movie because of his history, we are quickly assured that he is extremely gentle and kind.  Also of note is the performance by Dwight Yoakam as the abusive boyfriend.  You'll really hate his character, which obviously means that Yoakam did a great acting job.

The story concerns the release of a developmentally slow man who is released from a state hospital for killing someone when he was a child.  We watch him try to understand the world around him with whatever ability he has.  With the family of a widow, her son, the widow's brutal boyfriend, and gay friend, Karl (played by Thornton) struggles to understand what is right and how to make things right.
Some call it a sling blade, and some call it a Kaiser blade; it is all a matter of interpretation.  This film is filled with interpretations as people struggle to have their interpretation understood.  The brutal boyfriend, convincingly played by Dwight Yoakam, pushes for what he thinks life should be.  Karl tries to be a friend to the young boy, but learns the boy needs a good father.  Everyone will try to make life into what they hope it would be.

207988,5,5554452574,"There are those born into this world with a seemingly endless capacity for ""life""-- those with the mental wherewithal and ability to embrace and appreciate the endless bounties that nature has to offer.  And then there are those less fortunate; those who lack that acuity of mind and must content themselves with more immediate pleasures, like simply drawing breath in a world that has judged and declared them an accident of birth and has summarily withdrawn it's promise to them, deeming them somehow unworthy, and subsequently refusing to offer them more than the basic sustenances of survival, viewing them too often as so much refuse, with no intrinsic value whatsoever.  An abhorrent philosophy, to be sure, and yet one too often embraced by those better equipped, those who should know better and who should make it their business to reach out and at the very least attempt to discover what even the least among us has to offer, and to offer something in return.  It's a proposition put forth by writer/director/star Billy Bob Thornton, in ""Sling Blade,"" an emotionally charged drama that seeks out the best within the least of us.  And finds it.
After spending his entire adult life in a mental institution because of a crime he committed as a child, Karl Childers (Thornton) has been declared ""well,"" and is released from the ""nervous hospital"" (as he calls it) that has been his home these many years.  Born ""simple,"" the product of morally deficient parents, Karl neither demands nor expects anything from life; indeed, he wouldn't know how to.  His is a life devoid of hopes or dreams, as in point of fact, these are things he does not know even exist.  From the moment of his birth up until the day he entered the institution, Karl's life has been nothing more than a stoic and innate quest for survival.  And now, thrown back into the world, he returns to the small Arkansas town where he grew up.
When Karl gets to town and steps off the bus, he is alone and with nowhere to go.  Hungry, he soon discovers the joys of ""french fried potaters,"" which he gets at a fast food joint.  Circumstances then bring him into contact with a twelve-year-old boy, Frank (Lucas Black), and the two quickly ""make friends,"" in the purest sense, thanks to Frank's intuitive response, generated by the non judgmental innocence of youth, which allows the boy to see Karl as a person, rather than as an object of disdain.  And this simple act of friendship awakens in Karl something he has never known.  For the first time, perhaps, Karl has a reason to be.
Billy Bob Thornton is an enigma; Offstage, he seems perpetually attached to controversy, while as an artist, he never ceases to amaze.  As an actor/filmmaker he has consistently demonstrated true genius, which has never been more apparent than with this film, in which he presents a perspective on life that issues from a depth of staggering proportions.  With this story of perfect imperfection, he indicates the possibility that a perfect world can be achieved through the efforts of imperfect people; but that, unfortunately, those who deem themselves as ""perfect"" must also participate, which results in a world that is ultimately and unavoidable imperfect, and in a way that is forever unalterable.  We are stuck with what we have, then, but the film's message is clear:  we do have choices; and as such, the imperfect can have a positive impact-- through care and understanding, the world can at least be a better place.
It's a dramatic statement to make, and Thornton makes it directly, through the insightful presentation of his characters, all of whom are sharply drawn, honest and definitive, and with situations and dialogue that rings true throughout the film.  Still, some of the most telling moments are found in the silence of Karl's reflections; those ""moments"" that allow the viewer to process and digest the drama of the story as it unfolds, and which adds depth to the overall perspective of how Karl views the world, and how the world views Karl.
On the surface, Karl seems as enigmatic as his creator, but it's a perception due mainly to Karl's retiring, undemonstrable countenance, born of the incessant repression of his spirit and any and all vestiges of the humanity alive within him but unable to break free.  In Karl, Thornton has created a character who is something of a study in contradiction, a complex individual who at his core is actually quite simple and uncomplicated, yet possessed of deep-seated emotions fettered by the constraints of his environment and his lack of mental proficiency.  And Thornton so ably conveys the depth of Karl's feelings-- emotions he is so desperately trying to understand and express-- that he becomes oddly endearing and readily evokes the empathy of the audience.  Without question, this is Thornton's most emotionally powerful performance ever, for which he deservedly earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor (in a year in which Geoffrey Rush took home the gold for ""Shine"").
Director Thornton supported his dynamic portrayal of Karl by extracting some extraordinary performances from his terrific cast of actors, beginning with the work of young Lucas Black, who presents Frank in terms that are altogether natural and unassuming.  Dwight Yoakam, too, elicits a highly emotional response by creating a character, Doyle Hargraves, who is absolutely insufferable; this is the guy you love to hate.  And John Ritter is effective as the supportive Vaughan Cunningham, turning in a performance that is quite real and convincing, as does Natalie Canerday, as Frank's mother, Linda.
Also notable in supporting roles are J.T. Walsh, as one of Karl's fellow mental patients, a loathsome individual named Charles Bushman; James Hampton, as Jerry, the director of the institution; Rick Dial, as Bill Cox; and Brent Briscoe as Scooter Hodges.  A remarkable and unforgettable film, ""Sling Blade"" is a journey of emotional discovery that is absorbing and absolute.",1026691200,2,5974,4.975903614457831

207995,4,5554452574,"Billy Bob Thornton demonstrates his extraordinary talent on a variety of levels in this incredible movie; as an actor, he becomes a completely other person, totally immersing himself in his character, Karl. As a director, he shows a keen eye for Just The Right Angle in many scenes, which results in an really aesthetically pleasing film. On top of this, he also wrote the screenplay and developed all of the characters himself - truly amazing! His choice of soundtrack pieces increases the film's overall beauty, and, as soundtracks should, drives home the action on the screen.
There is some discussion of serious violence in the story, but almost none occurs on-screen; there is only one scene in the movie that is at all violent, and there is no blood or gore shown (but it is, um, ""heavily implied."") While there isn't any on-screen sexuality or blood, this isn't precisely a movie for children - the subjects dealt with are very adult, and despite the charming relationship between Karl and Frank, the themes and ethics of the story may upset some people.
The pacing of the film is fairly slow, but this isn't at all a detraction from its overall impact, and highlights how the laconic Karl plods through life with great presence, almost accidentally. There are many lessons to be learned from this ""simplistic"" film, on a variety of levels, and even though the basic premise has been done before, few have ever done it this well.
Sadly, the DVD doesn't have any extra treats on it - it would have been really great to have a commentary by Billy Bob to let us know what he was thinking and feeling at different points of the filming process, alas. Still, the sound quality is superb, and the video is lovely. This is one of those movies I plan to pull out from time to time, simply because it's so enjoyable.",1019347200,7,1814,4.671875

I've heard people link it to To Kill a Mockingbird and Forrest Gump, but I don't believe it needs to ride the coattails of anything--it's strong on its own.  This movie is ultimately about sacrifice, but it holds its own on all kinds of subjects, ranging from the treatment of criminally insane to domestic violence to child abuse.  John Ritter beautifully brings to life a warm, loving, stable gay character, and that, in my book, only adds to the film's far-reaching appeal.

  billy bob thornton is one of my favorite actors, now directors, too. it takes a deep man with a big heart to develop a story like this, even though part of me thinks it might've been a bit autobiographical in some parts, but who knows? i didn't even know it was he who was playing carl at first. but check out carl's eyes, you'll be thinking about them later on. billy bob totally envelopes carl.
  sling blade reminds me a little of forrest gump, one of my other favorite movies, but sling blade has a simplicity and honest ugliness and beauty to it that forrest gump did not capture.

Sling Blade was in the theater next door and just starting, so I figured what the hell. It turned out to be one of THE BEST movies I have ever seen. Billy Bob Thornton plays Carl, a semi-retarded man who has been locked up in a mental facility for the better portion of his life for killing his mother and a boy his age with a sling blade. So, now Carl is released from the institution with nowhere to go and no money in his pocket. He is befriended by a lonely boy whose mother allows him to stay in their garage. From the beginning of Sling Blade, it is clear that Carl is a good man and that the circumstances of his incarceration are in some way more than justified in his own mind. Billy Bob Thornton literally transformed himself into Carl who is a simple, loving man with a really cool accent. In the beginning of the film when Carl is told he is to be released, his reaction is not one of jubilation but terror. This man has been institutionalized his whole life and now at 50 the state has deemed him fixed. Carl encounters a lot of good in the world and a lot of bad. Some of the more memorable performances in Sling Blade come from Dwight Yoakam as the abusive (both mentally and physically) boyfriend and John Ritter as a gay store owner where Frank's mom works. Sling Blade raises more questions than it answers during its running time which keeps the viewers attention. After watching the film for about an hour it becomes pretty clear what is going to happen but never the less it is still an enthralling watch thanks in large part to the fantastic performances by Thornton, Yoakam, and Ritter.

Billy Bob Thorntons ""Carl"" is one of the most memorable, heartbreaking characters ever portrayed on film. If B.B.T. never makes another film, he should be revered as a brilliant artist. His portrayal of Carl is a gift to the human race. I am not one who is easily moved, but, even after repeated viewings, the final scene still makes me choke up.

Then they are really missing ""something very important"" inside themselves. Maybe even compassion. This film really has nothing to do with ""Being country"", ""The South"", ""Retarded"" or ""Gay.""

208012,5,5554452574,"Thornton has created an American classic that can send viewers in many different directions.  After my 20th or so time enjoying Sling Blade, I became not so sure Karl is slow after all.  He watches a dad brag about his son's football skills, so then goes out of his way to make Frank a star when they play sandlot.  He fixes like an expert lawnmowers and other things with small engines.  He understands and appreciates kindness given to him (""that boy has a big heart and lives inside it"").  Then he seems to realize that killing again is a solution to not only Frank's troubles but it will return Karl to a world in which he is a little more comfortable.  He seems to understand that he risks very little in doing so because he will be seen as crazy and not a murderer.
It is also ironic that every character in the movie talks of killing someone as a solution to a problem.  Is that another lesson Karl learns about the outside world?
Any slowness in Karl arguably stems from his treatment by his father, who raised him in a shed in the family back yard (where he learned to fix small engines), the effects of seeing his mother and a friend having sex, and his experiences in a mental hospital.  This is a man who picks things us quickly when given a chance.
I think the test of a great movie is that it gets better each time you watch it and that you learn different things each time you watch it.  I'm sure others will disagree with my take because I myself have just come around to feeling that way about it.  I'm sure Karl would be able to figure it out.",992390400,3,1561,4.261016949152542

You learn early that he has murdered his mother and the mother's lover and is finally being released into the wider world of free people. He soon makes friends with a young boy, and this is of course when the conflict begins. The boy lives in a contentious situation with his mother and the mother's abusive, alcoholic boyfriend (Dwight Yoakum). Thornton's character, Karl Childers, does a great deal to change the boy's life, ultimately insisting in the end, ""You Will Be Happy"". You will just have to watch to see how. Also memorable here are the characters played by the late JT Walsh and a highly underrated John Ritter. Also look out for film director Jim Jarmusch in a small role. A wholly surprising film with a unique and fresh script written by Thornton. It took everyone by surprise.",982800000,2,1028,4.88
208026,5,5554452574,"Billy Bob Thornton wrote, directed, and starred in this facinating story of a mentally retarded man's adjustment to life outside of an institution.
Sling Blade starts out with Karl (played by Thornton) telling his story to a high school reporter just before his release from the institution.  Once released, Karl befriends a boy who has no father and his mother is seeing a man-Doyle (played by Dwight Yoakam) who is both physically and mentally abusive.
First of all, the performance by Billy Bob Thornton is absolutely brilliant as Karl. His character is very well portrayed and very accurate. My mother worked in a mental institution for her entire life. I was exposed to mentally ill people from a very young age. Believe me (I also have a B.A. in Psychology) his portrayal is absolutely perfect. His actions, murmurings, and habits are very true to life. Although it may vary depending on the degree of mental illness.
Dwight Yoakam's performance as Doyle the abusive and often cruel boyfriend is also very convincing. It is said that ignorance is the enemy. Doyle does not understand mental retardation and thinks that anyone who is somehow ""different"" is a threat to his ego. Probably because of his compassionate girlfriend. He is also obviously threatened by Vaughn, a gay man(played by John Ritter) who is also a friend of his girlfriend.
I have heard many comment on ""why did she let Karl become a companion with her young son?"" or ""why did she let Karl live with them?""
My answer to this is who is the bigger monster?? Is it Doyle for being the ignorant, insecure, and abusive person that he is? Or is it Karl who is mentally retarded?? Linda is a very compassionate person but she is also very co-dependent on Doyle. The issue of co-dependent could be 1. Her losing her husband to suicide and needing a companion other than a friend such as Vaughn. 2. Financial reasons- she works at a dime store probably making minimum wage and has a hard time raising her son on this little money.
Why does she allow Frank to be friends with Karl??
I think that she allows this because she is very concerned with Frank's well-being. He obviously does not have a friend in Doyle. Doyle feels that he is a threat to the relationship with Linda, Frank's mother. Karl is someone that Frank can look up to as maybe a kind of ""father figure"" Karl is someone who will give her son encouragement and credit and see him for what he is. I also believe that Linda has a very close relationship with her son and trusts his ""instincts."" I think that Linda allowed Karl to live with them for protection, both emotional and physical from Doyle.
Sling Blade is beautifully written and acted. The cinematography and setting are outstanding. The characters are very real. Sling Blade is a classic to be. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates good cinema.",980812800,5,2853,4.706
208027,3,5554452574,"Billy Bob Thornton plays Karl Childers, a mentally retarded man who, as a 14-year-old boy, murdered his mother's boy friend (with a sling blade) because he mistook the man's having his way with her for a violent attack. When she apprized him of the facts, he killed her too.
Mmm hmm.
So Karl spends twenty-five years in the state mental institution and then they let him go. He has improved himself and learned to read. He's read the Bible and he reckons he understands it, mostly. He meets a boy and they become best buds showering one another and the audience with ""idiot savant"" and ""precocious lad"" bits of phony wisdom. Sometimes it gets so corny you just want to blush for the players. This is not to say that the script has no redeeming qualities. It does, especially the first, last and penultimate scenes-and there are some nice touches in between. But overall it's heavy-handed and insufferably preachy.
The main problem is Billy Bob himself, who also wrote the script and directed.  His performance (upper lip buried in lower, dead pan voice, etc.) is more mannerism than substance. In the beginning he had the timing down very well when Karl was saying little, but later on when Karl started dispensing all that wisdom, he had to talk faster and it started to come out phony. There's a great temptation, when writing of the down-trodden to cover ourselves with them, like the flag, and unabashedly champion the underdogs of society without regard for reality. When that happens we have a political movie, an ""I'm in favor of motherhood"" editorial instead of a film. Thornton falls into this trap as he attempts to catapult the second class citizens of our society halfway to sainthood over the straw body of bigots and the usual small town mentality. Consequently, both Karl and the boy become far too wise, too sensitive, too considerate, too loving and frankly, too saintly to be believed.
I'm not sure that anything could have allowed this movie to live up to the PC adoration given it, but Thornton might have helped his cause by cutting some of Karl's more goody-goody pronouncements, and by giving more time and scope to the other characters, especially the boy's mother (Natalie Canerday) who is too narrowly presented. He had a very fine cast: he should have used them more and himself less.
Dwight Yoakam was properly despicable as the insufferably self-centered, woman-battering, bigoted boyfriend of the boy's mother. John Ritter was close to brilliant as a small town, thirty-something gay. J.T. Walsh, as a psychopathic rapist/murderer, was sardonically humorous, and Robert Duvall's cameo as Karl's falling-down poor white trash father was good (as far as it went). Lucas Black, who played the boy was excellent. In short, the cast carried the film, and if Thornton had given them more depth and himself less he might have had a work of art.",973728000,6,2867,4.875

This is flat out one of the best films to come along in years.  The relationships of all of the characters is amazing.  The one that stands out is obviously with Carl and Frank (the young boy).  And also Carl has a unique relationship with Vaughn (John Ritter) and it is actually quite comical although not deep.  And then there is Doyle (Dwight Yoakam)  He hates everyone.  He even treats his so-called friends bad.  Yoakam is a very underated actor and he should get an award.  I caught myself laughing a lot at just how real this character was.  One of the great parts of this movie is when dominating Doyle almost forces his friends come over and play music on the front lawn and then screams at them all for not doing it all his way and wanting to leave and then kicks them out.

The story is about Karl Childers (Thornton); an inmate recently released from a mental institution after twenty-five years. This  tale of second chances and protecting what is precious to us is significant  in that it allows us to see that not all choices are bad despite their  outcome. Born and raised in the rural south, Childers is a man of quiet  wisdom and simple needs. He returns to the town of his birth to find he is  a total stranger with a need to re-assimilate. In the process of finding  work and trying to let go of his past, he befriends a young mother and her  son who immediately take a liking to Childers despite his situation of  being mentally challenged. The plot unfolds as he begins to meet more and  more people in the town whom either welcomes him with open arms or turn a  cold shoulder. Finally, just as his life is seemingly back in order, he is  confronted by perhaps the most difficult choice a man in his position is  required to make.

208049,5,5554452574,"I had avoided this movie because of all the hype, but last night I finally gave in and rented it. From the beginning, I was hooked!  I grew up in  Arkansas and while on the way to visit my mother last spring, stopped in  Benton to buy gas. I can tell you, these people still live there!  Possibly, if you're not from the rural South, you may think the characters  are hackneyed stereotypes, but if you grew up there, you would recognize  them as members of your graduating class! My husband and I did disagree on  one issue:  I felt the mother was terrible and deserved Doyle because of  her weakness and inability to protect Frank.  She should have murdered  Doyle herself, but other than that, it was one of the few movies that we  both loved. A thinking person's movie, if you're looking for gratuitus sex  or violence, don't waste your time.",940896000,4,845,4.444444444444445
208050,5,5554452574,"I LOVED this movie. The acting was terrific and the music is great. Billy Bob Thorton does an excellent job as the retarded man. I especially loved  the scene towards the end when Karl and the boy, Frank, are sitting on a  stump at the boy's secret spot near a pond. Karl has come to love the boy  and knows he won't be seeing him anymore because of what he is about to do  (I won't tell). He tells Frank he'd like to put his arm around him and  Frank says it's okay. As Karl sits there for a moment with his arm on  Frank's shoulder I started feeling the tears welling up in my eyes because  of the emotion this scene brought out in me. Very touching moment. There  are other great scenes too, but this one I watch over and over. I will buy  this video (DVD) ASAP. Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.",940809600,8,809,4.00625
208051,5,5554452574,"I've seen this movie three times and now I'm buying it - I know I'll never tire of it. I think of myself as something of a movie connoisseur, and this is one of my favorites.  It is such an interesting insight into the human  mind, the grey area between what's right and wrong, and how we treat and  judge one another.  Billy Bob Thornton proves his brilliance in so many  ways through this film.  I am truly impressed.",936316800,,419,4.2405063291139244
208052,3,5554452574,"Judging from the previous reviews, this movies is either loved or hated. Considering the fact that it was Thornton's debut as a director, I would say it was very well done. Yes, the storyline was rather thin, but it  somehow reflected the mind of Karl, from who's standpoint we view the film.  Furthermore, much of the credit should go to the fact that Thornton tackled  a sensitive issue, which gives any film a social relevance. I thought many  reviewers spoke about the film as an evening entertainment that somehow  didn't work for them (which is fine with me). The fact that the American  prison and rehab systems are becoming the sole producers of criminals and  misfits, made me watch this movie in a different perspective.",933552000,5,730,4.792
208053,5,5554452574,"I saw this film while I was in Sydney in '97. I wasn't doing anything in particular, apart from watching a lot of films. This one has stayed in my head since then. It was a truly wonderful experience for me. I don't  believe it will be released in Britain on video, which sickens me. We seem  to get a lot of dodgy sh**te from the States, which means that we have to  search harder for the little gems such as, Slingblade. I had a lump in my  throat throughout most of it; when I didn't, found myself laughing out (  which is rare for me ). So,  do yourselves a favour and watch or buy this.  Rarely have I made such good use of a couple of hours.",927763200,,647,3.9689922480620154
208054,2,5554452574,"Good Lord was this an over-hyped movie or what? I mean it's OK, but COME ON!  Some OK performances, but very very simplistic.",917827200,5,125,4.434782608695652
208055,5,5554452574,"Every nuance in this movie is sublime. Thornton assembles stunning cinematography, a menacing and melancholy soundtrack, flawless scripting, his own deft direction and stunning performances (who would've thought  Dwight Yoakam could act?) to create a true masterpiece of horror, tragedy  and redemption. If you haven't seen it yet, don't waste a second longer.  Even the Coen Brothers' sublime ""Fargo"" is a lesser film.",916963200,,419,5.619047619047619

He was over to top in the first Fargo made for TV and he was great in Goliath on Netflix or Amazon Prime.
