5324992,5,B009GG2T3A,"Take the leap.  BEST new show IMHO.  I often watched the episodes 2-3 times because I'd be laughing so hard.  Loved the movie In The Loop; Veep does NOT disappoint.  And, I love colourful words; I shan't lie.  Happy next season will be 10 episodes instead of 8, it wasn't enough!  Here's hoping for deleted scenes, et cetera, in the extras.  I'd totally vote for Selina.",1340668800,14,370,4.515151515151516
5324993,5,B009GG2T3A,"I'll tell you what...HBO has done it again! With only an eight episode first season, Veep has got my vote! The show is funny, witty, well acted, and at the end of each short 30-minute episode I'm left wishing the show was an hour. The good news: Veep has been picked up for a second season according to a 4/30/2012 Hollywood Reporter article.

Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office/dp/B0009VBTP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office</a>, the show is shot in that improv, hand-held camera, 'you are there' style of filming, which for me can get a little annoying (especially since filming in that style has been an epidemic of late), but that is the show's only negative in my opinion.

The show follows VP Selina Meyer and her bumbling staff as they try to navigate through the brutal behind the scenes world of Washington DC politics. And for the most part poor Selina and her staff find themselves in wayyyy over their heads in almost every situation. The result is the hilariousness that ensues as we watch Selina get herself into one embarrassing and humiliating situation after another, then try to get out of those situations without self destructing.

And don't get me wrong about the ""bumbling staff"" comment...I mean no disrespect to the supporting cast.  The chemistry between Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the cast of 6 primary supporting actors (Anna Chlumsky, Tony Hale, Reid Scott, Timothy Simons, Matt Walsh & Sufe Bradshaw) is the key ingredient to Veep's excellence.

4  stars for Veep. Vote this great, hysterical show into your cart!",1339977600,89,1600,5.2795275590551185
5324994,3,B009GG2T3A,"While the first season isn't the best, it does get better in the second and third season.  In my opinion, this show is just like The Office and Parks and Recreation, not just that all three are filmed like a documentary, but also that all three shows have weak first seasons but excellent second and third seasons.",1517961600,,314,4.508771929824562

Tried episode 2, same thing.  I am 73 and use the F word sometimes but 10 times in 10 minutes on each of the first 2 episodes - BAD.  Sometimes these type of words are used effectively, but in this case, no real reason for it to be used.  Very distracting and VERY disappointing given the star of this show.

5325669,4,B009GG2T3A,"Okay after all the raves on this show and all the awards, and my love for the Seinfeld crew, I figured we should start watching this, even if we are behind the times.  So I gave it four stars to attract your attention, rather than what might have been an easy five star rating.

It is a REAL FUNNY SHOW, but it does not pick-up (become real funny) until episode 4 or 5, and from episode 6 on it is hilarious.  Some shows need to take time building initial characters so the humor suffers at first.  I could also say, you could start at episode 6 and not really be lost, so the characters are self-explanatory pretty fast so episodes 1-4 may have been slower due to writers getting their grove for each actor and likewise, and then the magic begins.

I am up to episode 9 and can't wait to watch, what is next.  It does NOT have me at the BINGE TO THE END stage yet, but I am fearful it might just make me want to do that too -- oh well - another day gone form my life.  :)

When Louis-Dreyfus's assistant can't figure out a coffee machine, the other male assistant calls him, ""Autismo"" as in someone with autism and then the word, ""retard"" is used several times in succession.  Maybe it's to highlight the unpleasant nature of the characters who seem to frequent these disrespectful terms, but in any case, I think it's unnecessary and juvenile at best.  Might try to give this series another go later, but right now it's not capturing my interest for the right reasons, and only annoys me for the way it makes fun of people who have differences.",1477785600,2,748,4.874015748031496

Having watched the two seasons on Amazon I couldn't get enough and intend to purchase the remaining three seasons.  The show perfectly captures the intricacies and inanities of our political system and does a great job of skewering politics in general.  Considering the current political climate, this is a perfect detour away from what is very nearly a situation comedy in real life to this better plotted, funnier, and more pointed fictional version.  There aren't a lot of big laughs but there are certainly a lot of small ones and Julia does a terrific job, resisting the fall into slapstick or comedy that's too broad to be real.  A note of caution though: if you object to coarse language steer clear of this one.  The stream of cursing is constant and if there is a criticism of this show by me, it's that.  But putting that aside, a very funny and well-done sitcom.  And maybe this will be my write-in candidate for President this year.",1476748800,,1076,4.680851063829787

There are funny moments and I feel it is probably semi-accurate on how bills and other things get done in Washington DC politics, but after watching 3 episodes, I just don't care about any of them and it is going to be more of the same.  The 3rd episode had the Veep character interact with her college age daughter, which continued to show no real human feelings except annoyance, irrigation, fear, self-preservation - none of the characters have any principals, none are idealistic, none have a desire to better the world, etc. and it is not funny enough to survive on the humor alone.  Most of the humor is anxiety humor - can I get through the next crisis, basically.  It is not Cheers, Frazier, RoseAnne, Mash.  It is Seinfeldish, but with much less humor.

People who have family and loved ones with mental retardation don't care for it much either.  Whether it is a soldier who receives a traumatic brain injury, someone who tragically contracts an illness, or someone who happens to be born with an intellectual disability, this word causes pain and suffering to those who struggle with intellectual disabilities and those who love them.  But then, that is the world we live in.  Race is off limits unless you are white, sex and sexuality is off limits unless you are a straight man, but somehow we can still make fun of those wonderful folks in society who have to work 5 times harder to do things that most of us take for granted.  Lets not make them feel ashamed and unworthy.  Instead, lets love them and treat them with dignity and respect.  Furthermore, did they have to say f%$K every other word.  Maybe once in a while it can maintain some comedic value for folks who are not offended by it.  But in the 15 minutes we watched it seemed to be used pretty extensively.  Not a fan.

5326158,5,B009GG2T3A,"You might say my wife and I were late to the party on Veep, since over the years we've been too stingy to add HBO to our cable bill.  So imagine my amazement when, during this first season, there's an episode devoted to the vice president deciding as a PR move to show her transparency by releasing all of her and her staff's email correspondence -- but it's tempered by a scene when Louis-Dreyfus and her staff stand around and candidly discuss embarrassing matters they (of course) must leave *out* when they release said correspondence to the public.  All of this had a very familiar ring to it, so it's a little amazing that season 1 aired 4 or 5 years ago.  And I suppose that's what makes Veep both engrossing and repellent: it wickedly satirizes our federal government with an insider's matter-of-factness that's at once disarming and alarming.  In the end we might as well laugh at the venal sins of our elected officials, because the alternative -- blowing it up and starting over -- is too ghastly to contemplate.",1475193600,,1023,4.6353591160221

If you don't laugh at all the fabulous writing by Iannucci and company, then you are dead or soon should be. The concept, the execution and the genuinely hilarious Ms Louis Dreyfus (yes, of that elite financial Dreyfus family) in a role that was made just for her=== seriously, no one else can pull this off =====are all first rate TV with lotsa profanity thrown in and likely making politicians actually look better than they might be in real life.

5326531,5,B009GG2T3A,"We have two dogs, one named Olive and one named Magic. We will sometimes call our dog Magic, Black Magic because he's a black dog. Both of our dogs are anxious and we have tried for over a year to find a way to distract Olive and Magic when we leave the house for extended periods of time. Up until recently, when we left the house even for a short time, we would receive many complaints from the neighbors about strange noises coming from our house. Our dogs would get so anxious that they would bark, whine, and run around the house making small tapping sounds on the floor. This bothered our neighbors and frustrated us because we would be out having fun and receive a nasty, threatening message forcing us to come home and ruin a fun afternoon or evening out and about. Thankfully, we have found our solution. Veep: Season 1. The comedic antics of Julia Louis-Dreyfus as vice president of the United States thoroughly captivate and engage our dogs attention. While previously they would run around wild being obnoxious, they are now completely engaged in the television. And, thankfully, because we turn Veep: Season 1 on the smart television it plays the first six episodes guaranteeing us at least 5 hours of worry-free time away from home. As for the program itself, I have only seen the first 10-15 minutes but I have seen it everyday for the past few months. From what I've seen, it looks funny and unique. I haven't seen enough to rate it myself but my dogs have never been more well behaved so for that I give it 5 stars.",1473465600,4,1532,4.514388489208633

It seemed like a bunch of pre-teen boys wrote the script and were swearing just to swear because it was cool.  Also, the women characters got more and more crazed, screaming at people like they were prima donas and not leaders.  This show could have been great - Madame Secretary only funny.

Granted I wasn't big on ""The Office"" either, so if that was your type of show maybe you'll enjoy this more than I.  The first episode kind of just jumps in there with little setup or background or effort to place each actor/roll/character in the viewers mind, so I felt a little lost as well which didn't help.  It's not bad if you've got time to waste, just I wouldn't go out of your way if you've got better things to do.",1469836800,5,487,4.159574468085107

Only two characters are likeable and they're relegated to side roles. I get that it's critiquing the lengths politicians will got to get elected, but to be a good show, a show I can root for, they at least have to be good natured.

Our Veep is charming, eager, and most attractive--her wardrobe is to die for!  The depiction of the people who surround her and assist her in carrying out her duties really carries this series.  There are those eager to do her bidding whether fetching coffee or running an errand, those who are out to make her look good at all costs, the bleeding hearts who want so badly to do good things for the ""folks back home,"" and those with their pet projects which they pursue at all costs.

I have always liked Julia Louis Dreyfus, and I thought the premise of the story was an interesting one. Now, I am definitely NOT a prude, and my language isn't always as pristine as it ought to be. But I wasn't prepared for the extreme amount of vulgarity with which I was assaulted. When, it seems, that every 4th word is some form of f***, I'm royally turned off. With the freedom of being on a cable channel as opposed to network TV, this series is way over the top in my opinion. I doubt that I'll finish watching the episodes of season 1, and I certainly will NOT be moving on to the next season! The purchase was a $10 investment in futility.",1469232000,,739,4.211267605633803

Dare I mention her name in the same breath as Meryl Streep?  I think it is safe to do so. For the people who mistakenly believe that Ms. Louis-Dreyfus plays Julia Louis-Dreyfus, watch her entire body of work--most especially Veep. Watch the emotion she conveys with the slightest of facial movements. Even her nuanced performances are nuanced. Furthermore, I noticed Veep season 1 has less 4-star and 5-star reviews than the subsequent seasons.  Veep season 1 is worthy of 5 stars nevertheless, and the first season sets the foundation for a brilliant series. The other actors are spot-on, well-cast and the perfect ensemble, but Veep belongs to Julia Louis-Dreyfus.  Enough Said. :-)",1468627200,,873,5.083916083916084

I am not a politician, so I can't speak from experience, but I can imagine that these are truly the frustrations that are faced in government. If you like raunchy humor, the insults that are thrown back and forth are hilarious. I think the very first episode was the worst, as far as language goes, or maybe I just got numb to it.

All this show does is provides more of the same tired dialog that a woman in office would be shallow, self serving, moronic, incompetent...disappointing to say the least and harmful at worst.",1466208000,,562,4.3238095238095235

I can understand the high theatrical awards given the series, but I couldn't finish watching this first season.  It kept drumming with sarcasm and punches. No relief. Outlandish and not just in vulgarities. In this show, Julia Louise Dreyfus took on a role that reflected a similar character to her Seinfield one, but she went a step higher. Very beautiful, almost noble, wrecked with coarseness, only to recover to repeat the cyle. Her character desperately does anything to protect POTUS image. I had to look up on this series. It went on for five or six seasons. Hugh Laurie from the TV series House MD plays a senator at some point. I won't hang in there to see what his character does.",1466121600,,835,4.758620689655173

It's no single thing that dooms this show. The writing is intelligent. The acting is good. The production value is solid. But somehow it just doesn't all gel together.

I get the plot. I kind of like the characters. I just couldn't find myself caring how any of it worked out. Somehow it felt like watching actual politicians conduct day to day business (which I assume was the goal for the producers) rather than watching a comedy show. Yes, it's funny in places, but it's not enough to sustain the show.

The comedy is in the mundane nuances of politics, not actual jokes. I get why people like it. But it's not for me at all. (Note: The profanity doesn't bother me at all. It should have more. That's always a common thread among low star reviewers that there is too much swearing on any HBO series. Like...hello. The letters HBO should have tipped you off about what would be in the content.

  this show is/was hilarious.  the people in the show use nsfw language like it was normal.  it does not seem like our political scene is something most people would want to get involved in as a future job.  why would you have to please someone who does not like your policies to make our society better?  shouldn't we all be working to make things right?  this show makes conflicts seem silly...well, maybe political conflicts are silly.  why have 8-10 cars in a procession everytime the veep goes somewhere?  seems wasteful.  but that is comedy...a great show and characters.",1464307200,,584,4.808080808080808

I **really** appreciate how the writers never show their personal political leanings.  They don't introduce topics that the viewer instantly identifies with either today's real-world Left or Right.  Kind of amazing for a show that on its face is nothing but politics, to remain apolitical.  Unlike shows such as West Wing in that regard.  Congrats.

I couldn't give it five stars, though. Though I'm only through two episodes from Season 1, I have heard the ""F Word"" and all its permutations way more than I ever imagined. If someone thinks the average American resorts to ""F..."" as frequently as the ""Veep"" cast, then he, she, or they are laboring labor under a misapprehension.

She does those classic 'freak-out' moments that made her hysterical in ""Seinfeld"" and ""New Adventures of Old Christine"", but when she does those in a quieter atmosphere, it gives off an uneasy feeling that kills the comical vibe of Veep.

I know it's about politics, so it's no surprise there are a lot of shallow, ambitious characters that don't hesitate to stab each other in the back if it serves their immediate purpose.  But, in addition to the basic mean-ness of the characters being a bit over the top, the real problem is that it just isn't entertaining.  The Seinfeld show was also about a bunch of ethically challenged people, but it was hugely entertaining.  I don't have sufficient critical skills to determine why Seinfeld worked and Veep doesn't, but to me the difference is striking.  Of course, I watched only the very first episode and can't say if it improved after that.

If you're offended by such things, then beware. Even though there are a number of amusing situations that come up in the political venue of the series, the Homosexual lewdness is continuously being brought up and pushed in the views face.

5329698,3,B009GG2T3A,"Has some good moments, but feels like ""Elaine Benes"" character from Seinfeld was actually elected VP.  The level of incompetence & petty in-fighting of her senior staff is also sub-par, but has the same go-nowhere banter as the old Seinfeld series.  It worked with Seinfeld series, as the characters were just ordinary people & so a certain on-going ineptness wasn't going to harm anyone but themselves (for the most part).  If this had been about some corporate exec, or a lower public office (like mayor or congresswoman, etc.), this might have seemed a bit funnier.

But for the person who's a ""heartbeat away from being the Most Powerful Person in the Western World"", it just doesn't play well.  I watched the entire season, as i think Julia Louis-Dreyfuss has a lot of talent & potential.  I kept hoping that after a few episodes the series would ""find its legs"" & level out.  Sadly, that was not the case.  Not terrible, but not as good as i had hoped.  In all fairness, this is a comedy (as opposed to The West Wing, The Newsroom, & House of Cards [both American & British versions]), so the level of viewer ""mental engagement"" is not expected to be as elevated as those series.  But it might have been?  At least, that's what i'd hoped.

5329788,4,B009GG2T3A,"This show is hysterically funny.  What makes it difficult to watch, and leaves me with feeling like I've been kicked in the head 100 times per episode is it's use of the ""F"" word so many times in one sentence.  Do the writers not have enough dialogue?  It will take me a while to watch the entire season because it's like walking through a gauntlet every episode, thus I have to prepare myself mentally.  I want to keep watching because it is such a smart, funny, show.  Good characters, love their vulnerability and obvious personality types.  I'm no prude, but it sure would be nice to enjoy something smart and funny without the language - and I don't mean sprinkled here and there -  three and four times per sentence.  I literally cannot understand why smart people want to bring themselves so low....of course the characters are not necessarily smart - they are just politicians.",1457308800,,885,4.664516129032258

I am a 'West Wing' and 'Madam Secretary' follower so I was hoping for something I could sink my teeth in to combined with a bit of light humor.  First of all....the foul language was unnecessary and I am not a prude by any stretch.  The 'F Bomb' is no stranger to me.  But I don't thing the abundance of crass dialogue was necessary.  I also found her very difficult to believe in that role.  Many of my friends have enjoyed this show but I didn't even finish the first episode.

I also find that it represents the lack of importance of the Vice President position other than if the President died.  Often she asked any message from the president which is a hoot. All the characters are unique and refreshing.  She wants to make her mark and she finds issues and creates issues.

I only watched the first segment, but I was turned off by the number of times that the ""F-bomb"" was dropped. That has its place when it appears selectively, but I lost respect for the writers for the semi-automatic barrage of its use as the adjective of perpetual choice.  Perhaps a very young audience thirsts for the word in the same way that they relish the moment that they turn 21 and can legally binge drink. I am sorry to say that I won't continue to watch the show.

5330255,2,B009GG2T3A,"""Last Man Standing"" is my benchmark for a 5-star sitcom. If that one is not on your list of favorites you best stop reading now. Veep is NOT un-watchable (that would be one star). Half way through Season 1 Episode 3 we decided we'd given it enough time to trip our trigger even slightly. Sometimes humorous on the rare ""surprise"" moment (that's part of what makes comedy funny - the unexpected). If I were a twenty-something who'd just shared a doob it might be funnier. It's not the cast's fault...I reckon they do the best they can with the script they're handed. We don't rate it good enough to hang in there through Season 4 and try to figure out how it won an Emmy. Critically acclaimed? Hmmm...those critics must have low standards for a sitcom, but then again, maybe the screenwriter(s) got it figured out after 3 seasons, though I'm unclear why it was renewed for a 2nd season. Maybe the cast and crew agreed to work at half salary? I felt strongly enough about the poorness of this show to write this review, and I have MUCH better things to do with my time.",1454112000,,1067,4.448979591836735

It's politics as I imagine it, with lots of scheming,  jealousy, hypocrisy and vitriol.  But also, with constant sharp, witty, irreverent dialogue that I doubt you'd actually hear much of in Worshington.  I was not very impressed with Julia Louis Dreyfus' network shows (post Seinfeld), but in this, she has really come into her own.  The supporting cast is excellent, with a few familiar faces from both movies and TV, and a few new faces that perform to the level of the more seasoned actors.  Be fair warned, the language is foul, but there is no nudity or sex scenes.

5330482,5,B009GG2T3A,"This show is brilliant, and JLD is criminally under-appreciated by the viewing public. At this point in TV history, it's impossible not to note the great similarities in thesis behind this show and HOUSE OF CARDS, another fine (if much darker) show about the inner workings of Washington, D.C. (and the White House, in particular). That said, VEEP is the stronger vehicle for this project--it's writing is sharper and leaner than HOUSE OF CARDS's and avoids the arch melodrama that occasionally (now, frequently) mars the latter (even though HOC is, indeed, a dramatic vehicle). VEEP knows that the Kafka-esque interplay of power, gender, and politics in government is damn funny at its core, even while showing how deeply alarming it is to consider that ""bureaucratic logjam"" is the best possible way to describe how the national apparatus works; HOC by contrast takes itself way too seriously. Ambition has a way of organically shaping events, which is reflected perfectly in JLD's Selena Meyer (and far less so in Spacey's arch-villain Frank Underwood). So when you get tired of the doom and sinister overtones of HOC, try a dose of the far more satisfying and illuminating VEEP. You won't regret it, and you'll almost certainly learn much more about how power really works at that level--especially when it comes to the role gender plays in the exercise of that power.

Dependance on this type of language doesn't enhance any production, and in fact, loses more viewers than you probably realize.  It's a shame, too, because I suspect this may have been a show I would have enjoyed.  I'm guessing that most of the shows available on Prime TV will disappoint me in this regard, except those from the mainstream media outlets.

In any event, this is definitely a favorite of mine. It's sharp as hell, witty, with a complex female character.

I like the fact that the Veep plays a such an abrasive person. Women are usually relegated to being the nurturing,fun-spoiling,  tut-tutting ones on sit-coms. This will turn that on its head and for that reason. As others have said, she's both unlikable but yet one can certainly empathize with her.

One of the scenes involves  the planning around getting ready for a political fundraising event.  There are multiple cultural references as well such as Simon & Garfunkel, The Washington Post, Doogie Howser etc.  Anna Chlumsky plays  as Amy Brookheimer, one of Meyers right hand assistants and I noticed that Kate Burton (from the tv series Scandal) also makes an appearance in Veep.  I admit that Veep Season One, while fictional and based on the idea of Selina Meyer (Julia Louis Dreyfus)starting as Vice President, does underscore from my perspective that I feel that our country is ready for a female president (Hillary Clinton).  Im normally for whoever is the best person for the job (regardless of whether they are Republican or Democrat) but I currently prefer to avoid saying why I prefer to vote for Clinton over who currently looks to most likely win the Republican ticket; Donald Trump (especially since I would otherwise feel like a a hypocrite because I reviewed a book by his daughter Ivanka Trump back in January 2015 before I even knew for sure that Trump was certainly running for president and a Travel & Leisure magazine subscription magazine back in February 23,2011 for the February 2011 Travel & Leisure magazine issue that also featured an article about Ivanka Trump on page 40).",1446163200,,1629,5.011111111111111

5331010,5,B009GG2T3A,"As a longtime Seinfeld junkie I was skeptical at first that ""Veep"" would be worth watching, but after two episodes I found myself binge watching the rest of Season 1 as well as Seasons 2 & 3, then staying current on Season 4 until the finale.  When I explain the show to others, it's usually ""Imagine 'The Office', but taking place at the highest levels of government, with plenty of profanity.""  Veep also does a great job of parodying what must be sheer anarchy behind the scenes of any given government official's indiscretions and really play up the ""cover stories"".  The abundance of one-liners and coined terms is also worth mentioning; although not on par with Seinfeld's ""Shrinkage"" or ""Soup Nazi"", Veep uses terms like ""FLOTUS"" (First Lady of the United States) and ""FDOTUS"" (First Dog of the United States).  Drawing another parallel with Seinfeld, the cold-blooded tendencies and sheer indifference to the struggles of others are characteristics that almost the entire cast shares in the show, which probably fits in nicely with how the public views politicians in the first place, not to mention there is some first-rate talent playing cabinet members/senators/congressmen.

Bottom Line: Given the time, I would binge watch multiple seasons, over and over again.",1445472000,3,1274,5.105769230769231

When talking about a sick Senator who is on life support:"" He's got so many tubes he looks like a set of bagpipes!""

Good detail on the set, looks like the real DC White House offices.  Veep and her 'people' are constantly adjusting their positions on the changing situations of real life politics.  There is a hilarious cast of comedic characters, who weave in and out of the frame, interacting with each other on political, professional, and personal planes. Nice change of pace to see powerful women with men serving as assistants and interns instead.  The shallowness of politics, the importance of presentation over substance or morality, is dealt with a light comedic, albeit satirical hand in some scenes.

Julia Drefus is a pleasure to watch, spirited, savvy, smiling and sincere, but with the right Machiavellian mind to steer through the pitfalls of politics at the top echelons.

However, even though I am not a political person, I can detect that there are lots of ""politics"" going on underneath the surface and the writing is very fast and on point.  For those who savor these kinds of situations that the Veep has to go through and those of the layers of people that surround her, I'm sure there is lots of ""tongue in cheek"" material to enjoy.

5331560,4,B009GG2T3A,"I'd give an extra half star if it was possible. The show starts out trying to get its legs while it's doing some character development. You can tell that they didn't have the chemistry on screen down pat until 2 or 3 episodes in. Once they got going.... it's one of the best political comedies I've ever seen. After (what I felt was) a disappointing run on ""Old Chrisitne"" Julia Louis-Dreyfus gets back to doing the comedic acting she did best on Seinfeld. The running joke of ""did the president call?"" just gets funnier each time it's strung into an episode. I truly enjoyed ""The Thick of it"" which is the British show that ""Veep"" was based off of. Not all adaptations from across the pond are stellar, but this one is. Similar to the way ""The Office"" worked out, this show stands on its own. Veep deserves all the awards and accolades it has earned. Though everything revolves around Drefus' character, I'd consider the show to be an ensemble cast at its heart. Perfect casting all around. On an anecdotal note, it's great to see the little girl from ""My Girl"" grow into a talented comedic actress. Also love seeing anyone from the cast of ""Arrested Development"" (Tony Hale) in a comedy. Also Matt Walsh is brilliant... and i promise that's the last of the kudos.

I'd be shocked if I didn't give the next season five stars.",1442448000,7,1326,4.548117154811716

This is a more grown up but still deliciously self-centered Elaine from the Seinfeld years. Her face as she gets the news the POTUS may be having a heart attack is a terrific study in glee, unsuccessfully hidden by faux concern.  The supporting cast is terrific. I had no idea Anna Chlumsky (former child star) had such great comedy chops. Her facial expressions are priceless.  Everyone else is great too, from Mike (recognize him from UCB?) to Jonas the slimeball who misses no opportunity to remind everyone he works in The White House.

The series would have done better had they began with a convincing looking Vice President and then proceed from there. Unfortunately, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss only looks a little convincing as a Vice President ala Sarah Palin and then the character was set up to behave like an air head.

In watching some of the other original comedies, such as; Mash, Fraser, Will & Grace,  they had good writers that used the situations to create comedy, not the swearing.  Some of the swearing is understandable, to get the point across but, the amount of profanity on the show is insulting.  The situations made us laugh and the Veep herself, is very funny.  Her facial expressions and her ambition comes across and her timing is right on. But the F word, is that what it is like on Capital Hill?

VEEP is very unique, but if you are a fan of quick intelligent humor such as 30 Rock and the fascinating political strategy of The West Wing then you will feel at home in the hands of the show's creator, Armando Lannuci.

5332058,4,B009GG2T3A,"I kinda discounted the people who told me this was good.  Mainly because after watching a couple episodes of The New Adventures of Old Christine, I didn't think JLD had any range as an actress.  I was picturing a ditzy woman dropping F bombs and a cast of clowns, especially since I knew The Motherlover from Arrested Development was in this..

The entire cast is excellent-- I particularly like the toned down Buster Bluth and Anna Chlumsky.  And I think JLD is very believable as the Veep Selina Meyer.  She has the self awareness of Sarah Palin and the personal warmth and empathy of Hillary.  I have no issue with the profanity, which seems to be the number one reason people give for hating Veep.  Actually, without the over the top vulgarity, you wouldn't even know this was a satire.  The profanity illustrates how those in power conduct themselves with impunity.  If I was involved in politics, I'm sure I could relate to Selina Meyer's comment, ""I feel my soul sliding out my a--"".

Isn't that a great line?  ""No!  It's vulgar and I won't stand for it.  One Star!! Now, Jim Gaffigan and Last Man Standing.  Those are funny shows!""  This is my favorite kind of humor, and I really wish Amazon would have picked up The Onion because so few shows have the right balance of crudeness, irreverence, and intelligence.  4+ stars.",1439251200,2,1331,4.6239316239316235

Haven't screenwriters learned that simply using expletives does not equal comedy? Every few sentences there's an expletive here, and then an expletive there. Interesting how in great sitcom series such as ""Seinfeld"" or ""M*A*S*H*,"" ""Will & Grace, ""All in the Family,"" etc. there were no use of explatives (obviously because public networks would not allow them). Instead, screenwriters dug deep and wrote comedy that was without guile. Lazy writers rely on expletives and violence as a simple means to heighten a situation's intensity. The writing of this series is witless and relies on spineless characters in such low quality situations that I found it painful to watch. I have been a long time fan of Julia Louis-Dryfus and her talent as a comedian/actor is without match; however, her genius is not enough to make VEEP into more than it is- an uninteresting series without creativity.

5332217,4,B009GG2T3A,"If you awake one day and suddenly find yourself in need of a primer in conversational profanity, look no further than Season 1 of VEEP.  In this vehicle for Seinfeld alum Julia Louis-Dreyfus she plays failed Presidential candidate Selina Meyers whos stuck with the thankless #2 job.  The shows kind of like House of Cards in its cynical portrayal of Washington politics minus the sex, murder, plotting, and scheming but with a comedic twist.
 Louis-Dreyfus is excellent and has matured since her days playing Elaine and looks terrific.  The mostly unknown supporting cast does a fine job portraying a team of sycophants.  The stories involve watching the staff groveling for their high maintenance boss as shes ignored by the POTUS while still trying to make a difference and gain some respect.  The writing is good and there are many funny moments watching these dysfunctionals try to govern our nation.
  Back to the language; having spent four years of my military career in the Army where obscenity  is the lingua franca of the service I personally don't find this show offensive.  I guess in politics, like the Army if you don't punctuate every utterance with the F-word you're just not taken seriously if were to believe this show.  Its not as bad as Deadwood but many will have their sensitivities challenged.  Despite this I recommend VEEP for an snarky take on life inside the beltway.",1438300800,2,1394,4.910256410256411

I like the star of the series as a comedienne and she also earns some serious acting chops with this role.

Not only did I not laugh through the 3 episodes I endured I was not even smiling.  I even hit the fast forward through some really badly written yet predictable attempts at humor.

You can change her name from Elaine to Christine to Selena and you still have basically the same character only as VP it makes the least amount of sense.

The writing is terrible.  It is formulaic and predictable.  The only character I can say I like is the secretary.  She is a sip of water in a desert of unfunny.",1438214400,8,724,4.303703703703704

Julia Louis-Dreyfuss manages to walk the fine line between being likable and despicable.  She's an anti-heroine with a foul mouth and a bucketload of anxieties who, as with many actual vice presidents, got her position after a failed run for the Oval Office.  In Season One, she's fighting to make her mark and craft her legacy while being sidelined from any real power.  The recurring line -- ""Did the President call?""  ""No."" -- is the season's motif.  No one really cares about her except her oddball staff, whose hopes are pinned to the vice president's star.

5332414,4,B009GG2T3A,"Veep Season 1 starts out a bit slow. I watched with a friend and he was a bit underwhelmed with the first episode and dropped the series. I personally was patient until about episode 3 where I started to enjoy the characters more and the humor was a bit more improved. From there however, the series skyrockets. Julia Dreyfus and Anna Chlumsky are great comedic actresses and both do an OUTSTANDING job. The characters are all annoying and rude, but still likeable for their inability to get off the struggle bus no matter what they do. Tony Hale does a great job but still has some inklings of Buster Bluth from Arrested Development which is kinda great. My point is, be patient and don't expect completely loveable and accessible characters but enjoy the clever humor, the dry delivery, and the hilarity of some very rude people digging themselves deeper into political holes :D",1437177600,,880,4.758169934640523

And no, I'm not a prude. I use the F-word when it's warranted, but a constant stream of expletives isn't needed to be funny people!

Dreyfus plays an insulting, gutter-mouthed, crass, controlling, manipulative diva in her role as vice president, and her staff play subserviant, butt-kissing whatever-you-want-me-to-do roles. the show makes you think about how things might actually be in the white house, or with famous people (how they actually act, and interact with other people, and how they get things done or not done).  it is worth a look-see if you like odd humor.  otherwise, pass on it.",1436745600,,974,4.537142857142857

The first episode or two I thought pedestrian, but after trying a few more I was hooked. So stick with it. The characters develop over time. And listen carefully for recurring gags which make a statement about the main character's, Selina, place in the political process.

If  one certain word were omitted (and if you watch the show, you know what that word is) they would have to write at least 25% more dialogue, so maybe that's the reason.  They have used and misused  this certain word as every part of speech (except prepositions & articles), which is no longer innovative, but has become the ubiquitous norm.

5332937,3,B009GG2T3A,"You can't really fault the actors--the script is just not that funny.  It seems they're trying to tell the same joke over and over, which is that the VP really has nothing to do, but must at all costs look really good doing it. The lines come at a breakneck speed, especially those about the supposed political situations that are coming up, but the writers have done really nothing to make the viewers care about this bill or that person...
Spin City worked because the goofy politician was in charge (Mayor of New York City,)  and his staff had to cover his tracks all the time. VEEP  doesn't work as well, because they start with the premise that the VP is pretty much useless anyway, so what's the point?",1435276800,,708,4.4728682170542635

Used once in awhile to emphasize a situation, thus making it a very strong adjective is one thing, but constantly used by every character is off putting and insulting to the audience.

5332964,4,B009GG2T3A,"It's funny - not overtly political.  It thrives on the miserableness of people we all wind up working with.  The back-stabbing, pettiness, over-reaching ambition - is all there - and very cleverly rendered.  The acting, as an ensemble, is first rate.  These characters feel lived -in from the pilot.  And the dialogue is sharp, surprising, frantic and consistently funny.  It's right up there with His Girl Friday.  The directing is its own extraordinary piece of business.  Multiple moving cameras and angles - nothing about it is visually like a ""sitcom"".  A super fast paced enjoyable half hour - and now I'm hooked.",1435276800,,619,4.990196078431373

One of the problems I've noticed with HBO presentations is that they often will take a really good story such as this one or Deadwood and then diminish it with sloppy writing and gratuitously bad language. Stringing three ""F-bombs"" together in a five word sentence works against the fine performances of the cast. I have no problem with realistic language that furthers the plot but this series makes me start to believe that the writers are being paid by the ""F**k.""

This is totally a character-driven dramedy - all of the chuckles come from the cast and how they interact with each other. Julia Louis-Dreyfus shines when she's at her most self-absorbed here and I think they started to figure that out a few episodes in. The supporting cast is just great, and watching their antics as they try to cover up the Veep's blunders and get out of each other's way is the best part of the show.",1433721600,,593,4.165217391304348

Each episode traverses one awkward situation after another, with brief interludes of successes so we (and the characters) can take a breather before being thrust into the next crises.
In my opinion, this is not a partisan comedy.  Although you can place most of the characters in a political party, the focus is on their personal personality crisis, rather than a party-based crisis.

There is no character development and no explanation about cornstarch and forks, although that's all they seem to be focused on. JLD is good, but why is she the VP? Why does she swear like a sailor? Why does she spend most of her time walking and talking (Hi West Wing!) with her staff of....who knows? Why is the VP coming to work dressed in a cleavage revealing tight red dress?

And as I vaguely recall, the show had garnered awards during its run.
Was somewhat bored with regular cable...and again...so I decided to give it a try.
Let's watch something that has won some awards was the driving factor.
And the bottom line was that it was totally, totally worth the watch!
Everything about this show (to me anyway) is brilliant.
Writing, directing, acting...even the sets...even the music score...everything is worth noting.
It's the perfect storm of creativity and smarts when you get all the right people together.
And in the case of ""VEEP"" all the right people are working together.
I know that when you talk about a show there are many, many people involved.
I thank you all but especially I thank all the actors for their incredibly nuanced performances.
Just watching their facial expressions when they deliver their lines alone is worth the price of admission.
Don't get me wrong...the scripts are awesome but the delivery of those words is impeccable.
Everything about this show screams intelligence.

5333977,1,B009GG2T3A,"This looked like it it had promise as an interesting story, my wife and I like series with strong female leads. However, we shut it down and deleted the series from our watch list after the first 15 minutes.

It looked like the screen writers had no real ideas how to develop the plot and tried to make up for their lack of writing skills or even basic writing craft it by putting gutter profanity and vulgarity in nearly every line of dialog. Listening to the characters interact was about like reading the dialog written on the restroom stall walls in your average middle school. The leaders of our political parties were portrayed as not even having the skill to cuss like educated people.

I assume that the screen writers were expressing their abject contempt for the political class of people who inhabit  Washington, D.C. but I would expect a more subtle attempt to parody the Pols than making them all talk like middle schoolers trying to sound vulgar. I suspect that the real truth is that the screen writers didn't really know themselves how to cuss in a sophisticated manner.

As a writer myself I feel that this kind of writing is an insult to our profession and whatever network functionary signed off on this series and these scripts should be fired for gross incompetence and deliberately insulting the intelligence of all their hoped for viewers. I hope this isn't a true read on how the networks estimate the viewing taste of their audience, because if it is they despise us and hold us in contempt.

I rarely curse and I wasn't offended.  Others think the show isn't funny and thought it lacked witty banter, but they just didn't get it.  The show is filled with witty banter, you just have to be clever enough to catch some of it.  I didn't laugh out loud, but I was very entertained by the dialogue.  It's also funny because this is supposed to be satire, yet at the same time, you think that it's probably very realistic.  Washington probably IS just like this.  Some reviewers found that depressing.  What did they think Washington is like?  The characters have chemistry and Julia's comedic timing is, as usual, outstanding.

One good suspicion would be that our leaders are folks just like the characters in this coarse excuse of a sit-com series? Julia was never funny.  That other show used her differently, never as a carrying comic figure. In this stinking mess, she is so far from any semblance of comic, it really hit me that these cynical, sarcastic ""figures"" may actually be fairly well-drawn characteristics with their real-life counterparts. Just stupid, the reals and the phoneys.  Cut from the same cloth, at least. C'mon, Amazon!  Quit giving your paying members such useless crap. Life is difficult enough.

Had some laughs from these 6 episodes: Season One = Episode 3; Season Two = Episodes 3 and 9; Season Three = Episodes 3, 7, and 8.  Saw all these for under $30.

In Veep, it's almost as if  the actress doesn't believe the words coming out her mouth, she looks like she thinking to her self, ""someone shoot me, and thank god I have a job"". Typical OLD pre menopausal woman jokes, blah blah blah. AND don't get me wrong I'm all for vile, vulgar language, I love shows with witty dark humor as well, but this just missed the mark at being funny. Her cursing is stupid, it's used in all the wrong places.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus is in her element as the VP to a never seen President, focused on wheeling and dealing her way into any kind of relevance she can. Her supporting cast is outstanding, and though at the start of the season there are a few episodes that are duds, by the end both the writing and each character have hit their comic stride (and having seen the second season I will say that that continues, if anything it gets even better.)

It is a bit fast paced, which I Iike, and I love the character relationships and the complexities of Selena herself. She's really a piece of work in the most entertaining way possible and Julia Louis Dryfus (sorry cannot spell her name) deserves all the accolades she gets from this show. Gary is a riot and I love when he snaps, Amy is flawlessly portrayed and I love the way she only barely recognizes the detriment of her life being consumed by her work and makes vain and passive attempts to make it seem otherwise. She's a force to be reckoned with and I have especially loved her this current season. I like how although the characters are all comrades, there's not really any loyalty there (except Gary) as they all are playing a political game and looking out for themselves. That kind of very real dynamic is portrayed nicely here without making them seem like evil people you hate. You always understand the underhanded things they do and in that sort of a funny way this caricature of American politics almost gives you sympathy for the complexities of the chess game that it is, the constant scratching of backs and deceit.",1401062400,2,1411,4.537254901960784

5334238,4,B009GG2T3A,"Selina Meyer is the Vice-President of the United States of America, in theory one of the most powerful positions in the world. In practice, she is a spare tyre kept busy with trivial makework and assigned a staff of dysfunctional backstabbers.

Veep is an American comedy series created by Armando Iannucci, a renowned British comedian and satirist. Veep can be regarded as a companion work to Iannucci's BBC series The Thick of It, which explored the dysfunctional workings of British government via a fictitious government department and the people who run it. Like The Thick of It, Veep has no laughter track and its comedy comes from the situations the characters find themselves in, either through bad luck or through their own ill-conceived actions.

Veep is centred on the character of Selina Meyer, played with aplomb by Julia Louis-Dreyfus (best-known for her recurring role as Elaine on Seinfeld). Meyer is a former Presidential candidate whose failed to make the cut and feels she has been given a powerless role to prevent her being a threat to the President. It's also suggested that the President's wife (who, along with the President, is never seen) hates her, and several storylines revolve around Meyer inadvertently upstaging the President's wife through fashion or headline-grabbing 'cute' moves like getting a dog. Almost every episode features a moment where Meyer asks if the President has called, only to be told no.

The bulk of the comedy comes from Meyer's staff: Gary Walsh (Tony Hale), her neurotic personal aide; Amy Brookheimer (Anna Chlumsky), a well-meaning but slightly inept fixer who ends up taking the fall for some of Meyer's misjudgements; Mike McLintock (Matt Walsh), Meyer's director of communications who, bizarrely, insists that he owns a dog when in fact he does not; Dan Egan (Reid Scott), a new, ambitious and ruthless staffmember who is not quite as smart as he thinks he is; and Sue Wilson (Sufe Bradshaw), Meyer's secretary who seems to regard politics (and almost everything) with bored contempt. Completing the regular cast is Jonah Ryan (Timothy Simons), the liaison with the White House, a fantastically creepy and self-obsessed man specialising in inappropriate behaviour and inventing useless new acronyms (FDOTUS for the President's potential new dog). What makes the show work is that not all of these people are shown to be completely useless (otherwise they wouldn't be in their jobs), but that they prove unable to adapt to rapidly-developing situations. In particular, the older staff-members have no idea on how to deal with blogs and Twitter and spend vast amounts of time obsessed with style and spin rather than the substance of their policies.

Performances are uniformly excellent, with Louis-Dreyfus bringing her A-game and convincing as a politician of ambition and substance whose career has taken an abrupt left-turn into near irrelevance, resulting in frustration and annoyance. This is brilliantly show in a sequence where the President falls ill, so Meyer is called into the White House's emergency situation room, where she is almost overcome by the plush furniture, flashing lights and people treating her like she's the most important person on Earth. When the President recovers, Meyer is dumped back to her previous task, eating yogurt at a dessert store in a futile effort to show how down with the people she is. The gap between the two positions has never quite been nailed so ruthlessly as this. Special mention must also be made to Timothy Simons, who makes his character despicably punchable whenever he appears but you also want to hear what fantastically inappropriate thing he's going to say next. He's the Joffrey Baratheon of the West Wing, though fortunately without the power to execute anyone.

The season has a nicely-developed storyline about Meyer desperately trying to get some policies - any policies - through government to show she's not completely useless. An innocuous tweet about cutlery in the first episode snowballs out of control, taking with it several government bills and congressional hearings, whilst an apparent crisis in Meyer's personal life threatens to upset her career until she dumps it on one of her aides. The story, characters and dialogue are all sharp and very funny.

Compared to the genius of The Thick of It, Veep more than holds it own. Veep isn't quite as knives-out nasty as The Thick of It at its most vicious, mainly due to the lack of a character comparable to Malcolm Tucker (although foul-mouthed Congressman Roger Furlong, who appears late in the season, shows hints that he might go that way). But Iannucci's decision to make the new show stand on its own feet without resorting to his old stand-bys is both a brave one and one that works. There are a few episodes that don't quite gel together and it's arguable if some of the staffmembers would get away with what they do without being fired on the instant, but overall this is a very strong opening season.",1394668800,2,4995,5.055825242718447

5334258,5,B009GG2T3A,"I found VEEP to be a hilarious and probably true-to-life glimpse into the daily happenings of a newly elected vice president and her hard working staff. When you think of it, the vice president position is funny in that on the one hand it is a practically pointless job but on the other hand in a flash  this person could be called upon to become the next leader of the free world. What an interesting character concept to explore!

The first season only has 8 episodes but by the end of the season you have the characters figured out and you totally love Julia as the vice prez. I was afraid at first that this character was going to be somewhat of a parody of Sarah Palin, but was happy to discover that the character of Selena Meyer is her own person.  I saw in previous reviews how some commented that the swearing in this show was over the top, but I think it is warranted purely for its comedic value. I didn't find it excessive. Plus, I'm sure that in their daily lives, the people in these high stress political positions come across many situations that warrants an F-bomb or two.

Another thing I noticed about the show; the appearance of Anna Chlumsky, best known for her lead character in the movie My Girl back in the 90s. She shines in the role of Selena's Chief of Staff along with her peers, but the biggest star is certainly Julia as Selena. I'm sure that the trouble Selena gets into is based on real political fires in Washington.

We are eased into into VPMeyers world and we are laughing all the way. Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays Meyer with the exact chord of hilarity and seriousness that are unexpected. Her assistants, are there to feed her every bit of information she needs and to provide the exact shade of lipstick required. Amy, played by Anna Chlumsky, is Meyer's chief of staff, while Gary, played by Tony Hale is Meyer's personal aide. Between them, they help Meyer get through PR disasters and the scheming political animals who want to make her look stupid. Not that she needs any help.

All the while Meyer is scheming to become one of the inside group of the President. She is often not invited to even the most uninteresting of Presidential meetings, and she can never make the big time. VP Meyer is in actuality a smart cookie led astray by her urge to be President. VEEP portrays a very realistic look at the life of a VP in DC. And, t will have you in hysterics much of the time.

BUT for those of you who haven't seen it, there is a brilliantly written and acted show on the BBC that ran 4 series and a movie that created a venomously charming, violently tongued yet brilliant character called Malcolm Tucker. VEEP is the watered down USA version of this.

Veep is not nearly as ""foul mouthed"" nor mean spirited, nor witty, nor realistically acted as ""Thick of It"" yet it's still quite a good, often witty show, but one can't help but to compare the two since it's basically the same writers/producers/directors and premise.

I can't help but wonder how Americans would have responded had Julia Dreyfus spewed off such lines as ""I'm gonna f' take your bollox gonna f' rip them off and f' pin eyeballs on them and f' stitch them to a f' sock and use that as our mouthpiece"" or ""That man is a massive abortion, again not a reference to your daughter""

No dice- we apparently like our ""strong"" women be blithering nervous wrecks. I'm not sure the British Armando Ianucci should be doing a show about American politics. I'm as snooty as anyone about American politics, but I'm not doing a show about it which seems very much like a high school review. Firstly, they never explain how Selina Meyer goes from being a presidential hopeful to a loser. She spent 20 years in Washington, so where's her team of insiders? Are they trying to insinuate that she got where she is on looks alone? And if her daughter is in college, did Ms Meyer abandon her from birth? Would the public really stomach a senator who ditched her kid for Capitol Hill? (her being the key word- if Hillary Rodham had to pretend to be Hillary Clinton just so her husband could get elected, you can imagine what the public think of a working mother!) Veep is far too petty and mundane. I don't imagine Joe Biden's day is very interesting, but he wouldn't spend any time or energy retrieving a card an aide mis-signed.
EPIPHANY: I get it! Americans, do you realise the Brits are making fun of you with this show? There is no slickness, no political gaming in this show because the not-so-hidden agenda is to showcase the US as a hotbed of bumbling eejits!

Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays the out-of-the-loop VPOTUS who is trying to seem relevant and connected, and who marshals her not-inept but also not-ept staff to keep her head above water in the shark-infested waters of DC.  The characters are about as likable as most people find their actual elected officials to be, which is not at all.

Also, in a Seinfeld-ian way, there's nobody to root for, either, as none of the characters demonstrate any non-selfish motives.  However, neither are the VPOTUS and her staff malevolent, so it's easy to root for them to 'do no harm' in the best way possible.

The writing and acting are impeccable, and if you like this you may want to also try 'In the Loop', a film by the same director.  That film focuses on a mid-level UK politician who finds himself thrust upwards into global political issues without the proper preparation, capabilities, or staff.  If you're American you may want to turn up the subtitles to catch the elegant tapestry of cursing woven by key characters in the film.

Similarly, the language in Veep could also be considered harsh by those offended by vulgarity.  I wouldn't call it gratuitous, because I think it's fairly close to accurate, and if you can endure (or, like me, enjoy) the near-poetic use of vulgarity in context, then you may find yourself enjoying Veep.",1376352000,,1373,4.854077253218884

5334318,2,B009GG2T3A,"""Veep: The Complete First Season""
(HBO, 2013)

This show was both a downer and an uninvolving bore. Like ""Boss,"" this seeks to whet what the producers believe is a bottomless public desire to see politicians and politics not simply mocked, but thoroughly demolished and disrespected. On both shows, every single character is greedy and unappealing, purely venal and self-serving, which is a result -- of course!! -- of their being in politics. ""Politics = Bad"" is the main -- and apparently only -- message on both shows, it rings hollow and false.  That's even more true on ""Veep,"" because the characters are not only unlikeable, they are also universally incompetent, a bunch of easily-mocked boobs who screw up everything they lay their hands on, including the Vice President as portrayed by Julia Louis Dreyfuss.

Really?  Do we really think that any of these people could have gotten this far in politics by being complete idiots? This kind of blunt, aggressive caricature may be comforting to those of us -- and there are far too many these days -- who see politicians as the lowest of the low, a subspecies incapable of solving even the simplest problem. But it's not very realistic, even in the confines of a comedic farce, and perhaps more importantly it fails as drama, since the entire series is reduced to a one-note joke. I also disliked the overuse of profanity, not because I'm some kind of f***ing prude, but because it diminishes the story and makes the writers seem lazy, rather than clever or shocking. Do we really think that the VP would walk around press conferences and fundraisers swearing at everyone around her?  Apparently there are still a few people who think this kind of language still has some kind of shock value when seen on TV, or that it would be cathartic to see those wicked politicians portrayed as if they were 1950's longshoremen. It's not. It's repetitive and dull, and if they wanted it to be funny, they should have used it more strategically and sparingly. The writing on the show is generally very clumsy: there were some clever turns in the interpersonal relations of the various characters, but the attempts to impose an over-arching plot onto each episode were leaden and forced.

I also strongly dislike the shrill portrayal of human beings as universally stupid and self-serving, and felt the same way about other bleak, nihilistic offerings such as Don Cheadle's ""House Of Lies."" This brand of turbocharged cynicism may reflect some of what's in the popular culture today, but not everyone in America is a Tea Party member or shares their view of politicians as an evil, subhuman species worthy of tarring and feathering, if not worse.  I think most people go into politics with good intentions but find the system so debased and dominated by the uncontrolled influence of money and lobbyists that it becomes nearly impossible to make progress for the greater good. But the portrayal of our most powerful politicians as sitcom buffoons doesn't really help -- it doesn't even feel that much fun. I found this show to be too dull to watch, a ham-fisted mix of ""Seinfeld,"" ""West Wing"" and ""Gomer Pyle."" I'll stick to shows with a little more nuance and relevance, thank you.

I was so hopeful for this show but it really let me down.  I am guessing that this show was a what if Sarah Palin got elected.  And I think that is why so many people like it.  I never found her laughable and making fun of her is not funny.  There is so much that is laughable about Washington.  I hope season 2 will get it act together.

5334342,2,B009GG2T3A,"Let's just dive right in from the start shall we? VEEP is one of the most unfunny shows ever created. Yes, it really is that bad. As I watched the entire first season I think I honestly laughed perhaps once and that was just a small chuckle, not a belly laugh. Having just seen THIS IS THE END and actually finding myself laughing out loud about 15 times in the middle of a theater, this show never inspired that once while sitting in the comfort of my living room. It really is unfunny and displays in so many ways how out of touch Hollywood is with the real world.

Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, an actress who has shown time and time again that she knows how to be funny, stars as the title character, Senator Selina Meyer who has just taken on the role of Vice President. But what she thought would be a position that would provide her with some power and a direct link to the White House ends up being nothing of the sort. Selina is given little more to do than the bidding of the President, helping him to shore up votes he needs for projects while never getting credit or the chance to forward her own ideas.

Through it all she plays the political games where back stabbing is a virtue and keeping a smile plastered on your face while twisting the knife is the norm. This same theme is used quite well with Netflix series HOUSE OF CARDS but here it falls flat.

Meyers has surrounded herself with complete idiots or career builders who are more inclined to take care of themselves than her. Some have the potential to be funny characters but are never given the chance to show it. Instead they seem to think that the more they drop the F bomb the funnier they are. This made me worry about how much input Louis-Dreyfuss had in the scripts as I thought back to the time period when Saturday Night Live became a show that was unfunny...and when she was a cast member. At that time they seemed to tell jokes that they thought were funny but that no one laughed at. I found this series to be much like that.

I had heard this series was funny. I even remember several people involved being nominated for Emmys. After watching it I found my feelings about the Emmys and other awards given in Hollywood to be vindicated. Rather than honor anyone for true talent and ability it seems as though they give out awards for simply being someone they like or for trying to portray anyone they dislike in an unfavorable way. Anyone connected with this show who would win didn't deserve it and should immediately give the award back.

I was stunned to see that a second season of this series has already aired and that a third is on the way. It makes me wonder what shows that delivered pilots to HBO were turned down. Surely there was something else that deserved the funding that this show gets. The only thing this show made me want to do was turn back to television to see if a rerun of SEINFELD was on. Now that show was funny and so was Louis-Dreyfuss when she was in it. Unless the only thing you find humorous is how often and how creatively a person can swear it you won't enjoy this show.",1371600000,,3083,4.336221837088388

5334357,2,B009GG2T3A,"This is a show with a very good cast and some really weak writers; a lot of the jokes border on some old material from the Larry David show ""reworked"" for a ""political"" show.  A real shame because this show does have it's moments where it is funny.  IMHO too many ""tall"" jokes regarding ""Jonah"" but the character ""Dan Egan"" seems to have some nicely writen material playing a Machevelian staffer.

My main critical comment regards a lot of HBO content; too much profanity!  Now, I am retired from the military so ""frank language"" is still a bad habit I am trying to break.  In show business however HBO makes a critical mistake with hit shows not looking four or five seasons down the road.  Example, the ""Soprano's"" and ""Deadwood"" were just great shows and people who didn't care for the language could vote with the remote.  However, the ""Boston"" version of the Soprano's is a little silly with all the ""freaking"" and other sorry measures made to clean it up enough for cable.  As to Deadwood, if a ""Boston"" version was ever cut for syndication the show would go from an hour to maybe a three minute show the profanity was so bad.  For those of you who are younger, the ""Boston"" version was a term that came from burlesque meaning that while in Boston you had to clean up the act to prevent a raid.

Returning to HBO, they would do well to bring in some writers who don't have to go for the crouch to get laughs.  This could be a very funny show.  They need to clean up the language.  I am a big fan of the A&E franchise ""Breaking Bad""; this is a show about drug traficing, killing and manufacturing meth and with the brilliant writers Vince Gilligan, Executive Producer brings to the script they won't have to produce a ""Boston"" version.  With the dark subject matter coupled with the gallows humor this show exhibits they won't have to clean it up for cable.

The writing is superb and the performances by every actor are top notch; they each have their own little quirks that separate them, yet they are so real and relatable.

All the one star reviews here seem to revolve around the use of the ""f-word"" on the show, well to that I say ""seriously?""

I had wasted my money and brought garbage into my home.  I skipped forward and found more of the same.  It didn't get any better.  It's their spin on politics.  Nothing but pacing around offices, walking up and down hallways, and endless talk, talk, talk, talk.  Nothing meaningful or important, and absolutely nothing funny.  Just a lot of childish insecurity, finger-pointing, mud-flinging, back-stabbing, insults, anger, rudeness, fear, and blame.  I don't consider that entertainment.  It's old, it's over, and it's boring.  I can turn on any so-called news channel and hear the same thing 24/7 minus the profanity.  Don't waste your time or money.",1365638400,7,808,4.896296296296296

Really really awful. In the last episode I tried to watch, one character referred to another as 'bleached anal hair' which, let's be honest, could have been funny but just wasn't.

I'm not against the profane - honestly, I quite adore it, but this was profane instead of anything else.  Just dumb and gross and silly.",1365465600,8,755,4.449275362318841

5334390,2,B009GG2T3A,"Veep is definitely the best Louis-Dreyfus vehicle since Seinfeld, but that's not saying much.

She is perfectly cast as VP Selina Meyer, as is everybody else in the talented ensemble cast. The problem is the writing. Each episode crams two or three political (or occasionally personal) catastrophes into the less-than-30-minute slot, so there's practically non-stop angst and frenzy as they try to put out the fires. It gets tiring fast.

The catastrophes blow by so quickly that they are practically indistinguishable from one another, and every one gets resolved in some random way that never makes any more sense than the problem did. It's like slapstick without pratfalls and pies in the face. It's just frantic, meaningless running around, packed with non-stop texting and snide put-downs flying in every direction, but it's never funny at all.

Whatever entertainment value Veep has lies only in seeing gifted actors working well together at the speed of lightning; but the awful material they have to work with, and the frantic pace required to fit all that awful material into a half-hour show, make it hard - maybe impossible - to stay with for more than a few seemingly identical episodes.

I guess what I'm saying is that Veep (unlike Seinfeld) is just another frantic, mindless, infinitely repeating formulaic sitcom in the I Love Lucy line, but with snarky wisecracks instead of pies. It's disappointing that that tired formula still thrives in this century.

I'm surprised Veep was renewed for a second season, but I guess I shouldn't be. Maybe they'll hold on long enough to find better writers.",1364256000,12,1610,5.060377358490566

Veep and The Comeback have a lot in common: treasured NBC sitcom actress playing someone with no self awareness, uncomfortable situations involving body fluids, and ease at mixing small laughs with big LOLs.

Veep has a faster pace, which is fitting given that it's about politics. They are dealing with situations non-stop, and the rapid-fire dialogue is fun and frenetic. Julie Louis-Dreyfus is stellar at both the over-the-top explosions and the few quieter moments interspersed between. While there are plenty of uncomfortable situations, they're less cringe-worthy than many in The Comeback, mainly because of the Veep's staff racing around like maniacs to correct the problems and support her, while Valerie Cherish was often left in the open, with a spotlight on her, humiliated.

The supporting cast in Veep is all phenomenal, especially Anna Chlumsky (welcome back,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Girl/dp/B000I9YUZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Girl</a>!) playing the thankless role of the Vice President's chief-of-staff, a real-life thankless role.

Almost every episode involves a total disaster plaguing the vice president, as her staff races to get things back on track with the public (The president himself? Never seen, and never cares. Every episode, ""Did the president call, Sue?"" ""No."")

The constant screw ups make it seem like Selina and her staff are incompetent twits. It's easy to compare Selina to that other female almost-VP Sarah Palin, and write her off as a total twit, but Selina and her staff are not stupid. They're smart people who are totally unprepared for the situation they're in. Being Veep is a whole different game than they're used to. And yes, politics is all just a game. It doesn't help that Selina has surrounded herself with yes-men for twenty years in politics and has absolutely no introspection whatsoever.

The true brilliance of Veep is that it manages to do what it does without using either the term ""Democrat"" or ""Republican."" As I said, politics is a game, and Veep shows us that *all* politicians, whether left or right, are playing for one team: their own. And we're the losers.",1358208000,3,2451,5.701369863013698
5334395,4,B009GG2T3A,"The creator of the UK's THE THICK OF IT also created this show. So he had to take a dry British wit yet wacky show idea and come up with a way to convert it to American politics. This is mostly successful but I suspect the second season will be the one which is the critical test because this season steadily improved as they warmed up.

In the UK show everyone is inept, except for Malcolm, the power behind the PM, and almost everyone is not likable. Taking unlikable characters and making them funny is very difficult but the UK show succeeds.  In the USA the most successful comedy shows featuring unlikable characters were SEINFELD and CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, by the co-creator of SEINFELD, Larry David.  So it should come as no surprise that the creator picked Julia Louise-Dreyfus, who played the unlikable Elaine in SEINFELD, to play the veep. If you compare the Veep to Malcolm in the UK show though, there is no comparison.  The veep is likable in comparison.

Dreyfus is supported by a very able cast but this show will rise or fall based on her execution of a Veep who would like to be President and we can only hope she doesn't succeed!  I will be tuning in for season two.  I frankly think she can pull it off in the second season and I am looking forward to her totally unleashing her comedic power in it.
