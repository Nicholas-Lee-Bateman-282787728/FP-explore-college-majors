2875425,4,B000RTOLGI,"For those of you who have bought the debut album, this is a great extra! Videos / Acoustic Performances / Live Performances..  its got some good stuff. For those of you who have been holding back for some reason & haven't bought this album already, I'd suggest to buy the 3DG Special Edition (CD+DVD) release, which includes this DVD. Nothing out of the ordinary..  the usual stuff that most bands are doing nowdays..  release an album accompanied with a bonus dvd, Some videos thrown in, with live performances, interviews.. bonus tracks! Money Making schemes basically.. Though I'd like to add, It's bands like 3DG that are actually worth paying the amount for!",1224892800,2,663,4.901785714285714

8202508,1,B000RTOLGI,This dvd only has a couple videos. i suppose that's why it was so cheap. The description isn't enough. Don't bother getting this.,1359590400,3,129,4.6521739130434785
8202509,5,B000RTOLGI,"Was watching each video individually on YouTube and finally bought this DVD.  Great performance, great sound, great picture.  I wish they had more concerts on DVD.  I'd buy them all.",1357603200,,182,5.0
8202510,5,B000RTOLGI,This is such a fun video. We crank up the sound and really get into the concert. This really is Three Days Grace at their best and most personable.,1349827200,,147,4.103448275862069
8202511,1,B000RTOLGI,"The sound mix on this Blue Ray was the poorest of the BR concerts I own. Very muddy with poor dynamic range and almost unitelligible vocals. OK for a party background but not for critical listening. Very disappointed. After demoing to a friend I had to get out the CD so he hear what ""Just Like You"" really sounded like.",1327363200,,320,4.35
8202512,5,B000RTOLGI,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD!  I've only seen them in concert once and I came across this DVD and have watched it several times.  Any Three Days Grace fan will truly appreciate this show.  I have been to too many concerts to count & they are in the top of any of the bands i've seen live.  Adam is one hell of a front man and the music is just amazing!  I know from some of the previous reviews that some people didn't really like the interview stuff in between the songs, but in my opinion, it made it even better.  It makes you feel like you are getting to know the band as people and not just as someone to listen or watch make music.  BUY THIS!  LOL...if you love 3DG, you won't regret buying this DVD!",1309478400,,704,4.050724637681159
8202513,5,B000RTOLGI,"if you've seen ""three days grace"" in person you probably don't need to read any reviews to know they are a solid band; at least that has been my experience both times they performed near my home town.. they kicked ass to put it bluntly! musically they are SOLID and their stage presents is what it should be; nothing more. WHEN I BOUGHT THIS ITEM i had expectations, and they were met. they could have made a great digitized concert even better if they had placed the tidbits of behind the scenes footage in a ""bonus features"" section in stead of in between practically every song.. But for any THREE DAYS GRACE fan, this is a must have concert. and if you've never had the chance to see them live, this is i suppose, the next best thing.",1298592000,,738,4.355072463768116
8202514,5,B000RTOLGI,"This Blu is amazing, throughout the concert the PQ is quite good, giving 4/5, SQ is sweet, 5/5. The only thing that may affect enjoyability is the documentary bits between every song, wich by the way, have low quality video reference. If you love Three Days, then there's nothing to worry as they don't let down fans. So enjoy this like me, I'm in Puerto Rico so I haven't seen them live, so this is the next big thing for me. 5 STRS",1253750400,6,433,4.228915662650603
