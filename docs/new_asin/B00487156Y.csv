4285753,5,B00487156Y,"Detective Superintendent Sandra Pullman heads UCOS, solving previously unsolved crimes from the past. Her team consists of three ex-policemen who for various reasons all opted for early retirement.

If you enjoy ""Midsommer Murders"", ""Pie in the Sky"", ""Foyle's War"", or ""A Touch of Frost"", you'll enjoy these clever mysteries with a minimum of violence, almost no gore and no sex scenes. The rapport between the characters is exceptional and their ages allow them to bring a fresh perspective to their work.

In the sixth series, the ""New Tricks"" team members continue to bend the rules, use their own methods and test Strickland's patience to the limits. This time out, the detectives continue to face their demons in both their private and professional lives. More than ever, they pull together and support one another.

Series 6 consists of 8 episodes on 3 disks. This series is currently not available in the U. S. in a Region 1 NTSC version. These are REGION 2 PAL DISKS. PLEASE BE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE A REGION 2 OR REGION-FREE DVD PLAYER CAPABLE OF CONVERTING PAL SIGNAL TO NTSC.",1288224000,40,1086,4.891304347826087

A funny, detective mystery (British), with 3 retired detectives returning to the unsolved crime unit where the work for/with a younger female boss and her superior (somewhat absent in most of the stories). The cast is fantastic, and the stories are most interesting. Of the many British Mysteries shown on Masterpiece Theater, only Foyles War and New Tricks consistently get 4-5 Stars... which speaks for itself in recommending this series",1387152000,,646,5.09433962264151

4285818,5,B00487156Y,We absolutely enjoy this series. There is very little in the line of gruesome scenes which seems to be in vogue these days. Subtitles are great for our aging ears.,1372723200,,163,4.466666666666667

So with Five ""New Tricks"" Series under my belt you can understand my disappointment . I guess three I wasn't  smart enough to contact the seller correctly, haven't heard from them. One disk I could understand, but two disks! I would like a refund or a watchable disk two and disk three.",1367539200,,426,4.532467532467533

The actors on this show (and many other British TV shows) have such depth due compared to younger actors/actresses.  Bravo to British TV!  Of course, I watch younger actors and enjoy them also, but they should not have dibs on all the best parts.  Writers should be thinking older characters as well.

You have to be paying attention to catch all the puns and funny lines, all the while following the story line.  There is not another show on television that I can watch several times wthout getting bored!

I just can't recommend this enough - best of all, in the U.S. it is shown on Public Television, which cuts out the lengthy commercials, a boon to be sure.  Acting and directing are superb.  Watch one episode, and see how you feel about it!",1332201600,,619,4.6422018348623855

New Tricks has a habit of leaving some plot lines hanging, others purposely unresolved or with the ""wrong"" outcome.  This reflects the reality of police work.  But in season 6 one huge injustice is resolved beautifully by the team augmented by some unexpected assistance.  This is one of the best series to come out of the UK and we're so happy to have discovered it.",1331596800,,510,4.685393258426966

4285848,5,B00487156Y,"Once again, Season six (6) of ""New tricks"" entertained me greatly.  On three (3) discs, I was entertained for hours by this superbly written, directed and acted series.

 Once again Sandra Pullman (brilliantly acted by Amanda Redman) is a ""short-fused"" and at times hysterically funny boss of three (3) retired but very good detectives that solve some horrendous ""cold cases"".  The three (3) retired detectives are not the easiest bunch to work with being not so politically correct, having personal problems (I.e., alcoholism, many wives, deep sense of loss at the death of a loved one trying to communicate with the departed, etc) and a refusal to embrace new technology sticking with old methods (their way) to solve the ""cold cases"".  (Although, in Season Six, two of the geezers are relying a great deal more on computers).  That said, this ""cold case"" team in Season six (6) solve some wonderful and highly mysterious ""cold cases"" most brilliantly.

I am a severe fan of ""New Tricks"" and after viewing Season six (6), I look forward to future seasons.",1330214400,,1057,4.937853107344632

4285850,5,B00487156Y,"After Six Seasons - and still going - this team of British Detectives still keep me in stitches.  The BEST and SMARTEST Television detective show ever!

If you've clicked on this review knowing that it is the SIXTH season for this absolutely fabulous BBC detective series, then you have probably watched the previous five seasons. If not, I recommend that you go back and find Season One and start from the beginning. There are two reasons for this: 1) Though each 55-minute episode (unlike the US, the BBC is non-commercial and does not insert commercials in its shows) contains a different crime to be solved, the four main characters' lives evolve over the run of the show. And 2) You'll be missing some great acting in the earlier episodes.

As I said in my reviews of previous season's DVDs, ""This may be the best TV series ever - in my opinion."" Thanks to Acorn Media in the US, this volume (Season Six) is available in the US as NTSC format, these were the episodes aired in the UK in 2009 but they don't seem dated at all.

These episodes are like potato chips, you can't stop devouring them once you have started. (But these shows are healthier for you than those chips - or ""crisps"" if you are in the UK).

The last moments of the last show in Season Five did not provide the  ""cliff hanger"" in that ended Season Four but the series still carries through with certain plot  threads. Though the guy who killed Jack's wife was revealed and captured in the previous Season he returns in the plot. So does Jerry's daughter - played by actor Dennis Waterman's real life daughter.

One of the episodes this season takes place at the studio where the James Bond films are made and film buffs will get a kick out of that one.

I will not go into the plots of the episodes - they are detailed elsewhere, though I highly recommend that you don't read them in advance. Even when watching I skip the ""plot outline"" shown at the beginning. It's more fun to ""let it happen"".

While a few of the plots in this volume get a bit too confusing - I find it makes me play them again to see how the crime - usually a murder - took place. But these crimes are only there for the four lead actors to use their own unique personalities and expertise to work together. If there is an underlying theme here it is ""teamwork works!:.

Like the end of Season Dive , this volume ends with a fairly emotional episode that will stick with you for days after watching it.. Whenever I finish a Season of this show I go through ""New Tricks"" withdrawal, knowing that it will be another six months before the next season appears on DVD. But since the show is already into Series Eight on British TV, Acorn should be releasing Series Seven in Fall 2012 soon. (I'll try to post a note when I know the date.)

UNLIKE the first four seasons, there is a ""bonus feature"" this time. (There was one on Season Five also ). This time it's a 19-minute ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette about the ""sound crew"" and the music used in the film. The show's composer - assisted by his son for some of the music - was a member of The Shadows, Brit-rocker Cliff Richard's backing band and worked with film composer John Barry!

So keep on buying this series so that Acorn will keep releasing them. And ""Thank you Acorn"" for giving us in the US a chance to see one of the best shows on TV.

4285851,5,B00487156Y,"My husband and I are both great fans of British mysteries and drama, in general; however, New Tricks is, as the name implies, a new take on an old, established formula.  We find it completely engaging. The premise is based on the strong female lead of Detective Superintendent Sandra Pullman, played with depth, subtlety, and humor by Amanda Redman. She's gotten herself into a lot of trouble with her bosses after her gung-ho attitude turned a sensitive operation into a big embarrassment for the Met. As a result, Pullman is reassigned to head up a new cold cases unit.  No doubt her superiors regard this not only as a humbling punishment for the headstrong Pullman, but also as a way to sideline her until she fades into obscurity.  Cost cutting considerations also rear their head and Pullman is told she may staff her new unit only with retired cops -- it's much cheaper for the Met.  After a dispiriting series of interviews, she finally pulls together her new team of old duffers -- and they are a marvelous, quirky, irascible, lovable bunch of characters. James Bolam, Dennis Waterman, and Alun Armstrong -- wonderful, veteran actors all -- portray their characters with superb ability  Over the course of the series, these often cantankerous personalities (and that includes the younger Pullman) forge not only an effective and successful team, but a caring bond of professional camaraderie and deep, personal friendship.  They come to each other's aid as each suffers set-backs, illnesses, and crises in their private lives -- all of them have been wounded, either physically or mentally -- as a result of their jobs.  Ironically, it's their return to the job that helps to save them all. Precisely because of their flaws and their sometimes awkward ways of dealing with each other, these characters resonate humanity, courage, and credibility.  Lest this sound like a grim viewing experience, I can assure you, it is not -- there is a great deal of gentle humor in each episode.  I realize I haven't actually touched upon the mystery element of this show. Of course, there are a series of cold cases that the team must tackle and, by using their more ""old fashioned,"" traditional policing methods, the team manages to rack up an impressive success rate.  These cases often involve timely issues, are well-plotted, and keep the viewer guessing until the end.  This series has it all -- it is a complete recipe for viewing enjoyment.  Highly recommended.",1326240000,,2464,4.92512077294686
4285852,5,B00487156Y,"One-liners and humorous expressions roll faster than finding clues in this fast-paced but retirement age police team.

DAC Strickland (Anthony Calf-`Upstairs Downstairs') is their often antagonistic boss. And we must mention Brian's wife Esther (Susan Jameson-`The Queen' and voice for Catherine Cookson audios). Expect first name familiarity in New Tricks, like in a family series. They are a cop family. Episodes always have a difficult past crime, plus personal issues of the UCOS team. You will laugh through the sleuthing efforts.

Bonus is a 19 min Behind the Scenes, an awesome sound documentary-effects, music, dialogue; and the bonus has subtitles too.
