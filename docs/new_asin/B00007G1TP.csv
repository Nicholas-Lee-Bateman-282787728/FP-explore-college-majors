8190832,3,B00007G1TP,"Anime from what I call the ""Harlock Universe"" (the old New World release of ""Galaxy Express"") was among the first of that genre that impressed me about anime VS. what we had seen over here, generally aimed at kids. I had bought volumes 1 & 2 of ""Cosmo Warrior Zero"" from Best Buy new and then volume 4 off through Amazon, also new. However, since I've never seen volume 3 at a price that is reasonable, I've never been able to watch the fourth volume and I'd please like to know why this situation exists as I've come to think I wouldn't mind owning most, if not all, of the Captain Harlock related titles. If Amazon really cares about these things, I wish they would note such things before asking me to do a review on this. Thanks for nothing! (Oh, the star rating is not relevant here until I can watch the whole series.)",1432684800,,824,4.32258064516129

8190834,4,B00007G1TP,"A very good series with some serious flaws. A shame that there appears to be episodes missing/deleted when converted for the American audience. (Love to see the original Japanese version, though). The last two episodes on this volume appear to be mis-placed add ons from the same series. A major break for the storyline and left the viewer wondering ""where's the rest"" of the episodes.",1272326400,,385,4.938461538461539
