8184947,5,B000OHZKIQ,"I watched a preview of this DVD in a Mexican TV Channel and I was not dissapointed. Considering that this is a compilation of different appearances of Jose Jose on TV shows through over 3 decades or so with other important spanish singers, it has a great historical value. Do not expect a high definition DVD. But if you are a real Jose Jose fan, you should buy it.",1239062400,7,365,4.304347826086956
8184948,5,B000OHZKIQ,"I love the music of Vicente Fernandez, so I bought this DVD. The day we received this DVD at home, my parents watched it for hours repeating song after song at least twice, particularly ""Perdon"", a duet with his son, Alejandro Fernandez. Great purchase. Highly recommended!",1214006400,2,273,4.956521739130435
8184949,5,B000OHZKIQ,"Vicente Fernandez is in fine form in this DVD, in performances ranging from 1989 to 2005. 5 songs are included, 2 of them live performances from 2005 with singing idol and son Alejandro (tracks 1 and 5). They sing ""Perdon,"" a glorious song written by Pedro Flores, Chente in an orange charro outfit and Alejandro in his black leather, in a huge arena full of cheering fans. The final track is ""Amor de los Dos"" (which was the first hit recording father and son made together in 1989); both songs have been staples in their concerts together. Track 2 is with Aida Cuevas from 1990, set in a lovely Mexican courtyard and chapel, and they sing the Gonzalo Roig classic, ""Quiereme Mucho."" Track 3 is a marvelous surprise from 2003, and is a delight, with clever animation of Chente, Vicente hijo, and Alejandro, on horseback, singing ""Al Mayor de los Fernandez."" Track 4 is very special, with lots of beautiful horses, and the great Brazilian singer/songwriter Roberto Carlos joining Chente in ""Aunque Mal Paguen Ellas"" from 1989. The running time for all 5 tracks is just over 20 minutes. Short but nice, fans of the legendary Vicente Fernandez will love this DVD.

Extras include 10 minutes of commentary from Chente, who speaks of the many people he has recorded with in the past, such as Jose Alfredo Jimenez and Javier Solis, and quick clips of Aida Cuevas, Angelica Maria, Yuri, and Vicente hijo. There is also a Chente ""Galeria"" while ""Mentira, Mentira"" is playing, which is the song he recorded with Solis, and which is available in the CD version of ""Mis Duetos,"" along with the songs with Jimenez, Celia Cruz, and many more.
DVD Track list:
1: ""Perdon"" (2005) with son Alejandro
2: ""Quiereme Mucho"" (1990) with Aida Cuevas
3: ""Al Mayor de los Fernandez"" (2003) with sons Vicente hijo and Alejandro
4: ""Aunque Mal Paguen Ellas"" (1989) with Roberto Carlos

8184950,1,B000OHZKIQ,"I am a big fan of Jose Jose and for many years I have been following his career.

This is not only a big disappointment; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose's fans.

First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's

Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.

It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).

The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source.

Don't buy or rent this DVD",1182470400,10,624,4.158333333333333
