8020950,5,B00022YZWK,This is one of my fave films of all time. It's seriously funny you guys. I bought this based on a recommendation from my cousin Peter. Peter may be functionally retarded but the goofy bastard sure knows his indie--fish-out-of-water--gay--comedies.,1120608000,4,247,5.358974358974359
8020951,1,B00022YZWK,"This movie only gets 1 star from me, and this is for the courage it must of taken the cast & crew to show their faces after it was made. Those of you who are big fans of camp films may like this movie since you will enjoy almost anything. In my opinion, it isn't even that acceptable.  Bad acting, bad script, and bad production values all combine to make this a true waste of time. Buy this movie if you happen to see it in the $5.00 bin at your video store, plug it in, turn off the sound and pause it on any scene which shows the incredibly cute Stuart Perelmuter shirtless. Beyond that, don't bother.",1110412800,2,604,4.11864406779661
8020952,4,B00022YZWK,"This is one of those gay indie films that is nothing but fun. It's got drama, drag queens, cuties and camp.  What more could you ask for!",1097798400,4,137,4.074074074074074
8020953,1,B00022YZWK,"This movie is painfully bad.  Unfortunately it isn't really bad enough to be fun, not like an early John Waters movie where the script is so outrageous and the acting so wooden that you can enjoy the film for its camp value.  No, here we have a film that is obviously trying to be so-bad-it's-good and failing.  The actors do seem capable of turning in truly wretched performances, so they might have been fun to watch had the script had any redeeming qualities.  Unfortunately the dialog is just boring and the story stupid.  The concept itself could lend itself to a good, silly movie (straight actor tries to fit into gay theater world), but this movie disappoints on all levels.  Honestly I had to turn it off after about 40 minutes (halfway through it) because I just couldn't stand any more of it!",1093478400,2,803,4.580419580419581
