It was fantastic. Shed some much needed light on the devistation of the rain forest. I preordered mine already....",1207785600,,288,4.666666666666667
2474495,5,B000CSUNL6,"I saw Return To The Amazon, by Jean-Michel Cousteau on PBS. I was trilled with the educational value it offered. We truly are all interwoven on this planet we call home. I will share the DVD with my granddaughters who have traveled to the area with their parents and will go again soon as missionaries. I hope this program will inspire them to get involved with the environmental issues the program addressed.
I highly recommend this DVD as an educational tool for children as well as adults. see also,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-The-Complete-BBC-Series/dp/B000MR9D5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-The-Blue-Planet-Seas-of-Life-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000TEUSQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth & The Blue Planet Seas of Life (Special Collector's Edition)</a>",1207267200,2,950,7.491071428571429

8102272,4,B000CSUNL6,"Explores how the Amazon region effects climate for the whole planet and how we, as consumers, can vote with our spending dollars to do our parts towards a sustainable Amazon and a sustainable planet. The importance of Indigenous rights in this effort is highlighted. The philosophy of managing ecosystems under sound business models where one does not extract the capital but rather lives on the interest is encouraged.

I liked the video very much and think it is well worth watching.  However, I find its lack of in depth focus just a tiny bit distracting. However, it gives much food for thought and ground for future focused reading to uncover more about the ideas presented.

A preview is available here:

8102278,5,B000CSUNL6,"The shark is a predator when hungry, or invoked.  We tend to think of them as maneaters.  This video shows the value of sharks to mankind and the world.  Robbing them of their freedom to live by killing them, or using their fins for food is hurting the whole sea.  The shark could  come to be extinct or mess up our entire ecosystem.  All animals are needed to balance the earth and the oceans. Video was very educational for me, and showed me the need for the shark on our planet. A very good buy on my part, hope others see it to!!!

8102279,5,B000CSUNL6,"25 years ago, Jacques Cousteau and his son Jean-Michel went on a major one year expedition on the Amazon, with Captain Cousteau visiting the lower Amazon aboard Calypso and Jean-Michel starting by foot in the Andes, at the source of the river, and then visiting the upper part of the river aboard Alcyone, the wind-powered ship. The result was a series of films that opened people's eyes. At the time, the condition of the Amazon was bad. Now, it's even worse!
Watching the original movies (available on another DVD release) and then this DVD, we really get to see what has happened since the 80s and what has to be done down there to protect our planet. But we also get to see the efforts already in place and visit gorgeous wild protected areas. Truly amazing places!
As for the previous DVDs, the quality of this documentary is excellent. Visually, it's filmed and edited in a dynamic way. Never gets boring. As for the content, it's rich! I'm so glad to see Jean-Michel Cousteau making films again. It was about time (hadn't seen him since 1997 - his father's death)! People need to be informed about the condition of our planet now more than ever. We have to do something!
Jean-Michel Cousteau's work is great and I hope to see more and more of these films!",1219104000,5,1262,4.588495575221239

The quality of this documentary is excellent. Visually, it's filmed and edited in a dynamic way. Never gets boring. As for the content, it's rich. We get to visit all these GORGEOUS atolls and meet interesting people working to preserve them! Really nice! So far, it's my favorite ""Ocean Adventure"". It's just a wonderful journey. Oh, and the narration is by Pierce Brosnan, which is nice.
Anyway, great DVD! Jean-Michel Cousteau's work is great and I hope to see more and more of these films!",1219104000,5,678,4.705882352941177
