8054820,5,B0007ZEOXM,"May I impart, may I share, may I exist, may I advise, and may I make good changes to make your life better! Permission, suggestions, all together for better alignment and proper discipline! Innocence of friendship at their best!!",1441411200,,229,4.897435897435898
8054821,5,B0007ZEOXM,A classic Gabrielle Anwar MOVIE!,1405123200,,32,5.6
8054822,5,B0007ZEOXM,"This is a great movie about 4 adult males who are friends.  They do everything together, including fall in love with the same woman (Gabrielle Anwar).  The movie is an easy going fun romp through human behavior; lighthearted and fun.  If you're looking for blood, guns, and the four letter word, don't go here.",1399420800,,310,4.703703703703703
8054823,5,B0007ZEOXM,For anyone willing to give this film a chance it can be lots of fun to follow till the suprising end. It is a sleeper and I enjoyed it. I searched it out to see Patty Duke in a great cameo. Highly reccommended.,1335830400,,210,3.9069767441860463
8054824,2,B0007ZEOXM,"3 or 4 college buds all court the same row captain and then she becomes pregnant///focuses all around the bar and their goofiness...when word comes out she has a kid, they all rush, not knowing who is the dad and they all step up - but it is pretty playful and not realistic.",1322697600,,275,4.2075471698113205
8054825,4,B0007ZEOXM,"I thought this movie was super cute. Some of the plot points were a little fuzzy, but as far as romantic comedies go, it was fun. Gabrielle Anwar is great, and Sean Astin was pretty fun. I didn't realize that one of the guys is Smith from Sex and the City, so that made it even better! ;)",1314662400,,288,3.9827586206896552
8054826,4,B0007ZEOXM,"I half-expected something sleazy (4 guys and one girl?), but it was rather tactfully done given the premisses.
As for the script quality, there were some lame moments but for the most part we have laughed.
We are almost fifty, the film is about young people, and we still found it amusing. A little bit of slapstick, a little bit of cute moments, resulted in an entertaining 90 minutes.",1236988800,,386,4.608695652173913
8054827,5,B0007ZEOXM,Good movie fun and entertaining.  Lots of fun if your into the simple comedy.,1236211200,,77,4.5
8054828,1,B0007ZEOXM,"Well, this is probably the worst movie I've seen; bad acting, writing, and special effects. However, being that I do competitively row, I found it incredibly amusing. I don't think anyone who has not done crew will appreciate this movie. It's awful, but if you row, it's awfully funny.",1180915200,6,285,4.836734693877551
8054829,1,B0007ZEOXM,"Gabrielle Anwar's uneven (and thus fake sounding) English accent fades in and out during this inane movie with a flimsy premise - four rowing buddies decide to share responsibility for the child carried by a woman they all lust for but promised never to pursue (and some don't remember sleeping with). This cheesy movie appears to be a really bad made-for-cable TV movie that miraculously has everyone getting their happy little ending.

More miraculous is that it was made in the first place or that any of the actors are entertaining additional acting offers.",1180569600,5,561,4.968085106382978
