3798392,2,B001UHN8AQ,Great characters but its meh with some episode. The Theme music sucks.....,1511740800,,74,5.25
3798393,2,B001UHN8AQ,"This is by far Mike Judge's worst animated show. The story lines are very predictable and the plots feel very hollow. I feel the fact that this series was produced for ABC did not help. I feel the character development is very poor if not lacking completely the characters seem very flat compared to king of the hill. And wtf does the wife do all day they never explain her role, what is her profession is if she is a stay at home mom or a failed artist or what. all and all this crap was made and brought into the world for one season the show no one asked for Van Driessen from Beavis and Butthead not being injured",1511740800,,617,4.15
3798394,5,B001UHN8AQ,"Per their official facebook page ( [...] ), the dvd release date will be 8 jan 2013! there will apparently be a few extras, but it'll be good just to have this set out.

perhaps 'king of the hill' season 7 and beyond will be next?!",1347321600,,231,4.021739130434782
3798395,5,B001UHN8AQ,"My wife and I really enjoyed this show and of course, they took it off the air.  Not really being advertised, it aired on Comedy Central to see if it would catch on and we missed it.  This show was just ahead of its time and I'm disappointed they didn't give it a bit longer chance to run.  I really believe more people would have enjoyed this show had they kept going.

Given the hit series King of The Hill has halted to release its remaining seasons, I certainly hope they will be releasing The Goode Family soon to DVD.",1276732800,5,523,4.2
3798396,5,B001UHN8AQ,"This show is too Goode for TV, so they won't run it anymore.  Typical.

In the episode Goodes Gone Wild, Helen flashes back to her father, Charlie, ridiculing her nave notions throughout her childhood...  Everything is dolphins & doilies, rainbows & leprechauns, polka dots & unicorns in her world.  Charlie (and most of their neighbors) knows Gerald & Helen are living in a world of extreme self-delusion.

The delusions are not the product of ""good intentions.""  Rather they are based on a desire for power, control and status.  They are motivated by political self interest which is no better than economic self interest and more often than not dangerous and damaging as the show sometimes portrays.

To even think their mistaken ways are well intentioned belies a sense of self-righteousness that leads to the promoting of a corrupt world view and political system the left represents.  When has the political left produced anything but misery, pain, enslavement and murder?  The answer is not very often!

Anyway, the show is generally quite well done, hopefully it will be available on DVD soon.",1268611200,6,1101,5.027624309392265
3798397,5,B001UHN8AQ,"Still grieving over the cancellation of King of the Hill, I was eager to catch Mike Judge's latest offering.

This time, he satires myself and other 'left-wingers'. In our rush to be socially conscious, we're accidentally--but good-intentionally--tripping over ourselves. Delivering such sophisticated critiques in a 'cartoon' format are why his work continues standing out and above competitors.

A standout episode was ""Pilot"". Wanting to 'be open' with her daughter Bliss, Helen's detailed 's ""the sex"" talk ironically then sends her running into the arms of an abstinence group merely in protest. Laughing along with the storyline, I know that ALL teens are uncomfortable taking with their parents about sex. And the series spoofs how I and my peers could accidentally end up raising our own kids down the road.

They are genuinely nice people, but the Goode's kindness gets exploited in 'Freeganomics' when in an effort to be the 'Greenest' people around, the Goodes must realize their environmental guru is nothing more than a bum who has very cleverly learned to work people for his life on the streets. He can preach about recycling and sustainability all day because he does not actually have to think about how to effectively or properly support himself. Unlike the Goodes and other real-life progressives, he exploits concern about recycling to merely lay about in his own compost mooching off of people with good intentions!

""A Tale of Two Lesbians"" had touched on the naivety earlier. Wanting to prove that they 'weren't homophobic' Helen and Gerald set out to befriend a lesbian couple. When Gerald accidentally makes an anti-gay slur, the Goodes, then desperately scramble to prove that they (of all people) are not homophobic. Their adventure takes them from upscale lesbian chic to butch couples--where they discover a WIDE spectrum of human sexuality exists.

I had heard something about this series in the 'previews' then stumbled upon it by accident. I sure hope that ABC does more to visibly and publically promote it. I was genuinely feeling great at the end of having watched 'Goode'!",1246060800,12,2108,5.152046783625731
8343688,5,B001UHN8AQ,This show is an accurate representation of the typical Santa Barbara family.,1528329600,,76,5.416666666666667
8343689,1,B001UHN8AQ,"boring unfunny and lame, plots are about a family of hippies trying to live a normal life and their adventure in it. am sure their a niche that will love the show but stay away unless you enjoy a very narrow  or extreme wide variety of shows as it a time wasters and not much else.",1524614400,,281,4.017857142857143

8343695,2,B001UHN8AQ,This was almost physically painful to sit through. Who are they trying to appeal too? There was genuinely nothing funny about this show.,1517356800,,136,4.956521739130435
8343696,5,B001UHN8AQ,Great show....  I feel this show was just ahead of it time...,1515542400,2,61,4.083333333333333
8343697,3,B001UHN8AQ,The loss of continuity by episode three foreshadows its demise. Some smart bits here and there make it worth watching though.,1512864000,,125,5.0
