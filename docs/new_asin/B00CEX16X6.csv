8581109,5,B00CEX16X6,A very atmospheric film of the most atmospheric composer's career.,1421193600,,66,5.7
8581110,2,B00CEX16X6,"Tony Palmer has made a number of wonderful films on Britten; this is not one of them.  I was really shocked at how much of the film is just a repackaging of material from his previous films.  Of the new material some of it is great.  The interviews with Sue Phipps, Pears' niece for example are wonderful.  Lots of the rest is padding and awful.  Among the worst is what seems like an interminable section where Palmer has assembled videos of the most horrendous scenes of human suffering, persons writhing in pain with gaping bleeding wounds, etc. all accompanied by Britten's music.  It is unwatchable regardless of the point he's trying to make.  Other padding includes absolutely platitudinous and off topic comments from the director Peter Sellars about spending on education, banal analytical comments about Britten's music (maybe a non musician might find those interesting) by some nobody sitting at a piano and even a segment of a speech Tony Blair gave to parliament before the Iraq War.  If you don't own the other Britten/Palmer films (A Time there Was, etc.) get them.  I really think this film may have been a rush job to meet the centenary deadline.",1379462400,14,1164,4.809045226130653
