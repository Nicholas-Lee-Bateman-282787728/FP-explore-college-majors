8573638,5,B0012OTVBM,I enjoyed watching this horror film. Ruffus and cast did a great job for a low budget film.,1212796800,,91,4.111111111111111
8573639,5,B0012OTVBM,This film is destined to be a cult classic.  The opening credits set the scene of this satirical look into the horror genre.  Chaffee cleverly poked fun at horror movies without ever coming close to slapstick.  The script was both witty and intelligent; the acting was top notch; and the production quality is superior.  I strongly recommend this movie to any fan of horror flicks.,1209254400,,381,4.815384615384615
8573640,5,B0012OTVBM,"This movie is a must see!!  From the beginning to the end you will be on the edge of your seat.  All of the actors do a great job, especially these 2 girls walking down the street and meet up with crazy Steve and his apprentice.  The comment about Survivor being gay is hillarious!!!!  It opens your eyes to how small towns really are!",1207008000,,335,4.1875
8573641,5,B0012OTVBM,"Really surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. Was expecting your run of the mill slash and gash and actually found this movie to be quite original and funny. Very tongue in cheek and didn't take itself too seriously while poking fun at the horror genre in general. The lead actor as ""Father"" Reynolds was very interesting and original. Worth checking out.",1206489600,,360,4.73015873015873
