3960681,2,B002O0LK3K,"The product description and the enthusiastic reviews filled me with high expectations. Unfortunately I am disappointed. As an introduction I watched a bonzai tree and a waterfall for a few minutes. Then during the body scan and the breathing meditation I watched a static outline of the human form, not much different to listening to a humble audio cd. I prefer the DVD ""Meditation for Everyone"" by Mike Harding. It's a more pleasant visual mindfulness meditation.",1269734400,29,464,5.118421052631579
3960682,5,B002O0LK3K,"I teach meditation and practice mediation.  I have begun to recommend this to others.  It was well done, with a very practical side to it.  Great job!",1261440000,13,150,4.481481481481482
3960683,5,B002O0LK3K,"Working with this mindfulness dvd has been a LIFE CHANGING experience and I would recommend it anyone! I'm a busy professional who lives the typical stress-stress-stress lifestyle. I knew it was time for a change, so I decided to buy the garden of now dvd to see what mindfulness meditation was all about. I was a skeptic at first, but to my surprise, learning mindfulness has made it a lot easier for me to stay centered in the stillness of the present moment when things get hectic and chaotic in life. I have tried other stress reduction products in the past, but this dvd really does make it MUCH easier to learn a powerful stress management tool!",1254700800,21,651,4.572649572649572
3960684,5,B002O0LK3K,"The Garden of Now truly simplifies the complexities of mindfulness and meditation. I am an author and lecturer on stress management and this DVD is an ideal fit for my students and readers. The soothing narration and visual effects allowed me to understand what parts of my body were most tense as I truly experienced the present moment. As I followed the guided steps of the exercises I was able to embrace the relaxing effects and better understand what it means to be in the now with my body and mind. Additionally, the guided steps of the various levels of mindfulness and the detailed body scan simultaneously unified my mind and body. I was also able to have a more restful sleep followed by a more productive day!

I have seen other videos on meditation and relaxation, but none of them were as effective as The Garden of Now. I had been looking for a DVD to use with college students and adults --finally, a resourceful tool I can use!! The narrator peacefully makes it easy for anyone to follow regardless of their meditation skill level or age. Thank you, I will use this frequently and often!!!

3960686,2,B002O0LK3K,"Basically rehashing Jon-Kabat-Zinn with some visuals to accompany the text.  There was absolutely nothing original in this video, so I feel one is better served by going to the original source.",1376784000,2,193,5.225806451612903
3960687,4,B002O0LK3K,This is a great video for beginners that want to learn meditation.  Being able to see what you want you mind to see while meditating I think is very helpful to let the beginner know what to expect.,1364601600,,197,4.184210526315789
3960688,1,B002O0LK3K,"I purchased this DVD hoping that somehow the visual elements would enhance my mindfulness meditation experience. What I found is that the introduction, body scan meditations, and beginner and advanced meditations are almost word-for-word from John Kabat-Zinn's Mindfulness Meditation CD's. Even the narrator's expressions and vocal tone mimic those of Kabat-Zinn. I know because I've been using Kabat-Zinn's CD's for a couple of years. This appears to be a DVD that was created by a married couple in which they pretty much just plagiarized another CD and threw in video of a waterfall and tree. They also included a picture of the producer's wife with yellow circles to tell you where you should be concentrating (as if this is even necessary!). I thought that maybe Kabat-Zinn and his group produced this to go along with their CD's but in the references the only acknowledgment of Kabat-Zinn is one of his books. C'mon. If you are going to copy someone else's work at least be creative enough to describe the possible sensations one might feel in different regions of the body in your own ways. This is highly unethical. If the producer was one of my college students I would have him expelled for this. Save yourself some money and take advantage of the free guided mindfulness meditations available at marc.ucla.edu. I just wasted $10.",1309478400,20,1340,4.986607142857143
3960689,5,B002O0LK3K,"Some of these exercises are so effective, I can't get to end of section. Fall asleep (no, I'm not narcoleptic). Non irritating voice, with great cuing. Absolutely wonderful. Reminds me of my 1967 acting classes, where we'd work on centering...very similar. And just as effective.",1299110400,6,279,5.222222222222222
3960690,5,B002O0LK3K,"This DVD was a great way to learn mindfulness. It has really helped my yoga practice. I introductory exercises use a waterfall and bonsai tree to explain the basic concepts behind mindfulness. After familiarizing myself with these chapters, the body scan exercise helped me expand mindful awareness to body movements. Now when I do yoga I am much more in touch with the present moment and my body.  This dvd would make a great addition to any yoga practice.",1296086400,2,457,4.784810126582278
3960691,2,B002O0LK3K,"No background music, very dry and bland. Glad I previewed as a rental before purchasing. Gaiam produces much better quality videos anyday! I suggest Maritza or Rodney Ye for meditation and yoga!",1295913600,3,194,5.09375
3960692,1,B002O0LK3K,"I have used several meditation DVD's that I have loved, after reading previous reviews I decided to give this DVD a chance. And I definitively wasted my money, as somebody else said, this should be in a dollar store. The exercise are extremely short (probably 3 to 5 minutes) and non sense. The voice in the DVD is not relaxing at all and is a stupid way of teaching mindfulness meditation. I can't believe others gave this DVD 5 stars. There is so much good stuff out there and this DVD totally disappointed me and my pocket. Don't waist you money in this DVD.",1286668800,8,561,4.403846153846154

8375757,4,B002O0LK3K,"I'm brand new to meditation, so this was a great place to start. There's an intro which walks you through the different types, then you may choose from a couple breathing meditations for every day. These are all guided meditations. The guys voice is...not the greatest, I wouldn't use ""relaxing"" to describe it, but it's tolerable. He's good at walking you through the meditation and giving advice.

I would not recommend this for anyone who has any type of meditation experience. This is a very green beginner level. Great for anyone trying to get into it though! I've greatly enjoyed it in helping me learn. I'll find a new video once I'm more comfortable on my own.",1427068800,3,668,4.7094017094017095

8375759,5,B002O0LK3K,"I am so thankful I found this meditation exercise.  I had been trying to learn on my own and it just wasn't working.
Now, I am learning how to do it the right way.
The soft, gentle almost hypnotic voice of the instructor guides you through each exercise.
I get into such a deep state of relaxation that I feel like an observer of my own body instead of a participant. When I am finished, I feel like I have had a very deep rest.  I feel so energized and peaceful.

Eventually, I will be able to do these meditation exercises all on my own, but for now, I am going to let Dr Turesky guide me
