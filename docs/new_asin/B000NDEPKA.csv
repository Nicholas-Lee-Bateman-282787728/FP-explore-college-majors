8176931,5,B000NDEPKA,"It's amazing how this DVD was made, I loved the movie very much and now realize on how much reality can be a good thing and a bad thing without a doubt. Interracial Dating in the country of America is not a shocking situation for me to see and learn about. I mostly believe it's the most colorful idea, and an original understanding into knowing why people date outside there race for different race as well. It's not because because of the color of a person's skin, or there perosonalities or even how they act. It's all about love and romance, and love will never have any color what so ever. This DVD is an outstanding classic controversy hit of all-time. When you buy this DVD, you'll understand why there are still interracial datings in America and why it will last for a very long time.",1213660800,,793,4.438356164383562
8176932,5,B000NDEPKA,"How is it possible in todays society that people STILL JUDGE others by the color of their skin and refer to themselves as CHRISTIANS? This film demonstrates just how hypocritcal the human race can be.  CClay's interviews show us that love is alive and well in the U.S. and it has many different forms as well as colors.  No longer is interracial dating a scandalous secret hidden from our families and friends.  The real life stories in this film depicts the true ignorance that still exists today, sad but true.  I love this film and the soundtrack JAMS. I bought several copies....",1171843200,4,583,4.686274509803922
