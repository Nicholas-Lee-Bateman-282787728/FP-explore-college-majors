8408720,5,B003Y5H1VO,"Fascinating slice of history showing how slavery in Missouri differed from the South. The subject is explored through narratives collected by the Federal Writers Project, interviews with experts in the field, and the riveting story of one slave woman whose attempt to escape her situation proved fatal.",1280966400,,302,5.446808510638298
8408721,5,B003Y5H1VO,"This documentary is a good tool for teaching those of us, that might not know our national or midwestern history, about what it was like living in a time that was turbulent to say the least. Dr. Johnson's description of his Great Grandfather, as the escaped slave that joined the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry Regiment in the Civil War, was quite interesting. It is strange for people to contemplate a relationship between slave and slave owner, other than animosity and hatred, but this presentation clearly shows that other feelings and emotions existed and are sometimes overlooked, while we so quickly judge otherwise in retrospect.",1280880000,,634,5.105769230769231
8408722,5,B003Y5H1VO,"For someone who grew up in Missouri I didn't know much of the history of slavery in this state.  This film was very enlightening and I found it extremely interesting.  The story Mr. Johnson tells of meeting the ancesters of the family that ""owned"" his great-grandfather was moving. Overall a very well made film that treats the subject of slavery with sensitivity and respect.",1280793600,,376,4.859375
8408723,5,B003Y5H1VO,This film takes a look at a part of history which hasn't been often examined; slavery outside the deep south. It approaches the subject objectively ia compelling fashion. It is both informative and entertaining.,1280793600,2,211,5.235294117647059
