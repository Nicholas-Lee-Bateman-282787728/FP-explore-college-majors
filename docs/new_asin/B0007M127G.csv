2220035,5,B0007M127G,"Linda LaRue is a revolutionary when it comes to fitness. Her CORE TRANSFORMER 1,000 Calorie BURN Kit
exemplifies this by its ease of use and its inarguable effectiveness. I highly recommend any and all products with Linda's wisdom and expertise attached.",1293667200,,254,5.219512195121951
2220036,4,B0007M127G,"Having worked with Linda and used her CORE TRANSFORMER for the past couple years, the one word I have to describe her product and choreography is ""Lifesaver"". That's because at 82 it's helped keep me moving optimally. I routinely use the CORE TRANSFORMER three times per week. It keeps my core, spine and hips strong, which I really appreciate.  And as the product is made from the same top professional grade rubber manufacturers (used by [...]), I know I'm using the best quality product. (It's also eco-friendly, as it's made from sustainable rubber trees--more good news.)

I like the fact that the routines are short--only 20 minutes, so they easily fit into my day. As a mother and grandmother, I recommend this kit to every body (and woman), because you only need the exercise tube instead of filling your house with all types of big, heavy pieces of fitness equipment. It's a solid 4 star core performance routine with all the right exercise science passionately and skillfully created by Lind",1291680000,,1001,4.882352941176471
2220037,5,B0007M127G,"Santa Clause and a whole list of fatty foods are coming to town this holiday season. If you ask for one thing on your list be sure to ask for this core transformer. I'm hoping to get rid of my holiday jiggles with the use of this equipment and I think it might actually work! I hate to run so I need something that works out all of my muscles in one, easy workout. From the burn I feel after last night's workout, I think I may have found the key!",1291680000,,447,3.923076923076923
2220038,4,B0007M127G,"For an honost review of my new, 3-dimensional constant resistant workout system visit the fitness blog site, Fit Bottomed Girls @[...]. They give the Kit 4 stars stating: ""We're all trying to do more in less time--work, family, driving, BlackBerrying, all of it. And I'm all for having more free time and less ""to-do"" time for sure. Which is why Linda LaRue's latest workout DVD the Core Transformer pretty much rocks my world. Or entire planetary system.

The DVD promises a lot: A three-dimensional two-in-one cardio core and constant resistance lean sculpting tubing workout. I'm not even fully sure what all that even means, but I want it. It also promises a burn of 1,000 calories if you do the whole 60-minute workout. I know--a pretty tall order. I was skeptical at first, but after about 10 minutes, I was a believer. A transformed Core Transformer devotee, if you will.""",1291593600,,879,4.86
2220039,5,B0007M127G,"I just started using the CORE TRANSFORMER and love it.
It is so simple and easy to use.  You can feel it working everywhere. I have lost one size in a very short time.  I feel so relax after working out with the Core Transformer. It is fun work with this simple yet effective device. I have suggested the use of Core Transformer to all my friends.",1290988800,,347,4.164179104477612
2220040,5,B0007M127G,"I was a little suspicious when I heard about the core transformer because I have worked with a tube before, but this is unlike anything else! My abs, back, arms, legs and butt are so sore after every workout and I already see and feel the difference. The trainer in the video is easy to listen to and follow and along with - and it doesn't hurt that he's super cute :) Overall, a great workout that I would recommend to everyone!!",1290988800,,430,4.2560975609756095
2220041,5,B0007M127G,"An entire gym in a tube! This is an effective, efficient, low cost, easily transportable and convenient way to work out. I have been using the Core Transformer for several months and have really toned up, not to mention losing a few pounds. It works my entire body and in 10 minutes, has me in a sweat and breathing hard. I particularly like that it focuses on the abdominals--who can't use abdominal work? It is such a relief to be able to get a real, MEANINGFUL workout on my own schedule and not have to travel to some expensive gym. You do need the DVD to learn to do the exercises correctly but they are not hard to learn and they're fun. This really works!",1289952000,,662,4.304
2220042,5,B0007M127G,Who knew that such a simple piece of equipment would jump start my workout. The DVD is easy to understand the the actual Core Transformer is so easy to use. Equally perfect for the novice and the seasoned athlete.,1289952000,,213,4.487179487179487
2220043,5,B0007M127G,I just started using the CORE TRANSFORMER and already love it. I love how when you move you can feel it working everywhere. Plus it is lots of fun :) very different than anything else I have tried!,1289952000,,197,4.2105263157894735
2220044,4,B0007M127G,"I was fortunate enough to take a class from Kathy at the Inner IDEA conference. It was my first experience with the CORE band, and I LOVED it! It helps beginners obtain proper form, and eliminates cheating. It was amazing to me how many ""seasoned"" Pilates participants (most of whom were instructors) realized they had been cheating in the movements. The band benefits advanced students, as well, and the Maximum CORE video details those exercises. I have not yet seen the video (thus I have no basis on which to give 5 stars), but Kathy's instruction in the class was right on, and she said the video was the same information. Because the band is made of canvas, it doesn't stretch like resistance bands would, making it far superior in my opinion. It also eliminates the strain on wrists and hands that can result from holding the bands, as feet and hands just slip into the ""pockets"" and can be held in the same natural position they would be without the band.",1153958400,,963,4.604651162790698
2220045,5,B0007M127G,"This is so far one of the best workout I've done at home.  I find it challenging and simple to follow. The instructor is funny and very encouraging. I LOVE IT... I'm working to perfect the 20 minute workout before moving on to the 40 and eventually doing the full 60 minutes.  I would recommend this to anyone who want to firm and tone while getting a good cardio, it's worth buying.",1313884800,,383,4.305555555555555
2220046,5,B0007M127G,"The 3D Core Transformer workout is the best.  Linda is the Bomb.  The workout will kick your butt!!  Keep working at it so you can master it.  The more you do it, the stronger you will get and then you can get creative with the band and do more.  I highly recommend this workout for you to do at home or on a business trip.  The band is weightless in your suitcase.  Do it and see your results in just one workout.

Thanks Linda for this AWESOME workout!!

2220047,5,B0007M127G,Used this in my Pilates class and wanted to be able to use it at home too. Simple and effective. Pilates has been the best form of exercise really gets you in touch with your body and your mind. The DVD is great demonstrates all you need to know to use the band effectively.,1307232000,,274,4.092592592592593
2220048,4,B0007M127G,"I'm giving this product a 4 star review because I do like the work out a lot.  Most of the time I only have 20 minutes or so to get in a workout and the Core Transformer works perfectly for me.  I do feel the burn while doing the moves and am usually sore the next day.  Working out with the resistant band constantly takes a little getting used to, but once you do the moves come easily.  The only issue I have (at least with my DVD) is that you cannot get to the cool down exercises from the main menu.  When I click on ""Cool Down"" in the main menu it takes me to the closing credits.  I have to start the 60 minute workout and fast forward through to get to the cool down, which isn't a big deal, it just would be easier to get there from the menu.  Just FYI...",1304553600,5,764,3.890322580645161
2220049,4,B0007M127G,"I love this system, however within less then 3 months of using it I have had two bands snap mid-workout. I have been working out in sneakers, on a soft mat, and am only 5'4 ....so I do not understand why this keeps happening. I want to keep using the system, but I do not want to have to replace the band every few weeks.",1301961600,,321,3.953846153846154
2220050,4,B0007M127G,I was needing a change and found it with this workout. I feel the bands are of high quality and they still give me the same exact resistance as when I started. (about 2 months) I love that I feel different sore muscles the next day after this workout than others. I don't necessarily agree that it is 1000 calories but it is a really good workout. I'm glad I took a chance on it.,1301270400,,379,4.066666666666666
2220051,5,B0007M127G,"After 50 years of accummulating Belly Fat, I would definitely recommend the Core Transformer to others. I'm now three weeks into using this product, approximately 4x per week.  I've been feeling the effects since session #1, but now after three weeks, and 30' of workout, I'm starting to see the difference.  I'm hoping to get up to 40' in the next week or two.  Also, as a frequent traveler, I will definitely take this on the road with me.",1300838400,3,441,4.556962025316456
2220052,4,B0007M127G,"First let me say, this is a good workout; you will sweat and burn. The steps are easy to follow and it's not too fast paced that you are behind trying to keep up with the next step. That simply doesn't happen with this series. The steps are repetitive enough and prompted effectively so that you know what to expect with each new move. Having said that, I simply found the constant work-out with the tubes to be cumbersome and awkward. I have no doubt that I was burning calories and shredding fat; I simply find free weights, steps, and kick-boxing to be more fluent and with less back strain. I have been using P90X, various FIRM videos, a step-boxing set, and some of Charlene's videos. I was drawn to this video because of the promise to burn 1,000 calories. I have a nasty 25 pounds left to loose. I find myself preferring many of my other videos over Linda LaRue's because of the constant and awkward pull of the tubes. I even tried using a higher grade tube but, for me, it wasn't any better. Let me also say, I use tubes with other videos but they're typically used in conjunction with outer workout strategies and not used exclusively. I think that was the problem here. Tubes, alone, for an hour-ish is too much for me; boring, cumbersome, and awkward. I would have given the video a ""3"" except my 15 year old daughter enjoys this set and prefers it over the faster paced aerobics/step/and/or step-boxing videos which I tend to gravitate towards. This would be a great travel video. Slip the dvd and tube in your back to take on a business trip for a quick work-out. That's how I'll use it, anyway.",1295568000,,1608,4.454237288135594
2220053,5,B0007M127G,I only did half the reps in the 20 minute workout because I felt the immediate burn.  This product really works the muscles effectively and differently without aggravating my vulnerable lower back and hips.  Definitely a keeper for both my home gym and suitcase.,1295568000,,262,4.931818181818182
2220054,5,B0007M127G,"This 60 minute total body workout led by Raneir featuring the Core Transformer tubing device. Terry Ann & Linda LeRue are b/g'ers & Linda shows beginner modifications. The set is a cute little gym w/ lockers & fitness paraphernalia around the perimeter.  The dvd is broken up so you can complete a 20, 40, or 60 minute w/o. You will use your Core Transformer for the entire workout & won't need any other equipment.

20 Min W/O: Raneir starts each move off at a slower tempo, then ups the tempo, and adds in plyos to many of the moves. After a quick warmup you move into squats that go into plyo squats, clock squats (move your arms in wide circles while squatting) into a plyo version, crabwalks w/ arm movements into plyos, and finishes with a long set of runners lunge knee pulls.

40 Min W/O: Includes the first 20 minutes and then adds in squat w/ wide chest pulls and adds a balance side left, knee pull w/ a torso twist, a fun golf swing w/ a squat, wood chop squat, standing crunches, figure 8's adding in plyos, rear leg lift- front arm raise squats, chair pose w/ high Y arms, and a twisted chair pose to really burn out those abs.

60 Min W/O: After finishing the 40 minutes above you now perform each move at tempo and he adds in plenty of plyo moves to really burn those calories. The workout concludes with a nice quick stretch.

Using the Core Transformer with this w/o REALLY amps up the intensity! With the exception of the plyo's there is literally NO impact and yet my heart rate was up up up! Using the Core Transformer definitely worked my muscles in a new & different way- which is great for variety & fun as well as muscle confusion. I would rate this a low advanced w/o that really targets the core. I consider this a great core cardio w/o that includes some band strength work as well. I received this kit to review.",1294272000,5,1841,4.355685131195335
8048890,2,B0007M127G,gave me a back injury and the string burst to easily; stay far away from this product,1424736000,,85,4.0588235294117645
8048891,5,B0007M127G,"Watching this workout it looks deceivingly easy. But it is a hard core, core workout. You will burn 1000 calories if not more. This workout I am taking with me on my cruise this week, it's low impact, but it will have you sweating and huffing and puffing.
The instructor is very easy to follow and modifications are provided for beginners.",1351468800,,339,4.573770491803279
8048892,5,B0007M127G,"I truthfully was walking with crutches until I started this Core Transformer.  I walked 10 yards for the first time in two years.  Its an amazing product on your core, pelvis, neck, arms and legs.  I can not say enough positive things about the Core Transformer!",1346284800,,262,4.6521739130434785
8048893,5,B0007M127G,"I purchased the Core Transformer after reading a fitness guru's comparison of several home workout options.  I was already doing Pilates, step aerobics, and using my Total Gym, but was looking to add a cardio component that would also focus on core strengthening.  I beat off breast cancer, and after going through the 'fun' of chemo and radiation, I really needed something to help me rebuild my aerobic capacity. The Core Transformer has definitely fit the bill. I have both the 1000 Calorie Burn (includes a 20, 40, and 60 minute standing workout ) and the 3-D Fat Burn (includes a 15 and 30 minute combined standing and mat workout) DVDs.  As described in the review, these are easy to understand workouts but really push you because of the intensity.  Less intense modifications are demonstrated and there is always the option of doing a shorter workout.  Be prepared to sweat and pant - and feel great afterwards! I am 56 years old and have exercised regularly most of my life. Core Transformer is one of the most complete video/DVD based workouts I have ever experienced.

A word about customer service - I had an issue with my band and to my great astonishment, the person providing customer service was Linda LaRue herself.  In this day and age of sketchy customer service, it's nice to know there is someone like Linda LaRue, dedicated to excellence in all aspects of her product.

8048894,2,B0007M127G,"I had to return this item, because I could not see how it could meet my need for an ""on-the-go"" exercise tool.  It felt like a giant rubber band vs. something to offer a little resistance.",1344988800,,188,4.222222222222222
8048895,5,B0007M127G,I have been an exercise nut for many years.  Now in my 60's I choose carefully the type of exercise to fit into my life.  Linda's core video is a great workout.  I feel that I get in the one hour all I need to keep in great shape.  Great cardio and a full body workout with a lot of sweating.  And very little stress on the body.  Highly recommend.,1344729600,,348,3.9

8048897,5,B0007M127G,"I don't live close to a gym so I am always on the look out for excercise video's I can do at home.  I have some good ones but then there is Linda's . . OMG . . it is amazing.  I love the fact that it is low impact so your not jumping and doing all sorts of jacks and stuff which could potentially hurt you.  Instead it's low impact but the resistance bands force you to work harder then you thought possible and hence you get your heartrate up and the weight comes off.  I have been doing this one for about 2 weeks and have already noticed my stomach size decreased.  My legs are also alittle baggy in my jeans, I can't believe it.  Just bought her other DVD Fusion because if it's half as good as this one . . I will be very happy.  Thank you Linda!!!!",1332979200,,754,3.9210526315789473
