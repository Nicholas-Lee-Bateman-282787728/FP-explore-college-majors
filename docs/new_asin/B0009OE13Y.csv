8064101,4,B0009OE13Y,"Before I get started, just wanted to note that for anyone who has read my reviews about older wrestling PPV's from the 1980's-mid 1990's knows that most of them I catch on ""WWE Classics"" On-Demand channel where they air older PPV's.  They also air older TV shows with one of them being the NWA's ""World Championship Wrestling"" shows from Jim Crockett Promotions and they currently are in the era of the summer of 1987.  Now for any NWA fan, that ment it was time for the Great American Bash tour with the special twist this year being the birth of a new match that would become a staple of not only NWA but also WCW during their Turner years and influence various other matches in other promotions in such as WWE (Elimination Chamber) & TNA (Lethal Lockdown)...the War Games so I was able to find a copy of the classic VHS tape that highlighted the 1987 Great American Bash to review here today.  Now keep in mind a few things that at this time as the Great American Bash wasn't stictly a one night 3 hour PPV-like event, it was a month long tour with various matches happening across the country so you'll see some superstars on this tape 2-3 times in different matches & locations.  Also keep in mind that Turner Home Entertainment (distributors of WCW/NWA home video) would edit their tapes down to two hours so with the excpetion of a few matches, most of the matches are edited.

War Games I: SuperPowers (Dusty Rhodes & Nikita Koloff), Road Warriors, Paul Ellering vs. Four Horsemen (Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, Lex Luger, James J. Dillion) - For those newer fans who have never seen a War Games match before, it's a match where two rings are back to back with a steel cage surrounding both rings with a caged top.  The match starts off with one member of each team in the ring fighting against each other for 5 minutes while a coin toss determines which team gets to send a wrestler in the match for a 2 minute ""2 on 1"" period (which the heels always won) and when that period is over, the other team sends in a wrestler to even the odds before the other team sends in another wrestler for a 2 minute period.  The teams alternate back & forth until all members of each team are in the ring which is where ""The Match Beyond"" begins where the only way to win was either by submission or surrender.  Various highlights including the starting period between Dusty & Arn with Anderson getting on hell of a low blow, Animal giving Tully Blanchard slingshots into take over & over & over again, Nikita Koloff getting back to back spike piledrivers directly onto his neck, the crowd being so loud that you honestly couldn't hear the commentary at times, Paul Ellering bring in a spiked wristband as a weapon, and the performance of J.J. Dillion in the match from the moment he came in & hit Hawk to when he was the victim of the Road Warriors Doomsday Device that left J.J. with an injury that he still feels to this very day.  This was the very first War Games & it was certainly a violent match to just sit back & watch for it's time.

Barry Windham vs. Rick Steiner - This was joined in progress & only showed the last 2 minutes where Rick Steiner was dominate before Windham got a quick victory that resulted in the crowd booing the result.

Steel Cage Match: NWA United States Champion Nikita Koloff vs. Lex Luger - Luger had an advantage going into this match as Nikita had his neck in a brace from being injured as a result of the spike piledrivers he recieved in the War Games match.  The match showed the opening minutes and then skipped to the middle of the match with Luger heavily sweating & working over Nikita's neck with a headlock for several minutes which saw Luger constantly wrench & have a strong lock on the hold.  Luger continued to work on Koloff's neck with a swinging neckbreaker & removing the brace before applying a full nelson.  Nikita was able to mount a comeback before the referee was knocked out & Dillion throwing a chair into the ring to help Luger gain his first United States championship.  Eventhough the match was edited, this was a great performance from Luger (who has a bad reputation for not being a good worker) as he used the old ""Anderson/Horsemen"" formula of finding a hurt bodypart & constantly working over it as he did here with Koloff's neck.

Texas Death Match: Steve Williams vs. Dick Murdock - Williams was looking for revenge for the injury to his arm (which he was wearing a cask for) caused by Murdock and it should be noted that Williams had Magnum T.A. in his corner while Murdock had Eddie Gilbert.  They only showed the last 3 minutes of the match which was nothing more than a fist fight before the cast was the deciding factor here.

Fabulous Freebirds vs. Ivan Koloff, Manny Fernandez, Paul Jones - A six man tag here that was edited & only showed around 3 minutes of the match but it was fun to watch for that short time.

Barbed Wire Ladder Match: Dusty Rhodes vs. Tully Blanchard - ""I WANT MY MONEY!"" is the phrase from Dusty Rhodes that summerises what this match is all about.  Dusty & Tully had a previous match where $100,000 was on the line but due to a controversal finish along with J.J. Dillion running off with the money, this match was made to settle the issue with Barry Windham in Dusty's corner to assure this was a fair fight.  Both men where in their street fight/bunkhouse gear and were victims of the barbed wire around the ring at various times such as Tully bleeding from his arm & forehead while Dusty got it over his eye.  Both Windham & Dillion did get involved in the match while Dusty & Tully traded off using a loaded glove before Dusty was able to climb the ladder & get the bag full of money.  Now keep in mind that this ladder match happened in 1987 around 7 years before Shawn Michaels & Razor Ramon had their ladder match that would change the level of quality in a this type of match so if your expecting high spots then you won't get it here as this was mostly just a brawl with the ladder being a small & almost irrelevant factor in this match.

Steel Cage Match: NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Jimmy Garvin - There were a bunch of stipulations going into this match as Jimmy made sure this match was the same type of match in the same arena that Flair lost the NWA Title to Dusty Rhodes the previous year while Flair wanted a date with Garvin's valey & wife Precious if he walked out the winner.  This match was edited as we saw both men go back & forth against each other with Garvin using the cage to make Flair bleed before Garvin twisted his knee after a leapfrog which then saw Flair punish that knee so much to the point where Jimmy couldn't stand up & Ronnie Garvin came out to ringside.  Flair just kept punishing Garvin till he finally got the victory & was guarenteed the date with Precious.

NWA Tag Team Champions Rock N' Roll Express vs. NWA United States Tag Team Champions Midnight Express - This was a match where both tag team titles were on the line while it should be noted that Jim Cornette wasn't at ringside to manage while Big Bubba was.  This was joined in progress as we saw the Midnight Express just heavily work over Robert Gibson until he made the hot tag to Ricky Morton which saw the match get heavily out of control with Big Bubba getting involved leading to a DQ & both teams retaining their titles.  This was short but good for what we saw.

War Games II: SuperPowers (Dusty Rhodes & Nikita Koloff), Road Warriors, Paul Ellering vs. Four Horsemen (Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, Lex Luger) & War Machine - This match took place in the Orange Bowl in Flordia with a sold out audience that would definatly define the phrase ""hanging from the rafters.""  This match had a few changes such as some of the order of entrances switched around & a masked wrestler by the name of the War Machine (who was really Ray ""Big Bubba"" Traylor) replacing the injured J.J. Dillion but was pretty much the same bout with some of the same spots such as the Horsemen using the spike piledriver, Dusty giving Arn Anderson the low blow, and the spiked wristband coming into play once again.  This was still a fun match to watch.

So in the end, the only thing I didn't care for is some of the 2-3 min. irrelevant matches (Freebirds six man tag or the Windham/Steiner) could have been done away to maybe add more time to the matches that were heavily built up on TV going into this event such as the Midnight/Rock N' Roll or the Williams/Murdock matches.  However this tape satified me overall with what I saw & is definately a collectors item to get for fans of this time period so I recommend.",1282348800,2,8624,4.420189274447949
8064102,5,B0009OE13Y,This is the other one that I ordered and this is the match that WWE used to create Hell in a Cell so again I love my old school wrestling period!,1260921600,,145,3.7096774193548385
8064103,5,B0009OE13Y,"The First & The Best! This video is one of the best NWA videos of the 80's. They are all here...Rhodes,Koloff,Animal,Hawk&Ellering vs. Anderson,Blanchard,Luger,Dillon&""Nature Boy""Ric Flair in a 2 ring-steel cage bloodbath! There is a second ""War Games"" match at the end of the tape which isn't as good but it's ok. Also there are 2 steel cage title matches. One is Dusty vs. Luger for the US Title. The other is for the NWA World Heavyweight belt with Flair vs. Jim Garvin. This match begins about 10 minutes in and is one of the best on the tape(it is my personal favorite and the only edited match on the tape which is too bad because it draws alot of ""heat"" with one enraged fan trying to scale the cage to get at Flair!)Great tape",1141689600,4,734,4.485074626865671
