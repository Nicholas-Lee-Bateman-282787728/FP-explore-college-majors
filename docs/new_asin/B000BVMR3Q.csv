8093174,2,B000BVMR3Q,"I would give it 5 stars for content if one wishes to learn about our parks. In just over an hour this video covers 20 of the nations parks from the east to west coasts. The major drawback to this DVD is the video quality--the reason for the two stars. The DVD looks like a VHS copy. The video is not crisp/sharp. The date of the DVD may say 2009 but when one observes the shortness of the shorts on the hikers and the vehicle makes, the video may have been produced in the early 80s and formatted for a DVD. The video simply does not measure up to the high quality video experience many of now take fro granted in recent DVDs",1393113600,,625,4.0894308943089435
