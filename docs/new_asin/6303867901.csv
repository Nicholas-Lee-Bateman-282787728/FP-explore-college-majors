7857491,5,6303867901,"Jeffrey Combs was great as a videophotographer who is one of the only remaining witnesses to the massacre of twelve police officers.  David Warner and Lance Henrikson were great as former CIA agents turned drug dealers.  Jeffrey Combs has great physicality being a former dancer.  He jumps onto car hoods, jumps into a truck bed and is constantly climbing and running.  Jeffrey Combs is very believeable  when in pain because he shows his pain both physically and orally.  David Warner was consistently great in this movie as a villain who had his men massacre 12 police officers.  He spent most of the movie trying to retrieve the videotape of the massacre as well as trying to kill Jeffrey Combs' character.",1396137600,,709,4.858333333333333
7857492,5,6303867901,"Im gonna Go Straight to the point on this Movie it was Pretty Good for an Action Movie that you think would Suck but it turns out to be the Opposite. I gave this Movie 5 Stars Because of this it had Good Action as well as My Favorite things in Movies Car Crashes and it had 3 Wrecks in it which the first 1 was Pretty Good were the Car goes Flying over 3 other Cars and Smashes Down on to the another Car and gets Crushed and then the Second Crash was Alright were it drove over a Bridge and gets Smashed and lastly the 3rd Crash was Frikken Awesome and out of sight this time its a Nice Old Caddilac from the 80,s that goes turning in mid air and comes down Hard and gets totally wrecked. As for Storyline I realy don't care but it was Good its Basically about a Tape that the Bad Guys want so they won't get Thrown in Jail over a Hit they did on some Cops. Overall this is a Cool Action Movie and to finally see Lance Henrikson in a Movie that Actually goes good is a First.",1359504000,,976,3.909547738693467
7857493,5,6303867901,"Similar to many movies in this genre during the mid-90's this one offers something different, believability. An unknown and under appreciated cast bring home the drama. Watch for the eloquent newsman played by Brett Oates. Without his sheer acting ability this movie wouldn't have been nearly as successful at the box office. A must have for any movie buff!!",1357430400,,358,5.084745762711864
7857494,1,6303867901,"Felony is a terrible movie.  The writing is illogical, the directing is choppy and disjointed, and the acting is awful, with one exception.  The camera work looks like a poorly done television production.  The special effects are amateurish and outlandish with slow moving cars suddenly flipping and flying through the air from a single gun shot defying all physics or reason.

How someone gave this mess a 5 star rating is beyond me.  Save your money and buy almost any other movie.  This is like an badly made porn movie without the nudity.  It truly is beyond bad.",1333411200,,567,4.724489795918367
7857495,5,6303867901,"Although I'm sure it was not the intent of anyone involved in its making, this movie is a *laugh riot*.

My interest in ""Felony"" is the ensemble of actors they've put together--David Warner!!! Lance Henriksen!! Jeffrey Combs!! Joe Don Baker!! Charles Napier!! My God, what a cast!

The story is some vague, double-crossing FBI/drug running thing (not to--heh!--spoil it, for anyone), but I can't say I was really watching for the plot. The movie could have been about just about anything, and, with that cast, I would have bought it.

It was a joy to watch these actors--some of them, my very favorites--together.

The highlights for me: David Warner driving a pickup truck, and dropping an F-bomb; Jeffery Combs (in the Bruce Campbell role, apparently) escaping Joe Don Baker's rescue, and later, crashing through his front window when he could have very easily gone through the door he had just used; and, finally, David Warner telling Lance that Joe Don was ""just waiting for us to do something stupid"" and Lance replying, ""It's FAR too late for that."" My husband and I had to pause the movie--we were laughing too hard to hear any more dialogue.

It's really not a bad movie, by any means; it's just rather clumsily put together. The cast does what they can, and it is because of them that ""Felony"" is in any way watchable. A gem!!",1291334400,8,1335,4.737068965517241
7857496,4,6303867901,"Lance Henriksen (Hard Target, Millennium) and Leo Rossi (Relentless) are together again since ""Hit List"". They add their special talents to this movie and their faces to the cover, a big reason why I bought it. Mr. Henriksen repeats his classic role as the controling mad man behind the scenes. Mr. Rossi, playing a cop, doesn't get to display his usual cocky attitude much, a drawback he overcomes. Anther great in this movie of doublecross is David Warner (Wax Works, Time After Time). His British cool is perfect as the resourceful rougue CIA agent. Jeffery Combs (Re-animator) takes a step out of the sci-fi realm here portraying a film maker, but one keeps expecting him to revert any minute. Other greats are Joe Don Baker (Walking Tall) and Charles Napier (Hit List). Ashley Lawrence (Hellraiser) is the girl trying to do good. There's plenty of action and nothing is what it seems. Worth buying or renting to see these great actors together.",1003622400,3,949,4.864197530864198
