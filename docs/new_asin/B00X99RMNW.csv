7166924,4,B00X99RMNW,"I have waited for a long time for this to come to BluRay and it has thanks to Scream Factory! The film looks better than ever and so far I have listened to the Cristina Raines commentary and she had nothing good to say about making the film itself.  I wish there had been a Behind the Scenes documentary of some kind about the whole production, but with so little for so many years this is good. Fans of the film, this is worth the upgrade (and there are 2 other commentaries besides that of Cristina Raines, including one with the Director, Michael Winner.",1442966400,11,557,4.355769230769231
7166925,5,B00X99RMNW,Great blu ray from Scream Factory! Scream Factory just added Universal on its list of new releases. The Sentinel is one of them. It came out in the late '70s when they knew how to make a good horror movie. This blu ray edition is a new HD scan and looks wonderful compared to the older shoddy DVD releases. I was real shocked to see this looking this good coming from Scream Factory! The other treat is the three audio commentaries! Was able to get this early directly from Scream Factory (along with the US blu ray debut of The Legacy) and had to spread the word. If you like this film then you will LOVE this blu ray!!,1440892800,2,620,4.218487394957983
7166926,5,B00X99RMNW,"Oddly enough I first became aware of this gem of a horror flick from watching ""The Burbs"" where Corey Feldman's character describes it to Tom Hanks in an attempt to creep him out. I was a horror fan and was surprised to find out that it was a real movie he was referring to, so being curious I had to check it out. It turned out to be one of the best horror films I'd ever seen. It's brilliantly conceived and is one of those where the building or house is an actual character, as in The Shining, and lends to this movie an atmosphere that is unreal. Although this is not as well known as Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist, this is 70's horror at it's finest. If you like haunted house movies I highly recommend this. Hopefully it gets the treatment it deserves and can be seen it all it's glory.",1440460800,8,794,4.196078431372549
7166927,5,B00X99RMNW,"Saw this when it first came out after reading about the Rick Baker make-up used in the film. There was a whole article on how he recreated an eyeball that would ooze just right. So i expected realistic looking ""walkers""...what i got was so much more. This is one of the scariest movies i've ever seen. To this day, i have always mentioned ""The Sentinel"" when horror films come up in conversation. Yes, it's a 70s flick so it has that ""vibe"", but the story is just creepy as hell!!! Literally. From classic haunted mansion, complete with attached spirits, to a weird apocalyptic cult (is there any other kind) of fallen priests who guard the gates of hell. Highly recommend (although i'm sure there will be naysayers because everyone's definition of scary runs the gambit of Jason to the Exorcist to the POV ""Paranormal Activity"" craze (which i'm not into). All i can say, is if you like the late 60s / 70's era horror films (like ""Legend of Hell House"", ""The Omen"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", etc),with the same feel ""The Conjuring"" recreated so beautifully, i can't see how you'll be disappointed.",1439337600,13,1090,4.712041884816754

7166941,4,B00X99RMNW,"Director Michael Winner (1935-2013) made a number of my favorite films during the 1970s. It started out with LAWMAN (1971) followed by his breakthrough year, 1972, when he made THE NIGHTCOMERS, with Marlon Brando and 2 Charles Bronson flicks CHATO'S LAND, and THE MECHANIC. 1973 saw SCORPIO with Burt Lancaster and then came the reviled yet highly successful DEATH WISH in 1974. I mention all of this because it was THE SENTINEL in 1977 and all the controversy surrounding it that ended his career as a a high profile Hollywood filmmaker. He would make one more noteworthy film, a remake of THE BIG SLEEP in 1978 (Winner updated it and changed the setting to London which angered Raymond Chandler and Bogart/Bacall enthusiasts) and that was essentially that. I continue to watch his 1970s film as they never fail to engage and entertain me.

Back to THE SENTINEL. The controversy arose over a particularly graphic murder (which scared the audience) and the infamous finale in which Winner, taking a tip from Tod Browning's 1932 film FREAKS, used real life deformed people to play the denizens of Hell (which outraged and disgusted others). THE SENTINEL continues Winner's practice of getting high profile stars on their way up (Christopher Walken) or near the end of their careers (Ava Gardner) to appear in his movies. The story, based on a book, deals with a NYC fashion model (Christina Raines) who moves into a beautiful, old apartment which seems too good to be true. Of course it is. While there she meets some some rather strange neighbors presided over by Burgess Meredith who gives a spellbinding performance especially at the end. Her boyfriend (Chris Sarandon) investigates the building and comes across a startling revelation. To say any more would ruin it for the people who haven't seen it.

THE SENTINEL was surprisingly not a box office success and quickly disappeared although some people never forgot it. The next chapter begins with its sale to TV. It was considered so offensive that it was censored beyond recognition with new unrelated footage shot, much footage removed (including a lesbian couple), voiceovers, and the Catholic Church changed to a heretical sect. For years this is the only way the film was seen by many. The next chapter occurs in the early 21st century when the original, uncut version is released on DVD garnering a number of new fans who had never seen it and surprising old fans who only knew the TV version. The final chapter has now been written with the film now available on Blu-Ray and looking better than it ever has. It contains a wealth of extras including commentaries from actress Cristina Raines and director Michael Winner.",1444348800,11,2681,4.929203539823009
7166942,5,B00X99RMNW,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Its not a secret that I love a good horror film. Ive written praises for so many and lamented the fact that some outstanding horror films have been passed over time and again when it comes to award season. But lately there has been a glut of horror films, a far cry from when I was younger and you had one come out maybe three times a year (with the exception of drive-in fare). The thing about those movies is that most of them took the time to be a solid film as well as a horror flick. Rather than a hastily tossed together found footage movie, there were movies with plots that had some depth. That was the case with THE SENTINEL.

The movie takes place in New York in the seventies. Alison Parker (Christina Raines) is a high paid model living the good life. A career on the rise and a high class lawyer, Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon), for a boyfriend everything is going her way. Michael wants her to move in with him but Alison wants to live on her own for a while first. While apartment hunting with a real estate agent (Ava Gardner) she finds just the right place, an old brownstone with a furnished vacant apartment.

Alison moves in knowing only that the top floor is home to a reclusive aging priest named Father Halliran (John Carradine). Once shes moved in the rest of the tenants begin to make their presence known. First is a short visit by Charles Chazen (Burgess Meredith), a kindly old man with a parakeet on his shoulder and a cat at his feet. He welcomes her to the building and tells her the names of the other tenants. The next two she meets are Gerde Engstrom (Sylvia Miles) and Sandra (Beverly DAngelo), a pair of lesbians who surprise her when Sandra masturbates in front of her while Gerde makes coffee.

Early on Alison begins having strange feelings while staying in her apartment. She hears noises upstairs but finds nothing. When she hears things once more later on one of the more terrifying moments in the movie happens involving a person from her past, one that brings back harsh memories of her childhood. To tell you more about that would ruin it so just let me say that this is one of the creepiest moments Ive ever seen in a horror film. Kudos to make up man Dick Smith for this amazing scene.

With each passing day Alison begins feeling drained and ill, collapsing at a commercial shoot. Concerned about her well-being Michael begins to look into both her past and the brownstone and its occupants. What he uncovers is not for the faint of heart. *SPOILER ALERT* While the trailer and tag lines pretty much reveal this, the brownstone is actually the gates of hell. Realizing he is all that stands between Alison and a life of servitude guarding those gates, Michael sets out to save her.

As I said, most of the items Ive discussed here can be found in the trailer for the movie or blurbs written about it. It doesnt matter. It is the constructions of this tale, the fine combination of acting, set design, location scouting and the overall direction of Michael Winner that makes this movie run like a Swiss clock. The jumps aren't forced and yet you will jump. The eeriness of the brownstone and its tenants will make your skin crawl. And the final revelation at the end will be one not guessed early on.

Released on blu-ray by Shout/Scream Factory, the presentation is perfection with a clear picture on hand to help those goosebumps along. Not only do you get that new high definition transfer of the film the extras include an audio commentary track by Christina Raines, an audio commentary track with writer/producer Jeffrey Konvitz, an interview with assistant director Ralph S. Singleton, audio commentary by director Michael Winner, theatrical trailers and TV spots and a still gallery featuring movie stills, press photos, posters and lobby cards.

Horror fans will want to add this to their collection as quickly as possible. Its a horror film that holds up quite well after all these years, having been released in 1977. My guess is that after seeing it the odds of you walking around the house in the dark will decrease for a time and you will never look behind a door again in a dark house. Another great movie from Shout/Scream that needs to be on your shelf.",1443484800,16,4273,4.561929595827901

8715529,5,B00X99RMNW,"Scream Factory continues their blazingly good high definition video transfer work with a digital upgrade of Michael Winner's 1977 quasi-shocker THE SENTINEL (not to be confused with the Michael Douglas thriller of the same surname), a picture that has (until now at least) been consigned to the viewing menus of indiscriminate classic horror fans. Although the extras appear to at first to be rather minute for a current day Scream release, potential buyers of this item should be aware that this release ranks within the top tier of the Shout!/Scream Blu-Ray offerings, especially considering the fact that there are no video interviews with the stars or director included here. But what is offered is nothing other than revelatory and essential for the serious film collector. Ralph S. Singleton's lengthy interview clip is an essential watch for any aspiring filmmakers out there, and he is nothing less than candid in describing what it was like to work with the great Michael Winner and his crew, how he got started in the picture business (after having been inspired by a screening of Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey), and what people do when trying to sell and market movies these days. Singleton is down to earth and insightful in his rather telling commentary upon the movie business. There are three absolutely fantastic audio commentaries included here that help to make this Blu-Ray one of the most special releases in the Scream Factory cannon. Writer/producer Jeffrey Konvitz (led by commentator Nathaniel Thompson) is involved in a terrific commentary track in which he candidly explains the origins of the movie's source novel, the rather hazardous journey of the book from page to screen, and what he is doing nowadays in the both the book publishing and film distribution worlds (Konvitz offers some incisive comments upon the business of proving intellectual property law cases, and the track delves quite deeply into the rather tendentious nature of the moviemaking business itself--tellingly, Konvitz admits that he doesn't like Michael Winner as a director, and he is in fact rather mournful about the whole movie adaptation process concerning THE SENTINEL). Actress Christina Raines is also guided through a hilarious audio commentary track in which she mostly describes Winner's relationship with her on the set as ""unpleasant"" and how the whole atmosphere of the picture was out of her league in terms of the picture's genre. And, of course, there is a wonderful (and wonderfully amusing) reminiscence track by Winner himself, who blazes through his recording session telling the audience countless on the set tales about the movie, how he got into a contract with Universal, how he came to work with Chris Sarandon on the film, and even a brief memo about how he ended up falling out of bed one morning after having slept with a beautiful model the night before in a ritzy hotel room! Other miraculous and wondrous anecdotes and vignettes await you on Winner's track and it too is an absolute keeper. There is also a fantastic, 1080 pixel image transfer of the film, coded in 1.78:1 frame and it looks tremendous to these screen weary eyes, especially considering the fact that THE SENTINEL has not had any kind of decent special edition release to speak of before this. This is the best color and tone presentation that one will be able to find of the movie, certainly as of now.
Christina Raines is a rather foxy lead in a story that encompasses some fragments from other hit ""horror"" movies (THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, and even ROSEMARY'S BABY) of the era, but I personally prefer to think of Winner's movie as an original project. Considering the fact that Konvitz helped get the project set up at Universal pictures (he was on board as a producer at various early stages) it is hard to see now why his original screenplay wasn't filmed more closely, but once Winner came aboard I think he chose to develop the movie more along the lines of his own personal aesthetic (and even if it doesn't scare horror fans very much, he does manage to get in some repulsive moments that linger in the corridors of the mind afterwards). It might have been fun to read Winner's revisions, but one suspects that much of what he wanted in the final film remains. While Konvitz seems to be unhappy with the final result, THE SENTINEL is unique among thrillers in that it flirts with a supernatural premise without ever going full on into scenes of outlandish supernatural phenomena; still, Burgess Meredith is one of many celebrities on hand who manage to elevate the film to a level of genuine cinematic intensity. There is even a nod to Browning's FREAKS at the picture's conclusion; exploitative or not, the deformed and disfigured folks at the end of the film add a touch of realism to the menacing atmosphere of the story.
THE SENTINEL may not be as scary (or as horrifying) as it seemed to be back in 1977, but the picture still retains much of its entertainment value, and with the naked ladies (Beverly D'Angelo among them) and monstrous imagery on display there is certainly much to see in the movie itself. As grotesque and cinematically antiquated as most of the picture feels now, I personally find it a lot more enjoyable and engaging than today's modern horror movies. Still, Winner is an acquired taste...but once you acquire him he becomes a director that you can certainly come to rely upon for entertainment. Scream Factory does justice to what made Winner's pictures special; rather than writing him off as yet another journeyman director, this new Blu-Ray shows that Winner wanted every movie set to be a party and every attendee to get their worth in fun and creative anticipation. For Winner, the business of movies was certainly a business, but he did everything with so much joy and self-belief that it's hard not to like what he left us with. A+ for the overall effort, presentation, and wonderful (and long overdue) extras.",1473638400,,5958,4.905847373637265

8715531,3,B00X99RMNW,"I remember this being better than it was when watching it again... doesn't hold up as well as other horror movies from the era. But it does have some creepy moments and 3 (!) commentaries, so it's worth having.",1466640000,,210,4.410256410256411
