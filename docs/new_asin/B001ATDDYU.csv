3467157,5,B001ATDDYU,"This is Sadie's 3rd DVD after her ""Drum solo"" and ""Sultry slow moves"", and as before her moves are very challenging and not for complete beginners. This time there are 3 levels of difficulty for each of the 6 drills including torso, abdominals and hips and as always tons of useful explainations and demonstrations, all in a very straightforward, no-nonsense manner. As for the other DVDs, the price is a little high but considering it is 2 hours long and very professionally made, it is worth buying if you are neither a complete beginner nor looking for an easy workout DVD.
At the end there is a lovely performance by Sadie to ""Tamra Henna"" showing her amazing isolations and fluidity.",1217462400,9,688,4.741666666666666
3467158,5,B001ATDDYU,"In the world of bellydancing, Sadie is known for her incredibly controlled technique. Just today I was showing someone a video clip of her taqsim and drum solo (Belly Dance Live) with her partner, Kaya, and the person remarked that every bit of the music could be seen in her movements. She has absolutely jaw-dropping precision.
Looking at Sadie, it's difficult to imagine just how and for how long she must practice to get that level of skill. In her video, Sadie helps you take your skill level up many notches too. She shows you her method and her way of practicing. Sadie takes up the layering and combining of movements that make belly dancing one of the most skill-powered dances in the world.

But right at the outset, I'll say that this is a very challenging video. It's actually meant to span learners of all levels and in a way it does. A chunk of this video instruction takes you through the foundational movements and the first of three levels of difficulty in each of the practice drills here are meant for the beginner belly dancer to work on. This is not a fitness or weight loss video, even if you can see how incredibly slim Sadie is. This is a video for someone who's serious about belly dancing and who wants to put in all the hard work needed to hard wire the brain and body to do complex moves seemingly instinctively. Not a fun and frilly party of a video, not an all-the-basics video either. I think of this DVD as the beginning of a journey into richly textured belly dancing.

Sadie begins her instruction with a technique section (one of two on this video) and takes up some foundational hip and pelvic moves. This is where the base moves that you will layer on or use in the layers, are taught or refreshed. But from this point on, you get into the realm of layering or teaching your brain and body to do different things at the same time. You walk with different hip move timings so that the hip and feet timings are different. This is done with the  shimmy on the up and down as well. You work with these to the music in short practice sessions. But wait, the drills haven't even begun yet!

The drills accompanying Technique 1 are in three difficulty levels - like all the six drill sets on this video. They involve layering drops and lifts on some of the foundation movements. This is the point from which the video begins to be unique. You then layer this on a walk. As the difficulty level increases, you now layer on compound movements. So, you may be layering small, precise hip lifts and drops on a circle. Next, timing variations, increases in speed, and doing moves on releve increase the difficulty level further. And if this weren't enough, you now may add half turns to this lot. So you're doing sharp hip drops/lifts layered on a circle while you're on your toes, you're varying the timing - and you're taking a half turn.

Moving on to the second technique section, we bring the rib cage into the layering picture. Keeping your hips going with moves in autopilot, you now learn to layer rib cage moves on top of that. That could be chest lifts and drops, diagonal or circular moves. And then, impossible as it may seem, you layer all this on footwork. This chunk is really challenging. Drill set 4 combines the  shimmy with complex rib cage movements such as the rib cage triangle and rib cage vertical circle. And as is the pattern with these drills, we add the on-the-toes moves, changes in timing and traveling. Sadie also takes up the ""semiha"" or flat-ball step slide move and layers the  on that. She adds rib cage moves to that too. Finally, Drill set 6 works with hip squares. For layers, we have undulations and reverse undulations, pelvic drops and lifts - all coming together with hp squares and basic traveling around.
Threaded through the entire set of drills are short practice sessions with music.

And finally you can relax and watch a performance by Sadie - Egyptian with a Sadie twist.

If you're a beginner and plan on buying this video, make sure this isn't your only basics or drills video. As long as you're working with easier ones that focus more comprehensively on the basics, you can take up this one to start teaching your brain how to do different dance movements at the same time. If you're an intermediate dancer, think about where you are in your drills journey right now. Again, if you have a ton of videos but haven't worked through any of the easier drill ones, you may not work with this tougher one yet. But, if you'd also like to work on some neglected hard wiring for layering and are ready to bring this instruction into your practice routine in chunks, it's not at all a bad idea. If you're an advanced dancer, this video will sharpen your percussive movements no end.",1216944000,28,4751,4.515116279069767
8279607,5,B001ATDDYU,"Excellent focus on technique, not a fluff video.  I struggle to get through the intro.  Expect to invest some time to master the material in this disc.  I hope to sometime when I have more time to practice.  Sadie is one of the best performers, and her hip technique is worth learning regardless of what style of belly dance you perform.",1523836800,,337,4.475409836065574
8279608,5,B001ATDDYU,"These dvd provides several drills, gradually layering one movement on top of another. Sadie is an incredible dancer and instructor. This dvd will definitely challenge your coordination.",1473379200,,185,5.888888888888889
8279609,5,B001ATDDYU,"This video is wonderful. The layering is difficult only because one's brain and body aren't used to putting the moves together like that. It should just take practice to get them going smoothly (or sharply, as the case may be). Sadie does a very good job teaching and leading the drills. It's a little irritating that she has her back to the camera a lot which makes it difficult to follow her chest moves. Overall excellent video.",1296259200,,431,4.6103896103896105
8279610,5,B001ATDDYU,"The question everyone wants to know is, is this dvd really worth their hard earned $40.00. If you are serious about bellydancing yes. I did not want to buy a dvd over $20.00 my reasoning was if I'm taking classes I shouldn't have to buy a dvd that cost almost as much as a workshop. I could just go to workshops and regular classes. The problem with workshops and classes for that matter is you can't hit rewind and practice to your hearts delight. So it was with some caution and my instructors recommendation that I bought this dvd.
I loved the fact that there was a techniques section that drilled the basics thats right even the basics are drilled. Because I feel the basics should always be drilled, they can always be sharper and more fluid. Posture was covered as the opening to the first technique section
and you were reminded about posture throughtout the dvd which is wonderful my pelvic does not like to stay tucked.lol :)
The video has two technique sections and six related drills, the technique section just breaks down the moves to be used in the drills.
Each drill section has 3levels. This dvd is not for the faint at heart. This is not a beginners dvd and you will surely notice that as soon as the first drill begins. The first drill I tried left me dissappointed I couldn't get some of the moves so I went to sleep and tried again later much better. This dvd is clearly meant to train.
I love this dvd there are not many strictly drill dvd's. Pure Sadie style almost everything is layered even in the first drill. I will be using this for awhile I know everyone who uses this and practices will love the results they see. This dvd is a keeper and for me it was worth $40.00 based on the fact that it drilled more moves than about 4 of the dvd's I have. I would most certainly get one high priced dvd that improved my dancing than four low priced ones that covered only half.
The only thing I have a prolem with which seems to be a Sadie thing is she is not a big fan of arm and hand movements. She pretty much used to basic arms positions straight out, and shoulders back, elows slanted hands, framing the back side. If she had drill beautiful arm movements hands and gestures this would hands down be the best bellydance dvd released.
I also wished she had a drill section with different shimmies, SADIE tends to stick to the 3/4 shimmies in most of her works and I wanted to be exposed to more forms of shimmies. I wouldn't take a point off for that though because so much information was given on this one I have enough to work on :)",1236902400,10,2557,4.3180873180873185
8279611,5,B001ATDDYU,"Absolutely love this DVD. If you're looking for perfection and a dedicated instructor you can listen to on a weekly basis, buy it. I enjoyed this one far more than her Drum Solo Technique and Choreography. Sadie's personality and ability to break down the technique has grown inmensely. I'd recommend it to any intermediate or advanced level dancer. If you're a beginner, you could still practice parts of it as long as you're really patient with yourself, you don't expect instant results, and you pay close attention to all the instruction given. Another plus for Sadie is the constant attention given to posture all throughout the DVD. This drives home the point that you have to check yourself in the mirror constantly, not only for the move you're executing but everything else going on in your body.

Highly recommended.",1231977600,5,826,4.942446043165468
8279612,5,B001ATDDYU,"This dvd is wonderful to improve coordination, and noone can coordinate movements like Sadie does. Her pops and locks are so sharp that the music seems to come directly from her body!
Practically this dvd is divided into two parts:
- hip movements (pops and locks)
- torso movements
In the beginning the exercises are simple, but moving on they become more and more difficult.

I recommend this dvd for students of all levels, even if it's more suitable for intermediate and advanced bellydancers.  Well done Sadie!",1228867200,2,515,4.908045977011494
8279613,5,B001ATDDYU,"Not only is she a great dancer, but a great teacher as well!  She is very generous with information and doesn't give the impression that she is ""keeping secrets.""  She is obviously very secure!  IAMED Please keep producing dvd's with Sadie.  She is the new Suhalia!",1228089600,2,265,4.695652173913044
8279614,5,B001ATDDYU,"very good and clear instructions, a very good exercise tool to have and the layering skills are very good!!!",1223596800,2,108,4.7368421052631575
8279615,5,B001ATDDYU,"I think that in this DVD dancers of every level can find the way to improve their technique. I like control, the perfection of movements and the way to attain it: keep on practicing with Sadie.",1221523200,3,193,4.388888888888889
8279616,5,B001ATDDYU,"I'm so glad that I bought this dvd.  At first glance I thought that it was much simpler than I was hoping for.  But then as I started to actually do the workout I realized that Sadie just makes it look simple because she is so fantastic.  There is a lot of material here to learn.  I am still in the beginning segments and although Sadie explains everything clearly with plenty of time to get it down, it is a challenge to make these combinations and drills your own.  I have been going to classes for a few months now and I am so pleased to have this challenging dvd to continue my learning at home.  It really is a master class with Sadie.  She is a wonderful instructor, she explains and demonstrates everthing clearly and beautifully.  I think this will keep me busy for a long time and continue to be great to practice with.  I really recommend this dvd, it is worth the money!",1219536000,10,882,4.265060240963855
