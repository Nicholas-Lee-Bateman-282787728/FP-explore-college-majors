1763170,5,B00006I4X3,"Kari Anderson is a motivating instructor and gets right to the point.  It's a 20 min. workout with classic crunches, isometric moves and some back work at the end.  You'll really feel your abs burn - and just when you think you can't stand it, it's over.  There are well-deserved breaks (very short) in-between sets. There's also a short stretch at the end.  I liked this better than Tamilee's ""I Want Those Abs"" because of the short breaks.",1089849600,7,441,4.615384615384615
1763171,5,B00006I4X3,This video is great!  It is right to the point and gets the job done.  Kari is outstanding in both her instruction and on-camera personality.  She is a good motivator and can make small jokes without being annoying.  You will get a quality ab workout using both very traditional methods as well as more Pilates-inspired moves.  Each exercise transitions nicely without a lot of wasted time.  I have used a lot of other ab tapes and this one has them all beat.,1074470400,7,459,4.536585365853658
1763172,5,B00006I4X3,This IS the perfect ab workout because it is effective in only 20 minutes.  Kari does an excellent job of explaining all the abdominal muscles and preaches quality of form over quantity of excercises.  She also mixes it up by leading you through a large variety of moves without too many reps.  I alternate this ab workout every other day with a pilates inspired ab workout.  It really works well.  And its only a 20 minute investment!,1055116800,5,435,4.597402597402597
1763173,5,B00006I4X3,"ive been looking for a video which motivates me just like the gym to just do it and this is it. she gets right to the point.
she walks around the class and really focuses on your form.
its fast and the music is upbeat & motivating. in-between rests doing different ab work.  the video only being 20 minutes doesn't really matter its well worth it. before the video talks she talks briefly about the areas she is going to work on.
after the video ends everyone stretches out.
my main concern was my form being sacrificed.
but no matter what work-out video you do, you need to always focus on your form. no matter the pace. go at your own pace and rest if needed but never force yourself being your will jeopardize your form.
so if you love the whole gym/club-style work outs then this if for you.",1041552000,5,795,4.3
7969096,5,B00006I4X3,"How does Kari manage to be straight forward and creative in the same workout?  Well, she does.  It's solid, with no wasted minutes, effective, and Kari's cueing is, as always, wonderful. (Also, I appreciate some pops of color in the set, which was a pleasant surprise given the cover.)",1372377600,,285,4.795918367346939
7969097,5,B00006I4X3,This is the best out there for abs! Absolutely amazing exercises and I love Kari! Its also not long about 30 mins!,1344643200,,114,4.2272727272727275
7969098,5,B00006I4X3,This is the best ab workout you can get! She is a great instructor and her work out is effective. she also does bck workout for this who want a toner back. Love this dvd. my fav alone with jillian michaels 30day shred.,1332633600,2,218,4.093023255813954
7969099,5,B00006I4X3,"I bought this ab DVD a few years back for myself and have to say that I've never been disappointed with any of Kari Anderson's workout DVDs.  I always get the full benefits of whatever she teaches.  My daughter then asked me to purchase another for her to use while at college, as she's also familiar with the ab workout from using my DVD at home, so that just goes to show how we both enjoy it and like the results we have gotten from doing it.
Great ab workout all round!",1271203200,,473,4.130434782608695
7969100,3,B00006I4X3,I am sure the exercises on this DVD are effective but I just did not see myself doing them consistently. Ended up giving this to a friend,1246060800,,137,4.111111111111111
7969101,5,B00006I4X3,"I think most of Kari's workouts are some of the best, not only are they effective but you'll keep coming back for more.",1204588800,,119,4.217391304347826
7969102,5,B00006I4X3,"I love this dvd!! Kari Anderson has developed a challenging workout that targets every muscle in the abs. No matter what your level is, you can do this workout and feel great afterwards, not sore or tired. She shows you the basic moves that are great and then shows you how to progress as you get stronger. I just got out of the Marine Corps and this dvd is helping me to stay fit!",1176163200,15,381,4.162162162162162
7969103,5,B00006I4X3,"I've had this DVD for a while now, but lost it and after finding it again and doing it for the first time in ages, I appreciated all over again how good this is.  Kari is one of the best instructors out there.  She's great to listen to and cues exceptionally well.  You technically don't need to look at the TV screen to know what to do next - she describes everything so well.

This workout is all about the abs.  It is a great effective workout for your abs that is done in about 20 minutes and it doesn't mess around.  You get straight to the point (and the floor) and begin with pilates moves and basic ab moves that are proven to work.

If you have a bad back, flabby abs or want to kick up a notch in your usuall workouts, then this is for you.  She is such a professional and I love doing this.  Most dvds will do no more than about 10 minutes of abs (unless they are abs only workouts), but this is something extra then to incorporate into your daily routine.  I love it and highly recommend it.",1174953600,12,1003,4.071428571428571
7969104,4,B00006I4X3,"I don't quite know what I was expecting when I ordered Curl on Amazon - definitely something... diferent. And even though Kari's workout IS a good one for those abs, I don't quite feel like it's any different from those other GOOD abs routines (like the ones on The Firm videos). The truly short (maybe 5 second) breaks another rewievers mentioned come at the prefect times, though - every time I feel like I can't even breathe anymore.

What downright annoys me here is that every lady on this tape looks like a man (okay, except for one) and you can't skip watching them the first few times you're doing the routine.

So, it IS a good workout, Kari IS a true professional, I just didn't quite feel it stood out from the bunch of GOOD abs workout tapes.",1100131200,4,754,4.41726618705036
7969105,5,B00006I4X3,"I have a hard time finding an ab workout that really gives me the burn. I have very strong abs due to years of work outs. At first, I was so soft that even a light workout was more than I could stand. But the stomach muscles are fast to toughen up. But when they do, you need a tougher workout to get the results you want.

I found this workout excellent. I was burning two or three days later.

I did find, however, that I also used muscles in other areas such as ribs and back and I would have preferred the workout limited to the ab area. Perhaps I did some moves wrong.

The 20 minutes goes quickly. The instructor is good and it is a military style, which I like. You do need to watch the video a time or two to get acquainted with the workout because she doesn't really explain the positions too well as she goes along.

If you are advanced or if you are ready for a tougher ab workout, you've found it. This one is great for at least one day a week and perhaps two.

Highly recommended.
