8100435,1,B000CQM51O,"This video is awful.  Any stretching classes that I have taken are done a a slow pace as not to cause any injury.  Her ""warm up"" is done at such a fast pace it feels like exercise.  If you are looking for something like yoga without all the poses, as I was, this is NOT it.  The title should have definitely included the words excercise, not stretching!",1246579200,,353,4.223880597014926
8100436,5,B000CQM51O,"The title says it all. I find the narration and backround music very relaxing. I find the 'old fashioned' warm up refreshing. My husband - a former Marine - enjoys this video also as it reminds him of his calisthenics that he enjoys. The stretches are unique and effective, although I do agree with one of the other reviewers that there aren't many arm stretches. I like the no-nonsense approach of this video. It is not the least bit intimidating and I find it very easy to follow. I like it so much because it has introduced me to new stretches I've never done before.",1236124800,,570,4.438095238095238
8100437,1,B000CQM51O,"I borrowed this from my library & oohhh mmyyy gg.... This says 2005, but it's obviously a VERY bad copy of a VHS from who knows how long ago. The video is distorted from time & the sound quality is also a bit muffled. The menu is basic, just the 3 section choices.

This is done in someone's living room or looks like. The first thing I saw was Nancy doing headrolls.... Oh my g... I've never seen headrolls done so fast just goign side to side. She look like she was trying to give herself whiplash. I immediately realized she's still from the 1980s aerobic gym brainwashed ""do it until it hurts, as fast as possible & who cares if your joints cry foul from improper use."" Showing this to someone else, she grimaced & almost screamed herself from watching just those headrolls. Someone following this dvd is going to injure themselves.

I FFwd the rest which as the other reviewer said was all 1980s basic stretching that almost anyone knows how to do. Even on FFW it looked stiff & awkward.

I don't recommend this to anyone for any reason.",1175299200,,1042,4.416666666666667

I bought a series of 6 of Nancy's DVDs yesterday at a dollar store, so my expectations were low, but I figured that it was a relatively cheap way to keep up with my new years resolution to periodically try new exercise DVDs.

According to the sleeve, Nancy Marmorat is a 'tv exercise personality' who teaches dance, stretching and keep fit exercise routines. My intial impression of this dvd is that it is a low budget attempt to break into the world of mass-market exercise dvds in follow up to a presumably successful real life career as an instructor. I had never heard of her before, and found limited info on her and this DVD series when I searched online. My guess is that these DVDs, which were done back in 2001 (according to the sleeve), never really 'took off', which is how I ended up seeing them for sale at a dollar store.

Here are my thoughts on the DVD entitled ""Stretching"":

What I liked:
- Easy to follow (provided you don't have difficulty understanding British accents)
- The instructor never said a word the entire DVD - instead, it was narrated
- posture and positioning are emphasized by the narrator throughout (though I have some concerns about whether they are ""proper"")
- The instructor was visibly breathing, which stood as a reminder to me to do the same
- Even stretches for the hands and feet were included, which most other DVDs seem to exclude
- The instructor `shakes out' her arms and legs periodically
- There were stretches that felt like they were working muscles that had not been addressed by other DVDs that I've tried

What I didn't like:
- Some of the moves reminded me of the warm-up for the dance classes I took as a kid
- The warm-up section reminded me of elementary and middle school gym class
- Most of the the upper body stretches felt ineffective
- Transition betw some of the moves is awkward
- The sound quality isn't the best
- The ending of each of the three sections is abrupt, with poor transition
- At 50 mins, it is a bit long, but I don't plan to do the 8 min warm up ever again (the part that felt like gym class), or the relaxation portion (last 8 mins). That leaves roughly 35 remaining minutes of _just_ stretching which is still quite long, but much more ""do-able""

Overall opinion: I'm glad I got this at the dollar store, given the quality, but the content was good enough where I'll actually use this again (though not daily).

**Updated 4/18/07 - After doing this a few more times (""giving it a chance""), I decided that it's just not effective, nor does it have elements that make me feel inclined to do this again.  I would suggest that you put your money toward something else.",1138492800,,2678,4.486652977412731
