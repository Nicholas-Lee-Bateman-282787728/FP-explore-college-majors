8304294,3,B001G77R5C,"Occasional insight, for the most part this is attack 'journalism'. Focuses upon first responders to 9/11 who were breathing dirty air, lists their ailments.

Film maker goes after 2008 Presidential Candidates and asks questions about 9/11. Odd collection of people appear. Odd situations, swearing.

Makes the point that the buildings that fell on 9/11 appear to fall as if they were professionally demolished, weird. Occasionally disturbing. Provides no answers, at all.",1462147200,,471,5.619718309859155
8304295,3,B001G77R5C,"A doco of 9/11 activism well fueled by pinching cents on medical assistance to 9/11 indirect victims of world Islamism is filled with bitter speculations and expressions these unwitting heroes and their supporters express.

Baseless suggestions of a terror-act itself are being provided while this work itself is a real testimony to a bitter situation health-damaged money-short law-obedient citizens  -  9/11 employees found more recently themselves in.",1302739200,2,454,5.746268656716418
8304296,4,B001G77R5C,"If you're looking for Alex Jones to expose the lies that are in the 9/11 event, you've got the wrong DVD. This is about the group of activists demanding answers and protesting outside of important areas, being told they can't be there, etc. I personally was disappointed in the film because I was looking for Alex to lay out the lies. But if you're looking to see how others are getting involved, confronting politicians, being forced to leave, screamed at, etc. then you've come to the right place. I got more information in ""Terrorstorm"" by Alex Jones, which actually has him in it a lot more.",1284854400,2,595,4.622641509433962
8304297,4,B001G77R5C,"As time marches on and the New World order thrives off of the ignorance of many, the minority continues to press on and fight for truth, justice, and peace. This is a well-made documentary giving a brief overview of just how ignorant society is, as well as how easy it is for politicians and the media to throw lies this way and that, without being called on them. Most importantly, it covers the rising amount of awareness amongst citizens and the desire for knowledge.",1254787200,2,470,4.607142857142857
