2818109,5,B000PFUAP0,"I enjoyed seeing the last two Darkman movies.  I liked Liam Neeson quite well in the first one. However, the actor in the other two was satisfactory.",1238371200,,149,4.518518518518518
2818110,4,B000PFUAP0,I'm always happy when they do a decent job converting a comic book to video.  They did a fairly decent job with Darkman and the story is interesting to follow.  Glad I purchased this trilogy.,1233446400,,191,4.428571428571429
2818111,2,B000PFUAP0,"I vaguely remember seeing bits and pieces of the first Darkman movie several years before I purchased the box set. The movie intrigued me. I'm usually wary of comic book or superhero-esque movies, but in retrospect it well done. I've wanted to purchase this collection for years and I was excited to finally find it and buy it.

After watching the entire trilogy I must say that I was sorely mistaken. None of the movies are particularly well done, nor are they engaging. Darkman, while as interesting as he is conflicted, comes off as a bland one trick pony. All three movies play out the same way: Darkman has an enemy, he makes disguises to elude and foil the antagonists, and then he has a showdown with the big boss of their respective movies. Darkman never fails to come off as a poor man's mix of Batman and the Shadow in any of the three movies. The first installment of the series was the best, but it doesn't make up for the other two. The acting is bland, the plot is campy, and the action leaves much to be asked for. This, sadly, is a consitent trend in all three movies.

My biggest complaint lies in the last two movies. They not only appeared to be rushed, but it seemed as though the third movie used exact scenes from the second movie during the exposition. It was a tacky and unimaginative move on director's part.

I can't recommend this movie to anyone else unless you really like the Darkman series. He may be an interesting character, but this movie did not do him justice. Also, for all those who care, there's not much in terms of special features on any of the disks. Just three sub par movies.",1218672000,8,1620,4.429530201342282
2818112,5,B000PFUAP0,"Okay it's definatly lacking special features(It only contains trailers for the first two films Darkman and Darkman II(Disc 1,both are on the same dual layer disc,not dual sided mind you,that's a major plus,that means it has the label/artwork on one side and the program on the other!)Disc 3 on the other hand has NO features whatsoever just Darkman III,just the movie and no title screen no nothing!,but that's fine,it was the final and the weekest film in the series!!! Heck the reason I really bought this was actaully cheaper(i got mine for just $5.99 new at a retail store(wont tell the name)than the stand alone Darkman 1(the Sam Raimi directed one) movie!!! For the cut rate price might as well triple the deal for less dough,and it's housed in a nice regualar single size DVD case,so it takes minimal room on the bookshelf!!! A great deal for this great trilogy!!! Like I said before if you want a lot of extras,look elsewhere,If you want a great trilogy of films at a great price then look no further!!! Recommended!!!

2818113,4,B000PFUAP0,"Sam Raimi is one of the few directos who can make a crap film into a masterpiece case in point For Love Of The Game. Next to the Dead trilogy this my favorite Raimi film. The film has fast paced action, awe inspring cinematography and a everyman hero in the form of Liam Nesson. As for the sequels there just your standard direct to DVD fare.",1207008000,,342,4.196969696969697
2818114,5,B000PFUAP0,"Darkman is one of the few, truly unique characters you're ever going to find in any media, whether that be movies, books, comics, or cartoons. He's part Batman in his quest to fight crime and bring people to justice in reaction to his own victimization; part Phantom of the Opera in his rage against his disfigurement and freakishness and his deadly accurate skills in murder as well as disguise and in his ability to create and recreate his own underground world; part Hulk in his all-powerful, rage-fueled strength and part Bruce Banner in his scientific expertise; part Invisible Man in his bandaged, overcoated, hat-topped get-up and his ability to uncannily disappear; part The Question in his ability to ask the correct, very intelligent questions that lead him to see right through scams and dark plots and thereby take action to set things right. Like all these characters, he's terribly conflicted, ultimately good (at least when it truly counts in the first movie and nearly always in the second and third installments of his story), and he spends most of his time alone, outcast, and, to a great extent, within a self-imposed exile that is, in part, both shame and penance. As Sam Raimi, Darkman's creator has said, ""I decided to explore a man's soul. In the beginning, a sympathetic, sincere man. In the middle, a vengeful man committing heinous acts against his enemies. And in the end, a man full of self-hatred for what he's become, who must drift off into the night, into a world apart from everyone he knows and all the things he loves."" With this Franchise Collection, you get the entire three-film, movie franchise. (The only thing that hasn't been re-released is a thirty minute TV pilot.) With this, you'll see Darkman portrayed originally by Liam Neeson and then, in the last two films, by Arnold Vosloo (of Imhotep / Mummy & Mummy Returns fame). Both actors do a fine job. In the first film, simply titled Darkman, Liam Neeson perfectly portrays the wonderfully antic aspects of the character, including a truly scary but hilarious Tin-Man dance using a funnel for a hat that is a classic scene to this day. He is also much better than Vosloo at pulling off the cliche one-liners that somehow become verbally gory when he says them. Granted, Neeson had the benefit of being in a film that had a wonderfully brilliant, magician's bag full of dark-humor. I don't want to spoil the fun by giving out the details; each gag in this film is so good that you want the full effect of the surprise. Suffice it say that you've never seen a more lovable, pathos-inspiring character with such troubling behavior. And the ways in which Darkman carries out the murders of murderers redefines poetic justice. His arch-enemy, Robert G. Durant, is as dead-pan and cold-blooded as crimelord-assassins come. And Durant's goons have to be the best collections of villainous sidekicks ever created. And that's apparent in the first two minutes of this movie. The first Darkman is truly classic and is worth the price of the Franchise Collection alone. And everyone I've known who's seen the first film has felt 100% compelled to see the others. Darkman II:  The Return of Durant maintains some of the oddball humor, but it is found in the character of Durant rather than Darkman. And Louis Strack, Jr., the developer who originally called in Durant to kill Dr. Westlake, takes center stage in this film. The story becomes much more serious, and Vosloo brings out the human side of Darkman / Dr. Westlake so that the humor and one-liners are gone for the most part, but a much more truly heroic character emerges. The action here is still remarkable, and you'll love the new underground world that Darkman has erected. The third film, Darkman III:  Die, Darkman, Die is about how Darkman has a choice to finally become rehabilitated. The last installment of Darkman's story has seen him make significant human connections. And this film takes that even further, to the point where he truly has a chance at a relationship with a woman as well as a chance to have a daughter. In the end, he is compelled to do make a  wonderfully, heroic, loving, human choice. And that's what carries this film off. The villains here are just as memorable, Raimi still has a few gags up his sleeve, but he wants you too see inside Darkman's soul in this film and truly grasp the nature of the world in which he lives. As to practicalities, this 3-film collection is well worth the price. Check different retailers. I purchased it for approx. 14 dollars at the Mart on the wal, if you know what I mean. Others sell it cheaper than I see it here, also. There are no inserts or frills or special features. Not even scene selection. But I've purchased an original copy of the dvd, and there are none there either. Not even scene selection. So, you get everything here, minus original covers. As to the R rating, it's for bad language and nothing else. And the film starts right off with the ""F"" word. That being said, after explaining the presence of the vile verbals, I have let my children see all of these films. Because they are simply that good. These films have truly heart-rending and heart-warming scenes, and there's no better films for explaining justice and heroism. Go get your Darkman before this thing goes out of print.",1200787200,27,5313,4.7478354978354975
2818115,3,B000PFUAP0,"This 3 in 1 pack basically has the first two movies in one disk with their repective trailers and on the second disk the third film (no menu, no trailer just the film).  The image on all three films has been restored. Now how good, well I don't see any tape deterioration and the sound is pretty crisp, but I do not own a widescreen TV or surround soundsystem.  Now If you like Raimi his style then what Darkman offers you is that in spades, so its worth picking up in that sense...

  Now the only thing I am not sure about is weather or not parts 2 and 3 have been cut somehow...

  But with all that said I must add that in Raimi's absence the new director seems to copy his style rather well.  And in some way I like Vooslo more than Neason as Payton Westlake not because he is more 'believable' but rather because he seems more fit for the action sequences and seems like he has a darker presence. (Oh the puns...)

As an update the image on D3 seems to be shaky in the beginning when dark man first enters the layer and gets a new mask out, the image shakes for a the few seconds the shot takes place, now weather this is just my copy or all of them is anybody's guess, but for $15 at CRTCity still a semi decent deal overall ratin for DVD 2 & 3/4 stars",1192838400,8,1259,4.040322580645161

2818171,3,B000PFUAP0,"First off, I would like to state that there is no bigger Darkman fan than me. But even I have to admit that this ""Trilogy"" pack is flawed.

It actually has less features than the individual DVDs of the films. The first disc contains Darkman and Darkman II, as well as the trailers for each. The filmographies and production notes from the earlier releases are missing. The second disc has Darkman III on it, but inexplicably has no features at all--no scene selection, languages, not even a menu! If not for the fact that I bought this new, I'd probably suspect that it was a bootleg.

The quality of the picture is good but not great on all three movies.

In all honesty, it's an affront to fans that, when a franchise collection was finally released, it is actually worth less than the individual releases. The only reason this gets 3 stars is on the strength of the first film, and the passable quality of the second and third. If you absolutely can't find the separate DVDs, you might get this (if only to save space and/or money). But any Darkman diehard will want to stick with their old copies until something better comes along.",1325548800,5,1136,4.53170731707317
2818172,4,B000PFUAP0,"Darkman II was the first Darkman movie I ever saw when I was a kid (on HBO I believe?). In the years since, I have seen all three either on TV and/or a VHS rental. Back in 2008 or 2009, I was walking by the electronic department in Wal-Mart when the trilogy caught my eye in the stand. And for a mere $9 at that. Of course, the box set contains all three movies.

What are these movies about, you may ask? Well the movie's main character is a scientist by the name of Peyton Westlake (Liam Neeson in the first, Arnold Vosloo in the sequels) who is working on a revolutionary severe burn related project. Specifically, synthetic skin that completely covers up any burn wound and remains on the person like it's real skin to the point no one can tell the difference.

In the first movie, his girlfriend is a reporter who unfortunately gets on the bad side of a local mob boss, Robert Durant. Durant tracks down a piece of paper he wants to Westlake's lab where the girlfriend forgot it. Durant ultimately has the lab blown up and (thinking) Westlake killed. In reality, the blast blew him from his lab and only severely burned him over most his body.

Westlake is able to break free from his hospital--where his nerves were removed leaving his brain to feed off adrenaline and his body to increase his strength and unfortunately more or less uncontrollable rage--and re-establish his lab to continue his work.

Westlake takes it upon himself to take down Durant in the first two and a businessman who is secretly a drug dealing mob boss.

To do this, Westlake, as his new identity Darkman, can literally look and sound like anyone thanks to his skin project and ability to alter his voice.

All in all, I do really enjoy these (the third, not as much as the first two but...). They're not the greatest movies ever don't get me wrong but still enjoyable enough if you're looking for a straight-on superhero or action movie. Me? I'd say the franchise as a whole is a favorite of mine.

As for Special Features, unfortunately there are none. None at all. I wish they had at least put in the theatrical trailers or something.

Now, the actors. Larry Drakeman is great as the antagonist mob boss Robert Durant. The villain in Die Darkman Die, well, honestly, it was well enough but I don't think you'll find much talk about the character or his performance. Darkman himself? Honestly, I feel that Liam Neeson did a MUCH better job at playing Darkman than Arnold Vosloo. He got the ""uncontrollable rage"" aspect of the character done much better. Not that Arnold Vosloo was horrible or anything. Only I liked Liam Neeson better.

The last thing I wanted to mention doesn't really have anything to do with anything. One interesting thing to note is that originally, the sequel order was going to be swapped. Meaning that the Return of Durant was originally meant to be the third movie and Die Darkman Die was going to be Darkman 2. Honestly, I wish they had done it that way. I would have preferred the final movie to be Darkman vs Durant considering their history. I hear it changed because Larry Drakeman's schedule became opened. Oh well, what can you do though.

All in all, perhaps not the best but still fairly decent movies.",1302652800,2,3221,4.566724436741768

But if you're looking forward to the exact same level of the original film, I recommend you avoid this set and just stick to the original one. I'm not a remake fan, but this set made me wonder how they could have done Darkman with modern technology and a better budget. But I guess Darkman was such a memorable film because it was done with low budget and old technology. Anyhow, great set for all Darkman fans!",1241740800,,722,4.239130434782608

8191066,3,B000PFUAP0,"what can i say? sometimes something shouldn't work, but does.
i've mentioned more than once that i'm not (usually) thrilled with the ""dark knight"" version of Batman (as opposed to the more whimsical approach by Adam West), because he turned out to be such a blatant ripoff of The Shadow. maybe i should be just as scornful of Darkman, since his own Shadow lineage is even more readily apparent. for one thing, his trademark black-cloak-&-fedora ensemble can't help but recall the similar outfit, augmented with red scarf, through which the weed of crime was said to bear bitter fruit so many years before.
less obviously, his injuries echo one version of The Shadow. there were two Shadow continuities back in the day. on radio, there was Lamont Cranston, ""wealthy young man about town,"" who became The Shadow by rendering himself invisible via hypnosis. then there was the rather more intricate pulp-magazine series, in which, for instance, Cranston is but one of many pseudonyms for a character who's true identity is never officially established. (supposedly he was eventually identified as an ex-aviator named Kent Allard, but in fact even that is occasionally hinted to be just another subterfuge.) there are suggestions that the literary Shadow is similarly disfigured - ""maybe The Shadow ain't got no fact to speak of"" - and has devised a special face-rack which helps him disguise himself. so even the secret weapon which you'd think would bring Darkman into his own can be traced to this ancestor.
but then it was probably inevitable. the way i heard it, writer-director Sam Raimi had wanted to make a Shadow movie but been unable to secure the rights. so when he decided to devise his own superhero instead, it's not so surprising that said character would, consciously or not, come out in The Shadow's image.
in a more general sense, there's the fact that the film isn't exactly revolutionary. it came along a few years before superhero cinema became such a vogue, but the formula was still pretty well established in the comics. timing didn't do it much good either, since it came along a mere year after Tim Burton's so-so but ubiquitous Batman. after all, that was also the bane, a few years later, of The Shadow's own movie, starring Alec Baldwin. being the second greatest superhero movie ever (just behind Superman, as if you really had to ask) didn't keep that underrated gem from being dismissed as an attempt to ride Batman's coattails. (little did so many guess, alas, that it was in fact the other way around.)
the point is, there are no few reasons why Darkman should've been a colossal dud. so why wasn't it? how did the most familiar and obvious plot device in the world, on top of a character with so obvious a lineage to a specific established property, result in such a spellbinding thrill-ride? how did something so clearly straight off the rack manage to so favorably foreshadow Raimi's suitability to helm the Spider-Man movies a little over a decade later?
the obvious answer, that sometimes the elements line up agreeably to create ""magic,"" is admittedly a rather half-assed cliche, but let's face it: it's the closest thing there is to a tangible explanation.
no small asset is Liam Neeson, a fabulous actor just on the threshold of his greatest fame. he brings much affability and intelligence to Darkman-to-be Dr. Peyton Westlake, and falls gracefully over the edge upon becoming the titular outcast. in fact, i don't think i've ever seen any other cinematic superhero descend so artfully into his dark side as does Neeson's Dr. Westlake. where similar characters are usually redeemed and forgiven, Westlake actually comes to terms with being a freak. ""i can live with it,"" he explains, ""but i don't think anyone else could.""
also noteworthy is how simple it was to bring a new dimension to the well-worn master-of-disguise gimmick that serves as his secret weapon. a scientist who's been seeking a reliable artificial skin, he's been reasonably successful, but he can't make it last more than 100 minutes. so he can create a more believable facade of someone else than was ever possible before, but only has so much time to use it.
the film is so fully rounded, in fact, that it feels quite epic despite it's comparatively breezy 95 1/2 minute runtime. i'm reminded of how Bryan Singer's first X-Men film, clocking in at an hour and 44 minutes, was criticized by some for being ""too short."" but this isn't The Godfather or Lord Of The Rings. if you can get what you need done in so brief a time, the sake of runtime alone isn't a good reason to dawdle.
what holds this edition down to the 3-star level is the sequels. between the cookie-cutter nature of the concept, the loss of Liam Neeson, and the fact that they went straight to home video, you're no doubt already not expecting much. well, even for a bar set so low, they manage to be exceptionally bland.
the major weakness is Neeson's successor, one Arnold Visloo. (quite the name, huh?) Visloo has sinister ambiance out the wazoo, but lacks the everyman quality Neeson had brought. so his portrayal is just off-balance. he looks and feels so much like a villain, in fact, that it's easy to forget completely that he's the hero.
directorial duties are taken over by one Bradford May. Sam Raimi is simply ""executive producer,"" meaning he's still involved but in a less hands-on way.
you can tell we're in ""huh?"" territory from the imaginative subtitle of the second film, The Return Of Durant. the titular crimelord, played by Larry Drake (the only actor to appear in more than one of these films, by the way), resurfaces surprisingly intact. those with attention spans will recall that in the first film Durant's helicopter burst into flames upon crashing into a highway overpass. here, he awakens from what is described as a coma, only a facial scar or two the worse for wear. so either there's been some positively massive discoveries in medical science between the films, or Durant is from the planet Krypton. yet the bludgeoningly obvious question is never asked. the film goes out of it's way not to let anyone in Durant's vicinity wonder why going down in flames wasn't fatal or even damaging.
come to think of it, said medical revolution could've been the spearhead for a much more compelling story, so they missed more boats than one. as it happens, what we end up with is a strictly by-the-book revenge odyssey, stirring up Darkman's old rage when it turns out Durant didn't die after all.
as for episode 3, subtitled Die Darkman Die? let's just say you know something is in trouble when the best part is it's title.
this one makes a preposterous attempt to retcon the whole thing, suggesting that the attack upon Dr. Peyton Westlake came from somewhere else entirely. specifically, he was intended for use in experiments (or should i say vivisection) to determine how to tap into the hidden strength he would acquire after his disfigurement. apparently all that stuff about Louis Strack's unethical real-estate practices was pure coincidence that just happened to be going on at the same time. nor is it entirely clear why Westlake was specifically singled out.
so the bottom line is, forget all that noise and just buy Sam Raimi's original. it's a classic case of established formula at it's most masterly, which is more than can be said for it's descendants.
