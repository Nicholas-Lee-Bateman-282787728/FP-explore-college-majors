8689478,1,B00PVRQHMC,5-Movie Disaster Collection:is literally A MONUMENTAL DISASTER. They had to look long and hard to get a collection of the 5 worst movies ever made! I bought this collection on a whim and a 5 STAR rating! I wasn't familiar with any of the titles in this selection. Don't make the same mistake that I made. AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!,1423612800,4,336,4.524590163934426
8689479,2,B00PVRQHMC,"Edited review:
There really is 7.433333333 hours of movies on ONE disc; THAT isn't the problem with this
collection though; briefly:
The best two movies are ""Rapturesque"" Christian movies from, appropriately, FAITH FILMS:
*** ""THE APOCALYPSE"", 2007, 94-minutes, 2.35:1--- As an asteroid [the size of Texas] heads to-
ward The Earth, a divorced couple search for their daughter....bang; boom; crash; and find Jesus.
*** ""COUNTDOWN: ARMAGEDDON"", 2009, 93-min., 1.85:1, NON-ANAMORPHIC, so-called window-boxed movie ~(([{*}]))~
A non-Christian is unaware her daughter has been ""Raptured"", and, travels to The Holy-land looking
for her ""ex"" [and daughter{?}] at the end-times. She finds her husband's body, and Jesus, reuniting
with her ""lost"" daughter.
____________________________________________________________________________
The last three films are the least entertaining ones with the lowest production values, all three,
released by GREEN APPLE.
** ""POPULATION 2"", 2013, 82-min., 1.85:1--- The CGI fighter jet has NO after-burner residue,
but, the story [on the ground] IS, depressing, but interesting enough for popcorn and your
beverage of choice.

* ""DEFCON 2012"", 2009, 91-min., 4:3 aspect ratio--- [read product description]. This, supposedly,
is the end of the world, where a hand-full of pirates (one of which 'wears' a CGI-generated helmet
that doesn't q-u-i-t-e match his head movements) are wasting their time [and ours] exploring an,
obviously,real life, abandoned for demolition, shopping mall.
The backround music, and foregound dialogue, often, compete for which is more important.
Nothing IS important enough to waste 91 of your minutes on THIS! The music is often MORE
interesting.
The helmet is the m-o-s-t interesting aspect of the film.

* ""THE INVADERS: GENESIS"", 2011, 90-min., 1.85:1--- In a post-apocalyptic world, Officer Orwell
discovers that he is fighting FOR a deadly---and corrupt---system. Epilog after credits; Big woop!

These movies ARE available seperately, so the choices are:
1.) - Buy them seperately
2.) - Buy them in this compilation.
3.) - Avoid these ""disasters"" like the plague.
4.) - Read a ""Good""-book.
5.) - Find Jesus, just in case. Never know, you, too, may be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Left-Behind-Complete-Set-Series-1-12/dp/B00EK0H4JQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Left Behind Complete Set, Series 1-12</a>
