8667396,5,B00LOEHY1O,"I have used this movie to teach history courses that include sections on the Spanish Civil War for years. My old VHS version wore thin and I was happy to find this version. Warning: the Spanish to English subtitles in this version are NOT standard formal English. They are colloquial in the extreme. The cursing is literally revealed. If you believe this to be an issue (due to immaturity with the student audiences), then you need to know about this before you view it. I was caught by surprise. That being said, this film is outstanding in its direction, and the actor's realistic portrayals. The film moves you, through its raw energy and true passion. Maura's film takes you back to 1938 Spain, to witness the downfall, desperation and passion of the losing Republicans and the pettiness and cruelty of the soon to be victorious Nationalists. The portrayals are very realistic. A fine film for class.",1477008000,2,904,4.801282051282051
