6866198,5,B00QB4MRIC,"Just caught Heep in Akron, OH the other day and they rocked the sold-out gig. Mick Box and company still very much have it and they continue to deliver. 45 years into their career and no signs of slowing down. This blu is a perfect window into live Heep 2015. Personally, as someone who has very much enjoyed the last 3 studio records, I'm glad for all the new songs in the setlist. This means the band is still an active band and not just a nostalgia act. Yes, Bernie Shaw is not David Byron, but he has been the vocalist for the band since 1988 so his singing shouldn't be a surprise to any true fan. Long live the Heep!",1425945600,7,622,4.148760330578512
6866199,2,B00QB4MRIC,"First of all, Mick Box is the only original member here. All the other members are not documented at all as members of any of the albums that have charted, even up to 1983. What's more, more than three quarters of this collection of songs are totally unfamiliar, meaning that they are not on any of the 15 Billboard charted albums from 1970 through to 1983. I understand this band was more successful outside of the US, probably with the line-up that exists today, but for the classic Uriah Heep fan, this band and it's performance, just isn't what I wanted to hear. Perhaps, I should have done more research on what Uriah Heep is all about today.

So, this is hardly a Uriah Heep concert at all. Yes, I know the original band was together like 45 years ago, but I don't know. All this unfamiliarity, and only a few songs that I know, from a band that is mostly NOT the original band. Even the songs that we expect to hear from Uriah Heep, just don't sound very good. It doesn't have that wonderfully haunting original feel.  David Byron, the original vocalist,  just isn't here, and you can feel it. I'm gonna have to take this Blu-Ray back to exchange for something else. I am just not impressed at all.

Mick Box, the only original member, and basically just one guitarist, would have shown more dignity for himself if he just let himself refer to his new band as maybe ""You Ride a Jeep"" instead of continuing to use the name of the original respectable rock band from the past that this new band clearly does not represent very well. Perhaps, they should have performed only the material that these newer members are all associated with, and just forget about the music of the original classic line-up.  I'm sure that it would still sell, since the newer Uriah Heep does have a loving audience, but then, people like me, who still just live in the past, could have saved his fifteen bucks and put it towards something else.

I'd appreciate them more if they were just some old dinosaur rock band that no one has ever heard of, trying to reach out to an elderly audience, because I would certainly appreciate their effort, but to call themselves today's Uriah Heep, is almost an insult to the authenticity of the original band.",1425686400,,2230,4.521091811414392
6866200,2,B00QB4MRIC,"I wanted to like this one.  Lack of DTS was not an issue for me, just put it on multi-channel.  I bought it because of the older songs (Gypsy, July morning, Look at yourself, traveler In Time, etc).  Bernie Shaw cannot sing David Byron's songs. Not saying he is a bad singer, he just did not put the emotion and vocal restraint that Byron had. He ruined it for me, just screaming out the lyrics, on 10 all the time with no dynamics.",1425686400,3,432,4.180722891566265
6866201,1,B00QB4MRIC,"Don't buy if your expecting a good surround sound disc. What a piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!! I guess I should have checked closer. In this day and age, a concert recorded in 2014 on Blu-ray should at least be 5.1, if not 7.1 being a Blu-ray. Well this piece of junk is in 2.0 stereo (hey, it's the 21 century guys). At setup, no DTS HD Master Audio 5.1. Is Uriah Heep that broke that they couldn't hire a real audio company? The first few seconds of the first song looked great, but after checking again in audio setup for something better then 2.0, I stopped it. To say I was disappointed is an understatement, I was so piss that they couldn't do it right, I threw it away. Not wasting my time. I own many Blu-ray concerts, B-R audio discs, DVD-audio, and SACD discs. Sorry to see UH is still stuck in the 70's audio wise. Being a fan since the early 70's, I was really looking forward to their music recorded in surround sound...........",1425340800,4,934,4.3428571428571425

8691004,4,B00QB4MRIC,"First off, right now Amazon is showing this as a region B Blu-ray. knowing Amazons recent history of screwing up regarding these regions I ordered the disc anyway, & sure enough its a NTCS all regions disc & plays just fine here.
  Regarding the concert, I'm sure any Heep fan will enjoy it. Mick Box is a pleasure to watch. It looks like hes enjoying himself so much. Could have been 5 stars but stereo only in a show from 2014 is a little primitive.",1458864000,,451,4.294117647058823
8691005,5,B00QB4MRIC,"Mick Box still shreds like a madman, and the new drummer is incredible.  No Ken Hensley or David Byron, of course, but it's great to see Uriah Heep still going strong.  The music holds up.  Too bad there's no surround sound mix, though.",1457136000,2,236,4.441860465116279
8691006,5,B00QB4MRIC,I'm a fan of this group. Always hard-rock music with great singers and guitar players. A great concert of one of the best har-rock groups. The blu-ray arrives just in time. Perfect job. Thank you. Ablio,1450224000,,202,4.638888888888889

8691011,3,B00QB4MRIC,The music was 5 stars. I thought Bernie Shaw went overboard with trying to impress me. He was good but it would've been better for me if he would tone it down,1429488000,,158,3.96875
