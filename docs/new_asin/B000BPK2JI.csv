2435620,1,B000BPK2JI,"All your post-Vietnam clich&eacute;s are found right here.  The Vietnam vets who have given up on the world.  They even still wear their Army fatigues.  I know these guys are poor, but can't they afford to buy at least one other set of clothes in 35 years?  The traumatic flashbacks (are there any other kind?).  The vets' mental, physical and emotional problems.  Then, as if the totally overworked psycho-vet genre weren't enough, the movie slaps an after-school special plot on top, in the form of the totally overworked perky-child-changes-gruff-old-man genre, and we get plenty of touching moments as Danny Glover's young charge changes the grouchy old reprobate into a caring human being, but apparently not one who cares enough to stop his young charge from playing around IEDs.

Great actors were wasted.  The young girl Lenny stole the show, although the actress' name vs. her ethnicity left me somewhat perplexed.

It was great to see Linda Hamilton again.  I kept expecting her to pick up a shotgun, cock it one-handed, and scream at Danny Glover ""MOVE, soldier!""*

Danny Glover gave a solid performance, but in a movie like this, that'll only go so far.  He'd better hope for Lethal Weapon V to revive his fortunes.  At one point near the end of the film he tells Linda Hamilton: ""Everything I touch turns to [...].""  Danny, after seeing this movie, I couldn't agree with you more.

*  I recognize that I am combining two different scenes, one from ""The Terminator"" and one from ""T2: Judgment Day.""",1137196800,4,1510,4.862745098039215

The only thing I didn't like about the movie was that the little girl had to die in the movie. I really believe that she could had lived and it wouldn't had made the movie better.

Why did the little girl had to die? What was the purpose? It didn't do anything but turned the movie into a darker film. Those Viet Veterans have a hard enough time as is and to kill off some one that gives them some smal piece of happiness really sucks.

If the girl would had lived, then it could had gone on as a happy ending.  I could see the jack and girl live happy together with the store owner. Also, the other Veterans would get along better now with each other because of the little girl.

This movie can be a useful tool for anyone who is struggling with the after effects of trauma.

2435649,1,B000BPK2JI,"This movie is an example of what happens when you depend on the entertainment industry for your history lessons.  The person that wrote this script picked up every stereotype and myth about Viet Nam and Viet Nam veterans and wove it into the story.

I guess you have to keep in mind that even when this industry tries to do factual stories they resort to the phrase 'based on' to excuse their careless handling of facts - in this case they have a 'based-on' 'based-on' movie.

I'm amazed that any actor, actress, or director could have read this script and agreed to perform such trash.

The idea that the woods are full of poor, crazed Viet Nam veterans - suffering from the trauma of killing children in Viet Nam is just silly.

It's a fact (check the 2000 census) that while 10% of the population live below the poverty line - only 5% of veterans do.",1164499200,2,853,4.4423076923076925
2435650,4,B000BPK2JI,"****

This is a special film that I would recommend for adults. It is about the difficult recovery of the Vietnam veteran community in a rural area of the Pacific Northwest. They live isolated and impoverished lives, trapped in the past. When one of them, played by Danny Glover, takes care of a friend's young daughter, everything changes, and not only does Danny Glover's character begin to learn to love again, but the entire community comes closer.

I would not recommend this film for children, because I think that the adult themes of war recovery, war trauma, and intense grief would be too much for them; probably over 18 would be best for this film. It is not depressing, as you might think reading the synopsis, but is an inspirational film about interdependency, love, and forgiveness. It is not a ""happy"" film either, though. I would best call it a deep, poignant, and intense film that is an excellent use of the viewer's time. It would be good for an evening when you want to be moved and drawn into something to forget about your own problems or to help you deal with your own grief.

The acting is remarkable, the scenery lovely, and the young actress---Zoe Weizenbaum---who plays the friend's daughter---is perfect for her role. Danny Glover is marvelous, as is Linda Hamilton. An unlikely grouping of actors in a gem of a movie. You won't regret watching it.

Good actors make you believe in the character they are playing, but when they become political lightning rods it becomes more difficult to ever identify with a character they play.

 And at first he frets alot with her- also predictable - and then through time he grows to what I can only say is appreciate her - (predictable)- see where i'm going ?

I was so deeply moved by the characters who were vividly represented as the plot progressed. The last few scenes left me reaching for the tissue box again and again. While I originally thought it was going to be yet another predictible vet story, I was extremely pleased and surprised to see that FINALLY the screenwriters of this movie had the sense to through in a few twists. I never could have guessed the twists and turns that unfolded, it is pure brilliance on part of the writers.

2435669,3,B000BPK2JI,"""Missing in America,"" a 2005 Danny Glover vehicle now available on DVD and video, is yet another remake of Jackie Gleason's masterpiece, Gigot, but the twist this time is that the reluctant father figure, played by Glover, is a Viet-Nam vet haunted by memories and guilt and hiding out in the woods of the Pacific Northwest.  If you have seen the original, or 2004's ""Wool Cap"" (which was much better), you know the setup.  A crusty loner is suddenly saddled with an irresistibly cute little girl who melts his heart, redeems his soul, and brings him out of the shadows and back into the world of the living.  The formula worked in Gigot; it worked in Wool Cap.  Here, however, it just doesn't quite make it.

A significant part of the problem is that this version of the time-worn tale replaces the original's war-torn setting (and Wool Cap's more believable hardscrabble ghetto) with a loose community of Viet vets all on a permanent hermit campout in the woods and hills of the Cascades.  While, if the liner notes are to be believed, there may be some actual basis for this backdrop, that fact is never established in any credible way by the screenplay.  Thus, when the vets come shyly creeping out of the woods, they resemble nothing so much as hippie Munchkins coaxed from behind flowers and potted palms by Glenda's soothing promptings.  Beyond this, where Gigot's little girl was a war orphan and Wool Cap's version was unintentionally abandoned by a drug-crazed, junkie mother, Glover's unexpected ward is intentionally dropped off by a father who knows he is going to die in a matter of days from lung cancer.  But if any of the care and concern shown by David Strathairn as the girl's father were real, he'd have found SOMEPLACE better, SOMEONE better to entrust with his precious daughter's future.  Unfortunately, the resulting set-up is so artificial that it ruins much of what follows.

And what follows is by now all too predictable.  Scratching at soil long ago deeply mined by not only its two predecessors, but also by efforts from The Odd Couple to Kitchen Stories, the two improbable roommates clash, gash and gnash their way to an inevitable modus vivendi and blossoming harmony.

The one unexpectedly original twist of this version, however, in many ways seals the film's fate.  For unlike the predecessor movies, in this version the sweet young child comes to an unexpectedly sad end.  The problem is that this essentially leaves the movie far from over, but without an ending.  To compensate, the film lurches forward like a zombie, with little sense of purpose, direction or logic until a final oddly anticlimactic scene at The Wall in Washington.

The film's failures are all the more regrettable because the cast turns in, for the most part, believable, moving and memorable performances.  As the vet-turned-recluse, Glover is excellent, even if at several points he actually looks as though he half expects Mel Gibson to come popping out from behind a chair.  Linda Hamilton makes a rare appearance as Glover's erstwhile friend and grocery store proprietor, and the new maturity of her features lends a quiet credibility to her gritty portrayal.  In an interesting bit of casting (although they never appear on screen together), Hamilton's ""Beauty and the Beast"" co-star, Ron Perlman, has three short appearances, his face once again covered by disfiguring make-up, but his presence powerful and significant nonetheless.  Regrettably, the one weak link in the acting was turned in by young Zo Weizebaum as the story's central character.  While she IS as cute and endearing as all get out, she does not (yet) have the acting chops to pull off this role, and the level of her performance was, more often than not, strictly grammar school production.

From the moment Glover's fellow vets are introduced, it is clear that the theme of this film is going to be America's greatest shame, its forgotten soldiers of Viet-Nam.  Moreover, it is equally clear that this is a subject about which the screenwriter, the director and the cast feel very, very deeply.  The story they wanted to tell was one of hope, redemption, acceptance and forgiveness.  Sadly, almost none of this comes through in this flawed film, and THAT is a shame.  The vets deserve better...and so does the audience.",1140566400,7,4306,4.911602209944752

2435671,3,B000BPK2JI,"The tolls of the horrors of war, in this case, the Vietnam conflict shroud this darkly entertaining movie.  Danny Glover gives a terrific performance as Jake Nealy, a Vietnam vet who has sequestered himself from the world and relationships.  Oscar nominee David Strathairn turns up as Jake's old war buddy, Harry, who has his young daughter with him, newcomer Zoe Weisenbaum, who happens to be the offspring of Harry's Vietnamese wife.  The mother has passed on and soon we find that Harry has incurable lung cancer.  Harry disappears leaving young Linny in Glover's reluctant care.  Harry also becomes involved with a group of fellow vets who are living in the nearby woods, giving them supplies in exchange for firewood.  One of these is Ron Perlman, in a nonspeaking role, who was disfigured when a young Vietcong girl threw a grenade in his face.

Linda Hamilton joins her former BEAUTY AND THE BEAST star as the lovely widow who runs the local convenience store and takes immediately to the child.

MISSING IN AMERICA is sincere in its intent and the performances are uniformly fine.

8090694,4,B000BPK2JI,"...it reveals what became of some Vietnam vets after they came home. It's also somewhat moving and definitely memorable.

Released in 2005, ""Missing in America"" tells the story of a haunted Vietnam vet, Jake Neeley (Danny Glover), who lives in exile in the forests of the Great Northwest. He has a decent cabin-like abode but there are other vets in the area who are more mentally disturbed and live in primitive conditions (Ron Perlman). A vet buddy (David Strathairn) stops by and leaves a ""present"", his pre-teen Amerasian daughter (Zoe Weizenbaum). Jake objects, but has no choice but to accept the situation. Meanwhile, a local store-owner (Linda Hamilton) takes interest in Jake and his unwanted ""daughter"".

The story's realistic and moderately interesting, but one part will tick most viewers off, like it did me. Regardless, the film made me read-up on vets who to-all-intents-and-purposes are ""missing in America,"" like Perlman's character, etc., and I was shocked to discover that this aspect of the film was based on real life.

I found myself thinking about certain elements of the film days (and months) later. The movie is very successful in this regard.

What a huge mistake the Vietnam war was for America -- hundreds of thousands of lives negatively affected -- the dead, maimed, scarred, haunted and grieving.

Thankfully, something good can come forth despite the bad.

The film runs 102 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver area, with some scenes at the Vietnam Memorial in D.C.
