8503676,4,B006RXD2EU,"I've seen a few negative reviews on other sites about this video.  I bought it anyway, as I loved TL from her Firm days.  I'm glad I didn't listen to those reviews, and frankly, I don't think those reviewers were doing the moves properly. I got a very good work out.  I exercise a lot, so my rear wasn't totally sore, but I felt my glutes during the work out.  As with any work out, you have to listen for cues and constantly check form.  I think this was a really good work out and will remain in my rotation.  Thanks TL!!",1465776000,3,523,4.078431372549019
8503677,5,B006RXD2EU,I love her workouts. They are always challenging enough and varied enough to keep me interested.,1423353600,,96,5.0625
8503678,4,B006RXD2EU,"My name is Angela, I just love this workout with all this new movements, I'm only wish to be a little more slow so I can concentrate in the moves, I feel to much out of air and because takes lots of balance I make the movements sloppy. At the beginning my movements are very nice but by the middle I can't do it well and this is a big risk for injury. If I am Tracy I'll do this DVD again with a slower music and may be the option of working with a barre or chair.",1390348800,5,464,3.7448979591836733
8503679,5,B006RXD2EU,effort required on a couple of these exercises ; the bending over part is the most trying. But it does target what it was made for.,1368662400,5,131,4.076923076923077
8503680,5,B006RXD2EU,Excellent it targets just what it was created for some effort needed at points it will grip the booty. Try it,1368662400,2,109,4.238095238095238
8503681,5,B006RXD2EU,"Actually, large hips are not an issue with me, arthritis is. After I was diagnosed as having it in one hip and physical therapy was recommended -- something I have no time for--I found this workout and added it to my routine. The improvement was immediate. I highly recommend this workout to anyone who needs better hip flexation, and recent articles on athletic injury indicate that is a lot of us.  As far as the work out itself, it is bold, and requires concentration to maintain proper form. All pluses in my book.",1336262400,16,518,4.56989247311828
