7806665,3,6300238571,"Interesting primarily as an early appearance of Klaus Kinski. Like many early European Westerns, this is pretty bad. It actually featured a 1700's European stagecoach, which was totally out of place in the old West. The Mexican characters were all played by Northern Europeans, with atrocious fake-Mexican accents. The American characters all had deep-South accents that were more Mississippi than Western. (I am sure they were all dubbed.)",1432339200,,440,5.485294117647059
7806666,4,6300238571,"'Rough Justice' is a hard-to-find spaghetti western directed by the relatively unknown Mario Costa. [NB on Costa: is almost unknown to the genre since he only has one other film to his credit. 'Rough Justice' is assumed to be an Italian or Italian-Spanish co-production since it has more of the 'Gespacho' flavor of a Spanish western than a spaghetti] The plot is fairly simple: Kinski plays an inept sex fiend trying to bed every female he sees without success, and of course the usual plot vehicle regarding a large sum of cash [protected by an innocent farmer] and a few more villains thrown in to boot is obligatory in this type of low-budget western. Even though the story is a simple one Costa manages to muddy the waters and some inept editing loses the viewer in a myriad of sub-plots early on in the viewing. Perhaps the reader is asking: why the four star rating? Because this movie represents one of the finest performances ever by Klaus Kinski!  No matter how inept the editing and direction, Kinski commands the screen with urgency and meaning in every scene in which he appears, and unlike some of his other ""starring"" roles, Kinski genuinely commands a large portion of screen time in 'Justice'.  In fact, Kinski simply carries this movie entirely by measure of his considerable talent and tremendous depth of character.  Even more striking, Kinski has assumed that weird southern accent characterised in some of his other westerns. But the viewer feels Kinski's facial expressions and presence in 'Justice' with such impact that it is almost a shame Kinski ever opened his mouth in the film. [The former observation is close to the impact Eastwood had in Leone's dollars trilogy.] Unfortunately the only known video copies date from 1987 and the film is in need of restoration and preservation in it's original format. If only some far-sighted millionaire with the capability of apptreciating this form of art could come forward then we might find salvation, but alas those with the means seem incapable of seeing the fine art that existed deep down in these films. And maybe there is some form of societal 'justice' there?  A tremendous irony! For those viewers who appreciate the depth and complexity of Kinski and the menace and sadness that he manages to combine and convey about the state of the human condition, then you will love this film - others should probably stay away.",1063843200,3,2398,4.870098039215686
