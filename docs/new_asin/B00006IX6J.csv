1778990,4,B00006IX6J,"This is a very relaxing video, only issue is there is a lot of prop use and no mention that they are needed on the cover.

Also kind of quick. Would be better if it had a review of the positions first and slowed down a bit.",1142294400,6,223,3.74468085106383
1778991,5,B00006IX6J,"This little gem has made bedtimes easier for the kids, and life a little less hectic for me. I see some of the ratings are a little low, saying it is boring... well, the speaker is calm... so if you're in it for a work-out, look elsewhere. If you want to get yourself in a calm, relaxed mood, this is the one for you.

Recently, a family member of mine was murdered. Nights before days in court, I couldn't sleep. This really helped me ease the stress of the day, and calmed me to where I wasn't so stressed out about facing the murderer in court & his family. I know most of you won't have that sort of stress going on in your life. But  if it worked for a worry-wart like me, I am sure it'll work for you :)",1135987200,53,709,3.9859154929577465
1778992,2,B00006IX6J,"I obtained this video several years ago, when I was looking for a shorter yoga workout to perform when I had less time (most of my other videos back then were in the 40-60 minutes range).  I also wanted something that was gentle and relaxing as opposed to a more ""power yoga"" style, so this Gaiam title--with instructor Suzanne Deason, who I like--seemed like it would fit the bill. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in this practice, which feels rushed rather than relaxing. Although Deason's voice is soothing and she cues well, she moves so quickly from pose to pose that there's little opportunity to enjoy the positions. Furthermore, the use of props only hinders and further complicates this practice--if the workout moved at a slower pace, the props would be a nice addition, allowing those with less flexibility to attain the poses, but because the transitions are so fast, I spent most of my time worrying about where the props were supposed to be positioned, leaving little time to relax in the poses. If you are looking for a short, relaxing yoga practice, there are much better alternatives out there, from Patricia Walden's PM Yoga to Barbara Benagh's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-for-Stress-Relief-With-The-Dalai-Lama/dp/B000ICLRKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga for Stress Relief (With The Dalai Lama)</a>, which has both shorter and longer segments.

One final note: although all of the videos in the Living Arts ""for beginners"" series are advertised as being 20 minutes, the times vary a bit; this practice is actually just under 17 minutes, making it both too fast and too short to get a full relaxation experience.",1130198400,10,1690,5.3977272727272725
1778993,3,B00006IX6J,"This video is very good if you don't have a lot of time and want to do a condensed but relaxing yoga session.  After doing this tape a few times, it prompted me to join a yoga class at my local park district, and now I've been practicing Yoga for 3 years.  I still use this tape when I'm pressed for time or when I miss a Yoga class even though I'm no longer a beginner.",1124236800,15,370,3.8552631578947367
1778994,3,B00006IX6J,"In my opinion, stress can best be relieved by a good workout, which you won't find in this DVD.  As a college student who practices yoga regularly, I have found that an hour of yoga or pilates helps me calm down and focus, and really helps in relieving pain from my back (where a lot of us carry stress).  So my suggestion is that even if you have a busy schedule, you need to make room for an hour of full-body workout which will make you break a sweat.  Look for yoga dvds that can provide this for you.

I guess what I am trying to say is that although the instructor is pretty good, and the dvd is concise and gets straight to the point, I don't agree with the product's claim that it will relieve stress.",1122768000,8,709,4.115942028985507
1778995,2,B00006IX6J,"The actual yoga practice on this DVD is beneficial but entirely too brief, in my opinion. the actual practice is only 20 minutes. The cover notes say there is a total of 1 hour and 5 minutes of content. The rest is an interview with Susan Deason and a ""how to"" section for using yoga props. This is a very mild practice and using the props is very easy and really doesn't require any extra help. I couldn't care less about an interview with Susan Deason.
The ""special edition"" DVD I bought was also supposed to include a 60 minute pilates workout with three 45 minute variations. If those on on this DVD, they didn't include a selection button on the DVD menu. A bit disappointing.",1084406400,82,681,4.412698412698413

I have anxiety and panic disorder, so I try to do the dvd to help myself calm down. It doesn't solve all my problems, but I do feel so relaxed and calm after finishing. It was definitely worth the purchase.

The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that sometimes I feel she moves too quickly from one pose to another. It feels a bit rushed and is distracting. I own another gaiam yoga dvd which is also like this. Maybe to cram it all in in only 20 minutes? Either way it is a great dvd and good for beginners",1420243200,2,681,4.044444444444444

1779033,5,B00006IX6J,"The ""Yoga Practice"" part is a perfect way to unwind if you don't have much time to spare.  The second part which shows how to use the props has served me well when I had a problem with my balance and couldn't do my usual hour-and-a-half yoga routine. I chose the restorative poses which I was most comfortable with and did them in my own pace. Otherwise, the intervals from one pose to another were too fast to get the right restorative or relaxing result.

Over all, a very good way to pause during those times of stress and fatigue.",1350864000,,534,4.33

It is not only hard to locate on the website, but is disappeared after 4 months.  I'll be more careful next time I order and made sure I never use the video on demand aspect of Amazon.

1779035,5,B00006IX6J,"Note: This DVD comes in at least 3 different packages, but the content is EXACTLY the same in all of them (this was confusing to me, especially since one lists Patricia Walden as an actor, which she is NOT, and lists a location other than Hawaii, which is also incorrect.) The other cover, in addition to the two shown in this listing, can be seen here:

REVIEW:
Contains a 20 minute stress relief practice. It moves quickly. It is not the most strenuous practice but does require a decent amount of forward bending flexibility. Garundasana (eagle) is arms only, but if you know the pose you can add the legs. I have done and taught yoga for many years and I still find this routine relaxing (but not taxing). Is it the hardest yoga routine ever? no. Will it make you look cut and buff like a body builder? no. But it is relaxing and soothing, as promised. If you want a longer practice, pause the DVD and hold the poses longer.

Also included is a short restorative practice. Many people who have not tried restorative yoga dismiss it, but reclining in specific supported positions can actually help calm the mind and ease fatigue. The poses presented here are good ones. If you have never tried restorative, you can see what it is like here.

A NEGATIVE: The quality of these DVDs is not high def. On my 27"" computer screen they are banded and pixelated when watching full screen. I suspect they were made from the original VHS tapes.
This is not the biggest deal, because they are to DO the practice, not to sit and watch like a movie, but I thought since they keep issuing new editions the technical quality would keep up with the times.

It seems a bit disingenuous for Gaim to keep issuing the same material, without any improvement in quality, every few years with a different cover. I have 2 sitting on my desk right now because from the descriptions I thought they were different content. So, if you were wondering whether to get ""Stress Relief Yoga"" with Suzanne Deason or ""Yoga for Stress Relief"" wonder no more: they are the exact same content. Get whichever is cheaper!",1331942400,,2205,4.8563829787234045
1779036,5,B00006IX6J,"This video is a Godsend. If you are looking for a feasible 20 minute yoga practice to fit into your morning and/or evening schedule, buy it! I try to do this practice each morning before I go to work and deal with 5th and 6th grade special education students! It is obvious to me that my days run smoother the days I do this practice compared to the days I skip practice.  So if I want things to roll off my back, then I must put in the 20 minute a.m. practice. It works for me; I am on my 2nd disc. As other reviews have stated it is an easy level of yoga; good for a beginner or more advanced practicioner as myself who wants a calming peaceful practice. I highly recommend.",1314489600,,676,4.082706766917293
1779037,5,B00006IX6J,"This is an excellent 15-20 minute all around stretch to squeeze in before work or at the end of a workout to cool down. I have been having problems with neck pain and sciatica from sitting at a computer all day at work and went to the library to find some ""try before I buy"" DVD's of yoga, pilates, or stretching. I used to go to the gym but let that drop when we got 2 big dogs that needed just as much daily exercise as I did.

I was an avid yoga fan long before my kids were born 12 years ago so I have several old VHS intermediate tapes that I can no longer do nor have time for. I agree that this WON'T replace a good yoga routine - for that you need at least 45-60 minutes of long slow concentrated practice. This is not a ""teaching video"" but it's moves aren't hard to follow for beginners. And don't be intimidated by her flexibility. This is perfect after a 15-30 minute walk, run, bike ride, or other warmup activity to stretch almost every major muscle. It feels great in the morning (and I am NOT a happy riser) and probably just as good at night (I'd rather veg at the end of a long day!).

They suggest you need a brick and strap. You can probably get away with not having the brick, though I got mine at Target and there is one back stretch that is just devine so I do advise it. As for the strap, I just use an old scarf which works fine. I certainly am not flexible as the girl in the video but that's ok. Every day I can feel my shoulders and upper and lower back loosen up a bit and the leg stretches feel wonderful after my walk.

1779041,5,B00006IX6J,I bought this as a VHS and just recently purchased the DVD version.  I love this video.  Suzanne Deason gently leads you through a very basic yoga practice.  This is a good morning and evening practice to stretch your body out without pushing you.  I like it best in the mornings since my body isn't very awake and its gentle and slow and allows me to wake up.,1277942400,,360,4.25
1779042,3,B00006IX6J,"If you're just beginning yoga, I'd highly recommend ""getting started with yoga"" by bodywisdommedia, or Gentle Yoga for Beginners by yoga zone to learn the poses in a more traditionally paced teaching format.

I've only been learning yoga for the past two months, and still consider myself a beginner. I picked up a copy of this from the public library as I was trying to figure out which DVDs to purchase for my home practice (highly recommend your public library's educational DVD section!).

Suzanne Deason's quickly executed instructions seem like the opposite of Peggy Cappy's ""yoga for the rest of us"" lessons, which I think go a little too slow (to account for Peggy's older, less traditional audience). Suzanne goes through the poses a little too quickly for my taste, and doesn't allow time to ""breathe into"" the poses. She also doesn't account for those of us who have to watch the screen first to see what she's doing before doing it ourselves - a subtle extra second in each pose would have helped a lot.

If this ""stress relief yoga for beginners"" really IS for beginners, I'd label it advanced amateur. My knees did not like the progression of poses or the pace they were practiced. You also need to know that while she uses props without warning (the brick and a strap) she also neglects to give any sort of intro saying that if you can't go as deeply into a pose it's ok.  At one point she tells you to get your knees to your armpits, or rest your head on the brick, and my body just isn't able to do that.

If you are brand new to yoga, I'd recommend finding a beginner yoga class at a local yoga studio or gym, and attending a few classes to learn with a live instructor before trying to do anything on your own at home.

For this disc to be more helpful and user-friendly, I think there should be an intro to the session with demonstrations of different poses and instructions about alternate poses.  There is a second section with interviews and info about props, but you wouldn't think to watch that first.

I also think they need to repackage the dvd to let people know it's fast paced, for advanced beginners, and that the routine necessitates props.",1267660800,5,2172,4.551282051282051

1779044,5,B00006IX6J,This short session is perfect for any level. I used this when I started yoga. I've practiced yoga for years and still love it as a quick stretch and/or cool down.

1779045,2,B00006IX6J,"Although this DVD is marketed to beginners and is included in Gaiam's ""All Day Yoga for Beginners,"" this is NOT a beginner's workout. This 20 minute workout moves quickly from pose to pose, using the Yoga name rather than a descriptive
phrase, i.e. ""Begin in mountain pose"" rather than ""begin by standing erect."" forcing the student to constantly refer to the screen.

Many of the poses require more balance and flexibility than a beginner possesses and no intermediate or substitute poses are given. Instructor Suzanne Deason's only concession to beginners is the use of a block to lessen the stretch of some of the poses.

I would NOT recommend this to a beginner.",1261958400,4,666,4.884955752212389

1779047,3,B00006IX6J,"I first tried this program on VHS when I was fairly new to yoga and wanted some shorter practices to perform during times when I'm time-crunched (back then, there was a lot less yoga media available on the market, and most of the offerings seemed to be longer, at least 40-60 minutes).  Furthermore, I wanted something that was gentle and relaxing as opposed to a more ""power yoga"" style. I was familiar with Suzanne Deason and liked her teaching style, so I decided to give ""Stress Relief Yoga for Beginners"" (the former title of the VHS version) a try.

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in this video, which felt rushed rather than relaxing. Although I still found Deason's voice to be soothing and thought that she cued well, she moved so quickly from pose to pose that there was little opportunity to actualy enjoy/relax in the postures. Furthermore, the use of props only hindered and further complicated this practice--if the routine had moved at a slower pace, with time allowed for lengthier holds, the props would be a nice addition, making this practice more restorative and allowing those with less flexibility to attain the poses.  Instead, because the transitions were so fast, I spent most of my time worrying about where the props were supposed to be positioned--by the time I had this figured out, it was time to move on.

Currently, there are much better options on available on the market.  Barbara Benagh's Yoga for Stress Relief offers a variety of practices of varying lengths, and I would definitely choose that DVD or another newer release over this one.",1252454400,18,1583,4.848148148148148
1779048,5,B00006IX6J,"I received the dvd promptly and professionally packaged.  I ordered it brand new, and am very satisfied.  I would definately buy from these people again.",1239667200,,153,5.08
1779049,4,B00006IX6J,This is a wonderful video that gradually gets you back into the routine of doing yoga.  It's only 20 minutes which is great for me since I have a young toddler running around.  It had been years since I last practiced and I've found it has really helped me feel a lot better.  To me Suzanne Deason has a pleasant voice that is peaceful and easy to listen to.  I actually had the VHS years ago and bought this about a month ago because I enjoyed it so much then.  I've been doing the workout for a month and can tell a difference in how I feel.  My muscles feel much more relaxed and I am finally able to do all the poses easily.,1236384000,10,628,4.024193548387097
1779050,5,B00006IX6J,"I purchased this video to try to reduce my daily stress.  Although with my busy life, I only have time to do it three times a week, it's worth it.  The stretching and bending as well as the soothing voice really relax your body and mind.  I find that anytime I have 20 minutes, I'm doing the video and feeling great.  It does its job!",1232323200,,334,4.092307692307692
1779051,5,B00006IX6J,"I absolutely love this video - so much so, that I have been through 3 copies from wearing them out.  It is the only practice 1) i can fit into my schedule, it's the perfect length to make time for 2) that doesn't result in injury or aggravation of back/hip issues.
Says total content is over an hour - there's tips for using props etc, but I just go straight to Stress Relief Practice --> Gentle Stretch and then the rest of the core practice goes from there - total time is 20 minutes which is perfect for me.
I very highly recommend this video and can't say enough.  It strengthens, stretches and relaxes.  It is perfect for am or pm. love it!",1224288000,,645,4.227642276422764
1779052,5,B00006IX6J,"I have had this DVD for years and used it religiously for quite a while when I was first beginning yoga.  I always recommend it for beginners who want to try yoga because the poses she uses are not too difficult, and she uses a brick and a strap (good for those who are not very flexible).

I still enjoy doing this DVD now, from time to time, and feel very relaxed and refreshed - although I find it is not challenging enough for me anymore.  But if you are looking for a good introduction to yoga, I recommend this DVD highly.  Another good DVD for beginners is AM/PM yoga with Rodney Yee and Patricia Waldon.",1217894400,3,611,4.241379310344827
1779053,5,B00006IX6J,"I first used this DVD 8 years ago and still use it to this day on a weekly basis! There's something very soothing about the background music and the sunset and the tempo. For me, it's great stress and tension relief for my shoulders and upper back, where I carry a lot of my stress.  I think 20 min is PERFECT, especially for beginner's or right before bed or in the morning when you want to start your day out on a good note!",1216598400,7,426,4.071428571428571
1779054,4,B00006IX6J,"I LOVE this one. It was my first video - my introduction - to yoga several years ago. As a beginner, it took me a while to get used to these new moves. As with anything else, it got easier with time and practice.

Fast forward several years and I still find myself reaching for this one. It's gentle, yet very effective, and I always get a good stretch out of it. It's also a great pick-me-upper in the middle of the day when I feel stiff from sitting at the computer for one too many hours. Being only approximately 18 minutes long I have NO excuse for not taking the time to do this.

The setting is beautiful and the music is relaxing. Suzanne does it at a very comfortable pace, though I wish she would hold child's pose a little longer. I've bought it for several friends who voiced a desire to try yoga. Great for everyone - beginners and experienced alike.",1209686400,3,863,4.2560975609756095
1779055,4,B00006IX6J,"This is a good 20-minute all-around practice, useful for squeezing in when you don't have much time for yoga practice.  I've got where I prefer it to both the a.m. and p.m. videos in this same series.

It includes everything a good yoga practice should:  a warm up, standing poses, twists, backbend, forward bends and relaxation.  Emphasis on loosening the shoulders, and opening the lungs.

Naturally, in trying to include so much in such a short time, there are parts that feel a bit rushed, which is the video's main flaw.  However, it's not so fast that I can't keep up.  If I have a leisurely  morning ahead of me, I will generally choose something else -- but I'm happy to have this for mornings that aren't.",1207440000,,714,4.566929133858268
1779056,4,B00006IX6J,"I have been so tense lately, horrible knots and stiffness all through my shoulders, my neck, and even my face.  When the headache started kicking in late this morning, I debated:  Should I pop a few pills or try the ""Stress Relief Yoga"" program I found when I cleaned out my media cabinet yesterday.  Since I pretty much take medicine only as a last resort, the program won.

And, to my astonishment, I experienced almost immediately relief after the first two stretches/poses.  My muscles felt stretched and relaxed and I could feel air pouring into my lungs.  As I continued the work-out, my sinuses actually started to clear, I felt energized and calm.  So I think this program was AMAZING for my purposes.

I did have some quibbles regarding equipment - you'll need a yoga block and a strap to do this routine - I had to improvise.  Also, the pace is pretty brisk, but I was able to keep up, and I am someone who has NO experience with Yoga.

But after doing this workout, I am determined to learn more about Yoga and to find an affordable class around here.  Perhaps years from now I will echo the complaints of others who are more experienced, whose reviews have advocated longer stretches, more poses, etc..., but for this newbie, this program is terrific.",1195084800,3,1263,4.59375
1779057,3,B00006IX6J,"I find this audio very useful if I haven't done yoga for awhile. It is relatively easy, and it takes little energy. The problem is that Suzanne Deason whips through these poses so that people on a tight schedule can hurry up and relax in 20 minutes or so. To benefit from yoga, one must take time and relax into the pose. In fact, it's helpful to do each pose more than once to get a better stretch. There is no time on this video. In fact, this pace could cause injury to someone who stretches too quickly.

I still use Stress Relief for Yoga, but I keep the remote handy and pause the DVD several times while I hold my pose. This would be a perfect DVD, if Deason slowed down. I have found nothing better as a tool for relaxation.

I originally bought this in VHS, but had to remember to rewind to the actual start of the exercises. I did not want to hear Deason's spiel each time I played the video. I'm happy to say that the intro has a section of its own on the DVD verson.",1181606400,,978,4.088541666666667
