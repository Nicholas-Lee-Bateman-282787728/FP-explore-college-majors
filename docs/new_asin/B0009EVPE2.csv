8059769,5,B0009EVPE2,"Great acting in a credible story full of both humor and tragedy. The real protagonist of the movie is neither Glenda Jackson as Alice, who delivered a fine performance, nor Oliver Reed who, despite his relatively brief appearance, electrified the scenes he's in with his portrayal of an uncouth, lecherous, and violent sergeant. But the big prize in acting belongs to Brian Deacon, the AWOL soldier who befriends Alice. He performed admirably in a very demanding--and not so lovable--role.",1509753600,,489,5.2025316455696204
8059770,5,B0009EVPE2,"SWEET, SOMBER FILM!! - HIGH QUALITY ACTING -- (slow moving)  -- *Young/handsome man-slightly older, beautiful woman fall in love.  OLIVER REED was born to be a Thespian! Very few are as good as he is/was ...I enjoyed watching movies next to my Grandmother's bedside (on the floor) -She adored Mr. Reed.. That's how I became acquainted with him  --Was too young to appreciate his dramatic TALENT back then (smiles).",1507939200,,414,4.971014492753623
8059771,1,B0009EVPE2,"To what purpose did this movie make?  A man gone AWOL, wears women's clothes, plays and argues with farm woman in cahoots with him, gets caught.  You know what's going to happen from the very beginning.  When the end comes you look at the clock and see that you've allowed yourself to waste another portion of your life on clap-trap.",1507248000,2,333,4.516666666666667

8059774,5,B0009EVPE2,"Brilliant performances (so realistic) by Glenda Jackson, Oliver Reed (a 'powerhouse' - just as in ""the trap"" and ""I'll never forget whatsisname"") and, Brian Deacon.",1417996800,2,164,5.6
8059775,5,B0009EVPE2,"This little known film is a masterpiece!  Years ago my wife and I had an interview with Glenda, and she mentioned that hoped one day its greatness would be recognized.  It is one of her finest films.",1383782400,7,199,4.351351351351352
