4979729,5,B0069556OK,"As we come to part 4 of the bluray series, the bluray quality is no less than outstanding. Picture and sound are crisp and defined. Part 4 marks the end of season 1 of Fairy Tail, and I sure can't wait for upcoming bluray releases of it.

This is a must have for every Fairy Tail fans out there. Highly recommended!",1334534400,,315,4.163934426229508
4979730,5,B0069556OK,This is the best Fairy Tail set that has been released thusfar just for the simple reason it finishes the arcs rather than leaving you hanging as the other ones did. Love this series.,1333065600,,183,4.411764705882353
4979731,4,B0069556OK,"It's a great anime what else can I say. A great shounen that redefined the classic magic genre. Great action, comedy, good plot for Jella arc sorta and the Lacy's one is complete in the DVD. If you already have some fairy tail DVD and love it you won't be dissatisfied by this. If you love naruto shippuden, bleach, Dragon ball , D.gray man or fma brotherhood you probably love this show.",1332633600,3,388,4.402777777777778
4979732,5,B0069556OK,"This is my first review, so I hope you all enjoy!

The release date for this is not until March 20th, however I received it early from RightStuf.com, and so I am able to make this review.

Part 4 continues the story of Erza's once tragic past where she was a slave in the Tower of Heaven. Her child hood friend Jellal has since then taken over the tower and continued its production, due to the Demon ""Zeref"" who took over his conscious. Once the issue with the Tower is resolved, the Fairy Tail members return home to find their guild bigger than ever, with many new ramifications. There also seems to be a few new members, one of which you may be shocked to see. Laxus finally makes a return to the guild with his 3 followers, Freed, Bixlow, and Evergreen, where they declare a festival to see who is the strongest in the guild. This battle quickly escalates, pitting members of the guild against each other, and Laxus then reveals his sole reason for this fighting festival. After we gain some more backstory on Laxus, the guild holds the Fantasia Parade, ending the set off with a very emotional impact.

The voice acting, as always, in both Japanese and English were well done. The quality of the anime on Blu-Ray is superb, it is much better than just finding some old website that hosts it in Standard Definition. For the price, it is definitely worth it, you will enjoy watching these 12 episodes which end season 1 in a very sensational way. This may be the final set in America, so if you want to see more after this, then please continue to support the industry.",1329609600,18,1573,4.454861111111111

4979758,5,B0069556OK,"Chains rattle as Natsu duels a legendary member of the Death's head order: Fukuro in part 4! The battle goes sour soon though, and Natsu is soon overpower by being subjugated to his primary weakness: transportation. More fights ensue in the tower has Lucy and Juvia take on a SerialKiller Rockstar, and Erza takes on another sword Master.

Nearing the end, confronts Jellal, and wins for a while, but is beaten back by a second wind Jellal obtains from merging with... a similiar wizard. Overpowered Erza is knocked down, and almost sacrificed to Zeref, but stoped by Natsu who arrives just in time to show Jellal the true power of a dragon slayer. This two episode long fight sees Natsu releasing all his force on Jellal in vain. Angered by his weakness, Natsu charges up by eating Ethernano- a magical substance left behind by an etherion blast which the council fired to destroy the tower. (spoiler- the tower absorbes the blast). Now overflowing with powerful (and poisonous) magic energy, Natsu enters ""Dragon Force""- the ultimate stage of a Dragon Slayer that amplifies their attacks, and gives them enhanced dragon abilities. (not to mention cool scales on their skin) Only you can see if Dragon Force is enough to take down this powerhouse villian trying to revive the world's most destructive dark wizard.

After the Tower of Heaven incident, the Strongest Team arrives back home to a newly completed guild hall! adapting to the new space the building gives them, the Strongest team, and the rest of Fairy Tail takes life easy, and prepares for the upcomming event: the Magnolia Harvest festival- in which, Fairy Tail takes center role in the parade.

Prior to the festival, it is customary for Fairy Tail to host a ""Miss Fairy Tail contest"" to find the most pretty member in the guild. This is interrupted though...
Attempting to usurp his grandfathers power, Laxus, and his ""Thunder Legion"" consisting of Evergreen, Freed, and Bigslow force all the men in Fairy Tail to fight by turning the contestants of the contest (Lucy, Erza, Levy, Mirajane, Cana, and Juvia) into stone, and threating to shatter them if they don't all fight eachother. The rules are simple: beat the Thunder Legion and Laxus, and the girls are freed.
As the men spread out looking for the Thunder Legion, they are suprised to find runespell enchantments that trap them, and force them to fight each other! Fairy Tail soon wipes itself out, and with Natsu, and the Master trapped by an enchantment, the situation looks bleak to Fairy Tail. Find out what happens next, and watch the climatic ending to Fairy Tail Season 1, by buying Fairy Tail Part 4!",1406160000,,2632,4.844444444444444

Hiro Mashima, the series author, has created a vast, exciting world.  The background of the main characters is rich, and quite often, filled with tragic events.

People who enjoy this series may want to consider following Fairy Tail in the Manga format.  Fans may also want to read Hiro Mashima's prior work, Rave Master, as it follows similar themes.",1346976000,,566,4.6767676767676765
