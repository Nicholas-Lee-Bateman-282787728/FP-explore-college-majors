Anyways, here's my take on Shamanic Princess: First, let me define  something here.
 ""Shaman: A member of certain tribal societies  who acts as a medium between the visible world and an invisible spirit  world and who practices magic or sorcery for purposes of healing,  divination, and control over natural events. - shamanic.""
In other  words, this is an anime about a princess that has powers over the this  world and the paradimension.
Although Shamanic Princess has some  excellant animation and great dubbing, I found the storyline/action to be  missing something.  The effects were really good, but the anime itself  couldn't hold my attention very much.
The only thing I can say is you  might have better luck with this anime.  I didn't find it particularly  interesting, but you might.  My suggestion: give it a try, you never know.",967075200,4,982,4.92638036809816
7898062,5,6305845689,"I must say that this video leaves you hanging. I've only seen the first tape, ""Tiara's Quest,"" so I assume that to truly understand the  Throne of Yord, you'll have to see the rest of the series. I like that.  Tiara has an attitude, but you can definitely learn to love her. Kagetsu  seems to be evil, but when you look beneath that, it's only that he cares  so deeply for his sister, Sera. Lina, on the other hand, is even more  difficult to figure out than Kagetsu. Leon, her partner, reminds me of  Inouva from Magic Knight Rayearth. He's incredibly dedicated to Lina, which  sometimes puts him in a lot of danger. Finally, we have Japolo- Tiara's  partner. Japolo is a bit of a nag, but has an addictive personality. It's  difficult to realize that Tiara really DOES love Kagetsu, but she tries to  hide it from everyone- including herself. If he refuses to yeild the Throne  of Yord to her, she must kill him. All in all, it's one of the best anime  I've ever seen.",966470400,,970,4.387640449438202
7898063,5,6305845689,"When I had first recieved Shamanic Princess it looked like it was going to be a very promising movie (even though I'm not big on dubbs)it turned out to be not quite as good as I had expected.  I went through the 2 episodes  on the tape, it started to look better.  After a while it came to be one of  my favorite movies.  The movie suggests some native american style  shamanism due to the reddish-brown body art used on the charachters during  fighting.  The main characters are Tiara-sent to retrieve the Throne of  Yord, Jopolo-Tiaras' ferret partner, Leena-sent before Tiara to retrieve  Throne of Yord, Leon-Leenas' somewhat overly dedicated partner,  Kagetsu-stole the Throne of Yord in order to save his sister,  Sara-Kagetsus' sister.",962236800,,742,4.895161290322581
7898064,4,6305845689,"If you like Magic Knight Rayearth you'll love Shamanic princess, the character designs are by the same person as Magic Knight Rayearth (Atsuko Ishida) Tiara, the main character, is after a talisman stolen by the man  she loves because he needs it to save his sister, Tiara must decide if  she's going to help save his sister, Sarah, or if she's going to follow  orders and bring the talisman back. By day Tiara is a normal School girl,  however at night she fights monsters and other members of her own world,  most of all her archrival has fallen in love with Tiara's dearest love,  it's a race to see who will save Sarah and win the heart of this really  cute young man.  Vol. 1 is really good and leaves you wanting more, i can't  wait until the second Volume comes out!",961977600,,773,4.387323943661972
7898065,5,6305845689,"Great anime title. I'm glad I bought it. If you like anime, magic or the supernatural you have to own this title. It's worth every penny. It makes you wanting to watch it over again and wanting to buy the other episodes.",961545600,,220,4.261904761904762
7898066,5,6305845689,"The Shamanic Princess is one ofmy favorite anime series of all time. It consist's of a 6 part collection. Typical of most OAV series, inwhich this one is. The character design of this anime is AWESOME! Done by the same  artists behind the smash-hit Magic Knight Rayearth.  The Shamanic Princess  follows Tiara, a girl with powers guided by her side kick who is a ferret!  How cute!  It's about the duo's search for a kidnapped girl named Sara. It  is a very good anime, plot line, animation, voice acting. It's a defenant  pick for a TRUE anime fan!",961545600,5,549,4.540816326530612
