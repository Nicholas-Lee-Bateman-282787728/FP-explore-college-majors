8521693,5,B007SXWTR4,"I'm sitting in my living room watching the Your Story DVD...and crying off all my makeup. This DVD is pretty much person after person willing to be vulnerable enough to share their struggles, trials, victories, and triumphs with a faceless audience. These beautiful people have walked through all manner of difficulty and come out on the other side better, stronger, and more whole than they were before. It's terrifically inspiring. For me, there's even a touch of surrealism watching that girl with the curly hair talk about regaining her emotional life. (That girl is me.) As I listen to each story, the faceless audience they spoke to is granted a face and I become another life touched by these people's courage. Get this DVD, watch it, and be inspired.",1334707200,,758,4.883720930232558
