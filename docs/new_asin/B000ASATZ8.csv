2391141,5,B000ASATZ8,"I am a huge fan of the Tremors movies, and am very excited to see a box set funally being released. The first movie is excellent, the foundation for many good sci-fi/fantasy movies, the beginning is slow enough to actually introduce the movie, but exciting enough to have you hooked, then comes Tremors 2: Aftershocks, new setting, new challenge, new characters, same classic storyline and still has Micheal Gross as Burt Gummer, the match made in heaven for an actor to a part. Tremors 3: Back to Perfection, back to the original detting with a few new characters and yet another exciting twist and an all new way to save the day. Then comes Tremors 4: The Legend Begins, One of the only good prequels in movies to date. All this for only $26 list price? An excellent buy.",1127001600,29,773,4.568345323741007
2391142,4,B000ASATZ8,"If you are planing on buying this box set, buy it for Tremors 4, 1, and 2. Tremors 1 was a very good movie, Tremors 2: Aftershocks was five times better, Tremors 3: Back To Perfection is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, and Tremors 4: The Ledgend Begins was an amazing prequel that brought the series back with a bang! Tremors is one of the stries that should have stopped going forward with story after the second one. Watch these in the order of 4, 1, and 2.",1126396800,13,468,4.0978260869565215
2391143,3,B000ASATZ8,"Take part two and four out of this pack and you have a great value.  Obviously Tremors 1 is one of the best movies of all-time.  Tremors 3 got it right, but Michael Gross playing a carnie in part 4 was just wrong.  I hope Tremors 5 will live up to the hype.",1126310400,2,257,3.811320754716981

2391159,5,B000ASATZ8,"Trying to escape their dead-end life in the desert town of Perfection, Nevada, Valentine ""Val"" McKee and Earl Bassett find themselves side-tracked. When corpses mysteriously start piling up around them. When Val and Earl have a face-off with some spine-chilling tentacle creatures that have made lunch out of a road crew, they withdraw to the town to spread the news.

Although these monsters are not exactly cognoscente, their psychological powers are still overpowering. Identifying a human hiding in a car, they dig under the vehicle, causing it to sink into the earth. Val and Earl get help from several townspeople. With the help of Rhonda, Val and Earl kill one of the monsters. Nevertheless, there are three of them left, and they are each about 30 feet long. Walter starts calling the monsters Graboids. When the survivors think they have outmanoeuvred the Graboids by taking refuge atop the roofs of buildings, the Graboids merely destroy the buildings' foundations, killing two people.

The Graboids are quick learners when it comes to stalking their prey, and the humans must continually be on their toes if they are to stay alive while they try to find a way to defeat the Graboids. This is a somewhat gorefest of a film with a sprinkle of dark humour, all highly recommended.",1503187200,,1288,4.958333333333333

2391236,5,B000ASATZ8,"There are already lots of reviews for all 4 of the movies included in this collection so I will just stick to the basics.

I'm giving this 5 stars because of the value. I paid $9.99 for 4 movies. So it's 4 stars for the movie and 1 star added on for value.

Tremors (1) - This had the biggest budget of the four and it shows. It has excellent effects and an entertaining story line that never gets boring. It's the only movie with Kevin Bacon because he thought these movies were 'beneath him.'  Burt Gummer almost steals the show and he is the reason they keep making these movies.

Tremors 2 - We lose Kevin Bacon but all is not lost. The movie is entertaining even if the it's lower budget and the effects aren't as good.

Tremors 3 - We get CGI effects and some of the cast from Tremors 1. I found that even though there is a lot of action this movie got boring and tedious. The grabboids have evolved  way too much. I guess they needed something new.

Tremors 4 - I kept waiting for this movie to get better and I was disappointed. While I'm not an action junkie, for the most part I dislike prequels. I don't really enjoy the old west stuff just like I didn't like the old west in Back to the Future 3. I kept waiting for Burt to turn into...well...;Burt...but he never really does. There isn't a whole lot of comedy in this one and frankly, it gets quite boring. The only good part was the gunfighter they hired.

Recommend for fans of campy horror and monster movies.",1461196800,,1475,4.224199288256227

2391243,4,B000ASATZ8,"The original Tremors film was one of those rare lightning in a bottle occurrences, a low budget sic-fi horror comedy that turned out to be one of the best of its kind. While not really breaking new ground it mangoes some very tough frets, It's intense, even scary at times, it is funny without being self conscious and captures the very best of the old Sci-Fi films of the 50's without thumbing their nose at them.

This Blu Ray box set included the first 4 fins inn the franchise in one compact little package. The first movie is the best by far, but I find things to enjoy in all of the sequels. The transfers are actually better than I expected with a much improved look and sound to all four films offered here.

The extras are carried over from their DVD releases, but nothing new has been added. It is disappointing that the second film and best sequel doesn't receive any extras, but I was more interested in the films in a space saving package to relieve my ever shrinking video shelves.

The first film I'd rate 4 1/2 stars, the transfer is very good, there are some scenes with mild grain, but keep in mind that most of this film takes place in a sandy hot desert and this film didn't cost a zillion dollars to make. The detail is very good especially in close up shots. Tremors is one of those films I never tire of, it reminds me of Jaws, not so much for the obvious reasons, but because it was probably one of those films that sounded like a standard bubblegum movie on paper, but turned out to be a great film. It's may not be Jaws, but it is a film that should be studied on how to make a movie like this correctly.

The second film After Shocks I'd rate 3 /12 stars, the transfer is at least on par with the first, but not even a trailer is included for this film and this is the biggest disappointment with this set. It should be noted that all the sequels are direct top video releases and i commend them for being able to secure some principle players. Ward and Gross are back in this film and this really adds a lot to the film.

The 3 film Back to Perfection is a mixed bag, I like the film, but the effects are very unconvincing during the CGI sections and it really spoils this one for me, if they had used practical effects I'd probably rate this one 3 stars, but because of the shoddy CGI work, I'd give it a generous 2 1/2 stars. Only Gross is back and he saves this one from disaster.

The forth film looks great here and it is actually a pretty good film, the effects are much better this time around too. I's give this one 2 1/2 + stars. What I like about these sequels is that they didn't try to make the same exact film over and over.  For me sequels are mostly pointless, but the Tremors Franchise at least keeps evolving. Unfortunately, they didn't stop with number 4, but you can read my review for that film by itself. It's a shame the effects work is really well done in the newest film, but they didn't get the tone of the other 4 films, it is strangely odd and it no where near as fun.

As for this 4 film Attack Pack Blu Ray set, it is compact, it includes the first 4 films with much improved video and sound, it carries over all the extras and it is very inexpensive. Need I say more?, if you're a fan of these films, this is a no brainer because I doubt we are going to see a deluxe box set anytime soon of ever.

Well, except maybe the made-for-TV / direct-to-DVD ""prequel"" (weakest, IMO). The less said the better. The rest are great though. Campy monster flicks with some pretty good humor.

It's nice getting all the movies in one place. (Well, other than Tremors 5, which came out after this was released...) Been waiting for the Blu-Ray version of the Attack Pack. Glad they finally remastered the series and released it.

Has a few special features. Not terrible...

Good set at a decent price. I give it a hearty recommend. And Check out Tremors 5, too. I think it was pretty decent.",1455667200,2,604,4.778846153846154

I recommend this box set to every Tremors fan out there, and I recommend the film series to any fan of horror comedies and creature features.",1455408000,,483,4.5

2391274,5,B000ASATZ8,"The original Tremors was a breath of fresh air when it came out in 1990. It hearkened back to the monster movies of the 1950's while maintaining a modern approach to style and characters. And what characters! A great ensemble cast propels the simple storyline from a nice, leisurely build-up through to a rousing finish. It quickly became one of my favorite movies.

I wanted a copy on blu-ray and discovered this package for under twenty bucks. Deal!

In addition to the original Tremors the package also contains the first three followups. The first two sequels are imminently forgettable, going so far astray as to turn their backs on the premise--monsters under the ground--to bring the ""graboids"" above ground and even into the air. Both of the first two sequels rise above Syfy Channel mediocrity, but they fail to soar.

The fourth installment is a prequel. Once again the graboids are underground where they belong and the whole production bespeaks of a desire to ""get it right this time."" It's a good, solid entry into the series and, being a prequel, you can easily pretend that the two sequels don't exist.

So, the package gives us one excellent movie, one good one, and two duds for the price of a single disc. A great value IMO!",1452643200,,1242,4.736111111111111

Must be a guy thing, or maybe just ""my husband"" thing. He was like a kid on Christmas when he opened the package to these movies. I, of course, saw the inside of my brain as my eyes rolled back into my head. But I cannot base this review on my reaction, since this was for my husband alone. and since he was elated, I give this 5 stars.",1451865600,,462,3.925531914893617
2391278,3,B000ASATZ8,"First, Kevin Bacon is only in Tremors 1.  It is somewhat misleading to state Tremors Attack Pack with Kevin Bacon. Since he is in only the first one it is the best although Michael Gross is in them all the following two don't seem to have the effort put into them and number 4? I could easily have passed on that one. Supposedly a prequel it is cheesy and ridiculous in a way I couldn't even find humor in. Bad acting and the storyline is so fragmented that my adult son and I just threw our hands up and turned it off after it was half over.",1451433600,,542,4.065420560747664

It's funny, it's very different than most other monster movies, it's very unique and enjoyable to watch if you give it half the chance.  The franchise has seen it's ups and downs, but for the most part it's stayed pretty solid.
All four movies tell separate yet similar stories, featuring a new incarnation of the Graboid lifecycle.  The comedy has some just GOLD moments, all of the movies will make you LOL so much.  They're all really fun to watch and this is a great set of them for the price.  I think I got it for about eight bucks from Walmart a while ago.

 I most often watch a movie for ""escape"" without ""tension"" and these provide it.

I liked the series and since it was so inexpensive bought it.. No regrets.
 Not all of the other 3 in the series are as good as the original , but the fun is still there. My granddaughter loves them too and refers to them as the Worm Movies.
BTW the Movie Museum in Lone Pine California (area it was filmed) holds some of the creature props and a great selection of props, posters and history of filming making in that area...From early John Wayne westerns to one of the ""Generations""  era Star Trek Movies.",1431820800,,725,4.5038167938931295

2391381,4,B000ASATZ8,"The original Tremors is one of the most fun creature features of all time in my eyes. A fun & great cast, well done special effects, cool tunneling creatures in the form of 'Graboids' and genuinely funny humor. While the original got a theatrical release, the 3 sequels were all released direct to video. The 2nd film is almost as good as the original, the 3rd is mediocre at best and the 4th which was a prequel to whole series set in the old west was complete rubbish. Universal had previously assembled all 4 films in a DVD 'Attack Pack' with each film being in anamorphic widescreen. The original film was reissued in 2007 on the defunct HD-DVD format and Universal would reuse that same transfer for the film's 2010 bluray release. That transfer was the subject of much criticism as it was saddled with a bit too much digital noise reduction and edge enhancement which robbed the film of some of its detail. While an improvement over the anamorphic DVD it could have been better.

The good news is that Universal didn't just recycle the first film's original bluray transfer for inclusion on the bluray version included in the new 4 film Attack Pack. Direct comparison reveals that the new bluray transfer of the classic original film features less digital noise reduction and edge enhancement which has resulted in more natural film grain being present with more fine detail able to be seen. It is still not perfect however but is an improvement. The 3 sequels make their bluray debut in this collection and look a bit better overall compared to the original. Overall this set is a noticeable improvement over its DVD predecessors. This is a 2 disc set with two films on each disc but I didn't notice any compression artifacts of any sort. All previous extras were ported as well. Audio gets a nice bump in lossless HD fidelity.

Overall this is a fun and pretty well done bluray collection. Most stores only sell this set for 12.99 or less if you look well enough. While the transfers aren't quite what they could have been, the films have never looked better and this is the best we're probably going to get at this point.",1426032000,4,2130,4.632275132275132

Mine were not double sided disks as others have reported getting. Mine came in two disks both one sided with two movies per disk (1 & 2 on disk 1 & 3 & 4 on disk 2) also all are full screen versions which I prefer for my HDTV.

These movies are a childhood favorite of mine. My favorites being parts 1 & 2. I grew up renting them on tape in the 90s. 3 was pretty good & 4 was decent but not really needed (that's just my personal opinion)

THE FILMS:
I'm sure that the majority of you have approached this release with some trepidation just as I have.  Universal Studios' track record has shown that it is completely unconcerned with the quality of its home video releases as long as they bring in a few bucks with a minimum of cost to the studio.  The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2010-Blu-ray-release-of-the-original-34-Tremors-34/dp/B003YCI1O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2010 Blu-ray release of the original ""Tremors""</a>&nbsp;was a sad victim of this trend, with an appallingly filtered video transfer, decent audio and no new special features.  Well, three years later, Universal has reissued the first film along with its first three direct-to-video sequels.  How does this release fare, you ask?  As a seasoned fan of the ""Tremors"" franchise since the late nineties, I will attempt to shed some light on this issue.  I assume that you have some knowledge as to the nature of the films in question so I'll spare you plot synopses.

1990's ""Tremors"" is the ultimate cult classic; a film with decent critical repute and a loyal (if limited) fanbase.  It's the rare gem of a genre picture that manages to blend horror and comedy elements into one cohesive and effective package.  Despite it being one of my all-time favorite movies, you'll get no argument from me if we're dissecting its flaws.  The film doesn't have much in the way of character development and frequently violates its own rules regarding the graboids (the not-so-friendly creature antagonists of the franchise).  That said, director Ron Underwood's film is still one of the most genuinely likable movies I've ever seen and its merits far outweigh its flaws.  The characters, each perfectly cast and well-performed, are all likable.  Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are great as Val  McKee and Earl Bassett, respectively, and Michael Gross gives it his all in his signature role of Burt Gummer.  Notably, none of these characters are stupid and only one of them is a teenager, in stark contrast to your average horror film.  The creatures themselves are well-realized with unique designs and convincing special effects, with some genuine scares to be found herein.  I'll spare you a more in-depth review given that if you're interested in this release, you've probably long since made your mind up about the original film.  As for me, I'll go on record as calling ""Tremors"" the best horror comedy ever made.

As with most franchises, the sequels are a mixed bag.  The original film, while successful at the box office, was not a blockbuster.  It found an audience in the home video market, spurring the release a straight-to-video sequel by the name of ""Tremors 2: Aftershocks"" in 1996.  I'm not sure why the filmmakers felt the film needed a subtitle, but I assure any fan of the original film that the end product is far better than such a goofy heading might lead you to believe.  In fact, I like ""Aftershocks"" just as much as the first film and, depending on the day, sometimes more.  Despite its bargain bin pedigree, this sequel's production values are almost on par with its predecessor; the special effects are quite good and frequently impressive, with some great action sequences to boot.  Fred Ward and Michael Gross return from the first film and give it their all, with Michael Gross going even MORE over the top this time around.  Christopher Gartin fills in for Kevin Bacon, who decided not to return for the sequel, and Helen Shaver plays Kate Reilly, Ward's love interest.  While the chemistry between Ward and Bacon and the rest of the characters from the original film are missed, it's not detrimental to the film's overall entertainment value.

As silly as the film's premise is, there are plenty of new ideas in play.  In fact, ""Tremors 2"" had an arguably bigger effect on the ultimate franchise than did the original film.  The genesis of the graboid lifecycle, the methods used to hunt them and Burt's penchant for ridiculous overkill are all sealed here.  Many of the gags are amusing and there is some decent suspense in the middle of the film when the creatures unexpectedly metamorphose, successfully retaining the tone and atmosphere of the first ""Tremors.""  My uncle and I had a ""Tremors"" double feature one night, starting with the first film and ending with this one.  He couldn't believe it when I told him that this one was straight-to-video.  I'm not pretending that ""Aftershocks"" is as good as the first film nor that everyone will like it, but no one can say that the filmmakers didn't try and try hard to live up to the promise of the first film.
- - - - - ""Tremors 2: Aftershocks"" (1996) Movie Quality: 4.0/5.0 - - - - -

""Tremors 3: Back to Perfection"" is where the franchise begins to falter, in my humble opinion.  Remember how I said that the second film is on par with the first in terms of technical quality?  That sentiment no longer applies here.  Somehow, this 2001 film feels cheaper and more forced than it's mid-nineties counterpart.  Unlike the previous films in the franchise, the effects of this outing are lacking anything ""special.""  The graboids themselves look stiff when practical effects are on the screen and the CGI looks like it was ripped from ""Toy Story.""  These technical shortcomings could be forgiven if the rest of the film was up to snuff, but sadly that is not the case.  Whereas ""Aftershocks"" had some new ideas, ""Back to Perfection"" hinges on its namesake of returning to the town featured in the first film.  Michael Gross returns once again as Burt Gummer, but his role is played more for laughs and the character is more of a parody of the likable survivalist from the previous films than a effective lead.  Don't get me wrong: he's always been funny, but he's never been such a buffoon before.  I love Burt just as much as the next ""Tremors"" fan, and as such I don't think he should be portrayed as the butt of all of the jokes nor as an incompetent monster hunter that needlessly destroys his possessions.

A interesting wrinkle concerning this third film is the returning cast members: all of the survivors, save for Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Finn Carter and Reba McEntire, reappear and are played by their original actors.  That's quite an impressive feat for a straight-to-video sequel to a somewhat unsuccessful theatrical film that was released eleven years later, and ultimately more notable than anything else concerning the film itself.  In fact, it's quite infuriating that unlike the first film, the characters here frequently make stupid decisions, and it's more disconcerting when one stops to consider the fact that they seemed much smarter just two films ago.  The graboids return (obviously) but are no longer threatening due to their constant presence via the ""marketing"" employed by newcomer Susan Chuang as Jody Chang, niece of store-owner Walter from the first film.  Fellow newcomer Shawn Christian plays the equally charming and annoying ""Desert"" Jack Sawyer, who runs scam graboid tours, one of which results in an all too predictable gag once the real creatures show up.

By extension, predictability is really the film's main drawback.  The creatures change into another new form that, like star Michael Gross, is played more for self-parody than horror, and there are precious few surprises in store.  There's a distinct lack of tension and almost none of the gags are very funny, with Burt's constant one-liners becoming a bit grating by the film's end.  While there are positive elements, they are given a run for their money by the bad, which makes for a mixed experience.  It's hard to believe that ""Tremors 2"" spawned this misfire, much less the original film (or that this misfire spawned a short-lived TV series for the Sci-Fi channel, which is surprisingly much better than ""Back to Perfection."")  Back in the day, I used to catch the first two ""Tremors"" film on various primetime slots on various channels such as TNT, USA Network and the like.  It should be telling that, to my knowledge, this film has only ever aired on the Sci Fi Channel.  ""Back to Perfection"" is the definite low point of the series, in my not so humble opinion.

Despite the hit-or-miss response to the previous films, ""Tremors 4: The Legend Begins"" is where the fans REALLY divide.  I personally find this 2004 entry to be much more entertaining than ""Back to Perfection"", which should be telling as I tend not to care for prequels.  The facetious reference to the series as ""legend"" aside, there is really a lot to like here.  First and foremost, the production values once again appear on par with the first film (despite an even lower budget than for the third film), though not without a few shoddy spots.  The story, while a clich western parody, features the most well-rounded characters of the sequels.  All of them are distinct and series mainstay Michael Gross turns in a great performance as Hiram Gummer, ancestor of Burt, who is essentially the total opposite of his descendant and even has a nice, if predictable, character arc.  Unlike ""Tremors 3,"" many of the gags in this film are funny, with at least one laugh-out-loud moment in the film's midsection.

Even though I have a soft spot for ""Tremors 4"", I completely understand why some fans resent it and even agree with many of the criticisms.  Setting the film in the 1890s, effectively making it a western parody, can be a little grating if all one cares about is seeing Burt blast graboids and destroy his own property.  One gets the sense that this film is more of a side story than a continuation, which makes it all the more depressing that it was the final gasp for the franchise for over a decade (and the last to involve the original creators, as of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tremors-5-Bloodlines/dp/B011KME78M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tremors 5: Bloodlines</a>."").  Director S.S. Wilson mentions in the one of the featurettes for this film that ""part of the fun of prequels is seeing how the new characters learn the rules"" -- all aspiring filmmakers, please take note: despite my opinion of ""The Legend Begins,"" this sentiment is DEAD WRONG.  I normally dislike prequels for this reason, but this one clicked with me when I first saw it in 2004 because of its charm and likable characters.  Otherwise, seeing new people that we fans don't care about learning the rules everyone already knows is one of the most tedious filmmaking exercises in existence.  Having a returning character to guide new characters is one thing; wiping the slate clean is another.  Regardless of my fondness for ""The Legend Begins,"" I'll agree with anyone that this film ended the series with more of a whimper than a bang at the time due to its nature as a novelty.

VIDEO QUALITY:
The biggest point of contention among ""Tremors"" fans with the 2010 Blu-ray release was the horrendous video transfer.  Rather than spend money restoring or remastering any original film elements, Universal simply repurposed the HD DVD transfer from 2007, which was also less than perfect.  Further compounding the problems is the fact that ""Tremors"" has likely not been remastered since the late 1990s, as evidenced by the shoddy quality of its home video releases and the consistency of their flaws.  I've seen the original film quite a few times through various different formats and while the Blu-ray was definitely an upgrade, it was also quite offensive to the eyes.  While it should come as no surprise to anyone, Universal has neglected to restore or otherwise clean up the film.  This print is the same one that has been used for all of the previous versions I've seen of the film, with a tad bit of the filtering removed (leaving something of a grain structure for once).  I'm not a videophile and couldn't tell you the intricate differences between this version and the original Blu-ray, but it DOES look better, if only marginally, with more pronounced textures and less of the excess tampering that plagued the original Blu-ray.  Dirt assaults the screen at random points, but color reproduction is quite good.  ""Tremors"" will probably never look as good as it could given that Universal will likely never give it the restoration that it deserves, but it frequently looks decent here.

Surprisingly, ""Aftershocks"" looks quite good on Blu-ray.  The opening scene looks better than the entirety of the first film wholesale, and it only improves from there.  A few scenes in the middle of the film are almost reference quality, with a splash of colors across the screen, good fine detail reproduction and a nice depth to the images.  Again, I'm not a videophile, but as far as I could tell this transfer features no digital tampering and looks quite natural throughout.  It's not an amazing transfer and you won't see it playing on any of the TVs at Walmart, but the picture is still impressive when one considers the film's direct-to-video origins, age and the fact that Universal was involved.

Similar to the film itself, the transfer for ""Back to Perfection"" is lacking.  With the exception of a few key scenes that pop, the entirety of the film looks soft with a lack of fine detail throughout.  There's also little depth to the image and the colors are a bit dull, but this seems to be more representative of the source than the transfer itself.  There's a bit of grain and some dirt, which is surprising given that the print has likely been locked away in Universal's vaults since its original release in 2001.  Overall, there's not much to say about this one.  It's an upgrade, sure, but I wouldn't recommend it if it were a standalone release.

Unsurprisingly, ""The Legend Begins"" is the best looking of the bunch.  In fact, it looks SO good that I'm sure that some fans are going to complain as it's a whole TIER above the first film.  I'm not sure whether it was shot with film or digitally but it looks great either way (I assume film as there is dirt and speckles that appear, though it could have been transferred to a print for mastering).  Fine detail is consistent and apparent throughout and colors are bold with a nicely saturated hue.  Depth is also quite good, with many of the images practically popping off of the screen.  Again, I'm not an expert, but ""Tremors 4"" looked quite good to my eyes.  It's not quite reference quality, either, but given the nature of this film and the studio behind the release, it's quite impressive.

AUDIO QUALITY:
Whereas the video transfer for ""Tremors"" is only decent, the audio is quite good.  It's not in the same league as ""Jurassic Park,"" but it does the job nicely.  The graboid roars and destruction in the film all sounded quite nice when coming out of my speakers.  Solid is the key word, and it tells you all you need to know.

""Aftershocks"" favors it's predecessor in the sound department, with a solid but not necessarily exceptional soundtrack.  I don't have much to say here; it sounds good and clear but won't necessarily knock your socks off.  Effectively, it does its job, and it's a testament to the original sound crew and designers that it's as dynamic as it is.

Even though it sounds like I'm hating on ""Back to Perfection's"" technical presentation just because I'm not particularly fond of the film, I assure you that I'm giving an honest opinion of its technical presentation.  Audio for this film is bland, with dialogue having a muffled quality to it and the rest failing to impress.  It doesn't help that the sound design has a generic, public domain quality to it, with virtually none of the effects sounding in the least impressive.  If you've played a video game or seen a cheap action movie lately, you've heard these effects.  That said, this is how the film has always sounded to my ears, so I guess the Blu-ray is simply working with what it has as with the picture.  But that doesn't make the results any less unremarkable.

Like the visual presentation, ""The Legend Begins'"" soundtrack is also the best of the bunch and just below reference grade.  In stark contrast with ""Back to Perfection,"" the dialogue and sound effects of ""The Legend Begins"" all sound clear and crisp, as if they're happening right in front of you.  The sound design is also better than the previous film and helps to bolster the soundtrack's quality.  It's quite good.

SPECIAL FEATURES AND EXTRAS:
The Tremors Attack Pack comes in a standard Blu-ray case with an embossed slipcover, with the four films spread over two discs.  Despite early reports to the contrary, the films are housed on single-sided Blu-rays, with a simple menu that allows the viewer to choose which film they want to see (in typical Universal Studios style).  Special features and technical options are accessed via the pop up menu.  Unsurprisingly, the only bonus features that appear here are the ones that graced the DVDs themselves, which leaves the set a bit unevenly weighted.  The first film has a decent but limited set of behind-the-scenes material, the second has absolutely nothing, the third film has a lone featurette and the fourth film is absolutely bursting with content.  The material that IS present is all good and quite entertaining, but there is nothing new here and nothing that is in HD or that takes advantage of the Blu-ray format.  Still, who would expect anything extra when we can't even get the studio to properly restore the actual films?

OVERALL SCORE AND RECOMMENDATION:
I obviously like ""Tremors"" and this set's success or failure rate is dependent upon your own feelings toward the films.  If you already have the first film on Blu-ray and don't care for the sequels, I can't say that this is set offers anything resembling an upgrade.  However, if you DO like the sequels, you might as well go for this set.  It's a bargain bin release and the price reflects this distinction.  Given the films and limited exposure of this release at the outset, this set is likely to drop in price quite quickly.  For around $20.00 for a consistently entertaining series with varying technical presentations and bonus features, I'd call that a deal.  For me as a fan, it was money well spent.",1381017600,72,19658,4.794362017804154

The first one gets a 5 from me but this review is for all of them. As with almost any series sequels seem to fall some. The Tremors sequels are no exception though I still find them funny enough for a 4. Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon are hilarious in the first one and I think his only being in that one is a big reason for the fall off in the later movies.

Each one has a different theme and the Graboids keep mutating so that you never know how they'll turn up next. The fourth movie is really a Pre-quel that I hadn't even known existed, so it was fun too to see where it all started. Yeah, they might be a bit corny, but still they're just fun, a little scary at first and lots of humor to offset the grusome devouring of humans.

I ordered the 4-movie set understanding this was a low-$$$ money film that was not on the level of say...Harry Potter...But the second movie was sorely flat. The entire feel of the movie was different. The acting was pretty bad. The story line was WORSE. It basically morphed into a liberal Michael Gross mocking and making fun of ""right-winger"" kind of movie. Had I known that this was going to morph into a Michael Gross series I would NOT have bought the pack of 4 movies and would have stopped at the first movie. I strained to watch the entire second movie and got ten minutes into the third and have yet to go back on my most boring days to finish it and have no plans whatsoever to watch the fourth. It was stupid...and not being a Michael Gross fan to begin with...I'm even less so now.

My 14-year-old grandson, and I, 50 years older than he, do a marathon Tremors night at least twice a year.

2391773,4,B000ASATZ8,"Imagine wandering through an ordinary American desert... when suddenly vibration-sensing giant worms erupt from the ground and eat you. That;s the ""Tremors Attack Pack,"" which brings together all four movies from the delightfully dusty, gory and wildly bizarre cult movie series -- no pretensions, just good solid sci-fi/action.

In the original ""Tremors,"" tired-hands Earl (Fred Ward) and Val (Kevin Bacon) are intent on getting out of the sun-baked, dead-end town of Perfection -- only to run afoul of a vast subterranean worm that sucks people down and eats them. Soon the entire town is being held hostage by these vibration-sensing ""graboids,"" which are strong enough to rip apart the town. Now the guys must get the Perfectionites out of the town without being eaten by worms.

Six years afterwards, ""Tremors 2: Aftershock"" us to the embittered Earl, who is hired by the Mexican government to go graboid-hunting across the border. Helped out by dorky sidekick Grady (Christopher Gartin) and Burt Gummer (Michael Gross), Earl kills most of the graboids... until suddenly they mutate into two-legged, heat-sensing ""shriekers."" The remaining humans find themselves cornered by horrible little beasties that are as tenacious as graboids... but much more mobile.

""Tremors 3: Back to Perfection"" jumps back to the town where it all started, now a sort of graboid tourist trap, complete with fake tours by ""Desert Jack"" Sawyer (Shawn Christian). But when graboids reappear, Burt is stopped from graboid-hunting by government agents who intend to protect the ""oldest rarest endangered species of the planet.""  But there's an even more pressing problem: the shriekers have evolved into the final form: flying ""ass-blasters.""

""Tremors 4 - The Legend Begins"" jumps back in time, to a dusty little western town that is practically deserted when someTHING kills the miners at the local silver mine. Its dandyish owner Hiram Gummer (Michael Gross) arrives to reopen the mine... but soon the remaining townsfolk find themselves facing a bunch of weird wormlike monsters (referred to as ""dirt dragons"") that rapidly grow into monsters. Do they abandon the town, or stand and fight?

The ""Tremors"" movies were all written by people with excellent senses of humor, and a knack for weaving up suspense over something as minor as walking over a floor. The last couple plots suffer a bit from sequelitis at times, but each movie is liberally strewn with freaky mutations, orange blood'n'guts, chases across the dusty desert, strong smart women, and a truck full of survivalist food. Oh, and enough explosions to level the Rocky Mountains, including a fun scene with an antiaircraft turret.

And there's plenty of excellent writing (""She said I couldn't handle life without the threat of global war... what kind of thing is that to say to a man?""), with an extremely quirky sense of humor (Earl and Val handle every problem, be it breakfast or suicide runs, by playing rock-paper-scissors). It's this tight writing and nimble sense of humor that keeps the ""Tremors"" movies from becoming yet another stale action movie.

Michael Gross ends up being the reigning champ in this series, and while the gun-obsessed survivalist Burt starts a bit cartoonish, he ends up a well-rounded, hilariously practical lead (while doubling as Burt's dandyish ancestor). Fred Ward is great as the grizzled'n'grumpy Earl, while Kevin Bacon is outstanding as Val.  In fact, the cast of each movie is awesome -- Finn Carter, Helen Shaver, Shawn Christian, Reba McIntyre, August Schellenberg and Brent Roam all give especially good performances.

While the third and fourth films suffer a bit of sequelitis, ""Tremors Attack Pack"" is a fun, slimy and suspenseful race through graboid-infested deserts -- a must-see for cult movie fans.",1254009600,2,3797,5.230263157894737

2391775,5,B000ASATZ8,"Tremors 1: Val and Earl are 2 handymen in an isolated little desert town. Tired of the place they decide to leave. However, they come across a dead body and return to report it. A man has climbed up a pole and died of thirst. Attached to their car they find something weird. At first they believe it's part of a snake, they will soon find that it's way more exotic. And deadly. The phones are dead, and soon the little town of Perfection, Nevada, discovers the killers, giant underground worms with a taste for meat. The worms are tough, strong and quite smart.
Enter survivalist couple Heather and Burt Gummer, who, prepared for commie invasion, have an entire arsenal of weapons. They're gonna need it...

Tremors 2: Aftershocks: Earl is invited to go graboid hunting in Mexico. At 50 000 $ per worm, he thinks it's a sweet deal. He quickly realises he's in too deep and he contacts Burt Gummer. Together they find that the graboids have a surprise for them. The graboids are changing...

Tremors 3: Back to Perfection: Burt has been in South America hunting graboids. As he returns to Perfection, he finds that a lot has changed. Jodi, niece of merchant Walter who died in T1, has turned the store into a graboid themed shop. A new character, Desert Jack, takes tourists on graboid safari. And Mel, who was a teenager in T1, has returned and wants to build condos in the desert.
No one has seen the worms for 11 years. Now they return. No longer cut off from the world, the citizens of Perfection contact the authorities. The worms being big desert reptiles, become protected under the laws regarding conservation of species, and illegal to kill. Which also means that Mel can't develop the land, to Perfection's joy.
The worms start developing into shriekers, but the shriekers aren't the final stage in the graboids' evolution.
This movie introduces Desert Jack, Jodi and El Blanco, who were so important in the TV series.

Tremors 4: the legend begins: the year is 1889. In the small mining town in Rejection, Nevada, some eggs hatch...  And soon miners start dying. Enter Hiram Gummer, mine owner and...wimp.
It's a hoot to see the ancestors of the main characters from T1 - T3, how they interact and how they ended up in this little desert town. Not to mention the beginning of the graboids!

All 4 Tremors movies are great. They're exciting, entertaining and fun. Part horror, part splatter, part comedy, part monster movie, I have seen all 4 several times and I haven't tired of them yet. In fact, I'm hungry for more!
All the main characters are quite eccentric, without making it stupid, adding to the entertainment value. Each movie reveals something new about the worms.

Tremors is a great movie about large ground tunneling carnivorous worms that have made there home in a small town of hicks that use swear words like nouns, verbs and adjectives.

It is because the actors are not so serious and wooden, because they know the type of film they are making and they all are having a good time doing it.  What you get is a film that feels good to watch because characters in the story are built well and you feel for each of them.  You also get some tense moments where the worms almost get their victim multiple times. And of course you get some great monster mashing action where guns and explosives are a blazin'.

I didn't care much for the second and fourth films (so I deducted one star). Return to Perfection (actually, I don't think the original location, Lone Pine, CA, was used) has great characters. Shawn Christian does a great Brad Pitt impression and is really fun to watch. Susan Chuang steals some scenes with some really humorous lines. In fact, Return to Perfection made me laugh on several occasions; it has a very witty script.

These are not staged horror films, but what could be real people's real reactions to seeing giant monsters. The first is my favorite, and in some people opinion the second might be better... and the third, well the name of the monsters in that movie is priceless, and the fourth, well most historical movies tend to bore me, but its worth seeing how to combat monsters in the old west.

Michael Gross, the constant in the series, throws his Keaton image to the wind to create a hilarious character in an ever-evolving arc of a fine mix of thrills, chills, drama, comedy, and wickedly good effects.  The series perhaps would have been best left a trilogy, but the fourth installment, and following short-lived television show, proved a relatively simple idea, man against ""nature,"" can take on a life of its own and never disappoint.

1) The only season of Tremors: the Series is not included in this set and the Sci-Fi channel still has it locked away in their vault.

2) The majority of the special features are gone except for those of the first film and about half of the fourth film.  The fourth film I had rented once and saw a very entertaining short film and I was shocked to discover it was no longer there.

3) The movies are on 2 duel sided discs, meaning that they are cheap and prone to damage if you are not extremely careful with them.

On the good side though, you do get all four films for the low price of 20 dollars.  I love all of the tremors films (yes even the third one which gets a bad rap, even by me sometimes), I hope that some day there will be a fifth one and that even though the series deserves a much better box set, this one will do until the one day release the TV series and the rumored 5th film.

2391841,4,B000ASATZ8,"Before I rate the box set and the four movies I would like to give you a brief history of my life with these films. When I was really young I use to always ask my dad to rent Tremors and we would all set and whatch it. But when I got a bit older and I could understand things better I became afraid and was scared of Grabiods coming up from underneath are house and eating me. Anyways after about two years I got the guts to whatch Tremors 2: After shocks. And Afterwards I was agian afraid of Grabiods and now Shriekers attacking me. Finally after about ten years of not watching them, me and my buddy Travis got to talking about Tremors and he asked me what Grabiods where. So I dicided to draw him pictures of them and after a few days I ended up creating a Tremors comic. So after becoming so involved with Tremors again I decided to watch the first film again. And after it ended, I bought it off Amazon and a week later I bought the third movie and then another week after that I bought the second. I had literly gone a 180 from fearing Tremors so long ago to become a huge fan. And when the fourth finally came out I had my family, my friend Travis and his brother hooked. Now after being a huge fan and watching the four films over and over I can finally rate them. The original Tremors is by far the best; with it's all star cast and great story line. The second best would have to be Tremors 4: The Legend Begins because it stays more true to the first and it shows how it all began. Tremors 2: After shocks would be third best since it stared Earl and Gummer and Tremors 3: Back to Prefection would have to be the worst since it's story is weak, its short and it takes the evolution thing a bit far. Overall this is a great pack of all four Tremors movies and if I hadn't boughten all of them aready I would buy this Attack Pack. Ps. Tremors 5 script has been finished and if Tremors 4 sales enough they will make a fifth. And one more thing it would be awsome if Universal would release Tremors: The Series on DVD.",1155686400,4,2026,4.092964824120603

My favorite thing about these movies though is something that isn't even in the actually movie themselves.  See a few years ago my fiancee was in the hospital with the ear infection from hell.  She was in the hospital for about 60 hours and asleep for most of it.  I hardly left her side.  One while she was asleep I was flipping through the channels and landed on USA which was having a Tremors Marathon, showing all 4 movies.  It was great!  I couldn't leave her side, but sitting next to a sleeping person all day isn't a whole lotta fun, but Tremors was there for me.  Now I think about her everything I watch one of the movies.

The Attack Pack also contains two double-sided flippers, not four discs.

However, the upside is that the first two films, ""Tremors"" and ""Tremors 2: Aftershocks"" are both anamorphically enhanced in this set, which they are not on standard, stand-alone DVD, and all bonus features for the first three movies ARE included.

2391865,4,B000ASATZ8,"Seems like all trilogys (and series that extend to quadrilogys) suffer with one bad film in the series Or perhaps there is a film thats nowhere up to the standard of the rest. In my opinion series like aliens/ Terminator /godfather /robocop all have this problem. Tremors though i think is unique all the films are good.

I personally had never seen or heard about tremors 3 or 4 until they came out on satelite. So i thought they

were going to be some dreadful straight to dvd movies thankfully thats not the case there both good movies.

I think the only real problem with the tremors movies (particulary in tremors 3) is when they use CGI for the graboids. They just do not look right. Also when people have to act infront of non existent monsters then there never as convincing as acting infront of something more physical like a

a proper made monster.

Overall  a great series. But i think more effort could have been made for the dvd release. There are a few making of's and a

commentary on tremors 4 but thats pretty much it. One thing i did not like was tremors 1 was censored

Still worth getting though",1134604800,3,1115,4.431372549019608
2391866,5,B000ASATZ8,"Certainly the jewel in the Tremors series of movies between 1990 and 2004 is the original. It's funny. It's scary. It's suspenseful. It's got a great cast. It's fun to watch! And this DVD release gives you the three follow-on sequels for almost the price you'd expect to spend for the original cult classic by itself.

In the original 1990 ""Tremors"", you have Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward as the leading characters. Their performance together is (almost) on par with John Travolta and Sam Jackson in Pulp Fiction; the dialogue between these guys is priceless. They truly come across as buddies for life.

The story is simple: a B-movie-esque scenario where giant man-eating subterranean monsters (big wormlike things called aptly named Graboids) start plucking man and animal from the surface in a remote desert town. Bacon and Ward are trapped by the underground beasts with little known Finn Carter and mercenary neighbors (Michael Gross) and his wife (Reba McEntire). The result is a fun story of everyone saving themselves and finding a way to kill the monsters before the monsters eat them all.

Tremors 2 is very entertaining. Another fun movie and an above par sequel. But gone is the realistic notion that the original movie carried with ""these-people-are-trapped-and-have-no-choice-but-to-fight-the-monsters-themselves"". Instead remnant cast members Ward and Gross (instead of the military or some superior entity) are commissioned to dispose of the reappearance of the Graboids. Kevin Bacon is a huge loss to the the comradery factor that the original held. The flick moves a long well, has a good story, it's still scary and suspenseful, and has a great surprise twist when the Graboids mutate making this somewhat of an original in its own right.

The next two movies, Tremors 3 and Tremors 4 are fair. I could easily spend less time and be as entertained by the much shorter SpongeBob Squarepants 10 minute ""Alaskan Bull Worm!"" tribute episode to the original Tremors.

Tremors 3 is the better of the two with another mutation twist, and an entertaining story. Michael Gross is back as Burt, but you really have to turn a blind eye to the why-hasn't-anyone-called-the-frickin'-army factor. Tremors 4 is a prequel to the original that is difficult to sit all the way through. There is really no need to elaborate on #3 or #4, because they are both so predictable based on the first two that you can easily guess what they are about and what happens.

A cool thing about all of them is that creator, writer, producer and director SS Wilson is on board for all four flicks to hold everything together better than other films that spawn one too many sequels.

All in all, as I said earlier, the original Tremors alone makes this a very, very worthwhile addition to any collector's movie library, in-genre or out. The addition of Tremors 2 makes this purchase a very easy Add to Cart. ""But be advised, Burt, there are two more...I repeat...two more mother-humpers"".",1133740800,103,2970,4.975806451612903
2391867,3,B000ASATZ8,"PROS

- You get all 4 movies in one box, a great value at about ~$5 per movie!

- The first movie is the best but you'll probably also like the fourth (which is a prequel) and either the 2nd or 3rd if you haven't seen any of them yet.

- Inside is a coupon for $10.50 off a ticket to Peter Jackson's King Kong which opens in theaters 12-14-05 (valid until 1-1-06).

CONS

- Despite the claims on the packaging for 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, all four movies are presented in 1.78:1 NON-anamorphic widescreen. In fact, the video transfers are exactly the same as those on the previous DVDs.

- All 4 movies are on TWO discs - which of course means both discs are double-sided. ARGH. If you're not the type of person to handle optical discs carefully, forget buying this, you'll probably scratch everything up right away, no offense.

- To make matters worse for two double-sided discs, the DVD case Universal came up with is absolutely atrocious. It's one of those double-inset ones, where you've got sub-impressioned spaces for the discs, so you can actually see both discs simultaneously, but in order to remove the disc on the lower inset, you have to remove the disc on the upper inset first because it's on top. And doing that without touching the lower disc is easier said than done. Universal couldn't use one of those convenient double-flip panel DVD cases instead? This approach is just plain aggravating.

- The cardboard slip case that houses the actual DVD case is designed backwards, so the DVD case slips out from the left, instead of the right!

- Four movies on two discs screams cheapness. Why didn't Universal just put together all four DVD sets to make a four-movie mega-package?

MOVIES SYNOPSIS

Sorry, not enough space for write-ups of each movie, but you can read up on them individually here on Amazon, each one has lots of customer reviews! To sum up, the first movie is about the Graboids, big monsters that lurk underground and lurch out when they feel something moving on the ground! Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are hysterical! The 2nd movie has the ""shriekers,"" the next evolution of the Graboids. The 3rd shows the ""ass-blasters,"" the next next evolution. Gotta watch to find out why they're named that! Finally the 4th is set in 1889 and goes back to the origins of the Graboids.

SPECIAL FEATURES

I have an affectionate liking to this series, having seen the first one in the theater when it originally came out.  There are two discs, the first one contains Tremors and Tremors 2, and the second disc contains Tremors 3 and Tremors 4.  Of the special features, for Tremors, they left out the featurette on how they created the special effects which is included in the single Blu-ray Tremors.  Tremors 2 has zero features, and for Tremors 3 and Tremors 4, identical to the single discs.  So I will be still holding on to my Blu-ray of Tremors.

The quality of the movies is pristine, and when one look at a few of the featurettes, their muddiness compared to the crisp movies is obvious.

If one is finding out about Tremors for the first time, watch Tremors 4 first, then Tremors and Tremors 2 and 3 in that order.",1522454400,2,906,4.389221556886228
