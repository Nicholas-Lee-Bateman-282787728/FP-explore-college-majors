4048143,2,B00315462Y,"This is a Thai film designed for Thai audiences.  It deals with a Thai couple keeping ancient antiques in the country, so it has a nationalist message.  When I visited Japan, almost every sign had a Roman-alphabet translation with it.  Here things were written just in Thai.  That's fine; it's just different.  We Americans bag on dubbed films too much, but the dubbing here did seem slightly off.

This had a cool martial arts scene on top of used cars.  There's a wicked bomb explosion.  The women, both friend and foe, were given strong, or at least non-marginal, roles.  Still, the martial arts isn't as good as in a Jackie Chan film.  The film does wrap loose ends well.  It just had the feel of a B-movie that you'd seen on Ted Turner's network.  This was not awful, but it's far from award-winning.

I love Russell Wong, but must admit that he gets crappy roles.  He may be past his prime, unfortunately.  However, he looks good here.  He's not as pudgy as in recent films.  He might represent the bridge between East and West here.  This may be signified as he is a ""yellow"" man first seen dressed all in white.  He's a foreigner clearly, but he has a Asian love interest and hottie.  He does martial arts (Eastern) but collaborates with foreigners (Western).  I wonder if his multiraciality may have played a role in choosing him for the role.  He has a bedroom scene, but you only see his back.  You miss his chest and booty, which he luckily showed in the film with Jennifer Beals and Christopher Walken.",1273622400,3,1515,4.529629629629629
4048144,3,B00315462Y,"With the fabulous Tony Jaa not coming out to play for long periods of time, I guess it falls on former stuntman ""Mike B."" to serve as the next best thing. Never mind that Mike B. (or Pairote Boongerd) isn't as explosive as Jaa, isn't as charismatic or as visceral. The next best thing stars in THE SANCTUARY (a.k.a. Saam Pan Bohk), but if you're anticipating an action thriller along the lines of ONG BAK or TOM YUM GOONG, brother, you've been sniffing too much from the sacred glue pot of inordinate optimism.

The gist: Temple boy Krit (Mike B.) and an archaeology undergrad student named Praifa (Intira Jaroenpura) are thrown together on a quest to regain the invaluable Royal Antiques from an international thief (Russell Wong, cool and debonair as ever). And, somewhere, Tony Jaa is scratching his head at the suspicious familiarity of the thing, perhaps having assumed he'd cornered the market on plot lines involving the good guy recovering the stolen relic.

Doesn't matter much, anyway. Films like this require only the barest of plot, something to act as a vehicle for the martial arts sequences. Ah, but what if the fight scenes aren't all that and a bag of chips? Or, put another way - because there are two fairly decent action set pieces - what if there weren't enough fighty fights? You should save the best for last, and the best martial arts scuffle in this film - the one in the auto junk yard - surfaces early on. The other passable sequence features Krit's showdown with three of Wong's goons near the end.

Thanks to Tony Jaa, a whole mess of us have become fans of Muay Thai. Jaa indoctrinated us to the startling vision of an abusive knee driving full-on into a bad guy's sensitive areas. Mike B. doesn't have Jaa's panache and it's pretty unforgivable that, in this movie, Mike B's bland protagonist takes his damn sweet time getting his mojo, and when he does strut his stuff, I am frankly unimpressed with the goods. Seen it all before, you see. Still, it's mildly interesting to see Mike B. pitting his Muay Thai against Russell Wong's aikido. Was it wrong that I was rooting for Russell?

Acting-wise, Russell Wong carries the film, and he seems to be having fun with his role. I remember Wong fondly from his VANISHING SON days, and I wish he'd made bigger waves in his career. But every time I see him in something, it seems like he's always playing the villain.

We endure useless sub-plots concerning Russell Wong's double-crossing and the poisoning of one of his henchmen (some loser named Gary), as well as some mystical mumbo-jumbo regarding an amulet. These bits of boredom serve to pad up the running time. THE SANCTUARY goes at around an hour and a half, but the lackluster effort and scatterbrained screenplay drag it out so that it seems as long as a Bollywood movie.

The DVD's bonus stuff includes the ""Making of SANCTUARY"" featurette (9 minutes, English sub-titles) and trailers for THE SANCTUARY, BRAVE, and HIGH KICK GIRL. Regarding these three titles, martial arts cinema has seen better days.",1273449600,4,3039,4.724528301886792

8386557,2,B00315462Y,"Not unlike how&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nirvana/dp/B000003TA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nirvana</a>&nbsp;made Seattle the recruiting hotbed for the pop music industry in the mid-80s, Tony Jaa's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ong-Bak/dp/B0009VBTQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ong-Bak</a>&nbsp;has the western action film industry's eyes on Thailand, importing and rereleasing just about everything they can get their hands on in hopes of finding the next great copycat. To be succinct, they will not find it in ""The Sanctuary"", the sophomore solo outing of stuntman-turned-star Michael Boongerd, mostly because there's not nearly enough action here to live up to the standard set by Jaa and his team.

The story: when national Thai treasures lost for a hundred years are in danger of being found and stolen by an underground crime syndicate, it is up to an orphaned young man (Boongerd,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brave/dp/B002Q9VP7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brave</a>) and an aspiring archaeologist (Intira Jaroenpura,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nang-Nak/dp/B0007P0Y72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nang Nak</a>) to retrieve them for the honor of their country.

The opening credits name roughly half-a-dozen different production companies who contributed to this film, the result of which is an average-quality presentation and a very flawed narrative. I'm vaguely reminded of direct-to-video Steven Seagal films, the storytelling difficulties of which came as a result of the filmmakers needing to please and represent the ideas of multiple parties. I can easily imagine something similar going on here, as that'd explain the inclusion of the unnecessary opening escapade (i.e. the scene set in the 1800s), the trailed-off storyline tangents (e.g. Krit's twin brother, the ""voodoo poison""), inharmonious switches in narrative focus (e.g. why do I care about a sex scene between villains?), and the fact that an entire scene in the film was lifted from an entirely different production. The credits list only two writers, but it really seems as though there were at least ten people involved in setting up this one's plot, insistently forcing their own individual ideas in.

This would be easily overlookable if there were more decent action scenes going on, but it seems they came at the expense of the hodge-podge of a plot. Despite the misdirection of the opening scene, it supplies the film with a thoroughly enjoyable weapons fight, and shortly thereafter we get to see Michael show off by fighting a bunch of guys on top of a tower of stacked cars. The scene's not exactly phenomenal, but you'll be begging for something like it after the movie proceeds to go for the next fifty minutes without a commendable hand-to-hand fight (I'm not including the glorified mugging between Mike and the three henchmen on the rooftop). This is partly due to the fact that the main hero doesn't really turn into one until the film's last fifteen minutes; before that, he ends up in critical condition twice and needs to be nursed back to health both times. Through the power of an absurd medallion, he finally develops some skills and has a pretty good rematch against the aforementioned rooftop trio, showing off some of the wire-free flipping and spinning that Thai stars are becoming known for. He eventually has a showdown with Russell Wong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romeo-Must-Die/dp/B00003CXGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romeo Must Die</a>), who's been running around this whole time as the primary antagonist. Their fight is two-phased and too one-sided during both segments for my taste, but ol' Russ gets to show off a series of painful-looking joint locks, different from his usual flashy stuff. It's not a very showy fight, but arguably a well-choreographed one.

The credits hint a sequel, but after the movie went a whole 96 minutes without a single fight with the featured Winston Omega (sifu to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gary-Daniels/dp/B0001US7MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gary Daniels</a>, in his first role of prominence), I can't say I feel forgiving enough to be interested in the possibility. ""The Sanctuary"" isn't really a bad movie, but it's mediocre enough to deserve this rating on a bad day. Be sure you've combed the rest of Thai cinema really well before resorting to this one.",1320105600,,4581,6.064814814814815
8386558,2,B00315462Y,"two stars, one for spending some money actually producing this movei, another star for having it on Amazon.
Unless you are absolutely bored and have nothing to do, like me, and have Amazon prime membership where you can watch for free, don't bother watching this flick.
This is a waste of time and ""money"" if you spent anything on it.

The only thing left after watching this movie is the desire to go scout a vase that looks like the antique vase in the movie.
So, I am going to search in Amazon now for something that looks like it.",1310342400,,534,4.34
8386559,3,B00315462Y,"The Thai actioner ""The Sanctuary"" opens with impressive martial arts fight scene set in the 19th century. It is about the bandits stealing the national treasures and the royal guards trying to stop them. The fight scenes are pretty intense and violent, but it delivers the goods. Unfortunately, ""The Sanctuary"" cannot keep with the level of intensity of opening action, soon losing steam before it enters the main story.

The story quickly moves to the present day. Mike B plays Krit, a young man selling fake relics to tourists. The story is a familiar one, about an ordinary person who gets involved with a group of gangsters and assassins led by a baddie played by smirking Russell Wong. With a help from a beautiful grad student Praifa (Intira Jaroenpura), Krit must save the stolen royal antiques before they are brought outside the country. Well, just like the hero of ""Ong-Bak.""

I don't care if the story is terribly disjointed. I enjoyed ""Ong-Bak"" and ""Chocolate"" anyway. Strangely, Krit has a twin brother Kirk, played by Mike B again, but he unceremoniously disappears. There are nice stunt works here and there, with one big explosion scene, but not much enough to keep us interested, and those action set-pieces could have been improved with better editing and camera. Not exactly a disaster, but as action film ""The Sanctuary"" is slightly below-average.",1288828800,,1367,4.991228070175438
