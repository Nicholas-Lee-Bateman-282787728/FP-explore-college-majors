7949307,5,B00005PJ84,I'm 32 and watched this with my nephew and I found it great. he has a ridiculously expensive bike and is a brat about it he's 14 and just wants to smoke reefer. There is a sweet new bike park less than a mile from our house he has not bee there since he got this bike. oh well at least my younger nephews aren't such cootches yet.,1407542400,,330,3.8676470588235294
7949308,3,B00005PJ84,"I thought this was a good idea to show my 9 yr old nephew what tricks can be done on his BMX bike.  Did I know he was going to run right out and try them without lessons?  My mother cringed when she saw all the stunts, but he thought they were cool.  This is a good video for a kid who is really interested in learning.",1391040000,,319,3.7313432835820897
7949309,5,B00005PJ84,"I am an old school rider and I don't know how to do anything,This Video should be out there for everyone to watch. I give it a five star rating. I never liked Dave Mirra very much but props to him on this instructional video. Its Rad and he is riding a Haro.",1282262400,,258,3.8867924528301887
7949310,5,B00005PJ84,"This video is a must have for beginners. It goes over all the basics and some advanced tricks. It covers what to look for in a bike, bunny hops, manuals, how to drop in on ramps, grinds,m bar spins, and much much more. It is very valuable and will teach u everything u want to know about starting out in bmx",1235952000,,307,4.049180327868853
7949311,5,B00005PJ84,"Just learned to ride that BMX of yours?  You will want to pick this dvd up if you want to get to the ramps.  Not much in the way of flatland/freestyle riding.  Just enough to get you going for the ramps.  I don't have any skate parks near me so flatland/freestyle is the most I can hope for.  Why do they tear down kids dirt ramps in vacant fields?  I'm 25 and I say it stinks!  Anyhow, the real beginner will appreciate this dvd, and so will mom and dad.  Covers safety often and most importantly (to mom and dad's wallet) what to look for in a first bike!  GET TO IT!",1053388800,6,569,4.008928571428571
7949312,5,B00005PJ84,I have been riding BMX for years and I'm very good. I wish I had this movie when I started off. REcently my friend let me borrow the movie. I watched it and it was awesome. BMX can be a hard sport and can be kind of dangerous but with this movie you can have an easier. I am 15 and have been BMXing since I was 7 years old. If I have had that movie then I would have been a lot better. I hear that volume 2 is going to be so much better with more advancr tricks. I'm more of a dirt jumper and I hear there will be dirt juming in it. This movie makes you wanna get your bike and go out and ride. So what ever you do don't watch it on a rainy day.,1034380800,6,645,3.5815602836879434
7949313,5,B00005PJ84,"This is an extremely important video to watch if you are just begining ramp riding or perhaps want to improve your existing skills. He covers barspins, roll backs/fakie's, manuals, bunny hops, grinds, fly out's, peg stall drop in's and a lot more. Dave Mirra and his crew ( including Ryan Nyquist and other's) take you step by step into the tricks. I strongly advise this video if you want to learn the right way and minimize injury's. It runs at a good pace and good quality video work. It also takes you all the way to Dave Mirra's house where he gives you a personal tour!",1009065600,10,575,4.433962264150943
